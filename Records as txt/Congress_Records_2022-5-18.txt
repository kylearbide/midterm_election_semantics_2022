WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, MAY 18, 2022 
No. 85 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Give ear, O Shepherd, You who have 
led 
Your 
people 
time 
and 
again 
through hardship and calamity. You 
who sit enthroned in the heavens, stir 
up Your might and come save Your 
people suffering at the hands of their 
enemies. 
Restore the people of Ukraine, O God 
of hosts. Let Your face shine upon 
them in the darkness of their despair 
that they may be saved from the on-
slaught of terror being inflicted upon 
them. 
Feed them no more with the bread of 
their tears. Nourish them no more with 
the scorn of their enemies. But extend 
Your hand of favor upon them that 
their lives would be preserved. 
Turn Your eyes on them and regard 
their faithfulness. Let Your hand rest 
upon those who remain devoted to You. 
Then may all experience the immeas-
urable strength of Your abiding pres-
ence and find hope. 
In the power of Your name we offer 
our prayers. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER) come 
forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER led the Pledge of 
Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle.

SICK AND TIRED 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am sick and tired of stand-
ing up here to say I am sick and tired. 
I am tired of reminding my colleagues 
that we have a gun violence epidemic 
in this country outside of mass shoot-
ings. 
We hold moments of silence. We 
stand up, we sit down, but we do noth-
ing. The mass shooting carried out by 
a racist white supremacist in Buffalo 
last weekend was absolutely horrible. I 
am truly sorry for the victims’ families 
and for the whole community. 
But also know, this weekend in Chi-
cago 33 people were shot and five died, 
and we did nothing. I care both about 
the people who are killed by guns, 
whether they are shot alone in a park 
or next to their neighbors in a super-
market. I see a lot of colleagues ex-
pressing outrage about the Buffalo 
shooting, but outrage means nothing 
until we start legislating or investing 
in solutions. 
I do not care what the Senate will or 
won’t pass. Let them go on record and 
show the American people whether 
they care about their safety or not. 
Just who and how many have to die be-
fore we take action? 
f 
PELOTON VIP MEMBERSHIPS 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, it is 
an open secret that Americans are fac-
ing serious challenges today. Many of 
these challenges are Washington-in-
flicted caused by Democrats’ incom-
petence and radicalism. Absolute chaos 
on the southern border, unsafe streets, 
record-high gas prices, rising inflation, 
a broken supply chain, an ongoing 
labor shortage, a failing education sys-
tem, and, of course, a baby formula 
shortage they knew about for more 
than a year. 
Will this Congress be remembered as 
the Congress that addressed these 
issues? Probably not. Instead, this Con-
gress will go down in history as the 
out-of-touch Congress. 
This week, as families scramble to 
find baby formula, Speaker PELOSI’s 
House decided to add special new perks 
for Washington lawmakers and staff. 
One of those perks was a VIP member-
ship to Peloton gyms; paid for by hard-
working American taxpayers. What is 
next, free Jeni’s ice cream? 
You may be asking: What is Peloton? 
It is a bike that costs about $2,000. Not 
only that, each month you pay a 
monthly subscription fee to ride your 
$2,000 bike. Best of all, it is stationary. 
They charge you about $300 to set it up. 
It is a $2,000 bike that you pay to use 
and pay to set up that doesn’t go any-
where. What a business. 
Speaker PELOSI decided to give ev-
eryone in Congress a Peloton gym 
membership; more specifically, the pre-
mier employee benefits package. You 
know what, she did it without any de-
bate or discussion with any Repub-
licans. 
First, they appoint a political com-
mittee and don’t allow the Republicans 
to name anybody. Now they decide to 
use your taxpayer money and never 
talked to the other side. We were left 
in the dark. Congress, meaning tax-
payers, will pay Peloton $10,000 up 
front and $10 per month per person. In 
all, this contract could cost taxpayers

an extra $100,000 or more per month. I 
guess New York City isn’t the only 
place Speaker PELOSI went on a spend-
ing spree last week. 
As the sixth richest Member of Con-
gress, the Speaker might not be wor-
ried about this costly new program, 
but American families should sweat it. 
It 
comes 
as 
families 
are 
getting 
crushed by the worst inflation in 40 
years. It is insane. 
It is also redundant. Members and 
staff already have access to a congres-
sional gym for a membership fee. The 
Peloton perk did not replace it. In-
stead, it duplicates it. 
I would like to see any Democrat go 
to their district, my district, anyone 
else’s district and defend this; look 
people straight in the face. I will tell 
you what is happening in our district, 
there are parents who are going to 
eight or nine stores looking for baby 
formula, paying for gas that you can 
barely afford. 
Instead of trying to help these strug-
gling families, Democrats are plun-
dering their pocketbooks to pay for 
Pelosi’s Peloton membership. 
You can’t image a more out-of-touch 
party. This isn’t just an exception; it is 
the rule in the Democratic conference. 
Let me tell you something, Mr. Speak-
er. I actually heard your conference 
chair, HAKEEM JEFFRIES, say—talking 
about the Democrat agenda and saying 
about gas prices: ‘‘That issue hasn’t 
come up in our conference.’’ It has 
come up in every single American’s 
kitchen table, but not in the Demo-
cratic conference. 
Mr. Speaker, we also heard a Demo-
crat Member, Congresswoman PORTER, 
who said: ‘‘We aren’t seeing inflation in 
the polls.’’ I am not sure what polls 
they are taking that they think that 
Peloton for Members and staff is going 
to solve this problem. 
In the Democratic conference nobody 
talks about gas prices because they 
haven’t heard about it. The polling 
says inflation doesn’t come up. Yet, as 
we speak, Democrats are pushing for 
more reckless spending and higher 
taxes that will only make this problem 
worse. 
Mr. Speaker, I remember sitting on 
this floor, talking in this mike, warn-
ing the majority party, the Democrats, 
if they went through with the reckless 
spending of almost $2 trillion that in-
flation would come. The sad part, Mr. 
Speaker, is that it wasn’t just the Re-
publicans warning you, it was Demo-
crats; those that had worked in the 
Obama administration and the Biden 
administration. 
Lo and behold, what have we found, 
Mr. Speaker? Inflation. They first want 
to tell America, no, it is just tem-
porary. No, it is not. We now have the 
former ex-Fed chair saying you are 
going to get stagflation, just like in 
the 1970s. Do you remember in the late 
1970s when you couldn’t get gas on an 
even day if your license plate ended in 
an odd number? Now you don’t know if 
you can afford it when you pull up. 
You don’t know if your credit card 
goes high enough. You don’t know if 
you have enough money to go. You are 
filling it up because you are trying to 
drive to find baby formula that the ad-
ministration knew about for a year and 
did nothing about. 
We have watched a Congress be so 
partisan. We have watched a Wash-
ington with one-party rule and only 
care about one person—themselves. 
Their first bill was about changing 
election law so they could dictate who 
wins. Then when the polls were bad and 
they were going to lose, they appointed 
a political committee to go after their 
political opponents. 
That is all going to change in 174 
days from now. That focus is going to 
be on you, the American people. It is 
not going to be more Pelotons for those 
in Congress. It is not going to be wast-
ing your taxpayer money. It is not 
going to be appointing committees and 
not allowing the other side just to go 
after your political opponents. It is 
going to be focusing on America. 
Do you know what the rise in gas 
prices with this one-party rule has 
done to America? It is costing every 
family more than $2,000. The rising 
prices are costing them an extra $5,000. 
An open border is now costing the lives 
of Americans. 
Fentanyl is the number one cause of 
death for Americans between the ages 
of 18 and 45. I don’t know how that 
doesn’t show up on their polls. Now 
what do they want to do? They want to 
lift title 42. It is not just Republicans 
warning them, it is Democrats, who sat 
as Secretaries of Homeland Security, 
warned them not to do it. 
I don’t know if they think it will 
take the attention away from no baby 
formula, can’t afford gas, inflation con-
tinuing to rise; but they think they are 
doing all right. 
We should reward staff and get them 
a Peloton membership. Don’t just get 
them any membership, get them the 
VIP. They think it doesn’t cost you 
anything because they take it to the 
American taxpayer, the hardworking 
taxpayer, 
to 
spend 
more 
of 
your 
money. Just like they did with $2 tril-
lion. Just like they wanted to do more 
with their Build Back Better. 
Have they not learned enough? If you 
go to their conferences, I am not sure 
what they talk about. They say they 
don’t bring up the gas price. They say 
inflation doesn’t show up in the polls. 
They are probably looking at more 
perks and spending more tax dollars. 
That day is ending soon and a new Con-
gress with a focus on the American 
people and the future of America is 
soon to come. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BEYER). Members are reminded to di-
rect their comments to the Chair, 
please. 
f 
OPIOID CRISIS 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to express my greatest concern and the 
urgency to act now to address our Na-
tion’s opioid crisis and drug overdoses. 
At the height of the pandemic in 2020 
we saw record numbers of overdoses 
across the country, and in Michigan we 
saw even more alarming rates. In 2020, 
the opioid crisis claimed the loved ones 
of over 2,400 Michiganders and commu-
nities like Ecorse, Michigan, in the 
13th District, has seen the highest 
overdose rates in our State. 
The physical and mental health of 
our communities are under siege. We 
must do more and act with urgency to 
save lives. Accessibility to preventive 
treatments and resources for harm re-
duction is critical in keeping our com-
munities safe. 
Also, we must not forget the impor-
tance of holding for-profit Big Pharma 
companies accountable in fueling this 
epidemic through the sale of higher 
doses of opioids to our communities. 
We must make the bold action to re-
move the stigma as well of this crisis, 
create equitable treatment plans, and 
expand access to harm reduction tools 
for those who need help. 
I applaud the administration for un-
derstanding the importance of this 
issue, but our communities can’t wait 
another year for a grant or another 
study. We must hold the corporate 
profiteers accountable and get the 
boots on the ground to address this cri-
sis.

RECOGNIZING THE ROANOKER 
RESTAURANT 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize The Roanoker Restaurant, 
an establishment so iconic it carries its 
city’s namesake. 
Opened in 1941 by Craft Warren, this 
Roanoke staple has served as a gath-
ering place for generations. For nearly 
81 years, The Roanoker provided folks 
across the Star City a place to come 
together over a delicious, home-cooked 
meal. 
Its current owner, Butch Craft, began 
working at the restaurant more than 52 
years ago before eventually taking 
over the business. 
Over the course of its storied history, 
the restaurant has moved throughout 
Roanoke before making its way to its 
current and, unfortunately, final home 
on Colonial Avenue in 1982. 
This week, the entire Star City was 
saddened to learn that, after more than 
eight 
decades 
in 
business, 
The 
Roanoker will be closing its doors at 
the end of the month. 
One resident said it best: It is going 
to be greatly missed, no doubt about it. 
It is going to be so missed.

It certainly will be, and I will take a 
moment to thank the Warren family, 
Butch Craft, and everyone who has 
worked at The Roanoker and made it 
such a success and made diners feel at 
home for so many years.

HONORING MEREDITH ‘‘MERRIE’’ 
ROOSA INDERFURTH 
(Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to acknowledge the lifetime of 
public service of Meredith ‘‘Merrie’’ 
Roosa Inderfurth. 
After graduating from Brown Univer-
sity, Merrie came to Washington to 
earn an MPA at George Washington 
University, and she never left. 
Merrie joined the congressional staff 
of Representative Lindy Boggs, whose 
late husband, then-Majority Leader 
Hale Boggs, led the creation of the Na-
tional Flood Insurance Program, ce-
menting Merrie’s interest in flood 
management. 
During her 15 years with Representa-
tive Boggs, Merrie took time to have 
two extraordinary daughters, one of 
whom is my deputy chief of staff and 
essential to my office. Her sister is a 
respected prosecutor in nearby Mont-
gomery County. Her stepdaughter is a 
highly qualified medical professional. 
Merrie then returned to public life 
and made use of her flood pedigree, 
serving for almost 30 years as the 
Washington liaison for the Association 
of State Floodplain Managers and the 
National Flood Association. 
In 2007, she was the recipient of the 
association’s highest honor, the God-
dard-White 
Award 
for 
outstanding 
leadership and guidance on flood policy 
issues. 
I express my sincere appreciation for 
the career in public service of my 
friend, Merrie Inderfurth. 
f 
HONORING JEFF SHIPP 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the storied 
career of Mr. Jeff Shipp as he cele-
brates his retirement from the Farm 
Credit Council. 
Jeff has worked in and around the 
Farm Credit System for virtually his 
entire adult life. Raised as a true D.C. 
native, Jeff earned his bachelor’s de-
gree from the University of Maryland 
before obtaining his master’s at Tulane 
University. 
Jeff’s notable career working on 
Farm Credit issues started as an in-
ternship on Capitol Hill before he 
moved to USDA and what was then 
known as the Farmers Home Adminis-
tration. 
He then went to work representing 
farmers at the National Wheat Growers 
Association, which led him to the 
Farm Credit team in 1987. 
Perhaps one of the most distin-
guished moments of his career was 
when he worked to help pass the Farm 
Credit Act of 1987, which stabilized 
Farm Credit and set it on the sustain-
able path the organization continues to 
enjoy today. 
Jeff’s representation in Washington 
is second to none. Jeff has been the 
face of Farm Credit for many on Cap-
itol Hill, and he will certainly be 
missed as he enters retirement. 
Farm Credit, American agriculture, 
and our country are better off because 
of Jeff’s exceptional work. 
Congratulations, Jeff, on your very 
successful career, and best wishes to 
you and Susan for a long and happy 
next chapter. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MENTAL HEALTH 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. 
WATSON 
COLEMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, today, I rise in honor and rec-
ognition of Mental Health Awareness 
Month. 
Over the last 2 years, we certainly 
have seen tremendous stress on the 
mental health and well-being of our 
loved ones, our communities, and even 
our elected officials. 
Back in 2019, I led a task force that 
looked at the impact of mental health 
on Black youth and suicide, and I in-
troduced a piece of legislation that 
would address the gap in services to 
those individuals who are underserved. 
It is good that this is Mental Health 
Awareness Month. It is good that we 
are paying attention to the mental 
health of all of our citizens, including 
those who are elected officials. 
I am glad to know that we can extend 
that service even to the members of 
the Republican Conference who so des-
perately need mental health address-
ing. I almost think it is la-dee-da-dee 
in everybody. 
f 
HONORING THE LEGACY OF DR. 
JOHN CHENG 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
stand with my fellow Orange County 
Representatives to honor the courage 
and sacrifice of one of my constituents. 
On Sunday, Dr. John Cheng of Aliso 
Viejo drove his recently widowed moth-
er to her church in Laguna Woods. 
They were attending a special lunch in 
honor of their pastor, who had just re-
turned after 2 years in Taiwan. 
Just after lunch, a gunman opened 
fire, and Dr. Cheng gave his life defend-
ing those around him. Local law en-
forcement agents said, without Dr. 
Cheng’s courage, there would have been 
more casualties that day. 
He was a beloved son, husband, father 
of two, and a respected physician. He 
was a hero. 
We share our condolences with his 
family and stand here today to honor 
his life. 
Please join us in a moment of silence 
to honor Dr. Cheng. 
May he rest in peace, and may his 
courage never be forgotten. 
f 
CONDEMNING DOMESTIC 
TERRORISM 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, this 
Sunday, in the State in which I was 
born and raised, New York, a man 
drove 3 hours and 200 miles to terrorize 
members of a local Black community. 
This man shot 13 people, 11 of which 
were Black. 
This was not a random act of vio-
lence. This was a domestic terrorist at-
tack, an act of hate ignited by replace-
ment theory rhetoric that is fueled by 
white supremacists, FOX News, and, 
indeed, some of my Republican col-
leagues. 
This false, ignorant, race-baiting the-
ory, called the great replacement, has 
been used in multiple race-based do-
mestic terrorist acts, including the 
synagogue attack in Pittsburgh and 
the El Paso shooting attack in 2019. 
There are a number of my Republican 
colleagues who spew this vile and ven-
omous rhetoric. The silence of Repub-
lican leadership and their ranks in con-
demning this rhetoric that is not just 
ripping our country apart but contrib-
uting to the death of Americans shows 
that they are no longer the party of 
Lincoln or even the party of Ronald 
Reagan. 
f 
PAIN AT THE PUMP 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this gas 
price surge we are seeing at the pump 
wasn’t caused by Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine. It wasn’t caused by COVID–19. 
It isn’t transitory. 
It is not even caused by price gouging 
some are alleging by oil companies or 
gas stations. Indeed, the U.S. Secretary 
of Energy said there is no gouging due 
to that. 
No, they are all excuses President 
Biden has tried to use to shift blame 
for the increasing prices that he is 
causing himself. 
Mr. President, we know the truth. 
The American people know the truth. 
Sir, your price hike was caused by day 
one anti-American energy policies. 
Gas prices have increased every sin-
gle month under the Biden administra-
tion, from his first day in office can-
celing Keystone, suspending oil and gas 
leasing on Federal lands, and draining 
our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

He has also emboldened Putin by re-
moving sanctions on the Nord Stream 
2, therefore making Europe more de-
pendent on Soviet-style energy. 
President Biden hasn’t taken respon-
sibility for his failed policies. Instead, 
he is trying to cover them up or blame 
others. 
We must flip the switch on American 
energy production and reverse the 
Biden failed energy agenda. Putin is 
making a killing because of this. 
We have the wherewithal in this 
country to influence world prices by 
producing ourselves. 
f 
INCREASE 
REPRESENTATION 
OF 
AAPI COMMUNITY IN MEDICAL 
RESEARCH 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, during 
Asian American Pacific Islander Herit-
age Month, we recognize that diversity 
is more than a cultural exchange that 
enriches our Nation. It is a tool that 
we can use to save lives. 
Despite being the fastest-growing mi-
nority group in our Nation, AAPI com-
munities remain underrepresented in 
medical research. In 2019, NIH invested 
less than 1 percent of its budget to sup-
port clinical studies in AAPI commu-
nities. That is not enough. 
In Orange County, our institutions 
recognize the need to reach all of our 
communities with medical research. 
UC Irvine recently received $750,000 in 
Federal resources to increase diversity 
in clinical research, and that money is 
going to help AAPI communities ben-
efit 
from 
the 
university’s 
groundbreaking Alzheimer’s research. 
A medical innovation is only a mir-
acle when it reaches patients in need. 
The Nation should follow Orange Coun-
ty’s lead and work to provide the bene-
fits of publicly funded research to all 
communities. 
f 
AMERICANS ARE HURTING 
(Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
for the millions of Americans strug-
gling under skyrocketing prices, Presi-
dent Biden’s attention to this issue is a 
day late and many dollars short. 
For the first year in office, he denied 
inflation existed and then dismissed it 
as transitory. Now, he is blaming 
Putin, even though inflation was al-
ready at 71⁄2
percent before Putin’s 
army invaded Ukraine. 
It took President Biden almost a 
year to speak up because he doesn’t see 
inflation as a threat to families. He 
sees it as a threat to his political prob-
lems and his political party’s problems. 
Since Joe Biden became President, 
inflation has risen 11 percent; gas 
prices are at an all-time high; real 
wages have gone down 2.6 percent; and 
our economy is shrinking. This is the 
result of the President’s policies: high 
prices for food and energy, lower 
wages, and now a baby formula short-
age. 
Americans 
are 
hurting, 
and 
the 
President’s policies are making it 
worse. 
f 
DENOUNCE WHITE SUPREMACY 
(Mr. GREEN of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise. And I rise today to say 
that those who tolerate hate, perpet-
uate hate—it is not enough, Mr. Speak-
er, for us to prosecute the purveyors of 
the hate. Those who pull the trigger, 
those white supremacists, it is not 
enough to prosecute them individually. 
We have to prosecute hate itself. If we 
fail to do so, we fail our country. 
This is a country that allows us the 
freedom to move about, to go into 
stores and to other places of business. 
Business itself is going to suffer if we 
don’t stop this. 
I beg the business community, the 
Chamber of Commerce: Come out of 
the shadows. 
Where is the business community? 
Denounce this white supremacy. 
Where is the clergy? Denounce this 
white supremacy. 
Join me in a moment of silent prayer 
for all of those who have suffered.

PROTECT THE SANCTITY OF LIFE 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, as a Christian and father of four, 
the issue of abortion is personal to me. 
I believe an unborn child is a human 
life, fearfully and wonderfully made 
and worth protecting. 
In the last 50 years, scientific ad-
vancements have taught us a great 
deal about the early stages of life. As 
early as 5 weeks, babies in the womb 
have a heartbeat. 
Roe v. Wade is an inherently flawed 
opinion. Nowhere in our Constitution 
exists the right to abort a child. 
Recently, we watched the far left and 
liberal media attack our Supreme 
Court Justices after a leaked draft 
opinion shows that the Court might 
overturn Roe and give the States the 
power to decide this issue. 
Never content to let a crisis go to 
waste, the Senate Democrats tried to 
advance a radical and inhumane bill 
that would guarantee the right to 
abort a baby up until the moment of 
birth—until the very moment of birth. 
Shouldn’t a debate like this take 
place in the States, where citizens will 
have more input on this important 
issue? 
I will continue fighting for the un-
born, as well as the radical propaganda 
coming out of Washington. We must 
stop extreme attacks and protect the 
sanctity of life at all costs.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RAYMOND 
WADE, JR. 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of 
a beloved member of the Charlton 
County community, Raymond Wade, 
Jr. 
Tragedy struck our First District 
community this past week when we 
lost Raymond, a football star at 
Charlton County High School. A rising 
senior, Raymond played cornerback 
and wide receiver and was a respected 
leader on his team. 
No parent should ever have to bury 
their child, and when we lose a young 
man or woman our entire community 
suffers. Young people bring life, en-
ergy, and new ideas to the table, and 
Raymond was no exception. Among his 
peers and classmates, Raymond was re-
spected and loved. 
Charlton County High School had 
just begun spring practice and Ray-
mond’s football coach, Russ Murray, 
was excited for what Raymond could do 
in the fall. 
There were nearly 100 people involved 
in the search for Raymond, exhibiting 
the impact that he had made. His loss 
is a tremendous one that has impacted 
many. 
I will be praying for the Wade family 
and for the Charlton County commu-
nity, as well as Raymond’s friends.

SEC. 2. LACTATION SPACES IN MEDICAL CEN-

by adding at the end the following new sec-
tion: 
‘‘§ 1720K. Lactation spaces in medical centers

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
5738, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in strong support for H.R. 5738, 
as amended, the Lactation Spaces for 
Veteran 
Moms 
Act 
introduced 
by 
Chairwoman LURIA. The purpose of this 
bill is to ensure that each Department 
of Veterans Affairs Medical Center con-
tain a hygienic lactation space that is 
not a bathroom. 
This legislation requires the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs to provide es-
sential spaces to serve nursing individ-
uals and veteran mothers which are 
shielded from view, contain a chair and 
work surface, are free from intrusion, 
and are accessible to disabled individ-
uals. These spaces should also be easy 
to locate with clear, identifiable signs, 
and 
readily 
available 
for 
veteran 
moms. 
This bill is endorsed by numerous 
veterans service organizations includ-
ing the National Veterans Legal Serv-
ices Program, Paralyzed Veterans of 
America, Disabled American Veterans, 
and Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
Women veterans make up the fastest- 
growing community within the veteran 
population. In order to adequately 
meet their needs, VA needs to provide 
culturally competent care and re-
sources to ensure they will feel com-
fortable when they seek care at a VA 
facility. 
This legislation, which ensures safe, 
dedicated spaces for lactation, further 
advances VA’s mission to create a 
more welcoming and inclusive environ-
ment at its facilities. 
Women veterans face many chal-
lenges accessing essential VA care ben-
efits. The Lactation Spaces for Veteran 
Moms Act ensures VA eliminates bar-
riers that may discourage veteran 
moms from utilizing those benefits. 
A vote in support of this bill is a vote 
for women veterans and shows our 
dedication to ensuring VA delivers eq-
uitable and safe spaces for veteran 
moms. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5738, the Lactation Spaces for Veteran 
Moms Act. One of my priorities is 
strengthening services for women vet-
erans. This bill would do that by ensur-
ing that VA medical facilities have 
safe, clean, private spaces for them to 
use for breastfeeding. 
VA is already required to create 
these spaces for VA employees. It is 
only right that we give veteran moth-
ers who use VA facilities the ability to 
take care of their families this way as 
well. 
I am grateful to Congresswoman 
LURIA
and Congresswoman HERRERA 
BEUTLER for their work on this legisla-
tion. I urge all of my colleagues to join 
me in support of it today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Mrs. LURIA), my good friend, au-
thor of H.R. 5738, and the chair of the 
Disability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs Subcommittee. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, as a moth-
er myself, I rise today in support of the 
Lactation Spaces for Veteran Moms 
Act, a bipartisan bill that would ensure 
every medical facility managed by the 
Department of Veterans Affairs con-
tains a lactation space. 
Representative 
JAIME
HERRERA 
BEUTLER joined me in introducing this 
bill in 2021, and I thank her for her 
leadership on this issue. This is an 
issue where Congress has worked to-
gether in a bipartisan manner, and we 
know that more work like this needs to 
be done. 
In 
2019, 
the 
Fairness 
for 
Breastfeeding Mothers Act was signed 
into law. That legislation required pub-
lic buildings containing public rest-
rooms to also provide a hygienic space, 
other than a restroom, for mothers to 
express milk, not only for employees, 
but for members of the public as well. 
Today, there are 90 VA facilities 
across the country with designated 
nursing rooms, but today these spaces 
are for employees of the VA only, not 
veteran mothers as well. 
The bipartisan Lactation Spaces for 
Veteran Moms Act expands access to 
clean, safe, and convenient lactation 
spaces for all VA medical facilities 
throughout the country for women who 
have served our Nation and our mili-
tary families. 
My legislation requires the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs to ensure that 
every medical facility managed by the 
VA contains a lactation space which is 
a hygienic place, other than a rest-
room, is shielded from view, is acces-
sible to disabled individuals as well, 
contains a chair and a working surface, 
and is available for use by female vet-
erans, employees of the Department, 
and members of the public. 
Congress must do more to support 
our veteran mothers and the Lactation 
Spaces for Veteran Moms Act will im-
prove the quality of life for many of 
the women who have served our Nation 
and our military families, while they 
are accessing VA facilities. 
I am grateful for the overwhelming 
support from my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle for this important 
issue, and I advise my colleagues to ad-
vance this legislation favorably and en-
sure that the resources are available 
for every woman who visits VA facili-
ties. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
my colleagues to join me in passing 
this very important legislation, H.R. 
5738, as amended, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5738, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each

from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
7335. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 7335, 
the MST Claims Coordination Act, in-
troduced by Chairwoman LURIA. Infor-
mation is power, but access to informa-
tion is empowering. 
Given the traumatic nature of mili-
tary sexual trauma, equipping veterans 
with 
information 
about 
the 
MST 
claims process may help to ease the ap-
prehension that may be associated 
with pursuing MST claims. 
The outreach materials mandated by 
this legislation will provide MST sur-
vivors a variety of resources on how to 
pursue and file claims; identify mental 
health resources for treatment; and 
contact information for the Veterans 
Crisis Line, should the need arise. 
By improving the notification mech-
anisms between the Veterans Health 
Administration and the Veterans Ben-
efit Administration, veteran survivors 
of MST will benefit from claims coordi-
nation between the administrations, 
which will hopefully lead to a more 
streamlined MST claims process and 
accelerated 
compensation 
decisions, 
and will avoid the complications that 
often lead to frustration among sur-
vivors. 
I thank Chair LURIA for offering this 
legislation, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7335, the MST Claims Coordina-
tion Act. This bill requires VBA to pro-
vide claimants with outreach materials 
on VHA services for military sexual 
trauma survivors during the benefits 
claim process. 
Additionally, this legislation will 
allow the veterans to opt into a re-
quirement that the VBA notify VHA 
when the veteran receives a disability 
exam or board hearing for a claim re-
lated to MST. This will allow the VHA 
to be better informed about the events 
in the claims process that may cause 
distress to the MST survivor in order 
to improve their care. 
Veteran 
claimants 
have 
reported 
that they are unaware of the services 
VHA provides to assist veterans who 
experienced MST, regardless of their 
service-connected disability status. 
It is critical that VA improves co-
ordination between VHA and VBA to 
better support survivors of MST. 
I appreciate Congresswoman LURIA, 
the Chairwoman of the Disability As-
sistance and Memorial Affairs Sub-
committee, for introducing this bill, 
and I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Mrs. LURIA), my good friend, au-
thor of H.R. 7335, and the chair of the 
Disability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs Subcommittee. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the survivors of 
military sexual trauma, or MST, who 
struggle to access the medical care, 
mental health services, and the com-
pensation that they deserve. 
Sexual assault in the military con-
tinues to be a pervasive issue. These 
assaults are often unreported and can 
culminate in post-traumatic stress dis-
order, depression, and even suicide. 
When a veteran has the courage to 
report the impact of that trauma to 
the VA, it is essential that we treat 
these claims with the utmost empathy, 
compassion, and concern. 
For many veterans, submitting the 
claim means opening themselves up. 
For those who have not filed a report 
while in the military, this is the first 
opportunity for their experience to be 
acknowledged. And far too often, MST 
survivors encounter bureaucratic proc-
esses when filing their claims through 
the VA, which can be re-traumatizing, 
and further delays access to critical 
healthcare and mental healthcare serv-
ices. 
b 1245 
My bill is one in a series of bills 
drafted to improve the veteran’s expe-
rience during the MST claims process. 
It would require the VA to provide 
guidance to help veterans understand 
what mental health resources and 
other supports are in place and avail-
able to support them as they go 
through the claims process. 
By ensuring veterans who file an 
MST-related claim are given informa-
tion on the Veterans Crisis Line, how 
to make appointments with mental 
healthcare providers, and connect them 
with VHA MST coordinators, we em-
power veterans to access the network 
of trauma-informed care that the VHA 
provides. 
For veterans who already have access 
to the VHA system of care, my bill 
would, with the veteran’s consent, 
allow for relevant healthcare providers

May 18, 2022 
to be notified when a veteran in their 
care has filed an MST claim, has an ex-
amination related to the MST claim, 
or been notified of a decision or a de-
termination. This notification can be 
especially helpful when a claim has 
been denied or the decision is lower 
than the veteran feels is warranted. 
We must ensure that survivors of sex-
ual assault and sexual harassment in 
the military are treated respectfully 
and receive proper care at all stages of 
the 
process, 
including 
mental 
healthcare services. 
It is especially critical in light of the 
August 2021 VA Office of Inspector Gen-
eral report which showed that claims 
were still being inappropriately denied. 
Thus, ‘‘veteran survivors of military 
sexual trauma remain at risk of not re-
ceiving the VA benefits to which they 
are entitled and experiencing addi-
tional distress when claims are improp-
erly handled or denied.’’ 
That is why I introduced the MST 
Claims Coordinator Act, to improve 
communication and coordination in 
the claims process between the Vet-
erans Benefits Administration and the 
Veterans Health Administration. 
As a 20-year Navy veteran, I am 
proud to have worked with my col-
leagues in a bipartisan fashion to in-
troduce this legislation, and I urge my 
colleagues to support its final passage. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I truly

woman LURIA. I ask all of my col-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6961, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 6961, as amended, the Dignity 
for MST Survivors Act, introduced by 
Representative MRVAN. 
The importance of caring for vet-
erans who have experienced military 
sexual trauma cannot be overstated. 
By virtue of the bill’s name, Represent-
ative MRVAN seeks to ensure that MST 
survivors are given the respect and 
honor they deserve. 
Words have meaning and power, and 
how we discuss MST can be retrauma-
tizing for survivors. Careful thought 
must be given to the way in which the 
VA communicates with veterans who 
have MST claims. This bill takes great

care to address the language included 
in claims denial letters so veterans are 
not retraumatized when receiving what 
may be troubling news. This legislation 
requires the VA to consult with stake-
holders to identify the appropriate lan-
guage to include in these letters. 
Additionally, the Board of Veterans’ 
Appeals does significant work, includ-
ing the processing of appeals for MST. 
Given the extremely sensitive nature 
of these claims, board members must 
be adequately trained to review these 
cases. Therefore, this legislation in-
cludes an annual training element and 
requires that if board members do not 
meet this annual training requirement, 
they will not be assigned MST cases. 
As has been noted in other MST-re-
lated bills, the training and develop-
ment of contract medical providers is 
essential to conducting MST com-
pensation exams. 
This bill will require these medical 
providers to use the most up-to-date, 
trauma-informed protocols while work-
ing with veterans seeking MST claims. 
While it is my understanding that 
most MST claim exams are being 
outsourced to contract providers, I ap-
preciate the changes to the introduced 
text that will require the same train-
ing for contract providers and in-house 
VA providers. 
As such, I supported the amendment 
by Ranking Member BOST to clarify 
this issue during committee consider-
ation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this vital legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6961, the Dignity for MST Sur-
vivors Act, which was introduced by 
Congressman MRVAN, the chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Technology Mod-
ernization. 
All veterans should receive an accu-
rate decision the first time they file a 
claim, especially if the claim is related 
to MST. If the VA must deny that 
claim, this should be communicated in 
a compassionate manner. 
Moreover, the VA disability exam-
iners should be sensitive to the needs 
of our veterans who are undergoing an 
exam for a condition related to MST. 
This bill would make several im-
provements to the MST claims process, 
including enhancing training on MST 
for adjudicators at the Board of Vet-
erans’ Appeals; improving decision no-
tices for claims related to MST; and, 
requiring the VA to establish standards 
to ensure that disability examiners 
perform exams related to MST using 
trauma-informed practices. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. MRVAN), my good friend and au-
thor of this legislation, who serves as 
the chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Technology Modernization on the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to rise in support of the Dignity 
for MST Survivors Act, legislation I 
was proud to introduce and collaborate 
with Chairman TAKANO, Chairwoman 
LURIA, and my other colleagues to ad-
dress longstanding issues regarding the 
treatment of survivors of military sex-
ual trauma. 
I also thank the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of Amer-
ica, The American Legion, and the 
Wounded Warrior Project for their en-
dorsements of this legislation. 
The Dignity for MST Survivors Act 
seeks to support and affirm veterans 
who experienced sexual trauma during 
their military service as they navigate 
the Board of Veterans’ Appeals claims 
appeal process. 
According to the data collected by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, an 
unconscionable 1 in 3 of our brave 
women veterans and 1 in 50 male vet-
erans report having experienced sexual 
assault or sexual harassment. 
Such traumatic events often have 
lasting impacts on these individuals’ 
physical and mental health, placing 
MST survivors at heightened risk for 
depression, post-traumatic stress dis-
order, and other debilitating condi-
tions. 
Despite these clear treatment needs, 
many MST survivors face significant 
difficulty in accessing healthcare and 
disability benefits from the VA. 
In August 2021, an investigation re-
leased by the VA’s Office of the Inspec-
tor General found that an astounding 
57 percent of denied MST claims were 
improperly processed by the VA, in 
part due to claims processors’ lack of 
MST training. 
Multiple veterans service organiza-
tions report that the BVA has proven 
similarly ill-equipped to deal with ap-
peals of denied MST claims and that 
the current claims appeal process has 
the unfortunate potential to retrauma-
tize MST survivors. 
While the VA has taken steps in the 
right direction, more must be done to 
improve the claims appeal experience, 
show compassion, and safeguard the 
dignity of MST survivors. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation in order to ensure MST sur-
vivors are not retraumatized at any 
point in their effort to obtain the 
world-class healthcare and disability 
benefits to which they are entitled. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 6961, as amended, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6961, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6064. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 6064, introduced by Representa-
tive NEHLS. 
Given the unfortunate prevalence of 
military sexual trauma among vet-
erans and the broad and long-lasting 
impacts it can have on a survivor, it 
makes sense to have a neutral research 
party assess the adequacy of compensa-
tion examinations conducted by VA ex-
aminers to ensure we are fully address-
ing the needs of our veterans who have 
experienced military sexual trauma. 
The sensitive nature of MST evalua-
tions requires competent and compas-
sionate care. Having a better under-
standing of the academic preparation 
and credentialing of medical and men-
tal health practitioners will allow the 
VA to adjust and amend existing policy 
to provide more appropriate compensa-
tion examinations. 
The National Academies of Science 
provides independent and objective re-
search that informs public policy. To 
that end, an empirical review of the 
practitioner training associated with 
MST compensation examinations will 
strengthen stakeholder confidence in 
the overall process, improve customer 
service, and enhance claim decisions to 
benefit veterans who experienced MST. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Mem-
ber NEHLS for offering this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to support it, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6064, and I thank Congressman 
NEHLS, Congresswoman LURIA, and the 
leaders of the Subcommittee on Dis-
ability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs, for introducing this bill. 
This bill would require the VA to 
partner with the National Academies 
to conduct an independent review of 
the VA’s delivery of benefits for claims 
related to MST. 
The National Academies would also 
provide recommendations that the VA 
could implement to improve the dis-
ability claims process for MST sur-
vivors. 
b 1300 
For decades, the National Academies 
has led research into the VA disability 
benefits process, including reports on 
the health effects of toxic exposures 
and VA’s handling of traumatic brain 
injury claims. 
This study is needed to help Congress 
and 
VA 
better 
understand 
what 
changes need to be made in this process 
to ensure that veterans receive quality, 
timely, and compassionate consider-
ation of their disability claims. 
For too long, we have heard that the 
MST claims process can be insensitive. 
This is unacceptable, and VA must do 
better. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 6064, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

NETTA). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO) that the House

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
2724, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 2724, as amended, the VA Peer 
Support Enhancement for MST Sur-
vivors Act, introduced by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. DELGADO). 
VA has provided peer support special-
ists for recently discharged veterans 
transitioning to civilian life, veterans 
with mental health or substance abuse 
issues, and caregivers of veterans. 
Peer support programs have proven 
successful for these communities and 
may prove to be a beneficial tool dur-
ing the claims process for survivors of 
military sexual trauma. Victim advo-
cacy can serve as a bridge between sur-
vivors and the Veterans Benefits Ad-
ministration adjudicators processing 
their cases. 
Within the MST context, a highly 
trained peer support specialist can 
serve as an advocate who can provide 
counsel, assistance, and coordination 
to navigate a process that may be 
stress-inducing and anxiety-provoking. 
If the MST claimant chooses to uti-
lize the services of a peer support spe-
cialist, the MST claims experience may 
go more smoothly and potentially re-
duce the emotional strain on an inher-
ently difficult process. 
This bill was amended in committee 
with thoughtful input from Ranking 
Member BOST, who sought to clarify 
that the role of the peer support spe-
cialist in assisting an MST claimant is 
to act as a shepherd for the MST claim-
ant rather than a surrogate who speaks 
on behalf of a claimant during pro-
ceedings. As such, a peer support spe-
cialist can provide guidance, support, 
and counseling and help claimants 
navigate a difficult and potentially re-
traumatizing process. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2724, the VA Peer Support En-
hancement for MST Survivors Act, 
which is sponsored by the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. DELGADO). 
Veterans who file disability claims 
based on MST report that the process 
can be difficult and emotional. Peer 
support specialists can help these vet-
erans through this stressful time. Peer 
support specialists provide critical help 
to veterans. 
Unfortunately, many veterans who 
file a claim for conditions based on 
MST may not be aware of, or eligible 
for, VHA peer support services. This 
bill would better ensure that these 
claimants are eligible for peer support 
services or are connected with an MST 
coordinator at VHA. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 2724, as amended, and maybe, 
hopefully, the gentleman from Mon-
tana will allow this to go on a voice 
vote. I thought I would just mention 
that. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 4089. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
4089, the Veterans Rapid Retraining 
Assistance Program Restoration and 
Recovery Act. 
This legislation was introduced by 
Senator DURBIN and passed by unani-
mous consent in the Senate. I also 
thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
DANNY K. DAVIS) for introducing this 
legislation in the House. 
Mr. Speaker, during the most dif-
ficult period of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, Congress and President Biden 
worked together to pass the American 
Rescue Plan into law, one of the most 
significant investments in American 
workers and the American economy 
since the New Deal. 
The Veteran Rapid Retraining As-
sistance Program, which was included 
in the American Rescue Plan, created a 
new program to retrain and employ un-
employed veterans. 
Since passage, over 5,000 veterans 
have used this program, many to great

success. However, not every veteran 
has had the same experience. Some 
have been subject to school closures, 
which risk robbing them of this one- 
time benefit. For example, in Illinois, 
more than 300 veterans were scammed 
by a for-profit school that took their 
money and abruptly closed its doors. 
This legislation restores these edu-
cation benefits to veterans defrauded 
by schools and gives these veterans a 
second chance to gain new skills in a 
booming labor market. 
I thank the Senate for getting this 
bill to us so quickly and Senator DUR-
BIN and Congressman DANNY K. DAVIS 
for their leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this important legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
4089, the Veterans Rapid Retraining 
Assistance Program Restoration and 
Recovery Act. 
One of the few positive provisions 
that was enacted as part of the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan was the creation of 
the Veteran Rapid Retraining Assist-
ance Program, or VRRAP. This pro-
gram authorizes 1 year of GI Bill-style 
education benefits for training for an 
in-demand occupation for unemployed 
veterans. 
VRRAP was originally authored dur-
ing the peak of COVID veteran unem-
ployment by our former colleague Dr. 
Phil Roe and Congressman LEVIN. I was 
pleased to introduce the bill this year 
and was glad that it was made part of 
the American Rescue Plan. 
Under this program, eligible veterans 
only have one chance to participate in 
VRRAP. This became a problem for 
hundreds of students at Future Tech 
Career Institute in Chicago when the 
training provider lost their ability to 
administer GI Bill benefits earlier this 
year. 
If those students had been using a 
traditional 
GI 
Bill 
program, 
they 
would be eligible to have their benefits 
restored to continue their studies at 
another school. However, with VRRAP, 
that was not possible. 
This bill will fix that issue, author-
izing VRRAP users to have another 
chance to use the program if their 
school closes or loses GI Bill approval 
in the middle of the semester. 
While I am very supportive of the 
policy in this bill, I do have concerns 
about the cost. The Congressional 
Budget Office has estimated the cost of 
this bill to be at $6 million in manda-
tory costs over 10 years. 
For whatever reason, the Senate 
chose not to offset these costs before 
passing this bill. This decision is, un-
fortunately, not surprising, as we have 
seen repeatedly that the Democrat ma-
jority in both the House and the Sen-
ate loves to ignore costs and increase 
spending. 
Their overstimulation of the econ-
omy has led to soaring inflation and 
staggering price increases that Ameri-
cans see every day. We must stop mort-
gaging 
our 
children’s 
and 
grand-
children’s futures. Our current level of 
spending is simply not sustainable. 
That being said, I am not going to 
stand in the way of providing restored 
benefits to unemployed veterans who 
need our help in this struggling econ-
omy. That is why I am going to reluc-
tantly support the passage of this bill 
today. However, I caution my friends 
that this practice of un-offset spending 
must end. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), my good friend 
who serves as a subcommittee chair on 
the Ways and Means Committee and is 
a member of the Oversight and Reform 
Committee. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 
Veterans Rapid Retraining Assistance 
Program Restoration and Recovery 
Act. I introduced this bill with Senator 
DURBIN and Representative UNDERWOOD 
to ensure veterans receive the rapid re-
training benefits they earned. 
I thank Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
Chairman TAKANO and Subcommittee 
on Economic Opportunity Chairman 
LEVIN for their leadership in advancing 
this bill quickly to meet the urgent 
need of affected veterans. 
I also thank the multiple veterans’ 
advocates for their support for swift 
passage to assist affected students. 
Veterans serving our country with 
honor have earned their rapid retrain-
ing assistance education benefits. The 
American 
Rescue 
Plan 
established 
these benefits, known as VRRAP, to 
help veterans gain new skills to meet 
the changing workforce demands dur-
ing the pandemic. 
b 1315 
Unfortunately, the Veterans Admin-
istration lacks the authority to restore 
benefits to veterans who attended in-
stitutions that closed or experienced a 
disapproval of educational program-
ming. 
This legislation emerged from case-
work in Illinois, where more than 300 
Illinois veterans were scammed out of 
their benefits by an unaccredited for- 
profit institute. 
I am indeed proud to work with Sen-
ator 
DURBIN
and 
Representative 
UNDERWOOD to restore these benefits to 
these Illinois veterans and protect any 
other 
veteran 
in 
similar 
cir-
cumstances. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
legislation. I urge my colleagues to 
support it, and I thank the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs for bringing it to 
us so quickly. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to join me in passing this important 
legislation. I remind my colleagues 
that it was sent to us by the Senate by 
unanimous consent, and we can express 
that same sense of unanimity by allow-
ing this bill to pass on suspension by 
voice vote. The Senate has indicated 
unanimity. As my colleagues well 
know, to even get to the floor requires 
a 60-vote super majority. 
Mr. Speaker, I would say to my 
friend from Montana, the Big Sky 
State, have a big heart as well as be 
from the Big Sky State. To my col-
league, the ranking member, I take to 
heart your consternation over a $6 mil-
lion non-offsetted cost, but I will re-
mind you of a $2 trillion tax cut which 
was not offset. 
So we will wring our hands over $6 
million for our veterans but yet, look 
the other way when $2.9 trillion is 
blithely moved through this Chamber 
with nary a hearing. I plead to a big 
heart in this institution that we may 
get through these votes quickly. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support S. 4089, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 4089. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
6052. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6052, the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs Office of Inspector General Train-
ing Act of 2021. 
The VA’s Office of Inspector General 
performs important oversight and in-
vestigations into a broad range of pro-
grams and spending by the Depart-
ment. 
Its work informs our committee’s 
own oversight and has often formed the 
basis of our legislation. However, the 
Office of Inspector General relies on 
VA employees as a key source of infor-
mation. 
The better employees are at commu-
nicating with the OIG, the more effec-
tive the OIG is in carrying out over-
sight. That is why this bipartisan legis-
lation introduced by Representatives 
UNDERWOOD and MCKINLEY is so impor-
tant. 
Their bill requires all VA employees 
to undergo training developed by the 
OIG relating to reporting wrongdoing, 
responding to OIG requests, and co-
operating with OIG investigations. 
This legislation is supported by The 
American Legion and Veterans of For-
eign Wars, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6052, which requires VA em-
ployees to receive training on the work 
that the VA inspector general does. 
This training will help VA employees 
understand how to recognize and report 
instances of waste, fraud, and abuse, as 
well as their responsibility to comply 
with the investigations. 
VA’s budget request for fiscal year 
2023 is over $300 billion. Oversight of 
this Department’s massive budget is a 
major priority of mine. This common-
sense bill would lead to better over-
sight by informing all VA employees of 
their responsibility to identify and re-
port fraud, waste, and abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. UNDERWOOD), the brilliant 
gentlewoman, my good friend, and au-
thor of H.R. 6052. She serves on the 
Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on 
Health. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 6052, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector 
General Training Act of 2021. 
The bipartisan VA OIG training act, 
which I introduced with Congressman 
DAVID MCKINLEY of West Virginia last 
fall, is a critical step to promote ac-
countability at VA and ensure our vet-
erans are receiving the world-class care 
and benefits that they have earned. 
This bill requires every current and 
future VA employee to participate in 
the VA’s OIG training, which will en-
sure that staff are prepared to report 
fraud, waste, and patient abuse, and 
are aware of protections for employees 
who report wrongdoings. 
An assessment of initiatives carried 
out by VA’s OIG found that every dol-
lar spent on oversight yielded a $21 re-
turn on investment. Ensuring the OIG 
can carry out its crucial oversight 
work will save taxpayer dollars, while 
also improving care and ensuring that 
veterans receive every dollar and ben-
efit that they have earned. 
My 
commonsense, 
bipartisan 
bill 
codifies OIG’s training requirement, 
which strengthens the Department’s 
Office of the Inspector General, pro-
tects VA employees who report wrong-
doing, and most importantly, honors 
the service and sacrifices of our vet-
erans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to vote for the 
Department of Veterans Affairs Office 
of Inspector General Training Act 
today. I thank Chairman TAKANO and 
Ranking Member BOST for their sup-
port to advance this legislation. 
I also thank Representative MCKIN-
LEY for co-leading the bill with me in 
the House, and Senators HASSAN and 
BOOZMAN
for leading this bipartisan 
bill in the Senate. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 6052, the Department of Veterans 
Affairs Office of Inspector General 
Training Act, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

SEC. 202. REPORT BY DEPARTMENT OF VET-
ERANS AFFAIRS AND DEPARTMENT

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 2533. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 2533, Making Advances in Mam-
mography and Medical Options for Vet-
erans Act, or MAMMO Act, introduced 
by Senator TESTER. 
This bill vastly improves the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs’ mammog-
raphy services by updating policies and 
directives to ensure VA is not only fol-
lowing best practices, but also using 
the most advanced medical, diagnostic 
equipment and testing to aid in early 
detection and prevention of breast can-
cer. 
Mr. Speaker, timeliness matters. By 
ensuring VA is using the best practices 
and most up-to-date technologies, we 
will help decrease the risk that women 
veterans—a group that is nearly twice 
as likely to develop breast cancer than 
their 
civilian 
counterparts—are 
misdiagnosed, 
or 
undiagnosed, 
for 
breast cancer. 
Access to reliable mammograms at 
VA facilities is imperative in order to 
detect tumors years prior to physical 
touch detection. A veteran that re-
ceives an early diagnosis will have 
stronger treatment options and an in-
creased likelihood of survival. 
It is important to note that women 
are not the only veterans susceptible 
to breast cancer, men are increasingly 
at risk, too. This bill addresses the 
needs of male veterans who may re-
quire prompt breast cancer screening 
services. 
In addition, this legislation calls on 
VA to collaborate with other Federal 
partners, such as the Department of 
Defense and the National Cancer Insti-
tute to enhance research and care for 
women veterans suffering from breast 
cancer. 
The MAMMO Act has broad bipar-
tisan support, and I thank Chairwoman 
BROWNLEY for her steadfast leadership 
on this issue and for introducing the 
House companion of this legislation 
with Dr. MILLER-MEEKS. 
Additionally, numerous veteran serv-
ice organizations, such as Iraq and Af-
ghanistan

Wounded Warrior Project, and The 
American Legion have voiced robust 
support for this legislation. 
We cannot wait any longer to pass 
this critical piece of legislation. The 
MAMMO Act is essential for VA to pro-
vide high-quality, lifesaving care that 
veterans have not only earned but de-
serve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of 
this important piece of legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
2533, the MAMMO for Veterans Act. 
This bill requires VA to develop a plan 
to improve breast imaging services. It 
also establishes a breast imaging tele-
health pilot program to better serve 
women veterans in areas where VA 
does not have significant capacity, in-
cluding rural areas. 
It also requires VA to upgrade breast 
imaging services at the VA facilities 
by using three-dimensional imaging 
and provide updated guidelines and ge-
netic counseling for veterans diagnosed 
with breast cancer. Early detection is 
the key to fighting all forms of cancer, 
to include breast cancer. 
VA should make every effort to en-
sure veterans with breast cancer re-
ceive cutting-edge care, both in screen-
ing and treatment. 
I appreciate Senator TESTER and my 
friend and fellow veteran, Congress-
woman MILLER-MEEKS, for their work 
on this important bill. It has my full 
support. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS), my good friend. 
b 1330 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Ranking Member BOST
for 
yielding me time to speak. 
I rise today to express my support for 
S. 2533, the Making Advances in Mam-
mography and Medical Options for Vet-
erans Act. I am proud to co-lead the 
House companion of this important 
legislation 
with 
Congresswoman 
BROWNLEY. 
I 
also 
thank 
Senators 
TESTER and BOOZMAN for their work in 
passing this bill. 
As a doctor and as a 24-year female 
veteran, I understand just how signifi-
cant access to mammogram screenings 
can be. The VA has estimated that 
among the women enrolled in VA 
healthcare, about 700 female veterans 
are diagnosed with breast cancer each 
year, and the percentage of female vet-
erans is only going to increase. 
This bill will ensure that female vet-
erans have the best access to high- 
quality care, especially for female vet-
erans that live in rural areas who are 
disabled and who are paralyzed. This 
bill will also create a 3-year pilot pro-
gram to provide telemammography 
screenings to female veterans and will 
upgrade the VA mammography imag-
ing to three-dimensional breast imag-
ing for VA hospitals. In addition, this 
bill will expand partnerships for care, 
research, and clinical trials with the 
NIH National Cancer Institute and the 
DOD. 
Today, as a doctor and a former di-
rector of public health, I am proudly 
voting in support of the bipartisan and 
bicameral MAMMO for Veterans Act. 
This bill will enhance mammography 
and telemammography screenings, and 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote in 
favor of S. 2533, Making Advances in 
Mammography and Medical Options for 
Veterans Act. I look forward to a 
strong bipartisan vote today and send-
ing this bill to the President to become 
law. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all of my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
my colleagues to join me in passing S. 
2533. In the last vote, the gentleman 
from Montana went out of my line of 
sight, and I thought we were going to 
pass this on suspension. I plead with 
him, let MAMMO go, let MAMMO pass 
on voice. By allowing us to pass it on 
voice, everybody says ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 2533. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, parliamen-
tary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, what is the 
rule for having a vote not be done by 
voice vote but have to go to the floor 
for a recorded vote? Is it not a major-
ity of the group necessary to have a 
hearing? The majority of a quorum, it 
is 20 percent of the quorum, I believe. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Once 
again, the gentleman will please state 
his parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, my under-
standing is the rules require 20 percent 
of a quorum to be present to request 
and have a vote be done by the yeas 
and nays. Is that not accurate? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are considered as 
ordered upon any demand for the yeas 
and nays. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, on de-
mand?

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion are postponed.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-

from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 2102. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 2102, the Dr. Kate Hendricks 
Thomas Supporting Expanded Review 
for Veterans in Combat Environments 
Act, or SERVICE Act, introduced by 
Senator BOOZMAN. 
I applaud Dr. MILLER-MEEKS
and 
Chairwoman BROWNLEY for their initia-
tive on this urgent issue and for intro-
ducing the House companion. 
The purpose of this bill is to ensure 
that any veteran who was deployed in 
support of a contingency operation in 
specified locations during defined peri-
ods is eligible for a mammography 
screening by a VA healthcare provider. 
The specified locations are theaters of 
operations where burn pits are cur-
rently—or were previously—being used. 
This bill also requires inclusion of 
other locations and time periods as de-
termined by the Airborne Hazards and 
Open Burn Pit Registry. 
Additionally, the SERVICE Act re-
quires a report that compares breast 
cancer rates for veterans deployed to 
the specified locations, comparing data 
to other members of the Armed Forces 
who were not deployed during that pe-
riod, and to the civilian population. 
Many of us here today were lucky 
enough to have had the honor of meet-
ing Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas; a 
fierce advocate, loving wife and moth-
er, and an exemplary Marine Corps vet-
eran, who served near a burn pit in 
Fallujah. Kate passed away last month 
after battling stage IV breast cancer. 
She gave her last days to her fellow 
veterans, fighting for the passage of 
comprehensive toxic exposure legisla-
tion that would provide potentially 
lifesaving care crucial for similarly ex-
posed veterans. 
While I support this important and 
timely legislation, I also stress the ur-
gency of passing the Honoring our 
PACT Act. It is time for our country to 
make good on its promise to toxic-ex-
posed veterans. 
It is up to us, Members of Congress, 
to fight for our Nation’s veterans as 
they have fought for us. Our Nation’s 
veterans do not have time to wait. 
I support S. 2102, and I ask my col-
leagues to do the same. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
2102, the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas 
Supporting Expanded Review for Vet-
erans 
in 
Combat 
Environment, 
or 
SERVICE Act. 
Dr. Thomas was a marine—oorah— 
veteran and a public health profes-
sional, who was diagnosed with stage 
IV breast cancer following her deploy-
ment to Iraq. 
She was just 38 years old when she 
was diagnosed. She was just 42 years 
old when she died of breast cancer on 
April 5 of this year. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
her family and loved ones. 
Dr. Thomas’ passing is a tragic re-
minder of how high the stakes are 
when it comes to better serving vet-
erans suffering from toxic exposure. 
Both VA and DOD have conducted 
studies that indicate that women who 
have served in the military have an 
elevated risk for breast cancer. 
The bill that bears Dr. Thomas’ name 
would help more toxic-exposed vet-
erans like her have access to breast im-
aging services from the VA, regardless 
of their enrollment status. 
The bill is sponsored by Senator 
BOOZMAN of Arkansas, and I thank him 
for his work on this legislation. I also 
thank Congresswoman MILLER-MEEKS, 
the House sponsor, who has been a 
strong champion for it as well. Dr. MIL-
LER-MEEKS is a veteran herself, and 
women veterans have no better advo-
cate than she. 
I am proud to support the bill today, 
and I hope that all of my colleagues 
will join me. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS). 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Ranking Member BOST
for 
yielding me time to speak. 
I rise today to express my support for 
S. 2102, the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas 
SERVICE Act. I was proud to introduce 
the House companion of this important 
bipartisan piece of legislation with 
Congresswoman BROWNLEY. I thank 
Senators BOOZMAN and WYDEN for their 
work in passing this bill. 
The importance of this bill is that 
the United States Preventative Health 
Service indicates mammography at an 
annual level after age 40, and our vet-
erans who have risked their lives and 
their health in service to our country 
are exposed to toxins and burn pits and 
need treatment and screening to pre-
vent long-term health issues and at an 
earlier time period. Female veterans 
are especially at risk for several types 
of cancer, especially breast cancer. Fe-
male veterans are at a 20 to 40 percent 
higher risk of breast cancer, and fe-
male veterans who have been exposed 
to toxic exposure are at an even higher 
risk. 
As a doctor, I understand just how 
lifesaving 
early 
mammogram 
screenings can be. I have always told 
my patients that early detection is the 
key to successfully treating all types 
of cancer. This bill will allow for an 
earlier mammography screening for fe-
male veterans who served in locations 
with toxic exposure. 
This bill is in honor of Dr. and Ma-
rine Corps veteran Kate Hendricks 
Thomas, 
who 
unfortunately 
passed 
away in April due to stage IV breast

lier mammography screenings for fe-
male veterans that were exposed to 
toxic exposure. 
The bipartisan and bicameral SERV-
ICE Act will give female veterans ac-
cess to more screenings to stay ahead 
of this terrible disease. Today, as a 24- 
year Army veteran, I am proudly vot-
ing in support of this bill to protect 
and save the lives of our female vet-
erans. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in voting in favor of S. 2102, the Dr. 
Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE Act. 
I look forward to a strong bipartisan 
vote today and sending this bill to the 
President to become law. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of

Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, as we have 
noticed today, this bill and other bills 
deal specifically with the promise we 
have made, I have made, and I know 
that Chairman TAKANO
as well has 
made, to try to make things better for 
our women veterans. We also had the 
bills that dealt with the sexual trauma. 
These are issues that are vitally impor-
tant. I appreciate what we have worked 
on today. We want to make sure that 
we provide for those needs. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this piece of legisla-
tion along with all the others that we 
have moved today, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in passing this 
important piece of legislation, the Dr. 
Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE Act. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support

TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND 
POST-TRAUMATIC 
STRESS 
DIS-
ORDER 
LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
TRAINING ACT 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2992), to direct the Attorney Gen-
eral to develop crisis intervention 
training tools for use by first respond-
ers related to interacting with persons 
who have a traumatic brain injury, an-
other form of acquired brain injury, or 
post-traumatic stress disorder, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2992 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Traumatic 
Brain Injury and Post-Traumatic Stress Dis-
order Law Enforcement Training Act’’ or the 
‘‘TBI and PTSD Law Enforcement Training 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, there were approxi-
mately 2.9 million traumatic brain injury-re-
lated emergency department visits, hos-
pitalizations, and deaths in the United 
States in 2014. 
(2) Effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
can be short-term or long-term, and include 
impaired thinking or memory, movement, 
vision or hearing, or emotional functioning, 
such as personality changes or depression. 
(3) Currently, between 3.2 million and 5.3 
million persons are living with a TBI-related 
disability in the United States. 
(4) About 7 or 8 percent of Americans will 
experience post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) at some point in their lives, and 
about 8 million adults have PTSD during the 
course of a given year. 
(5) TBI and PTSD have been recognized as 
the signature injuries of the Wars in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. 
(6) According to the Department of De-
fense, 383,000 men and women deployed to 
Iraq and Afghanistan sustained a brain in-
jury while in the line of duty between 2000 
and 2018. 
(7) Approximately 13.5 percent of Oper-
ations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom 
veterans screen positive for PTSD, according 
to the Department of Veteran Affairs. 
(8) About 12 percent of Gulf War Veterans 
have PTSD in a given year while about 30 
percent of Vietnam Veterans have had PTSD 
in their lifetime. 
(9) Physical signs of TBI can include motor 
impairment, 
dizziness 
or 
poor 
balance, 
slurred speech, impaired depth perception, or 
impaired verbal memory, while physical 
signs of PTSD can include agitation, irrita-
bility, hostility, hypervigilance, self-destruc-
tive behavior, fear, severe anxiety, or mis-
trust. 
(10) Physical signs of TBI and PTSD often 
overlap with physical signs of alcohol or 
drug impairment, which complicate a first 
responder’s ability to quickly and effectively 
identify an individual’s condition. 
SEC. 3. CREATION OF A TBI AND PTSD TRAINING 
FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. 
Part HH of title I of the Omnibus Crime 
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 
U.S.C. 10651 et seq.) is amended— 
(1) in section 2991— 
(A) in subsection (h)(1)(A), by inserting be-
fore the period at the end the following: ‘‘, 
including the training developed under sec-
tion 2993’’; and 
(B) in subsection (o), by amending para-
graph (1) to read as follows: 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—There is authorized to be 
appropriated to the Department of Justice to 
carry out this section $54,000,000 for each of 
fiscal years 2023 through 2027.’’; and 
(2) by inserting after section 2992 the fol-
lowing new section: 
‘‘SEC. 2993. CREATION OF A TBI AND PTSD TRAIN-
ING FOR FIRST RESPONDERS. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than one year 
after the date of the enactment of this sec-
tion, the Attorney General, acting through

practices regarding techniques to interact 
with persons who have a traumatic brain in-
jury, an acquired brain injury, or post-trau-
matic stress disorder from first responder, 
brain injury, veteran, and mental health or-
ganizations, health care and mental health 
providers, hospital emergency departments, 
and other relevant stakeholders, and shall 
develop crisis intervention training tools for 
use by first responders (as such term is de-
fined in section 3025) that provide— 
‘‘(1) information on the conditions and 
symptoms of a traumatic brain injury, an ac-
quired brain injury, and post-traumatic 
stress disorder; 
‘‘(2) techniques to interact with persons 
who have a traumatic brain injury, an ac-
quired brain injury, or post-traumatic stress 
disorder; and 
‘‘(3) information on how to recognize per-
sons who have a traumatic brain injury, an 
acquired brain injury, or post-traumatic

‘‘(b) USE OF TRAINING TOOLS AT LAW EN-
FORCEMENT
MENTAL
HEALTH
LEARNING 
SITES.—The Attorney General shall ensure 
that not less than one Law Enforcement 
Mental Health Learning Site designated by 
the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assist-
ance uses the training tools developed under

Not later than 24 months after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services, acting through 
the Director of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention and the Director of the 
National Institutes of Health and in con-
sultation with the Secretary of Defense and 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, shall con-
duct a study and submit to the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
Representatives 
and 
the 
Committee 
on 
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of 
the Senate a report on the prevalence and in-
cidence of concussion among first responders 
(as such term is defined in section 3025 of the 
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act 
of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10705)). The report shall in-
clude data on the incidence of concussion 
among first responders and recommenda-
tions for resources for first responders who 
have experienced traumatic brain injury. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each

Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 2992. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Tennessee?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5118 
May 18, 2022 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2992, the TBI and 
PTSD Law Enforcement Training Act, 
is bipartisan legislation that would re-
quire the Department of Justice to de-
velop crisis intervention training tools 
for law enforcement training agencies 
so that they can better equip officers 
to respond to individuals with trau-
matic brain injuries and post-trau-
matic stress disorder. 
This is important for the training of 
law enforcement officials. When I was 
out of law school, my first job as attor-
ney for the police in Memphis, and for 
31⁄2 years I taught the police in the 
training academy. This was not part of 
our training, and it should have been. 
It was before we got woke, and now 
that we are woke, we should stay woke, 
and teach officers about this problem 
and have them be able to identify it. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, between 3.2 
million and 5.3 million people live with 
a traumatic brain injury-related dis-
ability in the United States, and ap-
proximately 7 percent of Americans 
will experience such a disorder at some 
point in their lives. These illnesses are 
especially common among veterans 
and servicemembers. 
Despite the prevalence of TBI and 
PTSD, many law enforcement officers, 
and other first responders, are still not 
adequately trained on how to identify 
these symptoms. Since many symp-
toms of traumatic brain injury or post- 
traumatic stress disorder, such as con-
fusion, impaired thinking, or irrita-
bility, can be mistaken for intoxica-
tion and aggression. Law enforcement 
can misinterpret the behavior of some 
people exhibiting those symptoms and 
deadly consequences could follow for 
first responders and the people they en-
counter. 
This legislation would help ensure 
that officers are trained to identify 
those symptoms in order to respond ap-
propriately to crisis calls and to divert 
individuals toward mental healthcare 
and treatment and away from the 
criminal justice system. 
Through the Bureau of Justice As-
sistance, agencies have access to train-
ing and resources from the Police Men-
tal Health Collaboration toolkit. H.R. 
2992 would enhance the existing pro-
gram to include crisis intervention 
training on recognizing the signs of 
these illnesses and responding to the 
individuals in crisis. 
It requires the CDC to also study oc-
currences of concussion and TBI among 
law enforcement officers and first re-
sponders; many of whom suffer from 
this, and they need to be given treat-
ment, if they are. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
PASCRELL, who is the leader of the Law 
Enforcement Caucus and a strong voice 
for law enforcement. I also thank Mr. 
BACON and Mrs. DEMINGS, a law en-
forcement chief, I believe, and Mr. 
RUTHERFORD, a sheriff, for their dedica-
tion to law enforcement, first respond-
ers, and the citizens they serve. 
This important bipartisan legislation 
is broadly supported by numerous law 
enforcement and mental health organi-
zations and would help protect the 
lives of first responders and the people 
they encounter. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today our law enforce-
ment officers are under immense pres-
sure as they face more and more crimi-
nal activity with fewer and fewer re-
sources. 
Often, officers are called on to re-
spond to high-stress situations involv-
ing people who are an extreme emo-
tional or altered mental states. 
This bill will help law enforcement to 
better understand and interact with in-
dividuals experiencing traumatic brain 
injuries or post-traumatic stress dis-
order. 
While traumatic brain injuries affect 
people of all ages and backgrounds, 
data suggests that there is a higher 
prevalence among certain groups, in-
cluding veterans, the homeless, and 
those who have been incarceration. 
These groups are also more likely to 
have encounters with law enforcement. 
Studies have shown that it is often 
difficult for law enforcement officers to 
differentiate between those suffering 
from brain injuries or PTSD, and those 
who are intoxicated by alcohol or 
drugs. 
For example, common signs of in-
toxication, such as slurred speech, out-
bursts of anger, slow response times, 
and forgetfulness can also be signs of 
traumatic brain injury. Training offi-
cers to recognize the differences be-
tween traumatic brain injury or PTSD 
and intoxication can lead to more fa-
vorable outcomes for the officers and 
the individuals they encounter. 
This bill will require the Bureau of 
Justice Assistance within the Justice 
Department to develop training that 
will inform officers on what type of 
treatment and resources the individual 
may need. 
For individuals suffering from trau-
matic brain injury, medical referrals 
may be the most appropriate. This 
training will promote the safety of our 
men and women in uniform and im-
prove public safety in our commu-
nities. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, it is impor-
tant to note that seeing this body sup-
port law enforcement, rather than to 
condemn it, is a welcome, if only brief, 
departure from how Democrats have 
treated our police forces over the past 
2 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes 
to 
the 
honorable, 
distin-
guished, and learned gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL). 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, this 
pandemic has been a grave hardship for 
our first responders. Men and women in 
blue have risked their lives every day. 
Last year was the deadliest ever for 
law enforcement. 
During National Police Week, we 
honor these heroes who have made the 
ultimate sacrifice. They protect us, 
and we must have their backs. Period. 
I have been co-chair of the Congres-
sional Law Enforcement Caucus for 
many moons. I know our cops must 
have the training, the resources, and 
the personnel they need to keep our 
communities safe. 
This bipartisan Traumatic Brain In-
jury and Post-Traumatic Stress Dis-
order Law Enforcement Training Act is 
a vital step. It will provide crises inter-
vention training grants. These Federal 
funds will help officers handle different 
interactions with those suffering from 
TBI and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
I founded the Congressional Brain In-
jury Task Force in 2001, along with Dr. 
Greenwood. He was a Republican; I am 
a Democrat. He was from Pennsyl-
vania. He did an outstanding job and 
continues do it in this area, which is so 
misunderstood, Mr. Speaker. We didn’t 
get to it until late into Iraq and Af-
ghanistan with our veterans and with 
our soldiers on the front lines. Of 
course, it was major injury in both of 
those wars—post-traumatic stress dis-
order and TBI, traumatic brain injury. 
So forward 20 years, we worked to 
draw attention to the struggle of mil-
lions of Americans living with long- 
term disabilities caused by traumatic 
brain injury. Now, of course, we take 
good care of our vets. Can you imagine, 
we went to war, and we had no money 
in the budget. We had no programs to 
help those who were most injured in 
the two wars that we got into. We were 
not prepared, and we suffered tremen-
dous amounts of injuries because of it. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman NAD-
LER and Chairman PALLONE and their 
dedicated staff for their diligent work 
to bring the TBI and PTSD, Post-Trau-
matic Stress Disorder Law Enforce-
ment Training Act to the floor. I also 
thank Representatives DEMINGS, RUTH-
ERFORD, and BACON for co-leading this 
bipartisan effort. 
Finally, I thank our law enforcement 
and TBI community stakeholders who 
helped us craft and advance this impor-
tant policy. These past couple of years 
have been difficult for our commu-
nities and especially so for our men 
and women in uniform. 
Mr. Speaker, the House stands with 
them during Police Week and after 
2022. I am honored to present this legis-
lation. 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, in closing, 
I ask everybody to support this impor-
tant legislation for law enforcement 
and for mental health. Vote ‘‘aye’’. No 
roll call.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 2992, the bipartisan TBI and 
PTSD Law Enforcement Training Act, that 
would require the Bureau of Justice Assist-
ance to develop training for law enforcement 
officers on how best to respond to crisis calls 
involving individuals suffering from the effects 
of traumatic brain injuries and posttraumatic 
stress disorder. 
According to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC), there were approxi-
mately 2.9 million TBI-related emergency de-
partment visits, hospitalizations, and deaths in 
the United States in 2014 and TBI’s were 
identified in 25 percent of all injury-related 
deaths in 2017. 
More than 430,000 U.S. service members 
were diagnosed with a TBI between the year 
2000 and 2020. 
With the prevalence of TBI and PTSD 
among the general population, and particularly 
among military service members, there is a 
need to increase training for law enforcement 
officers to recognize the unique challenges of 
TBI and PTSD and more effectively respond 
to crisis calls. 
TBI and PTSD can have a significant impact 
on an individual’s ability to make decisions, 
control impulses, or think clearly. 
Many of the symptoms of TBI and PTSD, 
such as confusion, inability to follow directions, 
and impaired thinking or memory, can be mis-
interpreted or mistaken for intoxication. 
And individuals who suffer from TBI or 
PTSD may also appear agitated or exhibit im-
paired emotional functioning, which can be 
misunderstood as aggression. 
These impairments can impede proper com-
munication and cause interactions between 
law enforcement and civilians to escalate, pos-
ing potential safety risks to both parties—when 
officers are not trained to recognize the signs 
and symptoms. 
Many officer-involved encounters could have 
led to better outcomes if the officers involved 
had known: 1) how to recognize that these in-
dividuals were in crisis and suffering from the 
effects of traumatic events; 2) the best forms 
of interaction with them; and 3) how to maxi-
mize officer and subject safety. 
H.R. 2992 would require DOJ, through the 
Bureau of Justice Assistance, to solicit best 
practices related to recognizing and respond-
ing to individuals with TBI and PTSD and to 
develop Crisis Intervention Training tools for 
law enforcement agencies to better respond to 
these potentially catastrophic encounters. 
This legislation would incorporate TBI and 
PTSD training—once developed—into the ex-
isting Police Mental Health Collaboration tool-
kit, a proven, no-cost online resource for law 
enforcement agencies, made available by the 
Bureau of Justice Assistance. 
It would further require the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention to study and un-
derstand the prevalence of concussions and 
Traumatic Brain Injury, specifically, among law 
enforcement officers and first responders. 
Recognizing that Crisis Intervention Training 
programs have yielded significant benefits for 
law enforcement agencies, including limiting 
the need for higher levels of police interven-
tion, reducing officer injuries, and redirecting 
people in crisis away from the criminal justice 
system and toward mental health services, 
this legislation would provide additional re-
sources and support for agencies working to 
improve public safety and ensure that individ-
uals in their communities receive the care they 
need. 
This legislation would also build upon exist-
ing best practices to provide officers, through 
Law Enforcement Mental Health Learning 
Sites, additional tools they need to continue to 
protect the communities they serve and save 
lives. 
I commend Representatives BILL PASCRELL, 
DON BACON, JOHN RUTHERFORD, and our col-
league, Representative VAL DEMINGS for intro-
ducing this critical, bipartisan legislation and 
urge my colleagues to join me in support of 
this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
COHEN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2992, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

CONDEMNING RISING 
ANTISEMITISM 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 1125), condemning rising 
antisemitism, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1125 
Whereas the Jewish-American experience 
is a story of faith, fortitude, and progress 
and is connected to key tenets of American 
identity; 
Whereas generations of Jewish people have 
come to this Nation fleeing oppression, dis-
crimination, and persecution in search of a 
better life for themselves and their children; 
Whereas these Jewish Americans have cre-
ated lives for themselves and their families 
and played indispensable roles in our Na-
tion’s civic and community life, making in-
valuable 
contributions 
to 
our 
Nation 
through their leadership and achievements; 
Whereas, on August 21, 1790, President 
George Washington sent a letter to the He-
brew Congregation of Newport, Rhode Island, 
expressing that the newly formed United 
States would be a Nation that ‘‘gives to big-
otry no sanction, to persecution no assist-
ance’’ and that the Jewish people should 
‘‘dwell in this land [and] continue to merit 
and enjoy the good will of the other inhab-
itants . . . and there shall be none to make 
him afraid.’’; 
Whereas we should acknowledge and cele-
brate the crucial contributions that Jewish 
Americans have made to our collective 
struggle for a more just and fair society, 
leading movements for justice and equality, 
and working to ensure opportunities for all; 
Whereas 
alongside 
this 
narrative 
of 
achievement and opportunity, there is also a 
history, far older than the Nation itself, of 
racism, bigotry, and other forms of prejudice 
manifesting in the scourge of antisemitism; 
Whereas antisemitism is an insidious form 
of prejudice stretching back millennia that 
attacks the humanity of the Jewish people 
and has led to violence, destruction of lives 
and communities, and genocide; 
Whereas conspiracy theories that Jews are 
uniquely evil and influential has led to mass 
killings of Jews throughout time, including 
the poisonous Nazi ideology that resulted in 
the murder of 6,000,000 Jews, including 
1,500,000 Jewish children, and millions of 
other victims of the Nazis in Europe; 
Whereas over the course of the past decade, 
Holocaust distortion and denial has grown in 
intensity; 
Whereas a 2020 survey of all 50 States in 
the United States on Holocaust knowledge 
among Millennials and Gen Z conducted by 
the Conference on Jewish Material Claims 
Against Germany (Claims Conference), found 
a clear lack of awareness of key historical 
facts; 63 percent of respondents did not know 
that 6,000,000 Jews were murdered during the 
Holocaust and 36 percent thought that ‘‘two 
million or fewer Jews’’ were killed; 
Whereas there is a documented and dan-
gerous rise of antisemitism globally and in 
the United States, where Jews are increas-
ingly affected by the grotesque spread of 
misinformation and lies including blame for 
the spread of COVID–19, false claims includ-
ing the control of the media and the finan-
cial system, accusations of dual loyalty, and 
a multitude of negative stereotypes; 
Whereas the American Jewish Committee 
(AJC)’s 2021 State of Antisemitism in Amer-
ica report, a survey of American Jews and 
the general public’s perceptions of anti-
semitism, revealed 24 percent of American 
Jews have been personally targeted by anti-
semitism in the past 12 months, 4 in 10 
American Jews changed their behavior at 
least once out of fear of antisemitism, 90 per-
cent believe antisemitism is a problem in the 
United States, and 82 percent feel it has in-
creased in the past 5 years; 
Whereas, according to the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, Jews were the target of 55 
percent of all religiously motivated hate 
crimes in 2020, despite accounting for no 
more than 2 percent of the United States 
population; 
Whereas 
the 
Anti-Defamation 
League 
(ADL)’s 2021 Audit of Antisemitic Incidents 
in the United States recorded 2,717 acts of as-
sault, vandalism, and harassment this past 
year alone, an average of more than 7 inci-
dents per day; a 34-percent increase from 2020 
and the highest year on record since ADL 
began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979; 
Whereas 525 antisemitic incidents took 
place at Jewish institutions, an increase of 
61 percent from data collected in 2020; 
Whereas antisemitic assaults increased by 
167 percent in 2021 compared to the previous 
year and assaults in 2021 were 138 percent 
higher than the rolling 5-year average of 
antisemitic assaults; 
Whereas there was a substantial surge of 
antisemitic incidents in the United States in 
May 2021, 387 incidents were reported, a 141 
percent increase in reports of antisemitic in-
cidents compared to May 2020; Jewish indi-
viduals were violently attacked in major cit-
ies including New York and Los Angeles; 
Whereas the use of antisemitic language, 
conspiracy theories, and hatred has in-
creased on multiple social media platforms— 
from Facebook and Instagram to Twitter 
and TikTok, among others—including tropes 
about Jewish control and messages praising 
Hitler and demonizing all Jews; 
Whereas a recent example of the violent 
antisemitism took place on Saturday, Janu-
ary 15, 2022, when, during religious services 
at Congregation Beth Israel, a terrorist held

4 people, including a rabbi, hostage at gun-
point for 11 hours; 
Whereas police departments in a number of 
American cities, including New York and 
Los Angeles, have said that they are step-
ping up patrols at synagogues and other lo-
cations associated with the Jewish commu-
nity following the hostage situation; 
Whereas 
there 
are 
regular 
acts 
of 
antisemitic vandalism against synagogues 
and Jewish schools in the United States and 
numerous nonlethal attacks on American 
Jews, leaving many Jews feeling increas-
ingly unsafe in public spaces and houses of 
worship; 
Whereas AJC’s 2021 State of Antisemitism 
in America report revealed 56 percent of re-
spondents’ religious institutions increased 
security since the Tree of Life synagogue 
shooting; and 
Whereas the rise in antisemitism is part of 
the larger trend of the rise of hate-filled 
movements that are targeting marginalized 
communities here in the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) calls on elected officials, faith leaders, 
and civil society leaders to use their bully 
pulpit to condemn and combat any and all 
manifestations of antisemitism; 
(2) calls on elected officials to condemn 
and combat any and all denials and distor-
tions of the Holocaust and to promote Holo-
caust and antisemitism education; 
(3) calls for amplifying and ensuring 
United States leadership to fight global anti-
semitism, working with the Department of 
State’s Special Envoy to Monitor and Com-
bat Antisemitism and intensifying coopera-
tion with international governments and 
parliaments around the world; 
(4) works in tandem with the cross-party 
Inter-Parliamentary Task Force to Combat 
Online Antisemitism to help craft thoughtful 
global initiatives designed to address online 
antisemitism; 
(5) calls on social media platforms to insti-
tute stronger and more significant efforts to 
measure and address online antisemitism 
while protecting free speech concerns; 
(6) takes all possible steps to improve the 
physical security of Jewish institutions and 
organizations, including by using existing 
tools such as increasing funding for the Non-
profit Security Grant Program of the De-
partment of Homeland Security to keep at- 
risk houses of worship, schools, and commu-
nity centers safe from terrorist attacks and 
other forms of antisemitic violence; 
(7) ensures the safety, security, and dignity 
of American Jews in all aspects of their 
lives, including the workplace, college and 
university campuses, synagogues, and at 
home; the development of these measures 
must reflect the full diversity of the Jewish 
community in its entirety; and 
(8) supports the right of Americans to free-
ly exercise their religious beliefs and rejects 
all forms of terror and hate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN) and the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Tennessee. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material H. Res. 1125. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Tennessee? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, throughout the month 
of May, we recognize the struggles and 
triumphs of Jewish Americans, and we 
honor the indispensable contributions 
that the Jewish community has made 
to our Nation’s civic life. Sadly, we 
also know that anti-Semitism con-
tinues to be a menace here at home and 
around the world. That is why I am 
pleased to support this important reso-
lution condemning rising anti-Semi-
tism. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Representative 
DEBBIE
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ, for being so vigilant over the 
years to recognize a particular month 
where we have particular appreciation 
of Jewish residents’ contributions to 
our country, and for bringing this reso-
lution to the floor to recognize this 
horrific rise in anti-Semitism. 
Since our Nation’s founding, Jewish 
Americans have served in elected of-
fice, from local school boards to this 
building’s hallowed halls, the Supreme 
Court, and other prestigious positions. 
They have done so in magnificent man-
ners. They have made crucial contribu-
tions to the arts, the sciences, and to 
our collective struggle for a more just 
America. They even had a baseball 
pitcher, Sandy Koufax, who was better 
than any. 
Indeed, this resolution calls upon us 
to 
recognize 
the 
Jewish-American 
story, like the story of America itself, 
which is also marked by bigotry and 
hatred. Informed by this experience of 
prejudice, by the scourge of anti-Semi-
tism, 
the 
Jewish 
Americans 
have 
worked so that the opportunities they 
have secured are extended to others. 
That is part of the Jewish religion. 
Part of what you do to have a good life 
is to help others have that good life, 
too. They have led movements for so-
cial justice, demanding civil rights, 
women’s rights, and workers’ rights. 
This work is far from over. Anti- 
Semitism violence is on the rise. This 
past weekend, we saw a deranged indi-
vidual in Buffalo kill 10 African Ameri-
cans and injure others. He had a hate 
for African Americans, but he also said 
he was anti-Semitic. He learned all this 
over the internet, and he learned a lot 
of that from rhetoric that has sprung 
up in different places and political cir-
cles around this country. It has spread, 
and it has influenced people to commit 
acts of violence. 
Mr. 
COHEN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
for 
collegiality purposes, I ask to with-
draw the motion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The mo-
tion is withdrawn.

PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER 
SUPPORT ACT OF 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 6943) to amend the Omnibus 
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 
1968 to authorize public safety officer 
death benefits to officers suffering 
from post-traumatic stress disorder or 
acute stress disorder, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6943 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Public Safe-
ty Officer Support Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Every day, public safety officers, in-
cluding police officers, firefighters, emer-
gency medical technicians, and others, work 
to maintain the safety, health, and well- 
being of the communities they serve. 
(2) This means public safety officers are 
routinely called to respond to stressful and 
potentially traumatic situations, often put-
ting their own lives in danger. 
(3) This work not only puts public safety 
officers at-risk for experiencing harm, seri-
ous injury, and cumulative and acute trau-
ma, but also places them at up to 25.6 times 
higher risk for developing post-traumatic 
stress disorder when compared to individuals 
without such experiences. 
(4) Psychological evidence indicates that 
law enforcement officers experience signifi-
cant job-related stressors and exposures that 
may confer increased risk for mental health 
morbidities (such as post-traumatic stress 
disorder and suicidal thoughts, ideation, in-
tents, and behaviors) and hastened mor-
tality. 
(5) Public safety officers often do not have 
the resources or support they need, leaving 
them at higher risk for long-term mental 
health consequences. 
(6) Whereas, although the Department of 
Defense already considers servicemember 
suicides to be line-of-duty deaths and pro-
vides Federal support to eligible surviving 
families, the Federal Government does not 
recognize public safety officer suicides as 
deaths in the line of duty. 
(7) In 2017, the Department of Justice ap-
proved 481 claims under the Public Safety Of-
ficers’ Benefits Program under subpart 1 of 
part L of title I of the Omnibus Crime Con-
trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 
10281 et seq.), but not one of them for the 
more than 240 public safety officers who died 
by suicide that year. 
(8) Public safety officers who have died or 
are disabled as a result of suicide or post- 
traumatic stress disorder do not qualify for 
the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Pro-
gram, despite the fact that public safety offi-
cers are more likely to die by suicide than 
from any other line-of-duty cause of death.

‘‘(C) post-traumatic stress disorder, acute

tended to bring about the officer’s death and 
directly and proximately resulted in such of-
ficer’s death or permanent and total dis-
ability and exposure, while on duty, to one 
or more traumatic events was a substantial 
factor in the action taken by the officer; or

end of exposure, while on duty, to a trau-
matic event, which action was intended to 
bring about the officer’s death and directly

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Tennessee. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Tennessee? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Public Safety Offi-
cer Support Act of 2022 is another bi-
partisan bill that would expand eligi-
bility for public safety officers’ bene-
fits to include stress and trauma-re-
lated injuries and death by suicide for 
law enforcement officers and their fam-
ilies. 
According to research from the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration, public safety offi-
cers are 25 times more likely to de-
velop acute stress disorder, post-trau-
matic stress disorder, or other mental 
health conditions than the general pub-
lic. They have a tough job. 
Studies have shown that law enforce-
ment officers could experience more 
traumatic events in 6 months than the 
average person will experience in a life-
time. 
The Public Safety Officers’ Benefits 
Program, known as PSOB, provides 
death and education benefits to sur-
vivors of fallen law enforcement offi-
cers, firefighters, and other first re-
sponders, as well as disability benefits 
to officers catastrophically injured in 
the line of duty. 
Currently, this law excludes from eli-
gibility families of officers who die by 
suicide and does not deem PTSD and 
other trauma-related disorders to be 
line-of-duty injuries. 
This limitation not only fails to rec-
ognize that mental health is physical 
health, but it also prevents the Federal 
Government from providing support to 
officers who put their safety and well- 
being on the line every day for the 
communities they serve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5122 
May 18, 2022 
Former Representative Patrick Ken-
nedy passed a bill to make mental 
health and physical health parity. He 
worked with Senator Ted Kennedy to 
get that done. Why law enforcement 
wasn’t included was a mistake. We are 
rectifying that mistake today. 
The Public Safety Officer Support 
Act would right past wrongs and ensure 
that families of police officers and first 
responders receive critical financial as-
sistance as they grieve the loss of their 
loved ones. 
It would also ensure that officers who 
are disabled as a result of traumatic 
events receive the support and care 
that they need. 
This legislation also brings this pro-
gram into alignment with the provi-
sions of Federal military death bene-
fits for the families of military service-
members who die by suicide. 
The need for this worthy and overdue 
change is even more apparent as we 
continue to grieve the tragic loss of 
four police officers who died by suicide 
after responding to the attack on the 
U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. 
They tried to defend us; they did de-
fend us; and they, unfortunately, died 
by suicide as aftermath effects of Janu-
ary 6. 
In addition to expanding eligibility 
for death and disability benefits to offi-
cers and their families, this bill will re-
quire the GAO to study benefits pro-
vided under the expansion. 
This report will help us better under-
stand the prevalence of traumatic 
events that law enforcement officers, 
first responders, and other public safe-
ty officers face and the need to further 
support their mental health needs. 
I thank Representatives TRONE and 
RESCHENTHALER for introducing this bi-
partisan legislation and for their con-
tinued support for public safety officers 
serving communities across the coun-
try. 
This bill is broadly supported by both 
mental health and law enforcement 
groups, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this week is National 
Police Week, a week we set aside to 
honor the brave men and women who 
tirelessly work to protect us and keep 
our communities safe. 
Unfortunately, their jobs are becom-
ing more and more difficult, more and 
more stressful, and as a result, they 
need our support now more than ever. 
Over the last 2 years, violent crime 
in this Nation has soared. Nationally, 
we saw a 30 percent increase in mur-
ders from 2019 to 2020, which is the 
largest increase during a single year in 
our Nation’s history. 
That troubling trend continues in 
2021 with FBI data indicating that 
homicides rose another 5 percent in the 
Nation’s 22 largest cities over the al-
ready inflated levels of 2020. 
Overall, in those 22 cities, homicides 
are up 44 percent since 2019. Think of 
that—44 
percent. 
Not 
surprisingly, 
these disturbing increases have accom-
panied calls in many cities, including 
in my hometown of Cincinnati, to 
defund the police. Quite frankly, Mr. 
Speaker, that is the last thing that we 
should be doing during a violent crime 
surge. 
That is why the legislation that we 
are considering today is a welcome bi-
partisan step in the right direction. 
Law 
enforcement 
officers, 
fire-
fighters, emergency medical personnel, 
and corrections officers are frequently 
called to respond to dangerous and 
often traumatic situations. As a result, 
these officers are at a greater risk of 
developing stress and trauma-related 
disorders. 
Studies show that public safety offi-
cers are 25 times more likely to de-
velop PTSD compared to the general 
public. Tragically, more public safety 
officers die by suicide every year than 
those who lose their lives in the line of 
duty. 
Yet, trauma-related disorders are not 
covered by the primary Federal dis-
ability benefits program for police offi-
cers, and that is the Public Safety Offi-
cers’ 
Benefits 
Program, 
or 
PSOB, 
which is run by the Department of Jus-
tice. 
The PSOB program currently pro-
vides death and education benefits to 
the family members of public safety of-
ficers who die in the line of duty and 
also offers disability benefits to public 
safety officers who become totally and 
permanently disabled. 
However, the PSOB program does not 
currently offer death benefits to public 
safety officers who tragically take 
their lives as a result of PTSD, acute 
stress disorder, or other stress and 
trauma-related disorders. 
This bill, H.R. 6943, the Public Safety 
Officer Support Act, addresses this 
oversight. This bipartisan legislation 
recognizes just how stressful and dif-
ficult being a police officer is now-
adays. It makes sure that those officers 
who have experienced traumatic events 
on the job, and are struggling as a re-
sult, receive the support they need and 
deserve. 
The men and women in law enforce-
ment need to know that they have our 
full support and that they will not be 
punished or stigmatized for human 
emotions. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support this commonsense, 
compassionate proposal, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. TRONE), the sponsor of this 
legislation and a gentleman aware of 
law enforcement’s importance. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to pass 
our bill, the Public Safety Officer Sup-
port Act of 2022, so we keep tackling 
mental health stigma across this coun-
try. 
It has been almost 3 years since 
Montgomery 
County 
Officer 
T.J. 
Bomba passed away from suicide. He 
was 38 years old and left behind a wife 
and two sons. 
In the immediate aftermath, we 
brought together Officer Bomba’s col-
leagues and the head of NIMH, Dr. 
Joshua Gordon, and others to chart a 
course of action. We discussed access to 
care, the stigma surrounding mental 
health, and how we could be advocates 
for change. 
The roundtable produced two calls to 
action: increasing peer counseling sup-
port opportunities for mental health 
and providing parity and benefits for 
mental health conditions. 
I made a promise that day to do ev-
erything I could to turn these ideas 
into law. Six months ago, we accom-
plished one of our goals when I stood 
alongside Officer Bomba’s wife and two 
sons as President Biden signed the first 
of our two bills into law. 
The COPS Counseling Act increased 
access to peer support and will help 
fight stigma and improve access to 
mental health services. Today, I stand 
here and applaud the passage of our 
second bill, the Public Safety Officer 
Support Act of 2022. 
According to research from the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration, public safety offi-
cers are 25 times more likely to de-
velop acute stress disorder, post-trau-
matic stress disorder, or other mental 
health conditions than our general 
public, and the conditions often go un-
treated due to the stigma of mental 
health. 
As it stands, mental health is ex-
cluded from the PSOB program. For of-
ficers killed in the line of duty, the 
family is eligible to receive benefits. 
However, when an officer dies by sui-
cide that is directly tied to their job, 
the family is unable to seek death ben-
efits. 
This bill will address the issue of 
stigma and provide the overdue parity 
between physical and mental injuries. 
Officers that are totally disabled as a 
result of their service will have access 
to disability benefits. The families of 
officers who pass away from service- 
linked suicide will have access to death 
benefits. 
This approach has been endorsed by 
numerous mental health organizations, 
including the American Foundation for 
Suicide Prevention. 
With the help of the public safety of-
ficer community, mental health ex-
perts, and my colleagues in Congress, I 
am proud to bring this piece of legisla-
tion before the House. 
I thank everyone who joined the 
roundtable in 2019. We have taken a 
tragedy and turned it into actionable 
solutions. 
I thank all the stakeholders who 
have worked hard to bring this legisla-
tion to the House floor. I appreciate 
their hard work. I thank, Congressman 
RESCHENTHALER, for co-leading this bill 
and for helping us give it strong bipar-
tisan support. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5123 
May 18, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. CRAIG), former ace Com-
mercial Appeal reporter and now Con-
gresswoman from the State of Min-
nesota. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, Cory Slifko 
was a father of two, a husband, and an 
accomplished veteran of the South St. 
Paul Police Department. He spent 20 
years on the force, eventually working 
his way up to serve as a sergeant. 
But Cory also spent 20 years wit-
nessing the unthinkable and unimagi-
nable and was ultimately diagnosed 
with PTSD. On November 5, 2019, Cory 
lost his life to completed suicide, leav-
ing behind his wife, Katie, and their 
children. 
Now, there is not a doubt in my mind 
that Cory’s death occurred as a result 
of his service in the line of duty. But 
today, Katie’s family has not been able 
to access the benefits that Cory earned 
in service to our community. 
It is vital that these programs don’t 
just protect our law enforcement offi-
cers from physical harm but also from 
mental injuries they endure in service 
to our communities. 
We can change that today. It is time 
we right this wrong and offer some 
long-overdue support to Katie, who has 
honored Cory through her advocacy. I 
urge all of you to join me in voting 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I want ev-
eryone to vote in favor of this legisla-
tion and not to go to the extraordinary 
efforts of having to have the yeas and 
nays, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 6943, the bipartisan Public 
Safety Officer Support Act, which would ex-
pand the Public Safety Officer Benefits Pro-
gram to include death benefits for the families 
of officers who die by suicide, and disability 
benefits for officers suffering from post-trau-
matic stress disorder and other trauma related 
disorders. 
During Police Week, as we honor the men 
and women of law enforcement agencies who 
serve across the country, we must fully con-
sider the sacrifices officers make and the risks 
they take to keep our communities safe. 
Officers who dedicate their careers to our 
safety do so at the expense of spending long 
hours away from their families, while sub-
jecting themselves to traumatic events, and in 
too many instances, making the ultimate sac-
rifice. 
The Public Safety Officer Benefits program 
is an important initiative within the Department 
of Justice that provides financial support to of-
ficers, who are injured while serving their com-
munities in the line of duty, and to families of 
officers killed in the line of duty. 
In 2017, the Department of Justice ap-
proved 481 PSOB claims, but not a single 
claim for the over 240 public safety officers 
who died by suicide. 
Unfortunately, the PSOB program does not 
currently cover injury or death caused by trau-
ma and/or mental illness, although public safe-
ty officers are disproportionately exposed to 
traumatic events. 
Research shows that law enforcement offi-
cers are called to the scene of roughly 140 
traumatic incidents over the course of their ca-
reers. 
The resulting rates of PTSD and depression 
among police officers and firefighters are 
unsurprisingly five times higher than among 
the civilian population. 
While we have known for some time that 
law enforcement officers are more likely to die 
by suicide than by traffic accidents and shoot-
ings combined, officer suicides have increased 
over the last two years. 
Sadly, several examples come to mind, in-
cluding Amanda Crowder, a Harris County 
Deputy with the Harris County Sheriff’s Office 
in Houston, who died in January after shooting 
herself; two deputies in St. Lucie County, Flor-
ida, who both died by suicide days apart, leav-
ing behind their one-month-old son; and four 
police officers, of the Capitol Police and 
Washington Metropolitan Police Departments, 
who died by suicide after fighting valiantly to 
protect members of Congress and preserve 
the rule of law on January 6, 2021. 
The families of the officers who died by sui-
cide following the January 6th attack are likely 
barred from receiving any benefit from the 
PSOB program under current law. 
The failure to provide PSOB benefits to de-
serving officers and their families under such 
circumstances is a deeply troubling limitation 
on federal support for first responders and 
their families that must be rectified. 
And it is drastically different from the United 
States’ military policy, where suicides are pre-
sumed to be line-of-duty deaths caused by 
post-traumatic stress, brain injuries, and other 
deployment hazards. 
Now is the time for the Federal government 
to similarly support public safety officers suf-
fering from trauma-related injuries and their 
families. 
Expansion of the PSOB program would pro-
vide crucial financial support to officers and 
families grieving the devastating loss of a 
loved one, following a line of duty injury 
caused by trauma. 
H.R. 6943 would correct a historic wrong by 
recognizing the impact of PTSD and other 
stress disorders on our public safety officers 
and expanding the eligibility of the PSOB pro-
gram to include trauma-related injuries and 
death by suicide. 
I thank Representatives DAVID TRONE and 
GUY
RESCHENTHALER
for introducing this 
thoughtful, bipartisan legislation and I urge my 
colleagues to join me in support of this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
COHEN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6943, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

f 
CONDEMNING RISING 
ANTISEMITISM 
Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution (H. 
Res. 1125) condemning rising anti-
semitism, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1125 
Whereas the Jewish-American experience 
is a story of faith, fortitude, and progress 
and is connected to key tenets of American 
identity; 
Whereas generations of Jewish people have 
come to this Nation fleeing oppression, dis-
crimination, and persecution in search of a 
better life for themselves and their children; 
Whereas these Jewish Americans have cre-
ated lives for themselves and their families 
and played indispensable roles in our Na-
tion’s civic and community life, making in-
valuable 
contributions 
to 
our 
Nation 
through their leadership and achievements; 
Whereas, on August 21, 1790, President 
George Washington sent a letter to the He-
brew Congregation of Newport, Rhode Island, 
expressing that the newly formed United 
States would be a Nation that ‘‘gives to big-
otry no sanction, to persecution no assist-
ance’’ and that the Jewish people should 
‘‘dwell in this land [and] continue to merit 
and enjoy the good will of the other inhab-
itants . . . and there shall be none to make 
him afraid.’’; 
Whereas we should acknowledge and cele-
brate the crucial contributions that Jewish 
Americans have made to our collective 
struggle for a more just and fair society, 
leading movements for justice and equality, 
and working to ensure opportunities for all; 
Whereas 
alongside 
this 
narrative 
of 
achievement and opportunity, there is also a 
history, far older than the Nation itself, of 
racism, bigotry, and other forms of prejudice 
manifesting in the scourge of antisemitism; 
Whereas antisemitism is an insidious form 
of prejudice stretching back millennia that 
attacks the humanity of the Jewish people 
and has led to violence, destruction of lives 
and communities, and genocide; 
Whereas conspiracy theories that Jews are 
uniquely evil and influential has led to mass 
killings of Jews throughout time, including 
the poisonous Nazi ideology that resulted in 
the murder of 6,000,000 Jews, including 
1,500,000 Jewish children, and millions of 
other victims of the Nazis in Europe; 
Whereas over the course of the past decade, 
Holocaust distortion and denial has grown in 
intensity; 
Whereas a 2020 survey of all 50 States in 
the United States on Holocaust knowledge 
among Millennials and Gen Z conducted by 
the Conference on Jewish Material Claims 
Against Germany (Claims Conference), found 
a clear lack of awareness of key historical 
facts; 63 percent of respondents did not know 
that 6,000,000 Jews were murdered during the 
Holocaust and 36 percent thought that ‘‘two 
million or fewer Jews’’ were killed; 
Whereas there is a documented and dan-
gerous rise of antisemitism globally and in 
the United States, where Jews are increas-
ingly affected by the grotesque spread of 
misinformation and lies including blame for 
the spread of COVID–19, false claims includ-
ing the control of the media and the finan-
cial system, accusations of dual loyalty, and 
a multitude of negative stereotypes;

Whereas the American Jewish Committee 
(AJC)’s 2021 State of Antisemitism in Amer-
ica report, a survey of American Jews and 
the general public’s perceptions of anti-
semitism, revealed 24 percent of American 
Jews have been personally targeted by anti-
semitism in the past 12 months, 4 in 10 
American Jews changed their behavior at 
least once out of fear of antisemitism, 90 per-
cent believe antisemitism is a problem in the 
United States, and 82 percent feel it has in-
creased in the past 5 years; 
Whereas, according to the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, Jews were the target of 55 
percent of all religiously motivated hate 
crimes in 2020, despite accounting for no 
more than 2 percent of the United States 
population; 
Whereas 
the 
Anti-Defamation 
League 
(ADL)’s 2021 Audit of Antisemitic Incidents 
in the United States recorded 2,717 acts of as-
sault, vandalism, and harassment this past 
year alone, an average of more than 7 inci-
dents per day; a 34-percent increase from 2020 
and the highest year on record since ADL 
began tracking antisemitic incidents in 1979; 
Whereas 525 antisemitic incidents took 
place at Jewish institutions, an increase of 
61 percent from data collected in 2020; 
Whereas antisemitic assaults increased by 
167 percent in 2021 compared to the previous 
year and assaults in 2021 were 138 percent 
higher than the rolling 5-year average of 
antisemitic assaults; 
Whereas there was a substantial surge of 
antisemitic incidents in the United States in 
May 2021, 387 incidents were reported, a 141 
percent increase in reports of antisemitic in-
cidents compared to May 2020; Jewish indi-
viduals were violently attacked in major cit-
ies including New York and Los Angeles; 
Whereas the use of antisemitic language, 
conspiracy theories, and hatred has in-
creased on multiple social media platforms— 
from Facebook and Instagram to Twitter 
and TikTok, among others—including tropes 
about Jewish control and messages praising 
Hitler and demonizing all Jews; 
Whereas a recent example of the violent 
antisemitism took place on Saturday, Janu-
ary 15, 2022, when, during religious services 
at Congregation Beth Israel, a terrorist held 
4 people, including a rabbi, hostage at gun-
point for 11 hours; 
Whereas police departments in a number of 
American cities, including New York and 
Los Angeles, have said that they are step-
ping up patrols at synagogues and other lo-
cations associated with the Jewish commu-
nity following the hostage situation; 
Whereas 
there 
are 
regular 
acts 
of 
antisemitic vandalism against synagogues 
and Jewish schools in the United States and 
numerous nonlethal attacks on American 
Jews, leaving many Jews feeling increas-
ingly unsafe in public spaces and houses of 
worship; 
Whereas AJC’s 2021 State of Antisemitism 
in America report revealed 56 percent of re-
spondents’ religious institutions increased 
security since the Tree of Life synagogue 
shooting; and 
Whereas the rise in antisemitism is part of 
the larger trend of the rise of hate-filled 
movements that are targeting marginalized 
communities here in the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) calls on elected officials, faith leaders, 
and civil society leaders to use their bully 
pulpit to condemn and combat any and all 
manifestations of antisemitism; 
(2) calls on elected officials to condemn 
and combat any and all denials and distor-
tions of the Holocaust and to promote Holo-
caust and antisemitism education; 
(3) calls for amplifying and ensuring 
United States leadership to fight global anti-
semitism, working with the Department of 
State’s Special Envoy to Monitor and Com-
bat Antisemitism and intensifying coopera-
tion with international governments and 
parliaments around the world; 
(4) works in tandem with the cross-party 
Inter-Parliamentary Task Force to Combat 
Online Antisemitism to help craft thoughtful 
global initiatives designed to address online 
antisemitism; 
(5) calls on social media platforms to insti-
tute stronger and more significant efforts to 
measure and address online antisemitism 
while protecting free speech concerns; 
(6) takes all possible steps to improve the 
physical security of Jewish institutions and 
organizations, including by using existing 
tools such as increasing funding for the Non-
profit Security Grant Program of the De-
partment of Homeland Security to keep at- 
risk houses of worship, schools, and commu-
nity centers safe from terrorist attacks and 
other forms of antisemitic violence; 
(7) ensures the safety, security, and dignity 
of American Jews in all aspects of their 
lives, including the workplace, college and 
university campuses, synagogues, and at 
home; the development of these measures 
must reflect the full diversity of the Jewish 
community in its entirety; and 
(8) supports the right of Americans to free-
ly exercise their religious beliefs and rejects 
all forms of terror and hate.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on H. Res. 1125. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Tennessee? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Jewish Americans have 
contributed an immense amount to our 
country in politics, and in justice, and 
all fields of science, the arts, and the 
greatest left-handed pitcher of all 
time, Sandy Koufax. So much has been 
contributed by the Jewish community, 
yet there has been much anti-Semi-
tism. 
There 
has 
been 
anti-Semitism 
throughout history against Jewish peo-
ple. It is sad. And it has been rising in 
America and continues to rise. 
We saw the killings in Buffalo, New 
York, aimed at African Americans, but 
the killer, in his manifesto, said he not 
only wanted to get rid of and kill Afri-
can Americans, but he also considered 
himself anti-Semitic, and indeed he 
was. 
He fostered some crazy theory of re-
placement, some replacement theory 
that I had not really heard about, and 
he claimed that Jews were in favor of. 
Well, that is just malarkey. 
We need to fight this anti-Semitism, 
and 
nobody 
more 
than 
DEBBIE 
WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ, our colleague 
from Florida, has done more to have 
folks reflect on the contributions of 
Jewish people during Jewish Heritage 
Month, which she sponsored and passed 
and keeps alive, and then the passage 
of this resolution to bring anti-Semi-
tism to our attention. 
It is important that we pass this, and 
that we understand Jewish American 
Heritage Month, which is this May, 
while we celebrate the contributions of 
Jewish Americans and we reject hate 
whenever and wherever it appears. 
I thank Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ 
again—she has done so much, and she 
is a leader in this area and so many 
others as well—for bringing this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5125 
May 18, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 1125, which clearly and vigor-
ously condemns anti-Semitism. During 
Jewish American Heritage Month, it is 
critical to, once again, call attention 
to this vile form of bigotry. 
Persecution against any person, or 
any group on the basis of religion is ab-
solutely wrong. It is a fundamental 
value upon which this Nation was 
founded, which is why the free exercise 
of religion is protected in the very first 
amendment to our Constitution. 
The historic and pervasive nature 
that makes anti-Semitism a truly 
unique problem has, unfortunately, 
proven to make it difficult to over-
come. In the aftermath of the Holo-
caust, the world realized just how per-
nicious anti-Semitism was and has 
been for centuries, and rightly sought 
to eliminate it. 
Unfortunately, despite this recogni-
tion, Jewish Americans have experi-
enced a rise in anti-Semitism. From 
their places of worship to their neigh-
borhoods, Jewish Americans experience 
anti-Semitism all too often. And the 
incidents range from mere slurs all the 
way to outright violence. 
Regrettably, Jewish Americans have 
even been attacked in major cities 
such as Pittsburgh, New York, and Los 
Angeles just to name some. 
At the same time, our Nation’s col-
lective memories of the Holocaust, un-
fortunately, continues to fade. That is 
why it is critically important to con-
demn anti-Semitism in no uncertain 
terms, without drawing false equiva-
lencies or diminishing anti-Semitism 
just as another form of bigotry. 
I am concerned about the references 
to government intervention in the on-
line speech, and I do wish my Demo-
cratic colleagues had been willing to 
work with us to ensure that that par-
ticular portion actually represented 
the sentiment of the entire House on 
those issues. We cannot allow our 
shared desire to combat anti-Semitism 
to lead to censorship and control, 
which may only exacerbate the prob-
lem. 
Our Jewish friends deserve our re-
spect and admiration and appreciation. 
That is why, for my time in Congress I 
have always tried and always sought to 
support Jewish Americans, as well as 
Israel. So while I am not happy with 
every aspect of this resolution, I urge 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding, and for both gentlemen’s re-
marks. 
Mr. Speaker, 17 years ago, the first 
legislation I passed as a Member of 
Congress declared the month of May as 
Jewish American Heritage Month, or 
JAHM, and urged the President of the 
United States to make that declaration 
on behalf of the United States. 
Since that resolution passed, every 
President has issued a proclamation 
declaring May as Jewish American 
Heritage Month. 
The mission of JAHM is to educate 
all Americans about the contributions 
American Jews have made to our Na-
tion for more than 350 years. 
Jews have blazed American trails, 
from the battlefield and basketball 
court, across the biggest stages, to the 
big screen, and from the Supreme 
Court, to civil rights and social justice 
movements. Our story is woven into 
America’s history, through generations 
of leaders. 
Yet, as we who honor the profound 
impact American Jews made on our na-
tional history and culture, I must 
sadly acknowledge that the recognition 
and understanding JAHM seeks to fos-
ter is critically needed now more than 
ever. 
There has been a precipitous rise in 
anti-Semitism. In the last year alone, 
the Anti-Defamation League reports 
that anti-Semitic incidents are up 34 
percent nationwide. 
The American Jewish Committee re-
ports that 24 percent of American Jews 
were personally targeted by anti-Semi-
tism in the past 12 months. Four in 10 
American Jews changed their behavior 
at least once out of fear of anti-Semi-
tism. An alarming 90 percent believe 
anti-Semitism is a problem in the 
United States. 
We also know that there has been a 
particularly disturbing surge in as-
saults against Americans who are iden-
tifiably Jewish by virtue of their wear-
ing religious garb, particular clothing, 
or based upon the locations in which 
they live or shop. 
In May 2021, during the military con-
flict between Israel and Hamas, there 
was a substantial surge of anti-Semitic 
incidents in the U.S., with 387 of them 
reported, or a 148 percent increase in 
reports of anti-Semitic incidents com-
pared to May of 2020. 
Anti-Semitism also emerged in the 
horrific Buffalo shooting, where an 
armed white terrorist targeted African 
Americans for mass murder. He was 
driven, in part, by a xenophobic plan 
called replacement theory, which at its 
root, blames Jews for masterminding 
an effort to erode the power of White 
Americans. This madness will only fuel 
more violence, and it cannot be al-
lowed to stand. 
To combat this anti-Semitic scourge 
in our communities, leaders through-
out our country must firmly, and 
clearly, and forcefully denounce the 
alarming rise in rampant hate, vio-
lence, and harassment targeting Jew-
ish Americans. 
That is why I am proud today to 
bring H. Res. 1125 to the floor, which is 
unequivocal, bipartisan condemnation 
of anti-Semitism, because enough is 
enough. 
This resolution denounces the alarm-
ing rise in anti-Semitism in the United 
States and globally, and it issues a call 
for real, concrete action to combat it. 
Those action items include: 
Promoting Holocaust education, Jew-
ish identity, and anti-Semitism edu-
cation, along with condemnation of all 
denials and distortions of the Holo-
caust. 
Working with the newly confirmed 
State Department’s Special Envoy to 
Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism to 
ensure U.S. leadership in the fight 
against global anti-Semitism. 
Working with all social media plat-
forms to institute stronger efforts to 
address online anti-Semitism, while 
protecting First Amendment rights. 
Taking all possible steps to improve 
the physical security of Jewish institu-
tions, including increased funding for 
the Nonprofit Security Grant Program 
so it can continue its essential work of 
protecting Jewish and other faith- 
based institutions across the country. 
Ensuring the safety, security, and 
dignity of American Jews in all aspects 
of their lives, including the workplace, 
university campuses, and at home. 
During Jewish American Heritage 
Month, we celebrate the continued di-
versity and contributions to American 
life by the Jewish community. In doing 
so, we must also acknowledge anti- 
Semitism is not a relic of the past but 
remains a clear and present danger 
today. 
Taking action today is just one step. 
Let us renew our commitment to de-
fending the rights of all people. 
Before I end, I want to take a mo-
ment to thank all those who made 
today possible: my co-leads, Congress-
men MARIO DIAZ-BALART, BRAD SCHNEI-
DER, and LEE ZELDIN and, of course, 
Leader HOYER, and many other col-
leagues and staff whose effort helped 
bring this resolution to the floor today. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers and would be willing 
to close at this time unless the gen-
tleman has additional speakers. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
leader of the House of Representatives, 
a gentleman who continues to amaze 
me each and every day with his vast 
knowledge, and his big heart, and his 
love for justice. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished gentleman for his 
very generous comments and congratu-
late him for his leadership in so many 
different ways, not only on this sub-
committee, but also on the Commis-
sion on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, which he chairs, and which is 
so focused on human rights throughout 
the world. 
I thank Mr. COHEN and Mr. CHABOT 
for their leadership on this and bring-
ing this to the floor, bringing it in a bi-
partisan fashion. I appreciate that very 
much. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the 
Congresswoman from Florida, DEBBIE 
WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ. 
DEBBIE 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ has been a giant, 
yes, on anti-Semitism, but on civil 
rights and human rights generally.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5126 
May 18, 2022 
We understand that if one of us is at 
risk, all of us are at risk if we do not 
honor the rights of each individual in 
our country. And, as a matter of fact, 
that is one of the things that makes us 
so distinct. 
This is an important resolution. It is 
a vital resolution. It is a resolution 
that must be adopted so that Congress 
can make clear at this moment, at this 
tragic moment in our history, that 
Jewish Americans can feel safe and at 
home in our country, and that anti- 
Semitism has no place here. Discrimi-
nation and bigotry and hate have no 
place in America. 
Throughout the month of May, we 
celebrate Jewish American Heritage 
Month, as the gentlewoman pointed 
out. Why is that so important? 
It is important because when we cele-
brate the achievements and contribu-
tions of a community, we affirm that 
this community matters; that those in 
it are valued members of our American 
family. That is why Black lives matter, 
Jewish lives matter, individual lives 
matter. 
But we know that there are par-
ticular groups who are targeted, tar-
geted for discrimination, and hate, and, 
yes, violence. 
When we fail to recognize or cele-
brate the history and heritage of a par-
ticular community, it sends a signal 
that they are not valued, that they do 
not matter, and that they are not 
equal, that they do not count. 
Again and again throughout history, 
Jewish people were seen as lesser than. 
Indeed, disturbingly, Jews were seen as 
less than human, which inevitably led 
to the discrimination, violence and, 
yes, even the genocide of the last cen-
tury. 
Jews who came to our shores were 
seeking a place to live in safety and 
freedom. We should be proud of that, 
and we need to protect that. Trag-
ically, anti-Semitism followed Jewish 
Americans from the Old World to the 
new one and has become a growing can-
cer on our body politic. 
Too many Americans need to hear 
the loud voices of their Congress call-
ing out anti-Semitism because too 
many of our fellow citizens are hearing 
leaders they support and trust either 
give voice to anti-Semitism or ration-
alize anti-Semitism. It is not enough 
simply to be against anti-Semitism. 
We must not rationalize or temporize 
with anti-Semitism. 
In recent weeks, we have heard more 
and more about the great replacement 
theory, a twisted conspiratorial ide-
ology rooted in historic anti-Semitism 
and racism that has been used by those 
seeking to justify heinous acts of do-
mestic terrorism targeting minorities. 
That is what happened in Buffalo. 
We recall it from the billowing 
echoes of ‘‘Jews will not replace us’’ 
from the marchers in Charlottesville in 
2017. 
We have also heard accusations of 
dual loyalty tropes about Jewish finan-
cial and political control that inspired 
the Nazis and, yes, the Soviets alike in 
their horrific persecution of Jews in 
the 20th century. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, in the 21st cen-
tury, much of this anti-Semitism is 
fueled online through social media. We 
must not ignore it. It must not be al-
lowed to metastasize. 
b 1430 
We have a chance to do that today. 
As we celebrate Jewish American 
Heritage Month, let us do so with grat-
itude and with joy, but also with con-
cern and vigilance: Concern for what 
anti-Semitism does to Jewish commu-
nities in America and for what it does 
to our Nation and our democracy; and 
vigilance against those who would in-
fect our politics and our culture with 
the same evils that gave the world 
places like Auschwitz, Dachau, and 
Babyn Yar. 
One of the most important ways 
Americans can support our Jewish 
brothers and sisters in this country 
during this time of dangerous and ris-
ing anti-Semitism is to say, ‘‘We see 
you. We stand with you. You matter. 
You count. You are part of this coun-
try and of our community,’’ and to do 
so without qualification or equivo-
cation. 
Every Jewish American, like every 
American, deserves to feel safe and re-
spected in America. Period. 
Let us affirm that today. Let us af-
firm it every day. Let us declare that 
with one strong voice today and every 
day. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
21⁄4 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. SCHNEIDER), a great supporter 
of this resolution and the ideas con-
tained therein. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today resolved to continue to 
stand against anti-Semitism wherever 
it appears. 
Sadly, in this country, incidents of 
anti-Semitism, according to the ADL, 
are up 34 percent, more than 2,700 inci-
dents reported just last year. 
More specifically, according to ADL 
numbers, attacks on synagogues and 
community centers were up 61 percent; 
incidents at K through 12 schools are 
up 106 percent; incidents on college 
campuses, which were already suffering 
from large increases in anti-Semitism, 
were up 21 percent. These include 88 in-
cidents of assault, 1,776 incidents of 
harassment, and 853 reported incidents 
of vandalism. This is only what was re-
ported. We know that there are more 
than what is reported from every State 
and the District of Columbia. 
This past weekend, a white suprema-
cist, who espoused racist and anti-Se-
mitic views, murdered 10 people simply 
because of the color of their skin. His 
rage was fueled by the anti-Semitic 
great replacement conspiracy theory 
that is being spewed by so many people 
in so many places. 
Congress and America as a whole 
must stand strong against anti-Semi-
tism. As leaders, those of us here, we 
must speak up and call out anti-Semi-
tism wherever it is. 
I am grateful for my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle who join in this 
resolution today. I call on everyone to 
support this. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I close 
and ask everybody to support this im-
portant resolution. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill on 
both sides of aisle, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, 
condemning Rising Antisemitism, H. Res. 
1125, acknowledges the multitude of contribu-
tions that American Jews have made to our 
nation. This legislation also condemns the 
documented and dangerous rise of Anti-
semitism globally and domestically. 
This month we celebrate Jewish American 
History Month and remember the contributions 
that Jewish people have made to our nation. 
As a Nation of immigrants, the United States 
is better and stronger because Jewish people 
from all over the world have chosen to be-
come American citizens. Since first arriving in 
the America’s in 1654, Jewish Americans have 
achieved great success, strengthened our 
country, and helped shape our way of life. 
Through their deep commitment to faith, 
family, and community, Jewish Americans re-
mind us of a basic belief that guided the 
founding of this Nation. We must take the op-
portunity to not only remember these contribu-
tions, but also thank the many Jewish Ameri-
cans who defend our ideals as members of 
the United States Armed Forces. 
I am proud to vote for H. Res. 1125 today. 
Anti-Semitic attacks and rhetoric must be met 
with clear voices of condemnation. Our Nation 
is facing a rise in Anti-Semitism and White Su-
premacist extremism. I will lend my voice to 
denounce Antisemitism today and every day 
and continue to stand in solidarity with Jewish 
communities in California and across our Na-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. LOF-
GREN). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN) that the House sus-
pend the rules and agree to the resolu-
tion, H. Res. 1125, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, yester-
day, the Rules Committee met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 1124, 
providing for consideration of three 
measures: 
First, H.R. 350, the Domestic Ter-
rorism Prevention Act, under a closed 
rule. The rule self-executes a man-
ager’s management from Chairman 
NADLER, provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on the Judiciary, and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
Second, H.R. 7688, the Consumer Fuel 
Price Gouging Prevention Act, under a 
structured rule. The rule self-executes 
a manager’s amendment from Chair-
man PALLONE, provides 1 hour of de-
bate equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, makes in order two amend-
ments, and provides one motion to re-
commit. 
Third, H.R. 7790, the Infant Formula 
Supplemental 
Appropriations 
Act, 
under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Ap-
propriations, and provides one motion 
to recommit. 
Finally, the rule provides the major-
ity leader or his designee the ability to 
en bloc requested roll call votes on cer-
tain suspension bills. This authority 
lasts through May 19, 2022. 
Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for 
consideration of several critical meas-
ures, and I would like to begin by say-
ing a few words about H.R. 350, the Do-
mestic Terrorism Prevention Act. 
Just this past weekend, the entire 
Nation watched in horror as a white su-
premacist with a history of violent 
threats brutally slaughtered 10 people, 
almost all of whom were Black, in the 
city of Buffalo, New York. My heart 
breaks for the community still reeling 
from this senseless tragedy only 75 
miles down the road from my home in 
Rochester. 
The FBI is investigating the shooting 
as a hate crime, and the gunman wrote 
a racist and anti-Semitic 180-page doc-
ument outlining his motivation for the 
attack. The gunman intentionally tar-
geted a predominantly Black neighbor-
hood and had plans to attack multiple 
locations afterward, including in Roch-
ester, as has been widely reported in 
the media. 
Mr. Speaker, there has been an unde-
niable surge in domestic terrorism and 
other forms of extremism across our 
Nation. An analysis performed by the 
nonpartisan Center for Strategic and 
International Studies found that do-
mestic terrorism in 2020 was at the 
highest level of any year since 1994, 
which is the earliest year the organiza-
tion analyzed data. 
Domestic terrorism is the most sig-
nificant threat to our Nation in gen-
erations. 
Events 
like 
the 
horrific 
slaughter of Black community mem-
bers in Buffalo have become common 
in our country, and it is time for the 
Federal Government to step up and to 
save lives. 
Before us today, we have legislation 
that helps to provide the tools and re-
sources law enforcement and our com-
munities need to coordinate and com-
bat these threats. 
The Domestic Terrorism Prevention 
Act prioritizes the investigation and 
prosecution of domestic terrorism at 
the Department of Justice, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, and the 
FBI, creating a new office in all three

agencies dedicated to this issue, pro-
moting information sharing among 
public safety officials to better ensure 
an effective and organized joint effort, 
and requiring Federal agencies to pro-
vide training and resources to assist 
State and local law enforcement in de-
tecting and investigating acts of do-
mestic terrorism. 
Mr. Speaker, these are simple, com-
monsense actions that will help protect 
our communities. They should be non-
controversial. In fact, nearly identical 
legislation passed by voice vote last 
Congress. But so far this year, it ap-
pears something has changed. Despite 
the rising incidence of hate crimes and 
the urgent need to provide law enforce-
ment with what they need to combat 
vicious acts of domestic terrorism, 
every Republican on the House Judici-
ary Committee voted against the bill 
in a markup last month. While only 
three Republicans have cosponsored 
the bill this year, I hope more of my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
will again support this bill when it 
comes to the floor for a vote. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 7688, the Consumer Fuel 
Price Gouging Prevention Act, which 
will directly address the pain that 
American families are feeling at the 
pump. 
During a time of decreased oil pro-
duction related to the pandemic and 
global uncertainty around the global 
gas market due to Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine, oil and gas companies are re-
porting historic profits. 
In the first 3 months of 2022 alone, 
ExxonMobil made $5.5 billion in prof-
its; Chevron made $6.3 billion; and 
Shell made a record-breaking $9.1 bil-
lion. 
Everyday Americans continue to see 
high gas prices, but Big Oil has clearly 
decided to keep production low so their 
own profits can stay high. Crude oil 
prices have declined around 20 percent 
from their peak in early March, but re-
tail prices have gone down by only 4 
percent during that same time. Oil 
companies are raking in record profits 
at the expense of hardworking Amer-
ican families, who are struggling to 
keep up with sky-high prices at the 
pump. Simply put, this is un-American. 
In an effort to help working families, 
President Biden called on Big Oil to 
ramp up supply instead of simply reap-
ing profits without making any addi-
tional investment in supply shortages. 
How did these companies respond? 
They announced their intentions to use 
their record-high profits for stock 
buybacks. ExxonMobil announced it 
would triple its purchase of its own 
stock by spending up to $30 billion on 
stock buybacks, and Chevron will pur-
chase $10 billion of stock before the end 
of this year. 
The Biden administration has al-
ready taken steps to lower prices, in-
cluding by releasing 80 million barrels 
of oil from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, with another 1 million barrels 
daily for the next 6 months. 
Today, the House is taking further 
action by granting enhanced authority 
to the FTC and State attorneys general 
to police excessive or exploitative price 
increases of gasoline and home energy 
fuel during a declared energy crisis. 
The penalties collected from these 
companies will be deposited in a con-
sumer relief trust fund administered by 
the U.S. Treasury Department. 
While some of my colleagues con-
tinue to merely talk about rising gas 
prices, we are actually presenting a so-
lution to the problem today. House 
Democrats are taking action on behalf 
of working families to put more money 
in their pockets instead of supporting 
stock buybacks and exploitative price 
gouging by the oil and gas industry. 
Lastly, this rule provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 7790, the Infant For-
mula 
Supplemental 
Appropriations 
Act. Working families living paycheck 
to paycheck are struggling, and they 
need safe, affordable baby formula to 
keep their children healthy. 
Baby formula supplies are out of 
stock at stores across the country, 
threatening the health of infants and 
creating panic among their parents and 
caretakers. 
Ongoing 
supply 
chain 
issues and the Abbott formula recall 
have led to the shortages. 
On Monday, the FDA reached a deal 
with Abbott to reopen the processing 
plant that had been closed due to the 
recall, and the Biden administration 
also announced the FDA would issue 
new guidance to ease import restric-
tions with the goal of bringing the 
most formula into the country as pos-
sible. 
But with 75 percent of families at 
least partially dependent on formula to 
feed their young children, it is impera-
tive that Congress take additional ac-
tion as well. 
This legislation provides emergency 
funding to both address the formula 
shortage and help prevent it from ever 
happening again. The supplemental bill 
provides $28 million for additional staff 
at the FDA to better address infant 
formula safety and supply issues, IT 
system improvements to expand health 
fraud tools, and stronger supply chain 
monitoring and assessments. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this rule and the un-
derlying legislation taking critical ac-
tion to bolster American families and 
protect our communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the distinguished gen-
tleman from New York for yielding me 
the customary 30 minutes, and I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today 
provides for consideration of three 
pieces of legislation, including H.R. 350, 
which my colleagues claim will prevent 
incidents of domestic terrorism. But 
let’s make no mistake, Republicans are 
committed to fighting hatred and vio-
lence in all forms. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 350 does abso-
lutely nothing to actually make our 
communities safer. Rather, this legis-
lation expands the Federal bureauc-
racy. It ignores new and evolving do-
mestic terrorist threats, and it makes 
it more difficult for law enforcement to 
recruit and retain qualified candidates. 
Alarmingly, it empowers Biden’s DOJ 
to continue labeling American parents 
and 
other 
political 
opponents 
as 
threats to stifle their First Amend-
ment rights. 
The rule before us today also pro-
vides for consideration of H.R. 7688, the 
Democrats’ attempt to distract and 
shift blame for President Biden’s self- 
inflicted energy crisis. Since his first 
day in office, President Biden has 
waged an unrelenting war on American 
energy producers. From canceling the 
Keystone XL pipeline to suspending oil 
and gas leasing on Federal lands, Presi-
dent Biden’s radical Green New Deal 
policies have discouraged and denied 
development of American energy re-
sources and the American energy sec-
tor. 
Yet, at the same time that Joe Biden 
has done all this, he absolutely refuses 
to take any accountability for the 
soaring gas prices and the economic 
pain he continues to inflict on hard-
working American families. 
First, the President tried to blame 
Putin, despite the fact that gas prices 
had risen more than 50 percent during 
his first year in office. A quick history 
lesson: That is 1 year before Russia 
ever invaded Ukraine. In fact, gas 
prices have increased every single 
month of this Presidency. 
Now, the President is blaming hard-
working oil and gas producers in places 
like Pennsylvania and across the coun-
try, accusing them of price gouging, 
even though multiple FTC investiga-
tions have repeatedly concluded supply 
and demand is the ultimate driver of 
these rising prices and, by the way, an 
artificial decrease in supply thanks to 
these radical policies. 
H.R. 7688 will impose a socialist 
price-fixing scheme on oil and gas, 
leading to even less production, which 
will hit small businesses and American 
families the hardest. 
Now, I wasn’t alive in the 1970s, but I 
know there are a lot of Members in this 
Chamber who were, and I am sure they 
can remember waiting in line to fuel up 
their cars. If H.R. 7688 is signed into 
law, that travesty will once again be a 
reality. 
Finally, the rule before us makes in 
order H.R. 7790, the Infant Formula 
Supplemental 
Appropriations 
Act. 
Under President Biden’s leadership, our 
Nation is facing an infant formula sup-
ply crisis, with reports that more than 
40 percent of formula is out of stock. 
Instead of working with Republicans to 
redirect excess stocks of formula at 
Federal agencies and force the FDA to 
develop a plan to address this shortage, 
House Democrats simply want to throw 
money at the problem with absolutely 
no plan, no guardrails to ensure that 
funding is spent to actually put baby 
formula back on grocery store shelves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5129 
May 18, 2022 
Let me be clear. We are giving $28 
million to the very same unelected ca-
reer bureaucrats who failed to address 
this crisis when it came to their atten-
tion a year ago. It is absolute madness. 
H.R. 7790 will do nothing, absolutely 
nothing, to alleviate Biden’s baby for-
mula crisis, and it is American babies 
and American families who will be 
forced to suffer the consequences. 
Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I 
failed to mention that today’s rule also 
does not make in order a single Repub-
lican 
amendment, 
but 
I 
guess 
I 
shouldn’t be surprised. Republicans 
have attempted to work with our 
Democratic colleagues to make our 
communities safer, to address inflation 
and lower gas prices, and to help par-
ents feed their babies. But it is abso-
lutely clear from today’s rule and from 
their actions over the last 3 years that 
House Democrats would rather con-
tinue their partisan political theater 
than put forth real solutions to help 
real Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this rule, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. I 
will respond to my friend and colleague 
from the Rules Committee. 
When we talk about the need to have 
bipartisanship and to work together, I 
would again note that the Domestic 
Terrorism Prevention Act passed by a 
voice vote in the previous Congress 
just 2 years ago, yet not only will it 
not pass by a voice vote, it won’t pass 
under our efforts to suspend the rules. 
It required going to the Rules Com-
mittee; it will require a vote on the 
floor; and I daresay, based on the Judi-
ciary Committee and the Rules Com-
mittee, that we will have to pass it 
with little Republican support, some-
thing I regret. We would not only wel-
come their support, but this was a bi-
partisan bill. 
I don’t think that says anything 
about where we have gone. I think it 
says a great deal, though, about where 
my colleagues have gone and how far 
they have moved away from what is 
commonsense, thoughtful legislation 
that reins in a growing threat in Amer-
ica that has been recognized by society 
and recognized by our military, and 
that is the growth of extremism in 
America. 
Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON), a distinguished member 
of the Rules Committee and my very 
good friend. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I will 
start by acknowledging the sorrow and 
terror inflicted upon the families and 
loved ones of the victims of the hateful 
attack in Buffalo last weekend. 
The brutal murders that occurred in 
Buffalo 
were 
yet 
another 
heart-
breaking landmark in the growing 
storm of domestic terrorism impacting 
communities across America. 
Whether in Buffalo, Charleston, El 
Paso, or Pittsburgh, domestic terror-
ists are being radicalized online, fueled 
by elected officials and media pundits 
who either embrace or wink at twisted 
white supremacist ideology spawned in 
the darkest corners of the internet and 
infecting our Nation. 
Communities across America are ter-
rified, scared to go to their super-
markets, schools, churches, mosques, 
and synagogues because of the fear 
that the combination of lax gun laws 
and unchecked white supremacist con-
spiracies 
will 
have 
deadly 
con-
sequences. 
But with this bill, we are here to say 
that we are one American community, 
and we will remain united in the face 
of these attacks. Where domestic ter-
rorists aim to scare and divide our 
communities against each other, we 
must come together and condemn this 
hateful ideology and give law enforce-
ment the tools to fight its most violent 
consequences. 
We are Americans; we are proud of 
our diversity; and we must choose com-
munity over chaos. That is why I am 
proud to support the Domestic Ter-
rorism Prevention Act. 
b 1500 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE), 
my good friend. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to the combined rule and the 
underlying fuel prices legislation in 
this package as it seeks to cast blame 
on hardworking Americans in the en-
ergy industry and offers no real solu-
tions. 
The underlying bill, H.R. 7688, estab-
lishes de facto price control on fuels, a 
dangerous step that has the potential 
to create fuel shortages. Many Ameri-
cans remember the long lines of cars 
waiting at gas stations in the mid- 
1970s, and they do not want to return 
to that scenario. 
But don’t take my word for it. The 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned 
Congress last night that this bill has 
the potential to cause, ‘‘ . . . rationing, 
gas lines, and a much greater depend-
ence on imported energy. . . . ’’ 
Madam Speaker, I remind my col-
leagues that the price of gasoline is de-
termined on a global market based on 
supply and demand. The way to lower 
prices is to increase supply, and we can 
do that by unleashing American pro-
duction. 
Sadly, the administration has been 
doing the exact opposite, delaying per-
mit approvals, denying access to public 
lands, and gaslighting the energy in-
dustry. 
What is worse, just today, the admin-
istration announced that they are re-
moving sanctions on Venezuela in 
order to import foreign oil from a hos-
tile socialist country. 
In my home State of Oklahoma, 
nearly a quarter of all jobs are con-
nected to the energy industry. Frank-
ly, this legislation is insulting to hard-
working Oklahomans throughout the 
Fifth Congressional District whose ef-
forts power this great Nation. 
Instead of legislation that blames 
American energy producers, we should 
roll back the onerous energy policies of 
the Biden administration and unleash 
American energy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to reject the rule and to reject 
the underlying bill. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I do want to be 
clear because the distinguished gentle-
woman mentioned hardworking Okla-
homans, and we certainly appreciate 
their hard work. 
This isn’t about the hardworking 
men and women in Oklahoma who 
work for oil and gas companies. This is 
about the leadership of those compa-
nies that make decisions about where 
their dollars are going to be invested. 
Just to reiterate what I said earlier, 
ExxonMobil made $5.5 billion in profits 
just in the first three months of 2022; 
Chevron, $6.3 billion in profits; Shell 
made a record-breaking $9.1 billion. On 
top of it, they are going to do their 
own buybacks of stocks. 
ExxonMobil announced it would tri-
ple purchasing its own stock by spend-
ing up to $30 billion on stock buybacks. 
Chevron will spend $10 billion on buy-
ing stock before the end of this year; 
they have announced that. 
Madam Speaker, this isn’t about the 
hardworking men and women who we 
respect. This is about corporate execu-
tives who decide to put their interest 
before the interest of the American 
people, particularly at a time when we 
are struggling to get them to increase 
production and we are facing a global 
crisis in oil and gas because of activi-
ties around the world by Vladimir 
Putin, and his unwanted aggression 
against the people of Ukraine, which 
has disrupted the energy market world-
wide. 
Madam Speaker, just to be clear, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s senti-
ments, but we are not talking about 
hardworking men and women. We are 
talking about CEOs who decided to put 
their profits ahead of American inter-
ests. That is what we are talking 
about. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the distinguished gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. SCHNEIDER), my great friend 
and colleague. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from New York for 
yielding. 
The rise of racially motivated violent 
extremism is a serious threat to Amer-
icans across the country. We, in Con-
gress, can’t stop the likes of Tucker 
Carlson from spewing hateful, dan-
gerous replacement theory ideology 
across the airwaves. Congress hasn’t 
been able to ban the sale of assault 
weapons. The Domestic Terrorism Pre-
vention Act is what Congress can do

this week to try to prevent future Buf-
falo shootings, prevent future Cali-
fornia shootings, future El Paso shoot-
ings, future Charleston shootings, fu-
ture Pittsburgh shootings, or future 
Wisconsin shootings. 
We need to ensure that Federal law 
enforcement has the resources they 
need to best preemptively identify and 
thwart extremist violence wherever 
that threat appears. 
In 2020, this House passed the Domes-
tic Terrorism Prevention Act on a 
voice vote with overwhelming support 
on both sides of the aisle. I thank my 
colleagues, 
Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans, who saw the benefit of this leg-
islation and sent it to the Senate. It 
didn’t get a vote in the Senate in 2020, 
which is why we are here today. I am 
grateful that this legislation is being 
brought forward today in this moment. 
To those who are considering voting 
against this bill, I ask them the fol-
lowing: 
What has happened in the 2 years 
since that they no longer support this 
legislation? 
What has changed that they no 
longer support giving the FBI, the De-
partment of Justice, and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, the re-
sources they need to keep Americans 
safe, to make sure kids in their schools 
don’t fear the threat of terrorism, that 
people shopping in a grocery store, 
going about their business, don’t have 
to worry about someone coming in and 
killing them simply because of the 
color of their skin. 
What has changed in 2 years that 
after sending this to the Senate on a 
voice vote, without any opposition 
from Republicans, today, we are not 
there? 
Following the vote in 2020, we intro-
duced this bill on January 19, 2021; 
three Democrats, three Republicans 
leading that with me. It was bipar-
tisan. We have added nearly 200 Demo-
crats to the list, and the Republicans 
stand silently by. The only thing that 
has changed in 2 years is that the risk 
of violence, the risk of domestic terror 
has gone up. 
Madam Speaker, I am calling on my 
colleagues, I am pleading with my col-
leagues, join us in this legislation. 
Let’s join together and send a message 
that we stand with Federal law en-
forcement, we stand with American 
communities, and we stand against do-
mestic terrorism. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I would be more 
than happy to answer the question that 
my friend from Illinois posed. 
The difference from 2 years ago and 
now is that the DOJ has started going 
after concerned parents that are show-
ing up at school board meetings label-
ing them domestic terrorists. 
The difference is that the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security thinks it is 
fitting 
to 
have 
a 
truth 
and 
disinformation board, like something 
from an Orwellian novel. This is a dif-
ferent time. 
Also, in the last 2 years, we had $2 
billion of damage that was caused by 
antifa. Yet, my colleagues across the 
aisle refuse to label antifa a domestic 
terrorist organization. 
Those are just a few of the things 
that have changed between now and 
the last time we had this bill. 
Now, my good friend from New York 
was talking about the oil and gas in-
dustry. Let me just remind everybody 
that in 2020, the oil and gas industry 
lost $76 billion. 
There was talk about buybacks. 
Maybe we should consider why these 
buybacks are occurring. Maybe it is be-
cause of investor shareholder activism 
and this notion of ESGs that has some-
thing to do with it. And by the way, 
that activism also dries up investment 
and capital into the oil and gas indus-
try. 
But don’t take my word for it, Dr. 
Jason Furman of Harvard University— 
clearly no bastion of conservative 
thought—he actually was an adviser to 
President Obama. Listen to what he 
said: ‘‘When more people want to buy 
things than companies are capable of 
making, prices go up. That’s just the 
law of supply and demand. Companies 
always want to maximize their profits. 
I don’t think they’re doing it any more 
this year than any other year.’’ 
Again, that was Jason Furman, not 
exactly a conservative. 
But while we are talking about all 
these issues, we are also failing to talk 
about police week. It is National Police 
Week. Across our Nation, police de-
partments are struggling to recruit 
new officers, to fill open positions. 
Some cities are facing shortages as 
high as 17 percent. At the same time, 
our Nation is in the midst of a crime 
crisis with homicide rates up 48 percent 
compared with just 2 years ago. 
The crime crisis is a direct result of 
President Biden and the Democrats’ ef-
forts to demonize the police, to defund 
the police, and also pushing for soft-on- 
crime policies. 
House Republicans will always stand 
with our police. We will always invest 
in our Nation’s law enforcement, and 
we will always fight to make our com-
munities safer. 
That is why, if we defeat this pre-
vious question, I will personally offer 
an amendment to the rule to imme-
diately consider the Communities De-
serve Cops Act. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the RECORD, along 
with any extraneous materials imme-
diately prior to the vote on the pre-
vious question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
BUSTOS). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHER-
FORD), a former sheriff, good friend, 
and the author of this legislation, here 
to explain the amendment. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the 
previous question so that we can imme-
diately consider H.R. 7809, the Commu-
nities Deserve Cops Act. My bill will 
make retention and hiring bonuses al-
lowable for COPS grants. 
Madam Speaker, I spent over 40 years 
in law enforcement, including 12 as 
sheriff, and I know firsthand the chal-
lenges that agencies all across America 
are facing in hiring, training and re-
taining their personnel. However, the 
challenges I faced as sheriff pale in 
comparison to what these agencies face 
today. 
Police departments across America 
are in the middle of a hiring crisis. 
After 
years 
of 
far-left 
politicians 
defunding, 
demoralizing, 
and 
delegitimizing police officers, we are 
seeing now the disastrous results. A re-
cent survey, as was mentioned earlier, 
found some cities are facing shortages 
as high as 17 percent. Just last year, re-
tirements nationwide went up 45 per-
cent. 
And guess what? Violent crime also 
increased in every major city across 
the Northeast almost. Less officers 
equals more crime, plain and simple. 
Madam Speaker, this pattern of re-
tirements and difficulty recruiting new 
officers is unsustainable and will have 
disastrous effects. 
My legislation makes a very small 
but necessary change to how COPS 
grants are utilized. In addition to using 
COPS funding to hire, train, and equip 
officers, agencies will be able to use 
Federal dollars to offer financial bo-
nuses up to $5,000 to keep officers on 
the force and to attract and hire new 
officers. 
I know many of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle claim to support 
law enforcement. So I ask you: Join 
with us in this important moment. 
Join with us in voting ‘‘yes’’ today 
that you will fund and not defund the 
police. 
As we wrap up National Police Week, 
let’s show the police officers across 
America that we have their back. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I do want to just re-
spond briefly to my colleague, Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. I don’t believe domes-
tic terrorism in any form, by any 
side—right, left, center—is acceptable 
in America. And so without regard to 
that, I would say this bill would look 
at all domestic terrorism. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the

a May 17, 2022, New York 
Times article entitled, ‘‘The Right’s 
Violence Problem.’’ 
[From The New York Times, May 17, 2022] 
THE RIGHT’S VIOLENCE PROBLEM 
(By David Leonhardt) 
Over the past decade, the Anti-Defamation 
League has counted about 450 U.S. murders 
committed by political extremists.

Of these 450 killings, right-wing extremists 
committed about 75 percent. Islamic extrem-
ists were responsible for about 20 percent, 
and left-wing extremists were responsible for 
4 percent. 
Nearly half of the murders were specifi-
cally tied to white supremacists. 
As this data shows, the American political 
right has a violence problem that has no 
equivalent on the left. And the 10 victims in 
Buffalo this past weekend are now part of 
this toll. ‘‘Right-wing extremist violence is 
our biggest threat,’’ Jonathan Greenblatt, 
the head of the ADL, has written. ‘‘The num-
bers don’t lie.’’ 
The pattern extends to violence less severe 
than murder, like the Jan. 6 attack on Con-
gress. It also extends to the language from 
some Republican politicians—including Don-
ald Trump—and conservative media figures 
that treats violence as a legitimate form of 
political expression. A much larger number 
of Republican officials do not use this lan-
guage but also do not denounce it or punish 
politicians who do use it; Kevin McCarthy, 
the top House Republican, is a leading exam-
ple. 
It’s important to emphasize that not all 
extremist violence comes from the right— 
and that the precise explanation for any one 
attack can be murky, involving a mixture of 
ideology, mental illness, gun access and 
more. In the immediate aftermath of an at-
tack, people are sometimes too quick to 
claim a direct cause and effect. But it is also 
incorrect to pretend that right-wing violence 
and left-wing violence are equivalent prob-
lems. 
FEARS IN WASHINGTON 
If you talk to members of Congress and 
their aides these days—especially off the 
record—you will often hear them mention 
their fears of violence being committed 
against them. 
Some Republican members of Congress 
have said that they were reluctant to vote 
for Trump’s impeachment or conviction 
partly because of the threats against other 
members who had already denounced him. 
House Republicans who voted for President 
Biden’s infrastructure bill also received 
threats. Democrats say their offices receive 
a spike in phone calls and online messages 
threatening violence after they are criticized 
on conservative social media or cable tele-
vision shows. 
People who oversee elections report simi-
lar problems. ‘‘One in six election officials 
have experienced threats because of their 
job,’’ the Brennan Center, a research group, 
reported this year. ‘‘Ranging from death 
threats that name officials’ young children 
to racist and gendered harassment, these at-
tacks have forced election officials across 
the country to take steps like hiring per-
sonal security, fleeing their homes, and put-
ting their children into counseling.’’ 
There is often overlap between these vio-
lent threats and white supremacist beliefs. 
White supremacy tends to treat people of 
color as un-American or even less than fully 
human, views that can make violence seem 
justifiable. The suspect in the Buffalo mas-
sacre evidently posted an online manifesto 
that discussed replacement theory, a racial 
conspiracy theory that Tucker Carlson pro-
motes on his Fox News show. 
‘‘History has taught us that what begins 
with words ends in far worse,’’ Representa-
tive Liz Cheney, one of the few Republicans 
who have repeatedly and consistently de-
nounced violence and talk of violence from 
the right, wrote on Twitter yesterday. 
A few other Republicans, like Senator Mitt 
Romney, have taken a similar stance. But 
many other prominent Republicans have 
taken a more neutral stance or even em-
braced talk of violence. Some have spoken 
openly about violence as a legitimate polit-
ical tool—and not just Trump, who has done 
so frequently. 
At the rally that preceded the Jan. 6 at-
tack, Representative Mo Brooks suggested 
the crowd should ‘‘start taking down names 
and kicking ass.’’ 
Rick Perry, a former Texas governor, once 
called the Federal Reserve ‘‘treasonous’’ and 
talked about treating its chairman ‘‘pretty 
ugly.’’ During Greg Gianforte’s campaign for 
Montana’s House seat, he went so far as to 
assault a reporter who asked him a question 
he didn’t like; Gianforte won and has since 
become Montana’s governor. 
These Republicans have received no mean-
ingful sanction from their party. 
This Republican comfort with violence is 
new. Republican leaders from past decades, 
like Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole, Howard Baker 
and the Bushes, did not evoke violence. 
‘‘In a stable democracy,’’ Steven Levitsky, 
a Harvard political scientist, told me, ‘‘poli-
ticians unambiguously reject violence and 
unambiguously expel from their ranks anti-
democratic 
forces.’’

wing-mass-shootings.htm. 
Mr. 
MORELLE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
sadly, the horrifying attack in Buffalo, 
New York, this weekend is just the tip 
of the iceberg. 
According to a 2021 report by the 
Anti-Defamation League, there have 
been 450 murders committed by polit-
ical extremists over the last 10 years, 
75 percent attributed to rightwing 
groups, 55 percent of those were tied to 
white supremacists, four percent in the 
report were tied to leftwing suprema-
cists—an amazing amount, 75 percent 
to 4 percent. 
It is appalling to argue that some 
things are fine and there is no need to 
address root causes of violence. I am 
calling on all my colleagues to do 
something about white nationalism, 
calling on all my colleagues to do 
something about domestic terrorism 
before another domestic terror attack 
occurs fueled by hatred, as we wit-
nessed in Buffalo, New York. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I just have to push 
back a little bit on my good friend 
from New York because the facts just 
don’t line up with his argument, re-
spectfully. 
I will give you a great example. Dur-
ing the committee markup, Represent-
ative STEUBE
of Florida offered an 
amendment to strike references to 
white supremacists and neo-Nazis, and 
insert neo-Nazis, white supremacists, 
antifa, 
Black 
Lives 
Matter, 
and 
radicalized social justice organizations. 
So when the Democrats had the 
chance to actually include a whole slew 
of domestic terror organizations, when 
they had the chance, that amendment 
that Representative STEUBE offered, it 
failed on a party-line vote with only 
one Republican joining the Democrats 
in voting ‘‘no.’’ 
b 1515 
While 
Democrats 
refused 
to 
put 
antifa, 
Black 
Lives 
Matter, 
and 
radicalized social justice organizations 
into the definition of ‘‘domestic ter-
rorism,’’ they simultaneously believed 
that concerned parents at school board 
meetings are the domestic terrorists. 
That is the problem, and that is what 
has changed between 2 years and now. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. RICE) to talk 
more about the police. Again, it is Po-
lice Week, and we are doing very little 
talking about the police. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to oppose the pre-
vious question so we can amend the 
rule and immediately consider H.R. 
7809, the Communities Deserve Cops 
Act, which allows for the use of COPS 
grants to provide officers with signing 
and retention bonuses up to $5,000. 
Predictably, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
we 
have seen shocking increases in violent 
crime following the calls from my 
friends across the aisle to defund the 
police. 
This week is National Police Week, a 
time when we should be honoring those 
who put their lives on the line every 
day to keep our communities safe. 
Sadly, we are not taking the oppor-
tunity to vote on legislation to bolster 
law enforcement and decrease violent 
crime. 
Despite House leadership having nu-
merous bipartisan bills to vote on, only 
two bills have been added to the sus-
pension calendar. The Senate Judiciary 
Committee is taking up five bills to-
morrow. 
Representative RUTHERFORD’s legis-
lation provides much-needed assistance 
for agencies to hire and retain officers. 
The COPS grant program is vital to 
law enforcement agencies of all sizes, 
but while it has continued to receive 
funds, it has not been authorized since 
2009. 
I have also introduced a bill with 
Representative SPANBERGER that would 
reauthorize the COPS grant program 
and help low-income, rural agencies 
compete for these grants. It has 53 co-
sponsors on both sides of the aisle. 
More of my Democratic colleagues 
have cosponsored it than Republicans. 
If Speaker PELOSI would allow a vote 
on the floor, it would pass. 
There are many more bipartisan law 
enforcement bills that deserve to see 
the light of day. I hope that, moving 
forward, we can work together to sup-
port the many bipartisan law enforce-
ment bills that deliver targeted solu-
tions to the Nation. 
I ask my colleagues to oppose the 
previous question so that we can pro-
vide the needed support for law en-
forcement agencies. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I must say, and I have the highest re-
gard for my colleague, anyone who 
would equate the Black Lives Matter 
movement and the protests organized 
over the murder of George Floyd with 
white supremacists like the one who 
killed 10 people in Buffalo and targeted

Black Americans, equating that is irre-
sponsible and reprehensible at best. 
Talk about false equivalence. I am 
nearly speechless that we would even 
begin down that road. Maybe that says 
a lot about why the national Repub-
lican effort has changed so dramati-
cally in just 2 years, when this Con-
gress accepted by voice vote the Do-
mestic Terrorism Act that we have be-
fore us.

ber 15, 2021, Washington Post fact 
check article titled ‘‘The false GOP 
claim that the Justice Department is 
spying on parents at school board 
meetings.’’ 
[From the Washington Post, Oct. 15, 2021] 
THE FALSE GOP CLAIM THAT
THE JUSTICE 
DEPT. IS SPYING
ON PARENTS
AT SCHOOL 
BOARD MEETINGS 
(By Salvador Rizzo) 
‘‘Attorney General Garland is weaponizing 
the DOJ by using the FBI to pursue con-
cerned parents and silence them through in-
timidation. Florida will defend the free 
speech rights of its citizens and will not 
allow federal agents to squelch dissent.’’ 
—Florida Gov. Ron Desantis (R), in a 
tweet, Oct. 5 
‘‘Now the FBI is trying to silence parents. 
That’s wrong.’’ 
—Glenn Youngkin, Republican nominee for 
Virginia governor, in a campaign ad, Oct. 13 
Because of a ‘‘disturbing spike’’ in threats 
directed at public school officials, Attorney 
General Merrick Garland issued a memo-
randum this month calling on the FBI and 
federal prosecutors to meet with local law 
enforcement agencies and set up ‘‘dedicated 
lines of communication.’’ 
Republicans are sounding the alarm over 
Garland’s one-page memo, claiming in inter-
views, congressional hearings, campaign ads 
and social media that the Justice Depart-
ment is cracking down on parents simply for 
dissenting at their local school board meet-
ings. 
These meetings, where the nation’s almost 
14,000 public school districts debate and set 
their policies, can become heated over ques-
tions such as how to teach race in the class-
room and whether coronavirus vaccinations 
and tests or face masks should be required, 
among other issues. Some school board mem-
bers have grown concerned for their safety as 
their forums have turned more vitriolic, and 
one recently reported a death threat and re-
signed. 
The bottom line is Republicans are reading 
much more into Garland’s memo than it 
says. The memo focuses strictly on ‘‘vio-
lence, threats of violence, and other forms of 
intimidation and harassment’’—all of which 
are crimes—not on parents raising questions 
or complaints. 
THE FACTS 
The Oct. 4 memo, addressed to FBI Direc-
tor Christopher A. Wray and federal prosecu-
tors, reads in part: 
In recent months, there has been a dis-
turbing spike in harassment, intimidation, 
and threats of violence against school ad-
ministrators, board members, teachers, and 
staff who participate in the vital work of 
running our nation’s public schools. While 
spirited debate about policy matters is pro-
tected under our Constitution, that protec-
tion does not extend to threats of violence or 
efforts to intimidate individuals based on 
their views. 
Threats against public servants are not 
only illegal, they run counter to our nation’s 
core values . . . . The Department takes 
these incidents seriously and is committed 
to using its authority and resources to dis-
courage these threats, identify them when 
they occur, and prosecute them when appro-
priate . . . . 
Coordination and partnership with local 
low enforcement is critical to implementing 
these measures for the benefit of our no-
tion’s nearly 14,000 public school districts. 
To this end, I am directing the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation, working with each 
United States Attorney, to convene meetings 
with federal, state, local, Tribal, and terri-
torial leaders in each federal judicial district 
within 30 days of the issuance of this memo-
randum. These meetings will facilitate the 
discussion 
of 
strategies 
for 
addressing 
threats against school administrators, board 
members, teachers, and staff, and will open 
dedicated lines of communication for threat 
reporting, assessment, and response . . . . 
Garland’s memo added, ‘‘In the coming 
days, the Department will announce a series 
of measures designed to address the rise in 
criminal conduct directed toward school per-
sonnel.’’ 
In an accompanying news release, the Jus-
tice Department said, ‘‘Those efforts are ex-
pected to include the creation of a task 
force, consisting of representatives from the 
department’s Criminal Division, National 
Security Division, Civil Rights Division, the 
Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the FBI, 
the Community Relations Service and the 
Office of Justice Programs, to determine how 
federal enforcement tools can be used to 
prosecute these crimes, and ways to assist 
state, Tribal, territorial and local law en-
forcement where threats of violence may not 
constitute federal crimes.’’ 
And: ‘‘The Justice Department will also 
create specialized training and guidance for 
local school boards and school administra-
tors. This training will help school board 
members and other potential victims under-
stand the type of behavior that constitutes 
threats, how to report threatening conduct 
to the appropriate law enforcement agencies, 
and how to capture and preserve evidence of 
threatening conduct to aid in the investiga-
tion and prosecution of these crimes.’’ 
Put it all together, and Garland is calling 
for 1) strategy meetings between federal and 
local law enforcement, 2) a task force, 3) 
dedicated lines of communication for ad-
dressing threats, and 4) training and guid-
ance for school officials. The news release 
says the Justice Department will study ‘‘how 
federal enforcement tools can be used to 
prosecute these crimes, and ways to assist 
state, Tribal, territorial and local law en-
forcement where threats of violence may not 
constitute federal crimes.’’ (Most violent 
crimes are investigated and prosecuted by 
state and local law enforcement agencies, 
not federal authorities.) 
Some of the Republican officials we asked 
for comment pointed to a letter from the Na-
tional School Boards Association (NSBA) 
that asked President Biden for federal re-
sources to help monitor emerging threats. 
The letter was dated Sept. 29, days before the 
attorney general’s memo was released, and 
made various requests of federal agencies in-
cluding the Justice Department. 
‘‘While local and state law enforcement 
agencies are working with public school offi-
cials in several communities to prevent fur-
ther disruptions to educational services and 
school district operations, law enforcement 
officials in some jurisdictions need assist-
ance—including help with monitoring the 
threat levels,’’ NSBA officials wrote to 
Biden. 
‘‘School board meetings have been dis-
rupted in California, Florida, Georgia, and 
other states because of local directives for 
mask coverings to protect students and edu-
cators from COVID–19,’’ the group’s letter 
says. ‘‘An individual was arrested in Illinois 
for aggravated battery and disorderly con-
duct during a school board meeting. During 
two separate school board meetings in 
Michigan, an individual yelled a Nazi salute 
in protest to masking requirements, and an-
other individual prompted the board to call a 
recess because of opposition to critical race 
theory.’’ 
As noted in the letter, a school board mem-
ber in Ohio received hate mail that said: ‘‘We 
are coming after you and all the members on 
the . . . BoE [Board of Education] . . . . You 
are forcing them to wear mask—for no rea-
son in this world other than control. And for 
that you will pay dearly.’’ That correspond-
ence is being investigated by police. 
Days after the NSBA letter was sent, a 
school board chairman in North Carolina re-
signed and disclosed that his life had been 
threatened, WCCB Charlotte reported. 
The NSBA letter said some ‘‘acts of mal-
ice, violence, and threats against public 
school officials . . . could be the equivalent 
to a form of domestic terrorism and hate 
crimes.’’ 
‘‘Most disturbingly, on page 4, the NSBA 
letter references Scott Smith—the Loudoun 
County, Virginia, parent who was arrested 
for protesting at a school board meeting in 
June—implying that his behavior was ‘ex-
tremist’ and warranting action from federal 
law enforcement,’’ said Christina Pushaw, a 
spokeswoman for DeSantis. ‘‘Smith’s sup-
posed crime? He attempted to protest a 
Loudoun school’s coverup of his 14-year-old 
daughter’s sexual assault by a transgender 
classmate in her school bathroom.’’ 
According to the Loudoun County Sheriff’s 
Department, in July, more than a month 
after an alleged assault at Stone Bridge High 
School on May 28, ‘‘a 14-year-old male was 
arrested in the case with two counts of forc-
ible sodomy.’’ The same teen reportedly was 
charged with sexually assaulting another al-
leged female victim at a different high 
school last week. 
Smith, the father of the first alleged vic-
tim, was found guilty of disorderly conduct 
and resisting arrest after an altercation at 
his local school board meeting in June, 
which Smith says he attended to protest how 
his daughter’s case was handled. ‘‘Deputies 
dragged him to the ground, then outside, 
where he continued struggling and arguing 
with them, threatening to kick their teeth 
out,’’ Loudoun Now reported. 
‘‘In citing Mr. Smith’s case as an example 
of behavior that justifies a federal crack-
down, the NSBA letter asked the Biden ad-
ministration to deploy federal law enforce-
ment to silence and intimidate parents who 
have grave concerns that deserve to be 
heard,’’ Pushaw said. ‘‘The Loudoun County 
School Board is not the victim in this case.’’ 
The NSBA, a nonprofit, has no relationship 
to the Justice Department. Garland’s memo 
makes no mention of the group, its letter to 
Biden or the examples it included. 
Asked about DeSantis’s vow that ‘‘Florida 
will defend the free speech rights of its citi-
zens and will not allow federal agents to 
squelch dissent,’’ Pushaw said: ‘‘At this 
time, it is too soon to speculate about legal 
actions, because the DOJ has not yet taken 
any legal action to infringe upon Floridians’ 
rights following this memo. As you know, 
the DOJ memo directs the FBI to work with 
U.S. attorneys and ‘convene meeting’ in each 
federal judicial district . . . . To be clear, 
Governor DeSantis is committed to pro-
tecting Floridians’ rights and will take legal 
action if future developments warrant that.’’ 
A spokesman for Jordan, Russell Dye, said 
in an email that the only way the Justice 
Department could use ‘‘its authority and re-
sources to discourage these threats, identify

them when they occur, and prosecute them 
when appropriate,’’ as the memo says, was 
by monitoring parents at school board meet-
ings, as the congressman said. 
‘‘The only reasonable explanation is to 
have the FBI/DOJ watch what parents say at 
meetings and intimidate them into silence,’’ 
Dye said. ‘‘Pretty easy to understand.’’ (The 
FBI simply could get tips from local offi-
cials, as Garland’s memo envisions.) 
Mark Bednar, a spokesman for McCarthy, 
said existing laws already establish criminal 
penalties for violence or threats as outlined 
in the memo. Bednar said the Justice De-
partment’s move was heavy-handed and 
could have a chilling effect on parents who 
might otherwise speak up about their chil-
dren’s education. 
‘‘Localized threats of violence are appro-
priately handled by local law enforcement,’’ 
Bednar said. ‘‘As such, the real question is 
why the Biden administration used the 
power of the federal government to publicly 
threaten ‘a series of measures’ aimed at ad-
dressing local school board meetings . . . . 
The unnecessary, ominous rhetoric from the 
DOJ’s memo could have a chilling effect on 
parents’ First Amendment engagement with 
their local schools.’’ 
Garland spokesman Anthony Coley re-
ferred us to this line in the Justice Depart-
ment memo: ‘‘While spirited debate about 
policy matters is protected under our Con-
stitution, that protection does not extend to 
threats of violence or efforts to intimidate 
individuals based on their views.’’ 
Coley also pointed to recent Senate testi-
mony by Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. 
Monaco, the second-highest-ranking official 
at the department, and Assistant Attorney 
General Kristen M. Clarke, the head of the 
Civil Rights Division. 
‘‘Frankly, I don’t think we’ve ever seen 
anything like it in American history . . . . 
Are you aware of any time in American his-
tory when an attorney general has directed 
the FBI to begin to intervene in school board 
meetings—local school board meetings?’’ 
Hawley asked Monaco at a Senate Judiciary 
Committee hearing Oct. 5. 
‘‘The memorandum is quite clear. It’s one 
page,’’ Monaco said. ‘‘And it asks the U.S. 
attorney community and the FBI special 
agents-in-charge to convene state and local 
law enforcement partners to ensure that 
there’s an open line of communication to ad-
dress threats, to address violence—and that’s 
the appropriate role of the Department of 
Justice, to make sure that we are addressing 
criminal conduct and violence.’’ (A spokes-
man for Hawley did not respond to our ques-
tions on the record.) 
When the same Senate committee met the 
next day for a different hearing, Clarke said 
in response to questions from Sen. Ted Cruz 
(R–Tex.) that parents ‘‘have the right to ex-
press their view, to challenge the school 
board, to ask for reforms.’’ 
‘‘The attorney general’s memo deals with 
threats against public servants and says the 
threats against public servants are not only 
illegal, they run counter to our nation’s core 
values,’’ Clarke said. 
Youngkin, the Republican running for Vir-
ginia governor, received a ‘‘Pants on Fire’’ 
rating from PolitiFact this week for claim-
ing 
his 
Democratic 
opponent, 
Terry 
McAuliffe, ‘‘calls in his friend Joe Biden to 
actually put the DOJ on Virginia parents.’’ 
No 
evidence 
indicates 
that 
Biden 
or 
McAuliffe were involved in Garland’s deci-
sion-making, and both the White House and 
McAuliffe have denied the allegation. 
Nevertheless, Youngkin repeated the claim 
at an Oct. 13 rally in Culpeper, Va., after he 
had been fact-checked: ‘‘He calls his friend 
Joe Biden. Joe Biden calls the attorney gen-
eral. And the attorney general calls the FBI 
in to silence parents.’’ An abbreviated 
version of all this has made it into a new 
Youngkin campaign ad. 
Asked about the claim, Youngkin spokes-
man Matt Wolking said in an email that 
McAuliffe had refused to take a position on 
Garland’s memo and therefore ‘‘admitted he 
won’t stand up for Virginia parents being 
targeted and intimidated by his party’s 
DOJ.’’ 
THE PINOCCHIO TEST 
These Republicans are turning a one-page 
memo on public safety into a dystopian plot 
in which Big Brother erases well-meaning 
parents for thinking freely. 
The reality is school officials are reporting 
more 
concerns 
for 
their 
safety—some 
attendees at their meetings have been ar-
rested for physical violence—and the Justice 
Department is calling for strategy sessions 
between federal and local law enforcement, a 
task force and dedicated lines of communica-
tion to address the threats, and training for 
school board members and others who might 
be targeted. 
Dissenting parents would not be ‘‘silenced’’ 
by the feds under the attorney general’s 
memo, as DeSantis, and Youngkin have said. 
Garland wrote, ‘‘While spirited debate about 
policy matters is protected under our Con-
stitution, that protection does not extend to 
threats of violence or efforts to intimidate 
individuals based on their views.’’ 
These claims earn Four Pinocchios. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, we 
have heard this argument time and 
time again. It is blatantly incorrect. 
Attorney General Garland’s October 4 
one-page memo they keep referencing 
says: ‘‘In the coming days, the Depart-
ment will announce a series of meas-
ures designed to address the rise in 
criminal 
conduct 
directed 
toward 
school personnel.’’ Let me repeat it, 
‘‘criminal 
conduct 
directed 
toward 
school personnel.’’ Criminal, not par-
ents voicing opinions at a school board 
meeting. 
We are talking about violent, cred-
ible threats being made to some of our 
country’s most important public serv-
ants and their families. 
The reality is, school officials are re-
porting more concerns for their safety, 
as some attendees at their meetings 
have been arrested for physical vio-
lence. The Justice Department is call-
ing for strategy sessions between Fed-
eral and local law enforcement, a task 
force and dedicated lines of commu-
nication to address the threats, and 
training for school board members and 
others who might be targeted. No 
intervention, no targeting free speech. 
My wife retired after 30 years as a 
schoolteacher. I can’t imagine threats 
being directed toward schoolteachers 
and school personnel for simply doing 
their jobs and carrying out the best in-
terests of children in this country. 
They are being targeted in violent 
ways. It is as simple as that. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I have a lot of respect for my good 
friend from New York, but, again, facts 
don’t care about friendships. If you 
look at the facts, and just a quick his-
tory lesson, on September 29, 2021, the 
National School Boards Association 
sent a letter to the Biden White House 
asking the administration to treat par-
ents as terrorists. Madam Speaker, 5 
days after that letter, which, again, 
asks Biden’s DOJ to treat parents as 
domestic terrorists, 5 days later, Attor-
ney General Garland sent a memo to 
the Director of the FBI, directing the 
FBI to work with each U.S. attorney to 
convene meetings with Federal, local, 
and territorial leaders within 30 days of 
the issuance of the memo and to open 
dedicated lines of communication for 
threats reported at school board meet-
ings. Just a few weeks after that, they 
created a threat tag to be used on par-
ents. 
Fast forward, during a markup in the 
Judiciary Committee, Judiciary Re-
publicans expressed concerns that H.R. 
350 will codify what took place last 
fall, treating parents as domestic ter-
rorists. 
To date, that memo has not been re-
scinded. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MORELLE) to see if he supports the ac-
tions of the Attorney General, if he 
supports the letter, and if he has any-
thing to say in response. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman yielding to 
me. 
I would say this: This is beyond ab-
surd. Parents can speak out at school 
board meetings. Free speech in the 
United States is not only protected, we 
would be the first to protect it, on this 
side of the aisle. 
What is not acceptable at school 
board meetings or any other place are 
direct threats made by people directed 
at school personnel, school officials, 
teachers, or anyone else in our citi-
zenry, our democracy, and our commu-
nity. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, reclaiming my time, the ques-
tion was simple. It is on the issue of 
the memoranda, whether or not my 
colleague agreed that the FBI should 
treat parents as domestic terrorists. 
The letter has not been rescinded. It 
is still in place, and the actions of the 
Attorney General and the DOJ are ir-
refutable. Again, I point to the fact 
that that letter has still not been re-
scinded. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
GUEST) to elaborate more on this mat-
ter. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, Scrip-
tures tell us: ‘‘Blessed are the peace-
makers, for they shall be called chil-
dren of God.’’ 
As Police Week comes to a close, it is 
important that we continue to thank 
our law enforcement officers that pro-
tect our communities and tackle the 
huge recruiting and retention issues 
that our police departments are seeing. 
At a time when violent crime is at an 
all-time high, and our police depart-
ments are understaffed and overworked

May 18, 2022 
because of the impact of the defund the 
police movement and antipolice rhet-
oric, it is more important than ever 
that we support our law enforcement 
officers. 
Former President Ronald Reagan 
once said: ‘‘There can be no more noble 
vocation than the protection of one’s 
fellow citizens. . . . No single group is 
more fully committed to the well-being 
of their fellow Americans and to the 
faithful discharge of duty than our law 
enforcement.’’ Law enforcement, we 
know, lives by creed. That creed is to 
serve and to protect. 
Sheriff Rutherford’s bill, H.R. 7809, 
would help law enforcement accom-
plish that mission. It would put law en-
forcement back into our communities 
and take criminals off the streets by 
allowing Federal grant dollars to offer 
a $5,000 hiring and retention bonus to 
law enforcement officers. 
I am grateful for the men and women 
of law enforcement and for their serv-
ice, and I will continue to work with 
these heroes to see that our commu-
nities are safe places to live, to wor-
ship, and to raise a family. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
think the bill which the gentleman ref-
erences 
was 
just 
introduced. 
We 
haven’t had a markup or discussion, 
but I do note he should read his own 
bill. It says ‘‘up to $5,000,’’ which can 
be anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000, so I 
think he misunderstood the bill that he 
has introduced. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
MALLIOTAKIS), my good friend. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to oppose the previous question 
so we can immediately consider H.R. 
7809, the Communities Deserve Cops 
Act, to get police back on the force and 
criminals off our streets. 
Police departments across the coun-
try are struggling to hire and retain 
new recruits to keep up with the pace 
of retirements and resignations. 
Officer morale has been decimated by 
antipolice rhetoric coming from politi-
cians and procrime policies that tie the 
hands of our police, like the disastrous 
bail law of my State where a perp ar-
rested in the morning gets out of jail 
before the police officer even finishes 
his shift. 
Crime in America’s cities is sky-
rocketing. It is skyrocketing as a re-
sult of these policies. 
An increase in ambush-style attacks 
against our police has put our officers 
in harm’s way both on and off duty. In 
2021, America saw the most law en-
forcement officers killed in the line of 
duty since 1995. 
An NYPD officer puts their life on 
the line for $46,000 a year. My home-
town department, the NYPD, has seen 
more than 5,700 retirements over the 
last 3 years because politicians have 
made it impossible for them to do their 
job. 
Nationally, retirements are up 45 per-
cent, and resignations are up 18 per-
cent, creating a dangerous situation in 
cities like mine that finished 2021 with 
the highest homicide rate in a decade. 
The Communities Deserve Cops Act 
would allow law enforcement agencies 
to use Federal grant dollars to offer 
hiring and retention bonuses to our po-
lice officers. It would increase re-
sources for our police at a time when 
too many politicians, including those 
in this Chamber, are looking to strip 
away resources. 
It is unfortunate that legislation like 
this even needs to be considered. The 
endemic problems surrounding our po-
lice are a direct result of a systematic 
targeting of those who protect us by 
progressive politicians. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentlewoman. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
earlier this Congress, I offered a resolu-
tion condemning calls to defund, abol-
ish, or dismantle our police, and guess 
what? Every one of our colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle voted against 
it. This is the problem. 
When our police departments are 
understaffed and overworked, Congress 
must step up to provide them with the 
tools they need to effectively do their 
job. 
In this year’s Federal budget, I 
fought to get millions of dollars for the 
NYPD’s K9 unit, forensic equipment, 
and protective gear. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
critically important piece of legisla-
tion to give our brave men and women 
in blue the respect and the support 
they need to do their jobs and keep our 
communities safe. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
suggest to the gentlewoman that she 
support this bill, which provides train-
ing and resources to assist State, local, 
and Tribal law enforcement agencies in 
understanding, 
detecting, 
deterring, 
and investigating acts of domestic ter-
rorism, as we saw demonstrated just 
this past weekend in our State, a State 
that she and I both live in, in Buffalo, 
New York, where members of the Buf-
falo Police Department faced great 
danger. 
These are the kind of resources we 
want to give, the kind of resources em-
bodied in this bill, the kind of re-
sources that the bill envisioned 2 years 
ago when Members of this House by 
voice vote approved this bill. 
We want and welcome their support 
for this bill. Let’s get at it, and let’s 
make sure that we are really helping 
law enforcement at the local level, at 
the State level, and at the Federal 
level deal with the emerging threats of 
domestic violence and domestic ter-
rorism. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1530 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Ms. HER-
RERA BEUTLER), my good friend and fel-
low appropriator. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to urge defeat of 
the previous question so we can protect 
and support local police departments 
to help them hire and retain more offi-
cers. It is that simple. 
Over the past year we have seen a 
dramatic rise in crime in communities 
across our Nation. And the district I 
serve, my home in southwest Wash-
ington, hasn’t been spared. Not a day 
goes by without a local paper depicting 
another carjacking, killing, burglary, 
or assault. These are on the rise. 
When you meet with our local law 
enforcement, as I have, they have been 
sounding the alarm for well more than 
a year. Then consider the phrase that 
we have all heard repeated by politi-
cians across this country and in this 
town: Defund the police. 
In States like mine, Washington, so- 
called police reform laws have made it 
harder for police to catch criminals 
and do their jobs. Place yourself in the 
shoes of a law enforcement officer who 
puts her life on the line every single 
day. It is no wonder that honorable in-
dividuals have left the profession in 
droves. 
One county sheriff’s department in 
my region announced that deputies 
would no longer be able to respond to 
certain crimes like theft of property, 
stolen vehicles, and more, due to the 
laws that are trying to defund police. 
This is deeply concerning. We must act 
now to help shore up our police forces 
to keep our cities and streets safe. 
The Communities Deserve Cops Act 
will help reverse staffing shortages by 
providing and signing retention bo-
nuses for police officers. It is time to 
stop chasing individuals away from the 
profession of policing, which is exactly 
what we have been doing, and the Com-
munities Deserve Cops Act will help 
bring folks back into law enforcement. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the pre-
vious question so the House can bring 
up this legislation to improve it, to 
help hire and retain police officers, to 
shore up our police departments, and 
help keep our communities safe. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
don’t want to belabor what I have said 
repeatedly. What we saw last week and 
what we continue to see around the 
country as it relates to domestic ter-
rorism deserves and demands our at-
tention, 
and 
the 
seriousness 
with 
which the American people have trust-
ed us, the responsibility of finding so-
lutions to these problems. 
I appreciate my colleagues may not 
support that. They may not want to 
stand with us as we try to fight domes-
tic terrorism and the rise of white su-
premacy. They may not want to ad-
dress members of the Black commu-
nity in Buffalo being targeted, and 
members of the Black community in 
Rochester being targeted, and people 
around the country being targeted. 
But to continue to avoid the question 
and create misdirection, I think people

May 18, 2022 
tuning in would have a hard time un-
derstanding what it is we are doing. 
Let’s be clear. We are trying to ad-
dress, in the most serious way we pos-
sibly can, the rise of domestic ter-
rorism. We are asking for support for 
our Federal agencies to get them bet-
ter coordinated. We are asking for 
more resources for State and local law 
enforcement agencies to confront these 
challenges. 
If you don’t want to stand with us; 
that is okay. If you want to go back 
and tell people back home why you 
don’t think domestic terrorism—which 
rises—demands the attention of the 
Congress; that is okay. But continuing 
to come and try to create misdirection, 
and to continue to try to confuse peo-
ple about what is going on is a dis-
service to the millions of Americans 
who give us the awesome responsibility 
of watching out for their communities 
and their families. 
Let’s just be clear about what we are 
doing today and what the choices are 
and what the vote is and what the bill 
is before the House. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ROY), my good 
friend. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania. I would just note, my colleagues 
are talking about what we are actually 
here to talk about. We are talking 
about the concern about Black Ameri-
cans. How about the fact that in Chi-
cago we had 800 homicides last year. 
How about in Philadelphia, 562 homi-
cides. How about in D.C., 227 homi-
cides. How about in Austin, we had 89 
homicides. The 12 major cities that 
broke homicide records in 2021 all have 
Democratic mayors. 
Now, Democrats on the other side of 
the aisle want to politicize what should 
be a bipartisan approach to figure out 
how to combat crime, the very crime 
that has been created by the policies of 
our Democratic friends on the other 
side of the aisle. That is the truth and 
that is what we know. 
The gentleman from New York is 
talking about what is going on with re-
spect to domestic terrorism. The fact 
of the matter is, we know the truth. He 
asked what is different? Well, the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania answered 
what is different. We know precisely 
what is different, which is that this De-
partment of Justice is targeting Amer-
icans, like Scott Smith, a father in 
Loudon County, Virginia, who dared to 
go to the school board and complain 
about the assault of his daughter in a 
public school. 
Now, the gentleman from New York 
is smirking—smirking about a little 
girl who was raped in a high school. 
The father goes to complain to the 
school board, and then the National 
School Boards Association coordinates 
with the Department of Justice to fig-
ure out how to target parents; to then 
tag 
individuals 
specifically 
as 
to 
whether or not they are threatening 
people by merely going to a school 
board to register their complaint. 
That is what is at stake here. That is 
why we are opposing what Democrats 
are trying to do. Then they want to 
gloss over things like Frank James in 
Brooklyn, a Black nationalist who goes 
in and assaults 30 to 33 people on a sub-
way in New York. That just gets wist-
fully wiped away while the gentleman 
wants to politicize that which we 
should be coming together to figure 
out how to save the American people 
from the harm befalling them. 
That is what is going on with the 
rule here. I will talk about energy 
later. The rule here is bad for the 
United States of America, and we 
should be protecting the people here 
during cop week. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
find it incredibly insulting that anyone 
would suggest that I would smirk 
about the rape of a 10-year-old girl. I 
find it disgusting. I find the gentleman 
should offer an apology. 
This is a serious matter. That is why 
we are here. We have solemn obliga-
tions. We should take them seriously. 
No ranting is necessary. No accusa-
tions. And certainly not insults being 
thrown about on the floor of the House 
of Representatives. I am incredibly dis-
mayed that the gentleman would say 
anything even remotely like that. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have no further speakers at 
this time, and I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, for over 3 years, 
House Democrats have pushed for a 
radical, far left agenda that does abso-
lutely nothing to address the serious 
issues facing American families. The 
legislation made in order under today’s 
rule is no exception to that. 
H.R. 350 adds bureaucracy and adds 
red tape to existing law enforcement 
resources, while completely ignoring 
new and evolving terrorist threats. 
H.R. 7688, this is the Democrats’ so-
cialist energy price-fixing scheme that 
will actually lead to less energy pro-
duction and further exacerbate Amer-
ican families’ pain at the pump. 
Finally, H.R. 7790, does nothing—I re-
peat, nothing—to put more formula on 
store shelves or hold Biden’s FDA ac-
countable for ignoring this crisis de-
spite knowing about it for the last 
year. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple deserve more than empty promises 
and meaningless legislation, they de-
serve action. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all of my 
colleagues for their words in support of 
the rule before us today. As I men-
tioned earlier, we have before us rel-
atively simple measures that take ac-
tion to both support working families 
and protect our communities from do-
mestic terrorism and violent extre-
mism. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle can attempt to misdirect and 
confuse and make accusations and hurl 
insults all they want, but the reality is 
we are presenting concrete proposals to 
address issues facing our Nation that 
should be noncontroversial. 
The Domestic Terrorism Prevention 
Act will allow law enforcement to bet-
ter deter acts of domestic terrorism. 
The Consumer Fuel Price Gouging 
Prevention Act will ensure that Big Oil 
cannot record historic profits at the 
expense of everyday Americans. 
The Infant Formula Supplemental 
Appropriations Act will help provide 
much needed relief for parents strug-
gling to find formula for their children. 
I look forward to supporting all three 
bills on the floor. I appreciate my col-
leagues. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the previous question. 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1124 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
7809) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control 
and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to provide for 
law enforcement officer bonuses. All points 
of order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The bill shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
bill are waived. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the bill and on 
any amendment thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except: (1) one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2)

May 18, 2022 
SEC. 6. FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR ADDRESSING 
HATE CRIME INCIDENTS WITH A 
NEXUS TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM. 
(a) COMMUNITY
RELATIONS
SERVICE.—The 
Community Relations Service of the Department 
of Justice, authorized under section 1001(a) of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000g), 
may offer the support of the Service to commu-
nities where the Department of Justice has 
brought charges in a hate crime incident that 
has a nexus to domestic terrorism. 
(b) FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.—Sec-
tion 249 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(f) FEDERAL BUREAU
OF INVESTIGATION.— 
The Attorney General, acting through the Di-
rector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
shall assign a special agent or hate crimes liai-
son to each field office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation to investigate hate crimes inci-
dents with a nexus to domestic terrorism (as 
such term is defined in section 2 of the Domestic 
Terrorism Prevention Act of 2022).’’. 
SEC. 7. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
Nothing in this Act, or any amendment made 
by this Act, may be construed to authorize the 
infringement or violation of any right protected 
under the First Amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States or an applicable provision 
of Federal law. 
SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
There are authorized to be appropriated to the 
Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, the Department of Homeland Se-
curity, and the Department of Defense such 
sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on the Judiciary 
or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. NADLER). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 350. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in 2018, a gunman shot 
and killed 11 worshippers attending 
Shabbat services at the Tree of Life 
synagogue in Pittsburgh. In 2019, an-
other gunman shot and killed 22 shop-
pers at an El Paso Walmart. Over the 
weekend, yet another assailant alleg-
edly shot and killed 10 people at a su-
permarket in Buffalo, New York. 
These are tragedies. I could cite 
many others. I could spend my time 
here today talking about the scourge of 
gun violence, or the dramatic rise in 
the number of hate crimes, or the obvi-
ous consequences of the hate-filled 
rhetoric that fills our airways and has, 
sadly, been adopted by some of our col-
leagues. 
Instead, I will use my time to point 
out what these three cases have in 
common: The gunman in each case was 
a White man, each angry about so- 
called replacement theory, each trav-
eling some distance to target a minor-
ity community, each hoping to ter-
rorize that community through mass 
murder. 
This is not right. This is not normal. 
This is not consistent with who we are 
as a country. We must act. H.R. 350, 
the Domestic Terrorism Prevention 
Act, which sits before us today, is the 
least we can do to signal our opposition 
to white nationalism and this rising 
menace of organized intolerance. 
H.R. 350 creates three offices—one 
each within the Department of Home-
land Security, the Department of Jus-
tice, and the FBI—to monitor and in-
vestigate cases of domestic terrorism. 
These newly created offices would 
issue joint biannual reports to Con-
gress assessing the state of domestic 
terrorism threats, with a specific focus 
on white supremacists, and would be 
required to focus their resources based 
on the data collected and the most sig-
nificant threats. 
Recent white supremacist attacks 
have reminded minority communities 
across the country of a dark history we 
have not yet escaped. These include the 
murder of six people of Asian descent 
at spas in Atlanta last summer, five 
Jewish Americans being held hostage 
in their Texas synagogue, numerous 
bomb threats phoned into historically 
Black colleges and universities last 
February, and, of course, the violence 
in Buffalo just days ago. 
Because every part of the country de-
serves a responsive, well-trained re-
sponse to this kind of violence, H.R. 350 
also requires DOJ and DHS to provide 
training and resources to assist State 
and local law enforcement agencies in 
understanding, detecting, and deter-
ring acts of domestic terrorism and 
violent white supremacy. 
And because there should be no con-
fusion that we are targeting criminal 
activity, as opposed to the legitimate 
religious or political activity of most 
citizens, the bill also includes an ex-
plicit protection for First Amendment 
rights and other constitutionally pro-
tected activity. 
This legislation is a bipartisan solu-
tion to a serious and documented prob-
lem facing our country. I thank Rep-
resentative BRAD SCHNEIDER for all of 
his work in introducing it. The House 
stood together last Congress to pass 
this legislation in a bipartisan fashion. 
I urge my colleagues to do so once 
again, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I just want to read from the title of 
the bill. 
‘‘H.R. 350, 117th Congress, 2d Session. 
To authorize dedicated domestic ter-
rorism offices within the Department 
of Homeland Security, the Department 
of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, to analyze and monitor 
domestic terrorist activity and require 
the Federal Government to take steps 
to prevent terrorism.’’ 
Well, we already know what this 
looks like. We have already seen this 
happen. The Department of Justice 
went after parents who showed up at 
school board meetings to voice con-
cerns about what was happening in 
their child’s school. 
Never forget what they did. They put 
in place this apparatus to report, to 
snitch, on parents. 
The timeline here, I think, is so im-
portant. September 29, last fall, the 
leftwing 
political 
organization 
Na-
tional 
School 
Boards 
Association 
writes a letter to the Biden administra-
tion asking exactly what this bill does. 
It says: Use domestic terrorism/coun-
terterrorism measures against parents. 
And guess what. Five days later, the 
Attorney General of the United States 
writes a memorandum that does just 
that, again, what this bill would codify 
and put into practice. He sends out a 
memo to every single U.S. Attorney 
around the country. In that memo, he 
says: Set up a dedicated line for threat 
reporting, a snitch line on parents. 
And guess what happens after that. 
Sixteen days after that, the FBI sends 
out an email to agents all across the 
country saying: When you investigate 
these parents, when you are doing this, 
parents who reported on the snitch line 
the Attorney General established, put 
this designation, this threat tag label, 
on their name. All of that happened, 
and we know it happened, because 
whistleblowers came forward and told 
us about two dozen cases where this 
took place. 
This bill is going to codify exactly 
what they have been doing. That is 
why this bill is so harmful. 
One of the situations, one of the 
cases, a mom who showed up at a 
school board meeting was reported, and 
the person who filed the complaint 
said: Well, she is in the group Moms for 
Liberty, and she owned a firearm. 
Imagine that, a mom who cares about 
freedom and actually exercises her Sec-
ond Amendment liberties. 
Now, what happened in Buffalo we 
know is as wrong as wrong can be, but 
this legislation wouldn’t prevent the 
terrible crime that took place there. 
This bill is the same bad bill that 
Democrats pulled 2 weeks ago because 
a few of them actually had concerns 
about First Amendment protected ac-
tivity and what this legislation could 
do. Again, specifically, it says it wants 
to create new offices to investigate 
folks in our armed services, in our 
military, and in our law enforcement 
for the possibility of infiltration by 
white nationalism. 
b 1815 
But, of course, it says nothing about 
threats from the left, threats like 
antifa. We know what happened the 
summer of 2020. It says nothing about 
that. 
This bill is dangerous because we 
have already seen the weaponization of 
government. We saw it in the IRS a few 
years ago. We have seen it in the FBI,

as I just pointed out, most recently the 
Department of Justice working with 
the FBI to go after parents. This bill 
formalizes what we have already seen. 
That is why it is so dangerous. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, the Anti- 
Defamation League reported after a 
study last year that 80 percent of racist 
violence was from white suprema-
cists—80 percent. Mr. JORDAN should 
take heed of that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. SCHNEI-
DER), the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to rise in support of H.R. 350, the 
Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act of 
2022. I thank the Speaker of the House 
and House leadership for their support 
in taking action to address the very 
real and present threat of domestic ter-
rorism and, specifically, racially moti-
vated violent extremism. 
I am grateful for the leadership of my 
colleague and friend, Judiciary Com-
mittee Chairman JERRY
NADLER, in 
helping to bring forth this bill, and my 
fellow Illinoisan, Senator DICK DURBIN, 
who has been my partner in shep-
herding this legislation since 2017. 
Our Nation is reeling. Just this week-
end, in California, a true hero, as well 
as being a father, husband, and physi-
cian, a true hero saved countless lives 
by sacrificing himself to wrestle down 
a hate-driven gunman inside a church. 
In Buffalo, 10 people were murdered by 
a deranged white supremacist whose 
hate was fueled by the racist, anti-Se-
mitic great replacement conspiracy 
theory. 
I can’t go back in time and stop past 
events. There will be more Buffalos; 
there will be more El Pasos; and there 
will be more Tree of Life synagogue- 
type shootings. Though the shooters 
may have acted alone, these tragedies 
past are a harbinger of what is to fol-
low. 
As Amy Spitalnick with Integrity 
First for America has put it, each at-
tack inspires the next one. Whether it 
is a live-streamed assault or a screed 
posted on the dark web, the goal is not 
just to kill fellow Americans but to in-
spire like-minded haters to act in kind. 
We cannot sit idly by while domestic 
violence extremism spreads across our 
country. We must give Federal law en-
forcement the resources and the tools 
they need to actively identify threats 
and to preemptively act to stop vio-
lence before it happens. 
To my colleagues considering voting 
against this bill, especially those who 
supported this very same legislation in 
the last Congress, I ask them: If not 
this bill, then what? And if not now, 
then when? 
Their inaction only gives cover to 
the next domestic terrorist planning an 
attack. 
Let me be clear: This legislation does 
not create any new statute or establish 
any new penalties. It doesn’t threaten 
civil liberties. In fact, it further pro-
tects First Amendment rights, and it 
helps the FBI, DOJ, and DHS do their 
job. 
In testimony this February before 
the House Judiciary Subcommittee on 
Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Secu-
rity, Seth Jones of CSIS noted there 
were 73 terrorist plots and attacks in 
the U.S. just last year, spanning 18 
States and the District of Columbia. He 
stated: ‘‘Government, military, and po-
lice locations and personnel were the 
most frequently targeted by domestic 
terrorist attacks regardless of perpe-
trator orientation.’’ 
He continued: ‘‘These perpetrators 
identified with a range of ideologies 
and movements, including the QAnon 
conspiracy, the sovereign citizen move-
ment, 
militia 
groups, 
anarchism, 
antifascism, 
environmentalism, 
and 
other 
antigovernment 
and 
antiauthority philosophies.’’ 
And 
he 
continued: 
‘‘In 
addition, 
white supremacists and other like- 
minded extremists have targeted indi-
viduals because of their racial, ethnic, 
religious, or political makeup, such as 
African Americans, immigrants, Mus-
lims, and Jews.’’ 
FBI Director Christopher Wray, in 
testimony before the Senate last year, 
stated that: ‘‘The top threat we face 
from DVEs,’’ domestic violent extrem-
ists, ‘‘continues to be those we identify 
as racially or ethnically motivated vio-
lent extremists, RMVEs, specifically 
those who advocate for the superiority 
of the White race, and who were the 
primary source of ideologically moti-
vated lethal incidents and violence in 
2018 and 2019.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the Domestic Terrorism 
Prevention Act we are voting on today 
is the right bill for this specific mo-
ment. The threat is real. It is growing, 
and if we don’t act, more people—peo-
ple praying in their houses of worship, 
children playing in their schoolyards, 
police officers serving in our commu-
nities—will die. 
We must pass this bill because the 
American people deserve to feel secure 
in their schools, in their supermarkets, 
and in their churches, synagogues, 
temples, and mosques. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we don’t give cover to 
anything. White nationalism is wrong. 
We have always said so. Everyone 
knows that. 
But I tell you who does give cover, 
when the chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee says that antifa is a myth, 
that is giving cover. That is a state-
ment made by the chairman of the 
House Judiciary Committee after we 
had testimony from FBI Director Wray 
talking about the dangers of antifa, 
after Attorney General Barr told us 
that antifa was involved in instigating 
and participating in violent activity. 
Talk about giving cover. Give me a 
break. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. GAETZ), 
my friend and colleague. 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, this bill is 
ostensibly to fight extremism, which 
wouldn’t be so objectionable if the peo-
ple it empowered weren’t so damn ex-
treme. 
They are so extreme, they would 
chill speech at school board meetings 
by targeting parents as domestic ter-
rorists. Obey, accept the mandates, ac-
cept the requirements, the CRT, or you 
will be punished at the hands of your 
own government. 
They are so extreme, they would leak 
a Supreme Court draft opinion so that 
they could gaslight violence and in-
timidation against the Court, all so 
that the law would abandon those un-
born lives and beating hearts. 
They are so extreme, they would 
weaponize the Department of Justice 
against a sitting President over an 
election that Hillary Clinton lost. It 
was the Russians, they told us, and we 
were extreme if we said it was them all 
along. Now we know it was. 
The last press secretary thought that 
COVID discussions on Facebook, rooted 
in science, were so extreme that Mark 
Zuckerberg had to deplatform these 
people, take them away from the dig-
ital world. This press secretary wrong-
ly tweeted that FOX News is racist. I 
wonder if she thinks all of FOX’s view-
ers are dangers to the American people. 
Are you a domestic extremist? This 
bill is about whether or not you want 
the Department of Homeland Security 
looking over your shoulder at the 
shows you watch, the websites you 
visit, some politically incorrect meme 
you liked, some joke you forwarded, 
and any bad association you might 
have had. If you are not a racist, 
maybe your neighbor is, and you 
weren’t antiracist enough to disallow 
it. 
These things aren’t criminal, of 
course. They are bad politics, at worst, 
in most cases, which is exactly the 
point of this bill. They are trying to 
deploy criminal, even antiterrorism, 
authorities against what they deem is 
bad politics. 
How long until mainstream Christi-
anity is deemed domestic extremism? 
All the domestic extremists, they de-
clare their pronouns. So if you don’t 
declare your pronouns, maybe you are 
a domestic extremist, too. 
Under this bill, how long until 
Facebook jail means a government file 
on you, a higher interest rate on your 
home loan, or your spouse fired from 
their job? 
At first, I was a critic of the 
disinformation board, but it might go 
down as one of the most efficient gov-
ernment entities in all of history. It 
took only one action, and it actually 
shut down disinformation by pausing 
its own activities. 
The worst part of this bill is how it 
puts a target on the back of every one 
of our military servicemembers. This 
bill will sic the FBI on our military, 
not to prevent or investigate crimes, 
but to prosecute thought crimes. 
The problem with our military is 
wokeness at the Pentagon, not white

supremacy in the ranks. Even the 
much-maligned Lloyd Austin admitted 
that 99 percent are doing the right 
thing. A recent DOD report showed 
that less than 100 people in the force of 
2 million were problematic in any way. 
We seem so intent on a neo-Nazi 
witch hunt in our own battalions while 
we freely send $40 billion, much of 
which will end up in the hands of the 
Azov Battalion, without much inquiry. 
I am sincerely worried about domes-
tic extremism, but from my vantage 
point, it is coming from America’s po-
litical left. You should really think 
about that, how domestic extremism is 
truly in the eye of the beholder, per-
haps the beholder of power, and power 
is about to change hands. Who will be 
the domestic extremists then? 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
understand how you can look at the 
devastation in Buffalo and the mani-
festo left behind by the terrorist and 
not take this issue seriously. 
I now yield 3 minutes to the distin-
guished gentleman from South Caro-
lina (Mr. CLYBURN), the whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Domes-
tic Terrorism Prevention Act. 
It is heartbreaking to stand here 
today, just days after 10 innocent lives 
were taken in a Buffalo, New York, 
grocery store by a gunman espousing 
white supremacist views and hatred to-
ward African Americans. 
This devastating massacre took me 
back to June 17, 2015, when another 
white supremacist gunned down nine 
parishioners at Charleston’s historic 
Emanuel AME Church. 
In the intervening years, we have 
witnessed far too many other acts of 
domestic terrorism: from a counterpro-
test in Charlottesville, Virginia; to a 
synagogue 
in 
Pittsburgh, 
Pennsyl-
vania; to a Walmart in El Paso, Texas; 
to a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wis-
consin; and to an Asian-owned nail 
salon in Atlanta, Georgia. All told, 
over 200 mass shootings this year. 
To be sure, all of these shootings 
have not been racially motivated or 
motivated by hate, but all of them 
share one thing in common: They have 
been committed in a country too toler-
ant of irresponsible regulations of 
weapons of war and a proliferation of 
firearms of mass destruction. 
This legislation is long overdue. It 
would enable the Justice Department, 
the Department of Homeland Security, 
and the FBI to prevent, investigate, 
and prosecute cases of domestic ter-
rorism more effectively. 
I, and many others in this body, 
know what it is to experience acts of 
racial hatred and witness events of do-
mestic terrorism. We cannot continue 
to turn a blind eye to white suprema-
cist vigilantes. 
It impacts all of us. While the gun-
man in Buffalo was aiming for people 
who looked like me, others who did not 
look like me fell victim to his evil act. 
Shortly after my first meeting with 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., back in 
1960, I met with one of my professors, 
Mrs. Rosa Harris, to share the Saul to 
Paul transformation I was experi-
encing. Two days later, Mrs. Harris 
handed me a copy of Dr. King’s 1958 
book, ‘‘Stride Toward Freedom.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from South Carolina. 
Mr. CLYBURN. To share one passage 
from that book, I quote, ‘‘True peace is 
not merely the absence of tension; it is 
the presence of justice.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation will 
provide Federal agencies with nec-
essary tools to ensure that peace and 
justice prevail. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
from all Members of this august body. 
b 1830 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this bill. 
I find it shocking to hear language 
coming from my colleagues across the 
aisle accusing Republicans of the hor-
rific shooting in Buffalo, when in fact, 
the shooter’s manifesto itself stated he 
acted as a lone wolf. No Republican had 
anything to do with that. 
I also find it shocking to hear these 
accusations coming from the party 
that supported BLM riots that caused 
over $2 billion in damages in cities and 
communities across the country. 
Now, when we are talking about iden-
tity politics, we should remind one an-
other that there were 6 people mur-
dered and 62 others injured by a Black 
American who drove his car through a 
Christmas parade in Waukesha. There 
was also a Black American that shot 
and injured 23 people on a New York 
City subway. I am not hearing any of 
those examples as domestic terrorism 
from my colleagues across the aisle, 
and I don’t understand why. I think 
these acts should be blamed on the peo-
ple that are doing them, not on peo-
ple’s identity and their skin color. 
Another thing that is wrong with 
this bill is it provides unlimited money 
to profile Americans that the Depart-
ment of Justice says are white su-
premacists. That is why Democrats 
want to pursue every single conserv-
ative in America, simply because they 
want to choose who is a white su-
premacist and not. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, the Speaker, herself, has called Re-
publicans enemies of the State. 
If the Speaker does not like Repub-
licans’ politics and considers us en-
emies of the State, we all know what 
domestic terrorists will mean to Demo-
crats. That will mean anyone who 
stands in their way in their lustful 
quest for power. This would be parents 
that are trying to hold people account-
able with their tax dollars for how 
their children are taught, or anyone 
else that they want to blame for some-
thing they want to use for politics. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), a member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the Domestic Ter-
rorism Prevention Act of 2021. 
We are at an important crossroads in 
this country. With white supremacy on 
the rise and violent extremists fueling 
each other’s bigotry and hate, we are 
seeing an alarming increase in domes-
tic terrorism fueled by this hatred. 
A recent analysis from the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies 
showed that in 2020, domestic terrorism 
in America was at its highest level 
since information started being col-
lected nearly 30 years ago. 
In 2019, Michael McGarrity, Assistant 
Director for the Counterterrorism Divi-
sion of the FBI stated that, ‘‘racially 
motivated violent extremists are re-
sponsible for the majority of lethal at-
tacks and fatalities perpetrated by do-
mestic terrorists since 2000.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, we are talking about 
the safety and security of every Amer-
ican, and the targeting of already 
marginalized groups. 
We also witnessed this just days ago 
in Buffalo, when a self-proclaimed 
white supremacist, fascist, and anti- 
Semite targeted the Black community, 
murdering ten victims in a super-
market. 
We saw this last year in Atlanta 
when a gunman attacked Asian women 
in spas. 
We saw it in the bomb threats at 
HBCUs and Jewish synagogues, and as 
terrorists have attacked Black church-
es, synagogues, and Sikh temples. 
We keep seeing it over and over 
again. Congress needs to act. 
We can start today by passing the bi-
partisan Domestic Terrorism Preven-
tion Act. This legislation will create 
offices at the DOJ, FBI, and DHS to 
monitor, investigate, and prosecute 
cases of domestic terrorism, a long- 
overdue update to not only help pre-
vent these horrific crimes, but to also 
bring perpetrators to justice. 
This bill would also improve and 
streamline 
information-sharing 
and 
training systems between different law 
enforcement agencies, including at the 
local and State level, to better our un-
derstanding of and response to inci-
dents of domestic terrorism and white 
supremacy. 
And finally, it would establish an 
interagency task force to combat white 
supremacist infiltration of our mili-
tary and Federal law enforcement—a 
terrifying trend that we need to com-
bat now before it gets any worse. 
I thank Representative SCHNEIDER 
for introducing this desperately needed 
legislation. I am proud to be an origi-
nal cosponsor. I thank Chairman NAD-
LER for his leadership, and I urge all

my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill. It should be a strong bipar-
tisan vote. Say ‘‘no’’ to white suprem-
acy and domestic terrorism in Amer-
ica. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Here we sit on the floor of the House 
of Representatives, and we are talking 
about allegedly crime. But we are not 
talking about, of the 17,000 homicides 
last year, the 800 homicides in Chicago, 
the 562 homicides in Philadelphia, the 
89 homicides in Austin, Texas—blowing 
away the former record of 59 homi-
cides. In the 12 major cities that broke 
their homicide records in 2021, all have 
Democratic mayors. 
We are seeing it across the country. 
We are seeing the absolute destruction 
of law and order across the United 
States 
of 
America 
through 
the 
defunding of police, through the attack 
on police, as we sit here on National 
Police Week, undermining the ability 
to prosecute bad guys. 
Nobody in this Chamber would say 
we shouldn’t prosecute bad guys. As a 
former Federal prosecutor, sign me up. 
Let’s prosecute bad guys. I am all for 
it. 
But we understand what this is actu-
ally about. We understand what prop-
ping up a domestic terrorism unit in 
this FBI, in this administration’s Fed-
eral Government, what it is all about 
because we saw it in naked display last 
fall. 
We see, through all of the informa-
tion we are getting from whistle-
blowers, we see it in the information 
that we are getting on tags targeting 
parents. We see it in the empowerment 
of the FBI to focus and target parents 
in collusion with the National Associa-
tion of School Boards, in active coordi-
nation with the National Association 
of School Boards, we are seeing the tar-
geting of parents. 
And this isn’t made up. Scott Smith 
is an actual father. He is an actual man 
in Loudoun County, Virginia, who had 
his face put up as the poster child for 
an extremist activity by the FBI to 
target parents in coordination with 
that National Association of School 
Boards. 
If you go back and look at the video 
and you hear Scott Smith’s wife crying 
that her husband was being targeted, 
her husband was being targeted in the 
school board meeting because he dared 
to question the school board when his 
daughter had been sexually assaulted 
in a bathroom at a school he pays taxes 
for her to attend. 
And then this administration had the 
audacity to make him the poster child 
to target parents with the power of the 
FBI. We know this happened. We got 
the information from the school board 
association. We got the whistleblower’s 
account of the tags being used by the 
FBI to do it. 
So as my colleague from Florida 
pointed out about what this is really 
about, it is about empowerment of the 
Federal bureaucracy to target Ameri-
cans. That is what it is about. It is 
questioning that you don’t think right. 
It is the extension of thought crimes 
that is pervasive in this body that will 
allow the government to target us for 
what we believe, inherently under-
mining our fundamental rights as 
Americans to free speech, to freedom of 
association, to be able to engage, to be 
able to talk with each other without 
having our government target us. 
If a bad actor carries out bad acts, 
prosecute him, prosecute her. But you 
have to do that with police that are 
funded. You have to do it with district 
attorneys 
who 
will 
prosecute 
the 
crimes. And you have to be honest 
about saying we need to target crimi-
nals for criminal acts and not thought 
crimes. This is nothing more than em-
powering the Federal Government to 
police thought and speech in the 
United States of America, and we 
should oppose it roundly. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, my col-
leagues across the aisle seem to want 
to talk about everything but the sub-
ject matter of this bill, domestic ter-
rorism. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. MANNING), to talk about 
domestic terrorism. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Domestic Ter-
rorism Prevention Act. Over the week-
end, we witnessed one of the deadliest 
racial attacks in recent memory. A 
man consumed by hateful conspiracy 
theories targeted the Black community 
in Buffalo, killing ten innocent people 
in a grocery store. 
He posted a manifesto that was filled 
with hateful conspiracies and anti-Se-
mitic propaganda, including the racist 
great replacement conspiracy theory 
promoted by white supremacists. White 
supremacy and anti-Semitism are poi-
son to our society. 
Today, with these forces on the rise, 
they are turbocharged by social media 
which 
spreads 
these 
dangerous 
ideologies to more people around the 
world, creating a toxic blend of misin-
formation and hate. 
We can’t afford to look the other way 
when individuals are inspired by hate-
ful ideologies to attack our fellow 
Americans. That is why we must im-
mediately pass the Domestic Terrorism 
Prevention Act to empower our govern-
ment to confront the threat of domes-
tic violent extremism head-on. 
I thank my friend, Representative 
SCHNEIDER, for his tenacity in pursuing 
this important bill, which I am proud 
to cosponsor. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this critical leg-
islation 
to 
combat 
anti-Semitism, 
white supremacy, and all forms of 
hateful violence which threaten all of 
our communities. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, the Demo-
crats’ so-called Domestic Terrorism 
Prevention Act opens the door for the 
Biden administration to continue its 
assault on Americans’ protected polit-
ical speech. 
Since President Biden stepped foot 
into the White House, he has blatantly 
targeted conservatives for exercising 
their First Amendment rights. Wheth-
er it is labeling parents protesting 
COVID–19 mandates and racist cur-
riculum in schools as domestic terror-
ists, holding nonviolent January 6 
protestors in pretrial detention for 
over a year, or creating a radical min-
istry of truth to monitor supposed 
disinformation, the Biden administra-
tion has repeatedly taken aim at polit-
ical dissent from the right. 
And while the Disinformation Gov-
ernance Board is reportedly paused— 
what a hallelujah moment for the Con-
stitution—just the idea alone that the 
Biden administration would institute 
such a board under the Department of 
Homeland 
Security 
should 
concern 
every solitary American citizen. And 
keep in mind that this administration 
has completely ignored the legitimate 
threats posed by dangerous extremist 
groups, such as Antifa on the left. 
Just this week, Biden’s Department 
of Homeland Security claimed law en-
forcement agencies are investigating 
violent threats by pro-abortion extrem-
ists threatening to murder Supreme 
Court Justices or burn down the Su-
preme Court building—but added, ‘‘. . . 
generalized philosophic embrace of vio-
lent tactics does not constitute domes-
tic violent extremism or illegal activ-
ity. . . .’’ 
Really? Hey, DHS, why don’t you 
apply the same standard to January 6 
protestors? The glaring hypocrisy is 
blinding. 
Make no mistake, this legislation is 
a blatant attempt to further transform 
the Department of Justice and Depart-
ment of Homeland Security into polit-
ical weapons, greenlighting additional 
abuse by the Biden administration 
against the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to vote against H.R. 350, and thereby 
protect Americans’ First Amendment 
rights and block the Biden administra-
tion from targeting, monitoring, and 
labeling Americans they fundamen-
tally disagree with as domestic terror-
ists. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
majority leader of the House. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, before I start making 
my remarks, the gentleman who just 
spoke is a member of the Republican 
Party. The Republican National Com-
mittee passed a resolution telling the 
American people—and they passed it 
overwhelmingly—that what they saw 
on January 6 was legitimate political 
discourse.

lost their lives, people were injured,

people in the hallways yelling to hang 
the Vice President of the United States 
and to kill the Speaker of the House. 
Legitimate political discourse. 
b 1845 
Mr. JORDAN. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, is it le-
gitimate political discourse what is 
going on in front of the Supreme Court 
Justices’ homes all last week, maybe 
even as we speak? Was it legitimate po-
litical discourse what took place over 
100 days straight in Portland, Oregon, 
where antifa attacked a Federal court 
building? Was that legitimate political 
discourse as well? 
Mr. HOYER. It was not, when they 
attacked anything. 
You ought to visit the Speaker’s 
home. She has protestors in front of 
her home all the time. All the time, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Legitimate 
political 
discourse 
is 
demonstration; it is speaking out. And 
as a matter of fact, as the gentleman 
knows, we had this bill that raised 
questions by those very concerned— 
meaning all of us—about the legiti-
mate exercising of First Amendment 
rights by all Americans; left, right, and 
in between. The fact of the matter is 
that we worked hard to make sure that 
what the gentleman who previously 
spoke asserted is not true. 
Secondly, Mr. Speaker, I will guar-
antee you that our side of the aisle 
does not condone violence by either the 
left or the right. Violence in and of 
itself should be rejected. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, on January 6 we 
saw what happens when extremist ide-
ology 
disseminated 
online, 
in 
the 
media, and even by elected officials is 
allowed to fester into violent action. 
And I repeat, whether that happens 
from the right or the left is irrelevant. 
What is relevant is the violence and 
the danger that it presents to individ-
uals as well as to property, I would tell 
my friend from Ohio. 
Mr. Speaker, we see far too much 
these days of ideology being trans-
formed into violence, which is never 
acceptable and must not be met with 
silence or acquiescence, or—I would 
tell the gentleman from Ohio—ration-
alization. 
Legitimate political discourse on 
January 6. Absurd. 
In recent days, Mr. Speaker, we have 
watched families mourn those killed in 
horrific acts of hatred in Buffalo, New 
York, where someone who espoused 
white supremacy committed a mass 
shooting targeting African Americans. 
We have also seen this terror in 
places like Atlanta and Laguna Woods, 
California, 
where 
members 
of 
the 
Asian-American community were tar-
geted with deadly violence. We saw it 
in El Paso in 2019 against the Latino 
community and in Pittsburgh in 2018 
against Jewish Americans. 
This resolution does not condemn ex-
tremism on the right or the left. It 
condemns extremism which leads to vi-
olence against people on the right or 
people on the left or people who are 
neither right nor left and are not po-
litically identified as such. 
Indeed, in the aftermath of these 
events, and particularly this week, 
Americans have been learning more 
about the kind of violence-promoting 
and twisted ideologies of hate that pose 
a clear and present danger to our de-
mocracy, to the safety of our commu-
nities, and to the social fabric of our 
country. 
I condemn violence from the left, 
from the middle, and from the right. 
And I would hope my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle would condemn, 
as vigorously, violence from whichever 
quarter it is proposed. One of the worst 
of these, which is known as the ‘‘great 
replacement theory,’’ is no more than a 
centuries-old form of prejudice and big-
otry which holds that minorities are 
conspiring to replace White people. 
This vile and false narrative is, sadly, 
not restricted to the dark and distant 
corners of the internet where extrem-
ists lurk. It has found a foothold in 
mass media and, shockingly, even 
among elected officials and Represent-
atives in this House. 
Many in this House who have had the 
opportunity to condemn this theory 
and those who espouse it have chosen 
silence. That kind of silence, Mr. 
Speaker. Many in this House condemn 
violence from whichever source, as I 
just said. 
It is from that same kind of silence 
that the seeds of dehumanization, per-
secution, and horrific violence were 
planted in Germany in the 1930s. We 
know where that kind of rhetoric leads, 
and we must not allow our Nation to go 
down that path. 
This is one of the most pernicious 
forms of hatred that fuels domestic ter-
rorism in our day. It is incumbent upon 
us as the Representatives of the Amer-
ican people and the guardians of our 
democracy to ensure that those who 
espouse violent, extremist views have 
no place in our government, our mili-
tary, or any position of public trust. 
We have seen published by Members 
of this House images of violence, of 
threats, of killings of one of our Mem-
bers. 
Hopefully, this bipartisan legislation 
will do that and will also equip law en-
forcement with the tools needed to 
identify and stop domestic terrorists— 
the head of the FBI says that our 
greatest danger in America today is do-
mestic terrorism, the head of the FBI— 
including 
white 
supremacists, 
neo- 
Nazis, and other racially motivated ex-
tremists; and do so proactively. 
So everybody on this floor knows, I 
condemn unequivocally, of whatever 
ideological bent there is, people using 
violence to promote their political 
ideas, left or right. 
This legislation also commissions nu-
merous reports on the rising threat to 
domestic extremism that will help 
guide future policymaking on this 
issue. 
Mr. Speaker, to stop these purveyors 
of evil from tearing our country apart, 
we must act decisively, and we must 
act now. 
I thank Representative BRAD SCHNEI-
DER and Chairman JERRY NADLER for 
their leadership on this very important 
issue. 
I know, as I believe every Member of 
this House knows, that extremist vio-
lence can reach anyone, anytime, any-
where, whether it be a place of worship, 
a grocery store, or as we learned last 
year, this very Hall. 
That is why, Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
of my colleagues of whatever political 
persuasion—this does not adopt a polit-
ical persuasion, but it adopts the 
premise that the use of violence and 
hate and bigotry should be shunned by 
all of us. 
Our Constitution provides protection 
for almost any speech that one can 
pursue—almost. Not all, if we place 
others in danger. Not all, but almost 
any speech you can give. We are unique 
in the world in that regard. We protect 
that, and we call it the First Amend-
ment, one of our most important 
amendments. It makes our country 
what it has been: a free and open Na-
tion for discussion and debate. It must 
not devolve into the use of violence, 
the result of death, and the tearing 
apart of our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge each Member to 
support that premise and support this 
resolution. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, the ma-
jority leader of the House just said we 
don’t condone violence by anyone. 
That statement is just not accurate. 
The entire summer of 2020, folks in 
the Democratic Party said rioters and 
looters were peaceful protestors. Re-
publicans have condemned violence 
every time it happened. When it hap-
pened on January 6, we said it was 
wrong. When it happened in the sum-
mer of 2020, we said it was wrong, but 
they didn’t. 
The Democratic chair of the Finan-
cial Services Committee said to the ri-
oters and looters that summer ‘‘get 
more confrontational.’’ The Vice Presi-
dent of the United States supported the 
effort to raise money to bail those riot-
ers and looters out of jail. 
We should condemn all violence, and 
we should prosecute people who com-
mit crimes. We shouldn’t be raising 
bail money to get them out of jail, and 
we shouldn’t be encouraging with the 
comments people make as happened all 
that summer from the Democrats and 
from the left. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR), a member of the 
Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 350, the 
Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. 
Here we are again, reeling from an-
other horrific domestic terrorist at-
tack. This week a racially motivated

shooting in Buffalo, New York, per-
petrated by an avowed white suprema-
cist. 
In 2018, it was the Tree of Life syna-
gogue in Pittsburgh. In April of 2019, it 
was a synagogue in Poway, California. 
On August 3, 2019, it was my commu-
nity of El Paso, Texas. 
After every attack on minority com-
munities by radicalized and heavily 
armed young men who have embraced 
white supremacy, our media and even 
some of our colleagues, leaders in this 
country, refuse to call this violence 
what it is: domestic terrorism. 
H.R. 350 calls on the Department of 
Justice and the Department of Home-
land Security to dedicate resources 
specifically to track and combat the 
growing threat of white supremacy and 
neo-Nazism in the United States. 
H.R. 350 will give communities like 
mine a fighting chance the next time 
an angry racist shares a deranged 
screed online and decides to drive 
hours to attack vulnerable and inno-
cent people at our grocery stores or our 
houses of worship. 
The 
Anti-Defamation 
League 
has 
tracked 450 murders over the last dec-
ade committed by these terrorists. 
Rightwing extremists are responsible 
for over 75 percent of these horrific at-
tacks, and 50 percent of these horrific 
attacks are by white supremacists. 
Mr. Speaker, America has a racism 
problem. America has a hate problem. 
America has a domestic terrorism 
problem. We must address it. The Do-
mestic Terrorism Prevention Act is a 
crucial step in the right direction. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. BISHOP) to control the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP) will control the time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, this bill, or a bill substan-
tially like it, has come up before, and 
it enjoyed substantial bipartisan sup-
port, and now that has changed. Why is 
that? It is because it has become evi-
dent that the majority seeks, for polit-
ical reasons, to conflate the extraor-
dinarily serious issue of domestic ter-
rorism with half of the country with 
their political opposition. 
It is evident that the administration 
has pursued a concocted attack on the 
credibility on the First Amendment ac-
tivity of parents who were engaging in 
First Amendment-protected activism 
in school boards. The administration 
has engaged in a deceitful refusal to 
account for that activity, and whistle-
blower accounts have now revealed 
that, indeed, FBI agents went to inter-
rogate parents over their activism. 
When Members of the majority recite 
events in every one of their comments 
today, 
they 
are 
selective 
and 
mischaracterized. 
b 1900 
They do not mention the Brooklyn 
subway shooter. They do not mention 
the Wisconsin fire bombing. They do 
not 
mention 
Waukesha, 
Wisconsin. 
They do not mention Boulder, Colo-
rado. Why do they not? Why is it so 
consistent that those are not men-
tioned? 
It is exactly the same issue in which 
there is always a focus on a particular 
type of hate—white supremacy. Let me 
tell you something. I have no hesitancy 
to say that the twisted butcher in Buf-
falo, New York, was a white suprema-
cist. More than that, it is evident that 
he was mentally ill. 
That does not mean that Republicans 
writ large are domestic terrorists or 
white supremacists. It is a smear, and 
it is deliberate. Worst of all, this pre-
occupation, to the exclusion of all else, 
that smears the right, smears people 
center right, as racists, white suprema-
cists, is a device, a demagogic device to 
distract from abysmal policy disasters 
led and created by advocacy and policy 
of Democrats. 
The defund police debacle that led to 
a 30 percent increase in homicides—not 
as tragic as 10 or 20 killings of people 
by domestic terrorists on occasions— 
but 5,000 additional homicides a year. 
Do you know what? Sixty-five percent 
of those are suffered by Black Ameri-
cans. 
There 
were 
3,250 
additional 
killings in 2020 and more in 2021. 
The abandonment of the southern 
border that has resulted in a flood of 
fentanyl into the country so that you 
see mass killings by exposure to drugs 
laced with fentanyl; poison coming in 
and killing. The figure of 100,000, they 
tell me, is not current. It is not even 
getting at the essence of the problem. 
Under those circumstances, and hav-
ing committed that sort of policy mal-
practice upon the American people 
with those abysmal results, Democrats 
would bring a partisan bill to the floor 
and conflate the egregious evil of do-
mestic terrorism with some kind of a 
political smear of your political oppo-
sition. What would it take to do that? 
This bill should be bipartisan because 
it is promoted, it is brought, it is 
worked out with the political opposi-
tion. This problem is too significant to 
be cheapened as a political stunt. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, it is hard to over-
state how concerning the problem is 
that has so invaded our politics. We 
have seen in so many ways institu-
tional norms be trampled underfoot in 
this Congress. The metal detectors at 
the door are one example, but they go 
on and on and on. 
The hearing in the Judiciary Com-
mittee today aimed at intimidating 
the United States Supreme Court while 
it is in the midst of a particular deci-
sion is another one. Concepts about 
packing the Court, ideas by Democrats 
to pack the Court by the chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee, and they go 
on and on and on. This one might be 
the worst. 
You wonder what in the world the 
majority may be thinking to turn the 
issue of terrorism—any form of ter-
rorism—into a partisan cudgel. It is be-
yond belief. If this issue returned to a 
nonpartisan posture, you would find 
that Republicans would be pleased to 
join it. It has been grossly distorted 
and turned into a political weapon that 
should never happen. It should never 
happen in this country. It should never 
happen in this Congress. This bill 
should be defeated. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the problem is not 
that the Republican Party is racist, ex-
cept the Republican Party won’t call 
out the racists in its midst. They won’t 
call the insurrection on January 6 of 
last year what it is: an insurrection. 
They call it legitimate public dis-
course. 
It is not legitimate public discourse 
when police officers are attacked, when 
the Members of this House are at-
tacked, when the Members of the Sen-
ate are attacked. That is domestic ter-
rorism. 
Madam Speaker, too many Ameri-
cans have felt the pain and horror of 
domestic terrorism striking in their 
communities. Many of these attacks 
are fueled by white supremacy and ha-
tred targeted at racial and ethnic mi-
norities. We cannot bury our heads in 
the sand and pretend that this problem 
does not exist. We must confront this 
challenge head on. 
That is why I strongly support the 
Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, 
which would identify the greatest do-
mestic terror threats and would con-
centrate law enforcement resources to 
addressing those threats. 
I appreciated the Republicans sup-
porting this last year. Why they won’t 
support 
this—because 
they 
decided 
that terrorism doesn’t have to be ad-
dressed—I don’t know. That is terrible. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 350, the ‘‘Domestic Ter-
rorism Prevention Act of 2022.’’ I am proudly 
supporting this critical measure and encourage 
my colleagues to do so, as well. 
On this past Saturday, 13 people were shot 
and 10 were killed going about their daily lives 
at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York. 
of those lost souls were Black. 
We know from the racist, xenophobic 
screeds posted online by the perpetrator of 
this attack that this particular supermarket was 
targeted because it was located in a predomi-
nantly Black residential neighborhood. 
Then, on Sunday, one person was killed 
and four people were critically injured at a 
church in Laguna Woods, California. It ap-
pears this attack was motivated by political ha-
tred directed at the Taiwanese community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5151 
May 18, 2022 
We must respond to these brazen attacks 
because this country—our country—cannot 
continue down this hateful pathway. 
H.R. 350, the bipartisan Domestic Terrorism 
Prevention Act, of which I am a cosponsor, 
will strengthen the federal government’s efforts 
to respond to domestic terrorism, focusing pri-
marily on the threat of white supremacy. 
It is a necessary response to the elevated 
threat of violence posed by domestic violent 
extremists, as declared by the FBI—which we 
must not allow to continue. 
Each component of this bill has been care-
fully tailored to address the inadequacies of 
our current approach to fighting domestic ter-
rorism and white supremacy. 
First, it would authorize the creation of dedi-
cated offices within the Department of Home-
land Security, the Department of Justice, and 
the FBI to analyze, investigate, monitor, and 
prosecute domestic terrorism jointly; promote 
information sharing among federal law en-
forcement agencies; and take preventative 
measures, focusing federal resources on the 
most significant threats based on the data col-
lected. 
Second, DOJ, FBI, and DHS would be re-
quired to provide critical training and re-
sources to help state, local, and tribal law en-
forcement agencies focus on understanding, 
detecting, preventing, and preempting domes-
tic terrorism. 
Third, the bill would also require establish-
ment of an interagency task force to address 
the chronic infiltration of Federal law enforce-
ment agencies and the military by white su-
premacists and neo-Nazis and biannual re-
porting on the state of domestic terrorism 
threats. 
Fourth, this bill does not create new criminal 
offenses, new lists of designated domestic ter-
rorist groups, or new investigative powers for 
law enforcement. 
And because the fight against terrorism 
should not encroach upon Constitutional pro-
tections, the bill makes clear that no provi-
sions shall be construed to infringe upon rights 
protected by the First Amendment and re-
quires that each report must include a certifi-
cation that all civil rights and civil liberties laws 
and regulations were followed when con-
ducting assessments and investigations. 
We must better equip law enforcement in all 
communities, on the local and federal level, to 
collaborate effectively to identify domestic ter-
ror threats and thwart these cowardly attacks 
before they happen. 
In the last decade, every ethnic group in the 
United States has been touched by the in-
crease in domestic terrorism. 
These tragedies and their circumstances are 
all too familiar—the shooting spree at a 
Walmart in El Paso, Texas which left twenty- 
two dead and twenty-four injured; the rampage 
at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue where 
eleven people were killed; the racist attack on 
the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin which left six 
people dead; the brutal murder of nine wor-
shippers at the Emanuel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Caro-
lina; three Muslim college students executed 
in Chapel Hill, North Carolina supposedly over 
parking but tinged with hostility for the young 
people’s ‘‘look’’; the spa shooter in Atlanta 
who killed eight people, including six women 
of Asian descent; and bomb threats repeatedly 
called into historically black colleges, univer-
sities, and places of worship during Black His-
tory Month this year. 
This bill addresses a real problem that we 
can no longer ignore. Thoughts and prayers 
are not enough. It is time we do more to help 
root out domestic terrorism and white suprem-
acy. 
I would like to thank Representative BRAD 
SCHNEIDER for his dedication to crafting this 
bill in a thoughtful, responsive manner. 
I urge all members on both sides of the 
aisle to support this important legislation just 
as they did last Congress. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 350—Domestic Ter-
rorism Prevention Act of 2022, a bill that will 
counter domestic terrorism. 
I am a cosponsor of H.R. 350, and I thank 
Chairman Thompson for his leadership of the 
Committee on Homeland Security and his ef-
forts to prioritize the issue of domestic ter-
rorism. 
H.R. 350 would authorize a dedicated do-
mestic terrorism office within the Department 
of Homeland Security (DHS) responsible for 
identifying and analyzing domestic terrorism 
activity in keeping with existing authorities and 
would codify in statute the establishment of 
dedicated offices within the Department of 
Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation (FBI) to investigate and prosecute 
domestic terrorism. 
Domestic terrorism has posed a growing 
threat over the past decade. FBI Director 
Wray, when testifying before the House Com-
mittees on Homeland Security and Judiciary 
warned about this escalating threat, including 
in congressional testimony. 
In 2017, Director Wray characterized do-
mestic terrorism as a ‘‘very serious’’ issue and 
noted that the FBI had approximately 1,000 
open domestic terrorism investigations, ap-
proximately the same as the number of FBI’s 
investigations into U.S.-based individuals in-
spired by foreign terrorist organizations. 
In 2018, Director Wray warned that ‘‘law en-
forcement, racial minorities, and the U.S. Gov-
ernment will continue to be significant targets 
for many domestic extremist movements.’’ 
In 2021, Director Wray stated that the do-
mestic 
terrorism 
threat 
is 
‘‘metastasizing 
across the country.’’ 
In response to the Biden Administration’s di-
rection to produce a comprehensive assess-
ment of domestic terrorism threats, the Intel-
ligence Community and law enforcement con-
cluded in March 2021 that domestic violent ex-
tremists ‘‘pose an elevated threat to the 
Homeland.’’ 
No matter what other challenges might 
emerge we must never forget that one of our 
nation’s greatest threats comes from our 
struggle against violent extremism that began 
on September 11, 2001 and has extended to 
violent extremist living among us who use po-
litical affiliation as a justification for acts of ter-
ror. 
September 11, 2001 remains a tragedy that 
defines our nation’s history, but the final chap-
ter will be written by those who are charged 
with keeping our nation and its people safe 
while preserving the way of life that terrorists 
sought to change. 
I was at the September 11, 2021 com-
memoration held in New York last year and 
reflected on the twenty years since that day of 
the attacks. 
Since September 11, 2001, it has been a 
priority of this nation to prevent terrorists, or 
those who would do American’s harm, from 
boarding flights whether they are domestic or 
international. 
Over the nearly twenty years since enact-
ment of the Homeland Security Act, the mis-
sion of the Department of Homeland Security 
has expanded to include cyber defense of ci-
vilian agency and private sector networks; pro-
tecting critical infrastructure in the form of the 
nation’s electric grid, water delivery systems, 
transportation networks and federal election 
systems; and most recently managing the 
question of essential workers during this pan-
demic. 
Annually the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity has held a hearing on the topic of World-
wide Threats to Homeland Security, which 
have covered a range of topics from terrorist 
organizations like Al Qaeda and ISIS, to home 
grown involving Lone Wolves and White Su-
premacists. 
The mission of the Committee on Homeland 
Security has been and will continue to be on 
the nearly 3,000 people who died on Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and whom we owe a debt to 
do all that we can to prevent another attack on 
United States soil. 
The escalation in violent domestic attacks 
since the January 6 attack has particularly 
been felt by our nation’s law enforcement offi-
cers, but others as well in the rise in murder 
and assaults across the nation. 
Today, we find ourselves in a nation where 
the terrorism landscape is more complex and 
it is imperative that we recognize the unor-
thodox nature of the terrorism threat we face 
today. 
The current terrorism threat landscape has 
three major drivers of heightened threat: 
(1) the convergence of extremist ideologies; 
(2) the speed at which individuals who as-
cribe to extremist ideologies escalate to vio-
lence; 
(3) and the enormous growth of misinforma-
tion, disinformation, and mal-information. 
The fringe ideologies that have adherents 
that move from group to group complicates 
the work of counterterrorism investigations, 
operations, and policy making because the 
focus would be on means and methods, un-
derstanding the hagiarchy of an organization, 
then moving to nullify threats before they 
manifest into acts of physical violence. 
Research shows that ‘‘over the past roughly 
15 
years, 
the 
average 
time 
span 
of 
radicalization in the U.S. has shrunk from 18 
months to 7 months.’’ 
As Director Wray said in a hearing before 
the Committee in September 2020, domestic 
violent extremists ‘‘can go from radicalization 
to mobilization in weeks, if not days.’’ 
The speed and ease of the proliferation of 
misinformation, disinformation mal-information 
is unprecedented joined with the mass invita-
tion to willing minds to commit acts of violence 
based on information is unprecedented. 
Misinformation, disinformation, and mal-in-
formation proliferate on the internet and build 
bridges between conspiracy theory and violent 
extremism. 
According to research by the Soufan Group, 
‘‘algorithms employed by social media compa-
nies to generate continued engagement with 
platforms are partly responsible for radicalizing 
individuals to support QAnon,’’ with anti-Semi-
tism serving as a bridge between QAnon and 
white supremacy extremism. 
The non-profit research group Tech Against 
Terrorism issued a report finding that ‘‘terrorist

and violent extremist operated websites from 
across the ideological spectrum . . . pose one 
of the most significant threats to global efforts 
in tackling terrorist use of the internet by gov-
ernments, the tech sector, law enforcement 
and NGOs. 
While mis-, dis-, or mal-information may not 
in and of itself constitute terrorist content, con-
spiracy theories in such information may pro-
pel terrorists and violent extremists to action. 
Misinformation, disinformation, and mal-in-
formation undermine homeland security and 
law enforcement efforts to combat violent ex-
tremism. 
Misinformation and false narratives in polit-
ical discourse, news media, and online have 
increased support for political violence. 
The availability of extremist content online 
means that today, ‘‘everyone is just a few 
clicks away from an ever-expanding series of 
rabbit holes that offer up whole worlds of 
disinformation and hate.’’ 
In January 2021, President Biden initiated a 
100-day comprehensive review of Federal ef-
forts to address domestic terrorism. 
The review found that racially or ethnically 
motivated violent extremists who advocate for 
the superiority of the white race and anti-gov-
ernment or anti-authority violent extremists are 
the two most lethal elements of today’s ter-
rorism threat, and as a result of that review, in 
June 2021 the Biden Administration released 
the first-ever National Strategy for Countering 
Domestic Terrorism. 
It is a comprehensive strategy for address-
ing the threat posed by domestic violent ex-
tremists and recognizes that online narratives 
promoting attacks on U.S. citizens, institutions, 
and critical infrastructure are a key factor driv-
ing radicalization and mobilization to violence. 
Under the Strategy, DHS is responsible for 
preventing terrorism and I targeted violence, 
including through threat assessments, grants, 
and community-based prevention programs; 
enhancing public awareness; assessing, eval-
uating, and mitigating the ’risk of violence in-
spired by violent extremist narratives, including 
those narratives shared via online platforms; 
and establishing partnerships with nongovern-
mental organizations. 
In May 2021, DHS announced the establish-
ment of the Center for Prevention Programs 
and Partnerships (CP3), which would help the 
Department combat terrorism and targeted vi-
olence. 
The City of Houston’s Mayor’s Office of 
Public 
Safety 
and 
Homeland 
Security 
(MOPSHS) is a recipient of $603,855.00 and 
has used the funds to reengage the cities 
community partners to form a coalition that will 
share information, assess threats, and be a 
resource to the community. 
The city will work with the Texas Edu-
cational Service Center to develop a cur-
riculum 
to 
educate 
students 
about 
radicalization to violence, media literacy, and 
bias. 
According to CSIS, White supremacists, ex-
tremist militia members, and other violent far- 
right extremists were responsible for 66 per-
cent of domestic terrorist attacks and plots in 
2020. 
On June 7, Harry H. Rogers—a self-pro-
claimed leader of the Ku Klux Klan—inten-
tionally drove his pick-up truck into a crowd of 
Black Lives Matter demonstrators in Henrico, 
Virginia. One protester was injured, and Rog-
ers received a six-year prison sentence. 
In another case a Nevada man used an ar-
mored truck to block traffic on the Hoover 
Dam Bypass Bridge and held up signs—then 
he fled to Arizona where he was arrested. 
At the time of his arrest he referenced 
QAnon conspiracy theories and discussed re-
lated conspiratorial beliefs. 
No matter what other challenges might 
emerge, we must never forget that one of our 
nation’s greatest threats comes from our 
struggle against violent extremism that began 
on September 11, 2001 and has extended to 
violent extremists living among us who use 
political affiliation as a justification for acts of 
terror. 
I ask fellow members of the House to join 
me in voting in favor of H.R. 350.

TOR of Florida). All time for debate has

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

ACCESS TO BABY FORMULA ACT

Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 7791) to amend 
the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to es-
tablish waiver authority to address 
certain 
emergencies, 
disasters, 
and 
supply chain disruptions, and for other 
purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. STEEL) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 7791, the Access to Baby For-
mula Act of 2022. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, across the country, 
the ongoing shortage of formula is dis-
proportionately hurting women and 
children who rely on the benefits 
through the WIC program, leaving 
them with few options to purchase safe 
formula for their infants. That is be-
cause about half of the infants in 
America participate in the WIC pro-
gram. 
In times of crisis, one of our core re-
sponsibilities as lawmakers is to en-
sure that families in need can continue 
to feed their children and keep them 
healthy. 
While I am encouraged that the 
Biden administration and Abbott Nu-
trition have reached an agreement to 
restart formula production following 
the company’s recall, the immediate 
consequences facing our children re-
quire additional action. 
That is why the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Mrs. HAYES) and the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. STEEL) 
and I took action to help vulnerable 
Americans provide their babies with 
the nutrition they need. One of the 
flexibilities in the WIC program that 
the Access to Baby Formula Act pro-
vides will allow families in need to use 
WIC benefits to purchase other safe and 
available infant formula products. 
WIC vouchers can be limited to one 
brand product. This makes sense be-
cause a WIC program can require com-
panies to bid for the privilege of par-
ticipating. Having the power to limit 
participation to just one brand encour-
ages vendors to agree to huge dis-
counts. 
Unfortunately, in a time of shortage, 
a voucher for a product not on the shelf 
is of no value. This bill allows flexi-
bility in such a time so that parents 
will be able to purchase whatever 
brand is actually available. 
This legislation reflects our commit-
ment to ensuring access to formula for 
those who need it most, during both 
the current crisis and into the future. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Connecticut and the gen-
tlewoman from California for their ur-
gent leadership on the Access to Baby 
Formula Act, and I urge my colleagues 
to join in taking a stand for our Na-
tion’s children. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7791, the Access to Baby 
Formula Act, a bipartisan bill I am 
proud to lead with my colleague from 
Connecticut. 
The shortage of infant formula across 
the country has led to panic and des-
peration among so many families. As a 
parent, there is nothing more impor-
tant than ensuring the health and safe-
ty of your child. As families continue 
to bear the brunt of crippling inflation, 
this formula shortage only compounds 
the stress that these families are fac-
ing at home. 
It is estimated that the cost of baby 
formula is up almost 20 percent in the 
last year. More than 40 percent of the 
top-selling baby formula products were 
out of stock as of the beginning of this 
month. Families desperate to feed 
their babies shouldn’t have to face 
empty shelves because of government 
mismanagement and overregulation. 
We should have never gotten to this 
point, but this bipartisan legislation 
will provide certainty for recipients 
and manufacturers, ensuring this crisis 
doesn’t happen again. 
Under this bill, WIC participants and 
infant formula manufacturers will re-
ceive the clarity they need in the event 
of another emergency or supply chain 
disruption. The bill requires infant for-
mula manufacturers to have a plan 
that will detail how they will address 
an emergency or disruption, so WIC 
participants aren’t impacted. 
Importantly, the bill also includes 
strict timelines so the companies and 
WIC participants will know the rules of 
the road during a disruption. 
Finally, this bill includes important 
transparency requirements so the pub-
lic will know what the administration 
is doing to remedy this crisis and pre-
vent future disruptions. I am pleased 
that we were able to come together and 
put American families first. 
Madam Speaker, families deserve to 
have this weight lifted off their shoul-
ders. It is time to act and pass this res-
olution. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1915 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Mrs. 
HAYES). 
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of this very important piece 
of legislation. 
WIC recipients utilize formula at 
roughly double the rate of nonpartici-
pating families, ensuring that this cri-
sis has had a disproportionate impact 
on communities and families with the 
highest needs. That means that low-in-
come women and children are particu-
larly vulnerable during this nationwide 
formula shortage. 
Today, we are taking swift action to 
help these families feed their babies by 
safely getting more baby formula onto 
store shelves in the face of manufac-
turer recalls. 
I am excited to work with leadership 
and introduce the Access to Baby For-
mula Act, which helps improve access 
to formula products for WIC partici-
pants while also better protecting 
them during future product recalls. 
This legislation establishes waiver 
authority to address emergencies dur-
ing disasters and supply chain disrup-
tions by ensuring States that contract 
companies with the WIC program can 
secure supplies from additional manu-
facturers, if necessary.

H5154 
May 18, 2022 
The bill also waives requirements 
that slow down the process to get for-
mula back on the shelves, without sac-
rificing safety standards. 
The bill promotes coordination and 
information sharing between the Sec-
retary of Agriculture and the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
regarding any supply chain disruption, 
including supplemental food recalls. 
As a member of the Education and 
Labor Committee and chair of the Sub-
committee on Nutrition, Oversight, 
and Department Operations, when this 
crisis arose, I was concerned, like 
many of my colleagues. I called the 
chairman and spoke to Speaker PELOSI 
to share my concerns. We worked to-
gether to come up with a solution to 
get formula to families as quickly as 
possible. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. STEEL) for joining us in 
this effort. I thank her so much for her 
help. 
I know the feeling of desperation and 
stress that mothers, grandmothers, and 
family members across the country are 
feeling as they are searching for for-
mula for their children. 
Mothers in my district have joined 
Facebook groups to find where formula 
is available in our district. They are 
waiting in long lines outside of stores 
and buying sample packs on the street. 
They are even resorting to the dan-
gerous practice of watering down their 
formula just to stretch the supply. 
They are desperate. 
As many as 75 percent of American 
families are at least partially depend-
ent on formula to provide nutrients to 
their infants. Additionally, some in-
fants are solely reliant on specialty 
formulas to manage medical disorders. 
In my district, I talked to Marcia 
from Farmington and Caitlin from Wa-
tertown, who sent messages to my of-
fice begging for help. My heart broke 
as these women shared their stories. 
For those families who are able to 
find formula in local stores, the prices 
they are paying today have increased 
dramatically, in some cases up 18 per-
cent over the past year. 
It is important to recognize why we 
are in this situation. Families are ac-
tively seeing the consequences of a mo-
nopoly in any industry during a time of 
unprecedented supply chain challenges. 
The U.S. infant formula market is 
dominated by three companies: Abbott 
Nutrition, Enfamil, and Gerber. Abbott 
holds the largest share of contracts in 
the WIC program with States, terri-
tories, and Tribes. This means that 
nearly half of all infants in the pro-
gram are reliant on their formula. 
They also provide 43 percent of baby 
formula in the United States and is one 
of several companies that controls 89 
percent of the U.S. infant formula mar-
ket, making it especially vulnerable to 
issues like this. 
When 
the 
massive 
companies 
in 
charge of this product fail, millions of 
families are thrust into the dangerous 
situation of not being able to feed their 
children. 
It is unconscionable that we did not 
have a backup plan for a supply chain 
issue like we are seeing, and families 
are left desperate. This bill does that, 
ensuring that if we ever have this type 
of crisis in the future, we are prepared, 
and we can quickly shift gears. 
I want to say to the moms struggling 
that we hear you in Congress, and you 
do not need to handle this on your own. 
We are working to find you a solution. 
Your words are not falling on deaf ears. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI), 
the Speaker of the United States House 
of Representatives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his great leadership in bringing this 
important legislation to the floor, 
which is part of his leadership for the 
children, America’s working families, 
and our country. 
I 
also 
commend 
Congresswoman 
JAHANA HAYES for her exceptional lead-
ership in this regard, for talking about 
this issue, for giving people hope that 
there is a solution not only to correct 
the situation for now but to make sure 
it doesn’t happen again. 
I thank Mr. SCOTT for his leadership 
in so many ways. 
Madam Speaker, today, the House is 
taking strong action to improve access 
to infant formula through the Women, 
Infants, and Children’s program, also 
known as WIC. This shortage has taken 
an especially dangerous toll on women 
and children from underserved commu-
nities as about half of all infant for-
mula sold nationwide is purchased as 
WIC benefits. 
Thanks to the tireless leadership of 
Congresswoman JAHANA
HAYES
and 
Education and Labor Chairman BOBBY 
SCOTT, we will pass legislation today to 
secure important flexibility for the 
WIC program to help vulnerable fami-
lies buy infant formula in times of 
emergency. 
This action ensures WIC can respond 
quickly to supply chain disruptions 
and recalls by relaxing certain non- 
safety-related regulations. In doing so, 
we make sure that America’s babies 
get the nutrition they need right now 
and for the future. 
At the same time, under the relent-
less leadership of Appropriations Chair 
ROSA DELAURO, the House will soon 
pass an emergency supplemental appro-
priation to address the shortage. 
The supplemental delivers urgently 
needed resources to the FDA to take 
steps to restore formula supply, in-
crease FDA’s inspection staff, keep 
fraudulent products off the grocery 
shelves, and better collect data on 
shortages in communities across the 
Nation. 
It is essential that we ensure the 
Federal Government has the resources 
it needs to get baby formula back on 
the shelves. As the President said, we 
want to do it quickly, but we must do 
it safely, and we must do it with cau-
tion, not so fast as not to be safe. 
These two bills are strong steps, and 
Democrats will not relent in shining a 
bright light on this emergency. 
I 
am 
hopeful 
that 
Congressman 
SCOTT’s and Congresswoman HAYES’ 
legislation will be strongly bipartisan. 
That is my understanding, and that 
would be a great thing, coming to-
gether for the children. 
Additionally, Chairwoman DELAURO 
is having hearings tomorrow in the Ap-
propriations Committee on this sub-
ject. Chairman FRANK PALLONE of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee will 
be holding hearings next week to learn 
more. Chairwoman CAROLYN MALONEY 
of the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form has launched an investigation 
into the shortage, requesting that the 
four major formula manufacturers de-
tail the steps they are taking to ad-
dress this emergency. I thank her for 
her leadership. 
When people ask me what the three 
most important issues facing the Con-
gress are, I always say the same thing: 
our children, our children, our chil-
dren—their health; their education; the 
economic security of their families; a 
clean, safe, gun violence-free environ-
ment in which they can thrive; and a 
world at peace in which they can reach 
their fulfillment. 
That is why ensuring our beautiful 
babies have the nutrition they need to 
grow up healthy and strong is of urgent 
moral imperative. 
As a mother of five and grandmother 
of nine, I know firsthand that when a 
baby is crying because a baby is hun-
gry, we want to give that baby what is 
best for the baby in terms of not only 
satisfying the hunger but helping with 
the development, and that is why this 
has to be safe. Together, these two bills 
are the latest manifestation of our For 
the Children agenda, protecting their 
health and well-being. 
Today, the President invoked the De-
fense Production Act to address na-
tionwide shortages of baby formula, 
and that is a good thing. He will also 
make available some military aircraft 
to bring formula that is safe from 
other places to our country to get that 
formula on the shelves, in the homes, 
for the babies as soon as possible. 
I say this is as personal as it gets for 
a family. Again, we all want it to be 
safe, and that is what I know that this 
legislation is about. That is why a vote 
‘‘no’’ on this will deprive hungry babies 
of nutrition they need and jeopardize 
their future. That is why I am so glad 
it will be strongly bipartisan. 
I urge an ‘‘aye’’ on both bills for the 
babies, for the children, and I con-
gratulate both sides of the aisle for 
their work on this legislation. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding the time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5155 
May 18, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7791, the Access to Baby 
Formula Act, to prevent a future crisis 
like the one taking a toll on families 
today. I am a grandfather and a father, 
so it is important to me. 
Across the country, new mothers are 
going store to store in desperate search 
of baby formula. It is stressful; it is 
gut-wrenching; and it is unacceptable. 
Even when parents can find baby for-
mula, the price has soared 18 percent in 
the past year. 
How did we get to this dire situation? 
Last November, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration shut down the Nation’s 
top baby formula manufacturer, a 
plant just outside of my district in 
Michigan. Since then, the Biden ad-
ministration has slow-walked the re-
sponse and failed to understand the 
consequences of their actions. The FDA 
should have reopened the Abbott plant 
in Sturgis sooner. 
This plant is consequential, in large 
part due to a contract they have with 
WIC. H.R. 7791 takes critical steps to 
safeguard WIC participants, even in the 
event of something like a plant clo-
sure. 
This legislation requires preparation 
and planning for supply chain disrup-
tions, ensures appropriate guide rails, 
and will prevent disasters caused in 
part by government contracts altering 
the market. 
As a parent, ensuring the health and 
well-being of your child is paramount. 
They should not have to scramble from 
one empty shelf to another and worry 
about feeding their babies. This for-
mula shortage is an urgent crisis and 
one that cannot happen again. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
Access to Baby Formula Act. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. CARO-
LYN B. MALONEY), the chairwoman of 
the Oversight and Reform Committee. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding and for his ex-
traordinary leadership on this issue 
and so many other areas. 
I thank our Speaker for speaking out 
so beautifully for the children, for our 
support for their health, for baby for-
mula, for their support in general, and 
ROSA DELAURO for her appropriations 
bill that will supply $28 million for the 
baby formula crisis. For the author of 
this very important bill before us, Rep-
resentative JAHANA HAYES, I thank her 
for her leadership, too. 
I rise in support of H.R. 7791, the Ac-
cess to Baby Formula Act, vital legis-
lation to improve access to infant for-
mula for families with less income who 
use the WIC family benefit program. 
That is the Women, Infants, and Chil-
dren program. 
The Abbott recall and formula short-
ages have devastated families across 
our country, particularly those who 
rely on the WIC program. 
I have been contacted by constitu-
ents who are traveling far and wide to 
find the formula. They are going on the 
internet to find it. They are printing 
their grandmothers’ formulas. They 
are coming up with other ways to try 
to get formula to infants. 
This is absolutely unacceptable. We 
cannot sit by while families struggle to 
feed their babies. 
That is why I have sent letters to the 
CEOs of the four largest baby formula 
manufacturers, pressing them on their 
plans to boost supply. What happened? 
Why did this happen in the first place? 
How soon are they going to get formula 
back on the shelves of our stores for 
our families? How will they prevent fu-
ture shortages? 
We must pass this bill to provide the 
additional WIC program with the flexi-
bility that President Biden called for 
so that families across the country can 
access affordable formula. 
Under the WIC program now, they 
are only allowed to contract with Ab-
bott, the company that had the recalls, 
so this would allow them to contract 
with other companies to provide this 
vital service. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD a let-
ter from dozens of health, nutrition, 
education, and child advocacy organi-
zations urging passage of this legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time.

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, LEADER MCCARTHY, 
LEADER SCHUMER, AND LEADER MCCONNELL: 
Parents across the country are increasingly 
anxious about the diminished availability of 
infant formula in traditional retail channels 
after Abbott Nutrition instituted a nation-
wide recall of its most popular products in 
February 2022. The undersigned organiza-
tions urge swift action in Congress to pro-
vide federal agencies with the flexibilities 
and resources needed to shore up supply, as-
sure the safety of infant formula available 
on the market, and provide families with op-
tions that ensure babies have access to es-
sential nutrition. 
Although breastfeeding is the optimal 
source 
of 
infant 
nutrition, 
sustained 
breastfeeding is not an option for many 
mothers. Infant formula is an essential prod-
uct constituting the majority—or even ex-
clusive—source of nutrition for many infants 
and some older children and adults with met-
abolic disorders. Since Abbott Nutrition an-
nounced the infant formula recall in Feb-
ruary 2022, the Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) has led an interagency effort to 
address supply challenges and encourage in-
creased production among the limited do-
mestic manufacturers. The infant formula 
manufacturing sector is highly concentrated, 
with only four companies—Abbott Nutrition, 
Reckitt Benckiser (Mead Johnson), Nestle´ 
(Gerber), and Perrigo—commanding nearly 
90 percent of the domestic infant formula 
supply. As the nation navigates through the 
Abbott recall, manufacturer assurances of 
increased production have not yet translated 
to increased stock on the shelves, leaving 
many families with limited options and 
acutely impacting individuals who need spe-
cialty formulas to accommodate for aller-
gies, digestive issues, or metabolic disorders. 
More than half of all infant formula pur-
chases in the country go through the Special 
Supplemental 
Nutrition 
Program 
for 
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which 
typically limits the 1.2 million infants re-
ceiving formula benefits to a specific brand. 
Though WI C’s State-based, sole-source con-
tracting process has been a successful cost 
containment strategy, limited options posed 
a unique challenge during this unprece-
dented failure of the manufacturing sector. 
Starting in February 2022, a patchwork of 
waivers from the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) and contract flexibilities ex-
ercised by State WIC Agencies allowed for 
WIC families have more options—including 
additional container sizes and brands—to en-
sure that low-income families could obtain 
infant formula amid limited supply on the 
shelves. 
As with the commercial market, WIC’s 
program structure did not anticipate the 
possibility of the widespread shortages that 
are felt today by all parents of formula-fed 
infants. The bipartisan Access to Baby For-
mula Act advances common-sense, but essen-
tial, flexibilities that will provide regulatory 
relief and maximum flexibility to State and 
local providers as they support low-income 
families during product recalls and public 
health emergencies. This legislation also 
works to build contingencies into State con-
tracts with infant formula manufacturers 
and promotes collaboration between USDA 
and FDA to assure a coordinated, public-pri-
vate response to infant formula recalls and 
supply disruptions. These steps empower 
WIC with the flexibility to ensure that the 
most vulnerable infants have access to ade-
quate nutrition when supply is strained or 
limited. 
Additionally, the Infant Formula Supple-
mental Appropriations Act of 2022 would pro-
vide $28 million in funding for FDA to ad-
dress product shortages and strengthens the 
agency’s capacity to assure safety of infant 
formula, especially as new products enter 
the domestic market. FDA’s limited band-
width to monitor for safe manufacturing 
practices at infant formula production sites 
is concerning, and this additional funding 
will be essential to building a safe and more 
resilient supply chain that delivers quality 
product to support infants’ nutrition needs. 
Together, these two bills provide a sub-
stantial next step in the federal response to 
the Abbott recall and will better position 
agencies and low-income families to weather 
the crisis. But more must be done to identify 
and remedy the structural factors that al-
lowed for the domestic infant formula supply 
to be so substantially impacted by the clo-
sure of only one manufacturing facility. We 
look forward to ongoing efforts in Congress 
and federal agencies to assess the competi-
tiveness of the infant formula manufacturing 
sector and assure that any given manufac-
turer’s operations are sufficiently diversified 
to deliver essential product to parents in 
need. 
We thank you for your attention to this 
issue, which remains top-of-mind for so 
many parents across the country, and we 
urge swift action to deliver change and build 
a better future for the next generation of 
Americans. 
Sincerely,

Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I had another speaker on the 
way, but he is not here yet, so I am 
prepared to close. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
It is undeniable that the nationwide 
baby formula shortage has created im-
mense panic and desperation among 
families. From skyrocketing inflation 
and gas prices, to rising violent crime, 
the American people are being faced 
with crisis after crisis. The last thing 
families need right now is a shortage of 
such essential goods as baby formula. 
In the United States of America, no 
parent should be unsure of how they 
will feed their infant child. We need to 
act today to reverse the effects of this 
shortage on American families, and the 
bipartisan bill before us today offers an 
opportunity to right this ship. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, as I said at the be-
ginning of debate, one of our core re-
sponsibilities 
as 
lawmakers 
during 
times of crisis is to ensure that fami-
lies, particularly those most in need, 
can continue to feed their children. 
This is precisely the goal that the Ac-
cess to Baby Formula Act seeks to 
achieve. 
By providing additional flexibilities 
in the WIC program, we have a critical

opportunity to assure that families can 
continue using their WIC benefits to 
get safe and available formula products 
that their children need. 
Simply put, the Access to Baby For-
mula Act is legislation we need to en-
sure access to formula for children and 
families who need it most, both during 
this current shortage and into the fu-
ture. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Mrs. HAYES) and the gentle-
woman from California, (Mrs. STEEL) 
for their urgent leadership on behalf of 
our Nation’s children and families. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
7791, the Access to Baby Formula Act, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of the Access to 
Baby Formula Act, bipartisan legislation in re-
sponse to the infant formula shortage that is 
affecting the most vulnerable in our commu-
nities, our children. 
This legislation recognizes the important 
role that WIC plays in meeting the health and 
nutrition needs of our nation’s mothers, ba-
bies, and children. 
WIC is the premier public health nutrition 
program that provides supplemental food 
aimed at improving the health and well-being 
of millions of pregnant mothers, infants, and 
children. 
In FY 2021, average monthly WIC participa-
tion in my state of Wisconsin was 80,000, in-
cluding about 19,000 infants. 
Studies have proven time and again food is 
medicine, and that availability of nutritious 
food reduces adverse maternal and infant 
health outcomes. 
Unfortunately, families across the country 
are struggling to find formula that their babies 
need. 
The Biden Administration has acted to re-
spond to this shortage and I am pleased that 
today Congress will build on and support 
those efforts. 
With around half of the formula purchased 
through WIC benefits, our WIC families are 
particularly vulnerable which is why it is critical 
that Congress pass this bill swiftly. 
What can be more important than feeding 
our babies? 
This bill authorizes new flexibilities to re-
spond to supply chain or other disruptions 
such as a recall that adversely affects the abil-
ity of WIC agencies and programs to meet the 
needs of those who rely on the program. 
We must do everything in our power to en-
sure that all babies have access to formula 
that they may need to start life strong and that 
includes giving WIC programs and the incred-
ible people who staff them the flexibility they 
need to provide immediate relief to the fami-
lies they serve. 
I urge support of this bill. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 7791, Access to 
Baby Formula Act, a bill to amend the Child 
Nutrition Act of 1966 to establish waiver au-
thority to address certain emergencies, disas-
ters, and supply chain disruptions. 
I am a cosponsor of H.R. 7791, and I thank 
my good friend and colleague Congress-
woman JAHANA HAYES for introducing this im-
portant bill that addresses the ongoing na-
tional crisis in shortages of infant baby for-
mula. 
I serve on the House Committees on the 
Budget and Homeland Security both of which 
have oversight or funding responsibilities for 
addressing this current crisis. 
Many parents know there has been a short 
supply of baby formula nationwide for months, 
due to pandemic-related supply chain issues. 
That shortage is now a crisis after four chil-
dren became sick, and two died, after sus-
pected bacterial contamination of formula 
which originated from Abbott Nutrition’s for-
mula plant in Sturgis, Michigan. 
This key bill will help improve access to in-
fant formula for vulnerable families during the 
infant formula shortage crisis. 
Infant formula is essential to a baby’s early 
life and development. 
The shortage of infant formula has dis-
proportionately affected women and children 
who rely on WIC benefits to purchase infant 
formula. 
Over fifty percent of the infant formula pro-
duced in the United States goes to the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants, and Children (commonly known as the 
WIC program). 
The infant formula shortage crisis has taken 
a especially dangerous toll on women and 
children from underserved communities who 
use WIC benefits to access infant formula. 
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program 
for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) helps 
ensure the health and well-being of low-in-
come women, infants, and children up to ages 
five who are at an increased nutritional risk. 
WIC participation has been associated with 
improved infant health outcomes—including 
reduced infant mortality and reduced dispari-
ties in hospitalization rates among black and 
Latino infants. 
WIC serves to safeguard the health of low- 
income women, infants, and children younger 
than 5 who are at nutritional risk. 
About half of infant formula sold nationwide 
is purchased with WIC benefits. 
The baby formula shortage is hitting poorer 
communities disproportionately hard. 
According to an article from CNN, about half 
of WIC beneficiaries lost access to baby for-
mula when their major supplier, Abbott Nutri-
tion, recalled their products. 
The shortage has left all parents with less 
choices and is adding further pressure to al-
ready existing economic disparities. 
Recently, I partnered with the National As-
sociation of Christian Churches to distribute 
baby formula to 800 desperate parents at Jack 
Yates High School to provide help to parents 
with the greatest need in Houston. 
Ovie and Mikayla Cade were two parents of 
the hundreds that came to the school for for-
mula to feed their baby and looked to Jack 
Yates High School for relief. 
The baby formula give-away provided short- 
term relief to parents in search of formula to 
feed their babies. 
That is why for the time being I plan to 
reach out to national disaster organizations to 
pull together resources to provide immediate 
support for these families. 
This shortage transcends state lines and re-
quires a joint effort on all fronts to get these 
infants the nutrition they need as quickly as 
possible. 
This bill provides the Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) the authority to waive certain 
requirements so that vulnerable families in the 
WIC program can continue purchasing other 
safe and available infant formula products with 
their WIC benefits during extenuating cir-
cumstances, such as a public health emer-
gency or supply chain disruption. 
The current WIC program has restrictions 
on which infant formula products a WIC partic-
ipant can purchase using their WIC benefits. 
WIC has limited the types and form of baby 
formula that can be purchased by families by 
only allowing powder formula. 
The current crisis is an opportunity to re-
move this limitation on the types of baby for-
mula available to parents and focus on the nu-
tritional needs of babies. 
The bill will also ensure that WIC partici-
pants are better protected during a product re-
call. 
This is the first time in recorded memory 
that our nation has had a substantial shortage 
of infant formula. 
Babies are in need and parents and care-
givers are desperate to find formula to feed 
their children. 
As the founder and Chair of the Congres-
sional Children’s Caucus, I have worked to ad-
dress the needs of women, families, and chil-
dren. 
Currently, the nationwide out-of-stock rate 
for baby formula has reached a high of 43 
percent. 
According to CBS News, more than half of 
all baby formula products available in Texas 
are completely sold out, with an out-of-stock 
rate at 52.5 percent in Houston. 
Infants must eat every three to four hours 
and their formula or breast milk must have 
certain nutrients in order to provide them with 
essential nutrition for their growth and devel-
opment. 
The fact that formula feeding exists on a 
continuum with breast feeding. 
There is no substitute for formula feeding 
because only 1 in 4 infants breastfeed exclu-
sively. 
For parents who depend on baby formula 
either out of choice or necessity, this crisis 
has the potential of impacting an entire gen-
eration of infants for the rest of their lives. 
Desperation is overwhelming parents, and 
some are turning to making their own baby 
formula at home. 
Pediatricians caution against homemade 
baby formula as it runs the risk of not pro-
viding the right amount of nutrients necessary 
for healthy development. 
This crisis was triggered by a manufacturing 
recall and subsequent closure of a major man-
ufacturing plant as well as pandemic-related 
supply chain issues. 
Specifically, on February 17, Abbott Nutri-
tion—the largest infant formula manufacturer 
in the country—initiated a voluntary recall of 
several lines of powdered formula (including 
Similac, Alimentum, and EleCare) and subse-
quently closed its large manufacturing facility 
in Sturgis, Michigan. 
The recall and closure of the plant hap-
pened because of concerns about bacterial in-
fection at the Sturgis manufacturing facility 
after four infants fell ill and two died. 
Also, at the time of the recall, FDA issued 
a warning to consumers not to use these re-
called products. 
President Biden has directed his Administra-
tion to work urgently to ensure that infant for-
mula is safe and available for families across 
the country during the Abbott Nutrition vol-
untary recall.

May 18, 2022 
Yesterday President Biden spoke with retail-
ers and manufacturers—including the CEOs of 
Walmart, Target, Reckett, and Gerber—and 
called on them to do more to help families 
purchase infant formula. 
President Biden also announced additional 
steps to get infant formula onto store shelves 
as quickly as possible without compromising 
safety. These steps include: 
Cutting red tape to get more infant formula 
to store shelves quicker by urging states to 
provide consumers flexibility on types of for-
mula they can buy with WIC dollars 
Calling on the FTC and state attorneys gen-
eral to crack down on any price gouging or 
unfair market practices related to sales of in-
fant formula, like third party sellers re-selling 
formula at steep prices 
The Biden-Harris Administration will con-
tinue to monitor the situation and identify other 
ways it can support the safe and rapid in-
crease in the production and distribution of 
baby formula. 
As a result, more infant formula has been 
produced in the last four weeks than in the 
four weeks preceding the recall—despite one 
of the largest infant formula production facili-
ties in the U.S. being offline. 
The CDC has ended its investigation and di-
rects consumers to the Abbott website to get 
information on the lots recalled and not rec-
ommended for use. 
The baby formula shortage is not over and 
the Congress and the Administration must 
work together to find the solutions parents 
need to have access to baby formula to feed 
their infants. 
This is not an issue that parents can easily 
solve at home. 
I ask fellow members of the House to join 
me in voting in favor of H.R. 7791. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7791. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

mittee on Appropriations or their re-
spective designees. 
The gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO) and the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the measure 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Connecticut? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, this funding legisla-
tion will work in tandem with Presi-
dent Biden’s launch of Operation Fly 
Formula and the invocation of the De-
fense Production Act to help quickly 
and safely address the infant formula 
shortage in this country and help pre-
vent this from happening again. 
I am shocked by the infant formula 
crisis. The shortage we are seeing 
today is in large part caused by some 
who chose not to prioritize the health 
and the safety of our babies. 
In September 2021, Food and Drug 
Administration, FDA inspectors con-
ducted a routine inspection of the Ab-
bott Nutrition facility in Sturgis, 
Michigan, where suspicions of wrong-
doing were already present, as noted in 
a Bloomberg article published on May 
12 from a reporter who obtained the 
FDA report through a Freedom of In-
formation Act request. 
On October 20, 2021, a whistleblower 
who worked at that Abbott facility 
submitted a report to the FDA unveil-
ing a damning list of allegations of 
wrongdoing at the hands of Abbott. Re-
calls happen, but if the allegations are 
true, this company has lied, cut cor-
ners, falsified records to cover up their 
misdoings at the sake of infant health. 
This is plain wrong. 
But this was in October. The FDA 
knew about what Abbott was doing in 
October and, yes, they dragged their 
feet. It was not until late December 
that the FDA interviewed the whistle-
blower. And then not until a month 
after that, in late January, was the 
plant inspected in person. Abbott then 
issued a recall in February, 4 months 
later. 
In March, I requested an HHS Office 
of Inspector General report to look 
into this tragedy, so that we can hold 
the bad actors accountable. And then I 
got ahold of and submitted for the 
record a whistleblower report with 
truly awful allegations against Abbott. 
Their wrongdoings included the fal-
sification of records, testing seals on 
empty cans, releasing untested infant 
formula, just to name a few. In essence, 
they put a product on the market, a 
contaminated 
product, 
which 
they 
knew 
was 
contaminated. 
We 
have 
lost—at least two infants died. Several 
were hospitalized. 
Let’s look back for a moment. Now, 
we are learning that in 2014, Abbott de-
liberately and successfully tried to 
weaken bacteria testing safety stand-
ards. At that time, the FDA issued a 
proposed rule that would have in-
creased the regular safety inspections 
of infant formula manufacturing facili-
ties to prevent the contamination of 
infant formula; the very crisis that we 
have today. 
The Federal Government has an im-
portant role to play in addressing this 
painful issue. As I said, at least two ba-
bies died, and four more were hospital-
ized that we know of because of cor-
porate greed, consolidation, and a dis-
graceful lack of proper oversight by the 
FDA. 
This is infant formula we are talking 
about. Parents trust that this formula 
will be safe and healthy for their new-
born babies. It should be the most reg-
ulated and protected of any product,

May 18, 2022 
and here, we see Abbott putting pro-
duction and profits before people. 
I introduced this bill this week be-
cause 43 percent of infant formula is 
out of stock nationwide. There is an 
immediate need to bring infant for-
mula to the babies and families facing 
such a dire necessity. In the wealthiest 
Nation in the world, babies should not 
be at risk of going hungry. Parents 
should not have to play a guessing 
game and wonder if the food that they 
are giving their babies is safe. 
Earlier this evening, President Biden 
announced that he would invoke the 
Defense Production Act to increase do-
mestic production of infant formula, 
launching Operation Fly Formula to 
use Federal planes to fly formula in 
from abroad. 
I have been calling for the swift im-
portation of safe infant formula from 
FDA-approved facilities overseas since 
the beginning of this crisis. These steps 
will achieve this goal, and I applaud 
the Biden administration for rising to 
this urgent challenge. 
Now that we are ramping up produc-
tion, preparing to purchase formula 
from abroad, we must ensure that it is 
safe. And I would repeat, this product 
needs to come from FDA-approved fa-
cilities so we make no mistake that 
they are adhering to a standard. The 
FDA needs the resources to do that. 
The FDA plays a critical role in en-
suring formula provides the full nutri-
tional needs of infants and that it is 
manufactured in the safest way pos-
sible. We must ensure that a lack of 
funding is not a barrier to getting safe 
formula to parents and babies. 
The bill before us does just that. It 
addresses this pressing need by pro-
viding $28 million in new funding for 
the FDA. These funds will be used to 
prevent fraudulent products from en-
tering the marketplace, to acquire bet-
ter data of the situation in the market-
place, and to fund the balance of FDA 
activities. To prevent shortages from 
happening again, funds will strengthen 
the 
workforce 
focused 
on 
formula 
issues and increase the FDA’s inspec-
tion staff. 
The FDA needs resources to be able 
to get this work done quickly, and 
safely, and that includes building their 
workforce. Right now, they have only 
nine people on staff inspecting and re-
viewing the submissions that could in-
crease the number of FDA-approved fa-
cilities developing infant formula. It is 
not enough. 
Being able to have more staff who are 
doing this job will ensure FDA can in-
crease the quality of submissions being 
reviewed without risking the quality of 
the review process. We also have their 
funds that will buttress their inspec-
tion teams so that we can get more 
FDA-approved facilities online. 
I am proud that this bill meets this 
urgent need. People are looking for 
some relief, and I am proud that we are 
on the floor tonight to ensure that 
families get this help as soon as pos-
sible. 
But we should not, and we will not be 
made to choose between the health and 
the safety of our babies and the supply 
that keeps them fed. I reject this dan-
gerous and false dichotomy. 
Let me be clear: The funding in this 
bill seeks to address the shortage now, 
but we must simultaneously find solu-
tions that prevent this contamination 
and 
the 
shortage 
from 
happening 
again. Our work here is not done. We 
will introduce legislation in the next 
several days to address the root cause 
of the issue so that it does not happen 
again. 
Madam Speaker, we all are heart-
broken, both at the stories of the ba-
bies who died and their mourning fami-
lies, and the millions of moms and dads 
today who are frantic and scrambling 
to find formula, and who, within their 
hearts, are scared that the product 
they may be giving their infant can po-
tentially cause them grave harm. 
That is not who we are. That is not 
who we are. Our babies are our most 
vulnerable, and we must work quickly 
and decisively to make safe formula 
available for every single baby in this 
country who needs it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this absolutely crit-
ical piece of legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 7790, the Infant Formula 
Supplemental Appropriations Act. 
American families are facing yet an-
other crisis. Parents don’t have the ac-
cess to the formula their children need, 
and they are angry and they are fright-
ened; and I understand why they are 
angry and they are frightened. 
There are reports that more than 40 
percent of baby formula is sold out 
across the United States. Some fami-
lies are having to drive hours just so 
their children don’t go to bed hungry. 
At a time when Americans are pay-
ing record-high gas prices, no one can 
afford this. 
We had the opportunity to work 
across the aisle on a bipartisan solu-
tion to this crisis. Unfortunately, the 
text we are considering today has not 
been agreed to by both sides. 
b 1945 
I have four concerns about the bill. 
First, the bill does nothing to force the 
FDA to come up with a plan to address 
the shortage. Second, it does nothing 
to address whether Federal agencies 
have excess formula that could be di-
rected to American households. Third, 
it fails to leverage the Federal Govern-
ment’s existing capabilities to trans-
port formula. Finally, the bill gives the 
FDA an additional $28 million, when 
funds are already available to address 
this issue. 
Two months ago, we increased the 
FDA’s operating budget by $102 mil-
lion. This included an $11 million in-
crease specifically for maternal and in-
fant health and nutrition. There is also 
more than $1 billion that the Depart-
ment of Agriculture has available to 
address supply chain issues. My ques-
tion is: Why can’t these existing funds 
be spent? 
Ultimately, I fear that H.R. 7790 will 
not put more formula on store shelves, 
and that is why I am opposing this bill. 
We should take the time to do it right. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I might just add, just a quick mo-
ment, to indicate to my colleague, who 
is my friend, that, in fact, we did check 
with other departments and agencies, 
and particularly with FEMA, to find 
out what they might have in stock. 
FEMA currently has on hand formula 
for 550 infants for one week. So, in fact, 
we don’t have other Federal agencies 
that do have a stock of infant formula. 
What we have said in the legislation is 
that the FDA must report to House and 
Senate Appropriations Committees on 
a weekly basis of where the money is 
being used, how it is being used, so 
that we have accountability. 
I am really honored to yield to my 
colleague who chairs the Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Agriculture, 
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and Related Agencies. 
This 
is 
coming 
through 
his 
sub-
committee. He has been a tireless 
fighter on this issue, making sure that 
our kids are safe. To that end, he will 
be talking with the director of the 
Food and Drug Administration tomor-
row morning. So he has been really at 
the center of this effort. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 31⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding, and I thank her for her pas-
sion and compassion in confronting 
this issue. 
As chairman of the House Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on Agriculture, 
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and Related Agencies, I 
am 
glad 
to 
support 
Chairwoman 
DELAURO as we address the infant for-
mula crisis facing America. We are 
working toward ensuring that parents 
and other caregivers have access to 
safe and affordable nutrition for the 
babies in their care. 
The emergency funds allocated by 
this bill will help safely expedite the 
inspection of the country’s infant for-
mula supply and quickly get it back on 
the shelves of stores across the coun-
try. 
But we must also address how such a 
crisis came to pass in the first place. 
How did a manufacturer, a company re-
sponsible for over 40 percent of a Na-
tion’s infant formula supply, have an 
unclean facility? How was this situa-
tion left unchecked? How did it lead to 
hospitalization and the death of ba-
bies?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5160 
May 18, 2022 
Congress will be scrutinizing this cri-
sis with the FDA and manufacturers in 
the days ahead. I look forward to my 
subcommittee hosting the first hearing 
in this regard with FDA Commissioner 
Robert Califf tomorrow morning. 
I have often stood on this very floor 
to tout the importance of the FDA and 
how it touches every single family and 
every life in America. Today is a stark 
reminder of that fact. The FDA is at 
the forefront of our system of checks 
to ensure that our food and our medi-
cine, including infant formula, meet 
the nutritional standards, the nutri-
tional needs, and that they are safe for 
our consumers. 
We must ensure the safety of and re-
establish Americans’ confidence in the 
infant formula that they purchase. 
That means getting more inspectors 
out in the field to make sure that the 
drive for corporate profit does not com-
promise infant formula safety. It also 
means making sure families are not 
being sold fake formula or subjected to 
price gouging from bad actors and 
hoarders looking to take advantage of 
the crisis. 
I have heard from families who are 
distraught at the news of this crisis. 
They want to know how a tainted prod-
uct got to the market; how come there 
is not enough baby formula to replen-
ish store shelves; and what we are 
doing to make sure they have access to 
safe baby formula quickly. 
This bill provides the funds to im-
prove the safety of, to reduce fraud in, 
and to better understand the pressures 
and vulnerabilities of the infant for-
mula market. It helps address the 
shortage we face today while getting us 
the data we need to prevent this from 
happening again. 
Families are willing to make tremen-
dous sacrifices for and investments in 
the safety and well-being of their chil-
dren. Making sure their children are 
fed is one of the most fundamental con-
cerns parents face. By passing this bill, 
Congress is standing up for our fami-
lies. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass this bill. Let’s make 
sure that the infants in America have 
safe and available formula. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HARRIS), the acting 
ranking member of the Subcommittee 
on Agriculture, Rural Development, 
Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies. 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Texas for 
yielding me the time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
tonight to H.R. 7790, the Infant For-
mula 
Supplemental 
Appropriations 
Act, a bill that just continues the ma-
jority’s reckless spending spree with-
out actually fixing the infant formula 
crisis this administration caused. 
Like parents across America, I am 
frustrated by the Biden administra-
tion’s lack of urgency to address this 
completely predictable crisis. In fact, 
infant formula supply challenges start-
ed last fall and were exacerbated with 
the Abbott recall of infant formula and 
the facility closing in February. 
At that time, the administration and 
the FDA should have made it a pri-
ority, back in February, to get this 
plant safely back online as quickly as 
possible. Instead, they allowed yet an-
other crisis to occur. In fact, the facil-
ity remains idle 3 months later, with 
just a recent announcement by the 
FDA that they have now come to an 
agreement with Abbott on how to re-
open the plant. 
The answer to the formula shortage 
is the families need more formula, and 
we need to get one of the largest do-
mestic producers of formula safely op-
erating again. 
But this is not a money problem. 
This is a leadership problem. It is an-
other example of this administration’s 
disregard for hardworking American 
families who are already struggling 
with 
record-high 
gas 
prices, 
food 
prices, and inflation soaring to a 40- 
year high. 
All of us have constituents impacted 
by this formula shortage, and this is 
one issue we should have been able to 
address in a bipartisan manner. 
I thank Ranking Member GRANGER 
for her leadership on this issue, offer-
ing 
commonsense 
solutions 
that 
wouldn’t have added to our national 
debt and would have held the FDA ac-
countable for its foot dragging. 
Unfortunately, Republican input was 
dismissed, and this bill just continues 
the Democrats’ strategy of throwing 
money at the same bureaucrats who 
caused the crisis and who have not 
made its solution a priority so that 
that failed agency can hire even more 
bureaucrats. 
This is yet another missed oppor-
tunity to allow Republicans and Demo-
crats to work together for the benefit 
of American families. Instead, the ma-
jority is going it alone, having caused 
this problem just like they caused the 
high gas prices, crime in our streets, 
and rising food prices. They are not 
solving it with this bill; they are just 
spending money and adding to the debt 
our children and grandchildren have to 
repay. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill, come back 
to the table, work with Republicans, 
and let’s have a bipartisan solution. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I just say to my col-
league that, in fact, one would suspect 
from listening to our colleague that 
Abbott Nutrition was ready to really 
move forward and to deal with reopen-
ing. The fact of the matter is, I have 
said that the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration dragged their feet by not look-
ing at what they were doing in Octo-
ber, et cetera. 
But the FDA had to go to court to 
get an agreement with Abbott about 
how to open. This wasn’t a company 
that was taking on their culpability in 
knowingly 
selling 
a 
contaminated 
product that puts our babies at risk. 
Going to court, that is just a part of 
the delay with moving, is having to 
have to go to court to do this. 
Congressman PALLONE has spent so 
much of his professional career focused 
on food safety issues and, in fact, as 
the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Agriculture, 
Rural Development, Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, and Related Agencies is 
doing hearings, the Energy and Com-
merce Committee will be doing hear-
ings on this issue as well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE), the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the In-
fant Formula Supplemental Appropria-
tions Act. 
I particularly thank Appropriations 
Committee 
Chairwoman 
ROSA 
DELAURO for all she has done to shed 
light on the contamination of infant 
formula and the problems with FDA 
enforcement. She talks about me, but I 
will talk about her, because she has 
really taken this issue to heart for 
such a long period of time. 
I have to say that I am extremely 
upset listening to the Members on the 
other side, the Republicans, talk about 
this crisis and how it could have been 
avoided. I have been on the Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee 
for 
over 
30 
years. FDA’s policies of food safety, 
unlike that for drugs and medical de-
vices, are not based on fees paid by the 
manufacturers. This is because Repub-
licans in the past have not been willing 
to impose those fees on the manufac-
turers. 
I can tell you from personal experi-
ence, when I tried to include a fee 
structure in food safety initiatives in 
the past before my committee, the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee, every 
time, it was opposed by the Repub-
licans because they were listening to 
the manufacturers who didn’t want 
that fee schedule imposed on them. We 
have it for drugs. We have it for med-
ical devices. We don’t have it for food 
safety, and that is right in the hands of 
the Republican leadership. 
I am not particularly blaming the ap-
propriators today, because this was not 
an appropriations issue. This was an 
Energy and Commerce issue. But to 
suggest in some way that this is the 
Democrats, I will tell you, it is the Re-
publicans. If that money had been in 
place, we would have had the inspec-
tors, and we would have had the abil-
ity, in my opinion, to do a lot more on 
the issue of food safety. So this crisis, 
to some extent, is based on the Repub-
licans’ unwillingness to adopt a fee 
schedule and provide that regular 
source of funding for the FDA. 
Now, let me also say that in addition 
to the emergency funding, the House is 
also voting tonight to grant flexibility 
to the WIC program. I thank the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor for 
that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5161 
May 18, 2022 
The Biden administration has taken 
a number of important actions to re-
spond to this shortage, including work-
ing with manufacturers to increase 
production and encouraging importa-
tion of safe infant formula. Today, as 
the chairwoman of Appropriations said, 
the operation the White House has an-
nounced, including the use of the De-
fense Production Act, shows that this 
administration has continued to com-
mit to end this crisis. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee also today unanimously passed 
a measure to allow the FDA to stream-
line processes for hiring highly skilled 
professionals and retain them with 
competitive salaries. This will help to 
ensure our infant formula supply is 
safe and inspectors are on the job. 
Now, I just want to say, Madam 
Speaker, manufacturers have to do a 
better job in the future to alert the 
FDA of potential shortages so we can 
shift production quickly. The FDA 
must be empowered to move more 
quickly to set limits on contamination, 
which is currently bogged down in long 
and cumbersome regulatory processes. 
We understand that more needs to be 
done, but this bill needs to be passed 
today. 
b 2000 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. HINSON). 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Texas for yield-
ing on this very important topic. 
Mr. Speaker, families across this 
country are desperate for help. Babies 
are going hungry. Mothers and fathers 
are faced with empty shelves, and there 
is no formula to be found. 
As a mother, this is heartbreaking. 
As a Congresswoman, this is unaccept-
able. That is why I will be offering a 
motion to recommit this bill in just a 
few moments. 
According to the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, the FDA, 67 percent of 
children rely on infant formula for 
some portion of their nutrition by the 
time they are 3 months old. One of my 
children had to have formula. That is 
2.7 million babies that need formula 
their 
parents 
cannot 
find 
on 
the 
shelves in their local supermarket or 
anywhere, for that matter. 
We need to address this supply chain 
crisis right now. Our families deserve 
solutions. The Biden administration ig-
nored the warning signs that a formula 
shortage was imminent, sitting on 
their hands until the shelves were bare. 
Their incompetence underscores the 
need for funding to come with guard-
rails and accountability for the FDA’s 
failures. 
Throwing additional money at a 
problem is the wrong approach. Amer-
ican families need a plan to fix this cri-
sis and to get that baby formula back 
on store shelves, and they don’t need us 
spending more of their hard-earned 
money to do it. 
My amendment would redirect a tar-
geted amount of unused pandemic 
funds to address the baby formula 
shortage. It would use $5.75 million of 
existing Federal funds to respond to 
this crisis immediately, right now. 
My amendment would also require 
the FDA to report to Congress on the 
shortage, ensuring that the American 
people know exactly what the adminis-
tration is doing or is not doing to get 
formula back on the shelves. 
We would also immediately require 
an assessment of all baby formula 
stockpiled by the Federal Government. 
Can this formula be redirected to the 
marketplace for families? Can we do 
that right now? 
This amendment ensures the FDA 
Commissioner can’t travel anywhere 
unless it is related to the baby formula 
crisis until this crisis is addressed. 
Mr. Speaker, we have seen the im-
pact this baby formula crisis is having 
across our country—the mom whose 
baby can tolerate only a certain kind 
of formula, the dad who is scouring 
Facebook groups tonight trying to see 
if he can find what his baby needs, or 
the grandparents who have gone to 
three grocery stores, driven miles, and 
are still empty-handed. 
We have an opportunity here to real-
ly work together and enact meaningful 
legislation that will get baby formula 
back on store shelves as soon as pos-
sible and ensure that our families are 
not ever left in a lurch like this again. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to-
night to join me, join us, in fighting for 
families, for babies, and for taxpayers. 
We can do it all together. Vote ‘‘yes’’ 
tonight on the motion to recommit. 
Adopt my amendment, and let’s get 
this baby formula crisis under control. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote tonight on the motion to 
recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KIL-
DEE). Is there objection to the request 
of the gentlewoman from Iowa? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I will say to my col-
league who just spoke that, in fact, I 
just talked about what FEMA has in 
terms of stocks, which would take care 
of infants for about 1 week, but I would 
call her attention to the article that 
appeared on May 10, ‘‘Military stores 
scrambling to get baby formula: What 
new parents need to know.’’ 
Military families are dealing with 
the same shortage of baby formula. 
Now, they would have a supply. I take 
it from what my colleague said that we 
should take the product from military 
families, who are serving in the service 
of this country, take their formula and 
move it around. 
We know where the product is, and 
we know we do not have enough. We 
know that we need to move. As to what 
we are doing and suggesting that we 
move to import from FDA facilities 
that are overseas, there are seven of 
them where we can get product on the 
shelves as quickly as possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY), the chairwoman 
of the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. Oversight and reform is Con-
gresswoman MALONEY’s stock-in-trade, 
and she is all over this issue as well. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding and for her extraor-
dinary leadership in responding to this 
crisis so comprehensively and quickly 
and also for her leadership as the chair 
of the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
emergency spending that builds on the 
Biden administration’s progress in ad-
dressing the nationwide infant formula 
shortage by providing the FDA with re-
sources to increase supply and prevent 
future shortages. 
The 
national 
formula 
shortage 
threatens the health and economic se-
curity of America’s infants and fami-
lies, especially those who experience 
health inequities, including food inse-
curity. 
In recent weeks, parents across the 
country have been forced to ration food 
or travel for hours to obtain formula. 
For parents of infants with special 
health needs, the nationwide formula 
shortage 
has 
been 
especially 
dire. 
Some parents have considered going to 
the emergency room just so that they 
can feed their babies. This is unaccept-
able. 
We cannot sit by while families 
struggle to feed their babies. That is 
why the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform has started an investigation to 
support the work of the legislative 
committees—the 
Energy 
and 
Com-
merce and Appropriations Commit-
tees—that are putting forward legisla-
tion to address this. 
We sent letters to the CEOs of the 
four largest baby formula manufactur-
ers, pressing them on their plans to 
boost supply. When are they going to 
have the formula back on the shelves 
in the stores? What caused this? What 
are they doing to prevent future short-
ages? 
I am proud to support, with my 
Democratic and, hopefully, Republican 
colleagues, today’s bill, which will ap-
propriate $28 million for FDA to safely 
increase our supply of infant formula 
and prevent future shortages so that 
this will never happen again. 
I thank Chair DELAURO for her lead-
ership. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Biden 
administration for invoking the De-
fense Production Act to act on this. 
They are also moving to import safe 
products from other countries. I ap-
plaud the President’s leadership, but I 
especially applaud the leadership in 
this Congress, Speaker PELOSI, Leader 
HOYER, Chair DELAURO, Chair PAL-
LONE, all the people who have been in-
volved in helping America’s infants.

May 18, 2022 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this important 
bill. We should be unified for our chil-
dren in this country. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, we all 
share the view that the infant formula 
shortage is a crisis. The stories that we 
have all heard—mothers and fathers 
struggling to find formula, the images 
of empty store shelves—are heart-
breaking. We have all heard from con-
stituents all over this country that 
parents are scared. They can’t find the 
product, and they are scared that they 
are going to have a product that may 
put their child in danger. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to address two 
areas. We need to address the imme-
diate crisis to get product on the 
shelves as soon as we can, which is 
what this bill does tonight, along with 
other measures that the administra-
tion is taking. 
There are some very serious under-
lying issues that we face. The question 
arises, how did we get here? How did 
this happen? 
One of the biggest issues and con-
cerns is the whole issue of the consoli-
dation of the industry. There are only 
four manufacturers of infant formula 
in the United States, and when one of 
the four has produced a contaminated 
product, knowingly putting our babies 
at risk, yes, and they fought the FDA 
on really calling for a recall. The FDA, 
again, had to go to district court to be 
able to move to a consent decree to 
talk about cleaning up the mess in 
Sturgis, Michigan. 
When that product came off the shelf, 
43 percent of the product was gone be-
cause that is the piece that Abbott has. 
They have cornered the market. We 
need to address that root problem of 
sole-source contracting. This is preva-
lent in the meatpacking industry as 
well. 
We cannot just rely on four producers 
of infant formula. We have to take a 
look at that, and that will be inves-
tigated. 
There is an inspector general inves-
tigation going on that will take a look 
at the issues of the contamination and 
that underlying cause. We will inves-
tigate why it took so long for the 
FDA—4 months—to look at addressing 
this issue when they had knowledge 
that this company was selling a con-
taminated product, with some very 
courageous whistleblower coming for-
ward to tell the story. 
Those pieces are going to be inves-
tigated. In my view, we will follow the 
investigation to where the difficulties 
are, and we will hold people account-
able for that. 
In the meantime, we have a responsi-
bility. That responsibility is to make 
sure that there is infant formula on the 
shelves that parents can get access to, 
and that is what this bill is about. That 
is what our efforts are all about, giving 
the Food and Drug Administration re-
sources to deal with the supply chain, 
to be able to go to the seven producers 
overseas. There are seven countries 
that are FDA approved: France, Ger-
many, the Netherlands, Switzerland, 
Denmark, and Ireland are FDA ap-
proved. 
Again, I will state my view. We only 
need to go to FDA-approved facilities, 
not open the door to facilities where we 
cannot deal with what their standards 
are in short order. 
That is what the resources here can 
help the FDA do. It would increase 
their inspection force. It would in-
crease their ability to look at infant 
formula submissions so they can move 
quickly to approve facilities and give 
that approval and, in the meantime, 
move to get the product back here. 
As the President announced today, 
we will be able to use our airplanes. We 
can get product here rapidly. 
Again, it should come from FDA-ap-
proved facilities. That is what we are 
about tonight. That is what it is. It is 
not about politics. We are going to in-
vestigate what happened here. 
Let’s come together. Let’s move to-
gether to address a nationwide chal-
lenge and a problem that we face. Let’s 
not continue to put mothers and fa-
thers and babies at risk. We have the 
responsibility to do something tonight, 
to make it happen, and I urge my col-
leagues, we cannot let any baby be at 
risk of going to sleep hungry in this 
country. We must act quickly. There is 
no room for error. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 7790, the Infant For-
mula Supplemental Appropriations Act which 
would provide $28 million in emergency sup-
plemental appropriations to address the short-
age of infant formula in the United States. 
I thank my good friend and colleague, 
Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, for introducing 
this important bill that addresses the ongoing 
national crisis in shortages of infant baby for-
mula. 
The bill provides appropriations for the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) to: 
address the current shortage of FDA-regu-
lated infant formula and certain medical foods 
in the United States; and 
prevent future shortages by taking nec-
essary steps to block fraudulent products from 
entering the U.S. market. 
This is the first time in recorded memory 
that our Nation has had a substantial shortage 
of infant formula. 
Babies are in need and parents and care-
givers are desperate to find formula to feed 
their children. 
As the founder and Chair of the Congres-
sional Children’s Caucus, I have worked to ad-
dress the needs of women, families, and chil-
dren. 
On Saturday, May 14, 2022, I hosted a 
baby formula giveaway and was joined by the 
National Association of Christian Churches 
(NACC), a 501(c)(3) organization to provide 
free baby formula to eight hundred families in 
need of formula for the babies. 
The formula provided would only last a few 
days, but it was important because it gave 
families a few more days to find more formula 
for their children. 
I am in strong support of this bill and H.R. 
7791, a bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 
1966 to establish waiver authority to address 
certain emergencies, disasters, and supply 
chain disruptions, which includes providing re-
lief during this baby formula crisis. 
I serve on the House Committees on the 
Budget and Homeland Security, both of which 
have oversight or funding responsibilities for 
addressing this current crisis. 
As many parents know, there has been a 
short supply of baby formula nationwide for 
months, due to pandemic-related supply chain 
issues. 
That shortage is now a crisis after four chil-
dren became sick, and two died, after sus-
pected bacterial contamination of formula 
which originated from Abbott Nutrition’s for-
mula plant in Sturgis, Michigan. 
The FDA’s Coordinated Outbreak Response 
and Evaluation (CORE) Network, along with 
the CDC and state and local partners inves-
tigated the issue. 
According to the FDA, CORE is no longer 
investigating the incident, but the FDA estab-
lished an Incident Management Group (IMG) 
on April 1, to continue to work on supply chain 
and food safety issues. 
Although the source of the contamination 
has been determined and the investigation 
has ended, the baby formula shortage prob-
lems continue to remain around the country, 
and the recall is still in effect. 
Currently, the nationwide out-of-stock rate 
for baby formula has reached a high of 43 
percent. 
Over fifty percent of the infant formula pro-
duced in the United States goes to the Special 
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants, and Children (commonly known as the 
WIC program). 
WIC serves to safeguard the health of low- 
income women, infants, and children younger 
than 5 who are at nutritional risk. 
Infants must eat every three to four hours 
and their formula or breast milk must have 
certain nutrients in order to provide them with 
essential nutrition for their growth and devel-
opment. 
Oftentimes, formula feeding exists on a con-
tinuum with breast feeding. 
There is no substitute for formula feeding 
because only 1 in 4 infants breastfeed exclu-
sively. 
For parents who depend on baby formula 
either out of choice or necessity, this crisis 
has the potential of impacting an entire gen-
eration of infants for the rest of their lives. 
Desperation is overwhelming parents, and 
some are turning to making their own baby 
formula at home. 
Pediatricians caution against homemade 
baby formula as it runs the risk of not pro-
viding the right amount of nutrients necessary 
for healthy development. 
Not having the correct formula can put a 
child’s physical and mental development at 
risk due to malnourishment that could occur if 
the formula is not correct. 
This is not an issue that parents can easily 
solve at home. 
This places the onus on the manufacturers 
of baby formula and the Congress to handle 
the supply chain issues to deliver formula to 
parents and caregivers as quickly as possible. 
This bill would give money to ensure that al-
ready existing formula brands are safe and 
can return to shelves as soon as possible.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5163 
May 18, 2022 
According to CBS News, more than half of 
all baby formula products available in Texas 
are completely sold out, with an out-of-stock 
rate at 52.5 percent in Houston. 
The baby formula shortage is hitting poorer 
communities disproportionately hard. 
According to an article from CNN, about half 
of WIC beneficiaries lost access to baby for-
mula when their major supplier, Abbott Nutri-
tion, recalled their products. 
The shortage has left all parents with less 
choices and is adding further pressure to al-
ready existing economic disparities. 
Recently, I partnered with the National As-
sociation of Christian Churches to distribute 
baby formula at Jack Yates High School to my 
constituents in Houston. 
Ovie and Mikayla Cade are just two of the 
many parents that have been struggling to 
feed their baby and looked to the drive for 
much needed support. 
A drive like this provides short-term relief for 
an issue that requires institutional action to 
create long-term changes. 
That is why for the time being I plan to 
reach out to national disaster organizations to 
pull together resources to provide immediate 
support for these families. 
This shortage transcends state lines and re-
quires a joint effort on all fronts to get these 
infants the nutrition they need as quickly as 
possible. 
I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 
7790 for the Infant Formula Supplemental Ap-
propriations Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1124, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time.

APPOINTMENT OF INDIVIDUAL TO 
NATIONAL 
SECURITY 
COMMIS-
SION 
ON 
EMERGING 
BIO-
TECHNOLOGY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair announces the Speaker’s ap-
pointment, 
pursuant 
to 
section 
1091(b)(1)(E) of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 
(Public Law 117–81), and the order of 
the House of January 4, 2021, of the fol-
lowing individual on the part of the 
House to the National Security Com-
mission on Emerging Biotechnology: 
Mr. Eric Emerson Schmidt, Los An-
geles, California 
f 
RISING CRIME 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, 234,088 il-
legal immigrants crossed the southern 
border last month. That is a record- 
breaking number that I take no pleas-
ure in saying aloud. This surpassed the 
previous record of 221,303 set just in 
March. 
In President Biden’s first 15 months 
in office, Federal law enforcement offi-
cials have stopped more than 2.75 mil-
lion people attempting to cross into 
the U.S. illegally. To put things in per-
spective, that is more than the entire 
population of the Nashville, Tennessee, 
metropolitan area. 
Despite continuously breaking these 
records, the President has shown abso-
lutely no serious desire to stem the 
flow of illegal immigration, as evi-
denced by his rescission of title 42 and 
his stopping of construction on the bor-
der wall. 
Madam Speaker, President Biden 
must do better. 
f 
BENEFITS OF VITAMIN D FOR 
COVID–19 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
the good news is the COVID pandemic 
is kind of under control. Nevertheless, 
we still have about 250 people a day 
who die of COVID and over 1 million 
people have died in this country. 
I think one of the failures of the pub-
lic health establishment and the med-
ical establishment is the failure to edu-
cate the public about the benefits of vi-
tamin D. Researchers found that if you 
have inadequate vitamin D levels, de-
fined as under 200 nanograms per milli-
liter, you are 11 times as likely to die 
of the disease. 
Can you imagine how many lives 
would have been saved if we tested for 
vitamin D and everybody had adequate 
vitamin D in their blood? 
The 
public 
health 
establishment 
failed us by not educating the public 
enough on vitamin D, and it is time we 
stepped it up, even though it looks like 
we are near the end of the pandemic. 
And the medical establishment ought 
to always test for vitamin D with peo-
ple who are at risk for this disease, 
particularly people with darker skin, 
and particularly people who are a little 
heavy. It is very important to test for 
vitamin D. 
I know the medical establishment 
feels that they might not get reim-
bursed quite enough from the insur-
ance companies, but I will tell you, 
people in the medical establishment, 
and I am talking about the administra-
tors, in particular, who are making 
these judgments, ought to put profit 
aside for a second and make sure that 
we get these tests on people, because if 
they come under 20 nanograms, they 
are greatly at risk for dying. 
f 
ADJOURNMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
PRESSLEY). Pursuant to section 11(b) of 
House Resolution 188, the House stands 
adjourned until 9 a.m. tomorrow. 
Thereupon (at 10 o’clock and 59 min-
utes p.m.), under its previous order, the 
House 
adjourned

tomorrow, 
Thursday, May 19, 2022, at 9 a.m.

Let us pray. 
Almighty God, our strong tower, con-
tinue to be our defender and guide. 
Lead our lawmakers in their work so 
that they will make Your priorities 
their priorities. Provide them with the 
patience, integrity, and compassion to

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
CRIME 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
Americans’ 
concern 
about 
violent 
crime is the highest it has been in 6 
years, and the statistics plainly show 
why that is. Between 2019 and 2020, the 
murder rate shot up by the largest 
1-year increase in over a century, and 
the rate has kept on rising. 
Nearly 60 percent more law enforce-
ment officers were killed in 2021 com-
pared to 2020. Cities all across America 
set alltime record highs for homicides 
last year. My hometown of Louisville, 
KY, was one of those cities. We also 
now average more than one carjacking 
every 48 hours. 
Innocent 
citizens 
across 
America 
know this situation has literally spi-
raled out of control, but, unfortu-
nately, the Biden administration and 
Senate Democrats continue to team up 
and find new ways to go soft on crime. 
The nomination and confirmation of 
Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court 
crowns a deliberate effort by Demo-
crats to make the Federal judiciary lit-
erally softer on crime. They are spe-
cifically intentionally stuffing the Fed-
eral bench full of men and women 
whose starting perspective tilts toward 
sympathy for criminals rather than 
victims. 
Even the New York Times had to 
admit this ‘‘concerted push by the 
Biden administration’’ to prefer nomi-
nees with ‘‘experience in criminal de-
fense work’’ is ‘‘a sea change in the 
world of judicial nominations.’’ 
The Times continued: 
The type of high-profile murder cases han-
dled by some of Mr. Biden’s nominees would 
have been considered disqualifying only a 
few years ago; now the president, who him-
self served briefly as a public defender early 
in his legal career, is actively seeking to 
name more jurists who have [that kind of] 
experience. 
So, Mr. President, we are not arguing 
that public defenders ought to be ex-
cluded from the nomination process. 
Clearly, their work is important. Ev-
eryone deserves a lawyer, even the 
most heinous criminals. But the Amer-
ican people are not exactly clamoring 
for President Biden to dramatically 
tilt the entire judiciary toward the 
criminal-friendly perspective—least of 
all during this historic crime surge. 
This week, with a long list of serious 
problems 
facing 
the 
country, 
the 
Democratic majority has decided to 
spend floor time on another judicial 
nominee with this one particular back-
ground, a second nominee who ap-
peared during her committee hearing 
to be unfamiliar with a basic concept 
in trial law, and a third nominee whose

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2554 
May 18, 2022 
pro bono record includes helping sue 
the New York City government over 
policing and trying to reverse another 
person’s robbery conviction. So I would 
urge Senators to oppose these con-
troversial nominees. 
I am proud to be one of many Repub-
licans joining a new resolution from 
Senator 
CASSIDY
begging 
this 
all- 
Democratic government to prioritize 
solutions for the violent crime wave. 
To start, the administration should 
stop this willful—willful—campaign to 
make the judiciary systemically softer 
on crime. Innocent Americans can’t af-
ford it. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, now on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, the Ukraine people and 
their fight to repel Russian invaders 
from their sovereign territory has been 
inspiring. 
The 
world 
is 
watching 
Ukraine respond to gut-wrenching vio-
lence with bravery and with unity. 
I encourage President Biden to do 
more 
to 
strengthen 
Ukraine 
and 
NATO’s defenses well in advance so as 
to deter Putin and improve Ukraine’s 
initial ability to resist aggression. 
Many Republicans shared my view that 
President Biden should have done more 
to help Ukraine more quickly. 
Fortunately, as the Ukrainians have 
stood strong, President Biden has done 
more and more to help them in the 
fight. We are now investing to ensure 
Ukraine’s forces are equipped to win 
and the arsenals of NATO allies who 
have joined in support can be replen-
ished. 
As I explained yesterday, American 
support for Ukraine is not mere altru-
ism. The outcome of Ukraine’s fight to 
preserve its sovereignty will have mas-
sive consequences for our own strategic 
interests, both in Europe and much far-
ther afield. 
So let’s start with just that con-
tinent. Europe is home to some of 
America’s longest-standing friendships 
and deepest trading partnerships. If 
Vladimir Putin’s thuggish imperialism 
found success in Ukraine, America and 
our allies would certainly feel the ef-
fects. Prior to the current conflict in 
Ukraine, 
Putin’s 
creeping 
expan-
sionism, his interventions and manipu-
lations of so-called frozen conflicts 
from 
Georgia 
and 
Crimea 
and 
Transnistria, only emboldened him. He 
must be stopped. 
Beyond Europe’s borders, Putin’s fel-
low strongmen are watching all this to 
find out whether it is safe to follow his 
lead. In Beijing, President Xi’s Com-
munist Party is looking for a green 
light to apply the Russian model to 
their own wish list of sovereign terri-
tories to subjugate, starting, of course, 
with Taiwan. For their part, the Tai-
wanese people know they are in the 
crosshairs. As they demonstrated in 
solidarity with the people of Ukraine, 
the warning on the island in recent 
months has been ‘‘Today Ukraine. To-
morrow, Taiwan.’’ 
As Taiwan’s Foreign Minister put it 
recently 
in 
the 
Washington 
Post, 
‘‘[T]he war in Ukraine has made it 
clear to the world how important it is 
for democracies to stand shoulder to 
shoulder against authoritarian aggres-
sion.’’ 
Fortunately, fellow democracies in 
the Indo-Pacific are doing exactly that. 
Earlier this month, Japan’s Defense 
Minister acknowledged that China has 
been ‘‘carefully observing’’ both ‘‘Rus-
sia’s aggression’’ and the reactions of 
the 
international 
community. 
And 
Prime Minister Kishida reaffirmed that 
we must ‘‘never tolerate a unilateral 
attempt to change the status quo by 
the use of force in the Indo Pacific.’’ 
From Kyiv to Taipei and to Tokyo, 
America’s friends and partners see Rus-
sia’s behavior for exactly what it is: a 
dangerous spark to be stamped out. 
Ukraine is succeeding in large part be-
cause it took its security seriously. Es-
pecially 
since 
the 
2014 
invasion, 
Ukraine reformed its military training, 
doctrine, and operations. They aban-
doned the outdated Soviet model for a 
more dynamic Western approach. With 
help from the West, Ukraine invested 
in its capabilities. 
Other allies and partners should heed 
these lessons sooner rather than later. 
They should invest in their own de-
fenses, seek interoperability with like- 
minded partners, and seize opportuni-
ties to train with top-tier militaries 
like our own. We must continue to help 
them do exactly that. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
BUFFALO, NEW YORK, SHOOTING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday, I joined with President Biden, 
Senator GILLIBRAND, and New York of-
ficials on one of the most difficult and 
painful trips imaginable. 
Visiting Buffalo 3 days after the 
worst mass shooting in its history was 
harrowing. I met a young boy, just 3 
years old, who I learned lost his dad on 
Saturday because his dad was at Tops 
supermarket buying a birthday cake 
for the 3-year-old boy—a routine er-
rand for a joyous occasion, something 
every parent looks forward to. In the 
blink of an eye, his life was unfairly 
and cruelly taken away simply because 
he was Black and in a supermarket. 
It is tempting to think that this evil 
is beyond comprehension, but we know 
it is just not true. We know the shooter 
drew from the same wells of hate and 
White supremacy that inspired other 
shootings in El Paso, Pittsburgh, At-
lanta, Charleston, and other commu-
nities. By now, we know the shooter 
was inspired by a deranged conspiracy 
theory known as the ‘‘great replace-
ment.’’ Indeed, in his online posts, he 
labeled the people he targeted as ‘‘re-
placers.’’ 
But the truth is that you don’t need 
to visit the dark corners of the inter-
net to see these White supremacist 
views anymore. You can find replace-
ment theory on cable networks like 
FOX News, where Tucker Carlson used 
White replacement rhetoric on at least 
400 episodes of his show. You can hear 
it at most Trump rallies every time the 
Republican standard-bearer vilifies un-
documented immigrants and spreads 
the lie that they stole the 2020 election. 
Last night, the GOP in Pennsylvania 
nominated a hard-right disciple of the 
Big Lie as their candidate for Gov-
ernor. You can also find many exam-
ples of replacement theory on Twitter. 
One House Member said in April that 
Tucker Carlson ‘‘is CORRECT about 
Replacement Theory as he explains 
what is happening to America.’’ 
The radical views of MAGA Repub-
licans are taking over the GOP like a 
cancer. We saw it play out earlier this 
month in the wake of the Supreme 
Court’s possible elimination of Roe, as 
they suggested national bans on abor-
tion and championed restrictions with-
out exceptions for rape or incest. Now 
we are seeing it here, as MAGA Repub-
licans openly champion a repressive 
and conspiratorial view of who deserves 
to be called American. 
To its credit, the Wall Street Journal 
Editorial Board wrote a few days ago 
that politicians have an ‘‘obligation’’ 
to condemn conspiracies like White re-
placement theory. But 4 days after the 
shooting in Buffalo, it is dangerous and 
disturbing to see that many on the 
right have pointedly refused to con-
demn replacement theory. This should 
be the easiest thing in the world to do, 
but many on the right, including too 
many in this Chamber, can’t seem to 
bring themselves to say the obvious: 
that White replacement theory is evil 
and has no place in our politics, and 
any candidate or pundit who spreads it 
should be resoundingly condemned. 
We are waiting to hear more of our 
colleagues condemn the MAGA right 
and condemn this horrible replacement 
theory. So far, there is just too much 
silence, even though a few have. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. President, on Ukraine, on a dif-
ferent matter, the Senate is moving 
forward on a number of high-priority 
items impacting our security, our eco-
nomic prosperity, and our commitment 
to take care of veterans. So this is a 
busy week for the Senate once again. 
Tomorrow, I expect the Senate will 
finish the critical task of approving an-
other round of military, humanitarian, 
and economic aid for the people of 
Ukraine. This should already have been 
done and over with, but it is repugnant 
that one Member of the other side, the 
junior Senator from Kentucky, chose 
to make a show and obstruct Ukraine 
funding, knowing full well he couldn’t 
actually stop its passage. For Senator 
PAUL
to delay Ukraine funding for

purely political motives is to only 
strengthen Putin’s hand. The major-
ity—vast majority—of Democrats and 
Republicans want to see this legisla-
tion done, and get it done we will, as 
soon as tomorrow. 
Off the floor, the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee will mark up the 
nomination of Bridget Brink to serve 
as U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. Ms. 
Brink’s nomination is terrific news at 
a critical moment for Ukraine and the 
United States. She is deeply experi-
enced. She has already won bipartisan 
support in this Chamber, and she is 
very much needed as the United States 
seeks to strengthen our democratic 
ties to the war-torn nation. Ms. Brink’s 
nomination will be a top priority to 
the Senate when she comes before the 
Chamber. 
RESTAURANTS 
Mr. President, on a different mat-
ter—the restaurants bill—tomorrow, 
the Senate is going to hold a vote on 
legislation to help our restaurants, 
gyms, minor league teams, and other 
small businesses that have been utterly 
devastated by the COVID pandemic. 
This bill, championed by my col-
leagues Senator CARDIN, a Democrat, 
and Senator WICKER, a Republican— 
which I very strongly support—will 
help restaurants and other small busi-
nesses like gyms that were left out in 
earlier rounds of emergency aid. Every 
proposal included in this package is bi-
partisan. 
Some have said: Well, COVID is over, 
and the restaurants are back. I see 
them sort of full. 
That may be true for some res-
taurants, but for just about every res-
taurant, there is a shortage of labor, 
and many are only opening at limited 
times. Most of the restaurants I speak 
to are either closed certain days, don’t 
serve lunches, or whatever, because 
they can’t find labor. 
Let’s not forget that many of the res-
taurants, 
particularly 
the 
smaller 
ones, the nonchain ones, had to borrow 
during COVID, borrow large amounts 
of money. They need to repay that 
money, and they can’t do it based on 
their limited incomes that are occur-
ring right now. If they don’t get the 
money to pay it back, the lenders are 
going 
to 
foreclose 
and 
close 
res-
taurants that are already back on the 
road to prospering and recovering. 
That makes no sense. 
We must pass this legislation. I hope 
we will get a good number of our Re-
publican colleagues to join Senator 
WICKER in supporting this. Two years 
into this crisis, the idea that res-
taurant owners have all recovered 
could not be further from the truth. 
Restaurants are part of the fabric of 
every Main Street and every tight-knit 
neighborhood. It is where friends run 
into each other on the weekends, grab 
a drink after work, have lunch after 
church. The same can be applied to 
minor league teams and local gyms and 
businesses that support theaters. These 
are places where Americans have al-
ways come together. 
I was proud to champion the $28 bil-
lion restaurant relief in the American 
Rescue Plan, but these establishments, 
as I mentioned, still need our help. To-
morrow, there should be a strong bipar-
tisan show of support to help these 
businesses. 
VETERANS 
Finally, there is another area that 
we will be voting on. There is an im-
portant announcement this morning 
for our Nation’s veterans. Chairman 
TESTER and Ranking Member JERRY 
MORAN of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee will announce a bipartisan 
proposal on comprehensive legislation 
to help millions of our Nation’s vet-
erans who struggle with sickness be-
cause of exposure to toxins during 
their military service, including expo-
sure to toxic burn pits and Agent Or-
ange. 
This has for years—for years—been a 
top priority of mine. I have worked 
closely with advocates like VSOs and 
Jon Stewart and John Feal to get this 
Senate to act on this long-neglected 
problem. I am happy to see burn pit 
legislation has taken an important 
step closer to passage. 
I thank Senators TESTER and MORAN 
for their good work. I strongly support 
the agreement reached by TESTER and 
MORAN, and it is my intention to have 
this on the floor of the Senate the 
week that we return from the Memo-
rial Day work period. 
Our veterans—we will see them on 
Memorial Day—are very eager for this 
bill. I hope veterans throughout the 
country will let their Senators know 
how important this legislation is. Our 
veterans need it, they deserve it, and 
we have a moral obligation to take 
care of those who have sacrificed so 
much for us. 
TRIBUTE TO SUZIE ORLOVE 
Finally, Mr. President, today I want 
to bring special attention and praise to 
Suzie Orlove, my beloved and talented 
and deeply dedicated director of con-
stituent service, who is retiring today 
after 37 amazing years in my office. 
Imagine that. She has worked in my of-
fice—first as a Congressman, then as 
Senator—for 37 years. 
Suzie and I first met in the second 
grade in P.S. 19, Miss Ruth Moore’s 
second grade class, and we have been 
friends ever since. Suzie stood out even 
in second grade for her compassion and 
her intellect. 
Soon after I was elected to the 
House, Suzie came to work in my office 
and dedicated herself to making gov-
ernment work for everyday New York-
ers. She became a healthcare policy ex-
pert, navigating Medicaid, Medicare, 
and facing down often intransigent 
health insurance companies for con-
stituents who often face life-and-death 
challenges. She became a maven navi-
gating the bureaucracy of Social Secu-
rity for our seniors and disabled. Year 
after year, Suzie oversaw the process of 
interviewing and nominating extraor-
dinary young New Yorkers to our mili-
tary academies. 
The list of people she has helped is 
practically endless. All across New 
York, there are so many people who 
are grateful to Suzie Orlove for helping 
them in ways when they really needed 
help. She is amazing, as is the number 
of staffers she helped train to serve 
New 
Yorkers 
with 
diligence. 
She 
trained my staff—everyone who came 
in—but she also gave lots of advice to 
the staff of other of my colleagues, 
first in Congress and now in the Sen-
ate. 
She is amazing—amazing. 
Suzie Orlove, every day you came 
into work, you were dedicated to help-
ing people—something that has always 
been a part of you. You were the strong 
glue in the office, teaching so many 
others who came and went how to help 
people, do casework, and do it with 
fierce dedication but a friendly smile 
as well. 
All our office staff—past, present, 
and future—are grateful to Suzie for 
who she is and what she has done. 
Suzie, thank you for your service. To 
quote the old song, ‘‘We’re gonna miss 
you when you’re gone.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the ma-
jority leader reminds us of the tragedy 
that occurred in Buffalo over the week-
end and how the shooter was somehow 
captivated by the notion of replace-
ment theory—a theory which is so in-
sane and so mean-spirited that it ig-
nores what this country is all about. 
A few minutes ago, over at what they 
call the House swamp, we held a press 
conference. Senator ALEX PADILLA of 
California, 
myself, 
Congresswoman 
ROSS, and Congressman BERA met with 
a group of young people. There were 
about 50 of them. Some were high 
school age; some were in college. They 
are the sons and daughters of people 
who came to the United States on H–1B 
visas. These are visas where people are 
allowed to come here for a period of 
years and work, and the visas can be 
renewed. 
Children and families who accom-
pany them are growing up in America, 
living in America, while the bread-
winner goes off to work each day, but 
the clock is ticking. When the kids of 
these visa holders reach the age of 21, 
they are subject to self-deportation. In 
other words, they have no legal rights 
in America to remain. 
The reason that they are in suspense 
for so long is that the green card back-
log can be decades while the parents 
are waiting for permission to become 
legal in the United States on a perma-
nent basis. So these young people live 
in uncertainty. 
Senator PADILLA’s bill is an effort— 
and I join with him in that bill—an ef-
fort to give them the opportunity to 
earn their way to citizenship, to be-
come legal in America. Why would we 
give up this talent? These young people 
have grown up in America. They have

been successful in school. They have 
participated in community activities. 
They are ready to be part of America’s 
future, I can tell. 
One young woman got up there and 
told the story of how she came to Cali-
fornia with her parents under similar 
circumstances. She now is completing 
her Ph.D. in biochemistry at Cornell 
University. She wants to go into can-
cer research. Is America better if we 
force her to leave this country at this 
point? She doesn’t think so. She thinks 
she can make this a better nation and 
better world if she can stay in Amer-
ica. 
The folks who are so dead set against 
immigration ought to just pause for a 
moment and meet the people we are 
talking about, the people who are com-
ing into this country, taking the jobs 
which Americans don’t want to take, 
doing things which Americans aspire to 
but don’t achieve, and many other as-
pects of our life that are really en-
riched by their presence. 
So I would urge my colleagues to 
support us in this bipartisan effort for 
this bill. But I would also urge them to 
step back and make it clear, the ‘‘re-
placement theory’’ is an insane ap-
proach to America. It ignores our his-
tory; it ignores our future; and it ig-
nores the reality of our economy 
today. 
E-CIGARETTES 
Mr. President, my family, like many 
families in America, has been touched 
by tobacco-related disease and death. 
My father died of lung cancer when I 
was 14 years old—he was 53. Two packs 
of Camels a day, he got lung cancer and 
died at that age. I still remember it to 
this day, even though it happened over 
60 years ago. I am not alone in that. 
There are so many families that can 
tell that story, sadly. 
And because of it, I have really fo-
cused on stopping Big Tobacco from ad-
dicting more and more Americans and 
sentencing them to death, in many in-
stances, because of their deadly prod-
ucts. 
Over the years, I have had some suc-
cess. It was over 25 years ago that I 
banned smoking on airplanes. Senator 
Frank Lautenberg picked up the bill 
over here on the Senate side, carried it 
successfully, and it was signed into 
law. 
It changed—we didn’t realize it at 
the time, it just changed America’s at-
titude toward smoking. It was, indeed, 
a tipping point. But I have been watch-
ing Big Tobacco ever since. Their ap-
proach to building their market is very 
basic. They have to lure children into 
the addiction. Kids that are not mature 
enough to say no pick up the addiction 
of smoking and end up carrying it to 
their graves, if they are not careful. 
And so we have, over the years, put 
warnings on cigarette packages, raised 
the price beyond the reach of children, 
and done everything that we could. 
Well, these Big Tobacco interests are 
not discouraged. They found a new 
product that is wildly popular among 
young people that creates a similar ad-
diction. 
It’s 
called 
e-cigarettes 
or 
vaping. Ask any of your kids in high 
school, ask the teachers in the schools 
and the principals, what is going on 
with vaping in your schools today? You 
will find it’s wildly popular, and kids 
are taking it up. And many of them 
switch from the vaping products to to-
bacco products and, ultimately, at the 
expense of their health. 
That is what has happened. So we ba-
sically said to the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration: You have a responsibility 
to regulate this. They can’t put their 
products on the shelves without you 
taking a look at it. 
Well, let me tell you the story of 
what has happened. These companies 
have flooded the market with addictive 
vaping devices, companies like JUUL, 
which is partially owned by the to-
bacco companies, and they promoted 
their products to children. 
For years, none of these devices were 
legally authorized, and, yet, they have 
poisoned the developing brains and 
bodies of our kids. Who was supposed 
to be the cop on the beat? The Food 
and Drug Administration in Wash-
ington, but they were nowhere to be 
found. After years and years of the 
FDA failing to regulate e-cigarettes— 
listen to this—a Federal district court 
stepped in and mandated that the Food 
and Drug Administration fulfill its 
statutory public health duty. 
On Friday, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration submitted an update on 
its Agency’s long overdue review of e- 
cigarette applications. 
Listen to this. In it, the Food and 
Drug Administration admitted it will 
not finish reviewing e-cigarettes until 
July 2023, nearly two years past the 
Court’s deadline of last September. 
This is a stunning disclosure. 
This means that JUUL and other e- 
cigarettes that kids get hooked on in 
the nicotine contained in the product 
and which have not received an author-
ization from the FDA may continue to 
be sold with impunity for more than a 
year. Imagine the thousands of stu-
dents who will become addicted to 
these products while the FDA dawdles. 
What is most incredible to me is that 
this outcome is not inevitable. In fact, 
if it wanted to, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, before the end of business 
today, could remove these products by 
regulation from the shelves of Amer-
ica. 
That is right: Addictive e-cigarettes 
like JUUL are only on store shelves be-
cause the FDA has given tobacco com-
panies a free pass to sell their vaping 
products. 
This is just wrong. This is exactly 
the opposite of the intent of the law. 
With 
this 
decision, 
the 
FDA 
is 
complicit in endangering the health of 
America’s kids. That is a powerful 
statement, but I stand by it. 
The law is very clear, no tobacco 
product is supposed to be on store 
shelves unless its manufacturer proves 
to the FDA, prior to marketing, that it 
is appropriate for public health. 
How in the world could you prove 
that a vaping cigarette, e-cigarette, is 
in some way appropriate for the protec-
tion of public health? It is just the op-
posite, and we all know it. 
So today I am beginning by calling 
on the FDA to immediately halt its en-
forcement discretion and remove all 
unauthorized 
e-cigarettes 
from 
the 
market. Don’t allow JUUL and the 
other tobacco companies one more day 
of addicting our children. Stop cow-
ering before Big Tobacco’s highly paid 
lawyers. 
We have seen too many years of 
delay by the FDA to the point where 
the Court had to order them to finally 
exercise their obligations under the 
law, and we have seen too many kids 
hooked on e-cigarettes. If the Food and 
Drug Administration needs more time 
to review applications, protect our 
kids, and clear the market of big tobac-
co’s poison while you are doing it— 
nothing less than the health and well- 
being of our children is on the line. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
AGRICULTURE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, farming 
and ranching are industries that are 
particularly subject to the whims of 
the weather. Just one storm can wipe 
out an entire herd or crop, sometimes 
in a matter of minutes. 
Last Thursday, several storms struck 
eastern South Dakota and farmers 
were hit hard. Fortunately, it was too 
early in the season to wipe out any 
crops, but farmers lost essential equip-
ment and resources, feed, grain bins, 
outbuildings, and more. 
My office will be doing everything it 
can to make sure those affected get the 
assistance they need to recover, and I 
know many are already planning to re-
build. Whether it is a natural disaster 
or an ordinary day, farmers and ranch-
ers are always at the top of my mind 
here in the Senate. Agriculture is the 
lifeblood of our South Dakota econ-
omy, and I am committed to doing ev-
erything I can to ensure that our farm-
ers and ranchers have the resources 
they need to help feed our country. 
I am fortunate enough to be a long- 
time member of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee, which gives me an impor-
tant platform in which to address the 
needs of South Dakota ag producers. 
Right now, a big focus of mine is the 
2023 farm bill. 
I have already held the first of a se-
ries of roundtables to hear from South 
Dakota farmers and ranchers about 
what they need out of the 2023 farm 
bill. And I have introduced the first of 
what will be a number of proposals

that I hope to get included in next 
year’s legislation. 
My Conservation Reserve Program 
Improvement Act, which I introduced 
in March, would make CRP grazing a 
more attractive option by providing 
cost-share payments for all CRP prac-
tices for the establishment of grazing 
infrastructure, including fencing and 
water distribution. 
It would also increase the annual 
payment limit for CRP, which hasn’t 
been changed since 1985, to help ac-
count for inflation and the increase in 
land value. 
I am also working with colleagues 
from agriculture States on legislation 
based on my conversations with South 
Dakota farmers and ranchers. In fact, 
last week I joined Senator KLOBUCHAR 
to introduce the Agriculture Innova-
tion Act. 
Currently, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture collects reams of data on 
conservation practices. The problem is 
that a lot of this data is often not ana-
lyzed and presented in a way that 
would be useful for farmers and ranch-
ers. 
The legislation Senator KLOBUCHAR 
and I have introduced would provide 
for better processing and development 
of the data that the USDA collects so 
that farmers and ranchers can evaluate 
the impact of conservation and other 
production practices on things like soil 
health, crop yields, and profitability. 
Our bill would make it easier for 
farmers and ranchers to decide what 
conservation practices to adopt by, 
among other things, helping producers 
identify the ways adopting conserva-
tion practices can improve their bot-
tom line. 
And Senator KLOBUCHAR and I will be 
working to get this legislation included 
in the 2023 farm bill. In addition to 
farm bill priorities, I have been spend-
ing a lot of time focused on agriculture 
and trade. Our nation’s farmers and 
ranchers already send their products 
around the globe. But with Russia’s 
war in Ukraine and its devastating im-
pact on Ukrainian agriculture, Amer-
ican ag producers are facing an added 
responsibility when it comes to feeding 
the world. 
Unfortunately, for some time now I 
have been hearing reports of ocean car-
riers refusing to transport American 
agricultural products. This would be a 
difficult situation at any time as ex-
port markets around the world are 
critically important to American pro-
ducers, but it is particularly painful at 
a time when inflation is soaring and 
the supply chain is under significant 
strain and when there is an increased 
need to get American agricultural 
products abroad—thanks to the war in 
Ukraine. And that is why I introduced 
legislation, the Ocean Shipping Reform 
Act, to address these kinds of shipping 
problems and create a more level play-
ing field for American agricultural pro-
ducers. 
My bipartisan legislation would give 
the Federal Maritime Commission in-
creased authority to respond to unfair 
ocean carrier practices, whether that 
involves a refusal to carry certain 
cargo, like agricultural commodities, 
or discriminating against certain com-
modities for export. 
It would also provide the FMC with 
tools to more quickly resolve attention 
and demurrage disputes, which would 
bring greater efficiency and trans-
parency to a process that leaves many 
shippers frustrated, especially agri-
culture producers and other small busi-
nesses. 
I was very pleased that the Senate 
passed my bill at the end of March, and 
I am working with my colleagues in 
the House of Representatives to ad-
vance this legislation so we can get it 
to the President’s desk. 
I also recently led a letter with 23 of 
my Senate Republican colleagues to 
the U.S. Trade Representative and the 
Secretary of Agriculture, urging them 
to prioritize increased access to foreign 
markets for American producers, in-
cluding—and especially—American ag 
producers. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion has not made market access com-
mitments a priority in its trade agen-
da, including the proposed Indo-Pacific 
economic framework. And the adminis-
tration has failed to pursue any ambi-
tious market-opening initiatives or 
comprehensive trade agreements. 
Trade has played a large part in 
America’s economic success for dec-
ades, and it is critical for American ag 
producers who depend on exporting 
their products. It is unacceptable that 
the administration has dropped the 
ball in pursuing increased market ac-
cess for American producers. 
I am also less than impressed by the 
President’s failure to put forward a 
confirmable nominee for the post of 
Chief Agricultural Negotiator at the 
Office of the U.S. Trade Representa-
tive. 
And while the President has finally 
put forward a nominee for Under Sec-
retary for Trade and Foreign Agricul-
tural Affairs at the Department of Ag-
riculture, it has taken him far too long 
to fill this position, which plays a crit-
ical role in advocating for American 
producers when it comes to world 
trade. 
I pressed the U.S. Trade Representa-
tive on the administration’s failure to 
prioritize a meaningful trade and agri-
cultural agenda during a recent Fi-
nance Committee hearing, and I will 
continue to maintain pressure on the 
administration to expand export oppor-
tunities for our Nation’s workers, 
farmers, ranchers, and businesses. 
Our Nation depends on our farmers 
and ranchers, and I am profoundly 
grateful for all the determined men and 
women who have chosen and passed on 
this way of life. I am honored to rep-
resent South Dakota’s farmers and 
ranchers here in the Senate, and I will 
continue to do everything I can to en-
sure that they have all the resources 
they need to continue to feed our Na-
tion and the world. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Connecticut. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
MR. MURPHY. Mr. President, the 
conventional wisdom is that one of the 
adaptations that helped humans sepa-
rate ourselves from all other species is 
this—the opposable thumb. The theory 
goes that the transformation of the 
thumb, able to operate by itself inde-
pendently from the rest of our fingers, 
allowed humans to be able to manipu-
late objects with a level of precision 
and dexterity that was previously un-
seen in the animal kingdom, and this 
newly nimble hand allowed humans to, 
for instance, more easily catch fish and 
open fruit, pull out the seeds, this new-
found bounty of fats and proteins. It 
vaulted the human brain into develop-
mental overdrive. 
But about 10 years ago, biologist 
David Carrier, a longtime student of 
the evolution of the human hand, pro-
posed a different theory. What if the 
primary utility of the opposable thumb 
was not to do this, but instead this. 
The ability to tuck your thumb into 
the middle of your four fingers imme-
diately gave humans a more effective 
fighting 
tool—important, 
since 
we 
lacked tusks or fangs or claws like 
other animals. 
Maybe 
the 
development 
that 
mattered most to human development 
was the one that allowed us to become 
more effective fighters not just with 
predators but with ourselves because 
from the beginning, as a species, hu-
mans have been drawn to violence. In 
fact, there are few species, few mam-
mals, that are more violent than hu-
mans. 
There is a really interesting study of 
intraspecies violence, meaning when 
you conduct a violent act against an-
other member of your species, and 
these researchers looked at over 1,000 
mammals. 
What is interesting is that 60 percent 
of 
mammals 
actually 
have 
zero 
intraspecies violence—bats and whales, 
they never attack each other. That 
tells you something, in and of itself; 
that it is not endemic to mammals to 
be violent. 
But what the data showed is that 
right at the top of that list of those 
1,000 species, when it came to the rates 
of intraspecies violence—humans. 
Biologists trace our violence back to 
our earliest days. Without those tusks 
or fangs, humans could really only sur-
vive by grouping ourselves tightly to-
gether. We were quickly rewarded so-
cially and materially for joining up in 
groups. 
But with resources scarce in the 
early human world to survive, you had 
to find a group, and then you had to de-
fend it—defend it against other humans 
who were competing with you for those 
same resources. 
Intertribal violence was epidemic in 
this world in the early days of humans. 
In the bronze age, estimates suggest 
that one out of every three humans

May 18, 2022 
died a violent death at the hands of an-
other human. 
Records suggest that in pre-Colum-
bian America, as many as one out of 
four Native Americans died violently. 
The primary reason? Humans have an 
in-group bias. To survive in those early 
days, we needed to group ourselves 
tightly together and view with fear and 
skepticism members of other outside 
groups who were competitors for those 
scarce resources. 
And 
centuries 
and 
centuries 
of 
human development have hardwired 
this in-group bias, this anxiety about 
out groups into our genetics. 
One 
2012 
study 
determined 
that 
today, when an individual first meets a 
person who is perceived to be outside of 
one’s defined social group, individuals 
demonstrate immediate, almost auto-
matic instinct of anxiety and a surge of 
intention to act on that anxiety. It is 
not conscious; it is genetic. 
And so if humans are hardwired to 
view out-group members as suspicious 
and to act on those suspicions, some-
times violently, then America was des-
tined, by design, to be an abnormally 
violent place. 
Now, why do I say that? 
First, let’s just be totally honest 
with ourselves. Our Nation was founded 
through the use of mass-scale violence. 
There are lots of people who are trying 
to erase these parts of our history as if 
there is some weakness in admitting 
the truth about our past. That is ridic-
ulous. We should just tell the truth 
about our history, and the truth is that 
we exterminated Native Americans in 
order to gain control of this land. We 
enslaved millions of Africans and used 
daily epidemic levels of violence—beat-
ings, whippings, lynchings—to keep 
these people enslaved. From the start, 
we were a nation bathed in violence, 
and we became a little immune, a little 
anesthetized to violence in those early 
days. 
And our decision to build a melting 
pot of ethnicities and races and reli-
gions—it is our genius, right? It is our 
superpower as a nation. It is why we 
catapulted the rest of the world to eco-
nomic and political dominance, but it 
also set us up as a nation with built-in 
rivalries, with easily defined groupings 
and easily exploited suspicions of those 
who aren’t part of your group. 
This combination—epidemic levels of 
violence in our early days that contin-
ued throughout our history and built- 
in tensions between easily defined 
groups—ensured that America would be 
a place with a higher tolerance for and 
a higher risk of violence. 
OK. That is the end of the history 
lesson, but it is important to set this 
frame because this generation, our gen-
eration of Americans—we inherited 
this history. We can’t do anything 
about that. We were born into and be-
came citizens of a nation with a past— 
a past that does make us a little bit 
more prone to violence than other 
places. 
The question really is simply this: 
What are we going to do? Do we ac-
knowledge this lean toward violence 
and take steps to mitigate it? That, of 
course, would be the commonsense ap-
proach. 
Instead, we have done the opposite. 
Throughout American history, hateful, 
demagogic leaders have found political 
capital to be gained by playing upon 
people’s instinct to fear others who 
aren’t part of their group—again, so 
easy in a multicultural America. From 
Orval Faubus to Richard Nixon, to 
Donald Trump, there is an ugly tradi-
tion in American politics of leaders 
trying to drum up irrational fears of 
Blacks or immigrants or Muslims, gay 
people or Hispanics or Jews. Racism, 
xenophobia, homophobia—they have all 
been tools of leaders who seek to build 
followings by convincing people to or-
ganize around their fear or hatred of 
others. 
The Buffalo shooter’s manifesto is a 
tribute to this tradition, but he is not 
alone. The FBI’s latest hate crimes re-
port shows a dramatic spike in this 
country in crimes of bigotry and rac-
ism. Most alarming was a 40-percent 
increase in 2020 in hate crimes against 
Black Americans, foreshadowing the 
Buffalo attack. 
And this shouldn’t come as a surprise 
to anyone. The most visible political 
figure in America—Donald Trump—has 
spent 
the 
last 
decade 
relentlessly 
spreading the gospel of fear and anx-
iety and hate. His campaign rollout in 
2015 was centered around hyping the 
threat to America from Mexican immi-
grants. His most significant campaign 
policy proposal was to ban all people 
from the country who practice a cer-
tain religion. 
There is a straight line from this em-
brace of racism and fear to the increase 
in violence in this country. I know 
many of my Republican colleagues 
don’t use the same terminology, the 
same language that Trump does, but 
they know the danger he poses to this 
Nation. They know that his movement 
is egging on violence, and they do 
nothing about it. They still accept him 
as the leader of the party, when they 
had a chance to get rid of him after 
January 6. Republicans go to Florida 
to kiss the ring. They appear on FOX 
shows that spread this message. They 
empower the message. 
Knowing America’s natural predi-
lection toward violence, Republicans 
could have chosen to embrace leaders 
who seek to unite us, who would choose 
to push back against this tendency for 
Americans to be wary of each other. In-
stead, they did the opposite, and we are 
paying a price. 
The other way that our Nation could 
have chosen to mitigate our violent in-
stincts is to make sure that when 
American violence does occur, it does 
the least damage possible. This is com-
monly referred to in public health cir-
cles as harm reduction. If you can’t 
completely and totally prevent the 
harm, then make sure that it is glanc-
ing rather than catastrophic. 
Instead, America, once again, has 
adopted the opposite strategy—a strat-
egy of harm maximization. We are, as I 
have told you, a historically violent 
nation. We know this. And instead of 
trying to mitigate for this history, we 
choose to arm our citizenry to the 
teeth with the most dangerous, the 
most lethal weapons imaginable, to 
make sure that when conflict does 
occur, it ends up with as many people 
dying as possible. That is a choice that 
we have made. 
The jumping-off point in the choice 
was in the mid-19th century, when 
Hartford, CT, inventor Samuel Colt 
built the first repeating revolver, al-
lowing Americans to hide an incredibly 
lethal weapon in their coat pocket. All 
of a sudden, drunken street corner ar-
guments, which used to result in a few 
awkward 
punches 
thrown, 
became 
deadly. And nearly every other country 
in the high-income world at this point, 
in the mid-1800s, saw this danger, and 
so they decided to regulate the hand-
gun and the weapons that came after 
to make sure that those arguments 
stayed 
fist 
fights 
rather 
than 
shootouts. 
But America took the other path. We 
let these weapons spread across the Na-
tion. And then, as much more deadly 
guns were developed for the military, 
our Nation decided to go its own way 
again and let citizens own and operate 
these weapons too. 
The result is, of course, a nation that 
is awash in guns, with no comparison— 
no comparison—in the high-income 
word. We have more guns in this coun-
try on our streets than human beings, 
than American citizens. So it is no 
wonder that in this Nation, everyday 
arguments seamlessly turn into gun-
fights, passing suicidal thoughts result 
in lives ended, and hateful racists can 
kill efficiently by the dozens. 
I think about September 14, 2012, all 
the time. That is the day that a gun-
man, armed with an assault weapon 
and 30-round magazines, walked into 
Sandy Hook Elementary School and in 
less than 5 minutes, killed 20 kids and 
6 educators. Think about that. The 
military weapons that this guy was 
able to own legally killed 26 people in 
under 5 minutes. The gun he used was 
so powerful that not a single child who 
was shot survived. Those bullets moved 
so fast, so lethally through their little 
bodies, it just tore them to shreds. 
But on that same day in China, a 
similarly deranged young man entered 
a similarly nondescript school and at-
tacked almost the identical number of 
people, but in that Chinese classroom, 
every single one of those 23 people who 
that man attacked survived. Why? Be-
cause in China the attacker had a 
knife, not a military-grade assault 
weapon. 
Like I said, I wish this weren’t true, 
but our Nation has, from the jump, 
been more violent than other coun-
tries. I can’t, you can’t, none of us can 
erase this history. And I come to the 
floor today to be honest about the 
parts of the American story that lead 
to these high levels of violence that we

can control and the parts that we can’t 
control. It is up to us whether we want 
to spend every hour of every day trying 
to mitigate this predilection toward vi-
olence or whether we want to choose to 
exacerbate it. 
Fueling the kind of racist, hateful, 
fear-your-neighbor demagoguery prac-
ticed by Donald Trump exacerbates 
American violence. Doing nothing year 
after year about the flow of illegal and 
high-powered weapons into our streets 
exacerbates American violence. These 
are choices we are making. 
Kids living in fear that their class-
room is the next one to get shot up, 
that is not inevitable; that is a choice. 
Black shoppers looking over their 
shoulder, wondering whether this is the 
day that they die, that doesn’t have to 
be our reality; that is a choice. 
We can look into the flames of Amer-
ican violence, this fire that has been 
burning since our inception, and we 
can choose to douse the fire or we can 
choose to continue to pour fuel on top 
of it.

(The remarks of Ms. STABENOW per-

are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
yield the floor. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate will consider three 
outstanding nominees to the Federal 
district courts. 
All three nominees are eminently 
qualified for the Federal bench and 
have the character and judicial tem-
perament to serve with distinction. 
The nominees likewise represent im-
portant progress in ensuring that the 
Federal judiciary reflects the nation it 
serves. 
First is Jennifer Rochon, who has 
been nominated to serve on the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern Dis-
trict of New York. 
Today, Ms. Rochon serves as the first 
general counsel of the Girl Scouts of 
the United States of America, a role 
she first assumed in 2013. She provides 
guidance, strategic insight, and legal 
counsel on a wide range of issues, and 
she also advises the Girl Scouts’ board 
of directors on their fiduciary duties. 
Prior to joining the organization, Ms. 
Rochon was a partner at Kramer Levin 
Naftalis & Frankel LLP and a general 
commercial litigator, experience that 
will serve her well on the district 
court. Notably, she was also elected by 
Kramer Levin’s partnership to be the 
first woman to serve on the firm’s ex-
ecutive committee. 
Over the course of her career, Ms. 
Rochon has advocated for gender equal-
ity and the advancement of women in 
the legal profession. She is yet another 
example of President Biden’s commit-
ment to a professionally diverse, excep-
tionally qualified judiciary, and I know 
she will serve the Southern District of 
New York well. 
Ms. Rochon has the strong support of 
her home State Senators, Mr. SCHUMER 
and Mrs. GILLIBRAND, and she was 
unanimously rated ‘‘Well Qualified’’ by 
the American Bar Association. 
Given the depth of her experience and 
her demonstrated prowess in the law, I 
am proud to support Ms. Rochon’s 
nomination, and I encourage my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Our next nominee is Judge Trina 
Thompson. With 14 years as a trial liti-
gator and over 21 years of service to 
the Alameda County Superior Court, 
Judge Thompson is unquestionably 
qualified to serve as a Federal district 
court judge. 
She began her legal career as an as-
sistant public defender at the Alameda 
County Public Defender’s Office, where 
she tried over 35 cases as sole counsel 
over the course of 4 years. She then 
spent 10 years as a criminal defense 
solo practitioner, trying over 30 addi-
tional cases as sole counsel and an-
other eight cases as cocounsel. 
Back in 2000, the Alameda County 
Superior Court Judges appointed Judge 
Thompson to serve as a juvenile court 
commissioner on the Dependency and 
Delinquency Court. Just 2 years later, 
she was elected as an Alameda County 
Superior Court Judge, a role she con-
tinues to hold to this day. 
Throughout her 22 years of judicial 
service, Judge Thompson has presided 
over 150 criminal jury trials, thousands 
of hearings, and hundreds of criminal 
and civil bench trials. 
With her incredible depth of trial ex-
perience on and off the bench, it is no 
surprise that this Bay Area native, who 
earned both her A.B. and her J.D. from 
the University of California at Berke-
ley, has the strong support of her home 
State Senators, Mrs. FEINSTEIN and Mr. 
PADILLA. 
It is also no wonder that the Amer-
ican 
Bar 
Association 
unanimously 
rated Judge Thompson as ‘‘Well Quali-
fied.’’ 
The decades of trial litigation and ju-
dicial experience that Judge Thomas 
has accumulated will be an immense 
asset to the Northern District of Cali-
fornia, which has a number of vacan-
cies that urgently need to be filled by 
qualified judges. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting her confirmation. 
Finally, the Senate will vote on 
Judge Sunshine Sykes, who has been 
nominated to serve on the U.S. District 
Court for the Central District of Cali-
fornia. 
Judge Sykes is an experienced liti-
gator and jurist with a long record of 
unbiased 
decision-making. 
She 
at-
tended Stanford University and Stan-
ford Law School before beginning her 
legal career with a focus on civil litiga-
tion and juvenile dependency cases. 
She served as a staff attorney for Cali-
fornia Indian Legal Services; worked 
for 
the 
juvenile 
defense 
panel 
in 
Murrieta, CA; and served as a deputy 
county counsel in Riverside County. 
In 2013, Sykes was appointed to serve 
as a California Superior Court judge. 
As a member of the Navajo Nation, she 
was the first Native American indi-
vidual to sit on the Riverside Superior 
Court. During her time as a Superior 
Court judge, she has presided over 
more than 90 cases that have gone to 
verdict or judgment and over thou-
sands of additional hearings. 
Judge Sykes has the strong support 
of Senator FEINSTEIN
and Senator 
PADILLA, and she was unanimously 
rated ‘‘Well Qualified’’ by the Amer-
ican Bar Association. If confirmed, she 
will be the first Native American arti-
cle III judge to serve in California. 
Her record on the bench is deeply im-
pressive, and she will continue to ad-
minister justice in a thoughtful, even-
handed manner as a district court 
judge. I will vote to confirm her to the 
Central District of California. I hope 
my colleagues join me in doing the 
same.

JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, for 
many people—not just here in and 
around the Capitol but across the coun-
try—the past few weeks have been a 
wake-up call—a wake-up call to see the 
stakes of our fight for a fair judiciary. 
From abortion rights to free speech 
to gun violence, Federal judges make 
countless decisions that impact our 
daily lives. We have been reminded of 
that in a very significant way. But our 
current Federal bench is not represent-
ative of the diversity of our country 
and our democracy. We have a lot of 
work to do to rebuild the judiciary in a 
way that deserves the faith of the 
American people, to build a judiciary 
that reflects and represents the diverse 
Nation that it serves. 
I know we have talked about it be-
fore. We have been chipping away at it, 
not just through the Judiciary Com-
mittee but through a number of circuit 
court judges and district court judges 
across the country, including in Cali-
fornia. 
I am certainly proud of the signifi-
cant step that we took recently with 
the confirmation of soon-to-be Justice 
Ketanji Brown Jackson. But for all the 
progress we have made this last year, 
we still have a lot of work to do, espe-
cially at the lower court level, where 
almost all Federal cases are heard. 
Many are decided there, and that is it. 
That is why I continue to work close-
ly with the Biden administration to 
recommend and support talented nomi-
nees for California’s district courts— 
nominees who will bring a wide range 
of professional and lived experiences to 
the Federal bench. 
So, today, I rise to highlight three 
outstanding nominees to California’s 
district courts. 
First, the Senate will soon vote on 
the 
confirmation 
of 
Judge 
Trina 
Thompson to become a judge for the 
Northern District of California. 
Judge Thompson has deep roots serv-
ing the community of Alameda County. 
After earning her undergraduate degree 
and her JD from UC Berkeley, she 
began her legal career with the Ala-
meda County Public Defender’s Office; 
and, eventually, she built a successful 
solo practice in criminal defense. 
Over the next decade, she handled 
dozens of criminal trials, and she con-
tinued to work with the county public 
defender’s office to take on pro bono 
clients in the community. A legal 
trailblazer, Judge Thompson became 
the first Black woman to win election 
to serve as a judge in Alameda County. 
She has continuously demonstrated her 
sense of fairness, her commitment to 
justice, and her dedication to the rule 
of law. I know that Judge Thompson 
will continue to pave the road for equal 
justice on the Northern District bench. 
I urge my colleagues to support her 
nomination. 
Second, the Senate will also soon 
vote on Judge Sunshine Sykes’ con-
firmation to become a judge for the 
Central District of California. 
A member of the Coyote Pass Clan of 
the Navajo Nation, Judge Sykes is de-
voted to pursuing justice, especially for 
those who have too often been left be-
hind by the legal system. 
Judge 
Sykes 
earned 
her 
under-
graduate degree and her JD from Stan-
ford University. After law school, she 
chose to begin her legal career working 
for the California Indian Legal Serv-
ices. There, she built a tremendous rep-
utation as a skillful adviser and advo-
cate for Tribes on a wide range of legal 
matters, from addressing domestic vio-
lence to developing Tribal courts and 
preserving cultural resources. She also 
developed an important expertise in ju-
venile dependency cases under the In-
dian Child Welfare Act. 
Recognizing 
Judge 
Sykes’ 
out-
standing work, then Governor Jerry 
Brown appointed her to the California 
Superior Court in 2013. Over the past 9 
years, she has presided over nearly 100 
cases. 
She will bring an impressive legal 
record, work ethic, and an appropriate 
sense of empathy to her judgeship in 
the central district. 
If confirmed, Judge Sykes will also 
be the first Native American to ever 
serve on a Federal court in California. 
I will remind us that California is 
home to more federally recognized Na-
tive American Tribes than any State in 
the Nation. 
I look forward to her distinguished 
service in the central district. 
Finally, I would like to speak for a 
moment, as well, about Judge Sherilyn

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2561 
May 18, 2022 
Peace Garnett, who was confirmed last 
month to serve on the U.S. District 
Court for the Central District of Cali-
fornia. 
Judge Garnett brings an outstanding 
record as a lawyer, as a jurist, and a 
public servant committed to equal jus-
tice. 
Judge Garnett earned her under-
graduate degree from UC Riverside and 
her JD from Harvard Law School. After 
starting her career in private practice, 
Judge Garnett became an assistant 
U.S. attorney for the Central District 
of California. She spent 13 years serv-
ing 
that 
office, 
earning 
numerous 
awards and rising to a number of lead-
ership positions. 
Recognizing 
her 
hard 
work 
and 
record of excellence as a litigator, Gov-
ernor Brown appointed Judge Garnett 
to the Los Angeles Superior Court in 
2014. 
For 8 years, she served with distinc-
tion as a superior court judge and a 
justice pro tem on the California Court 
of Appeal. She now brings this experi-
ence to the Federal bench as a judge 
for the central district. 
Voices like hers—and the voices like 
that of Judge Thompson and Judge 
Sykes—have been left out of the judici-
ary for far too long. All three of these 
nominations of outstanding women, 
women of color, represent important 
progress. So I celebrate each of these 
jurists, and I thank them for their will-
ingness to serve. 
With each of their confirmations, we 
take another important step closer to 
the fair judiciary that this Nation de-
serves, toward the justice system that 
our democracy deserves. 
Mr. President, I am so proud of the 
progress we have made in California. I 
look forward to working with you and 
our colleagues and with the Biden ad-
ministration to continue this impor-
tant work. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor our brave, hard-work-
ing men and women in law enforcement 
as we celebrate their service during Na-
tional Police Week. 
This week, thousands of law enforce-
ment officers and their families will 
visit our Nation’s Capitol to honor 
those who serve and those who have 
made the ultimate sacrifice to keep 
our community safe. 
Over the past year, North Carolina 
has tragically lost three law enforce-
ment officers in the line of duty. This 
doesn’t include the numerous law en-
forcement officers who have also lost 
their lives over the last year due to 
other causes, including some due to 
COVID–19. 
But I would like to take a moment to 
honor the three officers who lost their 
lives 
while 
protecting 
those 
they 
served. 
Last October, we lost Ryan Hayworth 
of the Knightdale Police Department 
after his patrol vehicle was hit by a 
drunk driver. 
Officer Hayworth was only 23 years 
old, and he had already established a 
distinguished record of service. He was 
in the U.S. Army and the National 
Guard. 
He answered the call again by becom-
ing a police officer, following in the 
footsteps of his father, who was a long-
time chief of the Zebulon Police De-
partment, and his brother, who is a 
firefighter. 
Last December, only 2 days before 
Christmas, in my home county of 
Mecklenburg, we grieved the loss of 
CMPD Officer Mia Danielle Figueroa- 
Goodwin. 
Officer Figueroa-Goodwin, only 33, 
tragically was killed when a tractor 
trailer hit her patrol car as she was 
working to keep drivers safe following 
a previous crash. 
Officer Figueroa-Goodwin had served 
CMPD for 6 years. She had a beautiful 
family, survived by her husband and 
three young children, including a four- 
month-old baby. 
In January, we lost North Carolina 
State Trooper John Horton in a tragic 
accident with another patrol vehicle as 
the area was faced with icy and dan-
gerous driving conditions. The accident 
also tragically took the life of another 
driver. 
Trooper Horton had served for 15 
years, and he is survived by his wife 
and 6 children. 
The incredible sacrifice of our brave 
men and women in blue can take many 
forms. Last month, an act of incredible 
bravery by North Carolina State Patrol 
Trooper Cody Thao captivated North 
Carolinians. When a suspected drunk 
driver’s car was barreling the wrong 
way down a highway exit ramp, Troop-
er Thao bravely put himself and his pa-
trol car in the way to stop the driver 
from hurting or possibly killing others. 
Instead of speeding the wrong way on 
the highway, the suspect was stopped 
by Trooper Thao’s split-second decision 
to angle his car and let the car hit his 
patrol car. 
This act was filmed by Trooper 
Thao’s dashboard camera, and his brav-
ery has been broadcast literally to the 
world. 
Trooper Thao’s selfless decision un-
doubtedly saved lives and serves as a 
reminder of the danger our law enforce-
ment community faces each and every 
day to keep us safe. 
I am deeply encouraged by the out-
pouring of support from North Carolina 
communities for our brave, hard-work-
ing law enforcement officers. And I 
should say that I am happy to see the 
same across all States in the Nation. 
But there are some folks who want to 
talk about anti-police policies. I don’t 
think people back home in North Caro-
lina or across the United States are 
buying it. I believe most people back 
home and across this beautiful country 
respect and support law enforcement. 
The 
American 
people 
understand 
that law enforcement officers make our 
communities safer and stronger. They 
understand that proposals to abolish 
and defund the police are out of touch 
with reality. The reality is that rhetor-
ical attacks on law enforcement only 
serve to encourage physical attacks on 
law enforcement. 
FBI Director Chris Wray raised the 
alarm just a few weeks ago when he 
told the American people that ‘‘Vio-
lence against law enforcement in this 
country is one of the biggest phe-
nomenon that I think doesn’t get 
enough attention.’’ I agree with Direc-
tor Wray. 
While attacks on our brave men and 
women in blue may not get enough at-
tention in the national press, our local 
communities recognize the tremendous 
sacrifice given by those who protect 
and serve. 
We must stop the tide of violence 
against law enforcement in this coun-
try. That is why I am proud to have in-
troduced the Protect and Serve Act. 
This commonsense legislation would 
make it a Federal crime to inten-
tionally assault a law enforcement offi-
cer. This bill has also received bipar-
tisan support in the past and, I believe, 
would make a strong statement to 
criminals that assaulting law enforce-
ment is inexcusable. 
With the Protect and Serve Act, 
criminals would be on notice that an 
assault on law enforcement is an as-
sault on all Americans. 
Each year, we take this week to cele-
brate those who serve and protect pub-
lic safety. 
These heroes deserve our gratitude 
24/7, 365. I hope my colleagues will help 
me fight for the men and women in 
blue. They need us more than ever. 
As I often say when I am back in the 
State of North Carolina, if you get an 
opportunity to see a law enforcement 
officer today, thank them for their sac-
rifice.

ator from Iowa. 
ISSUES FACING AMERICA 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, etched in 
marble above the chair you are sitting 
in is the Latin phrase ‘‘E Pluribus 
Unum,’’ meaning ‘‘out of many, one.’’ 
Despite our differences, the union 
among our respective States as a single 
nation expressed by this motto has en-
dured for nearly 250 years. The prin-
ciples of liberty and equality upon 
which our Nation was conceived have 
not only survived but continued to 
flourish and expand from one genera-
tion to the next. 
Many of us who are Members of this 
body would not have been eligible to 
cast a vote, much less serve in Con-
gress, not so long ago. We stand here as 
real, live proof that the American ex-
periment 
in 
self-determination 
has 
been a success unlike any other in his-
tory. This triumph has been made pos-
sible by the institutions established by 
our Founders to serve as guardrails to 
ensure liberty and maintain order 
while preventing tyranny. 
Today more than ever, those institu-
tions are under attack by the intrusion

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2562 
May 18, 2022 
of a woke counterculture that has 
taken over the Democratic Party. They 
condemn America as culpable rather 
than exceptional and embrace social-
ism, a system in which government 
controls everything. 
Under the spell of these radical ele-
ments, the Democrats have unleashed a 
strange multiverse of madness in which 
reality no longer has meaning and the 
foundations upon which our Nation was 
built are being turned upside down and 
inside out or destroyed altogether. 
The left tells us to trust the science 
and to believe all women—yet they 
can’t even define what a woman is— 
and that criminals are victims and the 
law enforcement officers who risk their 
own lives every day to protect us are 
somehow the real perpetrators of injus-
tice. Now they want Washington to be 
the arbiter of truth. That is right, 
folks. The Department of Homeland 
Security, which should be focused on 
securing our borders, is now trying to 
police what the Biden administration 
deems disinformation. It sounds like a 
novel idea, and by that, I mean George 
Orwell’s novel ‘‘1984’’ in which the Min-
istry of Truth pushed state propaganda 
which was the exact opposite of truth. 
This attempt to control what you 
can and cannot say is not only an at-
tack on our First Amendment, which 
guarantees freedom of speech and the 
press, but an assault on truth itself. We 
don’t need anyone in Washington—es-
pecially Joe Biden, who is factually 
challenged himself—telling us how to 
think or what to say. That may be how 
things are run in socialist countries 
like Russia and China but not in Amer-
ica, the land of the free. 
The Senate itself is a prime target of 
this effort to undermine America’s in-
stitutions by silencing opposing views. 
The Democrats are determined to end 
the Senate’s long tradition of unlim-
ited debate that has long guaranteed 
all voices can be heard. Senator SCHU-
MER once said that eliminating the fili-
buster would be ‘‘a doomsday for de-
mocracy.’’ He then ignored his own 
apocalyptic warning by voting to nuke 
the filibuster for executive and judicial 
nominations. In doing so, the Demo-
crats, minus JOE MANCHIN, threw away 
the only leverage the minority party in 
the Senate has to influence Presi-
dential appointments, including life-
long terms on the Court. 
You would think they would have 
learned their lesson about how short-
sighted that decision was, but they 
haven’t. Now Senator SCHUMER is de-
termined to do away with the legisla-
tive filibuster so he can push through 
the Democrats’ radical plan to remake 
America by giving Washington control 
of how voters select their representa-
tives and stacking the Supreme Court 
with liberal Justices who will legislate 
from the Bench rather than interpret 
the law through the lens of the Con-
stitution. 
Democrats have long been working to 
discredit and undermine the independ-
ence and legitimacy of the Supreme 
Court. The Senate majority leader 
himself has publicly issued personal 
threats against specific Justices, warn-
ing that if they do not rule as he de-
sired, they will ‘‘pay the price.’’ 
Earlier this month, for the first time 
ever, a draft opinion of a pending case 
before the Supreme Court was leaked 
to the media. Chief Justice John Rob-
erts called the unprecedented breach of 
the Court’s confidential deliberations a 
‘‘betrayal of the confidences of the 
Court . . . intended to undermine the 
integrity of our operations.’’ 
Following the cues from the majority 
leader, radical activists are harassing 
Supreme Court Justices in an effort to 
intimidate and influence their verdict. 
Folks, this madness has got to end. 
This woke crowd is living in an alter-
nate universe that is devoid of reality 
where our Nation and those who found-
ed it are now the enemy. It is all very 
strange because no serious study of his-
tory can look at the impact made by 
our great Nation, especially in the last 
century, and conclude that the world is 
not considerably better off as a result 
of the American Revolution. 
America led the world to end fascism, 
defeat communism, and counter ter-
rorism. At home, we expanded the 
right to vote and ended segregation. 
And there are countless brave men and 
women from all walks of life who have 
answered the call of our Nation, who 
are stationed around the globe at this 
very moment, ready to sacrifice all to 
defend freedom and stop tyranny. 
Our system of self-government has 
lived up to and surpassed the promise 
of our Founders to form a more perfect 
Union, establish justice, ensure domes-
tic tranquility, provide for the common 
defense, promote the general welfare, 
and secure the blessings of liberty to 
ourselves and our posterity. 
All of this will be lost if we give in to 
the demands of the angry woke mob, 
which seeks to destroy the foundations 
that have long guided us and held us 
together as one Nation, indivisible, 
with liberty and justice for all. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Utah. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the basic 
purpose and function of the U.S. Con-
stitution is to protect the American 
people from the dangerous accumula-
tion of power at the hands of the few. 
You see, that kind of protection is nec-
essary to make us free. In that respect, 
it is the structure of our government, 
set forth in the Constitution, that 
truly makes us free. It is the bulwark 
against what would rob us of our free-
dom. 
The Framers spent those hot summer 
days of 1787 in Philadelphia principally 
debating the structure and role of the 
Federal Government. Through the cen-
turies of this great American experi-
ment, it has been the structure of our 
government, not simply the Bill of 
Rights or other substantive provi-
sions—it has been the structure that 
has been the most effective protection 
from waves of oppression and the 
whims of dictatorship. 
Tragically, under the auspices of 
CRT, unrestrained progressivism, and a 
false sense of national destiny, the 
modern left has embarked on a cam-
paign of sorts to condemn the Found-
ers, to tarnish the Constitution itself, 
and deface the structure and institu-
tions that protect our liberty. Progres-
sives 
have 
been 
astoundingly, 
shockingly, effective. 
Unfortunately, this effort to seize 
power to enact a radical agenda, no 
matter the cost, is not a new tactic of 
the 
Democratic 
Party. 
President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt engaged in an 
institution-shaking campaign to pres-
sure the Supreme Court to consent to 
and accept with constitutional infir-
mities his radical New Deal agenda. 
He wanted to pack the Supreme 
Court by increasing the number of Jus-
tices to appoint his own political loyal-
ists who would then do his bidding. His 
threats to the structural Constitution 
of the United States led to the infa-
mous ‘‘switch in time that saved nine.’’ 
Now, Roosevelt’s plan to pack the 
Supreme Court failed as a legislative 
matter. When it got to this body, when 
it reached the Senate floor, it didn’t go 
anywhere, but it left a lasting mark, 
and it has not been a favorable one. 
Legal scholars, historians, politi-
cians, and people of every stripe and 
political persuasion have since then 
condemned this. For example, this 
Court-packing 
campaign 
has 
been 
called a ‘‘bad idea’’ just in the last few 
years by the late Justice Ruth Bader- 
Ginsburg. It was likewise called ‘‘a 
bonehead idea’’ by then-Senator Joe 
Biden. And yet today many Democrats 
are returning to that rejected notion 
and, like a dog to its vomit, going back 
to a bad idea that was bad then and re-
mains bad now. 
The Supreme Court has consisted of 
nine Justices since 1869, over 150 years. 
It is a settled number that most Amer-
icans agree should stay. Not one person 
has argued that we need to increase the 
number of Justices because of a human 
resources problem or a workforce prob-
lem. No, it is not that; it is rather that 
they want to influence the outcome of 
decisions. They want to politicize the 
Court. 
Tragically, the independence of the 
judiciary is thus being threatened, and 
it is being threatened, I would add, on 
several fronts. You have got misguided 
groups like Ruth Sent Us, along with 
others, that have attempted to pres-
sure conservative Justices by pro-
testing at those Justices’ homes and 
places of worship. 
When you show up to someone’s 
home, the home of a public official, es-
pecially if that person is a judge or 
Justice, it is unlawful; 18 U.S.C. sec-
tion 1507 plainly prohibits that because 
you are trying to influence them. You 
can’t do that. It is unlawful. In fact, 
that is a Federal felony, a serious one 
in fact.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2563 
May 18, 2022 
It is a serious offense because when 
you show up at the home of a public of-
ficial like that, regardless of whatever 
else you might say or what the signs 
you are carrying might have printed on 
them, the lasting message, whether 
these words are spoken or not, is, ‘‘We 
know where you sleep.’’ That is an im-
plicit threat of physical violence. 
On other fronts, you have got certain 
Members of Congress, including some 
Members of this body, who are willing 
to place the Court’s independence at 
risk. You have got some Members of 
this body, including the senior Senator 
from Massachusetts, who went out and 
screamed with some of the same pro-
testers in front of the Supreme Court 
and has written an op-ed for a local 
paper stating her intent and her desire 
to pack the Supreme Court, while pio-
neering 
the 
hashtag 
‘‘ExpandTheCourt.’’ I would venture 
that the Court is much more popular 
nationally than is her agenda. 
But popular acclaim and the support 
of the constitutional structure of the 
United States is, of course, not the 
goal of the modern left. Their goal is 
power. Fittingly enough, the ambition 
of individuals is precisely what the 
Constitution is designed to restrain. 
It is working as intended. James 
Madison wrote of the Constitution in 
Federalist 51: 
If men were angels, no government would 
be necessary. If angels were to govern men, 
neither external nor internal controls on 
government would be necessary. In framing a 
government which is to be administered by 
men over men, the great difficulty lies in 
this: you must first enable the government 
to control the governed; and [then] in the 
next place, oblige it to control itself. 
I pray that my colleagues supporting 
this dangerous effort will exercise the 
self-control of our constitutional form 
that our constitutional form of govern-
ment requires. We have all sworn an 
oath to that, and that oath requires us 
to take into account the form and the 
role that it plays in protecting our 
freedom. 
The current efforts to undermine and 
delegitimize 
the 
Court 
are 
multi-
faceted and have included the unprece-
dented treatment of Republican-nomi-
nated nominees to the Court, including 
the public high-tech condemnation of 
Clarence Thomas and the similarly un-
founded attacks on Brett Kavanaugh, 
on Sam Alito, and on other Republican 
nominees to the Court; Senator SCHU-
MER’s very public attempt to intimi-
date the Court by standing in front of 
the Supreme Court Building during 
oral arguments in a Louisiana abortion 
case, June Medical, shouting: ‘‘I want 
to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell you 
Kavanaugh, you have released the 
whirlwind and you will pay the price. 
You won’t know what hit you if you go 
forward with these awful decisions.’’ 
The Constitution is a structure. It is 
a process and an organization. When 
Democrats threaten another branch of 
government for political ends, they 
threaten that structure itself. It is 
dangerous. It is wrong. And I pray for 
the sake of our Nation that it never 
succeeds. 
To that end, every Member of this 
body should be condemning these ef-
forts and condemning the efforts of 
those described in the Axios article 
that ran today explaining that the De-
partment of Homeland Security is now 
having to investigate serious credible 
threats of people wanting to burn down 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States, people wanting to assassinate 
Supreme Court Justices and law clerks. 
We must all condemn them. And I 
hereby do so in the strongest terms I 
am capable of communicating. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, in late 
2016, soon after the Presidential elec-
tion of that year, there was a signifi-
cant portion of the political left that 
began referring to itself as ‘‘the resist-
ance.’’ 
Apparently, these people were bent 
on fighting whatever the new President 
might try to do, only because of who 
the new President was. There were 
signs in yards. There were people who 
painted their garage door with ‘‘the re-
sistance’’ on the garage door. 
They weren’t arguing against specific 
policies; they weren’t making a ration-
al effort to win support for their side; 
they were just trying to throw sand in 
the gears of the executive branch and 
interfere with how the government 
serves the people. One Senator on the 
floor of the Senate said: ‘‘The resist-
ance starts here.’’ 
Now, they did it while trying to 
cloak themselves in maybe the compel-
ling language of ‘‘the resistance,’’as if 
in their minds they were starring in 
the World War II movie ‘‘Casablanca,’’ 
where the resistance was the heroes as 
they were all over World War II. 
The damage ‘‘the resistance’’ was 
willing to do to the executive branch of 
our government was bad enough. On 
the floor of the Senate, at virtually 
every nominee the President nomi-
nated, the minority insisted on 30 
hours of debate. We finally had to 
change that rule to 2 hours of debate, 
which those in the majority now know 
is a big enough challenge without 30 
hours of debate. And I think the aver-
age time used was closer to 20 minutes, 
during that 30 hours, than 30 hours. 
But 30 hours still had to be set aside. 
No other business could occur. People 
were nominated early on for Ambas-
sadors to countries, for instance, that 
they eventually got to serve 1 year in 
because that ‘‘resistance’’ element ap-
peared right here as well. 
Then the group of political activists 
began to insist that we degrade the leg-
islative branch as well, trying to 
change the Senate to get rid of the mo-
tion to proceed. And, frankly, ever 
since Democrats got control of the 
Senate, by the smallest margin pos-
sible, there has been a constant discus-
sion of why we should change that rule. 
Of course, many of us understand the 
so-called filibuster rule is what makes 
the Senate. President Biden said, when 
he was a Senator: 
[A]t its core, the filibuster is not about 
stopping a nominee or a bill, it is about com-
promise and moderation. 
End the quote that he made at the 
time that I agree with now. 
Many of the people who have been 
calling to end the filibuster changed 
their tune, not because something 
changed in America but because they 
are now in charge. And without the fil-
ibuster, we would see wild swings in 
policy when different parties would 
take control of the majority of the 
Senate, and we see that constantly in 
the House now. A lot of bills pass, and 
very few of them get to the President’s 
desk. When the other party gets in con-
trol, they pass bills that reverse what 
the earlier majority passes, and, frank-
ly, very few of them get to the Presi-
dent’s desk either because the Senate 
has to take a little more time to think 
about what direction the country real-
ly wants to go in. 
In the last 20 years or so, complete 
control has happened four times, alter-
nating between Democrats and Repub-
licans. That is a lot of time for the pen-
dulum to swing and the potential for 
bad ideas to become law without some-
thing to make us think about that be-
fore we head in that direction. 
At a time of razor-thin margins in 
the House and Senate, activists should 
be extra careful about getting rid of in-
stitutional guardrails. Their efforts 
have failed so far because there aren’t 
enough Senators from both parties who 
are willing to make that change, but 
that doesn’t mean they won’t keep try-
ing. 
In fact, I am confident we will con-
tinue to hear that, and I am also con-
fident their position will change as 
soon as they are in the minority and 
don’t get what they want. 
This brings us to the disappointing 
effort we have seen to damage the third 
branch of government: the judiciary. 
For more than a year, we have seen 
some people on the left try to apply po-
litical pressure on the Court to rule in 
a particular way. 
The Senator from Utah just gave us 
an example of that. I am going to re-
peat it. It is probably worth repeating. 
In March of 2020, the Democratic leader 
of the Senate spoke to a crowd in front 
of the Supreme Court Building, and he 
said: 
I want to tell you Gorsuch, I want to tell 
you Kavanaugh, you have released the whirl-
wind and you will pay the price. 
Now, what would that possibly mean? 
If you are in the Supreme Court you 
have got a lifetime job, so the price 
clearly was not losing your job. What 
price was the Democratic leader sug-
gesting and saying on the steps of the 
Supreme Court you would have to pay? 
And this is while the Court was inside 
hearing arguments on the case. 
And the Leader added: 
You won’t know what hit you if you go for-
ward with these awful decisions. 
That kind of language has no place 
and really no legitimate purpose.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2564 
May 18, 2022 
This is not the kind of language that 
we need to use. 
Our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle have talked about introduced 
legislation to add new Justices to the 
Court to pack the Court. 
Judges should rule based on the law, 
not on their partisan allegiance. That 
is not a new idea, but countries rarely 
manage to put it into practice. 
The American judicial system be-
came the envy of the world precisely 
because of its independence. Renowned 
historian of the American Revolution 
Gordon Wood has described it as the 
creation of judges who are ‘‘agents of 
the sovereign people somehow equal in 
authority with the legislators and ex-
ecutives.’’ 
An independent judiciary is a critical 
element of the unique balance of power 
the Constitution created. Justices have 
frequently ruled against Presidents and 
parties that put them on the Court. 
Some of the most prominent, politi-
cally sensitive Supreme Court cases in 
history have involved Justices ruling 
against the parties that put them in 
power, 
including 
United 
States 
v. 
Nixon in 1974. And Harry Truman, who 
put his name on the desk that I am 
speaking from, would certainly have 
preferred not to lose the so-called steel 
seizure case of Youngstown Sheet and 
Tube v. Sawyer, but he accepted it 
without threatening any of the Jus-
tices, without plotting to increase the 
size of the Court, even though the vote 
against it by, for instance, Fred Vin-
son, the Chief Justice who had been his 
Secretary of the Treasury and life-
long—in terms of Senate service— 
friend and his nominee to be the Chief 
Justice, voted the other way. 
The supporters of these changes are 
calling very loudly, but, just like the 
damage that they sought with their re-
sistance of the executive branch, their 
efforts to break the Senate, they could 
do lasting, even permanent damage to 
the judiciary. Once the Court has been 
clearly politicized, it would be hard to 
ever bring it back. 
I am concerned about the anti-insti-
tutional fervor we see going on today. 
I hope it does not produce the stated 
results and goals. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous that Senator FISCHER and I 
be permitted to speak for up to 5 min-
utes each before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when 
Democrats blew up the filibuster for 
nominees some 8 years ago, Repub-
licans warned then that they would re-
gret that move when the tables were 
turned. It seemed like such short-term 
thinking on the Democrats’ part, but I 
have said before that progressive ide-
ology has many Democrats convinced 
that they are, so to speak, on the side 
of history in the long run. 
If you believe history is heading only 
in one direction and that direction is 
your way, you don’t worry about the 
pendulum swinging back. That explains 
why they broke from 200 years of prece-
dent to filibuster conservative judges 
nominated by President George W. 
Bush and then expressed shock and 
outrage when their own precedent was 
used against them under President 
Obama. That ideology also explains 
why Democrats can passionately de-
fend the filibuster one day as a vital 
protection for the minority and then 
just months later, after taking control 
of a 50–50 Senate thanks only to the 
Vice President’s tie-breaking vote, call 
the filibuster racist. 
The phrase ‘‘demography is destiny’’ 
as applied to politics today is another 
version of progressive ideology. The as-
sumption with ‘‘demography is des-
tiny’’ is that ethnic minorities who 
tend to vote Democrat are bound to 
vote that way forever, so they support 
an open-border policy, with a push for 
amnesty, even if it green-lights human 
trafficking and lets the lethal fentanyl 
pour into the bloodstreams of young 
Americans, driving down life expect-
ancy in our country. 
Progressive Democrats assume more 
Hispanic citizens means more votes for 
them and then, somehow, a permanent 
majority. 
Let me remind you that Republicans 
thought that, after the elections of 1994 
and 2010, that we would have a perma-
nent majority. It didn’t work out that 
way. Just like the Irish and Italians of 
the late 1800s and early 1900s, Hispanic 
citizens who have assimilated into the 
fabric of our Nation do not vote as a 
bloc. 
So, just maybe, that is why the left 
seems increasingly desperate to stoke 
identity politics and racial division. 
Such 
thinking 
leads 
to 
counter-
productive calls to, as an example, 
defund the police, followed by a des-
perate attempt to do a 180-degree turn 
when crime spikes and the very com-
munities they sought to pander then 
end up suffering. 
Remember how so many prominent 
Democrats felt compelled to defend and 
justify rioters they deemed to be on 
their side? Now Democrats insist not 
just on prosecuting January 6 rioters, 
as we should with all rioters, but on 
weaponizing that horrible day for polit-
ical purposes. 
They 
decry 
disinformation. 
They 
decry conspiracy theories on the right 
about the election while perpetuating 
conspiracy theories on the left. Re-
member the absurd claim that because 
the 
Postmaster 
General 
supported 
President 
Trump, 
absentee 
ballots 
wouldn’t be delivered in the 2020 elec-
tion? It caused a lot of unnecessary 
worry for many Iowans who vote ab-
sentee. 
Democrats call for supporting our 
elections while at the same time tout-
ing false claims of systemic voter sup-
pression, deeply undermining faith in 
our democracy. 
Democrats do not seem to support 
America’s democratic institutions for 
those 
democratic 
institutions’ 
own 
sake. But if the Democrats are con-
vinced that they are not just right but 
on the right side of history, institu-
tions are only worth preserving so long 
as they can be used to advance their 
own agenda. You cannot have respect-
ful disagreement with someone on the 
wrong side of history. In fact, you de-
monize those people. 
This kind of thinking pits neighbor 
against neighbor and drives wedges 
within our communities. This sense of 
division comes up in every one of my 99 
county meetings in Iowa. I sense 
Iowans are fed up with this poison. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to voice my concern about at-
tempts to undermine American institu-
tions. 
There is a difference between con-
structive efforts to ensure public insti-
tutions are accountable and trying to 
cut down these foundational institu-
tions at their core. 
Recently, our country commemo-
rated National Police Week, and it was 
an opportunity to show our gratitude 
and appreciation to the men and 
women who put their lives on the line 
to keep our people and our commu-
nities safe. Yet we continue to see 
those on the left trying to villainize all 
law enforcement in this country. 
President Biden and Speaker PELOSI, 
scared about their party’s dropping 
poll numbers, can keep trying to muf-
fle their colleagues’ destructive com-
ments, but what the Democrats have 
already said has harmed our Nation’s 
law enforcement. 
We heard ‘‘defund the police’’ from 
many—too many—Democratic elected 
officials. 
During a CNN interview in June 2021, 
a Massachusetts Congresswoman said: 
I support a radical re-imagining of commu-
nity safety and public safety, which means 
reallocating and not further investing in a 
carceral state. 
A New York Congresswoman has 
called for the Federal Government to 
apply pressure to disrupt the system in 
reference to police departments. 
Others have said time and time again 
that we must ‘‘completely re-imagine 
what policing looks like in our coun-
try.’’ 
What affect is this antipolice rhet-
oric having on those who swear to 
serve and protect? Not surprisingly, we 
are seeing a drain on law enforcement 
agencies. Numbers of law enforcement 
officers rose from 2014 to 2020; however, 
over the past 2 years, retirements and 
resignations are climbing while re-
cruitment numbers are down. Many of 
our law enforcement agencies are re-
ceiving far fewer applications. 
This is something that I directly dis-
cussed with Sergeant Tony Conner, the 
president of the Omaha Police Officer’s 
Association, when we met recently. Ap-
plication numbers for some Nebraska 
law enforcement agencies are down 75

May 18, 2022 
percent or more compared to just a few 
years ago. 
Contributing to these challenges, po-
lice officers’ jobs have also become in-
creasingly dangerous. Last year, we 
saw surges in violence and aggression 
towards officers. Three hundred and 
forty-six police officers were shot in 
the line of duty, and 130 of them were 
targeted and shot in ambush-style at-
tacks. In a recent CBS ‘‘60 Minutes’’ 
interview, FBI Director Christopher 
Wray said there had been a 59-percent 
increase in the murders of police offi-
cers, with 73—73—officers killed in 2021. 
That is a rate of about one officer 
killed every 5 days. 
Without 
a 
doubt, 
Democrats’ 
antipolice rhetoric has diminished mo-
rale and eroded public trust in law en-
forcement. Maybe that was the goal. 
But dwindling application numbers 
to join the force also are contributing 
to rising crime all across this country. 
A report by the Council on Criminal 
Justice found that the national violent 
crime rate increased 44 percent from 
2019 to 2021. 
A recent Wall Street Journal edi-
torial discussed efforts to address ris-
ing crime in one of our Nation’s cit-
ies—Seattle. According to the edi-
torial, 
Seattle 
city 
attorney 
Ann 
Davison’s office found that 118 individ-
uals were responsible for more than 
2,400 crimes in Seattle over the past 5 
years. Yet, her efforts to hold repeat 
offenders accountable are being sty-
mied by some. 
Because of a 2019 agreement signed 
by Davison’s predecessor, certain class-
es of misdemeanors in that community 
go to the community court, and this 
court releases the accused after refer-
ring them to certain support services. 
The editorial states: 
Seattle criminals get four tries in the 
Community Court before they flunk out. 
Each can encompass multiple charges. Re-
peat offenders see the lack of consequences 
as an invitation to commit more crimes. 
Davison is currently trying to re-
negotiate 
that 
deeply 
flawed 
2019 
agreement, but despite the rise in 
crime in Seattle, these negotiations 
are at an impasse. 
Problems like these aren’t confined 
to the Emerald City. In L.A., Min-
neapolis, Chicago, Washington, DC, and 
other cities, liberal prosecutors often 
fail to hold violent criminals account-
able. 
The impact on public safety is clear. 
CNN reports the following about the 
increase in carjackings: In New York 
City, the number of carjackings has 
quadrupled in the last 4 years. In Chi-
cago, more than 1,800 carjackings were 
reported in 2021. Here in the Nation’s 
Capitol, Metropolitan Police confirmed 
that carjackings have tripled since 
2019. 
The administration’s efforts to ad-
dress the rise in this violent crime are 
weak. I am supporting a resolution led 
by the senior Senator from Louisiana 
that actually gets at what we should be 
doing. It demands that the President 
work with Congress on a comprehen-
sive strategy that encourages the De-
partment of Justice, the Department of 
Homeland Security, as well as State 
and local law enforcement officers to 
counter the rise in violent crime by re-

ABORTION 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this is 
a dark, enraging moment for our Na-
tion. I have made that clear already, 
and so have so many of our Democratic 
colleagues. But I am speaking on the 
floor today because we cannot back 
down for a minute. We cannot lose 
sight of the terrifying reality that Re-
publicans want to end the right to 
abortion, and they are within weeks of 
accomplishing that goal. 
Very soon, the Supreme Court is set 
to overturn Roe v. Wade and fulfill Re-
publicans’ decades-long goal of control-
ling women’s bodies and rolling back 
everyone’s fundamental right to decide 
whether or not to start a family. 
Let me say that again because it is 
shocking, and it is true. In a matter of 
weeks, women across the country will 
lose a constitutional right they have 
had for half a century. The steady 
march 
forward 
to 
secure 
women’s 
rights 
that 
generations 
before 
us 
fought for will be reversed, and my 
daughter and granddaughters will have 
fewer rights than I did. 
Women will be forced to carry preg-
nancies to term when it is not right for 
them, and Republicans will be respon-
sible. This is the future that they have 
been fighting for. This is the America 
that they want, and they are not done 
yet. 
Republicans are hell-bent on rolling 
back 
the 
clock. 
Last 
week, 
they 
blocked our bill to protect Roe and the 
right to abortion, but they are not 
going to stop at overturning Roe and 
shredding patients’ rights to make de-
cisions about their own bodies. In 
States across the country, Republican 
lawmakers are banning abortion with-
out exceptions. They are targeting peo-
ple who help a women get an abortion, 
doctors who are providing essential 
healthcare, friends and family mem-
bers who are just supporting a loved 
one, and even the drivers just doing 
their job and helping patients get to 
medical appointments. 
Republicans are working around-the- 
clock to make it harder for women and 
families to control their own futures. 
They are coming after the birth con-
trol and IUDs that tens of millions rely 
on to plan a family on their own terms. 
They are coming after Plan B. They 
are even putting patients’ ability to 
get the IVF care they need to help 
start a family at risk. 
My Republican colleagues right here 
in the Senate have made clear that 
they have their sights set on some-
thing really extreme: They want a na-
tionwide ban on abortion. Republicans 
aren’t content with some States ban-
ning abortion and creating health cri-
ses that spill across State lines; they 
want to eliminate the right of every 
woman in America to get an abortion 
in Washington State and everywhere 
else. It is not hypothetical, and it is 
not some far-off worry. It is appalling, 
and it is completely backward. 
Republicans want to force us all with 
them into their time machine, but we 
are not going to let them. Democrats 
are fighting Republicans’ increasingly 
extreme policies at every step of the 
way. 
In the coming weeks, we are going to 
remind each and every American of the 
rights that Republicans want to rip 
away. We won’t allow Republicans to 
run and hide from the reality of their 
extreme agenda. We are going to be on 
the floor each week highlighting how 
Republicans are doing everything they 
can to hit rewind on our rights, high-
lighting every protection and freedom 
that Republicans are ripping away 
from people across the country, and we 
are going to show the country how Re-
publican policies hurt everyone. We are 
going to expose the Republicans’ rad-
ical and unpopular views on everything 
from abortion to family planning to 
sex ed. We are going to make clear who 
is hurt most by their extremism. 
This fight did not end when the Re-
publicans blocked the Women’s Health 
Protection Act last week—far from it. 
People across the country are fed up 
with Republicans’ attacks on their 
rights. They are fired up, and they are 
fighting back, and so am I, and so are 
my Democratic colleagues. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4249 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
last week, President Biden tried to 
blame me for the current inflation cri-
sis. In a speech where he couldn’t even 
get my State right—I proudly rep-
resent Florida, in case he needs an-
other reminder—he attacked me and 
tried to blame the record inflation he 
created on Republicans. I guess he has 
also forgotten that he is the President 
and that it is his policies that created 
this mess. And, by the way, Democrats 
are in control of the House and the 
Senate. 
What is clear to the American people 
is that Joe Biden is to blame for the in-
flation that is hurting them more 
every day. Families I talk to in Florida 
are sick and tired of this President’s 
failures. They are sick and tired of see-
ing an incoherent, confused man ram-
ble on in the White House, with no plan 
but to blame everyone else but himself 
for the problems he created. 
Last week, the Biden administration 
reported that the Consumer Price 
Index, our main measure of inflation, 
increased 8.3 percent year-over-year, 
and the latest Producer Price Index, re-
leased just a day later, showed whole-
sale inflation in April increased 11 per-
cent over the year. These price hikes 
hurt real families, and they are im-
pacting every industry. We see it in the 
price of groceries, like milk, eggs, and 
meat. We see it in the price of gas at 
the pump and electricity for your 
home. We see it in the price of used 
cars and in the cost of transportation. 
Everything is going up, and some prod-
ucts, like baby formula, are nearly im-
possible to find. 
It is causing families to make impos-
sible choices. In March, a Census Bu-
reau report found that over the last 
year, 24 percent of Americans reduced 
or went without basic items such as 
food and medicine as a way to afford 
their energy bills. In my home State, 
26 percent of Floridians had to make 
this impossible choice. 
Let’s be clear. The financial pinch 
families are facing, the supply chain 
crisis families are facing, and the sky-
rocketing prices families are seeing are 
because of the radical spending agenda 
being pushed by President Biden and 
Democrats in Washington. Their reck-
less government spending has sent our 
economy into a downward spiral. Our 
debt has grown to over $30 trillion, and 
Biden wants to push it up to $45 trillion 
even as our GDP is contracting. Infla-
tion has risen to the highest levels in 
over 40 years. It is wrecking our econ-
omy. 
We need bold action to fix this mess 
and help families struggling to keep 
up. 
I came to the floor to stop the insan-
ity and introduce a budgetary point of 
order. My bill would stop any non-
defense discretionary spending that 
would increase the deficit over the 10- 
year budget window when the average 
annual CPI inflation is 3 percent or 
higher. The Federal Reserve’s target 
for inflation is 2 percent, so setting the 
bar for the point of order 50 percent 
above this target is totally reasonable. 
My point of order would not even 
apply during time periods when infla-
tion is at or slightly above the Federal 
Reserve’s target. Of course, we need 
flexibility for emergencies, so my bill 
would allow this point of order to be 
waived if two-thirds of the Senate 
agree that deficit spending during 
times of elevated inflation is des-
perately needed. Further, my point of 
order would not apply to funding our 
armed services nor would it apply to 
any mandatory spending, such as Medi-
care or Social Security. 
This 
is 
commonsense 
legislation. 
This bill would put in place the same 
scrutiny that families, especially poor 
families like mine when growing up, 
use in order to stay on budget. It is the 
same kind of careful examination that 
small business owners have to do to 
make sure they can pay their employ-
ees and make ends meet. The inflation 
we 
are 
seeing 
right 
now 
is 
unsustainable. It is time for action. I 
hope we will all come together to agree 
to this point of order. 
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed

to the immediate consideration of S. 
4249, which is at the desk. I further ask 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and that motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in reserv-
ing the right to object, if the Senator 
from Florida’s bill were to pass, it 
would make routine domestic spending 
bills nearly impossible to be passed in 
the U.S. Senate, freezing spending at 
current levels. 
I worry that the Senator from Flor-
ida believes the false impression that 
inflation does not impact the millions 
of Americans who benefit from non-
defense discretionary programs. These 
are people who have to go to work 
every single day and try to figure out if 
they are going to have enough money 
to put groceries on their table. This 
bill would make things worse for the 
American people, not better. 
As an example, this year, the cost of 
the veterans medical care system is ex-
pected to grow by $21 billion. We have 
all heard the patriotic speeches of how 
we stand behind our veterans when 
they answer the call, but I wonder how 
many VA hospitals and clinics in Flor-
ida would have to be closed if this pro-
posal were to be approved. I know there 
are a lot all over the country that 
would have to be closed. 
Natural gas costs have grown by 35 
percent this year. Do any of us who 
may be from a State where the weather 
can get warm want to tell our constitu-
ents who rely on the LIHEAP program 
to cool their homes ‘‘No, you don’t 
need 
air 
conditioning 
because 
the 
money is not going to be there’’? 
If Florida is struck by another hurri-
cane this summer and the Senator 
from Florida’s constituents look to 
FEMA for fuel, food, and water, will 
the 
Senator 
tell 
his 
constituents 
‘‘Sorry. Inflation was too high. You are 
on your own. We can’t respond to that 
emergency’’? 
In 2017, Members on the other side of 
the aisle lined up to vote for a $1.9 tril-
lion tax cut for the wealthy—a tax cut 
that I believe has contributed to the 
inflation we now see in the country. 
There is nothing in this request to roll 
back those tax cuts. So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4250 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I disagree with my colleague’s objec-
tion, but I think this issue is too im-
portant not to try to get something 
done today. 
So, instead of enacting this point of 
order when the CPI reaches 3 percent, 
how about we raise it to 8 percent? Our 
current CPI level is at 8.3 percent. We 
see how bad things are right now. When 
the CPI gets close to where we cur-
rently are—inflation levels that we 
haven’t seen since the 1980s—that is 
when this point of order would take ef-
fect. 
At 8 percent inflation, we have 
reached a crisis point. It only stands to 
reason for Congress to start looking 
closely at every bill that increases the 
deficit. Such deficit-increasing bills 
should only be passed by Congress 
when absolutely needed. 
Again, this point of order could be 
waived in the Senate with a two-thirds 
majority. I think this is reasonable and 
that we owe it to American families to 
start holding Congress accountable for 
the reckless spending that we know 
fuels inflation. Hopefully, my col-
leagues can agree to pinning this point 
of order to inflation at 8 percent. 
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of S. 
4250, which is at the desk. I further ask 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. LEAHY. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4251 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I was hoping we could arrive at a deal 
today, so let me try it one more time. 
Eight percent inflation, I think, is 
really high. Remember that the Fed-
eral Reserve’s target is 2 percent. I am 
just here to see if we can work some-
thing out and get something with 
which we can control excess spending. 
So I am going to try one more time. I 
want to give Democrats a chance in 
Congress to step up and fight for fami-
lies all across America who are being 
devastated by raging inflation. There is 
no reason not to get this done. 
My colleague objected to setting this 
point of order at 8 percent, but cer-
tainly no one can object to saying that, 
at 12 percent inflation, things need to 
change. Inflation over 12 percent would 
be an even bigger emergency. We 
haven’t seen the CPI that high since 
Jimmy Carter. 
Think about it this way: Things are 
really bad now, and 12 percent inflation 
would be a 50-percent increase over the 
already sky-high prices we are seeing 
today. Remember, we started at 3 per-
cent. Now I am offering my colleague a 
point of order that can only be trig-
gered at 12 percent. 
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of S. 
4251, which is at the desk. I further ask 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in reserv-
ing the right to object—and I will—I 
think back over the years to some of 
the debates. 
I remember, during the Reagan ad-
ministration, when we heard so many 
speeches from President Reagan and 
his supporters on how they had to bal-
ance the budget. He did this at a time 
when he doubled and tripled the na-
tional debt, all the time telling every-
body how they were balancing the 
budget. 
Then I heard the objections to Presi-
dent Clinton’s budget, saying that it 
didn’t do the wonderful things that the 
Reagan budget did even though, of 
course, it gave the United States the 
first surplus it had had in decades. 
Every so often, reality catches up 
with rhetoric, and because of that, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I am clearly disappointed that we have 
had three opportunities to try to do 
something here that was going to try 
to stop the reckless spending that is 
causing this inflation. 
I think all of us know that inflation 
is way too high. We also all know that 
reckless government spending is driv-
ing up the cost of inflation all across 
this country. I hope the Democrats in 
Washington will start figuring out how 
we can get inflation under control. It 
starts by living within our means. It 
starts by making sure that we live 
within our budget and that we stop 
wasting money. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of 
the ways you try to save money is, 
again, not with rhetoric but with re-
ality. 
I would urge everybody to join with 
us on both sides of the aisle who are 
working to get our appropriations bills 
together so we can reflect the actual 
needs and go forward with that. Again, 
rhetoric is easy; reality is a tad more 
difficult. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INDO-PACIFIC REGION 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, with 
the President of the United States soon 
to be departing on his first Asia trip, I 
rise to speak today about U.S. policy in 
the Indo-Pacific, an area of the world 
that I know very well, having served as 
U.S. Ambassador to Japan prior to 
joining the U.S. Senate. 
While U.S. foreign policy in recent 
months has focused largely on Eastern 
Europe, we cannot take our attention 
away from our Nation’s greatest stra-
tegic adversary, namely, the Chinese 
Communist Party. Confronting com-
munist China is the essential responsi-
bility of our time, as the China chal-
lenge—and how the United States and

our allies respond to it—will determine 
whether freedom or autocracy defines 
the 21st century. That is why I am 
pleased to see President Joe Biden in-
vesting the time and energy to travel 
to South Korea and to Japan this 
weekend. 
I can tell you just how critical I be-
lieve this trip is because I made a trip 
similar to this just last month. In 
April, I led the first congressional dele-
gation to visit Japan since the pan-
demic began. I was joined by my col-
leagues Senator BEN CARDIN of Mary-
land and Senator JOHN
CORNYN
of 
Texas. 
During our 6 days in Japan, our bi-
partisan delegation met with the coun-
try’s top leaders, including the Prime 
Minister, his Cabinet members, Parlia-
mentarians, and top leaders from Japa-
nese industry. I think it is fair to say 
that our delegation returned with a 
great sense of optimism—optimism 
about the opportunities that lie before 
our two nations to increase our co-
operation diplomatically, militarily, 
economically, and technologically and, 
by so doing, strengthening our alli-
ance. 
While I certainly have policy dis-
agreements with the current adminis-
tration, I am hopeful that this is one 
area in which we can find common 
ground. The fates of our Nation and the 
world depend on it. This challenge, 
quite frankly, is just far too important 
to get wrong. So I am hopeful that 
President Biden will seize upon the op-
portunities presented to him in the 
Indo-Pacific region to confront the 
China challenge head-on and that this 
trip will provide him with a greater 
perspective to do so. 
I am pleased to see this administra-
tion maintain a focus on the Indo-Pa-
cific region, a focus that President 
Trump began and that I personally was 
proud to help lead from my diplomatic 
post in Tokyo. I also applaud President 
Biden for the actions that he has taken 
to engage the Quad at the leader level. 
Much more can be done. 
In terms of strengthening our diplo-
matic cooperation, the United States 
should 
warmly 
welcome 
Japan’s 
proactive leadership in response to re-
cent international crises. Japan is the 
world’s third largest economy and a 
major financial player on the world 
stage. Japan is a member of the G7. 
In 
the 
days 
after 
Russia’s 
unprovoked and unjustified invasion of 
Ukraine, the Government of Japan 
joined by imposing strong, multilateral 
sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war 
machine. 
Japan’s support on sanctions is as 
important as it is necessary. I saw this 
firsthand when, as U.S. Ambassador to 
Japan, I worked with then-Prime Min-
ister Abe and his administration in 
complying fully with U.S. secondary 
sanctions to end Japan’s purchases of 
Iranian oil in 2018. With Japan’s help, 
we dramatically reduced Iran’s revenue 
stream and its ability to fund terror at 
that time. We see Japan’s importance 
today with regard to multilateral sanc-
tions against Russia. 
Going forward, the United States 
must do its utmost to ensure that 
Japan always has a seat at the table on 
major international issues. 
Indeed, I was very pleased to see For-
eign Minister Hayashi become the first 
Japanese Cabinet member to attend a 
NATO ministerial when he traveled to 
Brussels last April. And I am even 
more pleased to learn that Prime Min-
ister Kishida is considering attending 
the NATO Summit in Spain next 
month. 
Here, I see an opportunity for the 
United States to engage further with 
Japan and NATO by exploring new 
ways to expand high-level diplomatic 
interactions and information sharing. 
When I made the suggestion to Sec-
retary of State Antony Blinken during 
a Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
hearing in early May, I was glad to see 
that my suggestion was well received. 
The second opportunity that I see is 
in the area of improving defense and 
deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. The 
United States and Japan must further 
increase coordination on defense plan-
ning and procurement as Japan looks 
to significantly boost its spending on 
defense. 
Japan has already begun the process 
of rewriting its national security strat-
egy and its related national defense 
strategy. At the same time, leaders in 
Tokyo see growing support from the 
Japanese people to roughly double Ja-
pan’s defense spending to 2 percent of 
GDP. 
These developments come at a crit-
ical moment. Xi Jinping and the Chi-
nese Communist Party have their eyes 
set on Taiwan, and they are surely 
learning lessons from Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine. At the same time, North 
Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un con-
tinues to develop nuclear weapons and 
intercontinental ballistic missiles as 
he poses grave and gathering threats to 
the United States and to our allies in 
the region. 
Our nations, therefore, must act with 
great urgency to strengthen defense 
and deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. In 
particular, the United States must en-
courage Japan to use their increased 
spending to field as rapidly as possible 
new defense capabilities that are mo-
bile, lethal, and interoperable. 
Japan must also significantly im-
prove its cyber security capabilities 
and its ability to share intelligence and 
information with its allies. And it is 
critical that the American and Japa-
nese militaries expand joint training 
exercises with one another. 
I have had the honor of witnessing 
firsthand the success of our joint train-
ing exercises, and I encourage our na-
tions to expand this invaluable train-
ing. 
The third area where I see an oppor-
tunity is on energy security, an area in 
which we should be working together. 
This was the message that I heard last 
month in Japan as leaders expressed 
concerns with America’s current en-
ergy policies. 
Several years ago, I worked hard to 
encourage Japan to make significant 
investments in LNG infrastructure to 
allow greater LNG imports from the 
United States in order to strengthen 
our two nations’ energy security and 
our national security. 
I hope President Biden’s visit will un-
derscore the significance of American 
strength as an energy exporter to en-
hance the security of our allies. But all 
members of the Quad must engage in 
the critical topic of energy security. 
India is the world’s biggest democ-
racy and now has an opportunity to de-
crease its energy and military reliance 
on Russia, and Australia is a signifi-
cant energy exporter. 
When Secretary Blinken recently tes-
tified before the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, I pointed out to him 
that the Quad already has high-level 
working groups working on COVID–19 
vaccines, infrastructure, critical and 
emerging technologies, space, cyber se-
curity, and environmental matters. 
But my argument to him was that add-
ing a new working group in the Quad— 
one focused specifically on energy se-
curity—makes strong strategic sense, 
as 
energy 
security 
is 
inextricably 
linked to economic security and to our 
national security. Frankly, it is sur-
prising to me that the Quad hasn’t al-
ready made this issue a primary focus. 
Secretary Blinken appeared to appre-
ciate the suggestion, and I emphati-
cally urge the administration to take 
this idea to heart and dedicate time 
and energy to discussing energy secu-
rity in our Quad strategic grouping. 
The fourth area of opportunity that I 
see is in technology. The United States 
and Japan already cooperate closely in 
this space. That was a point that I 
sought to underscore in many of our 
meetings with Japan’s private sector 
leaders. 
I see growing opportunities for our 
Quad partners to ensure our respective 
technology sectors continue to work 
together and to generate trusted alter-
natives in 5G, artificial intelligence, 
quantum computing, and in other stra-
tegic technologies. 
When I served as U.S. Ambassador to 
Japan, I helped the United States and 
Japanese 
Governments 
coordinate 
closely to counter Huawei and China’s 
other heavily subsidized companies and 
to clear them from the 5G markets of 
our representative economies. This was 
important because Chinese companies 
like Huawei pose grave and growing na-
tional security and espionage risks. 
Our U.S.-Japan strategy prevented 
Huawei and other Chinese Communist 
Party-directed technology firms from 
obtaining the global scale that they 
sought in their effort to dominate 
international markets. 
It also created openings for firms in 
the United States, Japan, and partner 
countries to pursue trusted 5G alter-
natives in supply chains, including 
software-defined networks and ORAN 
technologies.

May 18, 2022 
With each passing year, the tech-
nology competition with China is only 
intensifying. It is, therefore, impera-
tive that the U.S.-Japan alliance and 
the Quad increase coordination and in-
novation in response to technological 
competition. 
The fifth opportunity is in economic 
leadership in the Indo-Pacific. When 
President Biden visits the region, I ex-
pect him to speak more about the Indo- 
Pacific economic framework. It is clear 
that many of our allies and partners in 
the Indo-Pacific are eager to see more 
U.S. economic leadership. 
As a next step, the United States 
should take the Indo-Pacific Economic 
Framework’s data provisions and turn 
them into a stand-alone, sector-specific 
free-trade agreement. 
The executive branch should look 
closely at the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade 
Agreement of 2019 as a good starting 
point. This is the most comprehensive 
and high-standards agreement address-
ing digital trade barriers. 
I was proud to help then-U.S. Trade 
Representative Bob Lighthizer nego-
tiate this and other bilateral agree-
ments with Japan. Our efforts brought 
about a more fair and reciprocal trad-
ing relationship between our two na-
tions, helping not only our economies 
but also our workers. 
The Biden administration has rightly 
maintained 
the 
Trump 
administra-
tion’s tariffs on China as important le-
verage to uphold fair and reciprocal 
trade. This is a critical tool in our ar-
senal, and I hope the current adminis-
tration continues to use it. 
There 
certainly 
are 
other 
areas 
where the administration must hold 
the line against China. The administra-
tion could do more to hold communist 
China accountable for unleashing the 
COVID–19 pandemic upon the world. It 
also needs to press Beijing to stop the 
deadly flow of Chinese-origin fentanyl 
and fentanyl precursors from flowing 
across our southern border and killing 
more than 100,000 Americans a year 
through overdoses. 
And we also know what is at stake 
when it comes to China’s growing mili-
tary threats against Taiwan. The last 
administration set a high standard on 
countering China, and I hope the cur-
rent administration builds on that suc-
cess. 
I believe there is strong bipartisan 
consensus in Congress when it comes to 
the Indo-Pacific and when it comes to 
the rising opportunities that we see be-
fore us to further strengthen the U.S.- 
Japan alliance and the Quad. So I urge 
President Biden to seize these growing 
opportunities that I have outlined 
when he travels to the Indo-Pacific. As 
the only former American Ambassador 
serving in this body and as a member 
of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, I stand ready to work with him 
as he does. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Maryland. 
SMALL BUSINESS COVID RELIEF ACT OF 2022 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
take this time to review with my col-
leagues S. 4008, the Small Business 
COVID Relief Act of 2022—legislation 
that Senator SCHUMER has set up for 
action tomorrow. 
I want to start by saying that this 
bill—and the underlining bill that it 
deals with, the Restaurant Revitaliza-
tion Fund—was a bipartisan product in 
which 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
worked together to help an industry 
that was in desperate need, the res-
taurant industry. It provided relief for 
their revenue losses, and we were proud 
that we were able to get that passed. 
The challenge was that after it was 
enacted, we provided $28 billion for the 
restaurants under the Restaurant Revi-
talization Fund. In reality, that was 
not enough money to cover the de-
mand, and we found that where close to 
100,000 restaurants were able to qualify 
and receive funds under that program, 
170,000 were shut down through no fault 
of their own. 
So we went to work, Democrats and 
Republicans, in an effort to rectify 
that inequity and help an industry that 
was in desperate need. 
We filed legislation in August of last 
year. And I am proud that it was bipar-
tisan, joined by many of my Demo-
cratic colleagues and Republican col-
leagues. I want to single out Senator 
ROGER WICKER, who has been the real 
champion on making sure that we 
worked in a bipartisan manner. We 
were joined on the Republican side by 
Senator MURKOWSKI, Senator ERNST, 
Senator CASSIDY, Senator HYDE-SMITH, 
Senator COLLINS, and Senator BLUNT. 
And others have joined us during the 
process. 
But I want to take you back a little 
bit before we filed that bill in August 
of last year. There was legislation filed 
that would replenish the funds at $60 
billion because we thought $60 billion 
was going to be needed in order to com-
plete the funding. I think Senator 
SINEMA led the effort in filing that leg-
islation. 
The difference between the bill that 
was filed for $60 billion and the bill 
that we are going to be considering to-
morrow is the bill tomorrow is $48 bil-
lion less. We were able to reduce the 
amount of dollars that were needed in 
order to carry this out. Some res-
taurants have closed. We have tight-
ened up the rules. 
And we can not only do that for $12 
billion 
less 
than 
it 
was 
initially 
thought was going to be possible when 
we had bipartisan support last summer, 
but we are now able to expand it to 
other related industries—all of which 
have had bipartisan legislation in this 
body—to provide relief. These are in-
dustries that were shut down as a re-
sult of COVID–19. They had tremendous 
revenue losses and incurred tremen-
dous debt in order to stay in business. 
So we provided in this bill—for the 
same $48 billion, we include help for 
our gyms. We include help for Minor 
League Baseball, professional leagues. 
We provide money for music venues. 
We provide money for border busi-
nesses. We provide money for the bus 
industry. We were able to do all that, 
and we are still less money than the 
original bill that was filed last sum-
mer. 
We did a couple more things in order 
to make sure this was done in a very 
fiscally conservative way. We were able 
to find some offsets. There were no off-
sets in those other bills. We found 
about $5 billion of offsets that we put 
in this bill. 
We did something else that was not 
in the original act. We required the 
SBA to bring in all the applications be-
fore they allocate any money. Now, we 
had them already in the restaurants. 
These are ones that qualified before. 
But in the other areas they will receive 
all the applications, and before they 
issue any checks, they have to make 
sure they have adequate resources. If 
they don’t, there is a pro rata reduc-
tion so there is no further need for us 
to be concerned about replenishing the 
funds. 
All those are improvements that 
were made on the original bipartisan 
legislation that was filed that is more 
considerate of the needs, less costly, 
and more efficient. 
Now, we have other protections that 
are built into this legislation. A res-
taurant cannot double dip. They have 
to subtract the moneys that they re-
ceived under the Paycheck Protection 
Program, either first or second round 
of funds, from what they would other-
wise be qualified to receive. They have 
to have a revenue loss that they can 
document. So there are protections in 
the bill. 
But I want to go to what is the major 
issue why we really need to make sure 
we get this done. Because of the way 
that this was administered, partly as a 
result of a court action, you had two 
restaurants side by side, identical in 
their needs, filing their applications on 
the same day. One was funded; one was 
not. The restaurant that was not fund-
ed, if it is still in business today, it is 
very likely that that restaurant owner 
is taking out loans in order to stay in 
business and is still trying to be com-
petitive to that restaurant that is next 
door. 
It is very possible that restaurant is 
having trouble getting help, as all res-
taurants are having trouble getting 
help, but cannot compete in salary 
with that restaurant that got the help 
and now has to compete and try to get 
workers, even though they didn’t get 
the same financial assistance. So it is a 
matter of basic fairness. 
I want to go one step further. We in 
the Congress tried to prioritize those 
restaurants in underserved commu-
nities and traditionally underserved 
small business owners. We set up a pri-
ority line for them to be able to get 
their help under the Restaurant Revi-
talization Fund. The court blocked

May 18, 2022 
that line, and we now have small busi-
ness owners who are literally discrimi-
nated against because they were vet-
erans or in underserved communities. 
So as a matter of fairness, we really 
need to get this done. The need is 
there. We all know how restaurants are 
operating at less than full capacity 
today. They are still hurting as a re-
sult of COVID–19. This is going back 
and helping them in regard to their 
first year of losses—something we 
should have done a long time ago but 
something that is desperately needed 
to get done. So I just really wanted to 
explain that to our colleagues, why we 
need to get this done. We finally have 
an opportunity. 
Now, what are we going to be doing? 
We are going to be working on the mo-
tion to proceed. Now, this is not un-
precedented. Let me remind my col-
leagues that the original bill that fund-
ed the restaurant fund was emergency 
funding. So it patterned itself after the 
relief we gave to the general small 
business community under the Pay-
check Protection Program, which was 
also emergency funding. 
The original bill, under the Paycheck 
Protection Program, was also under-
estimated by hundreds of billions of 
dollars. And we came back—Democrats 
and Republicans—in a bipartisan way 
and replenished that fund literally 
overnight—hundreds of billions of dol-
lars—as emergency funding without 
offsets. 
And now we are trying to finish what 
we started in regards to the res-
taurants. It should be—no question 
about it—emergency funding; but we 
are, again, trying to be as careful as 
possible, so we have even found some 
offsets in order to make this easier for 
our economy. 
There are some who say they worry 
about what impact it is going to have 
on our economy. I think keeping small 
businesses open is pretty important for 
our economy. But we can tell you the 
Restaurant Association has informed 
us that a large part of these funds are 
going to be used to pay off debt that 
small business restaurants had to take 
out in order to stay afloat. So we are 
going to keep restaurants open. And 
they are going to be able to pay off 
their debt, and they are going to be 
able to add to our community. That is 
what is at stake here, and that is why 
we are so protective of making sure we 
try to get this done. 
Now, this is a motion to proceed. I 
have listened to debate on this floor 
about how we have to have the Senate 
work. This is a bipartisan bill dealing 
with small business on a motion to pro-
ceed that will allow us to have the de-
bate on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I 
don’t understand any of my colleagues 
believing that this is appropriate to fil-
ibuster and not give us the 60 votes we 
need on a motion to proceed. There are 
a lot of my colleagues who are always 
talking about reforming the rules in 
this place. OK. I understand, when we 
are getting to an emotional issue, it 
gets difficult for us to work together; 
but if we can’t work together on a 
small business bill that was developed 
by 
bipartisan 
Members—Democrats 
and Republicans—that is consistent 
with what we have been doing in help-
ing small businesses generally, and we 
now have an opportunity to bring it to 
the floor for a debate—it will be open 
to amendment. Those who say: Well, 
gee, are there other ways we can make 
this more affordable? Well, come for-
ward. 
We have been working on this for a 
year—close to a year. And, yes, that is 
why we have gotten good suggestions 
from Democrats and Republicans in 
order to try to make this work. But if 
you don’t allow us to debate the bill on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate, I really 
don’t understand that. If you profess 
that you want to see this place work 
and there is not a philosophical prob-
lem here of helping small businesses, 
why can’t we move forward? 
I don’t even know why we need a clo-
ture motion. We should be able to pass 
a motion to proceed on this bill and 
have a debate and go to amendments. 
And Senator WICKER and I have made 
it clear that we will act as traffic cops; 
we will try to figure out the best way 
to consider this bill in order to make it 
work for all. 
Madam President, small businesses 
have a special way of filling our cities 
and towns that make them irreplace-
able when they are gone. I think we all 
recognize that. They drive our local 
economies. They give our neighborhood 
character. They make us proud of 
where we come from and where we live. 
If we allow them to disappear through 
inaction, they will leave holes in our 
community that we cannot easily fill. 
If we cannot pass one last round of 
aid, it will mean certain restaurant 
owners who have pending loans are 
going to close their doors forever. 
Those holes will exist in our commu-
nity, and we will not be able to fill 
them. 
I ask my colleagues—all of us under-
stand the importance of small business. 
We understand they are the growth en-
gines in our community and innovation 
engines in our community. We made a 
commitment to help them through 
COVID–19, and we have honored a large 
part of that commitment. This is the 
last chapter to complete that commit-
ment, and I hope my colleagues will 
join us in allowing us to have this de-
bate on the floor and support the help 
for our small businesses that are in 
desperate need. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise 
today to lay out exactly why I intend 
to vote for the aid package to provide 
our Ukrainian allies with the weapons 
and support they need to fight Vladi-
mir Putin’s invasion. 
First, it is important to understand 
why—thanks in large part to President 
Joe Biden—we are in this dangerous 
situation to begin with. What is mad-
dening 
about 
Russia’s 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine is that it was utterly prevent-
able. This did not have to happen, and 
it was caused by two specific mistakes 
by Biden and his administration. The 
first mistake was Biden’s catastrophic 
surrender and withdrawal in Afghani-
stan. The second mistake was Biden’s 
weakness and appeasement on display 
and his capitulation to Putin on the 
Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. 
Putin didn’t just wake up yesterday 
and 
decide 
he 
wanted 
to 
invade 
Ukraine. In 2014, Putin previously in-
vaded Ukraine, but he stopped short of 
invading the entirety of the country. 
Why is that? The reason is simple: Rus-
sia’s principal source of revenue is oil 
and gas, which is transported via pipe-
lines that go directly through Ukraine. 
Putin knew that when the Nord Stream 
2 Pipeline was complete, he could in-
vade Ukraine and not have to worry 
about potentially destroying Ukrainian 
energy infrastructure because he would 
have in place an alternative pipeline to 
get his gas to market. 
Last spring, President Biden for-
mally waived the sanctions that Con-
gress had put in place on Nord Stream 
2, sanctions that I authored, bipartisan 
sanctions that passed this body twice 
and that President Trump signed into 
law twice. Last summer, President 
Biden surrendered to Putin, lifted the 
sanctions, allowed Putin to build the 
pipeline, and announced a deal with 
Germany to allow the pipeline to be 
completed. When he announced that 
deal, that capitulation, the govern-
ments of both Ukraine and Poland put 
out a joint statement saying: Mr. 
President, if you do this, Vladimir 
Putin will invade Ukraine. 
In August, Biden surrendered in Af-
ghanistan. In September, Nord Stream 
2 was physically completed, and then 
Putin began building up his forces on 
Ukraine’s 
border. 
Even 
then, 
our 
Ukrainian allies pleaded with us: Sanc-
tion Nord Stream 2 now so that Putin 
will know he can’t turn it on later. The 
President, the Prime Minister, Par-
liament, and civil society of Ukraine 
all said so again and again and again. 
I authored a new set of sanctions 
mandating immediate sanctions, which 
the Ukrainian Government formally 
called on the Senate to take it up and 
pass it. The Biden administration 
fought tooth and nail against those 
sanctions in January. I remember 
standing right here and saying: Mr. 
President, if you do this, we will see 
Russian 
tanks 
rolling 
toward 
the 
streets of Kyiv. 
Sadly, 
44 
Democrats 
voted 
with 
President Biden against sanctions on 
Russia, against sanctions on Putin; and 
the appeasement from the White House 
and 44 Democrats led, within days, to 
the invasion of Ukraine. 
That being said now, the difficult 
question is what should we do now that 
this war is unfolding and, specifically, 
whether it is in America’s vital na-
tional security interests for Ukraine to

May 18, 2022 
fight and defeat Putin’s invasion. My 
conclusion is that, yes, it is. 
There is no doubt, $40 billion is a 
large number; and although much of 
that spending is important—in fact, 
some of it is acutely needed in the 
military conflict—I would have pre-
ferred a significantly smaller and more 
focused bill. But our Ukrainian allies 
right now are winning significant vic-
tories with the weapons and training 
that we provided them already, and it 
is in our national interest for them to 
keep doing so. They will not be able to 
fight Putin and have any chance of pre-
vailing if we cut off military assist-
ance. 
So why is this in America’s national 
security interest? The answer lies in 
some questions that my fellow Ameri-
cans are rightly asking. They are ask-
ing: What would Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine mean for our problems here at 
home, including, for example, food and 
energy? They are asking: Is the cost of 
this bill really necessary? They are 
also asking: Isn’t China our biggest 
long-term enemy? 
These are all entirely legitimate 
questions. They are important to ask. 
They are the same questions I asked 
myself before deciding how to vote on 
this bill. Another question Americans 
are rightly asking is: Why aren’t we 
doing anything about our problems 
here at home? 
I emphatically agree that President 
Biden and congressional Democrats 
have failed on the issues here at home 
that Texans and Americans rightly 
care about and we should fix. Right 
now, we have a raging border crisis 
that President Biden won’t do a damn 
thing about. We have skyrocketing in-
flation. We have gas prices at record 
highs. We have a baby formula short-
age that has left parents all over the 
country scrambling to try to feed their 
babies. These are real problems that 
the Democrats caused and now refuse 
to even try to fix; and in multiple in-
stances, such as the gas prices, these 
are problems that Democrats have de-
liberately made worse, inflicting pain 
on millions of Americans. 
All of that can be true at home, and 
it doesn’t mean the world has suddenly 
become safe and that our enemies do 
not mean us harm. At the same time 
that we need to secure our border and 
address the domestic crises, we also 
need to stand up and confront the very 
real threat posed by Russia and by 
China. We can’t let the fact that Biden 
and the Democrats have created mas-
sive domestic and economic failures 
cause us to ignore threats to U.S. na-
tional 
security 
posed 
directly 
by 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. 
On the question ‘‘Why is what Russia 
does in Ukraine relevant for our na-
tional security,’’ I want to answer this 
by making four points. 
No. 1, what Putin is trying to do is to 
reassemble the Soviet Union and, be-
yond the Soviet Union, the Russian 
Empire from even earlier. If Putin suc-
ceeds in doing so, it would be disas-
trous for global stability and for Amer-
ican security. 
The Cold War between America and 
the Soviet Union was incredibly costly 
and incredibly dangerous. We don’t 
want to see Russia become the Soviet 
Union once again. When the Soviet 
Union was big and strong and mighty 
with a much bigger military, the lives 
of Americans and the lives of our allies 
were in much greater jeopardy. 
It is overwhelmingly in America’s in-
terest to prevent Putin from reassem-
bling the Soviet Union, because we do 
not want our enemies to become 
stronger and use that strength against 
us. 
No. 2, Putin is trying to seize control 
of energy. If he is successful, it will be 
felt by Americans filling up their cars 
with gas or trying to heat their homes 
in the winter. We have already seen 
what Putin has done with Nord Stream 
2, and he is not going to stop there. We 
don’t want to see a world where Putin 
controls energy. 
No. 3, the United States made a for-
mal commitment to help Ukrainians 
defend themselves. Why is that? Well, 
after Ukraine successfully declared 
independence from the Soviet Union in 
1991, the United States signed an agree-
ment 
called 
the 
Budapest 
Memo-
randum on Security Assurances. Under 
the terms of the agreement, Ukraine 
gave up its nuclear weapons in ex-
change for explicit assurances that the 
United States would protect Ukraine’s 
territorial sovereignty. Ukraine had 
the third largest nuclear arsenal on the 
face of the planet, and they volun-
tarily, willingly, gave it up. And we 
made a promise in exchange for that. 
And No. 4, if we don’t provide 
Ukrainians with weapons and they 
don’t defeat Putin, Putin will be 
emboldened and may well eventually 
invade a NATO country that the 
United States has a treaty obligation 
to defend. That would be an incredibly 
serious escalation that nobody wants 
to see. 
Some have further asked, ‘‘Why 
should America keep these commit-
ments?’’ Why should we keep our com-
mitment 
in 
the 
Budapest 
Memo-
randum? Why should we keep our trea-
ty commitments to the NATO coun-
tries? And the answer is, because one of 
the ways we protect American national 
security is, when we make an agree-
ment with a country, when we make a 
formal agreement, a treaty, we honor 
our commitments. 
We want countries to know that 
America stands by our friends and that 
we stand by our word and that our 
treaties mean something. 
If countries learned that under weak 
and feckless Presidents our formal 
binding documents aren’t worth the 
paper they are written on, it under-
mines the ability of any President of 
the United States to negotiate agree-
ments with our friends and allies to 
keep Americans safe. 
Another question I have heard is, 
why so much money? Sure, it is impor-
tant to help Ukraine win, but why 
should we spend so much? Again, I 
would have preferred for this to be a 
smaller bill. But, in fact, enormous 
amounts of money are both justified 
and necessary. Of this $40 billion, there 
is $9 billion for replenishing our own 
stockpiles, American stockpiles which 
have been badly depleted in recent 
months as we sought to help our 
Ukrainian allies. 
We are already beginning to see the 
risks and effects of depleted stockpiles. 
Just a few weeks ago, Taiwan’s Min-
istry of Defense announced there would 
be dramatic delays in the delivery of 
some weapons, including howitzers and 
Stingers. Making sure we have the 
weapons we need to defend ourselves is 
incontrovertibly a good thing, and $9 
billion of this $40 billion, I do not know 
a Senator in this body who could rea-
sonably object to replenishing our own 
military stores and weaponry to keep 
America safe with America’s military. 
There is also $10 billion in this bill 
for Ukrainian weapons and training, 
and altogether, $24 billion in military 
funds in this bill. Ukrainian weapons 
and training—the very things they 
have been using to defend themselves 
and that if we don’t replenish, will 
cause them to collapse. 
The Ukrainian military right now is 
using tens of thousands of artillery 
rounds and ammunition every couple of 
days. Already last month, there was a 
growing concern that Ukrainian forces 
engaged 
in 
heavy 
ground 
combat 
against Russian units would quickly go 
through that amount of ammunition. 
They have largely burned through 
the stockpiles of Russian-style ammu-
nition they are familiar with and used 
in the opening weeks of the war. And 
last month, U.S. officials assessed that 
40,000 rounds of artillery were only ex-
pected to last a few days. New efforts 
to resupply our Ukrainian allies are 
critical. 
There is also about $5 billion for food 
in this bill. Ukraine is rightly known 
as the bread basket of Europe. It is the 
sixth top exporter of wheat in the 
world, and there is a growing risk of 
global famine because of the disruption 
Russia’s 
invasion 
is 
causing 
in 
Ukraine. 
Devoting money now to stop count-
less people from starving to death in 
famine is a wise and prudent invest-
ment for American national interests. 
Then there is $9 billion in economic 
support funds for the Ukrainian gov-
ernment. Will a certain portion of that 
money be wasted? Absolutely. Will 
there be corruption? Almost certainly. 
If it were up to me, I would cut that 
amount from this bill. Might some of it 
end up funding a yacht for an oligarch? 
Very possibly. But unfortunately, this 
is what happens when Democrats have 
control of Congress and write the bill. 
When you have a bill authored by a 
Democratic White House and a Demo-
cratic Senate and a Democratic House, 
the result is you get waste and corrup-
tion and pork and fat and bloat in a 
bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2572 
May 18, 2022 
So the question facing each of us Re-
publicans is whether you are willing to 
cut off the missiles and cut off the bul-
lets that we are sending to Ukraine and 
allow Putin to win simply because 
there is a portion of this bill that is 
waste and corruption that the Demo-
crats have insisted on. 
The reality is that a Putin victory in 
Ukraine will be much, much more ex-
pensive for American taxpayers in the 
long run than this bill. And let me un-
derscore that point. If Putin wins, the 
consequences for America and Amer-
ican taxpayers will be hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars. 
From a purely fiscally conservative 
view, ensuring that the Ukrainians 
have enough military equipment to de-
fend themselves and to give Putin pun-
ishing defeats is overwhelmingly in our 
interest. And let me underscore as 
well: It is the Ukrainians doing the 
fighting. I do not want to see U.S. serv-
icemen and women in harm’s way. 
There is a reason I have vocally op-
posed a no-fly zone in Ukraine, because 
that would unreasonably increase the 
chances of an American pilot in an 
American jet engaging in combat with 
a Russian pilot in a Russian jet, and 
that escalation is not justified. 
But ensuring the Ukrainians have 
the weapons to defend themselves is 
very much in our own national secu-
rity interest. 
And now I want to talk about a ques-
tion that many Americans have not 
necessarily been asking but that is of 
staggering importance to our national 
security. And that is, ‘‘What does the 
war in Ukraine have to do with 
China?’’ The answer is, ‘‘An enormous 
amount.’’ 
Last summer, we watched the cata-
strophic withdrawal from Afghanistan 
unfold. We watched the surrender to 
the 
Taliban 
from 
Joe 
Biden. 
We 
watched the incompetence of this ad-
ministration in abandoning Americans 
and leaving them behind, abandoning 
Bagram airfield before we evacuated. 
When that happened, all across the 
globe, America’s enemies looked to 
Washington and took a measure of the 
man in the oval office, and, tragically, 
they concluded that President Biden 
was weak and feckless and ineffective. 
And a weak American President is dan-
gerous. 
When the catastrophic withdrawal 
from Afghanistan happened, I said pub-
licly that the chances of Putin invad-
ing Ukraine just rose tenfold. I also 
said, at the same time, the chances of 
China invading Taiwan just rose ten-
fold. 
We have now seen the first of these 
two things happen, because Putin un-
derstood the disastrous surrender and 
withdrawal in Afghanistan to mean 
that President Biden was weak, and 
weakness is provocative. 
If Putin wins in Ukraine, it will con-
firm to Xi in Communist China that he 
can confidently invade Taiwan and 
that America will be too weak and 
feckless to stand with our allies. 
But if Ukraine defeats Putin with the 
help of American weapons and military 
aid, Xi will see aggression as a recipe 
for failure and that the United States 
has the strength of will to stand by its 
allies to ensure that they have what 
they need to defend themselves. 
China is—mark my words—the most 
dangerous geopolitical adversary of the 
United States for the next 100 years. 
China has the military might of the 
Soviet Union with a much, much 
stronger economy and an economic en-
gine. 
China also carries out policies of 
murder and torture and genocide and 
slavery and lies and deception. A Chi-
nese invasion of Taiwan would be cata-
strophic for American national secu-
rity. Right now, today, over 90 percent 
of the world’s most advanced semicon-
ductor chips come from Taiwan. If 
China were to conquer Taiwan, it 
would give the Chinese Communist 
Party a stranglehold on the global sup-
ply of semiconductors. 
After that, if Xi wanted to turn off 
the supply of semiconductors to Ameri-
cans, he could do so instantly. It is 
simply irresponsible to allow that to 
happen, and it is impossible to over-
state the catastrophe that would im-
pose on Americans. 
Overnight, it would be impossible to 
acquire or repair pretty much every-
thing we rely on in modern life: Cars, 
planes, medical devices like pace-
makers, clean water, refrigerators, all 
rely on semiconductors—of course, so 
do vehicles, boats, tanks, missiles that 
we rely upon for our national defense. 
And even if China didn’t turn off the 
supply of those chips, they would be 
able to control what went into them, 
including potentially planting spyware 
and espionage directly and imme-
diately threatening American security. 
And it goes without saying, the Chi-
nese Communist Party would also im-
mediately control the price of semi-
conductors and what they go into, 
which would drive up the cost of pretty 
much everything to Americans. 
If you think $40 billion is a lot of 
money, just wait and see the disaster if 
the Chinese communists lock up semi-
conductors on the world stage and use 
them to extract monopoly profits from 
Americans while simultaneously spy-
ing on us using those same semi-
conductors. 
Just as we don’t want to see a world 
in which Putin controls energy, we 
should not want to see a world in which 
Xi controls semiconductors. 
I began this speech by talking about 
the consequences of failing to stop 
Nord Stream 2. I very much wish that 
these consequences had not come to 
pass, but the terrible reality is that 
President Biden failed in Afghanistan 
and failed again with Nord Stream 2, 
which played the decisive role in shap-
ing the current crisis. 
The 
reason 
we 
should 
help 
the 
Ukrainians defeat Putin by giving 
them weapons is the same reason we 
need to keep our thumb on China. And 
it is not what some of my colleagues on 
the Republican side have said: It is not 
to defend democracy across the globe; 
it is not to defend international norms. 
That sort of empty nonsense is the sort 
of things John Kerry says. 
The reason we should support our 
Ukrainian allies who are fighting and 
killing Russian soldiers is because it 
protects American national security, it 
keeps America safer, and it prevents 
our enemies from getting stronger, 
from threatening the safety and secu-
rity of Americans, and from driving up 
the costs, the economic damage to 
Americans, by hundreds of billions or 
even trillions of dollars. 
America needs to be strong—strong 
enough to stand up to Putin, strong 
enough to stand up to communist 
China, strong enough to defend the 
greatest Nation in the history of the 
world. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
came to speak to the Senate about Po-
lice Week as we honor the law enforce-
ment officers who made the ultimate 
sacrifice. 
Before I do that, we know that Putin 
was shocked by two things. He was 
shocked by the amazing resistance and 
the strength and the resiliency of the 
Ukrainian people and the effectiveness 
of 
their 
fight 
back. 
Putin 
really 
couldn’t believe that happened. 
The other thing that Putin was 
shocked by was the skill with which 
President Biden put together 
this 
international coalition of countries 
that were not part of this in the past, 
part of something—Germany, Switzer-
land, Sweden, Finland—countries that 
now a couple of them want to be in 
NATO, and that really is the skill of 
the leadership of President Biden. 
And I know, in spite of the Senator 
from Texas’s comments—I know that 
most mainstream Republicans support 
what President Biden has done, support 
his work on putting together sanc-
tions—first, 
providing 
aid 
for 
the 
Ukrainian people, the humanitarian 
aid, refugees going to Moldova, going 
to Poland, going to other parts of East-
ern and Central and Southern Europe, 
and the skill with which he has gotten 
and the success with which he has got-
ten weapons to the Ukrainian people 
and the skills with which he put to-
gether sanctions. 
The Presiding Officer, as a member of 
the Banking and Housing Committee, 
has been part of that with sanctions, 
and it has really made a difference in 
keeping these countries together at the 
fastest pace we could do it but keeping 
them together. 
So most Republicans support what 
President Biden has done. But, you 
know, I am not saying that the Senator 
from Texas is part of this, but I have 
heard Congresswoman CHENEY, who is 
nothing if not a conservative Repub-
lican, daughter of a very conservative

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2573 
May 18, 2022 
Vice President, active in the Repub-
lican Party and Republican leader-
ship—she talks about the Putin wing of 
the Republican Party. 
Again, I am not saying that she in-
cludes the Senator from Texas in that 
category. I don’t know if she does or 
she doesn’t. I didn’t hear her mention 
names, but I do know that she thinks 
that a number of Republicans are part 
of this Putin wing of the Republican 
Party, and it is despicable, but it is 
true, and it is disappointing to all of 
us. 
And I would add, too, that the Sen-
ator from Texas, maybe he missed the 
news as he was talking about chips, 
computer chips, about semiconductors. 
Intel made a huge announcement that 
they are coming to Ohio. They are 
going to invest billions of dollars. They 
are 
going 
to 
hire 
5,000 
building 
tradespeople—5,000 tradespeople—over 
a 10-year period to build these fabs. 
Imagine the size of that. I have never 
seen anything like that. 
So I am excited about what we are 
doing, and that is why it is so impor-
tant what Senator WYDEN and I and 
others are doing on making sure that 
we pass the USICA—the Innovation 
and Competition Act. It is so impor-
tant to our country. It is so important 
to workers. We are finally putting 
workers at the center of our economic 
policy, and that is a thrill. 
And as President Biden said on the 
Senate floor, we are finally burying the 
term ‘‘Rust Belt.’’ We are burying it in 
Columbus with Intel. We are burying it 
in Northwest Ohio with solar manufac-
turing. We are burying it in Southwest 
Ohio with a new generation of jet fuel 
and jet engines. We are burying it in 
Cleveland with what we are doing with 
NASA. We are burying it in Youngs-
town with our manufacturing camps 
and all that we are doing for America 
Works. 
Mr. CRUZ. Will the Senator yield for 
a question? 
Mr. BROWN. Sure. 
Mr. CRUZ. Just a moment ago, the 
Senator from Ohio made reference to 
the alleged existence of the so-called 
Putin wing of the Republican Party. 
I would like to ask the Senator from 
Ohio, Is it accurate that the Senator 
from Ohio and 43 of his Democratic col-
leagues in January of this year voted 
against sanctioning Nord Stream 2, 
sanctioning Russia, sanctioning Putin, 
despite the fact that Ukraine begged 
the Senate to pass those sanctions and 
Putin invaded Ukraine just days after 
44 Democrats sided with Russia and 
Putin? 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
take back my time. 
I have heard no Democrat talk 
about—I have heard nobody talk about 
the Putin wing of the Democratic 
Party. No Democrat believes that. 
I hear just down the hall 100 yards, 
Congresswoman CHENEY talk about the 
Putin wing of the Republican Party. I 
am not in intraparty fights; I am only 
pointing that out. 
I want to get to this. We expect a 
vote soon after 6, and I want to get 
back to my remarks. I appreciate the 
engagement of Senator CRUZ on this 
issue 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Madam President, we honor during 
Police Week the law enforcement offi-
cials in our State who made the ulti-
mate sacrifice. 
This year, we will add to the Na-
tional Law Enforcement Memorial the 
names of 10 Ohioans who laid down 
their lives last year: Officer Brandon 
Stalker, Deputy Donald Gilreath III, 
Natural 
Resources 
Officer 
Jason 
Lagore, Officer Scott Dawley, Deputy 
Sheriff Robert Craig Mills, Deputy 
Sheriff Boyd Blake, Corrections Lieu-
tenant David Reynolds, Corrections Of-
ficer Joshua Kristek, Patrolman Sean 
VanDenberg, and Officer Shane Bartek. 
Each of these losses is a tragedy for a 
family, for a community, for all of law 
enforcement officials in this country. 
We know in too many places right 
now the trust between law enforcement 
and the community is too often frayed 
or broken. 
These Ohio lives are a reminder of 
the ideals we strive for—women and 
men who are true public servants in 
the best sense of the word, people who 
give themselves to their communities, 
and these Ohioans gave so much. 
Let me mention each one briefly. 
Officer Brandon Stalker, a 24-year- 
old father of two young children, de-
voted to his fiance. His first partner, 
Officer Brent Kieffer, said he had a 
‘‘constant smile and unfailing sense of 
humor.’’ 
He added that ‘‘[e]very single day we 
went on patrol, Brandon was all about 
trying to serve the community. He 
truly wanted to make the community a 
better place.’’ 
That comes from his patrol col-
league. 
Before joining the force, the Toledo 
native coached baseball at his former 
high school and was passionate about 
mentoring young players. 
He gave his life last January pro-
tecting his community. 
Officer Stalker, rest in peace. 
Natural 
Resources 
Officer 
Jason 
Lagore was a Chillicothe native, de-
voted husband, and father of two sons. 
Those who knew him talked about his 
love of his job and commitment to 
helping people. 
When he joined the Department of 
National Resources in 2005, he per-
suaded his bosses to let him bring in 
and train Ranger, his first K–9 partner. 
Over the years, he grew the program, 
showing that department how success-
ful K–9 teams could be. The department 
now has K–9 units all across the State. 
Lieutenant Hoffer watched his friend 
build the program from the ground up. 
He said of Officer Lagore: 
He did it all himself, and we couldn’t have 
had a better person. He was patient, a good 
all-around person, a good officer, and he 
knew what he was doing. 
Last February, Officer Lagore and 
his K–9 partner Sarge were helping 
with a search operation at Rocky Fork 
State Park in Highland County, south-
west of Columbus, when he suffered a 
heart attack and fell into a lake. He 
was 36 years old. 
Ohio Department of National Re-
sources posthumously honored him 
with the Director’s Award of Valor. Di-
rector Mertz said: 
Because of his courage and bravery in the 
face of danger, there is no one more deserv-
ing of this honor. 
Rest in peace, Officer Labore. 
Officer 
Scott 
Dawley 
served 
his 
hometown of Nelsonville near Athens, 
a small tight-knit community. His 
death last August in a three-vehicle 
crash responding to a call was felt 
across town. 
One lifelong resident said of Officer 
Dawley: 
He loved his community, and the commu-
nity loved him back. The outpouring of grief 
and support was overwhelming. 
He had just gotten married in April, 
making a blended family of nine. 
He was a devoted father. He coached 
his son’s baseball team. His wife 
Marissa said one of her happiest memo-
ries was watching her 9-year-old daugh-
ter give Officer Dawley a makeover, 
complete with finger and toenail pol-
ish. 
Officer Dawley, rest in peace. 
Officer Shane Bartek was 25 years old 
when he was killed during a carjacking 
at a West Side apartment complex not 
too far from my house on New Year’s 
Eve, just 28 months after he joined the 
Cleveland Division of Police. 
His family said that from a young 
age, he always wanted to be an officer. 
His greatest aspiration was to become 
a detective. 
His twin sister Summer talked about 
how Officer Bartek loved to participate 
in the annual ‘‘shop with a cop’’ event 
during the holiday season, allowing a 
child who has been touched by law en-
forcement to buy and give Christmas 
presents to that family. 
One colleague said: 
He would tell me how much he wanted to 
touch other people’s lives so he could actu-
ally make an impact. And he did that. 
Officer Bartek, rest in peace. 
Last year, we also lost six officers to 
COVID–19: Deputy Gilreath, Deputy 
Sheriff Mills, Deputy Sheriff Blake, 
Corrections Lieutenant Reynolds, Cor-
rections Officer Kristek, and Patrol-
man VanDenberg. 
While many of us were still social 
distancing and working from home, po-
lice officers, like other essential work-
ers—grocery 
store 
workers, 
nurses, 
technicians, food service people, all on 
the frontline of our community, all es-
sential workers, even though many 
were not paid like it—risked their own 
health to keep our communities safe. 
We can’t begin to repay the debt we 
owe these officers and their families.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2574 
May 18, 2022 
We can work to better support officers 
in the communities they swear an oath 
to protect. 
It is why I am working with col-
leagues of both parties on legislation 
to support them as they do their jobs. 
I joined my colleague Senator GRASS-
LEY to introduce the Fighting Post- 
Traumatic Stress Disorder Act. It 
would increase mental health support 
for police, fire, emergency medical, and 
9–1-1 personnel as they cope with the 
stress of responding to crisis situa-
tions. 
These Ohioans deal with some of the 
most tense and life-threatening situa-
tions in our communities—car acci-
dents, fires, family disputes, people in 
mental health crises. 
So often our local police and fire de-
partments don’t have the resources to 
offer comprehensive mental health sup-
port. The Grassley-Brown bill will help 
us do that. 
I also introduced the Expanding 
Health Care Options for Early Retirees 
Act, a bill that would allow retired po-
lice officers and other first responders 
to buy into Medicare beginning at age 
50. 
Police officers and other first re-
sponders wear their bodies out pro-
tecting our families and communities. 
They should have access to affordable 
healthcare when their service comes to 
an end. 
This simple solution would ensure ac-
cess to healthcare for police officers 
who are forced to retire but aren’t yet 
eligible for Medicare. 
I am working across the aisle with 
Senator THUNE and others to fix out-
dated IRS rules that prevent public 
safety officers from making tax-free 
withdrawals from retirement accounts 
to cover healthcare premiums. 
We need to make sure police and fire 
can retire with dignity. Part of dignity 
of work is retiring with dignity. At the 
very least, that means they should be 
able to afford the healthcare they need. 
This Police Week, let’s offer more 
than empty words. Let’s honor the 
memories of these women, these men 
who laid down their lives in service of 
their communities by getting their fel-
low officers the tools they need, the 
training they need to do their jobs and 
to build trust with the communities 
they are sworn to protect. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the scheduled 
vote be called immediately. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTE ON WATSON NOMINATION 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Watson nomi-
nation? 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from New Jersey (Mr. MENEN-
DEZ), the Senator from Nevada (Ms.

BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
in tracking through what is happening 
on our southern border, it is inter-
esting I still have folks that catch me 
and say, ‘‘I don’t see anything about it 
in the news anymore, so what is hap-
pening?’’ 
So I try to periodically come here to 
the floor to be able to describe what is 
happening. Interestingly enough, just 
yesterday, the leadership of CBP did 
their news release that they normally 
do to kind of outline what is happening 
at the border. 
In their news release they released 
out: 
CBP works to secure and manage our bor-
ders while building a fair and orderly 
[im]migration system. 
This is what they put out yesterday— 
while we build an orderly and fair mi-
gration system. 
Interestingly enough, this was a pic-
ture taken the day before their press 
release. This was taken in the Eagle 
Pass area of Texas in the Rio Grande 
Valley, and, yes, that line you see are 
people coming across the river in Eagle 
Pass. 
Now, you don’t catch everything be-
cause you can’t see how much farther 
it goes this way and how much farther 
it goes that way. 
This was the day before CBP released 
this statement: We work to secure and 
manage our borders while building a 
fair and orderly migration system. 
Earlier in the report, the very first 
page of the news release, CBP leader-
ship said: 
After many months of planning, we are 
executing a comprehensive strategy to safe-
ly, orderly, and humanely manage our bor-
ders. CBP is surging personnel and resources 
to the border, increasing processing capac-
ity, securing more air and ground transpor-
tation, and increasing medical supplies, food, 
water and other resources to ensure a hu-
mane environment for those being processed, 
screened, and vetted. 
By the way, just south and west of 
this, just the day before this was 
taken, Border Patrol picked up two 
child sex predators, four MS–13 gang 
members, and an 18th Street gang 
member—just right before this, just 
the day before this was released. 
This is our frustration with the ad-
ministration right now. Because the 
media has turned away and decided 
they are not going to look at this, that 
they are not going to pay attention to 
it, everyone seems to think everything 
has just gotten fine. 
What is really happening on our 
southern border, again, from current 
statistics right now, they are only able 
to handle 44 percent of the flow coming 
across the border. At 44 percent of the 
flow, right now, they are releasing 
thousands of people directly into the 
country with a notice to report saying: 
‘‘Turn yourself in to an ICE facility 
anywhere in the country, and they will 
process you there,’’ because they can’t 
handle the backlog of the thousands of 
people coming across. 
What are we talking about, thou-
sands of people? Well, remember last 
year when the cameras were all focused 
on the southern border? Last year, 
there 
were 
6,500 
migrants 
coming 
across a day at this time, and all the 
cameras were focused on the southern 
border because it was such a massive 
influx of people because 6,500 migrants 
were crossing a day. Right now, 7,800 
migrants are crossing a day—7,800 a 
day. 
Last month, the CBP released that 
almost a quarter million people ille-
gally crossed our southern border in 1 
month. That beat the old record of the 
month before when there was just 
under that by a couple thousand peo-
ple—a quarter million people a month 
illegally crossing the border. 
Now, to their credit, about half of 
those are turned away under what is

S2576 
May 18, 2022 
called title 42 authority because of the 
pandemic. Those single adults, half of 
them are turned back, but the inter-
esting thing is the administration says 
on May 23—yes, next week—on May 23, 
they want to end title 42 authority, and 
so they are not turning anyone away at 
the border—so literally all quarter mil-
lion cross into the country and no one 
gets turned away. When that happens, 
DHS’s own numbers have estimated 
that when that occurs, they estimate 
that they will see a million people 
surge through the border in 6 weeks—6 
weeks. 
So what is happening on interior en-
forcement? Well, at the border right 
now, they are allowing a quarter mil-
lion people to cross the border, turning 
half of them away, but their plan is, 
next week, they are going to stop turn-
ing anyone away. Everyone is going to 
cross in. 
How many people are being deported? 
Criminal aliens, individuals that have 
a final order of removal from a court, 
how is that going? Well, currently, 
under this administration, we have a 
record low number of deportations that 
are happening. While we have 7,800 peo-
ple a day illegally crossing the border, 
ICE is now deporting 203 people a day 
from the Nation. 
So let me run those numbers past 
you again: 7,800 people a day illegally 
crossing the border, 203 people being 
turned around due to ICE custody and 
releasing them back into their country 
where they came from. 
Now, these aren’t folks just from 
Central America. In fact, now about 
half of the people coming are not from 
Mexico or Central America. They are 
coming from all over the world. Last 
year, we had people from every single 
country on the planet illegally cross 
the border in the 2 million people that 
crossed the border. They came from 
every single country in the world—yes, 
including Iran and North Korea, all of 
it. 
But this administration is now work-
ing towards next week saying we are 
going to lift title 42 authority, and we 
are not going to turn anyone around. 
Currently, what is happening? When 
individuals come across the border, 
they are given notification. They will 
request for asylum, all they have to 
say is, ‘‘I have credible fear.’’ They will 
say, ‘‘What city would you like to go to 
in the entire U.S.? You can go to any 
city you want to go to.’’ They pick 
their city, they are given a piece of 
paper, and on that piece of paper, they 
are told here is your court date 8 years 
in the future—8 years in the future. 
And they go anywhere they want to in 
the country for the next 8 years. 
And they are told to keep that piece 
of paper with them. If they are ever 
pulled over, they can pull it out and 
show: I am awaiting my court date. I 
am here for the next 8 years. 
Now, let me ask you a simple ques-
tion: If I have to go through the legal 
process to be able to get a visa or a 
work visa and go through all of that 
process and fill out paperwork, or—and 
I will be here just temporarily for a 
season, or I can illegally cross the bor-
der and I will be here for the next 8 
years, which would you pick? 
This 
administration 
is 
literally 
incentivizing 
this 
and 
encouraging 
more people to illegally cross the bor-
der. Is there a way to be able to handle 
this? Yes, there is. Some of it is overly 
simplistic, I understand. Let’s start 
with finish building the wall system 
because there are gaps in the fence and 
everyone heads towards those gaps in 
the fence. 
I am not the only one saying that. 
The career professionals at Border Pa-
trol are saying that is one of the prime 
things that they need. 
Do they say that is the only thing 
they need? No. There is a lot more they 
need, but they are saying that is a real-
ly important element that they need is 
that fencing. That slows people down; 
that funnels people towards gaps. Build 
a wall system. 
No. 2, don’t lift title 42, keep it in 
place. I am not the only one saying 
that. I had an ambassador from a Cen-
tral American country contact me this 
week and say: We are asking the White 
House not to lift title 42 authority be-
cause, in Central America, we are fac-
ing thousands of people migrating 
through our country from all over the 
world that are headed to the United 
States, and it is causing economic tur-
moil in their country. And their fear is, 
if President Biden lifts title 42 author-
ity, it is going to make a bad situation 
in their country even worse. 
And while President Biden talks 
about root causes in Central America, 
Central America is telling the United 
States: 
Enforce 
your 
border; 
stop 
incentivizing people to illegally travel 
to your border; that is one of the root 
causes of migration. 
Finish building the wall system. 
Don’t lift title 42 authority. Have coop-
erative agreements with other coun-
tries. This has been done by multiple 
Presidents before to be able to have en-
gagement with other countries so that 
they enforce their border. And I don’t 
mean just say to them: Go enforce your 
border. Help them. If they don’t en-
force their southern border and their 
southern border and their southern 
border, it all piles up here, and right 
now, the Biden administration is just 
letting them all in. 
Asylum hearings: Individuals that re-
quest asylum are legally bound to ac-
tually have asylum. There is lots of 
changes that need to happen in asylum 
laws, but let me just say this simply. 
This administration right now with 
current asylum laws could do last in, 
first up for hearings. Instead of hand-
ing people a piece of paper and say, 
You are here for the next 8 years until 
the next asylum hearing if you cross 
the border illegally right now, they 
say, you have to stay right here at the 
border for the next 2 weeks; your hear-
ing is in 2 weeks, and it is in that 
courtroom right over there here at the 
border. 
They go through the legal process to 
be able to request asylum. When they 
do not qualify, they are returned. That 
sends an entirely different signal—be-
cause what the Border Patrol tells me 
now is, when individuals cross the bor-
der, get a piece of paper that says you 
are going to be here for the next 8 
years, they quickly pull out their cell 
phone, snap a picture of it, text their 
family back home and say: I paid this 
cartel member, I crossed at this spot, I 
said these words, and I got this piece of 
paper; come join me. And the next per-
son comes, and the next person comes. 
If what happens instead when they 
cross the border is they get there and 
their hearing is in 2 weeks and then 
they find out they don’t qualify for 
asylum and they are returned, they in-
stead text their family members and 
say: Don’t come. The border is closed. 
Nothing has changed at that point 
other than the enforcement. That can 
be done right now. 
Fourth, Federal courts have required 
the Biden administration to put what 
is called MPP or what some people call 
‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ back in place. So 
the Biden administration, following 
the court order, has spent millions of 
dollars standing up facilities, putting 
up courtrooms, and they are putting 
almost no one through them, so they 
can tell the Federal court they are 
doing it. 
What do I mean by that? I mean 7,800 
people crossing a day illegally, the 
Biden administration is putting about 
2,000 people a month through the MPP 
process simply so they can say they 
followed the court order, but they are 
not. 
So 7,800 people a day and they are 
doing 2,000 a month through MPP. That 
is decorative; that is not border en-
forcement. It is why I tell people the 
Biden administration is getting in ille-
gal immigration exactly what they de-
signed the system to do: to have more 
people come. 
Finally, deport people that a court 
has ruled they should be deported—this 
does not mean this is following the 
law. 
We have literally thousands of people 
in the United States that a Federal 
court has ruled a final order of removal 
on individuals and said: You are not 
legal in this country, and you have 
gone through all of the process; you 
need to be removed. Currently, ICE is 
not removing them. Again, sending the 
signal to everyone that wants to come 
here illegally that if you pay the car-
tels, you get across. You stay for 8 
years, and then after 8 years, no one is 
looking for you. 
That is why we had 2 million people 
last year illegally crossing the border. 
That is why we had a quarter million 
people last month illegally cross the 
border, because this administration 
just keeps saying, I don’t want to be 
mean. We are going to open this up. 
We are not asking for something 
crazy. We are just asking for the law to 
be enforced.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2577 
May 18, 2022 
What is mean? What is inhumane? I 
will tell you what is inhumane. In Feb-
ruary of this year, Reuters did a story 
on a young girl named Amelia. Amelia 
borrowed $10,000 to pay the smugglers 
from Guatemala to be able to cross 
into the United States in Arizona. She 
borrowed $10,000 from the human traf-
fickers. 
She got across the border. She was 
referred to the HHS Office of Refugee 
Resettlements, unaccompanied minors, 
after crossing. That is right, Amelia is 
under 
18. 
So 
HHS 
processed 
her 
through, moved her into the location 
that she had as a piece of paper to say 
this is the location I need to go. She 
traveled to that location and got to 
that spot, and HHS said: Our duty is 
done. 
When Reuters found her, she was 
working on a poultry processing farm 
in rural Alabama with her sister Rosa. 
When they asked her why she wasn’t in 
school, she responded: School isn’t for 
me; I have debt—because she is work-
ing in a poultry processing facility in 
Alabama 
to 
pay 
off 
the 
cartel’s 
$10,000—she and her sister both. 
She also, by the way, paid $1,500 to 
get a false Social Security card and a 
false ID, and she is working to pay off 
that debt as well. 
While the administration continues 
to call this humane and leadership of 
CBP calls this orderly this week, I 
don’t think it is humane or orderly for 
us to open up our borders to individ-
uals being trafficked into our own 
country to pay cartels $10,000 a person 
that then they come into this country 
and work their debt off in labor camps 
for the cartel. 
By the way, for Amelia and for her 
sister Rosa, this story can be repeated 
all over again with multiple individ-
uals who pay off their debt to the car-
tels by trafficking in illicit materials 
because the cartel will say: If you took 
the loan out from us, you pay us back 
our way. 
That is what we are facilitating in 
America, and all we are asking the 
Biden administration to do is enforce 
the law. That is what it means to be 
President of the United States. 
I yield the floor.

CONFIRMATION OF BRIDGET A. BRINK 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Madam Presi-
dent, we have just confirmed Bridget 
A. Brink, of Michigan, to become the 
Ambassador to Ukraine. This was very 
important. I am so glad we could fi-
nally do this by unanimous consent. 
As we all know, the relationships be-
tween the United States and Ukraine 
are so vital, and to have no Ambas-
sador really hinders our relationship in 
ways that nobody would want to see. 
To have an Ambassador there at this 
crucial link, as the United States con-
tinues to help the Ukrainian people re-
sist brutal and vicious attacks by Rus-
sia, is a wonderful thing, a good thing, 
and will help advance the cause of 
peace, security, and freedom. 
So I am very glad that we did this, 
and I congratulate Bridget A. Brink. I 
have every confidence that she will be 
an outstanding Ambassador and help 
Ukraine 
overcome 
the 
attacks 
by 
Putin.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
UNITY PARK 
∑ Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
South 
Carolina. 
Madam President, I would like to con-
gratulate and honor the city of Green-
ville in South Carolina for their open-
ing of Unity Park on May 19, 2022. 
Harlan Kelsey, a nationally known 
landscape artist commissioned by the 
Municipal League of Greenville, pub-
lished recommendations for improve-
ments to Greenville more than a cen-
tury ago in 1907. His recommendations 
identified what is now the site for 
Unity Park. The transformative 60-acre 
park will help bring people together to 
celebrate the diversity of the Green-
ville community. 
The park comes after 22 months of 
construction, nearly $13 million in pri-
vate donations, and countless hours of 
community engagement. With this ad-
dition, the city has committed to 
bringing more affordable housing to 
nine acres near the park, created a lo-
cation to celebrate the community, 
built a place to continue highlighting 
the rich history of Greenville, and is 
transforming one of our State’s des-
ignated Opportunity Zones: Unity Park 
will 
feature 
playgrounds 
and 
splashpads, a welcome center, numer-
ous trails and bridges, and an observa-
tion tower. 
I commend the city of Greenville on 
the park’s opening and their commit-
ment to growth, success, and commu-
nity.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mr. MORAN): 
S. 4246. A bill to direct the Secretary 
of Transportation to establish a pilot 
program to provide grants related to 
advance air mobility infrastructure, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Advanced 
Aviation Infrastructure Modernization 
Act, which I introduced today. 
Next-generation propulsion aircraft, 
including electric vertical takeoff and 
landing aircraft, are poised to revolu-
tionize how people and cargo move 
within and between cities, suburban, 
and rural areas. These advanced air 
mobility technologies also present the 
potential to transform how we link his-
torically underserved communities and

deploy a new type of transportation 
that does not require physical roads or 
rails. 
As localities, regions, and States con-
sider how to integrate the advent of 
these technologies and the opportuni-
ties to relieve traffic congestion and 
improve mobility options, a modest 
Federal investment can help commu-
nities ensure that cutting-edge, clean, 
quiet aviation technologies can be best 
integrated into existing and future 
transportation networks. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this bill to help States and localities 
keep pace with this growing sector. It 
would establish a pilot program to help 
State, local, and Tribal governments to 
prepare for anticipated advanced air 
mobility operations and ensure com-
munities can take advantage of the po-
tential benefits of the safe integration 
of these technologies in our Nation’s 
airspace. 
I want to thank Senator MORAN for 
coleading this bill with me, and I hope 
our colleagues will join us in support of 
this bill that will help communities 
prepare for the development and de-
ployment of advanced air mobility 
technologies and related infrastruc-
ture. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mr. MENENDEZ, and Mr. BROWN): 
S. 4247. A bill to amend the Public 
Works and Economic Development Act 
of 1965 to establish university centers 
to encourage certain economic develop-
ment, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Environment and Public 
Works. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the University 
Centers for Growth, Development, and 
Prosperity Act, which I introduced 
today. 
The U.S. Economic Development Ad-
ministration created the University 
Center Program to allow institutions 
of higher education and consortia to 
establish and maintain university cen-
ters, with the understanding that our 
higher education institutions play a 
critical role in our Nation’s economic 
growth. 
University centers are Federal part-
nerships that leverage the assets of 
higher 
learning 
institutions 
to 
strengthen regional economic growth 
by promoting innovation, entrepre-
neurship, and job creation. They en-
courage economic development in eco-
nomically distressed regions, which 
helps spur job growth, high-skilled re-
gional talent pools, and business ex-
pansion. 
Despite EDA’s important work, many 
communities across the country have 
yet to benefit from the Agency’s pro-
grams, including smaller communities, 
communities of color, and rural areas 
experiencing higher rates of poverty. 
The current University Center Pro-
gram is not specifically authorized by 
Congress and is instead part of EDA’s 
Technical Assistance Program. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
legislation that would codify and ex-
pand the University Center Program, 
leverage more resources for minority- 
serving institutions, and support a 
greater diversity of innovation and en-
trepreneurship in their communities. 
California has thriving institutions, in-
cluding Chico State and Fresno State, 
that will be able to scale their impact 
with new resources. By prioritizing the 
establishment of new university cen-
ters at colleges and universities that 
serve significant populations of under-
served students, we can strengthen re-
gional economies and help close the ra-
cial wealth gap. 
Specifically, the bill establishes an 
EDA University Center Program to 
help universities collaborate with eco-
nomic development districts, trade ad-
justment assistance centers, and other 
economic development technical as-
sistance and service providers to de-
velop and implement comprehensive 
economic development strategies and 
other economic development planning 
at the local, regional, and State levels, 
with a focus on innovation, entrepre-
neurship, and workforce development. 
It also prioritizes the participation of 
minority-serving institutions as part of 
the University Center Program. Minor-
ity-serving institutions provide incred-
ible opportunities for so many low-in-
come and first-generation students. I 
am proud that my State of California 
is home to 174 Hispanic-serving institu-
tions and 51 emerging Hispanic-serving 
institutions the highest amount in the 
country. 
As a Senator representing one of the 
most diverse States in the country, I 
am proud to work with my colleagues 
to ensure that we work to improve the 
equity of EDA programming and help 
increase the participation of minority- 
serving institutions. 
I want to thank Congressman PETE 
AGUILAR for introducing this bill with 
me, and I hope our colleagues will join 
us in support of this effort.

By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, 
Mr. BOOZMAN, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. 
HOEVEN, Mr. BROWN, Mr. MAR-
SHALL, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mrs. 
CAPITO, Mr. BENNET, Mr. TILLIS,

and Mr. KELLY): 
S. 4257. A bill to amend the Child Nu-
trition Act of 1966 to establish require-
ments for infant formula cost contain-
ment contracts, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Agriculture, Nu-
trition, and Forestry. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I re-
member being a new mom and then a 
new grandma, and all you want to do is 
hold your baby close and savor every 
single moment. Instead, parents across 
the country right now are in a panic— 
forced to search high and low to find 
baby formula, the safe baby formula 
that they need, any safe baby formula. 
Almost half of all of our babies born 
in the United States receive their baby 
formula through a really important 
program called WIC—the Women, In-
fants, and Children program—that we 
are so proud of, and it is something 
that has made sure that safe baby for-
mula and healthy food is available for 
pregnant moms and for babies through-
out the first years of a baby’s life. So, 
as all of this has happened now with 
this emergency—and it is a huge emer-
gency, a huge crisis—there are no op-
tions here when children—you know, 
when babies need to eat. When babies 
are born, they need safe baby formula. 
This has been an ‘‘all hands on deck’’ 
moment for all of us. That is why, as 
chair of the Senate Agriculture, Nutri-
tion, and Forestry Committee—and I 
am so proud the Presiding Officer is a 
member of our committee, is a very 
valued member of our committee—I am 
joined with our ranking member, JOHN 
BOOZMAN, 
to 
introduce 
legislation 
today to make sure that the USDA can 
be as flexible as possible in getting our 
moms and dads and, most importantly, 
babies the critical baby formula that 
they need right now. 
We are doing this in conjunction with 
the House, which also has bipartisan 
legislation. It is my understanding 
that they will be voting on that soon, 
and I am hopeful that we can do the 
same thing. This should be something 
that brings us all together as quickly 
as possible. 
As an example, the reason we need 
the bill dealing with WIC—and there is 
a lot and so much positive that comes 
from this program. But right now, we 
make sure that there are safety stand-
ards, high-quality safety standards, 
and that we negotiate, through a com-
petitive process, the best price for 
moms and babies, but we now need to 
have flexibility so when a family—for 
instance, maybe, in Traverse City, MI, 
or in Lansing or in Detroit—goes to a 
grocery store and there is only one 
brand on the shelf and it is not the 
brand under the WIC contract, that 
they can buy it. If that is the only 
thing available, they need to be able to 
use their WIC support to be able to pur-
chase that. 
That is something that our USDA 
Secretary has jumped into gear to be 
able to make that happen, but we have 
got to make sure that that can con-
tinue, or we have got to make sure if a 
parent, again, goes to the store and 
there are different sizes of formula 
cans or different prescriptions that 
normally would not fit under the WIC 
contract, that they can waive those be-
cause we have to be able to get what-
ever is safe baby formula to families as 
quickly as possible. 
These may sound like small things, 
but they are the difference right now 
between whether or not our families on 
WIC are able to actually get the for-
mula that they need. 
In order to make sure that that con-
tinues, we have introduced legislation 
that will guarantee that the flexibili-
ties the USDA needs will continue be-
yond the public health pandemic flexi-
bilities that they are currently oper-
ating under. They have short-term 
flexibilities 
because 
of 
the 
public 
health pandemic. We want to make 
sure this is permanent and that wheth-
er it is a recall, a safety recall, a sup-
ply chain breakdown—whatever it is— 
that, with all hands on deck, the USDA 
has the capacity—the authority, the 
tools—to be able to move forward and 
make sure that they can respond as 
quickly as possible. 
We also want to guarantee that for-
mula manufacturers that want to com-
pete for these WIC contracts have a 
plan in place to respond to any kind of 
shortage so we don’t have this situa-
tion happen again. There is just no ex-
cuse, frankly, for what happened here. 
I want to thank Secretary Vilsack 
and the USDA for moving quickly once 
they were notified about the Abbott 
plant shutdown. 
I am deeply concerned that they were 
not given a heads-up earlier. The FDA 
was working for months, evidently—for 
a few months—with Abbott around 
concerns as it related to the safety 
standards and so on at the plant, and 
the USDA needed to know sooner so 
that they could prepare sooner. They 
understand how serious this is, what an 
emergency it is. So, when they found 
out, they went immediately into gear 
to make sure that our moms and ba-
bies, if at all possible, in any way pos-
sible, could get what they need. That 
has to be a top priority, not just for the 
moms and babies on WIC; all moms, all 
parents, all babies need to make sure 
that it is an ‘‘all hands on deck’’ and 
that we are moving as fast as possible. 
That is why I also want to thank 
President Biden and the FDA for work-
ing with other baby formula manufac-
turers to increase supplies. 
Supplies are going up. I am very anx-
ious to see more manufacturers of baby 
formula. I think we, as in every area, it 
seems, of our economy, have too much 
consolidation—that is certainly true 
here—and we need more competition, 
and we need more baby formula manu-
facturers competing for our contracts. 
We need to have a contract that gives 
the best price to WIC’s moms and dads 
and babies, but we need to make sure 
that we have as many large and small 
companies that are competing for that 
to be able to make sure that we have 
the formula available and that we are 
getting the very best price. 
I also want to thank them for care-
fully and thoughtfully opening up im-
ports from the European Union. We 
certainly have other countries that 
have the same very high safety stand-
ards that we do. We have got to make 
sure that anything that comes in is of 
the very highest safety standard. 
We know that, right now, we have 
got to make sure that baby formula is 
on the shelf. Children—babies—need 
this every day, not ‘‘let’s wait a month 
or 2 months.’’ This is like today that 
this needs to be happening. Again, 
there needs to be a sense of urgency to 
do whatever we can related to this 
issue and look at all aspects of it to 
make sure that this does not happen 
again, if at all possible. This should not 
be happening again. 
Within our WIC bill, we are focused 
on what we can do to support the 
USDA to have the maximum flexibili-
ties to support moms and babies and on 
what we can do to make sure the man-
ufacturers are prepared if something

like this were to happen—some short-
age—down the road. We need to make 
sure that we are looking at every as-
pect of this and acting now, as fast as 
possible, and then preparing for the fu-
ture. 
I want to thank, again, Senator 
BOOZMAN and welcome all of our Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle to join us 
in what, I hope, will be legislation that 
moves very, very quickly. 
The Access to Baby Formula Act is 
something that every single Member of 
the U.S. Senate should be supporting 
so that we can move this legislation 
out as quickly as possible, working 
with the House, and getting this done.

(2) performing the duties of a law enforce-
ment officer with fidelity to the constitu-
tional and civil rights of the public the offi-
cers serve; 
Whereas law enforcement officers swear an 
oath to uphold the public trust even though, 
through the performance of the duties of a 
law enforcement officer, the officers may be-
come targets for senseless acts of violence; 
Whereas law enforcement officers have 
bravely continued to meet the call of duty to 
ensure the security of their neighborhoods 
and communities at the risk of their own 
personal safety in the time of a viral pan-
demic; 
Whereas the resolve to service is clearly 
demonstrated by law enforcement officers 
across the country who have tragically fall-
en ill or passed away due to complications of 
COVID–19 contracted in the line of duty; 
Whereas, in 1962, President John Fitzgerald 
Kennedy signed Public Law 87–726 (referred 
to in this preamble as the ‘‘Joint Resolu-
tion’’), which authorizes the President to 
proclaim May 15 of every year as ‘‘Peace Of-
ficers Memorial Day’’ in honor of the Fed-
eral, State, and local officers who have been 
killed, disabled, or otherwise injured in the 
line of duty; 
Whereas the Joint Resolution also author-
izes the President to designate the week in 
which Peace Officers Memorial Day falls as 
‘‘National Police Week’’; 
Whereas the National Law Enforcement 
Officers Memorial, dedicated on October 15, 
1991, is the national monument to honor 
those law enforcement officers who have died 
in the line of duty; 
Whereas Peace Officers Memorial Day, 
2022, honors the 576 law enforcement officers 
killed in the line of duty during 2021, includ-

HONORING ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ TAYLOR 
FOR 
HIS 
DEDICATED 
PUBLIC 
SERVICE 
HON. JERRY McNERNEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Rob-
ert ‘‘Bob’’ Taylor for his decades of dedicated 
public service to our community. This year, 
Bob will retire after serving as Mayor of the 
City of Brentwood for the last fourteen years— 
longer than any other Mayor in Brentwood’s 
history. 
Bob Taylor was first elected to the Brent-
wood City Council in 2004 and served as a 
Councilmember for two years until he was 
elected Mayor in 2006. As Mayor, Bob has 
shown his unwavering commitment to our 
community and is well known for his vibrant 
personality and dedication to the success of 
the City of Brentwood and its residents. Bob 
has also been instrumental in ensuring the 
safety of the community-at-large through his 
service on transportation committees such as 
the Highway 4 Bypass Authority. In addition to 
this and other committees, he serves on nu-
merous boards and commissions, making sure 
to never miss an opportunity that could im-
prove the quality of life for his constituents. 
Prior to becoming Mayor, Bob served twelve 
years on the Liberty Union High School Dis-
trict Board of Trustees. He has been a busi-
nessman and a farmer, and was Past Presi-
dent of Harvest Time Brentwood, a local non- 
profit farming organization. He is an active 
community member, participating in Brent-
wood Chamber of Commerce events, among 
many other community activities. Bob has 
made invaluable contributions to our commu-
nity, and his leadership has made a positive 
impact on countless individuals and families. 
Bob is also a veteran who has served our 
great nation as a member of the United States 
Navy during the Vietnam era. He currently 
acts as the Brentwood City Council’s liaison to 
various veterans’ groups, demonstrating his 
steadfast 
commitment 
to 
his 
fellow 
servicemembers and our nation’s veterans. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and 
recognizing Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Taylor. His distin-
guished public service is unparalleled and is 
as an example to us all.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
CAPTAIN ROBERT S. KOBER 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Captain Robert S. Kober of 
the Dearborn Fire Department on the occasion 
of his retirement. His honorable twenty-five 
years of service to our community is worthy of 
commendation. 
A native of Dearborn and a graduate of 
Edsel Ford High School, Captain Kober began 
his career at the Dearborn Fire Department in 
April 1997, beginning as a Firefighter 1. In 
2003, he was promoted to Firefighter 2 and 
then to the role of Fire Engineer in 2006. Due 
to his excellence in service, he was named 
Lieutenant in 2012 and then Captain in 2017. 
Known for his bravery and leadership, he re-
ceived the Medal of Valor in 2014. He is also 
the recipient of several awards, including nu-
merous Fire Chief Unit Commendations and 
Meritorious Company Commendations. 
Involved in the Dearborn community, Cap-
tain Kober participates in the annual Dearborn 
Firefighter Burn Drive and other community 
events, such as the 9/11 memorial services 
and Santa at the Firehouse. Caring deeply 
about public service and helping those in 
need, he has supported his fellow firefighters 
and other officers through activism at the 
Michigan State Capitol. When not at the fire 
station, he can be found spending time cheer-
ing on his kids at sports events. He resides in 
Dearborn, Michigan with his family. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Captain Robert S. Kober for a 
career of exemplary service to the Dearborn 
Fire Department. I join with Captain Kober’s 
family, friends, and colleagues in extending 
my gratitude to him for his honorable service 
in protecting our community and thank him for 
his role in serving the people of the City of 
Dearborn for the past twenty-five years. We 
wish him the best in retirement.

MARKING 
INTERNATIONAL 
DAY 
AGAINST 
HOMOPHOBIA, 
BIPHOBIA, AND TRANSPHOBIA 
HON. DAVID N. CICILLINE 
OF RHODE ISLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to show my united and unwavering sup-
port of LGBTQI+ people across the globe and 
their right to live their lives openly, free from 
discrimination, harassment, and violence. 
Yesterday, May 17th, we marked the Inter-
national Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia 
and Transphobia. I had hoped that by 2022, 
we would no longer need this day to draw at-
tention to the violence and discrimination ex-
perienced by LGBTQI+ people around the 
world. 
In too many countries, it is still a crime to be 
LGBTQI+. At least 68 countries have laws that 
criminalize same-sex sexual relations between 
consenting adults. In six of those countries, 
people can be sentenced to death for same- 
sex sexual relations. And at least nine coun-
tries have laws criminalizing forms of gender 
expression that target the transgender com-
munity. 
In countries like Russia, LGBTQI+ people 
are targeted for discrimination. And under 
Putin’s regime, they also have seen their abil-
ity to organize and fight for their rights cur-
tailed. 
In countries like Chechnya, LGBTQI+ peo-
ple are subjected to state-sanctioned torture 
and violence, including murder. 
The United States has a moral obligation to 
address these human rights abuses against 
LGBTQI+ people. That is why the House 
passed—with a bipartisan vote—the Global 
Respect Act, legislation I authored to deny 
visas to those who commit human rights 
abuses against LGBTQI+ people abroad. This 
legislation will also codify reporting require-
ments on these issues in the State Depart-
ment’s annual Human Rights Report. The 
Senate now needs to send it to the Presi-
dent’s desk. 
We need to equip our government with the 
tools it needs to help secure LGBTQI+ equal-
ity and protect the rights of LGBTQI+ people 
here at home and abroad. 
We are fortunate to have strong allies in the 
White House in President Biden and Vice 
President Harris. Their administration has stat-
ed unequivocally that it is the policy of the 
United States to ‘‘pursue an end to violence 
and discrimination on the basis of sexual ori-
entation, gender identity or expression, or sex 
characteristics.’’ They have done important 
work to advance those goals and have also 
taken meaningful action to ensure we are 
leading by example here at home as well. 
In his State of the Union Address, President 
Biden specifically asked us, this Congress, to 
send him the Equality Act for his signature. 
The Equality Act will, finally, explicitly pro-
hibit LGBTQI+ discrimination in key areas of 
our everyday lives—including employment, 
housing, public accommodations,’’ education, 
federally-funded programs, credit, and jury se-
lection. 
The House passed this bill, and I am now 
asking the Senate to do the same. 
As we espouse values of equality abroad, 
we need to look inwardly too. 
In too many states, LGBTQI+ people, espe-
cially trans youth, have been under attack. 
More than a dozen anti-LGBTQI+ bills have 
been signed into law in the states this year. 
These laws are discriminatory, and cruel, and 
are doing real harm to the LGBTQI+ commu-
nity. 
The Trevor Project recently published a 
study which found that in the past year 45 per-
cent of LGBTQ+ children seriously considered 
attempting suicide. 
Stop for a minute and take that in. Almost 
one out of every two LGBTQ+ children seri-
ously thought about taking their own life. If 
that statistic was the same for your child, 
would you act? 
The Trevor Project also found that 1 in 5 
transgender and nonbinary children attempted 
suicide and 60 percent of LGBTQ+ youth who 
wanted mental health care couldn’t access it. 
We must do better. And for us in Congress, 
that means strengthening protections for the 
LGBTQI+ community here at home and 
abroad. It means taking this meaningful action

to show these children, and all LGBTQI+ peo-
ple that they are not alone. 
And so I would like to thank the LGBTQI+ 
activists across the world. 
Their work is so important. We know how 
difficult it can be to fight for LGBTQl+ equality, 
especially in countries where it is a crime to 
simply be yourself. The work that they are 
doing will have a positive impact for genera-
tions. They are on the right side of history, 
and we will use every lever of the federal gov-
ernment to support them and the fight for 
global equality.

COMMEMORATING NATIONAL 
POLICE WEEK 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
member of the Law Enforcement Caucus and 
the 
Chairwoman 
of 
the 
Judiciary 
Sub-
committee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Se-
curity, and Investigations, I rise to commemo-
rate Police Week, which runs from May 16 
through May 22. 
It is essential that we honor our fallen he-
roes each year who gave their lives in service 
to their communities. 
The National Law Enforcement Officers Me-
morial is the nation’s monument to law en-
forcement officers who have died in the line of 
duty. 
Dedicated on October 15, 1991, the Memo-
rial honors federal, state, and local law en-
forcement officers who have made the ulti-
mate sacrifice for the safety and protection of 
our nation and its people. 
Nearly 23,000 officers have been killed in 
the line of duty throughout U.S. history, dating 
back to the first known death in 1791. 
According to the National Law Enforcement 
Officers Memorial Fund, 458 federal, state, 
tribal, and local law enforcement officers died 
in the line-of-duty in 2021. 
In 2021, Texas experienced the largest 
number of law enforcement officer fatalities of 
all U.S. states with 84 line-of-duty deaths. 
Today there are more than 900,000 law en-
forcement personnel serving the people of our 
country, the highest amount ever. 
About 12 percent of them are female. 
These brave men and women risk their lives 
to keep the peace and keep us safe but they 
are too often taken by the violence they are 
working to prevent. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent 
the people of the 18th Congressional District 
of Texas in paying tribute to the 220 fallen he-
roes who will join the gallant men and women 
who previously gave the last full measure of 
devotion to the communities they took an oath 
to protect and serve. 
Among the fallen Texan law enforcement of-
ficers are those who served the people of 
Houston and Harris County, including: 
Richard Anthony Sepolio Sr., Harris County, 
Texas, District Attorney’s Office, End of 
Watch: 1/13/2021. 
Kareem Anthony Atkins, Harris County, 
Texas, Constable’s Office, Precinct 4, End of 
Watch: 10/16/2021. 
Tomas Infante Sr., Harris County, Texas, 
Constable’s Office, Precinct 6, End of Watch: 
8/22/2021. 
Joshua James Sieman, Harris County, 
Texas, Sheriff’s Office, End of Watch: 10/21/ 
2021. 
Shaun Christopher Waters, Harris County, 
Texas, Sheriff’s Office, End of Watch: 8/1/ 
2021. 
Alexander David Gwosdz, Harris County, 
Texas, Sheriff’s Office, End of Watch: 4/22/ 
2021. 
Robert Perez, Harris County, Texas, Sher-
iff’s Office, End of Watch: 2/2/2021. 
William John Jeffrey, Houston, Texas, Po-
lice Department, End of Watch: 9/20/2021. 
John David Wilbanks, Houston, Texas, Po-
lice Department, End of Watch: 10/13/2021. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in memory of the 
220 officers whose names will be added to the 
National Peace Officers Memorial Wall of 
Honor.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
PATRICIA 
PERE´ Z— 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Patricia Pere´z 
of Elysian Valley, a unique neighborhood of 
Los Angeles, California. 
Born and raised in Los Angeles, with long-
time family roots in the city, Patricia Pere´z’s 
passion and life has been about art. In her 
youth, she learned about pottery on the La-
guna Pueblo reservation in New Mexico, and 
while in high school, she had the opportunity 
to participate in art classes at a renowned 
Frank Lloyd Wright home in Los Angeles. 
In the early 1970’s, Patricia taught children 
at Self Help Graphics & Art, an art studio at 
the intersection of arts practice and social jus-
tice dedicated to fostering the creation and ad-
vancement of art works by Chicana/o and 
Latinx artists, and a catalyst for cultural tradi-
tions, preservation, and restoration through the 
arts. Ms. Pere´z attended Los Angeles City 
College, the Pacific Institute of Commercial 
Art, and the Otis Art Institute of Los Angeles 
County, now known as the Otis College of Art 
and Design, from which she graduated in 
1976 with a Bachelor of Arts in Painting and 
a minor in sculpture, Patricia’s art training also 
included studying art history abroad in France 
and Spain. In addition to creating her own art, 
she also worked with Milton Williams Catering 
and high-end interior designers. 
Patricia is a multi-medium artist, working in 
acrylics, ink washes, pencils, crayons, fabrics, 
recycled materials, and earth. She has been a 
long-time volunteer judge for the 28th Con-
gressional District Art Competition and is an 
active contributor in her distinctive Los Ange-
les community known as Elysian Valley or 
‘‘Frogtown.’’ Ms. Pere´z is Vice President of the 
Elysian Valley Arts Collective and opens up 
her home as a gallery during the annual 
Frogtown Artwalk. Teaching art classes in her 
community brings her great joy, as, in her 
words, she has lived her life through the arts 
and enjoys sharing it with others. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Patricia 
Pere´z.

SCHOOL’S 
MOCK 
TRIAL 
TEAM 
HON. ANDY BARR 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the members and coaches of the Montgomery 
County High School Mock Trial Team, winners 
of the National High School Mock Trial Cham-
pionship. 
The students defeated over 40 state cham-
pion high school debate teams to capture the 
title on May 7, 2022 in Kalamazoo, Michigan. 
These students worked for months in prepara-
tion for this challenging competition. Mock 
Trial provides students with the opportunity to 
improve critical thinking and public speaking 
skills, to gain exposure to the legal system, 
and to compete at the highest level. Over the 
years, Montgomery County High School has 
won 14 state titles. 
Special congratulations are in order for 
Bryce Charles, who was named a National 
Top-10 Witness, and Ollie Fegenbush, a Na-
tional Top 10 Attorney. 
Thank you to coaches Ryan Allison, Jamie 
Allison, and Elizabeth Davis for their leader-
ship and for the opportunity they provide for 
the students. Thank you also to the parents 
and the entire Montgomery County community 
for their support and encouragement. Winning 
against much larger schools from across this 
Nation brings a great deal of pride and hope 
to all in the community. 
As a former debate team member myself, I 
appreciate the dedication and hard work of 
these students. They have learned skills that 
will serve them well as adults and have made 
memories that will last a lifetime. I commend 
them for their wonderful accomplishment as 
National Champions.

HONORING BUILDING SAFETY 
MONTH 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
mark the beginning of Building Safety Month 
and to recognize the more than 64,000 mem-
bers of the International Code Council (ICC) 
who have dedicated their livelihoods to ensur-
ing public safety throughout the built environ-
ment—whether our homes, offices, schools, 
houses of worship, et cetera. 
Building Safety Month is sponsored by the 
International Code Council and its partners to 
remind the public about the professionals who 
ensure buildings are safe, resilient, efficient, 
and livable. The Code Council brings together 
local, state, and federal as well as stake-
holders from the private sector to develop 
model codes and standards that protect the 
occupants of the buildings in which we live, 
work, and play. Those standards are then im-
plemented year-round by building safety offi-
cials, the fire service, architects, engineers, 
plumbers, and laborers to ensure the safe 
construction and maintenance of buildings. 
This year’s Building Safety Month theme is 
‘‘Building Codes in Action’’ which encourages 
all of us to raise awareness of the importance 
of safe and resilient construction, fire preven-
tion, sanitation, disaster mitigation, and inno-
vative technologies in the construction indus-
try. 
Last month, the Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency (FEMA) released its Building 
Codes Strategy, which exemplifies this year’s 
theme by recognizing that community adoption 
and enforcement of hazard-resistant building 
codes and standards ‘‘lays the foundation for 
increased resilience’’ and creates a ‘‘culture of 
preparedness by making mitigation a standard 
practice.’’ 
In late 2020 FEMA released a study, titled 
‘‘Building Codes Saves’’, which found that im-
plementing modem building codes could save 
$600 billion in disaster spending by 2060. 
FEMA further confirmed a prior report by the 
National Institute of Building Sciences that 
found that adopting modem codes provides 
$11 in mitigation savings for every $1 in-
vested. 
With natural disasters increasing in fre-
quency and severity, building codes and 
standards include important safeguards to pro-
tect the public from snow and ice storms, hur-
ricanes, and earthquakes. We thank those 
who implement and enforce building codes for 
protecting lives, property, businesses, and 
communities. 
Development, adoption, and implementation 
of up-to-date codes and standards has en-
abled Virginia through its 2018 Uniform State-
wide Building Code to ensure its codes assure 
building safety and waste the least energy in 
the Southeastern United States. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking 
International Code Council Board President 
Cindy Davis—a constituent I represent, as well 
as ICC’s Chief Executive Officer Dominic 
Sims, the International Code Council leader-
ship, and ICC’s Members and staff as they 
recognize Building Safety Month.

HONORING THANG DO 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my sincere condolences to 
the family of Thang Do, who passed away on 
May 8, 2022. He has been an important part 
of our community and will be greatly missed. 
Thang Do fled Vietnam in 1975, as a ref-
ugee, and supported himself through college, 
where he earned his degree in architecture 
from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Recruited 
after graduation by Aedis Architects, a San 
Jose-based architectural firm, Thang Do quick-
ly advanced within the company and has led 
it for the past 30 years. His advocacy for sus-
tainable design practices and focus on urban 
design issues, led him to be designated an 
American Institute of Architects Fellow, an 
honor held by less than four percent of their 
members. As lead architect of the recently- 
completed Vietnamese American Service Cen-
ter in San Jose, he received the Community 
Impact Award from the Silicon Valley Business 
Journal. 
A notable steward of revitalizing downtown 
San Jose and the SoFa district, Thang Do 
dedicated his time as a Chair of the San Jose 
Planning Commission, a member of the San 
Jose Architectural Review Committee, and a 
board member of the San Francisco Bay Area 
Planning and Urban Research Association. He 
also volunteered as a board member to the 
San Jose Museum of Art and the Housing 
Trust of Silicon Valley. 
Thang Do was heavily involved as a com-
munity activist who helped uplift the Viet-
namese community and culture. With his ad-
vocacy work and bilingual skills, he supported 
nationwide policy education by helping found 
the Progressive Vietnamese American Organi-
zation (PIVOT). The organization has been 
recognized nationally for helping increase civic 
engagement and fighting misinformation to Vi-
etnamese residents. 
I have been honored to see his architectural 
work firsthand throughout San Jose and am 
thankful for his commitment and service to the 
community. Thang Do will be greatly missed. 
Please join me in honoring him and sharing 
my deep condolences with his family and our 
community that mourns his loss.

28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Mariam 
Barnes of La Crescenta, California. 
Born and raised in La Crescenta as a first- 
generation Californian in her Egyptian family, 
Mariam credits her top-notch education in the 
Glendale Unified School District for setting the 
base for her current career success and has 
devoted her spare time to giving back to the 
La Crescenta community. 
Mariam served on the Crescenta Valley 
Town Council for two terms, where she was 
primarily focused on the youth in the commu-
nity and worked to create opportunities for 
them to explore entrepreneurship. She helped 
launch the Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow (EOT) 
program which gives students as young as 7th 
grade a booth to sell their products at the 
Montrose Harvest Market. EOT went from 
being an annual event to a quarterly event to 
encourage students to think about their career 
goals and polish their entrepreneurial skills. 
Ms. Barnes has also participated in drug 
awareness efforts in the local community to 
bring solutions to individuals who struggle with 
addiction or have a family member who strug-
gles with addiction. 
As a manager for a global recruiting team in 
the video game industry, Ms. Barnes under-
stands the skills necessary to achieve suc-
cess, and is deeply aware of the importance 
of self-confidence and the role it plays in 
shaping peoples’ lives and careers. She has 
volunteered as a mentor to many young 
women who struggle to find their confidence 
and helps them bridge the gap between ability 
and confidence. Ms. Barnes has also sup-
ported youth by planning workshops that focus 
on building self-esteem, providing information 
on vocational schools, coaching them on their 
interview skills, and helping students with their 
college applications. 
In addition to her volunteer efforts and ca-
reer, Mariam is a wife and mother of twin girls. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Mariam 
Barnes.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
FIRE ENGINEER LORI BARCH 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Fire Engineer Lori Barch of 
Livonia, Michigan on the occasion of her re-
tirement from the Dearborn Fire Department. 
Her honorable twenty-five years of service to 
our community are worthy of commendation. 
Fire Engineer Barch began her career at the 
Dearborn Fire Department in May 1997, be-
ginning as a Firefighter 1. In 2003, she was 
promoted to Firefighter 2 and then to the role 
of Fire Engineer in 2006. She is the recipient 
of numerous awards, including the Meritorious 
Service Award, the Fire Chief Company Cita-
tion, the Meritorious Company Commendation, 
two Departmental Commendations, and sev-
eral Safe Driving Awards and Certifications of 
Special Recognition. 
Fire Engineer Barch is deeply involved in 
the Dearborn community, participating in the 
annual Dearborn Firefighter Bum Drive and 
Safety Town, which teaches children safety 
lessons on fire, traffic, guns, and other com-
mon dangers. Always there to lend a hand, 
Fire Engineer Barch is known by her peers to 
be kind and caring, as shown by her work 
benefitting the community’s children and ani-
mals. Beyond her work at the fire department, 
she is an active member of Timothy Lutheran 
Church located in Livonia, Michigan. She re-
sides in Livonia with her husband Jeff, daugh-
ter Riley, and their beloved pets. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Fire Engineer Lori Barch for a 
career of exemplary service to the Dearborn 
Fire Department. I join with Fire Engineer 
Barch’s family, friends, and colleagues in ex-
tending my gratitude to her for her honorable 
service in protecting our community and thank 
her for her role in serving the people of the

We wish her the best in retirement.

HONORING MERRIE INDERFURTH 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to acknowledge the lifetime of public service of 
Meredith (‘‘Merrie’’) Roosa Inderfurth. After 
graduating from Brown University, Merrie 
came to Washington to earn an MPA at 
George Washington University and never left. 
Merrie joined the congressional staff of Rep. 
Lindy Boggs, whose late husband, then-Major-
ity Leader Hale Boggs led the creation of the 
National Flood Insurance Program, cementing 
Merrie’s interest in flood management. 
During her 15 years with Rep. Boggs, 
Merrie took time to have two extraordinary 
daughters, both now in public service; one is 
my Deputy Chief of Staff and essential to my 
office, and her sister is a respected prosecutor 
in nearby Montgomery County, Maryland. Her 
stepdaughter is a highly qualified medical pro-
fessional. 
Merrie then returned to public life and made 
use of her flood pedigree serving for almost 
30 years as the Washington Liaison for the 
Association of State Flood Plain Managers 
and National Flood Association. 
In 2007, she was the recipient of the Asso-
ciation’s highest honor, the Goddard-White 
Award ‘For Outstanding Leadership and Guid-
ance on National Flood Policy Issues’. 
Madam Speaker, it is impossible to count 
how many Members of Congress have bene-
fited from Merrie’s thoughtful, consistent coun-
sel. I want to express sincere appreciation for 
the career and public service of my friend 
Merrie Inderfurth. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. 
EDWARD ‘‘PEB’’ JACKSON 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Edward ‘‘Peb’’ Jack-
son, a man full of passion and love for people 
and God’s kingdom. 
Peb was born May 11, 1944, in Lawrence, 
Kansas, to Dr. Sheldon and Irene Jackson. He 
grew up with his twin brother and younger sis-
ter in nearby Haviland, Kansas. 
Peb’s family moved to the Los Angeles area 
in 1964, where Peb attended Azusa Pacific 
University in Azusa, CA, majoring in History. 
He furthered his studies at Claremont College 
in Claremont, CA, where he was introduced to 
Sharon (Osell), in 1967. The two married (in 
1971) and lived in Southern California for 25 
years, before moving to Colorado Springs in 
1991. 
After graduating, Peb was invited by Azusa 
Pacific University to serve as Alumni Director 
and then Director of Admissions and Financial 
Aid. Subsequently, he served as an executive 
at the Spartan Oil Company and as Vice 
President at J.D. Bradley Company. He also 
served as a founding board member and Sen-
ior Vice President for Focus on the Family, 
Senior Vice President of Public Affairs for 
Young Life, Executive Vice President for Gen-
erous Giving, and Vice President of Public Af-
fairs with Rick Warren and Purpose Driven 
Ministries. He worked in Washington, D.C. 
during multiple administrations, including stra-
tegic involvement with the White House, Pen-
tagon, Congress and various other agencies 
regarding family issues. 
Peb exemplified the very definition of devo-
tion in his lifelong romance with Sharon. To-
gether, they remained intentional and stead-
fast in cultivating a marriage that thrived and 
flourished. Peb inspired thousands through his 
robust faith, humble leadership, and genuine 
affection for others. He loved people and 
never knew a stranger. Known as ‘‘the con-
nector,’’ he proved to be instrumental in opti-
mizing opportunities and developing Godly 
leaders in business, government, and the en-
tertainment industry. 
It was no secret that Peb has something 
special and had much to offer the world. Many 
years ago, a group of friends generously 
helped him transition to independent con-
sulting to maximize on his natural gift of rela-
tionship building. Their thought was, ‘‘Let’s just 
let Peb be Peb!’’ In this capacity, Peb’s talent 
for connecting people left lasting impacts 
worldwide in ministry, business, and the non-
profit sector. 
Throughout his life, Peb partnered with or-
ganizations such as CURE International, 
Focus on the Family, Museum of the Bible, 
Mission Increase, and many more. During his 
life, Peb co-authored two books: A Dangerous 
Faith and Danger Calling, among many other 
collaborations, including the documentary from 
Rwanda, Rising From Ashes. 
For the past 30 years, Peb and Sharon 
hosted a weekly Bible study in their home. 
Peb led a weekly men’s Bible study at their 
home for the past 20 years, as well. Addition-
ally, the couple coordinated the Sunday morn-
ing worship services at the Broadmoor Hotel’s 
Pauline Chapel for the past decade.

May 18, 2022 
Peb lived his life with extraordinary faith, 
finding strength and guidance by reading 
Scripture and praying early each morning. In 
the Gospel of Matthew, we hear, ‘‘But the 
greatest among you shall be your servant.’’ 
Peb exemplified this verse throughout his life. 
He walked with Jesus in joyful obedience and 
contagious enthusiasm. One can only imagine 
the glorious reunion Peb had when he passed 
from his earthly life to everlasting life with his 
Savior in the kingdom of heaven on May 2, 
2022. 
Peb Jackson will be remembered as a lov-
ing husband, a devoted servant-leader, an in-
spiring mentor, a winsome connector of peo-
ple, and a dear friend to many. He is survived 
by his wife of nearly 52 years, Sharon, brother 
Shel (Ginger), sister Marlyn Oliver (Don), 
brother-in-law Bob Osell (Darlene), sister-in- 
law Becky Osell, nieces, nephews, God-chil-
dren, and many friends. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in Congress join me in honoring my friend and 
brother in Christ, Edward ‘‘Peb’’ Jackson. Peb 
lived his life with a zeal that could move 
mountains and passion for the Lord that was 
inimitable. Because of his faithful spirit and 
heart for people, our world is a better place. 
Peb will be greatly missed, but fondly re-
membered by all who knew him.

TRIBUTE TO STANDOLYN ROBERT-
SON—28TH CONGRESSIONAL DIS-
TRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Standolyn 
Robertson of Los Feliz, a unique neighbor-
hood of Los Angeles, California. 
Ms. Robertson attended the University of 
Massachusetts Lowell, where she earned a 
Bachelor of Arts in Education, and studied In-
terior Design Technology at Seminole State 
College of Florida. She returned to Massachu-
setts following years of entrepreneurship and 
employment in Florida and started her orga-
nizing career. 
A 
professional 
organizer 
and 
coach, 
Standolyn founded an organizing service in 
2000 called Things In Place, which is now 
based in Los Angeles where she currently 
lives. By merging warmth and wisdom with 
practical concepts and tactics, she helps indi-
viduals take back control of their values, lives, 
and happiness. 
Since 2012, when Standolyn relocated from 
Boston to Los Angeles with her husband, 
Jamie, she has been charmed by Los Feliz, 
has grown to value and love its one-of-a-kind 
character, and has embraced community in-
volvement. She has served in several roles 
within the Los Feliz Improvement Association 
and presently serves as a Greek Theatre Ad-
visory Committee board member. 
Over the past ten years, Ms. Robertson has 
given her time, advocacy skills, or expertise as 
a champion of a wide array of Los Angeles 
based community initiatives such as AIDS/ 
LifeCycle, Homeboy Industries, and African 
Americans for LA Opera. Further, Standolyn is 
involved in local efforts to improve the LA 
River and Griffith Park and assists individuals 
experiencing homelessness. 
Standolyn is the author of ‘‘Managing Client 
Expectations: A Guide for Organizing Profes-
sionals’’. She enjoys quilting, painting, attend-
ing storytelling performances, as well as hiking 
and camping with her husband. She is the 
proud mother of two adult sons who reside in 
Boulder and Seattle. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Standolyn 
Robertson.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CO-
ORDINATOR BRADLEY SMITH 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Emergency Management 
Coordinator Bradley Smith of the Dearborn 
Fire Department on the occasion of his retire-
ment. His honorable twenty-five years of serv-
ice to our community is worthy of commenda-
tion. 
A graduate of Annapolis High School in 
Dearborn Heights and the Eastern Michigan 
University School of Staff and Command, Co-
ordinator Smith began his career at the Dear-
born Fire Department in July 1997, beginning 
as a Firefighter 1. In July 2003, he was pro-
moted to Firefighter 2 and then to the role of 
Fire Engineer in 2005. Due to his excellence 
in service, he was named Emergency Man-
agement Coordinator in 2008. He is also the 
recipient of several awards, including two Fire 
Chief Life Saving Awards, the Meritorious 
Service Award, and numerous Certificates of 
Special Recognition. 
Coordinator Smith was responsible for iden-
tifying and analyzing potential hazards that the 
City of Dearborn could face, including man- 
made and natural disasters. He has ensured 
that the city has emergency plans and safety 
procedures in place, helping prepare residents 
for when disaster strikes. Beyond that, he has 
worked to incorporate special concerns of 
those with disabilities and differing religious 
beliefs into those plans. Known for his leader-
ship, kindness, and willingness to help those 
in need, Coordinator Smith is a friend and 
mentor to many. Despite all the work he has 
done to keep our community safe, he still has 
time to teach karate at PKSA in Flat Rock. An 
active member of his church, he resides in 
Carleton, Michigan with his wife Kelly and their 
children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Emergency Management Co-
ordinator Bradley Smith for a career of exem-
plary service to the Dearborn Fire Department. 
I join with Coordinator Smith’s family, friends, 
and colleagues in extending my gratitude to 
him for his honorable service in protecting our 
community and thank him for his role in serv-
ing the people of the City of Dearborn for the 
past twenty-five years. We wish him the best 
in retirement.

HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Karen Straffon of Clay 
Township for her commitment and service to 
Michigan’s veterans and their families. 
Karen’s commitment to honoring our bravest 
citizens is extensive. Last year, Karen com-
pleted a longtime project to erect a Gold Star 
Family Monument in Clinton Township, which 
honored the families of servicemen and 
women who gave their lives to protect our 
great nation. Karen selflessly dedicated hours 
of her time to forming a committee, fund-
raising, researching, traveling and gaining the 
support of the Hershel Woody Williams Medal 
of Honor Foundation to establish this com-
memorative monument. 
Karen has also served the families of vet-
erans in her community by overseeing the 
Wreaths Across America program every year 
at Resurrection Cemetery in Clinton Township. 
She is also skilled in quilt making, and many 
of her quilts are donated for fundraising events 
aimed at veterans’ programs. 
The former Veteran of the Year for St. Clair 
County, Don Callaway, commended Karen’s 
charitable efforts by saying, she truly exempli-
fies ‘‘leave no one behind.’’ It is an honor to 
recognize and sincerely thank Karen Straffon 
for her years of humble service to veterans 
and their families, I hope Karen knows the im-
pact her efforts have had on the veterans, 
their families and the overall community.

labor movement for the past 12 years, head-
ing up the Northwest Oregon Labor Council. 
This is an important forum for union members 
to come together, plan, and mobilize important 
support. 
Bob has helped keep those communications 
on an even keel. He provided a welcoming 
forum for friends of labor to connect with the 
varied and diverse membership of the council. 
I often saw Bob on the frontlines of action; on 
a picket line, for instance, to rally and encour-
age the troops. 
Throughout his tenure, Bob has continued 
to be a positive and productive force. He is 
part of the glue that keeps our local labor 
movement together. 
Bob will be greatly missed as he transitions 
into the next stage of his career, hopefully at 
a somewhat more leisurely pace. We deeply 
appreciate his leadership, his friendship, and 
being such a decent human being.

RECOGNIZING MR. ROBERT STAIB 
OF 
TEXAS’ 
THIRD 
CONGRES-
SIONAL DISTRICT ACADEMY SE-
LECTION BOARD 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor those members of 
Texas’ Third Congressional District’s Academy 
Selection Board whose longtime service to 
Texas and the U.S. Service Academies is to 
be commended. 
These individuals exemplify the time hon-
ored qualities of patriotism, service before self, 
and bold leadership which in turn have en-
abled them to assist in seeking out our next 
generation of servant leaders qualified to lead 
our nation as military officers in training. Not 
only have these patriots worn the uniform in 
defense of America, following their time in 
service they have chosen to enrich their com-
munities, most notably through their service on 
this Board. One such patriot is Mr. Robert 
‘‘Bob’’ Staib. 
A 1962 graduate of the United States Air 
Force Academy, Robert Staib, earned a Bach-
elor of Science in Engineering and was a top 
student at the Academy. During his time at 
USAFA, Bob was a commander of one of the 
24 cadet squadrons on campus, served on the 
Honor Committee, and trained on the new su-
personic T–38 trainer. 
His military career would carry him and his 
family to multiple domestic and international 
assignments. Impressively, Staib undertook 
329 missions as a fighter pilot in Vietnam, 
earning him numerous awards for bravery and 
valor. 
Upon his return to civilian life, Bob worked 
as a sales engineer in the Midwest. Along the 
way he earned an MBA in Marketing and Fi-
nance from Case Western Reserve prior to re-
locating to Dallas in 1977 with Mitsubishi Air-
craft. Bob held management positions with 
several companies including Cessna and 
Raytheon, and later owned a small general 
management consulting firm. Prior to his re-
tirement, Bob was a Senior Vice President of 
NetJets. 
Following his move to Dallas, Bob found 
new ways to pour into his community including 
his work as a founding member of the Prince 
of Peace Catholic Community in Plano. Fol-
lowing a four and half year academic program, 
Bob was ordained a Deacon of the Roman 
Catholic Diocese of Dallas. 
Bob and his wife, Marianne, were married 
for 40 years prior to her return to the Lord. To-
gether they were blessed with three daughters 
and a son. Today that blessing has expanded 
to 10 grandchildren and 6 great grandchildren. 
As the longest serving member on the Third 
District Board, Bob was first appointed by 
Congressman Jim Collins in 1980. Under Mr. 
Staib’s leadership, the Board developed the 
same selection process that is in use today 
and which has attributed to the success of the 
program. Bob served during the entire 28-year 
career of Congressman Sam Johnson, prior to 
assuming his current position on our board. A 
man of loyalty, principle, and steadfast com-
mitment, Bob Staib has made an indelible 
mark on this program, the countless students 
he has worked to nominate, and on those with 
whom he has served over the years.

Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Dr. Ramella 
Markarian of Glendale, California. 
Dr. 
Ramella 
Markarian 
is 
a 
skilled 
healthcare professional who has served as 
Vice President of Business Development at 
Adventist Health Glendale since 2012. During 
her tenure, she has played a significant role in 
leading the physician relations and recruitment 
efforts, advancing Adventist Health Glendale’s 
strategic growth and development, and over-
seeing various clinical and non-clinical depart-
ments. Since 2015, Dr. Markarian has helped 
organize and has participated in Adventist 
Health Glendale’s annual medical missions to 
Armenia, bringing dozens of physicians, clini-
cians, and surgeons together to provide sur-
geries and medical consults to many Arme-
nians living in Armenia and Artsakh. 
Dr. Markarian’s extraordinary efforts extend 
beyond her work at Adventist Health Glendale. 
In 2008, with the support of the Armenian 
American Medical Society’s Ladies Auxiliary, 
Ramella founded Glendale Healthy Woman, a 
program that provides free mammograms to 
uninsured and underinsured women in the 
community. In 2010, several community lead-
ers, including Ramella, founded the annual 
Glendale Health Festival which has been serv-
ing the healthcare needs of many under-
insured and uninsured people in Glendale and 
neighboring communities for over a decade. 
Ramella also served on the City of Glen-
dale’s Community Development Block Grant 
Advisory Committee for eight years where 
she, along with other committee members, de-
termined funding priorities. She also served as 
a member of the Los Angeles County Commu-
nity Prevention and Population Health Task 
Force, providing her expertise and knowledge 
in strategic direction for community health 
planning in Los Angeles County. Currently, Dr. 
Markarian serves on the boards of several or-
ganizations including the Armenian Bone Mar-
row Donor Registry and Glendale Police Foun-
dation. She also serves as a guest speaker at 
local high schools, colleges, and universities, 
where she avidly shares her expertise and 
knowledge to inspire youth. 
Dr. Markarian holds a bachelor’s degree in 
Business Administration and a master’s de-
gree in Healthcare Administration from Cali-
fornia State University, Los Angeles. She con-
tinued her education at the University of 
Southern California, where she received a 
doctorate in Organizational Change and Lead-
ership, with a focus on healthcare. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Dr. Ramella 
Markarian.

COMMEMORATING THE ANTON 
ART CENTER 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate the Anton Art 
Center of Mount Clemens, Michigan on its his-
toric building being designated as a place wor-
thy of preservation in the National Register of 
Historic Places. The building has served as a 
cherished and integrative resource in the 
Mount Clemens community. When the Art 
Center was first established in the historic 
Carnegie 
Library 
Building, 
three 
Mount 
Clemens 
Art 
Association 
members—Bea 
Wright, Gretchen Thompson, and Phyllis 
Wickens—set out to preserve the then Mount 
Clemens Public Library and save the historic 
building from demolition. 
In 1904, the Mount Clemens Library opened 
its doors to the public after a year of construc-
tion. This building is unique to the history of 
Mount Clemens, as it was one of approxi-
mately 2,500 libraries funded by Andrew Car-
negie throughout the world. The library drew 
hundreds of visitors coming to explore Mount 
Clemens’ famous mineral baths during the 
early 1900s. In 1963, the library was con-
verted to include three galleries, an art studio, 
a meeting area, a pottery studio, a kiln room, 
and offices. In 1969, the library was moved to 
a new building and the original building 
changed its primary role to a non-profit known 
as The Art Center. 
It is incredible to see how the Anton Art 
Center has created engaging programs for all 
ages centered around empowering those in-
volved in the arts. When local businessman 
Gebran Anton led a fundraising effort to ex-
pand the building in 2006, the Art Center was 
able to add a gift shop to support the work of 
local artists, increase gallery space, and in-
crease classroom space. As a cherished re-
source to Macomb County it is clear the mis-
sion of the Anton Art Center is alive and well 
today. 
In 2022, the Anton Art Center provides an 
open and welcoming atmosphere that brings

together a wide audience, instills support for 
the arts, and is a focal point for arts program-
ming and works toward inclusion, diversity, eq-
uity, and access in all they do. In Macomb 
County and throughout Southeastern Michi-
gan, the Anton Art Center continues to be a 
strong leader in advocating for local arts and 
artists. It is essential that we recognize the 
Anton Art Center for its long history and last-
ing contributions. The Anton Art Center also 
holds a deep personal significance to me, as 
my family and I have attended a number of 
programs there over the years. 
On behalf of Michigan’s 9th District, it is my 
honor to recognize the work of the Anton Art 
Center’s leaders, workers, and community 
members for their dedication and persever-
ance in promoting this historic building. Their 
work will ensure that future generations are 
able to visit the building and reflect on the rich 
history that makes Mount Clemens the won-
derful city it is today.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF 
PRESIDENT 
KATHLEEN 
‘CASEY’ CRABILL 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the career of President Kathleen 
‘Casey’ Crabill, who will retire following the 
2022 academic year after 9 years with Onon-
daga Community College and 45 years in 
higher 
education. 
A 
dedicated 
educator, 
throughout her career President Crabill dem-
onstrated a profound commitment to scholar-
ship. 
Originally from East Greenbush, New York, 
President Crabill graduated with a Bachelor’s 
of Arts in English from Skidmore College. 
Later, she earned a Master’s of Science in 
English as a Second Language and a Doc-
torate of Education in Curriculum and Instruc-
tion from the State University of New York at 
Albany. 
After finishing school, President Crabill 
began her career as an English teacher in 
1977. While teaching, she held several top 
posts at colleges across the country, including 
serving as division chair for Academic Devel-
opment and Learning Support at Dundalk 
Community College in Dundalk, Maryland, and 
as acting president and dean of Learning and 
Student Development at Quinebaug Valley 
Community College in Danielson, Connecticut. 
Later she served as president of the College 
of the Redwoods in Eureka, California, and as 
president of Raritan Valley Community College 
in North Branch, New Jersey. 
In 2013, President Crabill took the reins at 
Onondaga Community College, becoming its 
eighth president. During her tenure, President 
Crabill reconfigured Onondaga Community 
College’s degree and certificate programs into 
eight schools based on academic focus. This 
move greatly enhanced student collaboration. 
President Crabill also launched programs to 
assist underserved students, including the 
‘Box of Books’ program, which provides stu-
dents with books at a low, flat fee, and the 
‘OCC Advantage’ program, which allows stu-
dents from six local school districts to attend 
Onondaga Community College tuition-free. Im-
pressively, President Crabill also successfully 
shepherded the college through the unprece-
dented COVID–19 pandemic by overseeing 
the transition to virtual classes and creating 
new degree and certificate programs that re-
sponded to evolving industry demands. 
Over the years, I have also had the distinct 
pleasure of partnering with President Crabill. 
Together, we have worked to make higher 
education more accessible and affordable, 
brought greater awareness to cybersecurity 
threats, and improved the lives of local stu-
dents. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in recognizing the career 
of President Kathleen ‘Casey’ Crabill. I wish 
President Crabill the best in her retirement.

TRIBUTE TO JACKIE GOLDBERG— 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a champion for excellence in public 
education, The Honorable Jackie Goldberg of 
Echo Park, a unique neighborhood of Los An-
geles, California. 
Jackie, a native of Los Angeles, attended 
public schools including the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley, where she obtained her 
Bachelor of Arts and was a leader in the Free 
Speech Movement. She holds a Master of 
Arts in Teaching (History) from the University 
of Chicago and has several California teaching 
credentials. Ms. Goldberg’s professional life in 
the educational field began as a classroom 
teacher in Compton, where she taught for 
nearly two decades and specialized in read-
ing. 
Equipped with teaching experience and di-
rect understanding of the challenges of the 
Los Angeles public school system, Jackie was 
elected to the Los Angeles Unified School Dis-
trict (LAUSD) Board of Education in 1983, 
where she served two terms, serving as Presi-
dent from 1989 to 1991. Under her leadership, 
the board enhanced curriculums in reading, 
science and math and created a districtwide 
K–12 dual language education program. 
In 1993, Ms. Goldberg was elected to the 
Los Angeles City Council, where she was the

first openly gay city councilmember in Los An-
geles and was handily re-elected in 1997. Dur-
ing her tenure on the city council, she au-
thored the ‘‘living wage’’ ordinance that guar-
anteed a living wage and benefits to all em-
ployees working indirectly or directly for the 
City of Los Angeles. Her council legacy also 
included authorship of Domestic Partner bene-
fits for city employees and the creation of an 
afterschool program in central Los Angeles. In 
2000, Jackie was elected to the California 
State Assembly where she served for six 
years. She authored landmark legislation that 
granted 
Lesbian, 
Gay, 
Bisexual, 
and 
Transgender couples nearly all the responsibil-
ities and rights of marriage as well as state 
education funding that helped LAUSD build 
new schools. 
Returning to the LAUSD Board of Education 
in 2019 as the Member for the 5th District, 
Jackie currently serves as a Member of the 
Special Education Committee and as Chair of 
the Curriculum and Instruction Committee. Her 
current efforts are focused on upgrading read-
ing growth support for underachieving readers, 
and the upgrade of school facilities. 
Jackie and her longtime life-partner and 
wife, Sharon Stricker, live in Echo Park. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, The Honor-
able Jackie Goldberg.

RECOGNIZING MR. DARCY ANDER-
SON OF TEXAS’ THIRD CONGRES-
SIONAL DISTRICT ACADEMY SE-
LECTION BOARD 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor those members of 
Texas’ Third Congressional District’s Academy 
Selection Board whose longtime service to 
Texas and the U.S. Service Academies is to 
be commended. 
These individuals exemplify the time hon-
ored qualities of patriotism, service before self, 
and bold leadership which in turn have en-
abled them to assist in seeking out our next 
generation of servant leaders qualified to lead 
our nation as military officers in training. Not 
only have these patriots worn the uniform in 
defense of America, following their time in 
service they have chosen to enrich their com-
munities, most notably through their service on 
this Board. One such patriot is Mr. Darcy An-
derson. 
A 1978 graduate of the United States Mili-
tary Academy, Darcy completed five years of 
active duty service post-graduation in the U.S. 
Army, working in various capacities with com-
bat units of the U.S. Corps of Engineers. 
Anderson began his civilian career in 1983, 
joining Electronic Data Systems (EDS) where 
he worked in recruiting management. In 1987, 
he assumed project management responsibil-
ities for Hillwood Development Company’s real 
estate developments in Dallas, Austin, Atlanta, 
and Kansas City. From 1994 to 2000, Mr. An-
derson would serve in several roles at 
Hillwood including as Senior Vice President for 
Corporate Affairs and Chief Operating Officer, 
and as the President of Hillwood Urban where 
he oversaw the Victory project and the Amer-
ican Airlines Center development. In 2000, he 
joined Perot Systems Corporation as Chief 
People Officer and Vice President for Cor-
porate Support and led the company’s envi-
ronmental sustainability programs. Today, he 
continues his work as the Vice Chairman of 
Hillwood Management. 
Mr. Anderson’s extensive leadership in-
cludes serving as the Director of the West 
Point Society of North Texas, as a past Board 
Member of the West Point Association of 
Graduates, and as a Civilian Aide of the Sec-
retary of the Army for Texas. Additionally, 
Darcy is a member of the Board of Directors 
and Executive Committees for the Dallas Re-
gional Chamber of Commerce, the Board of 
Directors of the Dallas World Affairs Council, 
and has served as the Council’s past Vice 
Chairman. Anderson is also on the Board of 
Directors for the Boy Scouts of America Circle 
Ten District in Dallas, the Texas Co-Chairman 
for Spirit of America, a non-profit which raises 
funds for projects in support of U.S. Special 
forces deployed globally, and on the Board of 
‘‘Project Recover,’’ a non-profit that conducts 
underwater searches for WWII aircraft in the 
Pacific with the goal of repatriating the re-
mains of missing U.S. airmen. 
We are honored to recognize Darcy Ander-
son for his many efforts as a steadfast mem-
ber of this Board, a role which he bas held 
since 1994. Due to his invaluable work, count-
less young men and women have pursued 
their dream of attending a service academy 
and serving our nation, and we thank him for 
his willingness to shepherd our next genera-
tion of military leaders.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE WOMAN’S CLUB OF 
DUNNELLON, FL 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize a very special organization located 
in Dunnellon, FL; the southernmost portion of 
the Second Congressional District of Florida. 
The Woman’s Club of Dunnellon celebrated 
its 100th Anniversary on May 8, 2022. For 100 
years, they have diligently and gracefully 
served their community. 
With a focus on community betterment, this 
group has organized numerous events to pro-
mote fellowship and foster a brighter future for 
our youth. 
Their most recent fundraiser proceeds went 
towards local charities benefiting women and 
children and college scholarships for female 
Dunnellon High School graduates. 
I want to personally thank this incredible or-
ganization for its contributions to Marion Coun-
ty and Florida’s Second Congressional District 
as a whole. 
The Woman’s Club of Dunnellon is truly the 
‘‘Heart of the Community,’’ and I hope to see 
their outstanding work continue for years to 
come.

HON. LANCE GOODEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. GOODEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the leadership and commit-
ment of Dr. Coy Holcombe, who serves the 
fifth district of Texas as Superintendent of 
Eustace ISD. An essential figure and true 
asset to our community, Dr. Holcombe is retir-
ing after 21 years of service. 
Dr. Holcombe began his career as an edu-
cator and coach in 1984 before joining 
Eustace ISD in 2001. His brilliance for finance 
and his leadership skills have not gone unno-
ticed in the community, especially during the 
trials of COVID–19. Dr. Holcombe has suc-
cessfully maintained a healthy fund balance 
within the school district and navigated the 
community through student population growth 
over the years. His leadership during the pan-
demic was stellar in ensuring students’ edu-
cation, health, and well-being was properly 
monitored and prioritized. His dedication to 
every student within Eustace ISD will leave a 
legacy of excellence and compassion in the 
fifth district of Texas. 
I commend Dr. Coy Holcombe for his com-
mitment to the students and families of 
Eustace ISD and for 21 years of hard work 
and service as Superintendent.

2022 NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER 
HERITAGE MONTH ESSAY CON-
TEST WINNERS 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. 
SABLAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Aleia 
Hofschneider Santos, a senior at Mt. Carmel 
School, Mikhaela Paige Reyes Mendoza, an 
eighth grader also at Mt. Carmel School, are 
the winners of this year’s Asian and Pacific Is-
lander Heritage Month Essay Contest. I began 
this contest for middle school and high school 
students two years ago to give students in the 
Northern Mariana Islands, my district, the op-
portunity to showcase their writing skills and 
reflect on their unique experiences as Amer-
ican Asian and Pacific Islanders. The contest 
also is a way to celebrate Asian Pacific Amer-
ican Heritage Month. 
This year’s essay prompt encouraged stu-
dents to write about the issues facing the 
Asian and Pacific Islander community that are 
particularly important to them and to think 
about how they can inspire their community to 
action. 
I commend the 22 students from schools 
throughout the Northern Marianas who partici-
pated in this year’s essay contest. A volunteer 
panel of judges reviewed the essays and 
chose Ms. Mendoza and Ms. Santos as this 
year’s winners. In recognition of their achieve-
ment, I include in the RECORD the essays they 
wrote, where they will remain available to read 
in perpetuity.

MIKHAELA PAIGE REYES MENDOZA, MIDDLE 
SCHOOL WINNER, MOUNT CARMEL SCHOOL, 
8TH GRADE: THE PROBLEM WITH ‘‘LINGUISTIC 
RACISM’’ 
A problem that Asian Americans and Pa-
cific Islanders (AAPIs) face is linguistic rac-
ism. It is a big problem because English 
might not be their first language. Therefore, 
they would not get treated the same way as 
English native speakers. 
English is one of the main global languages 
spoken in many places. The English Lan-
guage is a dominant language in a lot of 
places such as in business, work, science, re-
search, school, government, and politics. The 
language is constantly evolving and adapting 
to new ways of saying different words and 
phrases. It’s transforming in different ways 
because there are people who speak the lan-
guage that use English in diverse ways. 
However, there are still people that strug-
gle with English. AAPIs struggle with 
English because it may not be their first lan-
guage. 
They 
are 
considered 
non-native 
English speakers. Nonnative English speak-
ers have this mindset that English is a high-
er language than their mother language. 
Which means that those who speak English, 
speak differently from what is considered 
‘‘the standard way of speaking.’’ These 
speakers can find themselves being judged 
and even penalized for the way their English 
sounds. 
In many countries, there are forms of 
English that can bring fewer benefits to a 
person. One example is African American 
English in the United States, the language is 
often 
misunderstood 
and 
discriminated 
against. On an international level, certain 
types of speakers face judgments based on 
any perceptions of their nationality, rather 
than their communication skills with people 
from that area. When English is spoken by 
Asians, Africans, or Middle Easterners, they 
are viewed as challenging and unpleasant to 
listen to as opposed to some Europeans such 
as French, Germans, and Italians when they 
speak English. 
Linguistic racism can lead to the depriva-
tion of education, employment, and health. 
AAPI with certain accents get openly har-
assed or excluded from specific opportunities 
in the workforce. For example, a Puerto 
Rican customer service worker was told by a 
customer that ‘‘his stupid accent makes me 
sick.’’ An Arabic bus driver in London had a 
manager who kept him out of many con-
ference calls. 
Of course, not every person is intentionally 
a linguistic racist. People who think that 
they are being inclusive are not aware of 
their judgements because of their ingrained 
biases. Yet, whatever the cause of these inci-
dents, people are still affected. With these 
kinds of ongoing and unrecognized situa-
tions, workers will be side-lined and ex-
cluded. 
In what way can we stop linguistic racism 
and have a more functional way of using the 
language to benefit native and nonnative 
speakers? The best way to combat linguistic 
racism is to continue to stay in school, learn 
about different cultures, and to be a role 
model to others. We all speak different lan-
guages and it is important to embrace the di-
versity that we have in our islands. We can 
also be digitally responsible and respectful 
in speaking to others online. 
Aleia Hofschneider Santos, High School 
Winner, Mount Carmel School, 12th Grade: 
Color 
Peach is the name of the crayon shade that 
my classmates always used in their portraits 
when I was in kindergarten at Chinook Ele-
mentary in Washington from 2008–2009. I was 
told that Tinian tanned skin was too dark to 
be using Peach, and that I should try using 
the dark brown crayon, called Chocolate. 
Peach was the color of the skin on the man 
I remember seeing through the windows of 
our first car in the states, as he screamed to 
my parents to ‘‘Go back to wherever the f*** 
you came from’’. Peach was the skin tone of 
all the cops who came, as they patted myself 
and my family down, searching for the weap-
on that the first Peach man had lied about 
us having over the phone. 
The choice that my parents made in rais-
ing our family in the states is better de-
scribed as a sacrifice, especially considering 
how we continued to be discriminated 
against beyond my Kindergarten days. Years 
later, at one of my older brother’s football 
games, a group of Peach toned boys told me 
to ‘‘Hop back over the border fence’’. After I 
told my Mom about it, she held my hand 
tightly as we wiped our tears on the way 
back to the crowd filled bleachers. When my 
older sister came to pick me up for an ap-
pointment during a school day in fourth 
grade, the Peach colored front desk sec-
retary told her ‘‘People like you don’t attend 
a school like this’’. I remember how it re-
minded me of how an after-school ice cream 
treat from my Dad turned into Peach colored 
Dairy Queen workers calling us ‘‘stupid 
Mexicans’’ through the drive through win-
dow. 
There are still many memories I cherish 
despite the challenges we faced during our 
stay in the U.S., but I will never forget the 
events of that fateful fall day, nor will my 
Mom or Dad. I will never forget the look on 
my parents’ faces as they were told to exit 
the vehicle, nor will I forget how scared I 
was when I saw them pointing guns at all of 
our faces. All of the fear and confusion from 
that day that we still feel years later is owed 
to one thing and one thing only: hatred. It 
was pure, unadulterated hatred that the 
Peach colored man felt toward not my fam-
ily, but the color of our skin that caused it 
to happen. Yet, the worst part about all of 
this is things like this continue to happen 
around the world—hate crimes and other 
acts 
of 
discrimination 
are 
committed 
against countless other Asian American and 
Pacific Islander families in countless other 
ways every single day. Yet, every time I re-
flect on the question of how we can combat 
the hate many AAPis face overseas, another 
question persists in my head: How can we 
stop the spread of hate out there if we strug-
gle to combat it here, in our very own home 
islands? 
After moving back to the CNMI in seventh 
grade, I quickly gained an understanding of 
the stereotypes that plague our own commu-
nity. With each race came a heinous general-
ization: all Chamorros were lazy, all Caro-
linians were uneducated, all Filipinos were 
judgmental, all Koreans were terrible driv-
ers, and the list, unfortunately, goes on. 
After hearing my classmate casually de-
scribe a person’s eyes as ‘‘chinky’’, I realized 
that while prejudice may be a catalyst for 
hate—the root of prejudice itself is igno-
rance. The ordeal led me to wonder how we, 
as AAPis, are expected to remain silent in 
the face of deafening hatred. 
While I may never be able to answer my 
own question, I can answer the question 
posed by this year’s prompt: I hope to inspire 
our community to take action against racial 
discrimination and acts of hate by taking 
three simple steps. First, I encourage all vic-
tims and witnesses of AAPI discrimination 
to not only speak out about what they’ve ex-
perienced, but against prejudice of any kind. 
In this pursuit, I implore others to speak 
loudly about the deeply damaging and dis-
heartening effects of racial discrimination 
when they feel that they are ready to. Most 
importantly, I ask that we all try to speak 
proudly of one another and what we have ac-
complished despite all the obstacles. Imag-
ining the power that our community could 
hold in taking those steps fills me with a 
deep sense of faith in a better future for all 
of our families—no matter the color of our 
skin.

TRIBUTE TO JENNIE COOK—28TH 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Jennie Cook 
of Silver Lake, a unique neighborhood of Los 
Angeles, California. 
Ms. Cook’s passion for cooking and dedica-
tion to changing the way America eats mani-
fests itself in her business as the owner and 
executive chef of Jennie Cook’s Catering and 
Plant Based Parties, which she has operated 
for nearly four decades. Prior to that, she was 
the owner of Cook’s Double Dutch Restaurant, 
where she created the Sustainable Supper 
Club, which offered a quarterly vegan family 
style meal. Jennie is also a columnist and in 
2013 published her cookbook, ‘‘Who Wants 
Seconds?’’ 
She also established the 24th Street Garden 
School Foundation, which provides a cooking 
class for third grade students in the garden, 
and founded The Mystery Lunch Box Chal-
lenge, a cooking competition class at Cren-
shaw and Jefferson High Schools. For several 
years, Jennie served as Chairwoman of the 
Board of RootDownLA, which educates chil-
dren on how to grow, cook, share, and sell 
vegetables. Ms. Cook is a founding member of 
Food for Lunch!, which lobbied for healthier 
foods in the Los Angeles Unified School Dis-
trict. 
Other volunteer activities include fundraising 
for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music’s 
scholarship fund, assisting in the creation of 
the Los Angeles Chapter of Moms Demand 
Action, and organizing a monthly mixer in her 
neighborhood to celebrate the community. In 
addition, when her children were younger, she 
served on the boards of the Rose Scharlin Co- 
operative Nursery School, the Hilltop Nursery 
School, and the Sequoyah School. 
Jennie and her husband of 45 years, John 
Cook, live in Silver Lake, and have three 
grown children. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Jennie Cook.

TEXAS’ 
THIRD 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
ACADEMY SELECTION BOARD 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor those members of 
Texas’ Third Congressional District’s Academy 
Selection Board whose longtime service to 
Texas and the U.S. Service Academies is to 
be commended. 
These individuals exemplify the time hon-
ored qualities of patriotism, service before self, 
and bold leadership which in turn have en-
abled them to assist in seeking out our next 
generation of servant leaders qualified to lead 
our nation as military officers in training. Not 
only have these patriots worn the uniform in 
defense of America, following their time in 
service they have chosen to enrich their com-
munities, most notably through their service on 
this Board. One such patriot is Mr. Michael 
‘‘Mike’’ Sweeney. 
Mike Sweeney is a 1966 graduate of distinc-
tion with the United States Naval Academy 
(USNA). During his time at USNA, he was a 
member of the undefeated 1964 NCAA Cham-
pionship Soccer Team and was selected as 
Commander of the Brigade of Midshipmen 
during his senior year. 
Following graduation, Mike served five years 
as a Surface Warfare Officer in the U.S. Navy 
including service in the Vietnam War. Upon re-
turn to civilian life, he would join Ross Perot’s 
Electronic Data Systems (EDS) as a trainee 
starting a new career in information tech-
nology. EDS would be a great place for Mike 
to have a career as a Navy graduate—a work-
place complete with blue suits, white shirts, 
and good opportunities. 
Sweeney worked at EDS as a systems en-
gineer developing health care systems before 
moving into management, and progressively 
increasing in responsibility as he relocated to 
the company’s corporate headquarters. Along 
the way, he pioneered the concept of remote 
software engineering centers and was respon-
sible for managing seventy centers in twenty- 
nine countries. His teams developed new busi-
ness systems for General Motors, including 
OnStar. Later, Mike overhauled the company’s 
corporate technical training and worked on 
corporate strategy. 
Notably, during the dot-com era, he served 
as President of the E-Solutions global delivery 
organization and was responsible for cor-
porate technology strategy, thought leadership 
and R&D. Mike retired after 31 years of loyal 
service at EDS. 
In retirement, Mike enjoys bike riding, fly 
fishing, and riding his Harley with his Naval 
Academy roommate. He and his wife, Peggy, 
have made their home in Prosper and are the 
proud parents to two grown children and four 
grandchildren. 
With gratitude we thank Mike Sweeney for 
his over 28 years of service on the Third Con-
gressional District’s Service Academy Selec-
tion Board. While his presence as a valued 
member of this organization will be deeply 
missed, we are honored to salute him for his 
longtime and dedicated efforts in nominating 
countless young patriots to the Service Acad-
emies. 
HONORING THE PATRIOTIC 
SERVICE OF CHAD ANDERSON 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Chad Anderson for his patriotic serv-
ice to the City of Celina, Texas. As a City 
Councilman in Place 6, Chad served the City 
of Celina for three terms. The City of Celina 
sits just North of Dallas and has been a focal 
point of growth in the North Texas region for 
several years. Since 2010 the population of 
Celina has tripled, out pacing any other North 
Texas city. As a Councilman, Chad managed 
this explosive growth and ensured that the 
City was ready to take on new community 
members and new businesses. 
One of his key policy priorities was the de-
velopment of Celina’s infrastructure. New 
roads, bridges, proper drainage, and public 
safety structures all bear the mark of Chad’s 
thoughtfulness as a City Councilman. During 
his time in office, he never forgot about the 
heroes among us—law enforcement, fire-
fighters, EMS, and all frontline workers. He 
ensured that the City kept its law enforcement 
funding when many cities throughout the 
country sought to defund. When firefighters 
needed modernized facilities and funding, 
Chad was their No. 1 ally. 
In his 19 years in Celina, Chad has become 
a pillar of his community and, though he is no 
longer a City Councilman, will continue to be 
a servant leader who seeks to lift up everyone 
in his City. The foundation for all his service 
is, without a doubt, his wife Michele, and their 
two children, CJ and Molly. 
Outside of his official work, Chad became 
the proprietor of his own insurance company 
in 2010 which gave him personal experience 
and insight into small business development 
and growth. He has also championed the 
Celina Cajun Fest, Oktoberfest and coached 
youth sports. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize 
Chad Anderson’s patriotism and devotion to 
God, 
Family, 
and 
Country. 
Furthermore, 
Madam Speaker, I would like to personally 
commend Mr. Anderson for his service to the 
City of Celina as a Councilman and I wish him 
all the best in his future endeavors.

HONORING NEW YORK DISTRICT 
KIWANIS 
CLUB 
GOVERNOR 
JAMES M. MANCUSO 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor New York District Kiwanis Club Gov-
ernor, James M. Mancuso. As a longtime 
member of the Kiwanis Club, James has com-
mitted himself to philanthropic pursuits that 
have improved the lives of people across New 
York State. 
Since its founding in 1915, members of the 
Kiwanis Club have devoted themselves to 
public service, focusing on initiatives that work 
for the betterment of their communities. Lead-
ers like James are the heart and soul of the 
Kiwanis Club, and the reason this organization 
has been so successful for over a century. 
James Mancuso joined the Kiwanis Club in 
2002 and immediately took to its mission of 
improving the world one child and one com-
munity at a time. James has served two terms 
as a Lieutenant Governor of the Long Island 
South Central Division and president of the 
East Meadow Club. He has also chaired com-
mittees on International Leadership, Youth 
Protection, and the Kiwanis International Chil-
dren’s Fund for the New York District. In Octo-
ber of 2021, James was promoted to New 
York District Kiwanis Club Governor, where he 
has continued his exemplary advocacy and 
volunteerism across New York State. 
As a member of the Kiwanis Club, James 
has led numerous projects, most notably, 
building a Garden of Hope with the Kiwanis 
Club of East Meadow in partnership with 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), Stu-
dents Against Drunk Driving (SADD), and 
Nassau County. The garden included a sculp-
ture depicting the aftermath of a drunk driving 
accident to encourage local residents not to 
get behind the wheel while impaired. He has 
also held many fundraisers that have bene-
fited projects to get more infants vaccinated. 
For his work, James has earned the Anton 
J. Kaiser Award, recognition from the New 
York District’s Pediatric Lyme Disease Foun-
dation, and an IBM Volunteers Gold Award 
Level for Volunteerism and Community Serv-
ice. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in honoring the contribu-
tions of James M. Mancuso. A devoted volun-
teer and committed member of the Kiwanis 
Club, James has empowered members of his 
community through his philanthropic efforts.

HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today

tions and sacrifices made by our Nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-

CELEBRATING 
THE 
FIFTY-SEV-
ENTH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
HEAD START PROGRAM 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the fifty-seventh anniversary of the 
Head Start program, which was founded on 
the idea that people of all backgrounds can 
lead productive lives and thus deserve the op-
portunities that education makes possible. 
Since its creation on May 18, 1965, Head 
Start has fostered the cognitive, social, phys-
ical, and emotional development of tens of mil-
lions of children from low-income families 
across America and has helped set them up 
for success before they begin their educational 
journeys in school. 
When President Lyndon B. Johnson intro-
duced Head Start as part of his ‘War on Pov-
erty,’ he said that the program would go down 
in history as ‘one of the most constructive, and 
one of the most sensible, and also one of the 
most exciting programs that this Nation has 
ever undertaken.’ His words proved prescient, 
as even today, more than a million American 
pre-school children participate in Head Start 
each year. These students are not the only 
ones who benefit from the program. Early-edu-
cation teachers gain insights from research 
conducted by Head Start administrators. Par-
ents gain access to affordable child care and 
job training, allowing them to work to improve 
their families’ well-being. By every measure, 
this program is delivering enormous benefits 
to our country and the children who will be its 
future. 
The overwhelming success of Head Start, 
however, belongs to the communities that sup-
port it. Head Start depends on the dedication 
of more than a million volunteers—most of 
whom are the parents of Head Start children— 
who devote hours of their time to the program. 
Their work is crucial at a time when more than 
6 million American children, or nearly 15 per-
cent of all kids in the United States, live in 
poverty. When data was last reported in 2019, 
it revealed that 59,000 families participating in 
Head Start had been experiencing homeless-
ness. Thanks in part to Head Start’s services, 
however, more than a quarter of these families 
were able to find housing that same year. 
From expanding programs like the Chil-
dren’s Health Insurance Program to imple-
menting the Child Tax Credit to help families 
weather the COVID–19 pandemic, House 
Democrats continue to take action aimed at 
eradicating child poverty in our country. Head 
Start will remain one of our greatest tools to 
combat child poverty in the years ahead, and 
we must continue to ensure that it has the 
support and resources it needs to carry that 
work forward. As President Johnson said 
when he created Head Start: ‘five- and six- 
year-old children are inheritors of poverty’s 
curse and not its creators.’ These children 
today can help us build a better and stronger 
America for tomorrow, but only if we invest in 
their growth, wellbeing, and opportunity. 
RECOGNIZING THE 57TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF HEAD START 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 57th anniversary of the 
Head Start program and the invaluable serv-
ices it makes available to children and families 
in need. 
In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson com-
missioned Sargent Shriver with the establish-
ment of a comprehensive child development 
program that would assist underserved com-
munities meet the needs of preschool children. 
With the help of education, psychology, and 
child experts, the U.S. government initially 
launched ‘‘Project Head Start’’ as an eight- 
week summer program that reached 561,000 
children. Finding early success, the program 
was expanded in the fall of 1965 to provide 
services throughout the entire school year. In 
the subsequent decades, Head Start has fur-
ther grown to include bilingual and bicultural 
programs, as well as services for disadvan-
taged infants, toddlers, and pregnant women 
through Early Head Start grants. 
The initiative has now reached over 39 mil-
lion children in its history and serves nearly 1 
million children and their families annually in 
urban and rural areas in all fifty states, the 
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. 
territories. Head Start’s exceptional dedication 
to our children is admirable, and this year, as 
it celebrates its 57th anniversary, we express 
our appreciation for the impact that it has had 
on communities across the country and espe-
cially in Bucks and Montgomery counties.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF 
SENATOR 
HIRAM 
RHODES 
REVELS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
service of Senator Hiram Rhodes Revels. 
Senator Revels was the first Black person to 
serve in the United Sates Senate, and he was 
the first pastor of Zion Chapel African Meth-
odist Episcopal Church in Natchez. 
Senator Revels was born a free man in Fay-
etteville, North Carolina on September 27, 
1827. In 1845, Senator Revels was ordained 
a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church after attending the Beech Grove Quak-
er Seminary in Indiana and Darke Seminary 
for Blacks in Ohio. At the beginning of the 
Civil War, Senator Revels established two Col-
ored Troop regiments from Maryland, and in 
1862, he served as Chaplin for a U.S. Colored 
Troop regiment in Vicksburg, MS and Natch-
ez, MS. In 1863 Senator Revels established a 
Freedman’s school in St. Louis, MO. In 1866 
after serving churches in Louisville, KY and 
New Orleans, LA, Senator Revels settled in 
Natchez, MS where he became pastor of Zion 
Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church. In 
1868, Senator Revels’ first elected position 
was as a Natchez Alderman. In 1869, Senator

Revels was elected to the Mississippi Legisla-
ture as a Senator. On January 20, 1870, the 
Mississippi Legislature voted to seat Senator 
Revels to fill one of two unexpired Mississippi 
U.S. Senate seats vacated by Senator Albert 
Brown and Senator Jefferson Davis, who va-
cated his Senate seat to serve as President of 
the Confederacy. During Reconstruction, as 
Mississippi was readmitted to the Union on 
February 23, 1870, Hiram Rhodes Revels took 
his seat on February 25, 1870 as the first 
Black person to serve in the United States 
Senate and served on the Education and 
Labor Committee. 
At the end of his Senate term on March 3, 
1871, Senator Revels chose to return to Mis-
sissippi to become the first President of Alcorn 
State University, formally known as Oakland 
College. Alcorn is the first landgrant school in 
the United States for Black students. Alcorn is 
named for Senator Revels’ political supporter, 
Governor James Alcorn. Briefly, in 1873, Sen-
ator Revels was chosen as Mississippi interim 
Secretary of State after the death of John Roy 
Lynch. He took a hiatus from Alcorn in 1874 
and became the pastor of a church in Holly 
Springs, MS. In 1876 he returned as President 
of Alcorn and retired in 1882. Senator Revels 
returned to the ministry in Holly Springs where 
he died January 16, 1901. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Senator Hiram Rhodes Revels.

REMEMBERING RUTH MARIE 
GRANT 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, along with Congressman MIKE DOYLE, 
to recognize the life of Ruth Marie Grant who 
passed away on Saturday, May 14, 2022, 
after a wonderful and trailblazing 90 years of 
life. 
Ruth Marie O’Block was born on September 
2, 1931, in Plum, Pennsylvania and spent her 
life growing and investing in her community 
through business and public service. This 
began after her graduation from Seton Hill 
University and marriage to Louis A. Grant. 
True to Pittsburgh style, together they began 
Louis A. Grant, Inc., a multi-million-dollar inter-
national competitor in the steel and aluminum 
industry. Ruth led the company for 54 years, 
spearheading women’s leadership in an over-
whelmingly male-dominated industry. 
She also made significant headway in the fi-
nancial industry, serving as the first female 
Board Member of People’s Bank of Unity and 
remained active on the Board of S&T Bank 
following the two institutions’ merger. 
At her core, Ruth was a champion for public 
service, and inspiration for tomorrow’s leaders. 
She was constantly seeking ways to improve 
access to education and serve her community. 
Her titles were numerous and spanned all lev-
els of government. At the national level, Ruth 
served on the U.S. Department of Com-
merce’s Committee on International Trade. In 
Pennsylvania, she served on the Governor’s 
Education Committee where she contributed 
to the formulation of public policy, key per-
sonnel selections and decisions to reduce 
costs while enhancing the Commonwealth’s 
education services. And in Plum specifically, 
she held numerous roles including with the 
Plum Water Authority, Plum Planning and 
Zoning commission and the Plum Library 
Board. 
Ruth also left an indelible mark at Seton Hill 
University, where she served as a trustee for 
a total of 22 years and was the immediate 
past chair of the Board of Trustees. 
We believe Ruth would agree, that despite 
a lifetime of service, her most important titles 
were mother and ‘‘Granna.’’ Ruth is pre-de-
ceased by her husband Louis, but survived by 
her four children: Toni Grant Verstandig (Lee), 
Cindy 
Grant 
Pallatino, 
Ruth 
Ann 
Grant 
Wargofchik and Louis A. Grant, Jr., and seven 
grandchildren: John R. Wargofchik III, Andrew 
Wargofchik, 
Brady 
Wargofchik, 
Grant 
Verstandig, Brittany Grant, Louis Grant and 
Gaetano Grant. 
May her legacy serve as an inspiration to 
new generations of public servants and entre-
preneurs; and her memory serve as a blessing 
to her family.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
LUCY 
LEVINSOHN 
BERMAN—28TH 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Women’s History Month. Each year, 
we pay special tribute to the contributions and 
sacrifices made by our Nation’s women. It is 
an honor to pay homage to outstanding 
women who are making a difference in my 
Congressional District. I would like to recog-
nize a remarkable woman, Lucy Levinsohn 
Berman of Sunland, a unique neighborhood of 
Los Angeles, California. 
Lucy grew up in Palm Desert, California with 
her mother and sisters but spent many vaca-
tions and weekends with her father in 
Sunland. After her graduation from Palm 
Desert High School, she moved to the Los An-
geles area, where she attended Glendale 
Community College, and California State Uni-
versity, Northridge, where she obtained her 
Bachelor of Arts in Music. 
Activism and community service were im-
portant values instilled into Lucy at an early 
age. As a young girl, she volunteered at 
Ahead with Horses, a non-profit dedicated to 
providing equine therapy to disabled, special 
needs, and disadvantaged children. As a teen-
ager, she volunteered for the Temple Sinai of 
Palm Desert’s Thanksgiving feasts and yearly 
food drive and created her first daytime music 
festival in support of the Desert AIDS Project 
called NOMAD (New Original Music Across 
the Desert). 
Ms. Levinsohn Berman is a Jewish Amer-
ican songwriter, singer and recording artist, 
who is most recognized as the frontwoman of 
the alternative rock band EVOLOVE, based in 
Los Angeles. Lucy’s music has been featured 
in film and television, and her most recent 
project, The DreiDells is a Jewish comedy duo 
she and her sister, Anya Boyer developed to 
share a positive worldwide message about Ju-
daism. A community builder and activist, she 
is a committee member of Songwriters of 
North America, which works towards fair roy-
alty rates in the digital arena. 
For nearly a decade, Ms. Levinsohn Berman 
has been a well-known leader in the Sunland- 
Tujunga Jewish community. As an enthusiastic 
member of the Sunland-Tujunga Neighbor-
hood Council’s Arts, Recreation, and Culture 
Committee, she founded Hanukkah in the 
Foothills, an annual inclusive celebration open 
to everyone that features traditional Hanukkah 
music, food, and the Hanukkah story. She 
also volunteered for Love The Neighborhood, 
a Sunland-Tujunga community beautification 
group. 
Lucy and her husband, Billy, reside in 
Sunland with their two children, Zoey and 
Benny, dogs, tortoise, and chickens. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 
28th 
Congressional 
District, 
Lucy 
Levinsohn Berman.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Captain Kevin Long of the 
Dearborn Fire Department on the occasion of 
his retirement. His honorable twenty-six years 
of service to our community is worthy of com-
mendation. 
Captain Long began his career at the Dear-
born Fire Department in October 1996, begin-
ning as a Firefighter 1. In April 2002, he was 
promoted to Firefighter 2 and then to the role 
of Fire Engineer in May 2006. Due to his ex-
cellence in service, he was named Lieutenant 
in April 2011 and then Captain in August 
2012. Known for his bravery and leadership, 
he received the Departmental Medal of Valor 
in 1997 and the John D. Dingell Medal of 
Freedom Memorial Commendation in 2019. 
He is also the recipient of several awards, in-
cluding the Fire Chief Life Saving Award, the 
Meritorious Service Award, the Fire Chief Unit

Company Commendations. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Captain Kevin Long for a ca-
reer of exemplary service to the Dearborn Fire 
Department. I join with Captain Long’s family, 
friends, and colleagues in extending my grati-
tude to him for his honorable service in pro-
tecting our community and thank him for his 
role in serving the people of the City of Dear-
born for the past twenty-six years. We wish

WEEK (NRW) AND THE NATIONAL 
ROOFING 
CONTRACTORS 
ASSO-
CIATION (NRCA) 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 18, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in recognition of the National Roof-
ing Contractors Association and its efforts to 
promote the roofing industry and the work of 
its members through the designation of June 
5–11, 2022, as National Roofing Week. 
A roof is one of the most critical parts of any 
home or business. It serves as the first line of 
defense against natural elements, such as 
rain, snow, or wind, and yet it is often taken 
for granted until it falls into disrepair. National 
Roofing Week is meant to honor the thou-
sands of roofing-related businesses and work-
ers across the country, as well as the indus-
try’s commitment to public service. National 
Roofing Week is a valuable reminder of quality 
roofing’s significance for every home and busi-
ness across the U.S. 
Established in 1886 and headquartered in 
Rosemont, Illinois, NRCA is one of the oldest 
trade associations and the voice of profes-
sional roofing contractors worldwide. NRCA 
has nearly 4,000 roofing company members 
who represent the entire roofing supply chain. 
NRCA uses its vast network of roofing con-
tractors and industry-related members for the 
installation of new construction and replace-
ment roof systems on commercial and resi-
dential structures throughout America. Most of 
its members are small, privately-held busi-
nesses that provide family-sustaining jobs for 
thousands of hardworking individuals that 
make up the backbone of our Nation’s econ-
omy. 
Professional roofing contractors provide vital 
services to their communities, on and off the 
clock. NRCA members will recognize National 
Roofing Week June 5–11 by supporting nu-
merous charitable projects, employee training 
programs, and other activities across the na-
tion. I commend NRCA and the vital role the 
organization and its members play in every 
community, and I ask my colleagues to join 
me in acknowledging their contributions during 
National Roofing Week.
