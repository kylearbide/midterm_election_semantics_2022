DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, on this rare confluence of 
religious holidays of three of the 
world’s largest religions, distinct rit-
uals and practices honor Your presence 
in history and direct the hearts of the 
faithful to You. 
Even as each individual approaches 
You, help us to see how more alike we 
are than different. As families gather 
and communities worship, we, each in 
our own way, submit our will to You 
and together pray for inspiration to be 
a better person, be we Jewish, Chris-
tian, or Muslim. 
How grateful we are, O God, that our 
country was founded on the religious 
freedom we enjoy in this season. And 
we pray that as Jews gather around the 
Seder meal, Muslims break their fast 
each evening, and Christians observe 
Holy Week, that each worshipping 
American would prove to be a model, 
not just of individual faith, but of mu-
tual respect for those who were each 
created in Your image. 
Grant us the miracle that the world 
would no longer feed on the bitter 
herbs of terror, that passion would not 
be an excuse for prejudice, and that all 
religious fervor would be directed to 
welcoming the stranger to the empty 
chair at the table. 
In these sacred days, may our hearts 
be open to Your presence among us. We 
each pray in the strength of Your 
name. 
Amen.

SUPPORTING H. RES. 1021, RECOG-
NIZING THE COMMENCEMENT OF 
RAMADAN, THE MUSLIM HOLY 
MONTH OF FASTING AND SPIR-
ITUAL 
RENEWAL, 
AND 
COM-
MENDING 
MUSLIMS 
IN 
THE 
UNITED STATES AND THROUGH-
OUT 
THE 
WORLD 
FOR 
THEIR 
FAITH 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H. Res. 1021 in recognizing the 
holiest of celebrations of the Islamic faith. The 
holy month of Ramadan is a sacred time of 
study, sacrifice, commitment and spiritual re-
newal—a month of fasting, worship, self-re-
flection, community, and charitable activities. 
Muslim Americans embrace the values and 
ideals that make our Nation great, such as 
discipline, egalitarianism, empathy, and mod-
eration. In no month is this more evident than 
in the month of Ramadan, when, from sunrise 
to sunset Muslims exercise great discipline in 
abstaining from eating, drinking, and sensual 
pleasures from sunrise to sunset. 
Occurring on the ninth month of the Islamic 
lunar calendar that begins with the sighting of 
the crescent moon, Ramadan is a month that 
Muslims recognize as the month that the 
Qur’an was first revealed to the Prophet Mu-
hammad. 
We are reminded during this holy month of 
the rich diversity and many contributions that 
Muslim Americans have made in every sector 
of society. Diversity is a corner stone of Amer-
ican society and success. Our Muslim Amer-
ican community is a vital contributor to our na-
tions diversity, as well as to the talents, per-
spectives, and achievements that diversity 
brings. 
Unfortunately, racial profiling, harassment, 
and discrimination against Muslim Americans 
have increased since the tragedy of 9/11. 
Many years of Civil Rights jurisprudence and 
law have been ignored and thrown out the 
window when America permits the racial 
profiling, harassment, and discrimination of 
Muslim Americans to occur with impunity. 
Since its establishment in 1994, Council on 
American Islamic Relations has fulfilled the im-
portant role of being a leading advocate for 
justice and mutual understanding across the 
United States making it America’s largest Is-
lamic civil liberties group. Council on American 
Islamic Relations has served to enhance un-
derstanding of Islam, encourage dialogue, pro-
tect civil liberties, empower American Muslims, 
and build coalitions that promote justice and 
mutual understanding. 
There are approximately 3 million Muslims 
living in the United States. Muslims make up 
approximately 1.2% of the population in the 
Houston area. 
The Islamic Society of Greater Houston 
began in 1969 when local Muslim families 
gathered for prayer at a small house in the 
Medical Center. From this tiny group, their 
community has grown to include 19 masjids 
across greater Houston making it the largest 
Islamic Society in North America. 
Through the Shifa Clinics, the Islamic Soci-
ety of Greater Houston has been healing the 
community one patient at a time through free 
medical care provided to all those in need. 
The Shifa Clinics provide healthcare services 
ranging from ophthalmology to dentistry to 
wellness exams and immunizations at 4 clinics 
across the region. 
The Islamic Society of Greater Houston is at 
the heart of the Houston Muslim Community. 
It embodies the unity that the Islamic faith 
brings brothers and sisters together. 
Muslims from around the world join in this 
special joy-filled occasion that brings loved 
ones together in festive celebration that serves 
as an inspiration for others. 
I have been a proud co-sponsor over the 
years of the resolution recognizing the start of 
Ramadan, an important reaffirmation of the di-
versity and unity of America. Today, I am hon-
ored to join my fellow colleagues in recog-
nizing the condemning of Muslim Americans 
and those around the world for their faith. The 
Muslim American community is an integral 
part of the fabric of our nation. We must come 
together, not apart. Out of many, we are one. 
May this Ramadan bring joy, peace, and unity 
throughout the World. Eid Mubarak.

TRIBUTE IN CELEBRATION OF 
LORETTA LYNN’S 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to pay tribute to Loretta Lynn, in celebra-
tion of her 90th birthday. The incredible voice 
of America’s famed coal miner’s daughter has 
resounded across the Appalachian Mountains 
and around the world, highlighting the resil-
iency and courage of the people of Eastern 
Kentucky, where she was born and raised. 
Loretta Lynn’s superstardom is a remark-
able story, rising from her humble beginnings 
in Butcher Holler to the top of the country 
music charts. Her Eastern Kentucky roots 
shine through the lyrics of her most famous 
songs and paint a prominent picture of hope 
and perseverance that are iconic in our coal 
mining region. She has inspired generations of 
gifted singers from the mountains. Although 
Nashville gets much of the glory for birthing 
the superstars of country music, it is in the 
hills of Eastern Kentucky where many of them 
were born, raised, and played their first gui-
tars. Loretta Lynn is just one of the many 
names lining our Country Music Highway in 
Eastern Kentucky. We have a rich heritage of 
talented musicians and vocalists, thanks to 
country music pioneers, like Loretta Lynn, who 
proved that hard work, mountain grit and 
sheer talent makes for an unstoppable com-
bination. 
At the age of 28, she signed with her first 
record label and stepped onto the Grand Ole 
Opry stage for the first of many times, becom-
ing a member just two years later. In 1972, 
she was the first woman to be nominated and 
to win Entertainer of the Year at the Country 
Music Association (CMA) Awards. She went 
on to win CMA’s Female Vocalist of the Year 
award in 1967, 1972 and 1973. When we 
teamed up with Conway Twitty, the duo re-
corded five consecutive number one hits, win-
ning the CMA’s Vocal Duo of the Year award 
for four consecutive years, 1972 through 1975. 
Her best-selling autobiography, Coal Miner’s 
Daughter, was turned into an Academy 
Award-winning film in 1980. As her success 
continued, Loretta Lynn was inducted into the 
Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the 
Country Music Hall of Fame in 1988 at the 
age of 56. Her portfolio includes 60 studio al-
bums, including five certified gold and one cer-
tified platinum record. Earning 18 Grammy 
nominations and 3 Grammy awards, Loretta 
Lynn stands now as the most awarded female 
country recording artist and the only female to 
be named the Academy of Country Music’s 
Artist of the Decade. Adding to her monu-
mental list of accolades, she was also award-
ed the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her 
lifetime contributions to the arts. 
The people of Kentucky are proud of our 
own ‘‘Coal Miner’s Daughter’’ and the legacy 
of hope that Loretta Lynn built to move moun-
tains for aspiring young artists from the Appa-
lachian Mountains. On her 90th birthday, we 
celebrate and applaud the life of Loretta Lynn.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MS. 
OLGA JACKSON 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the life and career of 
Olga Armour Jackson. Since 1956, Ms. Jack-
son has performed one of our most important 
jobs as a professional educator. She has 
served at every level, as a Kindergarten 
Teacher, a Head Start Teacher, a Head Start 
Pre-Kindergarten Teacher, a Teacher of Gifted 
Children via Project First, an Adult/GED In-
structor, an Adjunct Instructor in Early Child-
hood Education at the Vocational and Com-
munity College level, a Program Manager/ 
Trainer and an Early Childhood Education 
Consultant. 
Olga Armour Jackson was born on Novem-
ber 20, 1933, and is the eldest of ten children 
of the late Reverend Lloyd J. Armour, Sr., and 
the late Frances Ernestine Henry Armour. 
Married to the late Lawrence Jackson, Sr., she 
is mother to Lawrence Jackson, Jr., and 
Grandmother to Janae’ and Jarrell Jackson. 
Ms. Jackson was educated in the public

schools of New Orleans where she attended 
Johnson 
C. 
Lockett 
Elementary 
and 
McDonogh 35 Senior High School. She went 
on to receive her Bachelor of Arts degree in 
Kindergarten-Primary Education from Dillard 
University in 1956 and later earned her Master 
of Education degree in Early Childhood Edu-
cation from Tulane University. In the seven-
ties, she furthered her education even more at 
Tulane University. 
Ms. Jackson has retired three times in her 
illustrious career. First, from the New Orleans 
Public School System in 1977. In 2001, she 
retired from St. Mark’s Community Center 
where she directed the Child Care Training 
Program. Finally, in 2015, she retired from 
Delgado Community College, where she in-
structed CDA Prep Training for Head Start 
and childcare teachers in the Greater New Or-
leans area. 
She is a passionate Head Start supporter. 
Ms. Jackson most recently served as a mem-
ber of the Jefferson Parish Head Start Policy 
Council as a Community Representative from 
2015 to 2021. Her past service has included 
CDA Advisor and Trainer to Head Start teach-
ing staff, member of the Head Start Policy 
Council Education committee giving input to 
policies impacting parental programs in Head 
Start Centers, and as a presenter at Jefferson 
Parish Head Start Annual Teacher Work-
shops. Ms. Jackson has certainly left a lasting 
impact in the Head Start community across 
several communities and in various capacities 
since its inception in 1965. 
Her dedication to the advocacy and protec-
tion of the rights of children is unmatched. She 
has been active in numerous causes for chil-
dren and families. Ms. Jackson is Past Presi-
dent of the Louisiana Association for the Edu-
cation of Young Children; Founder and Advi-
sor of the New Orleans Association of Family 
Child Care Providers, Inc.; former Advisory 
Board member of the Louisiana Children’s 
Trust Fund; former Trainer of the WYES 
Ready to Learn Program; Life Member of the 
Dillard University Alumni Association and Lou-
isiana Retired Teachers Association 
Ms. Jackson has had a lasting impact on 
countless individuals across the Greater New 
Orleans region and State of Louisiana that can 
never be measured. I am honored to be able 
to share her story with the rest of the nation 
for generations to come so that others may be 
inspired by her service to others.

HONORING MATILDA ZIZOLI 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Matilda Zizoli, an essential partner in 
our effort to relocate Afghan allies from Alba-
nia to the United States. 
When it was announced in mid-August 2021 
that Afghan evacuees would be hosted in 
Tirana, Ms. Zizoli answered the call and 
began volunteering with Spirit of America, a 
non-profit organization whose mission is to 
support our diplomats and our men and 
women in uniform abroad. Despite her volun-
teer period concluding once the Afghan evac-
uees were relocated to Shengjin, Albania, Ms. 
Zizoli continued to volunteer and organize crit-
ical services support for the evacuees. She 
also continued to help Spirit of America per-
sonnel with her local knowledge and contacts 
throughout the country. In October 2021, Ms. 
Zizoli became the Albania Project Manager for 
Spirit of America. 
Before joining Spirit of America, Ms. Zizoli 
led a life of public service. From working with 
Roma communities in Tirana to serving at so-
cial services centers and developing mental 
and emotional well-being services for the un-
derprivileged, Ms. Zizoli has always worked to 
better the lives of those who are less fortu-
nate. Ms. Zizoli truly lives up to and embodies 
the Albanian notion of Besa: meaning to keep 
one’s word, particularly in aiding and pro-
tecting people in their greatest moment of 
need. 
During her time as Albania Project Manager, 
she was in charge of the care, support, and 
well-being of 121 Afghan evacuees. Ms. Zizoli 
helped several families navigate complicated 
issues: the birth of two newborn babies, the 
emergency evacuation of one family to the 
U.S. for a major health issue, several personal 
health issues for family members, and the 
psychological support needs of vulnerable Af-
ghan evacuees. She spearheaded the organi-
zation and preparation for the Afghan evac-
uees when the Department of Homeland Se-
curity fly-away team came to Albania and the 
group prepared to leave for the United States. 
At every turn, Ms. Zizoli acted with profes-
sionalism, humanity, and diligence. 
Throughout the seven months that these Af-
ghan evacuees were in Albania, Ms. Zizoli 
went above and beyond to ensure that they 
were cared for, safe, and supported. She or-
ganized cultural events for the Afghans to 
enjoy in Albania, fostering learning and appre-
ciation between the Albanian and Afghan peo-
ple. She was always willing to drop whatever 
she was doing to help them navigate the com-
plexities of government bureaucracies foreign 
to them, get them the care they needed, or 
just listen to their stories and help them 
through a difficult time. In so doing, Ms. Zizoli 
was instrumental in the success of the mis-
sion. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Ms. Matilda 
Zizoli for her willingness to go above and be-
yond the call of duty in our effort to evacuate 
Afghan allies from Kabul and support them in 
their new lives. For her commitment to sup-
porting them while they awaited processing 
and resettlement to the United States, for her 
value to the U.S.-Albanian partnership, and for 
her ‘‘I can manage’’ attitude when encoun-
tering problems or hurdles, I submit these 
words to the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD so they 
stand as a tribute to her dedicated service 
when the moment called for it most.

OUTSTANDING 
ATHLETIC 
LEADERSHIP 
AND 
SUCCESS 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Ms. Annie Habeeb 
for her exceptional accomplishments and lead-
ership as a soccer player. 
Ms. Habeeb attended Gray Stone Day 
School in Stanly County where she was a 
four-year member of the varsity women’s soc-
cer team. Over the course of her four-year 
high school career, she helped lead the 
Knights to a 71–9–5 record in which they won 
86.5 percent of their games and made it deep 
into the state playoffs each year. She also 
strengthened her game by playing in Iceland, 
Denmark, and Sweden as a member of the 
Lake Norman Soccer club team. Following 
high school, Ms. Habeeb competed for and re-
cently graduated from Flagler University where 
she earned her bachelor’s degree in hospi-
tality and tourism management with a minor in 
business administration. After experiencing 
great success over her four years of soccer at 
Flagler, Ms. Habeeb has decided to pursue a 
career in professional women’s soccer. She 
recently signed a contract with IFK Kalmar in 
Sweden’s OBOS Damallsvenskan league. 
As a member of one of the most prestigious 
soccer leagues in the world, Ms. Habeeb is 
the first student from Gray Stone Day School 
to become a professional athlete. This remark-
able achievement is tangible evidence of her 
hard work and determination which represents 
the very best of our community. Praised by 
others for her devout work ethic and superb 
leadership skills, Ms. Habeeb sets an excel-
lent example for all to follow. 
I would like to extend my most heartfelt ap-
preciation to Ms. Habeeb for her austere com-
mitment to soccer and dedicated leadership 
within our community. I speak for our entire 
community in wishing her continued success 
and happiness as she pursues her dream of 
playing professional soccer. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Ms. Annie Habeeb for her excellent 
leadership and unprecedented success as a 
graduate from Gray Stone Day School.

Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Chris and Lisa Jeffries on 
the occasion of the naming of Jeffries Hall at 
the University of Michigan Law School located 
in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Their significant con-
tributions to the University of Michigan and our 
greater community are worthy of commenda-
tion. 
A 1974 graduate of Michigan Law School, 
Chris Jeffries is a philanthropist and the co-
founder of Millennium Partners, a real estate 
development company. Upon graduation from 
Michigan, he worked as a partner at Keywell 
& Rosenfeld in Southfield, Michigan. He has 
also contributed to other Michigan institutions, 
such as the Henry Ford Health System based 
in Metro Detroit, to help them deliver better 
care and develop innovative treatments for pa-
tients. 
Mr. Jeffries recalls his time at Michigan Law 
as formative and memorable, and he wants to 
ensure that students who lack financial re-
sources are given the same opportunity to 
thrive at Michigan. Mr. and Mrs. Jeffries have 
committed $33 million to the University of

HONORING BOB GILES AS THE 2022 
TIME DEALER OF THE YEAR 
HON. CLAY HIGGINS 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam Speak-
er, I would like to honor a constituent of mine 
who was recently recognized with one of the 
highest honors in his industry. 
Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Giles, Chairman and CEO of 
Giles Automotive in Lafayette, LA, was named 
the 2022 TIME Dealer of the Year during the 
National Automobile Dealers Association’s 
awards ceremony in Las Vegas. This is the 
most prestigious honor that a franchised auto-
mobile dealer can receive. 
The award celebrates franchised new car 
and truck dealers for exceptional business 
performance and outstanding community serv-
ice. Mr. Giles was chosen among a field of 47 
dealer nominees and was selected by a panel 
of judges from the Tauber Institute at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. 
Mr. Giles is a second-generation automobile 
dealer owner, having followed his father who 
owned a Ford dealership in Denison, TX. After 
graduating from Texas A&M University in 
1976, Mr. Giles joined his father’s dealership 
and became sales manager at the age of 24. 
Today, thanks to his leadership, Giles Auto-
motive now comprises five dealerships in two 
Louisiana cities, Lafayette and Opelousas, 
along with another dealership in El Paso, TX. 
Giving back to the community has been one 
of Mr. Giles’ foundational principles through 
the Giles Gives Back program, which assists 
local organizations like the Acadiana Commu-
nity Heroes campaign. Mr. Giles also helped 
launch the Giles Essential Errand Running 
Service, 
which 
assists 
elderly 
and 
immunocompromised individuals with the de-
livery of essential goods, food, and pharmacy 
items. 
Mr. Giles has also been actively involved in 
many other organizations including the Out-
reach Center, which provides shelter and sup-
port for homeless individuals in the Acadiana 
area. He has helped raise more than 
$500,000 to support the organization’s efforts. 
Mr. Giles was nominated for this award by 
Will Green, President of the Louisiana Auto-
mobile Dealers Association. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of 
Louisiana’s 3rd District, I congratulate Mr. Bob 
Giles on being named the 2022 TIME Dealer 
of the Year. I thank him for his selfless work 
to support our local community, and I wish him 
and his family and team at Giles Automotive 
continued success and a prosperous future.

RECOGNIZING MR. GEORGE STEVE 
BOSAN UPON HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
to recognize Mr. George Steve Bosan upon 
the auspicious occasion of his 100th Birthday. 
A resident of Mechanicsburg, via Newark, 
New Jersey, where he was born on April 21, 
1922, Mr. Bosan’s incredible life spans dec-
ades of service to the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania and the United States of Amer-
ica. He and his late wife, Louise, had one 
child together, Steven Bosan. 
Mr. Bosan’s military career began as a Lieu-
tenant in the U.S. Army, European theatre. He 
served in a combat engineer battalion in the 
Third Army, commanded by General George 
S. Patton. Mr. Bosan was stationed in France 
after D–Day, where he and his unit made it 
across the Rhine River before he was injured 
in combat. 
Following his injuries, Mr. Bosan worked as 
a draftsman before returning to active service 
in the Korean War. He graduated from flight 
school and arrived in Korea as commander of 
a light aviation unit, flying both helicopters and 
fixed wing aircraft. He regularly flew General 
Paik of the Republic of Korean Army in his 
Bell H–13 helicopter. Following the Korean 
War, he served in various posts across the 
United States and France before next serving 
in the Vietnam War, in which he served as the 
commander of a combat aviation maintenance 
battalion during the Tet Offensive. 
After returning from the Vietnam War, Mr. 
Bosan served in multiple postings stateside 
before his retirement from the New Cum-
berland Army Depot, at which he served as 
the Director of Maintenance and led 1,200 ci-
vilian technicians responsible for overhauling 
Chinook helicopters. Mr. Bosan’s civilian ca-
reer ultimately ended after 17 years as the fa-
cilities manager for the Hospital Association of 
Pennsylvania. 
After his decades of service to our Nation, 
I’m privileged by the opportunity to recognize 
this amazing member of the ‘‘Greatest Gen-
eration’’ as he celebrates his 100th Birthday. 
Thank you will never be enough, and I wish 
him continued Godspeed.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BOYS & GIRLS 
CLUBS OF WEST SAN GABRIEL 
VALLEY & EASTSIDE 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor the Boys & Girls Clubs of West San 
Gabriel Valley & Eastside on their 50th Anni-
versary. 
For 50 years, the Boys & Girls Clubs of 
West San Gabriel Valley & Eastside have 
navigated through challenging times to provide 
a safe place for kids and teens. Today, they 
are committed more than ever to ensure club 
staff, families, and communities have the re-
sources and support they need during uncer-
tain and difficult times. 
The Boys & Girls Club of West San Gabriel 
Valley and Eastside has three clubs in CA 34: 
Estrada Courts, Ramona Gardens, and Wil-
liam Mead. These clubs, which are located in 
low-income public housing communities, pro-
vide a fun, structured environment for after 
school, during holidays, and on summer vaca-
tion for youth ages 6–17. The programs and 
services that are offered promote and en-
hance the development of America’s youth 
and families by instilling a sense of worth, be-
longing and inspiration. 
These clubs inspire me. They are open 6 
days a week serving over 6,000 kids and 
2,200 families and they have served more 
than 250,000 meals in our community. During 
the Covid–19 pandemic the Boys & Girls 
Clubs of West San Gabriel Valley & Eastside 
stepped up for the community and distributed 
over 1 million face masks, hand sanitizers and 
assorted PPE. Additionally, the clubs hosted 
vaccine clinics where they administered over 
600 vaccines. Sixty-eight families received 
Rent Relief to stay in their homes during the 
holidays and an additional $60,000 was given 
to 30 families at the start of 2022 in rent relief 
support. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring and celebrating the 50th anni-
versary of the Boys & Girls Club of West San 
Gabriel Valley & Eastside.

HONORING THE CAREER OF DAVID 
GIOIELLO 
HON. JAMES A. HIMES 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor a resident of Connecticut’s 4th Congres-
sional District and my good friend, David 
Gioiello. 
For over 45 years David has worked as an 
industrial health and safety consultant. An ac-
tive member of his community, he served on 
the Shelton Board of Education for two terms 
where he was a fierce advocate for students 
and teachers. 
David spent 17 years as the Chairman of 
the Shelton Democratic Town Committee, and 
is a longstanding, committed volunteer at Ster-
ling House Community Center food pantry in 
Stratford, the Connecticut Institute for Refu-
gees and Immigrants, and is an active mem-
ber of the Huntington Congregational Church. 
David’s service to his community and to the 
4th Congressional District is commendable 
and an inspiration to all of us. He understands 
the importance of serving one’s community 
and the positive impact it can make on the 
lives of friends, neighbors, and residents. It 
has been a pleasure to work with David and 
I know his service to the town of Shelton and 
the State of Connecticut will continue in his 
next chapter.

HONORING DR. ALEXANDER 
STEMER 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I stand be-
fore you today to honor Dr. Alexander Stemer. 
For his extraordinary work and dedication to 
the study of cardiac care throughout the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Dr. Stemer will be pre-
sented with the American Heart Association’s 
‘‘Heart of Life’’ award at the Heart of Gold 
Gala on Saturday, April 23, 2022, at Avalon 
Manor in Merrillville, Indiana. 
Dr. Alexander Stemer has been an out-
standing physician and a true asset to the 
community of Northwest Indiana and beyond. 
His remarkable career includes numerous ac-
complishments, making him especially worthy 
of this prestigious honor being bestowed upon 
him. Dr. Stemer founded Medical Specialists 
Center of Indiana, which is currently Francis-
can Medical Specialists. In addition, he is the 
founder of Advanced Care Medical Specialists, 
a practice focused on medical care for the ad-
vanced elderly, and he is the Medical Director 
for three extended care facilities. Dr. Stemer 
has also served as Associate Clinical Pro-
fessor of Medicine at the Indiana University 
School of Medicine. A truly dedicated and in-
novative member of the medical community, 
Dr. Stemer has been a pioneer in the area of 
home intravenous therapy and ambulatory in-
fusion therapy. 
Throughout the pandemic, Dr. Stemer has 
been instrumental in the study of COVID–19 
and the effect it has on the cardiovascular 
system. During this unprecedented time, he 
spearheaded infection control programs, de-
veloped protocols for skilled nursing facilities 
and hospitals, and currently serves as co-chair 
for the Symphony Health Network COVID task 
force. Dr. Stemer also assisted the National 
Institutes of Health and Eli Lilly to develop 
study protocols for the prevention and treat-
ment of COVID–19 in skilled nursing facilities 
with the use of monoclonal antibodies. This 
study was approved by the Federal Drug Ad-
ministration and published in the Journal of 
the American Medical Association. In addition, 
Dr. Stemer helped raise over $118,000 for 
COVID relief. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in hon-
oring Dr. Alexander Stemer. For his note-
worthy medical career and his unwavering 
commitment to the study of COVID–19 and 
cardiac care, Dr. Stemer is to be highly com-
mended, and he serves as an inspiration to us 
all.

CELEBRATING THE 200TH 
BIRTHDAY OF PRESIDENT GRANT 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 200th Birthday of the 
18th President of the United States, Ulysses 
S. Grant. President Grant was born in Point 
Pleasant, located in Clermont County in Ohio’s 
2nd Congressional District. 
When he was a child, his family moved to 
Brown County, also in Ohio’s 2nd District, and 
there he was educated before accepting a 
nomination to the United States Military Acad-
emy at West Point. 
Following his commissioning, Grant served 
in the Mexican-American War and most nota-
bly, the Civil War, where he became Com-
manding General of the United States Army in 
1864. 
General Grant oversaw the surrender of 
General Lee at Appomattox Court House and 
served as Commanding General of the Army 
until he was elected President in 1868. He 
served two terms as President from 1869 to 
1877 and oversaw the beginning of the Re-
construction Era in the United States. 
President Grant was widely considered the 
General who ‘‘saved the Union.’’ He was a 
great leader who left his mark on American 
history, and we can all follow his example of 
courage. I am honored to have President 
Grant’s home located in Ohio’s 2nd Congres-
sional district and a landmark of our nation’s 
history.

HONORING 
9–1–1 
DISPATCHERS 
DURING 
NATIONAL 
PUBLIC 
SAFETY 
TELECOMMUNICATORS 
WEEK 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor 9–1–1 dispatchers during 
National Public Safety Telecommunicators 
Week, which runs from April 10th until April 
16th this year. 
Since 1981, the second week in April has 
been designated as National Public Safety 
Telecommunicators Week, so that we can 
honor and celebrate our public safety dis-
patchers, and thank them for the critical work 
that they do on behalf of our communities. 
Public safety telecommunicators are the first 
line of defense in a crisis. Every time a 9–1– 
1 dispatcher answers the phone, the decisions 
they make can be the difference between life 
and death. They are the first, first responders 
in any crisis. 
Without public safety telecommunicators, 
our police, firefighters, and paramedics can’t 
do their jobs. Our emergency response de-
pends on having an expert on the line who 
can accurately convey information, coordinate 
multiple teams of first responders, and help 
ensure the safety of the person on the other 
end of the line. 
Public safety telecommunicators are trained 
to handle any situation in a clear and calm 
manner. They can help someone administer 
CPR, aid someone who is experiencing a 
mental health crisis, respond to crimes in 
progress, and give advice that prevents harm, 
among many other things. 
There should be no doubt that this is a dif-
ficult profession. Dispatchers work long hours. 
They face an extreme emotional and physical 
toll, something that has been compounded by 
the pandemic. As others worked in a virtual 
environment 
during 
COVID, 
dispatchers 
stayed on the job, at the risk of their own 
health and safety, so that they could continue 
helping our communities. And as technology 
and demands have increased, the job has got-
ten more difficult and complicated over time. 
Through it all, dispatchers play a key role in 
public safety, from responding to reports of 
violent crimes, to helping individuals admin-
ister first aid, to addressing reports of missing 
or abducted children. 
When a member of the public calls 9–1–1, 
they are often in a moment of stress or dan-
ger. The person who answers the phone is the 
first person to hear them ask for help, and to 
make sure that they get the assistance they 
need. This job is a critical public service. 
Madam Speaker, as a former 9–1–1 dis-
patcher for more than 17 years, I am proud to 
honor the work of Public Safety Telecommu-
nicators here in the House of Representatives.

INTRODUCTION OF HOUSE RESO-
LUTION TO RECOGNIZE THE AC-
COMPLISHMENTS 
AND 
CON-
TRIBUTIONS 
OF 
VIETNAMESE 
AMERICANS 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, today, I am 
introducing a House Resolution recognizing 
the accomplishments and contributions of Viet-
namese Americans. The United States is 
home to the largest number of individuals of 
Vietnamese descent outside of Vietnam, and I 
represent the largest Vietnamese communities 
in the nation in Orange County, California. Vi-
etnamese is also the 5th most spoken lan-
guage in the United States. I am proud to rec-
ognize the valuable contribution of over 2 mil-
lion Vietnamese Americans living in this na-
tion. 
In the aftermath of the Vietnam War, ap-
proximately 800,000 Vietnamese refugees 
fleeing persecution resettled in the United 
States. Today, Vietnamese Americans con-
tribute to American society through their work 
in business, education, science and tech-
nology, engineering, mathematics, literature 
and the arts, gastronomy, the armed forces, 
and public service at every level of govern-
ment. 
Vietnamese Americans add to the rich cul-
tural and religious diversity of our nation. As a 
member of the Congressional Vietnam Cau-
cus, it is critical that we continue to represent 
and 
celebrate 
our 
Vietnamese 
families, 
friends, and neighbors, and recognize their 
significant contributions to American society.

April 14, 2022 
the 2021 Guam Department of Education 
(GDOE) Teacher of the Year, and further rec-
ognize him for continuing his reign as the 
2022 GDOE Teacher of the Year. Dr. 
Santiago is an exemplary teacher whose com-
mitment to service and devotion to community 
have and continue to inspire our youth, foster 
great leadership, and expand opportunities for 
our island students to lead successful lives. 
The Teacher of the Year Program is the old-
est and most prestigious national honors pro-
gram focused on recognizing excellence in 
teaching. Providing a platform for highlighting 
both the extraordinary work and dedication of 
educators across the country and the impor-
tance of quality education in the futures of our 
youth, island, and nation, this program has 
uniquely directed community accolades to out-
standing teachers in Guam since 1969. Fol-
lowing a rigorous nomination, evaluation, and 
observation process, Dr. Santiago was award-
ed the honor from among six finalists. 
Dr. Santiago first discovered his passion for 
teaching when he took on roles as an instruc-
tor at cultural dance academies and a local fit-
ness organization. Embracing his calling to 
help others on their personal paths of achieve-
ment, he navigated an extensive teaching ca-
reer that has resulted in what is now 27 years 
with GDOE. In 1993, Dr. Santiago earned his 
Bachelor of Arts in Secondary Education from 
the University of Guam. He then went on to 
earn his master’s and doctoral degrees in edu-
cation and educational leadership from the 
University of Portland and Argosy university 
respectively. Today, Dr. Santiago celebrates 
over 15 years of service to students and col-
leagues as a cultural dance and journalism 
teacher at Agueda I. Johnston Middle School. 
As demonstrated by his countless achieve-
ments, Dr. Santiago has consistently gone 
above and beyond his duties within the school 
system. In addition to collaborative curriculum 
and intervention development for holistic stu-
dent success, Dr. Santiago has served as an 
in-house mentor for new teachers, coordinated 
cultural events for his school community, and 
successfully trained a school choir to earn 3 
gold medals in a CHamoru language competi-
tion. Further, he is a trailblazing force that has 
created curricula for Cultural Arts and Dance 
for all secondary grade levels, introduced a 
new method to simultaneously teach cultural 
dance to both face-to-face and online learners 
amid the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, and 
developed a new CHamoru language program 
with support from local government agencies. 
Most impressive, however, is his personal un-
dertaking to establish deeper understanding 
and awareness of cultural concepts as an in-
herent part of Guam’s public education. 
On behalf of the People of Guam, I would 
like to extend a sincere congratulations to Dr. 
Benjamin Santiago. His combined approach to 
advocate for both students and culture both 
challenges the traditional definitions of learn-
ing and success within the four walls of a 
classroom and better equips our youth to pur-
sue any endeavor they dare to dream. Dr. 
Santiago’s perseverance, ingenuity, and zeal 
to secure the best for our students encap-
sulates the limitless potential available to com-
munities that work together in service of each 
other, and I wish him the best on the rest of 
his professional journey. 
MARVIN RANDLE RETIREMENT 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Marvin Randle, the former 
mayor of Irving. Marvin lives every day, from 
his time as Mayor to serving Oak View Baptist 
Church for over 65 years, wanting to make 
this city better. He is always looking for ways 
to get more involved and lend a hand. 
Marvin’s Irving legacy, beyond dedicated serv-
ice, is one filled with smiles, kindness, and 
generosity. He is beloved for his fish fries for 
Irving Heritage Society and hamburger cook-
outs to support Irving Police Department. 
As one of Irving’s proudest champions, he 
has spent his life in the city he loves, growing 
his family business here, and raising his chil-
dren to live their lives with the same sense of 
community and dedication to public service. 
Under his leadership, the Irving Arts Board 
was established, giving young artists in our 
city the support they need. He also saw the 
beauty in our city and during his tenure started 
the Tourist and Convention Bureau, making Ir-
ving a destination city to millions. 
Marvin is a proud small business owner, 
founding Irving Counter Top in 1962 and cre-
ating over 1,200 jobs for North Texans. Irving 
Counter Top’s success has enabled Marvin to 
support and sponsor numerous sports teams 
and charity organizations. While serving as 
President of Irving Homebuilders Association, 
Chairman of Irving Centennial Committee, 
President of Dallas Area Homebuilders, and a 
Member of the Texas Municipal League, many 
groups benefit from Marvin’s leadership across 
our community. 
Marvin and his wife, Bobbie are longtime 
friends and mentors. It is an honor to help cel-
ebrate such a full and impactful career and 
legacy, as Marvin retires this month. I thank 
Marvin for his great contributions to our local 
government and the impact he has made, as 
he helps shape our community.

RECOGNIZING MAYOR KAREN 
ALEXANDER 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Mayor Karen Alexander of Salis-
bury, North Carolina, for her leadership to both 
the City of Salisbury and the North Carolina 
League of Municipalities. 
For over a century, the North Carolina 
League of Municipalities has worked tirelessly 
to advance the interests of member cities and 
towns across the state. This past year, the 
League tasked Mayor Alexander with leading 
its 35-member Board of Directors as their 
President. 
Public service and leadership are nothing 
new to Mayor Alexander. Ever since she was 
elected a Salisbury City Councilwoman in 
2013, she has been a pervasive force in her 
hometown’s municipal government. In her 
roles on the city council, Mayor Alexander has 
responsibly pursued revitalization efforts to 
prepare the historic town for future challenges 
while simultaneously leaning into its rich herit-
age. Her efforts to attract new businesses, re-
store 
downtown 
building 
facades, 
and 
incentivize urban revitalization have fostered a 
renaissance of local pride and community co-
hesion throughout the city. I personally have 
had the immense pleasure of working along-
side Mayor Alexander. In witnessing her work, 
I have been impressed by her sharp mind, 
perceptive instincts, and enormous heart. 
During her tenure as League President, 
Mayor Alexander has been instrumental in de-
veloping new and creative ways for the 
League to advocate for North Carolina’s cities 
and towns. Under her direction during the 
height of the global COVID–19 pandemic, the 
League has witnessed record-high event at-
tendance thanks to Mayor Alexander’s leader-
ship in rolling out expanded online tools and 
webinars. Other contributions Mayor Alex-
ander has made to the League are more tan-
gible. As an architect by trade, Mayor Alex-
ander was uniquely positioned to play a piv-
otal role in rebuilding the League’s office 
space. Following a devastating fire in 2017 
that consumed their longtime office buildings 
in Raleigh, the League tapped Mayor Alex-
ander to serve on their building committee. 
Under her guidance as President, plans are 
being set in motion to develop a new facility 
to ensure North Carolina’s cities and towns 
have a permanent home for extraordinary ad-
vocacy. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking 
Mayor Karen Alexander for her generous spirit 
and invaluable management. Both the City of 
Salisbury and the North Carolina League of 
Municipalities have benefited immensely from 
her years of impactful service. I am sure they 
both will be blessed by the fruits of her leader-
ship for years to come.

HONORING MIKE MURASE 
HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mr. Mike Murase for his outstanding 
service on behalf of people of color, women, 
young people, seniors, and other disadvan-
taged members of society. Later today, the Lit-
tle Tokyo Service Center in downtown Los An-
geles will honor Mike Murase upon his retire-
ment. 
Mike Murase has been an activist leader in 
the Japanese American national civil rights 
movement for more than 50 years. 
Mr. Murase moved from Japan to Los Ange-
les when he was just 9 years old after multiple 
visits to Hiroshima with his parents to witness 
the destruction of the world’s first atomic 
bomb; visits which had a profound effect upon 
his social activism for the rest of his life. Mr. 
Murase was an early opponent of U.S. in-
volvement in the Vietnam conflict and was a 
leader in Asian American opposition to the 
war. 
He co-founded Gidra, a landmark Japanese 
American Movement publication, when he was 
an undergraduate at the University of Cali-
fornia at Los Angeles (UCLA), where he also 
helped create the Asian American Studies 
Center.

Mr. Murase graduated from the Gould 
School of Law at the University of Southern 
California (USC) and taught some of the early 
ethnic studies classes at UCLA, USC, and 
California State University Long Beach. 
Mr. Murase was a member and leader of 
such seminal organizations as Asian Ameri-
cans for Nuclear Disarmament, the Little 
Tokyo Peoples Rights Organization, the Na-
tional Coalition for Redress/Reparations, Unity 
Los Angeles, and the California Rainbow Coa-
lition. He was Rev. Jesse Jackson’s deputy 
field coordinator and the California Asian 
American Coordinator in Rev. Jackson’s 1984 
presidential run; and the California Campaign 
director for Rev. Jackson’s 1988 effort. 
Mike Murase was the District Director of my 
Congressional office for 13 years where he 
worked tirelessly with countless community 
service organizations, improving their inter-
action with the Federal government. He was a 
highly skilled manager who was also an ex-
tremely talented graphics designer, writer, 
public speaker, and organizer, who, utilizing all 
of his skill set, led and trained my staff mag-
nificently. He knew my district well and was 
able to meet challenges of every type, cre-
ating positive outcomes on many levels. 
Mr. Murase was instrumental in organizing 
the California Rainbow Coalition after serving 
on the Rainbow Coalition’s national board. He 
was chair of the Los Angeles Free South Afri-
ca Movement from 1986 to 1988, helped 
Quincy Jones and myself produce the city- 
wide welcoming reception for Nelson Mandela 
attended by 79,000 people at the Los Angeles 
Coliseum in 1990, and was an observer to the 
African National Congress conference in 
South Africa in 1991. 
Mike Murase is retiring after 16 years on the 
Executive Staff of the Little Tokyo Service 
Center, a vital social service and community 
economic development agency serving the 
Japanese American community throughout 
Los Angeles. It is a highly respected organiza-
tion, which he helped found in 1979. He also 
served as Board President for its first five 
years. 
Amongst his other duties as the Director of 
Service Programs for the Center, Mr. Murase 
was the Terasaki Budokan Campaign Director 
and successfully opened a significant commu-
nity athletic center in Little Tokyo. 
Mike Murase is a published author and an 
accomplished photographer, speaks fluent 
Japanese, and is a favorite interview subject 
of young Asian American activists. His impor-
tance to numerous cultural and political move-
ments in our country cannot be overstated. I 
congratulate Mike upon his retirement from the 
Little Tokyo Service Center and look forward 
to his next endeavors.

RECOGNIZING THE CHRISTOPHER 
COLUMBUS HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA 
CLUB ON THEIR SUPERLATIVE 
PERFORMANCE AT THE FLORIDA 
STATE THESPIAN FESTIVAL

OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Drama Club at Christopher 
Columbus High School, my alma mater. On 
March 16–19 of 2022, the Columbus Drama 
Club participated in the Florida State Thespian 
Festival in Tampa. Their performance was ex-
ceptional—the CCHS Drama Club scored six 
Superiors. 
In the first Festival since the beginning of 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic, 
the 
Explorers 
achieved a Superior grade in each of the six 
presentations they submitted. This remarkable 
feat is only the second time in Columbus High 
School’s history that the Drama Club won a 
Superior in all its presentations, and the first 
time in eight years. 
I would like specifically to congratulate 
Christian Wilson, David Figueredo, Tobias 
Reyes, Joaquim Carvalho, Michael Remy, 
Miguel Ramirez, Christopher Ramos, Nicholas 
Sutton, Gabriel Vergara, Matthew Gory, Austin 
Garcia-Hall, 
Alexander 
Valcarcel, 
Victor 
Barreda and Sebastian Arana. The Drama 
Club was led by Ms. Erin McGrath, who de-
serves a hearty commendation for their suc-
cess. 
Acting brings so much joy to our lives. No 
doubt these talented and hard-working Explor-
ers-Thespians will go far in their artistic en-
deavors. I also congratulate the CCHS student 
body, staff, and especially the parents of the 
Drama Club students, for their part in this dis-
tinguished achievement. I look forward to con-
tinuing to witness our school make history. 
Forward (adelante).

Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. 
Schneerson’s global campaign to educate 
young people about our responsibility to be a 
just and compassionate society. 
On April 12, 2022, we celebrated the 120th 
birthday of the Rebbe, one of the most influen-
tial Jewish leaders of the 20th century. Under 
his leadership, he was committed to inculcate 
young people with deep ethical and moral val-
ues, promote compassion, and celebrate our 
diversity to create a healthy society. His trans-
formational vision has left lasting contributions 
of acts of goodness and kindness—even a 
positive act of an individual can make a major 
impact in the world. 
In El Paso, the Acts of Random Kindness 
(ARK) Giving Project provides school children 
with small giving boxes in the shape of an ark. 
They are encouraged to fill them every day 
with small amounts of money and donate the 
collected money to a worthy cause. This is a 
profound lesson in education. The County of 
El Paso have also launched a similar cam-
paign with all their employees, in the spirit of 
leading by example, thereby nurturing a more 
compassionate society by turning Acts of Ran-
dom Kindness into Acts of Routine Kindness. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in calling 
people for a better, brighter, and hopeful fu-
ture for all by nurturing our inherent goodness. 
HONORING BECKY ZASECK FOR 
HER SERVICE TO HOOSIERS 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the remarkable service of 
Becky Zaseck as she retires after dedicating 
36 years to REAL Services. In nearly four dec-
ades, Becky touched the lives of countless 
Hoosiers across our region. 
Based in South Bend, REAL Services pro-
vides programs that promote nutrition, self-suf-
ficiency, education, and protection for 30,000 
people in northern Indiana each year. As 
President and CEO of REAL Services since 
2007, Becky has been instrumental in leading 
this robust organization as it administers more 
than 25 programs and serves 12 counties 
across northern Indiana. 
Before taking the helm of REAL Services, 
Becky directed the agency’s work to serve 
older Hoosiers for 17 years. In 1986, she first 
began her career at REAL Services as a pro-
gram consultant with the state of Indiana help-
ing to establish the organization’s family devel-
opment program, which helps families become 
financially self-sufficient. 
Becky is truly a leader in her field and has 
served as a role model for so many in Indiana 
and beyond. Her legacy of compassionate 
service and expertise is widespread. In past 
years, Becky was a delegate to the White 
House Conference on Aging, and she served 
as a member of the Indiana Commission on 
Autism. 
In recognition of her amazing accomplish-
ments, Becky has received the Sagamore of 
the Wabash Award from Governor O’Bannon, 
the Trailblazer Award by the Indiana Commis-
sion on Women, the YWCA’s Woman of the 
Year, the Hoosier of Distinction Award from 
Governor Daniels, the Athena Award from the 
Chamber of Commerce, and Distinguished 
Alumnus 
from 
Leadership 
South 
Bend/ 
Mishawaka, among many other recognitions. 
Becky is a cherished community leader who 
has dedicated her life to serving the vulner-
able. As she looks ahead to the next chapter, 
I thank Becky for her servant leadership and 
for her steadfast commitment to our neigh-
bors. On behalf of Indiana’s Second Congres-
sional District, it is my privilege to honor Becky 
Zaseck for her vast contributions to our region 
and wish her all the best in the years ahead.

PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM BIG 
OIL PRICE GOUGING 
HON. RO KHANNA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD the following letter from Professor 
Andru Volinsky, on behalf of students in the 
Sociology Law and Public course at Franklin 
Pierce University in New Hampshire. These 
students highlight why Congress should pass 
the Big Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act, my bill 
with Senator SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, to protect 
consumers from price gouging from giant oil 
companies.

STOP SUBSIDIES TO OIL COMPANIES 
The American people are being hosed at 
the pump. It’s time to end oil subsidies that 
benefit shareholders and invest in green en-
ergy that benefits America’s young people. 
Like other low-income Americans, we col-
lege students are financially struggling to 
fill our gas tanks with the recent 55.4% in-
crease in fuel prices reported by the Amer-
ican Automobile Association. 
Meanwhile, CNBC reported the price per 
barrel decreased by 8%. ConocoPhillips, 
Chevron and Exxon Mobil saw profit in-
creases of 1,400%, 184% and 57%, respectively, 
last year over pre-COVID profits. Price- 
gouging at the pump is unacceptable for the 
most-profitable corporations and the most 
heavily tax-subsidized industry in the United 
States. 
Conservative estimates put U.S. direct tax 
subsidies to the fossil fuel industry at ap-
proximately $20 billion per year. Exxon 
Mobil receives one of the largest tax sub-
sidies ($4 billion a year) and has reported sec-
ond-quarter earnings of $44.9 billion for this 
fiscal year. Shareholders of Exxon Mobil are 
filling their wallets while taxpayers are 
struggling to fill their gas tanks. 
Fuel industry subsidies were created to 
lower the cost of fossil fuel production and 
incentivize new domestic energy sources, not 
increase the profits of shareholders. It’s time 
we end fuel industry tax subsidies and invest 
in new green energy sources for the future. 
Demand an increase in solar tax credits and 
incentives for mitigating climate change 
that benefits the American people. It’s time 
to free the American people from their de-
pendency on oil and invest in our future. 
ANDRU VOLINSKY, 
Concord.

TRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF 
DENVER’S 
MEN’S 
ICE 
HOCKEY 
TEAM 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the University of Den-
ver’s Men’s Hockey team on winning the 2022 
National Collegiate Athletic Association Divi-
sion I Men’s Ice Hockey Championship. 
It’s the ninth time that the University of Den-
ver Pioneers have won the Frozen Four 
Championship. After a tremendous 2021–2022 
season where the team recorded 31 wins, 9 
losses and 1 tie, the University of Denver Pio-
neers are now tied for the most all-time NCAA 
National Hockey Championships, and only the 
second team in NCAA history that has won 
the championship nine times. 
On Saturday, April 9, 2022, the DU men’s 
ice hockey team defeated the Minnesota State 
University Mavericks 5–1 to win this year’s 
championship. Pioneers goaltender Magnus 
Chrona was widely credited for making 27 
saves in the championship game, holding the 
Mavericks to just one score and giving his 
team a chance to take the lead in the third pe-
riod. 
It was then that Senior Ryan Barrow, Brett 
Stapley and Cameron Wright, along with 
Sophomore Mike Benning and Freshman 
Massimo Rizzo each scored for the Pioneers 
to seal the 5–1 victory and the school’s first 
championship since 2017. 
For his remarkable play throughout the se-
ries, Denver’s Mike Benning was named the 
tournament’s Most Outstanding Player. He, 
along with Denver’s Goalie Magnus Chrona 
and Forwards Carter Savoie and Ryan Bar-
row, were also named as members of this 
year’s all-tournament team. 
Winning doesn’t come easy. And for many 
of the players on this year’s championship 
team, Saturday’s victory was the culmination 
of a lifetime of hard work and dedication to 
their sport. It’s also a testament, not only to 
the talent and skill of every player on this 
year’s championship team, but to the Univer-
sity of Denver itself—and the incredible culture 
they have created there. 
What made this year’s team so special was 
that every single player gave everything they 
had to help their team win. That collective 
spirit is a credit to Pioneers’ Head Coach 
David Carle and his entire staff, who deserve 
a tremendous amount of credit for what this 
team has accomplished. 
At age 32, Head Coach David Carle is now 
the fourth youngest head coach ever to win an 
NCAA Division I Men’s Hockey champion-
ship—and our entire community cannot wait to 
see what he and the entire program accom-
plish next. 
I know all my colleagues in the House and 
Senate join me in congratulating the University 
of Denver Men’s Hockey team for a remark-
able season and an incredible ninth national 
championship victory this past weekend.

TRIBUTE IN MEMORY OF LEONARD 
LAWSON 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of 
Leonard Lawson, my long-time friend and 
trusted advisor, who literally moved mountains 
in Kentucky and our neighboring states. 
Leonard’s astute business leadership and 
savvy partnerships led to his rise as a giant in 
the transportation industry, becoming a leader 
across the Commonwealth and nationally-re-
nowned among industry experts for the com-
panies he built to transform Kentucky and be-
yond. In fact, his companies’ portfolios include 
more than $10 billion in highway and airport 
infrastructure projects across Kentucky, Ten-
nessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Indiana, and 
Ohio, including interstate construction and wid-
ening projects, working with the U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers, and completing local de-
velopment projects. 
Although his success was widely applauded 
and criticized by the media over the years, 
Leonard was a very private man who came 
from humble beginnings. He grew up without 
many resources, and he and his wife, Bonnie, 
were both proud graduates of the Red Bird 
Christian School, a small private school nes-
tled in the Appalachian Mountains of Clay 
County, Kentucky. Struggling to sustain the 
costs of operating such a courageous mission 
at the school, the Lawsons raised and do-
nated enough money to reopen its doors, en-
suring future students could live in the dor-
mitory throughout high school, as Bonnie did. 
The Red Bird Christian School became one of 
many 
philanthropic 
endeavors 
that 
the 
Lawsons invested in. Before being diagnosed 
with cancer, Leonard generated enough funds 
to start and eventually expand the Leonard 
Lawson Cancer Center at Pikeville Medical 
Center. Last year alone, his generosity helped 
provide treatment to nearly 3,600 patients who 
otherwise would have driven hours for the 
same medical care. Despite losing his own 
battle with cancer, I am confident that his leg-
acy cancer center will extend lifesaving hope 
to countless patients in the future. 
Many of us dream of ways to win the tire-
less war on poverty and how to change the 
course of generational challenges in Ken-
tucky’s Appalachian region, but Leonard skill-
fully managed to do his part to make a lasting 
difference and systemically impacted access 
to better roads and much-needed medical 
care in the mountains. 
Eastern Kentucky will be a different place 
without him. I’II miss our fishing trips and cast-
ing visionary plans together to help our be-
loved home region. Leonard’s small stature 
could not contain the insurmountable hope he 
had for a brighter future in southern and east-
ern Kentucky. He leaves behind an expansive 
legacy that will live on in the mountains of 
Eastern Kentucky for many years. My wife, 
Cynthia, and I extend our deepest heartfelt 
condolences to Bonnie and the entire Lawson 
family.

HONORING DANIEL M. GEB’S 80TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 14, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Daniel Geb of Allen 
Park, Michigan, on the occasion of his 80th 
Birthday. His continued service to our commu-
nity is worthy of commendation. 
Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, he is 
a graduate of John Pershing High School. A 
proud Teamster, he worked at Hudson’s until 
his retirement. A well-known activist in South-
east Michigan, Mr. Geb was invited to join the 
Michigan Committee to Protection Pensions in 
the fight to protect hard-earned Teamster re-
tiree pensions. He travelled all over the coun-
try with the committee, including throughout 
the Midwest and to the Nation’s capital to ad-
vocate for his union brothers and sisters. De-
scribed by his peers as a true fighter, whether 
it’s in conversations with heavy-hitter legisla-
tors or battling health issues, Dan always per-
severes and comes out on top. 
No stranger to Michigan politics, Mr. Geb is 
a friend to many elected officials and advo-
cates in our State. President of the Allen Park 
Democratic Club, he has an unmatched mem-
ory for historic political events and has at-
tended numerous conventions and events 
through his life. According to his friends, he 
knows more representatives, has been to, and 
remembers the time, the dates, the people 
there, and the outcome of political events bet-
ter than anyone. There hasn’t been a person 
who has met Dan that didn’t like him; his 
warmth, kindness, and passion for his country 
shines through with everything that he does, 
and we are truly lucky to have him in our 
downriver community. A lifelong Michigander, 
Mr. Geb continues to reside in Allen Park, 
Michigan.

RELATING 
TO 
THE 
CONSIDER-
ATION OF HOUSE REPORT 117–284 
AND AN ACCOMPANYING RESO-
LUTION 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the rule to consider the Res-
olution Recommending That the House of 
Representatives Find Peter K. Navarro and 
Daniel Scavino, Jr., In Contempt Of Congress 
For Refusal To Comply With Subpoenas Duly 
Issued By The Select Committee To Inves-
tigate The January 6th Attack On The United 
States Capitol. 
Mr. Speaker, the events that took place on 
January 6, 2021, constituted an insurrection. A 
mob of deluded and misguided individuals, in-
spired by the former President, stormed the 
Capitol attempting to interrupt the certification 
of a legitimate election. 
Five people died that day and around 140 
were injured. The damage to our democracy 
and republic was just as stark, as the maraud-
ers tried to halt our long-standing tradition of 
peaceful transfers of power. 
Our history of peaceful transfers of power 
serve as a model to the world of what a rep-
resentative democracy should look like. But all 
that hard work done by generations of 
Congresspeople and staff alike was vulnerable 
that afternoon. 
That stain on our national identity and inter-
national image was by publicly known indica-
tions coordinated by the narcissistic authori-
tarian who was allowed to occupy the Oval Of-
fice, with Peter Navarro and Daniel Scavino, 
Jr., among the key lieutenants trying to imple-
ment that effort. 
Both Navarro and Scavino played key roles 
in the former President’s attempt to override 
the election, with Navarro even publishing a 
book about his efforts. 
The plan, as Navarro described it, was to 
have members of Congress debate the elec-
toral results from six contested swing states 
for four hours each, after which Congress 
would declare the results to be disputed, lead-
ing to the House selecting the president based 
on each congressional delegation getting one 
vote. 
Since Republicans controlled more delega-
tions than Democrats, Navarro assumed this 
would probably lead to Trump’s re-election. 
In a January 2022 MSNBC interview, 
Navarro said the former President was in favor 
of his plan and that they had ‘‘more than 100’’ 
members of Congress on board. 
If that is not a damning admission of guilt, 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t know what is. 
It is no surprise Navarro was subpoenaed, 
and even less a surprise that he didn’t show 
up. He suggested that his absence was rooted 
in executive privilege, but even that is a false 
premise, 
Navarro has blatantly ignored the Supreme 
Court’s ruling in United States v. Nixon (1974) 
in which the Court held that presidential com-
munications of the type in question are not 
within the scope of executive privilege. Addi-
tionally, President Biden has confirmed that 
Navarro’s executive privilege does not apply in 
this instance, but Navarro still won’t show up 
on his own accord. 
We, therefore, must hold Navarro account-
able for his role on January 6th and fully pros-
ecute him. 
As for Mr. Scavino, the January 6th Com-
mittee found he had worked with Mr. Trump to 
spread false information via social media re-
garding election fraud and had recruited a 
crowd to Washington on Jan. 6. 
The committee said it had ‘‘reason to be-
lieve’’ Mr. Scavino, whose subpoena was 
served at Mar-a-Lago, the former president’s 
property in Palm Beach, Fla., was with Trump 
on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6 in 2021 when plans were 
discussed to ‘‘challenge, disrupt, or impede 
the official congressional proceedings.’’ He 
also was with Trump while people trapped in-
side the Capitol were urgently calling on the 
president to halt the violence. 
The committee said it ‘‘has reason to be-
lieve that Mr. Scavino may have had advance 
warning about the potential for violence on 
Jan. 6,’’ because he was known to monitor 
pro-Trump websites where plans to commit vi-
olence were discussed. 
The committee has sought Mr. Scavino’s 
testimony since September, when it issued 
him a subpoena. The panel said it delayed Mr. 
Scavino’s deposition six times to try to accom-
modate him. 
Mr. Scavino sued Verizon in January—at 
first, anonymously—seeking to stop the com-
pany from turning over his phone records to 
the committee. 
Mr. Scavino’s actions are incredibly dis-
turbing, and considering the committee’s find-
ings, he too must be held accountable and 
fully prosecuted. 
It is for that reason, Mr. Speaker, I strongly 
support this resolution and urge my col-
leagues’ support as well. This resolution reaf-
firms our commitment to accountability no 
matter the title, so I am proud to lend it my 
support.
