PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Mighty God, as conflict rages across 
the globe, we lift our prayers for those 
countries at arms. Our hearts hurt to 
hear of the horrific violence, and our 
souls ache for the victims of such hate. 
Our plea this day is that of the 
psalmist who prayed that all people 
would turn to You in prayer and praise. 
May this spur them toward peace. May 
it compel each not just to cease fire, 
but to put down their weapons and find 
a way toward resolving all grievances. 
O God, then would the nations be 
glad. In You would they once again 
find reason to sing for joy. 
As You look out over the world, You 
judge us with Your inimitable fairness; 
would that all the ends of the Earth 
heed Your guidance. 
In bringing our prayers for reconcili-
ation and justice before You, we ask 
that the nations may know Your bless-
ing. In You may the peoples of the 
world know Your peace. 
Lord be gracious to us and once again 
make Your face to shine upon us. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

HONORING BARRY PUMP AND ALL 
MEMBERS 
OF 
HOUSE 
FLOOR 
STAFF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 21, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to say thank you to all the men and 
women of the House floor who execute their 
duties flawlessly and anonymously so Mem-
bers of Congress can dispatch the important 
business of the people we are privileged to 
represent effectively and efficiently. 
We would not be able to discharge the du-
ties vested in us by the Constitution were it 
not for the reporters, floor clerks, journal 
clerks, reading clerks, bill clerks, and Parlia-
mentarian staff who daily provide indispen-
sable customer service to the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Their job just got a little harder because I 
am sad to report that Barry Pump, one of the 
Clerks of Debate, has been appointed parlia-
mentarian of the House Committee on Home-
land Security and will be relinquishing his floor 
staff position after 7 years of faithful and flaw-
less service, and a total of 9 years of dedi-
cated service as an employee of the Clerk of 
the House. 
Ask anyone about Barry Pump and you will 
get story after story attesting to his intel-
ligence, knowledge of floor procedure, commit-
ment to accurate and truthful report, and re-
lentless attention to detail. 
This House is a better place because of ex-
traordinary floor staff personnel like Barry 
Pump. 
Madam Speaker, we wish Barry well in his 
new position as parliamentarian for the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security, and as a senior 
member of the committee, I am happy to learn 
that is the Homeland Security Committee to 
which Barry will take his considerable skills 
and talents.

IN MEMORY OF TOM COWIE 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 21, 2021 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and remember the life of Tom Cowie, 
a dedicated father and a passionate member 
of the greater Plymouth community. In Depth 
NH, a local New Hampshire newspaper, pub-
lished an obituary of my friend Tom that I in-
clude in the RECORD: 
CENTER
HARBOR, NH.—Thomas William 
Cowie, 68, longtime Plymouth attorney and 
community volunteer died March 22, 2021, at 
home following a 10-week bout with meta-
static lung cancer. 
He leaves his wife of 32 years, Paula Tracy, 
and their daughter, Eliza Cowie of Boulder 
Colorado, two brothers, Paul Cowie and 
Peter Cowie, and their families in Truckee, 
California, and Fayetteville, N.Y. respec-
tively. 
Born October 10, 1952, to Barbara Ann 
(Olhoff) Cowie and Walter T. Cowie in Syra-
cuse, N.Y., he lived in Barre Vt., Fayette-
ville, NY, and spent summers on Big Moose 
Lake in the Adirondacks before graduating 
from Fayetteville-Manlius High School in 
New York in 1971. 
At Ohio Wesleyan University (OWU), where 
he received his bachelor’s degree in political 
science in 1975, Tom played lacrosse. He be-
came the team’s captain in his senior year 
and was a leading scorer for all four years. 
His senior team went on to play in the NCAA 
playoffs. Tom was chosen by the United 
States International Lacrosse Association to 
play in the national North-South All-Star 
Lacrosse Game at Cornell University in 1975. 
It featured the best senior lacrosse players in 
the nation. And although not an official col-
lege statistic, Tom was also known for hav-
ing the best long, blonde ponytail sticking 
out of his helmet. 
His joy was being outside, whether it was 
waterskiing, skiing, paddling or driving 
friends and family for a cruise around Squam 
Lake. To relax, Tom would often play the 
piano. He could sight-read any song and par-
ticularly enjoyed playing Christmas music, 
sung at annual gatherings with family 
friends. 
His favorite place in the world was the Adi-
rondacks at his childhood summer home 
‘‘Sunset’’ a classic Earl Covey designed camp 
on Big Moose Lake’s Crag Point where he 
and his brothers spent endless summer days 
and participated in the lake association’s an-
nual waterski shows. 
After college, he spent several years in 
Truckee, California, enjoying skiing and hik-
ing, and learned the art of stonemasonry 
along the shores of Lake Tahoe. He partici-
pated in the Sierra-Tahoe Pro Ski Circuit in 
1977 and 1978 and thru-hiked the 186-mile 
Tahoe-Yosemite Trail during his time there. 
Tom enjoyed all forms of sport, including 
tennis, softball, and golf. He tried parachute 
jumping and learned the sport of curling in 
Plymouth last year. After moving to the 
Plymouth area in the early 1980s to join his 
cousin, Bill Cowie, in sales, he took graduate 
courses at Plymouth State University. 
After being urged to consider the practice 
of law, he enrolled at the former Franklin 
Pierce Law Center in Concord, now UNH 
School of Law, and received his Juris Doctor 
of law degree in 1986. He then entered the 
general 
practice 
of 
law 
with 
Ross 
V. 
Deachman 
in 
Plymouth 
in 
1987, 
later 
partnering to become the current firm of 
Deachman & Cowie, P.A. 
For Tom, the practice of law was always 
about helping others solve their problems 
and being part of a small-town community. 
His law practice was what he described as 
‘‘country law’’ and it involved many chari-
table efforts. At the state level, Tom volun-
teered his legal services in the New Hamp-
shire Bar Association Pro Bono Program, of-
fering free legal advice to those in need and 
served on the New Hampshire Bar Associa-
tion Board of Governors as a Grafton County 
Governor and then as a Governor-at-Large 
from 1991 to 1996. 
He also served on the Board of Directors of 
Speare Memorial Hospital in Plymouth. 
In 1987, at Cannon Mountain in Franconia, 
NH, he met Paula Tracy as a single in the T- 
bar lift line. They went on to marry in 1988 
and together enjoyed many years of skiing 
with their daughter, Eliza. 
A long-time resident of Rumney N.H., Tom 
served on numerous boards, including 12 
years on the Rumney School Board, begin-
ning in 1997. In addition to serving on a num-
ber of social service agencies concerned with 
child welfare in the Pemi-Baker area, Tom 
worked to foster a love of local nature, in-
cluding years serving on the Quincy Bog 
Board of Directors. He served for almost a 
decade as a member of the Board of Trustees 
at the Squam Lakes Natural Sciences Center 
in Holderness and at the time of his death, 
he was the Board’s secretary. 
His love of lacrosse never left him and that 
love enriched others in the Plymouth area 
because of his efforts to establish high school 
lacrosse teams at Plymouth Regional High 
School (PRHS). He volunteered to coach la-
crosse, first at Plymouth State University as 
an assistant coach of the men’s varsity team 
in the mid-1980s, then for boys in the inde-
pendent White Mountain Wolves league. 
With a group of others, he campaigned and 
advocated for the creation of a high school 
lacrosse program at PRHS. While it took 
more than a few tries to get the votes at the 
school district meeting, the program was es-
tablished in 2008. 
Tom was asked to coach the first PRHS 
women’s team with Maureen Wentzell and by 
the second year of their coaching, the team 
won the Division III state championship in 
2011. He continued to play lacrosse in the 
summers with fellow OWU alumni at the 
Summit Lacrosse tournaments in Lake Plac-
id, N.Y. with his last tournament participa-
tion in 2004. 
Tom had a strong faith in a higher power 
and he remained thankful, loving, humorous, 
forgiving, and forever hopeful till the end. 
His family wishes to thank the teams at 
Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in 
Lebanon and Lakes Region VNA in Meredith. 
Their exceptional care and kindness allowed 
him to pass away at home with grace and 
comfort.

TRIBUTE TO RABBI IAN S. 
JACKNIS 
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 21, 2021 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to Rabbi Ian S. Jacknis who, 
after 28 years is retiring as Rabbi of the South 
Huntington Jewish Center. His dedicated and 
compassionate tenure as Rabbi has touched 
the lives of many in his congregation through 
the years. He is admired by many and I join 
his congregation in wishing him the best as he 
moves on to the next chapter in his life. 
I include in the RECORD the following tribute 
to Rabbi Jacknis that was prepared by the 
South Huntington Jewish Center: 
On the Occasion of the Retirement of 
Rabbi Ian S. Jacknis as Rabbi of the South 
Huntington Jewish Center, celebrating his 
28th anniversary as our beloved Rabbi, we 
honor Rabbi Jacknis for his excellence and

service to his congregation and the Melville 
community. We hereby recognize and ac-
knowledge his tenure as Rabbi by sharing 
some of his biography and contributions. 
Rabbi Jacknis brought his love of Judaism 
and unique blend of warmth and spirituality 
to the South Huntington Jewish Center in 
the summer of 1993, and quickly became 
known, both inside the synagogue and 
throughout the surrounding communities, as 
being welcoming, responsive, insightful and 
compassionate. During his tenure he has fos-
tered a renewed feeling of unity and enthu-
siasm in the congregation, as well as a 
marked increase in membership. Shabbat 
services, especially, are infused with his spe-
cial spirit, and he has brought a variety of 
new initiatives to SHJC. 
Rabbi Jacknis is highly respected by his 
congregants and his peers. He is a Past 
President of the Rabbinical Assembly of Nas-
sau-Suffolk as well as the Suffolk Council of 
Jewish Organizations. The Rabbi also serves 
as the Jewish Chaplain to the Melville Fire 
Department. 
Rabbi Jacknis attended the undergraduate 
Joint Program of the Jewish Theological 
Seminary of America and Columbia Univer-
sity, receiving two bachelor’s degrees in 1977. 
He later attended the Seminary’s Rabbinical 
School, taking classes at the University of 
Judaism (now the American Jewish Univer-
sity) in Los Angeles, at Neve Schechter in 
Jerusalem and at the Seminary’s main cam-
pus in Manhattan. In May of 1983 he received 
both his Master’s Degree and Rabbinic Ordi-
nation. Recently, he was awarded an Hon-
orary Doctorate by the Jewish Theological 
Seminary. 
Rabbi Jacknis is married to his wonderful 
wife, Suri Jacknis, who serves as Director of 
Educator Networks at The Jewish Education 
Project. She is a progressive leader in the 
Jewish world, and SHJC is fortunate to have 
had the two of them as leaders of their com-
munity. 
Together, Suri and Rabbi have three chil-
dren, a son Noam (married to Candace), a 
daughter Yael, (married to Jacob Davidson) 
and another daughter Nava (married to 
Natanel Fuchs). Rabbi and Suri are the 
proud grandparents of Ethan, Braydon and 
Liat.

HONORING LISA STARR 
ROSENSTEIN 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 21, 2021 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Lisa Starr 
Rosenstein, 53, who was tragically killed in a 
hit-and-run accident while jogging. I want to 
express my condolences on behalf of the peo-
ple of San Antonio to the Starr family. Mrs. 
Rosenstein was an extraordinary individual, 
generous and genuine, and someone who 
cared deeply about her fellow neighbors. She 
was also an avid long-distance runner who 
competed in 27 marathons, including the New 
York Marathon, and she was a member of the 
Jewish community at the Rodfei Sholom and 
Temple Beth El congregations. 
Lisa Starr Rosenstein is survived by her 
friends and family, including her children, 
Emma and Nathan, her husband of nearly 28 
years, Alan Rosenstein, her parents, Arlene 
and David Starr, the president of the American 
Agape Foundation. She was profoundly loved 
and will be greatly missed by all. 
Madam Speaker, I am thankful to know this 
remarkable San Antonio family who is dedi-
cated to service and community. I am deeply 
saddened by this horrible tragedy, and I hope 
this honor will bring a small amount of comfort 
to her family. May her memory be a blessing.
