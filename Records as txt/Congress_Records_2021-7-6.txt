PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, remember us. Remem-
ber the promises You have made to 
Your people throughout time. Always 
You have given us cause for hope when 
we have listened to You. 
Because of Your past mercies, we 
pray today that we would be certain of 
Your comfort in our troubles. When all 
around us seems to drown out Your 
words, we pray we find strength when 
we listen for Your voice. In the words 
You speak, we place our trust. 
Quicken us once again; refresh and 
revive us on our pilgrimage through 
this life. 
When we are faced with derision, may 
we not respond with indignation. 
As we wander from one experience to 
the next and the counsel of others 
causes confusion, may we not be con-
founded. 
Wherever we find ourselves, may 
Your love be our guide and Your grace 
our source of joy. 
Then may our hearts and minds be 
filled with thoughts of You, inspiring 
and compelling us to sing songs of 
blessing and comfort. Bless, then, our 
melody that somehow it would be a 
blessing for others. 
In the promise of Your name we pray. 
Amen.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. DAVID J. TRONE 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 6, 2021 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, on June 25, 
2021, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ‘‘YEA’’ on Roll 
Call No. 185. 
I strongly support S.J. Res. 14 to invalidate 
the Trump Administration’s 2020 Methane 
Recission Rule and restore methane pollution 
standards for new and modified oil and gas fa-
cilities. I am pleased this Joint Resolution was 
signed into law.

HONORING THE PHILADELPHIA 
ORCHESTRA AND KIMMEL CENTER 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 6, 2021 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor two cultural institutions in my district 
who have announced that they are formally 
merging. The Philadelphia Orchestra and the 
Kimmel Center are poised to bring the great-
est performances and most impactful edu-
cation and community programs, in person 
and digitally, to audiences in Philadelphia, na-
tionally and worldwide. 
This merger is an example of how cultural 
and creative non-profits can be drivers of a 
post-pandemic economy. The creative and 
performing arts play an integral role in Phila-
delphia and across all Congressional Districts. 
This new cultural and creative non-profit will 
be led by Matias Tarnopolsky. America is a 
land of immigrants and his family’s journey 
from Argentina to the United Kingdom to Cali-
fornia to Pennsylvania is inspiring. 
The Kimmel Center is America’s premier 
performing arts venue. I join countless Phila-
delphians with unforgettable memories from 
visits to this exquisite hall. My constituents 
and visitors from across the world have 
watched performances there as well as cele-
brating weddings and graduations. 
The Philadelphia Orchestra has a deep part-
nership with the State Department. They are 
the only American orchestra to visit Vietnam. 
They have performed for our troops in Korea 
and to mark 30 years of democracy, they 
made history by traveling to Mongolia. 
I join the constituents of Pennsylvania’s 3rd 
Congressional District in extending warm wish-
es to the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Kim-
mel Center in this new venture.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO PER-
MIT THE FLAG OF THE UNITED 
STATES TO BE FLOWN AT HALF- 
STAFF IN THE EVENT OF THE 
DEATH OF A MAYOR OF THE 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 6, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill that would make a small but re-
spectful change to federal law by adding the 
Mayor of the District of Columbia to the list of 
named principals for whom the President shall 
order the U.S. flag be flown at half-staff. Cur-
rent law states that the President shall make 
this order ‘‘upon the death of principal figures 
of the United States Government and the Gov-
ernor of a State, territory, or possession, as a 
mark of respect to their memory.’’ Surely the 
D.C. Mayor should qualify as such a principal. 
My bill would add the D.C. Mayor, who has 
the same responsibilities as state and territory 
governors, to the current list of officials. This 
bill is a continuation of our ‘‘Free and Equal 
D.C.’’ series to ensure fair recognition of the 
nearly 700,000 citizens of the District of Co-
lumbia. Last Congress, the Judiciary Com-
mittee passed the bill. 
Congress has already acknowledged that 
the District of Columbia is entitled to a place 
among the states for certain honors. The re-
quested addition is not as expansive as others 
that Congress has already recognized. For ex-
ample, legislation I have gotten enacted has 
ensured that the District of Columbia War Me-
morial honors only District residents who 
served in World War I, as intended, and that 
D.C.’s Frederick Douglass statue sits in the 
Capitol, alongside statues from the 50 states. 
We also successfully worked with the U.S. 
Postal Service to create a D.C. stamp, like the 
stamps for the 50 states, and worked with the 
National Park Service to add the D.C. flag 
alongside the state flags near Union Station. 
Legislation was also enacted to give D.C. a 
coin after it was omitted from legislation cre-
ating coins for the 50 states. Legislation re-
quired the armed services to display the Dis-
trict flag whenever the flags of the states are 
displayed. With these significant actions by 
Congress, it is not too much to ask to add the 
Mayor to the list of principals who are recog-
nized upon their deaths. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
ROTARY 
CLUB OF QUITMAN, TEXAS, ON 75 
YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. LANCE GOODEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 6, 2021 
Mr. GOODEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate the Rotary Club of 
Quitman, Texas, which is celebrating 75 years 
of service. 
Since January 7, 1946, the Rotary Club of 
Quitman has consistently served not only the 
Quitman community, but also Wood County, 
Texas, and beyond. 
The membership of this club has included 
innovative leaders of business and govern-
ment, city council members, mayors, school 
principals, 
administrators, 
superintendents, 
doctors, lawyers, members of the clergy, and 
numerous prominent citizens of the Quitman 
community. 
While membership is important, the true 
measure of a club or organization is the serv-
ice they provide to their community. In this re-
gard, the Rotary Club of Quitman is truly ad-
mirable. 
The club concentrates its efforts to support 
the youth of the Quitman Independent School 
District and other worthy community initiatives. 
During its long history, it has funded college 
scholarships for graduating seniors, sponsored 
a Rotaract club for high school students, fund-
ed the first infrared camera for the city’s fire 
department, supported youth at Rotary Youth 
Leadership Awards (RYLA) camp, as well as 
other efforts to support the youth. One of the 
scholarships honors a local veteran of the 
Vietnam Conflict who, after a distinguished 
military career, served as Wood County Judge 
and a Rotarian. 
I wish to thank each member of the Rotary 
Club of Quitman for their continuous, dedi-
cated commitment to improving the lives of 
others. It is an honor to represent these mem-
bers in our Nation’s Capital. 
Again, congratulations to the Rotary Club of 
Quitman, Texas on 75 outstanding years.

HONORING THOMAS HARPER 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 6, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Thomas A. Harper. 
Mr. Harper proudly served his country dur-
ing the Korea War and embodies the resil-
ience and fortitude of the great men and 
women who serve in our Nation’s military. 
During his time in the U.S. Army, Mr. Harper 
gained the role of Sergeant First Class, served 
in the Battle of Pork Chop Hill and was award-
ed two Purple Hearts. For Mr. Harper’s valor 
and service in the Battle of Pork Chop Hill, 
Gregory Peck, an actor in the movie, Pork 
Chip Hill, met with Mr. Harper to conduct re-
search for his role. 
I would like to formally thank Mr. Harper for 
his service to the United States of America.

HONORING WILLIAM HAVEMANN’S 
SERVICE TO THE HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 6, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to take this opportunity to recognize the ex-
ceptional service of William E. Havemann, 
who served in the House’s Office of General 
Counsel as an Associate General Counsel. 
During his tenure, Mr. Havemann played an 
integral role in advancing and protecting the 
legal interests of the House of Representa-
tives and its Members, Officers, and employ-
ees in connection with Federal court litigation 
involving issues of the highest institutional im-
portance. Mr. Havemann provided invaluable 
legal counsel and representation to numerous 
Committees of the House, greatly assisting 
them both in fulfilling their constitutionally au-
thorized oversight functions and defending 
those prerogatives in litigation. In particular, 
Mr. Havemann was primarily responsible for 
developing the House’s legal position in sup-
port of challenges to the Trump administra-
tion’s attempt to change the criteria for deter-
mining whether immigrants to the United 
States are likely to become a ‘‘public charge.’’ 
The amicus briefs filed by the House and oral 
arguments presented by Mr. Havemann di-
rectly contributed to the Trump administra-
tion’s position being invalidated by multiple 
federal courts. 
Additionally, Mr. Havemann provided essen-
tial legal counsel to the House regarding both 
Presidential impeachments, as well as with re-
spect to the defense of long-standing institu-
tional powers, including House Committees’ 
authority to enforce its subpoenas and the 
House’s constitutional authority to adopt rules 
permitting its Members to participate in the 
legislative process remotely by proxy during 
an unprecedented global pandemic. 
Mr. Havemann’s work on behalf of the 
House has been of the highest caliber and I 
have no doubt that clients of the Hogan 
Lovells’ law firm will benefit from his excellent 
legal counsel. On behalf of the entire House 
community, I thank Mr. Havemann for his 
dedicated service to the House, and I wish for 
him the very best in all of his future endeav-
ors.

REMEMBERING DUDLEY WILLIAMS 
HON. JAMES A. HIMES 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 6, 2021 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Dudley Williams, a beloved 
public servant and my good friend. 
Dudley committed so much of his distin-
guished career to the betterment of the City of 
Stamford. He first moved to Stamford in 1989, 
with his wife, Juanita James, and son, Dudley 
Williams III. He contributed greatly to the vi-
brancy of the Stamford community. Dudley 
served three terms on the Stamford Board of 
Education, two as President. 
Dudley also served on the Stamford Plan-
ning Board and the Stamford Board of Fi-
nance. His involvement in Connecticut and the 
City of Stamford goes beyond these positions, 
as Dudley held leadership positions at a vari-
ety of nonprofits, including the Ferguson Li-
brary, Avon Theatre, the Children’s Learning 
Center, and the Stamford YMCA. In these po-
sitions, he enriched the lives and livelihoods of 
families throughout southwestern Connecticut. 
He also served as President and CEO of the 
Mill River Park Collaborative, where he used 
his ability to bring people together to create a 
space to strengthen the community. 
Dudley made many immeasurable contribu-
tions to the community throughout his life. We 
will forever be grateful for Dudley’s spirit, com-
passion, generosity, and we will miss him 
dearly.

COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE J. HOWARD 
SNYDER VFW POST 781 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 6, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the 100th anniversary of the 
J. Howard Snyder Veterans of Foreign Wars 
Post 781 (VFW), which was founded in North 
Huntingdon, Pennsylvania on June 24, 1921. 
Post 781 is named after Corporal J. Howard 
Snyder, the first American soldier from Irwin, 
Pennsylvania to die in World War I. Cpl. Sny-
der passed away on August 13, 1918, three 
days after his twenty-second birthday and 
three months before the truce that ended the 
war. On April 3, 1921, Cpl. Snyder’s body 
came home to Irwin and a burial service was 
held the next day. The community came to-
gether to mourn the death of a young man 
whose life was taken too soon, with shops 
along main street closing to observe the pro-
cession and burial. With the funeral fresh on 
their minds, local veterans decided to honor J. 
Howard Snyder when founding VFW Post 781. 
For the last 100 years, Post 781 has been 
an invaluable resource for generations of vet-
erans, as well as an integral part of the local 
community. Post 781 brings residents together 
for fish fries, sponsors the annual Irwin Memo-
rial Day parade, and maintains the gravesites 
of local veterans. In 2017, members of Post 
781 sourced a headstone for a Civil War vet-
eran whose grave had been unmarked for 125 
years in Irwin Union Cemetery. Forever de-
voted to improving the lives of their fellow vet-
erans, Post 781 distributes food to veterans in 
need and provides an outlet for those proc-
essing their service to our country. 
Madam Speaker, members of the J. Howard 
Snyder Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 781 
have demonstrated remarkable commitment to 
those who served and to the local community. 
As an Iraq War veteran, I’m honored to recog-
nize the 100th birthday of an organization that 
does so much for my fellow veterans. I have 
no doubt that Post 781 will remain an integral 
part or their community in their next 100 
years.

HONORING AND REMEMBERING 
THE LIFE OF BJ BOATMAN 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 6, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the dedicated service and life of the 
loved firefighter, Bryan Jeffrey Boatman. 
Known as ‘‘BJ’’ to his loved ones and 
friends, BJ passed away at the young age of 
37 in the service of his community, while as-
sisting 
the 
U.S. 
Forest 
Service 
fighting 
wildland fires on Tuesday, July 7, 2020, near 
Payson, Arizona. 
BJ leaves behind his devoted wife, Eliza-
beth Marie Boatman, and his young 8-year-old 
daughter, Claire Elizabeth Boatman. BJ loved 
what he did, serving and helping others his 
whole life. In this steadfast support of his com-
munity, he made the ultimate sacrifice, giving 
his life battling wildland fires, which so threat-
en our Western communities. Boatman is a 
hero whose selflessness and sacrifice exem-
plifies the best qualities of what it means to be 
good father, husband, and American. 
Madam Speaker, I express a sincere form 
of gratitude to BJ Boatman, and I offer my 
prayers to Elizabeth and Claire, who lost a fa-
ther and a husband far too soon. I encourage 
my colleagues to join me in honoring BJ’s leg-
acy and bravery, standing humbly in his mem-
ory having benefitted from the protection he 
gave our country. It is on the backs of great 
men like BJ that our Nation is protected, and 
how we can sleep peacefully at night knowing 
people watch over the safety of our families, 
homes, and communities. 
BJ will never be forgotten.

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
NANCY 
DAVIS 
REA-
GAN’S BIRTH 
HON. YOUNG KIM 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 6, 2021 
Mrs. KIM of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today joined by my colleague, Rep. 
STEEL, to commemorate the birthday of one of 
our Nation’s greatest First Ladies and a true 
American patriot. 100 years ago, on July 6, 
Nancy Reagan was born. Throughout her life-
time, she served in many roles—from movie 
star to loving mother, from First Lady of both 
California and the United States to distin-
guished philanthropist. No matter her position, 
she fulfilled her duties with grace; elegance; 
and, above all, class. 
As First Lady of California, Nancy became 
involved with important charitable work, includ-
ing visiting Vietnam War veterans, homes for 
the elderly, and schools for physically and 
emotionally handicapped children. She partici-
pated in events raising awareness about pris-
oners of war and servicemembers missing in 
action. She also promoted the Foster Grand-
parent Program, a volunteer opportunity for 
older Americans to mentor, guide, and care for 
children with exceptional needs. This program 
continues to make important contributions to 
this day, benefitting both children and elderly 
people. According to the Ronald Reagan Pres-
idential Foundation and Institute, showcasing 
the power of Mrs. Reagan’s attention, in the 
program’s first year of operation, 782 foster 
grandparents carried out projects in 27 States. 
By 1985, some 19,000 foster grandparents 
served 65,000 children in all 50 states. 
As First Lady during President Reagan’s 
two terms, she led the charge on educating 
our Nation’ s youth on the dangers of drug 
use and addiction, teaching a generation of 
children and young adults to ‘‘Just Say No.’’ In 
1985, she hosted First Ladies from across the 
world for a briefing in Washington and Atlanta 
on the topic of drug abuse and what can be 
done to help those who are suffering from it. 
Her drive to educate young people about the 
dangers of illicit drugs demonstrates her com-
mitment to the future of our nation. 
After her time in the White House, Nancy 
had a profound impact in our own commu-
nities through her support of the Reagan Li-
brary in Simi Valley. It was through her guid-
ance and influence that the Reagan Library 
became one of the most esteemed centers for 
learning and Presidential scholarship in the 
country. She also continued the push to edu-
cate people on the perils of substance abuse 
and established the Nancy Reagan Founda-
tion and the Nancy Reagan Afterschool Pro-
gram to support this mission. 
After President Reagan passed away, she 
became a leading advocate for individuals suf-
fering from Alzheimer’s Disease and their 
caregivers. Nancy worked with the National 
Alzheimer’s Association and its affiliate, the 
Ronald & Nancy Reagan Research Institute in 
Chicago, Illinois, to find a cure or treatment for 
this terrible disease that plagues so many in 
our country. She courageously continued 
President Reagan’s legacy in serving our 
country until her death in 2016. She is buried 
on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library 
grounds next to her beloved husband. 
On the centennial of her birth, we commend 
Mrs. Reagan for her service to our commu-
nities, the State of California, and the United 
States of America.
