PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, You place melodies in 
our hearts. Thank You for the music of 
Your mercies, for the harmonies of 
Your sacred words, and for the sym-
phonies of Your unfailing love. May 
Your songs that surround us in the spa-
cious skies and rolling hills inspire our 
lawmakers with reverence and faith. 
Give our Senators such awe for Your 
goodness that they will strive to obey 
You. Provide them also with a faith 
that stands firm and embraces Your 
plan. 
Lord, save us all by Your power and 
liberate us with Your might. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,

The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
NATIONAL GUARD 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this week, the National Guard is de-
parting what has been a months-long 
presence here at the Capitol. Aspects of 
the Guards’ presence here were not 
fleshed out as clearly or coherently as 
either Congress or the servicemembers 
deserved, and Members of Congress will 
continue to discuss and debate whether 
it is appropriate for uniformed mili-
tary personnel to play an ongoing role 
in policing the U.S. Capitol going for-
ward. 
But where Senators are absolutely, 
100 percent united is in our great admi-
ration and appreciation of the indi-
vidual men and women who volun-
teered to serve in the National Guard, 
who have put on the uniform, and 
whose orders brought them here to the 
Capitol Complex. 
It was my particular honor to get to 
meet and talk with several groups of 
the remarkable men and women of the 
Kentucky National Guard during this 
period. 
Thank you, all, from all 50 States, for 
your patriotism and for your service. 
NOMINATION OF KRISTEN M. 
CLARKE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. On a completely 
different 
matter, 
when 
President 
Biden’s nominees have been qualified 
and mainstream, they received bipar-
tisan cooperation. But the President’s 
choice to head a key Division at the 
Department of Justice as an Assistant 
Attorney General failed to even ad-
vance out of the committee. 
The Democratic leader had to reach 
into the Judiciary Committee and res-
cue the nomination of Kristen Clarke. 
Our colleagues on the committee did 
not give her a favorable recommenda-
tion. That is because of a long history 
of statements that placed the nominee 
on, frankly, the far-left fringe of the 
political spectrum. 
If our Democratic colleagues have 
their way, a couple of days from now, 
the American people will have an As-
sistant Attorney General who argued 
publicly just last year that ‘‘we must 
invest less in police.’’ She used that 
exact phrase three times in one essay. 
Violent crimes shot up dramatically 
in 2020. One survey of 30-plus major 
American cities found that the murder 
rate jumped 30 percent last year alone. 
Other estimates have found even larger 
increases. Experts say 2020 saw the 
largest 1-year rise in homicides that 
America has ever seen as far back as 
we have recorded these kinds of statis-
tics. 
Early data from this year suggests 
that 2021 may even be worse, but, ap-
parently, the President’s response to 
this violent crimewave is to have a pro-
ponent of defunding the police help run 
the Department of Justice.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3318 
May 24, 2021 
Adequate policing is not an enemy of 
civil rights. Among other things, a re-
cent study by multiple university pro-
fessors confirmed that more cops lead 
to fewer murders: 
Larger police forces save lives, and the 
lives saved are disproportionately Black 
lives. 
Police funding isn’t the only impor-
tant issue where the nominee’s judg-
ment has missed the mark. 
Three years ago, when the then-At-
torney General was standing up a task 
force on religious liberty, Ms. Clarke 
said this was designed ‘‘to make it 
easier for people to use religion to 
mask their discriminatory goals’’—an 
incredibly out-of-touch, far-left state-
ment. 
Finally, we are currently watching 
an alarming spike in anti-Semitic at-
tacks and violence across our country. 
I introduced new legislation on Friday, 
with Senator COTTON, to confront anti- 
Semitism head-on, but as a Harvard 
undergraduate, Ms. Clarke invited, wel-
comed, introduced, and then defended a 
famously anti-Semitic guest speaker 
who had authored a book literally enti-
tled—now listen to this—‘‘The Jewish 
Onslaught.’’ 
The nominee has stated recently that 
she regrets that decision. Goodness, I 
would certainly hope so. 
Yet she also claims that her op-ed 
from just last year, which asserted 
three 
times—three 
times—that 
we 
must invest less in police, was not ac-
tually suggesting that we invest less in 
police. 
This is not the right nominee for a 
crucial post at a crucial time so I 
would urge colleagues to vote no this 
week. 
f 
CHINA 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Now, 
Madam 
President, on another matter, last 
week, a bipartisan majority of Sen-
ators voted to proceed to floor debate 
about our Nation’s long-term competi-
tion with China. 
There is no disagreement that the 
People’s Republic’s strategic capabili-
ties and its growing influence beyond 
the Indo-Pacific pose a singular chal-
lenge to American strength and secu-
rity. There is robust debate about the 
right ways to address this challenge. 
The legislation before us arrived on 
the floor incomplete, and it spans a 
number of huge issues that occupy 
multiple committees’ jurisdictions. It 
is a prime example of a bill that needs 
a 
thorough, 
bipartisan 
amendment 
process here in the Senate. So far, we 
have had a few votes on important 
amendments. There are a lot more that 
need consideration, and we should not 
close debate on this bill until those 
amendments are addressed. 
Unfortunately, during one important 
vote last week, our Democratic col-
leagues sent a telling signal. They 
voted down Ranking Member INHOFE 
and Vice Chairman SHELBY’s amend-
ment to make sure that the real back-
bone of our competition with China— 
the resources we allocate to our Armed 
Forces and national defense—was not 
neglected. 
Make no mistake, supply chains, es-
pionage, intellectual property—those 
are all important topics, but all the 
policy tweaks in the world would not 
amount to much help if we lose our 
military edge with respect to China. 
Soft power isn’t much good without 
the hard power to back it up. 
The Chinese Communist Party ap-
pears to understand this quite clearly. 
According to one watchdog, it has in-
creased military investment by 76 per-
cent over the last decade. China has in-
creased its military spending by 76 per-
cent over the last decade. The same 
data show that our own U.S. defense 
spending fell 10 percent over that pe-
riod, thanks to the approach of the last 
Democratic administration, and now 
President Biden has signaled that he 
wants to cut defense spending after in-
flation—exactly the wrong approach. 
No serious strategy for our competi-
tion with massive foreign powers could 
leave the U.S. Armed Forces, their 
tools, and their resources out of the 
conversation in a meaningful way. I 
hope and expect we will have a number 
of further votes on important amend-
ments before there would be any at-
tempt to shut off debate on this wide- 
ranging measure.

TRIBUTE TO BILL HOULIHAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if 
you have been involved in Illinois poli-
tics and government in the last 40 
years or if you have called my office in 
Springfield anytime in the last 24 
years, there is a good chance you know 
the fellow I am about to speak about 
this afternoon. For those who haven’t 
been lucky enough to meet him yet, let 
me tell you about my friend, one of the 
best people I have ever known. His 
name is Bill Houlihan. 
Bill came to work on my first Senate 
campaign in 1996, and when we won, I 
asked him to be my staff director for 
downstate Illinois—all 96 counties. He 
has been with me ever since, and now 
he is State director of the entire State. 
Whenever I can’t attend an event in Il-
linois, Bill is the person I turn to. I 
don’t have to write any speech for him, 
and I don’t have to check on what he 
said. People know Bill speaks for me, 
and I have complete confidence in his 
judgment and integrity. 
Everybody seems to know him. Just 
try going to a grocery store with Bill 
Houlihan in Springfield, IL. Be pre-
pared for delays as everyone needs to 
talk to him or to thank him for some-
thing that he might have done: Thanks 
for helping my mom get her Social Se-
curity. Thanks for helping my dad with 
the Veterans Health Administration. 
Thanks for helping to get that passport 
so my daughter could go away to 
school. Thanks for helping the local 
union get the project that creates the 
jobs here in our community. 
Over the years, Bill has helped thou-
sands of people find jobs and provide 
for their families. He knows about the 
dignity of work. He does whatever he 
can to help whomever he can, having 
no expectation of any recognition. 
Bill started his professional life in 
1981, fresh out of Eastern Illinois Uni-
versity. He was the class president. His 
first job was with the Illinois Edu-
cation Association. They sent him into 
a David-and-Goliath battle scene in Pe-
oria, IL, where they were trying to 
convince the local teachers to sign up 
with the IEA. They hired Bill 6 weeks 
before the crucial election and sent 
him into Peoria—his first campaign for 
a union. You see, Bill had worked on 
political campaigns for his dad, and I 
will talk about those in a minute. 
When he got down to Peoria—a place 
where he had never lived—everybody 
knew him, and whenever he went up 
and 
introduced 
himself 
as 
Bill 
Houlihan, they would say: Well, are 
you the son of Bill Houlihan? 
He would say: No, I am the son of 
John Houlihan. 
Bill didn’t understand for a while 
why he kept getting that question. It 
turns out that he had exactly the same 
name as Peoria’s longtime and vener-
able TV weathercaster Bill Houlihan. 
When, as a young union organizer, 
Bill showed up, puzzled teachers always 
said: Are you sure you are not related 
to Bill Houlihan? 
Our Bill Houlihan was no TV person-
ality, but Peoria teachers quickly 
learned that he cared about them and

that he knew his stuff. Just as impor-
tant, he understands how to build po-
litical organizations and campaigns 
and how to use that power to help ev-
eryday people. Thank goodness for me 
he knows how to win. The IEA won the 
election in a close, upset victory back 
in the day. It was the first of many 
election campaign victories for Bill 
Houlihan. 
Bill and Cindy, his wife, are the par-
ents of four children, but they did it 
the hard way—one set of triplets and a 
bonus baby born 22 months later. 
Mariah, John, Grant, Neil are all 
grown up now, but when they were 
younger, at the start of every school 
year, their teachers would often ask 
them: Is Bill Houlihan your dad? That 
question was followed with the teach-
ers telling stories about Bill and how 
he had helped them. This young, un-
known organizer had become a legend 
in his own right. These stories were the 
only way the Houlihan kids learned 
about what their dad did for a living. 
He never bragged about himself; he was 
too modest. 
Driving around the State of Illinois 
for over 20 years with Bill Houlihan, I 
have heard a lot of stories, but I think 
the thing that impressed me the most 
was when he talked about his dad— 
what a remarkable man. I was lucky to 
know him. 
John Houlihan was born in a section 
of Chicago which describes where you 
might find it. It is called Back of the 
Yards; that is, the stockyards. In that 
section of the city, immigrant families 
got their start and worked in some of 
the hardest jobs in Chicago. John’s fa-
ther was a slaughterhouse worker. 
John himself grew up on the South 
Side of Chicago—in that area—and his 
dream came true. As an Irish Catholic 
kid, he was admitted to Notre Dame 
University. Can I tell you what a big 
deal that is still today? For the kids in 
those parishes to consider going to 
Notre Dame was nothing short of a 
miracle. So John Houlihan, Bill’s fa-
ther, who was 6 feet 4, incidentally, 
was going to try out for the basketball 
team at Notre Dame University, an ab-
solute dream come true. Yet there was 
an intervening event which the Pre-
siding Officer will appreciate. It was 
called Pearl Harbor. 
John Houlihan, Bill’s dad, had to 
drop out of Notre Dame University to 
enlist in the U.S. Marines. He served in 
many campaigns. As his 21st birthday 
approached, his mom and dad sent him 
a little gift, a belt. It was small enough 
that it could make it through the mail, 
and at least he knew they were think-
ing of him on his birthday. He was em-
barking on the Battle of Bougainville 
on his 21st birthday, an island in the 
South Pacific. A grenade explosion 
ripped through his left leg in that bat-
tle. Lucky for him, he pulled off that 
belt and applied it as a tourniquet. It 
saved his life, but it couldn’t save his 
leg. It was amputated at the hip. The 
Allied forces won that battle, and John 
Houlihan spent a year and a half recov-
ering in veterans hospitals. 
He left the Marines with a chest full 
of 
medals, 
including 
three 
Bronze 
Stars, a Marine Corps Medal, and, of 
course, a Purple Heart. He went back 
to Chicago with one leg, an artificial 
leg, and a cane or a crutch. He went to 
a dance in the basement of St. Gabri-
el’s Catholic Church on the Chicago 
South Side, and he met his future wife 
Vernal. They had eight kids together. 
Bill was the middle child, the fourth of 
the eight kids. Amazingly, his dad, de-
spite having that devastating injury, 
wanted to get involved in politics. He 
moved to Park Forest, IL, just south of 
Chicago, to raise his family in a larger 
house, as you can imagine, and decided 
to run for the Illinois General Assem-
bly in 1964. 
I have a picture here I am going to 
show you. This is John Houlihan, Bill’s 
dad, and this is his brother Mike. Bill 
is over here at the age of 10. His dad 
was elected to the general assembly. 
He served with some of the giants of Il-
linois’ political history: my friend Paul 
Simon, Adlai Stevenson, and Harold 
Washington. John Houlihan fit right 
in. 
As an amputee, at a time before the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, John 
Houlihan knew that they would ap-
plaud you on Memorial Day and Vet-
erans Day but that it was hard as heck 
for a disabled vet—really severely dis-
abled like John Houlihan—to get a job. 
He fought for those disabled vets just 
like himself, so much so that, when he 
came to the Illinois General Assembly 
in Springfield, the Black Caucus in-
vited him to serve as a member. They 
knew that he appreciated what dis-
crimination was all about. He accepted 
the invitation as an honor. 
Years 
later, 
when 
his 
son 
Bill 
Houlihan was working in that same Il-
linois State Senate, the Black Caucus 
asked that he be assigned to them as a 
staff member because they knew of his 
reputation—Bill 
Houlihan’s 
reputa-
tion—for being willing to fight for the 
underdog. 
John Houlihan served in the general 
assembly for 8 years before turning his 
full attention to veterans’ rights. 
He served with the Illinois Depart-
ment of Veterans’ Affairs, the Vet-
erans’ Administration here in Wash-
ington, and the Cook County Veterans 
Assistance Commission. His young son 
Bill was watching him throughout this 
life experience, and I know he came to 
appreciate his dad’s courage and deter-
mination that he was going to build a 
family and build a life despite his seri-
ous disability. 
He also knew what it was like for his 
dad. I remember his dad, a World War 
II vet. We look today to amputees who 
have the good fortune, thank goodness, 
of modern prosthetics, even computer- 
driven devices to help them lead as 
normal a life as possible. That wasn’t 
the luck of the World War II vets. They 
were given some crude artificial legs, 
and they did their best. 
I can still picture Bill’s dad John— 
one-legged man, lumbering around life 
with this big, wooden leg of his that he 
would just swing forward as he made it 
with his cane and made his life despite 
that handicap. 
Bill’s mom was a big influence on 
him as well. She might have been 
quieter than his dad but just as strong. 
Think what kind of woman it was who 
would marry John Houlihan, quickly 
returning from war, trying to make a 
life. Vernal Houlihan was a kind, gen-
erous woman. No matter how tight 
money was, there was always room for 
one more place at the Houlihan dinner 
table. 
Bill Houlihan is just like both his 
parents, the same courage and deter-
mination and the same sense of caring. 
The heart of every congressional of-
fice is something called casework, 
helping constituents untangle redtape 
caused by government bureaucracy or 
to help solve everyday problems in 
their lives that mean the world to 
them. 
Bill Houlihan may be the only State 
director in this Senate who still does 
casework along with his colleagues in 
addition to all his other duties. I can’t 
count the number of people whose bur-
dens have been made lighter by Bill 
Houlihan. 
He logs every call he receives, and his 
day doesn’t end until he returns every 
call. He treats every person with dig-
nity, compassion, and respect, and he 
always makes time for them. 
When we would drive around the 
State, thousands and thousands of 
miles, it reached the point where peo-
ple would call him in his car. The 
phone never stopped. 
Many times I said to Bill: Why don’t 
you pick up on that when we get back 
to Springfield tomorrow? 
No, he said. I knew he was going to 
call, this buddy of mine. He calls me 
every day. He just wants to chat for 
just a few minutes. I will be done, Boss, 
in just a minute. 
And he would take the call. 
Many people called him just to hear 
his friendly voice. He has fans the likes 
of which I wish I had some days. A lot 
of chiefs of staff would think twice 
about that approach to the job but not 
Bill. That is just who he is. 
Our office in Springfield is located in 
the same block as Abraham Lincoln’s 
home. That neighborhood is part of the 
National 
Park 
Service. 
When 
Bill 
walks down the block, he greets every 
park ranger by name, and they know 
him by name. It is like that wherever 
we go. 
Illinois is filled with young leaders 
all over the State—women and men, 
Black White, and Brown—who didn’t 
know they could be a leader until they 
met Bill Houlihan. He is one of the best 
talent scouts and coaches I have ever 
known. He boosts the confidence of ev-
eryone who works for him or with him. 
He crisscrosses the State of Illinois 
in his dark-blue minivan; they call it 
the Houli-van. The miles he puts on 
that van every year might take him to 
China or the Moon. He knows every

mile marker on every highway in our 
State by heart. 
He has, at last count, 47,000 contacts 
in his Palm Pilot—yes, he still has a 
Palm Pilot—and I think he knows 
20,000 of those telephone numbers by 
heart. He has an encyclopedic mind for 
names, 
numbers, 
election 
results, 
sports stats, history—everything—and 
he shares everything he has learned 
with anyone who might benefit from 
his knowledge. 
In between organizing for the IEA 
and joining my staff, Bill worked as a 
legislative director the Illinois Senate 
Democrats and downstate director for 
Senator Carol Moseley Braun, the first 
woman of color to serve in the Senate. 
One of these pictures here is the 
early days when he was just getting 
started as an organizer, hair much 
darker than it is today. 
Now, let me show you a more recent 
appearance. This is Bill. He is speaking 
at the Women’s March in Springfield in 
2017. 
Usually, he is very soft-spoken, until 
he gets in front of a microphone, and 
that is when he turns up the volume. 
Oh, there is one other time he turns up 
the volume. If he is watching his Fight-
ing Irish play football and they score a 
touchdown, Bill will let out a scream 
that will rattle the windows. 
Always, always Bill Houlihan is the 
voice for people whose hopes and needs 
aren’t heard enough within the halls of 
the Senate or the halls of power. He is 
a voice of compassion, encouragement, 
wisdom, and decency. 
Loretta and I are lucky to call Bill 
and Cindy some of our best and dearest 
friends. So it is hard to say, but this is 
his last week on the job with the U.S. 
Senate. It hurts to lose a man who has 
given me such a big part of his life. It 
is going to take its toll on my office, 
my politics, and my life, but I can 
guarantee you that I will be calling 
Bill just as often as I always have. He 
may not be on the payroll, but I know 
he will take my call. 
Bill and Cindy want to move on to 
the next chapter in their lives. That is 
understandable. I am sure it is going to 
include some traveling and special 
time with their kids and grandkids. 
Bill, God bless him, just volunteered 
again to once again become the chair-
man of the Sangamon County, IL, 
Democratic Party—a post he held 
years ago. 
Above all, I know that Bill will con-
tinue to help everyone he can in every 
way he can because that is who he is 
and always has been. 
Bill, I hope you are watching—Cindy 
too. Thank you. I couldn’t have done it 
without you. Loretta and I wish you 
and Cindy and your whole family good 
health and happiness in all the years to 
come.

NOMINATION OF KRISTEN M. CLARKE 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of the nomination 
of Kristen Clarke to be Assistant At-
torney General for the Justice Depart-
ment’s Civil Rights Division. 
In the 41⁄2 months since she was nom-
inated, my Republican colleagues and 
their rightwing allies have engaged in 
a coordinated smear campaign to dis-
tort Kristen Clarke’s record. It is past 
time to set things straight. 
Kristen Clarke is a supremely capa-
ble and qualified nominee to lead the 
Civil Rights Division. I would argue 
that she is among the most well- 
credentialed and qualified nominees 
ever to serve in this role. 
During her career, she has served as a 
trial attorney in the Division’s voting 
section; a prosecutor in the Division’s 
criminal section; an assistant counsel 
at the NAACP Legal Defense and Edu-
cation Fund and later as the codirector 
of its Political Participation Group; as 
the civil rights chief of the New York 
State Attorney General’s Civil Rights 
Bureau; and as president and executive 
director of the Lawyers’ Committee for 
Civil Rights Under Law, one of the Na-
tion’s preeminent civil rights organiza-
tions. Kristen Clarke’s credentials for 
this job are unimpeachable. 
Unable to undermine her nomination 
on the merits, Senate Republicans have 
engaged in a vicious smear campaign 
against Kristen Clarke because they 
are afraid she will actually do her job. 
They are afraid she will enforce our 
civil rights statutes, challenge dis-
criminatory voting laws, combat sys-
temic racism in policing, and protect 
the LGBTQ community. 
This work is urgently needed after 
the Civil Rights Division endured 4 
years of intentional neglect and out-
right hostility during the Trump ad-
ministration. During its 4 years in of-
fice, 
the 
Trump 
administration 
brought only a single case—one—under 
the Voting Rights Act, even as States 
like Georgia, Ohio, and Wisconsin 
worked to suppress the vote by tar-
geting people of color. 
The previous administration also ef-
fectively ended the use of consent de-
crees to bring police departments into 
compliance with the Constitution. It 
abandoned this critical tool at the 
worst possible moment, as the Nation 
watched Black Americans like George 
Floyd and Breonna Taylor killed by of-
ficers sworn to protect and serve. 
President Biden nominated Kristen 
Clarke to lead the Civil Rights Division 
because she is precisely the leader we 
need at this critical moment. But for 
41⁄2 months, my Republican colleagues 
have tried to tear down this highly 
qualified woman of color with un-
founded smears and outright lies. They 
feign outrage over a satirical letter Ms. 
Clarke wrote as an undergrad at Har-
vard in 1994, over 25 years ago. 
I don’t recall any comparable Repub-
lican outrage when Michael Truncale, 
then a practicing attorney for decades, 
disparaged President Obama as an ‘‘un- 
American imposter [who] bows to Arab 
Sheikhs and other world leaders.’’ In-
stead, they confirmed him to a lifetime 
appointment as a judge in the Eastern 
District of Texas. 
Senate Republicans have also tried to 
paint Ms. Clarke as some sort of anti- 
Semite—again, reaching back 25 years 
to criticize a speaker Ms. Clarke in-
vited to campus as an undergrad. They 
conveniently ignore that Ms. Clarke 
has addressed their concerns head-on 
and demonstrated a long track record 
of defending religious rights through-
out her career. 
Her work in this area has earned her 
the support of the National Council of 
Jewish Women and the Anti-Defama-
tion League, among other organiza-
tions. And if we needed any more evi-
dence to rebut this outrageous claim, 
we should all look to the words of At-
torney General Merrick Garland, who 
forcefully said: ‘‘I’m a pretty good 
judge of what an anti-Semite is, and I 
do not believe she is an anti-Semite.’’ 
Republicans are also trying to derail 
Kristen Clarke’s nomination by push-
ing the lie that she supports defunding 
the police. It doesn’t matter how many 
times they repeat the lie, it will never 
be true. Ms. Clarke has clearly ex-
pressed her support for shifting re-
sources to social workers and mental 
health professionals so that police offi-
cers are no longer called upon to ad-
dress every problem in society. This is 
not defunding the police, no matter 
what twisted definition is used. 
As the Senate Judiciary Committee 
prepared to vote on Ms. Clarke’s nomi-
nation, several Republicans took this 
baseless criticism to a pathetic, ridicu-
lous new low. The junior Senator from 
Texas claimed that voting for Ms. 
Clarke—and, previously, voting to con-
firm Vanita Gupta as Associate Attor-
ney General—put ‘‘every single Demo-
cratic Member of the United States 
Senate. . . . on record supporting abol-
ishing’’—abolishing—‘‘the 
police.’’ 
‘‘Abolishing the police’’—that is what 
he said—not defunding, not reforming, 
abolishing. What a crock. 
Unfortunately, we have come to ex-
pect 
these 
laughable 
exaggerations 
from our colleague from Texas. He 
would rather smear a nominee with 
baseless charges than engage with the 
facts, because neither Kristen Clarke 
nor Vanita Gupta has ever supported 
abolishing the police. Neither of them 
has said anything remotely close to 
this. If they had, I am sure it would 
come as news to the Fraternal Order of 
Police, the Major County Sheriffs of 
America, and the International Asso-
ciation of Chiefs of Police, all of whom 
endorsed Vanita Gupta’s nomination.

those seeking to derail her nomination. 
This week, the Senate can and should

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
NATIONAL GUARD 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday was the last day that mem-
bers of the National Guard were sta-
tioned at the Capitol. In the wake of 
January 6, they have all done us an ex-
traordinary service providing an addi-
tional layer of security here. I want to 
thank everyone on behalf of the Senate 
and the entire Capitol Complex. 
It was never our intention to have an 
element of the U.S. military on guard 
at the Capitol for an indefinite period. 
It was always a temporary solution to 
a temporary security threat caused by 
the former President—a reality ac-
knowledged by the House and Senate 
minority leaders in the immediate 
aftermath of January 6 but not much 
since. 
Going forward, we must establish and 
maintain a critical balance between se-
curity and access. The Capitol is a 
place that belongs to the people. We 
want visitors and tourists to be able to 
come and go. We want constituents to 
be able to meet their representatives 
and make their voices heard. We also 
have an obligation to make everyone— 
Members, staff, media, employees of 
the Capitol—feel safe when they come 
to work. Our Senate committees and 
the new team at the Sergeant at Arms 
are working very hard to strike that 
perfect balance. 
We thank once again the National 
Guard for helping us protect this place 
during a very difficult period for our 
democracy. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Madam President, now on Senate 
business, this week, the Senate will 
consider at least two nominations for 
important positions in the executive 
branch: Chiquita Brooks-LaSure to be 
the next Administrator of the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid and Kristen 
Clarke to be the next Assistant Attor-
ney General. 
Ms. Clarke would become the first 
woman and the first woman of color to 
formally lead the Justice Department’s 
Civil Rights Division since it was es-
tablished in 1957. 
I look forward to confirming both 
nominees this week. 
The Senate will also continue its 
work on the U.S. Innovation and Com-
petition Act—the largest stand-alone 
investment in American science and 
technology in decades. With a once-in- 
a-generation investment in the Na-
tional Science Foundation, the Depart-
ment of Energy, the Department of 
Commerce, and other vital entities, 
this legislation will set our country on 
a path to outinnovate, outproduce, and 
outcompete the world in the industries 
of the future. 
As the week goes on, we will consider 
a number of amendments from both 
sides of the aisle, as well as a man-
agers’ amendment, to bring together a 
package of bipartisan changes to the 
bill. This is regular order in action. 
The bill itself is the product of at 
least six Senate committees and in-
cludes input from nearly every Member 
of the Senate. As promised, we are 
working in a bipartisan way and a 
much more open way than the Senate 
used to act to allow amendments and 
debate. When a bill passes 22 to 4 out of 
one of its major committees and 21 to 
1 out of another, it is truly bipartisan, 
and we should be able to move this bill 
forward without any dilatory obstruc-
tion. With so much cooperation hap-
pening, I see no reason why we can’t 
finish the legislation by the end of the 
week. 
So far, this bill has flown a bit under 
the radar, but it is an incredibly impor-
tant piece of legislation. At its core, 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act is about maintaining America’s 
role as the global economic leader. Few 
issues could be more important. Just 
because it may have its effect 2, 3, 4, 5 
years from now and not the day after it 
passes doesn’t mean that it isn’t one of 
the most important pieces of legisla-
tion we could pass. 
The next century will be won or lost 
on the battleground of technological 
innovation. The country that leads the 
world in science and tech will create a 
generation of millions of good-paying 
jobs, economic growth, and prosperity 
for its citizens, with profound implica-
tions for national security as well. 
We want American workers, Amer-
ican businesses, and American values 
to lead the way in the 21st century, 
just as they did in the 20th century. 
That is what the Innovation and Com-
petition Act is all about. 
I look forward to working with Mem-
bers from both parties to complete this 
legislation by the end of the week. 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Madam President, now on a final 
matter, the Senate will soon consider 
bipartisan legislation passed by the 
House to create an independent Com-
mission to investigate and report on 
the January 6 attack on the Capitol. I 
have already taken procedural steps to 
make the legislation available for con-
sideration on the Senate floor. I will 
bring the bill forward for a vote very 
soon. I will have more to say on that in 
the coming days. 
The formation of the Commission is 
more important now than it has ever 
been in the months since January 6. 
Washington Republicans have tried to 
rewrite history and recast the attack 
on January 6 as little more than peace-
ful protests that got out of hand. One 
Republican Member said the rioters 
were more like a group of ‘‘normal 
tourists.’’ Did you see the tapes? Did 
you see the films, America? Those were 
normal tourists? Another went so far 
as to say the mob—not the staff who 
were terrorized or the police who were 
brutalized—were the real victims of 
January 6. Give me a break. 
For the sake of our democracy, it is 
crucial to establish an independent and 
trusted record of what truly tran-
spired. According to an Ipsos poll 
today, 56 percent of Republicans be-
lieve that the election was rigged, and 
53 percent of Republicans believe that 
Donald Trump is the true President, 
not Joe Biden. That is what the Big Lie 
has caused. The majority of one of 
America’s two major political parties 
doesn’t believe our President is the ac-
tual President. 
Now more than ever, both parties 
must stand up to the Big Lie and shine 
a light on the truth of the 2020 elec-
tions and what happened on January 6. 
Yet it seems our Republican colleagues 
would rather avoid the subject en-
tirely. The Republican leader, after 
moving the goalposts week after week, 
announced his opposition to the Com-
mission, despite the fact that Demo-
crats agreed to every single request 
made by the House Republican leader. 
One Republican Senator said this 
weekend that it was ‘‘too early’’ to es-
tablish a Commission. Another admit-
ted that many Republicans opposed the 
Commission because they feared it 
would hurt the Republican message in 
the midterm elections. Talk about say-
ing the quiet part out loud. 
The prevailing view among Repub-
licans seems to be that we should 
sweep the Big Lie and all of January 6 
under the rug like it never happened. 
Look, I am sorry that some Repub-
licans believe that a bipartisan inves-
tigation of the attack on our democ-
racy is inconvenient for their midterm 
campaigns, 
but 
the 
Democratic-led 
Congress of the United States is not 
going to sweep January 6 under the 
rug. We are going to vote on the Janu-
ary 6 Commission in the Senate, and 
the American people will see where 
every Member stands: on the side of 
truth or on the side of Donald Trump’s 
Big Lie. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

May 24, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
each year, the month of May is recog-
nized as National Foster Care Month. I 
thank my colleagues for once again 
unanimously passing a resolution rec-
ognizing and bringing awareness to the 
experiences of youth and families in 
the foster care system. 
This month, organizations in Iowa 
and around the entire country have 
been working to support youth in fos-
ter care and the foster parents who 
open their homes to the kids in need. 
And they deserve this recognition. In 
2019, the most recent year for which 
data is available, there were over 
426,000 kids in foster care in the United 
States. In Iowa alone, there were al-
most 6,000. 
As stated in our resolution, Congress 
must continue to work toward real so-
lutions for these young people because 
they face trauma, abuse, and neglect. 
Obviously, there are a lot of them who 
get loving care as well. 
In recent years, lots of changes have 
been made to the way that child wel-
fare works. Congress passed the Family 
First Prevention Services Act in 2018. 
The goal of that act was to provide 
more services to families before remov-
ing children from the home, before that 
action had to be taken. And that is 
where you ought to start—preserve the 
family as much as you can, as long as 
the children are not being mistreated. 
This bill also seeks to help kids who 
age out of foster care have access to 
more support and successfully transi-
tion to adulthood and to independence. 
I was glad to support this legislation, 
and I hope that, as it is implemented, 
we see positive outcomes for these 
young people and their families. All 
children, no matter what their cir-
cumstances, deserve a permanent, lov-
ing home and consistent, caring adults 
in their life. 
When you visit with these young peo-
ple, some of them tell us about being in 
two or three school systems in a year 
so obviously probably in two or three 
different homes in a year. And what 
you hear from them is ‘‘I would like to 
have a mom and dad. I would like to 
have a home. I would like to go to the 
same school for the whole year.’’ They 
want some consistency and some per-
manency. I guess that is what it all 
adds up to. 
Research has shown that the pres-
ence of just one caring adult who is 
available for advice, for support, and 
for guidance can make a meaningful 
difference for children in foster care. 
For some young people, this may be a 
foster parent who maintains a relation-
ship with a child even after temporary 
placement is over. For other kids, this 
may mean an aunt or an uncle, a fam-
ily member who is willing to shoulder 
the responsibilities of providing a lov-
ing home. Others may benefit from a 
court-appointed special advocate, what 
we know as CASA, or a guardian ad 
litem. These are volunteers assigned to 
be a child’s advocate. 
For a system designed to protect 
children, often the child welfare sys-
tem does not give much opportunity 
for a child’s voice to be heard, and it is 
a very important voice to listen to. 
CASAs are often the only adults in the 
court proceedings who are exclusively 
advocating for what the youth in foster 
care wants. I am happy that this year, 
for the first time, May 18 was labeled 
National CASA/GAL Volunteers Day to 
honor the service of these volunteers. 
I salute all those who work tirelessly 
to support kids in foster care in Iowa 
and nationwide. 
When I founded the Senate Caucus on 
Foster Youth in 2009, the special focus 
was to hear directly from the young 
people themselves. Older youth in fos-
ter care and adults who experienced 
foster care as a child can speak to what 
worked for them and, of course, what 
didn’t work. They should always have a 
seat at the table. 
Over and over again, I have heard the 
same thing from kids in foster care, so 
I am repeating what I said previously. 
They want a mom and a dad, they want 
a family, and they want a place to call 
home. For some kids, this goal can be 
met by their family’s getting help with 
mental illness, substance abuse, or 
housing. For others, the dream of a 
family can be found through foster care 
and eventually adoption. For others, 
kinship care provides an opportunity 
for stability and permanency. 
There is no one-size-fits-all approach, 
no silver bullet that can help all kids 
the same way, but there is one common 
outcome that we can strive for. We 
should be wary of attempts to undo 
progress that has been made in speed-
ing up adoptions and providing perma-
nency for these children. The goal 
should always be to protect kids from 
neglect and abuse and, at the same 
time, improve their well-being. 
Moving ahead now, Congress must 
continue to work to find better solu-
tions and secure better outcomes for 
youth in foster care. 
Once again, I thank my colleagues 
for passing this resolution recognizing 
May as Foster Care Month. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 1260 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, a 
few hours ago, I had the pleasure of 
joining Secretary Raimondo and Sen-
ator WARNER of Virginia for a tour of 
the 
Micron 
Technologies 
manufac-
turing plant just outside Washington, 
DC, in Manassas, VA. This is one of the 
great companies with facilities that 
produce semiconductors on U.S. soil. 
Secretary Raimondo, Senator WAR-
NER, and I were given a behind-the- 
scenes tour of how these advanced 
chips, or semiconductors, are made, 
and we discussed some of the reasons 
why it is more expensive to build these 
facilities in the United States. 
The average American uses countless 
products every day that could not func-
tion without semiconductors. For ev-
erything from cell phones, to tele-
visions, to cars and dishwashers, chips 
underpin our most-used technology. As 
we become more technology dependent, 
it is going to get nothing but more im-
portant. But it is not just consumer 
products; cell towers, water treatment 
plants, agricultural equipment, our en-
ergy grid—semiconductors make all of 
that possible. 
These tiny technologies also play a 
huge role in our national defense. When 
we send our troops on a mission by 
land, sea, air, or even in cyber space, 
they need the best equipment avail-
able. Now more than ever, the equip-
ment can’t function without these 
chips. 
Just look at Israel’s Iron Dome mis-
sile defense system. This highly sophis-
ticated system of rocket interceptors is 
a great example of the role that chips 
play in national security—not only 
ours but of our allies’ as well. We know 
that the number of civilian casualties 
that would be caused if not for the pro-
tection of the Iron Dome for the Israeli 
people would be significantly higher. I 
asked my staff to find out how many 
semiconductors are actually in one of 
those interceptors that knock out one 
of those rockets coming from Hamas. 
What I found out is that every single 
one of these interceptors contains more 
than 750 different semiconductors. 
So it is not hyperbole to say that 
there are life-and-death consequences 
to a reliable semiconductor supply 
chain, but right now, we are in a seri-
ously vulnerable situation. Over the 
last two decades, the United States has 
gone from producing roughly a quarter 
of the world’s semiconductors to about 
12 percent. At the same time, China, 
our rival, our competitor that we are 
talking about a lot this week and last, 
has gone from manufacturing zero 
chips to now 16 percent of the world’s 
supply, and it plans to invest another 
$1.4 trillion in semiconductor tech-
nologies. 
Right now, China is building 17 fabs, 
or manufacturing facilities, in China. 
We are maybe thinking about building 
one, through Taiwan Semiconductor in 
Arizona, but it depends on our willing-
ness and ability to support that domes-
tic manufacturing whether or not they 
actually 
complete 
that 
currently 
planned manufacturing facility. But 
when we are looking to our adversaries 
to supply the technology to power our 
most critical devices and systems, it is 
a huge problem. 
The global shortage we are seeing 
right now is a glimpse of what things 
could look like and worse. The lack of 
supply has forced companies across the

full range of impacted industries to 
scale back production or hit pause al-
together. We have seen that particu-
larly in the car manufacture business. 
This shortage has led to some serious 
consequences. If companies have to 
shut down production, which is hap-
pening right now, due to lack of supply 
of semiconductors, there are hard- 
working Americans who aren’t able to 
earn a paycheck. This impact, as I have 
suggested, is now being felt by auto-
workers across the country. 
But we have every expectation that 
in a few months things will get back to 
normal. Those production lines will 
start back up, workers will be back on 
the job, and life will carry on hopefully 
as normal. 
But the bigger question we need to 
ask is how would we fare if our supply 
chain to advance semiconductors was 
cut off entirely. Let’s say it is another 
pandemic or a natural disaster or, 
heaven forbid, a military conflict in 
the South China Sea. 
Nearly 90 percent of the world’s chips 
are made in Southeast Asia. If that 
supply was cut off for any reason, what 
would 
we 
do? 
The 
consequences 
wouldn’t be limited to a few bells and 
whistles on new cars. It would impact 
our missile defense systems, the F–35— 
the 
fifth 
generation 
Joint 
Strike 
Fighter—advanced weapons systems, 
quantum computing, and the full range 
of equipment and technologies our na-
tional defense depends on. If we don’t 
have the ability to provide our troops 
with the technology they need to be 
successful, what would we do? 
Well, the risks of carrying on busi-
ness as usual are far too high for us to 
even contemplate that scenario. There 
is a clear need to invest in domestic 
semiconductor manufacturing and se-
cure perhaps our most vulnerable sup-
ply chain. As we continue to debate the 
most effective ways to confront threats 
from China and bolster our national 
and economic security, there is no 
question that funding to shore up do-
mestic semiconductor manufacturing 
is a must-do. 
Last year, Senator WARNER, the sen-
ior Senator from Virginia, and I intro-
duced the CHIPS for America Act, and 
it was adopted by an amendment to the 
National Defense Authorization Act 
with broad bipartisan support on a vote 
of 96 to 4—a rare thing these days. That 
bill became law earlier this year, and 
now we have the important job of pro-
viding the funding for it, something I 
hope we can achieve through the legis-
lation that is before the Senate today. 
During the committee consideration 
of the bill, an amendment was added 
that would apply the controversial pre-
vailing wage language to this portion 
of the bill. Considering the current 
wages of U.S. semiconductor manufac-
turing 
companies, 
it 
really 
is 
a 
nonissue. But what is an issue is expan-
sion of Davis-Bacon prevailing wage 
provisions, not for public works but to 
private companies. And I believe the 
inclusion of this provision includes 
some roadblocks on the way to passage 
of this final legislation. 
So last week I introduced the amend-
ment to strike this unnecessary and di-
visive provision and to protect the 
broad bipartisan support this legisla-
tion has already received. A controver-
sial provision that doesn’t even enact 
any real change is hardly a reason to 
let the funding go down the drain, and 
it really is just an unnecessary distrac-
tion. We don’t need any other speed 
bumps in our ability to pass this im-
portant bipartisan legislation. 
I hope our colleagues will continue to 
work with us in good faith to reach a 
compromise that will earn broad bipar-
tisan support. 
Last year the CHIPS for America 
Act, as I said, passed with a vote of 96 
to 4, and there is no reason why this 
critical funding that we will be voting 
on this week should be politicized now. 
NOMINATION OF CHIQUITA BROOKS-LASURE 
Finally, Madam President, on an-
other matter, this evening the Senate 
will take up a procedural vote on the 
President’s nominee for the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
CMS, as we all know, plays a vital 
role in providing healthcare to our 
most 
vulnerable 
populations. 
More 
than 4 million Texans, including half of 
our children, depend on the stability of 
our State’s Medicaid Program to pro-
vide healthcare for them and their 
families. And in States across the 
country, Medicare funding is vital to 
the health of our most vulnerable 
friends and neighbors for everything 
from an emergency room visit to men-
tal healthcare. But that could soon 
change. 
The Biden administration has taken 
the unprecedented step of rescinding an 
agreement with my State and the pre-
vious administration to maintain the 
stability of our State’s Medicaid Pro-
gram. Under this agreement, Texas was 
set to receive approximately $11 billion 
a year over the next decade to provide 
healthcare for our underserved popu-
lation. Low-income individuals and 
those in rural areas are especially reli-
ant on this funding, as are those who 
need mental healthcare. Mental and 
behavioral health providers alone re-
ceive about $300 million a year. 
When asked for the reasoning behind 
this dangerous and frankly shocking 
move, rescinding a prior agreement ex-
tending our 1115 waiver, CMS said it 
was to correct their administrative 
error—their error. But two anonymous 
Federal healthcare officials, I believe, 
did something that is all too rare here 
in Washington: They actually said the 
truth. They explained the real rea-
soning to the Washington Post. They 
said it was done ‘‘to push state officials 
toward accepting the Affordable Care 
Act’s Medicaid expansion.’’ 
So, in effect, the administration is 
doing something that the Supreme 
Court of the United States said it can-
not do, which is to hold a gun to the 
head of the States and force them to 
accept Medicaid expansion. So now 
what they couldn’t do under the Su-
preme Court’s decision, they are trying 
to do now by holding our healthcare 
hostage in order to force the expansion 
of Medicaid into our State. That is a 
choice left up to the Governor and our 
elected legislature, not one to be made 
by bureaucrats with the Department of 
Health and Human Services or CMS. 
While patients in Texas may be the 
first ones caught in this political game, 
I have no expectation that they will be 
the last. As a matter of fact, there are 
only four States that don’t have ap-
proved or pending 1115 waivers, which 
is what we are talking about—four. 
There are only four that don’t have 
those. So every other State beyond 
those four could be in the same situa-
tion my State is in, in the coming 
months. Whether it is Florida, Ten-
nessee, North Carolina, South Caro-
lina, Missouri, Idaho—the list of States 
that could be impacted by this life-and- 
death game of political chicken is a 
long one. 
Of course, this all comes at a time 
when our healthcare system is already 
in fragile condition after more than a 
year of battling COVID–19. And the pa-
tients whose healthcare relies on the 
stability of the Medicaid system are 
those who have faced the biggest chal-
lenges during the pandemic. 
I have asked the Biden administra-
tion to work with the State to ensure 
that millions of impacted individuals 
won’t lose access to healthcare, but so 
far there has been little or no progress. 
The administration has been unable to 
provide me any assurance that an 
agreement could be reached before the 
end of this fiscal year—something that 
would have dire consequences on our 
providers and especially those in be-
havioral and mental health. 
To state the obvious, the nominee to 
lead CMS, Ms. Brooks-LaSure, did not 
personally rescind the Texas Medicaid 
waiver. As a matter of fact, she hasn’t 
been confirmed yet; so she couldn’t. 
But before her nomination could ad-
vance, Members of the Senate deserve 
a commitment from the administra-
tion that it won’t try to force the hand 
of other States, including Texas, by 
putting the healthcare of millions of 
vulnerable citizens on the line. 
If we don’t stand up now and push 
back on this reckless move, who will be 
next? Which State will be next? How 
far will the administration go to force 
States into enacting laws that they do 
not want to enact? 
CMS 
funding 
is 
vital 
to 
the 
healthcare of millions of my constitu-
ents and to the stability of our entire 
healthcare system. CMS cannot be used 
as the administration’s strong arm to 
coerce States into accepting its polit-
ical demands, which is all this is. 
I appreciate Ms. Brooks-LaSure’s ex-
perience in working with States to de-
velop these types of waivers and her 
willingness to meet with me on this 
issue, but frankly this is a decision 
being made above her in the food chain. 
But my State has not so far received

an assurance that this action will be 
rectified, and it looks like the adminis-
tration is intent on pulling the rug out 
from under our poorest and most needy 
patients. 
For that reason, I cannot support 
this nominee, and I urge my colleagues 
to stand with me and, in doing so, 
stand up for the healthcare of their 
most vulnerable constituents, too, and 
pushing the administration to find an 
alternate and satisfactory path for-
ward. If the administration will take 
aim at the healthcare of 4 million vul-
nerable Texans, they will do it to any-
one. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
MEMORIAL DAY 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, a week from today, we will be 
celebrating Memorial Day. I know 
folks back home probably have some 
fun things planned for the long week-
end—cookouts, 
family 
gatherings, 
maybe even a trip to the beach. 
But while Memorial Day is a joyous, 
carefree weekend for many families, it 
is a reminder of what they lost—a fa-
ther, a mother, husband, or a wife, a 
son, daughter, brother, sister, a family 
member, a friend that cannot be re-
placed. 
Our Gold Star families have given a 
great sacrifice to our country. I have 
been there myself. My father served in 
World War II, driving a tanker across 
Europe. He earned five Bronze Stars 
and a Purple Heart. After the war, he 
died on Active Duty. 
And I still miss him today. I am for-
ever grateful that he, like so many 
folks from his generation, put on that 
uniform. They enlisted, not knowing 
whether they would ever come home. 
Many 
of 
them—hundreds 
of 
thou-
sands—did not. 
But they knew what they were doing 
was worth the danger. They knew the 
United States of America and all she 
stood for was worth defending. They 
earned the title of the ‘‘greatest gen-
eration.’’ 
I will be introducing a resolution this 
week honoring the immense sacrifice 
of the ‘‘greatest generation’’ and not 
just those who put on the uniform. 
This resolution recognizes the millions 
of Americans who worked in the fac-
tories, bought war bonds, and donated 
their pots, pans, and more to a war ef-
fort. We owe the ‘‘greatest generation’’ 
a debt we can never fully repay. 
I want to take a moment to thank 
Mr. Sam Romano from Vestavia Hills, 
AL, for advocating on behalf of the 
‘‘greatest generation’’ and his con-
tributions to this resolution. 
Today, we have more than a million 
Active-Duty service men and women 
who continue to defend our freedoms. 
They, too, stand ready to answer the 
call when evil threatens America. 
They, too, stand ready to give their 
lives to defend their country, if need 
be. 
The United States stands on the 
foundation of generations of service 
men and women who gave their lives to 
defend their country. Their sacrifices 
created the most free and prosperous 
country in the history of the world. 
We are not perfect, far from it, but 
our unique system of government is 
distinguished from any other—‘‘of the 
people, by the people, and for the peo-
ple.’’ That is why I stand for the flag 
and for our national anthem because 
for the last 250 years, men and women 
have given their lives for all this flag 
represents. They gave their lives to de-
fend our right to make our country 
better. 
The continued service of our military 
allows us to have that barbecue this 
weekend. Their service allows us to 
gather freely with family and friends, 
to think, to worship, and live how we 
want to. Memorial Day reminds us that 
our freedom and prosperity comes at a 
cost. 
So for this upcoming Memorial Day 
weekend, I would encourage all of us to 
take a moment to remember what we 
are celebrating: the brave men and 
women who laid down their lives for 
ours. Let’s honor our soldiers’ sacrifice 
by keeping our country strong and up-
holding the values they gave their lives 
to defend. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, this month is Military Apprecia-
tion Month. It is a month when we let 
our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines 
know just how grateful we are for their 
service. 
Madam 
President, 
we 
are 
grateful for the service that you gave 
our Nation in uniform. We thank you 
for that. 
Tennessee is home to three major 
military installations and numerous 
other Guard installations. For us, Mili-
tary Appreciation Month actually lasts 
all year long. 
I would like to start off by wel-
coming the 101st Airborne Division’s 
2nd Squadron, 17th Calvary Regiment 
back stateside following a 9-month ro-
tational deployment to Korea. We are 
so happy to have them back home. 
In more exciting news out of Fort 
Campbell, 
this 
Thursday, 
SGM 
Veronica Knapp will become the first 
woman to serve as a command sergeant 
major of a U.S. Army division. She will 
assume responsibility as the senior en-
listed adviser of the 101st Airborne Di-
vision. 
On behalf of the entire Tennessee del-
egation, I offer my congratulations and 
wish her success in all that is yet to 
come. 
The 
servicemembers 
stationed 
at 
Fort Campbell have really had a very 
busy past year. Starting last March, we 
began deploying soldiers to help with 
COVID–19 response operations across 
the Northeast, including members from 
the 501st Medical Company, the 531st 
Hospital Center, and the 101st Division 
Sustainment Brigade. 
Boston and New York City were 
among the most severely affected areas 
in the country. And if you ask the 
healthcare workers and city officials in 
those areas if Tennessee servicemem-
bers made a difference, they will tell 
you, yes, without a doubt. 
Last year, many of our Tennessee 
National Guard members also joined 
the fight against COVID–19. The 164th 
Airlift Wing transported desperately 
needed PPE all the way from Italy to 
healthcare workers across the entire 
country. The 118th ISR Group, along 
with five other Air National Guard tar-
geting units, produced over 70 percent 
of the U.S. Air Force’s targeting mate-
rials, all while providing continuity to 
Activity-Duty units. 
I want to keep bragging on our Guard 
members because they really have 
made an impact, especially when it 
comes to getting testing and vaccine 
centers up and running. They set up 
more static vaccine sites than any 
other State. As of March of this year, 
they have set up double the number of 
sites that were running in the next 
most successful State. Job well done. 
They directly helped more than 1 
million 
Tennesseans 
stay 
healthy 
through the pandemic. It was a great 
effort, and we thank them for that. 
I am sorry to say that the pandemic 
wasn’t the only natural disaster Ten-
nesseans had to deal with over the past 
year. But when tornados destroyed 
multiple counties across West and Mid-
dle Tennessee, the National Guard was 
right there to help. And when blizzards 
shut down half the State, the Guard 
kept water flowing in Memphis, re-
paired communications infrastructure 
for 
first 
responders 
in 
Rutherford 
County, and found shelter for displaced 
families in Lynchburg and Manchester. 
When you are on the outside looking 
in on a natural disaster, the last thing 
you want to hear is that local officials 
had to call in the National Guard. But 
I will tell you, when you are sitting in 
the aftermath, there is no more hopeful 
sight than a vehicle full of guardsmen 
pulling into town ready to help. 
That peace of mind, of course, comes 
at a cost. Our servicemembers go where 
they are told to go and do the jobs they 
are told to do without hesitation. Why? 
Because they have accepted that the 
cost of freedom is more important than 
the freedom they sacrificed when they 
put on the uniform. Their families have 
accepted this too. And when you are a 
military family, the uniform comes 
first. This is why every year when we 
re-up defense funding, we put special 
focus on military families and their 
needs. 
For example, 2 years ago, we estab-
lished a pilot program to offer profes-
sional licensed reciprocity for military 
spouses who want to continue working

after moving across State lines. Last 
year, we increased funding for that pro-
gram. 
We also continued our support for the 
Preservation of the Force and Families 
Program, which helps special operators 
process the aftereffects of their mis-
sions. 
Last month, the Presiding Officer 
and I introduced a bill called the Mili-
tary Hunger Prevention Act. This is an 
incredibly important piece of legisla-
tion that would create a basic needs al-
lowance for low-income military fami-
lies. 
The reason this is so important is 
that existing benefits programs like 
SNAP and free school lunches include 
housing allowances and other military 
benefits in revenue calculations. Al-
though it is obvious that this only cre-
ates the appearance of higher income, 
the programs aren’t designed to allow 
an exception. Once we pass this bill— 
and I am sure that we will—these fami-
lies will be able to use their allowances 
to buy groceries instead of relying on 
food pantries to put dinner on the 
table. 
This is what we should all be think-
ing about during Military Appreciation 
Month—renewing the commitment we 
have made to take care of our service-
members both on and off the battle-
field. 
We need to ask ourselves: What are 
we doing to meet their practical needs? 
What are we doing to support their 
families? What are we doing to right 
unintended wrongs? 
It is the most important way we can 
recognize their extraordinary service 
to our Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF CHIQUITA BROOKS-LASURE 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the 
Senate is now debating the nomination 
of Chiquita Brooks-LaSure to head the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services. 
This is clearly one of the most impor-
tant healthcare jobs in America. Ms. 
Brooks-LaSure 
brings 
decades 
of 
health policy experience to the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 
and I think it would be fair to say that 
she has worked on healthcare from just 
about every angle short of scrubbing 
into the operating room herself. I am 
going to talk, in a minute, about her 
qualifications, but I also want, as we 
start this discussion, to recognize that 
this is a job that requires urgent, 
hands-on professionalism—exactly the 
kind Ms. Brooks-LaSure brings to this. 
We are, obviously, still working 
through enormous challenges on the 
COVID–19 pandemic. There are efforts 
by colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
on healthcare, and we, in particular, on 
this side want to expand healthcare 
coverage, bring down the cost of pre-
scription medicine, and bring the Medi-
care guarantee into the 21st century. 
The American people need a chief of 
Medicare and Medicaid as soon as pos-
sible, and blocking this nomination 
slows down important work that needs 
to be done. Senators on the other side 
have objected to moving forward with 
the nomination. So I am going to talk 
for just a few minutes about these con-
cerns—but, first, a little bit more 
about Ms. Brooks-LaSure. 
Starting out, she worked at the Of-
fice of Management and Budget on 
Medicaid policy and the CHIP program, 
the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram. So she was, long ago, focused on 
trying to improve healthcare for the 
millions of Americans who every single 
day walk an economic tightrope in bal-
ancing the food bill against the fuel 
bill and the fuel bill against healthcare 
costs. She was there for them. 
She then moved to the House Ways 
and Means Committee as a senior staff 
member. She helped to write portions 
of the Affordable Care Act dealing with 
expanding coverage and updating the 
Medicare guarantee. 
When the Affordable Care Act be-
came law, she went to Health and 
Human Services, and there she played 
an important role in implementing the 
law. She was the leader in the effort to 
create marketplaces for health insur-
ance with strong, built-in consumer 
protections. She has been a leader 
when it comes to defending and ex-
panding women’s healthcare under the 
Affordable Care Act and other essential 
programs. After leaving HHS, she went 
to the private sector and continued to 
work on policies that expanded cov-
erage and made healthcare more af-
fordable. 
Ms. Brooks-LaSure has the qualifica-
tions, the experience, and the know- 
how to run Medicare and Medicaid, and 
there are absolutely no questions about 
it. 
Now, our colleague from Texas, Sen-
ator CORNYN, has raised objections to 
moving the nomination forward. His 
objections relate to a decision by the 
Biden administration to rescind a Med-
icaid policy waiver that the Trump ad-
ministration rushed to grant the State 
of Texas in mid-January. There are a 
few key points Members ought to un-
derstand about this issue. 
First, nothing is going to change for 
health providers and patients in Texas 
for more than a year as a result of this 
decision. That means there is plenty of 
time to work out a solution that 
doesn’t get rushed and follows the 
right process with public comment. 
Second, Ms. Brooks-LaSure had noth-
ing to do with the decision that Sen-
ator CORNYN
is unhappy about. She 
wasn’t on the job when it was made. 
Third, she made clear in her Finance 
Committee hearing that she is com-
mitted to working on a bipartisan basis 
with State officials, and she said that 
to Senator CORNYN and to other Repub-
lican members on this issue as well. 
She has the track record and the expe-
rience to get that done. 
I want to state again to our colleague 
from Texas and to every Member of the 
Senate: I probably spent as much time 
as any Member of the Senate working 
on the issue that the Senator from 
Texas is concerned about, and that is 
the process for granting waivers. I au-
thored what is called section 1332 of the 
Affordable Care Act that was designed 
to say that progressive States that, for 
example, wanted to pursue a public op-
tion or aggregate Medicare and Med-
icaid money would have a chance to do 
it as long as they would adhere to the 
guardrails. Conservative States that 
sought to try their own approaches 
based on their ideas of a conservative 
approach to healthcare could do it as 
long as they met the coverage require-
ments of the Affordable Care Act. 
I want to state again to Senator COR-
NYN, as I did in the Senate Finance 
Committee, that I am going to work 
very closely with him, after we confirm 
this nominee, to address the issues 
that he discussed in the committee 
that have concerned him. 
To every Member who has issues with 
respect to waivers, I want each to 
know that there will be bipartisan in-
terest in trying to bring people in their 
States together and adhering to the 
ideas in the Affordable Care Act, which 
states that States are free to pursue 
their own ideas for expanding coverage 
as long as they stay within the guard-
rails of the program. 
We understand that Democrats and 
Republicans aren’t going to agree on 
every health policy question. What I do 
know is that Ms. Brooks-LaSure is 
going to be the kind of CMS Adminis-
trator who can bring two sides to-
gether exactly as we envisioned in the 
Affordable Care Act with the waiver 
law and exactly as I have committed to 
working with Senator CORNYN on. 
The Finance Committee has dem-
onstrated that it can work together on 
big issues. In 2017, the committee 
passed the CHRONIC Care Act, which 
was a fundamental transformation of 
Medicare. 
I have told my colleagues that back 
when I was director of the Gray Pan-
thers, Medicare was about acute care. 
There was Part A, which was for hos-
pitals, and Part B, which was for doc-
tors. That was it. That was Medicare. 
When I taught gerontology, the first 
question on an exam was, What is the 
difference between Part A and Part B? 
That isn’t Medicare anymore. Medi-
care, today, is primarily about chronic 
disease: cancer and diabetes and heart 
disease and stroke and chronic pul-
monary disease. 
The Finance Committee wrote the 
CHRONIC Care Act on a bipartisan 
basis. At that point, Chairman Hatch 
was chairman of the committee, and I 
was the ranking Democrat. We worked 
in a bipartisan way, but the Trump ad-
ministration, after the retirement of 
Chairman Hatch, basically put every-
thing on the back burner. 
When 
we 
confirm 
Ms. 
Brooks- 
LaSure—and I am convinced that she is 
going to be confirmed—she will work 
with Democrats and Republicans to

make sure we are updating the Medi-
care guarantee for this century. In par-
ticular, what that involves is making 
sure that there are more opportunities 
for those who receive traditional Medi-
care to get the benefits of the CHRON-
IC Care Act. Already, the CHRONIC 
Care Act works well for what is called 
Medicare Advantage. We need to do 
more to make sure it is available for 
those who receive traditional Medi-
care. 
Now, there are other issues the Fi-
nance Committee is working on that 
Ms. Brooks-LaSure will play an impor-
tant role in—one being improving men-
tal 
healthcare 
because 
mental 
healthcare has gotten short shrift in 
America for far too long. We know that 
Americans feel like they are getting 
mugged when they walk into a phar-
macy and go to the window to get their 
prescription medicines. Look, for ex-
ample, at insulin. Insulin prices have 
gone up twelvefold in recent years. The 
drug is not 12 times better. It is the 
same drug, but they are getting clob-
bered because the pharmaceutical com-
panies can get away with it. So those 
are the kinds of practices that Ms. 
Brooks-LaSure is going to take on, and 
she is going to do it in a bipartisan 
way. 
The Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services is right at the center of 
taking on these and other important 
healthcare challenges. This critical 
Agency—one of the most important 
places in American healthcare—needs a 
leader, and it needs one now. She is, in 
my view, an excellent nominee. She is 
going to work with both sides here in 
the Senate, including on the issue our 
colleague Senator CORNYN has raised. I 
want to restate my interest in working 
with both Ms. Brooks-LaSure and Sen-
ator CORNYN on this matter my col-
league from Texas has raised. 
We are going to be voting in a couple 
of minutes, colleagues, and I urge a 
strong vote for an eminently qualified 
nominee, Ms. Chiquita Brooks-LaSure. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise today to address the need to re-
form our military justice system. 
Just this month, the Department of 
Defense released its annual report on 
sexual assault in the military. That re-
port and more than a decade of data on 
sexual assault in the military show a 
clear and disturbing trend. Reports of 
sexual assault have increased virtually 
every single year and remain at record 
highs, while prosecution and convic-
tion rates have declined, including a 
shocking 10 percent point decline in 
the prosecution rate from last year. By 
every measure that you can imagine, 
we are moving in the wrong direction. 
Congress has given the military more 
than $1 billion—$500 million in fiscal 
year 2019 alone—enacted hundreds of 
provisions, and chartered special pan-
els, Commissions, and advisory com-
mittees to address this problem. Not 
one of these steps has reduced the prev-
alence rate of sexual assaults within 
the ranks. We are still getting reports 
like the one we got from Fort Hood, 
which found that the world’s largest 
Army base was ‘‘a permissive environ-
ment for sexual assault and sexual har-
assment.’’ We are right where we start-
ed. Nothing has changed. 
I have heard from too many survivors 
who have barely come forward in 
search of justice, only to have their 
cases outright declined by the chain of 
command and then face more harass-
ment and retaliation for reporting 
their assailant. We owe it to our serv-
icemembers to do more to prevent 
these crimes and properly prosecute 
them when they occur. 
Our bill, the Military Justice Im-
provement and Increasing Prevention 
Act, would ensure that, when these 
crimes are committed, justice is deliv-
ered. It does so by taking the same ap-
proach to these cases that the military 
takes in almost every other area of op-
eration. It puts highly technical work 
in the hands of trained specialists. 
This bipartisan and commonsense re-
form moves the decision on whether to 
prosecute 
serious 
crimes 
to 
inde-
pendent, trained, and professional mili-
tary prosecutors while leaving mis-
demeanors 
and 
uniquely 
military 
crimes within the chain of command. 
In other words, it will let prosecutors 
prosecute and commanders command. 
By moving this work off of the com-
mander’s plate, it will empower com-
mand to focus on mission-critical ac-
tivities and on rebuilding the trust 
among their ranks that we know is 
critical to military readiness. 
This bill is not political. It is about 
doing the right thing for our service-
members who do so much for this Na-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3327 
May 24, 2021 
The Military Justice Improvement 
and Increasing Prevention Act has bi-
partisan, filibuster-proof support. It is 
supported by 63 Senators, including 42 
Democrats, 2 Independents, and 19 Re-
publicans, and the majority of the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee. If we 
brought this bill to the floor today, it 
would pass. 
We have the legislation, and we have 
the votes. Now we just need the will to 
act. I urge all of my colleagues to join 
me in working to pass this bill as 
quickly as possible. As this week’s De-
partment of Defense report makes 
clear, our servicemembers do not have 
time to wait. 
I yield the floor to Senator GRASS-
LEY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
time has come for this bill to pass. 
After 8 years of Senator GILLIBRAND’s 
work in this area, it proves that she is 
a Senator who doesn’t give up, and it 
proves that she is a Senator who can 
bring bipartisanship to a city that 
needs more bipartisanship. 
So I, like her, call on my colleagues 
to pass this bill, the Military Justice 
Improvement and Increasing Preven-
tion Act, by unanimous consent. 
I first joined Senator GILLIBRAND in 
advocating for this legislation in 2013, 
after truly horrifying reports out of 
the Pentagon about the rate of sexual 
assault and other criminal offenses 
going unpunished and a recommenda-
tion from a Commission on how to im-
prove the system. 
Whether it is in the military or 
whether it is outside the military, a 
crime is a crime, and it ought to be 
punished. It shouldn’t be overlooked, 
as so often is what happens in the mili-
tary. 
We have been pushing for this bill 
ever since, despite promises from the 
Department of Defense that they had 
everything under control. We heard, 
time and time again, about new initia-
tives to stop sexual assaults and har-
assment. Yet things are worse today 
than when we started out. 
They haven’t worked. In the most re-
cent review, almost 21,000 soldiers were 
victims of sexual assault. Only 4 per-
cent of the cases went to trial, and 62 
percent of those who reported sexual 
assault experienced retaliation—retal-
iation just because you shouldn’t be 
hurt just because you are in the mili-
tary and people can get away with it. 
In two-thirds of these cases, the retal-
iation comes from inside the chain of 
command. 
The Department of Defense has had 
more than enough time to try their 
way to fix this problem, and it is clear 
a new approach is needed. It is the 
same approach that Senator GILLI-
BRAND has been trying to get done in 
this body for the last 8 years, and we 
have always been put off because of 
these promises that were never carried 
out. 
By moving the decision to prosecute 
out of the chain of command, perpetra-
tors of sexual assault and other serious 
crimes will be held accountable and 
should be held accountable. Survivors 
will have more confidence in the proc-
ess. Retaliation will be less likely. 
This year, there is fresh support for 
the effort. The new Secretary of De-
fense, Secretary Austin, has indicated 
that addressing this issue is a priority. 
A Department of Defense panel of ex-
perts that was convened recommended 
taking the decisions out of the chain of 
command. The President has signaled 
his support, and the bill in the Senate 
has over 60 bipartisan cosponsors, in-
cluding my fellow Senator from Iowa 
JONI ERNST. 
We have been waiting almost a dec-
ade. There is no need to wait any 
longer. I urge my colleagues to show 
unanimous support for protecting our 
men and women in military and allow 
this bill to pass. After 8 years and a 
demonstrated need in the recent 2 or 3 
years for bipartisanship, it is right 
here in this bill. It deserves to be han-
dled as a standalone piece of legisla-
tion. 
I am glad that this bill earned the 
support of Senator ERNST, and she was 
key in getting the cloture-proof major-
ity that we have for this bill. 
I would now yield to Senator ERNST. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I want to 
thank my senior Senator from Iowa for 
being the lead Republican on this bill, 
and I am rising today as well to sup-
port my colleague in her request today 
for consideration of the Military Jus-
tice Improvement and Increasing Pre-
vention Act. 
Our service men and women—all of 
them—are volunteers. They represent 
some of the best our Nation has to 
offer. They choose to serve. They swear 
to protect against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic, and to defend the Con-
stitution. In this day and age, they 
face many risks, but they should not 
face the risk of sexual assault from 
within their own ranks. 
For years, the military has struggled 
to reduce the number of sexual assaults 
within the ranks. Yet we have seen lit-
tle progress in defeating this scourge. 
The stories from survivors are heart-
breaking: servicemembers who are at-
tacked by their own teammates; serv-
icemembers whose lives are turned up-
side down; servicemembers who are 
abandoned by their chain of command; 
servicemembers who receive no justice; 
and servicemembers who are left with 
the scars, often physical but always 
psychological, of a terrible experience. 
I know these stories not just from 
the retelling by survivors of sexual as-
sault but from being a survivor of sex-
ual assault myself. It is time we take 
new action to stop these attacks, to 
bring justice for the victims and to pre-
vent these actions going forward. 
Our bill, with over 60 cosponsors, Re-
publicans and Democrats from all po-
litical philosophies, and the endorse-
ment of veterans groups, survivors 
groups, and individual servicemembers, 
does that. And our bipartisan bill takes 
steps to ensure the unit commander is 
still involved and aware of what is 
going on within the unit. 
This bill also puts in place measures 
for the prevention of sexual assault. It 
increases security on our bases and sta-
tions. It trains leaders from the top to 
the bottom on developing a better com-
mand climate. It reinforces training on 
prevention of sexual assault. 
If a foreign power were to attack any 
of our service men and women over-
seas, there would be a stampede of Sen-
ators coming to the floor and demand-
ing action. Now I hear only the foot-
steps of those coming to stop us from 
consideration of something that would 
help prevent attacks on our service 
men and women by one of their own. It 
is time for action, and I urge my col-
leagues to pass this time agreement. 
Mr. President, with that, I yield to 
the Senator from Connecticut Senator 
BLUMENTHAL. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
thank the Senator from Iowa, our col-
league and friend, for those really elo-
quent and powerful remarks. I thank 
her and our other colleague from Iowa, 
who has been beside us from the very 
start of this cause 8 years or more ago. 
But most importantly, I thank my col-
league from New York, who has been 
unstoppable, steadfast, and resolute in 
this cause. We are here today with that 
overwhelming, bipartisan support be-
cause of her advocacy, her eloquence, 
and power. 
Above all, we are here today because 
of the survivors and victims who have 
come forward with tremendous courage 
and strength. As much courage as it 
takes to be in the military—and I pay 
tribute literally every day to the men 
and women in uniform who defend our 
country, who raise their right hand, 
willing to give their lives—it is equally 
if not more difficult to come forward as 
they have done over these years and 
speak their truth to us. I have been so 
impressed by their bravery and by 
their truth-telling. 
I know as a prosecutor how difficult 
reporting this crime is in the civilian 
world, in universities, in the work-
place. It is excruciatingly difficult to 
come forward and overcome the stigma 
and sometimes shame and the threat of 
retaliation. It is that threat of retalia-
tion that we need to counter and stop 
because reporting of this crime is al-
ways difficult. Underreporting is a 
chronic problem in prosecuting it. 
So taking it out of the chain of com-
mand, eliminating the prospect of re-
taliation, implicit fear, even if it is not 
spoken—it may be unspoken—and that 
is what our purpose is. It is not just 
taking sexual assault out of the chain

of command of decision but also felo-
nies, serious crimes that may be inter-
twined and interrelated with sexual as-
sault, as they so often are in the civil-
ian world, whether it is obstruction, in-
timidation of witnesses, assault, other 
crimes that may be related to it. 
So I believe sincerely that this Sec-
retary of Defense is committed to end-
ing sexual assault. I talked to one of 
the nominees for a prominent position 
in the Department of Defense; I believe 
he is firmly committed. I have talked 
to others who have been confirmed or 
who will be nominated; they are firmly 
committed. 
Let’s make that commitment real 
and approve this legislation because 
the numbers have belied the promises. 
The results have betrayed the good in-
tention, and now it is time for action. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, as 
if in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that at a time to be de-
termined by the majority leader, in 
consultation with the Republican lead-
er, the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 1520 and the Senate 
proceed to its consideration; that there 
be 2 hours for debate, equally divided 
in the usual form; and that upon the 
use or yielding back of that time, the 
Senate vote on the bill with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. REED. I reserve my right to ob-
ject, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Well, thank you very 
much, Mr. President. I would like to 
first engage in a colloquy with Senator 
INHOFE, the ranking member of the 
committee, on the process we will use 
to consider all the ideas and amend-
ments I expect will be offered by com-
mittee members to address the inves-
tigation and prosecution of sexual as-
sault and related crimes under the 
UCMJ in the annual Defense bill. 
I believe that the committee must 
start from a base that reflected the 
broadest consensus possible among our 
members on how best to move forward 
on 
this 
matter 
and 
on 
the 
rec-
ommendations of Secretary Austin’s 
90-day Independent Review Commis-
sion, or IRC. I understand some mem-
bers would prefer there be nothing in 
our bill on this topic, while others will 
feel that the IRC recommendations do 
not go far enough. This is the nature of 
compromise and why I intend to in-
clude the IRC recommendations on ac-
countability in the base markup of the 
fiscal year 2022 Defense bill, subject to 
amendment. I believe we will have a 
robust debate, and I commit to ensur-
ing that every idea and amendment 
brought by our committee members is 
given due consideration and receives a 
vote if that is what the member wants. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank 
the chairman, Chairman REED, that 
this important issue deserves a robust 
debate as we consider this year’s Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. I 
would also like to thank Senator GILLI-
BRAND for her leadership and her tenac-
ity on this issue. 
As Senator REED referenced, I am one 
of those who do not support removing 
the commanders from the decision- 
making process. Nevertheless, I appre-
ciate Chairman REED’s commitment to 
ensuring this issue is debated and 
voted on during the full committee 
markup of the NDAA. 
The NDAA markup process is unique 
in the Senate. We debate and resolve 
contentious issues every year. But the 
regular-order process is important and 
has served us well for many, many 
years—actually 60 years. 
When it comes to important issues 
like this, we should not rush anything 
without making sure it is going to do 
the right thing by our servicemembers, 
and so I thank Chairman REED for his 
action. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me also 
thank the ranking member for his com-
ments. I agree that our committee has 
a long tradition of fulsome debate dur-
ing committee markup of the annual 
Defense bill. It is a hallmark of our 
committee. It ensures that everyone’s 
voice is heard, and it is, in my view, 
one of the reasons we have enacted the 
Defense Authorization Act for 60 con-
secutive years. 
But I also want to commend and 
thank Senator GILLIBRAND for her tire-
less advocacy for victims of sexual as-
sault in the Armed Forces over the 
past 8 years, since she first introduced 
a version of this bill in 2013. As I an-
nounced this weekend, I agree with 
Senator GILLIBRAND that the time has 
come to reform how we investigate and 
prosecute sexual assault and other spe-
cial victim crimes in the military. 
The best way to move forward on this 
issue is to ensure that all 26 members 
of the Armed Services Committee have 
their voices heard and to consider this 
legislation in the course of the markup 
of the fiscal year 2022 Defense bill 
scheduled for July. Not only will this 
allow committee members, comprising 
over a quarter of the Senate, to have 
their ideas and amendments consid-
ered, as is our tradition, but it allows 
the administration to provide its input 
as well, as the Independent Review 
Commission that President Biden di-
rected provides us its recommendations 
on accountability in the military jus-
tice system for the investigation and 
prosecution of sexual assault and other 
special victim crimes. We must be able 
to analyze these recommendations col-
lectively as a committee and then con-
sider their value. 
With this in mind, as I said over the 
weekend, I intend to include in the 
chairman’s mark of the fiscal year 2022 
Defense bill, the IRC recommenda-
tions. It is my view that these rec-
ommendations provide the appropriate 
basis from which to consider the wide 
range of amendments and ideas I know 
our members will have. 
I want to stress that all amendments 
offered by Senators on the committee 
will be fully considered during the full 
committee markup. I intend to con-
tinue our tradition of following an 
open amendment process within the 
committee, and I know that is some-
thing the Presiding Officer is quite 
aware of since he participated in the 
committee in a very responsible way 
over many years. 
Further, while the first round of re-
form will focus on the issues of ac-
countability, I hope and intend to in-
corporate the IRC’s recommendations 
on prevention, climate and culture, and 
victim care and support into the bill as 
we move through the legislative year. I 
think these recommendations will be 
critically important to reducing the 
number of sexual assaults in the ranks. 
The focus of the legislation before us 
is adjudication. I think we all would 
prefer that prevention, command cli-
mate—all of these factors be such that 
adjudication is not necessary because 
the crimes, the incidents, the difficul-
ties, the mental and physical anguish 
that victims incur have been avoided 
because we have taken the steps to pre-
vent these actions from taking place in 
our military forces. 
With that, Mr. President, I would ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, 
well, I just want to respond to my col-
leagues and chairman and ranking 
member. While I am extremely grateful 
for their leadership and their willing-
ness to review and take on the IRC rec-
ommendations, the IRC recommenda-
tions are limited. It was only a 60-day 
review of the issue of sexual assault 
and sexual harassment only. It did not 
look at the military justice system 
overall. It did not have the benefit of 8 
years of review, study, and passing re-
lated amendments and changes. 
Our committee has passed over 200— 
or nearly 250—different resolutions and 
changes to how the military deals with 
sexual harassment and sexual assault, 
to no effect. 
Deferring only to the IRC, which is 
an unelected panel that has only 
looked at this issue for 60 days, is not 
sufficient. Not only do we have Sen-
ators on the Armed Services Com-
mittee who have been studying this 
issue for 8 years, making recommenda-
tions and passing laws on this topic for 
8 years, it would seem that to defer to 
a panel that has only looked at this 
issue for 60 days, to one issue, seems ir-
responsible. 
Second, I do not believe that issues of 
this weight and of this significance 
should be dealt with the committee 
only. The Armed Services Committee 
has been working on this issue for 10 
years, and we have seen no improve-
ment in the number of sexual assaults 
in the military and on the rate of pros-
ecution and the rate of conviction. 
That is highly problematic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3329 
May 24, 2021 
Also, when I asked for a vote on this 
measure over the last several years, I 
have been denied a vote on this meas-
ure on the floor by the chairman and 
the ranking member. So they have 
been unable or unwilling to allow me 
to have a vote, given all the bipartisan 
support we have had from the begin-
ning. 
This bill has been bipartisan from 
day one. Senator GRASSLEY has been on 
this bill from day one, as have several 
other Republicans. Today, we now have 
63 cosponsors to this legislation—wide-
ly bipartisan—and more than half of 
the Armed Services Committee. We 
have established that the weight of 
this Senate, in a filibuster-proof major-
ity, wants a floor vote on this and does 
not want to leave it up to the com-
mittee. 
The Armed Services Committee has 
lost their opportunity to claim sole ju-
risdiction over this issue by failing to 
improve this situation over the last 10 
years. In fact, the 250 measures that we 
passed were all approved by various 
panels that took 60 days or 90 days or 
a year to review this issue, and we will-
ingly took those recommendations and 
turned them into law. 
I, too, will willingly take the rec-
ommendations of the IRC board and 
turn them into law because they are 
good and thoughtful recommendations, 
but they are limited. By design, they 
were only allowed to look at two 
crimes—sexual assault and sexual har-
assment—and by not looking at all se-
rious crimes, you are not looking at 
the weight of the problem. 
We now have evidence that has been 
developed since 2017 about racial dis-
parities and how the criminal justice 
system in the military works. 
Protect Our Defenders issued a sig-
nificant report that can be found at 
https://www.protectourdefenders.com/ 
wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ 
Report_20.pdf. 
Mr. President, that report will show 
that Black servicemembers were at 
least 1.29 times and as much as 2.61 
times more likely to have disciplinary 
action taken against them in an aver-
age year across all branches from 2006 
to 2015. These disparities largely did 
not improve and in some cases wors-
ened in the most recent years covered. 
So we have other challenges within 
the military justice system, and now 
we have two areas where we have data 
that the military itself has collected. 
On sexual assault, we have 10 years of 
data, and now on racial disparities and 
racism within the military, we have 
data over the last 3 years, and that has 
to be considered as well. 
So the way to fix both of these prob-
lems is really simple: Professionalize 
the military justice system. Allow seri-
ous crimes to be taken out of the chain 
of command and given to trained mili-
tary prosecutors who do not have bias 
and have highly specialized training. 
If we professionalize the military jus-
tice system, we will see justice done 
because there will be less bias in the 
system and there will be more profes-
sionalism. The combination of those 
two things, we believe, based on what 
military members have told us, will re-
sult in more cases going forward and 
more prosecutions. 
Second, we have the support of mili-
tary justice experts. We have a letter 
from the National Institute of Military 
Justice: 
The National Institute of Military Justice 
recommends transferring prosecutorial dis-
cretion not only for all sex offenses, but also 
for all serious offenses—those for which the 
authorized maximum punishment exceeds 
one year’s confinement. The dividing line is 
a familiar feature [in the] American criminal 
justice [system]. 
These changes will strengthen the fairness 
of military justice and bolster public con-
fidence in the administration. 
Similarly, we have a piece published 
in the Marine Corps Gazette by Capt. 
Lambert Jackson, who has prosecuted 
these cases. He served as trial counsel 
for the 2nd Marine Division and is com-
plex trial counsel. 
He fundamentally understands the 
nature of these cases. He was an oper-
ational law attorney in the 1st Marine 
Division. He says: 
Felony prosecution determinations must 
be vested with trained military attorneys 
rather than commanders; disentangling com-
manders from the often-ugly legal deter-
minations for which they are ill-trained will 
allow commanders to more effectively focus 
their attention on preparing their units for 
conflict. 
While I appreciate the willingness to 
take the recommendations of the panel 
that General Austin has impaneled to 
look at just two crimes and while I 
agree that we should accept those rec-
ommendations—and I intend to push 
them into the mark through our per-
sonnel subcommittee—we also should 
look at the reforms that 63 Senators 
want done. We should also look at the 
reforms that are supported by more 
than half of the Armed Services Com-
mittee members. We deserve a floor 
vote, and we deserve a process that 
cannot be undermined by the com-
mittee. 
I have served on this committee for 
10 years, and the chairman well under-
stands that in conference, bills that 
have passed both sides have been taken 
out. 
You do not have to look further than 
what happened to the safety report lan-
guage. It was passed in the House, 
passed in the Senate, and it is safe to 
report, by the way, that it was offered 
in the Senate by Senator ERNST and me 
in the Armed Services Committee be-
cause it would deal with retaliation. 
That bill was passed in the Senate, 
passed in the House, and taken out in 
conference. That is a problem. 
I do not want to expose this massive 
reform that is a generational reform to 
the whims of those who decide what 
gets taken out in conference. It is not 
acceptable to me to be watered down or 
reduced or minimized by those in con-
ference. That is the risk you run by not 
allowing this to have a floor vote, 
which it deserves. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I want to 
take just a very brief moment and 
thank the chairman and the ranking 
member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee because this is a very signifi-
cant move that is being proposed by 
Senators GILLIBRAND
and GRASSLEY 
and those of us who are cosponsors of 
this legislation. 
It is time to act. It is time to act. If 
we can go back into previous years, I 
have been one of those nay-sayers. I 
have said to others that I was very torn 
about removing this decision from a 
commander’s purview. I was torn. But 
we have not seen improvement when it 
comes to the areas of sexual assault 
and other serious crimes within our 
Nation’s armed services. So it is time 
to take very bold action. It is time to 
take bold action. 
I do share those concerns as so elo-
quently stated by Senator GILLIBRAND 
that we are making a bold proposal 
that we believe now fit for those who 
want prevention, like myself, those 
who want to reform and improve and 
professionalize those prosecutors with-
in the military system. We can bring 
that together and move it forward, but 
that is not going to happen if we see it 
watered down through the process of 
the NDAA. 
I would love to see this bill in its en-
tirety passed. If that can happen 
through the NDAA, so be it. But as 
Senator GILLIBRAND
just stated, we 
have worked on legislation before to 
see it come to fruition in the Senate 
through NDAA, but not have it passed 
and signed into law. So I do share those 
concerns, and I have not had assur-
ances that we could pass the bill in its 
entirety. 
I would also ask that we take this up 
for consideration on the floor. I think 
it is that important to move forward. 
There are a lot of survivors out there 
who would like to see this move for-
ward. I believe that now we also have a 
swell of military members who would 
like to see this bill in its entirety move 
forward. 
This body as a Senate—not just as 
Senate 
Armed 
Services 
Committee 
members, but this body as a Senate— 
this body as a Congress, we do have ci-
vilian oversight of the military and our 
civilian oversight takes into consider-
ation those members, our constituents, 
who are asking for this change. Believe 
me, I am hearing from my constituents 
on this change. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Rhode Is-
land. 
Mr. REED. Madam President, my col-
leagues have expressed overwhelming 
confidence in this bill, and I don’t 
think that confidence will be eroded 
through more careful consideration by 
the committee. I think, in fact, the 
committee process will allow us to in-
corporate, examine, accept some and 
reject 
other 
provisions 
and 
rec-
ommendations by the IRC.

It also, I think, will empower or 
allow us to consider something that we 
really have considered as consistently 
as the issue of sexual assault, and that 
is the indications that racial bias is 
such that all felonies must be taken 
out of the hands of commanders, not 
just those related to individual sexual 
assault or sexual harassment cases or 
other related sexual conduct or mis-
conduct—I 
should 
rightly 
advocate 
this. 
Again, I think if we want to go ahead 
and make a fundamental change, com-
mittee consideration can only assist 
that change by getting broad view-
points of those who are in favor of it, 
those who may be opposed to, and 
those who may seek changes. 
And if the committee reports to the 
floor, there will be opportunity on the 
floor, once again, to engage in debate 
and comment. 
I think we will try our best to come 
to a solution that is the best solution. 
I say that with a commitment to try 
my best to do so. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, one of the concerns I have is that 
we have been studying this issue and 
debating this issue for years. 
We have had several floor debates. 
We had two floor debates because we 
only got to vote on it twice. Both 
times, we had the majority of the Sen-
ate promoting this provision. 
What we have is a record of our allies 
already making this change, not for 
the issue of sexual assault in the mili-
tary but for the issue of defendants’ 
rights. The UK, Israel, Germany, Neth-
erlands, Australia all took serious 
crimes, a bright-line of felonies out of 
the chain of command because they be-
lieved that a defendant had a right to 
basic civil liberties. When they did so, 
they did not see a diminution in com-
mand control or the ability to have 
good order and discipline within the 
ranks. And they wrote to one of the 
many panels that we have had over the 
past 10 years—that information—to 
tell them that this is a change we have 
made. And the UK even said this was a 
change that our commanders basically 
didn’t notice. 
So this is not some untested, out-of- 
the-box idea. This is an idea that is 
supported by the survivors, by vet-
erans, by commanders, by experts in 
military justice, and by our allies. I be-
lieve that our servicemembers deserve 
a criminal justice system worthy of the 
sacrifices they make. 
Last, I do not think this is a moment 
to defer to the committee. The com-
mittee has failed survivors over the 
last 10 years, and I do not think it is in 
their purview to make this ultimate 
decision. When we had a vote on the 
‘‘don’t ask, don’t tell’’ repeal—some-
thing that was similarly a generational 
change—it was done on a floor vote, an 
up-or-down vote, and we had that vote 
twice. It was called twice because the 
first time Republicans refused to par-
ticipate in the vote. We called it again, 
and we had the 60 votes we needed to 
overcome a filibuster. 
I believe this vote is also a once-in-a- 
generation vote that needs the review 
and the vote of the entire Senate be-
cause, not only does the Congress have 
the responsibility to oversee the mili-
tary and the entire executive branch, 
but this whole body has the ability to 
oversee individual committees if they 
aren’t going far enough when the mo-
ment demands it. 
I believe this is some such time. We 
are here for a time such as this. We 
should do our job. We should vote on 
this measure, and it should be an up- 
or-down floor vote. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. REED. Just a point of clarifica-
tion, my recollection of the ‘‘don’t ask, 
don’t tell’’ process was that it was, in 
fact, considered by the committee. The 
language that was ultimately adopted 
was the committee language; that be-
cause of objections to the issue, the 
NDAA was filibustered consistently 
and in order to try to break free, in 
terms of passing both pieces of legisla-
tion, the ‘‘don’t ask, don’t tell’’ was re-
moved separately. That was after a 
complete committee process, as well as 
consideration of the NDAA on the 
floor. 
At that point, as Senator GILLIBRAND 
indicated, after two attempts, there 
were sufficient votes to pass ‘‘don’t 
ask, don’t tell,’’ but it was duly consid-
ered in the committee. 
Again, if the power of the ideas, the 
compelling data that they have is such, 
I don’t know why they are concerned 
about allowing the full members of the 
committee, not just a subcommittee, 
to decide what should be in the final 
mark. 
In addition to that, I think in this 
process—and, in fact, I think you find 
it on every committee—ideas, perspec-
tives, insights are gained that would 
otherwise be lost. What we are trying 
to do is follow the procedure of the 
Senate, which is to present to this 
floor a bill that has been carefully ex-
amined by people who have dedicated a 
great deal of their Senate service to 
the Armed Services Committee, and do 
so with the input of the Secretary of 
Defense because all of this has to be 
implemented by the Department of De-
fense. And at that point, if there are 
still difficulties and issues, then, the 
Senate floor is available for amend-
ments. 
Again, I would suggest that we can 
make real progress in the committee. 
We can get legislation that is not only 
bipartisan but, hopefully, unanimous 
or nearly unanimous, and that would 
be a very powerful signal to our col-
leagues both in the House and to every-
one else that this legislation will, in 
fact, become law. 
I yield the floor. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I would simply state that we have 
already established that this is some-
thing that should become law. We al-
ready have 63 Senators on a bipartisan 
basis supporting this reform. 
This is not something that is new to 
the committee. We have been debating 
this issue for 8 years. I have asked for 
a vote every one of those 8 years and 
have only been given one twice. We had 
the majority of the Senate on both of 
those votes. So this bill has been fili-
bustered for 8 years. This bill has been 
refused to be allowed to be part of the 
NDAA for a long time. This is not a 
new issue. These are not new facts. 
These are things that we have been 
wrestling with and failing. So I believe 
it is time this measure comes to the 
floor. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF KRISTEN M. CLARKE 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, in just hours, we will be voting 
on the nomination of Kristen Clarke to 
be Assistant Attorney General for the 
Civil Rights Division in the United 
States Department of Justice. 
I am proud tonight to advocate for 
her, not that she needs my voice in her 
support. She is a brilliant leader and 
advocate. She has dedicated her entire 
career to protecting the civil rights of 
all Americans, and she has an extraor-
dinary record to show for it. 
She reminds me of the legal warriors 
in the Department of Justice during 
the 1950s and 1960s and 1970s who bat-
tled for the rule of law in supporting 
children who were trying to gain entry 
to desegregated schools, in voters who 
sought to uphold the franchise, and in 
men and women who challenged the de-
nial of their rights in the South and 
throughout the country. The Depart-
ment of Justice became a beacon of law 
enforcement in its upholding of the 
civil rights of America, and she is in 
that great tradition—fierce and fear-
less, strong and unyielding and tena-
cious in defending and advocating for 
the rights and liberties of Americans 
when they are denied those rights and 
liberties guaranteed under the Con-
stitution and our statutes. 
She served as the civil rights chief 
for the New York Attorney General in 
the civil rights bureau. She served as 
assistant counsel for the NAACP Legal 
Defense 
and 
Education 
Fund. 
She 
served as a Federal prosecutor during 
the Bush administration in the Civil 
Rights Division’s Criminal Section and 
Voting Section, the very divisions that 
she has been nominated now to lead. 
She knows these issues. She knows 
civil rights and civil liberty issues and 
law because she has worked on them 
for more than two decades. She cares 
about these issues because her life has

been dedicated to them, and she under-
stands these issues on a deeply per-
sonal level. She knows them inside and 
out because she served to fight for 
them inside and out of the DOJ, inside 
and out of the New York Attorney Gen-
eral’s Office, inside and out of the orga-
nization whose mission is to protect 
them, and she is the daughter of immi-
grants who grew up in the Nation’s 
largest public housing complex. She is 
also the mother of a 16-year-old son, 
who is growing up in this moment of 
reckoning for racial justice, equality, 
and equity in America. 
If memory serves me, she also once 
took a field trip to the Hartford area, 
in Connecticut, and watched a then 
comparatively young State attorney 
general who was arguing in court in a 
desegregation case. Now, I have no illu-
sions that this experience played any 
part in her desire to use her extraor-
dinary skills and talents and gifts and 
education as a public servant and law-
yer for the public good, but that has 
been her career, and that is exactly 
what we need now at the helm of the 
Civil Rights Division. 
There is no excuse for waiting an-
other moment to confirm her to this 
most important post. She is the civil 
rights chief for this moment because 
we are in a moment of reckoning. Jus-
tice, equity, and equality are on the 
line now, and her strength and tenacity 
meet this moment. 
Unfortunately, there are some on the 
other side who have used Ms. Clarke’s 
nomination to make baseless allega-
tions against her, including allegations 
that she supports abolishing the police. 
To support this distortion, they have 
repeatedly invoked a 2020 op-ed written 
by Ms. Clarke and published by News-
week. I want to meet that article head 
on because, at our Judiciary Commit-
tee’s markup just 2 weeks ago, Senator 
CRUZ selectively excerpted portions of 
that op-ed, claiming that they dem-
onstrated that Ms. Clarke ‘‘explicitly’’ 
advocated abolishing the police. 
There is only one problem with this 
argument: Ms. Clarke never wrote 
that. It just isn’t true. Ms. Clarke’s 
piece is a thoughtful call to rethink 
how we approach law enforcement in a 
country that is going through a mo-
ment in which thousands of Americans 
have called out for real reform, real 
change, real action. 
I have been proud to be involved in 
peaceful demonstrations and rallies 
throughout the State of Connecticut— 
probably 20 or maybe more of them 
over the last summer—when young 
people led these public calls for justice 
in policing, justice in housing, justice 
in 
the 
workplace, 
and 
justice 
in 
healthcare—all of them implicated in 
this moment. 
The fact is the word ‘‘abolition’’ ap-
pears only once in the entire op-ed. 
That word appears once in the op-ed— 
‘‘abolition’’—when it is used to de-
scribe the huge range of views held by 
others, activists and local govern-
ments. That is it. That word ‘‘aboli-
tion’’ is used to describe the views of 
others, not her views. 
Senator CRUZ has also distorted her 
record in another way in claiming she 
had written a provocative email com-
paring the police to the Ku Klux Klan. 
That is simply not true. In reality, the 
passage Senator CRUZ quoted was writ-
ten by someone else—an activist—in an 
essay that Ms. Clarke had simply for-
warded in an email. In the email, the 
subject line includes the actual au-
thor’s name, and the essay is signed at 
the end by the author. 
Had Senator CRUZ bothered to look 
at the entirety of the email and of that 
document instead of cherry-picking a 
line to fit his preconceived narrative, 
he would have known, and it would 
have been truer to the facts here. Ms. 
Clarke no more wrote the words Sen-
ator CRUZ attributed to her than he 
did. 
At a time when the country faces a 
moment of reckoning over racial jus-
tice, the Civil Rights Division needs 
someone with Ms. Clarke’s knowledge, 
skill, dexterity of thinking, life experi-
ence, heart, and dedication because 
these challenges are immense and they 
need to be addressed. She is the person 
for this moment. That is exactly what 
she will do, address the need for equity 
and equality in civil rights enforce-
ment. 
She 
will 
be 
tenacious 
but 
thoughtful and insightful and true to 
the law, serving the rule of law. She is 
a dedicated and devoted public servant, 
committed 
to 
equal 
justice, 
civil 
rights, and the rule of law. 
I have seen that firsthand, and I 
know I am not the only one who thinks 
so. The letters the Judiciary Com-
mittee has received in support of her 
nomination reflect a broad, profes-
sionally and ideologically diverse coa-
lition of individuals and organizations 
that know that she is, without a doubt, 
eminently qualified for this position. 
That support includes law enforce-
ment, like the Major Cities Chiefs As-
sociation, the National Organization of 
Black Law Enforcement Executives, 
the National Association of Women 
Law Enforcement Executives, the His-
panic American Police Command Offi-
cers Association, and 71 former attor-
neys general from red States and blue 
States. 
The National Organization of Black 
Law Enforcement Executives wrote: 
Ms. Clarke has displayed the qualities of 
leadership, empathy, excellence, and persist-
ence in supporting and defending the U.S. 
Constitution while ensuring equal protection 
and justice for all Americans. 
The 71 former attorneys general 
wrote: 
Kristen Clarke is someone with immense 
credibility among community leaders in 
each of our states—she has handled cases of 
hate crimes, constitutional policing, human 
trafficking, and voting rights, and, most re-
cently, has done effective work on violent 
extremism and the threat that it poses to 
our citizens. 
I 
believe 
strongly 
that 
Kristen 
Clarke should be confirmed right away, 
without delay, and I encourage all of 
my colleagues to see the baseless alle-
gations against her for what they are— 
a distortion—and I urge them to sup-
port her nomination. I have confronted 
those allegations. They are unworthy 
of repetition, but I think my colleagues 
should know the truth behind them. 
The Civil Rights Division and the 
American people need Kristen Clarke. 
For me, this vote feels very personal. 
Two of my four children are graduating 
literally today and during this week 
from law school. I hope they will use 
the great gifts that they have, the 
skills that they have acquired, and the 
advocacy that they have been learning 
to advance the public interests in the 
way that Kristen Clarke has done 
throughout her extraordinary career. I 
hope they will regard her as a role 
model because she has sought justice. 
She has fought to uphold the rights 
of people who are vulnerable, Ameri-
cans who are voiceless, and ordinary 
Americans, who all too often have been 
denied their rights. She has stood up 
for them; she has spoken out; and I 
hope we will confirm her tomorrow 
with a bipartisan vote.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DR. PETER B.

∑ Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, it is 
my honor to recognize the life of Dr. 
Peter B. Lyons, a steadfast and selfless 
public servant, who over the course of 
an unparalleled and distinguished ca-
reer at Los Alamos National Labora-
tory, the U.S. Senate, the Nuclear Reg-
ulatory Commission, and the U.S. De-
partment of Energy, made numerous 
contributions to the field of nuclear 
physics, to the State of New Mexico, 
and to our country’s nuclear energy 
community.

simulation into all programs through 
the Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling 
and Simulation Program, advancing 
the management of used nuclear fuel 
through the development of the Strat-
egy for the Management and Disposal 
of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level 
Radioactive Waste, and leading the Nu-
clear Energy Group that established 
the Small Modular Reactor Licensing 
Technical Support Program for a new 
generation of safe, reliable, low-carbon 
nuclear energy technology. Under his 
leadership, the Nuclear Energy Univer-
sity Program also expanded its success-
ful work supporting universities in the 
United States as they prepared the 
next generation of nuclear engineering 
leaders. 
Prior to his leadership at the Depart-
ment of Energy, Dr. Lyons served for 
41⁄2 years on the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission and for 8 years as an in-
valuable member of U.S. Senator Pete 
V. Domenici’s staff, when Senator 
Domenici was the chairman of both the 
Senate Energy Committee and Appro-
priations Energy and Water Develop-
ment Subcommittee. He and Senator 
Domenici focused on broadening the 
use of nuclear energy in its safest con-
figuration as a critical way to reduce 
dependence on other forms of energy 
that contributed to climate change. 
For nearly 30 years, Dr. Lyons 
worked as a nuclear physicist at Los 
Alamos 
National 
Laboratory. 
He 
served as Director for Industrial Part-
nerships, Deputy Associate Director for 
Energy and Environment, and Deputy 
Associate Director for Defense Re-
search and Applications. At Los Ala-
mos, he also spent a decade supporting 
nuclear test diagnostics and served as 
the Chairman of the NATO Nuclear Ef-
fects Task Force. He published more 
than 100 technical papers and held 
three patents related to fiber optics 
and plasma diagnostics. He was also 
elected to the Los Alamos School 
Board for 16 years, a true reflection of 
his broad dedication to public service. 
Dr. Lyons received his undergraduate 
degree in physics and mathematics 
from the University of Arizona and his 
doctorate in nuclear astrophysics from 
the California Institute of Technology. 
He was a fellow of the American Nu-
clear Society, ANS, a fellow of the 
American Physical Society, and recipi-
ent of the Eisenhower Award for distin-
guished service from the ANS. 
Behind all of these extraordinary 
achievements and vital contributions 
to our country lay a humble, kind, and 
profoundly decent person. All who 
knew Dr. Lyons, or ‘‘Pete,’’ as he in-
sisted his friends and associates call 
him, will never forget his kindness, his 
thoughtfulness, and his willingness to 
help everyone who approached him. 
Even as he fought the cancer that 
eventually took his life, he retained his 
optimistic nature and his great sense 
of humor. 
My thoughts are with all of Pete’s 
family, friends, and colleagues as they 
mourn his loss and reflect on all that 
he accomplished in his life.∑ 
REMEMBERING DR. ARMIN REMBE 
∑ Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, it 
is a deep honor to recognize the life of 
an extraordinary New Mexican, Dr. 
Armin Rembe of Los Ranchos. The first 
oncologist-hematologist 
in 
Albu-
querque, Dr. Rembe served countless 
numbers of patients in New Mexico de-
livering lifesaving care over a long and 
successful medical career. 
Originally from Seattle, WA, Dr. 
Rembe developed a lifelong love for his 
adopted home State of New Mexico. He 
studied everything he could about New 
Mexico’s rich history and culture. He 
also became a preeminent collector of 
Spanish colonial art and served for 
years as a judge at the annual Spanish 
Market in Santa Fe. 
With his wife of 58 years, Penny, Dr. 
Rembe developed his second career 
after retiring from medicine as an or-
ganic farmer and steward of Los 
Poblanos Historic Inn and Organic 
Farm in Los Ranchos. The historic 
property was designed by the renowned 
architect John Gaw Meem and sits 
amid 25 acres of lavender fields, cotton-
wood trees, and formal gardens in the 
Rio Grande Valley. 
For 45 years, Dr. Rembe and Penny 
worked tirelessly to grow the success-
ful 
and 
dynamic 
mission 
of 
Los 
Poblanos as a gem of historical preser-
vation, a venue with world-class hospi-
tality, and a working organic farm 
that keeps the tradition of agriculture 
in the Rio Grande alive while mini-
mizing the use of precious water re-
sources. 
Above all else, Dr. Rembe was proud 
of his family. My thoughts are with his 
beloved wife, Penny, their four chil-
dren, Emily, Armin, Jay and Matthew, 
and their eight grandchildren, as they 
grieve this loss and remember a life 
well-lived.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 229—RECOG-
NIZING THE DEVASTATING AT-
TACK ON A GIRLS’ SCHOOL IN 
KABUL, AFGHANISTAN ON MAY 
8, 2021, AND EXPRESSING SOLI-
DARITY WITH THE AFGHAN PEO-
PLE 
Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself and Ms. 
COLLINS) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 229 
Whereas on May 8, 2021, a car bomb and 
several other mechanisms were detonated at 
the front gates of the Sayed Ul-Shuhada 
High School in Kabul, killing more than 85 
people, many of whom were girls attending 
the school; 
Whereas, the attack took place as the girls 
and their families prepared to celebrate Eid 
al-Fitr; 
Whereas the school provides education to 
the Dasht-e Barchi neighborhood, an under-
served area of Kabul where many members of 
the Hazara minority community live; 
Whereas the Hazara in Dasht-e Barchi have 
been the target of extremist violence for 
many years; 
Whereas on March 12, 2020, assailants at-
tacked a maternity hospital in Dasht-e 
Barchi, killing 24 people including 2 newborn 
babies, mothers, and members of the hospital 
staff; 
Whereas, 1 of those killed in the attack on 
the hospital was Maryam Noorzad— 
(1) who was a midwife serving the Hazara 
community; 
(2) who dedicated her life to providing ac-
cess to healthcare to women in remote parts 
of Afghanistan; 
(3) who was murdered after refusing to 
leave the bedside of a patient in labor; and 
(4) whose bravery was recognized by the 
Department of State with an honorary Inter-
national Women of Courage award; 
Whereas, Afghan girls were restricted from 
accessing an education under the Taliban, 
forcing some girls to dress up as boys in 
order to attend secret schools and continue 
their education; 
Whereas, according to a report by the Of-
fice of the Director of National Intel-
ligence— 
(1) there are approximately 3,500,000 girls 
among the 9,000,000 children who are enrolled 
in school in Afghanistan; 
(2) only 17 percent of girls in rural parts of 
Afghanistan attend school, while 45 percent 
of girls in urban areas in Afghanistan attend 
school; 
(3) 80 percent of Afghan women older than 
15 years of age are illiterate; and 
(4) schools are increasingly being forced to 
close due to rising insecurity; 
Whereas, the education of girls is a nec-
essary requirement for any country to 
achieve long-term stability and peace; 
Whereas the attack coincides with an esca-
lation of violence in Afghanistan, per-
petrated by the Taliban, the Islamic State of 
Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) and other ter-
rorist organizations; 
Whereas the recent escalation in violence 
has disproportionately impacted women, who 
have been targeted while working as report-
ers, 
administering 
vaccines, 
serving 
in 
prominent positions, and helping their com-
munities: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) extends its heartfelt condolences to, 
and stands with, the people of Afghanistan 
and the Hazara community; 
(2) condemns all forms of violence against 
women and girls in Afghanistan; 
(3) supports United States and inter-
national efforts to ensure that girls in Af-
ghanistan are able to safely attend school; 
(4) affirms that the United States should 
continue to provide assistance to support the 
rights of women and girls to achieve an edu-
cation; 
(5) calls on the Government of Afghanistan 
to support girls’ education and to ensure 
that girls are able to safely attend school; 
(6) calls for international condemnation of 
violence against Afghan women and girls, 
and 
(7) asks the international community to 
devote the resources and attention necessary 
to provide for the continued safe education 
of girls in Afghanistan.

Mr. TOOMEY, Mr. BOOZMAN, Mr. BOOK-
ER, Mr. RUBIO, Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mr. 
CARPER, Mr. HAGERTY, and Mr. MCCON-
NELL) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 230 
Whereas charter schools are public schools 
that do not charge tuition and enroll any 
student who wants to attend, often through 
a random lottery when the demand for en-
rollment is outmatched by the supply of 
available charter school seats; 
Whereas high-performing public charter 
schools deliver a high-quality public edu-
cation and challenge all students to reach 
their potential for academic success; 
Whereas public charter schools promote in-
novation and excellence in public education; 
Whereas public charter schools throughout 
the United States provide millions of fami-
lies with diverse and innovative educational 
options for the children of those families; 
Whereas high-performing public charter 
schools and charter management organiza-
tions are increasing student achievement 
and attendance rates at institutions of high-
er education; 
Whereas public charter schools are author-
ized by a designated entity and— 
(1) respond to the needs of communities, 
families, and students in the United States; 
and 
(2) promote the principles of quality, ac-
countability, choice, high-performance, and 
innovation; 
Whereas, in exchange for flexibility and 
autonomy, public charter schools are held 
accountable by the authorizers of the char-
ter schools for improving student achieve-
ment and for sound financial and operational 
management; 
Whereas public charter schools are re-
quired to meet the student achievement ac-
countability requirements under the Ele-
mentary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) in the same man-
ner as traditional public schools; 
Whereas public charter schools often set 
higher expectations for students, beyond the 
requirements of the Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 
et seq.), to ensure that the charter schools 
are of high quality and truly accountable to 
the public; 
Whereas 44 States, the District of Colum-
bia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have public 
charter schools; 
Whereas, as of the 2018–2019 school year, 
more than 7,500 public charter schools served 
approximately 3,300,000 children; 
Whereas enrollment in public charter 
schools grew from 400,000 students in 2001 to 
3,300,000 students in 2019, a more than eight-
fold increase in 18 years; 
Whereas in the United States—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3338 
May 24, 2021 
(1) in 241 school districts, more than 10 per-
cent of public school students are enrolled in 
public charter schools; and 
(2) in at least 29 school districts, at least 30 
percent of public school students are en-
rolled in public charter schools; 
Whereas public charter schools improve 
the achievement of students enrolled in the 
charter schools and collaborate with tradi-
tional public schools to improve public edu-
cation for all students; 
Whereas public charter schools— 
(1) give parents the freedom to choose pub-
lic schools; 
(2) routinely measure parental satisfaction 
levels; and 
(3) must prove the ongoing success of the 
charter schools to parents, policymakers, 
and the communities served by the charter 
schools or risk closure; 
Whereas a 2015 report from the Center for 
Research on Education Outcomes at Stan-
ford University found significant improve-
ments for students at urban charter schools, 
and, when compared to peers in traditional 
public schools, each year those students 
completed the equivalent of 28 more days of 
learning in reading and 40 more days of 
learning in math; 
Whereas a 2020 study from the Program on 
Education Policy and Governance at Harvard 
University found greater academic gains for 
students in charter schools than for students 
in traditional public schools who took the 
reading and math assessments administered 
by the National Assessment of Educational 
Progress (NAEP) in fourth and eighth grade 
between 2005 and 2017, and African American 
and low-income students attending charter 
schools were almost 6 months ahead of their 
peers in reading and math compared with 
students in traditional public schools over 
the 12-year span of the study; 
Whereas 
parental 
demand 
for 
charter 
schools is high, and there was nearly 5 per-
cent growth in charter school enrollment be-
tween the 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 school 
years; and 
Whereas the 22nd annual National Charter 
Schools Week is scheduled to be celebrated 
the week of May 9 through May 15, 2021: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the students, families,

PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF MAY 17, 2021, 
AS 
‘‘DIPG 
PEDIATRIC 
BRAIN

Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. REED, 
Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH, 
Mr. 
CASEY, 
Mr. 
BRAUN, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. MARSHALL, 
and Mrs. FISCHER) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 231 
Whereas diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘DIPG’’) tu-
mors regularly affect 130 to 300 children in 
the United States each year; 
Whereas brain tumors are the leading 
cause of cancer-related death among chil-
dren; 
Whereas DIPG tumors are the leading 
cause of pediatric brain cancer deaths; 
Whereas, with respect to a child who is di-
agnosed with a DIPG tumor and receives 
treatment for a DIPG tumor, the median 
amount of time that the child survives after 
diagnosis is only 9 months; 
Whereas, with respect to an individual who 
is diagnosed with a DIPG tumor, the rate of 
survival 5 years after diagnosis is approxi-
mately 2 percent; 
Whereas the average age at which a child 
is diagnosed with a DIPG tumor is between 5 
and 10 years, resulting in a life expectancy 
approximately 70 years shorter than the av-
erage life expectancy in the United States; 
and 
Whereas the prognosis for children diag-
nosed with DIPG tumors has not improved 
over the past 50 years: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports— 
(A) designating May 17, 2021, as ‘‘DIPG Pe-
diatric Brain Cancer Awareness Day’’; and 
(B) efforts to— 
(i) 
better 
understand 
diffuse 
intrinsic 
pontine glioma tumors; 
(ii) develop effective treatments for diffuse 
intrinsic pontine glioma tumors; and 
(iii) provide comprehensive care for chil-
dren with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma 
tumors and their families; and 
(2) encourages all individuals in the United 
States to become more informed about— 
(A) diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma tu-
mors; 
(B) pediatric brain cancer in general; and 
(C) challenges relating to research on pedi-
atric cancers and ways to advance such re-
search.

At the end of subtitle A of title II of divi-
sion C, add the following: 
SEC. 3219L. TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION AC-
COUNTABILITY AND PREVENTION. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Transnational Repression Ac-
countability and Prevention Act of 2021’’ or 
as the ‘‘TRAP Act of 2021’’. 
(b) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The International Criminal Police Or-
ganization (INTERPOL) works to prevent 
and fight crime through enhanced coopera-
tion and innovation on police and security 
matters, including kleptocracy, counterter-
rorism, cybercrime, counternarcotics, and 
transnational organized crime. 
(2) United States membership and partici-
pation in INTERPOL advances the national 
security and law enforcement interests of 
the United States related to combating 
kleptocracy, 
terrorism, 
cybercrime, 
nar-
cotics, and transnational organized crime. 
(3) Article 2 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
states that the organization aims ‘‘[to] en-
sure and promote the widest possible mutual 
assistance between all criminal police au-
thorities . . . in the spirit of the ‘Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights’ ’’. 
(4) Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
states that ‘‘[i]t is strictly forbidden for the 
Organization to undertake any intervention 
or activities of a political, military, reli-
gious or racial character’’. 
(5) These principles provide INTERPOL 
with a foundation based on respect for 
human rights and avoidance of politically 
motivated actions by the organization and 
its members. 
(6) According to the Justice Manual of the 
United States Department of Justice, ‘‘[i]n 
the United States, national law prohibits the 
arrest of the subject of a Red Notice issued 
by another INTERPOL member country, 
based upon the notice alone’’. 
(c) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that some INTERPOL member 
countries 
have 
repeatedly 
misused 
INTERPOL’s databases and processes, in-
cluding Notice and Diffusion mechanisms, 
for activities of an overtly political or other 
unlawful character and in violation of inter-
national human rights standards, including 
making requests to harass or persecute polit-
ical opponents, human rights defenders, or 
journalists. 
(d) SUPPORT FOR INTERPOL INSTITUTIONAL 
REFORMS.—The Attorney General and the 
Secretary of State shall— 
(1) use the voice, vote, and influence of the 
United 
States, 
as 
appropriate, 
within 
INTERPOL’s General Assembly and Execu-
tive Committee to promote reforms aimed at 
improving the transparency of INTERPOL 
and ensuring its operation consistent with 
its Constitution, particularly articles 2 and 
3, and Rules on the Processing of Data, in-
cluding— 
(A) supporting INTERPOL’s reforms en-
hancing the screening process for Notices, 
Diffusions, and other INTERPOL commu-
nications 
to 
ensure 
they 
comply 
with 
INTERPOL’s Constitution and Rules on the 
Processing of Data (RPD); 
(B) 
supporting 
and 
strengthening 
INTERPOL’s coordination with the Commis-
sion for Control of INTERPOL’s Files (CCF) 
in cases in which INTERPOL or the CCF has 
determined that a member country issued a 
Notice, Diffusion, or other INTERPOL com-
munication against an individual in viola-
tion of articles 2 or 3 of the INTERPOL Con-
stitution, or the RPD, to prohibit such mem-
ber country from seeking the publication or 
issuance of any subsequent Notices, Diffu-
sions, or other INTERPOL communication 
against the same individual based on the 
same set of claims or facts; 
(C) increasing, to the extent practicable, 
dedicated funding to the CCF and the No-
tices and Diffusions Task Force in order to 
further expand operations related to the re-
view of requests for red notices and red diffu-
sions; 
(D) supporting candidates for positions 
within INTERPOL’s structures, including 
the Presidency, Executive Committee, Gen-
eral Secretariat, and CCF who have dem-
onstrated experience relating to and respect 
for the rule of law; 
(E) seeking to require INTERPOL in its an-
nual report to provide a detailed account, 
disaggregated by member country or entity 
of— 
(i) 
the 
number 
of 
Notice 
requests, 
disaggregated by color, that it received; 
(ii) 
the 
number 
of 
Notice 
requests, 
disaggregated by color, that it rejected; 
(iii) the category of violation identified in 
each instance of a rejected Notice; 
(iv) the number of Diffusions that it can-
celled without reference to decisions by the 
CCF; and 
(v) the sources of all INTERPOL income 
during the reporting period; and 
(F) supporting greater transparency by the 
CCF in its annual report by providing a de-
tailed account, disaggregated by country, 
of— 
(i) the number of admissible requests for 
correction or deletion of data received by the 
CCF regarding issued Notices, Diffusions, 
and other INTERPOL communications; and 
(ii) the category of violation alleged in 
each such complaint; 
(2) inform the INTERPOL General Secre-
tariat about incidents in which member 
countries abuse INTERPOL communications 
for politically motivated or other unlawful 
purposes so that, as appropriate, action can 
be taken by INTERPOL; and 
(3) request to censure member countries 
that 
repeatedly 
abuse 
and 
misuse 
INTERPOL’s red notice and red diffusion 
mechanisms, including restricting the access 
of those countries to INTERPOL’s data and 
information systems. 
(e) REPORT ON INTERPOL.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days

member countries abuse INTERPOL Red No-

years.

paragraph (1) shall include the following ele-
ments: 
(A) A list of countries that the Attorney 
General and the Secretary determine have 
repeatedly abused and misused the red notice 
and red diffusion mechanisms for political 
purposes. 
(B) A description of the most common tac-
tics employed by member countries in con-
ducting such abuse, including the crimes 
most commonly alleged and the INTERPOL 
communications most commonly exploited. 
(C) An assessment of the adequacy of 
INTERPOL mechanisms for challenging abu-
sive requests, including the Commission for 
the Control of INTERPOL’s Files (CCF), an 
assessment of the CCF’s March 2017 Oper-
ating Rules, and any shortcoming the United 
States believes should be addressed. 
(D) A description of how INTERPOL’s Gen-
eral Secretariat identifies requests for red 
notice or red diffusions that are politically 
motivated or are otherwise in violation of 
INTERPOL’s rules and how INTERPOL re-
views and addresses cases in which a member 
country has abused or misused the red notice 
and red diffusion mechanisms for overtly po-
litical purposes.

MISAPPROPRIA-
TION.—If an owner of a trade secret, who is a 
United States person, wishes to have the At-
torney General or the head of the applicable 
designated Federal agency apply a penalty 
under subsection (c) to a foreign person who 
has misappropriated the trade secret, the 
owner shall submit to the Attorney General 
a petition demonstrating that—

straining order, preliminary injunction, or 
final judgment under section 1836 of this 
title against the foreign person for misappro-
priating a trade secret of the owner;

relief to the owner because the foreign per-
son has used or is reasonably likely to use

country, such that activities of the foreign 
person relevant to the determinations under 
subparagraph (A) take place outside the

field described in section 221(j)(1) of the Im-
migration and Nationality Act (as added by 
subsection (b)). 
TITLE V—GOVERNMENT-FUNDED 
RESEARCH PROJECTS 
SEC. 7501. FINDINGS. 
Congress find the following: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China (referred 
to in this subsection as ‘‘the PRC’’ or 
‘‘China’’) poses an existential threat to the 
economic interests and national security of 
the United States, in part due to the contin-
ued efforts of the PRC to steal sensitive 
technology 
and 
proprietary 
information 
from companies, academic institutions, and 
other organizations of the United States 
through economic espionage and other forms 
of nontraditional espionage. 
(2) The PRC, through the Chinese Com-
munist Party (referred to in this subsection 
as the ‘‘CCP’’), has long had an interest in 
replacing the United States as the world’s 
foremost superpower. China takes a holistic 
approach towards achieving its long-term 
goals, which are rooted in the concept of a 
comprehensive national power, including 
achieving dominance in economics, military 
affairs, science and technology, education, 
and global influence. 
(3) Nontraditional forms of espionage serve 
as primary tools to further the goals of the 
CCP. Those tools include talent recruitment 
programs designed to recruit Chinese nation-
als to acquire knowledge about—and, often, 
steal—valuable and sensitive research at uni-
versities and research institutions abroad, 
and to lure foreign experts to China to work 
on key strategic programs. More broadly, 
the PRC uses mergers and acquisitions or 
joint ventures as a means to gain access to 
high-level technology, uses cyber intrusions 
to steal information, and uses front compa-
nies for PRC-related entities to acquire ex-
port-controlled technology. 
(4) In 2015, President Xi Jinping of the PRC 
released the ‘‘Made in China 2025’’ initiative, 
a 10-year plan to update the manufacturing 
base of China by developing the following 10 
high-tech industries: 
(A) Electric cars and other new energy ve-
hicles. 
(B) 
Next-generation 
information 
tech-
nology and telecommunications. 
(C) Advanced robotics and artificial intel-
ligence. 
(D) Aerospace equipment. 
(E) Bio-medicine and high-end medical 
equipment. 
(F) Ocean engineering equipment and high- 
end vessels. 
(G) High-end rail transportation equip-
ment. 
(H) Electrical equipment. 
(I) Farming machines. 
(J) New materials, such as polymers. 
(5) In attempting to overtake the United 
States and achieve its Made in China 2025 
goals, China has systematically sought to 
identify areas of American innovation, edu-
cation, and technology that could be rep-
licated, stolen, or appropriated. 
(6) The very nature of the open society of 
the United States—a free market economy 
that incentivizes creativity and ingenuity 
and promotes the free flow of capital and 
ideas, a higher education system and sci-
entific research community that encourages 
collaboration domestically and internation-
ally, and a liberal democratic government 
that lacks a top-down, authoritarian struc-
ture—creates opportunities for the PRC to 
target the United States in ways that are ei-
ther not adequately protected or not even 
anticipated as possible threats. 
(7) The Director of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation has assessed that ‘‘there’s no 
country that’s even close’’ to the PRC when 
it comes to foreign espionage, in traditional 
or nontraditional forms. 
(8) As the 2018 Foreign Economic Espio-
nage in Cyberspace report of the National 
Counterintelligence 
and 
Security 
Center 
(commonly known as the ‘‘NCSC’’) stated, 
China has expansive efforts in place to ac-
quire United States technology, including 
sensitive trade secrets and proprietary infor-
mation. China continues to use cyber espio-
nage to support its strategic development 
goals—science and technology advancement, 
military modernization, and economic policy 
objectives. Chinese companies and individ-
uals often acquire United States technology 
for commercial and scientific purposes. 
(9) In April 2020, the Office of the United 
States Trade Representative (referred to in 
this subsection as the ‘‘USTR’’) issued its 
annual Special 301 Report, in which the 
USTR reviews the state of intellectual prop-
erty protection and enforcement in trading 
partners of the United States around the 
world. The USTR continues to place China 
on the Priority Watch List, which reflects 
‘‘United States concerns with China’s system 
of pressuring and coercing technology trans-
fer, and the continued need for fundamental 
structural changes to strengthen IP protec-
tion and enforcement, including as to trade 
secret theft, obstacles to protecting trade-
marks, online piracy and counterfeiting, the 
high-volume manufacturing and export of 
counterfeit goods, and impediments to phar-
maceutical innovation.’’. 
(10) The theft of intellectual property, 
trade secrets, sensitive technology, and sci-
entific and other academic research all con-
tribute to China’s goal of achieving pre-
eminent superpower status. China’s failure 
to respect intellectual property rights, fail-
ure to adhere to the rule of law, and efforts 
to obtain intellectual property, trade se-
crets, technology, and research through im-
proper or illicit means all pose a significant 
economic and national security threat to the 
United States. 
(11) In recent years, China has increased its 
use of nontraditional espionage to target col-
leges and universities in the United States, 
particularly with respect to cutting edge re-
search and technologies being developed by 
such universities, including technology that 
has military applications. 
(12) The universities of the United States 
provide fertile ground for nontraditional es-
pionage given the open, international, and 
collaborative nature of most university re-
search and the legitimate interest of univer-
sities in encouraging international collabo-
ration. 
(13) While the United States benefits from 
attracting the top research talent from 
around the world, universities nevertheless 
must take appropriate measures to ensure 
that China is not able to use academic col-
laboration to steal United States intellec-
tual property or engage in other activities 
that might harm the national security of the 
United States. 
(14) In response to the increased wave of 
nontraditional espionage over recent years, 
the Department of Justice launched a China 
Initiative in 2018. The goal of the China Ini-
tiative is to identify and prosecute individ-
uals and entities engaged in economic and 
other nontraditional espionage, trade secret 
theft, hacking, and other crimes, while pro-
tecting critical infrastructure against exter-
nal threats and combating covert efforts to 
influence the American public. 
(15) Several recent criminal and civil en-
forcement actions taken by the Department 
of Justice highlight China’s pervasive and il-
legal targeting of intellectual property and 
valuable research from United States univer-
sities, including the following: 
(A) Dr. Qing Wang was a former employee 
of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. He had 
received more than $3,000,000 in grant fund-
ing from the National Institutes of Health 
(commonly known as ‘‘NIH’’). Dr. Wang was 
charged in a criminal complaint with know-
ingly failing to disclose to NIH that he was 
Dean of the College of Life Sciences and 
Technology at the Huazhong University of 
Science and Technology (referred to in this 
subparagraph as ‘‘HUST’’) and received grant 
funds from the National Natural Science 
Foundation of China for some of the same 
scientific research funded by NIH. Dr. Wang 
also allegedly participated in the Thousand 
Talents Program, for which China provided 
$3,000,000 in research support to enhance the 
facilities and operations at HUST. Federal 
law enforcement agencies arrested Dr. Wang 
in May 2020. 
(B) Dr. James Patrick Lewis was a tenured 
professor at West Virginia University in the 
physics department from 2006 to 2019. In July 
2017, Dr. Lewis entered into a contract of em-
ployment with the PRC through its Global 
Experts Thousand Talents Plan. In March 
2020, Dr. Lewis pled guilty to 1 count of Fed-
eral program fraud. 
(C) Anming Hu, an Associate Professor in 
the Department of Mechanical, Aerospace, 
and Biomedical Engineering at the Univer-
sity of Tennessee, Knoxville (commonly 
known as ‘‘UT’’), allegedly engaged in a 
scheme to defraud the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (commonly known 
as ‘‘NASA’’) by concealing his affiliation 
with Beijing University of Technology (re-
ferred to in this subparagraph as ‘‘BJUT’’). 
Hu’s false representations to UT about his 
affiliation with BJUT caused UT to falsely 
certify to NASA that UT was in compliance 
with Federal law. In February 2020, Mr. Hu 
was indicted on Federal charges of wire fraud 
and false statements. 
(D) Dr. Charles Lieber served as the Prin-
cipal Investigator of the Lieber Research 
Group at Harvard University, which special-
ized in the area of nanoscience. Dr. Lieber 
had received more than $15,000,000 in grant 
funding from NIH and the Department of De-
fense since 2008. Unbeknownst to Harvard 
University, beginning in 2011, Lieber alleg-
edly became a ‘‘Strategic Scientist’’ at 
Wuhan University of Technology in China 
(referred to in this subparagraph as ‘‘WUT’’) 
and was a contractual participant in the 
Thousand Talents Plan from 2012 to 2017. 
Under the terms of the Thousand Talents 
contract, WUT paid Lieber $50,000 per month, 
paid him living expenses of up to approxi-
mately $158,000, and awarded him more than 
$1,500,000 to establish a research lab at WUT. 
In return, Lieber was obligated to work for 
WUT for 9 months per year. Lieber lied about 
his involvement with WUT to both Harvard 
University and Federal investigators. In Jan-
uary 2020, Lieber was arrested and charged 
with making a materially false, fictitious 
and fraudulent statement. 
(E) In January 2020, Yanqing Ye, a Chinese 
national, Lieutenant of the People’s Libera-
tion Army (referred to in this subparagraph 
as the ‘‘PLA’’), and member of the CCP, was 
indicted on visa fraud, false statements, and 
acting as an agent of a foreign power with-
out prior notification. Ye allegedly falsely 
identified as a student and lied about her on-
going military service at the National Uni-
versity of Defense Technology. While study-
ing at Boston University’s Department of 
Physics, Chemistry, and Biomedical Engi-
neering, Ye continued to work as a PLA 
Lieutenant and completed assignments from 
PLA officers, including conducting research, 
assessing United States military websites, 
and sending United States documents and in-
formation to China.

May 24, 2021 
(F) In January 2020, Zaoson Zheng, a Chi-
nese national, was arrested at Logan Airport 
in Boston and charged with attempting to 
smuggle 21 vials of biological research to 
China. Zheng had allegedly entered the 
United States in 2018 on a J–1 visa and con-
ducted cancer cell research at Beth Israel 
Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Zheng 
admitted he stole the vials from a lab at 
Beth Israel, and that he intended to bring 
the vials to China, use them to conduct re-
search in his own laboratory, and publish the 
results under his own name. 
(G) In December 2019, the Van Andel Re-
search Institute (referred to in this subpara-
graph as ‘‘VARI’’) reached a settlement with 
the Department of Justice to pay $5,500,000 
to resolve allegations that it violated the 
law commonly known as the False Claims 
Act (section 3729 through 3733 of title 31, 
United States Code) by failing to disclose, in 
Federal grant applications and progress re-
ports submitted to NIH, that the Chinese 
government 
funded 
2 
VARI 
researchers 
through grants. The VARI researchers were 
receiving research funding from Chinese 
sources while VARI was applying for and re-
ceiving NIH funding on their behalf. 
(H) In September 2019, Yu Zhou and Li 
Chen were charged with crimes related to 
stealing exosome-related trade secrets. Zhou 
and Chen, spouses who worked in separate 
medical research labs at the Nationwide 
Children’s Hospital Research Institute, con-
spired to steal scientific trade secrets re-
lated to exosomes and exosome isolation 
from the Research Institute. The couple al-
legedly founded a company in China without 
the hospital’s knowledge. While employed at 
the Research Institute, they marketed prod-
ucts and services related to exosome isola-
tion through their Chinese company. They 
also founded an American biotechnology 
company advertising products and services 
related to exosomes isolation, including a 
kit developed from a trade secret created at 
a Nationwide Children’s research lab. They 
eventually received more than $876,000 and 
stock related to an asset purchase agreement 
involving the American company. 
(I) In August 2019, Feng Tao, an associate 
professor at Kansas University, was indicted 
on Federal charges for concealing the fact 
that he was a full-time employee for Fuzhou 
University in China while doing research at 
Kansas University funded by the United 
States Government. Tao allegedly defrauded 
the United States Government by unlawfully 
receiving Federal grant money at the same 
time that he was employed and paid by a 
Chinese research university. 
(J) Weiqiang Zhang, a Chinese national and 
United States legal permanent resident, ac-
quired, without authorization, hundreds of 
rice seeds produced by his employer, Ventria 
Bioscience. Ventria is a Kansas biopharma-
ceutical research facility that develops ge-
netically programmed rice to express recom-
binant human proteins, which are then ex-
tracted for use in the therapeutic and med-
ical fields. Ventria spent millions of dollars 
and years of research developing its seeds 
and cost-effective methods to extract the 
proteins. Ventria used locked doors with 
magnetic card readers to restrict access to 
the 
temperature-controlled 
environment 
where the seeds were stored and processed. 
Zhang worked as a rice breeder for Ventria. 
In 2013, personnel from a crop research insti-
tute in China visited Zhang at his home in 
Kansas. Zhang drove the visitors to tour fa-
cilities in several States. United States Cus-
toms and Border Protection officers found 
seeds belonging to Ventria in the luggage of 
Zhang’s visitors as they prepared to leave 
the United States for China. In April 2018, 
Zhang was sentenced to 121 months in a Fed-
eral prison after having been convicted in 
February 2017 of 1 count of conspiracy to 
steal trade secrets, 1 count of conspiracy to 
commit interstate transportation of stolen 
property, and 1 count of interstate transpor-
tation of stolen property. 
(16) It remains a national security priority 
for the United States to protect the research 
and innovation developed in United States 
colleges and universities from misappropria-
tion by any country, including the PRC.

States origin is deceptive if, at the time the 
representation is made, such claim is not 
consistent with section 5 of the Federal 
Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)) and 
any regulations promulgated by the Commis-
sion pursuant to section 320933 of the Violent

as follows: 
Strike section 3217 of division C and insert 
the following: 
SEC. 3217. DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION 
RELATED TO THE ORIGIN OF COVID– 
19. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The Department of State released a fact 
sheet on January 15, 2021, about the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology (WIV) which stated the 
following: 
(A) ‘‘The U.S. government has reason to 
believe that several researchers inside the 
WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the 
first identified case of the outbreak, with 
symptoms consistent with both COVID–19 
and common seasonal illnesses.’’. 
(B) ‘‘WIV researchers conducted experi-
ments involving RaTG13, the bat coronavirus 
identified by the WIV in January 2020 as its 
closest sample to SARS-CoV-2.’’. 
(C) ‘‘Despite the WIV presenting itself as a 
civilian institution, the United States has 
determined that the WIV has collaborated on 
publications and secret projects with China’s 
military.’’. 
(2) Former Director of the Centers for Dis-
ease 
Control 
and 
Prevention, 
Robert 
Redfield, stated in March 2021 that, ‘‘the 
most likely etiology of this pathogen in 
Wuhan was from a laboratory’’ and noted 
that, ‘‘[i]t is not unusual for respiratory 
pathogens that are being worked on in a lab-
oratory to infect the laboratory worker.’’. 
(3) Director-General of the World Health 
Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus 
acknowledged 
in 
March 
2021 
that 
the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) may 
have originated in a laboratory and said this 
hypothesis ‘‘requires further investigation, 
potentially with additional missions involv-
ing specialist experts.’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) identifying the origin of Coronavirus 
Disease 2019 (COVID–19) is critical for pre-
venting a similar pandemic from occurring 
in the future; 
(2) there is reason to believe the COVID–19 
pandemic may have originated at the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology; and 
(3) the Director of National Intelligence 
should declassify and make available to the 
public as much information as possible about 
the origin of COVID–19 so the United States 
and like-minded countries can— 
(A) identify the origin of COVID–19 as ex-
peditiously as possible, and 
(B) use that information to take all appro-
priate measures to prevent a similar pan-
demic from occurring again. 
(c) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Director of National Intelligence shall— 
(1) declassify any and all information re-
lating to potential links between the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology and the origin of the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19), includ-
ing— 
(A) activities performed by the Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology with or on behalf of the 
People’s Liberation Army; 
(B) coronavirus research or other related 
activities performed at the Wuhan Institute 
of Virology prior to the outbreak of COVID– 
19; and 
(C) researchers at the Wuhan Institute of 
Virology who fell ill in autumn 2019, includ-
ing for any such researcher— 
(i) the researcher’s name; 
(ii) the researcher’s symptoms; 
(iii) the date of the onset of the research-
er’s symptoms; 
(iv) the researcher’s role at the Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology; 
(v) whether the researcher was involved 
with or exposed to coronavirus research at 
the Wuhan Institute of Virology; 
(vi) whether the researcher visited a hos-
pital while they were ill; and 
(vii) a description of any other actions 
taken by the researcher that may suggest 
they were experiencing a serious illness at 
the time; and 
(2) submit to Congress an unclassified re-
port that contains— 
(A) all of the information described under 
paragraph (1); and 
(B) only such redactions as the Director 
determines necessary to protect sources and 
methods without altering or obscuring in 
any way the information described under 
paragraph (1).

SEC. ll. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE 10TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE MARCH 11, 2011, 
EARTHQUAKE 
AND 
TSUNAMI 
IN 
JAPAN. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) At 2:46 p.m. on March 11, 2011, an earth-
quake initially reported as measuring 8.9 on 
the Richter scale, the strongest recorded in 
more than 100 years in Japan, occurred near 
the Tohoku region of Northeast Japan, 81 
miles off the coast from Sendai City. 
(2) Intense shaking could be felt from 
Tokyo to Kamaishi, an arc of roughly 360 
miles. 
(3) The earthquake generated a massive 
tsunami that caused widespread damage to a 
swath of the northeast Japanese coastline 
and traveled across the Pacific Ocean, caus-
ing damage to coastal communities as far 
away as the States of Hawaii, Oregon, and 
California. 
(4) Authorities in Japan confirm at least 
15,899 deaths from the earthquake and result-
ing tsunami. 
(5) Within minutes of the earthquake, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration alerted emergency workers in the 
States of Hawaii, California, Oregon, Wash-
ington, and Alaska that a potentially cata-
strophic tsunami was heading toward those 
States and mobilized the Tsunami Warning 
System in the Pacific. 
(6) The earthquake forced the emergency 
shutdown of 4 nuclear power facilities in 
Japan, representing a significant loss of elec-
tric generation capacity for Japan and neces-
sitating rolling blackouts in portions of 
Tokyo. 
(7) The earthquake and the resulting tsu-
nami 
severely 
damaged 
the 
Fukushima 
Daiichi nuclear power station, precipitating 
a loss of power for cooling systems at that 
facility and necessitating emergency meas-
ures to prevent serious radiation leakages. 
(8) International response to the disaster 
was swift, with search and rescue teams ar-
riving from the United States, the United 
Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, France, 
and China, among other countries. 
(9) The USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier 
and its support vessels were deployed to the 
earthquake region to participate in search 
and rescue and relief operations. 
(10) Elements of the III Marine Expedi-
tionary Force (MEF), a United States Agen-
cy for International Development Disaster 
Assistance Response Team (DART), and 
other United States military and civilian 
personnel were deployed to Japan to render 
aid and help coordinate United States relief 
efforts. 
(11) The United States-Japan alliance is 
based upon shared values, democratic ideals, 
free markets, and a mutual respect for 
human rights, individual liberties, and the 
rule of law, and is central to the security and 
prosperity of the entire Indo-Pacific region. 
(12) The Self-Defense Forces of Japan have 
contributed broadly to global security mis-
sions, including relief operations following 
the tsunami in Indonesia in 2005, reconstruc-
tion in Iraq from 2004 to 2006, and relief as-
sistance following the earthquake in Haiti in 
2010. 
(13) Japan is among the most generous 
donor nations, providing billions of dollars of 
foreign assistance, including disaster relief, 
annually to developing countries. 
(14) Since 2011, Japan has committed tre-
mendous resources and effort to decommis-
sion the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power 
station by taking measures on contaminated 
water and extracting fuel. 
(15) Since 2011, Japan has committed tre-
mendous resources and effort to restore the 
environment in Fukushima Prefecture, in 
collaboration with the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, to ensure that citizens can 
live with peace of mind with safe water and 
food. 
(16) Ten years after the earthquake and re-
sulting tsunami, Japan is seeking to host a 
successful Olympics in Tokyo where the best 
athletes from across the world can showcase 
their talents amidst the ongoing global 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that Congress— 
(1) mourns the loss of life resulting from 
the earthquake and tsunami in Japan on 
March 11, 2011; 
(2) expresses its deepest condolences to the 
families of the victims of the tragedy; 
(3) expresses its sympathies to the sur-
vivors who are still suffering in the after-
math of the natural disaster; 
(4) commends the Government of Japan for 
its courageous and professional response to 
the natural disaster; and 
(5) supports the efforts already underway 
by the United States Government, relief 
agencies, and private citizens to assist the 
Government and people of Japan with the re-
vitalization efforts in Fukushima Prefec-
ture.

SEC. llll. CHINA GRAND STRATEGY. 
(a) FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(A) The United States is in a geostrategic 
competition with the People’s Republic of 
China, a great power that is challenging the 
United States in the diplomatic, economic, 
military, technological, and informational 
domains. 
(B) During the geostrategic competition 
with the Soviet Union, the United States ar-
ticulated and refined its strategy to ensure 
ultimate success. 
(C) President Eisenhower utilized experts 
from both within and outside the United 
States Government during Project Solarium 
to produce NSC 162/2, a ‘‘Statement of Policy 
by the National Security Council on Basic 
National Security Policy’’ in order to ‘‘meet 
the Soviet Threat to U.S. security’’ and 
guide United States national security policy. 
(D) President Ford authorized the Team B 
project to draw in experts from outside the 
United States Government to question and 
strengthen the analysis of the Central Intel-
ligence Agency. 
(E) A model for United States strategy on 
a great power competitor is the January 17, 
1983, National Security Decision Directive 
Number 75, approved by President Reagan, to 
organize United States strategy toward the 
Soviet Union in order to clarify and orient 
United States policies towards specific objec-
tives vis a vis the Soviet Union. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the United States should draw

China.

SEC. 5214. MODIFICATION OF DEFINITION OF DO-
MESTIC SOURCE UNDER DEFENSE 
PRODUCTION ACT OF 1950. 
(a) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) rare earth elements are among the ma-
terials the United States domestic industrial 
base requires to produce modern high-tech 
devices; 
(2) the People’s Republic of China possesses

tapped reserves of critical minerals, includ-
ing rare earth elements; and

portant inputs for the United States domes-
tic industrial base.

following: 
SEC. 6302. PREVENTION OF ABUSE OF FLEXIBILI-
TIES IN RULES AND NEGOTIATIONS 
GIVEN BY THE WORLD TRADE ORGA-
NIZATION TO DEVELOPING COUN-
TRIES. 
(a) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) the World Trade Organization (WTO) 
was established to catalyze economic growth 
and raise standards of living by establishing 
international trade rules based on principles 
of 
transparency, 
openness, 
and 
predict-
ability; 
(2) the WTO continues to use a dichotomy 
between developed and developing countries 
that has allowed some WTO members to gain 
unfair advantages in the international trade 
arena; 
(3) China continues to declare itself a de-
veloping country and avail itself of flexibili-
ties under WTO rules; 
(4) China has the second largest gross do-
mestic product in the world; 
(5) China is the largest global exporter of 
goods and accounts for more than 10 percent 
of total global exports of goods; 
(6) the outbound and inbound foreign direct 
investment of China exceeds that of most 
member countries of the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development; 
(7) China, however, continues to declare 
itself a developing country to enjoy the spe-
cial and differential treatment provisions 
that come with that status; and 
(8) when the largest economies claim de-
veloping country status, they potentially 
harm not only other developed countries but 
also developing economies that require spe-
cial and differential treatment. 
(b) PREVENTION
OF
ABUSE
OF
FLEXIBILI-
TIES.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The United States Trade 
Representative shall use all available means 
as the Trade Representative considers appro-
priate to secure changes at the World Trade 
Organization that would prevent self-de-
clared developing countries from availing 
themselves of flexibilities in the rules and 
negotiations at the WTO that are not justi-
fied by appropriate economic and other indi-
cators, as determined by the Trade Rep-
resentative. 
(2) COOPERATION.—The Trade Representa-
tive shall carry out the requirements under 
paragraph (1) in cooperation with other like- 
minded WTO members. 
(3) REPORT.—Not later than 270 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Trade Representative shall submit to Con-
gress a report on the progress of the Trade 
Representative in carrying out paragraph (1). 
(c) TREATMENT
BY
UNITED
STATES.—Not 
later than 270 days after the date of the en-
actment of this Act, if the Trade Representa-
tive determines that substantial progress 
has not been made toward securing the 
changes described in subsection (b)(1), the 
Trade Representative shall, as the Trade 
Representative considers appropriate, no 
longer treat as a developing country for the 
purposes of the WTO any WTO member that, 
in the judgment of the Trade Representative, 
is improperly declaring itself a developing 
country and inappropriately seeking the ben-
efit of flexibilities in the rules and negotia-
tions at the WTO. 
(d) PUBLICATION.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 270 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Trade Representative shall publish on an 
internet website of the Office of the United 
States Trade Representative a list of all self- 
declared developing countries that the Trade 
Representative determines are inappropri-
ately seeking the benefit of developing-coun-
try flexibilities in the rules of and negotia-
tions by the WTO. 
(2) UPDATE.—The Trade Representative 
shall update the list under paragraph (1) not 
less frequently than annually. 
(e) DEFINITIONS.—In this section, the terms 
‘‘World Trade Organization’’, ‘‘WTO’’, and 
‘‘WTO member’’ have the meanings given 
those terms in section 2 of the Uruguay 
Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3501).

TITLE ll—NATIONAL FAB LAB NETWORK 
SEC. lll1. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘National 
Fab Lab Network Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. lll2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Scientific discoveries and technical in-
novations are critical to the economic and 
national security of the United States. 
(2) Maintaining the leadership of the 
United States in science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics will require a di-
verse population with the skills, interest, 
and access to tools required to advance these 
fields. 
(3) Just as earlier digital revolutions in 
communications and computation provided 
individuals with the internet and personal 
computers, a digital revolution in fabrica-
tion will allow anyone to make almost any-
thing, anywhere. 
(4) These creations include elements of a 
typical household basket of goods (fur-
nishings, apparel, food production equip-
ment, shelter, transportation, education and 
communication, recreation, and other goods 
and services), personal technology, means for 
personal expression, the production of digital 
fabrication machinery, community design, 
and manufacturing capability. 
(5) The Center for Bits and Atoms of the 
Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 
Technology 
(CBA) has contributed significantly to the 
advancement of these goals through its work 
in creating and advancing digital fabrication 
facilities, or ‘‘fab labs’’ in the United States 
and abroad. 
(6) Such digital fabrication facilities may 
include 
MakerSpaces, 
Hackerspaces, 
and 
other creative spaces that use digital fab-
rication as a platform for education, innova-
tion, entrepreneurship, personal expression, 
public access, and social impact. 
(7) Such digital fabrication facilities pro-
vide a model for a new kind of national lab-
oratory that operates as a network, linking 
local facilities for advanced manufacturing, 
providing universal access, cultivating new 
literacies, and empowering communities. 
(8) The nonprofit Fab Foundation was es-
tablished to support the growth of the inter-
national network of digital fabrication fa-
cilities, to amplify the educational, entre-
preneurial, and social impacts of digital fab-
rication facilities, and to support the devel-
opment of regional capacity building organi-
zations to broaden impact as well as address 
local, 
regional, 
and 
global 
challenges 
through the use of digital fabrication tech-
nologies. 
(9) A coordinated array of national public- 
private partnerships will be the most effec-
tive way to accelerate the provision of uni-
versal access to this infrastructure for work-
force development, science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics education, devel-
oping inventions, creating businesses, pro-
ducing personalized products, and mitigating 
risks.

SEC. 7002. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) During times of economic downturn or 
recession, communities of color, and busi-
nesses within those communities, are gen-
erally more adversely affected. 
(2) Despite the growth in the number of mi-
nority business enterprises, gaps remain 
with respect to key metrics for those enter-
prises, such as access to capital, revenue, 
number of employees, and survival rate. Spe-
cifically— 
(A) according to the 2021 Small Business 
Credit Survey of the Federal Reserve Banks, 
Black-owned and Latino-owned employer 
businesses are more than 2 and 1.5 times 
more likely to be denied loans, respectively, 
than White-owned employer businesses; 
(B) according to the Bureau of the Census, 
the average non-minority business enterprise 
reports revenue that is more than 3 times 
higher than revenue reported by the average 
minority business enterprise; and 
(C) according to the Kauffman Founda-
tion— 
(i) minority business enterprises are 1⁄2 as 
likely to employ individuals, as compared 
with non-minority business enterprises; and 
(ii) if minorities started and owned busi-
nesses at the same rate as non-minorities, 
the economy of the United States would 
have more than 1,000,000 additional employer 
businesses and more than 9,500,000 additional 
jobs. 
(3) Because of the conditions described in 
paragraph (2), it is in the interest of the 
United States and the economy of the United 
States to expeditiously ameliorate the dis-
parities that minority business enterprises 
experience. 
(4) Many individuals who own minority 
business enterprises are socially disadvan-
taged because those individuals identify as 
members of certain groups that have suffered 
the effects of discriminatory practices or 
similar circumstances over which those indi-
viduals have no control, including individ-
uals who are— 
(A) Black or African American; 
(B) Hispanic or Latino; 
(C) American Indian or Alaska Native; 
(D) Asian; and 
(E) Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Is-
lander. 
(5) Discriminatory practices and similar 
circumstances described in paragraph (4) are 
a significant determinant of overall eco-
nomic disadvantage in the United States. 
(6) It is in the interest of Congress to ad-
dress the persistent racial wealth gap in the 
United States and to support entrepreneur-
ship as a pathway to wealth development. 
(7) While other Federal agencies focus only 
on small businesses and businesses that rep-
resent a broader demographic than solely 
minority business enterprises, the Agency 
focuses exclusively on— 
(A) the unique needs of minority business 
enterprises; and 
(B) enhancing the capacity of minority 
business enterprises. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this divi-
sion are to— 
(1) require the Agency to promote and ad-
minister programs in the public and private 
sectors to assist the development of minor-
ity business enterprises; and 
(2) achieve the development described in 
paragraph (1) by authorizing the Under Sec-
retary to carry out programs that will result 
in increased access to capital, management, 
and technology for minority business enter-
prises.

rity, 
science, 
research, 
innovation, 
manufacturing, and job creation, to es-
tablish a critical supply chain resil-
iency program, and for other purposes; 
which was ordered to lie on the table; 
as follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. llll. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SEN-
ATE REGARDING AN INVESTIGATION 
TO DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF 
COVID–19. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) COVID–19 has taken the lives of over 
3,000,000 individuals around the world. 
(2) 
Understanding 
the 
origins 
of 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic is essential to address-
ing our vulnerabilities and preventing future 
crises. 
(3) In May 2020, the World Health Assembly 
did not authorize the type of comprehensive 
investigation into the origins of COVID–19 
that was required, and instead passed a sig-
nificantly limited compromise resolution, 
with Chinese government support, which did 
not explicitly include in its scope the possi-
bility of a research-related accident. 
(4) The 2020 World Health Assembly resolu-
tion and its terms of reference, which were 
negotiated privately between the World 
Health Organization (in this section referred 
to as ‘‘WHO’’) and Chinese authorities, hand-
ed the Chinese government control over the 
joint-study process by giving the Chinese 
government veto power over which inter-
national experts were allowed to participate 
in the joint study and by agreeing that most 
primary research would be carried out by 
Chinese teams without ensuring broad access 
to primary data by international experts. 
(5) As a result of these terms, the signifi-
cant structural, procedural, and analytical 
shortcomings of the joint study, and the se-
vere restrictions imposed by Chinese au-
thorities, the WHO-convened joint study into 
the origins of COVID–19 was prevented from 
giving a balanced consideration of the mul-
tiple theories of the origin of COVID–19. 
(6) Only 4 of the 313 pages of the joint- 
study team report and its annexes addressed 
the possibility of a laboratory accident, and 
no thorough examination of the lab incident 
hypothesis was carried out by the joint- 
study team. 
(7) Some of the international experts on 
the joint-study team stated that they lacked 
the means and resources to properly inves-
tigate the research-related accident hypoth-
esis, and they were neither able nor meant to 
do such a full investigation but instead were 
acting as a ‘‘study review group’’. 
(8) 
WHO 
Director-General 
Dr. 
Tedros 
Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented on March 
30, 2021, the day the joint-study report was 
released, ‘‘I do not believe that [the joint- 
study team’s] assessment [of a possible lab 
incident] was extensive enough. Further data 
and studies will be needed to reach more ro-
bust conclusions . . . potentially with addi-
tional missions involving specialist experts, 
which I am ready to deploy.’’.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3382 
May 24, 2021 
(9) The WHO Director-General further com-
mented, ‘‘As far as WHO is concerned all 
hypotheses remain on the table . . . We have 
not yet found the source of the virus, and we 
must continue to follow the science and 
leave no stone unturned as we do . . . It is 
clear that we need more research across a 
range of areas, which will entail further field 
visits.’’. 
(10) The March 30, 2021 Joint Statement on 
the WHO-convened COVID–19 Origins Study 
by the United States and 13 other countries 
recognized the severe shortcomings of the 
joint-study process and called for ‘‘a trans-
parent and independent analysis and evalua-
tion, free from interference and undue influ-
ence.’’. 
(11) In spite of the devastation the COVID– 
19 pandemic has caused in the United States 
and around the world, no process currently 
exists to ensure a comprehensive investiga-
tion into the origins of COVID–19. 
(12) Such an investigation is essential for 
ensuring this type of crisis never happens 
again for the benefit of all people, all na-
tions, and future generations. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) a comprehensive scientific and forensic 
investigation to determine the origins of 
COVID–19 must be conducted immediately, 
with full and unrestricted access to all rel-
evant records, samples, and personnel, par-
ticularly in China, and that such investiga-
tion must fully explore all possible origins of 
the COVID–19 pandemic, including an exclu-
sively ‘‘natural’’ zoonosis in the wild, human 
contamination in an animal farm, and a re-
search-related accident; 
(2) the United States delegation to the 
World Health Assembly should do everything 
in its power, in concert with allies and part-
ners around the world, to ensure that a full 
and unrestricted international scientific and 
forensic investigation into the origins of 
COVID–19, with full access to all relevant 
records, samples, and personnel in China, 
will be authorized by the World Health As-
sembly and implemented with extreme ur-
gency; and 
(3) if the Chinese government does not, by 
the end of the 2021 World Health Assembly, 
indicate its full support for a comprehensive 
investigation to determine the origins of 
COVID–19 with unrestricted access to all rel-
evant records, samples, and personnel in 
China, then the United States Government 
should immediately begin planning a par-
allel comprehensive and data-driven inves-
tigation into the origins of COVID–19, in con-
cert with willing partner governments and 
experts around the world.
