S2387 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, MAY 13, 2020 
No. 90 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, the author of unity, re-
mind our lawmakers that people ac-
complish laudable goals more through 
unity than division. May our Senators 
remember that all of us are more effec-
tive than any one of us. 
As our legislators pursue effective-
ness in their work, give them the wis-
dom to forge alliances that make the 
difficult become easy and the impos-
sible become probable. In their search 
for common purposes, inspire them 
with the conviction that nothing is im-
possible for those who believe. 
We pray in Your omnipotent Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). Under the previous order, 
the leadership time is reserved. 
The Senator from Iowa is recognized. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask to speak in morning business for 1 
minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
people often think of prisons as places 
only to send criminals and then forget 
about them. But as I have noted here 
before, most inmates will one day be 
released. 
Helping former criminals become 
productive citizens is very much an im-
portant function of our prison system. 
In recent weeks, inmates in the Iowa 
prison system have acquired what you 
might consider strange skills—but they 
are new skills—and even monetary al-
lowances. They have done this by pro-
ducing personal protective equipment, 
like face shields and masks. During 
this time of the virus pandemic, we all 
know what those are used for. 
I commend these efforts by our pris-
oners and our prison system promoting 
this sort of training. They will help to 
protect the health and safety of the 
prisons and our State in the short 
term, but they will also help inmates 
in the long term. 
These inmates are providing an es-
sential public service, and for that they 
deserve our appreciation. It is an im-
portant contribution that I hope they 
will long remember and that will help 
them to be productive members of soci-
ety when they finish their sentences. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
normally during National Police Week, 
thousands of officers from across the 
country come here to our Nation’s Cap-
ital to honor their comrades who have 
fallen in the line of duty. Obviously, 
the coronavirus has changed the logis-
tics around these kinds of gatherings, 
but it has not made it any less impor-
tant that we honor these brave men 
and women who gave the ultimate sac-
rifice for their neighbors. 
Tonight’s candlelight vigil for fallen 
officers will go on, as a virtual event. 
Our hearts will be united in remem-
bering these heroes as their names are 
added to the National Law Enforce-
ment Officers Memorial. 
I am thinking especially of two of my 
fellow Kentuckians, who will be among 
those memorialized. 
Meade County sheriff’s deputy Chris 
Hulsey answered the call of public serv-
ice with a distinguished career that 
also included time as a firefighter and 
a paramedic. He was attacked while in-
vestigating a suspect and was pro-
nounced dead hours later. 
Chief Deputy Bobby Wayne Jacobs, of 
the Knott County Sheriff’s Office, suf-
fered a fatal heart attack following a 
tense call for service. Bobby’s col-
leagues remember the lasting positive 
impact he made on so many. 
Both of these deputies left behind 
children, loving friends, and a Com-
monwealth made safer by their service. 
We also cannot let this year’s Na-
tional Police Week pass us by without 
reaffirming our gratitude for our very 
own U.S. Capitol Police. These men 
and women protect this institution 
with the greatest professionalism, no 
matter the challenge. 
To all police officers—in Kentucky, 
here in the Capitol, and all across the 
country—your country thanks you. 
f 
FISA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
speaking of keeping our Nation safe, 
the Senate has work of our own to do 
this week to ensure the safety and se-
curity of our Nation. In addition to 
fighting this historic pandemic, it is

also our job to keep sight of the other 
threats to national security that are 
still evolving, independent of COVID– 
19. 
Far from any frontline hospital, the 
PRC’s domineering approach to con-
tested territories in the South China 
Sea is keeping the men and women of 
the U.S. Seventh Fleet on high alert. 
From dark corners of cyber space, 
Russia busies our national security and 
intelligence experts with a steady flow 
of 
infectious 
propaganda 
and 
disinformation. 
From the Mediterranean to the Gulf 
of Aden, Iran continues to expand its 
regional influence, sow division, pro-
mote terror, and threaten America and 
its partners. 
And across Afghanistan, the Taliban, 
al-Qaida, and ISIS continue to under-
mine the work of an international coa-
lition and a representative govern-
ment. 
These are just a few of the global 
threats that were with us long before 
the COVID–19 crisis, and they have 
only gotten worse during the pan-
demic. 
History reminds us that when great 
nations confront profound challenges 
at home, their enemies and competi-
tors do not pause their own efforts 
until the situation becomes more sta-
ble. Rather, from Beijing to Moscow, to 
caves in the Middle East, our adver-
saries would be tickled pink if the 
coronavirus caused the United States 
to lose our ability to multitask. 
Some of our Democratic colleagues 
have implied recently that it is be-
neath the Senate—beneath the Sen-
ate—to spend time on any business 
that does not exclusively pertain to the 
pandemic. I could not disagree more 
strongly. Common sense tells us that 
this crisis demands more vigilance on 
the other fronts of national security, 
not less. When we take our oaths of of-
fice as U.S. Senators, we swear to de-
fend the Constitution against all en-
emies, 
foreign 
and 
domestic. 
This 
coronavirus may have shoved its way 
to the top of that list, but the list is 
still a long one, indeed. 
Unfortunately, 
for 
several 
weeks 
now, our Nation has been less prepared 
than 
normal 
to 
defend 
ourselves 
against those who wish us harm, and it 
is not because of the coronavirus. It is 
because House Democrats have failed 
to act. 
Back in March, the Senate passed a 
clean short-term extension of key au-
thorities under the Foreign Intel-
ligence 
Surveillance 
Act, 
while 
a 
broader renegotiation was under way. 
After the shameful abuses of the FISA 
process that marred the 2016 Presi-
dential campaign, there was a clear 
need for meaningful reforms to bring 
more daylight and accountability into 
the process. But at the same time, 
many of us on both sides of the aisle 
were absolutely intent on preserving 
these critical national security tools 
that have helped keep America safe. 
While discussions were under way on 
how to strike the right balance, the 
Senate passed a bipartisan short-term 
extension so these important tools 
could remain in our national security 
professionals’ hands while Congress got 
our 
act 
together. 
Unfortunately, 
Speaker PELOSI let that extension sit 
on her desk and gather dust. So, for 
more than 8 weeks—8 weeks—these im-
portant tools have gone dark. 
Fortunately, the Attorney General 
and Members of Congress have worked 
together to craft a compromise solu-
tion that will implement needed re-
forms while preserving the core na-
tional security tools. These intense dis-
cussions produced a strong bill that 
balances the need for accountability 
with our solemn obligation to protect 
our citizens and defend our homeland. 
I understand several of our col-
leagues believe this compromise bill is 
not perfect. Sadly, imperfection is a 
fact of life when it comes to com-
promise legislation. While I respect my 
distinguished colleagues whose amend-
ments we will be voting on later today, 
I urge Senators to vote against them. 
The current bill in its current form al-
ready strikes the correct and delicate 
balance, and there is certainly no guar-
antee that another, new version of this 
legislation would necessarily pass the 
House or earn the President’s support. 
This version has already done both. We 
cannot let the perfect become the 
enemy of the good when key authori-
ties are currently sitting expired and 
unusable. 
In sum, while the Senate continues 
overseeing the national response to the 
coronavirus crisis, we are also making 
sure the pandemic does not inflict even 
greater harm by distracting us from 
other threats and challenges that pre-
ceded it. 
Off the floor, our committees are 
working through a number of pressing 
national security nominations, from 
the Director of National Intelligence to 
the Secretary of the Navy, to other 
high-level openings at the Pentagon. 
When the time comes, I hope we will be 
able to fill these crucial openings 
promptly through bipartisan coopera-
tion on the floor. I hope our Demo-
cratic colleagues think carefully before 
applying reflexive partisan delays even 
to vital security positions during a 
global emergency. 
We cannot put Homeland Security on 
autopilot because another crisis has 
our attention. The Senate can, will, 
and must continue to pay attention to 
both.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning

USA FREEDOM REAUTHORIZATION 
ACT OF 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to the consideration of H.R. 6172, 
which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 6172) to amend the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to pro-
hibit the production of certain business 
records, and for other purposes. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
TRIBUTE TO HICKEY FREEMAN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, as you know, when I speak on the 
floor, I remove my mask, but there is a 
special reason to keep this mask on 
today. This mask was made by Hickey 
Freeman, in Rochester, NY—by Amer-
ican labor, union labor, by a grand and 
proud and generous company that has 
been in Rochester for the last three 
centuries—the 1800s, 1900s, and now the 
2000s. It is a wonderful company, and it 
has kept good-paying jobs in America 
to make fine clothing. It started mak-
ing the masks, and it has given them 
to a local hospital at cost. 
So I salute Hickey Freeman. I salute 
the great trades men and women who 
work there. May they continue for 
hundreds of more years to provide jobs 
in Rochester and help when we need 
help. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam 
President, 
yesterday, 
the 
House Democrats unveiled new legisla-
tion to combat the coronavirus pan-
demic. The American people need their 
government to act strongly, decisively, 
wisely, and this new legislation is the 
urgent and necessary response to what 
this crisis demands. 
As any one of us could have guessed, 
the Republican leader is rather predict-
ably responding against the House 
Democratic bill to address the COVID 
crisis. His response is predictable be-
cause, for weeks, Leader MCCONNELL 
has been preemptively slandering any 
legislation that has come out of the 
House as being ‘‘a partisan wish list’’— 
long before he even saw the bill. It was 
a paint-by-numbers response from the 
Republican leader. It continues to be. 
It didn’t matter what was in the bill. 
In his eyes, not in the eyes of almost 
every American, it was going to be a 
far-left, partisan wish list. 
To fit the preordained narrative, last 
night, Senate Republicans were latch-
ing onto provisions that account for 
0.0003 percent of the total bill—0.0003 
percent. Talk about grasping at straws. 
It is so predictable that the Republican 
leader would oppose the bill before he 
would see what was in it, and now that 
it is so necessary for so many Ameri-
cans, it is predictable that the Repub-
licans are just saying no.

S2389 
May 13, 2020 
The Republican leader also called the 
bill aspirational. The Republican lead-
er should know that it is not aspira-
tional when a family can’t feed its chil-
dren; that it is not aspirational when 
Americans, for the first time, are wor-
ried about losing their homes and being 
evicted from their apartments; that it 
is not aspirational when Americans are 
facing a health crisis in which every 
one of us is afraid we might come down 
with a dangerous illness or spread it to 
a loved one. It is not aspirational. We 
are talking about urgent and necessary 
relief, but out of reflective, knee-jerk 
partisanship, the Republican leadership 
in the Senate basically declared the 
House bill dead on arrival before it was 
even announced. 
It is a shocking and incomprehen-
sible position to take at this moment 
of national crisis. It would be one thing 
for the Republican leadership to say: 
Well, let’s sit down and negotiate, and 
let’s talk about where both parties can 
come together to do something for the 
Nation’s well-being at this time of ur-
gent crisis. Yet it has taken the posi-
tion that there is absolutely no ur-
gency to do anything at all. 
On Monday, here is what the Repub-
lican leader said. ‘‘Republicans,’’ he 
said, ‘‘have yet to feel the urgency to 
act immediately.’’ What will it take? 
Are they so wrapped around the hard- 
right ideology that they can’t see the 
real needs of the American people? Is 
there no urgency with testing? Talk to 
your local businesses. Talk to your 
local mayors. Talk to your Governors. 
See if there is no urgency on testing. Is 
there no urgency to provide relief to 
renters and homeowners? no urgency 
to prevent firefighters, police officers, 
and teachers from being laid off by 
State and local governments whose 
budgets are underwater in both blue 
and red States? 
I would like to know how many of 
my Republican colleagues actually op-
pose providing the assurance to State 
and local governments so teachers in 
Iowa, firefighters in North Carolina, 
and police officers in Kentucky don’t 
get laid off. The support our States 
need is in the House bill. It is very 
close to what the Governors—Demo-
cratic and Republican—have asked for. 
Leader MCCONNELL frequently high-
lights the heroism of our essential 
workers, and I applaud him for that. 
Yet why don’t we, in addition to giving 
speeches on the floor, put a little 
money in their pockets for the extra 
expenses they are undergoing? Why 
isn’t there an urgency to provide them 
with hazard pay? That is in the House 
bill. 
Leader MCCONNELL
and President 
Trump have placed a great emphasis on 
reopening the country as quickly as 
possible. That is something we all want 
to see. So how do we achieve that safe-
ly? Far and away, the most important 
factor in reopening the economy is 
testing. We are far behind where we 
should be, despite the President’s lies 
and mistruths about testing. Fauci 
made that clear yesterday. 
Remember that our President said on 
March 6, I think it was, that anyone 
who wants a test can have a test. That 
is even not true today. Deluding the 
American people and running from the 
truth to say what pops into your head 
so it sounds good to the media for that 
moment, which seems to be the Presi-
dent’s MO, doesn’t help. It doesn’t help. 
Everyone knows, until this crisis is 
over and on into the future, we are 
going 
to 
need 
personal 
protective 
equipment to begin safely returning to 
work. As I mentioned, I wore this mask 
on the floor—a mask made in Roch-
ester by Hickey Freeman. The House 
bill includes crucial support for the 
supply chain and manufacturing of 
PPE. Should we wait on that? Is that 
not urgent? Is ambulance workers and 
healthcare workers not having the PPE 
they need not urgent? Who believes 
that? Does Leader MCCONNELL? Does 
President Trump? Do our Republican 
colleagues? 
It is just baffling that at this time of, 
probably, the greatest crisis we have 
faced in decades, both in health and 
economically, the Senate Republican 
leadership, instead of working with the 
Democrats to find common ground on 
these crucial issues, has decided it will 
be against taking urgent and necessary 
action to help the American people—in 
a time of national crisis—unless, of 
course, that means there being liabil-
ity protections for big corporations. 
That seems to be their No. 1 concern. 
More than 30 million Americans are 
now unemployed, and more than 80,000 
Americans have died. Just how many 
lost jobs, lost businesses, lost lives will 
it take before Senate Republicans 
begin to feel the urgency? 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, last week, Americans learned that 
the Trump White House had blocked 
the release of a document by the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention 
that contained guidance for safely re-
opening up the country. According to 
media reports, this guidance was pains-
takingly prepared by the CDC to help 
the country determine when and how it 
could begin easing social distancing 
without causing undo risk to public 
health—the further spread of COVID, 
the recurrence of a second wave, and 
more infections and more deaths. 
The CDC guidance includes detailed 
information and flowcharts to help 
guide States, local governments, busi-
nesses, schools, churches, religious in-
stitutions, and individuals as they con-
sider these very challenging questions. 
Businesses want to know how and when 
to open. Citizens want to know how 
they should behave to protect them-
selves, yet get the country open. The 
CDC guidance includes detailed infor-
mation and flowcharts to help. 
Now, a version of this document ap-
peared in the media, but we still don’t 
have the official document as com-
pleted by the CDC. Of course, all Amer-
icans, regardless of where they live or 
what parties they belong to, want to 
get back to normal as quickly as pos-
sible. I know every Member of the Sen-
ate wants that to happen as soon as it 
possibly can. I certainly do. Yet mak-
ing the wrong decisions about when, 
where, and how fast to reopen could re-
sult in the loss of precious lives that 
could be saved, and the recurrence of a 
COVID second wave—God forbid—could 
be worse than the first. 
In order to make these decisions 
widely, the country needs guidance 
from the Nation’s best medical and sci-
entific experts. These are literally 
matters of life and of death, and that is 
exactly why the CDC prepared this 
guidance. Yet the White House has 
blocked the release of the CDC guid-
ance, reportedly so the President and 
his 
political 
appointees 
can 
make 
changes to it. As we all know, the 
President is not a doctor, and the 
President is not a scientist. Many don’t 
even believe he is a stable genius like 
he thinks he is. It has become painfully 
clear over the past 2 months how unfa-
miliar he is with the disciplines of 
science and medicine. Anyone who 
would say drink bleach—use bleach—to 
protect yourself is not much of a med-
ical expert. So it is difficult, if not im-
possible, to imagine any legitimate, 
constructive purpose in the desire by 
the President or his staff to edit the 
CDC’s work. 
I wish President Trump and his aides 
could be trusted to tell the American 
people the truth about this public 
health crisis. I wish they could be 
trusted not to engage in the political 
censorship of the medical and scientific 
judgments of our Nation’s foremost ex-
perts, but at this point in the crisis, 
after all of the faults, after all of the 
disinformation, after all of the trans-
parent attempts at political spin, every 
American knows full well that the 
President and his staff simply cannot 
be trusted to tell the truth about the 
coronavirus. 
Just 
yesterday, 
the 
President 
claimed that COVID–19 cases are fall-
ing everywhere in America, but an-
other report that is also yet to be re-
leased 
by 
the 
President’s 
own 
coronavirus task force is said to show 
that its infection rates are spiking to 
new heights in a number of large and 
small communities around the coun-
try—places in Tennessee and Iowa, 
Texas and Kentucky. The point is that 
America needs and must have the can-
did guidance of our best scientists that 
is unfiltered, unedited, and uncensored 
by President Trump or his political 
minions. 
The CDC report on reopening the 
country is an important piece of guid-
ance, and the Senate should unani-
mously support the uncensored release 
of that document. Therefore, I will now 
offer a very simple and brief unani-
mous consent request, and I hope all 
Senators will support it. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 572

consent the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of S. Res. 572,

the report of the Centers for Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention, 
entitled 
‘‘Guidance for Implementing the Open-
ing Up America Again Framework,’’ be 
released immediately. I further ask 
that the resolution be agreed to and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, in re-
serving the right to object, in my 
mind, the argument that the White 
House and the task force have not been 
transparent is a faux argument by the 
minority leader. He is really trying to 
let career regulators at agencies like 
the CDC bog down the economy again 
with bureaucratic hurdles. I probably 
know that as well as any Senator here 
because, 12 years ago, I fought to re-
form healthcare and its related agen-
cies that bogged the system down—a 
system that has given us healthcare 
costs that are double that of any other 
across the country. We will get back to 
that, but 80 Senators on both sides of 
the aisle weighed in on that before the 
coronavirus raised its ugly head. 
The White House and the task force 
have been beyond transparent in the 
midst of this outbreak, indeed, in its 
holding an unprecedented number of 
daily press briefings and in its allowing 
for a free flow of information that has 
been central to the White House’s re-
opening efforts. This is not about 
transparency, and the White House is 
always going to be in favor of trans-
parency. The President comes from a 
world of entrepreneurs, one in which 
we embrace competition. This is about 
the minority leader’s trying to use the 
bureaucracy at the CDC to bog down 
the economy. 
From this point forward, we have to 
make sure that we adhere to every-
thing the healthcare experts have told 
us, but we have to be able to do a cou-
ple of things at once, which means hav-
ing a smart restart to the economy. 
The CDC and other health agencies 
were targets of the White House’s de-
regulation efforts from day one, and 
they were the most challenging regu-
latory agencies to rein in. The Demo-
crats and the bureaucrats, who are con-
tent with the status quo, have been 
blocking efforts to deregulate since 
President Trump took office. 
How can we do that when decades 
have brought us to the point at which 
the healthcare system, in general, 
doesn’t make sense to a mainstream 
entrepreneur like me, who has found 
that a different dynamic works? The 
CDC, for example, was in the driver’s 
seat during the initial stages of the 
outbreak. 
Its 
missteps 
on 
testing 
forced us to take a one-size-fits-all ap-
proach, which didn’t make sense to 
many of us. 
We could have handled this in a way 
so as not to have now put us on the 
precipice of there being an even greater 
calamity. The inability to conduct 
early and wide testing in the United 
States, caused by the CDC’s and FDA’s 
overly prescriptive stodginess, pro-
longed the testing process in the early 
stages when it should have been expe-
dited. The result has been one-size-fits- 
all, which we are contending with cur-
rently. 
Thanks to the White House’s efforts 
to fight off the regulatory swamp at 
the CDC and its efforts to fix the test-
ing problems caused by regulators, we 
now lead the world in testing. Yester-
day, I submitted for the RECORD, from 
that over 2-hour briefing with the 
healthcare experts, that timeline re-
ferred to. It happened from late Janu-
ary through early March. 
Senator SCHUMER wants to release 
the CDC’s version of the reopening 
guidance, but the White House and sen-
ior health officials rejected the initial 
CDC recommendations in that version 
because the recommendations were 
overly proscriptive, infringed upon re-
ligious rights, and risked further dam-
aging the economy. Are we really going 
to let the CDC shutter the economy for 
a second time, like it did with testing, 
by its dictating overly proscriptive 
guidelines? President Trump’s deregu-
latory agenda has proven to be an im-
mediate success because we have gone 
from being initially mired in bureau-
cratic hurdles to our leading the world 
in testing and successfully flattening 
the curve and fighting the virus. 
I spoke to a CEO of a pharmaceutical 
company, which is headquartered in In-
diana, who said the very same thing. It 
was stymied from the get-go. It, among 
other pharmaceutical companies, has 
put together an entrepreneurial effort 
to tackle this. It is not going to be 
done by trying to tie its hands. It is 
close to getting testing where it is 
going to work for all of us. I have a 
business that three of my four kids 
run. We want to make sure we have 
testing to make sure that we can bring 
employees into a healthy environment 
and take care of customers. All busi-
nesses share that concern. 
The minority leader and Democrats 
do not want to reopen the economy be-
cause, I think, frankly, we had the best 
one I have ever seen, in the 37 years I 
was the CEO of a Main Street com-
pany, that went from a little company 
like the minority leader always talks 
about. We share that interest. I was 
disappointed when the PPP did come 
out that they weren’t helped first. We 
got that fixed. Let’s stay focused on 
that. 
We keep moving the goalposts for re-
opening. If we do that, we risk, in eco-
nomic terms, what is called demand 
and 
supply 
destruction, 
and 
there 
would not be enough Federal dollars to 
remedy that. 
The White House proactively gave us 
the appropriate roadmap to get the 
economy back on track. We should not 
leave something as important as re-
opening the country to career regu-
lators at the CDC, an agency that set 
back our response efforts due to their 
overly prescriptive approach. 
U.S. testing exploded once the White 
House’s efforts to increase testing and 
fight off the regulatory bureaucrats 
won out. The same thing will happen 
with reopening the economy, using the 
reopening guidance as a roadmap under 
the President’s leadership. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
two quick points. My friend, who is my 
friend from Indiana, said the White 
House has always been transparent and 
believed in transparency. Does any 
American believe that? Does any Sen-
ator believe that? Does my friend from 
Indiana actually believe that the White 
House has always been transparent? 
Second, he has said that America 
leads the world in testing. Does any 
independent scientist believe that? Is 
there anyone who believes we are lead-
ing in testing; that we have done as 
President Trump said—that we have 
accomplished everything in testing? 
Does anyone outside the White House 
and their acolytes believe that? I doubt 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, so far 
Congress has passed four coronavirus 
relief bills that have provided $2.4 tril-
lion to meet the coronavirus crisis. Our 
goal has been to provide a comprehen-
sive response addressing not just the 
medical priorities but also the eco-
nomic impact this virus has had on so 
many American families. 
We 
have 
provided 
funding 
for 
coronavirus testing, for medical care, 
for personal protective equipment for 
frontline medical personnel, for vac-
cine and treatment development, for 
veterans, for nutrition programs, for 
first responders, for unemployment 
benefits, for elementary schools, high 
schools, and colleges, for farmers and 
ranchers. The Coronavirus Aid Relief 
and Economic Security Act, or the 
CARES Act, the third relief bill we 
passed, provided nearly $350 billion for 
the Paycheck Protection Program to 
help small businesses keep employees 
on their payroll during this crisis. 
When the program ran out of money, 
we provided another $310 billion to en-
sure that as many small businesses as 
possible were able to take advantage of 
this help. 
The CARES Act also appropriated 
$293 billion for direct payments to 
American citizens to help them get 
through this difficult time. At this 
point, government agencies are focused 
on getting all of the aid we passed out 
the door. Some programs, such as the 
Paycheck Protection Program, have 
been up and running practically since 
day one. More than 4 million busi-
nesses have applied for or already re-
ceived forgivable loans through the 
Paycheck Protection Program, ena-
bling millions of workers to keep their

jobs. The vast majority of direct pay-
ments to American citizens, approxi-
mately 130 million so far, have been 
sent out. Other aid is still in the proc-
ess of getting out the door. 
The Department of Agriculture re-
cently announced it will use funds ap-
propriated in the CARES Act, plus 
other money, to issue direct payments 
to farmers and ranchers affected by 
this crisis. These payments are ex-
pected to reach farmers and ranchers 
in late May or early June. 
Over the course of four coronavirus 
bills, we provided more than $500 bil-
lion to State and local governments. 
That is equal to roughly 25 percent of 
the yearly operating budgets of the 50 
States combined. That money includes 
at least $185 billion for unemployment 
benefits, $150 billion for general relief 
funds for States, localities, and Tribes; 
$45 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund; 
nearly $26 billion for nutrition pro-
grams; $13 billion for school districts; 
$4 billion to help the homeless; more 
than $1 billion for first responders; and 
there is so much more. 
On top of that, Congress directed the 
Federal Reserve to provide an addi-
tional $500 billion in loans to help 
States 
and 
municipalities 
manage 
cashflow issues during the pandemic. A 
lot of the money that we have provided 
has already been sent to States while 
some is still in the process of being dis-
bursed. Meanwhile, States are in the 
process of figuring out how to spend 
the money they have received—some 
they have spent and some they have 
not—which brings me to an important 
point. 
My friends across the aisle are push-
ing for more money, more money, more 
money. Yesterday, the House of Rep-
resentatives 
unveiled 
a 
$3 
trillion 
coronavirus relief bill—that is right, $3 
trillion. 
But we haven’t yet seen the effects of 
the money we have provided already. It 
is difficult to understand how Demo-
crats can call for an additional $3 tril-
lion—all money borrowed, I might add, 
on the backs of younger workers and 
our children and grandchildren—when 
they haven’t even seen what existing 
funds have been used for or whether 
they have been used at all. 
Nobody is questioning—nobody is 
questioning that we may need addi-
tional money to address this crisis. Re-
publicans have stepped up and appro-
priated $2.4 trillion—roughly, 50 per-
cent of the entire Federal budget for 
2020. That is an extraordinary amount 
of money, but these are extraordinary 
circumstances, and they call for an ex-
traordinary response. But it is impor-
tant to remember that every dollar of 
what 
we 
have 
appropriated 
for 
coronavirus is borrowed money, and to-
day’s young workers and our children 
and grandchildren are going to be pay-
ing for this borrowing. 
We are putting an incredible burden 
on younger generations. We have an 
absolute obligation to make sure that 
we are only appropriating what is real-
ly needed. The way we find out what is 
really needed is by carefully moni-
toring the implementation of the $2.4 
trillion that we have already provided, 
not by rushing to provide trillions 
more before we know whether and 
where they are needed. Once the money 
we have already provided has been 
fully allocated, we will have a better 
sense of where we may need to appro-
priate additional funds and where we 
have spent enough. 
It is also important to remember 
that there are other things we can do 
in Congress besides borrowing money 
that younger generations will have to 
pay. Yesterday, the leader came down 
to the floor to talk about the liability 
protections the Republicans are pur-
suing for healthcare workers, busi-
nesses, and others on the frontline in 
response to reopening. As the leader 
noted, hundreds of coronavirus law-
suits have already been filed around 
the country, and these lawsuits rep-
resent a real threat to our economic re-
covery. Doctors and hospitals, for ex-
ample, are making extraordinary ef-
forts 
to 
protect 
patients 
and 
healthcare workers but are still reluc-
tant to resume noncoronavirus-related 
medical care for fear of being sued if a 
patient were somehow exposed to the 
disease in the process of receiving care. 
Businesses are worried that they can 
be held responsible if one of their em-
ployees develops coronavirus, even if 
the business took every reasonable pre-
caution to discourage infection. 
There is obviously a place for law-
suits when individuals or businesses 
engage in gross negligence or inten-
tional misconduct. We will not be giv-
ing a free pass to anyone who fails in 
their basic duties during this crisis, 
but we need to make sure that medical 
professionals and small businesses and 
others can get back to running their 
operations and employing Americans 
without worrying that an army of trial 
lawyers is about to descend. 
There are undoubtedly other things 
we can do to help Americans get back 
to work and deal with the effects of 
coronavirus without spending trillions 
of dollars, everything from regulatory 
reform to ensuring that frontline vol-
unteers don’t face surprise tax bills. 
That is not to say that we will not be 
providing additional funding. In fact, it 
is likely that we will have to appro-
priate more money for the coronavirus 
response, but as I have already said, it 
is absolutely essential—essential—that 
we consider further investment care-
fully and only spend money where it is 
truly needed. 
My friends across the aisle tend to 
think that government money and gov-
ernment programs are the solution lit-
erally to every crisis. They are happy 
to throw taxpayer dollars around with-
out thought to the consequences of fu-
ture generations. Disturbingly, more 
than one Democrat has indicated that 
they would like to take advantage of 
this crisis to remake America in their 
own far-left image. That is not a re-
sponsible response. 
Republicans are going to continue to 
do everything we can to help Ameri-
cans through this crisis. We are com-
mitted to meeting the country’s needs 
while spending taxpayer dollars respon-
sibly and with an eye to the burden we 
are placing on younger workers and fu-
ture generations of Americans. 
We undoubtedly have more difficult 
days ahead, but our country is strong 
and so are the American people. We are 
going to get through this. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip is recognized. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
came to the floor this morning to lis-
ten to the statements made by the 
other side of the aisle in reaction to 
the proposal of Speaker PELOSI to deal 
with the coronavirus and the national 
emergency we face. 
The 
Republican 
leader, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL of Kentucky, as well as his 
whip, repeated their theme on the issue 
of the liability facing businesses and 
others because of the COVID virus pan-
demic which we are facing. In fact, the 
leader, Senator MCCONNELL, has gone 
so far as to declare that there is a ‘‘red-
line’’—his words, a ‘‘redline’’—to bar 
any further assistance to State and 
local governments and other entities 
until we address this so-called liability 
question. He has gone so far as to say 
that he will refuse to fund the money 
that has been proposed officially by the 
Democrats to help our police, fire-
fighters, paramedics, and teachers un-
less we provide guaranteed business 
immunity from COVID–19 lawsuits— 
lawsuits that might be brought by 
workers and consumers. 
Senator 
MCCONNELL’s 
guaranteed 
business immunity is an invitation, 
sadly, for irresponsible corporations to 
cut corners when it comes to pro-
tecting workers as well as protecting 
their customers. The McConnell red-
line threat will result in more people 
being infected by the coronavirus and 
more people getting sick—exactly the 
opposite of what we should be doing as 
a matter of policy. 
We also heard today, both from Sen-
ators MCCONNELL
and THUNE, that 
there is no urgency in continuing to 
provide assistance across America be-
cause of the economic crisis that we 
face and certainly the public health 
crisis we face. I couldn’t disagree more 
on both counts—the McConnell redline 
on guaranteeing business immunity as 
well as the argument that we have 
done enough. Let’s sit back and wait 
and see what happens. I couldn’t dis-
agree more. 
Yesterday, we had a hearing before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen-
ator GRAHAM held the hearing and the 
title was ‘‘Examining the Liability 
During the COVID–19 Pandemic.’’ That 
hearing took place yesterday afternoon 
after Senator MCCONNELL had come to 
the floor and had spoken about the 
concerns of businesses about lawsuits 
against them related to the COVID–19 
virus.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2392 
May 13, 2020 
In fact, Senator MCCONNELL came to 
the floor yesterday morning and char-
acterized the lawsuits that were being 
filed and pending because of this pan-
demic, and the words he used to char-
acterize them were very explicit. He 
called it an ‘‘epidemic of frivolous law-
suits.’’ He referred to the ‘‘minefield’’ 
created by these lawsuits. He went so 
far as to call them a ‘‘tidal wave’’— 
‘‘tidal wave,’’ his words on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate when it came to these 
lawsuits related to COVID–19. 
So I went into this with my staff and 
said: Tell me about this tidal wave of 
lawsuits. Here is what we discovered 
about this so-called tidal wave of law-
suits. As of Monday, there are 958 
COVID-related cases that had been dis-
covered in a tracking database of law-
suits filed in the United States—958. 
But then we took a closer look. 
How many of these lawsuits were 
malpractice 
suits 
being 
brought 
against 
hospitals, 
clinics, 
doctors, 
nurses, medical professionals? Nine. 
Nine lawsuits. There have been 1.3 mil-
lion Americans diagnosed as infected 
by the COVID–19 virus, and 9 lawsuits 
have been filed. 
Senator MCCONNELL calls that a tidal 
wave. A tidal wave? It is barely a rip-
ple. 
We added 27 other cases for personal 
injury. We are up to 36 cases out of 1.3 
million Americans who have been diag-
nosed as infected—36 cases. That is not 
to say that they are all serious or all 
frivolous. No way of saying. I am 
counting all lawsuits of personal injury 
and medical malpractice brought be-
cause of COVID–19. 
We took a look at other lawsuits. 
There are 260 lawsuits that have been 
filed by prisoners in jails arguing that 
they were held in an unhealthy, unsan-
itary, and unsafe condition. Is that 
what the Senator wants to stop? Does 
he consider that a tidal wave of law-
suits? 
There are 171 cases brought against 
insurance companies. In other words, a 
business is suing an insurance company 
over the coverage they have in their in-
surance policy. Is that one of the ava-
lanche 
of 
lawsuits 
that 
Senator 
MCCONNELL is talking about? 
There are 95 contract cases and 79 
civil rights cases. We took a look at 
the civil rights cases being filed with 
mention of COVID–19, and, you know, 
many of them were being filed by busi-
nesses arguing that they should be al-
lowed to reopen. Is Senator MCCONNELL 
suggesting that we should be prohib-
iting those lawsuits as well? 
What it comes down to is this. There 
is no tidal wave of lawsuits. We 
shouldn’t condition helping businesses, 
unemployed people, and individuals 
across America because of this phan-
tom threat of lawsuits. I am surprised 
that they didn’t refer to a caravan of 
trial lawyers coming up to the court-
houses across America. It just isn’t 
there. 
Yesterday, in a hearing, we had some 
excellent witnesses. One of the better 
witnesses, I will be happy to concede, 
was a person brought in by the Repub-
lican Senators. His name is Kevin 
Smartt. Kevin is the chief executive of-
ficer and president of Kwik Chek Food 
Stores out of Bonham, TX. He was 
speaking on behalf of the National As-
sociation of Convenience Stores. 
He told the story of what he has done 
with his businesses and outlets and 600 
employees to make it safer for them. 
He has really gone, based on his testi-
mony, to great lengths to create a safe 
workplace. But Listen to what Kevin 
Smartt said about the problems he 
faces. 
Here is his testimony: ‘‘This was a 
challenge [mitigating the threat] be-
cause the guidance provided by the 
CDC, [OSHA] as well as state and local 
governments often conflicted with one 
another in addition to being vague and 
difficult to follow.’’ 
What he was looking for and stated 
in his sworn testimony were guidelines 
for a safe workplace, guidelines for a 
safe business place, and they don’t 
exist. One of the reasons came up ear-
lier this morning when Senator SCHU-
MER came to the floor and said: We 
want to see the CDC guidelines re-
leased so businesses and individuals 
across America can see how to deal 
with this threat in the workplace. 
There was an objection on the Repub-
lican side of the aisle for the publica-
tion of these CDC guidelines. They 
can’t have it both ways. They can’t 
argue 
through 
Senator 
MCCONNELL 
that we should have guaranteed busi-
ness immunity from liability and then 
basically say to the businesses, as Mr. 
Smartt told us, there are no guidelines. 
You see, that is a defense in any law-
suit. We live by the guidelines. We have 
appropriate social distancing. We put 
up the plastic shields to protect em-
ployees and customers. We have people 
wearing masks. 
Those are all good defenses in any 
lawsuit that might be brought, but the 
Republicans want it both ways: guar-
anteed immunity for the business but 
no guidelines from the government as 
to what is a safe practice. Mr. Smartt 
said that makes his job next to impos-
sible in his important business in 
Texas. 
But there were numbers given to us 
yesterday that really did show a tidal 
wave. Marc Perrone is the president of 
the 
United 
Food 
and 
Commercial 
Workers. He testified before our com-
mittee, and during the course of his 
testimony he told us that 162 of his 
workers—those who are in grocery 
stores, food processing, and particu-
larly in meat processing, 162—have died 
from COVID–19. 
Now, working in a meatpacking plant 
is something I know a little bit about. 
I worked my way through college—12 
months—in a meatpacking plant in 
East St. Louis, IL. It is dirty, hot, and 
dangerous work, elbow to elbow with 
fellow workers. I saw it firsthand. It 
has 
changed—I 
am 
sure—over 
the 
years, but the fundamentals are still 
there, and that is the danger of that 
workplace. The most dangerous work-
place in America—meat processing. 
There have been 162 deaths and 25,000 of 
Marc Perrone’s workers who have been 
infected so far with COVID–19. 
So, if you want to talk about a tidal 
wave, we ought to take a look at what 
those workers in meat processing are 
facing right now. Some companies are, 
conscientiously, trying to do the right 
thing and make their workplace better 
and safer and test their employees. I 
salute all of them. There are good peo-
ple who are leading these businesses, 
and they are making good decisions, 
but they need the guidelines and stand-
ards of the CDC and OSHA. And the Re-
publicans just objected to publishing 
those standards. 
I want to tell you, there is a way 
through this pandemic in a sensible 
fashion that is fair to business and fair 
to workers as well. This notion that 
giving guaranteed immunity to busi-
nesses across the board is the answer is 
just plain wrong. Those businesses— 
many of them—will take advantage of 
that umbrella of protection from any 
lawsuits. They will cut corners. More 
people will be infected, and there will 
be more bad results. 
Conscientious businesses like the one 
represented yesterday on the Repub-
lican side in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee deserve what Mr. Smartt is ask-
ing for—standards we can stand by and 
live with. 
HEROES ACT 
Mr. President, let me say a word 
about this HEROES Act that was re-
leased yesterday by Speaker PELOSI. 
Yes, she has asked for more money to 
be spent. We have to decide whether it 
is worth spending. 
Is it worth giving more direct eco-
nomic payments to families across 
America? 
I 
supported 
President 
Trump’s call for those payments in the 
first round. Does he believe, do we be-
lieve, does the Senate believe that 
$1,200 is the end of the story for people 
who are struggling these days, facing 
unemployment, facing the hardships 
that are part of our economy? 
The flood of people at our food banks 
tells us that people need more re-
sources to provide the basics for their 
family. Senator MCCONNELL has told us 
that is not an urgent need. Well, he 
ought to go to a food bank in Kentucky 
and take a look around. He is going to 
see a lot of people—not just Democrats 
but Republicans and Independents— 
facing the hardships of this economy. 
To say it is not urgent that we pro-
vide money to hospitals—I will tell 
you, even in the areas of Illinois— 
smalltown, rural Illinois—hospitals are 
struggling even if they don’t have 
COVID virus infections to deal with. 
They are struggling because of the 
economy and people who are leery 
about going forward with elective sur-
gery and outpatient treatment. 
One thing to keep in mind: Even if 
you happen to have a hospital in a re-
mote, rural area with little or no infec-
tion from the COVID virus, if you want

to return to elective surgery, good 
medical practice requires that you test 
the patient before the surgery to see if 
they are positive for COVID virus. Hos-
pitals I have talked to are also testing 
the drivers who are going to take the 
patient home after the procedure. 
We need testing so that these hos-
pitals, even in areas not directly af-
fected by this pandemic, can get back 
in business and keep their doors open. 
What a tragedy it is, in any State, to 
lose hospitals in rural areas. 
Speaker PELOSI, in her bill, the HE-
ROES Act, calls for additional funds 
for these hospitals. I think there is a 
sense of urgency to that. Clearly, Sen-
ator MCCONNELL does not. 
The notion that we would honor the 
people 
who 
are 
working 
on 
the 
frontlines to make sure that they 
would be able to continue to serve us 
and to risk their lives for us in treating 
the patients—I think that is a priority, 
and there is a sense of urgency, and I 
think Speaker PELOSI was correct in 
including that money to give those 
first responders, health workers, and 
others a helping hand. 
And let me say that this notion that 
we shouldn’t be helping State and local 
governments—who in the world do we 
think is on the frontline in the battle 
against this national emergency, this 
pandemic? It is the doctors, of course, 
and the nurses, of course, but it is also 
our first responders, our policemen, our 
firefighters, and even our teachers. 
If we don’t provide the resources that 
have been lost to the States and local-
ities because of this pandemic, there 
will be cutbacks in pay and layoffs for 
sure. Is that how we are going to an-
swer this national emergency? I believe 
there is a profound sense of urgency 
here as well. 
I notice that a couple of my col-
leagues are on the floor to speak, so I 
will wrap up my remarks by saying we 
need to stick with this program of 
helping America get back on its feet. 
We need to stand by the individuals 
who are struggling to feed their fami-
lies and going to food banks to try to 
get by. We need to stand by those who 
are drawing unemployment insurance 
today with additional Federal help, 
trying to keep their families together 
while they are looking for a job and 
waiting for the economy to rebound. 
We need to stand by the small busi-
nesses that cannot survive if we don’t 
continue our assistance. This notion 
that because it was Speaker PELOSI 
who suggested it, it has to be a bad 
idea is just plain wrong and selfish. 
Look at her proposals on their mer-
its. They mirror what we have started 
to do with the CARES Act and need to 
continue to do. As I said yesterday, you 
don’t build a bridge halfway across a 
river. You build it all the way. 
Let’s build it to the point where our 
economy can rebound with strength 
and people can get back to work. Let’s 
stand by the workers and their families 
and the businesses and support the HE-
ROES Act that has been introduced in 
the House of Representatives. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). The Senator from Louisiana. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am 
honored to follow my friend, the senior 
Senator from Illinois. I enjoyed his 
comments very much. 
As the Presiding Officer knows, this 
Congress has passed, I think, four bills 
to provide money to the American peo-
ple, to the American healthcare deliv-
ery system, and to businesswomen and 
businessmen throughout our country 
to fight the coronavirus and the dam-
age it has done to our public health 
and also to our economy. 
We have spent and will spend—be-
cause all of the money is not yet 
spent—about 
$3 
trillion. 
That 
is 
$3,000,000,000,000. That is $3,000 billion. 
We don’t even take in that much 
money in a year. We take in, in rev-
enue, about 90 percent of that. So we 
borrow the money. 
I voted for the bills. We had to do it. 
The Federal Reserve, through its lend-
ing facilities, including but not limited 
to its 13(3) lending facilities, will prob-
ably spend at least another $3 trillion. 
I asked one of the senior officials at 
the Federal Reserve yesterday, and he 
told me that in the past 2 months the 
balance sheet of the Federal Reserve 
has doubled. 
Now, many of the transactions con-
ducted by the Federal Reserve, of 
course, are loans, but we know that all 
of the loans aren’t going to be paid 
back. And since the Federal Reserve 
can’t lose money, we are going to have 
to appropriate probably even more 
money than we appropriated in the 
CARES Act to backstop those losses. 
So we are up to $6 trillion, let’s say. 
Speaker PELOSI, as the Presiding Offi-
cer knows, has introduced a new bill 
that would spend another $3 trillion 
that, of course, we will have to borrow. 
Some Americans think we just print 
the money. We don’t. We issue Treas-
ury securities, which is just basically a 
bond. We borrow the money from peo-
ple—from many Americans, many for-
eigners, including but not limited to 
China, and we have to pay that money 
back. 
So now we are up to $9 trillion—that 
is 9,000,000,000,000—and our total debt 
is—that is going to put us at about $28 
trillion. I am not going to repeat the 
zeroes again. I think I have made my 
point. 
Now, Speaker PELOSI’s bill is not 
going to pass the U.S. Senate in its 
present form. You don’t have to be a 
senior at the University of Georgia to 
know that. It has provisions in it—for 
one thing, it costs $3 trillion, as I just 
pointed out. For another thing, it will 
expand the Affordable Care Act, which, 
of course, is controversial in the Sen-
ate. 
It will change our election laws dra-
matically. Some have suggested that 
Speaker PELOSI’s bill will basically fed-
eralize elections, take them away from 
our States, which is certainly not con-
templated and I think is forbidden by 
the U.S. Constitution. 
Speaker PELOSI’s bill will dramati-
cally change our immigration laws. It 
will provide amnesty for people who 
are in our country illegally during the 
coronavirus pandemic. It will provide a 
lot of money—hundreds of millions of 
dollars—to people who are in our coun-
try illegally. Some will like that. Some 
will not like that. But the point I am 
trying to make is it will be controver-
sial. 
Speaker PELOSI’s bill will release 
many of our Federal prisoners during 
the coronavirus unless the Bureau of 
Prisons can affirmatively show that 
those prisoners are not going to go out 
and commit a violent crime. In other 
words, the Bureau of Prisons has to 
prove that John Doe, the prisoner who 
is being released, is not going to go out 
and commit a violent crime. That is an 
impossible 
standard, 
of 
course, 
to 
meet. 
Speaker PELOSI’s bill is very pro-can-
nabis. I don’t know how the Presiding 
Officer feels about cannabis—that is 
your business—but it is controversial 
in the U.S. Senate. I think it mentions 
cannabis something like 28 times. 
Finally, Speaker PELOSI’s bill ad-
dresses, in many respects, the subject 
of race. For example, it directs every 
Federal agency to keep deposits in mi-
nority-owned banks. I am not sug-
gesting that that is good or bad. I am 
just suggesting to you it will be very 
controversial. And, for that reason, the 
bill is not going to pass this body in its 
present form. 
Now, that sets up three scenarios. 
One scenario is that Speaker PELOSI, of 
course, she knows her bill isn’t going 
to pass, and she doesn’t intend for it to 
pass. It is what we call a messaging 
bill: She is sending a message on behalf 
of her party with an eye toward the No-
vember elections. It is done around 
here all the time. So one scenario is it 
is just a messaging bill, and it is polit-
ical pageantry. 
There is a second possibility; that 
this is her opening bid and that the 
leadership in the Senate on the Demo-
cratic side and the leadership in the 
Senate on the Republican side and the 
Republican leadership in the House and 
Speaker PELOSI and probably Treasury 
Secretary Mnuchin will then sit down 
and negotiate, without much input, 
quite frankly, from Members of the 
Senate. I don’t know how it works in 
the House. 
They will sit down and come up with 
something, and then they will come 
back to us. I am in labor, not manage-
ment. They will come back to us and 
say: Here it is; take it or leave it— 
without much input from us individ-
ually. That has happened before. It has 
happened a lot before. 
Then we have a choice. We can either 
say, geez, you know, we weren’t a part 
of this process, or we can moan and 
groan and grumble and then just follow 
our leaders into the chute. We can moo 
and follow our leaders into the chute 
like cattle and vote for it.

May 13, 2020 
The third scenario, with respect to 
the Speaker’s bill, would be that the 
second scenario happens but the Mem-
bers of the Senate and the Members of 
the House bow up and say: Uh-uh. Not 
this time. We are not going to moo and 
follow our leadership into the chute 
like cattle. We don’t agree with what 
they did. 
That is a particular danger in the 
House because, again, you don’t have 
to be in Mensa to understand that 
Speaker PELOSI has drafted a bill to ad-
dress the interests and concerns of the 
leftwing of her party in the House. 
So I can see a third scenario, where 
the powers that be negotiate what they 
see as a compromise and that com-
promise is taken back to the House and 
the liberal Members of the House—I 
don’t use ‘‘liberal’’ and ‘‘conservative’’ 
in a pejorative sense—the liberal Mem-
bers of the House say: The short answer 
is no. The long answer is hell no; we 
are not going to vote for that. 
That could also happen in the Senate 
on my side of the aisle. Our leaders 
could negotiate a package and come 
back and say: OK. Here is the deal. The 
liability provision is going to cost you 
$1 trillion in extra spending. 
I can see some Republicans—one of 
them is standing right over here. I 
don’t speak for him, but he is my good 
friend from Florida who is going to 
have some heartburn if that happens. 
And then nothing happens. We have 
appropriated, as I mentioned—I don’t 
want to belabor the point—$3 trillion, 
another $3 trillion if you add the Fed-
eral Reserve. Some of that money went 
to States and local governments—$150 
billion. My State got about $3 billion. 
Many of the States need that money. 
I am not saying that we aren’t going to 
have to share, sacrifice here. I am not 
saying that we shouldn’t ask our State 
and local governments to submit to us 
revenue estimates. I am not saying 
that we shouldn’t ask them to pare 
down their budgets. We ought to pare 
down ours as well. 
But, to me, it is undeniable that 
States and local governments have sus-
tained damage from the coronavirus. 
For God’s sake, their economy has 
been shut down. If you are a State that 
relies on sales tax, nobody has been 
buying anything—or at least not like 
they did before. If you are a State that 
relies on income tax, income tax hasn’t 
been coming in because nobody has 
been open. 
Now, some of my colleagues believe 
that we should not give the States any 
latitude to use any of that $150 billion 
to address revenue shortfalls. And I un-
derstand that point of view. I do. 
You take Florida, for example. In a 
few moments, Senator SCOTT is going 
to speak. He was Governor of Florida 
for 8 years, did an incredible job, bal-
anced their budget, grew employment 
dramatically. And I can understand—I 
am not speaking for my good friend, 
the Senator, but I can understand how 
someone in the Senate would say: Well, 
no. Every Governor needs to go reform 
his entire State government. 
But that is not going to happen—at 
least not within the next year. In the 
meantime, I believe that State and 
local governments have sustained dam-
age, and I think that is just a natural 
fact. They have. 
I have a bill, S. 3608. It is called the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund Flexibility for 
State and Local Government Act. Sen-
ator SULLIVAN has another bill that 
does somewhat the same thing as mine. 
I think Senator ROUNDS has a bill. 
All my bill would do is this. That $150 
billion we have already spent, which 
now has been given to the States and 
local governments, says it can only be 
used for coronavirus expenses. 
My bill will change that. My bill 
would not spend a single, solitary new 
dollar. 
Let me say that again. My bill will 
not add to our spending. It just says 
that the Governors have additional 
flexibility to spend the $150 billion that 
we have already given them. They 
can’t spend it to bail out their pension 
systems. My bill prohibits that. They 
can spend it to address a revenue short-
fall, which many of them have. 
We will never agree in this body 
about which State is well-managed and 
which State is not well-managed. One 
person’s 
trash 
is 
another 
person’s 
treasure. I have personal feelings. Sen-
ator SCOTT does. I see my good friend 
Senator WARNER is here. He was a very 
distinguished Governor of Virginia. He 
will probably have a different point of 
view. 
There is one thing we can agree on. 
There is real danger that Speaker 
PELOSI’s bill is not going to pass. It is 
not going to pass today, and it may not 
pass tomorrow, and it may not pass in 
June. 
The second thing we can agree on is 
that our States and our cities have sus-
tained debt, and we can take off the 
handcuffs and allow the money we have 
already given them to try to help them 
repair that damage as we recover from 
this horrible pandemic. 
For that reason, I am going to ask 
for unanimous consent not that we 
pass the bill. I am going to ask in a 
second for unanimous consent that we 
just vote on my bill. We don’t vote 
enough around here. I came up here to 
deliberate and decide. I didn’t come up 
here to issue press releases and partici-
pate in delay and stultification. I want 
to do an honest day’s work for an hon-
est day’s pay. Instead, we want an hon-
est week’s pay for an honest day’s 
work. 
All I want to do is have a vote on my 
bill. If you don’t like it, you can chew 
it up, spit it out, step on it, and vote no 
in front of God and country. But if you 
like it, you can vote for it, and let’s be 
Senators again. 
For that reason, Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that, at a time to 
be determined by the majority leader 
in consultation with the Democratic 
leader, the Committee on Appropria-
tions be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 3608—that is my bill— 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. I further ask that 
there be 2 hours of debate—see, we will 
have plenty of debate—equally divided 
between the proponents and the oppo-
nents of the bill; and that upon the use 
or yielding back of that time, the Ken-
nedy substitute amendment No. 1581 be 
considered and agreed to, the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time, and the Senate vote on passage of 
the bill, as amended, with a 60-affirma-
tive-vote threshold for passage with no 
intervening action or debate; finally, if 
passed, that the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
Let my people vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, I appre-
ciate the comments and I respect the 
opinion of my colleague from Lou-
isiana. 
The coronavirus pandemic is a sig-
nificant and life-altering time in our 
Nation. Our country and our economy 
will never be the same. This is abso-
lutely a challenging time for every 
level of government. 
We continue to work together to try 
and help the small businesses and indi-
viduals that are hurting and to get our 
economy back open as soon as possible. 
This crisis was unprecedented, and 
Congress took bold action to stem the 
spread of the virus and save our econ-
omy. But if we are not careful, Con-
gress will create another, equally dev-
astating crisis down the road—a crisis 
of our own making. 
Our national debt and deficits—al-
ready at sustainable levels—have sky-
rocketed as Congress has spent almost 
$3 trillion to address this crisis. At 
some point, we need to start thinking 
about the impact this spending will 
have on our country’s financial future 
and the future of our children and our 
grandchildren. 
As I mentioned during my remarks 
last week, I appreciate the spirit of my 
colleague’s proposal and understand his 
desire to help his State. I know he 
cares as deeply for Louisiana as I do 
about Florida. I want to help States 
too, which is why I support maintain-
ing the existing restrictions tied to the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund that were in-
cluded in the CARES Act. While imper-
fect, 
the 
Coronavirus 
Relief 
Fund 
makes sure spending is for coronavirus 
response. 
Regardless of whether we are remov-
ing the existing guardrails or talking 
about completely new funding, both ac-
tions would result in a blank-check 
bailout for States. 
Let’s remember that we are talking 
about $150 billion. To put that in per-
spective, the median income per capita 
in Florida is about $30,000, and $150 bil-
lion will pay the total annual income 
for more than 5 million Floridians. 
Let’s talk about who we are bailing 
out. It is not those on unemployment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2395 
May 13, 2020 
We took care of them in the CARES 
Act. It is not our teachers. We took 
care of them in the CARES Act. It is 
not our healthcare workers. We took 
care of them in the CARES Act. We are 
bailing out liberal politicians who can-
not live within their means, and now 
we are asking Floridians to pay for the 
incompetency of Governors like An-
drew Cuomo. 
We can’t give hard-earned taxpayer 
money to poorly managed States that 
are going to turn around and spend it 
on their liberal priorities and to back-
fill their budget shortfalls and solve 
their longstanding fiscal problems. 
States like California, Illinois, and 
New York have big budgets, high taxes, 
and tons of debt because they refused 
to make the hard choices and live with-
in their means. They know they cannot 
tax their citizens more. So now they 
have their hands out to the Federal 
taxpayers to rescue them. But that is 
not fair to citizens of States like Flor-
ida, where we made the hard choices. 
Let me show you this chart. From 
1985 to 2018, this is how many people 
moved to Florida from other States. 
We gained over 2 million people. This is 
how many people left New York, Illi-
nois, and California. 
Why did they leave? Partially, be-
cause they may like our weather bet-
ter. But look at the tax rates. They are 
way higher in these States. Look at 
their business climate. Those three 
States are the three worst in the coun-
try. Look at what the Tax Foundation 
ranking is—some of the worst States in 
the country. 
Then look at the debt. We have more 
people than New York by about 2 to 3 
million people, and their debt is seven 
times as much. As for Illinois, we are 
at least double, and they have almost 
three times as much debt. 
You look at this, and this is why in-
come is moving to our State and away 
from these States. Now these States 
want us to tax our citizens to pay for 
their debt, their pensions, for all of 
their fiscal irresponsibility, and that is 
not fair to the citizens of our State. 
When I became Florida’s Governor in 
2011, we had a big budget shortfall, and 
we had lost 832,000 jobs in 4 years. 
When I became Governor, we started 
cutting taxes every year. We cut $10 
billion over 8 years. And guess what. 
Our revenues increased. The State 
went from losing hundreds of thou-
sands of jobs over 4 years to adding 1.7 
million jobs in 8 years. We turned a $2.5 
billion shortfall into a $4 billion sur-
plus, with $3 billion in a rainy day 
fund. 
I was the first Florida Governor in 20 
years to actually pay down State debt. 
I paid down—with the support of my 
legislature and the success of our 
State—one-third of our State debt in 8 
years. 
That didn’t happen in California. It 
didn’t happen in Illinois, and it didn’t 
happen in New York. 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo 
said it was irresponsible and reckless 
not to bail out States like his—a State 
with 2 million fewer people than Flor-
ida, with a budget almost double ours. 
The opposite is true. It is irresponsible 
and reckless to take money from 
America’s taxpayers and use it to save 
liberal 
politicians 
from 
the 
con-
sequences of their poor choices. 
Every day, American families make 
responsible budgetary decisions. Well- 
managed States like Florida have done 
it for years. It is time for New York, Il-
linois, and California to do the same. 
As you can see from this chart, Con-
gress has already allocated billions of 
dollars in direct and indirect aid to 
States and localities. Total direct 
funding from the Federal Government 
already exceeds over $1 trillion, and 
this doesn’t begin to count another $1.3 
trillion in indirect assistance to small 
businesses, individuals, and increased 
unemployment benefits to families in 
all of our States. 
We have $150 billion. Again, it is bil-
lions of dollars for expenses. By the 
way, this is not the way it is done with 
FEMA. This money has been sent with 
no obligation of the States to pay a 
portion. When I had my hurricanes, I 
had to pay a portion of the cost that 
the Federal government would partici-
pate in, but we still paid a part of the 
cost. 
We have $500 billion in short-term 
loans for municipal governments; $45 
billion in FEMA disaster funds; $30 bil-
lion for education, without knowing 
whether education costs went up or 
down; $34 billion for mass transit com-
munity grants; $270 billion under the 
appropriations, on top of the indirect 
funding. So we have not ‘‘not sent’’ a 
lot of money to the States already. 
I appreciate that the Senator from 
Louisiana is seeking a vote on this pro-
posal. However, this legislation has not 
been considered by any committee. Al-
though I think we both agree that the 
CARES Act was far from perfect, Con-
gress must work methodically before 
we make large-scale changes such as 
those proposed by my colleague. 
We have to get absolutely serious 
about how we are spending taxpayer 
money and the fact that this year’s 
Federal budget deficit will be the larg-
est in the history of our Nation. 
I have seven grandchildren. Four of 
them 
are 
watching 
here 
today: 
Auguste, Eli, Quinton and Sebastian. I 
have no interest in saddling them or 
children like them across the country 
with mountains of debt. To do so would 
not only be a political failure; it would 
be an abdication of our moral responsi-
bility. 
It is time that we make the hard 
choices to put our Nation on a path to 
recovery—recovery from this virus, 
from the economic devastation it has 
brought with it, and from the fiscal ca-
lamity that decades of politicians have 
ignored. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
this fight to keep our country’s future 
bright. 
I, therefore, respectfully object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I come 
here to speak on a different topic, but 
I want to simply comment for a mo-
ment on the exchange between my 
friend from Louisiana and my friend 
from Florida. 
I can assure my friend from Lou-
isiana who was ranked the best man-
aged State in America by an inde-
pendent source, Governing Magazine— 
the 
Commonwealth 
of 
Virginia—at 
least during my tenure as Governor. 
We are also proud to be ranked by 
Forbes Magazine the best State for 
business. 
I have looked at the bill of the Sen-
ator from Louisiana. It may not be per-
fect. I actually think we should be vot-
ing on it. I think it is a bit strange to 
me, and I say this as somebody from 
Virginia, where I am very proud of the 
fact that we have maintained a AAA 
bond rating. We are fiscally respon-
sible. Our fiscal health, I would wager, 
is candidly better than virtually every 
other State in the country. We made 
the hard choices to make that happen. 
When we say that we are going to 
come in and bail out the airlines be-
cause they have lost revenues and we 
are going to come in and very gener-
ously take care of every small business 
when they have lost revenues, but 
when States and localities across the 
country are losing revenues at a record 
rate, to say we are not going to give 
them certain flexibility—I would con-
cur, if we had a bill like that, and I 
would even put a clause and support a 
clause in place that would say let’s 
prohibit any of those funds being used 
to take care of long-term obligations 
like pension funds. But the notion that 
somehow we are going to say we are 
going to take care of everybody else 
who lost revenues but we are not going 
to take care of a local government that 
has seen its meals tax dry up, its lodg-
ing tax dry up, its sales tax dry up, and 
you suddenly are on your own and you 
have to lay off police officers and fire-
fighters and EMTs at this moment in 
time, it doesn’t make sense to me. I 
hope the Senator will continue to press 
his case and we will get a chance to 
have that debate. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, I rise today because 
we also face the greatest unemploy-
ment crisis America has seen since the 
Great Depression. More than 33 million 
workers have lost their jobs due to the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Millions 
of 
these folks have also lost their health 
insurance. I was just reading that 27 
million Americans have seen their 
health insurance lost due to the virus. 
The Federal Reserve actually forecasts 
that 47 million Americans, or nearly 
one-third of the workforce, could lose 
their jobs. 
These aren’t just numbers. They rep-
resent the pain being felt by families 
across the country, as we enter into 
the greatest economic crisis of our life-
time. Candidly, we need to face some

May 13, 2020 
hard truths about how we got here and 
what will come next if we fail to act. 
The reason we are facing this dire 
economic crisis is simple: The Federal 
Government failed to take the appro-
priate early actions to control this 
virus. 
That is why we have had to do social 
distancing. Social distancing isn’t very 
much fun. I see some of my friends and 
colleagues on the floor. It is particu-
larly hard for people who spend their 
lifetime shaking hands and saying 
hello to folks. It has been tough on all 
of us. But it has saved lives, and it has 
begun to flatten the curve. 
We also know that things can’t just 
go back to normal overnight—not be-
fore we have a vaccine, not before the 
government, working in concert with 
the private sector, solves the chronic 
shortages in testing and in PPE that 
have hampered our response to this 
pandemic from day one. 
States like mine are working toward 
a new normal where we gradually scale 
back social distancing, when it is safe 
to do so, but it is just not realistic to 
suggest, as the President has, that we 
can just immediately reopen the econ-
omy before we have contained the 
virus—as if companies will just simply 
resume normal business, knowing that 
another coronavirus outbreak could 
shut them down any day, as if a virus 
for which we still don’t have a vaccine 
didn’t just kill more than 80,000 of our 
fellow Americans. 
It is time to face the facts, about 
what it will take for our economy to 
recover from this public health crisis. 
There is not a magic switch that we 
can just flip. Unfortunately, there will 
not be a V-shaped recovery if we stay 
on our current course. Just as it took 
the U.S. years to emerge from the 
Great Depression, it could take years, 
or even decades, to recover from the 
coronavirus if we do not take imme-
diate, 
bold 
action 
in 
the 
next 
coronavirus relief bill. 
Our first goal must be to prevent fur-
ther job losses, as well as permanent 
disruptions like business closures, evic-
tions, and foreclosures. 
Second, we must work quickly to re-
duce the economic uncertainty facing 
workers and small businesses. To do 
this, we need to provide immediate as-
sistance to millions of American work-
ers who have gone overnight from a 
steady job to unemployment through 
no fault of their own. 
I am not talking about another stim-
ulus check. I am not talking about un-
employment benefits. I am talking 
about paychecks. The proposal, which I 
put forward with Senator SANDERS, 
Senator 
JONES, 
and 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL would create a national 
paycheck security program for Amer-
ican workers. A very similar proposal 
has been put forward by my friend on 
the other side of the aisle, Senator 
HAWLEY from Missouri. It uses a direct 
support model that has support on both 
the left and the right. As a matter of 
fact, the New York Times and the Wall 
Street Journal have both commented 
on it. We know those news organiza-
tions never agree on anything, but they 
both take this approach. It bears 
merit. We also know this direct sup-
port approach works because it has 
been implemented successfully in a 
number of European countries and in 
Canada, 
where 
the 
unemployment 
rates, yes, have bumped up by a couple 
of points but not to the level of what, 
I believe, will be over 20 percent unem-
ployment and what the Fed and even 
the administration officials have pre-
dicted may reach 25 percent within the 
next month. 
Paycheck security means the Federal 
Government would help to cover the 
payroll 
expenses 
for 
rank-and-file 
workers who have been furloughed or 
laid off because of the coronavirus. 
These Treasury Department grants 
would cover salaries and wages up to 
$90,000 for each employee, plus benefits, 
and would run for at least 6 months. 
They would also provide funds to many 
businesses to help cover business oper-
ating costs, such as rent and utilities. 
The program would be delivered 
through the employee retention tax 
credit, which is something on which I 
was happy to work with my friend from 
Oregon in the earlier coronavirus bill. 
It is already set up at the IRS and can 
be leveraged to deliver far greater ben-
efits than it currently provides. 
In exchange for the paycheck secu-
rity grant, employers would commit to 
forgoing further layoffs and to main-
taining the pay and benefits of their 
rank-and-file workers. They would also 
be required to suspend stock buybacks 
and limit CEO compensation for at 
least the term of Federal assistance. 
A national paycheck security pro-
gram would immediately work to pre-
vent financial calamity for millions 
and millions of American families. At 
the same time, it would maintain and, 
in many cases, reestablish that critical 
link between workers and their em-
ployees. The reestablishment of that 
link would put in place the healthcare 
benefits that many workers receive 
through their employment that they 
have now lost even though they may be 
on generous unemployment. If we rees-
tablish this connection, the economy 
will be able to bounce back much more 
quickly after the public health crisis 
ends. The certainty provided by this 
program would also give consumers the 
confidence they need to begin spending 
money in the economy, which would 
accelerate the eventual economic re-
covery. 
It will be expensive. Yet I can say 
this: As someone who has spent a long 
time thinking about and working on 
trying to reduce the deficit, when we 
compare it to the over $660 billion 
spent on the PPP program, which has 
only taken up one section of our econ-
omy—businesses under 500—but has 
done nothing so far for those mid-level 
businesses—500 to 10,000—I think the 
alternative will actually be viewed as 
being much cheaper. It would actually 
be pennies compared to the damage 
that will be done if we fail to ade-
quately assist our fellow Americans in 
this moment of economic crisis. 
I am pleased that my colleagues in 
the House have put forward an initial 
draft 
of 
their 
view 
of 
the 
next 
coronavirus relief package. It has a 
number of important provisions. How-
ever, it has not taken what I believe is 
the bold step of saying, before we sim-
ply refill some of the existing buck-
ets—which have had, in many cases, 
mixed 
results 
so 
far—perhaps 
we 
should take a pause and a timeout and 
ask: Is there not a better way to pro-
vide the kind of security and guarantee 
that the American people are looking 
for from their government? 
The one thing I do know is that my 
House colleagues and I share an enor-
mous sense of urgency. With, at least, 
the official number of unemployment 
being at nearly 15 percent—a number 
that all of us expect to go over 20 per-
cent when it is reported later this 
month—this is not the time to play 
wait and see. It is no exaggeration to 
say that we face the prospect of having 
not a recession but of having, actually, 
a great depression. With every day we 
delay, we drive ourselves deeper and 
deeper into the hole that we must 
eventually climb out of when the 
healthcare crisis is behind us. 
As we enter into negotiations over 
the next phase of the coronavirus re-
sponse, I would encourage my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
take a look at bold solutions. Let’s 
give our fellow Americans the kind of 
paycheck security they deserve. Let’s 
put paychecks, not stimulus checks, in 
their hands. Let’s help them get back 
to work as fast and as safely we are 
able. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
H.R. 6172 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, Ameri-
cans want their privacy protected. For 
far too long, the Patriot Act and the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 
commonly referred to as FISA, have 
been used to trample the civil liberties 
of American citizens. For Montanans, 
the right to privacy is so fundamental 
that it is enshrined in our own con-
stitution. In fact, very few States have 
such protections, but the drafters of 
the Montana Constitution recognized 
that privacy was essential to exer-
cising all of the other freedoms that we 
hold so dear. 
The bill the U.S. House has sent us 
does have some good reforms, and it 
has some good provisions in it, includ-
ing a provision from my bipartisan bill 
with my colleague from Oregon, Sen-
ator WYDEN, called the Safeguarding 
Americans’ Private Records Act, which 
would revoke the now terminated call 
detail record program, which secretly 
collected data on our cell phones and 
our land lines, as well as on our private 
conversations. Yet the House bill fails 
to enact real reforms to FISA that will

actually protect the privacy of the 
American people. We saw what a hand-
ful of scornful government bureaucrats 
did to President Trump when they 
abused FISA to serve their political 
motives. Our own government spied on 
an American citizen—a political ad-
viser to then-Candidate Trump—with 
no oversight. 
What happened to President Trump 
can happen to anybody for any pur-
pose, and that is a very serious prob-
lem. Republican or Democrat, we can’t 
allow the abuse of our government in-
telligence services to be used for polit-
ical attacks. It puts our democracy in 
danger, and it undermines the trust 
and the confidence that our citizens 
place in these same institutions that 
are meant to protect them. 
The House bill fails to prohibit the 
warrantless searches of browsing data 
in internet search history, and it fails 
to include any meaningful oversight 
and accountability. We need to get gov-
ernment out of our private lives and, 
instead, prioritize freedom and privacy. 
We can and must protect our national 
security and protect our civil liberties 
by making targeted reforms that will 
keep everyday Americans’ privacy se-
cure and continue to allow the govern-
ment to go after the bad guys. The 
House bill does not go far enough, and 
we cannot compromise on an issue that 
is so vital to the very foundations of 
our government. 
Montanans sent me to Congress to 
get government off their backs, and I 
am working not only to get govern-
ment off their backs but to get govern-
ment out of their phones, out of their 
computers, and out of their private 
lives. At the end of the day, this is 
about protecting privacy, and today, 
this day, we have the opportunity to 
get these reforms right. I have been 
working on behalf of Montanans, with 
my Senate colleagues across the aisle, 
to ensure we take a very bipartisan ap-
proach to this issue. 
In speaking on the Wyden-Daines 
amendment we will be voting on short-
ly, my bipartisan amendment is sim-
ple. It protects all Americans’ civil lib-
erties by prohibiting the collection of 
browser data and internet search his-
tory under section 215 of the Patriot 
Act. Browser data is some of the most 
personal and revealing information 
that can be collected on private citi-
zens. Your internet search history can 
reveal extremely intimate information, 
including personal health data, reli-
gious beliefs, political beliefs, where 
you might go on your next vacation, 
even what you bought for your mom 
this past Mother’s Day. I don’t think 
the government should have access to 
such private information without a 
warrant. Section 215 of the Patriot Act 
is supposed to investigate potential 
terrorists, not spy on our own Ameri-
cans’ browser data. 
Let me be clear. My amendment 
doesn’t stop the intelligence commu-
nity from doing its job. I am grateful 
for our intelligence community, and it 
doesn’t prevent it from doing its job or 
from accessing the data it needs to 
keep Americans safe. It simply re-
quires our intelligence agencies to 
abide by the Constitution and work 
within our Nation’s laws, which means 
requesting a probable cause warrant to 
get this type of information. That 
means they might have to go to a judge 
and prove they have a valid reason to 
believe that someone is involved in es-
pionage or in a possible terrorism oper-
ation. Without my bipartisan amend-
ment, the government will be able to 
access browser data through the secret 
215 spy program with little to no over-
sight. 
At the end of the day, this is about 
securing 
our 
most 
basic 
Fourth 
Amendment rights, to protect our citi-
zens’ most personal data. In fact, re-
cently, the Supreme Court found in the 
Carpenter decision that the govern-
ment needed a warrant to access cell 
site location data because of how per-
sonal and invasive that information is. 
The current House bill before us does 
have a prohibition for the collection of 
cell site location data under section 
215, and that is a good thing. My 
amendment simply extends this prohi-
bition to include browser data and 
internet search history, which is even 
more sensitive and personal than loca-
tion data. 
I agree with many of my colleagues 
that we need to have the tools in place 
to help find and stop our Nation’s en-
emies, those who seek to harm Amer-
ica. We all agree on that, but we also 
need to make sure we are protecting 
Americans from our own government’s 
spying and intervening in our personal 
lives. My amendment balances these 
important civil liberties and our na-
tional security by allowing the govern-
ment to track down terrorists while 
also stopping them from violating the 
rights of law-abiding citizens. 
This is not a zero-sum game. We can 
have both. This amendment has strong 
bipartisan support. Senator WYDEN and 
I have been working on this issue for 
months, and we are joined by a long 
list of bipartisan cosponsors, including 
Republican Senators LEE, BRAUN, and 
CRAMER, as well as by Democratic Sen-
ators LEAHY, UDALL, MARKEY, and 
many more. The amendment is also 
supported by a diverse group of stake-
holders across the political spectrum, 
from FreedomWorks and Americans for 
Prosperity on one end to the ACLU and 
Demand Progress on the other. Ameri-
cans across the country overwhelm-
ingly back this amendment. 
This is a core constitutional issue 
that brought a Democrat from Oregon 
together with a Republican from Mon-
tana. Montanans and Oregonians may 
have different priorities, but we all be-
lieve strongly in the right to privacy, 
in protecting our civil liberties, and in 
preserving our American way of life. I 
urge my Senate colleagues to stand 
with Senator WYDEN and me to protect 
the privacy of all Americans, and I 
urge them to vote in favor of this 
amendment. 
Before I yield to Senator WYDEN, I 
will also take a minute to speak in sup-
port of the Lee-Leahy amendment. 
This bipartisan amendment strength-
ens and clarifies the role and the au-
thority of the amici in the FISA court. 
Unfortunately, we continue to see seri-
ous abuses and misuse of the FISA 
process. Most notably, the Department 
of Justice’s inspector general found 
major abuses in applications to surveil 
President Trump’s campaign adviser 
Carter Page. This abuse is just the tip 
of the iceberg. 
We need serious reforms that protect 
American citizens from government 
surveillance, 
and 
the 
Lee-Leahy 
amendment does just that. It gives 
Americans a fighting chance and brings 
some clarity and, importantly, some 
transparency to the FISA court. I en-
courage my colleagues to also join me 
in supporting this Lee-Leahy amend-
ment. 
I see that my distinguished colleague 
and friend, the Senator from Oregon, 
RON WYDEN, is on the floor. 
I yield to Senator WYDEN for his re-
marks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1583 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I call up 
amendment No. 1583. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Oregon [Mr. WYDEN] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 1583. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the reading of 
the amendment be dispensed with. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To remove internet website brows-
ing information and search history from 
scope of authority to access certain busi-
ness records for foreign intelligence and 
international terrorism investigations) 
On page 7, strike lines 13 and 14 and insert 
the following: 
cell site location or global positioning sys-
tem information. 
‘‘(C) An application under paragraph (1) 
may not seek an order authorizing or requir-
ing the production of internet website brows-
ing information or internet search history 
information.’’. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleague from Montana for our 
work on this effort, and I hope we can 
count on strong support from his cau-
cus, the Senate majority, when we vote 
in a little bit. 
I rise to offer this bipartisan amend-
ment because I think a basic question 
needs to be asked at this unique time: 
Is it right, when millions of law-abid-
ing Americans are at home, for their 
government to be able to spy on their 
internet searches and their web brows-
ing without its having a warrant? 
Should law-abiding Americans have to 
worry about their government’s look-
ing over their shoulders from the mo-
ment they wake up in the morning and 
turn on their computers to when they

May 13, 2020 
go to bed at night? I believe the answer 
is no, but that is exactly what the gov-
ernment has the power to do without 
this bipartisan amendment. 
I start by reflecting for a moment on 
how Americans are using the internet 
these days. They are helping kids with 
homework, checking out prescription 
drug prices for a sick parent, and vis-
iting scores of different websites. In a 
pandemic, the internet may be their 
only connection to the outside world. 
So the questions we are presenting 
are, Don’t those Americans deserve 
some measure of privacy? Don’t they 
deserve better than their government’s 
snooping into the websites they visit? 
How can this be that the government 
can spy on them when they are not sus-
pected of doing anything wrong? Most 
importantly, how is this OK in Amer-
ica? 
With web browsing and searches, you 
are talking about some of the most in-
timate, some of the most personal, 
some of the most private details of the 
lives of Americans. Every thought that 
can come into people’s heads can be re-
vealed in an internet search or in a 
visit to a website: their health his-
tories, their medical fears, their polit-
ical views, their romantic lives, their 
religious beliefs. Collecting this infor-
mation is as close to reading minds as 
surveillance can get. It is the digital 
mining of the personal lives of the 
American people. 
Now, typical Americans may think 
to themselves: I have nothing to worry 
about. I have done nothing wrong. The 
government has no reason to suspect 
me of anything. Why do I need to 
worry? 
Unfortunately, the question is not 
whether you did anything wrong. The 
question is whether government agents 
believe they have the right to look at 
your web searches. In other words, 
without this bipartisan amendment, it 
is open season on anybody’s most per-
sonal information. 
Now, there is a simple solution: re-
quire a warrant. With this amendment, 
the government can go to court and, 
with a warrant, collect whatever it 
needs from those who actually threat-
en the safety of our people. In an emer-
gency—something I feel very strongly 
about and worked for as a member of 
the Intelligence Committee—the Gov-
ernment can use emergency provisions, 
collect the information immediately, 
and settle up with the court later, 
proving once again that liberty and se-
curity are not mutually exclusive. This 
type of amendment helps to get you 
both. 
Now I will give a brief explanation of 
how we got here. Right now the Gov-
ernment can collect web browsing and 
internet search history without a war-
rant under section 215 of the PATRIOT 
Act. Section 215, from the beginning, 
has been the most controversial and 
dangerous provision of the FISA law. 
That is because it is so extraordinarily 
broad and so vague. Under section 215, 
the Government can collect just about 
anything, as long as the Government 
believes it is relevant to an investiga-
tion. This can include the private lives 
of many innocent, law-abiding Ameri-
cans. As I indicated, they don’t have to 
do anything wrong. They don’t have to 
be suspected of anything. They don’t 
even have to have been in contact with 
anyone suspected of anything. Their 
personal information in some way just 
has to be connected for relevance to 
what the Government is looking for. 
Back in 2001, when Congress passed 
the PATRIOT Act, Americans were 
rightly concerned about their Govern-
ment collecting their library borrowing 
records without a warrant. My col-
leagues 
and 
the 
Presiding 
Officer 
might remember it because this was 
nationwide. People were up in arms 
about the prospect of the Government 
looking at library records of books 
they borrowed and the like. 
Well, I will state that what we are 
talking about today—looking at web 
history, browsing—it is thousands of 
times more invasive of privacy than 
the library records Americans were 
concerned about years ago. 
There is, regrettably, a long history 
of abuse of section 215. A few years ago, 
the Government decided it could use 
section 215 to justify the collection of 
every American’s phone records. The 
Government 
secretly 
decided 
that 
phone records of millions of innocent 
law-abiding Americans were, again, 
somehow connected, somehow relevant 
to something the Government wanted. 
They wanted to get it without a war-
rant. It was only when this abuse was 
publicly 
revealed 
that 
Congress 
stepped in and began reining in the 
Government’s phone record collection. 
The Supreme Court did determine re-
cently that physical tracking of Ameri-
cans as they move around requires a 
warrant. In this bill, Congress is finally 
getting around to stopping the Govern-
ment from using section 215 to conduct 
warrantless collections of certain loca-
tion data. The irony is—and I say this 
to my colleagues because of this unique 
time—that now that Americans have 
been asked to stay home and not move 
around so as to help our country fight 
this unprecedented contagion, they are 
more vulnerable to abusive surveil-
lance than ever before. I think that is 
wrong. 
Whether they are in North Dakota, 
Washington State, Montana, Oregon, 
or in any of our home States, people 
are at home and they are living their 
lives online. Now more than ever I 
would say to Senators of both political 
parties—because I have long felt that 
these issues were fundamental to en-
suring that we prove, as I stated ear-
lier, that liberty and security are not 
mutually exclusive—that smart poli-
cies give you both, and not-so-smart 
policies don’t give you either. During 
this pandemic, Americans deserve as-
surances that the Government isn’t 
spying on them as they are home, 
where they think they are going to 
have some measure of privacy, and, 
probably, until they heard this debate, 
didn’t know the Government could spy 
on them at home while they move 
around the internet. 
Americans deserve to know at this 
unique time that the Government does 
not engage in digital tracking of their 
personal lives. The warrantless collec-
tion of Americans’ web browsing his-
tory offers endless opportunities for 
abuse. 
Donald Trump has called for an in-
vestigation of his political enemies. 
Attorney General Barr has injected 
himself into investigations that affect 
the 
personal 
interests 
of 
Donald 
Trump. All it would take is some inno-
cent American’s web browsing history 
to be deemed relevant to an investiga-
tion, and the Government is off to the 
races, collecting all of that personal in-
formation. Then, it wouldn’t even mat-
ter whether that web browsing history 
had anything to do with the original 
goal of the investigation. For any num-
ber of reasons, the web browsing his-
tory of that innocent American could 
reveal, potentially, such embarrassing 
information that the person would be 
humiliated—humiliated—for years to 
come and, of course, it can be used 
against him or her. 
This is not a partisan proposition. 
Any administration given the direction 
of the law absent this amendment 
could be tempted to collect the web 
browsing and internet search history of 
political enemies—politicians, activ-
ists, journalists. 
Just before I wrap up, I am going to 
touch on some of the arguments 
against this amendment, because hav-
ing served on the Intelligence Com-
mittee and having followed these issues 
closely, invariably, at some point in 
this discussion, someone is going to 
come and say: This bipartisan amend-
ment is going to be pretty much the 
end of Western civilization as we know 
it. We are not going to be safe. It is not 
going to protect our liberties. It is 
going to set up arbitrary policies. 
I want to show how these arguments 
don’t hold water. The first argument is 
that the Government needs this infor-
mation before it can get a warrant. But 
without web browsing history, there is 
still plenty of information available to 
the Government, even without a war-
rant—phone and email data, subscrip-
tion data, business records. The biggest 
response to this argument is that it is 
Congress’s responsibility to determine 
when some information is so sensitive 
that it requires a warrant. In this bill 
that 
was 
done 
with 
respect 
to 
geolocation information. I believe that 
digital tracking of innocent Americans 
demands the same protection. 
Let me say, as I did earlier, when 
there is an emergency, something that 
I have made a priority in my work on 
the Intelligence Committee, the gov-
ernment can go get the information 
immediately and then come back to 
the court later on and settle up. 
The other argument that I imagine 
we will hear is that this amendment

May 13, 2020 
will create protections for Americans 
that don’t exist in the criminal con-
text. The problem with that argument 
is that Congress isn’t legislating on the 
criminal law right now, but it does 
have a unique opportunity to prevent 
intrusive surveillance of Americans to 
prevent abuses. 
FISA requires an extra layer of pro-
tection. That is because, unlike crimi-
nal law, FISA is secret. It is also a non-
adversarial process. It relies on Gov-
ernment representations that we have 
learned, from the inspector general, are 
frequently inaccurate. When the Gov-
ernment 
uses 
FISA 
information 
against Americans, there is little or no 
notice or opportunity to challenge the 
surveillance. 
Most of all, it is subject to something 
that I have come to call ‘‘secret law.’’ 
It is a law that nobody knows about in 
a coffee shop in Washington, North Da-
kota, or Montana. It is basically se-
cretly interpreted. As I pointed out on 
the floor in the past, warning the 
American people about these secret in-
terpretations, 
Americans 
sometimes 
don’t learn about them for years, and 
when they find out, they are really un-
happy. 
So I want to touch briefly on the 
amendment of the Senate majority 
leader, the McConnell amendment. Not 
only is the majority leader trying to 
block the bipartisan effort that we 
have been talking about, but his 
amendment would actually make the 
situation even worse. Right now the 
Government can collect web browsing 
internet searches of Americans without 
a warrant under section 215, but so far 
there has not been explicit congres-
sional authorization for the Govern-
ment to do it. The McConnell amend-
ment would, for the first time, provide 
that 
authorization. 
The 
McConnell 
amendment would, in effect, tell the 
Government that Congress approves of 
the warrantless collection of Ameri-
cans’ most private information. Wrap 
your arms around that one—Congress 
explicitly approving of the warrantless 
collection of Americans’ most private 
information when millions of Ameri-
cans are sitting at home today in Kan-
sas, South Dakota, and all across the 
country, sitting at home believing that 
they have some expectation of privacy. 
The McConnell amendment pretends 
to limit the collection of this personal 
information of Americans, but it is just 
a fake. What the amendment really 
does is meaningless, since the Govern-
ment cannot collect content. But no 
one knows what that means when it 
comes to web browsing and internet 
search history. There is no clarity in 
the statute. There is no settled law in 
the courts. The Supreme Court has not 
weighed 
in. 
What 
the 
McConnell 
amendment does is invite the Attorney 
General to produce yet more secret 
law, yet another secret interpretation, 
designed, as these things always are, to 
allow for the collection of the broadest 
set of Americans’ most private infor-
mation. 
At some point, I believe the Senate 
needs to focus on a little bit of history. 
Section 215 was secretly interpreted 
and abused in the past. The use of 
these authorities to spy on Americans’ 
web browsing and search history is a 
screaming alarm, warning us of future 
abuses. What the American people de-
serve and what this amendment pro-
vides is clarity and transparency about 
what the government cannot collect 
without a warrant. 
One last argument is that we have 
heard that, if the Senate amends this 
bill, oh, my goodness, the House just 
will not do anything at all. Well, there 
were 75 House Democrats and many Re-
publicans—I want to underline that, 75 
House Democrats and many Repub-
licans—who voted against this bill be-
cause it didn’t include enough privacy 
reform. Adding key reforms like this 
amendment could only strengthen its 
support in the House. 
Americans 
will 
not 
tolerate 
warrantless 
Government 
spying 
on 
their most private information when 
they find out—when they find out that 
right now, during a pandemic, the Gov-
ernment has the authority to do that. 
I can’t accept that level of unchecked 
surveillance. 
I am very grateful for the sponsors 
that we have. They were listed by my 
colleague from Montana.

Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will 
state that I think right now, during a 
unique time in American history when 
millions of Americans are at home and 
on line, they deserve to have the U.S. 
Senate step up, defend their privacy 
and constitutional rights, and protect 
them from abuses. This is the moment 
to stand up for those millions of people 
who have to be at home because we 
come together to deal with this con-
tagion. 
I believe the Senate ought to pass the 
Wyden-Daines amendment and oppose 
the McConnell amendment to protect 
those people at home. In wrapping up, 
I also want to commend our friends 
Senators LEAHY and LEE. As was noted, 
they have worked with us on a host of 
these efforts. I think they have a ter-
rific amendment to strengthen the 
oversight role of the independent amici 
of the FISA Court. I hope Senators will 
also support it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
amendment is about protecting Amer-
ican privacy, about making sure that 
Government is not intruding on our 
most private data. It is about respect-
ing the Constitution and the Fourth 
Amendment. 
The 
Wyden-Daines 
amendment simply prohibits the col-
lection of browser and search history 
data under section 215. Browser data is 
extremely 
personal, 
sensitive, 
and 
should require a probable cause war-
rant to access. This data shouldn’t be 
allowed to be collected behind closed 
doors with no traditional oversight. 
We can protect national security and 
protect the civil liberties and the con-
stitutional rights of Americans at the 
same time. It is plain and simple. If 
you want to see an American’s search 
history, than you better go to a judge 
and get a warrant. 
I yield the floor. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1583 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
Mr. BARRASSO. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk called the roll.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, count-
less Utahns have stepped up to serve 
our State and country during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Their actions are 
inspiring, and they help save lives. I 
rise today to recognize some of these 
great efforts. I prefer to name individ-
uals 
and 
their 
particular 
cir-
cumstances, but because of the tens of 
thousands—even 
hundreds 
of 
thou-
sands—of people who participated, I am 
going to talk about groups and organi-
zations. 
Healthcare workers from our State 
travel across our State and also across 
our country. Intermountain Healthcare 
deployed two 100-person response teams 
to New York City hospitals to help 
handle the surge of patients there. 
Physicians, nurses, respiratory thera-
pists, and other healthcare profes-
sionals were there for weeks, often-
times 24-hour days. 
In partnership with Intermountain, 
University of Utah Health ramped up 
the State’s lab services, medication 
trials, and testing capacity, including 
the HERO project, which has tested 
more than 10,000 Utahns to assess the 
disease spread throughout the State. 
The university’s Wellness Bus brought 
mobile testing to underserved areas 
across our State. Groups around cam-
puses are using 3–D printers to produce 
hundreds of face shields per day for the 
healthcare community. 
The businesses of Silicon Slopes have 
helped expand State testing efforts 
through the ‘‘Test Utah Challenge.’’ 
Tens of thousands have been tested 
through this program. The Utah Manu-
facturers Association and its member-
ship and its businesses have spear-
headed the effort to provide a mask, 
free of charge, to every citizen of our 
State. 
The World Trade Center Utah has 
partnered with my team to help make 
sure that local employers are able to 
access small business loans and other 
Federal relief programs. 
The Utah Food Bank is using mobile 
pantries to safely distribute food on a 
regular basis throughout the State and 
is teaming up with organizations like 
the Larry H. Miller Group to host 
statewide food drives. 
The Utah Farm Bureau has pur-
chased food from local farmers and has 
then helped to distribute it to families 
in need. 
Project Protect, in partnership with 
Intermountain, 
University 
of 
Utah 
Health, and Latter-day Saint Charities, 
has produced face shields, masks, and 
gowns for frontline caregivers through-
out the State. To date, more than 
30,000 volunteers have sewn more than 
3 million masks. 
These are just some of the many ex-
traordinary organizations and individ-
uals that have come together to help 
their neighbors. Our State’s pioneering 
heritage is a big part of what makes 
Utah a model of what we can do when 
we work together as a community. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that, at 4:15 p.m. 
today, the Senate vote in relation to 
the Lee amendment, if offered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I yield 
the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to recognize 
this month of May as National Foster 
Care Month. In 1988, President Reagan 
brought attention to the importance of 
foster care. He first designated the 
month of May as a time to celebrate 
and remember all of those people in 
foster care, including foster parents, 
caseworkers, and others who work to 
improve the lives of those in care. 
We made some progress since that 
time with legislation, such as the Fos-
tering Connections Act of 2008 and the 
Child and Family Services Improve-
ment and Innovation Act of 2011. We 
provided new investments and services 
to improve the outcomes for children 
in the foster care system. 
More recently, in 2018, Congress 
passed the Family First Prevention 
Services Act. That legislation, passed 
in 2018, changed the way Federal reim-
bursement for foster care works, allow-
ing States to provide services to par-
ents before their kids are placed into 
foster care, not just after they go into 
foster care. It also ensures more kids 
will be cared for by a family, instead of 
being placed in a group setting outside 
the home. Last year, I introduced and 
Congress passed the Family First Tran-
sition Act to help States get moving to 
this new system and do it more quick-
ly. 
A lot has changed since President 
Reagan first announced this month of 
May as National Foster Care Month, 
but one thing hasn’t changed, and that 
is the tireless work of one Iowan in 
particular that I want to recognize 
today: Linda Faye Herring, of Johnson 
County, IA. 
Linda started serving as a foster par-
ent in the 1970s, at least a decade be-
fore President Reagan recognized the 
importance of highlighting foster care. 
Over the course of almost 50 years, 
Linda has fostered over 600 kids. Over 
600 kids in need of a place to call home, 
even if for a few days, were welcome in 
Linda’s home. Just think of how many 
lives just one person, Linda, was able 
to impact by making the decision to be 
a foster parent. It is not just that it is 
600, although that number is staggering 
enough. It is the birth parents of those 
children who, due to the help that they 
received from the foster care system, 
may have been able to treat their sub-
stance abuse and turn their lives 
around, to maybe be a mother or father 
to their children again. 
Also, this month honors all the par-
ents who were able to adopt children 
who temporarily stayed in Linda’s 
home. 
Linda has influenced her own family 
as well, because the family that she 
had continues her good work. It is this 
kind of example of selfless service that 
caused five of Linda’s children and 
three of her grandchildren to also be-
come foster parents. Foster parents de-
serve more recognition. They deserve 
more support, and even more services. 
I will continue to work here in the Sen-
ate to try to make these goals a re-
ality. 
If you have ever considered becoming 
a foster parent, this Senator urges you 
to take that first step and reach out to 
your local child welfare agencies and 
tell them you are interested in being a 
foster parent. There is a great need out 
there for that. 
Sometimes the numbers can seem 
overwhelming. There are over 400,000 
kids in foster care—some of them 
sleeping on the floor of their social 
worker’s office due to the lack of avail-
able homes to care for them. But Linda 
is proof that just one person can make 
an incredible impact.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2401 
May 13, 2020 
Over the years, I have heard from 
many kids in foster care. I make a spe-
cial effort to hear directly from them 
on what they think needs to be im-
proved about the system so future fos-
ter children can have a better life and 
a better future. Do you know what? 
After decades of being involved in this 
subject, I hear the same thing from 
them. They tell me: I would like to 
have a home. 
Why would they say they would like 
to have a home? They have been shift-
ed in a 1-year period of time to two or 
three different foster homes in two or 
three different school districts. They 
say that they want a mom and a dad 
for the same reason, because they 
could have had three or four different 
moms and dads within the year. They 
want to be a part of a family. Those are 
the things I hear from them. Whether 
it is the biological family getting the 
help they need to parent their children 
or whether it is a foster parent step-
ping up to the plate, kids belong in a 
family. All children deserve a safe, lov-
ing, permanent home. 
Unfortunately, the foster care sys-
tem has also been impacted by the 
virus that we have all been affected by 
in the last 4 or 5 months. Families who 
were already vulnerable were thrown 
into unemployment and instability. 
Children in temporary foster care 
placements are remaining there for a 
much longer time than usual, all be-
cause of canceled and delayed court 
proceedings, which makes staying in 
the foster home longer than getting 
into a permanent home. 
Foster parents, birth parents, and 
children in foster care, all lost access 
to peer networks and other vital sup-
port services because of the last 4 or 5 
months we have been dealing with this 
pandemic. 
Especially impacted at this time are 
older youth who have aged out of foster 
care. Youth in college lost their hous-
ing when campuses closed. Those who 
were training for a career or are in the 
workforce have lost their jobs as well. 
Many of the provisions in the CARES 
Act will help foster families and the 
youth generally who are in their care. 
However, I will continue to work to en-
sure that needy relief for kids and fam-
ilies is provided. I ask my colleagues in 
the Senate to support my resolution 
marking May as National Foster Care 
Month to bring awareness to the issues 
that kids in foster care face and to 
honor Linda of Johnson County, the 
one I used as an example, who helped 
600 kids—and not only Linda but all 
the other foster parents who make a 
world of difference. That is what this 
month is all about. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, over the 
last few weeks and months, Iowans 
from every corner and county of our 
State have faced unforeseen challenges 
and hardships as a result of the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
In trying times like these, the Amer-
ican people have always banded to-
gether and have risen to the occasion, 
and this pandemic is no different. This 
has been especially true in Iowa, where 
I have seen and heard so many heart-
warming stories of Iowans stepping up 
to help other Iowans. 
Take Ann and Megan, for example, 
two teachers in the Knoxville Commu-
nity School District. These two Iowans 
noticed that some of the residents at 
the West Ridge Specialty Care center 
might need some additional entertain-
ment due to social distancing. So they 
started an Amazon wish list and, with 
the help of their community, were able 
to provide games and other fun items 
for the residents to use during the day. 
Then, there are the hard-working 
folks at the Iowa Motor Truck Associa-
tion, who are helping to provide meals 
to our truckdrivers all up and down 
Interstate 80. 
And, of course, there are the great 
men and women of the Iowa National 
Guard, who are working around the 
clock to deliver medical supplies and 
materials across the State. 
It is not just individuals. It is also 
local Iowa companies and their work-
ers who are stepping up and helping 
out. Kent Corporation in Muscatine 
has been working closely with local 
nonprofit partners to address food inse-
curity for folks in their community. 
Partnering with the Salvation Army, 
United Way, and the Muscatine Center 
for Social Action, they are preparing 
nearly 300 meals every Wednesday and 
Thursday to be distributed to families 
and individuals who are in need. 
Folks, while we are facing chal-
lenging times, we have also been re-
minded of the generosity and charity of 
the men and women across our Nation 
and the tremendous courage and resil-
ience of our workforce. Throughout the 
COVID–19 pandemic, essential workers 
in the United States have continued in 
their daily jobs to care for and protect 
Americans, to produce and deliver food 
and essential goods, and to uphold our 
Nation’s critical infrastructure. 
These men and women—our moms 
and dads, brothers and sisters—are put-
ting the livelihoods of their fellow 
Americans ahead of their own. Each 
and every morning, despite the pan-
demic, they wake up, and they go to 
work. 
In this fight against the invisible 
enemy, the critical logistics operators, 
the supply workers, medical profes-
sionals, and the many others who are 
on 
the 
frontlines 
responding 
to 
coronavirus could not be more impor-
tant to our victory. They truly are our 
heroes. 
Folks, our nation cannot weather 
this pandemic without our essential 
workforce. They, first and foremost, 
deserve our gratitude. Today, we want 
to say: Thank you. Thank you to our 
doctors, our nurses, and our healthcare 
workers who see firsthand the serious-
ness of this disease, yet put their own 
health and lives at risk to care for 
those who are infected. Thank you to 
our truckdrivers who have driven for 
thousands of hours—often back and 
forth on lonely roads—to keep our 
economy running and to deliver the ne-
cessities we rely upon and often take 
for granted. Thank you to our farmers 
who continue to work around the clock 
to feed and fuel the world. Thank you 
to our grocers, cashiers, and retail em-
ployees who keep our store shelves 
stocked and the checkout lines moving. 
And thank you to our childcare pro-
viders who have continued to care for 
our kiddos throughout these tough 
times. 
Folks, these frontline workers de-
serve more than a heartfelt and well- 
deserved thank you. They need to 
know they are appreciated for their 
selfless service. That is why I am pro-
posing we give these heroes a break—a 
tax holiday—and allow them to keep 
more of their hard-earned paycheck. 
Together, with the sacrifice of these 
essential workers, the spirit of gen-
erosity we have seen across Iowa, and 
the service of our leaders at every level 
of government, we will get through 
this. The battle continues, but I know 
that we can and we will beat COVID–19. 
Stay safe and stay strong. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
rollcall. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
want to thank Senator ERNST for her 
work in organizing this effort today to 
come to the floor and talk about the 
good things that are happening in our 
States. We know that the pandemic has 
changed a lot about the way we live 
and work and do business, and Ten-
nesseans are certainly no exception to 
that. 
One thing that has been consistent in 
this entire episode with the pandemic 
is the way Tennesseans step up to take 
care of one another. The numerous acts 
of kindness and graciousness that have 
been shown from neighbor to neighbor 
and community to community is some-
thing that shows the goodness of the 
American spirit. We are just blessed to 
be home to thousands of people who 
have demonstrated their desire to help 
make life a little bit better for their 
neighbors and their friends and some-
times for people they do not know but 
people who have expressed a certain 
need—people like Jeremy Hopkins.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2402 
May 13, 2020 
Jeremy is from Jackson, TN. He is an 
engineer at the Toyota Motor manufac-
turing facility that is in Jackson. He 
became aware of a need for PPE at a 
hospital in New Orleans. A friend of his 
made him aware of this need. Being an 
engineer, he fired up his personal 3D 
computer and printer and got to work 
making face shields for the healthcare 
workers in New Orleans. He worked 
with Union University and some of the 
students there—Union is located in 
Jackson, TN—and he was able to ship 
57 shields to healthcare providers in 
New Orleans. And then he used his re-
maining materials to make another 173 
shields for clinics in West Tennessee 
and Mississippi. 
Steve Archer, a U.S. Air Force vet-
eran and medical supply and logistics 
technician from Fountain City, decided 
to head to New Jersey to see how he 
could help to make certain that PPE 
was delivered on time to hospitals and 
nursing homes and healthcare pro-
viders. While he was helping them, he 
contracted COVID–19. Since that time, 
he has recovered, and he is back on the 
job in Tennessee. 
The Knox County Baptist Disaster 
Relief team has also been working 
some long days at the Sevier Heights 
Baptist Church. What they are doing is 
cooking and assembling meals for the 
homeless. 
Our famous distilleries—moonshine 
and whiskey, which they have been 
making 
there 
in 
Tennessee—have 
changed their production to making 
mass quantities of hand sanitizers. 
Our wonderful singers and song-
writers and musicians and choirs are 
holding concerts by Zoom and online to 
bring some relief and happiness to peo-
ple all across the globe. We are all en-
joying these virtual concerts. 
The always amazing and inspiring 
Dolly Parton is our Tennessean of the 
Year. Dolly is reading bedtime stories 
from 
her 
Imagination 
Library 
on 
YouTube each week. 
And, of course, I would be remiss if I 
did not thank some wonderful women 
who decided to pull out that sewing 
machine and get busy making face 
masks for critical workers all across 
the country. Dottie Godolphin, Marilyn 
Thomas, 
Janis 
Blair—well, 
Dottie, 
Marilyn, and Janis are seamstresses 
par excellence. They are creating these 
masks, and they are sending them 
where there is a need all across the 
country. 
We are known as the Volunteer State 
in Tennessee. This pandemic is showing 
us that just as throughout our Nation’s 
history, Tennesseans have shown up 
when they have been called and asked 
to volunteer and to give their time, 
their efforts, their energy, their tal-
ents, their resources in order to im-
prove the lives of others. We thank 
each and every one who is doing this. 
And those whom I have mentioned, we 
say a special thanks for doing your 
part to ease the life of others during 
this pandemic. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleagues in hon-
oring all who have continued to work 
in service to our Nation during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. My home State 
and our Nation are blessed with dedi-
cated citizens who have continued 
striving to keep essential operations 
going amidst the challenges we face. 
While there are many sectors that 
deserve recognition and will be men-
tioned 
by 
my 
colleagues, 
notably 
healthcare workers, teachers, post of-
fice employees, grocery store workers, 
law enforcement, of course, and many 
others, I want to focus for just a 
minute on the critical efforts of our ag-
riculture 
producers—farmers 
and 
ranchers and so many others. 
Maintaining the food supply chain 
during this public health emergency is 
essential—absolutely essential. As we 
combat coronavirus, our farmers and 
our ranchers have continued to provide 
the food, fuel, and fiber that we need. 
Americans truly benefit every single 
day from the highest quality, lowest 
cost food supply in the world thanks to 
our producers, our farmers, and our 
ranchers. But as operations across the 
country are impacted, food security 
has been a particular concern. We 
greatly appreciate the efforts of those 
working to keep food on our tables 
from our producers to the workers. It 
is not only the farmers and ranchers, 
but it is also the workers at the ag 
processing facilities. 
We know there are real challenges 
there—we have heard about them—but 
we appreciate so much all those work-
ers at the processing facilities so we 
can get that food from the farmer or 
the ranchers to, ultimately, the con-
sumer. That is why, as chair of the 
Senate Ag Appropriations Committee, 
I worked to secure nearly $25 billion in 
funding to help our farmers and ranch-
ers to keep them going. They have 
faced incredible challenges—not only 
low prices but the difficulty in trade 
negotiations and really tough weather. 
For our producers, they have been 
fighting real challenges for some time 
now. With this COVID–19 pandemic on 
top of it, it has made it very tough for 
them. They have hung in there and 
continued to do what they do best, 
which is produce our food supply. They 
have truly stepped up during this emer-
gency, and I think they need to be rec-
ognized for it and thanked for it. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, R.D. 
Offutt Farms—one of the nation’s pre-
mier potato growers and based in 
Fargo, ND—donated 37,000 pounds of 
frozen potato products to the Great 
Plains Food Bank. We grow a lot of po-
tatoes in North Dakota, particularly in 
the Red River Valley. R.D. Offutt 
Farms is a large producer and donated 
37,000 pounds of frozen potatoes to the 
Great Plains Food Bank. 
Another 
example, 
North 
Dakota 
Stockmen’s Association and Founda-
tion donated $20,000 to enable this same 
food bank—the Great Plains Food 
Bank—to purchase beef from North Da-
kota ranchers. One of the big chal-
lenges we have had out there is our 
ranchers continue to raise incredible 
livestock and incredible cattle, finest 
cattle in the world. The tough thing is 
they are getting such a poor price for 
them. We have to figure out how to do 
better because at the same time we see 
prices going up at the grocery store, 
our cattle producers are not getting 
compensated for those animals. Their 
prices are going down. 
We know it is tough in the processing 
industry with the coronavirus, but we 
have to find ways to make changes now 
and for the longer term so that our 
cattlemen are treated fairly and well 
for what they do, which is raise such a 
great quality beef product. Again, 
Stockmen’s, their association, stepped 
up and made donations to the food 
bank. 
Another 
example, 
North 
Dakota 
Farmers 
Union, 
announced 
it 
is 
teaming up with the Farmers Union 
Enterprise to donate 30,000 pounds of 
pork ribs to the Great Plains Food 
Bank. 
Again, these are all examples of our 
farmers and ranchers not only pro-
ducing our great food supply but step-
ping up and donating as well to help 
these people who need it. 
This generosity immediately benefits 
individuals and families across the re-
gion. It is helping to replenish the food 
bank’s 
strained 
inventory, 
which 
serves many food panties, shelters, 
soup kitchens and charitable feeding 
programs. These efforts drive home the 
message that we are all in this to-
gether. Even in the face of tremendous 
challenges, we find a way to make the 
best of tough situations and take care 
of our neighbors. That is what this is 
all about. 
Another farmer sent this same mes-
sage to the Nation. He took the time to 
write while out in one of his fields. He 
wrote: ‘‘We will win the war on COVID– 
19.’’ 
This just demonstrates the spirit of 
our farmers and ranchers and, of 
course, the spirit of our people across 
America. To have this hope and char-
ity, even when our ag producers are 
working to overcome unprecedented 
difficulties, is truly inspirational. That 
is why I come to the floor to give 
thanks to our farmers and our ranchers 
who consistently go above and beyond 
not only to feed our Nation but to 
serve their communities across Amer-
ica. 
That is why we continue working 
with the USDA—the Department of Ag-
riculture—to get vital assistance to 
our farmers and ranchers. We remain

committed to supporting them through 
this pandemic and through a myriad of 
other challenges they face, just as they 
support us every single day. 
I yield the floor to my esteemed col-
league from West Virginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I thank 
my friend from North Dakota. It is 
great to hear stories from his great 
State and to see how they are helping 
each other and how they are coming to 
each other’s benefit. Really, as some-
body who represents a State who has 
agriculture but not in the dimensions 
that Senator HOEVEN has, it is wonder-
ful to see how the ag community has 
stepped up not only in his State but in 
the rest of the country, and we are 
very, very grateful for that. 
We have seen so many people across 
this country step up in so many major 
ways. I often describe my State of West 
Virginia as one big small town. We al-
ways help each other in times of need, 
whether we know the person or not. 
The floods of 2016, I think, were a very 
good example of that. I call it our West 
Virginia spirit, and there is no ques-
tion it has helped us through some 
very difficult times, like the time we 
are facing right now. Every day, each 
of us—and I am certainly no excep-
tion—hears stories about how someone 
or some group has stepped up to the 
plate and has gone above and beyond to 
help one’s community, not to get at-
tention and not because one is forced 
to, but because one genuinely, genu-
inely wants to help and make a dif-
ference. I join my colleagues today in 
highlighting some of those unsung he-
roes. 
Many of us have been able to 
telework. Here we are, serving in the 
Senate. We are here at our jobs. Yet 
most people who are on the frontlines 
don’t have a choice. They are getting 
up every day and facing the challenges 
of this pandemic head on, but it does 
not come without some sacrifice. 
Kristin Schneider, who is a nurse in 
the cardiopulmonary intensive care 
unit at CAMC in Charleston, said that 
she quarantined herself from her fam-
ily and friends due to the fear of giving 
the coronavirus to them since she cares 
for patients who have been affected by 
the disease. We forget sometimes that 
our nurses and doctors and those who 
care for folks who are afflicted have 
families too. 
Another nurse in the same unit said: 
No one felt like a hero when we gowned up 
or put our goggles on. We felt privileged. We 
got to hold the hands of our patients and to 
be their support, their friends, their family, 
and advocates because their loved ones were 
not allowed to be with them at this very dif-
ficult time. 
She goes on to say: 
I love my job. I love my team. I was never 
scared to go to work. 
Aspen Saunders, another emergency 
room nurse, said: 
The most moving gesture I witnessed was 
the prayer circle at the hospital’s cancer 
center. That is a moment in my career that 
I will never forget. I was very overwhelmed 
with the power and volume echoed from 
those who came to pray. It was an inspira-
tional depiction of community strength. 
During this time, I found that I am now 
more grateful for the things that I usually 
take for granted, such as my family being 
healthy. 
I thank these brave nurses, and I 
thank them for their great comments. 
I have also heard from teachers who 
have gone above and beyond the duty 
in making sure their students aren’t 
falling behind, and they are creating 
programs for the students in their of-
fering support for the communities 
across our State. 
Take, for example, Christy, who is a 
fourth grade teacher at Warm Springs 
Intermediate School in the Eastern 
Panhandle. She coordinated an effort 
with her fourth grade students to adopt 
a senior from the Berkeley County 
Senior Center, and through this pro-
gram, they wrote letters. A lot of our 
seniors are living alone and are lonely 
and haven’t been able to get out to 
connect with those seniors. 
Many students, like those at Ripley 
High School in Jackson County, are 
writing 
encouraging 
letters 
to 
healthcare workers to show them their 
support. 
Our first responders are also stepping 
up. I heard a very touching story about 
those at the Gilmer County Volunteer 
Fire Department—right in the heart of 
our State—and how they are driving 
around to different houses to celebrate 
the birthdays that are happening dur-
ing this time. You can imagine what 
that could mean to a 4- or 5-year-old 
child to see a fire engine coming by in 
celebration of his birthday. 
Another inspiring story I heard was 
from a constituent in Wirt County. Her 
name is Deb. Deb realized the need for 
masks very early on, and she started 
an initiative called ‘‘Sewing Faith.’’ 
She has donated materials, and she and 
the women have sewn over 2,500 masks. 
They leave these masks on her front 
porch, in a sanitized container, for 
their healthcare workers. That makes 
it easy for them to pick them up. 
I have heard of businesses donating 
money to pay for the gas of healthcare 
workers. Our car dealerships are donat-
ing masks, and neighbors are donating 
food to the hospitals and to others who 
are not able to get to the store. Over 
the weekend, I heard of one of my 
neighbor’s children. I asked: Where is 
he? They said he was across the street, 
talking to Sue. Sue was widowed re-
cently. She is by herself, and he went 
in and had a cup of coffee with her. 
I have heard of West Virginians tak-
ing to the streets during this stay-at- 
home period and singing songs to 
brighten the days of their neighbors, 
and I have seen Facebook posts of 
young people who have offered to run 
errands for seniors or for those who are 
more vulnerable to this virus. 
This is the spirit of our country, and 
this is the spirit of my State, the West 
Virginia spirit. I could go on and on be-
cause there are 1,000 more stories like 
this, but do you know what? Just a few 
stories can give us hope, stories that 
help to shed some positivity on what is 
a very difficult, stressful, and lonely 
time. 
I have said on this floor many times 
that I am an optimist, and I know we 
will get through this because our coun-
try is strong, because our States are 
strong, and because my West Vir-
ginians are strong. We have heard some 
very inspiring stories this afternoon, 
and they are examples of kindnesses 
happening all across this country. This 
is the kind of kindness that we need 
today. We need it every day, but we 
really need it today. 
Think about all of these unsung he-
roes. Thank them, but also learn from 
them. Let’s all learn a lesson here and 
spread some kindness throughout our 
communities. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Indiana, who has, I am sure, some more 
inspiring stories to tell. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleague from West Virginia. It is 
such a delight to serve with her and 
hear the stories of so many great 
Americans from across the country 
who are stepping up during this time of 
need. 
We are passing through a painful pe-
riod. I think it is safe to say that it is 
one we never imagined we would live 
through. It is one I know we will never 
forget. It is not only the infected that 
this 
pandemic 
has 
hurt, 
for 
the 
coronavirus is robbing so many Ameri-
cans of their ability to earn a living. It 
is taking away businesses they worked 
for decades to build. New anxieties are 
everywhere, and routines are upended. 
Our children are wondering when they 
will see their friends again and why 
their graduations were canceled. It is 
difficult not to feel hopeless or even 
afraid during times like these. 
Congress, I know, is sending every 
necessary support to workers and em-
ployers and is sending much needed 
supplies to medical professionals and 
hospitals. We are also removing red-
tape to help our economy withstand 
this virus and speed medical innova-
tions to treat and to, eventually, cure 
people. 
Yet, 
although 
our 
govern-
ment—a government of the people—is 
sending relief and will continue to do 
so, it is really our citizens who are 
leading the fight outside of govern-
ment. 
We are showing a spirit that is 
uniquely Hoosier and, I dare say, 
uniquely American. Together, we are 
doing our parts, and, together, we will 
pass through this. We see the spirit in 
the 
incredible 
heroism 
of 
our 
healthcare workers and our caregivers. 
We owe them so much. They have been 
asked to bear the greatest burden, and 
they have answered that burden. In so 
doing, they are sacrificing their own 
safety and coming to the rescue where 
medicine cannot.

We have seen it, too, in the bravery 
from those in what we have deemed our 
essential industries. We know they 
were essential long before this crisis, 
but it took this crisis, it seems, to real-
ly amplify that fact. 
We have seen it in the actions of 
rank-and-file 
Hoosiers. 
You 
know, 
across my great State, there are count-
less acts of courage and compassion, 
Hoosiers who leave groceries on neigh-
bors’ doorsteps or who print off 3–D 
masks, even something as simple as to 
call an old friend. Maybe they live on 
their own, and they just need a word, a 
word so they will not feel lonely. 
In Floyd County, a florist I know 
dropped off azaleas at homes around 
the area. The accompanying notes 
read: ‘‘During this time of darkness, we 
hope to bring you a little light.’’ I can 
say these little lights are growing 
across our State in this otherwise dark 
time. 
U.S. marines are taught to confront 
problems with creative thinking; we 
like to say to adapt, to improvise, and 
to overcome. Similarly, when Hoosiers 
face tough situations, they roll up 
their sleeves, and they ask: How can I 
help? When Americans combine our in-
novative spirit with service to others, 
we can meet any moment, including 
the one we are in now. In just recent 
weeks, I have spoken to more than 
22,000 Hoosiers, and I have been moved 
by the stories of compassion and gen-
erosity I have heard. I thought I would 
share a sampling of those with you 
today. 
I heard from Maria with Sowing the 
Seed. Now, Sowing the Seed began as a 
ministry, but it has grown into much 
more than that. In fact, it is a massive 
community project in Vincennes. They 
are sewing masks for those in nursing 
homes, 
seniors, 
the 
immunocompromised, and others dur-
ing these challenging times. 
Twila, with Sure Clean, Inc., told me 
about their efforts to sanitize over 4,000 
masks. 
Willie and I connected from Jennings 
County. Willie is helping out his fellow 
veterans. He is delivering food, mowing 
grass, doing wellness checks—doing his 
part. 
Sean and Ben with Olio—a startup in 
Indiana—are helping hospitals across 
the Hoosier State to coordinate patient 
care and reduce the further spread of 
this virus. 
Darrell, with Lifeline Youth Min-
istries, is making food boxes for kids in 
Elkhart, and he has provided hundreds 
of meals already. 
I also spoke with Crossroads Dis-
tillery, Huber’s Starlight Distillery, 
and French Lick Winery, which have 
completely revamped their operations 
and are now producing and distributing 
hand sanitizer. 
The list of those who are asking how 
they can help and who are finding inno-
vative ways to do so is, frankly, too 
long to recite here. This fight against 
the coronavirus has catalyzed our 
American can-do spirit. Problem solv-
ers across this great Nation are taking 
the initiative, and to them, we say 
thank you. 
Let us move forward, intent that we 
and future generations might draw en-
ergy from this moment forever, and let 
us resolve to find new ways to be better 
citizens by using our God-given talents 
to serve others. The days ahead will 
not be easy, but we will endure them. 
The clouds will part, and when they do, 
we will care for those who have been 
hurt. We will rebuild what we have 
lost, and we will do it with the same 
spirit with which we are now fighting 
this virus. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am 
sure all of us are hearing a common 
question from our constituents, and 
that is, As we are starting to reopen 
our States, is it safe? Does our State 
have all it needs to safely reopen? It is 
now clear, as 50 States are starting to 
reopen, that they are doing so without 
having a vaccine in place—because a 
vaccine, at the earliest, will be avail-
able next year—and without thera-
peutic drugs that can minimize the 
healthcare risk of COVID–19. We are 
starting to reopen. So the question is: 
How do we safely reopen? 
Yes, we have the CDC guidelines, and 
we should be looking at the number of 
new infections in our States, at the 
number of deaths, and at the number of 
hospitalizations and be on a trend line 
that shows that the virus is under con-
trol before we reopen. Yet then there is 
a second element to safely reopening, 
and that is having adequate testing 
available in our communities. We need 
to have adequate testing so that we 
know where the COVID–19 virus is at 
any given time and so that we can 
trace those who come down with new 
infections in order that we don’t have a 
massive communal spread of COVID–19, 
which would cause a second wave of 
misery for our communities and for our 
Nation. 
So these questions are being asked of 
me by people in Maryland: Can we safe-
ly reopen our businesses, and how will 
we go about doing that? Can we send 
our children to school? How about sum-
mer activities for our children? How 
about reopening places of worship? 
In each one of these cases, they have 
to be able to know whether there is an 
infection in their places of business, in 
their schools, and in their places of 
worship. That requires testing. The 
challenge today is that we do not have 
a national strategy on testing. The 
Federal Government and the Trump 
administration have not acted to set 
up as to the need. How much testing do 
we need to have to safely reopen our 
communities, and how do we develop 
that capacity? How do we determine 
priorities? 
I was pleased to see that, in the bill 
she recently released, Speaker PELOSI 
has recognized this and has provided 
additional Federal support to establish 
a national strategy on testing and will 
implement that strategy by having an 
adequate supply so that what we say 
we can do in testing, in fact, we can do. 
Despite 
the 
claims 
of 
President 
Trump, the United States does not lead 
the world in testing. This has been a 
failure of the Trump administration. 
America is not ahead of the curve in 
testing. We have a hard time even jus-
tifying being in the middle of the 
curve. Yet America usually leads and 
helps to bend that curve so that we can 
provide the global leadership to help 
all people, including those in the 
United 
States. 
Instead, 
under 
the 
Trump administration, we have aban-
doned our international involvement 
and U.S. leadership, which is not only 
hurting the global effort, it is hurting 
the American effort. 
We need a detailed strategy on test-
ing. We need to know that we have 
that strategy in place and implement 
it so that we can reopen safely. We 
need to have adequate supplies, and we 
must reverse the attitude that we have 
seen under the Trump administration 
that each State is on its own. We need 
to have a national strategy. 
Maryland, like many States in the 
United States, has struggled to procure 
all of the components that are needed 
to perform diagnostic COVID–19 tests: 
nasal swabs, viral transport media, and 
chemical reagents. A lab must have all 
components in order to test properly, 
but due to unreliable supply chains, 
States do not have all of the needed 
components at one time. For example, 
a lab may have 8,000 nasal swabs, 6,000 
viral transport media, and 2,000 chem-
ical reagents. The amount of testing 
that lab can perform is limited to the 
number of reagents, and it has to run 
the diagnostic tests. 
So, as we look to be able to have the 
capacity to do what we need, we need 
to make sure that we have all three 
elements that are necessary for these 
tests. States’ attempts to increase 
testing have been further hindered be-
cause there has been no action from 
the Federal Government to coordinate 
the supply chain. This week, President 
Trump announced that the Federal 
Government would provide States with 
12.9 million swabs and almost 10 mil-
lion tubes of viral transport media to 
help States test at least 2 percent of 
their population. That is a first step, 
but what about the reagents needed to 
analyze the patient’s viral sample to 
determine if she is COVID–19 positive? 
Again, the States will be unable to per-
form substantial testing without all of 
the components. The Trump adminis-
tration must not shirk from its respon-
sibilities and leave the States to fend 
for themselves. 
For example, only the executive 
branch can solve the underlying prob-
lems of coordination in the supply 
chain to help States, businesses, and 
healthcare providers prepare for and 
respond to the trajectory of this pan-
demic. 
Testing is critical. In order to reopen 
businesses and schools, it is imperative

for States to understand the extent of 
COVID–19 circulating in their commu-
nities. True testing capacity means the 
ability to test all infected people and 
any close contacts that they may have. 
One measure of whether the United 
States has enough testing capacity is 
the ratio of tests that come back posi-
tive. Roughly 15 percent of U.S. tests 
are positive for the virus. The World 
Health Organization has stated that a 
positive rate below 10 percent reflects 
adequate testing. If the rate is higher, 
this means the United States is miss-
ing many active infections. For exam-
ple, in countries such as South Korea 
that have virtually eliminated their 
coronavirus outbreak, the test-positive 
rates are below 2 percent. 
For the past 7 days, the United 
States has averaged around 291,000 
tests performed each day, for a total of 
9.3 million tests performed to date. 
Many public health experts estimate 
that the United States would need to 
double or triple that number of tests 
performed each day to ensure that the 
country can effectively test people 
with symptoms and their close con-
tacts and conduct ongoing surveillance 
to detect new clusters of infection. 
The lack of any Federal plan not 
only mars the Nation’s public health 
response but also hinders any economic 
recovery. The unemployment rate has 
surged to a level unseen since the 
Great Depression, the Labor Depart-
ment announced last Friday. Only 
about one-half of American adults have 
a job, the lowest number of the popu-
lation employed since measurements 
began in 1948. 
Data shows that the economic tur-
moil is driven not primarily by State 
and local governments’ shelter-in-place 
policies but by Americans’ fears that 
going outside would result in illness. 
Weekly surveys of thousands of Ameri-
cans by the Democracy Fund and 
UCLA Nationscape project have found 
that a majority of Americans will not 
eat in a restaurant, go to the movies, 
or return to a shopping mall even if 
they were told they could. Our concern 
is that the Federal Government must 
partner with the States to increase 
this country’s testing capacity in order 
to not only be able to reopen our econ-
omy safely but also to have Americans 
feel safe again. 
How do we do this? Well, we first 
need a national strategy on testing so 
that we can reopen safely. To date, we 
still do not have that. We need the pro-
tocols for testing. Yes, we do test peo-
ple who have symptoms, but we also 
have to have enough testing done so 
that we know where the virus is in our 
community, because many people do 
not have symptoms and are infected by 
COVID–19. 
We need to have a national supply 
chain of the supplies necessary to con-
duct these tests. We need a game plan 
to get there. Yes, the Defense Produc-
tion Act was passed by Congress for the 
purpose of national security. As Presi-
dent Trump said, we are at war. Let’s 
use the Defense Production Act in 
order to have the domestic production 
of supplies we need to have adequate 
testing in our community. If we do all 
that, then, Americans indeed will feel 
safe that the plans that are being im-
plemented by our Governors to reopen 
are backed not only by sound public 
health recommendations but by the 
support in our community to keep 
them safe. 
I urge my colleagues to do every-
thing we need to make sure America 
has the testing capacity it needs, so 
that the American people understand 
that and we can get beyond COVID–19. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, we 
find ourselves celebrating National Po-
lice Week this year in a very unique 
and troubling time in our country’s 
history. This is a week for our Nation 
to recognize the valiant service of po-
lice officers in every community and 
the sacrifices they make day in and 
day out. Particularly now, in the midst 
of this COVID–19 pandemic, such serv-
ice has taken on new significance. 
Local police officers regularly put 
their personal safety at risk to protect 
our friends and families. Whether they 
are stopping armed robberies or help-
ing someone change a tire, these offi-
cers go above and beyond in their du-
ties each and every day. Today, police 
officers face a new risk in the line of 
duty, an infectious novel coronavirus 
that is unpredictable and deadly. 
Despite the unseen danger of this 
new threat, police officers and law en-
forcement officers around the country 
continue to go into our communities 
and perform their duties to protect and 
to serve. Sadly, too many have already 
seen their watches end because of this 
disease. 
In Colorado, one El Paso County 
sheriff’s deputy made such a sacrifice. 
Deputy 
Jeff 
Hopkins 
contracted 
COVID–19 serving his community as he 
had done since 2001. Ultimately, the 
disease would take his life on April 1 of 
this year, merely 1 day after he was di-
agnosed. 
This tragedy was determined to be a 
death in the line of duty. It is a poign-
ant reminder of the increased risk that 
our local police officers face during 
this global pandemic. It is a stark new 
reality for law enforcement that we 
must remember, as so many of us shel-
ter in our homes free from such danger. 
Normally, thousands of police offi-
cers and their families would travel to 
Washington, DC, this week to partici-
pate in the annual police officers me-
morial service, a gathering to com-
memorate and honor the officers who 
made the ultimate sacrifice. I enjoyed 
attending many of these events and 
memorials to visit with the police offi-
cers from Denver, Weld County, Doug-
las County, and Jefferson County—offi-
cers, sheriff officers, and law enforce-
ment from around the State of Colo-
rado love them. 
While this memorial service is meant 
to honor more than 21,000 names en-
graved on the National Law Enforce-
ment Officers Memorial, it is a solemn 
event to commemorate those who sac-
rificed their lives in the line of duty in 
the previous year. Currently, more 
than 320 of the names engraved on that 
memorial are from Colorado. This 
year, they will be joined by three more: 
Colorado State Patrol Corporal Daniel 
Groves, Colorado State Patrol Master 
Trooper William Moden, and Colorado 
Department of Corrections Sergeant 
Joshua Voth. 
We will not have an opportunity to 
participate in the usual ceremonies to 
honor these fallen heroes this year. 
Due to COVID–19 concerns, the 39th an-
nual memorial service had to be can-
celed. It is an unfortunate development 
to be sure, but I know that none of us 
are waiting for an annual gathering to 
honor these fallen officers. These are 
men and women who deserve to be hon-
ored each and every day. 
National Police Week is intended to 
serve as an important reminder. It re-
minds the Nation that police officers 
and law enforcement are an important 
part of our communities who give so 
much of themselves to keep us safe, 
and their families also give so much to 
all of us to keep us safe. It reminds law 
enforcement officers that they have 
not been forgotten and that we indeed 
have their backs. 
Throughout this week we have heard 
and will continue to hear about the 
brave men and women and their fami-
lies who sacrificed not just their lives 
but also their physical and mental 
health, their personal safety, and their 
time and energy to keep all of us safe 
and secure. Needless to say, as the cur-
rent pandemic lingers, such stories will 
become ever more startling and take 
on renewed importance. We must not 
forget these stories. Instead, we must 
use them as stark reminders to provide 
our law enforcement officers with im-
mediate and long-term support to do 
their jobs safely and effectively. This is 
especially true as police officers play 
an ever more critical role in the fight 
against COVID–19. Examples of such 
support include better body armor to 
defend against ever-evolving weapons 
on the street; bolstering mental health 
care for the officers and their families, 
because it is not just the officer who 
goes through the mental anguish of 
service; and now the training and 
equipment they need to protect their 
physical health from deadly diseases 
like COVID–19. 
As we continue to design policies 
that address the pandemic, we must 
not forget these essential workers. Our 
cities, our neighborhoods, and our fam-
ilies depend on the dedicated work of 
their local police officers and police 
force—a work that is too often taken 
for granted, that is too often thank-
less. 
This week should encourage all of us 
to think about the sacrifices made by 
those who have sworn to protect us. It

should give us renewed motivation to 
support them and help them return 
safely to home every night. 
Additionally, I hope this week will 
encourage all of us to reach out to 
those officers and to their families to 
ensure they are getting the support 
they need from Congress. 
To all of those who defend that thin 
blue line, thank you. Thank you and 
God bless. You have my enduring sup-
port and that of a grateful nation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, this 
has been a busy week, walking through 
a lot of issues that are COVID–19 re-
lated, a lot of individual meetings, 
committee meetings, walking through 
what we can get done in preparation 
for the next step. 
I met with Francis Collins very early 
yesterday morning, and we were able 
to walk through where is vaccine de-
velopment, what is happening in this 
current timeline with different treat-
ment options. We are very optimistic 
on some of the vaccine developments 
with multiple different lines of vac-
cines and very hopeful that we will 
have a vaccine in place by this fall. 
That is, we could have hundreds of 
millions—or at least tens of millions of 
different 
vaccines 
that 
would 
be 
ready—well over 100 million that would 
be ready by Christmastime, it looks 
like. So we are continuing to push in 
that direction. 
I have had an untold number of con-
versations with the Secretary of the 
Treasury over the last 5 days, talking 
through the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, trying to settle this issue of for-
giveness. This has been a very big issue 
with small businesses and not-for-prof-
its in my State and, quite frankly, 
around the country. 
There is no closing information on 
how the Paycheck Protection Program 
ends. They were very grateful to have 
the help in the beginning, but it is set 
up to be a loan unless you qualify for 
it. A lot of these folks took that loan 
that will then transition to a grant 
with the hope that everyone would be 
treated fairly, but the rules were not 
set in place. 
I spent a lot of time this weekend 
and through early this week with the 
Treasury Department. They released 
that finding today in a very simple 
statement; that if you are a truly very 
small business or not-for-profit—that 
is, your total loan was $2 million or 
less—you will be in what they call a 
safe harbor. You are not going to have 
to worry about audits or worry about 
followthrough at the end of it. It is 
going to be a very straightforward 
process for those very small businesses 
and small not-for-profits, if that loan is 
$2 million or less. Now, remember, that 
loan covers their total payroll for 2 
months, so that is a truly small entity. 
Once you get into larger entities, 
they may have a loan from $2 million 
to $10 million to cover their entire pay-
roll expenses for 2 months. Those folks 
will have a good-faith process that is 
also outlined that is a very fair process 
that has come out today as well. That 
is helpful. 
When I spoke to Secretary Mnuchin 
earlier today, I thanked him for get-
ting this done. As we have worked 
through this process, I thought that 
was the most reasonable solution to 
provide the greatest clarity and simple 
paperwork for those very small busi-
nesses that don’t have to worry about 
having to pull together a ton of docu-
ments for them. So, for $2 million or 
less for the loan, they will all be in safe 
harbor. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, I even have worked on 
some non-COVID-related issues this 
week. Senator ROSEN and I made con-
tact 
with 
the 
Ambassador 
from 
Ukraine to talk about—in one town in 
Ukraine, some law enforcement sent 
out a letter to every person in the town 
saying, if you are Jewish, we need you 
to register to make sure that we can 
deal with crime in our community. 
That is appalling, so we contacted 
the Ambassador for Ukraine and said: 
Help us understand why there is leader-
ship in one of your towns that is trying 
to register every Jew in your town, 
saying that it is because of crime 
issues. 
They are immediately pulling that 
back, doing an investigation, and I am 
grateful to the nation of Ukraine, 
which has been a very close ally and 
friend of the United States—especially 
in our pushing back against the aggres-
sive Russia that is to their east—that 
Ukraine is continuing to speak out im-
mediately for the basic freedoms of in-
dividuals to live their faith and not 
have to be registered by a local govern-
ment. We are looking forward to an ex-
planation on that in the days ahead. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, the vast majority of 
the things I have worked on this week 
have been related to COVID–19, as we 
try to walk through the issues of my 
State, Oklahoma, in reopening. And 
multiple States around the Nation are 
slowly trying to find ways to reopen, as 
we see other nations doing as well. 
Italy, which was exceptionally hard 
hit, is in the process of reopening right 
now. Germany, which was also very 
hard hit by COVID–19, is in the process 
of reopening. Spain—now fully half of 
Spain is in phase 1 of reopening for 
them as well. South Korea, exception-
ally hard hit, is not only reopening, 
they have already had an election and 
have had record-high turnout phys-
ically at the polls because they set up 
a social distancing process to do in-per-
son voting. They had a record 65 per-
cent turnout, the highest turnout that 
they have had in 28 years, in the first 
election post-COVID–19 outbreak in the 
country. So that is a very hopeful sign 
not only that they are returning to 
life, as we are, but they have also 
worked out a process to be able to have 
voting and safe voting processes. 
The White House has announced a 
tremendous increase in testing again— 
last week, with 2 million COVID–19 
tests that were done, and the target for 
May is to do 13 million tests just in the 
month of May. So it has been a dra-
matic increase, as we are seeing a dou-
bling of things here. 
There are now 79 different diagnostic 
tests that have been authorized. There 
have been 12 different serology tests 
that have been authorized. The FDA 
has granted 92 emergency-use author-
izations, so there is pretty fast work to 
go through the process, knowing that 
this has only been a few months. 
So far, a total of $11 billion has been 
brought in to States and Tribes to off-
set the cost of testing for them. In fact, 
Oklahoma has received $87—almost 
$88—million just to deal with the test-
ing issues in our State as we continue 
to see a rapid acceleration. 
In fact, my State is due to receive 
90,000 swabs just this month to con-
tinue to do the testing there. So we 
have seen a pretty dramatic increase of 
engagement on testing, and that is ex-
ceptionally helpful for us. 
For the Treasury, they have made a 
lot of progress in getting out the eco-
nomic impact payments to people. 
They have now sent out 130 million of 
those. Just in my State, 1.5-plus mil-
lion of those economic impact pay-
ments have been made, totaling about 
$2.8 billion. That is coming as direct 
assistance to folks in my State. It has 
been a significant help to people who 
need to get it. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
continues to help the smallest of busi-
nesses. The economic impact payments 
have gone out, even as the State is fi-
nally starting to come back alive, lit-
tle by little, as we have worked 
through phase 1 of reopening and now 
are headed carefully toward a phase 2. 
I continue to encourage my fellow 
Oklahomans 
to 
continue 
social 
distancing; to wear a mask, which I do, 
in public; and to continue to keep a 
good attention to your own hygiene 
and take care of people who have other 
health issues or people who have, espe-
cially, heart issues or diabetes issues. 
They know to stay home and to keep 
themselves protected, and I encourage 
them to continue to do that. 
Now, while we are working through 
all of these things in the Senate and 
trying to find practical solutions and 
trying to work through things in a 
nonpartisan format, which is what we 
should do right now, taking on COVID– 
19, I was rather shocked yesterday 
when the House of Representatives re-
leased the details of the bill that they 
hope to vote on, on Friday.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2407 
May 13, 2020 
This bill that they hope to vote on, 
on Friday, is a $3 trillion bill. That is 
larger than the previous four bills that 
we have voted on combined. It is a 
pretty dramatic expansion of a lot of 
issues that are not COVID–19 related. 
As we said in the previous conversa-
tion just a month and a half ago, what 
we focus on right now should be 
COVID–19 related, not trying to say it 
is a COVID–19-related bill and then 
stick a bunch of other stuff into it. 
It is over 1,800 pages. In fact, just the 
summary of it—if people want to see 
the summary document of it—is 90 
pages long, just to get the summary of 
it. And it deals with a lot of issues that 
are certainly not COVID–19 related, 
and I think a lot of Oklahomans and a 
lot of other Americans would say: 
‘‘Why did they want to stick that in 
there?’’ And they just think, look over 
here at this big number we are going to 
give the States and look over here at 
this big issue and don’t pay attention 
to these other issues. 
For instance, I understand there are 
legitimate issues on trying to protect 
voting and to make sure that the vot-
ing this year can go off safely and can 
go off in a way that we can have great 
credibility on. That is what South 
Korea just did with record-high turn-
out with in-person voting, but that is 
not what this bill that is coming from 
the House plans to do this week. 
What they plan to vote on, on Friday, 
radically changes voting for the entire 
country, not for this year—perma-
nently. It prohibits States, from here 
on out, from imposing any conditions 
or requirements for eligibility for vot-
ing. It gives absentee ballots mailed to 
every single person. It also breaks 
down any voter ID laws that are in any 
State and authorizes something called 
ballot harvesting, which has been ex-
ceptionally successful in California for 
Democratic candidates. 
It basically allows someone to come 
to your door and say: Have you voted 
yet absentee? If it is no, they can vote 
on the spot, and the person at your 
door can then take the ballot from you 
and say, I will go turn it in for you. 
Well, obviously, there are lots of mo-
ments for fraud in that. This would 
make 
that 
mandatory 
nationwide. 
That is a major issue, to change how 
we do voting forever and to break this 
down. This is not the time to try to 
cram this into a bill that is supposedly 
about COVID–19 and do a permanent 
change on that. 
It also does some things that I was 
rather stunned by, even for some of my 
colleagues 
on 
the 
House 
side. 
It 
changes the economic impact pay-
ments, and it takes away the require-
ment that they have to have a Social 
Security number. Well, if you take 
away the requirement that it has to 
have a Social Security number, what it 
allows, then, is for people who are non-
citizens to be able to get the economic 
impact payments—up to $6,000 per 
household for any individual who is in 
the country. 
Well, that is a pretty dramatic shift 
in what we are doing. It allows people 
who are not legally present in the 
country to actually end up with eco-
nomic impact payments as well. I don’t 
think most people in my State would 
be someone who would agree with that, 
and they would want to know why we 
are trying to stick that in. 
It also does some pretty massive 
changes to how immigration is actu-
ally handled. It frees a lot of people 
who are currently under ICE custody 
right now. It enforces the release of 
those individuals. It awards Federal 
funding specifically to sanctuary cit-
ies. It prevents the deportation of any-
one who is not legally present in the 
United States. It provides deferred ac-
tion and work authorization for anyone 
who is working in a job here, regardless 
of legal status into the country, so it 
literally takes everyone who is not le-
gally present here and gives them legal 
status during this time period. 
It changes the unemployment insur-
ance in a way that is pretty dramatic. 
Currently, the unemployment insur-
ance is greatly plussed-up during this 
time period. There is an additional $600 
per week, per person, for anyone on un-
employment insurance. That allows an 
individual in my State to make about 
$48,000 a year on unemployment assist-
ance. 
The challenge is, there are many in-
dividuals who don’t make $48,000 in 
their normal job, but they are making 
$48,000 now on unemployment assist-
ance. This bill coming from the House 
changes that because that extra $600 
per week expires at the end of July. It 
changes the expiration of that deep 
into next spring of 2021, regardless if 
your State is open for business or not. 
So, in my State, in Oklahoma, lit-
erally, it would encourage people who 
make less than $48,000 a year to not go 
back to work because they could make 
more by staying on unemployment in-
surance—not just through July but all 
the way through the rest of this year 
and through half of next year—regard-
less if your State is open or not, re-
gardless if we have a vaccine or not. 
If we have a vaccine, let’s say, in No-
vember, as Francis Collins states, you 
would still get this unemployment pro-
tection to be able to make $48,000 per 
year past your vaccination and deep 
into next year. I think that is a con-
tinual problem. I think that is an 
issue. 
In the bill itself, it actually sets up a 
series of changes in our Federal can-
nabis laws, at which point I imme-
diately thought, OK, how much infor-
mation is in this bill about cannabis? 
Cannabis is actually mentioned in 
this bill 68 times. I am not sure why 
that is in a bill dealing with COVID–19, 
but it does dramatic changes in our 
Federal cannabis laws. There is a sec-
tion where it gives tax breaks to teach-
ers, firefighters, and law enforcement 
folks—OK, that is great, but stuck 
right in the middle of that section is a 
tax break for billionaires, which I was 
shocked. It is an almost $100 billion tax 
break for the top 1 percent. It is stuck 
right in the section quietly in there, in 
the middle of the section for teachers, 
firefighters, and law enforcement. 
The student loan section was also in-
teresting to me. It provides $10,000 of 
loan forgiveness to every single stu-
dent around the country. I am sure 
every student would be grateful to 
have that, and I am sure every family 
would be grateful to have this, but it 
was not needs-based. It wasn’t any-
thing else. It was just $10,000—a blan-
ket loan forgiveness for every single 
student across the entire country. 
Of course, there is no liability protec-
tion that is anywhere in it. The Pay-
check Protection Program that has 
been exceptionally important to a lot 
of small businesses wasn’t increased. 
Some things that are really needed at 
this time are not even addressed to 
help small businesses again or to help 
with liability protections, which so 
many businesses and educational insti-
tutions and nonprofits are asking the 
question: How do I reopen? What do I 
do? And how do I deal with the liability 
issues? That was not addressed at all. 
I have a lot of concerns about this 
bill, beginning with just the basics of: 
Why didn’t they even try to negotiate 
with Republicans and Democrats. It 
was a straight Democratic bill in a 
time we desperately need to focus on 
not putting out a partisan thing and 
saying look: We are trying to be able to 
help, but don’t look at all these hun-
dreds and hundreds of pages of things 
that are not related to COVID. 
Let’s try to actually solve the prob-
lem that is in front of us. It is serious. 
The issues we face dealing with health 
and the individuals who are on the 
frontlines right now at grocery stores 
and healthcare facilities and hospitals 
and truckers and convenience stores 
and folks who are doing carryout 
food—those folks are doing remarkable 
work, and they should be encouraged, 
not discouraged with a partisan bill 
that is coming out here that everyone 
knows is not going to go anywhere. 
Let’s keep working together. What is 
happening in the Senate to try to es-
tablish 
bipartisan 
agreements 
on 
things, we should continue to be able 
to do. But flying in to do a messaging 
bill worth $3 trillion that changes vot-
ing in America and changes cannabis 
laws and does all kinds of other things 
is not what we need to do right now. 
Let’s keep working, though, because 
there is plenty that does need to be 
done. 
I yield floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before 
the Senator from Oklahoma leaves the 
floor, may I ask a question of him?

Mr.

May 13, 2020 
Mr. LANKFORD. You know what, in 
a colloquy with my colleague from 
Delaware, I do know someone who is a 
Senator— 
Mr. CARPER. What are his initials? 
Mr. LANKFORD. The Presiding Offi-
cer, the Senator from Arkansas, I be-
lieve his birthday is today, Senator 
COTTON. 
Mr. CARPER. TOM COTTON. One of 
the TCs. We lost a really good TC, Tom 
Coburn, 
whom 
Senator 
LANKFORD 
knows passed away about a month and 
a half ago. It was a great loss to our 
country, to his State, and someone 
whom we will always celebrate here 
and revere for his dedication and his 
commitment and the example he set 
for all of us. 
We are glad the Presiding Officer is 
alive and well. I am going to ask him if 
I can proceed with my comments. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today following Senator LANKFORD. I 
want to say a thing or two about Sen-
ator LANKFORD, who is good friend, 
good colleague. We sit together in com-
mittee. In fact, he succeeded Tom 
Coburn in the U.S. Senate. When Tom 
Coburn was leaving, he said: I am leav-
ing, but you are getting somebody bet-
ter than me, and his name is JAMES 
LANKFORD. I don’t know if he is any 
better, but he is a worthy successor. It 
is a privilege to serve with the Senator. 
I think he knows that. 
I spend a lot of my time here trying 
to find ways not where we differ or dis-
agree but areas where we can agree. I 
like to say that sometimes we may not 
see eye to eye on every single policy, 
but we ought to agree on the prin-
ciples. Among the principles as we ap-
proach 4.0—the next major legislation 
dealing with this crisis—I hope one of 
the principles we can agree on is if 
State and local governments are hav-
ing massive losses of revenue that are 
attributable to this coronavirus crisis, 
then they deserve help in terms of re-
placing lost revenue. 
I will give you a couple of examples. 
Delaware Transportation Trust Fund— 
we get a lot of revenues from tolls, and 
I am told by our Secretary of Transpor-
tation that our toll revenue is down by 
over 50 percent. Gasoline sales and 
moneys that we derive from motor fuel 
taxes are also down, as I recall, by 
more than 50 percent. 
It is not just Delaware, as we try to 
build our roads, highways, and bridges 
throughout the country and rebuild our 
infrastructure, improve our service 
transportation 
infrastructure, 
but 
States across the country are getting 
not just whacked but really destroyed 
with respect to our ability to continue 
our transportation infrastructure pro-
grams as well. I think that is an area 
that we ought to be able to agree on. 
The folks at Moody’s every month 
gives us an update on how States are 
doing—the 
revenue 
stream, 
their 
spending stream—so we have an idea to 
compare this May to last May, maybe 
this past April to last April, and to ac-
tually see where the revenue loss is oc-
curring and for us to do something 
about that. I think we can find agree-
ment there. 
Another area we can find agreement 
on is when folks in States and local 
governments are incurring costs that 
directly 
relate 
to 
the 
pandemic— 
healthcare providers, the doctors and 
nurses, folks who are like orderlies and 
all kinds of folks who are in nursing 
homes, in the trenches. Public health, 
first responders, firefighters, EMTs are 
doing that kind of work, and States are 
spending a lot more money to help put 
them out on the streets and in nursing 
homes doing the job. We have an obli-
gation to help States and local govern-
ments to deal with those. 
Another thing I hope we will do is 
focus on training and retraining pro-
grams. Unfortunately, too many busi-
nesses that are closed now will not re-
open. There are a lot of people who 
have skills that made them employable 
to existing businesses that are no 
longer in existence. We need to be fo-
cused on the jobs that are out there 
that need to be filled and people need 
to be trained in. Why don’t we focus 
our retraining dollars, Federal dollars, 
and marry those up with State dollars 
to address that need? 
Those are just a couple of ideas that 
I think we need to focus on. I hope we 
will work with the Governors and work 
with State and local officials, includ-
ing mayors and county executives, and 
find common ground. I think there is 
plenty of common ground. I look for-
ward to working with Democrats and 
Republicans alike here and across the 
country to identify that. 
I say that as a recovering Governor, 
who was once privileged to lead the Na-
tional Governors Association. My hope 
is we can work closely with them, bi-
partisan leadership there. If we can’t 
do that, shame on us. I think we can. 
That is not why I came to the floor. 
I didn’t come here to join Senator 
LANKFORD in celebrating your birth-
day. Now that I am here, I am happy to 
note it and salute that. 
IMMIGRANT HEALTHCARE HEROES 
Mr. President, I came today to honor 
the immigrant healthcare heroes on 
the frontlines in this battle against 
coronavirus. I want to begin by thank-
ing our majority whip, DICK DURBIN, a 
senior citizen. Don’t tell him I said 
that. His staff is right here on the 
floor. The senior Senator from Illinois, 
he and I came to the House together a 
million years ago, in 1982. Maybe some-
day he will be a senior citizen as well. 
I want to thank him—all kidding 
aside—for 
leading 
the 
charge 
and 
bringing much deserved recognition for 
this extra group of Americans. 
Across this country of ours, every 
day there are doctors, there are nurses, 
there are medical support staff, there 
are healthcare workers, caretakers, 
and others who are getting up every 
day, leaving their own families and 
going to work on behalf of members of 
other families. Too often, these men 
and women are doing so at great per-
sonal risk to their own health and, as 
it turns out, to the health of the ones 
they love. 
Despite the grave risks to them-
selves, these heroes and heroines are 
undeterred. Day in and day out, week 
in and week out they continue to serve 
others and continue to demonstrate, by 
their own courage, what leadership by 
example is all about. For that, we are 
deeply grateful. 
Something that most Americans may 
not know is that one in six healthcare 
and social service workers—one in six— 
in this country are immigrants. When 
you add them all up, that is 3.1 million 
people who have chosen to make the 
United States their home and are giv-
ing back to their country, this country 
now, in profound ways. They are not a 
number. They are not a statistic. They 
are caring, courageous members of our 
own communities and of their own 
communities. 
Over the last 31⁄2 years—and even be-
fore that on the campaign trail—we 
heard Donald Trump and many other 
people around him demonize immi-
grants. He has used fearmongering to 
claim that immigrants and Dreamers— 
the young people here when they were 
kids, maybe younger than kids—the 
President 
spent 
a 
lot 
of 
time 
fearmongering to claim that those im-
migrants and Dreamers are going to 
take all of our jobs away. That just 
isn’t true. 
I know a bunch of those Dreamers. A 
lot of them are students at Delaware 
State University. They are students, 
young people, whom any parent would 
be proud to claim as their own. They 
are some of the finest young people I 
have met here or anyplace around the 
world. 
While many Americans are rightly 
following stay-at-home orders, these 
men and women are often putting their 
own health and safety at risk to do 
some of the most critical jobs every 
day. I believe it is important that we 
recognize these immigrant healthcare 
heroes who are playing a truly critical 
role in the fight to protect their fellow 
Americans. 
I mentioned a minute ago that there 
are 3.1 million healthcare and social 
service workers in our country. Today, 
I want to highlight the story of one of 
them. Her name is Cesarina Ramirez. 
She is standing right here over my left 
shoulder. She is a nurse. She is a nurse 
at one of Delaware’s federally qualified 
community health centers. It is called 
Westside Family Healthcare. We only 
have three counties in Delaware. They 
are in Northern Delaware, New Castle 
County, where two-thirds of our resi-
dents live, and also in Kent County, 
which is where Dover is, the capital of 
our State, and Dover Air Force Base, 
the finest Air Force base in the world. 
Westside Family Care, like the nearly 
1,400 federally qualified community 
health centers across the country, 
helps to deliver quality, primary care

services in underserved areas every 
day. Every day—without a lot of fan-
fare or acclaim—they do what my 
mother used to call the Lord’s work. 
That is what she used to call it, the 
Lord’s work. 
Cesarina and her colleagues in Wil-
mington have been serving our commu-
nity throughout the COVID–19 pan-
demic. I want to take the next several 
minutes to share with my colleagues 
and the American people a part of her 
story, why she became a healthcare 
worker and why she continues this 
work now, serving a largely—but not 
entirely—Spanish-speaking population, 
even during the hardest of times like 
the times we are living in today. 
What I am going to do in the next 
several minutes is share with you 
Cesarina’s story. It is not in my words; 
it is in her words. This is what she 
looks like. She works in Wilmington, 
DE, not that far from where my wife 
and I live. I probably met her a time or 
two. I didn’t recognize her because she 
had her mask on here today. Delaware 
is a little State, so you meet just about 
everybody. Here is her story—in her 
words. 
My name is Cesarina Ramirez, and I was 
born in the Dominican Republic. 
My family came to the United States when 
I was seven years old, and I’m the oldest out 
of my 3 siblings. My father was a doctor in 
the Dominican Republic and my mother was 
a teacher. 
As my dad got older and started his family, 
he couldn’t help but notice all the corruption 
and crime that there was in Dominican Re-
public. He wanted the American dream for 
his kids. 
As did his wife. 
So, he decided to leave everything behind 
and move to the land of opportunities: the 
United States of America. 
My dad became a taxi driver. He was work-
ing overnight while going to school in the 
mornings. After 3 years of hard work, he 
graduated with an Associate’s Degree in Ra-
diology. 
Both of my parents are deceased now, but 
their courage and work ethic live on in each 
[of] their children. My siblings and I could 
not be more grateful for their unselfish deci-
sion they made for us. I have been working 
for 10 years at Westside Family Healthcare, 
where I’m a team medical nurse. I educate 
patients about medical conditions to help 
them identify lifestyle changes that can ben-
efit their overall health and goals. The one 
thing that I love the most about my job is 
that I’m able to make a difference in some-
one else’s life. 
As 
the 
years 
passed, 
I 
quickly 
learned about the Spanish interpreta-
tion among our patient population. As 
a Hispanic and with Spanish being my 
first language, I recognize that some-
times it is easier for a patient to speak 
in their native language when it comes 
to medical concerns. I like that I can 
be the voice of the patient, and their 
number one advocate. 
I have observed instances of patients re-
ceiving care from a provider that has the 
same cultural background and speaks the 
same language, resulting in positive health 
care outcomes. In these cases, the patients 
appear relaxed, are willing to ask necessary 
questions to obtain knowledge and there is a 
mutual understanding of goals and plans to 
improve patient care. 
Taking care of patients is a privilege. 
I think it is a privilege to serve the 
people of Delaware and our country. 
She feels that way about her patients. 
Looking at the difference in the amount of 
help that can be provided to the community 
has truly been an inspiration to work hard 
and try to be the best nurse I could be. 
That is the end, if you will, of what 
she has said. I wanted to share that 
with all of you today. 
I don’t know if Cesarina will see 
these proceedings or hear my words or 
hear her words through me, but I want 
to say thank you for that message, 
Cesarina. Thank you for all you are 
doing to serve our community in Dela-
ware, even during these most difficult 
and challenging times. The United 
States and the first State are more 
than lucky. We are blessed that you 
are on our team in this fight against 
the coronavirus. 
To 
all 
the 
other 
immigrant 
healthcare heroes who are serving their 
fellow 
Americans 
throughout 
this 
country—and to those who are fortu-
nate enough to have been born here 
and serve—we salute you. We salute 
you. We thank you for looking out for 
the rest of us so that we might enjoy 
the blessings of life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. We are better for 
having you here among us. We appre-
ciate the lifesaving care you are pro-
viding for so many of us. 
If you are out there hearing the 
sound of my voice and you are an im-
migrant, a healthcare hero, or if you 
know someone who is, I would encour-
age you to share your story with us on 
Twitter or Facebook. Just use the 
hashtag ‘‘immigrant healthcare hero.’’ 
I am going to say that again. Use the 
hashtag ‘‘immigrant healthcare hero.’’ 
We would love to highlight your story 
and thank you as well. 
I don’t see anyone else waiting to sa-
lute you on your birthday and com-
mend you. Not seeing anyone, I will 
yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARPER. My staff was nice 
enough to put this at the end of this 
statement. I would get in trouble if I 
don’t include it. 
Once again, to Cesarina and all of her 
coworkers 
at 
Westside 
Family 
Healthcare, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
many 
healthcare workers in Delaware and 
America—throughout America—work-
ing on the frontlines of this pandemic 
today and every day, we salute you. We 
are forever grateful for the work you 
are doing to keep the rest of us safe 
and healthy. 
As the Presiding Officer is a military 
veteran, Army, I am a veteran as well, 
Navy, and the last Vietnam veteran 
serving in the Senate now that we do 
not have John McCain. 
I am not sure what they say in the 
Army when people are doing a good 
job, but in the Navy we say two words, 
‘‘Bravo 
Zulu.’’ 
That 
means 
‘‘good 
going.’’ In your case, grateful. Keep up 
the good work, Cesarina and all the 
other 
viewers 
across 
our 
country, 
whether they be native-born Americans 
or folks who become Americans by 
choice. 
Thank you for giving me that extra 
dispensation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 6172 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, both at 
home and around the world, the fight 
to defeat the coronavirus seems all 
consuming. It has changed virtually 
every part of our lives, from the way 
we work to how we grocery shop. It 
dominates our conversations, our news 
cycles, and social media feeds. It is 
easy to feel like this is the only threat 
that the world is facing right now, but 
even a pandemic isn’t enough to stop 
those who want to bring harm to our 
country or to the American people. As 
our 
fight 
against 
the 
coronavirus 
wages on, our dedicated counterterror-
ism and counterintelligence experts 
continue their critical work to identify 
potential threats against our country 
and to prevent them from being suc-
cessful. 
One of the most powerful tools in 
their toolbox is the ability to covertly 
gather information about bad actors. 
That is absolutely critical to national 
security. Yet our commitment to pub-
lic safety can be at odds with privacy 
and individual liberty. So we, as a 
country, must have sincere trust in 
both the people and the processes that 
govern that activity. That is why I fear 
that recent events have put our trust 
of both in grave jeopardy. 
Last December, the inspector general 
for the Department of Justice released 
his report on the FBI’s counterintel-
ligence investigation of the Trump 
campaign and its purported contacts 
with Russia. This 480-page report out-
lined a pattern of concerning behavior 
by those who were charged with pro-
tecting 
and 
defending 
the 
United 
States and upholding our laws. The in-
spector general has detailed a number 
of truly disturbing and alarming facts 
about how the Russia investigation 
was conducted, specifically when it has 
come down to the abuse of the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act. He has 
identified 7 mistakes—I think he was 
being generous in calling them mis-
takes—in the initial Carter Page FISA

application and an additional 10 mis-
takes, or errors, in 3 renewals. 
Now, these were not typos or mis-
spelled words. These were significant 
and material errors that misled and af-
fected the independent judgment of the 
FISA Court, or the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Court. In other 
words, they presented erroneous infor-
mation—sometimes by omission, some-
times by commission—which may have 
affected the decision of the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Court. 
To make matters worse, even as new 
and exculpatory information came to 
light, this information was not pro-
vided to the FISA Court. In a nutshell, 
this report raised a big red flag and led 
to the inspector general’s conducting a 
subsequent audit on unrelated cases to 
see how widespread the problems were, 
but that audit revealed even more 
problems. 
The inspector general recently re-
leased an interim report based on a 
sample of 29 FISA applications. For 
four of these, the FBI could not even 
locate the Woods files, which were 
meant to include supporting docu-
ments for the claims made in the sworn 
applications. For the remaining 25 ap-
plications, an average of 20 ‘‘issues’’ 
were found in each, with 1 application 
having 65 ‘‘issues.’’ You might as well 
use the word ‘‘errors.’’ This is alarming 
and absolutely unacceptable. 
The Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act has been amended several 
times over the more than 30 years that 
it has been law, particularly since 9/11. 
In light of these developments, it is 
time to, once again, strengthen the 
oversight of our Nation’s intelligence 
activities and restore trust in our crit-
ical institutions. 
FISA reform is part of the congres-
sional ‘‘to do’’ list. It has been for some 
time, and it still is. Before key provi-
sions could expire last year, Congress 
extended these authorities through 
mid-March to provide time for a debate 
over future reforms. Of course, back 
then, no one suspected that we would 
be working on a pandemic response 
when that deadline arrived. With the 
coronavirus spreading across the coun-
try, it was hardly the time to debate 
the long-term changes that should be 
made to this program. So the Senate 
passed a short-term extension. Had our 
colleagues in the House passed that 
bill, those authorities would have still 
been intact through the end of the 
month. 
Unfortunately, as we know, that is 
not what happened. The Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act’s authorities 
expired nearly 2 months ago, and now 
our national security experts are with-
out the tools they need to keep the 
American 
people 
safe. 
That 
must 
change. 
The bipartisan bill that we are con-
sidering today would reauthorize cer-
tain FISA provisions that are impor-
tant to our national security while it 
would make significant reforms to pre-
vent future abuses like we saw in 2016. 
At a time when it is clearly needed, 
this bill would strengthen the congres-
sional oversight of the FISA process. It 
would also take steps to prevent future 
abuse of the FISA Court by requiring 
transcripts of court proceedings and in-
creasing penalties for those who know-
ingly abuse the process for inappro-
priate reasons. 
One of the most significant changes 
we would see as a result is an end to 
the call detail record, or CDR, pro-
gram. This program was created in 2015 
to replace bulk collection with a more 
targeted approach, but the program 
has been riddled with issues from the 
start. Two years ago, the National Se-
curity Agency said that ‘‘technical 
irregularities’’ made it difficult to ac-
tually implement the program. The Na-
tional Security Agency received a jum-
bled mess of call detail records from 
phone companies, and it was not able 
to separate the data records it should 
have received from the ones it should 
not have received. As a result, it ended 
up deleting all of the records dating 
back to 2015 when the CDR program 
was established. Clearly, this program 
was not delivering the targeted ap-
proach it was intended to provide. In 
fact, it just created more work—all to 
end up empty handed. 
This legislation will put an end to 
the CDR program. The National Secu-
rity Agency has said the cost simply 
outweighs the benefit, but we want to 
make sure we are also not wasting val-
uable human resources on a program 
that is failing to achieve its intended 
purpose. Above all, this legislation will 
restore authorities our counterintel-
ligence and counterterrorism experts 
need to protect the American people. 
In order for these authorities to pro-
tect the American people and serve 
their intended purpose, we need trust— 
trust in the FISA Court, trust in our 
congressional committees, and trust in 
the professionals who actually work 
with 
these 
authorities. 
The 
USA 
FREEDOM Reauthorization Act will go 
a long way to restoring that trust 
while we continue to work on longer 
term reforms and empower our intel-
ligence officials to carry out their 
sworn duties. 
This bill received broad, bipartisan 
support in the House, and I hope it will 
enjoy similar support in the Senate. 
This legislation will ensure that these 
critical national security tools remain 
intact while it takes serious quality 
control measures to prevent abuse. 
We can’t have a repeat of the disas-
trous FISA abuse in 2016, and we can-
not allow these critical surveillance 
authorities to disappear. The best of 
tools can be misused by people who are 
intent on abusing their power. That is 
what happened when the inspector gen-
eral revealed the FISA warrants that 
were issued against the Trump cam-
paign and Trump’s associates in an ef-
fort to try to come up with some evi-
dence of collusion and obstruction. In 
the end, not even the special counsel 
was able to find enough evidence to be 
able to make those cases. 
We shouldn’t confuse the tools with 
the people who abuse those tools. We 
know that the Attorney General, Wil-
liam Barr; Chris Wray, the FBI Direc-
tor; and Mr. Durham, the U.S. attorney 
who has been deputized by the Attor-
ney General, are currently conducting 
investigations that will, perhaps, even 
lead to criminal charges, indictments, 
and potential convictions of those who 
abused these authorities in the past. 
That should not change our attitude 
toward 
providing 
these 
necessary 
tools—things like business record col-
lection, roving wiretaps, and lone wolf 
authority. By and large, these are tools 
that are used by law enforcement on a 
daily basis for domestic critical cases. 
Yet we are going to deny those tools to 
our counterintelligence officials? It 
makes no sense whatsoever. Our coun-
terintelligence and counterterrorism 
experts rely on those authorities to 
keep us safe, and it is time we return 
this critical tool to their toolbox. I 
look forward to supporting this legisla-
tion and to restoring these lapsed au-
thorities, which are critical to our na-
tional security. 
I yield the floor.

AMENDMENT NO. 1584 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
must admit that when I look around 
this body, it looks a little bit different 
than when I first came here, and I will 
be glad when we get back to normal. In 
the meantime, I want to say that I en-
tered the Senate in the wake of Water-
gate in 1975. It was a time when the 
American people’s faith in their insti-
tutions, including their intelligence 
agencies, was profoundly shaken. 
I remember standing on this floor, 
and the very first vote I cast was in 
favor of creating the Select Committee 
to Study Government Operations with 
Respect to Intelligence Activities and 
the Rights of Americans. That was 
called the Church Committee. It was 
the forerunner of our Intelligence Com-
mittee. 
Through the Committee’s work, the 
American people soon learned of years 
of surveillance and other abuses that 
had occurred at the hands of the U.S. 
intelligence agencies. In response, the 
Senate came together, Republicans and 
Democrats together, to pass sweeping 
reforms to rein in this overreach. 
So much has improved over the 45 
years with respect to the intelligence 
agencies’ compliance with the law. I 
must admit that seeing the changes 
over the years gives me a great deal of 
confidence that we can continue to de-
velop. But we do know that there are 
some inexcusable problems that re-
main. We have seen time and again

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2411 
May 13, 2020 
that the system we created with the 
government lawyers seeking approval 
for surveillance in a secret surveillance 
court falls short of protecting Ameri-
cans’ due process rights. 
I know a lot of our intelligence pro-
fessionals. I have no doubt that our in-
telligence 
professionals 
work 
very 
hard. They are dedicated to protecting 
Americans, and they strive to follow 
the rules. I don’t doubt that at all, but 
I can’t escape the conclusion that the 
rules are simply not good enough. A 
process that operates in total secrecy, 
with no checks on the government’s al-
legations or portrayal of the facts at 
issue, is bound to fall short. When it 
comes to justice—justice which is a 
bedrock of our democracy—well, to say 
it falls short is not good enough. 
Last fall, the Justice Department in-
spector general issued a report that de-
tailed 17 errors or omissions in the 
FBI’s FISA applications to surveil 
former Presidential campaign adviser 
Carter Page. While the inspector gen-
eral did not find that the mistakes 
were politically motivated, those of us 
who were at those hearings know that 
the errors were nonetheless serious, 
and we have since learned that they 
were not isolated incidents. 
In March, just 2 weeks after the 
House passed the very legislation we 
are considering today, the inspector 
general released an even more damning 
report. He sampled just 29 applications 
for FISA surveillance. In those 29, he 
found deficiencies in 25 of the 29, with 
an average of 20 issues on each applica-
tion. Errors included a failure to dis-
close all exculpatory evidence. That is 
simply unacceptable. It strongly indi-
cates that something is wrong and 
needs to be fixed within the FISA proc-
ess. 
I joined with Senator LEE of Utah. 
We have been working together to do 
just that—to define what the fixes 
might be. The heart of our proposal is 
to improve the amici program we cre-
ated with the assistance of Members 
such as Senator BLUMENTHAL with the 
USA FREEDOM Act of 2015. We created 
a process by which the FISA Court 
could appoint amici to provide an inde-
pendent perspective on certain complex 
issues before the court. Amici do not 
act as defense attorneys, representing 
the target of the surveillance. They 
serve the court. But we gave the court 
narrow grounds to require the appoint-
ment of amici—novel or significant in-
terpretation of law. 
While amici have since served the 
court well, they have only been ap-
pointed 16 times over the last 5 years. 
We have to do more to encourage the 
appointment of amici in cases that in-
volve serious constitutional issues. 
My amendment with Senator LEE 
would create a presumption of amici 
participation in cases involving signifi-
cant First Amendment issues, not just 
‘‘exceptional concerns’’ as in the House 
bill. Importantly, we also create a pre-
sumption of amici participation when 
the FBI considers the case to be a ‘‘sen-
sitive investigative matter’’ which the 
FBI would call an investigation involv-
ing the domestic media, a domestic re-
ligious organization, or a public offi-
cial. I think all of us should agree that 
in those instances we ought to have 
somebody independently looking at 
them. 
Most critically, though, we would 
leave the decision to appoint amici en-
tirely up to the FISA judge. Even if it 
would fall into all of these categories 
they could still say no. As a result, the 
argument that the expanded amici par-
ticipation would duly burden the court 
doesn’t even withstand the slightest 
scrutiny. If the judge believes amici 
would not be appropriate because the 
case is too time sensitive or too simple 
or too routine or for any other reason— 
any other reason—they have the dis-
cretion to not appoint amici at all. 
Under our amendment, throughout the 
FISA process, the judge maintains 
complete control. It is not a burden on 
the court. What it is doing is empow-
ering the court. It is up to them. 
In reality, the number of cases that 
would have amici participation under 
our amendment would remain manage-
able. The cases likely to raise signifi-
cant civil liberties issues would almost 
certainly be a small subset of applica-
tions related to U.S. persons, as for-
eigners abroad do not have constitu-
tional rights like Americans. The total 
number of such U.S. person cases last 
year was just over 200. 
Perhaps this is why the courts them-
selves would not anticipate that our 
amendment would create a significant 
financial burden. The Administrative 
Office of the Courts estimated costs to 
be about $225,000 a year, which they can 
pay for out of their discretionary budg-
et. There is plenty of money in there. 
In fact, the CBO scored the amendment 
as zero. 
But the benefits go far beyond zero. 
Responding to the latest inspector gen-
eral report, which found serious issues 
in 25 of the 29 FISA applications they 
reviewed, we would require that the 
government turn over all material ex-
culpatory information to the court and 
make it available to amici, too, if one 
is appointed. That is a basic due proc-
ess protection available in every public 
courtroom in America. It certainly was 
when I was a prosecutor. The FISA 
Court should be no exception. 
So, I think, with this any Senator 
should look at what Senator LEE and I 
have done. We have an opportunity to 
reform our flawed surveillance authori-
ties. These opportunities don’t come by 
often. We shouldn’t squander it, espe-
cially when the Justice Department’s 
own inspector general has been alert-
ing us of the widespread problems with-
in the FISA process. 
After the Church Committee found 
abuses within our intelligence agen-
cies, something I first learned of when 
I got elected to the Senate, I saw the 
Senate come together, Republicans and 
Democrats, 
to 
respond 
decisively. 
While much has improved since then, 
they now are confronted with serious 
but solvable problems within the FISA 
process. I hope I have given the Senate 
and both parties something for them to 
come together. 
I want to thank Senator LEE for his 
partnership on this issue and also for 
his steadfast devotion to protecting the 
rights of all Americans. I am proud to 
stand with Senator LEE today. I urge 
all of our fellow Senators to stand with 
us, because if you stand with us you 
are standing up for the Constitution. 
Support this amendment, stand with 
the American people, and stand with 
our Constitution. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I call up 
my amendment No. 1584 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Utah [Mr. LEE] proposes 
an amendment numbered 1584. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for a pe-
riod not to exceed 5 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, it has 
been an honor and a privilege to work 
with my friend and distinguished col-
league, 
the 
senior 
Senator 
from 
Vermont, on this issue. Senator LEAHY 
and I have, over the past decade, 
worked 
together 
on 
a 
number 
of 
projects including this one, including 
the USA FREEDOM Act. 
Senator LEAHY and I come from dif-
ferent political parties and different 
ends of the political spectrum, and yet 
we share much in common, including a 
devotion to our families, a devotion to 
God, a devotion to this great country, 
and a devotion to the Constitution that 
has fostered the development of the 
greatest civilization the world has ever 
known. It is an honor and a privilege to 
stand with Senator LEAHY in defense of 
the Fourth Amendment and the other 
rights articulated in our Constitution. 
Senator LEAHY and I have confronted 
many opponents, and many opponents 
to the Lee-Leahy amendment have 
made arguments that I think need to 
be mentioned one final time before we 
vote on this matter. Many of them are 
arguing that this amendment would 
somehow hamper the ability of the 
FISA Court to approve applications 
quickly in the case of an emergency. 
This is simply untrue. In all these cir-
cumstances in which it would apply, 
our amendment would allow the FISA 
Court to issue a finding saying the ap-
pointment of amicus would, in that cir-
cumstance, be inappropriate. This the 
FISA Court could do in a single sen-
tence. 
The FBI or some of its proclaimed 
self-appointed defenders also complain

May 13, 2020 
that this might make it harder for 
them to get surveillance applications 
approved. Let me just remind everyone 
that we are talking about the rights of 
U.S. persons—that is, of U.S. citizens 
and lawful permanent residents of the 
United States. These are rights that 
deserve to be protected. We have to re-
member that the purpose of the Con-
stitution is not to make it easier to 
govern. The purpose of the Constitu-
tion is to provide structure and limita-
tions on government because govern-
ments sometimes make mistakes. 
I find it especially tone deaf that the 
very agency—the very Bureau—that 
has now been found to have been in vio-
lation of its own policies and proce-
dures—in not just one but two inspec-
tor general reports in the past year— 
for failing to follow its own policies is 
now the agency that many people are 
trying to defend in saying that we 
can’t inform the American people of 
what is going on and we can’t improve 
the process by which that agency oper-
ates. 
Power is always vulnerable to abuse. 
Warnings were made when this process 
was put into place, and exactly the 
kinds of abuses that we have now seen 
are the types of abuses that have oc-
curred over and over or are the same 
ones that were foreseen. 
This isn’t an indictment of any one 
agency or administration or person or 
political party. It is an affirmation of 
the Founding Fathers’ trust in the 
checks and balances that they put in 
place in our founding document. James 
Madison so eloquently expressed this 
principle in Federalist 51: 
If men were angels, no government would 
be necessary. If angels were to govern men, 
neither external or internal controls on gov-
ernment would be necessary. In framing a 
government which is to be administered by 
men over men, the great difficulty lies in 
this: We must first enable the government to 
control the governed; and in the next place, 
oblige it to control itself. 
We cannot—notwithstanding the urg-
ing of many—simply wave our hands 
and say: No, we don’t have to worry 
about this. It is OK because we have to 
worry about national security or it is 
OK because this is about foreign intel-
ligence or this is about foreign intel-
ligence gathering. 
We know that what the Lee-Leahy 
amendment is designed to protect are 
the rights of the American people—of 
U.S. persons—U.S. citizens and lawful 
permanent residents. Reforms in this 
amendment do not take anything away 
from the National Security Agency— 
nothing. We are just injecting greater 
fairness and accountability into this 
process. 
Insofar as we decide to have these 
programs, we have to have someone ac-
countable in them. We have to have a 
process 
by 
which 
the 
information 
brought to bear within the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Act Court is ac-
countable and reviewable by someone. 
It makes sense to expand incremen-
tally, mildly, but necessarily, the ami-
cus curiae provisions that were put in 
place 4 years ago with the USA FREE-
DOM Act. 
I truly believe that we can find a 
proper balance here between privacy 
and security. I also believe that our 
privacy and our security are not at 
odds. Our privacy is, indeed, a part of 
our security and our security part of 
our privacy. You cannot have one with-
out the other. 
The Lee-Leahy amendment brings us 
closer to that balance. I invite all my 
colleagues to support it and look for-
ward to the moment, not far from now, 
when we will pass it. 
I yield the floor.

NATIONAL SUICIDE HOTLINE 
DESIGNATION ACT OF 2019 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, in a 
Chamber that has seen more than its 
fair share of life-or-death matters, es-
pecially the last several months, this 
bill that I am about to ask for unani-
mous consent to pass before the Sen-
ate, the creation of the 988 National 
Suicide Hotline bill, is a bill that gives 
hope to life. 
This bill will save lives. It has been 
an honor to work on this legislation so 
we can come together as a Chamber, as 
a Congress, as a nation, to do all we 
can to save those precious lives, those 
precious voices, that we lose too often. 
In Colorado, we lose someone to sui-
cide every 7 hours. The bill that we are 
about to pass can change that. We can 
all change that with responsible ac-
tions, more funding, more efforts, and 
this is our start to continue the great 
work that has been done, to build on 
the work that we know needs to be 
done, to create a 3-digit 988 national 
hotline to prevent suicide. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation be discharged and the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 2661. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2661) to amend the Communica-
tions Act of 1934 to designate 9–8-8 as the 
universal telephone number for the purpose 
of the national suicide prevention and men-
tal health crisis hotline system operating 
through the National Suicide Prevention 
Lifeline and through the Veterans Crisis 
Line, and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to proceeding to the meas-
ure? 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. GARDNER. I ask unanimous con-
sent 
that 
the 
Gardner 
substitute 
amendment at the desk be agreed to 
and that the bill, as amended, be con-
sidered read a third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 1585) was agreed 
to as follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following:

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘National 
Suicide Hotline Designation Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) According to the American Foundation 
for Suicide Prevention, on average, there are 
129 suicides per day in the United States. 
(2) To prevent future suicides, it is critical 
to transition the cumbersome, existing 10- 
digit National Suicide Hotline to a uni-
versal, 
easy-to-remember, 
3-digit 
phone 
number and connect people in crisis with 
life-saving resources. 
(3) It is essential that people in the United 
States have access to a 3-digit national sui-
cide hotline across all geographic locations. 
(4) The designated suicide hotline number 
will need to be both familiar and recogniz-
able to all people in the United States. 
SEC. 3. UNIVERSAL TELEPHONE NUMBER FOR 
NATIONAL 
SUICIDE 
PREVENTION 
AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS HOT-
LINE SYSTEM.

fee or charge applicable to a commercial mo-
bile service or an IP-enabled voice service 
specifically designated by a State, a political 
subdivision of a State, an Indian Tribe, or 
village or regional corporation serving a re-
gion established pursuant to the Alaska Na-

pose for which any such fees or charges are 
specified.

SEC. 6. REPORT ON CERTAIN TRAINING PRO-
GRAMS. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) youth who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, or queer (referred to in this sec-
tion as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) are more than 4 times 
more likely to contemplate suicide than 
their peers, with 1 in 5 LGBTQ youth and 
more than 1 in 3 transgender youth reporting 
attempting suicide; 
(2) American Indian and Alaska Natives 
have the highest rate of suicide of any racial 
or ethnic group in the United States with a 
suicide rate over 3.5 times higher than the 
racial or ethnic group with the lowest rate, 
with the suicide rate increasing, since 1999, 
by 139 percent for American Indian women 
and 71 percent for men; 
(3) between 2001 and 2015, the suicide death 
rate in rural counties in the United States 
was 17.32 per 100,000 individuals, which is sig-
nificantly greater than the national average, 
and the data shows that between that same 
time period, suicide rates increased for all 
age groups across all counties in the United 
States, with the highest rates and the great-
est increases being in more rural counties; 
and 
(4) the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration must be equipped to 
provide specialized resources to these and 
other high-risk populations. 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Assist-
ant Secretary for Mental Health and Sub-
stance Use shall submit to the Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation of 
the Senate, the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate, 
and the Committee on Energy and Commerce 
of the House of Representatives a report 
that— 
(1) details a strategy, to be developed in 
consultation with the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health, and organizations ca-
pable of providing nationwide suicide preven-
tion and crisis services for LGBTQ youth, 
minorities, rural individuals, or other high- 
risk populations, for the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Administration 
to offer, support, or provide technical assist-
ance to training programs for National Sui-
cide Prevention Lifeline counselors to in-
crease competency in serving high-risk popu-
lations; and 
(2) includes recommendations regarding— 
(A) the facilitation of access to services 
that are provided to specially trained staff 
and partner organizations for LGBTQ youth, 
minorities, rural individuals, and other high- 
risk populations; and 
(B) a strategy for optimally implementing 
an Integrated Voice Response, or other 
equally effective mechanism, to allow Na-
tional Suicide Prevention Lifeline callers 
who are LGBTQ youth, minorities, rural in-
dividuals, or members of other high-risk pop-
ulations to access specialized services. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading and was read the 
third time. 
Mr. GARDNER. I know of no further 
debate on the bill, as amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate on the bill, as amended? 
The bill having been read the third

f 
USA FREEDOM REAUTHORIZATION 
ACT OF 2020—Continued 
FISA 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, we 
have just voted on an amendment by 
Senator LEE, which passed overwhelm-
ingly. As we in the Senate are working 
to defeat this invisible enemy, the 
coronavirus, we are also mindful that 
there are other real threats around the 
globe. That is why the amendment that 
we just passed was so important to be 
debated and discussed and dealt with— 
the bill that is on the floor—because 
the Senate is debating a bill to provide 
national security tools to our intel-
ligence community. 
We want to make sure they have the 
right tools, the tools that work, that 
provide national security but also free-
dom for American citizens. 
Now, this is unfinished business be-
cause these tools under the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Act have been 
left on the shelf, expired now for nearly 
2 months. 
Before Congress departed the Capitol 
due to the coronavirus, the Senate 
passed a bipartisan bill to temporarily 
keep these authorities in place. The 
House Democrats left without acting 
on what the Senate had passed. Speak-
er PELOSI left town, and she left our 
national security frozen. 
Now, this week, Congress is going to 
pass a 3-year reauthorization of these 
authorities under FISA. These authori-
ties are known as the business records 
provision, the roving wiretaps provi-
sion, and the lone wolf amendment. 
The business records provision, or 
section 215, as it is known, compels 
telecommunications companies to pro-
vide call records relevant to investiga-
tion. 
The roving wiretaps provision allows 
surveillance of multiple cellphones of 
an investigative target. This allows na-
tional security operators to keep up 
with a target, even as she or he goes 
through burner phones. 
The lone wolf amendment allows na-
tional security operators to investigate 
targets unaffiliated with a specific ter-
rorist organization. That is why they 
are called lone wolves. 
Combined, these tools give the intel-
ligence community and law enforce-
ment important capabilities: to surveil 
bad actors, to get to them before they 
get to us, and to take apart their net-
works. Congress put these authorities 
in place after 9/11. They have been up-
dated with broad bipartisan support 
numerous 
times. 
Importantly, 
the 
tools have helped keep our country safe 
and strong now for nearly 20 years 
after 9/11. 
There have been abuses of the FISA 
process unrelated to these provisions, 
which this bill also addresses. The bill 
puts in place safeguards to ensure 
FISA applications are accurate and 
complete, with multiple layers of ap-
proval before an application goes to the 
Foreign 
Intelligence 
Surveillance 
Court. The bill also makes the FISA 
process more accountable, from the At-
torney General on down. Those who 
hide information, those who engage in 
misconduct, or those who disclose in-
formation will be met with prison 
time. 
The bill provides a greater role for 
Congress to make sure there are an-
other set of eyes on FISA applications. 
All together, these are significant re-
forms that the Attorney General has 
said will protect against abuse and 
misuse in the future. He went on to say 
the bill deserved broad bipartisan sup-
port, and I agree. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
also come to the floor today to discuss 
America’s relationship with China. The 
coronavirus has made clear that our 
current relationship with China is built 
on a house of cards. It is simply too 
risky. 
We have to learn the lessons from 
this global pandemic. The outbreak has 
taught us that the time has come to 
break away from dangerous aspects of 
the relationship. By mishandling and 
manipulating the crisis, China has re-
vealed itself to be not worthy of our 
trust. 
Let me be clear. The Chinese people 
are not to blame for any of this. The 
people of China have also suffered tre-
mendously. It is the Chinese Com-
munist Party that is at fault. The virus 
could have been contained had it not 
been for the Chinese Government’s un-
scrupulous coverup. China knew the 
risk months before the rest of the 
world; yet Chinese communist leaders 
destroyed key evidence, they under-
reported the number of coronavirus 
cases, and they misled the world about 
its deadly, rapid spread. In fact, Chi-
nese leaders silenced the heroic Chi-
nese doctor, Dr. Li, who tried to sound 
the alarm and who later died from the 
virus. 
China’s deceit doesn’t stop there. 
China has repeatedly denied U.S. offi-
cials access to the country to uncover 
the truth about the deadly disease. 
Meanwhile, the Chinese Government 
continues 
to 
engage 
in 
a 
disinformation campaign to try to 
avoid blame. 
With this track record, China cannot 
continue 
to 
control 
international 
groups like the World Health Organiza-
tion. The United States is the World 
Health Organization’s single largest fi-
nancial supporter. Yet, from the start, 
the World Health Organization blindly 
accepted Chinese leaders’ false report-
ing, and they understated the threat. 
Today, America knows how dan-
gerous it is to depend on China not just 
for information but also for essential 
equipment, for products, for materials, 
for minerals, and certainly for medi-
cine. China didn’t warn the world when 
the outbreak began. Instead, China se-
cretly hoarded masks and protective 
gear. China knew that global shortages 
would soon follow. Then China threat-
ened to cut off lifesaving antibiotics 
and other critical drug exports to the 
United States. 
The virus should have been contained 
in Wuhan, China. Tens and tens of 
thousands of Americans and hundreds 
of thousands of people worldwide have 
died as a result of China’s failure. 
Looking forward, America should 
focus on priorities right now to protect 
ourselves from future health crises. 
No. 1, not again, not ever will Amer-
ica rely on information from inter-
national 
health 
organizations. 
We 
should set up direct bilateral health re-
lationships with other countries. U.S. 
personnel on the ground must include 
monitoring of health data in their na-
tional security determinations. 
No. 2, not again, not ever will we let 
people travel to the United States from 
countries where there is a major out-
break. We should restrict travel early 
on, just as President Trump did with 
regard to China. 
No. 3, not again, not ever will Amer-
ica be without an early warning sys-
tem. Our gateway cities, in particular, 
need better monitoring and surveil-
lance of health issues when people 
enter the United States. 
No. 4, not again, not ever will Amer-
ica rely on critical health equipment 
from China. We should encourage U.S. 
companies 
to 
create 
Western 
and 
American supply chains. That way our 
frontline workers have what they need 
in the time of crisis. 
No. 5, not again, not ever will we be 
exclusively sourced for critical drugs 
from China. We should diversify supply 
and bring home as much of our supply 
chain as possible. 
No. 6, not again, not ever will our 
hospitals be taken for granted. They 
should be classified as critical infra-
structure and our healthcare workers— 
our nurses, our lab technicians, our 
first responders, our doctors. Critical 
infrastructure and frontline workers 
should be properly resourced around 
our Nation. 
No. 7, not again, not ever will Ameri-
cans rely solely on the Centers for Dis-
ease Control for testing. President 
Trump proved that when called upon,

our private sector has an incredible 
multiplier effect. 
No. 8, not again, not ever will we 
allow public misrepresentation and 
confusion concerning an urgent health 
issue. The American people deserve 
timely, credible, and accurate informa-
tion—the same as for tornadoes, hurri-
canes, and other disasters. 
No. 9, not again, not ever will we be 
dependent on China for trade and 
goods, especially not for critical infra-
structure and technology. 
No. 10, not again, not ever will a pre-
vious administration leave an incom-
ing administration without an updated, 
forward-looking bipartisan policy and 
preparedness program on pandemics 
and without a pathway for the products 
and equipment needed to go along with 
it. 
By taking these sensible steps, we 
will be able to protect the health and 
the well-being of the American people. 
These 10 priorities will make America 
and Americans stronger, safer, and 
more secure. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this 
week, the Congress continues to work 
on a bipartisan basis to try to respond 
to this coronavirus pandemic. We have 
heard that the House of Representa-
tives, under Democratic majority, has 
a new proposal. We have ideas on our 
side. We have already passed four 
pieces of legislation that deal with the 
coronavirus pandemic. The total spend-
ing is about $2.5 trillion that has al-
ready been spent. 
The Speaker of the House proposed a 
new piece of legislation this week that 
I think the House will vote on Friday. 
That is another $3 trillion. It is actu-
ally more than the previous four com-
bined. 
The legislation that she is proposing 
has a lot of items that aren’t directly 
related to the COVID–19 crisis. They 
are, as some have said, a wish list of 
priorities, and others have said in the 
media that it is more of a messaging 
bill. We will see. 
Among other things, it says, as an 
example, that they want to change the 
current law, which says that you are 
limited in terms of how much of a Fed-
eral tax deduction you can take for 
State and local taxes. That is called 
the SALT issue. They want to repeal 
that. That cost, by the way, is about 
$180 billion—something like that. It 
would result in about 50 percent of the 
tax benefit going to the top 1 percent 
of taxpayers. That doesn’t sound like 
something 
that 
is 
going 
to 
be 
impactful in terms of the coronavirus 
pandemic we face. 
I can think of a lot of better ways to 
spend that money, including more test-
ing, including ensuring that small busi-
nesses can get back on their feet, en-
suring that our healthcare system is 
sound, and other things. We are going 
to continue to work on that. 
My hope is that, as we did with the 
previous four, we can figure out a way 
to come together—Republicans, Demo-
crats, House, and Senate—and look at 
what we have already spent, $2.5 tril-
lion, and see how it has been spent, un-
derstand what some of the gaps might 
be and address those gaps. 
As we are working on this issue, this 
pandemic is continuing to wreak havoc 
all over the country. It has been dev-
astating, let’s face it. We now have 30 
million—30 
million—of 
our 
fellow 
Americans who have lost their jobs and 
are looking for unemployment insur-
ance. These are people who lost their 
jobs through no fault of their own. 
They lost their jobs because the pan-
demic infected the economy, and they 
don’t have a place to work. 
I know friends of mine, people I have 
known for a long time, who have never 
been unemployed and are unemployed 
now for the first time. They are getting 
unemployment insurance for the first 
time. They want to go back to work, 
but they don’t have a job right now. 
That has been devastating to them and 
to a lot of small businesses. I talked to 
people who have poured their lives and 
their resources into these businesses. A 
guy tells me, I have been doing this for 
40 years. I started with a couple of peo-
ple and got to a few more and a few 
more. And now, boom, my doors are 
closed. Think of the movie theaters 
and the bowling alleys and the small 
restaurants, the hotels, anything to 
doing with travel and tourism, and 
these businesses are in tough shape. So 
is the beauty parlor and the nail salon 
and the barbershop. 
This is testing our resolve in ways 
that we had never expected. I guess 
that is part of the point, we had never 
expected it because we weren’t pre-
pared for this kind of pandemic. 
Congress, again, has tried to help 
with these four measures we already 
passed. I think they have helped, par-
ticularly with a lot of the small busi-
nesses, and our healthcare system has 
been helped. Trillions of dollars—$2.5 
trillion of taxpayer funds have gone 
out to try to be a rescue package to 
help people weather this storm. 
Again, I hope the next package can 
be effective, not just in weathering the 
storm but also in getting the economy 
moving—more stimulus, giving small 
businesses the tax relief to encourage 
them to invest more and add more jobs, 
maybe some smart spending in terms 
of infrastructure; things like rural 
broadband that will create more jobs 
immediately but also bring us closer to 
having real access for people in poor 
areas of our country to be able to do 
the small business development, to do 
telehealth, to do telelearning through 
broadband. There are some things I 
think we can do that will actually help 
to stimulate more economic growth. 
As we work to address these prob-
lems at home, let’s not forget how we 
got here. My colleague from Wyoming 
just talked about this, but there is a 
clear consensus now about one thing, 
which is that this all started in Wuhan, 
China, which is a huge city in China, 
Hubei Province, and that information 
about this horrible virus was concealed 
by the Chinese Communist Party. Sys-
tematically and very deliberately they 
kept the rest of the world from know-
ing about it. 
By the way, they kept it from their 
own people too. To the point made ear-
lier, this is not about the Chinese peo-
ple. This is about the Chinese Govern-
ment, meaning the Chinese Communist 
Party, deciding: Oh, gosh. We have a 
problem here. Let’s not tell anybody— 
which goes against all the rules. If you 
are a country and you have a virus that 
is spreading, your responsibility—par-
ticularly as a member of the World 
Health Organization—is to tell your 
own people but also tell the rest of the 
world so that you can contain that 
virus. They concealed it, deliberately. 
They must be held accountable for 
that. 
Think of the devastation they have 
caused, not just in our country but 
around the world—the number of peo-
ple who have died, the people whose 
lives have been turned upside down, the 
economy that has been destroyed by 
this. 
This information, this critical infor-
mation, having been withheld from the 
Chinese people and from the world has 
had a devastating impact. At the start 
of this year, in January, apparently 
the Chinese Communist Party said: 
Don’t worry. There is no human-to- 
human transmission of this virus—no 
human-to-human transmission of this 
virus. They knew otherwise. 
By the way, 4 million cases world-
wide tell us they knew otherwise—4 
million cases. It all started in one 
place, in Wuhan, China. There are now 
4 million cases. 
This is something that is serious, and 
we need to address it. We are also told 
that the Chinese Communist Party al-
lowed people to travel from Hubei 
Province, from Wuhan city—not to 
other parts of China, apparently, but to 
the rest of the world. 
If they had cut off travel to places 
like Italy and the UK and the United 
States, we would not be where we are 
now. Luckily, our administration acted 
quickly to shut off immigration from 
China, from those hotspots, and for 
American citizens and the green card 
holders, they had to go into quar-
antine. That helped, but the virus was 
already here. 
Very disturbing to me is apparently 
some 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
disinformation went out claiming that 
America was at fault somehow. This 
was classic propaganda disinformation. 
It is adding insult to injury. Right? Not 
only did they not do what they should 
have done, to tell the world about this 
and to help us to be able to contain 
this virus—and, by the way, the World 
Health Organization was there to help 
them. We were there to help them. We 
offered to go in. They wouldn’t let the 
World 
Health 
Organization 
experts 
come in for well over a month after 
they knew. Some say it was a few

months because they probably knew it 
the end of last year. They must have, 
given the number of cases they had. 
They also kept the experts out from 
the United States who could have been 
helpful. 
The World Health Organization is an 
international body where you have 
membership, and they have require-
ments where you are required to report 
data. You are required to have them 
come in when you have a virus like 
this. Of course, we didn’t know it was a 
pandemic at the time, but we had a 
virus here that was concerning. In-
stead, it appears the World Health Or-
ganization, instead of being an early 
warning system for the rest of us, all 
around the world, which is what they 
should be—a virus starts, and they are 
the ones who go in and deal with it—in-
stead of being an early warning sys-
tem, in a sense, they were apologists 
for China. 
That is why some of us have called 
for an investigation of the World 
Health Organization. We have asked 
the United Nations to convene a spe-
cial panel, some of us, to be able to 
look into this issue so that it is not 
just America. The rest of the world 
ought to be involved in this as well. All 
of the members of the WHO ought to be 
concerned. I believe they are, about the 
deference they showed to China, at a 
time we needed them to be on the spot 
helping. 
We now find ourselves forced to rely 
on the source of the virus, China, for a 
lot of our PPE, personal protective 
equipment. Think of the masks and the 
gloves and the gowns that our frontline 
healthcare workers need and others 
who are now interfacing with cus-
tomers and working together as co-
workers. We have to rely on China for 
this. In order to safely treat the 
COVID–19 patients who are sick and be-
cause of this virus that originated in 
China, we now have to rely on China 
for this safety equipment. That is un-
fortunate, and that needs to change. 
We need to produce more of this here 
from more reliable sources. We are 
hearing reports about delays in ship-
ments now. We are hearing about poor 
quality products—all of this is com-
bining to affect our ability to be able 
to respond. 
The virus has brought pain and suf-
fering to our shores and to countries 
all around the world. Again, if they had 
followed the rules, if China had played 
by the rules—again, not the Chinese 
people who were also kept in the dark 
but the Chinese Communist Party—if 
they 
had 
followed 
the 
rules, 
we 
wouldn’t be in the situation we are in. 
By the way, none of this is news 
when it comes to China’s behavior on 
the international stage. Getting China 
to play by the rules has been a con-
stant theme of mine and others for a 
long time. 
Fifteen years ago, I was a U.S. Trade 
Representative, and I brought forward 
the first successful case against China 
in the World Trade Organization be-
cause they weren’t playing by the 
rules. I also wrote a report entitled 
‘‘Top to Bottom Review of U.S.-China 
Economic Relationship’’ that made 
policy recommendations to improve 
the equity, durability, and balance of 
our trade relationship with China. My 
No. 1 priority was China. 
When I was there, I established, for 
the first time, a USTR prosecutor just 
for China. One of the recommendations 
was supposed to put a negotiator in 
China from the U.S. Trade Rep’s office. 
It is there now. 
Here in the Senate, as the chair of 
the Senate Permanent Subcommittee 
on Investigations, I have now led three 
bipartisan investigations on China, in-
cluding the Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s use of what is called the Confucius 
Institute at our high schools, some-
times grade schools, at our colleges 
and universities. 
We learned more than 100 U.S. uni-
versities had allowed the Chinese Gov-
ernment to operate these centers, 
which often come with stipulations, re-
quiring them to comply with Chinese 
law—Chinese law—even when they are 
operating in the United States. We 
know some of these Confucius Insti-
tutes have been used as platforms for 
economic espionage. 
By the way, since we published our 
report in February of 2019, a year ago, 
more than 20 Confucius Institutes in 
the United States have closed their 
doors. 
Why? 
Because 
people 
have 
looked into this and determined this is 
not just a cultural exchange. This has 
other aspects to it; as an example, not 
being able to teach the real history of 
China, as if things like Tiananmen 
Square did not exist. That is not some-
thing we should allow to happen in this 
country. That doesn’t comply with our 
standards here of honesty and intellec-
tual standards that says you have to 
teach the actual history, not what the 
Chinese Communist Party says is the 
history. Our students shouldn’t be sub-
ject to that. 
These Confucius Institutes have also 
spent a lot of money in this country. 
Schools have taken money and have 
not properly reported it. That is what 
our report indicated. As a result, the 
Department of Education is now crack-
ing down on some of these schools to 
say you have to, at a minimum, report 
the funding. 
Our subcommittee is right now wrap-
ping up its review of three Chinese 
Government-owned telecom firms that 
the FCC, the Federal Communications 
Commission, licensed to operate here 
20 years ago. 
We share concerns with the Justice 
Department 
regarding 
these 
tele-
communications companies complying 
with U.S. law enforcement requests 
and whether these entities pose a na-
tional security risk by being vulner-
able to exploitation by the Chinese 
Government and the Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
Last year, the FCC denied a license 
to China Mobile to operate in the 
United States for these same reasons. 
That investigation is coming to a head. 
We are going to have a report coming 
out soon. We will learn more about 
this. But again, we have to be sure we 
are not naive; that we understand what 
is going on when these Chinese tele-
communications firms are here in this 
country. 
The third Permanent Subcommittee 
investigation involves another instance 
where China has not been playing by 
the rules as it relates to stealing U.S. 
research and technology, often paid for 
by 
U.S. 
taxpayers. 
Before 
the 
coronavirus put so much of our country 
on hold, we were preparing to intro-
duce legislation that was a result of 
our bipartisan report and our yearlong 
investigation. That report details how 
China has used what is called talent re-
cruitment 
programs, 
most 
notably 
what is called the Thousand Talents 
Plan, to steal U.S. taxpayer-funded re-
search. It turns out this has been going 
on for a long time. For 20 years, this 
has been going on. It has helped fuel 
the rise of the Chinese military and the 
Chinese economy during those 20 years. 
You might ask, how has this hap-
pened? 
Every 
year, 
Federal 
grantmaking agencies, like the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, the Depart-
ment of Energy’s National Labs, or the 
National Science Foundation, give out 
taxpayer dollars for research. By the 
way, it is about $150 billion a year. It is 
a lot of money. 
These 
are 
important 
research 
projects. This is a good thing for our 
country. It leads to new breakthroughs 
in science and technology. It is helping 
make the United States the world lead-
er in innovation. Your tax dollars com-
ing to Washington, going to the De-
partment of Energy, the National In-
stitutes 
of 
Health, 
and 
National 
Science Foundation, out to researchers 
and colleges and universities and re-
search institutes—$150 billion a year— 
have led to a lot of breakthroughs. 
The open and collaborative nature of 
research that is done here in the 
United States is one of the reasons we 
attract some of the best and brightest 
scientists and researchers from all 
around the world to take part in this 
research. Yet what we have learned— 
and through our report, we prove—is 
that this system is very vulnerable. It 
is vulnerable to theft by other coun-
tries, and that is exactly what is hap-
pening in the case of China. 
China has made it no secret that its 
goal is to surpass the United States as 
the world leader in scientific research. 
One way it has been doing that is by 
using secret contracts with researchers 
here in the United States. Again, it is 
doing research that is funded by tax 
dollars—medical research, scientific re-
search, military research. The Chinese 
Government has actually been paying 
these people to provide information to 
the Chinese Government to take this 
research and pay for it by U.S. tax dol-
lars. It is wrong, and it needs to stop, 
and our legislation is intended to do 
just that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2417 
May 13, 2020 
At one of our Senate hearings on the 
report, a State Department witness 
said: ‘‘The Chinese Communist Party 
has declared the Chinese university 
system to be on the front line of mili-
tary-civilian fusion efforts for tech-
nology acquisition.’’ 
In other words, the Chinese Com-
munist Party has decided this talent 
recruitment program is going to be 
well funded. We are going to pay Amer-
ican researchers to give us their stuff 
but then also to connect them to the 
Chinese university system, which the 
Chinese Communist Party is using as 
the way to get technology, to acquire 
technology. Again, it is not a new prob-
lem. This has been going on for two 
decades, but we have done little in this 
country to stop it because we have this 
history of being so open and accessible 
with our research. 
The FBI came to our hearing and ac-
knowledged this. From the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation, they said that 
‘‘it should have taken more rapid and 
comprehensive action in the past’’ to 
respond to these Chinese talent re-
cruitment programs. Yes, they should 
have. Yes, they should have. 
Fortunately, the FBI and the Depart-
ment of Justice have now taken a dif-
ferent approach. They have begun step-
ping up their efforts this year with sev-
eral recent high-profile arrests and 
having charges filed, but, again, more 
laws and practices need to change to 
stop 
U.S. 
taxpayer-funded 
research 
from being stolen in this way to benefit 
our No. 1 global competitor, which is 
why we are introducing this legisla-
tion. 
The legislation is called the Safe-
guarding American Innovation Act—to 
protect 
American 
research 
and 
strengthen our national security. The 
legislation makes five necessary re-
forms to address the flaws in our cur-
rent research enterprise and to stop in-
tellectual property theft and promote a 
more secure and transparent process 
that 
is 
consistent 
with 
the 
rec-
ommendations we laid out in our re-
port. 
First, the report found numerous 
cases of U.S.-funded researchers who 
failed to disclose foreign sources of 
compensation on their Federal grant 
applications. This issue has been high-
lighted this year. You have probably 
heard about it because you may re-
member that earlier this year there 
was the shocking arrest of Dr. Charles 
Lieber, the chair of Harvard Univer-
sity’s Chemistry Department, who was 
being paid both by Harvard and the 
Thousand Talents program by the Chi-
nese Communist Party, it turns out. 
According to the FBI, without Har-
vard’s knowledge—he didn’t tell Har-
vard—Dr. Lieber was being paid up to 
$50,000 a month in salary by the Chi-
nese, $150,000 annually for living ex-
penses, and more than $1.5 million to 
establish and run a shadow lab in 
China. Interestingly, the lab was in 
Wuhan, China. None of this was dis-
closed on his Federal grant application 
from which he got U.S. taxpayer 
money. If it had been disclosed, he 
wouldn’t have gotten the money. That 
is just wrong. 
The criminal complaint is based on 
his not telling the truth to the Federal 
investigators, even though he was es-
sentially defrauding Harvard and de-
frauding the U.S. Government’s fund-
ing sources, but that is not a crime. 
Failing to disclose compensation from 
a foreign government is not currently a 
crime. We make it a crime. That is 
part of our legislation. The bill gives 
the Justice Department the ability to 
hold Federal grant recipients account-
able for hiding their financial ties to 
foreign governments by failing to dis-
close them on Federal grant applica-
tions. Transparency and honesty on 
grant applications is critical to the in-
tegrity of the U.S. research enterprise 
and to stopping this theft. That is in 
our legislation. 
Second, despite there being more 
than $150 billion in taxpayer funding 
going to these Federal research agen-
cies every year, there is no unified 
tracking process to determine where 
these funds go. The National Science 
Foundation, for instance, doesn’t have 
anyone who handles grant oversight. 
Again, we have been too lax. That is 
why the bill requires the Federal Office 
of Management and Budget, the OMB, 
to 
streamline 
and 
coordinate 
grantmaking between the agencies to 
ensure that the billions of taxpayer 
dollars going to research every year 
can be accounted for every step of the 
way. Having this information is also 
going to save time and money for our 
research institutions and our univer-
sities. They will now know where the 
funding is, where it is going, and how it 
is being used. 
Third, the State Department is on 
the frontline here in vetting visa appli-
cations for visiting scholars and vis-
iting students, but it is not permitted 
to deny visas to individuals who come 
from overseas who are intent on steal-
ing U.S. research. That is just wrong. 
Our research enterprise in this country 
must remain open. We agree with that, 
for we want to attract people from 
around the world, of course, but we 
have to have commonsense safeguards 
to prevent bad actors from taking ad-
vantage of our openness. The legisla-
tion does that. It authorizes the State 
Department to deny visas to foreign re-
searchers who seek to access sensitive 
U.S. research when it is determined 
that doing so will pose a threat to our 
economic or to our national security. 
By the way, the State Department 
wants this authority. The career offi-
cers who came and testified before us 
said we would like to have this author-
ity because we know we are letting 
people in who are coming for one rea-
son and one reason only, and that is to 
take U.S. research. 
Fourth, our report detailed a system-
atic lack of knowledge at the U.S. re-
search institutions about the threat 
posed by the Thousand Talents Plan 
and other forms of academic espionage. 
For example, we found that the Thou-
sand Talents program had recruited a 
member who downloaded more than 
30,000 files from a Department of En-
ergy National Lab. These are our top 
National Labs in the country—highly 
secretive. There were 30,000 files that 
were downloaded without authoriza-
tion, of course, and that researcher 
took those files with him back to 
China. Our bill requires that research 
institutions have safeguards in place to 
prohibit the unauthorized access to 
sensitive research. They have to tight-
en it up. 
Finally, we found that nearly 70 per-
cent of U.S. universities have consist-
ently failed to report substantial for-
eign gifts as required by current law. 
Our bill ensures transparency by re-
quiring universities now to report any 
foreign gift of $50,000 or more and em-
powering the Department of Education 
to fine universities. These are new 
fines to universities that repeatedly 
fail to disclose these gifts. 
Now, there are some in the univer-
sity community who don’t love our leg-
islation. I would just ask them: Given 
what has happened, given what we 
know is happening in terms of the theft 
of U.S. research, are you really going 
to stand in the way of legislation that 
just says you have to report when you 
receive more than $50,000 from a for-
eign government? Is that too much to 
ask? I don’t think so. 
Right now, they are supposed to re-
port gifts of a higher level, and 70 per-
cent of them have failed to do so. So it 
is not too much to ask, and I would 
hope that the university community 
will be supportive. Many are, but some 
are apparently saying they are going to 
try to block this legislation. 
Don’t do that. That would be wrong. 
The failure to stop the coronavirus 
early on has highlighted how China 
does not play by the rules, whether 
they be the World Health Organiza-
tion’s rules or the trade rules we 
talked about earlier, and now it is with 
regard to this issue that we are dealing 
with in terms of taking U.S. research 
back to China in order to fuel China’s 
military and China’s economy. 
When this pandemic passes and our 
universities and research institutions 
reopen their doors, I have no doubt 
that we will, once again, continue to 
attract the best and the brightest. 
Why? Because our research enterprise 
is the best. We are innovators, and we 
provide funding for it, and we have 
such great opportunities here in this 
country to do research. People like to 
come here, but we cannot sit idly by as 
our top global competitor steals that 
research. The Safeguarding American 
Innovation Act is an important step to-
ward protecting it for the safety and 
security of every American. 
Now, more than ever, we have to 
adapt to the fact that China is not 
going to play by the same set of rules 
as the rest of the world. It has been 15 
years since we put out a USTR report

stating that our relationship with 
China lacks ‘‘equity, durability,’’ and 
sustainability. 
Right now, our No. 1 priority is solv-
ing the coronavirus crisis. We have to 
do that. There is no question that it 
ought to be our focus. Yet, in the con-
text of this crisis, we also need to re-
evaluate how we do business with 
China. We have to look at this with 
fresh eyes. My hope is that this legisla-
tion we have talked about this evening 
will help to allow us to reset the way 
we conduct our research so we can con-
tinue to reward those who come to our 
shores to discover new breakthroughs 
in science and technology while we 
keep China and other nation-state 
competitors from stealing that re-
search for their own purposes. We can 
achieve that balance, and we must. 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to 
our police officers all around the coun-
try. The men and women in blue serve 
us every day in Ohio and every State 
represented in this Chamber. This week 
is National Police Week. In normal 
times, right now we would have tens of 
thousands of officers here in town. 
They do a big parade every year. We 
have them in our offices. We get to 
meet with them and thank them for 
their service. We would be able to have 
the opportunity to hear their stories— 
to hear some of the brave, brave stories 
of those who have lost their lives over 
the past year. They do a wonderful 
presentation down at the memorial to 
thank and pay tribute to those officers. 
Yet, even during this coronavirus, I 
am pleased that, this Friday, folks 
around the country will be showing 
their support anyway. They can’t come 
here in person, but people are going to 
be displaying blue ribbons and blue 
lights on their homes. The service to 
our communities that these police offi-
cers give us every day has been more 
valuable during this crisis than it has 
ever been, and I thank those police offi-
cers for going out every day and put-
ting their health right now and even 
their lives, as they always do, on the 
line for all of us. 
As I said earlier, I want to be sure 
that our municipalities and our coun-
ties have the ability to pay those po-
lice officers so as to keep them out on 
the street. That is why we need the 
flexibility in the Federal funding that 
is going out because the budgets of 
these municipalities are constrained. 
Because of the bad economy—because 
of the coronavirus—we have to be sure 
that police officers are taken care of. 
This week, National Police Week, is a 
time of pause, a time to think about 
the sacrifices these heroes make every 
day in order to keep our communities 
safe, which is what they do every sin-
gle day. They take dangerous criminals 
and weapons and drugs off of our 
streets. They enforce the laws we write 
here in this body. We write a lot of 
laws here. They are the ones who are in 
the trenches—on the frontlines—en-
forcing them. Even their very presence 
helps to deter crime and keep our com-
munities safer. So we thank them for 
the risks they take for themselves, and 
we thank their families for the sac-
rifices they make for all of us. 
This week is a time to think about 
the police officers in our country who 
have died in the line of service over the 
last year. Again, this would normally 
be done in person down at the memo-
rial, but I want to talk about the four 
brave individuals who have lost their 
lives in Ohio since we last had a Na-
tional Police Week, which was a year 
ago. 
In 
January, 
Officer 
Dale 
James 
Woods, of the Colerain Police Depart-
ment in Southwest Ohio, was trag-
ically struck and killed by a vehicle 
while he was responding to a traffic 
stop. Officer Woods devoted his entire 
life to public service. He served for 15 
years in the town’s fire department— 
the Colerain Fire Department—and 
then 15 years as a police officer. He did 
everything that could be asked of an 
officer. They tell me sometimes he 
would be staffing the dispatch station. 
The next day, he would be tracking 
down a lost dog. The next day, he 
would be out there helping a citizen 
with a complaint. He did everything 
that was asked of him with unwavering 
professionalism and the commitment 
that we all come to expect from our po-
lice officers. 
Officer James Woods of the Colerain 
Police Department, thank you. 
The same can be said for Clermont 
County Sheriff’s Deputy William Lee 
Brewer, Jr., who died in the line of 
duty in February of 2019 during a 
standoff with a criminal. Deputy Bill 
Brewer was a 20-year veteran of the 
force. He was a local guy, someone 
whom everyone in the community 
knew and loved. He gave his life for 
that community—the ultimate sac-
rifice an officer can make. I attended 
his funeral and had the opportunity to 
meet a lot of his fellow officers and 
hear stories about him. I also got a 
chance to meet his wonderful family. I 
can say he was admired and respected 
by all. The turnout for that funeral was 
unbelievable. 
Last November, we lost Detective 
Jorge Del Rio, a decorated 30-year vet-
eran of the Dayton Police Department. 
Detective Del Rio had been working 
with the DEA, the Drug Enforcement 
Agency, on a task force to crack down 
on drugs coming into a community 
that had been ravaged by the opioid 
crisis. This was during a time when 
Dayton was one of the communities in 
the country that had the most opioid 
overdoses and all of the crime related 
to that, and Jorge Del Rio was there to 
help. He was shot twice in the face 
while serving a warrant in relation to 
an investigation into drugs. From the 
crime scene, investigators recovered 
cash, fentanyl—the deadliest of all the 
opioids—and marijuana, along with 
weapons. Detective Del Rio fought 
bravely for his life, but in the end, his 
wounds were too much to bear. 
This is an issue that is very personal 
to me. I have spent a lot of my time 
working on this drug crisis and trying 
to get Congress to pass legislation to 
stop this addiction so that officers like 
Detective Del Rio don’t have to fight 
and die in fighting this scourge in our 
communities. 
I was honored to attend Detective 
Del Rio’s visitation, where I joined 
hundreds of grateful citizens in an 
arena. Again, the turnout was unbe-
lievable with fellow officers, DEA offi-
cers, and police officers. Officers came 
from all over the region. When I spoke 
with Kathy—his wife—and their fam-
ily, I told them his sacrifice was not in 
vain and that he would always be re-
membered as a hero of Dayton, OH. 
Earlier this spring, we lost another 
hero, Springdale Police Officer Kaia 
LaFay Grant. On March 21, Officer 
Grant was helping her fellow officers 
chase down a suspect who was fleeing 
by car. During the pursuit, the crimi-
nal deliberately rammed his vehicle 
into her cruiser, which caused her to 
crash. Officer Grant’s injuries, sadly, 
were fatal. An 8-year veteran of the 
force, she was the first ever casualty of 
the Springdale Police Department and 
the first female law enforcement offi-
cer in the tristate area to die in the 
line of duty in more than 100 years. Of-
ficer Grant was only 33 years old. My 
thoughts are with her family as they 
deal with this tragic loss. 
Although these heroic officers were 
taken from us, their examples can 
never be taken away and will not be. 
Ohioans will remember them as models 
of bravery and service, as examples of 
fellow citizens who, on behalf of all of 
the rest of us, have the habit of walk-
ing into danger rather than running 
away from it. 
In our Nation’s history, more than 
24,000 police officers have died in the 
line of duty. Think about that—24,000. 
Serving as an officer is a dangerous 
job, I know, but we have legislation 
that we think would help save the lives 
of some of those officers who put them-
selves in harm’s way. 
I was proud to join colleagues last 
year in sponsoring legislation called 
the Back the Blue Act. It is very sim-
ple. It says, if you target law enforce-
ment officers, you are going to pay a 
very, very high price. That is appro-
priate. We think Back the Blue Act, 
which would increase penalties on 
those who would attempt to harm or 
kill a police officer, is going to make a 
difference because it will send a very 
strong message in helping to deter 
some of these crimes. Ultimately, I 
think that it will make our heroes in 
blue safer and help to save lives. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in standing tall with our police offi-
cers and thanking them this week for 
what they do every day to protect us. 
Let’s back the blue. Let’s do every-
thing we can to ensure that our police 
officers know we are with them and 
that we are at their side as they do 
their critical job every day to protect 
us.

I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon 
tomorrow, the Senate vote in relation 
to the Paul amendment to H.R. 6172, if 
offered. I further ask that at 1:30 p.m. 
tomorrow, the Senate vote on the pas-
sage of H.R. 6172, as amended, as under 
the order of March 16. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
CONFIRMATION OF TROY D. 
EDGAR 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise in opposition to the confirmation 
of Troy Edgar to be Chief Financial Of-
ficer of the Department of Homeland 
Security. 
The nominee would have authority 
over the transfer and reprogramming 
of funds within the Department of 
Homeland 
Security. 
While 
he 
has 
pledged to notify Congress in advance 
of any such action, this administration 
has made it clear that it will continue 
to use every available tool to fund the 
wall that President Trump said Mexico 
would pay for and his administration’s 
abusive immigrant detention policies. 
For that reason, any nominee to this 
position merits heightened scrutiny. 
I am alarmed by rampant over-
crowding and squalid conditions in 
DHS detention facilities. Despite DHS 
IG reports and numerous congressional 
inquiries and hearings, the Department 
has consistently mismanaged these fa-
cilities and shown a disregard for the 
care of those in its custody. To date, 
674 detainees and 39 detention facility 
personnel have tested positive for 
COVID–19. Notwithstanding its failure 
to ensure the safety of its facility per-
sonnel and detainees, the Department 
has continued to use its transfer and 
reprogramming authority to increase 
the number of detention beds. Last Au-
gust, 
DHS 
transferred 
or 
repro-
grammed $271 million, including $155 
million from the FEMA Disaster Relief 
Fund, to expand ICE operations at the 
southern border. 
A promise to notify Congress does 
nothing to stop these activities. I am 
confident that anything short of a stat-
utory limitation on transfer and re-
programming authority will be ignored 
and that any official who stands in the 
way of these efforts will be cir-
cumvented or fired. The Senate should 
not confirm a nominee with the power 
to approve such actions until reason-
able limits are enacted into law. For 
that reason, I voted against this nomi-
nee. 
f 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, 
our Nation commemorates National 
Police Week in May, bringing together 
law enforcement officers, families, and 
public safety advocates from across the 
country to the Nation’s Capital to pay 
respect to law enforcement officers 
who lost their lives in the line of duty 
last year. 
The coronavirus outbreak in our 
country has disrupted the public trib-
utes in Washington and in commu-
nities across the country. However, 
COVID–19 will not diminish our heart-
felt gratitude to the fallen and those 
they left behind. This year, an online 
virtual candlelight vigil has replaced 
an in-person national ceremony to 
honor fallen officers from across the 
Nation. 
Sadly, the State of Mississippi lost 
four officers in the line of duty last 
year. These brave men are being recog-
nized this week, and their names have 
been added to the National Law En-
forcement Memorial here in Wash-
ington, DC. 
On 
May 
5, 
2019, 
Officer 
Robert 
McKeithen, 58, of Biloxi, was ambushed 
and tragically murdered. An Air Force 
veteran, Office McKeithen served with 
the Biloxi Police Department for 24 
years and planned on retiring by the 
end of the year. He was dearly loved by 
his family, friends, and fellow officers. 
Constable Willie West, known as 
Hoot, was first elected in 1971 as con-
stable of Lowndes County District 1 
and was serving his 13th consecutive 
term. He had previously served with 
the Columbus Police Department and 
Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office. He 
had a total of 52 years of law enforce-
ment service and was a founding mem-
ber and first president of the Mis-
sissippi Constables Association. On 
May 6, 2019, Constable West was serv-
ing civil papers when his vehicle struck 
a tree. He succumbed to his injuries a 
few days later at the age of 81, leaving 
behind a son, two daughters, five 
grandchildren, 
five 
great-grand-
children, his mother, brother, and two 
sisters. 
Chickasaw County Deputy Sheriff 
Jeremy Voyles died in a single auto-
mobile crash while conducting an in-
vestigation on August 27, 2019. He was 
assigned to the North Mississippi Nar-
cotics Unit. Prior to joining the sher-
iff’s department, Voyles served as a law 
enforcement 
officer 
with 
the 
Mis-
sissippi Department of Transportation. 
He is survived by his wife, two young 
children, and his parents. 
On December 12, 2019, Panola County 
Constable Eula Ray ‘‘Raye’’ Hawkins, 
57, was killed when his vehicle was 
struck by a stolen pickup truck being 
pursued by other officers. Constable 
Hawkins served in law enforcement for 
29 years. He is survived by his son, who 
serves with the Batesville Police De-
partment, a daughter, one grandson, 
and two sisters. 
I join the families, fellow officers, 
and communities of these four Mis-
sissippi officers, who dedicated them-
selves to bravely serving the people of 
my State, honoring their lives with a 
deep sense of gratitude for their serv-
ice. 
My heart aches any time a law en-
forcement officer is lost, whether it is 
in the line of duty or not. Their names 
may not grace a national memorial, 
but their service still merits recogni-
tion. 
For instance, long-time Lawrence 
County 
Deputy 
Sheriff 
Robert 
Ainsworth and his wife, Paula, were 
among the 14 Mississippians who lost 
their lives in terrible tornadoes that 
hit my State on Easter Sunday. In his 
last act, Deputy Ainsworth, a Marine 
Corps veteran who died trying to shield 
his wife from harm, demonstrated the 
selflessness and bravery that is char-
acteristic of so many in law enforce-
ment. 
Law enforcement officers risk their 
lives daily to help keep us safe, and 
any loss of an officer profoundly affects 
entire communities. My admiration for 
the law enforcement community, who 
remain deeply dedicated despite the 
dangers 
of 
their 
noble 
profession, 
knows no bounds. We acknowledge 
their brave service and fortify our sup-
port of their work to serve and protect 
our families and our communities.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–193. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of New Jersey urging the 
federal government to create a federal 
COVID–19 Business and Employee Continuity 
and Recovery Fund; to the Committee on 
Appropriations. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 65 
Whereas, The United States faces an un-
precedented public health crisis in the form 
of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; and 
Whereas, There have already been over 
15,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 
2019 in the State of New Jersey and that 
number is expected to climb higher through-
out the month of April and beyond; and 
Whereas, Under Executive Order 107, the 
Governor has directed all residents to re-
main at home until further notice, in an ef-
fort to promote social distancing and stop 
the spread of the disease through personal 
contact; and 
Whereas, Social distancing has caused con-
siderable business disruption, with many 
businesses closed or operating at a reduced 
capacity indefinitely; and 
Whereas, This has caused considerable fi-
nancial hardship to employees who have 
been laid off, furloughed, or are working re-
duced hours, and to business owners who 
have seen a considerable reduction in in-
come; and 
Whereas, This situation is consistent in 
every state in the country, and even those 
states that have not enacted orders to stay 
at home have seen economic hardships re-
sulting from voluntary social distancing; and 
Whereas, Without government interven-
tion, this large-scale business disruption will 
result in rampant unemployment, long-term 
damage to financial markets, and irrep-
arable harm to communities across the coun-
try; and 
Whereas, Government intervention in the 
form of the provision of liquidity to affected 
businesses would be of considerable assist-
ance to any business, regardless of industry, 
location, or size; and 
Whereas, The proposed COVID–19 Business 
and Employee Continuity and Recovery 
Fund allows for the distribution of federal 
funds and liquidity to impacted businesses 
and their employees; and 
Whereas, Funding provided by the COVID– 
19 Business and Employee Continuity and 
Recovery Fund will help businesses retain 
and rehire employees, maintain worker bene-
fits, and meet operating expense obligations, 
and includes strong anti-abuse provisions, 
including audits and Special Inspector Gen-
eral oversight; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2421 
May 13, 2020 
Whereas, Federal assistance is therefore 
needed to help all businesses in the State 
and in the country; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the Senate of the State of New 
Jersey: 
1. This House respectfully urges the Presi-
dent of the United States and the United 
States Congress to support the creation of 
the COVID–19 Business and Employee Con-
tinuity and Recovery Fund. 
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted 
by the Secretary of the Senate to the Presi-
dent and Vice President of the United 
States, the Majority and Minority Leader of 
the United States Senate, the Speaker and 
Minority Leader of the United States House 
of Representatives, and to every member of 
the Congress elected from this State. 
POM–194. A joint memorial adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Washington re-
spectfully requesting that Congress take the 
appropriate steps to restore federal benefits 
to Compacts of Free Association (COFA) mi-
grants; to the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources. 
SUBSTITUTE SENATE JOINT MEMORIAL NO. 8017 
Whereas, Since 1986, Compacts of Free As-
sociation (COFA) between the Republic of 
the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, 
the Federated States of Micronesia (Chuuk, 
Kosrae, Yap, Pohnpei), and the United States 
allow citizens of nations with COFA agree-
ments to serve in the United States military 
and enter, lawfully reside, and work in the 
United States; and 
Whereas, The relationship between the na-
tions with Compacts of Free Association and 
the United States includes economic devel-
opment and a military presence; and 
Whereas, The region served as a testing 
ground for atmospheric nuclear weapons be-
tween 1946 and 1958, which resulted in past 
and current inhabitants being exposed to 
high levels of radioactive fallout; and 
Whereas, When the Compacts were origi-
nally signed, COFA migrants were eligible 
for Medicaid and other federal programs; and 
Whereas, Despite paying state and federal 
taxes, these migrants were excluded from 
benefits as a consequence of the federal Per-
sonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity 
Reconciliation Act in 1996; and 
Whereas, This ineligibility for federal 
health programs has exacerbated barriers to 
health care access for this population, which 
has led to poorer health outcomes and in-
creased, long-term costs on the health care 
system as a whole; and 
Whereas, Research shows that people liv-
ing in households in which the primary lan-
guage spoken at home is not English, sen-
iors, people with disabilities, and people who 
identify as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Is-
landers are disproportionately impacted by 
health inequities; and 
Whereas, Washington state has the second- 
largest population of Kosraeans and the 
third-largest population of Palauans and 
Marshallese people in the United States ac-
cording to the 2010 United States Census; and 
Whereas, Washington recognized the need 
to help address health inequities by pro-
viding support for citizens of nations with 
COFA agreements in need of food, medical, 
and dental care assistance in Washington 
state; and 
Whereas, Washington state continues to 
advocate, alongside other states, for congres-
sional legislation to restore federal benefits 
for COFA communities who continue to pro-
vide military service at higher rates than 
the overall population of the United States 
and valuable economic and cultural con-
tributions in the United States; and 
Whereas, The COFA communities in Wash-
ington are engaged in providing feedback re-
garding COFA renewal and participated in 
listening sessions as part of the recent 
United States Government Accountability 
Office study of COFA migrants in the United 
States in the fall of 2019; 
Now, therefore, Your Memorialists respect-
fully request that Congress take the appro-
priate steps to: Restore federal benefits for 
COFA migrants, the including Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid; 
ensure that citizens of nations with COFA 
agreements are appropriately counted as 
part of the 2020 census; consider the unique-
ness of COFA status in all immigration poli-
cies, including exempting citizens of nations 
with COFA agreements from changes to the 
public charge rules; and immediately begin 
work on COFA renewal negotiations; be it 
Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be 
immediately transmitted to the Honorable 
Donald J. Trump, President of the United 
States, the President of the United States 
Senate, the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives, and each member of Congress 
from the State of Washington. 
POM–195. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Alaska requesting 
the Secretary of the Treasury to mint not 
less than 5,000,000 $1 coins, honoring Eliza-
beth Peratrovich under the Native American

Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 9 
Whereas Elizabeth Peratrovich, of the 
Tlingit Nation, was an important civil rights 
activist who fought for equality for Alaska

Whereas Elizabeth Peratrovich advocated

Whereas, in 1988, the Alaska State Legisla-
ture established February 16 of each year as

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
575—RE-
AFFIRMING A STRONG COMMIT-
MENT TO UNITED STATES PRO-
DUCERS 
AND 
COMMODITIES 
MADE IN THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. 
TESTER 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
ROUNDS, Mr. DAINES, Mr. THUNE, and 
Mr. BOOKER) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Finance: 
S. RES. 575 
Whereas the farmers and ranchers of the 
United States raise the best beef in the 
world; 
Whereas consumers have a right to know-
ingly buy products made in the United 
States; 
Whereas farmers, ranchers, workers, and 
consumers in the United States benefit from 
transparency regarding the origin of food; 
Whereas Congress overwhelmingly sup-
ported 
country-of-origin 
labeling 
(also 
known as ‘‘COOL’’) in the Food, Conserva-
tion, and Energy Act of 2008 (Public Law 110– 
246; 122 Stat. 1651) because 87 percent of con-
sumers want to know the country of origin 
of the meat those consumers purchase; 
Whereas, in 2015, Congress repealed the law 
requiring country-of-origin labeling for beef, 
reducing the competitive advantage of prod-
ucts born, raised, and slaughtered in the 
United States; 
Whereas there is no standardized definition 
of 
the 
term 
‘‘truth 
in 
labeling’’, 
disadvantaging producers in the United 
States; 
Whereas Congress supports products made 
in the United States, and consumers deserve 
to know where their food comes from; 
Whereas the United States has the highest 
phytosanitary standards in the world, while 
other countries place less emphasis on food 
safety; 
Whereas foreign commodities, such as beef, 
are misleadingly labeled ‘‘Product of USA’’ 
if those commodities are processed or packed 
in the United States; 
Whereas technological advancements make 
it possible to accurately and efficiently iden-
tify the origin of beef without costly seg-
regation of imported and domestic commod-
ities, giving producers and consumers the 
ability to distinguish between beef actually 
produced in the United States and foreign, 
imported beef; and 
Whereas country-of-origin labeling is good 
for farmers, ranchers, workers, and packers 
because it allows those individuals to iden-
tify their products as born and raised in the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate urges the Presi-
dent to require the United States Trade Rep-
resentative to enter into the trade negotia-
tions necessary to implement mandatory 
country-of-origin labeling for beef, in order 
to allow consumers to make an informed and 
free choice about where their food comes 
from.

Whereas public safety telecommunicators 
play a critical role in emergency response; 
Whereas the work performed by public 
safety telecommunicators goes far beyond 
merely relaying information between the 
public and first responders; 
Whereas, when responding to reports of 
missing, abducted, and sexually exploited 
children, the information obtained and ac-
tions taken by public safety telecommunica-
tors form the foundation for an effective re-
sponse; 
Whereas the first contact that a hostage 
taker or a suicidal person makes when that 
person calls 9–1–1 is with a public safety tele-
communicator, whose negotiation skills can 
prevent the situation from getting worse; 
Whereas, during active shooter incidents, 
public safety telecommunicators coach call-
ers through first aid and give advice to pre-
vent further harm, all while collecting vital 
information to provide situational awareness 
for responding officers; 
Whereas the work of public safety tele-
communicators comes with an extreme emo-
tional and physical impact that is com-
pounded by long hours and the around-the- 
clock nature of the job; 
Whereas public safety telecommunicators 
should be recognized by all levels of govern-
ment for the lifesaving and protective nature 
of the work that public safety telecommu-
nicators perform; and 
Whereas major emergencies, such as the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pan-
demic, highlight the dedication of public 
safety telecommunicators and the important 
work performed by public safety telecommu-
nicators to protect the public and police, 
fire, and emergency medical officials: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors and recognizes the important 
and lifesaving contributions of public safety 
telecommunicators and other public safety 
communications professionals across the 
United States; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to remember the value of the work 
performed by public safety telecommunica-
tors and other public safety communications 
professionals.

SCOTT of South Carolina, and Mr. CAS-
SIDY) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 577 
Whereas Federal, State, local, and Tribal 
police officers, sheriffs, and other law en-
forcement officers across the United States 
serve with valor, dignity, and integrity; 
Whereas 
law 
enforcement officers are 
charged with— 
(1) pursuing justice for all individuals; and 
(2) performing the duties of a law enforce-
ment officer with fidelity to the constitu-
tional and civil rights of the public the offi-
cers serve; 
Whereas law enforcement officers swear an 
oath to uphold the public trust even though, 
through the performance of the duties of a 
law enforcement officer, the officers may be-
come targets for senseless acts of violence; 
Whereas law enforcement officers have 
bravely continued to meet the call of duty to 
ensure the security of their neighborhoods 
and communities at the risk of their own 
personal safety in the time of a viral pan-
demic; 
Whereas the resolve to service is clearly 
demonstrated by law enforcement officers 
across the country who have tragically fall-
en ill or passed away due to complications of 
COVID–19 contracted in the line of duty; 
Whereas, in 1962, President John Fitzgerald 
Kennedy signed Public Law 87–726 (36 U.S.C. 
136) (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘Joint Resolution’’), which authorizes the 
President to proclaim May 15 of every year 
as ‘‘Peace Officers Memorial Day’’ in honor 
of the Federal, State, and local officers who 
have been killed, disabled, or otherwise in-
jured in the line of duty; 
Whereas the Joint Resolution also author-
izes the President to designate the week in 
which Peace Officers Memorial Day falls as 
‘‘National Police Week’’; 
Whereas the National Law Enforcement 
Officers Memorial, dedicated on October 15, 
1991, is the national monument to honor 
those law enforcement officers who have died 
in the line of duty; 
Whereas Peace Officers Memorial Day, 
2020, honors the 185 law enforcement officers 
killed in the line of duty during 2019, includ-
ing— 
(1) Brian R. Abbondandelo; 
(2) Jacob O. Allmendinger; 
(3) Luis G. Alvarez;

(3) It is essential that people in the United 
States have access to a 3-digit national sui-
cide hotline across all geographic locations.

will need to be both familiar and recogniz-
able to all people in the United States.

have the highest rate of suicide of any racial 
or ethnic group in the United States with a 
suicide rate over 3.5 times higher than the 
racial or ethnic group with the lowest rate, 
with the suicide rate increasing, since 1999, 
by 139 percent for American Indian women 
and 71 percent for men; 
(3) between 2001 and 2015, the suicide death 
rate in rural counties in the United States 
was 17.32 per 100,000 individuals, which is sig-
nificantly greater than the national average, 
and the data shows that between that same 
time period, suicide rates increased for all 
age groups across all counties in the United 
States, with the highest rates and the great-
est increases being in more rural counties;

CELEBRATING ASIAN PACIFIC 
AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 13, 2020 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, our country 
has officially observed each May since 1992 
as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, 
recognizing the extraordinary contributions of 
our Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pa-
cific Islander (AANHPI) community to the rich 
fabric and history of our nation. 
May is especially important to me as the 
proud Representative of Hawaii’s First Con-
gressional District with the largest population 
of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pa-
cific Islanders of any district in our country. 
For over a century and continuing through the 
present and into tomorrow, Hawaii has pro-
duced repeated accomplished AANHPI ‘‘firsts’’ 
in government who have left a lasting impact 
on our state and country, including Territorial 
Delegate Jonah Ku¯hio¯ Kalaniana‘ole, Senator 
Hiram Fong, Senator Daniel Inouye, Senator 
Daniel Akaka, Congresswoman Patsy Mink, 
Governors John Waihe‘e, Ben Cayetano and 
George Ariyoshi, as well as my current col-
leagues Senator MAZIE HIRONO and Congress-
woman TULSI GABBARD. I am also proud to 
have served as a young staffer on Capitol Hill 
for my own mentor, the late Senator Spark 
Matsunaga. 
But the accomplishments of Hawaii’s Asian 
American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Is-
lander community extend well beyond the 
realm of politics and government into all areas 
of our society including science, law, sports, 
business, music, arts and culture and more. 
We are so proud to remember individuals like 
astronaut Ellison Onizuka, Judge Herbert 
Choy, entrepreneur Robert Taira, singer Don 
Ho, Olympic swimmer Duke Kahanamoku, 
golfer Michelle Wie, Native Hawaiian navigator 
Nainoa Thompson, boxer Brian Viloria, actor 
Jason Momoa, singer and songwriter Bruno 
Mars and so many more. 
The year 2020 also marks the 120th anni-
versary of Okinawan immigration to Hawaii. 
On January 8, 1900, twenty-six men from Oki-
nawa arrived in Honolulu as part of the first 
group of contract laborers. Like so many other 
AANHPI communities, Okinawan immigrants 
initially faced discrimination but through their 
own hard work and sacrifice, our Okinawan 
community has contributed deeply to the eco-
nomic achievements and cultural richness of 
our state. Today, persons of Okinawan de-
scent are deeply integrated into Hawaii’s polit-
ical, economic and social life, and I am proud 
to serve as their Representative here in Con-
gress. 
In Hawaii and across America, AANHPI 
communities are as diverse as they are ac-
complished. But while our country has made 
significant progress in increasing visibility and 
expanding opportunities for all Asian Ameri-
cans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, 
there is much work still to be done. Disparities 
in economic opportunity, education, health 
care and more between AANHPI and other 
communities and within subgroups of our 
AANHPI community persist. 
These disparities have become all the more 
apparent amidst this COVID–19 pandemic. 
Across our country, Native Hawaiian and Pa-
cific Islander communities have been espe-
cially hard hit, reporting infection rates up to 
three times higher than the rest of the popu-
lation. At the same time, across the country, 
Americans of Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pa-
cific Islander descent are working on the front 
lines to care for their fellow Americans and 
keep our country going. Their strength and re-
silience alongside our fellow Americans are 
truly inspiring. As a member of executive 
board of our Congressional Asian Pacific 
American Caucus, I will continue to work to 
protect the health and wellbeing of our entire 
AANHPI community both in Hawaii and across 
the country during this difficult time. 
During this Asian Pacific American Heritage 
Month, while we celebrate the accomplish-
ments of Asian American, Native Hawaiian 
and Pacific Islander communities in my dis-
trict, in Hawaii and across America, we must 
also rededicate ourselves to continuing to em-
power and uplift all Asian American, Native 
Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities 
and individuals.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CHANGE 
OF COMMAND OF COLONEL TER-
RENCE A. ADAMS 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 13, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the Change of Com-
mand of Colonel Terrence A. Adams, whose 
presence will be greatly missed in the 
Lowcountry. 
Before joining the Air Force, Colonel Adams 
began his military career in the U.S. Army, 
where he served for seven years. He entered 
the Air Force through the Reserve Officer 
Training Corps program after graduating from 
Auburn University with a degree in Computer 
Information Systems. In addition to his degree 
from Auburn, he holds a Master of Business 
Administration from Troy State University, a 
Master of Arts in Military Operational Art and 
Science from the Air Command and Staff Col-
lege, and a Master of Arts in National Security 
Strategy from the National War College. 
Since his first assignment in the Air Force 
as team for an ACC Computer System Squad-
ron, he has built a remarkable record of lead-
ership, holding squadron and group level com-
mand six times. His service includes deploy-
ments to Oman, Iraq, and Qatar in support of 
Operations Southern Watch, Iraqi Freedom, 
Enduring Freedom, New Dawn, as well as the 
Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa. 
Throughout 
this 
service, 
Colonel 
Adams 
earned numerous distinguished awards, in-
cluding the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, 
and the Defense Meritorious Service Medal. 
Though his tour as Commander of the 628th 
Air Wing and Joint Base Charleston has 
ended, Colonel Adams will long be remem-
bered for his lasting contributions to our com-
munity. He established the Lowcountry De-
fense Community Partnership Council, a civil-
ian-military program intended to strengthen the 
relationship between the Lowcountry civilian 
community and the base. He oversaw the 
base’s response to Hurricane Dorian, Hurri-
cane 
Florence, 
and 
most 
recently, 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. And he was also hon-
ored with the Military Service Award at the 
Black Engineer of the Year STEM Global 
Competitiveness Conference for his work to 
inspire students to work in cyber, STEM, or 
aviation and build pipelines for them to suc-
ceed. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Colonel Adams for his accomplishments 
as Commander of Joint Base Charleston. On 
behalf of my constituents in the Lowcountry, I 
thank him for his service to our community.
