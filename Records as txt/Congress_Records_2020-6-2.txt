The House was not in session today. Its next meeting will be held on Thursday, June 4, 2020, at 10 a.m. 
Senate 
TUESDAY, JUNE 2, 2020 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Lord God, have mercy upon our Na-
tion, for the winds of suffering buffet 
our land. We hear the cries of the 
voiceless and the anguish of the un-
heard. We see the criminal actions of 
those who threaten freedom. 
Lord, snatch this Nation, conceived 
in liberty, from the precipice of its own 
destruction. Extricate us from traps we 
have set for ourselves. Remind us that 
You are a God of justice from whom we 
borrow our heartbeats. 
Arise, mighty God, and make those 
who defy Your purposes tremble with 
reverential awe. Hear the prayers of 
our Senators, and give them wisdom, 
courage, and integrity for these chal-
lenging times. 
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 1 
minute for morning business, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICING 
REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
the virus pandemic is disrupting our 
daily lives in unimaginable ways. The 
National Institutes of Health is work-
ing with a private sector biotech com-
pany and has already begun early-stage 
human trials for a potential vaccine, so 
there is hope on the horizon. However, 
the soaring prices of prescription drugs 
are making lifesaving treatments and 
cures simply unaffordable for many 
Americans. 
This pandemic made clear two issues: 
Americans urgently want a cure, and 
when lifesaving therapies and cures 
come to the market, Americans must 
be able to afford them when their pro-
viders prescribe them. 
My 
bipartisan 
Prescription 
Drug 
Pricing Reduction Act is needed now 
more than ever. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
last night, the streets of major Amer-
ican cities were again the scene of 
looting and violent rioting that serves 
no purpose except to hurt innocent 
people and undermine peaceful dem-
onstrations. 
Every one of us has an obligation to 
distinguish peaceful protests over the 
killings of George Floyd, Breonna Tay-
lor, and Ahmaud Arbery from the vio-
lent riots that continue to see innocent 
people hurt, businesses and neighbor-
hoods destroyed, and law enforcement 
officers assaulted. The former is a cher-
ished constitutional right that every 
single citizen should support, and the 
latter is an unacceptable scourge that 
State and local leaders should have 
ended days ago. So I want to thank 
Federal, State, and local leaders who 
are taking seriously their obligation to 
restore peace, protect the innocent, 
and stop this senseless violence. 
In some places, like my home State 
of Kentucky and here in Washington, 
last night was comparatively more 
calm and safe. But in too many other 
places, like New York City, it appeared 
to be open season for lawlessness, 
looting, and attacking law enforcement 
for yet another night. And for what? 
For what? Rioting for the thrill of it? 
For the chance to steal some expensive 
items? So people can say they were on 
social media? 
This selfish violence takes us further 
away from any national healing or for-
ward progress. It does not bring posi-
tive change any closer; it simply 
pushes it further away. 
These rioters need to listen to what 
George Floyd’s brother Terrence said 
in Minneapolis just yesterday. Here is 
what George Floyd’s brother said: 
I understand [you all] are upset. I doubt 
[you’re] half as upset as I am. So if I’m not 
over here blowing up stuff, if I’m not over 
here messing up my community, then what 
are [you all] doing? 
George Floyd’s brother.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2636 
June 2, 2020 
[You’re] doing nothing. Because that’s not 
going to bring my brother back at all. 
So the legitimate and important 
voices of peaceful protesters will never 
be heard over the wailing of fire 
alarms, the smashing of plate-glass 
windows, and the sirens of ambulances 
coming for police officers who have 
been assaulted or shot in the head. 
Our Nation is united in horror and 
opposition to the violent killing of Mr. 
Floyd. We are united. It is well past 
time that we also unite on the side of 
peace in our streets and peace in our 
communities. We need to unite against 
these violent rioters, who seek only to 
aggrandize 
themselves 
and 
further 
damage a nation that needs healing. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on a totally different matter, obviously 
and unfortunately, this turmoil is not 
the only great challenge before us. Lest 
we forget, the healthcare fight against 
the worst viral pandemic in a century 
is still upon us. Our Nation is trying to 
smartly and safely reopen. Just as 
small businesses in some cities are 
sweeping up broken glass, American 
workers and entrepreneurs across the 
Nation are trying to rebuild the shat-
tered prosperity our Nation was experi-
encing just a few months ago. Mean-
while, beyond our shores, our enemies 
and adversaries would be only too 
eager to catch the United States with 
our guard down. 
So there is plenty of work before the 
Senate, and unlike the Democratic 
House of Representatives, which I un-
derstand may next appear here in 
Washington 
in 
about 
a 
month—in 
about a month—the Senate is present 
and working. 
We are continuing to conduct over-
sight of our historic rescue package, 
the CARES Act, as it continues taking 
effect. I expect we will soon consider 
further bipartisan legislation to help 
the Paycheck Protection Program—the 
signature policy from Senators Rubio 
and Collins that has kept tens of mil-
lions of Americans employed—continue 
to work for our country. 
As we pivot toward reopening, the 
Senate is also working on significant 
COVID-related legal protection so our 
Nation’s schools, healthcare workers, 
and employers are not swamped with 
frivolous lawsuits and taxpayer dollars 
do not just stimulate the pockets of 
trial lawyers. 
At the same time, critical vacancies 
remain throughout the Federal Gov-
ernment, and qualified nominees stand 
ready to fill them. So the Senate will 
work through two nominees to the 
Federal district courts and a number of 
important executive branch positions, 
including Assistant Secretary of De-
fense for Strategy, Plans, and Capabili-
ties; Deputy Under Secretary of De-
fense; and the new Special Inspector 
General for Pandemic Recovery. 
What is more, we also have all the 
important legislation that needed to 
get done before the pandemic arrived 
in the first place. This month, we will 
turn to bipartisan legislation led by 
Senators Gardner and Daines to pro-
vide stable support for the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund and lasting 
stewardship of our natural resources. 
Their bill will safeguard our Nation’s 
public lands for recreation and con-
servation 
and 
help 
generations 
of 
Americans continue to access and 
enjoy these treasures. 
In the coming weeks, our colleagues 
on the Armed Services Committee will 
begin marking up the 60th consecutive, 
annual National Defense Authorization 
Act. I know our colleagues need no re-
minder of how important that task is; 
neither do our men and women in uni-
form. The COVID–19 crisis makes it 
more urgent, not less urgent, that we 
continue to authorize investments in 
our servicemembers and their families 
and in advancing and accelerating our 
national defense strategy. From honing 
our competitive edge against would-be 
rivals on land and sea to expanding our 
reach in the air and space, achieving 
our Nation’s strategic priorities begins 
right here this month with the NDAA. 
So Congress’s to-do list is clear, and 
the Senate is manning its essential 
post, working to get the American peo-
ple’s business done.

PROTESTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
just finished watching Joe Biden’s 
speech to the Nation. President Trump, 
watch Joe Biden’s speech. That is what 
real leadership looks like. 
Now, it is difficult to express the mo-
ment we find ourselves in. Our country 
has been hit by a strange and con-
tagious disease infecting millions and 
killing over 100,000 of our people. Our 
economy was put on ice for several 
months, shuttering scores of busi-
nesses, casting 40 million Americans on 
the unemployment rolls, and, accord-
ing to government estimates, taking

June 2, 2020 
$16 trillion out of our economy over the 
long term. 
Then this Nation suffered another 
trauma—a deeply personal and wrench-
ing pain of another African American 
senselessly killed in police custody. It 
is another reminder of the racism that 
can infect not only our law enforce-
ment and our criminal justice system 
but our entire society. 
George Floyd’s killing spurred justi-
fied, overwhelmingly peaceful protests 
from Minneapolis to New York, from 
Atlanta to right here in the Nation’s 
Capital. 
Americans 
are 
frustrated. 
Americans are angry. Americans are 
upset at the country they see, and they 
want to change it. Can you blame 
them? It is a good thing that people 
protest and want to make our country 
better, especially when it comes to the 
scourge of racism, the poison that has 
been in American bones for far too 
long. 
The millions of Americans of all 
races and backgrounds who have taken 
to the streets in peaceful protest are 
doing something noble: reminding the 
powers that the decades-long failure to 
reform police departments is unaccept-
able and that systemic racism is a knee 
pressing on the necks of tens of mil-
lions of African Americans. They are 
reminding the country that Black lives 
matter by holding their arms up in si-
lence for 2 minutes and 53 seconds, 
which is the length of time that George 
Floyd was unresponsive while the po-
lice officer continued to press him into 
the hard pavement of that Minneapolis 
street. 
The small minority who have ex-
ploited the protests to wreak havoc 
and violence are wrong. They are not 
taking part in the grand American tra-
dition of First Amendment protests, 
and they are not peacefully assem-
bling. They are breaking laws and de-
stroying businesses already struggling 
to recover and putting their fellow citi-
zens in danger. They do a great dis-
service to themselves, their country, 
and the righteous cause that so many 
Americans are now engaged in. 
While over 4,000 protesters have been 
arrested over the past week, only 1 of 
the 4 police officers involved in George 
Floyd’s death has been arrested. It does 
not excuse the violence in any way, but 
it explains, in part, why so many 
Americans are angry. There is account-
ability for everyday citizens and pro-
testers when they violate the law, but 
there isn’t always accountability for 
law enforcement when it does the 
same. Violence, wherever it occurs, is 
wrong, but not prosecuting law en-
forcement when they break the law 
with the same intensity, as protesters 
when they break the law, is wrong as 
well. 
The first year of this new decade has 
brought plague and economic disaster 
and a vivid reminder of racial injus-
tice, testing—testing—the capacity of 
our country to endure what only a few 
months ago would have been consid-
ered an unimaginable series of chal-
lenges. 
We need leaders who will pull us to-
gether and help us heal and turn the 
righteous anger in the land into action 
and progress. Senate Democrats are 
not going to wait to take action on law 
enforcement reform. We are going to 
confront and address these issues right 
now. 
Several of my colleagues are working 
on 
legislation, 
including 
Senators 
BOOKER, HARRIS, CARDIN, DUCKWORTH, 
SCHATZ, and many others. As a caucus, 
we are going to listen to experts on ra-
cial justice, like Bryan Stevenson, and 
hear from our constituents who suffer 
racial discrimination and bias on a 
daily basis. We are going to propose 
and push for bold action. 
What matters is that we respond to 
the national wave of unrest with ac-
tion. I am repeating my call to Leader 
MCCONNELL. Leader MCCONNELL, com-
mit to putting law enforcement reform 
legislation on the floor before July 4. A 
divided nation cannot wait for healing 
or for solutions. 
At the same time, our Nation needs 
calm and steady leadership, a sure 
hand and a big heart—qualities that 
President Trump has never displayed 
in office. 
I repeat my request to President 
Trump: President Trump, watch Joe 
Biden’s speech that he gave this morn-
ing. That is what leadership is, not 
what you are doing. 
We are living through a tale of two 
crises—COVID and racial justice—and 
President Trump has been a miserable 
failure at handling both of them. 
Last night, the scene in Washington, 
DC, may have provided the enduring 
portrait of the Trump Presidency. 
While peaceful, law-abiding citizens 
were exercising their constitutional 
right to protest in a public park across 
from 
the 
White 
House, 
President 
Trump ordered Federal troops to clear 
those peaceful crowds with tear gas 
and rubber bullets so that he could 
trudge a few blocks from the White 
House to stand in front of a church, not 
to go inside but for a photo op. The 
President’s relentless need to make a 
weak man feel strong led him to order 
Federal law enforcement officers to gas 
peacefully assembled Americans so he 
could sneak his way to a church photo 
op. It led him to order Federal officers 
to gas peacefully assembled Americans 
so that he could sneak his way to a 
church for a photo op. 
After the gas came the horses, a mod-
ern-day cavalry for clearing the battle-
field. The purpose? So President Trump 
could wave a Bible—not read a Bible, 
not even his Bible—as a prop. It was 
appalling. It was an abuse of Presi-
dential power. It may well have been il-
legal, and it was blatantly unconstitu-
tional. The President of the United 
States ordered troops to attack peace-
ful American citizens exercising their 
constitutional rights by tear-gassing 
them in a public park while military 
helicopters flew overhead. 
The 
President 
must 
immediately 
cease this behavior. Secretary Esper 
and General Milley should not allow 
the U.S. military to come within a 
country mile of these ugly stunts. 
Let me say that again. The President 
must cease this behavior immediately. 
Secretary Esper and General Milley 
should not allow the U.S. military to 
come within a country mile of these 
ugly stunts. 
The administration is using the mili-
tary as a tool to intimidate American 
citizens. The Department of Defense IG 
must immediately launch an investiga-
tion into how the U.S. military was 
used and whether it was consistent 
with the laws of our Nation. 
Republicans on both sides of the Cap-
itol should be as outraged as we are. 
The last time we had a President who 
wantonly disobeyed the laws, there 
were Republicans in Congress who 
stood up to him—not so much this 
time, not so much this President. 
Leader MCCONNELL just spoke here 
on the floor, and we didn’t hear a word 
from him about the President’s dis-
graceful use of force on nonviolent 
protestors last night. Senate Repub-
licans who remain silent about the 
President’s abuses are, once again, be-
traying the rule of law and the con-
stitutional basis of this country. And 
the reason? Fear of a vindictive Presi-
dent who demands they never criticize 
him. 
After the President’s reality show 
ended last night, while the Nation 
nervously watched the chaos that en-
gulfs us, President Trump probably 
laid in bed pleased with himself for de-
scending another rung on the dictato-
rial ladder. He probably wore out his 
remote control watching the clips of 
General Barr’s victory over the un-
armed in the Battle of Lafayette 
Square. Then he reveled in the sounds 
of Blackhawks flying overhead and joy-
ously retweeted scores of preening 
sycophants. It is all so sad, so pathetic, 
and so weak. 
The President could have led during 
the COVID crisis, which still looms 
over us. He could have led in economic 
recovery, providing realistic hopes to 
people. Even now, he could be spending 
his time decrying the absence of jus-
tice for George Floyd, calling for the 
investigation or prosecution of the 
other three officers who were involved 
or for Breonna Taylor or for countless 
other African Americans who have 
been killed, extrajudicially, because of 
the color of their skin. 
Our Nation is desperate—desperate— 
for real leadership, but there is no one 
home at the White House, and the 
lights are off. I fear for the future of 
our country—that in this time of im-
mense difficulty, our President is only 
capable of contributing more division, 
more fear, and more chaos. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2638 
June 2, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING GEORGE FLOYD 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last 
Monday, George Floyd died in the 
hands of a Minnesota police officer. 
This senseless death left Americans 
reeling, most of all because there have 
been too many George Floyds and 
Breonna Taylors and Ahmaud Arberys. 
As a nation, we need to work to en-
sure that what happened last Monday 
in Minneapolis never happens again 
and that the perpetrators of crimes 
like this one are held accountable and 
brought to justice. We also need to ac-
knowledge how deeply many of our fel-
low citizens are suffering in the wake 
of George Floyd’s senseless death. A lot 
of our fellow Americans are afraid 
right now, shaken by another death 
and worried that that could easily have 
been their son or husband or brother. 
Too many Americans feel unsafe in 
their own communities, and we need to 
listen to them with humility, to listen 
to those whose experience of America 
has often been very different from 
many of ours. 
In the wake of George Floyd’s death, 
Americans took to the streets and cit-
ies across the country to express their 
outrage. They joined a powerful tradi-
tion and exercised a cherished right. 
Peaceful protest is an American insti-
tution, and as the civil rights move-
ment demonstrated, a powerful agent 
for change. These protests aren’t rel-
egated to big cities. We are seeing 
them in towns across South Dakota 
and in many other places in the United 
States. 
Unfortunately, though, there has also 
been counterproductive and unneces-
sary violence. Arson, looting, and de-
struction of property have happened in 
cities around the country, and commu-
nities have suffered damage that will 
be felt for years. Communities’ faces 
and community buildings have been 
damaged. Local businesses have seen 
their shops defaced and their aisles 
ransacked, and innocent bystanders 
have been injured. This is not a solu-
tion to the problems highlighted by 
George Floyd’s death, and this violence 
needs to end. Putting others’ lives in 
danger cannot be an acceptable re-
sponse to an unjust death. 
Around our country, our law enforce-
ment officers have been called out to 
respond to these riots. I just want to 
say a couple of words about our police 
officers. It was a police officer who 
caused George Floyd’s death, and, 
around our country, other police offi-
cers are sickened by that officer’s ac-
tions and the tragic result. Most of our 
Nation’s police are like Houston’s po-
lice chief, who went out and marched 
in solidarity with protesters, or like 
the police chief of Norfolk, VA, who did 
the same, or like the police officers in 
Camden, NJ, who joined locals to 
march, led by their police chief. 
There 
are 
certainly 
exceptions, 
sadly—too many exceptions. But the 
vast majority—the vast majority—of 
our Nation’s police officers are men 
and women of character who care deep-
ly about protecting everyone in their 
communities and who strive to do their 
jobs with justice and with integrity. 
For too many years, the promise of 
the declaration that ‘‘all men are cre-
ated equal’’ was denied to many. Even 
in our own day, with both slavery and 
segregation now mercifully in our past, 
the effects of these great national sins 
still make themselves felt. We must re-
dedicate ourselves to ensure that the 
promise of liberty and justice for all is 
realized for every American. It will 
take work, but I have faith in our 
country and in my fellow Americans, 
and I believe that we can get there. 
My prayers today are with George 
Floyd’s family and with all those who 
are suffering because of his unjust 
death. ‘‘And what does the Lord re-
quire of you,’’ the book of Micah asks, 
‘‘but to act justly and to love mercy 
and to walk humbly with your God.’’ 
May we all seek justice and mercy 
and walk humbly in the days that are 
ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

The

OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). Without objection, it is so

PROTESTS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am here to talk about the pain, frus-
tration, and anger that many Ameri-
cans are feeling this morning. In the 
midst of an unprecedented healthcare 
and economic crisis that is dispropor-
tionately affecting our minority com-
munities, we have seen protests spring 
up across the country in response to 
egregious examples of injustice and vi-
olence against African Americans. 
Just in the past few weeks, there 
have been graphic videos of Ahmaud 
Arbery gunned down while jogging on a 
street in Georgia; a White woman in 
Central Park calling 9–1-1 to falsely ac-
cuse 
an 
African-American 
man 
of 
threatening her; and George Floyd 
pleading for his life as a White officer 
pressed his knee onto his neck for near-
ly 9 minutes in Minnesota, killing him. 
Joining many others, I have made it 
clear that what happened to these 
Americans is outrageous and unaccept-
able. It was very hard to watch that 
video of George Floyd, a man whose 
family described him as a ‘‘gentle 
giant,’’ literally begging for his life. ‘‘I 
can’t breathe,’’ he said. ‘‘Don’t kill 
me,’’ he pleaded. Those were his final 
words. This simply cannot be allowed 
to continue in America. By the way, no 
one I know in law enforcement believes 
this behavior should be allowed either. 
Each of these acts and other acts of 
injustice against Black Americans is 
deeply troubling in its own right. The 
combination of these injustices right 
now, in the midst of concerns about the 
disproportionate 
impact 
of 
the 
coronavirus on communities of color, 
has created a firestorm. 
Right now, many feel overwhelmed 
by the sadness, anger, and helplessness. 
Our hearts are with the families of 
George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and 
every American who has experienced 
injustices in the shadows, away from 
the cameras, outside of the news head-
lines, in their daily lives. 
It is good that Federal, State, and 
local investigations are underway in 
the Floyd and Arbery cases and that 
murder charges have been filed. We 
must all demand that justice be served 
fully and thoroughly. We are a nation 
of laws, and we must work to uphold 
those laws to protect everyone. But my 
fear is, like so many other times in our 
Nation’s history, what will happen is 
that these killings will fade from the 
public’s consciousness and we will 
move silently back to the status quo. 
We can’t allow that to happen this 
time. It is past time for us to have a 
robust and inclusive national dialogue 
on racial inequities and some difficult 
but necessary conversations about how 
we move forward as a country. 
Over the past couple of days, I have 
spoken with the mayors of Cleveland, 
Cincinnati, and Columbus—our three 
biggest cities in Ohio, all three of 
which have had peaceful protests and 
destructive rioting. I commend each of 
them for their support of citizens dem-
onstrating peacefully and for what 
they have done to try to stop the vio-
lence. We talked about cultivating 
hope for a better world. 
I will continue to try to use this po-
dium here in the Senate to foster unity 
and discussions with my colleagues, 
my constituents, and leaders across 
Ohio. We need to work together to find 
solutions that promote strong families 
and communities that treat each other 
with respect and dignity. 
I believe one place to start is by hold-
ing up those police departments around 
the country that have made substan-
tial reforms in training and account-
ability 
and 
improved 
relationships 
with communities of color, all the 
while ensuring better public safety for 
their citizens. 
In my home town of Cincinnati, in 
the wake of similar racial injustice 
protests in 2001, I worked alongside 
local officials to develop a better rela-
tionship of shared respect between the 
Black community and our police offi-
cers. It is called the Collaborative 
Agreement. It is not a perfect system, 
and it has been tested, but it has also 
proved to be a valuable tool to ensure 
continuous and open dialogue between 
the African-American community and 
the police force. The data is there. 
There has been a measurable drop in 
Cincinnati in cases both where police 
officers used excessive force and where 
officers themselves were injured. 
The Federal Government provided 
support for this program. A lot of the

support came in terms of the computer 
systems and the data and the trans-
parency and accountability. There is 
more work to be done, so the Federal 
role should continue in Cincinnati, but 
this may be a model for other cities to 
follow as well. 
As we look at what actions this body 
should take, I have been encouraged by 
some of the good ideas brought forward 
by some of my colleagues. My col-
league from South Carolina, Senator 
TIM SCOTT, is introducing a bill that 
would encourage greater reporting of 
fatalities that occur while individuals 
are under arrest or in police custody. 
When we know more about what is hap-
pening and emerging trends, I believe 
we will be better able to address the 
right public policy approach. 
Now would also be a good time, in my 
view, to establish a national commis-
sion on race, as was done in 1967 by 
President Johnson in response to the 
civil unrest of that era. Perhaps the 
honorary cochairs of such a commis-
sion could be people of standing, like 
former Presidents Obama and Bush, 
both of whom have spoken eloquently 
about racism as a stain on our national 
character. It would not be a commis-
sion to restate the problem but to 
focus on solutions and send a strong 
moral message that America must live 
up to the ideal that God created all of 
us as equal. 
Sadly, there are those who are trying 
to take advantage of the pain and suf-
fering by instigating acts of violence 
aimed at the police, looting, vandal-
izing, and setting fires, usually in the 
very communities that are suffering so 
much. It pains me to see the disrespect 
that has been shown by some, includ-
ing to some of our small business own-
ers and their employees in these com-
munities, who are watching something 
be destroyed that they have spent their 
lifetime building. It pains me to see 
the disrespect being shown to some of 
the officers who are doing their job in 
a professional manner. It heartens me 
to see some of the peaceful demonstra-
tors trying to stop these destructive 
acts. 
Violence is not the answer. It will 
only serve to further divide our already 
polarized 
country. 
George 
Floyd’s 
younger brother, Terrence, said yester-
day: 
It’s OK to be angry, but channel your 
anger to do something positive or make a 
change another way because we’ve been 
down this road already. The anger, damaging 
your hometown, is not the way he’d want. 
We cannot dismiss the anger and 
frustration that have driven so many 
to the streets for peaceful protests 
these past few days. The anger on dis-
play is real. It is raw. And it deserves 
to be heard and respected. This is 
something we must all learn from, and 
we mustn’t thwart the rights of those 
who are demonstrating peacefully. But 
the answer is not violence. The answer 
is to insist that justice be served. The 
answer is to listen to those who have 
felt the sting of racism. The answer is 
to acknowledge when racial disparities 
and inequities occur, and the answer is 
to work together to address these long-
standing injustices going forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, this 
is a busy week for all of us in the Sen-
ate but not so much for our friends in 
the House, who won’t be back until the 
end of the month to vote on any legis-
lation. 
We are hard at work here in the Sen-
ate, and particularly in the Judiciary 
Committee, we have a lot to do. This 
morning, we held a hearing to examine 
the impact of COVID–19 on incarcer-
ation and detention. Across my State, 
nearly 5,500 offenders have tested posi-
tive for COVID–19, and at least three 
dozen have passed away. In addition, 
nearly 900 employees have tested posi-
tive, leading to 7 line-of-duty deaths. 
This has been and continues to be a 
major focus of mine after having re-
ceived a letter from the public em-
ployee union at the Federal Medical 
Center in Carswell in Ft. Worth, which 
is actually a medical facility for incar-
cerated individuals. 
Unfortunately, we know that, just 
like the nursing homes and assisted 
living facilities—people who are elderly 
or have chronic underlying health 
problems are especially vulnerable to 
this virus. We need to do everything we 
can to make sure that people are treat-
ed humanely and fairly even while in-
carcerated. 
Tomorrow, we will switch gears, and 
we will hold the next in a series of im-
portant hearings to examine the han-
dling of the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane 
investigation. You will recall that the 
Crossfire Hurricane investigation was 
opened in July 2016, in the midst of a 
Presidential election campaign. This 
followed on the heels of a now famous 
or infamous press conference that FBI 
Director Comey had on July 5, 2016, in 
which he claimed that no reasonable 
prosecutor 
would 
charge 
then-Can-
didate Clinton for the various email 
scandals he investigated. But unfortu-
nately, as we found out later, he re-
opened that investigation again right 
before the November election, casting 
a lot of doubt on who interfered the 
most with the 2016 election. Was it Di-
rector Comey, or was it Russian active 
measures? Who had the biggest impact 
on the actual outcome? 
As I said, this investigation against 
the Clinton campaign began in the 
summer of 2016. When the special coun-
sel’s report was released last April, it 
concluded that there was no collusion 
or obstruction that could be charged as 
an offense. 
I had hoped that extensive investiga-
tion conducted by the former FBI Di-
rector, Bob Mueller, would close the 
chapter in this book, but as informa-
tion about how the FBI conducted its 
work has come to light, thanks in large 
part to the outstanding work of the in-
spector general of the Department of 
Justice, Mr. Horowitz, it is clear that 
this story is far from over, and there is 
a lot we need to do together to help re-
store public confidence in our Nation’s 
premier 
law 
enforcement 
agencies, 
known as the Department of Justice 
and the FBI. 
We have learned—tragically, I say, 
because as a former judge and former 
attorney general, I revere these insti-
tutions of law enforcement—we learned 
about texts from high-ranking govern-
ment officials in the FBI, in the upper- 
management echelon, vowing to stop 
Donald Trump’s election. 
We now have learned about systemic 
abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act, which is supposed to pro-
tect the privacy of American citizens, 
and how it was manipulated and inten-
tionally abused, and lies actually com-
municated to the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court in order to justify a 
warrant against an American citizen. 
We have learned about a first altered 
and now missing 302 for Michael Flynn. 
He, of course, was the National Secu-
rity Advisor for a short time for Presi-
dent Trump but was later charged with 
lying to the FBI. Amazingly, in a 
surreal course of events, the original 
notes taken by the FBI agents who 
interviewed General Flynn are nowhere 
to be found. We learned they were later 
modified. 
We 
have 
the 
modified 
version, after somebody got to change 
them, but we need to see the under-
lying ones. 
It is no wonder that the steady drip 
of information paints a very troubling 
picture about the motivations behind 
the Crossfire Hurricane investigation 
and the way it evolved over time. 
The thing that concerns me the most 
is, if rogue FBI officials can do this 
against a Presidential candidate, if 
they can do what they did to Hillary 
Clinton and expose derogatory infor-
mation while saying there isn’t evi-
dence with which to charge her with an 
offense, if that is tolerated, then what 
sort of protection do we as ordinary 
citizens have against that kind of 
abuse of the enormous power given to 
our law enforcement agencies and in-
vestigative agencies like the FBI? 
So this is a monumental scandal. The 
American people deserve answers, and 
that is what the Judiciary Committee 
is hoping to deliver. 
Tomorrow, we will hear from former 
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosen-
stein about the origins of the inves-
tigation and the role he played as the 
Deputy Attorney General at the time— 
the second highest ranking official at 
the Department of Justice. Of course 
Mr. Rosenstein, during his long and il-
lustrious career as a former U.S. attor-
ney headquartered in Baltimore, was 
closely linked to some of the key play-
ers in the decisions made during this 
investigation, and his testimony is a 
critical first step in learning the truth 
behind this misguided and rogue inves-
tigation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2640 
June 2, 2020 
On Thursday, the committee will 
vote on subpoena authorizations to ob-
tain additional documents that are 
critical to our oversight responsibil-
ities. 
As we work to restore America’s 
faith in our justice system, there is 
only one way we can succeed, and that 
is to find the truth and to follow the 
truth, wherever it may lead. That proc-
ess will begin in earnest again tomor-
row, and I look forward to working 
with my colleagues on the Judiciary 
Committee to uncover the facts, to 
share them with the American people, 
and to begin to persuade them that we 
take seriously the job of repairing the 
damage done by the Crossfire Hurri-
cane investigation, conducted outside 
of all of the norms and rules that 
should guide those investigations, on 
the eve of a Presidential campaign, on 
top of the reason that Rod Rosenstein 
recommended to President Trump that 
James Comey be fired as the FBI Direc-
tor because of his mishandling of the 
Hillary Clinton email investigation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today with the re-
marks I had prepared while home in 
Wyoming last week, but first I need to 
comment on the tragedy that is facing 
our Nation today. 
Anyone who has seen the video of 
George Floyd being murdered—mur-
dered—has to be heartbroken. The 
peaceful protests that followed—peace-
ful at first—about police abuse against 
any—any—American 
are 
important 
and are necessary. These peaceful pro-
tests about George Floyd’s death have 
been 
hijacked, 
though, 
by 
violent 
criminals. Anyone who sees the video 
of the wanton destruction and the 
looting and the rioting and the arson 
knows that those who are involved 
have no respect for the people they are 
harming. They dishonor the memory of 
George Floyd, and they dishonor the 
cause for which the demonstrators and 
the protesters first took to the streets. 
Those who would desecrate the Lin-
coln Memorial, the World War II Vet-
erans Memorial, and the church that 
every President has worshipped in 
going back to James Madison—those 
are people who are set on undermining 
our Nation. 
CORONAVIRUS 
My goal today is to come to the floor 
to talk about rebuilding our Nation— 
rebuilding our Nation as we recover 
from coronavirus. 
Last week at Memorial Day services 
in Wyoming, I reflected on America’s 
heroes and the sacrifices so many have 
made for the rest of us. 
As I talk with people in Wyoming 
and travel the State, I am reminded 
how self-reliant, how resourceful, how 
independent, and how resilient we are 
as Americans. 
Well, the worst of coronavirus does 
now seem to be behind us. People want 
to get back to work. The economy, 
forcefully shut down by the govern-
ment, is now showing signs of life. 
Businesses are starting to reopen. As 
we say in the West, it is time to get 
back in the saddle. We are going to 
fully reopen our communities, and we 
are going to do it smartly, safely, and 
soon. Every Governor needs to speed, 
not impede, the process so people can 
return to work. 
Just as important, our children need 
to get back to school. It is critical. 
Parents know how important it is for 
our students and our kids to be back in 
the classroom. The lockdowns have 
been hard on young people. Our kids 
miss their teachers, they miss their 
friends, and they miss their normal ac-
tivities. 
Every child learns differently. Many 
children are having trouble learning at 
home, and others are having difficulty 
learning on the screen. Some kids are 
basically teaching themselves. 
What happens if an at-risk child 
misses an entire year of school? And 
what about the impact on child wel-
fare? 
I published an op-ed last week enti-
tled ‘‘Coronavirus Collateral Damage.’’ 
In it, I noted that pediatricians are 
very concerned that with the shut-
downs, a significant number of child 
abuse cases are going undetected and 
unreported. 
Thankfully, schools are figuring out 
safe ways to reopen. The Senate Health 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee is holding a hearing this week 
on going back to college safely, and 
next week we are going to hold a hear-
ing called ‘‘Going Back to School Safe-
ly.’’ 
Most of the K–12 schools and colleges 
hope to reopen this fall. Research tells 
us that young people are better able to 
deal with the virus and are less likely 
to suffer symptoms of the disease. 
Nevertheless, the California State 
university system has decided to keep 
all of its campuses closed for the fall 
semester—every one of them. They say 
they will not open any of them again 
until after New Year’s. California’s 
university system is the country’s 
largest and serves about half a million 
students. They have campuses through-
out the State of California, and they 
are taking a one-size-fits-all approach, 
treating every campus as if they are all 
identical. In my view, that decision is 
misguided. 
To date, nearly two-thirds of U.S. 
colleges plan to reopen this fall. That 
is according to the Chronicle of Higher 
Education, which is researching the 
universities and talking with them, 
finding out exactly what is going on 
from school to school. 
Universities across the country are 
rolling out responsible reopening plans 
aimed at protecting students as well as 
staff. 
Back at home, the University of Wy-
oming in Laramie is advancing a bold 
fall reopen agenda and plan. The uni-
versity has asked the Governor for $79 
million in Federal coronavirus relief 
funds to help support the effort. Some 
of the safety measures being discussed 
include single dorm rooms, smaller 
classes, enhanced cleaning, and re-
quired staff and student coronavirus 
testing every several weeks. 
In a recent statement, the University 
of Wyoming president stressed ‘‘the im-
portance of an on-campus educational 
experience.’’ The president of the Uni-
versity of Wyoming, Neil Theobald, has 
pledged to ‘‘bring our students back to 
campus safely and protect the health of 
our community to the highest extent 
possible.’’ 
Last week, two university presidents 
in Indiana published op-eds discussing 
their decisions to reopen this fall. 
Writing in the Washington Post, Pur-
due University president and former 
Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels said 
that failing to reopen would be ‘‘an un-
acceptable breach of duty’’—an unac-
ceptable breach of duty. He said Pur-
due based its decision on current sci-
entific data showing COVID–19, while 
very dangerous for the old and the 
sick, ‘‘poses a near zero risk to young 
people.’’ To keep the community safe, 
Purdue is taking a number of steps, in-
cluding making its campus less dense. 
Purdue will require one-third of the 
staff to work remotely. 
The former Governor said that per-
sonal responsibility is key. He goes on 
to say: ‘‘Upon arrival in August, each 
Boilermaker will receive a kit includ-
ing face masks and a thermometer for 
daily temperature taking as well as the 
Protect 
Purdue 
Pledge.’’ 
President 
Mitchell 
Daniels 
said: 
‘‘Forty-five 
thousand young people—the biggest 
student population we’ve ever had—are 
telling us they want to be here this 
fall.’’ 
Only a week after California’s deci-
sion to stay closed for the fall and the 
rest of the year, the University of 
Notre Dame made headlines by an-
nouncing it will reopen this fall. 
Writing in the New York Times last 
week, Notre Dame president, Reverend 
John Jenkins, said: ‘‘Educating young 
people—the future leaders of our soci-
ety—is worth risking a good deal.’’ 
Notre Dame is going to open August 
10—2 weeks earlier than they had 
planned—and to limit the back and the 
forth, the Fighting Irish will forgo 
their fall break and end the semester 
before 
Thanksgiving. 
Other 
safety 
measures 
being 
considered 
include 
masks, social distancing, aggressive 
testing, temperature checks, contact 
tracing, and remote options for at-risk 
students and staff. Father Jenkins 
noted that the school’s decision is 
guided by science but also took cour-
age and common sense.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2641 
June 2, 2020 
These schools have sought the best 
possible medical advice. They are fol-
lowing Federal public health guide-
lines, and they are committed to pro-
tecting the vulnerable. 
This is all new territory. There is no 
manual. Every community faces a 
unique set of challenges. Every school 
must chart its own course. Still, we 
can all agree that during this difficult 
and 
challenging 
time, 
America’s 
schools must stand with their students, 
and not just for the well-being of the 
students but for others as well. Col-
leges are critical for the economic 
health of entire communities; hence 
the name ‘‘college towns.’’ Universities 
are major employers, often the best 
local source of stable jobs. Many uni-
versity jobs are also on the line this 
fall. The college shutdowns have also 
shut down Main Street. For many 
small businesses, losing graduation 
weekend alone was a crushing blow. 
Can mom-and-pop businesses sustain 
another lost semester? 
Taking away people’s educational op-
portunities, social supports, and liveli-
hoods has a real, negative impact. 
Here is the bottom line: We have 
learned that we can protect people 
from the virus and we can get back to 
normal life. 
For the good of the whole society, it 
is so critically important that we re-
open now. It is time for America to get 
back in the saddle again.

DEFENSE NOMINATIONS 
Mr. 
LEAHY. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
President’s threat of using military 
force against protestors is a grossly in-
appropriate, 
unnecessary, 
and 
dan-
gerous escalation at a time when 
Americans are looking for constructive 
and enlightened leadership. America’s 
power and strength derives, above all, 
not from our military might, but from 
the values that are at the very founda-
tion of this country, rooted in the First 
Amendment of the Constitution. 
Our country has a long tradition of 
civilian policing. It is one of the many 
ways our government differs from re-
gimes that routinely use the military 
to intimidate and silence their critics. 
The Insurrection Act was last invoked 
nearly three decades ago, to respond to 
the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles 
at the request of and by working close-
ly with State authorities. 
Its application is not a threat to be 
cavalierly bandied about, as if our 
Armed Forces are puppets of the Presi-
dent to evict peaceful protestors for 
purposes of a staged photo op. I am 
deeply disturbed that civilian and mili-
tary leaders joined the President in 
this misuse of force. 
Until the President and his senior 
military advisers make clear that they 
understand and accept this, I cannot 
vote to confirm further nominees to 
the Department of Defense.

PROTESTS 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, today 
we are on the Senate floor at a time 
when, once again, we are attempting as 
a country to reconcile things that 
should have been reconciled long ago. 
The deaths of George Floyd, Breonna 
Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery shocked 
and outraged the country. The three of 
them, in a very short period of time, 
brought again this division we have in 
our country where we look at the coun-
try and particularly look at law en-
forcement in two different ways. 
The discussion I have had with my 
sons is different from the discussion 
that many of my African-American 
friends have had—in fact, as far as I 
know, all of my African-American 
friends who ever talked to me about 
this have had—with their sons. With 
my sons, I would say: If you get in 
trouble, look for a police officer. 
That is not the police officer discus-
sion that African-American fathers 
often have with their sons. That dis-
cussion goes more like this: If you are 
picked up by the police, do exactly 
what you are told until I get there, and 
we will straighten it out once I get 
there. 
Those are the two views of what hap-
pens. 
We see in all of these cases some rea-
son to believe that those concerns are 
absolute and legitimate. Because of 
that, there is a wide support for the 
protests going on around the country. 
At our leadership stakeout today on 
the Republican side, everybody was 
great, I think, understanding the emo-
tion and empathy, and they talked 
about the importance of peaceful pro-
tests as we see these things that have 
happened. 
The problem is we have protests 
peacefully during the day that turn 
into violence and chaos at night. The 
peaceful protests shouldn’t become a 
cover for violent activity. In fact, one 
of my good friends who planned some 
protest marches told me today that 
there has never been a peaceful protest 
march 
planned 
for 
the 
nighttime. 
Nighttime is not the time for peaceful 
protest marching. It might be the time 
for a candlelight vigil, but not a time 
for peaceful protests. 
What we see at night are people who 
either weren’t part of that daytime 
protesting activity or were there in the 
daytime so they could transition to vi-
olence and looting at night. It is abso-
lutely outrageous and absolutely unac-
ceptable. 
We saw George Floyd’s brother yes-
terday go to the place where his broth-
er died and say: If I am not looting, if 
I am not rioting, if I am not destroying 
other people’s property, why would you 
be doing that? 
He was saying: I lost my brother, and 
I am not trying to destroy my neigh-
borhood because I lost my brother. I 
am not trying to destroy his neighbor-
hood because my brother is gone. 
Yet we see activities happen that are 
unacceptable on all fronts. Last night, 
in St. Louis, we had four police officers 
shot in the line of duty. Sometime ear-
lier in the day, it had been anticipated 
that at the City Justice Center there 
would be a planned violent activity. 
You don’t manage to shoot four police 
officers unless you are thinking about 
it and normally thinking about it in 
advance, but that is what happened. 
Fortunately, those wounds were all 
survivable. 
I talked to people in the police de-
partment in St. Louis today, and they 
had six other events last night where 
police were shot at during the course of 
the night. We need to realize that the 
police officers who work and the Na-
tional Guard men and women who are 
working are out there risking their 
lives trying to protect others. We need

to realize that when they go to work 
every day, the members of their family 
have every reason to be concerned all 
day and every day of what might hap-
pen. They don’t know what door the 
person they love may be asked to 
knock on, what car they may stop, or 
what moment may happen that makes 
the difficult life of being in law en-
forcement even more difficult. 
We have certainly seen plenty of 
tragedies there in recent years, too. It 
hasn’t been that long ago that police 
officers were being ambushed routinely 
and a number of police officers were 
killed while on duty, not while they 
were trying to apprehend a felon, but 
when somebody just walks up behind 
them in the car or on the street and 
their life is ended. 
Then we see the horrifying image of 
George Floyd’s murder. We have the 
same fear for people in that situation 
and the people whom they love. In fact, 
nobody should live in fear in our soci-
ety of just their personal safety—not 
the law enforcement officers, not their 
families, not people who are peacefully 
protesting, or people who have violated 
the law and are being arrested, as they 
should be, but not with the result that 
we saw. Whether that arrest was appro-
priate or not, no arrest is appropriate 
to decide you are going to be the pun-
ishing officer as well as the arresting 
officer. 
Those who are in power should be 
held accountable. Those who are in 
power should set an example. 
I talked this morning to the police 
chief in Kansas City, Rick Smith, who 
tomorrow will be joining a unity march 
with other leaders in the community 
and 
protesters 
in the community. 
Marching along with the protesters 
will be Chief Smith and other officers 
and other elected leaders. That is one 
way to begin to resolve this. 
I also think, having had some experi-
ence with this particular topic, that 
the Justice Department needs to rein-
state their full review of department 
pattern and practice. This is something 
they have walked away from in recent 
years, but in our State we had three de-
partments since 2014 that had a full 
pattern and practice review by the Jus-
tice Department. At least one of those 
entered into a consent decree with the 
Department as to how they would focus 
in the future. 
I think one of those three—St. Louis 
County—asked 
for the review. St. 
Louis County, the city of Ferguson, St. 
Louis city—all believe they benefited 
from that review. 
Reviewing an officer or a number of 
officers is just often not enough, so I 
am encouraging the Department of 
Justice to get back to having one of 
the options on the table a full review 
by the Civil Rights Division or some 
other division in the Justice Depart-
ment, depending on the circumstances, 
of not only the procedures but also the 
pattern that a department may have 
fallen into. 
We cannot continue over and over 
again to have the same thing happen, 
as we as a society try to grapple with 
the same exact problem. This is not a 
new problem. It is long past the time 
we should have figured out how to deal 
with it. 
If departments need help in figuring 
out how to deal with it, that is one of 
the things that—whether it was St. 
Louis or Baltimore—the Justice De-
partment has shown some ability and 
some success in doing. I hope they will 
look at that again as they look at 
these three instances that I mentioned 
today and others. 
It is time to move forward. It is well 
past time to move forward. It is a time 
when people should have a society— 
have confidence in the institutions of 
the society, and those who serve in law 
enforcement and public assistance of 
all kinds should also have the apprecia-
tion and respect that we should have 
for them, and, of course, that is a con-
tract where you earn that respect, but 
you also get that respect when you 
have earned it, as well over 99.9 percent 
of those who serve every day do. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Illinois. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1938 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, as 
if in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Judiciary Com-
mittee be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 1938 and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; further, that the bill be read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think 
we probably can get there if we talk. 
We just got this thing at 5:30 last 
night. It is a grant program to try to 
strive for better policing, less bias. I 
get that. Count me in for that concept. 
There is a civilian review process 
about prosecutorial decisions that I 
don’t quite understand. Senator LEE 
came up and asked me questions about 
the bill. 
So with no animosity, I object at this 
time. I hope we can get it as part of a 
broader agenda. On June 16, we are 
going to have a hearing about all 
things related to police and race, and 
we will try to make this part of a pack-
age. 
So at this time, I do object, and let it 
go through the committee. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, 
first he said ‘‘I can’t breathe.’’ Then he 
called out ‘‘Mama’’ for his late mother. 
Last Monday, in broad daylight, 
George Floyd was slowly, publicly 
killed by someone whose responsibility 
it was to protect and serve. Officer 
Derek Chauvin, who has since been 
rightfully fired, spent about 3 minutes 
ignoring Floyd’s cries of pain, refusing 
to move his knee from Floyd’s neck, 
refusing to let up, to get up, even as 
the man under him begged for life and 
lost 
consciousness. 
Then 
he 
spent 
roughly another 6 minutes after Floyd 
had fallen silent ignoring the number 
of growing of witnesses who begged 
him to see the obvious—that the man 
under his knee was unresponsive, that 
he was dying. 
As a mom, there are not words to de-
scribe the visceral, gut-wrenching feel-
ing of hearing someone cry out for 
their mother in a moment of such des-
peration. 
George Floyd’s death was unneces-
sary and heartbreaking. It was a trag-
edy, but horrifyingly, it was not an 
anomaly. 
From Eric Garner, who told us 6 
years ago that he, too, could not 
breathe, to Tamir Rice, who never 
made it to his 13th birthday, the sense-
less killing of unarmed Black Ameri-
cans at the hands of law enforcement 
has become an all-too-common occur-
rence. The horror of the moment, then 
the outrage and sadness and, yes, anger 
that follow have turned into a pattern 
that too many people appear to believe 
is normal. It is not, and we cannot— 
must not—let ourselves become numb 
to the reality in front of us. 
George Floyd was someone’s son who 
with his dying breath called out for his 
mother who had previously passed 
away. He had a 6-year-old daughter 
who will not only grow up without a fa-
ther but knowing that she, too, would 
face the same danger every day just be-
cause of the color of her skin. 
George Floyd was born in a country 
built on the belief that we are all cre-
ated equal, but he died in a country 
that still has not fully realized that we 
must all be treated equally as well. 
It is long, long past time for action. 
We needed it before George Floyd; we 
needed it before Breonna Taylor, before 
Laquan McDonald, and before count-
less others were killed too. 
We need real leaders who listen to 
Americans’ cries for help and give 
those fighting for justice a platform to 
be 
heard. 
But 
sadly, 
although 
unsurprisingly, Donald Trump has done 
just the opposite over the past few 
days, 
trampling 
First 
Amendment 
rights by ordering Federal law enforce-
ment to assault those who stood in the 
way of his photo-op, exploiting our 
military and disrespecting our troops 
by using them as a cudgel to silence 
our neighbors and further divide our 
country. 
Donald Trump may be our Com-
mander 
in 
Chief, 
but 
tear-gassing 
peaceful protestors is not leadership; it 
is 
cowardice. 
Threatening 
military 
force 
against 
Americans 
exercising 
their constitutional right is not Presi-
dential; it is tin-pot dictatorial. 
You know, in moments like these, it 
is more important than ever to recog-
nize the privilege that many of us

have. I will never be forced to sit my 
daughters down and have the same talk 
with them that Black mothers have 
with their children—especially their 
sons—about how exactly to move and 
speak when interacting with police of-
ficers to preemptively reassure them 
that they pose no danger; or about the 
fundamental racism that mars our so-
ciety that will question their motives 
and their right to be somewhere just 
because of the shade of their skin; or 
about the systemic biases that lead too 
many Americans, including those in 
positions of power, to view unarmed 
Black children as more threatening 
than White adults holding semiauto-
matic rifles. 
I know that I will never be able to 
fully comprehend the fear that those 
parents must face every time their 
child steps outside, every time they 
dare to walk to school or play on the 
playground or buy some Skittles while 
Black. But what I do know is the bur-
den of all this pain and trauma cannot 
fall and should not fall on those fami-
lies 
alone. 
The 
responsibility, 
the 
work, the bending of the moral arc of 
the universe toward justice cannot just 
be put on the backs of the very people 
who have been feeling its weight this 
entire time. 
The systemic injustices in our coun-
try are not going away by themselves, 
and they will not be solved if too many 
good, decent Americans remain silent. 
If we choose to avoid difficult realities 
and tough conversations simply be-
cause they make us uncomfortable, we 
are failing to do our part in achieving 
anything close to a more perfect union. 
Those of us who have benefited from 
the privileges we have been afforded by 
society, we have a duty to recognize 
the costs borne by those who have been 
denied those same privileges for gen-
erations. 
I don’t claim to have all the answers, 
but I do know that we must do more. 
On a personal level, for me, that has in-
cluded spending time with both of my 
daughters, discussing what true justice 
and equality means and how to prac-
tice it so that if they grow up to be-
come police officers themselves, they 
don’t reflexively treat Black Ameri-
cans as more dangerous than anyone 
else; so that when they see a young 
Black 
man 
shopping, 
their 
first 
thought would never be that he is shop-
lifting; so that no matter what they do 
in life, they judge people by the con-
tent of their character and not the 
color of their skin. 
My girls may be just 5 and 2, but it is 
never too early for us to talk to our 
kids about treating others how we 
want to be treated because our neigh-
bors, our American brothers and sis-
ters, need more vocal allies in this 
fight. I hope to raise two of those allies 
in my two girls. Today, I hope to find 
99 fellow allies in my colleagues here in 
the Senate. It is on each of us lucky 
enough to serve under this great Cap-
itol dome to use this moment to fight 
for justice and accountability for those 
families like George Floyd’s who had 
someone so cruelly and needlessly sto-
len from them. 
So I have come to the floor today to 
request unanimous consent on S. 1938, 
the Police Training and Independent 
Review Act, the second bill I ever in-
troduced into this august body more 
than 3 years ago. This bill would de-
mand that local law enforcement agen-
cies change use-of-force policies and 
that every American receive fair treat-
ment 
under 
the 
law—commonsense 
policies that I believe responsible law 
enforcement officers would welcome so 
they could better protect and serve 
their communities. 
It would establish a new grant pro-
gram so States can implement racial 
bias training at police academies to 
help officers deescalate tense situa-
tions. It would also encourage States 
to 
establish 
a 
transparent 
system 
where independent prosecutors review 
police uses of force and prosecute offi-
cers who break the laws they were en-
trusted to enforce, because local pros-
ecutors do have a bias. They rely on 
the same police departments to win 
other cases, which is why it is so crit-
ical that we let outside independent 
prosecutors do the investigating and 
prosecuting of our law enforcement of-
ficers who do not follow the law them-
selves instead. 
For me, it comes down to this: We 
cannot let ourselves accept that, in the 
United States of America, in the year 
2020, Black men are still being publicly 
executed without judge or jury. For 
about 9 minutes last Monday, some-
body’s son and somebody’s father was 
forced to know he was dying and forced 
to beg for his life until he couldn’t beg 
anymore. 
George Floyd cannot breathe any-
more. So it is on those of us lucky 
enough to still be here today, to still 
be breathing, to use every breath we 
have to fight for the justice that he 
was robbed of on that street in Min-
neapolis last week. I know I will, and I 
hope every other American will join

I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent to finish my re-
marks before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to honor a life 
lost, share in the grief of a family and 
a Nation in pain, and call for this body 
to take action to reform a system that 
has been broken for too long. 
George Floyd should be alive today, 
but he isn’t. He was murdered by police 
in my State—a death both horrifying 
and inhumane but not unique. We lit-
erally saw his life evaporate before our 
eyes. The whole country saw it. The 
whole world saw it. 
We know that our African-American 
community in Minneapolis and across 
America has seen this horror before 
and has experienced injustice for far 
too long. They have had enough. They 
are angry and in pain, and they are 
calling out for justice. 
Senators, we cannot answer with si-
lence. That would make us complicit. 
We cannot answer with what the Presi-
dent called dominance. That would 
make us monsters. We cannot answer 
with using churches as props and Bi-
bles as props and inflaming violence. 
We must answer with action. That is 
what makes us lawmakers. 
For 13 years, here in Washington, 
change has come inch by inch when we 
should be miles ahead. I pick that time 
because that is when I first got here. 
That is when I first started doing work 
on crack cocaine and sentencing dis-
parity, and I have seen those changes, 
but it is inch by inch. 
First, there needs to be justice for 
George Floyd. There needs to be crimi-
nal accountability to the fullest extent 
of the law. Minnesota attorney general 
Keith Ellison, with whom I have 
worked closely for years, has taken 
over the investigation and the prosecu-
tion of the case. I have full faith in his 
conviction for justice in this case and 
beyond. 
Sweeping reform starts with account-
ability in this individual case, but it 
doesn’t end there. We all know that 
these officers work within a bigger sys-
tem, so that is why I called for a full- 
scale investigation into the patterns 
and practices of racially discrimina-
tory policing in the Minneapolis Police 
by the Department of Justice, in addi-
tion to ongoing local, State, and Fed-
eral investigations. 
Senator SMITH and I led a request 
with 26 Senators asking the Justice De-
partment to conduct what is called a 
pattern-and-practice 
investigation. 
This afternoon, the Minnesota Depart-
ment of Human Rights announced that 
they are going to investigate the police 
department as well. 
The words engraved on the Supreme 
Court building, ‘‘Equal Justice Under 
Law,’’ we know have never really been 
true for millions of African Americans, 
Hispanics, American Indians, and other 
minority groups. There is systematic 
racism at every level of our judicial 
system, and that calls for systematic 
change. 
We must take action to end unconsti-
tutional, 
discriminatory 
policing 
across the country. We can start by 
making sure that policemen’s conduct 
is independently investigated and that 
we hold officers criminally accountable 
when they break the law and violate 
the trust that is needed between law 
enforcement officers and the people 
they have sworn to protect. 
We also need strong Federal require-
ments for State and local police to col-
lect and report data on the use of force. 
Right now, a patchwork of local poli-
cies, many of which allow local police 
to avoid accountability, make it far 
too difficult to identify and address 
patterns of discrimination and exces-
sive force in police departments. Better

data will help hold officers and depart-
ments accountable. 
Broader criminal justice reform and 
the standard for use of force—all of 
those things must change. As I men-
tioned, we have done something. We 
passed the First Step Act when it 
comes to sentencing, but now we need 
to take on the Second Step Act to cre-
ate incentives for States to restore dis-
cretion for mandatory sentencing for 
nonviolent offenders and reform the 
conditions in State prisons and local 
jails. 
We know these conditions have got-
ten even worse during the coronavirus 
pandemic. Earlier today, we held a 
hearing in the Judiciary Committee 
about the continued injustice we are 
seeing in our prison system during this 
pandemic. While some people, like Paul 
Manafort, have been transferred to 
home confinement, others, like Andrea 
Circle Bear or Andrea High Bear, who 
is serving 26 months for a nonviolent 
drug offense and had just given birth 
while on a ventilator—why? She was 
exposed to the virus. So the question 
is, Why did a pregnant woman with a 
preexisting condition—an American In-
dian woman who was there for a non-
violent offense—why was she there in 
the prison system and Paul Manafort 
gets out? 
We should also create a diverse, bi-
partisan clemency advisory board—one 
that includes victim advocates as well 
as prison and sentencing reform advo-
cates—that would look at these issues 
from a different perspective. 
We should strengthen post-conviction 
reviews with conviction integrity units 
across the country. According to data 
from the National Registry of Exonera-
tions, there are currently fewer than 60 
conviction 
integrity 
units 
in 
the 
United States, and many of those are 
too weak to be effective. Attorney Gen-
eral Ellison and I have been working 
with prosecutors in Minnesota to set 
up a conviction integrity unit in the 
Twin Cities with strong, strong stand-
ards 
for 
independence 
and 
trans-
parency. This needs to happen nation-
ally. 
We should also expand post-convic-
tion sentencing reviews. Ensuring jus-
tice isn’t just looking back at a case to 
see whether the evidence was right; it 
is also looking to see whether the sen-
tence was right in a situation. 
All of this—expanding our Nation’s 
drug courts, which is something that I 
have been leading on in the Senate for 
years, 
changing 
that 
conversation 
about drug and alcohol treatment, re-
forming the cash bail system—if there 
is anything we as a Senate can do to 
eliminate injustice within our justice 
system, we should do it, and we should 
do it now. Talk is no longer enough. 
We know this pandemic has shed a 
light on the injustice we have already 
seen, as Senator DURBIN, who was here, 
and I discussed about the prison sys-
tem today. We also see it in the num-
ber of people dying. In Louisiana, Afri-
can Americans account for nearly 60 
percent of deaths but 33 percent of the 
population. In Georgia, a study of eight 
hospitals found that 80 percent of their 
COVID–19 patients were African Ameri-
cans yet 30 percent of the population. 
The workers on the frontline, the peo-
ple who are working not just in the 
hospitals, not just in the emergency 
rooms, but in the grocery stores, driv-
ing the public transportation, are get-
ting this virus—this sometimes fatal 
virus—at a much higher rate. This 
calls for not only the reforms that I 
laid out and that I have been advo-
cating for years but also calls for in-
vestment, like JIM CLYBURN’s plan to 
invest in underserved areas and impov-
erished areas that have been that way 
for a long, long time. Senator BOOKER 
is carrying that bill in the Senate. 
Martin Luther King once said that 
we are ‘‘all tied in a single garment of 
destiny. Whatever affects one of us di-
rectly, affects all indirectly.’’ That 
means, in the long term, an economy 
that works for everyone, with fair 
wages, with childcare, and with retire-
ment savings. It means closing the 
wealth gap. Black and Latino house-
holds have only about a tenth of the 
medium net worth right now of White 
households. It means voting rights. 
The scene that we saw in Wisconsin 
where people were standing in the rain 
with homemade masks and garbage 
bags just to be able to vote, risking 
their lives and their health, while the 
President of the United States was able 
to vote in the luxury of 1600 Pennsyl-
vania Avenue because he could get a 
mail-in ballot from Palm Beach, FL— 
that is a split screen for you. That is 
why people are out peacefully march-
ing. That is what they are angry about. 
It is police misconduct. It is the mur-
der of George Floyd. It is the longtime 
economic disparities, but it is also the 
longtime suppression of the vote and 
the unfairness of all of this. 
This has been a devastating time for 
Minnesota, but as George Floyd’s fam-
ily, whom I had the honor to talk with 
at length this weekend, said: We can-
not sink to the level of our oppressors, 
and we must not endanger others dur-
ing this pandemic. We will demand and 
ultimately force lasting change by 
shining a light on treatment that is 
horrific and unacceptable and by win-
ning justice. 
That is what they are talking about 
in Minnesota today. That was the spir-
it that I saw when my husband and I 
went to drop off food, where hundreds 
of people were there with thousands of 
bags of groceries because their grocery 
stores in that neighborhood had been 
burned to the core and their stores had 
been looted, not by the peaceful, right-
eous marchers but the people who were 
hiding behind them. 
I will end with this. A few years ago 
I went to Selma, AL, with Representa-
tive JOHN LEWIS, like so many Sen-
ators have done. I stood there on the 
bridge where he had his head beaten in. 
I was in awe of his persistence, his re-
silience, and his faith that this country 
could be better, if only we put in the 
work. That weekend, after 48 years, the 
White police chief of Montgomery 
handed his police badge to Congress-
man LEWIS and publicly apologized on 
behalf of the police for not protecting 
him 48 years before and not protecting 
his freedom marchers. 
I don’t want to take 48 years for my 
city and my State to heal or for our 
Nation to fix a justice system that has 
been broken since it was built. I want 
justice now. The people of this country 
deserve justice now. Everyone has a 
role to play in coming back from these 
crises. The protesters are shining a 
light on injustice that we have pushed 
to the shadows for far too long. The 
frontline workers and volunteers are 
serving the communities they love, and 
they are looking to all of us to deliver 
the reforms we promised—not just in 
speeches, not just in campaigns, but in 
reality, and not just for George Floyd. 
His legacy should be so much more 
than those 9 minutes—or Philando Cas-
tile or Jamar Clark or Breonna Tay-
lor—because we took an oath. 
We took an oath, colleagues. We 
didn’t wave a Bible in the air for a 
photo op. We placed our hand on that 
Bible, and we swore to support and de-
fend the Constitution of the United 
States against all enemies, foreign and 
domestic. The enemy we face now is 
racism. The enemy we face now is in-
justice. I don’t know what else to say 
because too many words have been 
said, and maybe it is time to stop talk-
ing. Maybe it is time to start acting. It 
is time to get to work. It is time to do 
our jobs. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first I 
would thank my friend and colleague, 
the senior Senator from Minnesota, for 
her eloquent, passionate words that 
tell the story of how she has done so 
much good and is working so hard to 
heal the wounds of Minnesota. We all 
appreciate it, Minnesotans and many 
Americans. 
Now, last night, as peaceful citizens 
exercised their constitutional right to 
protest in Lafayette Park, across from 
the White House, Federal law enforce-
ment officers were ordered to clear out 
the crowds with tear gas and rubber 
bullets so that President Trump could 
walk from the White House to a nearby 
church for a photo op. 
He did not enter the church. He did 
not offer words of prayer. The crowds 
were dispersed with force so that he 
could get his picture taken with a 
Bible that wasn’t his and was held up-
side down in front of a church he never 
asked to visit. 
I spoke at length about these events 
this morning. The aggressive use of 
force on law-abiding protesters was ap-
palling. It was an abuse of Presidential 
power. It may have been illegal. It was 
certainly a violation of the constitu-
tional rights of American citizens. The

June 2, 2020 
protesters, some of them children, 
many of them families, there in the 
public park to peacefully protest were 
met with rubber bullets and tear gas. 
This has no place in American society 
or any democracy worthy of the name. 
The President must cease his behavior. 
The images from last night should 
disturb all of us and must be con-
demned by the United States Senate. 
They cannot go unanswered, less the 
President be encouraged to do even 
greater abuse because he has no self-re-
straint. 
In a few minutes, I will ask the Sen-
ate’s consent to pass a simple resolu-
tion that says three things: first, that 
the constitutional rights of Americans 
must be respected; second, that vio-
lence and looting are unlawful and un-
acceptable; and, third, that Congress 
condemns the order to have Federal of-
ficers use gas and rubber bullets on 
peaceful protesters. 
This resolution is not a substitute for 
critical law enforcement and racial jus-
tice reforms that are badly needed, but 
this unconstitutional action by this 
lawless President requires a response 
from this body. 
I hope all Senators will support this 
resolution. Democrats are outraged. 
Republicans should be outraged as 
well. For my friends on the other side 
who claim they have not seen the 
events of last night, I suggest you find 
a moment and turn on the television. 
Our Republican colleagues cannot be 
objecting to our resolution on the false 
grounds that it doesn’t reject violence. 
It does. Let me read you the words 
again in the resolution: ‘‘Violence and 
looting are unlawful, unacceptable, and 
contrary to the purpose of peaceful 
protest.’’ It is right there in the resolu-
tion. 
What other reason would any Repub-
lican Senator have to object to the 
things in this resolution? If a Senator 
objects, they should be asked which of 
these things do they disagree with. Do 
they believe Americans do not have the 
constitutional right to exercise the 
freedom of speech, the freedom of as-
sembly, and the right to petition their 
government? Do they believe Ameri-
cans do not have the right to peace-
fully protest? Do they disagree with 
the 
statement 
that 
violence 
and 
looting are unlawful and unacceptable, 
or do they support the President’s use 
of tear gas against people, including 
families, who are peacefully protesting 
in a public park? Which is it? 
Any objector should explain why the 
simple resolution I offer today is so un-
acceptable to them. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of a concurrent resolution 
expressing the sense of the Congress 
that the constitutional rights of Amer-
icans must be respected; that violence 
and looting are unlawful and unaccept-
able; and that Congress condemns the 
President for ordering Federal officers 
to use gas and rubber bullets against 
peaceful 
protesters 
in 
Lafayette 
Square in Washington, DC, on June 1, 
2020; that the concurrent resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, 
and the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, first and 
foremost, I am a First Amendment ab-
solutist. The right to peaceful protest 
is absolutely sacrosanct. It is a core 
American liberty. When peaceful dem-
onstrations occur within the bounds of 
the law and with respect to the needs 
of law enforcement, leadership at every 
level has an obligation to respect and 
honor them. 
Our Nation must not turn a deaf ear 
to the anger, pain, or frustration of 
Black Americans. Our Nation needs to 
hear them. There is no question that 
the killing of George Floyd was hor-
rific. In my view, it absolutely appears 
to have been a heinous act of criminal 
violence. It is totally unacceptable 
that Mr. Floyd is dead. There is no 
doubt that residual racism continues 
to be a stain on our country. We need 
to do more to address it. 
Over the last few days, we have seen 
peaceful protests hijacked on a nightly 
basis into a rolling series of riots that 
engulfed great American cities in wan-
ton destruction and violent crime. 
These are the two issues the Amer-
ican people are focused on: justice for 
Black Americans in the face of unjust 
violence and peace for our country in 
the face of looting, riots, and domestic 
terror. Those are the two issues that 
Americans want addressed: racial jus-
tice and ending riots. 
Unfortunately, this resolution from 
my friend the Democratic leader does 
not address either one of them. In-
stead, it just indulges in the myopic 
obsession with President Trump that 
has come to define the Democratic side 
of the aisle. It pays more attention to 
the precise ways that Federal law en-
forcement protects Presidential move-
ments around the White House than to 
the fact that great American cities, in-
cluding my colleague’s beloved New 
York, have been consumed by rioting, 
looting, and violence against police for 
several nights in a row, with no end in 
sight. 
Outside of the Washington, DC, bub-
ble, there is no universe where Ameri-
cans think Democrats’ obsession with 
condemning President Trump is a more 
urgent priority than ending the riots 
or advancing racial justice. There is no 
universe in which the dynamics of La-
fayette Park before the President seeks 
to exit the White House is a more ur-
gent national priority than the shat-
tered glass, destroyed businesses, and 
brutal attacks on law enforcement that 
are happening nationwide in places 
like Lafayette Street in New York 
City. 
I will object to my distinguished col-
league’s thin resolution and will offer 
something more full-throated in its 
place. 
My resolution would condemn a long 
pattern of unjust police violence to-
ward Black Americans. It would cham-
pion the First Amendment and praise 
the peaceful protests that followed Mr. 
Floyd’s death. It would clearly con-
demn the violent rioting that has para-
lyzed places like New York City and in-
sist that local authorities finally get 
serious about protecting the innocent. 
I hope my distinguished colleague 
will not object. America is united and 
outraged at the death of Mr. Floyd, and 
I hope we can unite to condemn these 
senseless riots and move forward to-
gether as one Nation. Therefore, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 601 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, as 
in if legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the consideration of S. Res. 601 sub-
mitted earlier today. I ask unanimous 
consent that the resolution be agreed 
to, the preamble be agreed to, and the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is 
very simple why the Republican leader 
objected to our resolution and offers 
this one instead. It is because they do 
not want to condemn what the Presi-
dent did, though every fair-minded 
American of any political party would. 
We certainly should condemn vio-
lence. Let me repeat: This resolution 
condemns violence. But it is insuffi-
cient, in the light of what happened 
yesterday, to just condemn violence 
and not condemn what the President 
did as well, so I will object to my col-
league’s resolution. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.

The question is, Will the Senate ad-

There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

f 
REMEMBERING PETER M. PINO 
Mr. HEINRICH. Madam President, it 
is an honor to recognize the enor-
mously impactful life of Governor 
Peter M. Pino. The Pueblo of Zia, and 
New Mexico as a whole, have lost one 
of our greatest leaders. 
Peter M. Pino devoted his entire life 
to serving the people of the Pueblo of 
Zia. For more than four decades, he 
served the Pueblo of Zia as Governor, 
War Chief, Tribal council member, 
Tribal administrator, and treasurer. He 
was also a traditional spiritual leader 
and held a lifetime appointment as one 
of the Pueblo’s Keeper of Songs. As a 
traditional artist, Governor Pino em-
ployed techniques passed down to him 
by his Puebloan ancestors to craft 
works in rock, tan deer hides, and 
make moccasins, bows, arrows, digging 
sticks, rabbit sticks, and bone tools. 
He also played an instrumental role 
in the Pueblo’s ongoing effort to repa-
triate and protect a treasured part of 
Zia’s heritage and cultural property, 
its sacred sun symbol. Almost a cen-
tury after the State of New Mexico ap-
propriated this sacred symbol on its 
flag, Pino helped lead the Pueblo’s ac-
tions to seek compensation, public edu-
cation and engagement, and permission 
for commercial uses. Thanks to this 
work, Eastern New Mexico University 
changed the name of its women’s ath-
letic teams, and multiple companies 
have voluntarily sought permission 
and advice from the Pueblo on how 
they will depict the symbol and con-
tributed proceeds from sales to a schol-
arship fund for Zia youth. 
Governor Pino also used his deep his-
torical and archaeological knowledge 
to serve on boards and committees that 
advised 
the 
Crow 
Canyon 
Archae-
ological Center, Mesa Verde National 
Park, and the Native American Rights 
Fund. Governor Pino also served as 
vice chair of the New Mexico Office of 
Indian Affairs and was the first Native 
American to serve on the New Mexico 
Game and Fish Commission. 
On a personal note, Governor Pino 
was one of my first mentors in public 
service in New Mexico and dear friend. 
He shared traditional knowledge and 
perspectives with me that helped form 
the foundation of my respect for Tribal 
governments, religions, and culture. I 
am heartbroken that I did not spend 
more time learning directly from Gov-
ernor Pino because his generosity knew 
no bounds. I was, however, fortunate 
enough to attend a number of feast 
days at the Pueblo of Zia and left the 
Pino home with a tighter belt and 
great appreciation for the delicious and 
healthy traditional food that Peter and 
his wife Stella embraced. 
When I began advocating for land 
conservation in New Mexico, Governor 
Pino showed me how important sacred 
sites and cultural landscapes are to the 
Tribal nations in our State. He was 
also an example of statesmanship to 
whom I will always look. In fact, I was 
able to travel to Washington, DC, with 
Governor Pino when I was just a city 
councilor. Observing how he interacted 
with my State’s congressional delega-
tion was a very formative experience. 
Watching him work to protect the 
Ojito Wilderness and reclaim lands 
from the Bureau of Land Management 
that 
contained 
cultural 
sites 
also 
taught me how critical it is for Tribes 
to have a meaningful seat at the table 
in conservation and land management 
decisions. 
My 
thoughts 
are 
with 
Governor 
Pino’s family and the Pueblo of Zia 
during this time of mourning. His leg-
acy will never be forgotten.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING IDEAL ALUMINUM 
PRODUCTS, LLC 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize a small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit at the heart of our 
country. It is my privilege to recognize 
a small business that is known for ex-
cellence in its industry, outstanding 
craftsmanship, and creating dignified 
work in their community. This week, 
it is my pleasure to recognize Ideal 
Aluminum Products, LLC of St. Augus-
tine, FL, as the Senate Small Business 
of the Week. 
In 2010, Michael Siegel and Doug 
Brady purchased Ideal Aluminum Prod-
ucts. Based in DeLand, FL, this fence, 
gate, and railing manufacturing com-
pany had recently gone out of business. 
Doug, an alumnus of the University of 
South Florida, had also worked with 
Michael at Ideal Gas, LLC. Together, 
the two planned to turn this new com-
pany around. 
Over the next decade, Michael and 
Doug grew Ideal Aluminum into an in-
dustry leader. A favorable business en-
vironment 
and 
proximity 
to 
I–95 
spurred Ideal Aluminum’s relocation to 
St. Augustine in 2015. Their success as 
a local manufacturer and commitment 
to job creation was honored by then- 
Governor Rick Scott, who issued a 
monthly job report at their facility in 
2016. 
Ideal Aluminum has been an ardent 
supporter of community development. 
In 2011, Ideal Aluminum manufactured, 
donated, and installed railings for 
ABC’s ‘‘Extreme Makeover: Home Edi-
tion.’’ They were recognized in 2015 by

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2648 
June 2, 2020 
GrowFL, which spotlights businesses 
that create quality jobs, enrich their 
communities, and broaden new indus-
tries throughout Florida. Ideal Alu-
minum was nominated for the Florida 
Sterling 
Manufacturing 
Business 
Award in 2017 for business excellence in 
Florida’s manufacturing community. 
Michael and Doug were finalists for the 
Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the 
Year award in 2017 and 2018. Ideal Alu-
minum has also been featured in the 
St. Augustine Record and industry 
publications. 
Like many other small businesses, 
Ideal Aluminum stepped up to help 
their 
community 
during 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. When Michael 
and Doug heard about the shortage of 
blood donations, they organized a blood 
drive at Ideal Aluminum and collected 
donations for Feeding Northeast Flor-
ida. The company matched every dollar 
collected, resulting in a $3,000 donation 
to feed the hungry in the St. Augustine 
area. 
When the U.S. Small Business Ad-
ministration—SBA—launched the Pay-
check Protection Program—PPP—Mi-
chael and Doug applied immediately. 
The PPP provides forgivable loans to 
impacted small businesses and non-
profits who maintain their payroll dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. In late 
April, Ideal Aluminum received a PPP 
loan and an Economic Injury Disaster 
Loan from the SBA. As a result, they 
were able to keep all of their employ-
ees paid. 
Ideal Aluminum Products exempli-
fies how crucial small businesses are in 
creating jobs and building the local 
community. I commend their efforts to 
create jobs in the critical manufac-
turing sector. 
Congratulations to Michael, Doug, 
and the entire team at Ideal Alu-
minum. I look forward to watching 
your continued growth and success.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. SMITH): 
S. 3864. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to eliminate 
the 190-day lifetime limit on inpatient 
psychiatric hospital services under the 
Medicare Program; to the Committee 
on Finance. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Medicare Men-
tal Health Inpatient Equity Act, legis-
lation that eliminates Medicare’s arbi-
trary 190-day lifetime cap on inpatient 
services in psychiatric hospitals. This 
change is long overdue given the steps 
that Congress has taken to improve 
coverage of mental health services. I 
am pleased to be joined by Senator 
TINA SMITH (D–MN), who has been a 
champion for greater access to mental 
health care. 
Left untreated, mental illnesses are 
some of the most disabling and de-
structive illnesses afflicting Ameri-
cans. Unfortunately, our current men-
tal health system is fragmented, and 
family members with serious mental 
illness all too often lack access to the 
care that they need. That is why I have 
worked consistently and vigorously to 
improve mental health services across 
the lifespan. 
I was an original cosponsor of the 
Senator Paul Wellstone Mental Health 
Parity Act, a landmark law that gen-
erally prevents group health plans and 
health insurance issuers that provide 
mental health or substance use dis-
order benefits from imposing less fa-
vorable benefit limitations on those 
benefits than on medical and surgical 
benefits. I was a longtime supporter of 
the Excellence in Mental Health Act, 
which increased Americans’ access to 
community mental health and sub-
stance use treatment services through 
the Certified Community Behavioral 
Health Clinic (CCBHC). I have also 
worked with my colleagues Senator 
DURBIN and Senator PORTMAN to sup-
port greater residential treatment op-
tions by modifying Medicaid’s restric-
tive Institute of Mental Disease exclu-
sion as part of the Substance Use-Dis-
order Prevention that Promotes Opioid 
Recovery and Treatment for Patients 
and Communities Act (the ‘‘SUPPORT 
Act’’). 
As chairman of the Aging Com-
mittee, I also recognize that seniors 
have significant unmet mental health

needs and that their Medicare coverage 
can be greatly improved. I was an 
original cosponsor of the Medicare 
Mental Health Copayment Equity Act, 
which was signed into law in 2008, that 
eliminated higher outpatient copay-
ments for mental health services I have 
also recently re-introduced legislation 
with Senator BROWN that would update 
the Medicare program by recognizing 
clinical psychologists as independent 
care providers, thus expanding mental 
health care options and access for 
Medicare beneficiaries. 
The legislation I am introducing 
today breaks down another barrier in 
Medicare, the 190-day lifetime cap on 
inpatient services in psychiatric hos-
pitals. No other Medicare inpatient 
service has these types of arbitrary 
caps, which is why elimination of Medi-
care’s lifetime cap was a recommenda-
tion of the 2016 White House Mental 
Health and Substance Use Disorder 
Parity Task Force. 
I recognize that this cap was origi-
nally intended to limit the federal gov-
ernment’s role in paying for long-term 
custodial support of the mentally ill. 
And no one wants to go back to the 
abusive days of long term institu-
tionalization, which is why l have 
championed so many measures to help 
bolster community mental health re-
sources. At the same time, keeping a 
cap on inpatient days at psychiatric 
hospitals—particularly 
for 
patients 
who have been living with serious men-
tal illness from a young age—under-
mines patient treatment options and 
can lead to disruptive transitions of 
care. Many general hospitals lack psy-
chiatric capacity and there are count-
less examples across the country of 
psychiatric boarding in emergency de-
partments. Skilled nursing facilities 
may not be best suited to provide the 
complex and specialized psychiatric 
care these beneficiaries need. Finally, 
too many patients find themselves re-
ceiving care in prisons. 
According to a 2019 Mathematica re-
port commissioned by the Department 
of Health and Human Services, most 
fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries 
who use inpatient psychiatric facilities 
have primary diagnoses of schizo-
phrenia, major depressive disorder, and 
bipolar disorder, but Alzheimer’s and 
related diagnoses are also common. We 
need to help patients with serious men-
tal illness recover regardless of the set-
ting where they are receiving care. The 
Medicare Mental Health Inpatient Eq-
uity Act is supported by a wide range 
of mental health groups, including the 
National Association of Behavioral 
Healthcare, the American Psychiatric 
Association, 
the 
American 
Psycho-
logical Association, and Mental Health 
America. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
601—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE THAT ORDER MUST BE 
IMMEDIATELY 
RESTORED 
TO 
THE 
CITIES 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES SO THAT CITIZENS MAY 
HAVE PEACE AND THE LEGITI-
MATE GRIEVANCES OF PEACE-

PROTESTORS 
MAY 
BE 
HEARD AND CONSIDERED 
Mr. MCCONNELL submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 601 
Whereas the killing of George Floyd (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘Mr. Floyd’’) by 
a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, 
was a deeply immoral and reprehensible act 
for which justice must be done under the 
law; 
Whereas other apparent instances of unjust 
police violence, such as the recent killing of 
Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, 
must be met with immediate, thorough in-
vestigations and full justice; 
Whereas the United States cannot fully re-
alize the constitutional promise of equal pro-
tection and equal justice under the law until 
unjust police violence against Black Ameri-
cans has been further addressed; 
Whereas the peaceful demonstrations for 
justice and change following the death of Mr. 
Floyd are noble and patriotic; 
Whereas it is the sacrosanct constitutional 
right of all people of the United States to 
demonstrate peacefully in favor of social and 
political change; 
Whereas the constitutional rights of citi-
zens unequivocally do not include any right 
to— 
(1) loot, pillage, burn, or destroy property; 
(2) attack police officers; or 
(3) disobey lawful orders of the police; 
Whereas the violent rioting and mayhem 
that has descended on cities of the United 
States in the week preceding the date of in-
troduction of this resolution is unjustifiable 
and immoral; 
Whereas it is the fundamental responsi-
bility of all governments to secure domestic 
tranquility and protect the lives and prop-
erty of their citizens so that those citizens 
may exercise their rights and liberties in 
peace; 
Whereas State and local governments bear 
primary responsibility for restoring order 
and suppressing these violent riots; 
Whereas the Federal Government should 
stand ready to provide whatever aid is re-
quested or necessary to restore order and 
tranquility in the streets of the United 
States; and 
Whereas the men and women of local and 
Federal law enforcement agencies and the 
National Guard have acted with tremendous 
bravery and honor across the United States 
in the face of rioting, mayhem, and brutal 
attacks: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that order must be immediately restored to 
the cities of the United States so that— 
(1) citizens may have peace; and 
(2) the legitimate grievances of peaceful 
protestors may be heard and considered. 
SENATE RESOLUTION 602—RECOG-
NIZING THAT THE MURDER OF 
GEORGE FLOYD BY OFFICERS OF 
THE MINNEAPOLIS POLICE DE-
PARTMENT IS THE RESULT OF 
PERVASIVE AND SYSTEMIC RAC-
ISM THAT CANNOT BE DISMAN-
TLED WITHOUT, AMONG OTHER 
THINGS, 
PROPER 
REDRESS 
IN 
THE COURTS 
Mr. BOOKER (for Mr. MARKEY (for 
himself, Mr. BOOKER, Ms. WARREN, Mr. 
VAN HOLLEN, and Mr. SANDERS)) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 602 
Whereas Black people in the United States 
are disproportionately the victims of shoot-
ings, chokeholds, and other uses of excessive 
force by law enforcement officers; 
Whereas the use of excessive force during 
an arrest or investigatory stop constitutes 
an unreasonable seizure under the Fourth 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States, which guarantees the right of 
every person in the United States to be free 
from unreasonable searches and seizures at 
the hands of law enforcement officers; 
Whereas the use of excessive force during a 
period of pretrial detention constitutes the 
deprivation of due process under the Fifth 
and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of 
the United States, which guarantee the right 
of every person in the United States to be 
free from arbitrary interference with the lib-
erty of that person at the hands of law en-
forcement officers; 
Whereas the use of excessive force during a 
term of imprisonment constitutes the use of 
cruel and unusual punishment under the 
Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States, which guarantees the 
right of every person in the United States to 
be free from cruel and unusual punishment 
at the hands of law enforcement officers; 
Whereas section 1979 of the Revised Stat-
utes (42 U.S.C. 1983), which is derived from 
the first section of the Act of April 20, 1871 
(commonly known as and referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘Civil Rights Act of 1871’’) 
(17 Stat. 13, chapter 22), makes liable ‘‘every 
person’’, including police officers, correc-
tional officers, and other law enforcement 
officers, who, under color of law, deprives an-
other person of civil rights; 
Whereas the judicial doctrine of qualified 
immunity wrongly and unjustly precludes 
the victims of police violence from vindi-
cating the rights of those victims under sec-
tion 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 
1983)— 
(1) by effectively immunizing law enforce-
ment officers from civil suit unless a prior 
court case has ‘‘clearly established’’ that the 
challenged use of excessive force is illegal; 
and 
(2) by narrowly construing the ‘‘clearly es-
tablished’’ standard so that any factual or 
contextual distinctions between the chal-
lenged use of excessive force and the use of 
excessive force in a prior case, even small or 
insignificant distinctions, are cause for 
qualified immunity with respect to the chal-
lenged use of excessive force; 
Whereas the defense of qualified immunity 
has no historical common law basis; 
Whereas the intent of Congress in enacting 
the Civil Rights Act of 1871 was to hold State 
and local law enforcement officers account-
able for intimidating, harming, and mur-
dering Black people in the United States 
after the Civil War; 
Whereas, in 2017, Supreme Court Justice 
Clarence Thomas recognized that the defense

of qualified immunity has no textual basis in 
section 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 
U.S.C. 1983) and thereby represents ‘‘pre-
cisely the sort of freewheeling policy choice’’ 
that courts ‘‘have previously disclaimed the 
power to make’’; 
Whereas the courts of appeals of the 
United States are more likely than not to 
grant qualified immunity to law enforce-
ment officers; 
Whereas, in 2018, Supreme Court Justice 
Sonia Sotomayor acknowledged that the Su-
preme Court of the United States ‘‘routinely 
displays an unflinching willingness’’ to re-
verse decisions of the courts of appeals of the 
United States denying qualified immunity to 
law enforcement officers; 
Whereas the lack of accountability that re-
sults from qualified immunity arouses frus-
tration, disappointment, and anger through-
out the United States, which discredits and 
endangers the vast majority of law enforce-
ment officers, who do not engage in the use 
excessive force; 
Whereas a civil action under section 1979 of 
the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1983) is often 
the only viable solution for victims of police 
violence and the families of those victims to 
hold law enforcement officers accountable 
for the use of excessive force because crimi-
nal prosecutors are reluctant to charge, and 
juries are hesitant to convict, law enforce-
ment officers; and 
Whereas the Government of the United 
States has established itself as a government 
of laws, and not of men, but will cease to be 
so if it does not furnish a viable remedy for 
all civil rights violations: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes and acknowledges the legal 
and racial inequities inherent in the judicial 
doctrine of qualified immunity as that doc-
trine is applied to law enforcement officers; 
(2) recognizes and acknowledges that the 
doctrine of qualified immunity rests on a 
mistaken judicial interpretation of a statute 
enacted by Congress; and 
(3) recognizes and acknowledges that, to 
correct that mistaken judicial interpreta-
tion, Congress should amend section 1979 of 
the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1983) to 
eliminate the qualified immunity defense for 
law enforcement officers as that defense ex-
ists as of June 1, 2020.

SENATE THAT STATE AGENCIES

SHOULD

SURE THAT SIBLINGS REMAIN 
TOGETHER IN THE FOSTER CARE

Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mr. 
BLUNT, Mr. KAINE, Mrs. CAPITO, Ms. 
ROSEN, Mr. LANKFORD, Mr. MORAN, Mrs. 
LOEFFLER, Mr. INHOFE, and Mr. TILLIS) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 603 
Whereas sibling relationships are impor-
tant and should be recognized and respected; 
Whereas sibling relationships provide need-
ed continuity and stability during the place-
ment of a child in foster care; 
Whereas the sibling bond is unique and sep-
arate from the parent-child bond, and may 
include relations with people not linked by 
blood; 
Whereas siblings share similar history, 
heritage, culture, and often biology; 
Whereas the Fostering Connections to Suc-
cess and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 
(Public Law 110–351; 122 Stat. 3949) requires 
that States make reasonable efforts— 
(1) to place siblings removed from their 
home in the same foster care, kinship guard-
ianship, or adoptive placement, unless the 
State documents that such a joint placement 
would be contrary to the safety or well-being 
of any of the siblings; and 
(2) in a case where siblings are removed 
from their home and not placed jointly, to 
provide for frequent visitation or interaction 
between the siblings, unless the State docu-
ments that frequent visitation or interaction 
would be contrary to the safety or well-being 
of any of the siblings; 
Whereas sibling separation is a significant 
and distinct loss that must be ameliorated 
by frequent and regular contact; and 
Whereas all foster children deserve the 
right to know and be actively involved in the 
lives of their siblings absent extraordinary 
circumstances: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that State agencies and other providers of 
foster care services should— 
(1) make every effort to ensure that chil-
dren are placed in homes with their siblings; 
(2) ensure that siblings who are not placed 
together are provided with ample opportuni-
ties to communicate with each other and re-
main connected; and 
(3) in a case where siblings are not placed 
jointly, document the reasons why.

RACISM 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I rise 
today with difficulty. I admit I am like 
so many other Americans who are 
hurting right now and frustrated right 
now and feeling a torrent of emotions 
that I wish I could say it was the first 
time I felt like this. 
I want to begin my remarks in a dif-
ferent way because the names that we 
are hearing shouted on streets—George 
Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Tay-
lor—are like so many other names of 
people that we did not know as a Na-
tion. They were not household names. 
Their names now are mixed into names 
that we have heard throughout my en-
tire lifetime. But their names—and the 
way we say them mixed with horror 
and sadness and tragedy—it does not 
speak to their beauty, their humanity, 
the fullness, the texturedness of their 
lives. I just want to say that Ahmaud 
Arbery was a man, and he was 25 years 
old when he was murdered. He went out 
jogging where he was hunted by two 
White men who walked free for weeks 
after killing him. 
This man, this child of God, his loved 
ones talked to his humanity. They said 
he was a loving son, a brother, an 
uncle, a nephew, a cousin, and a friend. 
He was humble. He was kind. He was

well mannered. He always made sure 
that he never departed his loved ones 
without saying ‘‘I love you.’’ 
Breonna Taylor, before we knew her 
name—an extraordinary American, an 
extraordinary servant—she was a first 
responder. In a pandemic, like so many 
of our first responders, she showed a 
courage and humble heroism. She was 
26 years old when she was shot and 
killed by police, asleep in her home. 
She was an emergency medical techni-
cian in Louisville. 
Her loved ones, too, shared the truth 
of her spirit. They said Breonna Taylor 
was full of life. She loved social gath-
erings with her friends and especially 
her family. She loved life and all it had 
to offer. She continued to find ways to 
better herself and all of the people 
around her. 
George Floyd, he was a man that was 
raised in Texas. He was a Houston man. 
To his friends and loved ones, he was 
known as Floyd. In high school—I 
know this—he was an athlete, playing 
both basketball and football. He played 
the position I played; he was a tight 
end. He went on to play basketball at 
South Florida State College, a pathway 
I know to college ball. His girlfriend 
called him ‘‘an angel that was sent to 
us on Earth.’’ His family remembered 
him as being family oriented, loving, 
and godly. 
Floyd was a loving father. He was a 
devoted brother. He was a partner, and 
he was a friend. He is dead at 46 years 
old, on May 25, 2020, when he was re-
strained, pinned by his neck, and killed 
by law enforcement officers. 
The killings of George Floyd, of 
Breonna Taylor, of Ahmaud Arbery are 
singular in their pain, are singular in 
their particular details in the anguish 
and the horror, but this is a terror that 
is familiar. It is a fear that is baked 
now, cemented into our culture. 
For so many Americans, especially 
Black Americans, this has not just not 
been a tough few weeks. It has not just 
been an emotional time because of 
what we are seeing, the protests all 
around the country. This has been a 
tough life. This is the story of day 
after day after day that punctuates our 
consciousness only when someone cap-
tures on videotape what is a regular 
part of the fabric of our country. 
We have a long and wretched and dis-
turbing history in this country of 
Black people being murdered by law 
enforcement. Our systems of account-
ability, our systems of transparency, 
our ability to end this has improved 
impotent and feeble. These killings for 
so many Black Americans today are 
searing reminders that Black people in 
this country, as I have heard from doz-
ens of people in my life, as we hear 
from people on our media, that this 
could have been me; that this even 
would have been me in the same cir-
cumstances. To hear people at all sta-
tions of life—African-Americans say-
ing—‘‘I am alive,’’ but questioning for 
how long, slipping into the savage re-
ality of despair for your life and your 
safety. 
To be Black in America is to know 
that a misunderstanding, that an im-
plicit racial bias, that an interaction 
that should be everyday and routine 
can become a moment where your life 
is turned upside down, where your body 
becomes broken or when you are killed. 
It is a common experience. This has 
been a stretch where bird watching in a 
park, to jogging in your neighborhood, 
to going to a corner store, it is a jar-
ring reminder that is reinforced by per-
sonal experiences that it could be you. 
I was born to two civil rights activist 
parents. I was a big kid. I was over 6 
feet by the time I was in seventh or 
eighth grade, and it was a time in my 
life that is a coming of age for so many 
people and cultures across our Nation. 
But something began happening to me 
in that period, and it was marked by 
the fear of my elders. Family members 
with jarring personal stories for a 
preteen or a teen would tell me what it 
meant to be Black, to be male in Amer-
ica. They were instilling fear in me as 
a survival mechanism. They were try-
ing to make me aware of my sur-
roundings. 
I have difficult memories of trips to 
the malls with elder Black men in my 
family and being lectured about what I 
couldn’t do, what I shouldn’t do, and 
what the consequences could be. I re-
member that talk with my parents 
where I tried to joke about it, but they 
got chillingly angry with me about 
what it meant to have a driver’s li-
cense in America and what could hap-
pen to me. They told me stories of 
friends, of family members, of others 
and their experiences with the police. 
I spent those years of 12 and 13 in an 
America in the ’70s and ’80s where the 
words of my parents and elders were 
backed up with tragic and terrible sto-
ries of their experiences in generations 
before and were reinforced by my own 
experiences: being followed by mall se-
curity 
guards, 
being 
accused 
or 
stopped, being looked at with sus-
picion, and experience after experience 
after experience with police. 
I remember as a college student—and 
it all came to a head where I wrote a 
column in Stanford’s newspaper: Why 
have I lost control? I remember that 
night writing that column like it was 
yesterday. I was so overcome with 
emotion and rage, and I would like to 
submit for the RECORD that column and 
read right now pieces of what I wrote 
that night that when I look at young 
men on the streets of America today 
and I see their anger and I see their 
rage, it brings me back, not to that 
moment, but to the own feelings that 
have churned within me for years. 
I will read from the column: Why 
have I lost control? 
How can I write, when I have lost control 
of my emotions? Not guilty. Not guilty. Not 
guilty. 
Not shocked. Why not? 
Turn off the engine! Put your keys, driv-
er’s license, registration and insurance on 
the hood now! Put your hands on the steer-
ing wheel and don’t even think of moving. 
Five police cars. Six officers surrounded 
my car, guns ready. Thirty minutes I sat, 
praying and shaking, only interrupted by the 
command, ‘‘I said, don’t move!’’ 
Finally, ‘‘Everything checks out, you can 
go.’’ 
Sheepishly I asked, why. 
‘‘Oh, you fit the description of a car thief.’’ 
Not guilty. Not shocked. Why not. 
In the jewelry store, they lock the case 
when I walk in. 
In the shoe store, they help the White man 
who walks in after me. 
In the shopping mall, they follow me—in 
the Stanford shopping mall. Last month I 
turned and faced their surreptitious secu-
rity: ‘‘Catch any thieves today?’’ 
Not guilty. Not shocked. Why not? 
I am a black man. I am 6 foot 3 inches tall 
and 230 pounds, just like Rodney King. Do I 
scare you? Am I a threat? Does your fear jus-
tify your actions? Twelve people [a jury] be-
lieved it did. 
Black male: Guilty until proven innocent. 
Reactions to my kind are justified. Scru-
tiny is justified. Surveillance is justified. 
Search is justified. Fifty-six blows justified. 
Justice? Dear God. 
I graduated from Stanford last June. I was 
elated. I was one of four presidents of my 
class—I was proud. In the fall, I received a 
Rhodes Scholarship. I approached arrogance. 
But late one night, as I walked the streets 
of Palo Alto, as the police car slowed down 
while passing me, as his steely glare met me, 
I realized that to him and to so many others 
I am and [may] always be— 
And I substitute now— 
—I am and may always be the [N-word]: 
Guilty until proven innocent. 
I am struggling to be articulate, loqua-
cious, positive, constructive, but for the first 
time in so long, I have lost control of my 
emotions: Rage, frustration, bitterness, ani-
mosity, 
exasperation, 
sadness. 
Emotions 
once suppressed, emotions once channeled, 
now are let loose. Why? 
Not guilty. Not shocked. 
Poverty, alienation, estrangement, con-
tinuously aggravated by racism, overt and 
institutional. Can you leave your neighbor-
hood without being stopped? Can you get a 
loan from your bank? Can you be trusted at 
your store? 
Can you get an ambulance dispatched to 
your neighborhood? Can you get the police 
to come to your house? Can you get an edu-
cation at your school? Can you get a job? 
Can you stay alive past 25? Can you get re-
spect? Can you be heard? 
No! Not until someone catches on video 
one small glimpse of your everyday reality 
and even then, can you get justice? 
Why have I lost control of my emotions? 
Why do my hands shake as I write? Tonight, 
I have no answers. 
Dear God, help us to help ourselves before 
we become our own undoing. 
That was three decades ago. That 
was me as an early 20-something, writ-
ing about another one of those names 
that has become household. We remem-
ber it decades later. I wish I could 
stand here and tell you that much has 
changed for the experience of that 
young Black man. I wish I could tell 
you that that was the end of names be-
coming household words, but it has 
not. 
This is a cycle of violence in our 
country; these spasms jerk us from our 
comfort and pull us into the world that 
is faced by so many African-Americans 
and then we go back. So many of us go 
back to what is now normal in Amer-
ica, what has been normal in America. 
This cycle—I hear people now talking 
about the violence, the rioters. I con-
demn it in the same way that the other

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2654 
June 2, 2020 
99 Members are. It is awful, it is des-
picable, it is contrary to the aims of 
this Nation and the movements of our 
past. But to condemn the violence of 
those out there doing such awful, de-
structive, 
condemnation-worthy 
ac-
tions, but to only condemn them and 
not to condemn the fullness of that 
cycle of violence because there is vio-
lence going on even when we don’t see 
it in the streets. 
Peace, even, is not just the absence 
of violence; it is the presence of jus-
tice. This is an unjust cycle in our 
country that we seem to be stuck in 
that makes the names of children like 
Tamir Rice household names. It is con-
nected with the violence that is perva-
sive in our Nation that demands all of 
us to speak out against with the same 
fervor and enthusiasm and energy that 
people are condemning the violence we 
are seeing in America today. To fail to 
do that leaves us in a state of imbal-
ance. To fail to condemn the totality of 
violence in our country leaves us far 
from the beloved community. We need 
to somehow find a way out of that 
cycle. 
There is violence in our Nation seen 
and our environment, that we still are 
a Nation where a person’s race is the 
single biggest factor of whether they 
live near a toxic site or not. Ask the 
mother of a child who drank lead water 
for months and months and has had 
their brain permanently damaged if 
that was not violence. It is violence to 
not have access to quality care. Ask 
the woman who has lost her child be-
cause of lack of prenatal care. Ask the 
Black woman in America, who today is 
four times more likely to die, herself, 
in childbirth if this isn’t a violence in 
our society that needs condemnation. 
It 
is 
violence 
we 
see 
from 
our 
healthcare system, to our criminal jus-
tice system, to environmental injus-
tice, to the denial, as one author says, 
of the savage inequalities within our 
education systems. 
It is why so many Black Americans 
scream out: Do you see me? I do not 
have your equal justice under law. Do 
you see me? I do not have justice for 
all. Do you see me? I matter. I matter. 
Black lives matter. Black bodies mat-
ter. America, I love you. Do you see 
me? Do you know my experiences? Do 
you see the failings of our ideals? 
The murder of a Black man by mul-
tiple cops who knew they were being 
filmed in broad daylight is not the ex-
tent of the problem of racism in Amer-
ica. It is a final and deadly manifesta-
tion of that racism of a nation where 
everything about us is interwoven, it is 
interconnected, and we are in relation-
ship with each other. 
This ideal that we are one Nation is 
not a quaint ideal. It is an inescapable 
fact of American society. The pain and 
the hurt of our brothers or sisters is 
our pain. I can show you that economi-
cally. I can show you that by every ide-
ology that is expressed here on the 
floor of this Senate. 
The cycle of violence has to stop, the 
cycle of wretchedness and hurt. Our an-
cestors scream out at us now. Millions 
of Americans scream out right now, 
and I know we have an obligation in 
this body to do something. 
I have heard words from people on 
both sides of the aisle speaking toward 
the injustice of racism that exists in 
our country. I have heard words. But 
for generations what they sought from 
this body—greater men and women 
that any of us—what they sought on 
the streets, what they sought in front 
of the White House, from Alice Paul, 
the first person to protest out there, 
was legislative changes. That is what 
they sought. 
The march on Washington. Disability 
activists were throwing themselves out 
in front of buses. They fought for tan-
gible legislation. 
Martin Luther King said: 
While it may be true that morality cannot 
be legislated, behavior can be regulated. It 
may be true that the law cannot change the 
heart but it can restrain the heartless. It 
may be true that the law cannot make a man 
love me but it can keep him from lynching 
me. 
It is on us. The cries for justice in 
the street, it is on us. The pain being 
made manifest for all America to see, 
it is on us. Those who have been com-
fortable for too long are now pulled 
from their seats as they stare at a tele-
vision that shows them a window into 
a nation that is not at rest. It is on us 
in this body to do something, to change 
the law. We can do that. 
In the coming days, Senator KAMALA 
HARRIS and I have partnered together 
on a comprehensive police reform pro-
posal that takes into account the in-
credible work of Congressional Black 
Caucus members, many of them who 
have been in this congressional body 
much longer than I have. They have 
been working on these issues much 
longer than I have. It takes the work of 
so many people in both of the bodies 
that make up our Congress and pulls 
them together. 
There are so many injustices, but 
this comprehensive package is about 
police accountability. It is an answer 
to the pain, to the hurt, and the agony. 
It speaks to the young children whose 
parents right now are teaching them 
fear as an art of survival, teaching 
them not to be a threat to anyone who 
could kill you, to try to shrink from 
the fullness of your body so that they 
don’t take your body, they don’t harm 
your body, and they don’t kill your 
body. It creates accountability and 
transparency and practices that can re-
pair police community relations. It can 
give faith back to those who have lost 
it. It can rescue people who are slip-
ping into a deeper despair about this 
Nation and perhaps cobble together 
some semblance of hope. 
This is a moment in American his-
tory where we must recognize the hurt 
and the pain and do something about it 
where this body that has so nobly acted 
in past years to pass legislation—the 
1964 Civil Rights Act, the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act, and the spasms of 1968. 
Fair housing laws were passed. 
I said I come to you today torn up in-
side. As so many Americans, the soil of 
our souls have been plowed up in pain, 
hoping for seeds of possibility, hoping 
that somehow, borne out of agony and 
despair, can sprout a new harvest for 
America. 
As a man who believes in this coun-
try and believes in the ideals of hope 
and love and faith and charity and 
kindness, I want to confess to you 
something, that right now hope is es-
sential, but it is not enough. I confess 
to you, right now, words of kindness 
and grace are essential to America, but 
they are not enough right now. I con-
fess to you even something that is hard 
to admit, that the spirit of courage and 
grit being shown by people on the 
streets—not in the comfortable hall-
ways of the Senate—who in one of the 
most noble traditions of our Nation are 
protesting, are petitioning their gov-
ernment, are peacefully gathering, I 
want to tell you, right now, that that 
is not enough. It is essential, but it is 
not enough. These things are nec-
essary, but not sufficient. 
So how? How do we go forward? In 
Washington, the people talk about 
being so savagely broken. How? At a 
time that I worry about King’s ideal of 
a beloved community, how do we cre-
ate that out of this moment? I do not 
know. 
But I want to tell you this: When I 
find myself disturbed and sad, when I 
find my heart that, on most days, has 
an invincible hope for our Nation, I 
turn to our history, but I don’t need to 
turn too far. 
I know the heroes whose names are 
hailed from generations past. I don’t 
know how Harriet Tubman, Ella Baker, 
and Fannie Lou Hamer mustered their 
strength and courage. They were mar-
velous magicians that could turn the 
most wretched of times into progress. 
So at a time that I need hope, I tell 
you I turn to the spiritual alchemists 
of our day. I met them. I have been to 
a church in South Carolina where 
White supremacists stormed in and 
murdered nine blessed souls. I have 
watched on a TV screen this spiritual 
alchemist who somehow turned the 
most unimaginable grief into forgive-
ness and a lesson for our Nation. 
I visited a church just a few months 
ago in Tulsa, OK. It was the last struc-
ture that was left standing out of one 
of the greatest acts of domestic ter-
rorism we had ever seen—the torching, 
the bombing of Black Wall Street—and 
I met a pastor there, Pastor Turner. He 
is a great spiritual alchemist, who 
somehow turned the only remaining 
structure—after horrific violence—he 
somehow turned it into a symbol of 
struggle. 
I have talked to mothers of the 
movement. These are these great Black 
women whose sons were murdered and 
are names we now know. I learned from 
them this unbelievable demonstration 
of spiritual alchemy, that somehow 
they turned their tragedies into a grit 
and guts and a determination to never

stop fighting as long as they have 
breath in their body and blood in their 
veins. They will fight for this Nation, 
even when it so savagely lets them 
down. 
I get strength from those in our Na-
tion today who demonstrated alchemy 
greater than any power I can possess, 
that somehow, in our darkest of times, 
we still are a Nation that can find a 
way to ignite the world, in a Nation 
where so many people have been so 
thoroughly failed, that they can still 
manifest the ability to fight for the 
ideals that have been denied for them. 
They are the ones right now whose 
spirit we all must try to summon. 
We will come up short, but we must 
try to summon it. It is the only way 
forward that, somehow, this Nation 
that shares one spirit can find a way to 
put enough indivisible into this one na-
tion under God, that somehow this 
great country can find a way in this 
time of our generation’s great crisis— 
that we, like those before us, those ma-
gicians, those alchemists of love and 
spirit and sweat and struggle—that out 
of this time of crisis, we can make this 
Nation truly one of liberty and justice 
for all. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). The Senator from Mary-
land. 
f 
RACISM 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, let me start by saying to our col-
league, the Senator from New Jersey 
who just spoke on the floor, that we 
are all thankful for his passion to 
make sure that this country lives up to 
its promise and for sharing with this 
body his personal testimony about rac-
ism and the need for all of us to move 
urgently to address the fundamental 
inequities at the heart of our society 
and institutions. I don’t think it is an 
overstatement to say that we are at a 
pivotal point in our country. It is a 
moment of reckoning. Historians will 
carefully examine this moment to see 
how our country responded to see 
which path we took, how the Senate re-
sponded, how each Senator responded. 
The immediate spark for this mo-
ment was the brutal murder of George 
Floyd by agents of government. In 
Minneapolis, a police officer aided and 
abetted by three other officers—we all 
witnessed the horror of George Floyd 
gasping ‘‘I can’t breathe’’ as a White 
officer kept his knee on his neck for 8 
minutes and 46 seconds; three other of-
ficers participated in the crime. All 
four need to be brought to justice, but 
the murder of George Floyd was not an 
isolated event in the United States of 
America. It is not the first time a 
Black man has called out ‘‘I can’t 
breathe’’ as he was choked or lynched. 
We can draw a straight line that runs 
from slavery to Jim Crow to legal seg-
regation to de facto segregation to in-
stitutional racism to the killings of 
Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Eric Gar-
ner, Freddie Gray, Breonna Taylor, and 
George Floyd, as well as the vigilante 
killings 
of 
Trayvon 
Martin 
and 
Ahmaud Arbery and others. 
The White police officer who looked 
at the video as he kept his knee on the 
neck of George Floyd thought he would 
get away with his actions because he 
and so many others had not been held 
accountable before. He thought he 
could get away with it, based on his ex-
perience. We must change that. As Sen-
ator BOOKER said, we can have our mo-
ments of silence, we can have vigils, 
but that is not enough. It is not nearly 
enough. This is a moment that de-
mands real action, real change, and 
real results, starting with changes in 
police practices and the systemic rac-
ism and institutions that have shielded 
those who engage in misconduct from 
accountability. 
Those changes must include estab-
lishing truly independent oversight 
mechanisms to ensure that those police 
officers who betrayed the public trust 
are held accountable. We must ban out-
right the use of chokeholds unless the 
officer’s life is in imminent danger, and 
we must use Federal leverage to 
incentivize deescalatory practices over 
escalatory ones. We need national 
standards backed up by real con-
sequences for those who do not comply, 
and we must establish a Federal 
databank that tracks reports of police 
misconduct—not 
simply 
unjustified 
killings by police, but all forms of mis-
conduct. These and others changes are 
required to ensure the protection of 
citizens, communities, and an over-
whelming number of police officers 
who are meeting their sworn oaths to 
protect our communities. Bad cops are 
bad for good cops, and we need to make 
sure we have a system in place to pun-
ish misconduct and reward those who 
are upholding their sworn duty. 
Now, while the murder of George 
Floyd and others has, again, exposed 
the need for systemic change in police 
accountability, it also cries out for sys-
temic change to address racism embed-
ded in our institutions. The need for 
additional change does not mean we 
have not made progress in our country 
on key issues of civil rights and polit-
ical rights, but it does mean we have a 
very long unfinished road ahead to 
achieve the promise of equal justice, 
equal rights, and equal opportunity in 
America. The murder of George Floyd 
comes in the middle of a pandemic that 
has inflicted disproportionate harm on 
communities of color, especially the 
Black community, because of deep un-
derlying disparities in our society that 
have been well documented. It comes 
amid a pandemic that has shone a 
harsh light on deep inequality in our 
education systems, including the dig-
ital divide and the homework gap, but 
so much more. 
The reality is we must put all of our 
systems under the microscope and very 
intentionally root out racial bias and 
discriminatory impact. In the city of 
Baltimore, in my State of Maryland, 
we have a terrible legacy of housing 
segregation. Baltimore City had an ex-
plicit committee on segregation, which 
was followed by harsh and restrictive 
covenants and redlining that blocked 
our Black community from economic 
mobility. That may seem like a long 
time ago, but the harmful impact of 
those laws is lasting, and you can still 
trace those red lines separating our 
neighborhoods today. 
So let us be very clear here that 
these disparities can be directly traced 
to policies that were designed to dis-
criminate. For decades, Federal, State, 
and local policies covering issues from 
housing to banking amounted to noth-
ing less than state—sponsored efforts 
to deny African-Americans the basic 
equal rights they are owed under our 
Constitution. While many of these poli-
cies are off the books today, their leg-
acy endures and practices endure, and 
it is our obligation at every level of 
government to uproot and destroy 
those embedded policies with the same 
kind of deliberation that they were put 
in place in the first place. 
Now, the protests taking place in 
Minneapolis and all across the country 
are an expression of the deep pain 
caused by the continued death toll and 
other harms caused by our failure as a 
nation to address the underlying in-
equities in our society and in our insti-
tutions. That is why people have taken 
to the streets to protest. It was Dr. 
King who said: There can be no justice 
without peace, and there can be no 
peace without justice. Real justice and 
real peace is long overdue. 
Last night, in response to those pro-
tests, we witnessed something I never 
thought we would see in the United 
States of America. We had the Presi-
dent of the United States call up and 
order military police to fire tear gas 
and rubber bullets at peaceful pro-
testers to clear a path for him to con-
duct a photo op in front of Saint John’s 
Episcopal church, a historic church 
close by to the White House. 
Here is what Mariann Budde, the 
bishop of the Episcopal archdiocese of 
Washington, had to say about what the 
President did. She made a statement 
that outlined the President’s abuse of 
their church for his political purposes, 
and then the church itself issued the 
following statement—I should point 
out that the pastor of the church and 
many of the parishioners were at the 
protest and providing water and nutri-
tion to some of the protesters. 
Here is what the leaders of the 
church said: 
We at St. John’s Church were shocked at 
the surprise visit from the President this 
evening and even more appalled at the vio-
lent clearing of Lafayette Square to make 
the visit possible. St. John’s is a community 
that welcomes all—from powerful presidents 
to the homeless—to worship God. We fully 
espouse the words of our Baptismal Cov-
enant, which says, in part, that we ‘‘will 
strive for justice and peace among all people 
and respect the dignity of every human 
being.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2656 
June 2, 2020 
Living that covenant, we stand with those 
peacefully protesting the tragic and unneces-
sary death of George Floyd, and the far too 
many who came before him. 
We pray that our nation finally confronts 
its history of racism and, as a result, can 
fully embrace the peace of God that passes 
all understanding. 
Those are really words that we 
should have heard from our President. 
Instead, they came from religious lead-
ers responding to the President’s use of 
their church for political purposes— 
and, in the process, violating the First 
Amendment rights of peaceful pro-
testers, the rights of those protesters 
to peacefully assemble, as the Presi-
dent ordered up military police to clear 
a peaceful crowd. 
We also listened in disbelief as Mark 
Esper, the Secretary of Defense, talked 
about turning public places into ‘‘bat-
tle spaces’’ to be dominated. This is the 
Secretary of Defense, who is charged 
with defending our country, talking 
about turning rubber bullets and tear 
gas against peaceful protesters here in 
the United States. 
We witnessed General Milley, Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in full 
military uniform, presiding over the 
breakup of this peaceful demonstra-
tion. 
I remind Secretary Esper and Chair-
man Milley that their oath is to sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States, and they are not per-
mitted by that oath to follow illegal 
orders, even from the President of the 
United States. 
The President of the United States 
can give them what orders he chooses, 
but the Constitution and their oath re-
quires that their first loyalty be to the 
United States of America and not to 
any one individual. 
So I think it is important that we in-
vestigate this incident and the role 
that the Secretary and the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff played in following the Presi-
dent’s illegal orders, illegal because 
they represented a gross violation of 
the First Amendment rights of citizens 
of the United States to peacefully as-
semble. 
Let me close with this. I said at the 
outset that this is a moment when our 
country has different paths to choose 
and this Senate is very much a part of 
deciding which path we will take. Will 
we take the path that Senator BOOKER 
said of not only having moments of si-
lence, but working together to pass 
true reform to address police account-
ability, to address other forms of sys-
temic racism? Will we be willing to 
stand up to the President of the United 
States when he violates the civil rights 
and First Amendment rights of Amer-
ican citizens? 
That is really a test for this institu-
tion, whether we are willing to do our 
job and uphold our oath to the Con-
stitution of the United States. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
I yield the floor. 
ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M. 
TOMORROW 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate stands 
adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow. 
Thereupon, the Senate, at 6:20 p.m., 
adjourned until Wednesday, June 3,
