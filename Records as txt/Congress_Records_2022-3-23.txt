Ukrainian people. 
Lord, we are not worthy to stand in

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
Monday, I explained that the thinness 
of Judge Jackson’s appellate record 
makes this week’s Judiciary Com-
mittee hearings all the more impor-
tant. Well, we are 2 days in. Judge 
Jackson is receiving a calm, respectful 
process, unlike the treatment that 
Senate Democrats typically inflict on 
Republican Presidents’ nominees. 
But, unfortunately, thus far, many of 
Judge Jackson’s responses have been 
evasive and unclear. She has declined 
to address critically important ques-
tions and ameliorate real concerns. 
First and foremost is the simple 
question of Court packing. The far-left 
fringe groups that promoted Judge 
Jackson to this vacancy want Demo-
crats to destroy the Court’s legitimacy 
through partisan Court packing or un-
constitutional term limits. She was lit-
erally the Court packers’ pick for the 
seat, and she has repeatedly refused to 
reject their position. 
Both of the liberal legal giants, Jus-
tice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer, had 
no problem—no problem—defending the 
Court and denouncing Court packing. 
Both Ginsburg and Breyer denounced 
Court packing. As sitting Justices, 
they commented freely on the subject. 
The Justices knew that expressing a

S1718 
March 23, 2022 
clear view and defending their institu-
tion was not—I repeat, not—judicially 
inappropriate in any way. 
But Judge Jackson has refused to fol-
low in the footsteps of Ginsburg and 
Breyer. She refuses to rule out what 
the radical activists want. She told 
Senator KENNEDY that she does have an 
opinion on Court packing, but it is 
‘‘not a strongly held opinion,’’ and, in 
any event, she wouldn’t tell Senators 
what it was. 
But the nominee made sure to quiet-
ly signal openness—openness—for the 
radicals’ position. She told Senators 
she could see both sides of the Court- 
packing debate. Where Justices Gins-
burg and Breyer slammed the door, 
Judge Jackson leaves it open. She even 
told the Committee: 
I would be thrilled to be one of however 
many Congress thought appropriate to put 
on the Court. 
‘‘ . . . thrilled to be one of however 
many Congress thought appropriate to 
put on the Court.’’ ‘‘[H]owever many’’? 
I am not sure Judge Jackson’s secret 
opinion on Court packing is as secret 
as she thinks it is. 
Judge Jackson also displayed a re-
markable lack of candor during basic 
questions about judicial philosophy. 
When asked about judicial philosophy, 
the nominee tried to punt by simply re-
stating the most basic elements of a 
judge’s job description. She said she 
looks at the facts and treats litigants 
fairly. That is not explaining a judicial 
philosophy. That is just rewording the 
judicial oath. It is, basically, a non-
answer. 
These are pivotal questions. They re-
quire clear responses, and previous 
nominees had much less trouble pro-
viding them. A year and a half ago, 
now-Justice Barrett gave the Com-
mittee an intellectual master class in 
her textualist and original judicial phi-
losophy. She described her interpretive 
approach in great detail. She helpfully 
compared and contrasted her philos-
ophy with past and present Justices to 
provide Senators with points of com-
parison. But Judge Jackson either can-
not or will not do any of that. 
Senator SASSE said that in his meet-
ing with the nominee more than 2 
weeks ago, he asked the judge to com-
pare and contrast her own thinking 
with Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and 
Kagan to give Senators a point of ref-
erence. At that time, the judge appar-
ently told the Senator that she needed 
to think about it but would get back to 
him. He followed up yesterday, and 
Judge Jackson said actually she had 
been too busy to give it any thought. 
She could not or would not even sup-
ply a clear summary of just the philos-
ophy of Justice Breyer. Justice Breyer 
is Judge Jackson’s former boss for 
whom she clerked. He has written en-
tire books detailing his judicial ap-
proach, but Judge Jackson either could 
not or would not describe it. 
In one jaw-dropping moment, Judge 
Jackson tried to dodge questions about 
constitutional interpretation by claim-
ing that she does not have enough ex-
perience—does not have enough experi-
ence. 
Here is what she said: 
I would say, just as an aside . . . that while 
I have been on the bench for nine-plus years, 
the issue of constitutional interpretation in 
that sense doesn’t come up very often. It 
comes up to the Supreme Court for sure, but 
it doesn’t come up very often in the lower 
courts. 
In other words, at least in that mo-
ment, a nominee for the U.S. Supreme 
Court tried to tell the Committee that 
her professional experience had not 
prepared her—not prepared her—for an 
in-depth discussion of constitutional 
interpretation. 
The White House and Senate Demo-
crats keep saying Judge Jackson’s dis-
trict court experience is perfect prepa-
ration for the Supreme Court, but it 
sounds like the nominee herself may 
actually disagree with that. 
Let’s be very clear. If Judge Jackson 
truly feels she lacks sufficient experi-
ence with constitutional interpreta-
tion, then the Senate certainly should 
not confirm her. But if she does not ac-
tually feel that way, then she owes the 
Senate much more candor about her 
approach. 
For decades, liberal activists have 
preferred judges who do not limit 
themselves to applying the text of our 
laws and our Constitution, but rather 
make new policy from the bench. 
Sure enough, Judge Jackson spent all 
day yesterday trying to explain what 
amounts to a passionate policy dis-
agreement with existing sentencing 
guidelines for certain horrible crimes. 
In a number of instances, she has given 
out sentences far, far below the sen-
tencing guidelines and far below the 
government prosecutors’ request. In 
cases ranging from child exploitation 
to fentanyl trafficking, she has used 
every possible ounce of discretion to 
essentially remake sentencing policy 
from the bench. 
Under questions from Senator COT-
TON, Judge Jackson said it would be in-
appropriate for her to comment on the 
proper durations of criminal sentences 
as this was a policy matter for legisla-
tors and not judges. But at other times, 
she justified her own past leniency by 
explaining 
that 
judges 
have 
huge 
amounts of discretion and latitude on 
sentencing criminals. Either subjective 
questions about sentencing are fair 
game for the judicial branch or they 
are not. Certainly, the nominee cannot 
have it both ways. 
Today, Judge Jackson will have an-
other chance—another chance to de-
fend the institution of the Court, like 
Justices Ginsburg and Breyer had no 
trouble doing; another chance to give 
Senators a clear explanation of her ju-
dicial 
philosophy, 
like 
Justices 
Gorsuch and Barrett had no trouble 
doing; 
another 
chance 
to 
explain 
whether and how her clear policy views 
on the merits of sentencing criminals 
will continue to impact her judicial 
judgment. 
The Senate and the country will be 
watching. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the vote occur 
immediately following my remarks. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on 
PNTR, as President Biden begins the 
most important foreign trip of his 
Presidency, the best thing the Senate 
can do this week is pass PNTR legisla-
tion to land another devastating blow 
on Putin’s economy. 
Over the past few weeks, Republicans 
have complained that President Biden 
hasn’t acted quickly enough against 
Putin. Yet for the past few days, they 
have stymied swift action on PNTR, 
despite the fact that the House ap-
proved it 424 to 8, with Leader MCCAR-
THY supporting it. 
In particular, the senior Senator 
from Idaho has sought to amend the 
bill to include an oil ban. We are will-
ing to work with Senator CRAPO to ad-
dress his concerns, but there are a few 
reasons we should move quickly with 
PNTR. 
First, President Biden has already 
implemented a ban on Russian oil and 
gas. So passing this legislation is not a 
priority the way PNTR is. Second, 
there remain serious questions about 
whether the proposal from Republicans 
would delay the ban on buying Russian 
oil for a period of time. This is a con-
sequence 
no 
one 
wants. 
Senator 
MANCHIN brought this up when he saw 
the language, and it is something that 
we have to make certain that this pro-
posal isn’t weaker than what the Presi-
dent has put into effect. Third, showing 
unity, particularly at this time when 
the President is meeting with our Eu-
ropean allies, is especially important. 
Finally, the House is not in session. 
Any changes we make to the PNTR 
legislation delays enactment by at 
least a week. 
There is no reason—absolutely no 
reason—to change what the House has 
already approved on PNTR and delay 
action by a week or more. Again, 
Democrats are willing to work with 
Senator CRAPO on this issue if he can 
agree to let this process move forward. 
So let me say it again. PNTR has al-
ready been approved overwhelmingly 
by the House, and it is the most logical 
next step in the fight against Putin’s 
barbaric war, and the Senate should 
thus act. Republicans who complain of

delay are the ones who are delaying. 
The Senate has been most effective 
when working quickly and in unison to 
support the President and our Euro-
pean allies against Vladimir Putin. 
Passing PNTR with overwhelming bi-
partisan support is another chance to 
do just that. 
INSULIN 
Mr. President, on insulin, yesterday I 
held a handful of conversations with 
colleagues from both sides of the aisle 
on one of the most confounding prob-
lems facing millions of Americans—the 
skyrocketing cost of insulin. Making 
insulin more affordable is a top pri-
ority to Democrats, so right now, there 
are bipartisan talks underway by Sen-
ators SHAHEEN and COLLINS to cap insu-
lin at $35 a month and make changes to 
drive the cost down in a comprehensive 
way. 
I intend to put a proposal on the 
floor as soon as we can after Easter. 
There should be nothing remotely par-
tisan about making sure Americans 
don’t go broke to manage their diabe-
tes. So Democrats are eager to work 
wherever we can on legislation that 
will cap insulin at $35 a month and give 
millions a long-overdue break at the 
pharmacy. 
It is reported that at least one in 
four insulin users has to ration their 
use of insulin because they can’t afford 
it. The exponential spike in the cost of 
insulin is truly one of the most frus-
trating trends of the past two decades. 
This is a drug with no patent on which 
millions of Americans rely to manage 
their diabetes. Today, a 40-day supply 
of insulin can exceed $600 a month—a 
prohibitive and downright immoral 
price that makes no sense at all. 
Over the past few weeks, a number of 
my 
colleagues, 
including 
Senator 
WARNOCK, Senator SHAHEEN, Senator 
MURRAY, and Senator COLLINS, have 
worked assiduously on proposals for 
bringing down the price of insulin, 
bringing it back down, as part of our 
larger effort to lower costs for Amer-
ican families. The latest bipartisan ef-
fort will combine elements from Sen-
ator WARNOCK’s and other proposals, 
and it has my enthusiastic backing be-
cause lowering the cost of insulin is so 
important. 
I commend my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle for working on this 
issue in good faith. Bipartisanship has 
been the kindling for a number of re-
cent Senate accomplishments, and in-
sulin should be another issue where we 
deliver. 
In addition, incidentally, while we 
are talking about cost-cutting, we are 
having hearings this week on a number 
of issues relating to high cost. Senator 
CASEY, in the Aging Committee, is 
leading a hearing on home care and the 
high cost there today. Senator CARPER 
is leading a hearing on clean energy 
and national security and the high cost 
of energy. In Agriculture, Senator STA-
BENOW had a hearing yesterday on the 
cost of rural childcare, rural elder care, 
and healthcare. 
H.R. 4521 
Mr. President, on the competition 
bill, today the Senate will take an-
other step to advance major, bipartisan 
legislation to increase American jobs 
and lower costs for American families. 
For over a year, both parties have 
worked on competitiveness legislation 
built around two goals: Create more 
American jobs and lower costs for 
American families. In the case of Sen-
ator YOUNG and myself, the effort has 
stretched back many years. The House 
and 
Senate 
passed 
legislation 
to 
achieve these goals separately, so the 
best way now to send a final product to 
the President’s desk is by entering a 
conference committee with the House. 
We are now working towards that end 
and jumping through a number of pro-
cedural hoops to get that done. 
The majority of us want to see this 
legislation reach the President’s desk. 
We want to see costs go down for fami-
lies, see more manufacturing jobs here 
at home, see greater relief for supply 
chains, and we want to revive Amer-
ica’s unparalleled innovation machine 
that fueled our economy for so much of 
the 20th century. 
The past month reminds us that our 
country is vulnerable when we import 
too many goods from a single coun-
try—particularly, in this case, semi-
conductors. The war in Ukraine is a 
perfect test case. Some of the most im-
portant resources for making chips, 
like neon gas, come precisely from 
Ukraine. 
We need to make more of these prod-
ucts here in America instead of over-
seas so we can lower costs, shore up our 
supply chains, and preserve our na-
tional security. For that reason alone, 
the Senate is moving ahead on this im-
portant competitive legislation. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. President, finally, on SCOTUS, 
the Supreme Court, yesterday Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson offered a 13- 
hour master class of why she deserves 
to be the 116th Justice of the U.S. Su-
preme Court. She was simply impres-
sive. It was clear to anyone watching 
that Judge Jackson’s brilliant legal 
mind was running in high gear. She re-
mained 
measured 
and 
poised 
and 
thoughtful as she worked through yes-
terday’s grueling series of questions. 
Over the course of the day, Judge 
Jackson affirmed that she will ap-
proach her role on the Supreme Court 
with prudence, a respect for precedent, 
and by serving in the same mainstream 
fashion as the great Justice whose seat 
she would fill. 
At times, the judge also displayed 
one of her greatest strengths: her grace 
and poise even during moments when a 
handful of Republicans asked inten-
tionally misleading questions—ques-
tions which even their fellow Repub-
licans found uncomfortable. Repub-
licans tried to land a blow, but Judge 
Jackson kept her cool. By the end of 
the day, it was obvious why the judge’s 
nomination has won the support of ev-
eryone from law enforcement to con-
servative judges, to scores of peers 
throughout her career. I expect she will 
reach final confirmation by the end of 
this work period. 
Now, even as the judge continues her 
testimony today, the Senate will also 
be busy confirming scores of other 
judges to important positions across 
the Federal bench. I am proud to say 
that last night, the Senate confirmed 
its 50th judge under President Biden, 
and by the end of tonight, we could 
reach as many as 58 total judges. But 
doing that is going to take a lot of 
focus and patience, just as we required 
last week. I will once again ask my col-
leagues that in order to move through 
tonight’s votes quickly, we should stay 
in our seats or as close to the Senate 
floor as possible. 
I yield the floor.

Presidency, the best thing the Senate 
can do this week is pass permanent 
normal trade relation legislation so we 
can land another devastating blow on 
Putin’s economy. In a few moments, I 
will ask the Senate for consent to do 
just that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1721 
March 23, 2022 
Last week, the House passed legisla-
tion revoking Russia’s normal trade re-
lations with the United States by 424 to 
8—424 to 8. The vast majority of House 
Republicans backed it, including Lead-
er MCCARTHY and the Republican lead-
ership. 
Here in the Senate, my friend, the 
senior Senator from Idaho, sincerely 
believes that we should amend the bill 
by including an oil ban. I don’t believe 
we should do that. As I said earlier 
today, there are four reasons why we 
should move forward quickly on PNTR 
and then have a separate discussion on 
the oil ban. 
First, President Biden has already 
implemented a ban on Russian oil and 
gas, so passing something the Presi-
dent has already done is not even re-
motely as urgent as passing the PNTR 
first, especially because the President 
is leaving today and meeting with our 
European allies. What could be better 
than a united Senate putting further 
sanctions on Russia as the President 
meets with our European allies, where 
he has done a very good job of bringing 
them together? 
Second, there is still some disagree-
ment, including with the administra-
tion, about how to best draft an oil ban 
proposal. There are some who worry 
that the proposal that my friend from 
Idaho is pushing would actually delay 
the ban on Russian oil compared to the 
President’s proposal. This is a con-
sequence no one wants. 
Third, it is so important we show 
unity right now as President Biden 
meets with our European allies. Swift 
Senate action, combining Democrats 
and Republicans with one voice sup-
porting PNTR, would do just that. 
Finally, the House is not in session. 
Any changes we would make to the 
PNTR 
legislation 
by 
amendment 
delays enactment by at least a week. 
There is no reason—absolutely no rea-
son—to change the PNTR legislation 
the House has already approved and 
delay action. 
Now, again I repeat: I am, Senator 
WYDEN is, and all we Senate Democrats 
are willing to work with Senator 
CRAPO on this issue, if he can agree to 
let the process move forward. 
So let me say again, PNTR has al-
ready been overwhelmingly passed by 
the House. It is a very important and 
logical step in the fight against Putin’s 
barbaric war. We should move the 
House bill ASAP. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 7108 
So, Madam President, I ask unani-
mous consent that at a time to be de-
termined by the majority leader, fol-
lowing consultation with the Repub-
lican leader, the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of H.R. 7108, which is at 
the desk; that there be 4 hours of de-
bate equally divided; and that no 
amendments be in order; that upon the 
use or yielding back of the time, the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
the Senate vote on passage of the bill; 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table without further intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
I rise to address Ukraine’s perilous 
situation. There is broad agreement in 
this Chamber and in the House of Rep-
resentatives that America’s response in 
all areas to Russia and Belarus’s ag-
gression against Ukraine must be com-
prehensive and strong. 
Leveraging the benefits of the U.S. 
trade relationship with Russia is just 
such a response that will add to the 
pressures on Putin to rethink his ac-
tions in Ukraine and punish him for 
what he has already done. 
On March 8, the Democratic and Re-
publican leadership in the Senate Fi-
nance Committee and the House Com-
mittee on Ways and Means reached an 
agreement on precisely that type of re-
sponse. 
The 
bicameral, 
bipartisan 
agreement is called the Suspending 
Normal Trade Relations with Russia 
and Belarus Act, and its provisions in-
clude banning Russian energy imports, 
including various forms of petroleum, 
natural gas, and coal; moving Russia 
and Belarus to the same pariah trade 
status as North Korea and Cuba; pro-
viding the President additional author-
ity to raise tariffs on Russia and 
Belarus even further; calling on WTO 
members to take similar actions to de-
prive Russia of its trade benefits; and 
sending a crystal-clear message to Rus-
sia’s dictator, Vladimir Putin, that he 
will never see these trade benefits re-
stored until he reverses his aggression, 
stops threatening our NATO allies, and 
recognizes the right of the Ukrainian 
people to live freely. 
None of this is controversial, and all 
of it is necessary. 
Yet only a day after the deal was 
made and with neither warning nor ex-
planation, the House split the energy 
ban from the trade status provision 
and bifurcated the two measures fur-
ther by imposing separate standards on 
Putin’s actions in Ukraine before any 
President can think to restore these 
trade benefits to Russia without con-
gressional approval. 
Each bill passed by over 400 votes, 
but the House decided to only transmit 
the bill on Russia’s trade status, its 
permanent normal trade relations, or 
PNTR piece, even though it had passed 
more than a week after the energy ban. 
The important point is that our 
House colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle agree both restrictions need to 
happen. Some may wonder why the ur-
gent need for the congressional energy 
import ban after President Biden pro-
vided one in his Executive order. 
Speaker PELOSI was asked just that 
question when she put the new House 
version of the import ban up for a vote, 
and she stated, correctly, to her House 
colleagues: ‘‘You’re here to legislate.’’ 
Absolutely, that is why we are here. 
And our legislative response—more es-
pecially 
its 
certification 
require-
ments—must deliver an unmistakable 
message to Putin: no relief until you 
stop your aggression and recognize 
Ukraine’s inalienable right to live free 
and choose its leaders. The energy ban 
and its trade status revocation are 
complementary, and they must work 
together. 
While President Biden’s Executive 
order to ban Russian oil was a positive 
step, the Senate and House need to im-
pose tough conditions on Putin’s treat-
ment of Ukraine to be met before any 
President seeks an end to the energy 
import ban. These conditions are like 
those Congress had done in the bipar-
tisan CAATSA legislation, which we 
negotiated when I was the Banking 
Committee chairman during the Trump 
administration. 
Enacting a Russian oil ban will dem-
onstrate to the Ukrainian people and 
our NATO allies that Congress is com-
mitted to cutting off Russia’s funding 
for its war effort. 
Many of our allies, including in Eu-
rope, are debating whether to adopt an 
energy ban against Russia. By the U.S. 
Congress acting definitively and with 
certainty through our congressional 
action, our allies will all be more en-
couraged 
to 
take 
similar 
stands 
against Russian energy exports, which 
account for over a third of Russia’s 
budget. 
I seek to continue our bipartisan tra-
dition by introducing text that is as 
close to the original deal as possible, 
except in two respects, that respond to 
the points made by our majority lead-
er—both made to facilitate our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle. 
First, I am making a single technical 
correction, made at the request of Sen-
ators MANCHIN and MURKOWSKI, to com-
port with the timeline of the Presi-
dent’s Executive order regarding the 
oil ban so that no delay such as was 
mentioned as a possible problem will 
exist. This edit is necessary to avoid 
that delay, and it solves that problem. 
Second, I have revised the certifi-
cation criteria that would allow the 
restoration of trade benefits to match 
exactly what the House passed. The 
original deal provided that benefits 
could not be restored until Russia 
withdrew its forces and stopped posing 
an immediate threat to NATO allies 
and partners. To secure bipartisan sup-
port, I yielded to what the House 
passed: that Russia need only reach an 
agreement with the President to with-
draw its forces rather than have defini-
tively withdrawn them and that Russia 
not pose a threat to NATO members as 
opposed to NATO members and their 
partners. 
Again, this is to match what the 
House has requested. Mind you, I have 
many colleagues on my side who would 
like to do many more things, and I 
agree with their requests. But on the 
trade front, I am willing to make these 
concessions to get this done. 
My view is that we should act quick-
ly. I agree with the majority leader on

this. We must do it together, and we 
must do it today. There is no reason to 
wait for another revenue bill to come 
from the House before we act. So let us 
mark the bravery of the Ukrainian peo-
ple by passing the strongest legislation 
we can, today, in the trade space. 
Accordingly, I am asking the Senator 
to modify his request to take the firm, 
comprehensive action against Vladimir 
Putin that circumstances require. I 
would like to ask that the Senator 
modify his request to make it in order 
for the Crapo substitute amendment, 
which is at the desk, to be considered 
and agreed to and that the Senate vote 
on the passage of the bill as amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object to the re-
quest from the Senator from Idaho, it 
is my understanding that the Senator’s 
modification would not include provi-
sions that were included in the House- 
passed legislation that modifies the 
global Magnitsky sanction regime. 
I just would like to speak for a mo-
ment, if I might. There is no question 
that we stand with the people of 
Ukraine against the unprovoked attack 
by Mr. Putin. We are inspired every 
day by the courage of the Ukrainian 
people and by their inspirational lead-
er, President Zelenskyy. 
The United States has shown leader-
ship, and I congratulate the Biden ad-
ministration. We have led the free 
world in providing defensive lethal 
weapons to Ukraine to defend itself. We 
have provided humanitarian assist-
ance, joining the global community, 
including 
dealing 
with 
3 
million 
Ukrainians that are now refugees in 
other countries and 10 million that 
have been displaced as a result of Mr. 
Putin’s unprovoked attack. 
And we have led on sanctions. We 
have led in getting the global unity to 
impose sanctions against not just the 
Russian sectors, but also against indi-
viduals. And when Mr. Zelenskyy spoke 
before the Members of Congress, he 
specifically mentioned the importance 
of these sanctions; and he asked us to 
expand those covered by the sanctions 
to include the enablers, those that are 
enabling Mr. Putin—the oligarchs—to 
be able to fund his aggression against 
Ukraine. 
So what did the House send over to 
us? In their bill, they sent over a global 
Magnitsky modification. It is identical 
to legislation that was filed by Senator 
PORTMAN and myself that included the 
revocation of PNTR for Russia, along 
with the global Magnitsky. First and 
foremost, it removes the sunset that is 
in the legislation that would sunset 
this year. 
Mr. Zelenskyy asked for us to be re-
solved in being willing to stand up to 
Mr. Putin, that it would take some 
time. A clear message is that we re-
move 
the 
sunset 
on 
the 
global 
Magnitsky statute. And we know how 
difficult it is to get legislation passed 
in this body. 
It also expands the global Magnitsky 
to include the enablers—exactly what 
Mr. Zelenskyy asked us to do—those 
that enabled—the oligarchs that al-
lowed him to be able to finance this. 
The language that is included in here is 
very similar to the language that was 
included in President Trump’s Execu-
tive order. This is critical legislation. 
Now, let me just tell you how appro-
priate it is that it is included in a 
PNTR 
bill—because 
the 
first 
Magnitsky sanction bill—and Senator 
WYDEN was very important in getting 
this done—was included in the original 
PNTR bill for Russia, and we were able 
to get it done at that time. 
We then made it a global Magnitsky, 
and my partner on that was the late 
Senator McCain. It has always been bi-
partisan. My partner now is Senator 
WICKER. The two of us have joined 
forces to make sure we get it done now. 
It is critically important in order to 
impose banking restrictions on those 
that are targeted under the global 
Magnitsky, as well as visa restrictions 
on being able to travel. 
How 
important 
is 
it? 
Ask 
Mr. 
Usmanov, who is one of the principal 
oligarchs to Mr. Putin, who solves Mr. 
Putin’s business problems. Guess how 
he solves those problems? Well, his 
yacht has now been confiscated in Ger-
many. That is how important these 
sanctions are and how we have to move 
them forward. 
So, if I understand my colleague’s re-
quest, it would deny the opportunity 
for us to act on the global Magnitsky, 
which Mr. Zelenskyy has specifically 
asked us to do. We would lose that op-
portunity. We would be sending this 
bill back to the House that is not in 
session, which means there will be a 
further delay in repealing PNTR for 
Russia, which is something we need to 
do now, today. We can get it to the 
President for signature today under 
the majority leader’s request. 
And as the majority leader has indi-
cated, I support the energy ban—I sup-
port the Russian energy ban. President 
Biden has already taken steps to do 
that. And I agree with my colleague 
from Idaho. I would like to incorporate 
that in statute, but there is no urgency 
to do that as there is on repealing 
PNTR and the global Magnitsky. That 
is the urgency. That is what we need to 
get done today. That is what we can 
get to the President this afternoon 
under the majority leader’s request, 
and that will be denied if my friend 
from Idaho’s request were granted. 
So, for all those reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard to the modification. 
Is there an objection to the original 
request? 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object and just 
briefly. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. I would like to say to 
my colleague Senator CARDIN, I believe 
we 
could 
easily 
work 
the 
global 
Magnitsky legislation into whatever 
we do today. I don’t believe there will 
be objections to moving ahead on that. 
It is not included in what I submitted 
because that was not a part of the 
original four-corners agreement which 
I am proposing. I think that could be 
added. 
I also have colleagues on my side of 
the aisle who have other items they 
would like to see discussed because the 
idea we are talking about here is to 
move ahead with no amendments on 
legislation that is major. And I am 
willing to discuss that as well, but I be-
lieve we need time to work this out. 
We can get this done today. And even 
though the House is not in session 
today, our passage of global legislation 
on this entire issue would send a pow-
erful message that the House could af-
firm when it does come back into ses-
sion next week. 
So I will still need to object, but I 
will commit to my colleagues on the 
other side that I will work with you 
today to try to iron out these dif-
ferences. I need to have assurances 
that these other pieces that, for some 
unexplained reason, the House has not 
been willing to put into this package 
can be put into a package that will 
pass. And if we can get to that point, 
we can move today. 
So I commit that I will work with 
you; but at this point, I must object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, I thank my colleague from Idaho. 
I know he sincerely wants to move for-
ward. The best way to send a message 
is pass the House bill, get it to the 
President, and have him be able to sign 
it while the European allies and we are 
meeting. 
But I am disappointed, though, that 
we were unable to take quick action 
now, but I very much appreciate what 
Senator CRAPO has said now. And Sen-
ator CRAPO and I had a good discussion 
this morning. We agree. We want to get 
to a bipartisan resolution to this legis-
lation. 
So Senators WYDEN, CRAPO, and my 
staff are going to work throughout the 
day on language related to the oil ban 
and the other issues that Senator 
CRAPO talked about that we could con-
sider separately. We would then move 
to pass PNTR separately, which we 
hope we can pass today or certainly to-
morrow. 
So I am committed to getting this 
issue resolved and very much appre-
ciate my friend, the Senator from Ida-
ho’s willingness to discuss it so we can 
work out something that both sides 
can accept. 
Mr. CRAPO. I thank Leader SCHU-
MER. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, let 
me pick up on what both of my col-
leagues have just said. Senator SCHU-
MER and Senator CRAPO have both said

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1723 
March 23, 2022 
how committed we are to getting this 
worked out today. And as Senator 
SCHUMER said, under his leadership, the 
Finance Committee—the chair and the 
ranking member—that is what we are 
going to be working on so that this ac-
tually happens. 
And I want to make sure everybody 
understands what that means. It means 
that while the President is in these 
crucial discussions right now in Eu-
rope, the Senate—in the most expe-
dited way, which is to pass the House 
legislation today—would revoke per-
manent normal trade relations with 
Russia. 
And here is why that is so important. 
Vladimir Putin’s inhumane conduct 
means that Russia has forfeited the 
right to the benefits of the inter-
national trade order that was estab-
lished after World War II. And what the 
Senate can do by passing the House bill 
today would amount to the harshest 
economic consequences in a genera-
tion. Let me be specific about that. 
When we pass that legislation that 
came over from the House here in the 
Senate, it would immediately trigger a 
significant increase in tariffs on Rus-
sian-made products. Adding to that, 
the proposal also includes authority for 
the President to raise tariffs even high-
er in the future. These tariffs would di-
rectly level a significant set of restric-
tions on Putin’s circle of oligarchs, 
who export everything from chemicals 
to plywood. This is an absolutely es-
sential step in ensuring that Russia is 
a pariah state. 
So to wrap up, apropos of the com-
ments from the distinguished Senate 
majority leader and our ranking mem-
ber—and the President of the Senate 
has worked with him as well—we had a 
good discussion over the last half-hour 
that is going to focus on getting pas-
sage of the House bill done today. And 
as Senator SCHUMER, Senator CRAPO, 
and I have all noted, those discussions 
have been ongoing, but we are going to 
step it up so we can get this done today 
and send the House bill to the Presi-
dent’s desk by close of business today. 
With that, Madam President, I yield 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
wanted to join in the comments made 
by the distinguished chairman of the 
Finance Committee, which I currently 
sit on, and my distinguished colleague 
on the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, who is the author of the 
Magnitsky Act. 
I just hope—I came loaded for bear to 
the floor because I thought we were 
going to have a different result, but I 
am optimistically going to expect that 
we are going to have a resolution be-
cause, look, there are burnt bodies in 
the streets of Ukraine. There are mass 
graves to bury the dead. There are 
Ukrainians who are melting snow in 
order to drink water to survive. So it is 
truly mind boggling that we cannot get 
this legislation passed that eliminates 
Russia’s preferred trade status and re-
authorizes the Magnitsky Act. 
We see that Putin’s actions are not 
only creating a horrific set of cir-
cumstances in Ukraine; they are cre-
ating a severe shortage of wheat across 
the Middle East and North Africa, 
bombing maternity hospitals and thea-
ters housing children, causing the 
worst refugee crisis in Europe in dec-
ades. 
While we have long called out Putin’s 
thugishness, his unprovoked and dev-
astating attack on Ukraine has united 
the world in its resolve to levy severe 
repercussions for Putin and his cronies. 
So we must revoke this preferential 
trade status immediately. I think we 
should do the same for Belarus, which 
continues to provide a launching pad 
for Putin’s war. 
But, 
certainly, 
not 
including 
Magnitsky makes no sense. Now, it 
makes no sense when last week I came 
to the floor and asked for unanimous 
confirmation of a key number of nomi-
nees at the State Department and 
USAID that are at the heart of helping 
the United States help Ukraine on co-
ordinating sanctions, on our USAID Di-
rector for that part of the world, on the 
Assistant Secretary for refugees—mil-
lions of Ukrainian refugees. We should 
have these people in place to do the 
job. 
But we also have to have the law that 
is going to expire in place that Putin 
hates. He hates it. It is named after 
someone he was trying to eliminate. 
We have to continue to expand our op-
tions for keeping the pressure on 
Putin’s regime and those who enable 
him. Reauthorizing Magnitsky is a 
critical part of doing just that. 
With Magnitsky sanctions, we can 
hold human rights abusers to account. 
We can call out their unacceptable and 
appalling acts, and we can hand the 
President a powerful tool to sanction 
those who profit off the Russian people 
and exploit state assets. 
But if we don’t act, Magnitsky provi-
sions will sunset later this year. Putin 
shouldn’t be able to think: I can wait it 
out. He should know that the law is 
going to continue and the sanctions 
that have been levied under Magnitsky 
will continue to be levied and en-
hanced. 
He wants to see this law go away. His 
oligarchs 
and 
top 
officials 
would 
breathe a sigh of relief. Allowing 
Magnitsky sanctions to expire would 
send exactly the wrong message at the 
most critical time. 
This bill not only extends these 
tools; it sharpens them. This reauthor-
ization would expand sanctions to 
cover 
other 
serious 
human 
rights 
abuses, giving the President the power 
to sanction a broader array of conduct. 
So we have to get this done today. 
We have to revoke normal trade rela-
tions with Russia. We have to send an 
unequivocal message that Putin’s cro-
nies cannot and will not act with impu-
nity. They will pay a price, and we 
must show the world that whether 
human rights abusers are in Moscow or 
Minsk, America stands up for our val-
ues and our principles, and we put 
them into action wherever they are at-
tacked. That is what this effort is all 
about. 
I do hope that before this day is out, 
we will see this passed on the Senate 
floor. There is no excuse not to get it 
done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me 
thank the chairman on the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee for his in-
credible leadership on this issue and so 
many others. 
I want to point out that our com-
mittee has already approved this lan-
guage. This is already approved. This is 
not something that is new to this body. 
We have been debating this for some 
time. It has been the United States and 
the U.S. Senate that have taken the 
leadership to provide tools to go after 
human rights abusers. We were the 
first to act, but, as a result of our ac-
tion, Europe has now acted, the UK has 
acted, and Canada has acted. So we 
have provided global leadership. It is 
one of the strongest tools we have 
against human rights violators, and 
our No. 1 target today is Mr. Putin and 
what he has done. 
So we have a chance to really show 
our leadership—continued leadership— 
in this area. 
I am also encouraged by Senator 
CRAPO’s assurances that we are going 
to try to get this done today. We want 
to get this bill to the President. We 
want to have it clear that we reauthor-
ized it in a way that would be effective 
moving forward. 
On one last point, if I might, no one 
knows exactly what happened in the 
first summit meeting between Presi-
dent Putin and President Trump, but 
the reports were that probably one of 
the very first issues that was raised by 
Mr. Putin was global Magnitsky sanc-
tions, how it is so sensitive to him. 
A clear message against Mr. Putin is 
the passage of the reauthorization and, 
as the chairman said, fine-tuning of the 
global Magnitsky statute. I hope we 
can get that done today. I thank my 
colleagues for their comments. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THUNE. Madam President, Tax 
Day 2022 is fast approaching. Ameri-
cans around the country are prepping 
their tax returns.

don’t think you would find that the 
IRS is their favorite government Agen-
cy and with good reason. The Agency

S1724 
March 23, 2022 
has gained a reputation for poor tax-
payer service. The last tax filing sea-
son was particularly miserable for tax-
payers. ‘‘If you call the IRS, there is 
only a 1-in-50 chance that you’ll reach 
a human being,’’ noted a headline in 
the Washington Post last April. 
The 
national 
Taxpayer 
Advocate 
noted in her 2021 report to Congress: 
Calendar year 2021 was surely the most 
challenging year taxpayers and tax profes-
sionals have ever experienced—long proc-
essing and refund delays, difficulty reaching 
the IRS by phone, correspondence that went 
unprocessed for many months, collection no-
tices issued while taxpayer correspondence 
was awaiting processing, little or no infor-
mation on the Where’s My Refund? tool for 
delayed returns. . . . 
And bad customer service isn’t the 
only thing tarnishing the IRS’s reputa-
tion. The IRS has also gained a reputa-
tion for mishandling the confidential 
taxpayer information it has access to. 
In fact, the IRS was recently subject to 
a massive leak or hack of private tax-
payer information—information that 
somehow ended up in the hands of ad-
vocates at ProPublica, an outfit that 
promotes progressive causes and went 
on to publish taxpayers’ private infor-
mation last June. Months later, nei-
ther the Treasury Department nor the 
IRS has provided meaningful followup 
about the data breach, much less any 
accountability. 
Who could forget the IRS scandal 
during the Obama administration when 
the IRS targeted a number of organiza-
tions based on their political beliefs? 
Nor did the IRS inspire confidence a 
few months ago when it announced it 
would start requiring taxpayers to sub-
mit biometric data in order to access 
certain IRS services. 
Fortunately, after Republicans on 
the Senate Finance Committee and 
others weighed in, the IRS abandoned 
its plans to allow the harvesting of tax-
payers’ biometric data, but it was a 
concerning instance of government 
overreach from an Agency notable for 
repeated mishandling of private tax-
payer information. 
The IRS was a frequent subject of 
discussion in regard to the Democrats’ 
so-called Build Back Better plan. It 
would have been nice if this was be-
cause Democrats had proposed a real 
plan to improve taxpayer services and 
increase Agency accountability. But, 
no, what they proposed in their Build 
Back Better plan was a massive in-
crease in funding for the IRS—$80 bil-
lion—essentially doubling the size of 
the Agency without any plan for ensur-
ing improvements to basic taxpayer 
services. 
I am hard pressed to imagine why 
anyone would contemplate handing a 
massive budget increase to the IRS 
without simultaneously prioritizing a 
plan to substantially increase account-
ability and improve taxpayer services. 
But, of course, Democrats weren’t in-
terested in improving taxpayer serv-
ices. Their main interest in handing 
the IRS a supersized budget increase 
was to increase tax collections to raise 
revenue to help pay for their partisan 
tax-and-spending spree. 
It is the same reason why they in-
cluded a provision, until widespread 
public opposition forced them to re-
move it, that would have allowed the 
IRS to examine the details of Ameri-
cans’ bank accounts. Under one version 
of this provision, the IRS would have 
been able to sift through the bank 
records of any American with just $600 
in annual transactions—$600. In other 
words, the IRS would have been able to 
look through the bank records of just 
about every American and find out just 
how much you spent on Starbucks or 
your last doctor’s bill or that new pair 
of running shoes. 
Republicans are not opposed to en-
hancing resources for the IRS if needed 
to improve taxpayer services, but any 
enhanced resources for the IRS must be 
paired with serious reform, including 
measures to improve customer service, 
ensure that existing resources are 
being used optimally, and promote 
smarter and more effective audits. 
I am a cosponsor of Senator CRAPO’s 
Tax Gap Reform and IRS Enforcement 
Act, which would codify additional pro-
tections for taxpayers against IRS 
overreach. 
Among other things, the legislation 
would help ensure that the IRS is not 
able to target taxpayers for their polit-
ical and ideological beliefs, and it 
would prohibit the kinds of bank re-
porting requirements that Democrats 
sought to impose in their Build Back 
Better spending spree. It would also 
take steps to increase IRS expertise 
and improve the audit process. It would 
improve the information that we have 
on the tax gap, which is the difference 
between taxes owed and taxes paid. 
Reducing the size of the tax gap and 
improving enforcement of our tax laws 
is something we should look at, but 
any effort has to be balanced with tax-
payer responsibilities and taxpayer 
rights. Vastly increasing the size of the 
IRS without any new accountability or 
Agency oversight, as Democrats want-
ed to do with their Build Back Better 
spending spree, would be more likely to 
result in increased harassment of law- 
abiding taxpayers than in a meaningful 
reduction in the tax gap. 
Just in case anyone thinks I am ex-
aggerating about harassment, I would 
like to note that a provision in the 
House version of Democrats’ reckless 
tax-and-spending spree would repeal a 
measure requiring written approval of 
a supervisor before an IRS agent can 
assess any penalties. The provision was 
intended to prevent overreaching IRS 
agents from threatening Americans 
with unjustified penalties. It is hard to 
imagine why Democrats would try to 
repeal this measure if they were not 
trying to pave the way for much more 
aggressive IRS pressure on American 
taxpayers. 
In her 2021 report to Congress, the 
National 
Taxpayer 
Advocate 
noted 
that ‘‘there is no way to sugarcoat the 
year 2021 in tax administration. From 
the perspective of tens of millions of 
taxpayers, it was horrendous.’’ 
Taxpayers deserve better. They de-
serve an efficient and accountable IRS 
and timely and effective customer 
service, and Congress should focus on 
giving it to them. I hope to be able to 
move away from Democrats’ intrusive 
and reckless Build Back Better IRS 
proposals and toward bipartisan efforts 
to reform the IRS and ensure the tax-
payers can reliably depend on the 
Agency. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, since 
Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, 
Vladimir Putin has been shocked by 
two things: He has been shocked by the 
courage and the resilience and skill of 
the Ukrainian army and the resistance 
by the Ukrainian people. 
He has also been shocked by the way 
President Biden has unified the world 
and put together this broad, effective 
coalition. Think about this: Countries 
like Germany and Sweden and Finland, 
even Switzerland, have never been in-
volved in these kinds of international 
operations. They are all on board, all 
working with us on weapons and on hu-
manitarian assistance and on sanc-
tions. 
The President’s team has done an ex-
traordinary 
job 
in 
mustering 
the 
strength of this allied coalition to im-
pose a broad range of powerful, pun-
ishing sanctions. We have cut off huge 
portions of their banking, finance, and 
business sectors from the Western fi-
nancial world. We have shut down ac-
cess to their monetary reserves—what 
Putin considered his war chest. We 
have sanctioned their central bank, 
their large commercial banks, and 
their sovereign wealth funds. 
We have cut off their ability to fi-
nance their debt. We have blocked key 
sanctioned banks from the SWIFT fi-
nancial messaging system. We are 
shutting down their borrowing privi-
leges at international institutions like 
the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund. 
We have gone after Putin personally 
and the oligarchs who prop up his re-
gime. We have gone after their intel-
ligence entities and defense firms and 
others supporting them and supporting 
the war effort. 
We have sanctioned disinformation 
agents, freezing their assets, cutting 
off 
their 
ability 
to 
propagandize 
Putin’s lies. 
Together with our allies, we have 
begun to go after their lucrative en-
ergy sector. We shut down the Nord

Stream 2 gas pipeline. We imposed a 
broad ban on Russian oil and gas and 
coal coming to the United States. We 
have cut off all new American invest-
ments into their oil and gas sector, and 
our big oil and gas firms have with-
drawn in droves. 
We have cut off the sophisticated 
technology Russia’s refining industry 
needs and other technologies that have 
powered their industrial efforts. 
In all this, we make it clear: Russia 
cannot invade its neighbors, cannot 
kill civilians, cannot expect to benefit 
from being part of the international 
economic order. 
And again, this has been the leader-
ship of President Biden and the State 
Department and the Defense Depart-
ment and the Commerce Department 
and others and strong leadership that 
has pulled everybody together. The 
fact that we have put together this co-
alition so quickly, again, with coun-
tries that really haven’t, since World 
War II, participated in anything like 
this—again, Sweden and Finland; Ger-
many for the first time; Switzerland, 
which has been a neutral country since 
way before even you were born, Mr. 
President. So this has been a long time 
that these countries that were neutral 
are coming to the fore and making a 
difference for us. 
Putin’s mistake will set back a gen-
eration or more. It will sever its main 
economic, political, and diplomatic 
ties with the West and countries 
around the world which want to have 
nothing to do with Putin and his re-
gime. 
In Brussels tomorrow, the President 
is set to announce a major new wave of 
powerful sanctions, including against 
hundreds of members of the Russian 
Parliament, the duma, and other elites 
who have enthusiastically supported 
this brutal war. 
He will intensify American efforts, 
along with our allies, to impose further 
sanctions on any defense or intel-
ligence or other Russian firms that 
have in any way supported this inva-
sion, either directly or indirectly. Our 
goal is to reach everybody that has 
been 
part 
of 
Putin’s 
machine, 
of 
Putin’s war crimes. 
Every day, large teams at Treasury 
and the Department of Justice work 
with our allies to find and freeze and 
seize the assets of the oligarchs and 
other Russians who have supported 
Putin’s war machine—their yachts, 
their mansions, their overseas bank ac-
counts. There will be no place to hide. 
All of that is vital. We can always do 
more. 
Russia should not have free and un-
limited access to America’s economy 
or to the global economy. The Presi-
dent has committed already—and one 
of the reasons we are here today—to 
end permanent normal trade relations 
with Russia so that they aren’t perma-
nent. 
We need to do our part to give the 
President the immediate legal author-
ity he needs to work with our allies on 
this to shut off access to favorable tar-
iff treatment for Russia’s goods here 
and around the world. 
We should not delay this another 
day. 
The bill passed the House with a 
nearly unanimous bipartisan vote. We 
need to finalize this in the Senate so 
we can ratchet up the pressure further 
and cut off Russia’s ability to finance 
any of its unprovoked invasion of an-
other member country of the World 
Trade Organization. 
Even before this war, we knew that 
Russia, along with China, cheats on the 
rules of trade. They subsidize their in-
dustries, and they pollute the environ-
ment to gain an unfair advantage in 
the global market. My State, Ohio, 
knows all too well about being forced 
to compete with countries that cheat. 
If we don’t remove this now, Russia 
will continue to use its status to posi-
tion their industries in the global mar-
ket, hurting American companies in 
the process. 
It is not a partisan issue. I intro-
duced a bicameral, bipartisan bill with 
Senator CASSIDY of Louisiana to re-
move Russia’s permanent normal trade 
relation status. We did that almost a 
month ago. There is bipartisan support 
to do this quickly. 
I have worked with my colleague 
Senator CRAPO from Idaho on many 
Russian 
sanction 
efforts 
over 
the 
years. I know we share the same goals. 
I am hopeful there is a path forward 
in getting this done today. He is argu-
ing that an oil ban should be included 
in this, even though the President al-
ready issued an Executive order on this 
that is already in effect. 
I hope we can work out our dif-
ferences quickly so we can send a clear, 
strong, unified message to Russia and 
to the world: Countries that invade an-
other sovereign nation will not ever 
have free and unrestricted access to 
our economy. They will not be able to 
finance that invasion by continuing to 
cheat the rules on trade. 
It is time to come together to end 
permanent normal trade relations with 
Russia. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GAS PRICES 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if 
you know anything about Michigan, 
you know we love our cars. We put the 
world on wheels, and we have been 
keeping Michigan moving ever since. 
But recently this love affair has hit a 
rough patch. 
Nearly everyone in Michigan drives— 
to work, to school, and to the lake on 
the weekends, and it is getting warmer 
and warmer to be able to do that. And 
high gas prices have made this Michi-
gan way of life a lot more expensive. 
I am thinking of the driver who uses 
his own car to deliver meals and other 
essentials to families in Detroit. Gas 
prices have gone up so much, he is 
barely breaking even. I am thinking of 
the student who drives 40 minutes 
every day to attend classes at Michi-
gan Tech in Houghton. She is training 
for a great career, but the price at the 
pump is cutting into the money she 
needs to pay her tuition and her rent. 
And I am thinking about farmers. Fuel 
is absolutely essential to power our 
tractors and produce fertilizer and 
keep the world fed. 
But income is tight even in the good 
times, and in the tight times, the folks 
who grow our food can struggle to fill 
their own refrigerators. 
High fuel prices hurt Michigan fami-
lies, our businesses, and our economy. 
And that is why it is so frustrating 
when oil and gas companies make 
choices that keep prices high to boost 
their own bottom lines. 
It is true that part of the reason gas 
prices are so high is because demand is 
so high. Thanks to President Biden and 
Democrats in Congress, our economy 
came roaring back from COVID–19. 
Now, with all the challenges of the sup-
ply chains and the cost issues we are 
dealing with—but the foundation of our 
economy is strong, and that is a good 
thing. 
But a roaring economy requires en-
ergy, and production isn’t keeping 
pace. It is not that we don’t have 
enough oil. In fact, the United States is 
the world’s largest oil-producing coun-
try. And we could be producing more. 
There are currently 9,000 approved oil 
leases that the oil companies aren’t 
even using. Yet the oil companies have 
made a conscious decision to hold back 
production, to raise prices, and pad the 
pockets of their shareholders. One CEO 
even admitted as much last month 
when he said that his company is ‘‘cap-
turing value from higher prices for 
gas.’’ 
Let me translate that. ‘‘Capturing 
value from high prices for gas’’ really 
means taking money out of your pock-
et and my pocket and putting it into 
the pockets of their shareholders. 
It is working for them. His com-
pany’s revenue nearly tripled during 
the fourth quarter, and they are not 
alone. In fact, the 25 largest oil and gas 
companies raked in $205 billion in prof-
its last year—$205 billion in profits last 
year—while price-gouging now at the 
pump. 
And they used that money to buy 
back $40 billion of their own stock and 
pay their shareholders and top execu-
tives $50 billion in dividends. And they 
are not particularly eager to pass on 
any savings to anybody else, unfortu-
nately. 
It is interesting. The last time a bar-
rel of oil was $96, gas was $3.62 a gallon. 
Last week, a barrel of oil was again $96, 
but this time gas was $4.31 a gallon. 
What is the difference? 
Well, the truth is, they set the price 
based on what they can get away with,

March 23, 2022 
arguing a global economy and supply 
and so on, a supply which they deter-
mine, and they set the price with what 
they think they can get. And that is 
called price-gouging right now; taking 
advantage of situations around the 
world, our willingness to sacrifice to be 
part of supporting the Ukrainians and 
what is happening. 
And instead of doing their part to 
maybe say: OK, $205 billion in profits 
last year, pretty good. OK. Maybe we 
can, like, do our part here—instead, 
the prices at the pump go up and up 
and up, and it has got to stop. 
A single mom of three in Michigan is 
standing at a gas pump right now with 
a knot in her stomach, watching her 
bill go up and up and her monthly 
budget for everything else go down. 
So that is the problem. What is the 
solution? 
First of all, the Senate Commerce 
Committee is calling for the CEOs of 
the major oil companies to testify be-
fore the committee, and I am really 
looking forward to that hearing and 
what they have to say for themselves 
on why. I want to thank the chair-
woman, Chairwoman CANTWELL, and 
the committee for their leadership. 
Secondly, I introduced the Gas Prices 
Relief Act with a number of my Demo-
cratic colleagues. This gas tax holiday 
is immediate relief—yes, short term, 
but it would save Michigan drivers 
nearly $650 million at the pump this 
year. 
I also think it is about time to stop 
subsidizing these oil companies that 
are doing just fine on their own. They 
don’t need our tax dollars to subsidize 
them anymore. For more than 100 
years, Congress has given major, per-
manent tax benefits to the fossil fuel 
industry. This decade, they have re-
ceived $35 billion in fossil fuel-related 
tax breaks. Do the American people 
really need to keep subsidizing an in-
dustry whose pollution is responsible 
for creating the global climate crisis, 
all the while enjoying record profits 
and picking people’s pockets? The an-
swer is no. Yet our Republican col-
leagues stand with the oil companies 
over and over again. 
I just came from an Environmental 
and Public Works Committee meeting 
on this very topic and heard over and 
over again the rationale for letting the 
oil and gas companies keep doing what 
they are already doing with no ac-
countability and no real effort for us to 
move in the direction of clean energy 
where we need to move. 
Most importantly, it is time to shift 
to new clean sources of energy. For 
more than 100 years, scientists have 
known that burning fossil fuels creates 
carbon pollution that builds up in our 
atmosphere, and that traps heat. It 
just stays there. For more than 100 
years, we just kept on burning fossil 
fuels anyway. And the industry has 
spent billions trying to convince us it 
is not really happening. We really 
aren’t seeing the climate change. No, 
this isn’t happening. Don’t look up. 
Well, it is time for a change. We can 
start by using more homegrown and 
cleaner burning biofuels to save con-
sumers money. It is time to allow the 
year-round sale of E15—a change I have 
encouraged 
the 
administration 
to 
make. According to the Renewable 
Fuels Association, E15 is 10 to 15 cents 
per gallon less than standard gasoline 
and cleaner. 
There is no time like the present to 
accelerate our shift to clean energy 
production, which I know the Presiding 
Officer cares deeply about and has been 
a leader in, and the use of electric vehi-
cles. We know that part of that is mov-
ing to clean energy electricity—power 
as well as electric transportation. Both 
are very, very important. 
Buying an amazing Michigan-made 
EV means you can drive right on by 
the gas station. You don’t even have to 
stop. That is what I am looking for-
ward to. You don’t even have to pay at-
tention to what is on the sign—won’t 
matter. 
The exciting thing is, we can take ac-
tion to make this happen more quickly 
by ensuring that electric vehicles are 
affordable for more families and, criti-
cally, that they are built right here in 
America—not in China, not somewhere 
else around the world, in America—and 
I am laser-focused on making that hap-
pen. 
The good news is, we will tackle the 
climate crisis at the same time because 
the transportation sector is the single 
largest source of carbon pollution. 
Shockingly, a few weeks ago, a fossil 
fuel executive said this about his in-
dustry: 
You’ve made a promise to be more dis-
ciplined about getting cash back to share-
holders with these dividends. The question 
is, are you going to keep your promise? Or 
are you going to be patriotic? 
Hmm. It is pretty clear whose side 
the oil companies are on, and it isn’t 
the side of the American people. It is 
time for them to stop price-gouging 
and try a little patriotism. 
I yield the floor.

I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of Judge Ketanji 
Brown 
Jackson, 
President 
Biden’s 
nominee to be an Associate Justice of 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Judge Jackson brings an exceptional 
level of experience to the bench. After 
serving for nearly 8 years on the U.S. 
District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia, Jackson has more trial court 
experience than any sitting Supreme 
Court Justice and more than almost 
any Justice in a century. She will also 
be only the second sitting Justice to 
have served on all three levels of the 
Federal judiciary. 
Judge Jackson’s nomination is his-
toric. If confirmed, she will be the first 
Black woman to sit on the Supreme 
Court, bringing a long overdue rep-
resentation to the Bench. After serving 
as an assistant Federal public defender 
in Washington, DC, Judge Jackson will 
also be the first former Federal public 
defender to serve on our Nation’s high-
est Court. 
It matters that someone nominated 
to sit on our Nation’s highest Court 
has represented people other than cor-
porate clients. It matters that someone 
nominated has had real experience 
with people who can’t afford lawyers. 
It matters that someone nominated 
has had real experience in fighting for 
the public interest. 
The Sixth Amendment of our Con-
stitution grants criminal defendants 
the right to have the assistance of 
counsel in their defenses, but it wasn’t 
until 1963, in Gideon v. Wainwright, 
that the Supreme Court unanimously 
ruled that the Constitution required 
State courts to appoint lawyers for de-
fendants who could not otherwise af-
ford one. 
Now, some Republicans have com-
plained about the very idea of having a 
public defender on the Supreme Court, 
but their objections run squarely afoul 
of the meaning of the Constitution. 
This fundamental constitutional right 
to counsel is safeguarded by the work 
public defenders do every single day. 
Public defenders are literally on the 
frontlines of helping America live up to 
our constitutional ideals. Every Amer-
ican who supports and defends the Con-
stitution should welcome a Supreme 
Court Justice who has worked so hard 
to turn our constitutional ideals into 
reality. 
When asked about her work as a pub-
lic defender, Judge Jackson said: 
Every person who is accused of criminal 
conduct by the government, regardless of 
wealth and despite the nature of the accusa-
tions, is entitled to the assistance of counsel. 
Judge 
Jackson 
restates 
a 
foundational constitutional point, one 
that she has lived—up close and per-
sonal. 
Public defenders understand better 
than anyone that none of us should be 
defined by the worst thing we have 
ever done. Everyone, regardless of who 
they are or what they have been ac-
cused of, deserves a lawyer. Our legal 
system, as imperfect as it may be, 
strives to deliver equal justice under 
law. It is only because of the commit-
ment of public defenders, civil rights 
attorneys, and legal aid lawyers that 
we can aspire to achieving that ideal. 
That is why we need Judge Jackson’s 
expertise on the Supreme Court, and 
that is why, for a long time now, I have 
called for prioritizing professional di-
versity on our Federal bench. 
For far too long, our Federal judici-
ary has been dominated by those who 
only have experience representing the 
wealthy and well connected, but what 
about those who don’t have money or 
influence? We need more judges with 
experience in representing the voice-
less and the disadvantaged. The make-
up of our Federal and State courts has 
never fully reflected the American peo-
ple. Over time, this lack of representa-
tion has formed cracks in the founda-
tion of our legal system—cracks that 
weaken public trust and threaten the 
legitimacy of our institutions. 
A diverse judiciary matters. Judges— 
all judges—draw on their past personal 
and professional experiences when ana-
lyzing the law and reviewing the facts 
of individual cases. Judges who have 
experience as public defenders, civil 
rights attorneys, and legal aid lawyers 
are well equipped to understand the 
circumstances 
that 
bring 
everyday 
Americans into courtrooms. It is that 
background that strengthens public 
trust and that reinforces the legit-
imacy of our judicial system. 
Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan 
said it best: 
If the court doesn’t have legitimacy with 
the American public, it can’t do all that 
much. All kinds of different people should be 
able to look at the court and say, ‘‘I see 
somebody there who looks like me, who 
thinks the way I do, who has experiences of 
the kind that I had.’’ And that’s the kind of 
thing that gives the court public legitimacy. 
Justice Kagan is right. Our judiciary 
will, undoubtedly, be made stronger be-
cause of Judge Jackson’s confirmation 
to the Supreme Court. 
It is not only her work as a public de-
fender that informs Judge Jackson’s 
experience. Prior to joining the bench, 
Judge Jackson served first as an assist-
ant special counsel and, later, as the 
Vice Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Com-
mission. These experiences give her 
deep insight into the sentencing guide-
lines and enhance her ability to think 
critically about our criminal legal sys-
tem’s impact on ordinary people. 
Judge Jackson’s first stint on the 
Commission inspired her to become an 
assistant Federal public defender in 
order to gain practical, firsthand in-
sight into our criminal legal system. 
Her work in the trenches, representing 
those without means or power, pro-
vided Judge Jackson with an invalu-
able perspective into our system of jus-
tice, and it gave her the opportunity to 
effectuate the fundamental right to 
counsel, which is outlined in our Con-
stitution. 
I look forward to supporting her con-
firmation, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I re-
turned to the United States Sunday 
night after leading a bipartisan Senate 
delegation visit to Poland and Ger-
many. Ten Senators—Republicans and 
Democrats—traveled together to dem-
onstrate America’s unwavering support 
for 
the 
freedom-loving 
people 
of 
Ukraine and affirm the strength of the 
world’s most powerful alliance. 
I will never forget an engagement 
with Ukrainian civil society leaders. 
This 
group 
of 
passionate, 
strong 
women demonstrated Ukraine’s spirit 
and their will to fight. They delivered 
a very clear message to the United 
States. They said that Ukraine can 
win, but they need more lethal aid de-
livered now. 
Our bipartisan delegation departed 
with the conviction that the United 
States, Ukraine, and the free world 
have the will and the means to stop 
Vladimir Putin’s tyranny. I am here on 
the Senate floor today to state my be-
lief that Ukraine will beat back Vladi-
mir Putin’s bloody invasion. They will 
throw the Russian army out of their 
country, and they will declare victory 
over this lawless criminal incursion. 
Folks, Ukraine can win this war. 
When the shooting is over, the Russian 
military will be broken, and the Rus-
sian 
economy 
will 
collapse—con-
sequences brought about by Putin’s 
chosen isolation and rejection of the 
free world. He and his cronies, their fu-
tures are not bright either. Putin’s 
propaganda media machine will break 
down. He will be marked by the inter-
national community as a war criminal 
and, I predict, will be held accountable 
by his own people. His best days are be-
hind him. Freedom will win. 
Most of us thought these outcomes 
were improbable just a few weeks ago. 
The 
President’s 
policymakers 
cir-
culated intelligence assessments in the 
first days of the invasion which con-
cluded 
unequivocally 
that 
Ukraine 
didn’t stand a chance. They predicted 
Putin would topple Kyiv within 3 to 5 
days. Tomorrow marks 1 month since 
the start of the war. The Russian mili-
tary is disorganized and demoralized.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1728 
March 23, 2022 
Four separate divisions are all com-
peting for logistics resupply. 
Putin knows he is losing, and he is 
panicking. He jailed his deputy chief of 
intelligence, and his military is burn-
ing the bodies of their Russian casual-
ties. Russia’s manpower and ammuni-
tion are tapping out while, on the 
other side, Ukraine’s forces are hang-
ing tough. 
The weapons the United States and 
our allies and partners provided are 
being deployed with lethal proficiency. 
The frontlines have been frozen for 
over a week, and Russian casualties are 
greater than 1,000 a day. 
Ukrainians are intercepting unclassi-
fied calls and eliminating Russian field 
commanders. 
Most 
crucially, 
the 
Ukrainian people are ready to fight to 
the last man. The Russian army is a 
force of teenaged conscripts, subjects 
of an authoritarian war criminal whose 
delusions of grandeur about the old So-
viet Union drove this invasion. The 
Ukrainian army is made up of free citi-
zens who chose freedom over Russian 
tyranny. 
Putin’s 
invasion 
doesn’t 
change Ukraine’s choice, and they will 
not go quietly. 
Given all of this, has the United 
States shifted its strategy? Do we be-
lieve we can help make a Ukrainian 
victory a near certainty? We all know 
why we must come to Ukraine’s aid. 
This body’s memory is not that short. 
The United States is an agreement- 
bound partner with Ukraine. We en-
tered into an agreement. We are their 
partners. 
In 1994, Ukraine dismantled and sur-
rendered its nuclear armament entirely 
in exchange for our security guar-
antee—the protection of the world’s 
greatest superpower. Our agreement re-
sulted in a prosperous Ukraine and 
made the world a much, much safer 
place. 
Before Vladimir Putin attempted to 
snuff it out for good 3 weeks ago, the 
American people and the world bene-
fited from the breadbasket of Europe’s 
vital agricultural sector and energy 
production. Ukraine has been an in-
valuable economic and security partner 
for nearly 30 years. 
Putin is not only testing that agree-
ment today in the streets of Kyiv, 
Mariupol, and Kharkiv, he wants to 
break freedom’s momentum all around 
the globe. Folks, we can’t allow that to 
happen. We must not. 
If it has not been made clear enough 
already, an unshakeable commitment 
to allies and partners keeps Americans 
prosperous and our families safe. Au-
thoritarians—whether 
it 
is 
the 
Taliban, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, 
the terrorists who rule Iran—they can-
not dictate terms to our security and 
our economy. We still are the world’s 
superpower 28 years after we made a se-
curity agreement with Ukraine. Amer-
ica cannot be pushed around. 
We also know how we can come to 
Ukraine’s aid. Congress just passed $14 
billion of support for Ukraine, which 
included nearly $2 billion of lethal 
weaponry. That aid—those weapons 
and that logistical support—must flow 
right now. I fought for a provision in 
the aid package that allows the Presi-
dent to draw down on pre-positioned 
military equipment, and I will be en-
suring he follows through and gets 
these weapons into Ukrainian hands. 
There is no excuse for American inac-
tion. 
The Commander in Chief now has the 
authority to transfer pre-positioned 
weapons and logistical support, includ-
ing as many as 40 Soviet-style heli-
copters purchased for Afghan security 
forces, to the Ukrainians. America’s 
commitment to Ukraine and our NATO 
allies demands we expedite the delivery 
of weapons and capabilities to Ukraine. 
Any delay due to the fears of esca-
lation is reflective of a doctrine of ap-
peasement that will only further em-
bolden our adversaries. 
Pentagon 
Press 
Secretary 
John 
Kirby said recently that success for the 
U.S. mission in Ukraine is, at the end 
of the conflict, a free and independent, 
sovereign Ukraine. 
Folks, I wholeheartedly agree with 
this sentiment, but if that is our mis-
sion, America has to provide more sup-
port to enable Ukraine to win this war. 
We cannot hold back. The U.S. mission 
in Ukraine must go beyond ensuring 
the country merely has the means to 
defeat itself—defend itself against Rus-
sian aggression, defeat the Russians. 
Now is not the time to be risk-averse. 
This administration did little to 
deter Putin’s march on Kyiv, an inva-
sion set in motion as early as April 
2021. President Biden lifted sanctions 
on Nord Stream 2, framed the United 
States-Russia relationship as stable 
and predictable as late as June of last 
year, and canceled European Command 
military exercises calling them ‘‘too 
provocative.’’ 
Public opinion, Congress, and even 
European 
nations 
have 
hammered, 
begged, dragged, and pushed the Biden 
administration to action. From eco-
nomic sanctions to the Russian oil ban, 
the administration has led from behind 
and from a position of weakness. 
Take the Polish MiG debacle; three 
Sundays ago, Secretary Blinken gave 
Poland a green light to transfer MiG 
fighter jets to Ukraine. The following 
Tuesday, the White House did a flip 
and rejected the transfer of planes out 
of fear Putin would see the move as 
escalatory. 
Forty-one 
Republicans 
joined my letter voicing displeasure to 
the President for his failure to act. 
Letting an adversary define your mili-
tary’s rules of engagement, letting the 
aggressor dictate the boundaries of our 
response is not just a folly, it is suici-
dal. 
The administration crossed their fin-
gers and hoped Putin would play nice. 
Well, folks, we know Putin. He didn’t 
play nice, and deterrence failed. But 
the failure of this administration’s doc-
trine of appeasement doesn’t mean 
Ukraine will lose the war. 
I commend actions taken to shore up 
the NATO alliance following the inva-
sion, but our Commander in Chief must 
now lead and give Ukraine the means 
to win. If he is to continue being the 
most powerful man in the free world, 
he must act as such. 
Delaying the loss of Ukraine to 
Vladimir Putin is not a strategy. Suc-
cess is not a Russian-occupied Ukraine. 
Success is not a protracted insurgency. 
Success is a free, independent, and sov-
ereign Ukraine. Defending freedom in 
Ukraine is defending freedom every-
where. Authoritarianism cannot pre-
vail in this conflict. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from West Vir-
ginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
would like to thank my fellow Senator, 
Senator ERNST from Iowa, for leading 
the delegation trip that we took this 
past weekend, the bipartisan delega-
tion. 
It 
was 
most 
informative, 
impactful, and she did a wonderful job 
leading that. I was proud of the efforts. 
I am here to join my colleagues 
today to discuss the invasion—the un-
just and immoral invasion of Ukraine 
by Vladimir Putin—in light of the trip 
that we just took to Germany and to 
Poland. In a way, I am kind of hesitant 
to do so, not because there isn’t a lot 
to say or a lot to share but because of 
the powerful words that some of the 
Ukrainians whom we met implored us, 
which was: Enough talking. It is time 
to act. 
I could not agree more. But out of 
deep respect for them, I would like to 
take a moment to make sure we all un-
derstand why we have to act and why 
we must act now. 
As Americans, you realize this when 
you talk to—we did, certainly, when we 
were talking with Germans and other 
Europeans. We don’t have the same 
perspective sometimes that Europeans 
have who faced World War II. One of 
the most powerful comments conveyed 
when we were meeting with German of-
ficials was that their new generation 
who has heard for decades about the 
atrocities from their parents and their 
grandparents—they 
were 
told 
this 
would never happen again. And yet 
what we see is that it is happening 
again. 
This is an unjust war, and there 
seems to be no level of atrocity that 
Vladimir Putin is unwilling to commit. 
Putin overestimated his ability, his 
army, his ability to conquer. ‘‘This 
must be over in 3 days,’’ according to 
him. He overestimated his own abili-
ties, and he grossly underestimated the 
will of the Ukrainian people and the 
will to not just live but to live freely. 
On top of this, Putin has also failed 
to understand the commitment of the 
free world—of NATO—to stand up for 
freedom. We certainly saw that over 
the last several days. 
We, in our Nation and in our history, 
know that freedom is worth fighting 
for, and it is also worth defending. Gen-
erations have done this in our past and 
will do this in the future. We believe 
this to our core.

March 23, 2022 
We also believe that the deliberate 
and evil bombing of hospitals, tar-
geting supply routes, and killing civil-
ians are the actions of war criminals. 
But in the face of all of this evil, we 
see hope. We see hope from the Ukrain-
ian people; we see hope from the 
Ukrainian leadership; we see hope from 
the Ukrainian military; and we see 
hope in our own military forces as a 
part of NATO, including all nations of 
NATO as well as the generosity of peo-
ple around the world, the nongovern-
mental organizations we saw helping at 
the refugee center, and, most espe-
cially, the Polish people. We saw them 
stepping in militarily. And on the hu-
manitarian side, we saw an incredible 
outpouring. We saw this firsthand at 
the refugee center. 
Poland has now taken in over 2 mil-
lion people into their country, which is 
more than the entire population of my 
State. During our trip, as I said, we 
visited 
the 
refugee 
center 
where 
Ukrainians are going first to be proc-
essed as they are leaving and having to 
flee their country. After this, they end 
up not at another refugee center but 
most likely in somebody’s home or a 
friend’s. That is the level of care and 
support that they are receiving. And 
that is the level of care and support 
that they deserve as a tribute of their 
willingness to fight and defend their 
freedom. Many of these women and 
children—mostly women and children— 
are leaving their husbands and their 
homes behind. 
Ukraine is united. As we were told, 
Ukraine will fight to the last man. May 
it never come to the last man because 
the free world must help. Make no mis-
take, the United States of America has 
chosen a side. We side with freedom. 
We side with the people of Ukraine. 
Just a few weeks ago, Congress 
passed 
$14 
billion 
in 
support 
for 
Ukraine and Central European allies 
amid Putin’s unprovoked war. It is 
critical to get these funds and equip-
ment to them now because time is of 
the essence. 
As an example, Congress took an 
extra week to pass this package. When 
you are there on the ground talking to 
the leadership who are trying to push 
back on Putin, a week is a lifetime—a 
week is a lifetime. So we cannot afford 
to hesitate or to cause inaction. 
In our efforts to get them funds—le-
thal aid—and to oppose sanctions on 
Russia, we must act now and keep act-
ing. 
Madam President, as you know—you 
were on the trip, as well—we met with 
diplomats and generals, representa-
tives from many of our executive 
branch Agencies, NGOs, brave soldiers, 
including many from our home States. 
But I will never forget the words of a 
woman we met named Katarina, whom 
we met at the refugee processing cen-
ter. She said, in desperate tones, she 
didn’t want to leave Ukraine. She 
didn’t want to leave her home. She 
wants to live in freedom and peace, but 
she has a 6-year-old and 8-year-old who 
are constantly hearing the sirens of 
bomb alerts, the sounds of bombing— 
just the violence. She had no choice. 
She had to leave to protect her chil-
dren. 
Let’s do what we can, as much as we 
can, and as fast as we can—and that 
last part is critical—to return freedom 
to Ukraine and justice to those who do 
not respect the sovereignty of nations. 
This is really what we owe every child 
in Ukraine, in Germany, in Poland, and 
in the United States. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, on 
February 24, approximately 1 month 
ago, 
Vladimir 
Putin 
launched 
an 
unprovoked 
and 
unjustified 
war 
against his neighbor, the free, demo-
cratic, 
and 
sovereign 
nation 
of 
Ukraine. 
The bipartisan Senate delegation 
visit to Europe led by Senator ERNST 
that I joined over this past weekend 
was truly extraordinary. It has rein-
forced my already strong belief that 
the United States must do all that it 
can to provide lethal aid to the coura-
geous Ukrainians fighting for their 
families and their freedom, as well as 
to provide the humanitarian assistance 
necessary to ease the suffering of the 
Ukrainian people. 
The Presiding Officer was on this 
trip, as well. 
Like the Senator from West Virginia, 
who just spoke, my most memorable 
conversation was with a young mother 
named Katarina, who had two children, 
one age 8 and one age 6, with her. I met 
her at the Polish refugee welcome cen-
ter. It was only a few miles from the 
Ukrainian border. 
She said to me: 
I want to live in peace. I want to be back 
in Ukraine, but I have to keep my children 
safe. 
She was weary-looking but deter-
mined to keep her children safe. This 
young mother and her two children 
were leaving the only country she had 
ever known. She left her husband be-
hind, not knowing when or if she would 
see him again—all in order to keep her 
children safe. 
We have only to watch the scenes of 
what Putin is doing to try to destroy 
Ukraine and to break the will of its 
people. He has bombed apartment 
buildings, schools, theaters, shelters, 
humanitarian corridors. He has bombed 
a maternity hospital. What does that 
tell you about this man, this war 
criminal? What more do we need to 
know? 
The only way that we can end this 
humanitarian 
crisis 
is 
to 
provide 
Ukraine with the weapons, supplies, 
ammunition, and other assistance that 
they need to bring to an end this Rus-
sian war of aggression. We must pro-
vide, 
without 
further 
delay, 
the 
Ukrainians with the MiG fighter air-
craft that have been held up by this ad-
ministration 
and 
which 
Ukrainian 
President Zelenskyy has requested. We 
must ensure that Ukraine receives ad-
ditional anti-aircraft defenses, includ-
ing the S–300, whether directly from 
our stocks or those of our allies. 
We must ensure that the Ukrainians 
have the means to fight and defend 
their people from these ongoing atroc-
ities ordered by Putin. And we know 
of—we saw firsthand—their extraor-
dinary bravery, their determination to 
fight for their country, to put every-
thing they have on the line. 
Every moment, every hour, every day 
counts. We do not have time for endless 
debate and delay that costs the lives of 
innocent Ukrainians. As the Ukrainian 
leader told us, the administration must 
stop telling Putin what America will 
not do. It must say what we will do. 
The administration should also make 
every effort in collaboration with Con-
gress, when necessary, to ease the proc-
ess of allowing Ukrainians with family 
members here in America to come stay 
with them until it is safe to return 
home. I know many Mainers are eager 
to help. 
Finally, I want to acknowledge the 
terrific American soldiers that we met, 
including several from the great State 
of Maine. Many of them left their fami-
lies with days’ or even hours’ notice 
over the past few weeks. They rapidly 
deployed to Germany, Poland, and 
other NATO allies to deter Russia’s ag-
gression and defend these NATO mem-
bers from any Russian threats. Each of 
these members of our military were 
motivated, patriotic, and impressive, 
and I am so grateful for their service. 
I have read that President Biden is 
considering stationing our troops close 
to the frontline to send an unmistak-
able message to the Russians on a more 
permanent basis, and I hope that he 
will indeed do that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, it is 
a privilege to be here on the Senate 
floor speaking to Kansans and to 
Americans, to Vladimir Putin and to 
Ukrainians, and to the rest of the 
world, our allies, our friends, and our 
adversaries. It is a privilege to be here 
with the opportunity of speaking with 
one voice. 
As we know, that does not happen 
frequently enough in the U.S. Senate, 
but the Presiding Officer was on this 
trip with us to Eastern Europe and to 
the Ukrainian border, and my col-
leagues here on the Senate floor—Re-
publicans, Democrats, and Independ-
ents; Members of the U.S. Senate, to-
gether—saw what we saw and resolved 
what we resolved together. 
I am so pleased that that is the case. 
Particularly our adversaries, but clear-
ly our allies, as well, must know that 
this is not a Democratic or Republican 
issue. It is an American issue. It is a 
world issue. It is something about free-
dom that transcends any of the dif-
ferences that we have here in the 
United States or in the U.S. Senate. 
And every day matters. While it is 
important for us to bring our report

S1730 
March 23, 2022 
home to our colleagues and to our con-
stituents about what we saw, what we 
heard, and what, most importantly, we 
felt, it is important that we act. 
Remember the Ukrainian citizens 
who told us: It is OK to proclamate. It 
is OK to have a statement. It is OK to 
pass a resolution. But what we need is 
action. 
Every day matters in the fight 
against Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked, 
unjust, 
and 
immoral 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine. 
To any of the people who say Ukraine 
is at fault here, I cast all doubt about 
that. That is not the case. What is hap-
pening in Ukraine, what is happening 
in Eastern Europe, and what may hap-
pen beyond the borders of Ukraine is 
the result of an evil man named Vladi-
mir Putin. 
The United States—this administra-
tion—must stop telling Putin what we 
won’t do. Don’t ever tell our adver-
saries: We are not going to do this. 
It makes absolutely no sense. 
But we do need to do what we said we 
will do and even more. 
Our slow bureaucratic march to pro-
vide aid is not keeping up with the 
Russian forces. I dread when I get up in 
the morning, each morning, before, but 
especially after, I returned from the 
Ukrainian border. I dread turning on 
the television to see what the latest 
news is and what the sights are from 
Ukraine, only to find more onslaught, 
more death, more destruction. 
Every minute, every day matters. We 
have delayed ourselves in providing fi-
nancial sanctions and in imposing fi-
nancial sanctions. We were slow in en-
ergy sanctions, and we were slow in 
getting a defensive military package in 
place. But we are moving now. 
This Congress has reached its conclu-
sions about the importance of these 
things. This administration has acted, 
but the things that we have promised, 
apparently, still have not in total 
reached Ukraine. 
How difficult it must be to be a 
Ukrainian, knowing that something is 
coming from the outside world to help? 
While I get up and dread the news of 
the day, every moment in their lives 
has to be the expectation, the hope 
that something is going to arrive today 
to bring this incursion, this massacre, 
this death and destruction to an end. 
If you are a parent in Ukraine, it is 
not about what you see on the nightly 
news, on the morning news. It is about 
how am I going to save my children’s 
lives today? What is going to occur in 
a few moments? And our answer can’t 
be: It is coming. We will be there later. 
It has to be: We are there now. 
The defensive military package in-
cludes Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 
Javelin anti-armor weapon systems, 
tactical unmanned aerial systems, gre-
nade launchers, firearms, ammunition, 
and body armor and helmets. But they 
must be delivered. They mean nothing 
on a list. They mean nothing on a piece 
of paper that says we are shipping 
these things, on a bill of lading. They 
mean nothing en route to Ukraine. 
They mean something when they are in 
the hands of the Ukrainians that we 
know to be committed, brave, per-
sistent, undeterred. 
You know in visiting, the Senator 
spoke about the military men and 
women we have seen from our own 
country and what an inspiration they 
are and how much we appreciate their 
service and their sacrifice and their 
families back here in Kansas and 
across the country. 
Our military men and women from 
Kansas have been training Ukrainians 
over the last several years, and even 
they are amazed that, despite their re-
lationships 
and 
training 
with 
the 
Ukrainian soldiers, how successful they 
are. I think, unfortunately, in this 
country we thought that this invasion 
would last a few days and that it would 
be over and the Ukrainian people deci-
mated or surrendered. 
And so our expectations, apparently, 
were that we were not necessary, that 
we were not a solution to this problem. 
The course of events is already pre-
determined, but the human spirit de-
fies all expectations—the human spirit 
of the Ukrainian people, the tremen-
dous leadership. 
My experience suggests to me the 
value of a leader. You can have highly 
trained soldiers, but if you don’t have 
leaders who inspire, their abilities to 
succeed, their abilities to persevere 
disappear. And President Zelenskyy 
has been the role model. 
My guess is that citizens around the 
world look at Zelenskyy and say: Oh, 
that is the kind of clear leadership, de-
termination that we need—clear spo-
ken, clear acting, not running, fighting 
the fight. 
We must make certain—this is a 
moral issue, Americans, the world. If 
you think that the war was going to be 
over in a few days, you may have a dif-
ferent attitude. But now that we know 
that it is not, we have to provide the 
military equipment, the means for the 
Ukrainian people, their military, their 
civilians, not just to survive another 
day but to win the war. How immoral 
it is to provide just enough to live but 
not enough to win. 
What we saw on the Polish-Ukrainian 
border is the impact of Putin’s war to 
these people, to the people of Ukraine, 
to the people of the neighboring coun-
tries—the fear that our NATO allies 
have that Ukraine may not be next. 
Not only do we need to provide the 
equipment and support for Ukrainians 
to win for purposes of the Ukrainian 
people, but if Putin doesn’t pay the 
price, if he feels that he is all-empow-
ered after his march through Ukraine, 
I have no level of comfort that he stops 
at the Ukrainian border. 
I am saddened by what I saw: the 
human suffering, the tragedies. We all 
have kids and grandkids. And we saw 
Ukrainian children; we saw parents 
who love them but had to give them up 
for their safety and security. We saw 
families—wives who love their hus-
bands, spouses who love each other but 
departing because dad, brother needs to 
stay behind to fight the fight. 
And on the other hand, there was the 
tremendous relief in seeing the re-
sponse by others. It happens often in 
crises around the world, when Ameri-
cans and others—the whole world—re-
solve to help people in these cir-
cumstances. 
But this is not a flood; this is not is 
tsunami; this is not an earthquake. 
The sadness of this comes from: This is 
unnecessary. This is one man’s evil ac-
tions causing the desperation and 
death, the tragedy, in Ukraine. 
And we should know that it doesn’t 
end at the Ukrainian borders. Even if 
Putin doesn’t cross the border, the 
hunger, the starvation, the lack of food 
around 
the 
world—Ukraine 
is 
the 
breadbasket of Europe, and its ability 
to feed itself and its ability to feed the 
rest of the world is disappearing. 
We will see the need for assistance 
and humanitarian aid in countries 
around the globe only increase at a 
time in which there is famine in so 
many places. 
It is a circumstance caused by a ty-
rant, whose actions will not just affect 
Ukrainian people, but the rest of the 
world. 
We must be unified with our NATO 
allies. And it was so pleasing to see the 
NATO countries who now recognize the 
importance of NATO and are stepping 
up to fulfill their commitments, in sup-
port of the Ukrainians, but in support 
of this pact that at the end of World 
War II, across the Atlantic, it was de-
cided that America had a role to play, 
but we could only play that role with 
the cooperation of others. 
It is still true today. America has a 
role to play, but we need friends and al-
lies, and we made our commitment to 
NATO. They, too, need to know that 
America will be steadfast. We can dem-
onstrate that by being steadfast in 
Ukraine. 
It is immoral, it is death causing, it 
is damning should the United States of 
America fail in its obligations. 
I will conclude with the story I have 
told before. It comes from watching the 
news—something I try to avoid doing— 
about the reporter who is asking what 
appears to me to be a 10-, 11-year-old 
boy in a Ukrainian orphanage that 
question we often ask young people: 
What do you want to be when you grow 
up? 
This little boy, through an inter-
preter, answered that question, What 
do I want to be when I grow up? His re-
sponse was: I want to be an American. 
What does that tell us about us? 
Americans? It tells us that we are still 
something special. We still matter. The 
rest of the world still pays attention to 
us, and an 11-year-old boy across the 
globe knows enough about us to know 
that is what he wants to be. 
That should make us feel proud as 
Americans, but it also ought to make 
us accept and fulfill our responsibil-
ities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1731 
March 23, 2022 
No 11-year-old boy in an orphanage in 
Ukraine ought to be in an orphanage in 
Ukraine. And we, our allies, must ful-
fill our responsibilities of what it is to 
be an American. 
Madam President, I offer my willing-
ness to work with you and everyone in 
this U.S. Senate, the Congress, and the 
administration to make sure that, 
knowing that there are people in the 
world who know what they want when 
they grow up is to be an American, to 
do my part to make sure that America 
is the place and an American is who 
you would want to be. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
let me start by thanking the junior 
Senator from Iowa for her leadership. 
I thank Senator ERNST for fighting 
for freedom. Thanks for showing me 
the way to continue to fight for those 
who need help. 
This weekend, together, we witnessed 
the worst of mankind, but we also saw 
the best of humankind, and that would 
be the Polish people and the job that 
they have done welcoming—yes, wel-
coming—almost 
a 
million 
refugees 
from Ukraine over a period of about 2 
weeks. 
They didn’t just welcome them. They 
gave them food; they gave them cloth-
ing and shelter. And then more than 
that, they helped process them and get 
them to a location, to a friend, to a rel-
ative, buying them plane tickets, put-
ting them on trains. 
I have done missionary healthcare 
work all across the world, and what we 
saw the Polish people doing there was 
absolutely incredible. Half of the Pol-
ish people have taken a refugee into 
their own homes. 
But like I said, we also witnessed the 
worst of humankind, the worst of man-
kind, and that would be Vladimir 
Putin’s war on the people of Ukraine. 
One Ukrainian woman—her name 
was Olena—whom I spoke with said: 
The Russians are attacking Ukraine from 
the north, from the east, and the south. With 
their missiles, they can reach every place of 
our country—there is no safe place in 
Ukraine any more. Everything can be tar-
geted: hospitals, kindergartens, maternity 
wards, hospitals, everything. 
And another Ukrainian we spoke to, 
Daria, said: 
In the city of Mariupol, almost every sin-
gle building was hit by a Russian bomb or a 
Russian missile. People are residing in bomb 
shelters. They are cut from electricity. They 
are cut from aid, food, and from water. They 
are melting snow to drink water. Russians 
are deliberately throwing bombs into hos-
pitals. 
And, again, I am quoting Daria. 
There is only one hospital remaining. One 
of the hospitals was a maternity hospital. 
Men were trying to evacuate a woman who 
was in labor, and she died with her unborn 
baby. Another pregnant woman—her name 
was Mariana—was going down the stairs. She 
survived. She gave birth. They don’t have 
food now to feed the mother. I don’t know if 
the baby girl is still alive. There are thou-
sands of people dead, but it’s impossible to 
bury them. The bodies—it’s a horror movie 
which is happening—people are dead on the 
streets. 
These stories are heart-wrenching, 
and there is no doubt the world needs 
to step up and we need Europe to lead. 
And I am so proud to report the buzz 
across Europe and the buzz across Ger-
many as we landed, that the Germans 
are committed once again to this 
transatlantic partnership and a will-
ingness to commit dollars and funds to 
this NATO alliance and to the security 
of the world. 
That said, there is so much more 
that we can still do short of boots on 
the ground. And like my Ukrainian 
friends remind me: This war didn’t 
start with Russia on February 24. 
And this is Olena again. She said the 
weakness of the United States started 
much earlier: 
Since the beginning of November, we’ve 
been shouting out loud to help arm Ukraine, 
sanction Nord Stream 2—why did the U.S. 
lift sanctions on Nord Stream 2 and basically 
give the green light for Putin to move for-
ward in Ukraine? We clearly warned that 
that might happen—we were not heard. 
Earlier this month, the Ukrainians 
said that they met with Secretary 
Blinkin and they begged him to please 
send air defense systems now. But 
weeks later, they still don’t have them. 
This is day No. 26 since Russia invaded, 
and the Ukrainians are telling us they 
are not seeing any American weapons 
yet. 
I asked them to describe to me what 
they needed to win this war, and their 
answer was very simple: maximum 
military assistance as it relates to 
weapons, including, MiGs, A–10s, Jave-
lins, Stingers, drones. 
Look, the Ukrainians can win this 
ground war, but the problem is Russia 
is launching bombs from their own air-
space, from their own land, from the 
seas as well. What they need are mis-
siles that will intercept the Russian 
bombs. 
Another Polish woman we met said: 
We were ready as Poland to give these 
MiGs— 
This is a Polish woman speaking 
now. 
We were ready as Poland to give them the 
MiGs, but the Biden administration didn’t 
want us to provide them. And what hap-
pened—instead of consulting us, the Biden 
administration decided to go public without 
the Polish Government even knowing that 
this was the case. 
The impression in Ukraine is that 
the White House is undermining the 
giving of weapons from our allies to 
the Ukrainians, that they are thwart-
ing the transfer of these weapons. One 
of the Ukrainians even went so far as 
to say she wanted to steal the MiGs be-
cause there was just no other option. 
This war was completely preventable 
had the United States projected its 
strength. The United States can do so 
much more. President Zelenskyy has 
begged us, the United States, to lead 
more, but this administration is fol-
lowing 
the 
footsteps 
of 
President 
Obama by leading from behind. They 
have been slow to react at every step. 
This is a portion of a cruise missile 
that hit in Ukraine. Two Ukrainian 
diplomats describing to me what hap-
pened, where 35 people were killed by 
the cruise missile. This was launched 
by Russia on one of the days that 
President Biden said what NATO will 
not do to help Ukraine. 
Let me say that again. This was 
launched the day that President Biden 
said what NATO will not do to help 
Ukraine. 
This is the very telegraphing that 
has, yet again, proved to be deadly. As 
Ukrainians pointed out to us, this is 
what led to the disastrous Afghanistan 
withdrawal. In their words—the words 
of the Ukrainians, not mine—they say 
this administration is operating what 
they call an ‘‘Afghanistan syndrome.’’ 
The Ukrainian people don’t need 
speeches. They don’t need words. They 
don’t need resolutions. They don’t need 
Americans forming committees and 
praying about it. They need more than 
our prayers. They need action. They 
need action. 
I call for a war tribunal to be formed 
and Putin and his generals to be held 
accountable and put on trial for crimes 
against humanity. 
The world needs to seize his personal 
assets and the assets of his oligarchs, 
and we need to use those personal as-
sets to rebuild Ukraine. The world 
needs to stop doing business with Rus-
sia today. Don’t wait on your govern-
ments. Don’t wait on the sanctions. I 
call on every business in the world to 
stop doing business with Russia today. 
And finally, the United States needs 
to implement our sanctions today, not 
yesterday. We don’t need to delay until 
June 24 a waiver on energy payments 
from Russian banks. 
We still have so much more we could 
do short of putting American boots on 
the ground. We need to send this mili-
tary aid yesterday—not tomorrow, not 
next week. 
It is not a time to debate. Give them 
the damn weapons. The brave Ukrain-
ian people will use them. They will 
fight to the death, but they have to be 
empowered to do it, and every day we 
wait, thousands more will die. 
I want to finish on a positive note. I 
am so proud of these young men and 
women, American fighters in the Big 
Red One, the 1st Infantry Division of 
Fort Riley, KS. They have been there 
for years training Ukrainians, training 
our partners. 
Some of the folks will ask me back 
home: Are we going to be safe? I have 
got all the faith and confidence in the 
world of our soldiers, of our military— 
all the confidence in the world of these 
men and women that are willing to put 
their lives on the line. 
And let me reassure you also that the 
Ukrainian people are not going to give 
up. They are not going to give up. They 
are going to fight for every inch, every 
mile of their home soil. 
In Poland, Olena and Daria told me 
just before we departed: 
America is the leader of NATO. Every 
NATO country is looking at what America is

doing and not doing. What America is saying 
and what America is not saying. We know 
that there are NATO countries here on the 
border who have weapons which we need, but 
they simply need backup from America. We 
will win this war. But, at which price will we 
win this war? Help us win it at the price of 
less casualty. That’s what we are asking the 
United States. 
Like I said earlier, the Ukrainians 
can win this war. There is a path to 
victory. I believe in them, but the 
world has to step up. We have to em-
power them. We are doing so little of 
what we could be doing. 
I was taught at a young age: Of him 
who much is given, much is required. 
And the United States has been given 
so much. We are still the leader of the

like it.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
there is a lot going on in the world 
right now: Ukraine; what is happening 
in China; what is happening with the 
Iran nuclear conversation right now 
with Russia and the United States and 
China; record inflation here in the 
United States. There is so much going 
on that I am concerned that we are not 
also focused on an area at our south-
west border. 
It is interesting; I have had folks who 
have caught me and have said: Things 
must be going better at our southwest 
border because I don’t hear about it as 
much. 
Actually, there is just so much other 
news that it is drowning it out. 
So what is actually happening at our 
southwest border right now, and where 
are we? Let me give you a little bit of 
context and then to be able to talk 
through some of the issues that are 
happening. 
Today, on our southwest border, 
about 6,300 people have already ille-
gally crossed. Now, a day that they can 
manage is about 3,500 people. So we are 
still hearing record numbers of people 
illegally crossing the border. 
To set this in context, during the 4 
years of the Trump Presidency, there 
were 2.4 million people who were en-
countered illegally crossing the border 
during the 4 years of the Trump Presi-
dency. During the first 14 months of 
the Biden Presidency, we have already 
exceeded that number. We have had 
more illegal encounters in the first 14 
months than there were in the previous 
4 years. 
In this process of all these individ-
uals crossing the border, it has been in-
teresting. There was something that 
was put in place in January of 2020 
called title 42 authority. Now, let me 
explain this briefly. Because of the 
pandemic 
that 
was 
happening, 
in 
March of 2020, the Trump administra-
tion put in place that, for single adult 
individuals who were crossing the bor-
der, they would be turned around at 
the border based on the pandemic that 
was happening. The Biden administra-
tion agreed with that policy, and when 
they came in, they kept title 42 in 
place. In fact, last year, 1.1 million peo-
ple were turned around at the border 
under title 42 authority. 
Title 42 authority was always in-
tended to be temporary. It is not a per-
manent immigration policy; it is dur-
ing the pandemic, although it is ironic 
that the administration is looking to 
lift title 42 authority on the border at 
the same time—this month—members 
of the National Guard are being forced 
to resign if they don’t have their vac-
cine. So if you don’t take your vaccine 
and you are in the National Guard, you 
are being forced out, or if you are in 
the military and you haven’t taken it, 
you are being forced to resign the mili-
tary, but people illegally crossing our 
border can come into the United 
States. 
At the same month that there is con-
versation about dropping the title 42 
authority, we are still wearing a mask 
on our planes, in buses, and in trains 
based on a requirement of the adminis-
tration on a threat to COVID. At the 
same time that is occurring, the ad-
ministration is looking to lift the title 
42 issues at our southern border. 
They have had a year to be able to 
plan for this. I have been in conversa-
tion with Ali Mayorkas and with DHS. 
We have had multiple conversations 
with the leaders. I have been on the 
border multiple times to be able to 
talk to the leadership there, to say we 
have all known that at some point, 
title 42 authority is going away, so 
when that occurs, what is the plan to 
deal with illegal immigration or what 
they call irregular migration? What is 
the plan at that point? 
Well, we are finally getting bits and 
pieces of the plan. The plan is, appar-
ently, from the notes that we are get-
ting and the conversations we have had 
at the staff level and that I can piece 
together from multiple conversations 
with multiple leaders, after a year of 
considering what to be able to do about 
illegal 
immigration 
and 
increasing 
numbers at the border, apparently, 
within the next couple of weeks, they 
are going to stop title 42 to be able to 
more rapidly move people into the in-
terior of the country faster so the bor-
der looks less chaotic. The plan is to 
move people into the country faster so 
there is not a camera shot on people 
backed up at the border. That is the 
plan. 
I wish I was kidding on that, but in a 
briefing with my staff last week, DHS

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1733 
March 23, 2022 
Office of Intelligence and Analysis told 
our team that as soon as they release 
title 42, they anticipate tens of thou-
sands of migrants crossing the border 
within hours; that they are literally 
camped up on the south side of the bor-
der and that they will flood the border. 
DHS Office of Intelligence anticipates 
hundreds of thousands of migrants 
crossing within 2 weeks and as many as 
a million crossing within 6 weeks of 
when they lift title 42 authority. 
May I remind us, last summer, when 
we saw all the chaos on our southern 
border, that was 900,000 for an entire 
year. They are anticipating as many as 
a million in 6 weeks illegally crossing 
our border, and their plan is not to 
turn them around; their plan is to bus 
them to towns and cities all over the 
United States so they would move 
away from the border quickly. That 
does not feel like a plan to me; that 
feels like a recipe for chaos and frus-
tration from American citizens across 
the country. 
The plan continues to be able to give 
individuals a piece of paper that they 
would have a court hearing 6 years in 
the future—6 years. I wish I was kid-
ding about this. They will come across 
the border, be given a piece of paper, 
told they have a hearing 6 years in the 
future, and if they would like to apply 
for a work status, they can get that 
after they are here 6 months. 
Last year, we had the highest number 
of illegal crossings in the history of our 
country—last year. The administration 
is now planning for that number to 
skyrocket this year. Their solution is 
to give work permits, move people fast-
er to the interior of the country, and 
repeat. That is not a plan; that is a for-
mula for disaster. That is individuals 
and families moving into the country 
who don’t have legal status by the mil-
lions. 
May I remind this body that last 
year, we had individuals from every 
single country on the planet who were 
encountered on our border last year il-
legally crossing—every single country. 
Yes, that includes Iran, North Korea, 
Russia. You name it, every country on 
the planet illegally crossed our border. 
The plan this year is not to turn them 
around; the plan this year is to expe-
dite them into the interior of the coun-
try, hand them a form, and say: Show 
up at court 6 years from now. Oh, by 
the way, while you are waiting, you 
can have a work permit. 
That is going to just drive even more 
illegal immigration into our country. 
That is going to drive people from all 
over the world to be able to come here 
and to cross our border illegally. That 
is an invitation to chaos. And I cannot 
even believe, even with this adminis-
tration, that after a year of planning, 
this is the plan for what they are going 
to do for illegal immigration on our 
southern border. 
Last summer, we found out through a 
series of rumors that ICE was planning 
to put up what they were calling a 
surge overflow temporary processing 
facility in Western Oklahoma, at a pri-
vate prison there. I contacted DHS, 
confirmed that they were actually 
planning this, and told them the obvi-
ous issues with that. There was no bus 
station in that area. There was no air-
port in that area. They were literally 
looking to move thousands of people 
from the border into Western Okla-
homa, into a small town, and just re-
lease them at that point, and they can 
figure out what to do and where to go 
from there. 
The administration, after 48 hours of 
our back and forth, of me pushing, 
pulled back their plan and said they 
weren’t going to do it. But I have noted 
their response back to me at the end of 
that. They said that they had decided 
not to pursue this facility at this time. 
What was threatened in my State a 
year ago is very likely coming to many 
States that are represented in this 
room in the weeks ahead, where indi-
viduals are moved all over the country, 
into small towns and large towns, to be 
able to move people away from the bor-
der—what even DHS estimates may be 
a million people in 6 weeks to every 
part of the country so the border 
doesn’t look chaotic. Can I ask you, is 
your town set up to receive people 
coming from all over the world to come 
into your town—a million in a 6-week 
time period? 
Interior processing is a terrible idea. 
It is a terrible idea. And after a year, 
DHS can do better than this. So what 
do we need to do about this? My Demo-
cratic colleagues have a unique rela-
tionship with this President. You have 
the opportunity to be able to call the 
office, to sit down with the leadership 
team, and to say: This looks like a par-
ticularly bad idea. The American peo-
ple do not like chaos, and they do not 
like illegal immigration. The American 
people love legal immigration. We 
cheer at nationality events. We show 
up in droves and watch people pledge 
allegiance to the flag for the first time 
as an American citizen. But the Amer-
ican people do not like illegal immigra-
tion, especially one that is unlimited, 
chaotic, and from every country in the 
world. 
So I made contact with the adminis-
tration. I am laying this marker down. 
We are going to do everything that we 
possibly can as a team to be able to 
make it clear that this administration 
plans to bring chaos to the United 
States in the next several months, and 
we are going to do everything we can 
to be able to stop that. This is not 
some random threat. 
The President of the United States 
has a unique responsibility to enforce 
the law. That is what Presidents do. 
And the people in my State are not 
asking for something odd or peculiar; 
they are asking simply for the Presi-
dent of the United States to enforce 
the law of the United States. 
May I remind this body of a statistic 
you may or may not remember. Last 
year, ICE deported 57,000 people total 
in a year. We had 2.3 million people il-
legally encountered at the southern 
border, and ICE deported 57,000 total in 
a year. It was a record-low number of 
deportations and a record-high number 
of illegal crossings. And now they are 
planning to lift title 42. All 100 of us 
should be addressing this administra-
tion and telling them this is a bad idea, 
and I pray they hear us out. 
To the President of the United 
States: Just enforce the law. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Washington. 
H.R. 4521 
Ms. CANTWELL. I come to the floor 
to talk about the underlying bill that 
we are trying to get passed. That is the 
United States Innovation and Competi-
tion Act that we passed here in the 
U.S. Senate about 280 days ago. 
One aspect of that bill is a provision 
that we just had a hearing on in the 
Commerce Committee today, and that 
is the funding of what are called semi-
conductors, the key technology ena-
bling so much of the technology sec-
tors today—from your phones to your 
smart devices, to automobiles, to the 
transition we want to make on clean 
energy, to just about everything that 
we see that is essential to be smarter, 
more connected, and to play off some 
of the advances in technology that 
allow us to be more efficient. 
But we are here to talk about how 
chips are also a supply chain issue. And 
the supply chain of this product has 
definitely been impacted over the last 
few years, both by the fact that there 
has been a higher demand for them and 
because of what has happened during 
COVID. 
In fact, 90 percent of the chips that 
are most advanced today come from 
Taiwan. Today’s hearing was about 
how the United States of America 
needs to do more to produce the next 
generation of advanced chips for artifi-
cial intelligence, automation, and ad-
vanced manufacturing, here in the 
United States, and that an overreliance 
on the global supply chain—which 
every American can tell you about the 
supply chain now because there are 
products that they are not getting be-
cause of the supply chain or the price 
has gone up because of the supply 
chain—but we know that this issue of 
getting this Innovation and Competi-
tion Act and getting the funding for 
more production to be done in the 
United States on something as critical 
as semiconductors is a very key issue. 
So I hope our colleagues will help us 
get to conference and resolve this issue 
with our colleagues. 
But I would like to talk about a few 
of those sectors that are really impact-
ing and hurting Americans. First of all, 
in the automotive sector, thousands of 
American workers have endured layoffs 
due to the shortage. The global auto-
mobile industry suffered over 200 bil-
lion in losses, and Ford was forced to 
halt or cut production at eight plants 
as recently as last month. 
The cost of a used car has gone up 41 
percent, and the price of new cars 12

S1734 
March 23, 2022 
percent. A lot of this is due to the 
semiconductor shortage. Let me repeat 
those numbers: The price of a used car 
has gone up 41 percent; the price of a 
new car over here, 12 percent. And this 
is the price of a 12-percent increase on 
new equipment. 
Well, if you think about it, right 
now, for most of those people trying to 
buy the new cars, they might be on a 
waiting list. But people who can easily 
afford a new car and need one but can’t 
get it due to the shortage, they are 
buying used cars instead, and that is 
what is driving up the price. 
So who feels the pain at the pump? It 
is not the person who has to wait a few 
extra months for that new car that 
they wanted. It is the person whose ra-
diator blew out last week who just 
needs anything to drive to work—any-
thing to get them to and from their 
job. But now that used car is 41 percent 
more expensive. That basic used car 
might have cost $5,000 last year, but if 
you add the 41 percent to that, it is 
now costing $7,000. 
So where is the extra $2,000 coming 
from? For that American consumer 
who has to delay a family trip or do 
without things for their children or 
maybe not even be able to pay next 
month’s rent, all of this is due to the 
impacts that we are seeing from this 
shortage. 
So chips and the semiconductor ef-
fort that we are trying to address in 
the underlying bill are really the ulti-
mate supply chain issue; that is, that 
some of the networking equipment 
that I mentioned here—a 12-percent in-
crease—sometimes people are selling 
chips for a hundred times their regular 
price just so that people will compete 
for them to build out the broadband ac-
cess. 
We also are seeing issues of security, 
now that the source of the chips are so 
concentrated in Taiwan, that at least 7 
different chip manufacturers, people 
have tried to hack them to steal the 
designs of these chips. So these are all 
the reasons why we, today, here need 
to advance this bill and say to the 
House: We want to go to conference. 
We want to move forward on this legis-
lation. 
This legislation also supports $2 bil-
lion for, specifically, Defense Depart-
ment efforts to secure the supply 
chain, as well, and to help us face this 
increase in demand. 
I just want to say this to my col-
leagues. I know some people think: 
Well, this issue will be over. It will be 
down the road. It is not going to be 
over until we act. Right now, the world 
needs 1 trillion chips per year. You 
need 1 trillion chips per year. In 2021, 
that went up to 1.2 trillion chips per 
year. In 2031, it is going to be 2 trillion 
chips per year. 
And this is driven by—you can see 
the demand. So there is a 200-percent 
increase in what is going to be needed 
from the automotive sector, a 60-per-
cent increase from the wireless sector, 
and an 80-percent increase in the con-
sumer electronics sector. 
So the question is, Are we just going 
to wait and see what happens in Tai-
wan? Or are we going to make an in-
vestment here in the United States to 
jump from that 1.2 trillion a year to 2 
trillion a year and make it be leading- 
edge U.S. technology? 
So I am thankful for this underlying 
bill today, and I thank the witnesses 
who testified at today’s hearing. 
One particular industry that was 
there was PACCAR, a company based 
in Washington that is leading the way 
on transportation, automotive, and 
driverless trucks, and they explained 
what this has done to impact their 
business, why we need advanced chips, 
and why we need to continue as a na-
tion to promote them. 
So I definitely hope our colleagues 
will see forth to move forward on this 
kind of investment, get the underlying 
R&D bill onto the President’s desk so 
we can do what we do best in the 
United States of America and that is 
invent, make our manufacturers com-
petitive, and grow jobs. 
OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT 
Madam President, with that, I would 
like to turn to another issue. I have 
been joined here on the floor by my 
colleague Senator KLOBUCHAR. We very 
much 
appreciate 
her 
and 
Senator 
THUNE’s efforts on trying to tackle 
some of the supply chain issues that 
are at the ports. 
Our ports are seeing record amounts 
of traffic—a 20-some-percent increase 
in the amount of traffic coming into 
the United States—and that congestion 
has caused lots of problems at our 
ports. 
Senators KLOBUCHAR and THUNE an-
nounced legislation that we marked up 
in committee earlier this week that I 
hope will see action on the Senate floor 
as early as next week. That legislation 
puts new tools into the hands of the 
Federal Maritime Commission, whose 
job it is to make sure that there aren’t 
unreasonable rates or practices that 
impact 
negatively 
shippers 
in 
the 
United States. 
And right now, what is happening is 
particularly our agricultural sector is 
getting very hard-hit; that is, that lit-
erally some of these foreign shippers 
that were at record profits and record 
millions have basically been leaving 
without the U.S. exports. They lit-
erally are coming to the United States, 
dropping product off, leaving less than 
full, and hurrying back to pick up more 
product and deliver it to the United 
States. 
And our growers haven’t been able to 
get their products onto those ships, 
and the result of that is they are left 
on the docks, without the ability to de-
liver the product to the customers that 
they would like to see. 
So our farmers need help and solu-
tions on this. One solution by the 
Biden-Harris administration that Sec-
retary Vilsack has implemented is a 
popup space at our ports to help defray 
the cost of freight that has been 
caused. 
I just want our colleagues to know 
that more needs to be done with the 
Klobuchar-Thune bill because the con-
tainer cost has gone from $1,300 per 
container to $11,000 per container. This 
is part of data that has been provided 
to us. 
And what has happened is not only 
the costs that they are facing, as I 
said, sometimes they are called, and it 
is said: If your product isn’t here, then 
we are leaving without it. And that is 
a big problem if you are talking about 
Washington apples, seafood, any of the 
other products that are big from our 
State. 
One 
individual 
who 
testified—or 
came to a press event that we had in 
Seattle last week said that the dairy 
industry and supply chain last year 
and the problems cost U.S. dairy over 
$1.5 billion. And it means that more 
containers are leaving the port empty. 
We believe that the loss of revenue to 
the ag sector may be as much as 22 per-
cent; that is, that our ag sector isn’t 
being able to get their product out. 
So I want to thank the President for 
his infrastructure package and putting 
more money into ports and port devel-
opment, as we did in a bipartisan way 
with our colleagues in the Commerce 
Committee, and also for getting this 
project up and running here at Ter-
minal 46 in Seattle. 
This popup storage helped facilitate 
and pre-position our agricultural prod-
ucts so that they could be ready to get 
on those ships and not face a penalty 
because of the congestion we are see-
ing. 
USDA is providing our exporters with 
$200 to $400 per container to help with 
the storage cost, but it is literally get-
ting them in position so that they can 
be right around the corner and get 
picked up quickly. So I want to thank 
the Biden administration for that. 
But I also want to encourage our col-
leagues to move ahead, as I mentioned, 
on the Klobuchar-Thune bill, which is 
saying to the major Federal entity 
whose day job it is to oversee reason-
able rates as it relates to shipping in 
the United States, please, let’s get this 
legislation on the Senate floor. If we 
care about supply chain issues, if we 
care about the prices that are impact-
ing consumers, then let’s get this legis-
lation on the floor. 
Obviously, the amount of costs that 
we are seeing per container and the 
amount of increase in those container 
costs are impacting everyone. 
So if those costs are on every con-
tainer, whether they are coming in or 
leaving, then we are seeing increased 
costs to consumers and consumer prod-
ucts all across the board. 
So let’s get these supply chain issues, 
like USICA—the United States Innova-
tion and Competition Act—let’s get 
that supply chain moving. Let’s get 
that supply chain of us making legisla-
tion with the House moving so we can 
fix real supply chain problems with our 
semiconductors. And let’s get this Fed-
eral Maritime Commission bill on the

March 23, 2022 
floor next week so we can address the 
supply chain problems that are costing 
us more with ag and costing us more 
with imports. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Min-
nesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
want to thank the Senator from Wash-
ington for her incredible leadership of 
the Commerce Committee and focusing 
on the issues that matter to businesses, 
something the Presiding Officer, as the 
former Governor of Colorado and some-
one who knows a little bit about busi-
ness understands as well. We have to 
fix these supply chain issues, and we 
have to actually take up the torch. 
We have gotten through the worst of 
this pandemic; we see the lighthouse 
on the horizon; and it is time to move 
forward with our economy. 
And instead of just diagnosing the 
problem, we actually have to do some 
things to fix it. And on that list, for 
my own State, I would say, No. 1 is 
workforce and getting people into the 
jobs that we have available; No. 2, 
something Senator CANTWELL has made 
so clear, is the semiconductors and all 
of the things we should be making in 
America; No. 3 is infrastructure. We 
are so proud of the bipartisan infra-
structure bill that we worked so hard 
on and the money going to improve our 
ports, including the port in Duluth, the 
busiest port on Lake Superior. And 
then, finally, something I am going to 
address today, the Ocean Shipping Re-
form Act, a bipartisan bill that I lead 
with 
Senator 
THUNE, 
unanimously 
passed the Commerce Committee yes-
terday, and I want to thank Senators 
CANTWELL and WICKER for their leader-
ship and help on the bill. 
Senator THUNE and I are both in the 
middle of the country. In fact, we are 
neighbors in Minnesota and South Da-
kota, and we know that American 
farmers feed the world and consumers 
and businesses look to them for in-de-
mand ag goods from soybeans to corn, 
to dairy, to poultry, to pork, to beef, to 
name just a few. 
We also have tons of small and big 
manufacturers in the middle of the 
country—and it is not just Minnesota 
or Colorado or South Dakota that have 
been seeing the delays in shipping. It is 
everywhere in this Nation. 
The past 2 years have highlighted 
significant supply chain disruptions 
and vulnerabilities for U.S. exporters, 
including many families across my 
home State. 
U.S. companies have only been able 
to ship 60 percent of their orders be-
cause they can’t access shipping con-
tainers during certain parts of this 
pandemic. At the same time, ocean car-
riers—almost all foreign owned—have 
reported record profits. It is estimated 
that the mostly foreign container ship-
ping industry made a record $190 bil-
lion in profits in 2021, a sevenfold in-
crease from the previous year. 
Their 
financial 
performance 
cer-
tainly isn’t the result of improved per-
formance, given how many things we 
have not been able to ship out. No, 
they are fleecing consumers and ex-
porters because they know they can 
get away with it, and this is all while 
exporters and consumers are paying 
the price, literally, for the supply 
chain disruptions caused by their unre-
liable service. 
We need to get exports to those who 
need them. We need to be a country 
that makes stuff, invents things, ex-
ports to the world. That is why Senator 
THUNE and I put together the Ocean 
Shipping Reform Act. We also want to 
thank our colleagues in the House who 
have a very similar bill. 
Our bill protects American farmers 
and manufacturers by making it easier 
for them to ship ready-to-export goods 
waiting at our ports. It levels the play-
ing field for American exporters by up-
dating Federal regulations for the glob-
al shipping industry. It gives the Fed-
eral Maritime Commission greater au-
thority to regulate harmful practices 
by big international ocean carriers. 
It directs the Federal Maritime Com-
mission to issue a rule prohibiting 
international ocean carriers from un-
reasonably declining shipping opportu-
nities for U.S. exports. 
Believe it or not, they bring in stuff 
from other countries, and then what do 
they export back? Air. Air. So many 
empty containers with nothing in 
them. This would fix that. 
In addition to giving the FMC more 
authority to investigate bad practices, 
the bill also directs the FMC to set new 
rules for what the international carrier 
companies can reasonably charge and 
require ocean carriers to certify and ul-
timately prove that the fees they 
charge are fair. As rates continue to 
climb, this is more urgent than ever. 
The sheer act of passing this bill will 
send a major message to the foreign- 
owned ocean shipping industry that it 
is time to ship our goods out of Amer-
ica and to charge our American manu-
facturers and our American farmers 
and, thus, our consumers a fair rate. 
I want to again thank Chairman 
CANTWELL
and 
Ranking 
Member 
WICKER for holding a compelling hear-
ing on this bill, all members of the 
Commerce Committee for passing it 
through, and Senator THUNE and I have 
a bipartisan group of 27 cosponsors:

BENNET, 
CRAMER, 
WYDEN, BLUNT, VAN HOLLEN, BOOZMAN, 
FISCHER, PADILLA, and, yes, the Pre-
siding Officer, Senator HICKENLOOPER. 
We are excited about the bill, and I 
am going to end my remarks a little 
quickly because I know Senator COONS 
has some very important remarks him-
self about a fantastic staff member. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
REMEMBERING MADELEINE ALBRIGHT 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to 
offer some brief remarks about a dear 
friend, someone upon whom I have re-
lied as a mentor, someone who has 
served our Nation across many dec-
ades, and someone whose passing ear-
lier today is a moment of great signifi-
cance for our Nation and our place in 
the world. 
I happen to have been a Truman 
scholar; some of my best friends are 
Truman scholars; and the person whose 
passing we mourn today I first met be-
cause she was the chair of the Truman 
Scholarship Foundation Board. 
I am speaking of the former Ambas-
sador to the United Nations, the 
former Secretary of State, Madeleine 
Albright, whom I first got to know dec-
ades ago, but whom, in my dozen years 
here in the Senate, I got to know as a 
mentor and a friend, someone whose 
lilting humor, whose brilliant insights, 
whose force of personality, and whose 
charisma were unmatched. 
One of the greatest memories I will 
have in my life was a dinner I got to 
enjoy last year with former Secretary 
and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, 
Colin Powell, and former Secretary of 
State and Ambassador to the United 
Nations, Madeleine Albright, and the 
Ambassador to the United Kingdom. 
We sat in her garden and talked for 
hours about the world, about conflict, 
about Russia and China, about Putin, 
about the Balkans, about a whole 
range of things, and I learned so much. 
Madeleine never lost her love for this 
institution, for the Senate. It was here 
that she, as a relatively young staffer, 
cut her teeth on politics and on being 
engaged in policymaking. 
And one of the things that always 
amused her was that this desk—the 
desk of Senator Biden and Senator 
KENNEDY—was also the desk of Senator 
Ed Muskie, a Senator from Maine for 
whom she worked for a number of 
years. She was his chief LA from 1976 
until 1978 and then went to work for 
Zbigniew Brzezinski on the National 
Security Council. 
I will simply say this. Today, we 
have lost one of our best and one of our 
brightest, one of the most passionate 
in her dedication to democracy. 
As someone who was born overseas in 
Prague, 
Czechoslovakia, 
and 
who, 
along with her family, fled communism 
to come to the United States, she never 
stopped offering her insights, her ad-
vice, her passionate dedication to de-
mocracy. In the books that she read, in 
the pins that she wore, in the speeches 
that she gave, in the students that she 
mentored, Madeleine Albright touched 
so many lives. 
Yet she on occasion was gracious 
enough to give me just a few minutes 
of her time. Through her, her daughter 
Alice and her grandson David became 
great and dear friends. David’s service 
in my office was an enormous blessing 
to me and my team. 
I just wanted to ask for prayers for 
them, for their family, and for all

whose lives were touched by Madeleine 
Albright. 
TRIBUTE TO TOM MANCINELLI 
Mr. President, I rise today to make 
some comments about a truly bitter-
sweet moment in my career of service. 
I have been an elected official for 22 
years. I have had the opportunity to 
work alongside dozens—actually hun-
dreds of dedicated, capable, and hard- 
working staff. None have earned my 
trust and my confidence, driven my 
agenda, set my priorities, and been so 
central to my service and my life like 
my national security adviser, Tom 
Mancinelli. 
Like me, a Truman scholar, Tom is 
someone who decided early on to set 
his sights towards a life in public serv-
ice. In the 7 years he has been a mem-
ber of my team, he has been an incred-
ible mentor, a great leader, and some-
one upon whose advice I have always 
been able to rely. 
I hired him from service at the De-
partment of State, where he was chief 
of staff of the Bureau of Political-Mili-
tary Affairs. He was a Presidential 
Management Fellow before that, but 
most importantly, he is a Naval Acad-
emy graduate and was an officer in the 
Marine Corps. I note that brings a 
smile to his face even now. 
As I had a chance just last week to 
say to the Commandant, I have seen, 
through Tom’s service in my office, a 
gentleman, an officer who has lived the 
values of the Corps with honor and 
courage and commitment; someone 
who has lived his life with an uncom-
promising code of integrity, respect for 
human dignity, respect for others, and 
an intense commitment to his service 
and a joyful and whimsical spirit. 
As a result of our years together 
traveling around the world and our 
time here in the United States, a num-
ber of phrases and terms have become a 
part of my lexicon that I did not know 
before: 
‘‘Once a Marine, always a Marine.’’ 
‘‘Every Marine a rifleman.’’ 
‘‘No plan survives contact with the 
enemy.’’ 
‘‘Officers eat last.’’ 
Tom has been an exemplar of the sort 
of servant leadership embodied in the 
phrase ‘‘Officers eat last.’’ It means 
you take care of your team, of your 
squad, of the men and women entrusted 
to you. In his two tours in Iraq and in 
his 7 years with me, Tom has shown 
that exemplary. 
I have celebrated the Marine Corps’ 
birthday with him. I have heard him 
talk about Tun Tavern. I have seen 
him brighten the days of countless ma-
rines deployed as parts of security de-
tachments at Embassies around the 
world with a hearty ‘‘Semper Fi.’’ He 
has always made sure that we re-
spected and paid attention to the lives 
and the service of the men and women 
of our Armed Forces. 
Although it is with great regret that 
I congratulate him on this, I congratu-
late him today on his next tour, which 
will be at the Department of Defense. 
Through our time together, we have 
traveled to 54 countries. That is nearly 
a third of the countries on Earth. We 
have pressed dictators and autocrats 
for democratic progress and human 
rights. We have visited refugee camps 
in some of the toughest places on 
Earth to hear those fleeing persecution 
and civil war. We trekked to see moun-
tain gorillas in Virunga National Park 
in Rwanda, and I have watched him 
with, just over the rise, an elephant in 
the near distance. We carried out a 
Presidential mission to go to Ethiopia 
in the middle of a civil war, and we 
helped deliver vaccines to our partners, 
from Guatemala to Taiwan. We visited 
American 
troops 
stationed 
abroad 
more times than I can count. 
Tom has helped me write and intro-
duce and get marked up and pass bills 
that would invest in our strategic com-
petition with China, advance elec-
trification across Africa, combat wild-
life trafficking, address the root causes 
of violence and extremism—the Global 
Fragility Act—and support young Pal-
estinian entrepreneurs. There is a long, 
long list. But the one of which I am 
proudest for him and I hope something 
of which he is proud as well is the huge 
amount of effort he dedicated to lead-
ing the BUILD Act, signed into law in 
2018, to establish the new U.S. Develop-
ment Finance Corporation—$60 billion 
in capability deployed to do everything 
from vaccine manufacturing to sus-
tainable agriculture, from women’s 
empowerment to deploying solar en-
ergy in the developing world. The DFC 
will have a remarkable impact for a 
very long time to come. 
As I have said, it is not just the hard 
work of policymaking but the inside- 
the-room work of mentoring and guid-
ing fellows and staff members, becom-
ing the sort of person upon whom I can 
rely to execute a flawless congressional 
delegation trip overseas, or codel. 
Frankly, I think one of our most re-
cent trips, among the most memorable, 
was also among his most successful. We 
crisscrossed the world with a con-
stantly shifting constellation of Mem-
bers of the House and Senate, leaving 
from Andrews Air Force Base, flying 
overnight to Brussels for visits with 
the EU, NATO, and Belgium, and then 
continued that same day on to Scot-
land. We spent time at both the COP26 
global conference on climate change 
and in Edinburgh, looking at new 
means of generating electricity and 
power, and capped off that day with a 
celebration with the Scottish Govern-
ment at Edinburgh Castle. 
We then loaded back on the plane and 
went all the way to Qatar, had dinner 
with the Emir, breakfast with the For-
eign Minister, and visited Afghan refu-
gees and an Air Force base at which 
Americans were deployed. 
We went on from there to Jerusalem, 
to Tel Aviv, to Ramallah, to meet with 
the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, 
and Defense Minister of Israel and the 
Prime Minister of the Palestinian Au-
thority. 
Not yet done, we got on a plane and 
went to Berlin to meet with the now- 
Chancellor central to our response to 
Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and 
members of the Bundestag before fly-
ing home. 
All of this was in 1 week—no mess, no 
fuss, flawless, excellently executed, 
perfectly planned. 
Tom takes the time in the course of 
a codel like that, rather than being fre-
netic or self-important, to make sure 
that the other staffers on the trip are 
learning about how they will lead fu-
ture codels, that all the Members are 
attended to and supported, and that it 
is a purposeful investment of the time 
and resources of the American people, 
all while taking a little bit of time to 
go celebrate with the marines who 
helped execute that fantastic codel. 
Most impressively to me, Tom has 
found a way to excel at his career in 
my office while still being a great fa-
ther to his children George and Ruth 
and a husband to his accomplished wife 
Sarah. On a few occasions, I have had 
to chase him out and say: Don’t miss 
that. Often, he has already gone to a 
parent-teacher conference, to a base-
ball game, understanding that is his 
first mission and something to which 
he is tirelessly dedicated. 
He will continue his record of public 
service as the Principal Deputy Assist-
ant Secretary of Defense for Legisla-
tive Affairs, and I have warned him, 
dealing with Congress is a really miser-
able duty. But there is no one—no 
one—they could have hired who would 
carry this duty out better or more 
thoroughly, with more character and 
competence, than Tom Mancinelli. 
Hiring Tom was one of the best 
choices I have ever made. For as many 
years as he will return my calls, I will 
continue to call on him for advice and 
counsel. I very much look forward to 
his next chapter in public service. 
As I was talking with my own chil-
dren just this weekend, my youngest 
said to me that of all the people she 
has gotten to know in my office, he 
most exemplified to her what it means 
to be an American, a patriot, and pub-
lic servant. I can offer no greater com-
pliment than that—well deserved, well 
performed, well served. 
To my favorite marine, thank you. 
With that, I yield the floor.

UKRAINE 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today 
marks 1 month since the illegal and 
unprovoked 
Russian 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine 
began. 
Since 
that 
time, 
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has 
proven himself a courageous and in-
spiring leader, the Ukrainian military 
has performed heroically in the face of 
overwhelming 
violence, 
and 
the 
Ukrainian people have shown the world 
what true courage looks like. 
There is one person who is respon-
sible for so much suffering and catas-
trophe: Vladimir Putin. Faced with 
this senseless attack, Ukraine and the

March 23, 2022 
international community have rallied 
together to stand up to Putin with a 
unified front. It is stunning, therefore, 
that many of my Republican colleagues 
now seem intent upon suggesting that 
Russia invaded Ukraine because of 
something the Biden administration 
did or failed to do. 
There is no polite way to put this: 
This attempt to score political points 
by blaming the Biden administration 
for Putin’s invasion is unacceptable 
and inappropriate. 
I think it is important to remind my 
colleagues of some important facts 
they are ignoring. 
To be clear, the Biden administration 
has done more than any previous ad-
ministration when it comes to support 
for Ukraine. In the roughly 14 months 
since taking office, the administration 
has provided more than $2 billion in se-
curity assistance to Ukraine, including 
weapons like Stingers and Javelins 
that are proving so effective today. 
This is far more than any previous ad-
ministration, and I applaud those 17 
Republican Senators who voted for this 
military and humanitarian aid for 
Ukraine. 
Further, since last fall, the Biden ad-
ministration has worked tirelessly to 
build a coalition of nations committed 
to supporting Ukraine. So when the 
time came to stand up to Putin’s ille-
gal invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 
the United States stood with more 
than 30 countries from across the globe 
to condemn the violence, to execute 
the largest sanctions and export con-
trols in history, and to support the 
Ukrainian people by surging humani-
tarian and security aid into the coun-
try. This overwhelming international 
response would not have happened 
without President Biden’s leadership. 
We also should not forget a major 
reason 
Vladimir 
Putin 
felt 
so 
emboldened to invade Ukraine and 
challenge NATO. For 4 years, President 
Trump treated our allies like adver-
saries and pandered to dictators and 
despots—especially Putin. Mr. Trump’s 
animosity toward NATO created lin-
gering doubt about the United States’ 
reliability and the cohesion of the alli-
ance, jeopardizing our greatest advan-
tage against Russia. 
The Trump administration’s failure 
to hold Russia accountable for numer-
ous violations of international norms 
served only to embolden Putin in chal-
lenging U.S. leadership and the rules- 
based international order. 
Most disturbing, of course, was the 
offense that led to Mr. Trump’s first 
impeachment: his efforts to extort 
Ukraine’s security for political favors 
at home. That an American President 
would abuse his office to pressure a for-
eign government to interfere in our de-
mocracy as part of a reelection bid re-
mains deeply troubling. 
Mr. Trump’s actions damaged NATO, 
weakened Ukraine, and ceded political 
leverage to Putin. Now, the Ukrainian 
people are paying the price. Fortu-
nately, at this critical time, the United 
States and our allies are no longer 
hamstrung by Mr. Trump’s erratic 
leadership—a fact Vladimir Putin must 
understand very well at this stage. 
If Putin thought his actions over the 
past month would drive a wedge be-
tween NATO members and within the 
international community, he has found 
himself badly mistaken. Led by Presi-
dent Biden, the international commu-
nity has united in a way not seen in 
generations, and Russia is already 
straining under the immense costs we 
have levied against it and the coura-
geous actions of the Ukrainian people. 
With that in mind, I would like to 
take a few moments to correct the 
record on a few debates about our on-
going support for Ukraine. 
First, on the issue of arms transfers, 
the United States has led the inter-
national effort to identify capabilities 
the Ukrainian military can put to im-
mediate use, and I think we have to 
emphasize ‘‘immediate use.’’ Transfer-
ring equipment that cannot be used ef-
fectively because of the combat condi-
tions in the area or because we need to 
train or refit the equipment is not 
going to give the Ukrainian forces im-
mediate assistance, and that is the 
kind of assistance they need. 
In fact, over the past few months, the 
State Department has worked with in-
credible speed to facilitate the transfer 
of U.S.-origin equipment from partner 
nations to Ukraine. However, all of 
these transports, whether it be former 
Soviet-era 
air 
defense 
systems 
or 
former Soviet aircraft, occur on a bi-
lateral basis, and ultimately, it is a de-
cision for each partner nation to make 
within their own internal channels. 
With regard to a no-fly zone, the 
United States has enjoyed air superi-
ority for the past 20 years of conflict in 
Iraq and Afghanistan, so it is, perhaps, 
understandable that some of my col-
leagues think such endeavors are easily 
achieved and without risk. However, 
establishing and enforcing a no-fly 
zone against a near-peer competitor 
like Russia is far more complex. To do 
so would almost certainly drag the 
United States and the entire NATO al-
liance into a direct armed conflict with 
Russia. It would also put the women 
and men tasked with flying such mis-
sions at great risk. President Biden has 
rightly said that the United States will 
not seek direct conflict with Russia, 
and establishing a no-fly zone would al-
most certainly defy that aim. 
So, to my colleagues both on this 
side of the aisle and on the other side 
of the aisle, enough with trying to 
blame the Biden administration at 
every step in this conflict. This crisis 
demands unity and strength, and I call 
upon my colleagues, particularly my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, to join me in condemning the one 
person who bears responsibility for the 
horrific violence against the people of 
Ukraine: Vladimir Putin. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am 
here today with my great friend, the 
senior Senator from Missouri, to talk 
about an issue we both care passion-
ately about and that we have partnered 
on now for a number of years. 
I ask unanimous consent to proceed 
in a colloquy with Senator BLUNT. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
EXCELLENCE IN MENTAL HEALTH ACT 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, on 
October 31, 2013, Senator BLUNT and I 
stood here on the Senate floor to mark 
a very important anniversary. It was 50 
years to the day after President Ken-
nedy signed into law the Community 
Mental Health Act. It was the last 
piece of legislation he was ever able to 
sign. 
As we know, his life was tragically 
cut short, and one important part of 
his life’s work, that of providing full 
funding 
for 
comprehensive 
mental 
health services in the community, 
never came to happen. Instead, behav-
ioral health is funded far too often 
through grants, and while these grants 
are important, they are just not 
enough. 
You would never say to somebody 
who 
needed 
heart 
bypass 
surgery, 
‘‘Yep, you need surgery, but so sorry; 
the grant ran out,’’ which is what hap-
pens to someone with a mental health 
crisis or an addiction all the time. You 
wouldn’t say to somebody with bipolar 
disorder or substance abuse—well, we 
actually would say, ‘‘So sorry; the 
grant ran out,’’ and we should not be 
saying that. 
Why should healthcare above the 
neck 
be 
funded 
differently 
than 
healthcare below the neck? 
This 
is 
something 
that 
Senator 
BLUNT and I started to work on. We 
know that that should not be true. 
Healthcare is healthcare. President 
Kennedy understood this, and so does 
my friend Senator BLUNT. 
Right, Senator BLUNT? 
Mr. BLUNT. Exactly. 
I am so glad to be here with you, 
Senator 
STABENOW. 
We 
have 
been 
friends for a long time and have 
worked together on a number of issues 
both in the House, to which we came at 
the same time, and in the Senate, when 
I got to the Senate. 
Clearly, this is one of the things of 
which, I think, we both have a strong 
sense that we have really made a dif-
ference in not only how we look at 
mental health but in also the way we 
talk about mental health. 
To Senator STABENOW’s point of 
treating mental health like all other 
health and ‘‘what happens when you do 
that?’’ we got an award last month 
when I was home and Senator STABE-
NOW was virtually in Jefferson City, 
MO, for a few minutes with the Mis-
souri Behavioral Health Council, and 
we received the Excellence in Mental 
Health award. Brent McGinty, the head 
of that council, gave a talk about what 
they were doing and what they were 
seeing from what they were doing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1738 
March 23, 2022 
Also, we talked about the partnership 
with community health centers, an-
other thing we have worked together 
on. 
Joe Pierle and Brent McGinty are ac-
tually both here today, coincidentally, 
as we are talking about this issue that 
is so important to both of them. 
I have often thought about the same 
type of discussion we had in 2013 as 
Senator STABENOW just pointed out. We 
went through the Community Mental 
Health Act from 1963, and it became ap-
parent that many of the things that 
probably should have been closed but 
were serving a need, did get closed, but 
then the support system didn’t come 
in, in the way that anybody would have 
envisioned when that came together. I 
can remember it in Missouri when 
some of our mental health facilities or 
hospitals were closed, and that was a 
fine thing if you had what the bill that 
President Kennedy signed had in mind 
and, I think, what we have had in 
mind. 
One of the things we have looked at 
is—we have looked at 41 States now 
that have some efforts, some unit, of 
excellence in mental health—the Cer-
tified Community Behavioral Health 
Centers—in their States. Maybe it is a 
big county. Maybe it is a city that was 
able to qualify with the 365-days-a- 
year, 24/7 standards and with the kind 
of staff available that you have to have 
to meet that criteria first. We now 
have eight States, including Michigan 
and Missouri, in this process. 
One of the things that is happening 
in all of those units is keeping track of 
the person’s other healthcare chal-
lenges when you are dealing with their 
mental healthcare challenges. The NIH 
says about one in five adult Americans 
has a diagnosable and almost always 
treatable behavioral health issue, and 
one in five adult Americans probably 
has other health issues as well. In fact, 
obviously, they would have. 
One of the things we have been try-
ing to keep track of is what happens in 
the real, confined healthcare world 
when you deal with people’s mental 
health problems like they were any 
other health problems. Do they start 
showing up at appointments more fre-
quently? Do they take the medicine 
that they are supposed to take for ei-
ther behavioral health issues or other 
health issues? Are they eating better 
or sleeping better or feeling better 
about themselves? I think it is pretty 
clear and totally logical that that 
would be exactly what happens. 
Another thing we have seen, after the 
50 years of whatever happened in men-
tal health between October 1963 and the 
day we were on the floor in 2013, is 
that, in so many ways, the police de-
partment, law enforcement, and the 
emergency room became the de facto 
mental health system for the country. 
We have had people come and be part 
of the press conferences with us, Sen-
ator STABENOW, when we are talking 
about fewer people being taken to the 
emergency rooms and the importance 
of having a contact that you can make 
or have, maybe, a place that is not 
only a place to spend the night but also 
a place for you and your family so you 
know that you are going to have an on-
going opportunity to have a relation-
ship to deal with your mental health 
problem just like you would if you had 
to be taken to the hospital with other 
problems. 
We have seen some things there, Sen-
ator STABENOW, that you may want to 
talk about a little bit—everything 
from the iPad that law enforcement of-
ficers and the crisis intervention team 
uses in Springfield, MO, and other 
places in our State to where they can 
immediately link the person they are 
dealing with up on the screen on the 
iPad with the behavioral health coun-
selor who is there any time of the 
day—fully manned, 24/7—and see what 
begins to happen when a professional is 
dealing with a person in crisis. 
I have seen that happen, and I am 
sure I was there with, probably, the 
best crisis intervention center person 
the police department had. You can 
tell the difference when they start 
looking at that screen and talking to 
somebody who is always a behavioral 
health specialist but also who is just a 
little bit removed and is totally pre-
pared to enter into that discussion. We 
have had lots of people talk about the 
impact on departments and emergency 
rooms, Senator STABENOW. 
Ms. STABENOW. Senator BLUNT, I 
couldn’t agree with you more. 
I don’t know about you, but when we 
first started and knew this was going 
to be a step-by-step process, we weren’t 
able to go nationwide. We had to prove 
the concept would work with, really, 
providing comprehensive services, not 
just what is done in most States, like 
in Michigan, where there was Medicaid 
funding for people who were seriously 
mentally ill, but if you weren’t seri-
ously mentally ill, there was no sup-
port for anybody else. 
So doing a concept like federally 
qualified health centers, which I have 
been so proud to be your partner on— 
where you say, ‘‘OK. If you meet high 
standards, we will fully fund your ca-
pacity then to provide services if you 
meet high standards’’—is what the 
whole point is. After only 2 years of 
doing that with the eight States’ dem-
onstration project, I was really blown 
away, and I think you were, too, in 
that, after only 2 years, the kind of re-
sults that they were able to get were so 
meaningful. HHS—by the way, both 
Democratic and Republican Presidents 
have embraced this and supported this, 
which has been wonderful. But, after 
only 2 years, they found 63 percent 
fewer emergency room visits. 
I remember being in one of the press 
conferences we did with a police chief 
from Oklahoma, who was talking about 
how it was so difficult if they had 
someone who needed care. They would 
drive hours and go sit in the emergency 
room with them, and an officer would 
be off of their regular duties all day, 
sitting with somebody in the emer-
gency room. 
So, with a 63-percent reduction in the 
number of folks sitting in the emer-
gency room because they couldn’t get 
help and then to have a 60-percent re-
duction in the amount of time in jail, 
I am not surprised that sheriffs and po-
lice chiefs and law enforcement offi-
cials across the country are our biggest 
supporters in terms of having com-
prehensive 
community 
behavioral 
health clinics. They want people to get 
help. They don’t want them going to 
jail, just sitting in jail. 
The other thing that was so impor-
tant, I thought, was that there was 
about a 41-percent decrease in home-
lessness. Oftentimes, with the iPad 
that you are talking about, there may 
be someone on the ground, on the 
street, and an officer will be asked to 
respond. The fact that they can put 
someone—a social worker or a psychol-
ogist or someone—on the iPad, on 
FaceTime, basically, to talk to some-
one and get an initial diagnosis of what 
is going on, what kind of help they 
need, where they should go, and so on 
has been so effective and I know, for 
law enforcement, such a relief in that 
they have tools that they can use, and 
we are seeing that over and over again. 
One of the things we require, of 
course, is to be able to get this full 
funding as healthcare so that you have 
a 24-hour psychiatric crisis operation, 
which I think has been one of the most 
important pieces of it. 
I don’t know about you, but the re-
sults, to me, have been amazing, and 
we now have 10 States in the dem-
onstration projects, and we are ready 
to offer this opportunity to States 
across the country. 
Mr. BLUNT. Well, we are. 
As to what you were talking about 
with getting people into the healthcare 
system instead of the criminal justice 
system, it is, obviously, one of the 
goals we should have. 
Missouri’s really got started in Janu-
ary 2017, and in the first 4 years in 
these certified centers, they served 
more than 150,000 Missourians and 
more than 3,500 veterans. That was a 
41-percent increase over the 4 years of 
not being in the program to being in 
the program. Not only is it able to 
serve people, but because of the way 
this is set up, you are able to serve peo-
ple so much more quickly. You are able 
to have the staff that you can have be-
cause you know you have got the fund-
ing you need to have the staff—largely, 
this is an increase of the Medicaid cov-
erage, but the other Medicaid costs go 
down more than the behavioral health 
costs add to the system. 
We have always known that this was 
the right thing to do—right thing to do 
in the long run, right thing to do for 
police officers, right thing to do for the 
emergency room, right thing to do for 
the prison system, right thing to do for 
the people being at work. 
I think what we are showing here is, 
not only is it the right thing to do and

saves money over time, but it is the 
right thing to do and largely pays for 
itself and maybe more than pays for 
itself within the immediate context of 
healthcare; and that is one of the 
things we are looking at. 
What we saw in the last 2 years with 
COVID was the real crisis that became 
part of that healthcare crisis with a 
mental health crisis, of isolation, of 
people who developed some kind of de-
pendency. If you don’t have a mental 
health problem before you become de-
pendent on opioids or something else, 
you have one as soon as you become de-
pendent on those. The suicide numbers 
went up. 
Having a structure in place ready to 
reach out and man the suicide hotline 
to get people to where they need to 
get—there is no waiting list for some-
body who is thinking about doing harm 
to themselves or others. We need to 
have a society where we understand 
that is an immediate problem; it has to 
be dealt with immediately; and it is a 
societal—not only a societal goal, but, 
actually, it should be one of our pri-
mary responsibilities in this society. 
And I think that is what we are seeing 
here over and over again, Senator STA-
BENOW. 
Ms. STABENOW. I agree. 
You know, when I think about 
COVID and all the increased stress on 
children and young people and, as you 
said, the increase in number of sui-
cides—all the pressure is on everyone, 
from those on the frontlines who are 
taking care of patients in the hospitals 
and the stress of families and so on. 
We know that it is even more impor-
tant that we eliminate the stigma of 
what it means to ask for help—mental 
health help—or if you have an addic-
tion to be able to ask for help. 
It is not enough just to eliminate the 
stigma; you have to have the service. 
You have to have the service in the 
community. It has to be quality serv-
ices. It has to be funded in a structural 
way where you are supporting the staff 
and, again, modeling this after commu-
nity health centers, which are widely 
supported—every community in the 
country, strong bipartisan support. 
By our picking up that model and ba-
sically saying, We need to do that for 
mental health and addiction as well as 
physical health, we are just extending 
something that has shown such success 
in the community. And now, because of 
what has happened and all the pres-
sures of COVID and so on, it is even 
more important that folks who need 
help can be able to get that. 
You know I think of someone who 
has struggled with addiction their 
whole life and they finally get the 
courage up; they are going to ask for 
help. The ability to walk into a clinic 
and say, ‘‘I need help’’ and to have 
somebody say, ‘‘Come on in’’—— 
Mr. BLUNT. I think in almost—in all 
of the States, once they get this fully 
running the way they hope it will, that 
everybody who needs to be seen the 
first day is seen the first day. 
Ms. STABENOW. Right. 
Mr. BLUNT. There may be an occa-
sional evaluation where you talk to 
somebody and realize this is something 
that you don’t have to put at the very 
front of that day’s line; but if you need 
to be at the front of the line, you get to 
go to the front of the line. If you need 
to be seen the first day, you get to be 
seen the first day. No more 7-day wait-
ing period for a crisis moment. 
Ms. STABENOW. Right. 
Mr. BLUNT. People still may have to 
occasionally wait and come back to-
morrow or come back Wednesday or 
whatever the schedule might be—and I 
think that is critically important. 
Now, Senator STABENOW, what you 
and I are trying to do is to further ex-
pand the opportunity. You know, the 
President said in his State of the Union 
message: 
Let’s get all Americans the mental health 
services they need. 
That is a quote: ‘‘Let’s get all Ameri-
cans the mental health services they 
need.’’ That was a goal in the Presi-
dent’s State of the Union message; it 
should be a significant goal for the 
country. 
What we would like to see happen in 
this Congress is the expansion of excel-
lence in mental health to every State 
that wants to do it. Initially, we had 24 
States apply to be part of the 8 pilot 
States. Nineteen of them went all the 
way through that entire process. 
You know, all 50 States may not 
apply, but we would like to create an 
environment where all 50 States could 
apply. 
Frankly, every time we get a score 
on this bill, the score is a little lower 
than it was before because I think the 
facts are beginning to persuade even 
the Congressional Budget Office that 
this makes economic sense to do. And 
there may be some startup costs, but 
the long-term costs may be actually 
long-term savings. If you do the right 
thing and save money while you are 
doing it, Mr. President, that is a pretty 
good place to be in for a society or a 
government or a country; and that is 
what we are trying to get done, Sen-
ator STABENOW, in this Congress. 
Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. 
And we invite all of our colleagues to 
join us. We have a great bipartisan ef-
fort going on with our Excellence in 
Mental Health and Addiction Treat-
ment legislation of 2021 that would 
open the door for all States. We know 
that many, many States and certainly 
local communities are very interested. 
We can do this. We can actually get 
this done. 
When I heard the President speaking 
about this, I know I had a big smile on 
my face—and I think you as well, Sen-
ator BLUNT. We were like, All right, 
this is the next step. 
Mr. BLUNT. Right. Right. 
Ms. STABENOW. I am so excited to 
see the President agreeing with this 
and speaking about it in his State of 
the Union. I am looking forward to his 
including this in his budget, which will 
be coming out very soon, and his sup-
porting and embracing a nationwide 
program. 
I am just so very, very pleased that 
this is a model that, frankly, has sur-
vived both Democratic and Republican 
Presidents, 
Republicans, 
Democrats, 
House Members, Senate Members, local 
communities, Governors because it 
works. Everybody is looking at this. 
Everybody is looking at this. 
Mr. BLUNT. You can have a commu-
nity behavioral health center working 
with a primary care center or you 
could have an independent provider 
working with their other healthcare 
provider or vice versa. It is very inter-
changeable. 
The one criteria for the certified 
community behavioral health centers 
is the level of staffing—24/7, 365 days a 
year, always available to be that criti-
cally important partner that people 
with a mental health challenge need. 
And, frankly, their families and people 
who care about them need it as well. 
Ms. STABENOW. Yes. 
Mr. BLUNT. This is a big challenge 
for the individual that has a behavioral 
health problem, but it can be an equal-
ly big challenge for people who care 
about them. 
Ms. STABENOW. It really is about 
families. 
So, Mr. President, I just want to 
close by saying I am so grateful for the 
partnership that Senator BLUNT and I 
have had. He thinks he is retiring at 
the end of the year. I am actually 
going to put him in a closet and not let 
him leave because he has been such a 
champion both in his role on appropria-
tions as well as partnering for long- 
term funding. This is important; this is 
something real and tangible and mean-
ingful that we can all do together; and 
I am excited and hopeful we are going 
to take the next step this year to-
gether. 
Mr. BLUNT. We are, too. 
Mr. President, we look forward to 
you joining us in this effort. 
Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. Thank 
you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
USICA 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we have 
begun the long-awaited process of mov-
ing forward on legislation that will bol-
ster our domestic semiconductor man-
ufacturing and confront the growing 
threats posed by China. 
This legislation has had many dif-
ferent names over the last year or so. 
We started with the Endless Frontier 
Act in the Senate. Then, miraculously, 
it became the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act, affectionately known 
as USICA. And then it became the 
Make it in America Act. But now it has 
a new name, the Bipartisan Innovation 
Act. 
Well, regardless of what you call it, 
it is absolutely critical that we get a 
strong version of this legislation to the 
President’s desk as soon as we can. The 
Senate passed the original legislation

S1740 
March 23, 2022 
last summer with significant bipar-
tisan support. We urged our colleagues 
in the House to treat this legislation 
with the sense of urgency that it de-
served, but they wasted months with 
no action. To be charitable, I guess 
they were preoccupied with other mat-
ters. 
But it wasn’t until last month, just 
ahead of the President’s State of the 
Union, that they finally leapt into ac-
tion. The President, of course, wanted 
to talk about this legislation in his 
speech. So House Democrats had to 
cobble together a bill in short order. 
Unfortunately, it was a highly partisan 
one. Their bill passed almost entirely 
along party lines, and now, the two 
Chambers—the House and the Senate— 
have a critical task ahead of us to rec-
oncile those two versions. We need to 
begin the formal conference committee 
process, dive into negotiations, and get 
that strong bill to the President’s desk. 
The cornerstone of this effort, as far 
as I am concerned, is bolstering our do-
mestic semiconductor manufacturing. 
Even more concerning is that 92 per-
cent of the world’s most advanced 
semiconductors come from one place, 
and that is Asia. Sixty-three percent 
come from Taiwan alone. If that supply 
chain were cut off, it would lead to 
very serious consequences. And, unfor-
tunately, that potential is not just a 
doomsday scenario that is farfetched 
by any means. 
A few months ago, I led a congres-
sional delegation to Asia to learn more 
about the need to confront China in a 
variety of ways in that region. One of 
the leaders we met with was the head 
of the Indo-Pacific Command, the re-
gional command that covers that part 
of the globe, and he described the cur-
rent power dynamic rather succinctly. 
He said it is not a question of if China 
invades Taiwan but when. 
Well, we have one rough idea of when 
that could potentially happen. Presi-
dent Xi Jinping himself said he wants 
to be ready to unify the People’s Re-
public of China with Taiwan by 2027, 
just 5 years from now. But, truth be 
told, we don’t have any idea when 
President Xi will call that play. We 
won’t have any more notice for that 
than we did for Putin’s invading 
Ukraine. 
It is tough to overestimate the im-
pact this would have on the United 
States and our allies. And, even absent 
some military action by the People’s 
Republic of China seeking to swallow 
up and absorb Taiwan with its manu-
facturing capacity for the semiconduc-
tors, if we had another pandemic, if we 
had another natural disaster, any one 
of those three things could disrupt that 
critical supply chain, much to our det-
riment and that of the rest the world. 
We learned one thing in COVID–19, 
and that is that these supply chains are 
very vulnerable. I still remember the 
first call I had with my Governor when 
COVID broke out, and I said: Well, 
what do you need? What can we do to 
help? 
He said: I need two things. I need 
testing, and I need PPE, personal pro-
tective equipment. 
Those are gowns and masks used by 
healthcare professionals and others to 
protect themselves when treating peo-
ple with COVID–19, and the fact of the 
matter is, almost all of it is made in 
China. 
This notion of globalization of the 
economy has led us to believe that the 
only thing to think about when it 
comes to manufacturing a product is 
where can it be made the cheapest, but, 
obviously, there is more at stake than 
just who can make it the cheapest. We 
learned that in COVID–19—thus the 
need to bolster our critical supply 
chains across a whole range of prod-
ucts, including semiconductors. 
Semiconductors are something that 
most of us don’t know a lot about. I 
have had to learn a lot myself about it, 
and I still don’t consider myself an ex-
pert. But I asked my staff: Please tell 
me; how important is this? 
And they said: Well, Senator, every-
thing with an off-and-on switch in-
volves semiconductors. 
And if you think about how techno-
logical our lives are and how much we 
depend on everything from the sensors 
in our car to the backup camera when 
we back our car out of a parking place, 
to the laptop computers that our kids 
were using during COVID–19 to study 
virtually—and then there is farming 
equipment, 
communications 
equip-
ment, and medical equipment—all of 
these rely on semiconductors. And 90 
percent of them come from one region 
of the world, and that is Asia. 
The shortages we have experienced 
recently would seem insignificant com-
pared to the complete chaos that would 
ensue if this supply chain were dis-
rupted. This gets downright dangerous 
when you think about how a global 
chip shortage would impact our na-
tional security and, more broadly, 
global security. 
Russia’s 
attack 
and 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine is a wake-up call for the 
United States and our allies to exam-
ine our defense posture across the plan-
et. One of the bright spots of this, if 
you can call it that, is that countries 
in Europe, including countries like 
Germany that were reluctant to con-
tribute 2 percent of their gross domes-
tic product to the joint collective de-
fense effort of NATO, have turned 
around and stepped up. That is a wel-
comed development. But the fact of the 
matter is, our military and our na-
tional security depend on access to 
these semiconductors because, increas-
ingly, our military depends on tech-
nology to perform their mission. 
One 
advantage 
that 
the 
United 
States has typically had against our 
adversaries around the world is our ad-
vanced technology and our capacity to 
innovate and to solve problems using 
that technology. But here is the bot-
tom line: That technology cannot func-
tion without semiconductors. It is that 
simple, whether you are talking about 
advanced fighters like the fifth-genera-
tion fighter, the F–35, or you are talk-
ing about missile defense systems like 
Iron Dome, which was used by Israel to 
defeat the rockets that were raining in 
on it in recent months. A single inter-
ceptor used by the Iron Dome missile 
defense system—rocket defense sys-
tem—contains more than 750 semi-
conductors, just a single one. 
So semiconductors are our key to 
confront threats by any adversary, not 
just China, and are essential to our 
economy here in the United States. 
Earlier this week, two national secu-
rity and foreign policy experts at the 
University of Texas wrote an op-ed 
piece in The Hill magazine—or news-
paper—and they made the national se-
curity case for CHIPS funding. They 
noted this is not the first time that 
semiconductor supply chains were re-
garded as a matter of national secu-
rity. Back in the 1980s, President 
Reagan pushed to maintain our com-
petitive edge in these chips, thereby 
helping us lead in the advanced weap-
ons and aircraft that they enabled. 
As they said, Reagan didn’t just out-
spend the Soviets; we also out-inno-
vated the Soviets, winning that arms 
race. And that is what we need to do 
again today. We can’t just rely on our 
ability to spend more than Russia or 
China or any other adversary. We need 
to out-innovate them as well. 
Considering the fact that China is 
the No. 1 master thief of intellectual 
property, it is all that much more im-
portant. Now, there are some critics of 
the CHIPS Program that has been in-
troduced by the Senator from Virginia 
Mr. WARNER and myself. Both of us 
serve on the Senate Select Committee 
on Intelligence. It is one reason why, 
because of the briefings we get, this be-
came a matter of grave concern to both 
of us. But the good news is that con-
cern is shared by a broad bipartisan 
majority in the Senate. There are 
some, though, who said that this ini-
tiative is just a bailout for domestic 
energy. But that is not the case at all. 
This is not a handout. It is, frankly, 
one of the tools we have to reshore—to 
bring 
back 
onshore—this 
essential 
manufacturing capacity, as well as 
incentivize domestic industry to build 
out our capacity here at home. 
Here are the numbers. Over the last 
three decades, the United States has 
gone from producing 37 percent of the 
global chip supply to just 12 percent 
today—12 percent here in America. The 
rest of it is in Asia and in other places 
around the world. Now, that is a big 
flashing red light when it comes to our 
national security. 
Without some Federal incentives, 
companies cannot afford to invest the 
enormous amount of time and capital 
needed to stand up new chip fabs or ex-
pand existing ones, and that is because 
it costs about 30 percent more to build 
these fabs here in America than it does 
overseas. 
But, again, going to the low-cost pro-
ducer is not the only consideration

when it comes to these vulnerable sup-
ply chains that are so important to our 
economy and our national security. 
That is why it is absolutely critical for 
us to bring this semiconductor manu-
facturing back home, and full funding 
for the CHIPS Program is the best way 
for us to see results. 
We began to establish this program 
more than a year ago in the National 
Defense Authorization Act, and the 
only thing missing now is—well, you 
guessed it. It is money. We need the ap-
propriations in order to fund this 
CHIPS Program that we began to em-
brace over a year ago in the National 
Defense Authorization Act. 
That is why it is absolutely critical 
that we begin the conference com-
mittee process for the U.S. Innovation 
and Competition Act or whatever it is 
called today. I will have to refresh my 
memory—the 
Bipartisan 
Innovation 
Act—since it has had so many different 
names. But we need to get this done, 
and we need to get this done now, and 
we need to get it done right. 
Now, I expect the final bipartisan 
conference committee report to look a 
whole lot like the Senate version. That 
is because, as I mentioned a moment 
ago, the House decided to take the low 
road and pass purely a partisan bill. 
The Senate bill was the product of in-
tense bipartisan negotiations and rep-
resented a good-faith compromise by 
all sides. 
I think that is the best place for us to 
begin once the formal conference com-
mittee process is underway. I hope we 
can work quickly to reach a final 
agreement and one that will serve the 
interests of the American people, our 
economy, and, most importantly, our 
national security. 
I urge all of our colleagues to wade 
into this process so we can begin that 
conference committee and reach a bi-
partisan resolution promptly. 
This is not a time for us to dawdle or 
to play politics. It is a time for us to 
get the strongest possible bill we can 
to the President’s desk, and that be-
gins with passing this appropriations 
portion of this bill to bring that manu-
facturing capacity back to America. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NORTH PLATTE CANTEEN CONGRESSIONAL GOLD 
MEDAL ACT 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I 
would like to tell you a story about 
North Platte, NE. 
During World War II, this small, 
West Central Nebraska town was one of 
the most famous cities in America, and 
it was the epitome of homefront patri-
otism. From Christmas Day 1941 to 
April 1946, North Platte was the site of 
one of the many community-based can-
teens that offered hospitality to sol-
diers on their way to join the fight or 
on their way back home. 
There were nearly 120 of these can-
teens across the United States, mostly 
along railways, like the Union Pacific 
line that still runs through Nebraska. 
Of these 120 canteens, North Platte was 
by far the biggest. It served more than 
6 million servicemembers over the 41⁄2 
years it was open. The country’s sec-
ond busiest canteen in Ohio served well 
under half that many soldiers over its 
lifetime. 
As many as 24 different troop trains, 
carrying up to 8,000 uniformed per-
sonnel overall, rolled through North 
Platte on any given day. 
Here is a quote from a local news-
paper about what the residents of just 
two 
Nebraska 
towns, 
Merna 
and 
Anselmo, donated to the North Platte 
Canteen on a single day in 1944: 53 
birthdays cakes, 127 fried chickens, 58 
dozen homemade cookies, 32 dozen cup-
cakes, 73 pounds of coffee, 163 dozen 
eggs, 68 dozen doughnuts, 41 quarts of 
pickles, 3 crates of oranges, 9 pounds of 
ham, 160 loaves of bread, 40 popcorn 
balls, and 50 pounds of sandwich meat. 
It took 22 cars and 3 pickup trucks to 
drive all those donations 70 miles west 
to the train station in North Platte. 
Members of the community organized 
regular benefit dances, scrap metal 
drives, and other events to support the 
canteen’s operations. In all, volunteers 
raised more than $137,000—worth more 
than $2 million today—to support the 
canteen, and they did it all on their 
own. 
As you might imagine, the soldiers 
who were fortunate enough to stop at 
the North Platte Canteen didn’t soon 
forget the hospitality that they re-
ceived. 
Russ Fay, a Wisconsinite who was 
barely old enough to be drafted when 
he was shipped off to basic training in 
California, was one of those lucky sol-
diers. More than 60 years after his 10- 
minute stop in North Platte, he told 
journalist Bob Greene, who wrote a 
book about the North Platte Canteen 
called ‘‘Once Upon a Tow’’: 
I can still taste it. I would say that a ma-
jority of the men on the battlefield know ex-
actly what North Platte was. . . . They 
would talk about it like it was a dream. Out 
of nowhere, [other soldiers would say]: How’d 
you like to have some of that food from the 
North Platte Canteen right about now? 
The thought of the North Platte Can-
teen kept our soldiers going during one 
of the darkest periods in world history. 
And more than 55,000 people, nearly all 
of them women from 125 different com-
munities, chipped in to help run it at 
one point or another. Most were Ne-
braskans, but many were from our 
neighboring States of Colorado and 
Kansas. 
One of those Nebraska women was 
my mother, Florence Strobel. She 
moved from Lincoln to teach kinder-
garten in North Platte in the fall of 
1944, and she was proud to be among 
the volunteers at the canteen. 
To honor everyone who helped give 
our soldiers a good memory to hold 
onto while they were away from home, 
I recently introduced the North Platte 
Canteen Congressional Gold Medal Act. 
This bill would award a collective 
Congressional Gold Medal to all of the 
individuals and communities that vol-
unteered or donated food and other 
items to the North Platte Canteen. 
This is the highest honor Congress can 
give civilians, and the tens of thou-
sands of people who made America’s 
busiest World War II canteen a success 
are certainly deserving of it. 
Under my bill, after the Treasury De-
partment strikes this Congressional 
Gold Medal, it would be on display at 
the Lincoln County Historical Museum 
in North Platte, which has an out-
standing exhibit about the canteen. 
This wouldn’t be the first time that 
Congress has given the volunteers at 
the North Platte Canteen the recogni-
tion they deserve. Almost 20 years ago, 
the 108th Congress acknowledged their 
efforts with a resolution introduced by 
Nebraska Representative Tom Osborne. 
I hope the 117th Congress will do so, as 
well, by passing this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
REMEMBERING MADELEINE ALBRIGHT 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, today 
we lost a towering figure in American 
and world history. Madeleine Albright 
was one of the smartest, strongest dip-
lomats that we have ever had. She 
came to America as a refugee and 
helped move the country closer to the 
promise that it was founded upon. She 
made the world a better place. 
Madeleine Albright was born in the 
former Czechoslovakia in 1937. When 
the Nazis took power, her family was 
forced into exile, ending up in London, 
where they survived the Blitz. After 
World War II, they returned to Czecho-
slovakia but were again forced to seek 
refuge, this time from communism. 
As an 11-year-old, she arrived with 
her family at Ellis Island. She became 
a U.S. citizen, graduated college on a 
full scholarship, and went on to earn a 
Ph.D. while raising her three daugh-
ters, Alice, Katie, and Anne. 
She worked here in the U.S. Senate 
on the Foreign Relations Committee 
under Edmund Muskie, then at the 
White House National Security Coun-
cil, before becoming a renowned pro-
fessor at Georgetown University. In 
1993, President Clinton nominated her 
as U.S. Ambassador to the United Na-
tions. She was the second woman to 
hold that position. 
In 1997, she became the first woman 
in our Nation’s history to serve as a

Secretary of State. As Secretary, she 
was a strong supporter of NATO, en-
couraging the alliance to add new 
members and to protect vulnerable 
populations. She urged military inter-
vention to save lives in Kosovo. She 
worked to prevent rogue States from 
getting nuclear material and supported 
the Kyoto Protocol. And she strength-
ened American alliances across the 
planet. 
But Madeleine Albright is not the 
sum of her accomplishments. Mad-
eleine Albright is something more. She 
embodied the ideals of our country. 
She was a constant light in the strug-
gle between freedom and oppression, 
relentlessly advocating for people to 
have rights that she knew didn’t exist 
under 
authoritarian 
regimes. 
She 
broke the highest glass ceiling in her 
field and then spent the rest of her ca-
reer fighting for opportunities for 
other women. We will remember her as 
a diplomat and a trailblazer. 
But I will also remember her as 
something else: family. My oldest 
brother Jake is married to her daugh-
ter, Katie. When I first became a U.S. 
Senator, she was thrilled to have a pol-
itician in the family and wanted to be 
helpful without casting a long shadow, 
so she discreetly called Barbara Mikul-
ski and told her to look out for me. 
We were fast friends—not acquaint-
ances, not friends in the political 
sense, but actual friends. 
She was a tireless and sharp political 
strategist. She was the kind of person 
who would watch C–SPAN for fun and 
was endlessly fascinated with politics 
at all levels, from municipal elections, 
State elections, Hawaiian politics, the 
United Nations—she loved this stuff. 
She was also a trusted confidante. We 
had long talks about everything but 
mostly about our two shared loves: 
family and politics. And it was always 
over a meal, which she would occasion-
ally let me pay for. 
But most of all, I will remember her 
as Grandma Maddie, someone who was 
kind and curious with my kids. She 
was one of the most decent human 
beings whom I have ever known. May 
her memory be a blessing. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Alaska. 
REMEMBERING DON YOUNG 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
Senator SULLIVAN and I are here this 
afternoon on the Senate floor, and we 
are here with heavy hearts. We are 
joined in the Galleries by friends of 
Alaska because, last Friday, our Con-
gressman, Congressman Don Young— 
the Congressman for all Alaska and the 
dean of the House, who served our 49th 
State ably and faithfully for the last 49 
years—passed away as he was flying 
home to be with the people of Alaska. 
Seated next to his wife, Anne, he 
passed peacefully and left this world. 
There 
is 
no 
doubt—there 
is 
no 
doubt—that Congressman Young lived 
a large and full life. He was 88 years 
young, and we always referred to him 
as ‘‘young,’’ not old. He accomplished 
an incredible amount across the many 
decades that he served Alaska and 
served his country, but that doesn’t 
make the loss any less sudden or any 
less devastating, and it doesn’t change 
the fact that we are now left with a 
hole the size of Alaska in our congres-
sional delegation. 
We were a team. We were small but 
mighty. The Presiding Officer has 
heard me, on this floor, talk about the 
Last Great Race, the Iditarod, and that 
no dog team—no dog team—can make 
it without the leader. We all know 
that. You have got the swing dog, and 
you have got the wheel dog, and we 
have all kind of taken different points 
on that team, but it has always been 
with Don Young. 
I was home over the weekend. I spent 
the weekend there, reflecting on Don 
Young’s life and on his legacy. I had 
the chance to speak with his wife, 
Anne, over the phone. I talked with his 
daughters—Joni, whom we know well, 
and Dawn, her sister. I talked to a lot 
of friends who shared some stories 
about our Congressman. Many of those 
stories are probably not fit to print in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, but there 
was a lot of reliving of the life and 
times of Don Young. 
For those who didn’t have the privi-
lege of knowing Congressman Young, 
as so many Alaskans did, he was really 
all of the things that have been written 
about him and all of the things that 
have been said about him these past 
several days. He was all that, and he 
was more. He was larger than life. We 
keep saying that: ‘‘larger than life.’’ 
He was colorful—as colorful as they 
come. He could be tough; he could be 
gruff; he could be very feisty, but he 
was also warm, engaging. He was 
charming, but, most of all, he was pas-
sionate. He was a passionate man 
about Alaska and Alaskans—to his 
very core. And he was loyal. He was 
loyal and devoted to his family, to his 
friends, to his staff who served him, 
and was loyal to the people he loved so 
dearly. 
So we think about Don as forever 
being Alaska, but Don’s life didn’t 
begin in Alaska. He grew up in Cali-
fornia, working on his family farm. His 
father would read Jack London to him 
at night, and that inspired him, later 
on, to head north. He served in the 
Army with the 41st Tank Battalion. 
Then, after graduating from Chico 
State college, he answered ‘‘The Call of 
the Wild.’’ 
He eventually made his way north to 
the village of Fort Yukon, just above 
the Arctic Circle. He tried his hand at 
just about everything. He was into con-
struction. He was into mining. He 
taught at a BIA school in the winter. 
He was a tugboat captain in the spring 
and summer. He hunted. He fished. He 
trapped. He took well to Alaska, and 
Alaska took well to him. 
By then, Don had fallen in love with 
Alaska, and he was also head over heels 
for his first wife, Lu, who was a book-
keeper from a respected Gwich’in fam-
ily. They married in 1963. 
He was elected mayor of Fort Yukon 
the next year, but he didn’t spend 
much time as mayor. He moved on to 
the Alaska State House of Representa-
tives and then to our State senate, but 
where he would really make his mark 
was at the Federal level, as a Member 
of the House of Representatives, which 
he joined in 1973. 
Initially, it didn’t start out so well. 
He lost the election in 1972 to Nick 
Begich, only to win it in a special elec-
tion in March of 1973 after Congress-
man Begich went missing after an air-
plane accident. Once in office, Don 
Young never stopped winning for Alas-
ka. 
In his first year in office, Congress-
man Young helped to authorize the 
Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which has been 
the economic backbone of our State 
ever since. Not long after, his col-
leagues chose him as their Freshman 
Congressman of the Year. There are so 
many, many legislative accomplish-
ments over the course of the Congress-
man’s life—too many to list here—but 
I will just highlight a few. 
In addition to the pipeline authoriza-
tion, he helped to establish the 200-mile 
fishing limit and contributed to the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, which has al-
lowed Alaska to maintain its world- 
class fisheries. He wrote the National 
Wildlife Refuge System Improvement 
Act, which guides the use of millions of 
acres of those lands. Congressman 
Young passed legislation to open a 
small part of the non-wilderness 1002 
Area in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge, and he did this a dozen times 
before we steered it into law in 2017. 
Believe me, Congressman Young re-
minded me every time how many times 
he had actually gotten it across the 
finish line in the House, but Don never 
ever gave up. Given the way of the 
world now, his commitment to energy 
security should be more appreciated 
than ever. 
He enacted important measures as 
chairman of the Natural Resources 
Committee and a landmark transpor-
tation bill, SAFETEA–LU, as chairman 
of the Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture Committee. He was also a strong, 
strong champion for Alaska Natives 
and Native Americans. 
Don was pretty independent. He was 
independent in his thinking, and he 
was not afraid to vote his conscience to 
help Alaska. 
Just before he left Washington, DC, 
this past week, he was involved in the 
reauthorization 
of 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act and helped consid-
erably with the Tribal title in that act. 
I also credit him—seriously credit 
him—for garnering enough Republican 
votes in the House last year to ensure 
that the bipartisan infrastructure bill 
could finally move across the finish 
line. He knew that that measure was 
good for Alaska, and he said: Not only 
am I going to give my vote, but I am

March 23, 2022 
going to work to make sure that we 
have the votes over here to sign this 
into law. 
There are a lot of stories in this body 
about our former Senator, Senator Ste-
vens, being legendary and pretty tena-
cious in his pursuit of Federal dollars 
to help build Alaska, but just know 
that Congressman Young was right 
there, every step of the way, making 
sure that Alaskans received what we 
considered to be our fair share. 
On December 5 of 2017, Alaskans were 
just filled with pride for Congressman 
Young when he became the 45th dean of 
the House—its most senior Member. At 
the time, I gave him a little gift. It was 
a star designated in his name. You can 
actually get a certificate that says, 
‘‘This star up there is designated to 
you,’’ but it was given as a sentiment, 
reflecting his stature as the North Star 
of our delegation and our northern 
State. 
When you think about this remark-
able journey that Don Young had— 
from teaching fifth graders in Alaska, 
to running dog teams, to guiding 
barges along the Yukon River, to be-
coming the longest serving Republican 
Member of Congress of all time—of all 
time—and being the most senior Mem-
ber of the House of Representatives—of 
all that Congressman Young accom-
plished and of all that he did for Alas-
ka, you have to know that this was no 
easy task. This was no easy task. For 
49 years, he stood alone in the House of 
Representatives as the sole voice for 
Alaska. We only have one Congressman 
for all of Alaska. Only seven States 
have just one Congressman. 
And, of course, Alaska is farther 
away from Washington, DC, than all of 
those States, bigger than all of them 
combined, and our vast amount of Fed-
eral acreage means that we have more 
issues and perhaps more complicated 
issues that have to be addressed as 
well, but none of that mattered to Don 
Young. 
He took the long trips back home in 
stride. He would use his time on the 
plane to meet people, to talk to them, 
to just have conversation, try to under-
stand their priorities and concerns, but 
he was making friends. 
He did the same here in Washington. 
He worked tirelessly here to build rela-
tionships, build alliances that would 
help him help Alaska, help address our 
State’s challenges. It wasn’t as if he 
was seeking out bipartisan relation-
ships necessarily; Don was just the 
kind of guy who would make friends. 
The record shows that Congressman 
Young was one of the top legislators of 
our time. He was the primary sponsor 
of 123 bills that became law. You go 
over to his office, and you will see pic-
tures on the wall of 10 different Presi-
dents who signed into law different 
measures that Don had participated in. 
Again, recall Don Young was one of 435 
voting Members of the House and the 
only one there to represent Alaska, and 
he was repeatedly named one of his 
Chamber’s most effective Members. 
Don Young was old school because his 
relationships really ran on both sides 
of the aisle, starting with Speaker 
PELOSI, Leader MCCARTHY, and span-
ning the spectrum of all who would 
work with him. He really did work tire-
lessly to do what was right for Alaska 
because, at the end of the day, that is 
all he cared about, and he was pretty 
open about that. 
Being a Congressman for Alaska re-
quires every last bit of you. It requires 
tremendous sacrifice from you and 
your family. If you don’t trust that, if 
you doubt that, just ask Anne Walton 
Young. Since they married in 2015, she 
has been by his side literally every day, 
in the office, traveling with him. She 
knows. She knows the work ethic of 
this man, she knows the heart of this 
man, and she knows how hard he 
worked for all of Alaska. 
From his first day to his last day, 49 
years and 13 days, Don Young gave it 
his all. As a true man of his people, he 
was just the right Alaskan to serve in 
the people’s Chamber. 
Senator SULLIVAN and I are going to 
have a lot more to say about our dear 
friend, our partner, our team leader in 
the coming days and weeks. We will 
have a number of occasions to honor 
his life and legacy, including on March 
29, when he will lie in state in Statuary 
Hall for a well-deserved tribute. 
For today, however, our reality is 
that for the first time in 49 years, Alas-
ka does not have a Congressman in the 
House of Representatives. For the first 
time in 49 years, Alaska does not have 
Don Young there to defend, to advo-
cate, and to legislate on our behalf. 
And I am heartbroken and so are 
countless Alaskans and individuals 
across the country whose lives happen 
to intersect with this legendary legis-
lator. 
On Saturday morning, I got a text 
from a former staffer who left years 
ago, a young man, and in his text, he 
says: 
Don Young was the only Congressman for 
all of Alaska for all of my life. I will miss 
him. 
We have lost a giant whom we loved 
dearly and who held Alaska in his 
heart always. We thank him for every-
thing he did for us to build our State 
and fulfill so much of our promise. We 
owe his family—his wife, Anne; his 
daughters, Joni, Sister—a debt of grat-
itude for sharing him with us for so 
long. Together with them, we mourn 
for our late Congressman, Alaska’s 
champion, and our dear friend, Don 
Young. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield to 
my fellow Senator from Alaska. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, like 
my good friend and colleague Senator 
MURKOWSKI, I rise today to recognize a 
giant, a larger than life man, certainly 
a legend in our State, and certainly a 
legend in the House of Representatives, 
Congressman for all Alaska, Donald 
Edwin Young. 
As Senator MURKOWSKI
mentioned, 
we lost this great Alaskan, this great 
American, while flying home with his 
beloved wife, Anne, by his side just this 
weekend. He was flying back home to 
Alaska, the State he loved so much and 
served so well. It is a State that loved 
him back and showed him that love by 
electing him to office every 2 years 
since 1973. Think about that. Unbeliev-
able. He was the longest serving politi-
cian in Alaska’s history, the longest 
serving Republican Member of the 
House in U.S. history, our North Star, 
Don Young. As Senator MURKOWSKI 
mentioned, he was 88 years young. 
I just want to say, like all Alaskans, 
my wife Julie and I, when we heard the 
news, we were saddened, shocked, dev-
astated by the sudden passing of Con-
gressman Don Young. And we heard 
this from so many people over the 
weekend: his spirit, authentic, tena-
cious, indomitable, a man of the peo-
ple—a true man of the people—epito-
mized our State to such a degree that 
there was this sense that he would al-
ways be there, that he would live for-
ever. There was this sense, and the 
shock back home is so palpable because 
of that. Think about, almost three- 
quarters of our State’s history, Don 
Young was our Congressman. 
So I, too, want to spend a little bit of 
time talking about this incredible 
man, this life in full, as Senator MUR-
KOWSKI mentioned. 
A lot of stories about being raised on 
a small ranch in Central California, 
where he began the hard work of ranch-
ing as a young, young boy. Don Young 
once said: My dad was a good man, but 
he believed when you turned 7, you be-
came a hired man. So he was working 
at the age of 7, Sun up to Sun down. It 
was hot, riddled with snakes and poi-
son ivy. Evidently, Don Young did not 
like snakes or hot weather because he 
mentioned often about his father read-
ing him Jack London’s ‘‘The Call of the 
Wild,’’ a book about a dog, a man, the 
harsh conditions of the Yukon, and 
loyalty. 
Senator MURKOWSKI
already men-
tioned that one of the things—and I 
love this man so much—but one of the 
things about him that you always 
knew was loyal, loyal, loyal. What a 
great quality. What a great quality. 
Then, of course, Alaska captured his 
imagination—no snakes, no poison ivy, 
snow. Those of us, all of us who saw 
Don Young over the years carry around 
that battery-powered portable fan, we 
knew that, well, Don Young ran hot 
with that fan. 
So, as Senator MURKOWSKI
men-
tioned, he got his associate’s degree 
from Yuba Junior College in 1952. He 
served in the Army—I always loved to 
give him a little grief about his Army 
service as a marine—Chico State, and 
then at an Elks Club in Chico, he heard 
then-Alaska Territorial Governor Mike 
Stepovich give a speech about Alaska, 
talking about the wonders of Alaska, 
and Don Young was hooked. In 1959, the 
year we became a State, he heeded the

call of the wild, headed up the Alcan— 
much 
of 
it 
still 
unpaved—in 
a 
brandnew Plymouth Fury, and the 
great State of Alaska would never be 
the same. 
According to Don Young, in Alaska, 
you could ‘‘do anything you wanted 
to,’’ so he did. As Senator MURKOWSKI 
mentioned, he fought forest fires. He 
owned a skating rink for a short time. 
I would have loved to have seen that, 
by the way. He owned a movie theater, 
tried his hand at commercial fishing, 
trapping, 
prospecting 
for 
gold. 
Of 
course, he was a tugboat captain, 
teacher at a BIA school, importantly, 
in Fort Yukon, and that is where he al-
ways called home. In fact, he still has 
a home there. He used to joke he is the 
only Congressman who, when he goes 
home, uses an outhouse when he goes 
home. 
He eventually met Lu, his wife—in-
credible Lu, who stayed by his side for 
46 years until she passed in 2009. Since 
that time, Don found another wonder-
ful partner in Anne. So, Anne, thank 
you and the family for sharing him 
with us. 
Don, with Lu’s prompting, caught the 
political bug. He served in the State 
house in Alaska and the State senate. 
Now, he discovered that he didn’t like 
the senate much. ‘‘All they did was 
stand around with hands behind their 
back and talk’’—that is what he said 
about the Alaska State Senate. 
Well, guess what. His attitude about 
the U.S. Senate wasn’t that much dif-
ferent. 
‘‘You 
Senators 
are 
always 
late,’’ he would often growl at me and 
LISA—and we were when we had our 
frequent Alaska delegation meetings. 
But even as Senators, we always knew 
our 
place 
with 
Congressman 
Don 
Young, dean of the House. All those 
Alaska congressional meetings were 
over in his office—were over in his of-
fice. 
One of my favorite things I did with 
Don Young, as dean of the House, wher-
ever I saw him—particularly in public 
in Alaska—the first time I would see 
him at an event or something, I would 
say, ‘‘It’s the dean of the House.’’ I 
would grab his hand, take a knee, and 
kiss his ring. Now, he always said, 
‘‘Stop that. I hate it when you do 
that.’’ But do you know what? I think 
he actually kind of liked it. I actually 
think he kind of liked it. 
So he didn’t like the Senate; he liked 
the House, the place where bills move 
fast, where elections are right around 
the corner no matter what—think 
about that, 25 elections. Jeez Louise. I 
could never think about that—and 
where the action was. Mostly, he was a 
man of the people, and he belonged in 
the people’s House. 
Along the way, he had two wonderful 
daughters, Joni and Sister, whom he 
loved fiercely. He always said the most 
important thing in his life were those 
two daughters. 
Lu was nothing if not persuasive. She 
was no doubt the boss in the family, 
and so when she told him he needed to 
run for Congress, he did. And with the 
help of many people—and I would like 
to say my wife’s grandmother, her 
Sitsoo, was an avid Don Young sup-
porter, flew all over interior Alaska 
during those early campaigns to help 
him introduce himself to a wider audi-
ence. 
So when Don was appointed to his 
seat in 1973, the original knock against 
him, he said back then, was that he 
didn’t know anything about DC. People 
said: You don’t know anything about 
DC; it is going to take you 2 years until 
you can find the bathroom in your of-
fice building. 
I am sure some of you heard the 
story that the first day in office, he 
combed the Rayburn Building looking 
for the bathroom, when someone fi-
nally said, ‘‘Congressman, why don’t 
you use the one in your office?’’ which 
I don’t think he had noticed. So he was 
learning. 
But on a more serious note—and I 
love this story. The day after he was 
sworn in, there was a hearing on the 
Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization 
Act. 
After being held up for years by liti-
gation 
and 
studies—imagine 
that; 
sound familiar, America?—Don suc-
cessfully pushed through an amend-
ment—to me, one of the most brilliant 
amendments ever conceived in the 
Halls of Congress—that said: No more 
studies and no more litigation. We are 
done. We are building the Trans-Alaska 
Pipeline System now. 
He said: 
It was a hard fight. Half of my side was 
[initially] fighting against me. 
But when the vote was called, he pre-
vailed. His amendment prevailed by 
four votes, and Alaska’s history was 
changed forever. America’s history was 
changed forever. 
And, by the way, what a great idea: 
Stop endless litigation. Stop studying 
things. Build infrastructure. The coun-
try and the State of Alaska need en-
ergy. Practical, commonsense, get it 
done—this is why Alaskans loved Don 
Young so much. 
The day of that vote, when it was 
successful, 
1973—remember—Ralph 
Nader stood outside the hall and de-
clared Don Young the most powerful 
Member of Congress—brandnew, baby 
freshman from Alaska, Don Young. 
Now, you can say a lot of things about 
Ralph Nader, but he knew power when 
he saw it, and Don Young had it, kept 
it. He went on to win every election 
after that. 
And, as Senator MURKOWSKI
men-
tioned, more than 90 bills that he spon-
sored became law, thousands more that 
he cosponsored—mostly to help Alaska 
but to help our whole country. And he 
became a fierce advocate for helping 
people—thousands and thousands of 
Alaskans and Americans. 
Every 2 years since 1973, Alaskans 
could count on Don Young, during 1 of 
his 24 elections, standing on a corner 
with 
his 
supporters—many 
here 
today—waving signs in the cold in No-
vember back home, wearing his old 
winter coat. And if you didn’t know it 
then—and few Alaskans didn’t know— 
you wouldn’t guess that the man in 
those clothes had so much power and 
had done so much to help his fellow 
Alaskans and fellow Americans. Nearly 
everything—and I mean everything— 
that has advanced to benefit our State 
in the Congress has Don Young’s fin-
gerprints on it. The Alaska we know 
today is only possible because of Don 
Young. 
As I mentioned, there is, of course, 
the 
Trans-Alaska 
Pipeline 
System, 
which transformed our State and our 
Nation, as well as many of the vic-
tories that Senator MURKOWSKI
just 
mentioned. 
I always like to talk about the Mag-
nuson-Stevens Act, which, of course, 
transformed America’s fishing indus-
try. Among others things, it created a 
200-mile limit to keep foreign fisher-
men from plundering our fish and sus-
tained our fisheries. It used to be just 
3 miles. Now, we all know it is the 
Magnuson-Stevens Act, but, of course, 
Don Young moved it in the House with 
Congressman Gerry Studds of Massa-
chusetts. So I used to like to say, in 
events with Don Young: Magnuson-Ste-
vens, or maybe a better name would 
have been the ‘‘Young-Studds Act,’’ 
which, of course, he loved that idea. So 
I kind of liked calling it the ‘‘Young- 
Studds Act.’’ 
But here is the thing, the story that 
is such a great story that a lot of peo-
ple don’t know: The executive branch 
wasn’t thrilled about this bill, wasn’t 
thrilled about it at all, to such a degree 
that President Ford was considering 
vetoing it. Why? Because he had a real-
ly smart, clever Secretary of State, 
Henry Kissinger, who thought it would 
raise tensions with our allies—the Ko-
reans and the Japanese in particular— 
who loved fishing off the coast of Alas-
ka, taking our fish. Two hundred miles 
off, they were going to lose out. They 
were mad. So he was encouraging a 
veto. 
Whether it was on the racquetball 
court, in the Halls of the Capitol, or a 
potlatch in rural Alaska, Don Young 
knew where to be to get things done for 
Alaska. And he knew that the Presi-
dent and Kissinger were heading to 
Asia, stopping over in Alaska. So Don 
and his two daughters and Lu got a 
ride on Air Force One. A few martinis 
later, Don Young, the new Congress-
man from Alaska, was debating one of 
the most brilliant men in America—the 
Secretary of State, former Harvard 
professor Dr. Henry Kissinger—on Air 
Force One in front of President Ford: 
Veto the Magnuson-Stevens Act or not. 
Well, guess who won that debate: the 
Harvard professor or the tugboat cap-
tain? It was the tugboat captain. Now, 
Don jokingly credits the martinis, but 
we all know that he was the one who 
got that done. And, again, our State 
and our country’s history wouldn’t be 
the same. And, by the way, Henry Kis-
singer and Don Young were great 
friends ever since.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1745 
March 23, 2022 
Mr. President, that is just one exam-
ple of many, as Senator MURKOWSKI 
mentioned. Don Young served with 10 
Presidents, and he knew them all. 
President George H.W. Bush called him 
‘‘Moose.’’ 
They 
played 
racquetball 
often. He had Dungeness crab flown in 
to eat with President George W. Bush. 
He and President Clinton were at the 
White House together one night when 
the vote was called. They were having 
so much fun that President Clinton 
said: I don’t want you to leave, Don. 
Don said: Well, Mr. President, I will 
need a hall pass. 
So he got a handwritten note from 
President 
Clinton, 
writing 
to 
the 
Speaker of the House: Dear Mr. Speak-
er. Please excuse Don Young from vot-
ing tonight. We are having cigars at 
the White House. 
And when Don Young went to the 
White House to sign the ANWR legisla-
tion that we had been working on and 
that he had been working on for over 40 
years and were able to pass—again, our 
small and mighty team working to-
gether, 2017, with President Trump—he 
turned to President Trump and said: So 
you are the other Don in this town. 
So Don Young has been great friends 
with Presidents, world leaders, but 
what really motivated and moved him 
was helping people, especially Alas-
kans. It didn’t matter their title, their 
political affiliation. He just wanted to 
help people. 
He said: As long as you respect the 
other person and their beliefs, you can 
be successful. Whether in the majority 
or the minority, I try to work with 
people to solve problems. My job is to 
listen to what they want and how I can 
then help them get it done. 
Like I said, commonsense, prac-
tical—no wonder so many Alaskans 
loved Don Young. And we all know he 
could tell a story, holding court. 
As we know, in the House there isn’t 
assigned seating, but there was one 
seat in the House that nobody sat in: 
Don Young’s. And, by the way, if you 
did, you may be taking your life into 
your own hands. 
He sat, and Members gathered around 
him, listening to his stories. The story 
of the oosik might come up, how he 
used that in debates, how he sat during 
a committee hearing with his fingers 
caught in a bear trap to make a point, 
and his legendary office Christmas par-
ties. Young staffers and Members from 
all over the Congress stood in a long 
line that snaked into the hallway just 
to have a few minutes to hear him 
holding court. 
But his true love was always Alaska. 
He could have done anything, been 
anything, but he chose to stay and 
work for the people up until the last 
moment of his life. 
You can make all the money in the 
world. But if you aren’t happy, it 
doesn’t count for anything. 
And Don Young was a happy man. 
When we lost Don Young, we lost a 
piece of Alaska, a piece of ourselves, a 
piece of his indomitable, irascible spir-
it. But it will live on forever, and I 
know that he has an army of loyalists 
he has amassed through the years in 
the Gallery, in addition to family, his 
wonderful family. 
Dozens of staffers are here to pay 
tribute. Some of them now work for 
my office. In fact, early on in my Sen-
ate career, I learned something very 
smart. I frequently stole Don Young’s 
staff to come work for me: well- 
trained, smart. I still do it. And he 
never minded. As a matter of fact, he 
always said: I just want what is best 
for my people. 
Larry 
Burton, 
Erik 
Elam, 
Chad 
Padgett, Liz Banicki, Scott Leathard— 
so many are still here with me. So 
many cut their teeth at Don Young’s 
office. And like so many who know Don 
Young, they are intensely loyal to this 
great Alaskan. 
His spirit will live on in the House of 
Representatives 
and 
the 
people’s 
House, and his spirit will live on in ev-
erything he has done for our State and 
every Alaskan from the Trans-Alaska 
Pipeline, to the Ketchikan shipping 
yard, to the many, many land ex-
changes, the health clinics dotting our 
State, the state-of-the-art Alaska Na-
tive Medical Center in Anchorage. 
And his spirit will live in his wonder-
ful family: Joni and Sister, his 13 
grandchildren, Anne, and so many oth-
ers. Don was a dear friend and mentor 
to me, to Senator MURKOWSKI, to my 
wife Julie, and so many others. He was 
truly a man of the people, a great man 
of the people. 
We miss you, Don. Rest in peace. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO OFFICER JUNIOR 
PAULEUS 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, when a po-
lice officer is shot in the line of duty 
and 
survives, 
every 
fellow 
officer 
breathes a sigh of relief and offers a si-
lent prayer of thanks because they 
know that such a risk exists each time 
they put on their uniform and begin 
another day on the job. 
Today, I want to recognize a member 
of the Lexington Police Department, 
Officer Junior Pauleus, who was shot 
in the back at close range on February 
5, 2022, as he was conducting a routine 
investigation with other members of 
the Lexington police force. 
Officer Pauleus, only 28 years old, 
has an interesting and compelling life 
story. He is a proud American, but not 
by birth. Originally from Haiti, Officer 
Pauleus met his future wife, Audrey, 
while she was on a mission trip. He 
eventually immigrated to the U.S. and 
became a citizen. Now, settled and 
thriving with his young family in Ken-
tucky, he very recently joined the Lex-
ington Police Department and was still 
on field training officer status on that 
fateful Saturday in February when he 
said his normal goodbyes to his wife 
and three children—including his 5- 
day-old son—and started another shift. 
Thankfully, this is a story with a 
happy ending, and we are grateful for 
many things: for the fact that he and 
the officers with whom he was working 
with are all safe following the shoot-
ing; for the discipline and training on 
which they all rely; for the body armor 
that protected him; and for all the men 
and women of his department who will-
ingly serve the Lexington community, 
even with the knowledge that, in an in-
stant, their own lives can be taken. 
I am privileged to meet young men 
and women like Officer Pauleus each 
time I travel to events throughout 
Kentucky. I am personally indebted to 
them for their service, and I am hon-
ored to recognize one example from 
among their ranks today. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TROOPER MICHAEL 
SANGUINI 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, too often, 
we hear an account of another police 
officer in our Nation coming under at-
tack while carrying out their daily du-
ties, protecting the citizens of their 
community. It is important that we re-
member these sacrifices and the many 
dangers these brave men and women 
face each day. The daily walk of an 
American law enforcement officer is 
truly a walk of faith each day: faith in 
their abilities obtained from countless 
hours of training, faith to face the 
many dangers presented to them dur-
ing their daily activities, faith in the 
many friends and family members be-
hind the scenes offering supporting 
prayer and strength, and faith in know-
ing their job is a calling to assist the 
many in their community seeking help 
in time of need. 
Today, I want to recognize a member 
of the Kentucky State Police, Trooper 
Michael Sanguini, who was shot mul-
tiple times on January 28, 2022, while 
conducting a traffic stop in Harrison 
County. According to the preliminary 
investigation, he was struck six times, 
of which three shots were stopped by 
his ballistic vest. One shot struck his 
portable radio, and another struck his 
issued taser, with one shot striking his 
body. Thankfully, Trooper Sanguini 
suffered non-life-threatening injuries. 
God clearly protected this young troop-
er. 
Trooper Sanguini is a native of Bour-
bon County, KY, and a graduate of 
Bourbon County High School. He then 
went on to Eastern Kentucky Univer-
sity, graduating in 2019. Following his 
graduation from the Kentucky State 
Police 
Academy 
in 
2019, 
Trooper 
Sanguini was assigned to the Dry 
Ridge Post. I am pleased to say that 
Trooper Sanguini remains a viable part 
of the Kentucky State Police following 
this incident. I wish Trooper Sanguini 
a full and speedy recovery from his in-
juries and personally thank him for the 
dedication to his profession and his 
willingness to risk everything for the 
protection of others. 
f 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LATIN 
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION 
Mr. OSSOFF. Mr. President, today 
let the Senate recognize the 50th anni-
versary of the Latin American Associa-
tion based in Atlanta, GA. 
Founded and led by Angel Ortiz and 
Stratton Frank, what started as a 
small organization to serve Atlanta’s 
then-emerging Latino population has 
become one of the largest service pro-
viders and advocates for Georgia’s 
Latino and immigrant communities. 
With a focus on civic engagement, 
economic empowerment, youth serv-
ices, family stabilization, and immi-
gration services, the association has 
made a big difference in the lives of 
hundreds of thousands of Georgians. 
The Latin American Association has 
been instrumental helping immigrants 
who have newly arrived to the United 
States to assimilate, feel at home, and 
positively contribute to our great Na-
tion. Because of their work, Georgia 
and the country are better off. 
On behalf of the State of Georgia and 
the U.S. Senate, I express our heartfelt 
thanks to the Latin American Associa-
tion.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. 
BOOZMAN, Ms. HASSAN, and Mr. 
ROUNDS): 
S. 3909. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to make employ-
ers of spouses of military personnel eli-
gible for the work opportunity credit; 
to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing the Military Spouse 
Hiring Act with my colleagues Sen-
ators BOOZMAN, HASSAN, and ROUNDS. 
Enacting this bill would improve finan-
cial stability for Blue Star families 
across the country. 
The 
families 
of 
America’s 
servicemembers make sacrifices that 
often go unrecognized. Among them is 
packing up and moving frequently, 
with military spouses regularly having 
to leave stable employment to move to 
a new area and start over. This is com-
pounded by the complex system of 
State licensing and certification re-
quirements, which can prevent these 
spouses from taking jobs that utilize 
their expertise and experience. Because 
of this, military spouses have unem-
ployment rates substantially higher 
than the national average, and they 
are often underemployed when they do 
have jobs. Adding to the financial 
struggles caused by frequent periods of 
unemployment and underemployment, 
the rising cost of child care puts a sub-
stantial burden on many military fami-
lies. 
The Military Spouse Hiring Act 
would help these families by making 
military spouses an eligible population 
for the work opportunity tax credit. 
This tax credit has proven effective in 
improving employment prospects for 
other groups. Extending it to military 
spouses would help them find employ-
ment more easily after moving to new 
areas. 
I hope my colleagues will support 
this bill to help families who have 
made the greatest sacrifice for our na-
tion. 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Mr. WARNER): 
S. 3911. A bill to establish the Shen-
andoah Mountain National Scenic Area 
in the State of Virginia, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing legislation that is the 
product of 18 years of collaborative 
work from a diverse group of stake-
holders in Virginia, including local 
recreation 
groups, 
conservationists, 
timber industry representatives, and 
sportsmen. 
The Shenandoah Mountain Act of 
2022 would designate more than 92,000 
acres of the George Washington Na-
tional Forest in Virginia as the Shen-
andoah 
Mountain 
National 
Scenic 
Area, SMNSA. 
Congress designates national scenic 
areas to protect the natural and scenic 
value of lands that are also compatible 
with recreational uses such as hiking, 
fishing, hunting, camping, mountain 
biking, among others. 
The SMNSA encompasses four wil-
derness areas: Skidmore Fork, Little 
River, Ramsey’s Draft, and Lynn Hol-
low, which in total include 10 peaks 
above 4,000 feet and 150 miles of trails 
to attract campers, hikers, mountain 
bikers, fishermen, birders, and eques-
trians. The legislation also establishes 
a 5,764 acre wilderness area at Beech 
Lick Knob, located 10 miles to the 
north. 
The SMNSA will protect important 
water resources, as it contains head-
waters for the Potomac and James Riv-
ers and watersheds that provide drink-
ing water sources for Harrisonburg, 
Staunton, and communities farther 
downstream, such as Washington, DC, 
and Richmond. It is also a hotspot for 
biodiversity. Cold mountain streams in 
the area are also a stronghold for na-
tive brook trout. Today’s legislation 
would permanently protect those rivers 
and streams from industrial develop-
ment, and it would also help safeguard 
plant and wildlife habitat for black 
bears, wild turkeys, more than 250 spe-
cies of birds, and at-risk species like 
the Cow Knob and Shenandoah Moun-
tain salamanders. 
The Shenandoah Mountain National 
Scenic Area will provide a boost to the 
region’s growing tourism industry. In 
2019, the tourism economy directly em-
ployed 5,365 people and generated $601 
million in Augusta, Rockingham, and 
Highland Counties, as well as Harrison-
burg and Staunton. Designation of the 
SMNSA would further grow this value. 
These challenging past 2 years have 
underscored that getting out into na-
ture is critical to our health and well- 
being. I am proud that the Shenandoah 
Mountain Act will expand these oppor-
tunities within the George Washington 
National Forest for visitors near and 
far, while also boosting our local 
economies, protecting drinking water 
sources, and preserving the wildlife 
that makes this area so special. 
The local governments of Staunton, 
Augusta, Rockingham, and Harrison-
burg, along with over 400 businesses 
and organizations, have endorsed the 
new designation for the vast benefits it 
will have on the surrounding commu-
nities. I thank my colleague Senator 
MARK WARNER for joining me in intro-
ducing this legislation. I also commend 
our local stakeholders for working on 
this proposal for so many years.

the adoption and furtherance of this tech-
nology. Therefore, given the path to initial oper-
ations is taking place utilizing today’s regu-
latory framework, it is critical that government 
agencies collaborate and focus on taking this

and investment in energy, infrastructure, secu-
rity and transportation. The focus of the work-
ing group is interagency coordination to enable 
the maturation and growth of AAM.

group established under this section is to plan 
for and coordinate efforts related to safety, in-
frastructure, physical security and cybersecu-
rity, and Federal investment necessary for mat-
uration of the AAM ecosystem, particularly pas-
senger-carrying aircraft, in the United States in 
order to— 
(1) further United States leadership; 
(2) grow new transportation options; 
(3) amplify economic activity and jobs; 
(4) advance environmental sustainability and 
new technologies; and 
(5) support emergency preparedness and com-
petitiveness. 
(d) MEMBERSHIP.—The working group shall be 
comprised of at least 1 representative of each of 
the following Federal departments and agencies: 
(1) Department of Transportation.

ments, industry and labor stakeholders, stake-
holder associations, and others determined ap-
propriate by the Secretary of Transportation, 
including— 
(1) manufacturers of avionics, AAM use air-
craft, propulsion systems, structures, and air 
traffic management systems; 
(2) air carriers, commercial operators, general 
aviation operators and future AAM operators; 
(3) airports; 
(4) fixed-based operators, as defined in FAA
