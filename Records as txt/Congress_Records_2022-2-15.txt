PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
What do You have in store for us 
today, O Lord? If we are overly proud 
and self-promoting, will You humble 
us? If we are arrogant and false, will 
You put us in our place? 
Or will You show forgiveness to us? 
If we stand in Your awesome pres-
ence, in the splendor of Your majesty, 
will You accept our repentance from 
our idol worship, our love of things, 
our pursuit of self-gratification, our 
trust in our own human minds, and re-
ceive us once again, into Your loving 
embrace? 
What do You offer us today, O Lord? 
If we rely on You to make our deci-
sions, will You give us clarity? If we 
look for You in the situations we face, 
the challenges laid before us, will You 
make Yourself known? If we trust in 
You, will You remind us again how 
trustworthy You are, how steadfast 
Your love? 
Holy God, we humble ourselves be-
fore You. We ask for Your mercy in our 
missteps and Your grace as we at-
tempt, in faith, to follow You this day. 
We yield our souls and spirits to 
Your guidance that the day You lay 
out before us would glorify You. 
We offer this prayer in Your most 
holy name. 
Amen.

Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 2022 
No. 30 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Lord God, who rules the rag-
ing of the sea, give to the Members of 
this body a special measure of wisdom 
and strength for the living of these 
days. 
Lord, help them to see what a prac-
tical resource they have in You as You 
empower them to complete their daily 
business with civility, cooperation, and 
competence. 
Bless the Senate leadership, the lead-
ers of both parties, and their assistants 
and aides. Bless those who chair com-
mittees and subcommittees who man-
age bills. 
Lord, fill Capitol Hill with the un-
mistakable sense of Your presence as 
You enable our lawmakers to accom-
plish those things that without You 
would be impossible. 
We pray in Your precious Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
The Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—H.R. 3076 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, first, Mr. Presi-
dent, I understand there is a bill at the 
desk that is due for a second reading. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the bill by title for the 
second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3076) to provide stability to 
and enhance the services of the United 
States Postal Service, and for other pur-
poses. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bill on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I would object to fur-
ther proceeding. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bill will be 
placed on the calendar. 
f 
POSTAL SERVICE REFORM ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, 
last night—and this is relevant to what 
we just did, putting the new bill on the 
calendar for a second reading. Last 
night, we had a chance to continue 
progress on a bipartisan, long-overdue 
postal reform bill when I moved to ex-
peditiously fix a few technical errors to 
the legislation sent to us by the House. 
Sadly, my request was blocked by the 
junior Senator from Florida without 
much in the way of clear explanation. 
For instance, he says he wants to 
stand up for postal workers, but all the 
organizations 
representing 
postal 
workers strongly support this bill. 
They are eager for it. He says he wants 
to protect and strengthen Medicare, 
but the Postal Service already pays 
into Medicare; and the CBO says this 
proposal, this bill, will save the govern-
ment money. 
So I hope for the sake of our postal 
workers, our Postal Service, and for 
the millions, tens of millions, and even 
hundreds of millions of Americans who 
depend on the Postal Service, that this 
is not obstruction for obstruction’s 
sake. 
This is a textbook example of why 
Americans often get frustrated with 
the Senate and with Washington. Post-
al reform is highly bipartisan. It got a 
majority of votes in the House from 
both parties. It is desperately needed. 
We all hear from our constituents 
about snail mail and the price they pay 
for it. It is backed by both parties in 
both Houses, including the chairman 
and ranking member of the relevant 
committees—the Democratic and Re-
publican leading members of both com-
mittees. And it has broad support from 
the postal workers, who tend to be 
Democratic, and Postmaster DeJoy, 
who is a friend of President Trump’s 
and was appointed by him. 
Nevertheless, it was blocked. I am 
sure that Republicans don’t want to be 
the party that was responsible for 
blocking popular and bipartisan postal 
reform. 
The delay is regrettable, but the good 
news is that we will get bipartisan 
postal reform done. It has been nego-
tiated for months and debated for a 
decade. It has enough bipartisan sup-
port—more than enough—ample sup-
port to become law, and I am hopeful 
we will move it through this Chamber 
as quickly as we can. And that is what 
the procedural motion I did before was 
about. 
And I certainly want to thank my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle for 
working on this bill, particularly, my

friend Chairman GARY
PETERS, who 
spoke passionately last night in de-
fense of the bill and rebutted all of the 
Senator 
from 
Florida’s 
arguments 
handily. And I look forward to getting 
postal reform passed through this 
Chamber very soon. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Next, on the CR, be-
fore the end of the week, the Senate 
must come to an agreement to pass a 
short-term extension of government 
funding in order to give appropriators 
more time to complete a yearlong om-
nibus. It is the most responsible thing 
we can do to support our appropriators 
as they continue their bipartisan work 
to finish an omnibus. No one—and cer-
tainly not my Republican colleagues— 
wants a Republican government shut-
down; so I am hopeful that they will 
cooperate with us to pass this nec-
essary CR, which every single Demo-
crat wants to happen and will cooper-
ate to make sure that it happens. 
Once again, I thank Chairman LEAHY 
and Ranking Member SHELBY for their 
leadership and for working in good 
faith to arrive at a yearlong spending 
agreement. I also commend my col-
leagues 
in 
the 
House, 
Chairman 
DELAURO
and 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER, Democrat and Republican, 
for their work. A yearlong omnibus is a 
thousand times better than relying on 
CRs—continuing resolutions—to lurch 
from one short-term extension to the 
next. I remain optimistic that both 
sides will keep working together on 
drafting legislation to fund the govern-
ment so it can fully serve the Amer-
ican people while keeping us safe here 
at home. 
In the meantime, both sides should 
come to an agreement to make sure 
the CR—the continuing resolution, the 
short-term funding of the govern-
ment—is passed by this Chamber to 
avoid even any hint of a government 
shutdown. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last 
night I filed cloture on additional De-
fense 
nominees, 
including 
Celeste 
Wallander, nominated to serve as As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Inter-
national Security Affairs. If this were 
any other time, Ms. Wallander’s nomi-
nation most certainly would have 
sailed through the Senate with unani-
mous consent, without the need for a 
rollcall vote. 
At the committee level, her nomina-
tion was approved with strong support 
from both parties; and, frankly, she 
should have been approved unani-
mously the moment she was reported 
out of the Armed Services Committee. 
Many on both sides of the aisle recog-
nize we need her at the Pentagon now. 
As one of our Nation’s top experts on 
Russian affairs, her leadership is vital 
right now. 
Sadly—sadly—one Republican, just 
one, has objected to Ms. Wallander’s 
confirmation without offering any con-
crete justification. So we are going to 
take up floor time to advance her nom-
ination the long way, just as we have 
done for many nominees who face un-
precedented obstruction by a small 
group of Republicans. This is not the 
majority of the Republican Party or 
the majority of Republican Senators, 
but a small group using the Senate 
rules—many of which are arcane and 
outdated—to stand in the way and slow 
the whole process down, endangering 
our security. 
Let’s be clear. To intentionally delay 
the confirmation of a critical Pentagon 
position—an expert on Russia at a time 
when we need her in the position 
most—just to score political points is 
the definition of cynical and is actively 
making the American people less safe. 
Sadly, Ms. Wallander is far from the 
only nominee being held up by these 
obstructionists on the right. The junior 
Senator from Arkansas has also placed 
blanket holds on a number of U.S. at-
torneys and U.S. marshals, men and 
women whose job is literally to protect 
the public and prosecute criminals. 
If my Republican colleagues are so 
concerned about public safety, why are 
they standing in the way of confirming 
some of the most important law en-
forcement officers in the Federal Gov-
ernment? It is ‘‘Alice in Wonderland’’ 
logic. It is delay for delay’s sake, espe-
cially when new reasons keep coming 
up to justify these tactics. One reason 
is rebutted, and then another one 
comes up. It seems like some of these 
colleagues just want to obstruct to ob-
struct, 
oppose 
to 
oppose—bad 
for 
America, bad for Democrats, bad for 
Republicans. 
Hijacking the rules of the Senate to 
place blanket holds on nominees has no 
legitimate justification. And when it 
comes to nominees tasked with advanc-
ing our national defense, our diplo-
macy, and our public safety, it only 
makes the American people less safe. 
As long as these delay tactics con-
tinue, we will continue to hold votes on 
these nominees as necessary. If that 
means more late nights with a large 
number of votes in one sitting like we 
had to do over the last 2 weeks, then 
that is what we will do. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on lowering costs, in President Biden’s 
first year, the economy added an amaz-
ing 6.6 million new jobs, the most 
ever—ever—for a President’s first year. 
This figure surpassed just about every 
forecast from a year ago. It is a reflec-
tion of how far our economy has come 
since the start of COVID and that the 
right leadership in office makes all the 
difference. 
But we all know Americans still need 
more help, especially when it comes to 
lowering the cost of living. Democrats 
know what the American people know. 
The pandemic decimated our supply 
chains, our labor supply, and much 
more, causing prices to increase for ev-
eryday items. We never had a pandemic 
to this extent in 100 years, and obvi-
ously it interrupted the economy and 
its supply chains and labor supply. 
For the past year, Democrats have 
been the party focused on finding solu-
tions to lowering the cost of living for 
everyday Americans. As early as last 
summer, Democrats pushed to have the 
Senate approve legislation to relieve 
U.S. supply chains and increase domes-
tic manufacturing, which, thankfully, 
was bipartisan and which the House 
passed recently as well. Soon the con-
ference process for that bill will begin. 
But this is just one example out of 
many. For the past few weeks, I have 
heard from my colleagues about a num-
ber of proposals they have been work-
ing on aimed squarely at helping Amer-
icans better afford the basics, from 
medications, to the cost of food, to the 
cost of cars, to more. Later today, 
Democrats will use our weekly caucus 
lunch to talk more about some of the 
ideas my colleagues are working on. 
Lowering costs must—must—be a bi-
partisan effort. Americans in States, 
those blue and red and in between, need 
relief as soon as possible. 
While many on the other side of the 
aisle have spent a lot of time giving 
floor speeches and presenting charts 
about rising costs, where are their ac-
tual proposals? We don’t hear what 
they would do to solve the problem. At-
tacking the problem doesn’t make it 
any better; proposing solutions, as 
Democrats are doing, does. Republicans 
should step up and say what their plan 
is to fight inflation, not just point fin-
gers. That solves no problem. 
Democrats will continue to propose 
legislation on cost cutting, and we are 
going to continue to focus on helping 
everyday Americans find relief. Some 
of my Democratic colleagues have al-
ready released their proposals publicly, 
and I am sure many of them would wel-
come Republican cooperation. Instead 
of sitting on the sidelines, Republicans 
should join Democrats in our efforts to 
help Americans reap the full benefits of 
our historic recovery. 
Our goal: to have the wages that have 
increased stay up but lower the costs 
down so the average American has 
more money in his or her pocket. 
We Democrats are committed to 
working in good faith to get things 
done in this Chamber. I hope our Re-
publican colleagues will constructively 
join us instead of just pointing fingers. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

February 15, 2022 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, at 
this time last year, Washington Demo-
crats were beginning their quest to 
dump trillions of dollars in leftwing 
spending on a recovering economy that 
already had the preconditions for some 
inflation. Everybody warned Demo-
crats to pump the brakes. Just weeks 
earlier, Republicans had already sup-
ported a smaller, targeted, bipartisan 
stimulus that had barely started to 
take effect. Even top liberal econo-
mists warned the Democrats’ agenda 
could spark massive inflation. 
The consequences for working fami-
lies have been particularly harsh. Es-
sential goods have played an outsized 
role in driving up prices overall. It is 
harder to put dinner on the table when 
eggs, meat, and fish are 12 percent 
more expensive. It is harder to fill up 
cars with gas that is 40 percent more 
expensive and to heat a home with nat-
ural gas that has gone up 24 percent or 
fuel oil that has gone up 47 percent. 
This is reality for millions of Ameri-
cans. They are living it every single 
day. 
Yet the Biden administration seems 
less interested in trying to solve this 
problem than in trying to persuade 
families that the pain is actually just 
in their heads. One recent story re-
ported that members of President 
Biden’s team were ‘‘seemingly mys-
tified’’ about why the American people 
weren’t celebrating this economy. 
Well, if Washington Democrats spent 
5 minutes talking to a middle-class 
family, I am confident they would 
cease to be mystified. The middle 40 
percent of American earners have seen 
their disposable incomes fall more than 
an entire percentage point over the 
last year—entirely due to inflation. 
Any American who hasn’t managed to 
secure an 8-percent pay raise in the 
last year has actually received a real 
pay cut, thanks to Democrats’ infla-
tion. 
The American people are reporting 
their lowest consumer sentiment in 
over a decade. Seventy-five percent say 
our economy is doing badly. Almost 80 
percent expect inflation to get worse. 
Six in ten say their family’s income 
isn’t keeping pace with their costs of 
living. 
These are not statistics the White 
House can wave away. We are actually 
talking about human pain. A working 
mother in Michigan said: 
I cannot buy the food that I would nor-
mally buy for my family. 
In Washington State, a single mom of 
four who also cares for her elderly par-
ents says she has had to take favorite 
family foods like frozen pizza and 
wings and make them ‘‘more of a treat 
than just a regular meal.’’ 
This is where Democrats’ policies 
have left working families. 
f 
FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD OF 
GOVERNORS NOMINEES 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
now, on a related matter, this Demo-
crat-caused inflation has forced the 
Federal Reserve and its Board of Gov-
ernors into a very tricky position. But 
while the country is carefully watching 
the Fed Board of Governors, the Senate 
happens to be considering several of 
President Biden’s nominees to that 
very same Board. 
Later today, I will meet with Chair-
man Powell, whom President Biden 
wisely renominated to serve another 
term atop the Fed. Chairman Powell 
has proven to be a straight shooter 
within the mainstream of monetary 
policy. His creative leadership helped 
stabilize our entire economy through 
the uncertain early days of the COVID 
recession. I look forward to discussing 
inflation and the state of our economy 
with Chairman Powell this afternoon. 
Unfortunately, several of President 
Biden’s other Fed nominees appear to 
have been significantly less wise selec-
tions. One nominee, Professor Cook 
from Michigan State University, has 
previously 
promoted 
partisan 
con-
spiracy theories. In 2020, she called for 
a fellow academic to be fired because 
he opposed defunding the police. 
The White House cites among Pro-
fessor Cook’s qualifications that she 
sits on the Board of Directors of the re-
gional Fed in Chicago. She was ap-
pointed to that position just a few days 
before President Biden nominated her 
for this one. 
More troubling still is President 
Biden’s nominee to the extremely pow-
erful position of Vice Chair for Super-
vision. This slot comes with major uni-
lateral power. But the President’s 
nominee, Sarah Bloom Raskin, has 
spent recent years pressuring the Fed 
to stop being a neutral regulator and 
instead become an ideological, leftwing 
activist body. 
Ms. Raskin has argued openly that 
unelected Fed Governors should use 
their powers to declare ideological war 
on fossil fuels and affordable American 
energy. 
Ms. Raskin wants our banking sys-
tem to start picking winners and losers 
in ways that would stick American 
families with higher gas prices, higher 
electricity bills, and more dependence 
on China. And she wants to implement 
this agenda from inside one of the least 
directly accountable institutions in 
our government so that voters simply 
have no recourse. 
The far left is already boasting that 
this backdoor Green New Deal would 
only be the first step. Democrats have 
already introduced legislation that 
would get the Federal Reserve into the 
racial redistribution business and in-
ject racial preferences into our finan-
cial system. These unpopular ideas 
would completely upend an institution 
that Americans need to remain non-
political, nonpartisan, and nonideolog-
ical. Fed Governors are supposed to be 
neutral regulators, not economic pol-
icy dictators whom voters can’t get rid 
of. 
If this weren’t disqualifying enough, 
potentially significant ethical ques-
tions have begun to swirl around Ms. 
Raskin’s nomination. During her time 
out of government, Ms. Raskin became 
affiliated with an obscure financial 
technology firm in Colorado. Shortly 
thereafter, 
somehow, 
mysteriously, 
this small company became what ap-
pears to be the only nonbank financial 
tech company in the entire country to 
receive a special master account that 
allowed them to directly access a core 
Federal Reserve system. 
This is an obviously worrisome topic, 
but I understand that Senators have 
not even been able to get Ms. Raskin to 
satisfy their basic requests for infor-
mation. So I would urge President 
Biden to find a better, more main-
stream, more bipartisan candidate to 
serve this crucial institution.

TRIBUTE TO COREY TELLEZ 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want 
to take a moment to say a special word 
of thanks to a former member of my 
staff who has meant a lot to me and 
has performed great service in my of-
fice. 
Corey Tellez was part manager and 
part legislative magician. She was also 
my deputy chief of staff. She was one 
of the first persons I would reach out 
to. She seemed to always find a way to 
translate big ideas into legislation and 
then legislation into law. 
Corey is driven by solid values. She 
has a special talent for management 
and 
organization.

February 15, 2022 
should be so lucky to have a Corey 
Tellez on their staff. 
Corey joined my staff nearly 11 years 
ago as my economic policy adviser. Her 
first assignment was to help craft and 
build support for a bill called the Mar-
ketplace Fairness Act. Here was the 
goal: 
give 
Main 
Street 
businesses 
across America, mom-and-pop shops, a 
level playing field on which to compete 
against the giant online retailers by 
giving States the option to require out- 
of-State businesses to collect sales tax 
on online sales, the same way local 
businesses do. 
The big online retailers resisted. 
Corey would not back down. She 
worked with the staff in the offices of 
our main cosponsors—Senators Mike 
Enzi, Heidi Heitkamp, and Lamar Alex-
ander—and together they came up with 
a solution that won support on both 
sides of the aisle and even won the sup-
port of some of the giant retailers. 
In 2013, the Marketplace Fairness Act 
passed the Senate. Corey was still 
working on getting the bill signed into 
law when, to our surprise, in 2018, the 
Supreme Court issued a ruling negat-
ing the need for it by giving the States 
the same option our bill created. 
Corey had made her mark, and she 
became a critical part of our legisla-
tive team. Six years ago, I moved her 
up to be my legislative director. Three 
years ago, she became my deputy chief 
of staff. 
At the end of last year, to my dis-
appointment, she announced she was 
moving on from the Senate for a new 
opportunity, working for the Depart-
ment of the Treasury in their congres-
sional relations office. She is returning 
to the field she loves, with a special 
emphasis on international economic 
policy. I have no doubt she is going to 
be successful just as she was in the 
Senate. 
Corey first came to the Hill 15 years 
ago, working in the Congressional His-
panic Caucus as an intern to the office 
of Representative HENRY CUELLAR of 
Texas. She already had a degree in po-
litical science and history and a law 
degree from the University of Illinois. 
She worked on the House side as a 
legislative assistant for Representative 
Carolyn McCarthy of New York and as 
deputy chief of staff and counsel for 
Representative Debbie Halvorson of Il-
linois. 
It is an impressive resume, but I 
think that Corey has put as much ef-
fort and passion into advancing the ca-
reers of others as she has her own. My 
own staff is filled with talented men 
and women whom she encouraged and 
gave a chance to grow professionally. 
There is a danger, when you work 
with policy and dry legislative text for 
a long time, that you might forget the 
people whose hopes and dreams ride on 
the laws we enact. That never was a 
problem for Corey. While growing up, 
Corey’s mom was a single mother. 
She views every bill and every initia-
tive through the eyes of a proud, hard- 
working American, just like her mom. 
Basically, she has two basic questions 
when it comes to these issues: Are they 
true to the Constitution? Do they treat 
working families with fairness and dig-
nity? That was her litmus test for any 
legislative undertaking. I can’t think 
of a better one. 
Since joining my staff, she became a 
mother too. She and her husband are 
parents to a little daughter, Elliott. 
With her move to her next exciting 
assignment, I want to say again: Thank 
you, Corey, for all that you have given 
our office, the Senate, and our State of 
Illinois. I am wishing you the very best 
of luck in your new position. 
JOHNSON & JOHNSON BANKRUPTCY 
Mr. President, what would a great 
corporation do, one that is just so iden-
tified with America that new parents 
trust their products and the work they 
do with the health of themselves and 
their brandnew baby? 
When you think back, for many of us, 
to when we became fathers, there was 
hardly a time when we didn’t have, 
holding in our hands, Johnson & John-
son’s Baby Powder. It clouded the room 
as we sprinkled it all over our babies 
and knew that it was just the right 
thing because others before us, other 
generations, had used the same prod-
uct. 
What is a company like Johnson & 
Johnson to do, then, when it turns out 
that there was an ingredient in that 
talcum powder that was dangerous? As-
bestos. Literally, asbestos. Well, it 
turns out they knew about it. They 
knew there was asbestos in Johnson & 
Johnson Baby Powder long before the 
lawsuits were filed. 
So what does a corporation worth 
$450 billion do when they discover that 
the product that they had been selling 
for generations to trusting American 
families was actually a danger and was 
now being connected to cancers and 
mesothelioma? 
Years ago, there was a great folk 
singer in America known as Woody 
Guthrie. He said there are two ways to 
get robbed. ‘‘Some will rob you with a 
gun, some with a fountain pen.’’ 
There are two systems in America, 
and Johnson & Johnson bears that out. 
There is a justice system for rich, pow-
erful people and corporations, and then 
there is a justice system for everybody 
else. And many days, it seems that the 
gulf between these two systems is just 
getting wider and deeper. 
There is something called the Texas 
two-step. It used to be just a dance 
step, but in recent years, it has taken 
on a new meaning, and it relates di-
rectly to Johnson & Johnson. It is a 
name given to a highly controversial 
form of legal strategy that some of the 
biggest corporations are using to shield 
their assets from accountability. It al-
lows massively wealthy corporations 
whose products caused harm to avoid 
paying damages to the victims. 
Not just that, the Texas two-step de-
nies the victims their right to make 
their case in court and take their issue 
to a jury or a judge. And it can stretch 
the process of seeking justice out for 
years and years and years, while vic-
tims get sicker and die. 
Does that sound like justice? It 
doesn’t sound like American justice. It 
sounds like somebody getting robbed 
with a fountain pen. 
A big law firm that is credited with 
dreaming 
up 
this 
Texas 
two-step 
charges over $1,000 an hour to advise 
large corporations on how to perform 
this maneuver. 
But we received a lesson on the Texas 
two-step in our committee last week 
for free. 
The 
Judiciary 
Committee’s 
Sub-
committee on Federal Courts, Over-
sight, Agency Action, and Federal 
Rights held the first ever Senate hear-
ing on the Texas two-step. We heard 
from experts just how it works. We also 
heard from one of its victims, Ms. Kim-
berly Naranjo, who has been given a 
fatal diagnosis from the lung disease 
mesothelioma. The name of that cor-
poration she believes caused her ill-
ness: Johnson & Johnson. 
Here is what we heard about how the 
Texas two-step works now, in a nut-
shell. Here is a big corporation like 
Johnson & Johnson that is being sued 
because it sold a dangerous product or 
it is likely to be sued for causing harm 
to victims. Well, they take their cor-
poration and reincorporate in the State 
of Texas and execute what is called a 
‘‘divisive merger.’’ They cut their cor-
poration not in half but legally in half. 
In a traditional merger, two compa-
nies become one. With a divisive merg-
er, it is just the opposite: One company 
becomes two. The original company 
keeps all the wealth, all the assets, and 
all the operations. The new company, 
created in this Texas procedure, is real-
ly just a shell. It receives the original 
company’s debts and liabilities and a 
small trust fund. 
The 
new 
company 
then 
reincor-
porates and turns around and files for 
bankruptcy in a jurisdiction where it is 
hard to get a bankruptcy filing dis-
missed for bad faith. This bankruptcy 
filing prompts a stay of litigation by 
people like Ms. Naranjo. The stay of 
litigation applies to both the shell 
company and the original company. So 
instead of being able to seek justice in 
a court of law for injuries, perhaps 
fatal injuries, victims are forced to try 
to recover from this newly created 
shell company that was made up in a 
bankruptcy court. How long does that 
take? Years. Sadly, for many of these 
victims, they don’t have years. 
As the victims wait for some measure 
of justice in bankruptcy court, the 
original company goes about its busi-
ness. It has shielded all its assets, 
passed its liabilities off in divisive 
merger to a shell corporation. The good 
corporation, so to speak, or the rich 
corporation ends up with no liabilities, 
admitting no wrongdoing. 
Under the laws of most States, com-
panies cannot move assets around like 
this through divisive mergers, but you 
can do it in Texas, hence the nickname

February 15, 2022 
the Texas two-step. So, step 1, create a 
shell company and transfer your legal 
liabilities; step 2, have the new com-
pany immediately declare bankruptcy. 
So far, four major corporations have 
used the Texas two-step and bank-
ruptcy to try to avoid legal account-
ability for their own wrongdoing. 
The case that the subcommittee ex-
amined 
last 
week 
involved 
the 
healthcare and pharmaceutical giant 
Johnson & Johnson, the maker of 
Johnson’s baby powder. As I mentioned 
earlier, how many of us fathers, moth-
ers, and kids changing diapers did it in 
a cloud of Johnson & Johnson’s baby 
powder? 
For years, Johnson & Johnson denied 
the story that its products contained 
asbestos. We know that substance can 
cause cancer and mesothelioma. Then 
it claimed that any amount of asbestos 
in its baby powder was just too small 
to cause any harm. But internal com-
pany documents at Johnson & Johnson 
obtained through discovery told a dif-
ferent story. They showed that John-
son & Johnson knew of tests going 
back decades which found the presence 
of asbestos in their products. While 
they were actively advertising the use 
of this product by adults for use on our 
babies, they knew there was asbestos 
in their product. 
In 2018, a jury in Missouri ruled in 
favor of 22 women who attributed their 
ovarian cancer to Johnson & Johnson 
talc products. The women won an 
award of $2 billion. Remember that 
number: 22 women in Missouri, an 
award of $2 billion. 
Today, there are an estimated 38,000 
people with ovarian cancer or mesothe-
lioma who have sued Johnson & John-
son, alleging that the company’s tal-
cum products caused their illness, but 
Johnson & Johnson’s use of this Texas 
two-step divisive bankruptcy means 
that these 38,000 cancer victims are no 
longer able to bring their claims 
against the company. They have lost 
their right to have their case heard in 
court because Johnson & Johnson, this 
giant company, has created a bank-
ruptcy in a shell corporation that has 
absorbed all of the legal liabilities of 
the original Johnson & Johnson. So 
anybody who wants to sue them now 
has to get in line in bankruptcy court 
with all the creditors and alleged vic-
tims and wait and hope there will be a 
day when some fraction of the trust 
fund that Johnson & Johnson gave to 
its shell company when it spun it off 
and loaded it down with legal liabil-
ities may provide some relief. The 
chances: next to none. 
Stick with me and do the math. We 
ended up with two companies. Once, it 
was just Johnson & Johnson, and then 
two companies emerged out of the 
bankruptcy court in Texas. The one 
company with the liabilities—the one 
you can actually sue if you can get 
into court—they created a trust fund 
for that company of $2 billion. They 
have 38,000 outstanding claims. Twen-
ty-women women in Missouri recovered 
$2 billion from them already, so you 
know that 38,000 people are not going 
to go very far with $2 billion total. 
What is left in the other fat corpora-
tion—profitable corporation, big cor-
poration—in that bankruptcy division? 
More than $430 billion. Johnson & 
Johnson stuck all of its assets into 
more than the healthy corporation 
that can’t be sued and left $2 billion for 
all of these victims of its dangerous 
product. What a cynical move for a 
company to make. 
Kimberly Naranjo, a mother of seven, 
is one of those 38,000 Americans who 
will lose her right to sue Johnson & 
Johnson and be forced to wait in line in 
bankruptcy court for some sliver of 
justice. 
She testified at last week’s hearing. 
Her story is not an unusual one. Ms. 
Naranjo grew up surrounded by addic-
tion and abuse. She moved from one 
foster family to another. She had her 
first baby when she was 19 years old. 
She used Johnson’s baby powder on all 
seven of her children. It was, she said, 
‘‘that white plastic bottle that I associ-
ated with motherly love.’’ 
That was the same message Johnson 
& Johnson used in its baby ads. They 
used to say their product ‘‘feels like 
love.’’ 
Ms. Naranjo started her dream job. 
But a week later, she felt a pain in her 
side. She went to the doctor and, sadly, 
learned she has mesothelioma. She was 
told she had 12 to 16 months to live. 
She knows she can’t beat mesothe-
lioma. Nobody does. All she wants is a 
chance to make her case in court be-
fore she dies so she can leave some-
thing to her kids. 
So she came to Washington to testify 
before 
us 
in 
that 
Judiciary 
sub-
committee last week, her voice rep-
resenting thousands of cancer victims 
who went through exactly what she 
did, exposing themselves to Johnson & 
Johnson’s dangerous product. I com-
mend her and thank her for her cour-
age. She is fighting for her kids and all 
the other victims, incidentally, whose 
voices would be silenced by this Texas 
two-step bankruptcy. As she said in her 
testimony, ‘‘I don’t have much time 
left, but I will not quit.’’ 
Over the past few months, I decided 
to write to Johnson & Johnson. This is 
a company that used to take such pride 
in their products. I remember all 
through my life the advertising associ-
ated with their products: wholesome, 
safe help for families. I wrote to the 
former CEO and the current CEO, and I 
urged them to change course, back way 
from this Texas two-step, abandon this 
cynical scheme, and hold yourself ac-
countable to the people who trusted 
your product. I urged Johnson & John-
son to live up to its reputation of being 
a company that family and consumers 
can trust. Sadly, they ignored me. 
This week, a bankruptcy court is 
considering a motion by talc claimants 
to dismiss the bankruptcy of the shell 
company that Johnson & Johnson spun 
off to unload its legal liabilities. It is a 
key test of this Texas two-step and 
whether wealthy corporations continue 
to abuse chapter 11 bankruptcy to 
dodge their legal obligations to victims 
like Ms. Naranjo. 
It is not just lawmakers like me who 
believe that the Texas two-step can de-
prive victims like her of their day in 
court; listen to what the author of the 
Texas divisive merger statute, Steven 
Wolens, said earlier this week about 
the law that brought the Texas two- 
step to life: ‘‘Had we known in 1989 that 
[the] provisions could be dubiously in-
terpreted for entities to avoid known 
liabilities such as those causing severe 
and permanent injuries and deaths, 
[the law] would never have passed with 
the ‘Texas two-step’ provision. Never, 
never, never.’’ 
Mr. Wolens also said: ‘‘Shame on 
[Johnson & Johnson] for trying to 
evade its liabilities for products it sold 
with its golden stamp of approval for 
safety.’’ 
When a legislator like Mr. Wolens 
publicly states that the company is in-
tentionally misusing the law he wrote, 
I don’t think there is any room for un-
certainty or equivocation; this is a 
shameful, indefensible strategy on the 
part of Johnson & Johnson. 
I hope the courts reject Johnson & 
Johnson’s abuse of bankruptcy laws, 
but I also believe Congress needs to do 
something. We need to close this loop-
hole for good. 
In July last year, I joined two of my 
colleagues, 
ELIZABETH
WARREN
and 
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL, in cosponsoring 
legislation which would rein in various 
bankruptcy loopholes like the Texas 
two-step. I am committed to working 
toward this goal. I hope Democrats and 
I hope Republicans can work together 
on a bipartisan basis to stop this bank-
ruptcy abuse. Bankruptcy is supposed 
to be a good-faith way to accept re-
sponsibility, pay one’s debts as best 
you can, and then receive a second 
chance—not a Texas two-step, get-out- 
of-jail-free 
card 
for 
some 
of 
the 
wealthiest corporations on Earth, like 
Johnson & Johnson. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the AP 
headline from last Thursday said it all: 
‘‘U.S. inflation highest in 40 years, 
with no letup in sight’’—with no letup 
in sight. That is life in the Democrats’ 
America. In January, U.S. inflation hit 
71⁄2 percent—the highest inflation since 
February of 1982. Inflation has now 
been above 5 percent for the last 8 
months. 
There are people raising families 
today who have never experienced this

February 15, 2022 
kind of inflation in their entire life-
times. American families are hurting— 
hurting badly. The average American 
household spent an estimated $3,500 
more last year as a result of inflation— 
$3,500. That is a lot of money for an or-
dinary family—a lot. Everywhere they 
turn, families are facing higher prices. 
Whether it is ground beef for the chili, 
bunk beds for the kids’ room, or a new 
car to accommodate a new addition to 
the family, higher prices are the order 
of the day. 
The price of chicken is up 10 percent. 
Pork is up 14 percent. Beef roasts are 
up 19 percent. Eggs are up 13 percent. 
Citrus fruits are up 10 percent. Whole 
milk is up 8 percent. The list goes on. 
Furniture and bedding were up 17 per-
cent. Major appliances are up almost 10 
percent. Tires are up 14 percent. Used 
cars and trucks are up 40 percent. 
And then there are energy prices. 
Fuel oil is up 46 percent. Gas prices are 
up 40 percent. Natural gas is up nearly 
24 percent—and on and on and on. 
Predictably, inflation is having its 
biggest impact on those least able to 
afford it. A recent Penn Wharton Budg-
et Model study found that lower-in-
come houses, on average, faced an even 
greater spending increase in 2021 when 
compared to higher-income households, 
as a result of inflation. 
It is no wonder 69 percent of Ameri-
cans disapprove of the President’s han-
dling of inflation. Democrats have 
talked about wage growth. Here is the 
story on wages. Despite wage growth, 
Americans received a de facto pay cut 
in 2021, thanks to inflation. Between 
January 2021 and January 2022, real av-
erage hourly earnings declined by 1.7 
percent—a pay cut. 
How did we get here? Obviously, the 
reopening of economies and supply 
chain issues have created inflationary 
pressures for the United States and 
countries around the world. But a big 
part of the reason things are so bad in 
the United States today is because 
Democrats decided to pass a massive 
so-called COVID relief bill last March 
that far exceeded anything the econ-
omy needed. That is right. When Demo-
crats took office last January, infla-
tion was 1.4 percent, well within the 
Fed’s targeted inflation rate of 2 per-
cent. 
It might have stayed there had 
Democrats not decided that they need-
ed to pass a massive and partisan $1.9- 
trillion spending spree under the guise 
of COVID relief mere weeks after Con-
gress had already passed a major 
COVID bill—one of five COVID bills, I 
might add—that passed in 2020, all bi-
partisan. 
The definition of inflation is too 
many dollars chasing too few goods and 
services. That is exactly the situation 
Democrats helped create with their so- 
called American Rescue Plan. They 
sent too many dollars into the econ-
omy, and the economy overheated as a 
result. You don’t have to take my word 
for it. Let me just quote a recent New 
York Times article: 
‘‘The United States has had much more in-
flation than almost any other advanced 
economy in the world,’’ said Jason Furman, 
an economist at Harvard University and 
former Obama administration economic ad-
viser, who used comparable methodologies to 
look across areas and concluded that U.S. 
price increases have been consistently faster. 
The difference, he said— 
This is Jason Furman, former Obama 
administration economic adviser. 
The difference, he said, comes because ‘‘the 
United States’ stimulus is in a category of 
its own.’’ 
Despite all of this, despite the fact 
that it was Democrats’ massive March 
spending spree that helped plunge our 
economy into this inflation crisis— 
there are still Democrats out there 
who want to double down—double 
down—on the strategy that helped get 
us into this mess in the first place and 
pass yet another massive spending 
spree that would undoubtedly make 
this inflation disaster even worse. 
‘‘U.S. inflation highest in 40 years 
with no letup in sight.’’ 
‘‘No letup in sight.’’ 
That was the headline. That is where 
Democrat policies have gotten us. 
I was actually pleased to hear this 
morning the Democratic leader come 
down here and talk about inflation. It 
seems to be at least—maybe because of 
polling or whatever—starting to be re-
alized by my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle that this is an issue 
that is having a massive and very ad-
verse impact on the pocketbooks of the 
American people, particularly low-in-
come Americans, because, you see, in-
flation is a tax that hits every Amer-
ican, but it affects and impacts lower- 
income and middle-income Americans 
the most. 
The Democratic leader said that Re-
publicans 
should 
quit 
complaining 
about inflation and start doing some-
thing about it. Well, we obviously don’t 
have the majority. The Democrat’s so-
lution to this, as I pointed out, is an-
other $5-trillion spending bill. Oh, 
yeah, that will solve the problem. Let’s 
flood the zone with another $5 trillion 
on top of the $2 trillion already out 
there, have even more dollars chasing 
fewer goods, driving inflation even 
higher. 
One thing we can do, what Repub-
licans have advocated, is let’s end 
wasteful spending. Let’s don’t do crazy 
stuff. Let’s don’t massively expand the 
size of government and flood the econ-
omy with more dollars at a time when 
inflation is already raging. That is a 
really simple solution. 
Another solution is not to raise 
taxes, 
which 
is, 
again, 
something 
Democrats have proposed: raising taxes 
by $1.5 to $2 trillion to partially—and I 
say partially because the cost of $5 tril-
lion doesn’t get compensated for by 
$1.5-trillion tax increase but tax in-
creases, nonetheless; all of which, of 
course, get passed on to consumers, 
raising 
inflationary 
pressures 
even 
more. They want to raise taxes mas-
sively and grow the government and 
spend money and add about $3 trillion 
to the debt, which is already $30 tril-
lion. Those are the solutions of our col-
leagues on the other side. 
I would say, end—stop in its tracks 
cold—the wasteful spending. Two, don’t 
raise taxes. Provide some certainty. 
Maybe even make permanent a lot of 
the tax relief that was put in place in 
the 2017 tax law. Three—how about 
this? How about this idea? How about 
we 
become 
energy 
independent 
in 
America, which is where we were? 
We were actually exporting energy in 
the previous administration for the 
first time in American history—at 
least in my lifetime—where we actu-
ally had energy policies that were pro-
ducing American energy on a level that 
was keeping energy costs low for Amer-
icans and enabling us to actually ex-
port energy to other places around the 
world. 
That came to an abrupt end when 
President Biden came to office. Demo-
crats got control of both Houses of 
Congress, and what happened? First 
thing, day one—day one in office, first 
day, first thing he did—President Biden 
canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline, 
which would have allowed us to get en-
ergy fuel oil from where? Our friend, 
our neighbor, Canada, the Canadians, 
and move it through a pipeline to 
places across the United States, help-
ing fill the demand with additional 
supply that Americans need to power 
their everyday lives—first thing in of-
fice, first day in office. It hasn’t 
stopped there. 
The administration decided that en-
ergy, evidently, is evil, at least if it 
comes from the ground, and decided to 
cancel a bunch of projects. There are 
all kinds of areas now that are off-lim-
its to energy exploration, energy pro-
duction in this country. There are lots 
of regulations and permitting things 
that are slowing down energy projects, 
making it more difficult, more expen-
sive to produce American energy, lead-
ing us, leading Americans, to a place 
we didn’t want to be, a place where we 
were a few years ago; but we are going 
hat in hand to Saudi Arabia, to OPEC 
countries, 
saying: 
Please, 
please 
produce more energy. We need more 
energy in this country. 
What has happened is predictable, 
and what has happened is this: The de-
mand for energy in this country is 
great. We are coming out of a pan-
demic. People are going back to work. 
They need, during the winter months, 
to heat their homes. They need fuel to 
get where they need to go—transpor-
tation—to work, to travel. So the de-
mand for energy is up, the supply is 
going down; so what is happening? 
Boom. Simple. It is really pretty sim-
ple. It is economics. The price is going 
up. So the price of oil in this country 
is now pushing $100 a barrel. Gasoline 
prices, as I mentioned, are up 40 per-
cent—40 percent—over a year ago. It is 
simple math. It is simple economics. 
And there are some Democratic Sen-
ators now who are suggesting: Let’s 
just waive the gas tax temporarily—

the gas tax which pays for all the infra-
structure that we travel on in this 
country and which would leave a huge 
hole, obviously, in the highway trust 
fund, which is critically important to 
every State in the Union that depends 
upon the Federal Government and the 
highway trust fund and the fuel tax—to 
fund the infrastructure that enables 
our economy to move and keeps us 
competitive in the global marketplace. 
That is their solution. 
Now, it is short-term—short-term, 
obviously to benefit—to try to gain 
some political advantage at a time 
when people, all of a sudden now on the 
other side, are starting to worry. Ef-
forts are being led by four Democrats 
who are up for reelection this year. No 
surprise there because they have un-
derstood now what we know, and that 
is the American people are fed up and 
frustrated—fed up and frustrated with 
policies that are driving up the cost of 
everything that they have to buy, from 
the groceries in the store, to the rent 
that they pay, to the gas they put in 
their automobiles. Everything is going 
up. 
Energy factors into almost every-
thing we do. A pound of hamburger 
that you buy at the grocery store prob-
ably had to get there from somewhere, 
unless you live in the middle of the 
country where some of us do. But if 
you live on one of the coasts, you prob-
ably had to have transportation to get 
it to the destination, so it is factored 
in—it is baked in the cost of every-
thing. When fuel prices go up, natural 
gas prices go up, when the cost of en-
ergy generally goes up, everything else 
goes up with it. It is economics. 
The solution isn’t a short-term polit-
ical ruse to try and provide political 
cover to people who are running for re-
election. It is to put policies in place 
that encourage American energy inde-
pendence, that invest in American en-
ergy. That can be done in ways now 
with technologies we have that are en-
vironmentally friendly. 
But we have to be energy inde-
pendent. We can’t depend upon other 
countries around the world that are 
unreliable to fuel and fund and run our 
economy. That investment should be 
here in the United States of America. 
And if we solve more of that, we would 
see less inflation, lower fuel prices. 
If we end the crazy spending ideas 
and tax ideas coming out of the other 
side, we could restore some sanity to 
this country when it comes to these 
out-of-control prices, which is a tax, 
literally, on every American and hits 
particularly hard those who are strug-
gling to make ends meet. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Massachusetts. 
NOMINATION OF ROBERT MCKINNON CALIFF 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak in opposition to the 
nomination of Dr. Robert Califf to lead 
the Food and Drug Administration. 
For more than two decades now, the 
United States has suffered a dev-
astating epidemic of opioid use dis-
order, overdoses, and deaths. Since 
1999, almost 1 million Americans have 
died of drug overdoses, with the vast 
majority of those deaths attributable 
to opioids. 
As our country continues to deal 
with the COVID–19 pandemic, we must 
remember and prioritize this other 
deadly public health emergency. 
In 2020, overall drug overdose deaths 
reached an alltime high for the year, 
with approximately 93,000 Americans 
losing their lives. More than 60 percent 
of those deaths were from synthetic 
opioids like fentanyl. That is a stag-
gering 69,000 Americans dead from an 
opioid-related 
overdose—more 
than 
gun violence, more than car accidents, 
more overdose deaths than ever before 
in our history. 
We cannot let the tragedy of COVID– 
19 overwhelm the daily suffering of the 
opioid epidemic. Sadly, for the scourge 
of opioid misuse and overdose in our 
country, there is no vaccine. 
My home State has been hit espe-
cially hard. In Massachusetts, more 
than 2,100 residents died from an opioid 
overdose in 2020—a 5-percent increase 
from the previous year—and many 
more struggled with opioid use dis-
order. Early data from 2021 shows this 
unfortunate trend continued through 
the first 9 months of last year, where 
1,613 people died in Massachusetts from 
opioid overdoses. 
We cite these numbers with outrage 
and disbelief, but for impacted families 
and loved ones, it is an ever-present 
mourning for lost opportunities, fu-
tures gone too soon, and unanswered 
questions; all the while, for each and 
every community, there is the growing 
challenge still to be addressed. 
In Congress, my colleagues and I 
have worked to respond to this crisis, 
passing several bipartisan packages— 
the Comprehensive Addiction and Re-
covery Act, CARA, and the SUPPORT 
Act to help bring relief to our commu-
nities. 
I am proud several pieces of legisla-
tion I authored to fund and expand 
opioid use disorder prevention and 
treatment programs became law in 
those packages. Those investments are 
important, and we must continue to 
build on them, but we cannot forget 
how we reached this epidemic in the 
first place or we are doomed to repeat 
it for those families. 
Those failures started at Big Pharma 
and were aided and abetted by the Food 
and Drug Administration. The FDA is 
supposed to be our Nation’s pharma-
ceutical gatekeeper, but over many 
years, it repeatedly rubberstamped new 
prescription painkillers that increased 
the risk of misuse and dependence. 
As evidence of the deadly harm those 
opioids caused became clear, the FDA 
did almost nothing. It acted too slowly 
to remove them from the market, to 
limit access to those supercharged 
opioids. 
What started as an OxyContin pre-
scription for back pain became full- 
blown dependence on heroin for count-
less Americans. Even well into the cri-
sis, the FDA continued to approve pow-
erful new opioids, either over the ex-
press objections of its own advisory 
committees or without convening an 
advisory committee at all. The FDA 
became the country’s biggest pill push-
er, and Big Pharma made billions in 
profits. 
The Nation’s pharmaceutical watch-
dog 
became 
the 
Nation’s 
pharma-
ceutical lapdog, and the country be-
came the ‘‘United States of Oxy.’’ I 
consistently raised concerns about the 
FDA’s egregious mishandling of opioid 
approvals when Dr. Califf was first 
nominated to be Commissioner in 2015. 
At that time, I opposed Dr. Califf’s 
nomination until the Agency took 
steps to rescind approval for pediatric 
OxyContin—yes, OxyContin for kids. I 
demanded the FDA commit to impanel 
advisory committees for all opioid reg-
ulatory decisions and consider public 
health factors in opioid regulatory de-
cisions, in particular the impact of new 
opioids on opioid misuse and depend-
ence. 
When the FDA did attempt to ad-
dress its failures in regulating opioids 
after strong criticism from me and 
many of my colleagues, Dr. Califf and 
Dr. Janet Woodcock requested a Na-
tional Academy of Sciences study of 
FDA’s policies for evaluating opioids— 
not a major step but at least an effort 
to recognize its participation in the 
epidemic. 
That study emphasized many of the 
efforts which I urged Dr. Califf and the 
FDA to undertake back in 2015; in par-
ticular, the need to include public 
health factors at every level of FDA 
regulation of opioid drugs. But to date, 
the FDA still has not implemented 
many of those recommendations. And 
where it has taken steps to do so, it has 
not gone far enough to address its past 
failures. 
There was no real commitment to re-
forming the FDA or to learning from 
the mistakes that enabled this public 
health crisis. 
At this point, the opioid epidemic has 
evolved from being driven by prescrip-
tion drugs to being fueled by the illicit 
synthetic opioids, like fentanyl. But 
that does not dismiss the FDA from ac-
countability or the need for reform. 
When I met with Dr. Califf last year, 
I asked him to commit, if confirmed as 
FDA Commissioner, to finally change 
FDA’s processes to ensure it does not 
make the opioid overdose epidemic 
worse than it already has. During our 
meeting, Dr. Califf did not commit to 
the decisive and comprehensive action 
which we need. 
After years of Agency failures and in 
the midst of a worsening opioid epi-
demic, we need FDA leadership that is 
fully committed to using all of the 
Agency’s oversight authority to pro-
tect public health. 
I cannot support Dr. Califf’s nomina-
tion in light of that critical mandate 
which we need. We need a leader at the

FDA who will center public health and 
implement reforms to its review of 
opioids. 
And, specifically, we need the FDA to 
conduct a full, comprehensive review of 
approved opioids as the National Acad-
emy of Sciences study recommends. We 
need to finalize strong rules for opioid 
approvals that require analysis of the 
impact of new drugs on opioid depend-
ency and misuse. And the FDA needs to 
be aggressive in mitigating the risks of 
approved opioids by requiring robust 
prescriber education on opioids and 
performing regular, formal reviews of 
approved opioids. 
These are not all the steps that must 
be taken, but with these, we can at 
least be sure that we are on the road to 
opioid misuse disorder reform; that 
there won’t be another FDA green light 
in front of it. 
Here in the Senate we must also com-
mit to doing more to addressing the 
opioid overdose epidemic. Prescription 
opioid medications still lack a clear, 
concise, and consistent warning label 
informing patients of the risks of the 
drug for dependence and misuse. 
Some physicians still lack the edu-
cation and tools necessary to identify 
and help patients with substance use 
disorders. And, critically, treatment 
remains inaccessible and stigmatized 
for many people in need, especially 
those ensnared in the criminal justice 
system. 
We have to pass legislation to ad-
dress these concerns, and I stand ready 
to work with my colleagues. I recently 
introduced legislation with Senator 
RAND PAUL that would modernize the 
outdated and burdensome Federal regu-
lations on methadone, one of the most 
effective forms of treatment for opioid 
use disorder. 
We can do a lot. And working with 
Senator COTTON, I worked to promul-
gate and now we need to implement the 
recommendations of the Commission 
on Combating Synthetic Opioids Traf-
ficking, and we need to do that this 
year. 
We need leaders in all branches of the 
Federal Government to bring this ag-
gressive, intentional approach to their 
work, if we have any hope of ending the 
epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. 
Dr. Califf is simply not that person 
for the FDA, and I will vote no on his 
nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today in response to Russia’s alarming 
and impending threat toward its neigh-
bor, the independent nation of Ukraine. 
As we speak, Vladimir Putin con-
tinues to ready more than 100,000 sol-
diers, tanks, artillery, aircraft, and 
missiles along Ukraine’s border. 
To Ukraine’s north, in Belarus, Rus-
sia has positioned tens of thousands 
more troops, nominally, as part of a 
military exercise. To Ukraine’s south, 
Russian ships are amassing in the 
Black Sea. 
Propaganda and disinformation are 
on the internet and on Russian TV 
channels as part of the Russian play-
book we now know very well. 
The Kremlin’s intent is to manufac-
ture a pretext for its aggression and 
sow divisions in the West. Russian 
troops already occupy vast tracts of 
Ukraine in Crimea and continue a 
‘‘low-grade’’ war in eastern Ukraine, a 
war initiated by Mr. Putin that has 
cost already over 14,000 lives. Ukrain-
ian soldiers have been bravely fighting 
and dying to protect their country 
from what has been naked aggression 
from Russia. 
We hear—even from Ukrainian lead-
ership—that their forces would face an 
unequal fight in a full-scale Russian in-
vasion and, unfortunately, probably 
couldn’t help but be outnumbered and 
overwhelmed. 
And while Moscow has amassed the 
largest 
concentration 
of 
military 
forces seen in Europe since the end of 
the Cold War, it continues to make 
shrill 
accusations 
that 
it 
is 
not 
Ukraine but somehow Russia that is 
under threat, all the while making de-
mands that Ukraine never join NATO 
or control its own destiny. 
Even as he threatens war with 
Ukraine, Mr. Putin demands to be 
treated as head of a normal govern-
ment. He thrills at being given one-on- 
one meetings with other world leaders 
or being invited to diplomatic fora. He 
rails that Russia has been unfairly sin-
gled out for sanctions. 
He demands respect, even as he lays 
out a thesis denying that Ukraine is— 
or ever was—a country with its own 
traditions, language, aspirations, or 
sovereignty. 
What Mr. Putin really fears is that if 
Ukraine succeeds in building a nation 
where Ukrainian speakers and Russian 
speakers have genuine freedoms, can 
vote in free elections and control their 
own destiny—if that happens, then 
maybe Russians may start to wonder 
why they have to live in a country 
where Putin has practically made him-
self President for life, eligible to stay 
in office until 2036, where questioning 
the endemic corruption of the Russian 
state, trying to run a business without 
paying off officials, or even expressing 
an opinion can lead to detention, 
trumped-up charges, or, as we have too 
often seen, even death from a military- 
grade nerve agent. 
Mr. Putin fears that Ukraine could 
prove to be a model of what Russia 
could become without his kleptocratic 
regime. Mr. Putin says he feels threat-
ened by NATO. He wants to go back to 
the good old days, when the USSR held 
Eastern Europe—including Ukraine—in 
its iron grip. So he has decided to seize 
chunks of Ukrainian territory and uni-
laterally change Europe’s borders. 
Now, this isn’t a new position for 
Putin. It reflects a long-held view. In 
2005, he called the fall of the Soviet 
Union ‘‘the greatest geopolitical catas-
trophe of the 20th century.’’ 
In 2008, he invaded Georgia. When 
Russian troops seized control of Cri-
mea, he sent in his ‘‘little green men’’ 
and adopted his doctrine of hybrid war-
fare. He felt unconstrained to send 
agents of the Russian state to assas-
sinate those he sees as his enemies, 
whether in Kyiv or London or Berlin or 
Sofia or Vienna. 
And he has built up his arsenal and 
threatened his neighbors. Putin, as we 
know and have read about, has crushed 
even the slightest hint of political op-
position at home in Russia—all of this 
while wanting to be seen as a victim 
and as the leader of a normal partici-
pant in the community of nations. 
These actions are not and cannot ever 
be accepted or acceptable by the civ-
ilized world. 
So what can the United States and 
the West do? President Biden and other 
Western leaders have undertaken the 
right approach offering Putin multiple 
diplomatic 
off-ramps—as 
recently, 
again, as the visit by the German 
Chancellor this week—and a dialogue 
about Russia’s exaggerated fears re-
garding European security. 
Nobody wants a military conflict be-
tween two nuclear powers so the Presi-
dent has clearly stated that U.S. troops 
are not being sent to Ukraine to fight 
Russia. 
At the same time, President Biden 
has made it extremely clear that if 
Russia rejects this diplomatic path and 
conducts further aggression against 
Ukraine, there will be a heavy price to 
pay. Russia will face the immediate 
imposition of strong, robust, and effec-
tive 
sanctions—including 
sectoral 
sanctions against its banking and fi-
nancial system as well as stringent ex-
port controls that will damage Russia’s 
economy. 
At the same time, while we do not 
want to ensure that there are any mis-
calculations or an unintended esca-
lation, the United States and European 
nations have increased their supply of 
defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure 
that Putin knows that any invasion 
will impose costs on the Russian mili-
tary. Mr. Putin may find that if he in-
vades, he may not find the going so 
easy. 
Ukrainians do not want to be part of 
Russia, especially at the point of a gun. 
As someone who has argued that Rus-
sia and Ukraine are one fraternal peo-
ple, it will be difficult for Putin to ex-
plain why Russian soldiers are dying 
while trying to kill their Ukrainian 
brothers. 
As a major part of his policy, Presi-
dent Biden has endeavored to keep 
NATO together and unified since one of 
Putin’s major goals is to undermine 
that unity. The administration’s ap-
proach is, frankly, significantly dif-
ferent from the previous President in 
this country, who undermined the 
transatlantic alliance, questioned the 
very need for its existence, and took 
every 
opportunity 
to 
weaken 
the 
shared bonds that have kept peace in 
Europe since World War II. 
President Biden, though, has put 
thousands of U.S. forces on standby

and has deployed U.S. forces to NATO’s 
eastern flank. I saw some additional 
troops from the 82nd heading over to 
Poland even as we speak. Now, again, 
these movements are not to inflame 
the situation but to ensure that there 
is no mistake about our commitment 
to NATO’s collective defense, our will-
ingness to defer aggression, and to 
make sure that we continue to bolster 
this critical alliance. The truth is, it is 
not just Americans. Other NATO mem-
bers have agreed and are sending mili-
tary forces to its eastern border to en-
sure that Putin knows that the alli-
ance stands united. 
Let us be very clear on who the ag-
gressor is in these provocations. The 
eyes of the world have been on Vladi-
mir Putin and Russia, as he has initi-
ated a steady and deliberate buildup of 
Russian forces and military assets, as I 
mentioned earlier, to the north, east, 
and south of Ukraine, and he has 
rebuffed multiple diplomatic overtures 
to deescalate the situation. Through 
media reporting, satellite imagery, and 
intelligence shared by our government 
and by the British Government, much 
of Putin’s incitement has been out in 
the open for all to see. 
It is as clear today as it will be 
through the lens of history that this 
march of aggression has been led by 
one man, and that is Vladimir Putin. 
But it is important for Putin to know 
it is not too late to back down from 
this foolish and destructive course of 
action. Even at the eleventh hour, dip-
lomatic avenues remain very much 
open. Putin can still choose against 
leading further aggression and invasion 
that would have the opposite effect 
from what he imagines. 
While there have been some reports 
in the media that he may be moving, 
we have seen no clear efforts. This is 
clearly a case that we will believe what 
the Russians do, not what some of their 
leaders say, because if Putin does in-
vade, he will have unleashed a tragedy 
not just for Ukraine but for the Rus-
sian people. Putin will rightly have 
earned the enmity of all free nations 
and people everywhere, and Russia’s 
economy and citizens will suffer. 
I want to be clear. In the event of an 
unwarranted, unjustified, and illegit-
imate attack on Ukraine, the United 
States will stand with the people of 
Ukraine. Russia will become a pariah 
nation, a rogue state. The legitimacy 
of Putin’s regime will be significantly 
undermined. And the NATO alliance 
that Putin worries so much about? It 
will be reinvigorated to fulfill the mis-
sion it was created for: as a defensive 
alliance against Soviet or, now in the 
21st century, Russian aggression. 
I urge President Putin to choose the 
right path. Deescalate tensions. Don’t 
just talk about deescalation but actu-
ally deescalate. Engage in a real and 
honest diplomatic process, and end any 
plans leading towards a violent con-
frontation in Ukraine. By doing this, 
he would ultimately spare Russia the 
crippling economic consequences that 
would be necessitated by his aggres-
sion. 
I also say, I was very proud yester-
day, when the administration briefed 
the bipartisan leadership of all the 
committees that are dealing with this 
potential invasion, to see the broad and 
bipartisan 
support 
behind 
standing 
with the people of Ukraine and the 
message that should Putin take these 
actions, the level of sanctions that we 
will impose upon him and his economy 
will be unprecedented. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that Senator BURR 
and I be permitted to speak for up to 5 
minutes each prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF ROBERT MCKINNON CALIFF 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition to the Biden administra-
tion’s nomination of Robert Califf to be 
the FDA Commissioner. 
As FDA Commissioner during the 
Obama 
administration, 
Mr. 
Califf 
showed blatant disregard for the un-
born and for the health and safety of 
women and girls when he weakened 
safety and reporting requirements for a 
dangerous chemical abortion drug. 
In fact, this past December, the 
Biden administration went further and 
announced it would eliminate entirely 
the in-person dispensing requirement 
for the abortion drug. This very reck-
less decision promotes mail order, do- 
it-yourself 
abortion-on-demand 
and 
disregards the growing threat to wom-
en’s health posed by chemical abortion 
drugs. For example, without physician 
in-person screening, women are denied 
the opportunity to be screened for dan-
gerous conditions like ectopic preg-
nancies, which can cause life-threat-
ening complications. 
Mr. Califf has refused to distance 
himself from the FDA’s decision to 
abandon vulnerable pregnant women to 
the reckless and predatory actions of 
the abortion industry. Mr. Califf has a 
track record of putting an extreme 
abortion agenda above the science. 
The nomination of Robert Califf to be 
FDA Commissioner endangers the well- 
being of unborn babies, women, and 
girls, and I urge my colleagues to join 
me in opposing his nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I actually 
rise today to support Bob Califf and to 
say to my colleagues there has been a 
lot of criticism as to what he has done. 
I have never seen an FDA Commis-
sioner, in 9 months of service—that 
was the length of his time at the 
FDA—who 
accomplished 
anything, 
much less as many negatives as have 
been raised. 
But as the ranking member of the 
HELP Committee and as a fellow North 
Carolinian, I would like to share with 
my colleagues that Dr. Califf is a su-
premely qualified nominee with bipar-
tisan support. He has the robust agency 
and private sector experience needed to 
help build on the success of the FDA in 
helping Americans get back to normal 
life with the approval of tests, vac-
cines, and therapeutics that are bring-
ing the pandemic to an end. 
He is the leader we need today but 
also for the future. Now, let me take a 
few moments to explain why. 
It has been 391 days since the FDA 
has had a Senate-confirmed Commis-
sioner—391 days. No matter how effec-
tive and successful an Acting Commis-
sioner can be—and we have been 
blessed with Janet Woodcock’s leader-
ship—the full backing of a Presidential 
nomination and confirmation by the 
U.S. Senate carry a weight that allows 
a confirmed Commissioner to push for-
ward necessary, meaningful change and 
leadership within a Federal Agency. 
There has never been a more critical 
time for the FDA to have effective 
leadership. While the FDA has long 
played a leading role in the lives of the 
American people, regulating 20 cents of 
every dollar of the U.S. economy, the 
COVID pandemic brought the actions 
of the FDA during the response to the 
dinner-table conversation of every fam-
ily in this country. 
In the 391 days since our last con-
firmed Commissioner stepped down, 
there have been two new, serious 
variants of the COVID virus; case 
counts that topped 1 million per day; 
shortages of vital therapeutics and di-
agnostic tests; and, tragically, the loss 
of hundreds of thousands of American 
lives. The FDA has and will continue 
to play a leading role in our response 
to a once-in-a-century pandemic. 
The Agency’s unprecedented work 
helped innovators bring forward coun-
termeasures, tests, treatments, and 
vaccines that have helped us withstand 
and fight against the virus and instill 
hope in Americans in some of the dark-
est moments of the pandemic. The FDA 
has made significant progress to ad-
vance medical product development. 
As new cases continue to slow and 
spring approaches, we are at what I am 
hopeful is an inflection point. Mask 
mandates are lifting, children are back 
in school, and the FDA is ready to 
move into the next phase of the re-
sponse that will hopefully bring us 
back to normal. The FDA needs a lead-
er who will not lose sight of the 
progress it has made. 
The silver lining of COVID has been 
its ability to show the value of Amer-
ican innovation and ingenuity. No one 
understands that better than Dr. Califf. 
His expertise at translational science 
means that he understands what it 
takes to transform an idea from a re-
search bench into a real solution for 
patients. 
COVID catalyzed the FDA and the 
private sector to compress the timeline 
of the transformation without—with-
out—sacrificing 
our 
world-renowned 
gold standard for safe and effective

Platform 
tech-
nologies were developed through pro-
grams like Operation Warp Speed and 
RADx that put us leaps and bounds 
ahead. These types of technologies are 
force multipliers, allowing us to bring 
new options to patients with cancer, 
infectious diseases, and life-threat-
ening conditions by adapting the same 
underlying technology. We need a Com-
missioner who understands and will ad-
vance these breakthroughs. 
I urge my colleagues, support Dr. 
Califf’s nomination because he will 
provide the leadership needed to pro-
mote today’s biomedical advancements 
and help to pave the way for tomor-
row’s innovation. 
As many know, I have been one of 
the FDA’s toughest critics over the 
years. However, I am critical because I 
believe in the Agency’s mission, and I 
know that American patients pay the 
price if the FDA falls behind. 
The FDA has an opportunity to be 
forever changed for the better, but it 
needs effective leadership to get there. 
Dr. Califf knows the Agency well, un-
derstands the value of innovation un-
derway in academia, and knows first-
hand how the private sector is advanc-
ing cutting-edge science that can ben-
efit all Americans. 
I urge my colleagues this morning to 
support the nomination of Robert 
Califf. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
in opposition to Dr. Califf, and I have 
spoken before on this. I just want to 
say this for a minute or two here. 
I respect everyone’s position on this 
and their decision, but I have never had 
anything that has affected my State 
and constituents in my State and our 
country more than the opioid addic-
tion. 
This opioid addiction started because 
of the FDA’s decision to bring a prod-
uct to market in 1995 that has de-
stroyed many families, many commu-
nities, many businesses, people’s lives 
forever. In story after story—there is 
not a Senator in this body who doesn’t 
have someone in their family, imme-
diate family or extended family, or a 
constituent who hasn’t been affected. 
With that, you need to change the 
dynamics of the leadership over there. 
Dr. Califf was there 5 years ago. He is 
coming back. Nothing has changed. 
Four hundred thousand people have 
died since he was there, and we are 
going down the same path. 
Unless we change that dynamic, that 
leadership position on trying to protect 
the people of America without putting 
more and more horrible drugs on the 
market—there was one drug back in, I 
think it was 2014, 2013 or 2014, called 
Zohydro, and the advisory committee 
recommended 11 to 2: Do not bring this 
drug to market. They did it anyway. It 
was 11 to 2, don’t do it. These are ex-
perts. They said two pills can kill a 
human being. They brought it continu-
ously. They continue to bring more 
opiates to the market. 
We don’t need this product on the 
market to kill more Americans. This 
Administration, under Robert Califf, 
will take the same old, same old as 
they did before. Nothing will change. 
I urge all of my colleagues, please 
consider what you are doing. Consider 
your family and your constituents and 
please vote against Robert Califf. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I urge 
all of my colleagues to give families 
across the country the peace of mind 
and give the hard-working staff at the 
FDA 
the 
experienced, 
Senate-con-
firmed leadership it needs by joining 
me in confirming Dr. Califf today and 
working with him and FDA to continue 
protecting families across our country, 
upholding the gold standard of safety 
and effectiveness, and putting science 
and data first. 
We previously confirmed Dr. Califf in 
this role in a bipartisan way, and we 
recently advanced his nomination out 
of the HELP Committee with bipar-
tisan support. So I hope today, once 
again, this qualified nomination passes 
with the bipartisan support it deserves. 
I yield the floor.

POSTAL SERVICE REFORM ACT 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I rise 
this afternoon to express my support 
for the Postal Service Reform Act, a 
piece of legislation that we expected to 
be on the Senate floor this week and 
look forward to it appearing shortly. 
The U.S. Postal Service has been 
struggling to stay financially solvent 
for years, and I am pleased Congress is 
finally—I say ‘‘finally.’’ I think for as 
long as I have been in the Senate and 
perhaps as long as I have been in Con-
gress, we have been working to address

February 15, 2022 
this issue, and I am pleased we are 
about to do so. 
The Postal Service has long been an 
essential piece of American commu-
nication and commerce, but its finan-
cial condition has recently, at least, 
threatened its future. Kansas’s rural 
communities, 
in 
particular, 
where 
broadband access to brick-and-mortar 
businesses is limited, rely heavily upon 
the essential services of the Postal 
Service as a means of staying con-
nected and competitive. 
The familiar sight of a U.S. Postal 
Service truck—the jeep, the truck that 
goes down our country roads making 
its deliveries—is part of the daily life 
for Kansas’s farmers, ranchers, busi-
nesses, and neighborhoods. 
For rural America, the Postal Serv-
ice—their 
mailman 
or 
their 
mailwoman—is often the glue that 
keeps those communities connected to 
the rest of the country. In many in-
stances, we rely upon our postal car-
riers to make certain that somebody is 
alive and well, that they are OK in 
their homes, and report odd behavior 
or a crime that might occur. Our postal 
carriers are a significant component of 
the fabric of our communities. 
Unique in its ability to reach nearly 
every address in America, the Postal 
Service is an indispensable piece of in-
frastructure, in fact, created by the 
Constitution of the United States giv-
ing us the instructions to provide post-
al roads. 
During the height of the pandemic, 
the Postal Service employees main-
tained their delivery routes, bringing 
essential 
medicines, 
groceries, 
and 
vital supplies to families’ doorsteps. 
We pay a lot of attention to veterans’ 
issues, and I would highlight how im-
portant the Postal Service is for those 
who served our Nation. In most in-
stances, it is how they receive their 
prescription drugs. It is beyond just 
handwritten cards and notes, although 
those are clearly important and, again, 
an important component of our life. We 
all enjoy receiving those. But the Na-
tion is reminded firsthand about the ir-
replaceable role of the Postal Service. 
As I said, in my earliest days since 
representing Kansas in Congress, I 
have advocated for the preservation of 
rural post offices and commonsense re-
forms to ensure the Postal Service’s 
stability. 
With every conversation I have had 
with the Postmaster General, I have 
reminded them perhaps they should 
spend less money on consultants and 
listen to their employees who might be 
the best people to tell them what they 
might do to improve their efficiency 
and save costs. 
When a post office closes—and we 
have had a few of those happen too fre-
quently in Kansas—it creates problems 
for businesses and families; it may 
cause significant harm to the local 
economy; and it certainly makes a dif-
ference in the lives of seniors in those 
communities. 
For the past several sessions of Con-
gress, the Senator from Delaware, Sen-
ator CARPER, and I have introduced 
postal reform legislation and worked 
together with the goal of putting the 
Postal Service on firmer financial foot-
ing, improving service, and allowing 
for the development of new revenue 
streams and enhancing transparency 
through performance metrics. 
I have indicated to the Postmaster 
General in my conversations that the 
solution to the post office’s financial 
conditions cannot be simply reducing 
services. The more services are re-
duced, the less likely Americans will or 
can use the Postal Service. 
So closing post offices, shortening 
the number of days in which mail is de-
livered, reducing the hours of the post 
office, slowing the delivery of the mail, 
closing mail-sorting centers can’t be 
the solution to making certain that 
the post office has a bright future and 
that Americans are served. 
The Postal Service Reform Act of 
2022, which I hope is on the floor soon 
for our consideration, was passed by 
the House last week, and we look for-
ward to its arrival here. It builds upon 
our previous attempts to accomplish 
postal reform. 
Included in these reforms is the cre-
ation of a new Postal Service Health 
Benefits Program and focusing on rees-
tablishing—stabilizing the USPS’s fi-
nances, instead of funding benefits in 
advance. 
The bill will allow the Postal Service 
to enter into agreements with State, 
local, and Tribal governments as a new 
method of revenue for the Agency. 
I am also pleased that the bill will 
codify 6-day delivery, which is a provi-
sion I have long supported in my role 
as an appropriator and one that greatly 
benefits rural Kansas homes, where 
mail delivery is more difficult. 
The Postal Service Reform Act rep-
resents a great step forward to ensure 
that Kansans and Americans can con-
tinue to rely upon the U.S. Postal 
Service. I am a sponsor of this bill, and 
I intend to support it when it arrives in 
the Senate for a vote and urge my col-
leagues to join me in doing so. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Alaska. 
UKRAINE 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I have asked to be recognized this 
afternoon to speak to the ongoing cri-
sis in Ukraine. 
As we all know, the current situation 
is that it is pretty tough right now. 
Russia has amassed more than 100,000 
troops on or close to Ukraine’s border 
and may be planning to launch a full- 
scale invasion within a matter of days. 
And this follows, of course, their illegal 
seizure of the Crimean Peninsula back 
in 2019 and a hybrid war in the Donbas 
that has been going on now for over 8 
years. 
As a Senator from Alaska—the State 
that is clearly most proximate to Rus-
sia—we are all too familiar with Rus-
sia’s aggressive tactics. They routinely 
fly 
near 
our 
airspace. 
They 
sail 
through our waters. They test our de-
fenses and reactions. 
In August 2020, a flotilla of Russian 
warships and military aircraft en-
croached into our EEZ, our exclusive 
economic zone, there in the Bering Sea. 
They repeatedly harassed our fisher-
men, forcing them to leave their 
waters from which their very liveli-
hood 
flows. 
The 
fishermen 
were 
shocked, I mean, just stunned with 
what they saw, and they literally left 
millions of dollars of fisheries’ assets 
out on the line. 
Provocative actions, and we felt that 
provocation. They are disturbing. They 
are alarming. But there are also some 
perhaps smaller, maybe symbolic ac-
tions that can also be a little unset-
tling. It was several years ago now that 
we were at an Arctic conference, and 
the Russian delegation gave me a dip-
lomatic gift at a conference that fea-
tured maps showing Alaska back as 
part of their territory. Maybe they 
thought it was funny; I did not take it 
as such. 
What is happening on the Ukrainian 
border is something else entirely. It is 
impossible not to be rattled by what we 
are seeing, worried by where it could 
lead. 
But I think we recognize in this body 
what we need to do, what we need to 
focus on. We need to turn these con-
cerns into resolve, and that resolve 
needs to lead to action. I know that 
there are many in this Chamber work-
ing very, very hard—and I thank them 
for that—working toward a sanctions 
package. 
The bipartisan goal is to deter both— 
to deter Russia from invading Ukraine 
but also to impose severe sanctions if 
that happens. And I know that the 
joint effort has perhaps stalled out 
right now, but, hopefully, the two sides 
and the White House will come to-
gether to finalize it. 
I believe it is an imperative that we 
have a united front on this matter. A 
united Congress on the matter of sanc-
tions, I think, is a powerful message in 
and of itself. 
If we can bring a sanctions package 
to the floor, I am going to be asking 
colleagues to consider two additions to 
that: one, to restrict imports of Rus-
sian seafood and a second related to 
Russian energy. 
So with respect to seafood, Russia 
has had an import ban on American 
seafood since 2014—since 2014. Most 
Americans don’t know that Russia re-
sponded to U.S. sanctions imposed 
after their annexation of Crimea by 
banning U.S. seafood imports, among 
other goods, at that time. So that has 
been in place all these many years. 
And it is absolutely unfair that Rus-
sia has unlimited access to sell its sea-
food in the United States, while Amer-
ica’s fishermen and our seafood proc-
essors, particularly those in my State 
of Alaska, have no access to markets in 
Russia. So this embargo either needs to 
end or we need to incorporate recip-
rocal measures.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S690 
February 15, 2022 
And when it comes to energy, we 
simply do not need U.S. dollars to be fi-
nancing Russia’s territorial aggres-
sions, especially—especially—when we 
have everything that we need here at 
home. 
There is a lot to understand about 
the crisis in Ukraine: how Russia is un-
dermining the international order and 
disrupting 
well-established 
global 
norms, how the potential for an inva-
sion threatens not just Ukraine but Eu-
ropean and global security, how an in-
vasion could lead to catastrophic esca-
lation and enormous loss of life, and 
how this situation impacts the United 
States, whether we want to involve 
ourselves or not, and how a diplomatic 
solution still exists if Russia chooses 
such a path. 
What I want to focus on today are 
two aspects of this crisis that have re-
ceived less attention so far. And the 
first is how an invasion could desta-
bilize the Arctic as part of a far-reach-
ing wave of secondary impacts. And the 
second is the role that poor energy pol-
icy has played in actually strength-
ening Russia’s hand. 
Now, I have come to this floor many, 
many times to talk about the impor-
tance of the Arctic. The United States 
is an Arctic nation because of Alaska. 
We rely on the region for everything 
from energy, minerals, seafood, ship-
ping, national defense. And we have al-
ways worked—we have always endeav-
ored to keep the High North as a region 
of peace, an area where geopolitical 
challenges 
are 
often 
compartmen-
talized in favor of collaboration and 
partnership. You need to work hard in 
remote, isolated, cold, dark places. You 
need to work together. 
So my concern today, as we are talk-
ing about Russia and Ukraine, is for 
the ripple effects that an invasion 
could have in the Arctic. I am worried 
that it will derail much of what we 
have been able to accomplish in the re-
gion and make it hard or impossible for 
the United States to trust and work 
with Russia in the region. 
I am also worried about what Rus-
sia’s brinksmanship means for our 
friends in the Arctic. Certainly, if I 
were Finland or Sweden, I would be 
looking over my shoulder right now. 
This is the type of crisis that could 
convince them to join NATO. 
At the same time, however, I cer-
tainly respect those nations’ rights and 
discretion to choose their alliances 
carefully, and discussions about them 
should include them. I also fear for the 
health of the Arctic Council, the lead-
ing governmental forum promoting co-
operation in the Arctic. Last year, I 
had an opportunity to join Secretary 
Blinken in representing the United 
States at the Council’s biannual min-
isterial. It was at that time that Ice-
land transferred the gavel to Russia, 
which is chairing the Council through 
May of 2023. 
I think it was important that Sec-
retary Blinken attend this event in 
person to reaffirm the role of the 
United States in this important gov-
erning body, but attending the meeting 
did more than that. Convening in the 
Arctic provided an opportunity for Sec-
retary Blinken to meet for the first 
time with his Russian counterpart. 
While there, the two diplomats agreed 
that while our countries have dif-
ferences, the world would be safer if we 
worked together where our interests 
intersect. One of those areas is the Arc-
tic, and we need to be able to continue 
to work together in that region. 
It is interesting to note that with all 
the ongoing diplomatic discussions be-
tween the United States and Russia 
playing out in places like Geneva and 
Paris, the first time this administra-
tion discussed the topic of troop move-
ments on the Ukrainian border with 
Russia in person was on the sidelines of 
the Arctic Council ministerial in May. 
There are very few places in the 
world that a meeting like this would be 
politically palatable for either coun-
try. Yet, for decades, the Arctic has 
provided a place for the United States 
and Russia to convene even when we 
have our differences. All you need to do 
is look back to 1986, the Reykjavik 
Summit between President Reagan and 
Premier Gorbachev. Inside a small, lit-
tle house in a small Arctic country, the 
leaders of the two biggest powers con-
vened and nearly agreed to ban all bal-
listic missiles. That meeting in Iceland 
paved the way for nuclear forces trea-
ties and the eventual end of the Cold 
War. 
But the situation we face today begs 
the question, what will become of our 
relationship with Russia in the Arctic 
if they move forward with war against 
Ukraine? 
Last week, I participated in a virtual 
meeting of the Arctic Parliamentar-
ians. This is a group composed of mem-
bers of Parliaments and Congresses of 
the eight Arctic nations. I have been 
representing the United States on the 
Standing Committee for years and 
years, decades now. These are all of the 
Arctic countries, including Russia, of 
course. But the purpose of this body is 
to promote regional cooperation, and, 
as was the norm at our meetings, we 
focused on things that are impacting 
the people in our region. This past 
week’s meeting was no different. We fo-
cused 
on 
COVID 
impacts, 
mental 
health, environmental issues, and Arc-
tic infrastructure. While the growing 
security issue was not raised, it was 
kind of an unspoken shadow. 
I throw this out there because I know 
that while I think about the Arctic 
every day, I can guarantee you that 
the Arctic is not top of mind for most 
on Capitol Hill. It took us nearly a dec-
ade to secure funding for a new ice-
breaker, which won’t be put to sea for 
another 5 years, all while Russia 
launches a new one every year. 
I want the Foreign Relations and the 
Armed Services Committees to pay 
more attention to the Arctic and to 
look to the region as both a strategic 
asset and a diplomatic tool. We often 
talk about how valuable this region is, 
but it can only be useful if we use it. I 
am afraid that sometimes we just over-
look or we neglect its importance, and 
I think it is time that we change that. 
Now, another aspect of the situation 
that I mentioned at the onset of my 
comments here is the issue of energy. 
It certainly deserves discussion when 
we look to Europe’s energy policies, 
which have only served to weaken their 
ability to respond to Russia’s aggres-
sion. This is a crisis for many countries 
in Europe, but I think it is also a time-
ly warning for us here in the United 
States. 
Europe imports about 40 percent of 
its natural gas and 27 percent of its oil 
from Russia. The Nord Stream 2 Pipe-
line would only add to that total, while 
sidelining Ukraine as a key transit 
point, and therein lies the problem. Eu-
rope is already heavily dependent on 
Russia for energy, but they are dou-
bling down. Their needs are particu-
larly acute in the depths of winter, and 
that has perhaps undermined some Eu-
ropean nations’ willingness to respond 
to Russian aggression. 
I would suggest that the Biden ad-
ministration is putting us on a similar 
path when it comes to our oil and gas. 
If they continue to shut down domestic 
resource production, we cannot magi-
cally shift to renewables and do this 
overnight. What will happen is, we will 
become more dependent on others for 
our supply. We have already seen some 
signs of this happening—perhaps not 
directly the fault of the Biden adminis-
tration but, instead, the thinking that 
it has embraced. 
Look at California. California’s for-
eign oil imports—their foreign oil im-
ports—have risen significantly over the 
past 30 years as production in their 
State and especially Alaska has de-
clined. For the last 3 years, the United 
States has actually imported more oil 
from Russia than we were allowed to 
produce in Alaska. 
So why—why—would we choose to 
forgo the jobs and revenues from do-
mestic energy production to instead 
send our dollars to Russia and others? 
It is beyond me, and so are the actions 
the Biden administration has taken 
over its first year or so in office, which 
have been explicitly designed to limit 
production from States like Alaska 
even further.

leasing for months, with an eye toward

OPEC to ask them to just produce 
more.

around the world realize they need and

they want our energy, the administra-
tion has halted Federal investment 
that helps facilitate overseas LNG ter-
minals. 
I have suggested that the President 
and his team really ought to be thank-
ful that the provisions in Build Back 
Better that target the domestic oil and 
gas industry did not go through be-
cause they would have only made the 
situation worse. 
If there were ever a moment for en-
ergy realism, it is right now. The Biden 
administration and many here in Con-
gress need to recognize the immense 
benefits of American resource produc-
tion here at home and for the rest of 
the world, and they need to see clearly 
the immense consequences of refusing 
to allow those activities to proceed. 
I will just add one further point here. 
If Russia can leverage Europe on 
Ukraine over natural gas, China can do 
the same to the United States on Tai-
wan over minerals. We are deeply, 
deeply dependent on China, and they 
are well aware they can inflict massive 
economic consequences by cutting off 
our access to a range of raw materials 
and components. 
We have to address this weakness 
through every option we have available 
to us. We certainly have opportunities 
in my State of Alaska for mines and 
mine access projects to help address 
this very real situation with our min-
erals. 
None of us know exactly what will 
happen in Ukraine. We pray for deesca-
lation. We take some solace from the 
continuation of diplomatic talks. But 
almost no one believes Russia is just 
going to walk away. All I can think is 
that we have to find ways to make it 
not worth it for Russia. Every little bit 
we can do to make this painful for Rus-
sia to prevent the loss of life, to punish 
this behavior, to call out its unwilling-
ness to be a responsible global actor— 
all we can do at this point is necessary. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SINEMA). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SPECIAL COUNSEL DURHAM COURT FILING 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to give you an exam-
ple of some of the hypocrisy that goes 
on in this town. 
On February 11, last week, Special 
Counsel Durham made another filing 
with respect to the case against Clin-
ton 
campaign 
lawyer 
Michael 
Sussmann. 
I have spoken to my colleagues be-
fore to discuss Special Counsel Dur-
ham’s findings in this matter. Today, I 
want to highlight new evidence that 
has come with this filing. 
Special Counsel Durham’s filing said 
that at trial, his team will establish 
that a firm tied to the Clinton cam-
paign misused internet traffic per-
taining to four entities: a healthcare 
provider, 
Trump 
Tower, 
a 
Donald 
Trump apartment building in New 
York, and the Executive Office of the 
President of the United States. 
The Clinton campaign essentially 
spied on the Trump campaign. After 
Trump was elected, the Clinton cam-
paign’s work continued. 
Now, how did they do it? 
According to Special Counsel Dur-
ham, the Clinton campaign worked 
with cyber researchers to infiltrate pri-
vate and government servers connected 
to Donald Trump. Their main conduit 
was Tech Executive–1. 
In July 2016, according to Special 
Counsel Durham, ‘‘Tech Executive–1 
also enlisted the assistance of research-
ers at a U.S.-based university who were 
receiving and analyzing large amounts 
of Internet data in connection with a 
pending federal government cybersecu-
rity research contract.’’ 
In addition, Tech Executive–1 had ac-
cess to dedicated servers for the Execu-
tive Office of the President as part of a 
‘‘sensitive arrangement.’’ This indi-
vidual ‘‘exploited this arrangement 
. . . for the purpose of gathering derog-
atory 
information 
about 
Donald 
Trump.’’ 
According to Special Counsel Dur-
ham, the Clinton campaign through 
Tech Executive–1 abused ‘‘non-public 
and/or proprietary Internet data.’’ 
One question that needs to be an-
swered is whether any of this exploited 
information and data included classi-
fied information. 
The available facts show that the 
Clinton campaign abused Federal Gov-
ernment contracts to exploit govern-
ment 
information 
to 
use 
against 
Trump. If the Republicans did the same 
thing, we all know you wouldn’t hear 
the end of it. The Democrats and media 
would want another impeachment of 
Trump. 
All of these outrageous acts were 
done to create fake connections be-
tween Trump and Russia. That in-
cluded the fake Alfa Bank narrative. 
That narrative centered on allegations 
that Trump had a secret communica-
tions channel with the Russian bank. It 
was all fabricated by the Clinton cam-
paign. There was nothing to it. 
And let’s not forget that Jake Sul-
livan spread the fake Alfa Bank nar-
rative, and he spread it far and wide. 
Sullivan is now President Biden’s Na-
tional Security Advisor. He needs to 
answer for his role in this entire fiasco. 
Even the Obama administration’s 
servers communicated with the same 
Russian servers that were apparently 
the basis of the false Russia connec-
tions. Now, just think how ridiculous 
this rollout was. With this so-called 
evidence against Trump in hand, on 
February 9, 2017, Sussmann provided 
updated allegations to an unnamed 
U.S. Government Agency. Of course, he 
left out the Obama administration con-
nections. 
Some of those allegations included 
that Trump and his associates used 
rare, Russian-made wireless phones 
near the White House. Durham said 
that there was no evidence of that. 
But some evidence is very, very 
clear. During the election, the Clinton 
campaign spied on the Trump cam-
paign. After Clinton lost, the Clinton 
campaign spied on the Trump adminis-
tration. And they did it by abusing 
Federal Government contracts; and 
they did it by abusing their access to 
government information. 
Trump has repeatedly said that the 
Clinton campaign spied on his cam-
paign. The mainstream media either 
ignored him or called him a liar. 
Based upon Special Counsel Dur-
ham’s filings, Trump, it turns out, was 
right. 
The Clinton campaign, mainstream 
media, and the Democratic Party did 
whatever they could do to destroy 
Trump, no matter the cost to the truth 
or the cost to the country. 
The House Democrats, with the back-
ing of corporate media, set up the Jan-
uary 6 Commission to investigate what 
they termed the Big Lie. 
Where are those on the January 6 
Commission when it comes to inves-
tigating the Big Lie where the Clinton 
Campaign worked with the sitting 
Obama administration and taxpayers’ 
money in trying to destroy their polit-
ical opponent? 
That is just as dangerous to our de-
mocracy. 
As I conclude my remarks, lets come 
to grips with this absolute fact: The 
Clinton campaign’s conspiracy of dirty 
tricks set in motion a chain of events 
that have ripped this country apart for 
years. 
So much for a peaceful transition to 
power. 
Now, what is disturbing to me about 
the hypocrisy in this town is that we 
have the First Amendment, freedom of 
press, where I see journalists as keep-
ing government honest, and I don’t see 
the people that knew that they were 
wrong about this issue for 4 or 5 years 
willing to admit that now they haven’t 
done their job properly. 
And a lot of things that made govern-
ment dishonest—and I just told you 
how this was done—don’t seem to be 
worried about policing the political 
system the way they should. 
I haven’t seen anybody apologize. 
I did see a rerun of something that 
happened October 2020 within the last 
couple of days, an interview between 
one of these journalists and President 
Trump where President Trump was 
trying to tell people that this stuff was 
going on, and they said, No, there is no 
proof of it. There is no proof of it. 
Are they saying today there is no 
proof of that? 
I think we all know that Trump 
wasn’t in government. Maybe he even 
lacked some understanding of how the 
political system works, but he came to 
town to challenge the elite that are in-
side the beltway and change things.

And somebody knew that he was up to 
that, and they wanted to stop him from 
doing it; so they spied on the campaign 
so he wouldn’t be elected. And once he 
was elected, they spied on the Execu-
tive Office to see what they could do. 
I remember a story that a friend of 
mine told me about talking to some 
Democratic Senator in February of 
2017, who told that friend of mine that 
Trump would not be President by the 
end of that year of 2017. Now, whether 
that Senator knew what he was talking 
about, I don’t know; but I reflect back 
on that conversation I had with that 
friend, and I wondered if they really 
thought that by doing what we know 
now they were doing, that they were 
going to be able to get him out of office 
before the end of 2017. So I give you a 
little example of what I call hypocrisy 
in this city. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the economy. 
You know, right now, inflation is at 
a record high. At the same time, what 
we are seeing is that Joe Biden’s ap-
proval rating by the people all across 
this country is at a record low. And 
there is a connection. 
This morning, the majority leader 
came to the floor of the Senate and 
said that Democrats were going to talk 
about inflation at their policy lunch 
today—today, 
February 
15, 
2022—13 
months after Joe Biden took office. 
Democrats have been in power for al-
most 13 months. They control the 
White House. They control the Senate. 
They control the House of Representa-
tives. Ten months into this inflation 
crisis, what they are doing is putting 
forward gimmicks, not solutions. 
They want to get past the upcoming 
election. They don’t want to get to 
long-term solutions for our Nation. 
On Thursday, the world found out 
that prices in the United States had 
risen at their fastest pace in 40 years, 
and of course that was the same day 
that 
Joe 
Biden’s 
approval 
rating 
dropped to 40 percent. 
The American people are getting 
squeezed financially. They are feeling 
the pain, and they are furious with 
President Biden. Since Joe Biden be-
came President, wages have gone up 
slower than prices. Prices have gone up 
faster than wages. People can’t keep 
up. It is hard to even stay even. As a 
result, the American family today can 
afford a lot less than it could the day 
that Joe Biden took office. Over the 
last year, inflation outpaced wages by 
over $1,400. That is an over-$100-a- 
month differential. 
So who gets hurt the worst when 
your wages fall behind the increasing 
costs of Joe Biden’s economy? 
Well, it is families who are strug-
gling; it is young couples; it is people 
living on fixed incomes; it is people 
trying to go to work every day to put 
bread on the table. In other words, the 
people who are hurt the most are the 
people who can afford it the least. They 
are feeling the pain and paying the 
price every time they go to the grocery 
store and every time they go to the gas 
pump. 
Big price increases have occurred in 
energy. CNBC reports that one in five 
American families couldn’t afford to 
pay the energy bill over the past year. 
The same number, roughly, kept their 
homes 
at 
an 
uncomfortable 
and 
unhealthy temperature because they 
can’t afford the cost of energy to heat 
them. Many have had to choose wheth-
er they are going to heat or to eat. Gas 
prices have gone up by over $1 a gallon 
since Joe Biden became President. 
American energy production is still 
not to the level that it was before the 
pandemic. We are still producing 1.2 
million fewer barrels of oil each day 
than we were before the pandemic. We 
are not producing it here, but—oh, by 
the way—Vladimir Putin is selling 5 
million barrels a day of crude oil in the 
international markets. This is a direct 
result of the anti-American energy 
policies of Joe Biden and his entire ad-
ministration and the Democratic Party 
in this country. People understand 
simple supply and demand. When the 
supply goes down and the demand stays 
the same or goes up, prices go up as 
well. 
It is also what happened with Amer-
ica’s workforce. The Democrats created 
the worst labor shortage in American 
history. We have broken records for un-
filled jobs in 5 of the last 12 months. 
So when did it start? 
Well, it started in March of this past 
year, when Democrats passed their $2 
trillion spending bill, which was not 
paid for and added to the debt, and the 
bill gave a bonus payment for people to 
stay home from work. People were get-
ting paid more not to go to work than 
they were able to make had they gone 
to work. 
What happened when the bonuses ran 
out? 
Joe Biden imposed a national vaccine 
mandate, saying that if you don’t get 
the vaccine, you lose your job. The vac-
cine mandate took a sledgehammer to 
the American workforce. According to 
one survey, half of America’s small 
businesses couldn’t find enough work-
ers in just this past December. If you 
drive around Wyoming, you will see 
‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs all around my 
home State. What happens when you 
have fewer workers? It means empty 
shelves and higher prices. When supply 
goes down, prices go up. 
Now the opposite is also true. That is 
what we have seen with the value of 
the dollar. Last March, Democrats 
flooded the country with government 
cash. Now the dollar, in many people’s 
wallets and pocketbooks, doesn’t go as 
far as it did before. 
Democrats passed the largest single 
spending bill in American history. 
They put $2 trillion on the Nation’s 
credit card. Republicans warned: Do 
not do this. It will cause inflation. 
Democrats didn’t listen. Every single 
Democrat in this Senate voted for it; 
every single Democrat voted for it; 
every single Republican voted against 
it; and Joe Biden signed it. 
Since then, prices have gone up fast-
er than wages. First, they said it was 
going to be temporary. Then, astonish-
ingly, in July, Joe Biden said inflation 
was expected. He kind of bragged that 
he had seen it coming all along. Well, if 
he had seen it coming all along, why 
didn’t he do something about it? All 
that this President has done is put jet 
fuel on the fire of inflation. He told us 
inflation would be transitory, and he 
said it month after month, after 
month, after month. He can’t say it 
anymore. Oh, no. Inflation is here, and 
people are paying the price and feeling 
the pain. 
Last week’s inflation report should 
be a blaring siren to the Democrats in 
Washington, and I was so happy to hear 
the majority leader, this morning, say-
ing, finally, today, at lunch, February 
15, 2022, that the Democrats were going 
to start talking about inflation at 
their policy lunch today. They should 
all be suffering from significant indi-
gestion. 
This is a crisis, and Democrats are 
doing nothing about it. The Democrats 
borrowed trillions of dollars this year. 
This week, Democrats in the House 
are talking about getting rid of the 
debt ceiling completely—of spending 
more. They are talking about a blank 
check, unlimited borrowing, and tril-
lions and trillions more in spending, 
which will only mean higher and high-
er inflation. 
Inflation will not go away on its own. 
Democrats need to stop the reckless 
spending. They need to stop the nation-
wide mandates. They need to stop shut-
ting down American energy. The Amer-
ican people cannot afford any more 
records like the ones that Joe Biden is 
setting right now. 
I yield the floor.

ator from North Carolina. 
NOMINATION OF GIGI SOHN 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I al-
ways strive to treat each and every 
nominee—regardless of party affili-
ation—with dignity and respect. I 
evaluate their credentials and make a 
decision on whether to support them 
based on their qualifications, their 
temperaments, and whether they will 
serve the interests of all of the Amer-
ican people. 
That is actually why, in my role on 
the Judiciary Committee, I have voted 
for almost half of President Biden’s 
nominees. In my judgment, some were 
qualified and deserved confirmation, 
and in my judgment, some weren’t. 
Again, I evaluate each nominee on an 
independent and fair basis. With this in 
mind, I hope my colleagues will take 
seriously what I have to say today. 
I rise to speak in opposition to, per-
haps, one of the most radical nominees 
the President has put forward to date.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S693 
February 15, 2022 
I am talking about the nomination of 
Gigi Sohn to be an FCC Commissioner. 
Ms. Sohn is exactly the type of rad-
ical activist we should avoid con-
firming to lead any Agency, especially 
an Agency as critical as the FCC. Her 
radical activist track record and her 
out-of-the-mainstream views on every-
thing from free speech to intellectual 
property 
indicate 
to me she will 
weaponize the FCC against the Amer-
ican people. 
Ms. Sohn has made no secret of the 
fact that she loathes Republicans, con-
servatives, and any media organization 
that doesn’t share her world view. One 
need look no further than her deeming 
FOX News as ‘‘state-sponsored propa-
ganda.’’ She has supported State gov-
ernments and used their power to de-
stroy conservative news outlets. When 
California’s liberal legislature tried to 
pressure broadcasters into dropping 
conservative news organizations, she 
supported—yes, she supported—their 
effort. 
It doesn’t stop there. If confirmed, 
she will have the power to censor con-
servative media and retaliate against 
any view that is different from her 
own. 
Worse than her disdain—probably 
even hatred—for conservative news 
media, she has also made it clear that 
she simply detests Republicans as peo-
ple. She has claimed Senate Repub-
licans are a threat to ‘‘our Republic’’ 
and claimed their ‘‘ideology has over-
taken their duty to serve their con-
stituents.’’ She even claimed that Re-
publicans can only win elections by 
‘‘suppressing the vote’’ and destroying 
democracy. 
As someone who won reelection in a 
State with a nearly 80-percent turnout 
in the last election, I can tell her that 
that isn’t the case. 
As if her disdain for conservative 
media and Republicans isn’t enough, 
she has also demonstrated she is a rad-
ical, anti-copyright activist who will 
use every lever of power at her disposal 
to harm America’s content creators. 
For years, she dismissed the eco-
nomic harms that our outdated copy-
right laws have caused content cre-
ators. She belittled their demonstrated 
pain and suffering, and she opposed ef-
forts to fix the failed copyright system. 
During her time at the FCC as a senior 
adviser to FCC Chairman Tom Wheel-
er, Sohn championed the FCC’s at-
tempt to unlock pay-TV set-top boxes. 
This disastrous policy would have de-
stroyed the intellectual property rights 
of copyright owners to the benefit of 
big tech companies like Google, and 
these big tech companies have conven-
iently funded Sohn over the years. 
She has never apologized for this dis-
astrous policy. In a 2016 op-ed, Sohn 
downplayed any concerns with this 
proposal by proposing only a hypo-
thetical solution to address them. 
Finally, anyone who doubts her rad-
ical views on intellectual property 
need look no further than to the fact 
that she literally served on the board 
of directors of a company named 
Locast, whose sole purpose was to en-
gage in illegal copyright infringement. 
Let that sink in. 
Gigi Sohn, a longtime anti-copyright 
activist who worked on policies at the 
FCC 
to 
destroy 
copyright 
owners’ 
rights, then subsequently served on the 
board of a company that made money 
by infringing on copyright and likely 
made money from the illegal activity 
in the process and, not only that, I 
have real concerns that she appears to 
be hiding relevant information to the 
lawsuit. She failed to disclose the fact 
that the amount of money exchanged 
by Locast was much lower than the re-
ported $32 million settlement. As an 
explanation, she stated that she an-
swered the questions within the con-
fines of the settlement agreement. 
Playing ‘‘hiding the ball’’ while seek-
ing a position of public trust is not ac-
ceptable. I believe her nomination 
would undermine public confidence in 
the FCC and our government. 
If this were any other nominee, espe-
cially a Republican nominee, any one 
of these issues would be enough for my 
colleagues on this side of the aisle to 
stand up and ask the President of our 
party to withdraw the nominee. I hope 
my Democratic colleagues will review 
Ms. Sohn’s record, just like I have, in a 
fair and impartial manner, and reach 
the only reasonable conclusion; that 
she cannot and must not be confirmed. 
I again call on President Biden to 
withdraw the nomination of Gigi Sohn. 
If he won’t, I hope I can count on 51 
Senators to stand with me and make it 
clear that we won’t allow such a rad-
ical activist to be confirmed to the 
FCC.

ator from Tennessee. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 512 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, 
for nearly 2 years, the U.S. Capitol 
Building and Senate offices have been 
largely closed to the American people 
whom we serve. Our constituents have 
been unable to enter the Senate build-
ings to meet with their representa-
tives, and Americans of all ages, from 
schoolchildren to seniors, have been de-
prived of the patriotic sense of wonder-
ment that comes from visiting the hal-
lowed halls of the Capitol Building. 
The openness of the Halls of Congress 
and public participation in the legisla-
tive process have always been hall-
marks of American democracy. 
It is long past time for the Senate to 
reopen its doors to the American peo-
ple. Thanks to Operation Warp Speed, 
vaccines have been available for more 
than a year for those who want them. 
Americans have learned how to safely 
gather and enter public places despite 
the pandemic. Over 70,000 people at-
tended the Super Bowl in Los Angeles 
on Sunday, in fact. Yet there are re-
ports that some of the leadership in 
this building want to significantly 
limit the number of lawmakers who are 
allowed to attend President Biden’s 
State of the Union Address in just a 
couple of weeks. 
From stores to venues and most 
workplaces and schools, the rest of the 
United States has reopened to gath-
erings and regular business. Shouldn’t 
the Senate, whose buildings belong to 
the public, do the same? That is why I 
have introduced a resolution providing 
that the Senate, first, recognizes the 
importance of reopening the Capitol 
and Senate office buildings to the pub-
lic and, second, supports returning to 
the pre-COVID visitor policies for areas 
within 
Senate 
jurisdiction. 
I 
am 
pleased that 26 of my colleagues have 
joined me as cosponsors of this resolu-
tion. 
Importantly, if there are operational 
matters that need to be worked out as 
part of reopening, this resolution pro-
vides no obstacle to doing so. It simply 
states that the Senate supports reopen-
ing and recognizes the importance of 
doing so. 
I am asking my colleagues to join me 
today in support of the access to Amer-
ican democracy and a return to normal 
life and in opposition to endless pan-
demic lockdown, and I am pleased to be 
joined here today by my colleague from 
Indiana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, as 
ranking member of the Legislative 
Branch Appropriations Subcommittee, 
I rise today in support of the Senator 
from Tennessee’s resolution to reopen 
the Capitol and the Senate office build-
ings. As he said, for nearly 2 years, we 
have not been operating from what I 
was used to for the short time I had 
been here prior to that. Governors 
across the country finally are begin-
ning to do the same thing, even in 
places where they were almost in lock-
step with the way we were doing things 
here. 
Today, you can only enter the Cap-
itol Complex with an escort by a staff 
member. One of the things constituents 
from back in Indiana enjoyed most— 
the senior Senator from Indiana, TODD 
YOUNG, started it before I got here— 
was the Hoosier Huddle. From 9 to 10 
every Tuesday, every Wednesday, we 
had folks from all over our State com-
ing into the Capitol so we could have 
that conversation on issues that were 
important. Now we do it by Zoom. 
The rest of the country is saying: 
Enough is enough; we want to get back 
to at least some of the ways that were 
in place prior to COVID. 
Now, Washington lobbyists are al-
lowed in because of their close connec-
tions with congressional staff, but the 
American people don’t have that same 
access, and that is just wrong. 
The legislative branch Agencies have 
continued to provide support to Con-
gress throughout the pandemic. It is 
time that Congress reopens the Capitol 
to the American public, including Hoo-
siers from my home State. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, as 
if in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S694 
February 15, 2022 
to the consideration of S. Res. 512, sub-
mitted earlier today. Further, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resolution 
be agreed to, the preamble be agreed 
to, and that the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
reserving the right to object, I object. 
As chair of the Rules Committee, 
with oversight of the security of this 
Capitol, I share Senator HAGERTY’s 
goal and Senator BRAUN’s goal of en-
suring that this building is open and 
accessible to the public. I agree with 
them that it is important to reopen the 
Capitol, and I personally can’t wait to 
have my constituents back as well for 
our Thursday morning breakfasts. But 
we must do this in a way that takes 
into account the health and safety of 
everyone who works here and not just 
the Senators. 
This is a decision for the Capitol Po-
lice Board, in consultation with the 
medical experts in the Office of Attend-
ing Physician. 
While the worst of the Omicron surge 
is behind us—and that is such a good 
thing—they have told us there is still 
work to do. At the same time—and I 
think this is one of our challenges as 
we look at how we are reopening and 
how we do it, because I think we will 
end up doing this incrementally, and I 
hope we can start soon—at the same 
time, ongoing staffing challenges fac-
ing the Capitol Police are an important 
consideration that must be managed 
carefully by the Capitol Police Board. 
The 
Capitol 
Police 
are 
already 
stretched thin. More than 130 officers 
have left the force since the January 6 
insurrection last year. 
At a Rules Committee hearing that I 
held with Senator BLUNT
just last 
month, Chief Manger testified that the 
Department is down 447 officers. Let 
me repeat that: 447 officers. The offi-
cers who remain have had vacations 
canceled and have worked significant 
overtime. 
The 
Department, 
as 
we 
learned at our oversight hearing—we 
had two in the last 3 months—has 
taken steps—and I personally asked 
about this, Senator HAGERTY, because I 
care so much about reopening the Cap-
itol—they have taken steps to address 
these shortfalls, including addressing 
the number of recruit classes, with the 
goal of recruiting 280 officers per year 
for the next 3 years. That is additional 
officers. The Department has also 
taken steps to retain officers already 
on the force, including by issuing re-
tention bonuses and hazard pay. 
We took a very important step last 
summer on a bipartisan basis to pro-
vide funding for security improvements 
at the Capitol and to ensure that the 
Capitol Police have the resources to do 
their jobs when we passed the emer-
gency funding bill led by Senator 
LEAHY and Senator SHELBY that the 
President signed into law. But, as Chief 
Manger just said at a public hearing 
when he explained that we were 447 of-
ficers short—which, of course, means 
who is the at the doors, what doors are 
open, and what backup do they have— 
he said we still have a ways to go be-
fore he has officers to staff all the 
posts needed to safely reopen to the 
public. 
So there is still much more work to 
do. I, for one, am in favor of making 
changes so we can begin the process of 
reopening as soon as possible. The Cap-
itol Complex should, of course, reopen 
so Americans from across the country 
can visit and see our democracy at 
work. We are simply relying on the 
health and security experts to ensure 
that how and when we do reopen, we do 
it safely for everyone who works here, 
including the staff. 
For these reasons, Madam President, 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
greatly respect my colleague from Min-
nesota, and I have enjoyed working 
with her on the Rules Committee, but 
her objection to this resolution pro-
vides an unfortunate but clear answer: 
No, Democrats don’t support reopening 
the Senate. 
Hopefully sometime soon, my Demo-
cratic colleagues will wake up to the 
fact that Americans are sick of endless 
lockdowns and the condescending mes-
sage that it sends to the American peo-
ple that they need government to tell 
them what to do. 
With regard to the objection that we 
need a more measured process in con-
sultation 
with 
various 
officials, 
I 
talked to the Capitol Police Chief last 
week, and we can work with his team 
and the Sergeant at Arms to address 
any specific operational issues. We can 
also work with the Attending Physi-
cian. All of that is downstream of the 
basic question here, which is whether 
the Senate supports reopening. If the 
Senate supports reopening, then we can 
figure out the rest. 
Senate leadership sets the policy for 
the Capitol Building and the office 
buildings that are under Senate juris-
diction. That is why we have different 
COVID policies than the House. If it 
was up to the Attending Physician or 
the Capitol Police, the policy probably 
wouldn’t change at the midpoint of the 
Capitol Building, as it does today. 
We are the elected officials in the 
building. We are the ones who were 
elected 
to 
make 
decisions. 
We 
shouldn’t dodge that responsibility, 
and we need to lead by making a clear 
statement that it is time to reopen the 
Senate to our constituents. It is unfor-
tunate that many of my Democratic 
colleagues don’t feel the same way. We 
need to reopen the Senate now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, over the past year, the Biden ad-
ministration has put out some truly 
absurd propaganda, but last week, they 
released something that was so over 
the top that I had to double-check to 
make sure that it was real. Yes, of 
course, it has up here that it was issued 
February 7, 2 p.m., and it is going to 
expire June 7 of this year at 2 p.m. It 
had all the markings of something that 
was legitimate, but it is so outrageous 
that I confirmed that it was actually a 
government-issued document. 
Of course, I am referring to the 
Homeland Security memo that is sum-
marizing the current terror threat to 
the United States. Under normal cir-
cumstances, you would expect a threat 
assessment to be a helpful document. 
That is what we have come to expect. 
But in this case, it wasn’t obvious be-
fore, but now it is so obvious. It is crys-
tal clear that conventional definitions 
of the word ‘‘normal’’ no longer apply 
to this administration. 
If you have not read this, you will 
not believe your eyes. What makes it 
so uniquely infuriating is the ease with 
which DHS used an official document 
to equate violent terrorists with Amer-
icans who refuse to fall in line with the 
Biden administration’s narrative of the 
day. They did it so easily, just laying 
out their case of threat assessments to 
the United States. 
Alongside descriptions of actual vio-
lence and threats against churches and 
schools, DHS warns of ‘‘the prolifera-
tion of false or misleading narratives, 
which sow discord or undermine public 
trust in U.S. Government institu-
tions.’’ The bulletin specifically identi-
fies ‘‘widespread online proliferation of 
false or misleading narratives regard-
ing unsubstantiated widespread elec-
tion fraud and COVID–19’’ as ‘‘[k]ey 
factors . . . contributing to the current 
heightened threat environment.’’ 
Yes, you heard me correct. They 
identify widespread online prolifera-
tion of false and misleading narratives 
regarding unsubstantiated widespread 
election fraud and COVID–19. 
So let’s decode this. They are not 
just talking about acts of violence 
committed to achieve a political or an 
ideological 
goal; 
they 
are 
talking 
about dissent. What does DHS suggest 
someone do if they find themselves 
menaced in the court of public opinion? 
They want you to report the offender 
to law enforcement. That is right—re-
port the offender to law enforcement. 
I have come to the floor time and 
again to detail just how frightened the 
American people are of Joe Biden’s 
radical agenda, but this bulletin is the 
best evidence I have seen to date of 
just how frightened Joe Biden is of the 
American people. They must be scared 
to death over there in that White 
House. How dare anybody question 
them? How dare anybody call them 
into question for the agenda that they 
have? I would even go so far as to sug-
gest that this betrays his administra-
tion’s desire to police the speech,

thoughts, and opinions of American 
citizens and to deputize the public to 
help keep dissenters in line. 
The Biden administration is as close 
as they ever have been to declaring 
that expressing public disagreement 
with their agenda is akin to an act of 
domestic terrorism. Think about this. 
It isn’t just an outrage; it is dangerous 
for a few different reasons, the most 
important of which is that it ignores 
the line differentiating violence and 
threats 
from 
constitutionally 
pro-
tected speech. The former have no 
place in public discourse. Let me be 
very clear about that. The former have 
no place in public discourse. The latter 
is essential to the functioning of our 
democracy. 
Indeed, this Nation’s democracy—one 
of the reasons we have stayed free and 
have stayed a democratic republic is 
because we share respect for robust, re-
spectful political debate. But it ap-
pears, with this administration, they 
have thrown that out the window to 
say: It is our way or it is the highway. 
We don’t want to hear any dissent. We 
don’t want to hear a point, a counter-
point. We don’t want to entertain an 
objection. We are busy. We are busy 
pushing our socialist agenda. We don’t 
have 
time 
for 
free-thinking, 
inde-
pendent 
individuals 
to 
raise 
their 
hands and ask a question. It is ‘‘get in 
line’’ time. We have a short window. 
We have to make this happen. 
I would suggest also that it cheapens 
the horrors of actual terrorism and di-
lutes the perceived danger of violent 
extremism. It is an insult to the memo-
ries of those who died in the September 
11 attacks and the Oklahoma City 
bombing and to those who were at gun-
point at a Colleyville, TX, synagogue. 
But lastly and most despicably, it sug-
gests that Americans will never be safe 
until we consent to live in a constant 
state of fear. According to this bul-
letin, security is impossible in the face 
of dissent. It betrays a nightmarish 
and completely un-American end game. 
Today, I sent a letter to Secretary 
Mayorkas urging him to make it clear 
that this is just sloppy communication 
on their part. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have that letter printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
FEBRUARY 15, 2022. 
Hon. ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, 
Secretary of Homeland Security, U.S. Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, Washington, 
DC. 
DEAR SECRETARY MAYORKAS: On February 
7, 2022, the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity (‘‘the Department’’) issued a National 
Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin (‘‘the 
Bulletin’’) that summarizes the current ter-
rorism threat to the United States. Among 
other terrorism threats, the Bulletin warns 
of ‘‘[t]he proliferation of false or misleading 
narratives, which sow discord or undermine 
public trust in U.S. government institu-
tions.’’ The Bulletin specifically identifies 
‘‘widespread online proliferation of false or 
misleading narratives regarding unsubstan-
tiated widespread election fraud and COVID– 
19’’ as ‘‘[k]ey factors contributing to the cur-
rent heightened threat environment.’’ To 
combat these threats, the Bulletin rec-
ommends that Americans report ‘‘potential 
threats’’ and ‘‘maintain digital and media 
literacy to recognize and build resilience to 
false or misleading narratives.’’ 
I am concerned about the appearance of 
the Department of Homeland Security polic-
ing the speech, thoughts, and opinions of 
American citizens. In issuing this Bulletin, 
the Department of Homeland Security ap-
pears to endorse particular narratives re-
garding controversial issues that are at the 
center of our national political conversation. 
By identifying dissenting beliefs as ‘‘[k]ey 
factors contributing to the current height-
ened threat environment,’’ the Department 
comes dangerously close to suggesting that 
publicly disagreeing with the current admin-
istration is akin to domestic terrorism. And 
by associating opinions that deviate from 
this administration’s chosen narrative with 
terrorism threats—and asking the public to 
report these ‘‘threats’’—the Department of 
Homeland Security is chilling public dis-
course across the country. 
I urge you to make very clear to the Amer-
ican public that the Department of Home-
land Security does not consider those who 
disagree with this administration to be do-
mestic terrorists. I further urge you to clar-
ify that the Department will not interfere 
with the rights of all Americans to speak 
publicly about their political views, includ-
ing any views that might conflict with the 
policies and political talking points of this 
administration. 
As the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
you took an oath to uphold our Constitution. 
Enshrined in the Constitution is the freedom 
of speech, and that includes the right to 
question the government and its preferred 
narrative. Speech that questions the Presi-
dent’s position regarding issues like the 
COVID–19 pandemic and election law reform 
falls within the heart of the First Amend-
ment’s protections. In fact, the Supreme 
Court has made it abundantly clear that this 
kind of ‘‘core political speech’’ is ‘‘the pri-
mary object of First Amendment protec-
tion.’’ It is your duty as the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to ensure that your De-
partment does not interfere with this core 
protected speech in any way. 
To be clear, violence and true threats of vi-
olence are not constitutionally protected 
speech and have no place in our public dis-
course. There are real threats to the United 
States, our homeland. and our citizens from 
malign foreign governments and terrorists. 
The Bulletin correctly recognized this fact 
and aptly referenced the January 15, 2022 at-
tack on a synagogue in Colleyville. Texas as 
an example of the continuing threat of vio-
lence that our nation faces. The Department 
of Homeland Security is charged with pro-
tecting Americans from these true threats. 
The Department should not, however, police 
the public discourse of American citizens 
simply because that discourse might ‘‘sow 
discord or undermine public trust in U.S. 
government institutions.’’ Indeed, robust 
public debate—including debate that ques-
tions the government and its policies—is 
central to any functioning democracy. 
Many Americans have expressed doubts re-
garding topics like COVID–19 mask mandates 
and the origins of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Many others have voiced frustration regard-
ing state and federal election laws. Whether 
this administration agrees with these views 
is irrelevant; the First Amendment protects 
all of them from government interference. I 
urge you to revise the Bulletin to make clear 
to the American public that it is decidedly 
not the role of the Department of Homeland 
Security to enforce particular narratives or 
to quash the speech of those who disagree 
with this administration. 
Sincerely, 
MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
United States Senator. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I would also like to briefly quote 
for the record precisely what I asked 
him to do: 
I urge you to make very clear to the Amer-
ican public that the Department of Home-
land Security does not consider those who 
disagree with this administration to be do-
mestic terrorists. I further urge you to clar-
ify that the Department will not interfere 
with the rights of all Americans to speak 
publicly about their political views, includ-
ing any views that might conflict with the 
policies and political talking points of this 
administration. . . . I urge you to revise the 
Bulletin to make clear to the American pub-
lic that it is decidedly not the role of the De-
partment of Homeland Security to enforce 
particular narratives or to quash the speech 
of those who disagree with this administra-
tion. 
This is a very simple request. My 
hope is that Secretary Mayorkas recog-
nizes his obligation to put everyone at 
ease by fulfilling it. 
I can guarantee there are people in 
my beloved Tennessee who are very 
upset, as they have read this bulletin, 
because they treasure their free speech. 
They treasure the ability to have ro-
bust political debate. They like talking 
with their friends and neighbors and 
having those discussions and seeing if 
they can pull them to their side of an 
issue, whether it is a local, State, or a 
Federal issue. They want to preserve 
that freedom. 
This memo says that freedom does go 
away, that it overrides the Constitu-
tion, that it overrides the rule of law. 
If you do it, somebody can report you, 
and it will be considered something not 
tolerated by this administration. 
The Biden administration put out 
this bulletin to highlight a particular 
danger, but the real danger lies in the 
document’s subtext. 
Even if Secretary Mayorkas makes 
good on his oath to defend the Con-
stitution and if he moves forward to re-
vise the bulletin, I fear much damage 
has already been done. Through this 
document, the Biden administration 
has made it abundantly clear that they 
view dissent as a threat and that pun-
ishing dissent is the cost of maintain-
ing public safety. 
I wish I could dismiss this as yet an-
other political spat, but the White 
House is the world’s biggest and most 
powerful bully pulpit. When the Biden 
administration talks, people listen, and 
they take them seriously. 
If what I have laid out today is not 
the position of the Biden administra-
tion, it is their obligation to speak up 
and to correct the record. If it is their 
position, it is our obligation as elected 
representatives to put ourselves be-
tween the American people and any of-
ficial who would dare tolerate such a 
dystopian power grab.

Also, we should remind those offi-
cials that how they feel about our con-
stitutional right to dissent is abso-
lutely irrelevant.

Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

NOMINATION OF SARAH BLOOM RASKIN 
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I 
rise today regarding President Biden’s 
nominees to the Federal Reserve. I just 
came from the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs, where we 
met in order to advance an extraor-
dinary group of candidates who were 
nominated to the Federal Reserve. As 
our Nation’s top economic policy-
makers, 
these 
nominees 
will 
be 
charged with steering our country 
through one of the most difficult envi-
ronments the Fed has faced in many 
years. But Republicans have decided to 
block any attempt for the Banking 
Committee to consider this group. 
Why? Because they object to one of the 
nominees, whom they have pummeled 
with particularly desperate attacks. 
Professor Sarah Bloom Raskin will 
bring deep experience to the role of the 
Fed’s Vice Chair for Supervision. Dur-
ing the height of the 2008 financial cri-
sis, she was on the frontlines as the 
State of Maryland’s top financial regu-
lator. As our country slogged through 
the aftermath of the crisis, Professor 
Raskin was a Governor of the Federal 
Reserve, facing difficult policy deci-
sions as she worked to help families re-
build. She then served as Deputy 
Treasury Secretary, helping to shep-
herd our Nation through the postcrash 
economic 
expansion—an 
expansion 
that has turned out to be the longest 
on record right up until the pandemic 
struck. 
Professor Raskin has unparalleled ex-
pertise in both the monetary policy 
and financial regulatory components of 
the job. Few people in the entire Na-
tion are as qualified for this role as she 
is. 
Now, I understand that Republicans 
are launching hysterical attacks on her 
over climate issues—never mind that 
her views align with those of the rest 
of the nominees; never mind that she 
has a history of sound judgment at the 
Fed; never mind that community bank-
ers have spoken glowingly of how well 
she worked with them during a time of 
great stress; never mind anything. 
The Republicans are also launching 
bad-faith attacks about ethics without 
the facts to back them up. If we are 
going to discuss ethics, then let’s be 
clear. Professor Raskin has voluntarily 
committed to the strongest ethics 
standards and postemployment limita-
tions of any nominee to the Federal 
Reserve ever. 
In fact, each of these nominees has 
voluntarily committed to stronger eth-
ics 
standards, 
except 
one—Jerome 
Powell. That is right—Republicans on 
the Banking Committee are united in 
voting for the only one of the five Fed 
nominees we are considering today who 
has refused to voluntarily commit to 
stronger ethics standards. This is par-
ticularly hypocritical because Chair 
Powell is currently presiding over the 
biggest ethics scandal in the Fed’s 
more than century-long history. 
We should recognize these attacks on 
Professor Raskin for what they are. 
There is no actual concern about Pro-
fessor Raskin’s ethics or about her ex-
traordinary qualifications. No. These 
are bad-faith attempts to take down a 
highly qualified candidate who is com-
mitted to actually doing the job of reg-
ulating the biggest financial institu-
tions. 
Let’s be absolutely clear about what 
is happening here. When President 
Biden decided to renominate Jerome 
Powell to run the Federal Reserve, he 
did so over the objections of myself and 
others who believe that a Trump Re-
publican who is a lifelong Wall Street 
banker and whose record clearly dem-
onstrates an allergy to financial regu-
lation is a dangerous choice for the Fed 
Chair. I lost that argument. And the 
President instead extended an olive 
branch to all of the Republicans in this 
Chamber who urged the Democratic 
President to let Republican Jay Powell 
stay on. 
What has been the Republican re-
sponse to that olive branch? They are 
lighting that branch on fire. The Re-
publican minority is getting their pre-
ferred Federal Reserve Chair, a mem-
ber of their party, but they won’t sup-
port the President’s extraordinarily 
qualified Vice Chair for Supervision. 
Instead, the Republicans are smearing 
her daily with unfounded accusations 
and ugly innuendo. 
Now, they are threatening to break 
the Senate by using a loophole to blow 
up the process we all agreed on last 
year for how to deal with nominees in 
this closely divided Senate. The Repub-
licans lack the votes to block this 
nomination from going forward, so now 
they refuse to participate in the proc-
ess that they previously agreed to fol-
low in the hopes that they can prevent 
a nominee with majority support from 
getting a confirmation vote. 
If Republican Senators want to boy-
cott the Raskin nomination, that is 
their choice, but Democrats are the 
majority in this body, and we can 
choose how to respond. Republicans 
who want to vote against Raskin are 
free to do so, just as I intend to vote 
against Powell, but we should not re-
ward this effort to block nominees with 
majority support from even receiving 
votes. 
Every one of these five nominees of 
the Fed should move together and 
should get votes on the floor of the 
Senate. If Republicans refuse to abide 
by the spirit of the agreement they 
made last year, then it is up to the 
Democrats to enforce it. We need to ad-
vance all five of President Biden’s 
nominees to the Federal Reserve, and 
we need to do it now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
DISASTER RELIEF 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as 
you know and as my colleagues know, 
our budget process is finally moving. 
I wanted to come down to the Senate 
floor today to say a few words about 
the need for disaster relief. I am going 
to talk about Louisiana but not just 
Louisiana. Two States in particular 
come to mind: Kentucky and New 
York. I hesitate to single out specific 
States because I don’t want to deni-
grate the needs in other States. We 
have a number of States that need dis-
aster relief, and the way to address 
that issue, it seems to me, is in our 
budget bill. 
As you know, Louisiana has, like 
many of our sister States, suffered 
many natural disasters throughout our 
history. My constituents, my people, 
are very tough. They are very tired, 
but they are very tough. The reason 
they are tired is because they have 
been through a nightmare in the past 
year and a half—I guess 2 years now. 
They faced what has felt to me like a 
nonstop series of hurricanes, of storms, 
of floods. No matter how many times 
you have been through a natural dis-
aster, I can tell you, it doesn’t get any 
easier to see your home demolished or 
to see your home flood or to see your 
business blown away. 
That is why, as we are working out a 
government budget deal—and I hope we 
can work out a budget deal—I want to 
make sure that Washington doesn’t 
forget about my people in Louisiana or 
forget about the other Americans who, 
through no fault of their own, have sus-
tained damage from a natural disaster 
and need a little help. 
The storms and the floods that hit 
Louisiana in the last year and a half 
are not just a distant memory for 
many of my people. Louisiana families 
are going to have to live with the con-
sequences of everything the gulf has 
been throwing at us for a while. That 
means broken buildings. That means 
wrecked homes. That means destroyed 
businesses. That means debris clut-
tering the streets. And that doesn’t 
even begin to describe the mental an-
guish of having a hurricane uproot 
your life and your livelihood and your 
kids’ education and your ability to go 
to church on Sunday. 
I wanted to remind all of my col-
leagues today of the litany of catas-
trophes that have befallen my State. I 
mention this list not to ask for your 
pity. Let me say it again. Louisianians 
are tough. We are tough as a boot. We 
are tired. But I want my colleagues to 
understand that I am not talking about 
a simple rain shower here. My people 
have been through a lot. 
In August of 2020, Hurricane Laura 
made landfall in Louisiana. Hurricane

100,000 homes. Laura leveled or dam-
aged almost every single building— 
every one—in the city of Lake Charles. 
Then came Hurricane Delta right be-
hind Laura in October of 2020. Delta 
left more than half a million Ameri-
cans—rather, Louisianians and Ameri-
cans, of course—without power, not 
just for a few minutes, not just for a 
few hours, for days. 
That very same month, Hurricane 
Zeta tore through Louisiana. Zeta 
caused approximately 400,000 Louisian-
ians to lose power and damaged many 
of their homes and businesses. 
A few months went by, and now we 
are in February of 2021. A historic win-
ter storm hit my State, froze my State, 
and 37,000 people lost power. 
Now, 
even 
when 
temperatures 
warmed, we didn’t find any relief be-
cause 
that 
May, 
historic 
rainfall 
soaked parts of my State. By parts, I 
don’t mean a little bitty corner of my 
State; I mean big parts of my State. 
The rainfall drenched Lake Charles. 
Remember, I referenced Lake Charles 
with respect to Laura, which had al-
ready been battered. Twelve inches of 
rain hit Lake Charles. You know the 
result. If you get 12 inches of rain in a 
short period of time, as we did in Lake 
Charles, you are going to flood; I don’t 
care if you live on Pikes Peak. 
Then Hurricane Ida made landfall in 
August of 2021. Ida was one of the worst 
hurricanes ever to devastate my State 
and one of the worst hurricanes ever to 
make landfall in the United States of 
America. The only hurricanes that 
have matched its strength in terms of 
wind speed are Hurricane Laura and 
the Last Island Hurricane of 1856. Wind 
speeds for Hurricane Ida were clocked 
at well over 100 miles per hour; in some 
cases, 120, 135 miles per hour. Ida dam-
aged more than 90,000 homes and 
caused roughly a fifth of all the people 
in my State to lose power—and I don’t 
mean to lose power for a little while; 
lose power for days, weeks, months. 
We are still catching our breath, as 
you can tell, but just as we were about 
to catch our breath, we had another 
hurricane, Hurricane Nicholas. It hit 
Louisiana with, depending on the area, 
between 5 and 10 inches of rain, and 
that was only a few weeks after Ida. 
Now, after all of these floods, after 
all of these hurricanes, after all of 
these storms, after all of these cata-
strophic rain events, after this terrible 
string of disasters, FEMA is imple-
menting Risk Rating 2.0, a plan that is 
going to make flood insurance vir-
tually unaffordable for the people of 
America and for the people of Lou-
isiana. 
Louisiana families—again, we are not 
asking for your pity. We don’t want 
pity in Louisiana. We are proud people. 
We are tough people. But we are tired, 
and we pay taxes like everybody else 
does. And just like some citizens in 
other States—Kentucky and New York, 
to name two—we need a little help. 
We need to address all of these 
needs—not just for my State but for 
the other States that need help—in our 
budget. If you add up the damage esti-
mates from Hurricanes Laura, Delta, 
Zeta, and Ida, we are talking about 
130,000 homes destroyed. According to 
estimates from my State back home, 
from the Governor and the legislature, 
Louisiana still needs hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars to help fix the damage 
Laura and Delta inflicted on our hous-
ing and the small businesses of South-
west Louisiana. Frankly—I mentioned 
Ida and the severity of Ida—the dam-
ages for Ida will probably cost a little 
more than $2.5 billion. 
We in Louisiana have recovered from 
natural disasters before, and we are 
going to recover from these, but we are 
going to need help to rebuild, just like 
the people from Kentucky are going to 
need help; just like the people from 
New York are going to need help; just 
like the folks, my fellow citizens out 
West, are going to need help to recover 
from wildfires. 
I fought before to get disaster recov-
ery relief for my people. I don’t think 
I have ever voted against a disaster re-
lief bill to help my neighbors in other 
States, and I am going to keep fight-
ing. I urge my colleagues not to forget 
the people in Louisiana and the people 
of America who have suffered these 
natural disasters as we work out our 
budget. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, some-
thing happened today in Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee 
that I have never seen before in the 
U.S. Senate. 
Three weeks ago, Senator TOOMEY— 
the ranking member, the senior Repub-
lican on the committee from Pennsyl-
vania—Senator TOOMEY and I agreed 
that there would be a committee vote 
today for six nominees: Sandra Thomp-
son, who would be head of the FHFA; 
Lael Brainard, Vice Chair at the Fed-
eral Reserve; Jay Powell, the Chair— 
sitting Chair, who has been nominated, 
to confirm him as the Chair; and then 
three new members of the Federal Re-
serve, Sarah Bloom Raskin, who would 
be Vice Chair of Supervision; also Phil-
ip Jefferson; and Lisa Cook. 
This would be the—I think the best 
qualified, most diverse in terms of gen-
der and race, but also most diverse 
Federal Reserve in terms of knowledge 
and perspective because one of the 
most poignant, I think, legitimate, 
criticisms of the Fed is how sort of the 
Federal Reserve has always kind of 
looked like me, except they think like 
Wall Street. 
And this is the first time where I 
have seen a Federal Reserve with the 
breadth of knowledge. There is a—the 
President wants to appoint a gen-
tleman who grew up right near RFK 
Stadium in a poor part of Washington, 
who now is a dean at a southern school; 
another, a woman from a small town in 
Georgia, who is now at Michigan State; 
a former bank regulator and Federal 
Reserve Governor and also was No. 2 at 
Treasury; in addition to the two Fed-
eral Reserve members, Lael Brainard 
would be elevated to Vice Chair and 
Jay Powell. 
That is just all background to show, 
Mr. President, the diversity and the 
breadth and the depth of these five 
members. And they would bring a per-
spective on our economy that matters 
to your voters in Connecticut and mine 
in Ohio; that they don’t have this lean 
towards Wall Street. They don’t have 
this sort of singular view of the Fed-
eral Reserve. They understand that the 
Federal Reserve should look at the 
economy through the eyes of workers. 
We have a chance right now to ap-
point a Federal Reserve Board—the 
seven members of the Board—that real-
ly will put workers at the center of our 
economy. We really haven’t had that. 
We have a President who does that 
now, I think we have a Senate that in-
creasingly does that, and that will 
mean that we will pay—the Federal Re-
serve will pay attention to wages, the 
Federal Reserve will fight inflation. 
That is their job. They will do a num-
ber of things that will matter to our 
economy. 
Now, this would be the first time 
that there would be a full complement 
of seven governors on the Federal Re-
serve. It is a seven-member board. 
President Trump never filled all seven 
of those jobs. President Obama, at the 
end of his term, tried to and didn’t 
quite get there. So this would be the 
first time in a decade. 
And what makes that important is 
that their job—they are tasked with 
fighting inflation. 
We know part of the reason for infla-
tion is the excess profits in the oil in-
dustry, the excess profits among the 
meat packers, the excess profits among 
the shippers and companies that are 
really taking advantage of shortages 
and taking advantage of the pandemic. 
We know that drives inflation. And we 
also know that some of our best tools 
are the Federal Reserve to fight infla-
tion. 
So what I said earlier, I have never 
seen something happen like happened 
today. 
Three weeks ago, Senator TOOMEY 
and I, as I said, agreed to have this 
vote for these five nominees to the Fed 
and also the nominee for the Federal 
Housing Finance Agency and do those 
all together today. We agreed three 
weeks ago. 
Senator TOOMEY didn’t like the an-
swers from Sarah Bloom Raskin. He 
said: I don’t like the way she answered. 
And how this works—for people that 
aren’t in the Senate and do this every 
day—how this works is, after a hearing,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S698 
February 15, 2022 
Senators on a committee can simply 
write questions. It is called QFR—ques-
tions for the record—that they didn’t 
get to ask in their 5-minute slots in 
committee. 
Well, Republicans, led by Senator 
TOOMEY, sent almost 200 questions to 
Sarah Bloom Raskin. It is clear Repub-
licans don’t want her. She has been too 
strong standing up to Wall Street, too 
strong speaking out about climate in 
the role that the Federal Reserve has 
in assessing risk based on climate in 
loan—in lending decisions of the Fed. 
She is not allocating credit or telling 
banks whom to lend to, she is just say-
ing we should assess risk. 
For instance, you don’t—it is not 
really very good policy to loan—to 
write a loan for somebody in a flood 
plain when they have had hurricane 
damage year after year after year after 
year and to loan a lot of money for a 
business. I mean, things like that that 
the Federal Reserve needs to assess— 
the banks need to assess the Fed needs. 
So what happened today is Senator 
TOOMEY, because he didn’t like Sarah 
Bloom Raskin’s answers—as I said, he 
sent almost 200 letters. She answered 
200 letters from Senator TOOMEY and 
his colleagues in 48 hours, and then an-
other 
Senator—another 
Republican 
Senator sent her several more letters, 
and she answered those—several more 
questions, and she answered those 
when she didn’t have to. So she lived 
up to her side of the agreement and 
then some. 
And so Senator TOOMEY didn’t like 
her answers, so he pulled away every 
Republican member from our com-
mittee. So when we met today at 2:15, 
as planned for 3 weeks, as noticed by 
the committee officially about a week 
ago, no Republican showed up. 
And maybe that wouldn’t matter, ex-
cept the Senate rules are you have to 
have one Republican at least show up. 
You need 13 members of the committee 
to conduct business. So we had 12 
Democrats sitting in the room, and the 
other side of the room was empty; and 
we couldn’t take action. 
So what that means is we now have 
Jay Powell, Chair of the Federal Re-
serve—nominated to be Chair of the 
Federal Reserve, sitting, waiting; we 
have Lael Brainard, Vice Chair of the 
Federal Reserve, nominated, sitting 
and waiting; we have three people who 
aren’t even on the board of the Federal 
Reserve yet—Sarah Bloom Raskin and 
Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson—who 
are just in abeyance. And maybe it 
doesn’t matter about the three of 
them. They are public servants; they 
chose to do this. What does matter is 
the Federal Reserve Board only has 
four people on it now, and I don’t know 
when we are going to fill it because 
Ranking Member TOOMEY
and the 
other 11 Republicans on the board have 
decided that they don’t want to show 
up and do their job. 
I mean, when we come to the Sen-
ate—I think the Senator—the Pre-
siding Officer, the junior Senator from 
Connecticut, knows this—you aren’t 
given a little sheet that says here is 
what you do here. You vote yes—check 
the box yes, no, or I don’t think I am 
going to work today. I think I am 
going to boycott a vote. That is not 
what you do. You vote yes or no. They 
have full rights to vote no and oppose 
these nominees—I assume they will op-
pose some of them—but they really 
don’t have the right to just decide: I 
am going to take my ball and go home; 
that I am not going to work today; 
that we are going to boycott this vote. 
So we all took an informal vote. All 
12 of us voted—well, 11 of us voted for 
all 6, 1 of us voted for 5 of 6—and would 
have confirmed them overwhelmingly 
if Republicans had shown up and split 
their votes or whatever they would 
have done. 
You know, it is just too bad. It 
breaks my heart. That is not how we 
have ever done things in the Banking, 
Housing Committee. I don’t argue our 
committee is always bipartisan; it is 
not. But I do argue that most of the— 
pretty much all of us pretty much all 
the time, show up and cast votes and 
do our jobs. 
I see there are new pages here on 
both sides of the aisle. This is the be-
ginning, I think, of their second week. 
And, you know, I am sure they have 
learned from their textbooks, their col-
lege books. I am sure they watch us 
here and they think: Well, you know, I 
don’t really like that Senator much 
or—he’s kind of a nice guy, but he 
votes whatever. But they also know we 
take positions. You vote yes; you vote 
no. 
And the last thing, and then I will 
yield the floor, is I have heard so many 
Republican Members talk about infla-
tion day after day after day, and it is a 
problem we have to address. It is a 
problem we absolutely have to address. 
And they, of course, blame President 
Biden for everything, and that is OK. I 
expected that. 
But they talk about inflation, but 
then at a time when we actually could 
address the problems with inflation, 
one of the most important tools in the 
Federal Government to address infla-
tion is the Federal Reserve. And the 
Federal Reserve—seven members of the 
Federal Reserve sit with the 12 Fed 
presidents from around the country 
and they make decisions on monetary 
policy and they debate and discuss 
with a wide perspective of voices and a 
wide array of voices. 
That is just not going to happen until 
they decide let’s vote on these five 
members of the Federal Reserve. 
So I wanted to inform my colleagues 
of that. Twelve of us showed up today, 
and 12 members didn’t. They didn’t 
have a really good reason except they 
don’t like the answers that one of the 
Fed nominees gave, and that is simply 
not a good reason to refuse to do your 
job. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for 
three decades, the Violence Against 
Women Act has been at the forefront of 
our efforts to support victims of do-
mestic violence and sexual assault. 
This 
legislation 
provides 
survivors 
with access to programs and resources 
that promote safety and healing. It 
bolsters our criminal justice response 
through protections for survivors and 
provides critical training for law en-
forcement officials. It prioritizes pro-
grams and grants to prevent domestic 
violence and sexual assault from occur-
ring in the first place. 
I have been a longtime victims’ 
rights advocate, dating back to my 
time as attorney general of my State, 
and I am a proud supporter of the Vio-
lence Against Women Act. 
And I think that is a common senti-
ment in this Chamber. Republicans and 
Democrats alike agree we must do 
more to provide services and protection 
for victims of domestic violence, even 
though we don’t always agree on just 
exactly what those changes should 
look like. 
Unfortunately, like many good bipar-
tisan ideas, this became a political 
football over time. When the time 
came 
to 
reauthorize 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act in 2019, it was 
dragged through the gutter of Wash-
ington politics. Some of our friends 
across the aisle prioritized controver-
sial partisan provisions over sound bi-
partisan policy. They even opposed a 
short-term reauthorization of the ex-
isting law when we couldn’t agree. Ul-
timately, the Violence Against Women 
Act expired. 
Here is the good news: For 3 long 
years, a bipartisan group of our col-
leagues has continued to work on a 
longer term reauthorization, and for a 
while it looked like we were making 
good progress. 
Our friend from Iowa, Senator ERNST, 
is an unshakable advocate for victims 
of domestic violence and sexual as-
sault, and she has led efforts on this 
side of the aisle to reauthorize the Vio-
lence Against Women Act. She has 
worked with a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators to come up with something that 
is acceptable to both sides, but they 
have never been able to move past the 
controversial 
sticking 
points 
until 
now. Apparently, the tides have shift-
ed, and I am grateful for that. After 3 
years of waiting, we have seen real 
progress on efforts to reauthorize the 
Violence Against Women Act. 
Last week, a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators introduced legislation to extend 
and modernize that legislation, and I 
am proud to be a cosponsor of that. 
Senator ERNST from Iowa and Senator 
MURKOWSKI, our Alaska colleague, have

February 15, 2022 
led this effort on the Republican side, 
and I want to commend our colleagues 
for their leadership. They have put in 
countless hours over the last few years 
to reach this compromise. Obviously, it 
was not easy. The fact that this bill al-
ready has more than 20 bipartisan co-
sponsors speaks volumes about their 
success. 
We couldn’t have gotten to this point 
without the dedication of our friend, 
the senior Senator from California, 
Senator FEINSTEIN, who has been en-
gaged in these discussions from the be-
ginning. I appreciate the hard work 
that she and Senator DURBIN, the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, 
have put into this bill and their will-
ingness to make sensible compromises 
so we can, hopefully, get this signed 
into law without further delay. 
Like all legislation, this bill is not 
perfect, but as the saying goes, you 
can’t let the perfect be the enemy of 
the good. 
Throughout the negotiating process, 
I have raised concerns about some of 
the provisions, and I have seen our col-
leagues work in good faith with us to 
address many of those issues. There is 
no question, in my mind, that this is a 
good bill that will go a long way to 
modernize 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act and ensure that it con-
tinues to serve survivors. 
The VAWA Reauthorization Act ex-
tends this legislation through 2027 and 
builds on the advancements made in 
previous reauthorizations. It improves 
access to services, especially those in 
rural 
communities 
with 
fewer 
re-
sources. It promotes partnerships with 
law enforcement and victim services 
organizations to provide victim-cen-
tered training for law enforcement offi-
cers. It improves grants that help 
school-based professionals connect stu-
dents with victim services, and it 
strengthens existing campus grant pro-
grams for colleges and universities. It 
establishes a pilot program to support 
domestic violence victims seeking em-
ployment. It takes aim at relatively 
new threats, including cyber crimes, by 
establishing a national resource center 
on cyber crimes against individuals. 
This legislation also invests in a 
broad 
range 
of 
grant 
programs, 
trainings, and resources to support sur-
vivors of domestic violence and prevent 
similar crimes from occurring in the 
future. 
I am glad this legislation includes 
provisions from a number of bipartisan 
bills that I have introduced with col-
leagues here in the Senate. 
One example is a bill that the Pre-
siding Officer will appreciate, which I 
introduced with Senator COONS, called 
the NICS Denial Notification Act. 
If someone attempts to purchase a 
gun—in other words, they lie about 
their legal qualification to purchase a 
gun—but is denied when the NICS 
background check system comes back 
with a hit, indicating that they are dis-
qualified for one of a variety of legal 
reasons, right now, local law enforce-
ment is not notified that somebody 
tried to buy a firearm and lied about it 
and was denied access to that firearm 
because of the National Instant Crimi-
nal Background Check System. 
Under current law, Federal officials 
are notified when individuals, includ-
ing convicted felons and domestic 
abusers, fail a background check, but 
they are not required to notify State 
and local law enforcement—the people 
in the best position to actually be on 
the lookout for people who may be a 
danger to their communities and to 
themselves. 
This legislation will change that. 
This legislation will require the De-
partment of Justice to notify the rel-
evant State and local authorities with-
in 24 hours of a failed background 
check. 
Now, there are some organizations 
that are disparaging this particular 
provision. They are basically misrepre-
senting what it does. So I want to be 
clear about what it does do. 
What it does do is address somebody 
who lies in the course of filling out a 
background 
check, 
indicating 
that 
they are not disqualified, only to find 
out, when checking the system, that 
they, in fact, are. Obviously, these 
folks are up to no good if they are 
lying about their ability to purchase a 
firearm under current law. It just 
makes sense, in addition to Federal of-
ficials being notified of convicted fel-
ons and domestic violence abusers, 
that State and local law enforcement 
be notified as well. This notification 
would include the name of the indi-
vidual as well as when and where they 
attempted to purchase a firearm. This 
information gives law enforcement the 
ability to investigate and intervene be-
fore a potentially deadly attack occurs. 
It should set off all sorts of alarms 
when a convicted felon or domestic vio-
lence abuser lies when attempting to 
purchase a firearm. 
The Violence Against Women Act Re-
authorization Act also includes legisla-
tion that I introduced with Senator 
DURBIN, the chairman of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee. It is called Sup-
porting Access to Nurse Exams Act. 
Sexual 
assault 
nurse 
examiners, 
known as SANEs, are on the frontlines 
of our fight to support victims of sex-
ual assault. These are the nurses who 
perform the forensic examinations on 
rape victims and who help to identify 
and convict sexual offenders. 
This provision improves an existing 
grant program that funds sexual as-
sault forensic exam programs. We don’t 
have enough of these SANEs, or nurse 
examiners. This bill will put more 
money into the field in order to train 
more of these SANEs, to provide for 
their salaries, and to increase access in 
areas of the country that need SANEs 
more, particularly in rural areas. 
These men and women are crucial to 
our efforts to deliver justice, and this 
is an important step we can take to ad-
dress the nationwide shortage of sexual 
assault nurses. 
Over the years, the Senate and the 
Congress have done a lot to eliminate 
the rape kit backlog, which at one 
point totaled a reported 400,000 in back-
log rape kits. These rape kits are foren-
sic examination kits that contain 
DNA, which is so essential in identi-
fying the perpetrators of sexual assault 
and which has the miraculous ability— 
or seemingly miraculous ability—to 
actually exonerate some people who 
may be misidentified through visual 
identification. 
It also helps, over a period of a long 
time, to identify people who may have 
evaded prosecution because of the stat-
ute of limitations. Many of these indi-
viduals who commit these sexual as-
saults will do so on a serial basis. So 
once we have been able to identify 
them through successful rape kit eval-
uations, we can bring them to justice. 
Once again, I want to commend Sen-
ators Ernst and Murkowski for their 
tireless efforts, on behalf of victims na-
tionwide, to get us to this point. 
The Violence Against Women Act has 
changed the lives—improved the lives, 
actually—of countless survivors of do-
mestic violence and sexual assault. So 
it is time for us to come together and 
reauthorize this crucial program. 
I am proud to support this legisla-
tion, and I hope Senator SCHUMER, the 
majority leader, can find time to put it 
on the Senate’s calendar and vote it 
out without delay. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

REMEMBERING LELAND CHRISTENSEN 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, I am 
just profoundly sad and also humbled 
and proud to honor the memory of a 
cherished son of Wyoming. More than 
anything, I rise to honor my longtime 
friend Leland Christensen. 
Leland was most recently State di-
rector for my U.S. Senate office. Truly, 
his death cuts me to the depths of my 
heart. I have known Leland for dec-
ades, and there are few losses in my life 
that I have ever felt as deeply as this 
one. Leland was all Wyoming. He was 
tough as nails, endlessly patient, and 
unwaveringly kind. 
Prior to his time in my office, Leland 
served the people of Wyoming and our 
great Nation in a number of roles. He 
was formerly a member of the Wyo-
ming National Guard; a sheriff; a coun-
ty commissioner for Teton County; a 
State senator and chair of our State 
senate’s Judiciary Committee; a dep-
uty director of the Wyoming Office of 
Homeland Security; and, of course, 
most recently, State director for our 
U.S. Senate office. 
When I was elected to the U.S. Sen-
ate, I knew I needed Leland on my

cared about the challenges faced by our 
State and its people. His smile would 
light up every room, and his laugh was 
infectious. He was a joy to be with. He 
was my dear friend. 
He even guided my daughter and me 
into the Teton wilderness, along with 
his own family, on horseback to Hawks 
Rest, the most remote place in the 
lower 48 States—in tents, in the rain, 
fishing, with mules, panniers, packs. It 
was an incredible experience. We also 
floated the Snake River together, with 
Leland at the helm of his own raft. 
His knowledge and skill had a time-
less quality to them. He rescued people 
in swollen rivers. He rescued their 
horses. He searched for people in wil-
derness areas because he knew the wil-
derness areas like the back of his hand. 
He was a totally unique human 
being. His knowledge and skill were so 
timeless, he would have thrived and ex-
celled had he lived 200 years ago just as 
surely as he did in the 21st century, 
where he skillfully navigated legisla-
tion, people issues, computer issues, 
and listened to endless books on tape 
while he traveled all over Wyoming. He 
was a timeless, wonderful individual. 
I can honestly say I never worried 
about whether my team was taking 
care of the needs of my constituents in 
Wyoming because I always knew that 
Leland was watching. He always made 
sure that anyone who needed help with 
a Federal Agency was assisted and that 
our team was doing everything possible 
to help them resolve their problems. 
By every estimation—certainly by my 
estimation—he was 10 feet tall and bul-
letproof. 
But, in His own good time, God calls 
all His children home to be of service 
there. Leland was prepared for his serv-
ice in Heaven each and every day 
throughout his entire life in Wyoming. 
I can remember Leland praying before 
a meal out in the wilderness with such 
gratitude that you had heard a sermon 
in gratitude by the time he was done 
offering grace over a meal. 
I have talked a lot about Leland as a 
public servant and a friend, but he was 
first and foremost a loving and devoted 
father and husband. I am mourning his 
loss with his wife Anita; children Hun-
ter, Brittany, Simone, Jed, and Wyatt; 
their spouses; and his grandchildren. 
My staff and I, many of whom are 
here today joining me in this Senate 
Chamber, along with the entire Wyo-
ming community, tens of thousands of 
whom knew Leland and loved Leland, 
are all praying for Leland’s family. 
Words cannot truly convey the loss 
that we as a team feel since Leland 
passed away. 
I have worked with hundreds of col-
leagues, many of whom I have cared for 
very much, but rarely do I come across 
someone whose sincere humility, gen-
erosity, and selflessness come close to 
those of Leland Christensen. Every day 
spent with Leland was a better day. He 
was the definition of both ‘‘civil serv-
ant’’ and ‘‘statesman.’’ 
On behalf of the people of Wyoming, 
I want to say thank you for his service 
to our State and our country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I over-
heard some of my colleagues here on 
the Senate floor complaining about 
what happened at the Senate Banking 
Committee today, and I want to ad-
dress this, set the record straight, and 
provide a little historical context, 
which I think is important. 
Last week, the chairman of the Sen-
ate 
Banking 
Committee, 
Chairman 
BROWN, indicated that he wanted to 
have votes on six nominees within the 
Banking Committee jurisdiction. Five 
were to be Governors of the Federal 
Reserve—they had been nominated to 
Federal Reserve posts—and one was the 
Director of the FHFA. 
Now, I told the chairman last week 
that as far as Republicans on the com-
mittee were concerned, we were per-
fectly fine proceeding to votes on five 
of the six. Five of the six nominees we 
were ready to have votes on. Those five 
included the Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve, Jay Powell; Vice Chair Lael 
Brainard; 
nominee 
Professor 
Lisa 
Cook; nominee Professor Philip Jeffer-
son; and the nominee to be the Direc-
tor of the FHFA, Sandra Thompson. 
All of those, we were fine with a vote. 
By the way, some of those nominees 
have significant Republican support. 
At least one, I think, has no Repub-
lican support on the committee, but 
that didn’t matter. We were prepared 
to go and vote on these nominees. 
But the sixth nominee whom Chair-
man BROWN wanted to have a vote on 
was Sarah Bloom Raskin, and I told 
him then—this was like last Thurs-
day—that she had chosen not to answer 
quite a number of important questions 
that we had. That is the normal part of 
the vetting process that a committee 
goes through when there is a nominee. 
In particular, she chose not to answer 
questions 
about 
a 
highly 
unusual 
transaction that occurred at a com-
pany on whose board she sat after she 
left her position as a Governor at the 
Fed and then a senior Treasury staffer. 
Chairman BROWN said he would help 
us get answers to these questions, but 
we have been stonewalled. We were 
stonewalled 
before. 
We 
have 
been 
stonewalled since. So, today, I in-
formed the chairman that it is the view 
of the Republican members of the com-
mittee that we can still go ahead and 
vote on the five. 
I have heard them talk about how 
important it is that we populate the 
Fed with Governors. Four out of the 
five nominees we were prepared to vote 
on are Fed Governors. We could have 
had that vote already. We could have 
that vote tonight. We could do it to-
morrow. There is no problem with that. 
But rather than advance five nominees 
through 
the 
committee, 
Chairman 
BROWN decided he would rather have 
zero, so we are at zero. That is his 
choice. We could have had five advance 
through the committee. 
You have to ask yourself, why would 
it be so important to my Democratic 
colleagues that we forgo the oppor-
tunity to move five along the process if 
it means that, for now, Sarah Bloom 
Raskin doesn’t get a vote for what, by 
the way, would be a 10-year term on 
the Fed? And there is only one plau-
sible explanation for why they would 
be willing to leave all these vacancies 
when they could go down the road 
through the process of filling these va-
cancies. Apparently it is because get-
ting a climate warrior into this spot on 
the Fed Board of Governors—specifi-
cally, the Vice Chairman of Super-
vision; that is the spot for which Sarah 
Bloom Raskin has been nominated— 
getting her there must be the most im-
portant thing. In fact, it must be more 
important than getting all five of the 
other people confirmed because that is 
the decision they made today. 
So then you have to ask yourself, 
why would it be that important? Why 
would it be so important to get Ms. 
Raskin in this spot at the Fed? Well, 
again, I think it is pretty clear what is 
going on here, and that is that our 
Democratic colleagues have a climate 
agenda for which they don’t want to 
take responsibility. We are seeing this 
manifest itself. It is the energy policy 
of this majority, the Democratic ma-
jority and this administration, that 
has contributed significantly to this 
huge surge in energy prices. It is kind 
of causing a panic over there because 
the American people don’t really enjoy 
paying $5 a gallon or more for gasoline. 
They are not looking forward to a 20-, 
30-, 50-percent increase in the cost of 
heating their homes. They are not in 
favor of the policies that our Demo-
cratic colleagues advocate, which is to 
shut down pipelines, ban drilling, make 
sure we make less energy, make sure 
we produce less oil and gas, the energy 
we need for our daily lives, because 
when you do produce much less, prices 
go up. The American people are not 
that enthusiastic about this. 
So for our Democratic colleagues, it 
is a bit of a dilemma, right? How do 
you satisfy the climate warriors who 
absolutely want much higher prices, 
absolutely want to shut down energy 
production—but how do you do that 
without getting crosswise with the vot-
ers who really don’t think that is a 
good idea? How could you balance 
that? 
Well, there is a way to do it. Just 
shirk your responsibility and put it on 
the Fed. Perfect. Don’t deal with legis-
lation. Don’t let the American people 
know what you want to do. And cer-
tainly don’t take responsibility for the 
consequences of your actions. Let the 
Fed do it. And then if the Fed does 
these policies and prices go through 
the roof, blame them. It is perfect. 
And, lo and behold, we have the nom-
ination of Sarah Bloom Raskin. She 
has very impressive credentials. She is

very smart. But she has also told us ex-
actly what she wants to do. She has 
told us repeatedly. She has told us in 
speeches. She has written op-eds. She 
has written articles, right up through 
last year, where she has specifically 
and forcefully advocated that we use 
the supervisory powers of the Fed, 
which are enormous, to steer capital 
away from fossil fuel energy companies 
and steer it toward politically favored 
industries. So, in other words, turn the 
Fed into a body that allocates capital, 
turn the Fed into a policymaking arm 
of the government. 
It is a shocking notion that the Fed, 
which is supposed to be responsible for 
monetary policies, supposed to be re-
sponsible for stable prices and full em-
ployment, hasn’t been doing such a 
great job on the stable prices front, by 
the way. 
What they want to do is have the Fed 
take on this whole new—it is perfect, 
from their point of view. It is a way to 
advance this climate agenda without 
having to take responsibility for it. 
That is the reason that I am strongly 
opposed to Sarah Bloom Raskin serv-
ing as the Vice Chair for Supervision 
on the Fed. But that is not the reason 
that every Republican agreed that it 
would be premature to vote on her can-
didacy today. So the reason for that is 
because she refuses to answer ques-
tions. It was very difficult getting a 
complete—I don’t know if we even now 
have a complete application from her. 
There were things dribbling out that 
should have been presented as a com-
plete package much earlier in this 
process. But now she has refused to an-
swer very fundamental questions, espe-
cially about a firm called the Reserve 
Trust and her role there. 
So let me walk through, briefly, the 
sequence of events, and I think you 
will see why we have got some ques-
tions. Reserve Trust is a fintech com-
pany. It is based in Colorado. And like 
many fintech companies, they decided 
it would be enormously valuable for 
them to have direct access to the Fed-
eral Reserve’s payment wires. To get 
that access, they applied for something 
that is called a master account. 
Well, to my knowledge, the Fed has 
never approved a master account for a 
fintech company of this nature. And so 
unsurprisingly, the Fed turned down 
the application by Reserve Trust for a 
master account. 
Then Sarah Bloom Raskin, who is on 
the board of Reserve Trust—she had 
been a Fed Governor and she had 
worked in a senior post at Treasury 
and then she joined the board of Re-
serve Trust. Well, after the application 
got turned down, Sarah Bloom Raskin 
called the president of the Kansas City 
Fed and lobbied for them to get the ac-
count. 
Now, how do I know that? Well, it is 
because the president of the Kansas 
City Fed told me. But Sarah Bloom 
Raskin hasn’t. When asked the ques-
tion, ‘‘Did you call anyone at the Fed 
on behalf of the Reserve Trust,’’ she 
seemed to have developed a case of am-
nesia—couldn’t recall. That is funny. 
The person who received the call re-
membered. And the chairman of the 
board of Reserve Trust knew all about 
this call. But Sarah Bloom Raskin had 
no recollection. 
So what happened next? So they ap-
plied for the master account; it is 
turned down; Sarah Bloom Raskin calls 
the Fed; and then within months, the 
Federal Reserve does a 180-degree turn, 
reverses itself, and approves the trans-
action. A few months after that, Sarah 
Bloom Raskin steps down from the 
board and pockets $1.5 million in 
stocks that she had been granted. 
All right. About that sequence of 
events, I don’t think there is anybody 
that disputes the factual accuracy. 
What we want to know is, how did this 
happen? Because now the Reserve 
Trust is the one fintech in America 
that I am aware of that got a master 
account at the Fed. It is enormously 
valuable, at least it is to them. You 
should see the advertising they do 
about it. They were turned down. And 
then it was all approved. 
So I think we have a responsibility to 
find out how did that 180-degree rever-
sal by the Fed take place? How was 
that decision taken? Who made that 
decision and why? And we have asked 
for the documents that would substan-
tiate that. An explanation first would 
be nice and documents to back it up. 
We have asked that of Sarah Bloom 
Raskin. She has told us she doesn’t re-
call whether or why it was important 
to Reserve Trust to get the master ac-
count. That is funny. It seems like it 
was the most important thing to that 
company and she was on their board 
and she made the call. But this is the 
kind of stonewalling we are dealing 
with. Can’t get answers to basic simple 
questions: Who did you talk to? When 
did you talk to them? What was the na-
ture of the conversation? 
And from the Fed: What was the re-
view process? What led you to change 
your conclusion? Do you have a memo 
from the general counsel laying out the 
case? 
By the way, there are lots of applica-
tions out there still pending. There are 
lots of fintech companies that would 
love to get the master account that Re-
serve Trust got. If there is a way to do 
that legally, I think everybody ought 
to know what it is so that they can de-
cide whether, as a business matter, 
they want to pursue that. It is pretty 
hard for anybody to pursue that when 
they get stonewalled, as we are getting 
stonewalled. 
It is pretty rich when I hear some of 
my colleagues come down here and 
complain that Republicans didn’t show 
up at committee today. This is the 
only recourse we have when we are get-
ting stonewalled, and we can’t get an 
answer to basic questions—which is our 
responsibility to get answers to these 
questions—what else can we do? There 
is nothing else we can do. We offered to 
vote on the five nominees who actually 
did provide answers to the questions in 
their applications. But as I said, the 
chairman preferred to have zero people 
advance today rather than have five. 
And it is particularly rich when you 
consider this. The chairman himself, 
just in the last couple of years, urged 
his Democratic colleagues to boycott a 
Finance Committee markup over nomi-
nees that he wasn’t satisfied with. 
So I think this context is important. 
And I remind my colleagues, Repub-
licans on the Banking Committee are 
quite happy to vote on five nominees, 
including four Fed Governors, but we 
are not willing to vote for Ms. Raskin 
until we get some answers to our ques-
tions. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
REMEMBERING WAYNE STENEHJEM 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the late North 
Dakota 
attorney 
general, 
Wayne 
Stenehjem. 
Earlier this month, North Dakota 
laid to rest a dedicated public servant 
for our great State who was both a col-
league and a true friend. Wayne spent 
over four decades serving the people of 
North Dakota. Throughout that time, 
he worked to make our State a better 
place to live. Moreover, he was a fierce 
advocate for the rule of law and the 
rights of North Dakotans. 
Wayne was the best at what our 
State has to offer, having called North 
Dakota his home for the entirety of his 
life. He was born in Mohall, ND, grad-
uated from the University of North Da-
kota, and received his law degree from 
the University of North Dakota School 
of Law. 
Wayne started his career in public 
service in North Dakota’s State Legis-
lature, where he served for 24 years, 
first as a member of the North Dakota 
House of Representatives and then as a 
member of the North Dakota Senate. 
He then ran for the position of attor-
ney general and was the longest serv-
ing attorney general in the State’s his-
tory, having held the position for 21 
years. 
In fact, Wayne and I both ran for 
State office in 2000, Wayne for attorney 
general and I ran for Governor. We 
spent much of the year traveling the 
State together and, once elected, we 
were able to start our service in state-
wide office at the same time. It was a 
blessing to have my time as Governor 
and now Senator coincide with Wayne’s 
service as attorney general. This not 
only provided us with many opportuni-
ties to work together on issues impor-
tant to North Dakotans, it allowed me 
to get to know him as a friend and to 
experience his many great qualities. 
He was incredibly intelligent. He had 
a tremendous sense of humor, and he 
possessed a deep knowledge about a 
wide variety of subjects, from sports to 
trivia, to history, to law—you name it. 
Wayne was one of the most intelligent 
people I ever met. There is much to 
miss about Wayne and many great 
memories to be grateful for.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S702 
February 15, 2022 
Wayne is survived by his wife Beth 
Bakke Stenehjem and son Andrew, 
along with many, many other loved 
ones. He had a large family, and he 
loved them all. 
Mikey and I extend our deepest con-
dolences to Wayne’s family and all of 
his loved ones. North Dakota lost a 
strong advocate for our State, but his 
legacy will continue on. 
Rest easy, Wayne. Thank you for 
your friendship. Thank you for all that 
you accomplished. 
Mr. President, I yield to my col-
league from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I, of 
course, associate with every word Sen-
ator HOEVEN said. I think it is fortu-
itous we are joined in the Chamber 
today by the next speaker who came 
here to talk about something alto-
gether different, but Senator WICKER 
knew our attorney general, Wayne 
Stenehjem, maybe longer than I did, 
actually. 
As Senator HOEVEN said, a couple of 
weeks ago, the good people of North 
Dakota lost a really good friend. We 
said goodbye to one of our State’s most 
dedicated and beloved public servants. 
Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem 
died unexpectedly and suddenly on 
January 28, just 1 month after an-
nouncing his intention to not seek re-
election and retire at the end of this 
year. 
Wayne was, as John said, North Da-
kota’s longest serving attorney gen-
eral, having been in office since 2001. 
Prior to this, he was in the State legis-
lature, winning his first election while 
at the University of North Dakota—a 
law student at the age of 22 and con-
tinuing his service in the legislature 
for 24 more years. 
He gave 46 years of continuous serv-
ice to the people of North Dakota, and 
we are just now beginning to com-
prehend the impact of the significance 
of all that he did for our State and dur-
ing those important years. 
I 
first 
became 
acquainted 
with 
Wayne when he was serving as a State 
senator, and I was a desk page in the 
legislature. Our friendship and polit-
ical collaborations continued during 
the years as I worked for the North Da-
kota Republican Party and later held 
State-appointed and elected offices. In 
the 9 years I have been in Congress, 
Wayne has been a valued friend, a 
trusted advisor, and an invaluable 
champion of States’ rights and the U.S. 
Constitution. 
His work representing North Dakota 
in State and Federal courts and as a 
member of the State Industrial Com-
mission was monumental. It positioned 
our State to be an energy powerhouse 
and, at the same time, an unwavering 
steward of our environment. Among 
the most notable Federal issues that 
Wayne championed for our State was 
objecting to the onerous Waters of the 
United States regulations proposed by 
the 
Obama 
administration. 
Wayne 
skillfully led a coalition of 13 States in 
opposition, resulting in a nationwide 
stay of that rule. He was also instru-
mental in procuring a historic stay of 
the Clean Power Plan from the U.S. 
Supreme Court. In both cases, he skill-
fully underscored the rights and the re-
sponsibilities of States, while drawing 
a blueprint for cooperative federalism 
in environmental policy. 
Wayne’s servant leadership over the 
past four decades was woven into 
countless battles, triumphs, and solu-
tions. An ardent supporter of open 
records and meetings laws and trans-
parency in government, every public 
group, including Governor HOEVEN, 
Public Service Commissioner CRAMER, 
and anybody in government understood 
that regardless of the size or the im-
portance of your commission or your 
committee, we all felt Wayne’s scru-
tiny on behalf of transparency for the 
people. 
He developed innovative ways to 
crack down on illegal meth production 
and to better control the opioid epi-
demic. Human trafficking and domes-
tic abuse issues were also always—al-
ways—on the top of his priority list 
and on his radar. He was a fierce advo-
cate and supporter of law enforcement, 
the brave men and women who protect 
the safety of our communities. They 
all knew that Wayne had their backs. 
His work was impressive. Yet Wayne 
was not a grandstander. He worked 
quietly and had much more respect for 
good outcomes than for personal gain 
and benefit. Wayne smiled all the time. 
He literally smiled all the time. And on 
the very rare occasion he didn’t, you 
were probably in trouble, and you prob-
ably deserved it, but it was rare. He 
was a fun-loving person. He knew what 
to take seriously and what to enjoy. 
His balance of life is really what I 
think endeared him to so many people. 
Wayne was the same person last 
month that he was in college, which is 
his greatest testament, I think, to pub-
lic service. When you accomplish as 
much as Wayne did and reach the pin-
nacle of service as he did and he was 
the same guy who represented the Uni-
versity of North Dakota in the State 
legislature 46 years ago, that says it all 
about his character and about Wayne’s 
stature. 
Recognized among the very elite at-
torneys general in the country, the Na-
tion’s 36 current and former attorneys 
general who attended his funeral in 
Bismarck, speaks volumes about the 
high regard to which he was held by his 
peers. 
North Dakota and our Nation have 
lost 
a 
true 
patriot, 
and 
Wayne 
Stenehjem left an incredible legacy we 
can all celebrate. He dedicated his life 
to public service in our State, and our 
State is a much, much better place be-
cause of him. Thousands of people 
knew Wayne. Thousands more—and 
really 
millions—were 
impacted 
by 
Wayne’s good work, particularly in the 
attorney general’s office. 
In the context of eternity, our life is 
but a snap of a finger, but in the con-
text of history, Wayne Stenehjem’s 
contributions are massive and long-
standing. 
On behalf of all North Dakotans, Kris 
and I send heartfelt sympathy to his 
wife Beth; his son Andrew; his very, 
very large extended family; and the le-
gion of dedicated friends and admirers. 
As a lifelong Eagle Scout, Wayne was 
no doubt familiar with the famous 
scouting adage, ‘‘Leave a place better 
than when you found it.’’ Without a 
doubt, Wayne left North Dakota and 
this Nation a better place. May we all 
be inspired by his lifetime of public 
service and the profound impact it had 
on all that is excellent about North Da-
kota today. Rest in peace, Wayne. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise 
today during this Black History Month 
to call attention to two remarkable 
daughters of the State of Mississippi, 
two basketball legends: Lusia Harris 
and Ruthie Bolton. These two Mis-
sissippi athletes took women’s basket-
ball to new heights. And they continue 
to inspire countless young girls to fol-
low their dreams in sports. 
REMEMBERING LUSIA ‘‘LUCY’’ HARRIS 
Mr. President, last week, when the 
Academy 
Awards 
announced 
their 
nominations, we learned that a New 
York Times documentary on the life of 
basketball legend Lusia Harris had 
been nominated for an Oscar. 
This hit documentary has already re-
ceived nearly 700,000 views on YouTube, 
where viewers can find it under the 
name of ‘‘The Queen of Basketball.’’ 
I was certainly thrilled to hear the 
news of this nomination, and I encour-
age every American to watch the 20- 
minute film. It is a story of American 
grit and determination and the story of 
an extraordinary Mississippian break-
ing multiple glass ceilings in the world 
of sports. 
Known by her friends as Lucy, Ms. 
Harris led an extraordinary life, be-
coming a three-time national cham-
pion and Olympian and the first and 
only woman officially drafted by the 
NBA—the first and only woman ever 
officially drafted by the NBA. 
Unfortunately, we lost Ms. Harris, all 
too soon, last month at the age of 66. 
Lucy Harris, a Mississippi Delta na-
tive, was the 10th of 11 children born to 
sharecropper parents. As a child, she 
would stay up past her bedtime watch-
ing the basketball greats: Bill Russell, 
Wilt 
Chamberlain, 
Kareem 
Abdul- 
Jabbar, Oscar Robertson. In her words, 
‘‘I wanted to grow up and shoot that 
ball just like they would shoot it, and 
I did.’’ 
At a towering height of 6 foot 3 
inches, Lucy became a superstar at 
Amanda Elzy High School in Green-
wood, MS. When she graduated in 1973, 
title IX was fresh off the books, open-
ing up options for college basketball. 
Lucy was quickly recruited to Delta 
State University on a scholarship, 
where she led her team to three con-
secutive national championships as the

As she put it: 
When I got the ball, I knew my job was to 
score. And more than likely, I would score. 
Lucy averaged 25.9 points per game 
and 14.4 rebounds while she was at 
Delta State, where the women’s game 
started to sell twice as many tickets as 
the men’s. Her raw talent and leader-
ship lifted the lady statesman to a 
record of 109 wins and 6 losses during 
her tenure—109 and 6. And to this day, 
she remains Delta State’s alltime scor-
ing leader with 2,981 point. 
It should be no surprise that Lucy 
was recruited for the 1976 Olympics in 
Montreal. There, she made history by 
scoring the first points ever in a wom-
en’s Olympic basketball game and led 
Team USA to a silver medal. 
If that wasn’t enough, the following 
year, she was recruited by the New Or-
leans Jazz, a men’s basketball team; 
but by then, she had married her high 
school sweetheart, George Stewart, and 
was pregnant with their first child. 
And so she turned down the chance to 
play for the New Orleans Jazz. 
Instead, she returned to Delta State 
University, where she served as an as-
sistant coach and earned a master’s in 
education. She later became a high 
school teacher and girls’ basketball 
coach at her alma mater in Greenwood. 
And in between, she spent 2 years 
coaching women’s basketball at Texas 
Southern University in Houston. 
Lucy Harris’ name is forever written 
in the history books. In 1992, she be-
came the first Black woman to be in-
ducted into the Basketball Hall of 
Fame and was later ushered into the 
Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame and 
the International Women’s Sports Hall 
of Fame. 
She is survived by her children: 
Christopher, 
Eddie, 
Christina, 
and 
Crystal, all of whom have won college 
degrees and who carry on her memory. 
If the WNBA had existed in the 1970s, 
I think we can safely assume Lucy Har-
ris would have continued to dominate 
the court for many years. She did not 
get that chance. The WNBA would not 
come into existence until 1997. 
TRIBUTE TO RUTHIE BOLTON 
Mr. President, I am proud to say that 
another daughter of Mississippi, Ruthie 
Bolton, followed in the footsteps of 
Lucy and carried the torch forward. 
Ruthie Bolton was born 12 years after 
Lucy Harris, hailing from Green Coun-
ty, MS. She was the 16th of 20 children. 
Ruthie first dreamed of a career in bas-
ketball as a star player for McLain 
High School, where she led the team to 
a State championship. 
Then she landed a scholarship at Au-
burn University, where she helped the 
Tigers to three Southeastern Con-
ference titles and four NCAA tour-
nament appearances. 
Ruthie Bolton went on to play 15 sea-
sons of professional ball in Europe, in-
cluding the country of Turkey, and in 
the United States, where she played 
eight seasons for the Sacramento Mon-
archs. 
She also helped Team USA win two 
gold medals at the Olympics in 1996 and 
2000. Ruthie Bolton now stands shoul-
der to shoulder with Lucy Harris in the 
Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame. 
My wife, Gayle, and I had the honor 
of meeting Ruthie Bolton a few days 
ago while touring her native Green 
County, MS. We each got to hold the 
two gold medals, and Ruthie and I were 
given the privilege of leading a local 
lunch crowd in a verse of ‘‘Amazing 
Grace.’’ 
As 
we 
celebrate 
Black 
History 
Month, I am immensely proud to honor 
these two outstanding Mississippi ath-
letes. 
In her Oscar-nominated film, Lucy 
Harris had this message to the next 
generation of young Americans. She 
said: 
I especially want those young children to 
understand that if you work hard . . . any-
thing is possible. 
That was the optimistic attitude 
that made Lucy Harris such a success. 
Those were great words of advice to 
our future heroes, words proved true by 
people like Mississippians Lucy Harris 
and Ruthie Bolton. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

HONORING STAFF SERGEANT 
JESSE SHERRILL 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I join 
today with people across New Hamp-
shire to pay tribute to and honor the 
life of Staff Sergeant Jesse Sherrill of 
the New Hampshire State Police. Ser-
geant Sherrill dedicated 19 years to 
serving the people of the Granite State 
with the New Hampshire State Police, 
before he tragically lost his life while 
on duty on October 28, 2021. 
Raised in Barrington, NH, Sergeant 
Sherrill began his career in law en-
forcement with the Hooksett Police 
Department in 2001. In December 2002, 
he was hired by the New Hampshire 
State Police, assigned to patrol in New 
Hampshire’s North Country. He later 
worked with the Attorney General’s 
Drug Task Force and was promoted to 
sergeant and then staff sergeant for 
Troop A, which serves Rockingham and 
Strafford Counties. 
Sergeant Sherrill excelled in each of 
his roles and was known for his incred-
ible work ethic. He was a mentor to his 
fellow troopers and was revered for his 
leadership and his commitment to the 
success of his peers. 
Beyond his career, Sergeant Sherrill 
always put family first; his family was 
at the core of everything that he did. 
He was a loving and supportive hus-
band to Nicole and an incredible father 
to Peyton and Quinn, transitioning 
from a pressure-packed day at work to 
a very present husband and father with 
surprising ease. Nicole’s nickname for 
Jesse—‘‘Superman’’—reflected 
how 
much she, his family, and his col-
leagues respected and admired his abil-
ity to do so many things so well. 
Sergeant Sherrill was a Granite 
State hero. He represented the very 
best of New Hampshire’s law enforce-
ment community, serving valiantly to

and community with humility and 
kindness. 
Sergeant Sherrill made New Hamp-
shire a better, safer place. I join Gran-
ite Staters in offering our deepest sup-
port and condolences to his family and 
to all those who knew him. Sergeant 
Sherrill is greatly missed, but his leg-
acy is not and will not be forgotten.

150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ISLAND 
FALLS, MAINE 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to commemorate the 150th anni-
versary of the town of Island Falls, 
ME. As one who was born and raised in 
Aroostook County, it is a great pleas-
ure to celebrate the generations of in-
dustrious and caring people who have 
made Island Falls such a wonderful 
place to live, work, and raise families. 
Incorporated on February 27, 1872, Is-
land Falls is a small town with a rich 
history. For thousands of years, the 
west branch of the Mattawamkeag 
River was the hunting grounds of the 
Micmac and Maliseet Native American 
Tribes. Permanent settlement began in 
earnest when the long-disputed border 
between the Aroostook region of Maine 
and British New Brunswick finally was 
determined in 1842. 
The early settlers created a vibrant 
community. They cleared farmland 
and, with the river and falls providing 
power, established lumber and grain 
mills. The first school, built in 1859, 
also served as a church and meeting 
house. 
With the river, pristine lakes, and 
spectacular views of Mt. Katahdin, Is-
land Falls has long been a paradise for 
outdoor enthusiasts. With William Se-
well, the son of one of the first settlers 
as his guide, young Theodore Roosevelt 
often visited Island Falls to hunt, fish, 
hike, and canoe. Bible Point State His-
toric Site marks the location where 
the future President would sit in quiet 
contemplation on his Sunday mornings 
in Maine. 
Today, Island Falls is a premier four- 
season destination for outdoor recre-
ation. In addition to the activities 
Theodore Roosevelt enjoyed, it is an 
ideal place for golf, leaf-peeping, star- 
gazing, and, with an extensive network 
of well-groomed trails, snowmobiling. 
Island Falls is a town of patriots, and 
a park pays tribute to those who have 
defended our nation. Among them is 
Pvt. George F. Robinson, who served 
with the Maine Eighth Regiment in the 
Civil War. 
While recovering from wounds re-
ceived in battle, Pvt. Robinson was re-
assigned as an attendant to Secretary 
of State William Seward. On the night 
of April 14, 1865, as the assassination of 
President Lincoln was being carried 
out, a coconspirator entered the Sew-
ard home and attacked the Secretary 
with a knife. Pvt. Robinson fought off 
the attacker and, despite his own stab 
wounds, helped render the first aid that 
saved Secretary Seward’s life. This 
Maine hero rose to the rank of major 
and was awarded the Congressional 
Gold Medal. In 1965, on the centennial 
of this act of valor, the Maine Legisla-
ture renamed Robinson Mountain in 
his honor. 
The celebration of Island Falls’ 150th 
anniversary is not about the passing of 
time, but about human accomplish-
ment. We celebrate the people who 
pulled together, cared for one another, 
and built a great community. Thanks 
to those who came before, Island Falls, 
ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks to 
those there today, it has a bright fu-
ture.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JANE LEE HAMMAN 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Jane Lee Hamman of Jefferson County 
as Montanan of the Month for her pa-
triotism and dedication to serving her 
community, State, and Nation. 
Jane’s selfless contributions began at 
a young age when she started volun-
teering for Meals on Wheels with her 
parents. Jane also joined her parents in 
supporting Reverend Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., and the civil rights move-
ment, believing in equal opportunity 
and advancements for all people based 
on their character, not the color of 
their skin. Her life mantra is, ‘‘living 
to advance freedom, knowledge and 
justice for all.’’ I think I speak for all 
who know her when I say she truly em-
braces these ideals. 
Jane’s love for her country is on full 
display in her monthly column she 
writes for the Boulder Monitor news-
paper. The goal of Jane’s column is to 
preserve liberty, educate readers about 
America’s vision of the Declaration of 
Independence, and celebrate our Con-
stitution. She also shares her values of 
patriotism and volunteerism with oth-
ers while serving as the lay leader of 
the Clancy United Methodist Church 
and as the Oro Fino Chapter Registrar 
of the Daughters’ of the American Rev-
olution. Additionally, Jane has been 
appointed by Governor Greg Gianforte 
to the Montana State Board of Edu-
cation and is the chair for the North 
Jefferson County Public Library Dis-
trict Board of Trustees. 
I have no doubt that her love for the 
great State of Montana and the United 
States of America influences every per-
son she meets. It is my honor to recog-
nize Jane for her commitment to serv-
ing her community, State, and country 
while spreading Montana values of 
service and patriotism. 
Keep up the great work, Jane.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mr. WARNOCK, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. BOOKER, Mr. CARPER, Mr. 
CASEY, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, Mr. HEINRICH, Mr. 
MARKEY, 
Mr. 
MERKLEY, 
Mr. 
PETERS, Mr. REED, Mr. SAND-
ERS, Ms. SMITH, Mr. VAN HOL-
LEN, and Mr. WYDEN): 
S. 3649. A bill to establish an advi-
sory committee to provide independent 
advice and recommendations to the 
Secretary of Transportation regarding 
comprehensive, interdisciplinary issues 
relating to transportation from a vari-
ety of stakeholders in transportation 
planning, design, research, policy, and 
advocacy, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Transpor-
tation Equity Act, which I introduced 
today. 
As our Nation is making historic in-
vestments in our transportation infra-
structure 
through 
the 
bipartisan 
intrastructure law, equity should be at 
the forefront of the Federal Govern-
ment’s plans to revitalize communities 
and ensure access, mobility, and oppor-
tunity for all. 
One of President Biden’s first actions 
in office was signing an Executive 
order on advancing racial equity and 
support for underserved communities 
through 
the 
Federal 
Government, 
which states, ‘‘Our Nation deserves an 
ambitious whole-of-government equity 
agenda that matches the scale of the 
opportunities and challenges that we 
face.’’ 
To accomplish this bold agenda, we 
need the interaction and involvement 
of diverse groups of stakeholders to en-
sure communities are heard and create 
effective policies. 
Fortunately, we have a model for 
how we can bring such groups together 
to infuse equity into our transpor-
tation and infrastructure investments. 
In 2016, the U.S. Department of Trans-
portation 
established 
the 
Advisory 
Committee on Transportation Equity 
to provide advice and recommenda-
tions on comprehensive, interdiscipli-
nary issues related to transportation 
equity from a variety of stakeholders 
involved in transportation planning, 
design, research, policy, and advocacy. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this bill with Senator WARNOCK to per-
manently 
reestablish 
the 
Advisory 
Committee on Transportation Equity 
within the U.S. Department of Trans-
portation. 
This bill would help recognize the 
role that transportation plays on re-
lated issues like public health, housing, 
accessibility, 
environmental 
justice, 
economic opportunity, and more. 
I want to thank Senator WARNOCK for 
coleading this bill with me, and I hope 
our colleagues will join us in support of 
this bill to help redress inequities in 
transportation infrastructure and em-
power communities to build back bet-
ter. 
By Mr. DURBIN: 
S. 3654. A bill to amend Chapter 31 of 
title 31, United States Code, to provide 
procedures 
for 
congressional 
dis-
approval of the issuance of additional 
debt; to the Committee on Finance.

the bill was ordered to be printed in

Administration: 
S. RES. 512 
Whereas the United States Capitol and 
Senate Office Buildings closed to public visi-
tation on March 12, 2020, at the very outset 
of the pandemic; 
Whereas, since March of 2020, the American 
people have learned how to safely gather and 
enter public places despite the existence of 
COVID–19 and, due to Operation Warp Speed, 
have had the opportunity to be vaccinated 
against COVID–19 for more than a year; 
Whereas, despite the existence of COVID– 
19, tens of thousands of people routinely 
gather across the country for sporting, en-
tertainment, worship, and other events; 
Whereas, despite the existence of COVID– 
19, stores, restaurants, and other public 
places have been successfully welcoming the 
public since the pandemic began in 2020; 
Whereas, despite the existence of COVID– 
19, the American people, including Members 
of Congress, routinely use crowded public 
transportation vehicles, including airplanes 
and trains; 
Whereas, despite the existence of COVID– 
19, most Americans have long since resumed 
working around co-workers, customers, and 
others; 
Whereas it is illogical and unacceptable 
that, despite the rest of the United States 
being open, the United States Capitol Build-
ing and Senate Office Buildings, buildings 
that belong to the American people, remain 
largely closed to public visitation; and 
Whereas it is time to once again welcome 
the public participation in the legislative 
process and the public visitation of our his-
toric buildings that have always been hall-
marks of American democracy: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of reopening 
the United States Capitol Building and Sen-
ate Office Buildings to the American people 
to facilitate public participation in the legis-
lative process and public visitation of these 
historic buildings; and 
(2) supports returning to the public visita-
tion policies for Senate Office Buildings and 
the portions of the United States Capitol 
Building and Capitol complex within Senate 
jurisdiction that were in place before the 
COVID–19 pandemic.

Mr. SCHATZ, Mr. CASEY, Ms. SMITH, Ms. 
WARREN, and Mr. BLUMENTHAL) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 513 
Whereas the Taliban have a history of pro-
hibiting women from receiving an education 
and pursuing jobs outside their homes and 
have publicly executed women who were ac-
cused of adultery; 
Whereas a 2001 report by the Department 
of State noted that, from 1996 to 2001, the 
Taliban ‘‘perpetrated egregious acts of vio-
lence against women’’ as part of a ‘‘war 
against women’’; 
Whereas, in some Afghan provinces taken 
over by the Taliban beginning in May 2021, 
there are reports that the Taliban have 
forced women into marriage with Taliban 
fighters and have led targeted killings 
against women; 
Whereas United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet 
has expressed concern with the Taliban’s 
contradiction 
of 
‘‘stated 
commitments,’’ 
their exclusion of women from the public 
sector, and their restrictions on women, such 
as not allowing women to appear in public 
without a male chaperone; 
Whereas, since 2018, the Secretary of State 
has designated the Taliban as an entity of 
particular concern for religious freedom pur-
suant to section 301 of the Frank R. Wolf 
International Religious Freedom Act (22 
U.S.C. 6442a) for having engaged in ‘‘particu-
larly severe violations of religious freedom’’; 
Whereas, in October 2021, the United States 
Commission on International Religious Free-
dom reported on deteriorating conditions for 
religious minorities in Afghanistan, noting 
growing fear among Hazara Shi’a Muslims, 
Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Ahmadi Muslims, 
Baha’is, and nonbelievers, and stating, ‘‘Af-
ghans who do not adhere to the Taliban’s 
harsh and strict interpretation of Sunni 
Islam and adherents of other faiths or beliefs 
are at grave threat’’; 
Whereas the Hazaras constitute approxi-
mately 10 to 15 percent of the national popu-
lation in Afghanistan and are considered a 
minority religious group; 
Whereas the Hazaras specifically, along 
with other religious and ethnic minorities, 
have historically been explicitly targeted by 
the Taliban and have been abused with impu-
nity; 
Whereas Amnesty International reported 
that on August 30, 2021, 13 Hazaras were un-
lawfully killed in the village of Kahor in the 
Khider district by Taliban fighters, with one 
of the victims being a 17-year-old girl; 
Whereas, in 2021, the Taliban forcibly dis-
placed approximately 4,000 Hazaras from 
their homes and ancestral lands in Daykundi 
province while a Taliban court expelled ap-
proximately 2,000 families from the city of 
Mazar-e-Sharif; 
Whereas, in 2021, more than 30 instances of

ghan journalists were recorded; 
Whereas activists, journalists, civil society 
actors, and scholars face threats and intimi-
dation and risk being unlawfully detained or 
tortured or becoming a victim of targeted 
killings by the Taliban; 
Whereas adherence to the rule of law and

riorating under the Taliban, which are re-
portedly targeting judges, prosecutors, law-
yers, human rights defenders, journalists, 
former parliamentarians, and individuals 
who previously advocated for human rights

Whereas there are reports of the Taliban 
conducting

Whereas, during the previous period of rule 
of the Taliban, the Taliban reportedly exe-
cuted Afghan men alleged to have engaged in 
sexual activity with other men; 
Whereas the current Acting Prime Min-
ister of the Taliban reportedly stated in 1996 
that ‘‘homosexuality is a great sin’’ and 
‘‘some say we should take these sinners to a

say we should dig a hole beside a wall, bury 
them, then push the wall down on top of

Whereas a Taliban judge, Gul Rahim, stat-
ed in July 2021 that ‘‘[f]or homosexuals, 
there can only be two punishments: either 
stoning or he must stand behind a wall that 
will fall down on him,’’ and a spokesman for 
the Ministry of Finance of Afghanistan 
noted that LGBT rights would not be re-
spected under the Taliban’s interpretation of 
Sharia law; and 
Whereas, in 2022, many LGBTQI individ-
uals in Afghanistan are forced to live in hid-
ing due to reports of threats and attacks 
against such individuals in the community: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) stands in solidarity with the people of 
Afghanistan and with vulnerable groups in-
cluding women and children, religious and 
ethnic minorities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) 
persons, civil society actors, journalists, and 
other at-risk populations in Afghanistan; 
(2) reaffirms the longstanding commitment 
of the United States to advance human 
rights worldwide; 
(3) calls on the Taliban to uphold the pro-
tection of universal human rights, including 
the commitments set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and enshrined 
in the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, to which Afghanistan is a 
party; 
(4) encourages the executive branch to con-
tinue to call for the protection of women and 
children, religious and ethnic minorities, 
civil society actors, journalists, and LGBTQI 
persons under Taliban rule; 
(5) calls for the international community 
to condemn human rights violations com-
mitted by the Taliban; 
(6) reaffirms the commitment of the 
United States to support Afghan civil soci-
ety, individuals who assisted with the war ef-
forts of the United States and allies of the 
United States, and individuals who advocate 
for universal human rights; and 
(7) calls on the United States Government 
to work closely with the international com-
munity and nongovernmental organizations, 
particularly such organizations based in Af-
ghanistan, to support at-risk Afghan minor-
ity populations and other vulnerable commu-
nities, including through efforts to stem the 
growing humanitarian crisis that will dis-
proportionately impact already vulnerable 
groups.

PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE THAT THE PRESIDENT 
AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
SHOULD 
ENSURE 
THAT 
THE 
GOVERNMENT OF CANADA DOES 
NOT PERMANENTLY STORE NU-
CLEAR WASTE IN THE GREAT 
LAKES BASIN

BALDWIN, Mr. PETERS, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, 
Mr. 
DURBIN, 
Ms. 
DUCKWORTH, 
Mr. 
BROWN, and Mrs. GILLIBRAND) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 514 
Whereas the water resources of the Great 
Lakes Basin are precious public natural re-
sources shared by the Great Lakes States 
and the Provinces of Canada; 
Whereas, since 1909, the United States and 
Canada have worked to maintain and im-
prove the water quality of the Great Lakes 
through water quality agreements; 
Whereas more than 40,000,000 individuals in 
Canada and the United States depend on the 
fresh water from the Great Lakes for drink-
ing water; 
Whereas the Government of Canada is pro-
posing to build a permanent deep geological 
repository for high-level nuclear waste in the 
Great Lakes Basin; 
Whereas the Nuclear Waste Management 
Organization of Canada is examining build-
ing a permanent deep geological repository 
for nuclear waste in the Great Lakes Basin, 
less than 40 miles from Lake Huron in South 
Bruce, Ontario, Canada; 
Whereas nuclear waste is highly toxic and 
can take tens of thousands of years to de-
compose to safe levels; 
Whereas a spill of nuclear waste into the 
Great Lakes, including during transit to a 
permanent deep geological repository for nu-
clear waste, could have lasting and severely 
adverse environmental, health, and eco-
nomic impacts on the Great Lakes and the 
individuals who depend on the Great Lakes 
for their livelihoods; 
Whereas more than 232 State, Tribal, coun-
ty, and local governments have passed reso-
lutions in opposition to the proposed nuclear 
waste repository of Ontario Power Genera-
tion; 
Whereas Tribes and First Nations’ citizens 
have a strong spiritual and cultural connec-
tion to the Great Lakes; 
Whereas the Saugeen Ojibway Nation exer-
cised its Aboriginal and treaty rights by vot-
ing against the Ontario Power Generation 
building a permanent nuclear waste reposi-
tory in Kincardine, Ontario; 
Whereas the protection of the Great Lakes 
is fundamental to treaty rights; and 
Whereas, during the 1980s, when the De-
partment of Energy was studying potential 
sites for a permanent nuclear waste reposi-
tory in the United States in accordance with 
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 
U.S.C. 10101 et seq.), the Government of Can-
ada expressed concern with locating a per-
manent nuclear waste repository within 
shared water basins of the 2 countries: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the Government of Canada should not 
allow a permanent nuclear waste repository 
to be built within the Great Lakes Basin; 
(2) the President and the Secretary of 
State should take appropriate action to 
work with the Government of Canada to pre-
vent a permanent nuclear waste repository 
from being built within the Great Lakes 
Basin; and 
(3) the President and the Secretary of 
State should work together with their coun-
terparts in the Government of Canada on a 
solution for the long-term storage of nuclear 
waste that— 
(A) is safe and responsible; and 
(B) does not pose a threat to the Great 
Lakes.

following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 515 
Whereas a competitive global economy re-
quires workers who are prepared for skilled 
professions; 
Whereas at least 15,000,000 new workers 
will be needed for the United States’ infra-
structure in the next decade, including de-
signing, building, and operating transpor-
tation, housing, utilities, and telecommuni-
cations; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has dis-
placed millions of workers in the United 
States and fundamentally shifted entire in-
dustries within foundational aspects of the 
economy, creating significant demands for 
high-quality and efficient upskilling and 
reskilling opportunities to ensure a quick 
and equitable recovery; 
Whereas career and technical education 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘CTE’’) en-
sures that competitive and skilled workers 
are ready, willing, and capable of holding 
jobs in high-wage, high-skill, and in-demand 
career fields such as science, technology, en-
gineering, art and design, mathematics, 
nursing, allied health, construction, infor-
mation technology, energy sustainability, 
and many other career fields that are vital 
in keeping the United States competitive in 
the global economy; 
Whereas CTE helps the United States meet 
the very real and immediate challenges of 
economic 
development, 
student 
achieve-
ment, and global competitiveness; 
Whereas the United States has 30,000,000 
jobs providing an average income of $55,000 
per year that do not require a bachelor’s de-
gree yet increasingly require some level of 
postsecondary education; 
Whereas over 11,000,000 students are en-
rolled in CTE across the country at the sec-
ondary and postsecondary levels, with CTE 
programs in thousands of CTE centers, com-
prehensive high schools, career academies, 
and CTE high schools, and nearly 1,000 2-year 
colleges; 
Whereas CTE matches employability skills 
with workforce demand and provides rel-
evant academic and technical coursework 
leading to industry-recognized credentials 
for secondary, postsecondary, and adult 
learners; 
Whereas CTE affords students the oppor-
tunity to gain the knowledge, skills, and cre-
dentials needed to secure careers in growing, 
high-demand fields; 
Whereas secondary CTE is associated with 
a lower probability of dropping out of high 
school and a higher likelihood of graduating 
on-time; 
Whereas, according to an American Fed-
eration of Teachers poll, 96 percent of par-
ents approve of expanding access to CTE and 
other programs that prepare students for 
jobs; 
Whereas students at schools with highly 
integrated rigorous academic and CTE pro-
grams are significantly more likely to meet

college and career readiness benchmarks 
than students at schools with less integrated 
programs; 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress affirmed the im-
portance of CTE by passing the Strength-
ening Career and Technical Education for 
the 21st Century Act (Public Law 115–224), 
which supports program improvement in sec-
ondary and postsecondary CTE programs in 
all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puer-
to Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, 
and outlying areas; and 
Whereas February 23, 2022, marks the 105th 
anniversary of the signing of the Act of Feb-
ruary 23, 1917 (39 Stat. 929, commonly known 
as the ‘‘Smith-Hughes Vocational Education 
Act of 1917’’), which was the first major Fed-
eral investment in secondary CTE and laid 
the foundation for the bipartisan, bicameral 
support for CTE that continues as of Feb-
ruary 2022: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of February 
2022 as ‘‘Career and Technical Education 
Month’’ to celebrate career and technical 
education across the United States; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Career 
and Technical Education Month; 
(3) recognizes the importance of career and 
technical education in preparing a well-edu-
cated and skilled workforce in the United 
States; and 
(4) encourages educators, school coun-
selors, guidance and career development pro-
fessionals, administrators, and parents to

Mr. COONS, Ms. STABENOW, Ms. BALD-
WIN, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. KELLY, Mrs. 
SHAHEEN, and Mr. SANDERS) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 516 
Whereas school counselors are more impor-
tant now than ever, as the COVID–19 pan-
demic has magnified the mental health crisis 
among the youth of our Nation; 
Whereas the American School Counselor 
Association 
has 
designated 
February 
7 
through 11, 2022, as ‘‘National School Coun-
seling Week’’; 
Whereas school counselors have long advo-
cated for equitable opportunities for all stu-
dents; 
Whereas school counselors help develop 
well-rounded students by guiding students 
through academic learning, social and emo-
tional development, and career exploration; 
Whereas personal and social growth can 
help lead to increased academic achieve-
ment; 
Whereas school counselors play a vital role 
in ensuring that students are ready for both 
college and careers; 
Whereas school counselors play a vital role 
in making students aware of opportunities 
for financial aid and college scholarships; 
Whereas school counselors assist with and 
coordinate efforts to foster a positive school 
climate, resulting in a safer learning envi-
ronment for all students; 
Whereas school counselors have been in-
strumental in helping students, teachers, 
and parents deal with personal trauma as 
well as tragedies in their communities and 
the United States; 
Whereas students face myriad challenges 
every day, including peer pressure, bullying, 
mental health issues, the deployment of fam-
ily members to serve in conflicts overseas, 
and school violence; 
Whereas a school counselor is one of the 
few professionals in a school building who is 
trained in both education and social and 
emotional development; 
Whereas the roles and responsibilities of 
school counselors are often misunderstood; 
Whereas the school counselor position is 
often among the first to be eliminated to 
meet budgetary constraints; 
Whereas the national average ratio of stu-
dents to school counselors is 424 to 1, almost 
twice the 250 to 1 ratio recommended by the 
American School Counselor Association, the 
National Association for College Admission 
Counseling, and other organizations; and 
Whereas 
the 
celebration 
of 
National 
School Counseling Week will increase aware-
ness of the important and necessary role 
school counselors play in the lives of stu-
dents in the United States: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of February 7 
through 11, 2022, as ‘‘National School Coun-
seling Week’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe National School Coun-
seling Week with appropriate ceremonies 
and activities that promote awareness of the 
role school counselors play in schools and 
the community at large in preparing stu-
dents for fulfilling lives as contributing 
members of society.

SENATE RESOLUTION 517—TO AU-
THORIZE TESTIMONY AND REP-
RESENTATION 
IN 
UNITED 
STATES V. REFFITT 
Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. 
MCCONNELL) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 517 
Whereas, in the case of United States v. 
Reffitt, Cr. No. 21–32, pending in the United 
States District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia, the prosecution has requested the 
production 
of 
testimony 
from 
Daniel 
Schwager, a former employee of the Office of 
the Secretary of the Senate; 
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 
704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government Act of 
1978, 2 U.S.C. §§ 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the 
Senate may direct its counsel to represent 
current and former officers and employees of 
the Senate with respect to any subpoena, 
order, or request for evidence relating to 
their official responsibilities; 
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of 
the United States and Rule XI of the Stand-
ing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under 
the control or in the possession of the Senate 
may, by the judicial or administrative proc-
ess, be taken from such control or possession 
but by permission of the Senate; and 
Whereas, when it appears that evidence 
under the control or in the possession of the 
Senate may promote the administration of 
justice, the Senate will take such action as 
will promote the ends of justice consistent 
with the privileges of the Senate: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That Daniel Schwager, a former 
employee of the Office of the Secretary of 
the Senate, is authorized to provide relevant 
testimony in the case of United States v. 
Reffitt, except concerning matters for which 
a privilege should be asserted. 
SEC. 2. The Senate Legal Counsel is author-
ized to represent Mr. Schwager and any cur-
rent or former officer or employee of his of-
fice in connection with the production of evi-
dence authorized in section one of this reso-
lution.

NATIONAL DAY OF REMEMBRANCE 
FOR THE WORKERS OF THE NU-
CLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM OF 
THE UNITED STATES 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged 
from further consideration and the 
Senate now proceed to S. Res. 438. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 438) designating Octo-
ber 30, 2021, as a national day of remem-
brance for the workers of the nuclear weap-
ons program of the United States. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the resolution 
be agreed to, the preamble be agreed 
to, and that the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 438) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in the RECORD of November 3, 
2021, under ‘‘Submitted Resolutions.’’) 
f 
RESOLUTIONS SUBMITTED TODAY 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate now proceed to 
the en bloc consideration of the fol-
lowing Senate resolutions introduced 
earlier today: S. Res. 515, S. Res. 516, S. 
Res. 517. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolutions 
en bloc. 
S. RES. 515 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, by sup-
porting the development of a workforce 
trained in in-demand skills, we can ac-
celerate the recovery of our economy. 
The Nation’s continued progress and 
the socioeconomic mobility of our citi-
zens are contingent on the education 
and skills of the American workforce 
and its ability to adjust to and fulfill 
the needs of the 21st century economy, 
especially 
in 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic and with grow-
ing infrastructure needs. Career and 
technical 
education—CTE—programs 
are vital to every student’s education, 
providing them access to the important 
knowledge, 
skills, 
and 
credentials 
needed to obtain careers in rapidly 
growing, 
high-demand 
industries. 
Today, approximately 11 million stu-
dents across the Nation are enrolled in 
CTE programs offered by thousands of 
career academies, comprehensive high 
schools, CTE high schools, community 
colleges, and CTE centers. Through ap-
plied learning, these students obtain 
workplace skills and technical training 
that mirror in-demand positions in the 
workforce. 
In the next decade, millions of 
skilled workers will be needed to fill 
infrastructure positions in the United 
States, including jobs related to de-
signing, building, and operating trans-
portation, 
housing, 
telecommuni-
cation, and utilities facilities. As local 
governments are able to invest in 
projects previously put on hold because 
of the pandemic and with the recent 
passage of the bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act, there 
will be even more demand for skilled 
workers. CTE programs intentionally 
match skills with workforce demands, 
lowering the probability of high school 
drop-out and increasing the likelihood 
of on-time graduation rates. One study 
showed that high school students who 
were 
CTE 
concentrators 
graduated 
from high school, enrolled in postsec-
ondary education, and were employed 
full-time at higher rates than their 
nonconcentrator peers. CTE concentra-
tors also had a higher median income 8 
years after graduation. These CTE pro-
grams will help fill the estimated 30 
million U.S. jobs available with an av-
erage annual income of $55,000 that do 
not require a bachelor’s degree yet ne-
cessitate some level of postsecondary 
education. 
In 2018, Congress affirmed the impor-
tance of CTE by passing the Strength-
ening Career and Technical Education 
for the 21st Century Act, which sup-
ports CTE programs in secondary and 
postsecondary education. We also need 
to ensure we continue reskilling and 
upskilling workers by supporting work-
force development programs. 
Today, with my Senate CTE Caucus 
cochairs Senator PORTMAN, Senator 
BALDWIN, and Senator YOUNG and more 
than two-thirds of my Senate col-
leagues, I am pleased to again intro-
duce a bipartisan resolution to des-
ignate February as Career and Tech-
nical 
Education—CTE—Month. 
CTE 
Month encourages students, parents, 
counselors, educators, and school lead-
ers to learn more about the diverse 
educational opportunities offered in 
their communities and recognize the 
valuable role of CTE in developing a 
well-educated and highly skilled work-
force in the United States. By formally 
recognizing CTE Month through this 
resolution, we hope to bring greater 
awareness to improving access to high- 
quality career and technical education 
for millions of America’s students and 
our Nation’s ongoing economic com-
petitiveness. 
S. RES. 517 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
first criminal trial arising out of the 
events of January 6, 2021, is scheduled 
to begin on February 28, 2022, in Fed-
eral district court in the District of Co-
lumbia. 
The 
Federal 
indictment 
charges the defendant with five felony 
counts for obstructing the counting by 
Congress of the electoral ballots for 
President and Vice President, trans-
porting a firearm for unlawful use in 
furtherance of a civil disorder, using 
and carrying a firearm in a restricted 
area on the Capitol grounds, obstruct-
ing the Capitol Police during a civil 
disorder, and obstructing justice based 
on statements the defendant made to 
his children in reference to these mat-
ters. 
The government has requested trial 
testimony from Daniel Schwager, for-
merly counsel to the Secretary of the 
Senate, related to the obstruction 
count, including his knowledge and ob-
servations of the process and constitu-
tional and legal bases for Congress’ cer-
tification of the Electoral College vote. 
The Secretary of the Senate would 
like to cooperate with this request by 
providing relevant testimony from Mr. 
Schwager at this trial. In keeping with 
the rules and practices of the Senate, 
this resolution would authorize the 
production of relevant testimony from 
Mr. Schwager, with representation by 
the Senate legal counsel. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the resolutions be agreed to, 
the preambles be agreed to, and the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table, all en 
bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolutions were agreed to. 
The preambles were agreed to. 
(The resolutions, with their pre-
ambles, are printed in today’s RECORD 
under ‘‘Submitted Resolutions.’’) 
f

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
RESOLUTION 
TO EXPRESS SOLIDARITY WITH 
AND REAFFIRM THE DIRE NEED 
TO PROTECT VULNERABLE AND 
MINORITY 
POPULATIONS 
AND 
THEIR ALLIES IN AFGHANISTAN 
UNDER TALIBAN RULE 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I am proud 
to introduce a bicameral resolution today, to 
express solidarity with and reaffirm the dire 
need to protect vulnerable and minority popu-
lations and their allies in Afghanistan under 
Taliban rule. I thank my Senate Colleague, 
Senator MARKEY, for his leadership on this ur-
gent human rights issue. 
The United States spent over twenty years 
in Afghanistan, in an endless war. It was cru-
cial that we leave, and I applaud President 
Biden for commanding this effort and not leav-
ing it as a task for yet another President. 
There is no good way to end a war without a 
decisive resolution; however, what we must 
not do is not leave innocent Afghan people 
behind. We cannot abandon the innocent 
women, children and families who have suf-
fered through this war. We have a moral obli-
gation to ensure that they are left with some 
system of government that respects and hon-
ors the international standards of human rights 
that our country has helped establish. 
Reports have shown that Taliban fighters 
have explicitly targeted religious and ethnic 
minorities, abusing them with impunity, and 
have threatened Afghan journalists with vio-
lence. Similar reporting shows that the Taliban 
continue to target LGBTQI individuals, forcing 
them into hiding due to the threat of physical 
violence and attacks perpetrated by Taliban 
fighters. Women, in particular, are facing dire 
circumstances. Despite promises to the con-
trary, the Taliban leadership have re-instituted 
many of the draconian measures that charac-
terized their previous rule. Restrictions on their 
freedom of movement, punishments for dress 
code violations, and constraints on their occu-
pational and educational opportunities all se-
verely limit the future of Afghan women—and 
subject them to gross injustices and violence. 
The rapidly deteriorating human rights con-
ditions in the country are exacerbated by the 
worsening humanitarian crisis, by which vul-
nerable and minority communities are dis-
proportionately impacted. 
I am proud to introduce this resolution 
today, which calls on the Biden Administration 
to work closely with the international commu-
nity and nongovernmental organizations to 
support at-risk Afghan communities, including 
efforts to counter the growing humanitarian cri-
sis that unduly impacts already vulnerable 
groups. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join me in calling for the protection of vulner-
able and minority communities in Afghanistan 
under Taliban rule, especially during this hu-
manitarian crisis.

REMEMBERING DR. CHARLES C. 
MARY, JR. 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Charles Callan Mary, 
Jr., M.D., a public servant who was inspired in 
life by his faith, education and a deep sense 
of purpose. He served the citizens of Lou-
isiana with professionalism and humility over 
sixty-one years until his passing on February 
5, 2022. He was a devoted husband of 58 
years, father of 5, grandfather of 14, brother, 
uncle, and friend to many. 
In his advanced studies, he soon recog-
nized a calling that directed him to a pre-med 
curriculum at Loyola University of the South. 
Upon completion, he enrolled in Louisiana 
State University Medical School, graduating in 
1961 with a Doctor of Medicine degree. 
Dr. Mary completed an internal medicine 
residency at LSU’s Medical School and then 
joined the Department of Medicine. He dedi-
cated 18 years of his early professional life to 
Charity Hospital and its patients, staff and stu-
dents, where he served as student, intern, 
resident, Assistant Clinical Director and then, 
in 1970 rose to the position of Medical Direc-
tor and CEO. He felt in his heart this was his 
calling and Charity Hospital was his home. 
Gov. Edwin W. Edwards appointed Dr. Mary 
as the first Commissioner of the newly created 
State Department of Health, Social and Reha-
bilitation Services, as well as State Health Of-
ficer in 1973. 
In 1974, Dr. Mary went into private practice, 
founding the Mary Medical Clinic in New Orle-
ans. He relocated his practice to St. Jude 
Medical Center in Kenner, and then Elmwood 
Medical Center in Metairie, where he would 
continue to practice internal medicine until his 
semi-retirement in 1997. He continued to see 
patients on a limited basis until Hurricane Ida 
in 2021. He also had a live local radio show 
called ‘‘Ask Dr. Mary,’’ which aired every week 
for over 15 years. 
Dr. Mary’s faith was fundamental to his life’s 
work. Starting as an altar boy at Our Lady of 
Lourdes and continuing throughout his adult-
hood, he served and participated in many ca-
pacities, including as: a Knight of the Pontifical 
Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great; a 
Knight Commander of the Equestrian Order of 
the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem; a Knight of 
the Sovereign Military Order of Malta; a recipi-
ent of the Order of St. Louis IX (Archdiocese 
of New Orleans); a member of both the Board 
of Regents and Board of Trustees of the 
Catholic University of America in Washington, 
D.C.; and a member of the Board of Trustees 
of La Roche College in Pittsburgh, PA. 
His involvement did not stop there—he em-
braced the love of Mardi Gras instilled in him 
from his father respecting the traditions and 
celebrations of Carnival. Since his childhood, 
he remained active in the Knights of Babylon 
as a rider, an officer, board member and ulti-
mately Captain and Capitan Emeritus after his 
father’s 30 plus year tenure. Like every true 
New Orleanian, Dr. Mary was an ardent foot-
ball fan (especially LSU and the Saints), an 
avid tennis player, a notorious joke teller and 
a lover of fine New Orleans signature food 
and libations. 
The entire New Orleans community is grate-
ful to Dr. Charles C. Mary, Jr. for his dedi-
cated service to the field of medicine, his phil-
anthropic contributions. His legacy will live on.

HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK

sponder, fireman Bill Todd. 
On September 3, 2021, Morrisonville fire-
fighter and lifetime member Bill Todd rushed 
into action after being called to the site of a 
fatal three-car crash. First responders from 
several departments quickly arrived at the site 
of the crash in Beekmantown and began to 
assist rescue efforts. During the emergency 
response, fireman Bill Todd collapsed, suf-
fering a near-deadly heart attack. His fellow 
first responders instantly rushed to his aid, be-
ginning CPR and shocking Mr. Todd twice 
with an AED. Once he was revived, Mr. Todd 
was brought to the University of Vermont 
Health Network and was then transferred to 
Fletcher Allen Health Care in Vermon for 
open-heart surgery. 
After his open-heart surgery, Bill Todd spent 
time recovering in the hospital. When he re-
turned home to Morrisonville in October, he 
was welcomed back with a surprise parade 
put on by crews from Morrisonville Fire, 
Morrisonville 
EMS, 
Cadyville 
Fire, 
Beekmantown Fire, District 3 Fire, Peru Fire, 
and South Plattsburgh Fire. Todd’s family, 
neighbors, and friends greeted him with ap-
plause and cheers. 
Bill Todd’s fellow first responders went 
above and beyond that day and ultimately 
saved the life of another hero. The service of 
these incredible first responders can never be 
understated. I would like to thank the brave 
first responders who saved Mr. Todd’s life that 
day, including Ted Gordon, Kevin Randall, 
Gary 
Brown, 
Nicholas 
Paine, 
Conrad 
Lavarnway, Ryan Sponable, and Ryan Wil-
liams. The actions of these brave first re-
sponders represent the exceptional service

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. JOHN 
C. LAW 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of Mr. John C. Law, who passed 
away on January 20, 2022. John, a resident of 
the City of Santa Monica, was a beloved hus-
band, father, and champion of affordable, 
high-quality health care. 
John dedicated his life to serving others and 
was a generous philanthropist in the Los An-
geles community throughout his time on the 
Board of Directors at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center, which he joined in 1997. He loved Los 
Angeles for its dynamism and diversity, and it 
was of great importance to him that the board 
of an esteemed medical institution like Ce-
dars-Sinai reflected this. During his tenure 
serving Cedars, John championed efforts to 
bring women and people of color on to the 
Board of Directors and to better the health and 
well-being of the Los Angeles community. As 
President of the Los Angeles Free Clinic, he 
worked to improve health care quality, access, 
and outcomes for underserved communities in 
the region. 
John contributed to health care causes and 
research not only through sweat equity but 
also through his tremendous generosity. John 
and his wife made their first gift to Cedars- 
Sinai in 1992 and contributed frequently to its 
prostate cancer research and health care 
leadership funds. An accomplished business-
man, he served as president of the Los Ange-
les County Capital Asset Leasing Corporation 
and as the Co-Managing Director of Warland 
Investments, a property development and 
management company. Before his time in Los 
Angeles, John resided in Washington, D.C., 
where he co-founded Bendixen and Law, a 
family attorney professional corporation in op-
eration for over 40 years. 
John is survived by his loving wife, Hope 
Warshaw and their son, John Law-Warshaw. 
He had an amazing spirit that was dedicated 
to serving his family and especially those most 
in need. He will be greatly missed by his 
friends, family, and all who know him.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA COURTS IMPROVE-
MENT ACT OF 2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Courts Im-
provement Act of 2022. This bill would make 
several important improvements to the oper-
ations of the local District of Columbia courts. 
Under the D.C. Home Rule Act, D.C. has no 
authority to amend title 11 of the D.C. Code 
(relating to organization and jurisdiction of the 
local D.C. courts). This bill only amends provi-
sions in title 11. 
First, this bill makes several changes to jury 
service in the D.C. Superior Court. It ties Su-
perior Court juror pay to the pay jurors receive 
in federal court. Superior Court jurors are cur-
rently paid less than federal jurors. The bill 
also modernizes juror summonses by giving 
prospective jurors the option to receive a sum-
mons electronically, which will save the court 
money on postage and staff time. The bill fur-
ther allows jurors who are 70 years old or 
older to be excused from jury service if the in-
dividual so requests. 
Next, this bill allows the local D.C. courts to 
pay attorneys appointed to represent indigent 
defendants in criminal proceedings and indi-
gent children in delinquency and need of su-
pervision proceedings up to the amount cur-
rently allowed in federal court. The local D.C. 
courts’ current rate is $42 per hour less than 
the federal rate. Similarly, the bill eliminates 
the $25 hourly rate fixed rate for D.C. Criminal 
Justice Act investigators and caps the rate at 
the rate of pay for investigators in the U.S. 
District Court for D.C. Investigators in federal 
court in D.C. are currently paid $65 an hour, 
and up to $75 an hour in death penalty and 
other complex cases. 
This bill also would move the appointment 
and removal of the Register of Wills (ROW) 
and supervisory responsibilities from the Chief 
Judge of the Superior Court to the Executive 
Officer of the D.C. courts. This change would 
provide the Executive Officer oversight of the 
personnel for the entire Probate Division, in-
cluding the ROW, which will improve efficiency 
in making personnel decisions and in the over-
all administration of the Probate Division. 
While both the federal government and the 
District of Columbia government have statu-
tory authority to give retroactive pay increase 
to employees, the local D.C. courts do not 
have this authority. This bill corrects this defi-
ciency. 
The bill also changes references to the Do-
mestic Violence Unit to the Domestic Violence 
Division, and updates references to individuals 
with intellectual disabilities. It would also in-
crease the jurisdictional limit of the Small 
Claims Branch to $12,000, indexed for infla-
tion. 
The bill further provides permanent authority 
to the local D.C. courts to retain bar examina-
tion and admission fees, independent gift au-
thority, permanent procurement authority for 
motor vehicles and express authority to permit 
other entities to use their facilities. 
Legislation to improve the operations of the 
local D.C. Courts has been enacted into law 
several times over the last decade on a bipar-
tisan basis. I hope this bill will likewise be 
passed in a bipartisan manner. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill.

Whereas, Shenandoah County will celebrate 
the 250th Anniversary of its founding in 2022;

Whereas, since its first indigenous inhab-
itants, almost 500 generations have called this 
area home; and 
Whereas, the county, originally known as 
Dunmore, was established by the Virginia 
General Assembly on March 24, 1772; and 
Whereas the county was renamed Shen-
andoah in 1778 to reflect the occupants dedi-
cation to the Patriot cause during the Amer-
ican Revolution; and 
Whereas the fertile lands have shaped the 
history of this area and allowed Shenandoah 
County to become a leading agricultural pro-
ducer; and 
Whereas, Shenandoah County has a strong 
history of local businesses, farms, healthcare, 
tourism, and manufacturing; and 
Whereas, Shenandoah County continues to 
grow by capitalizing on its distinct character, 
diverse population, and natural beauty; and 
Whereas, Shenandoah County provides its 
citizens an award winning education system, 
bountiful job opportunities, and rich quality of 
life; and 
Whereas, 
Shenandoah 
County 
citizens 
value the County’s history, treasured land-
marks, neighborly spirit, and vibrant commu-
nities; and 
Whereas, the first 250 years of Shenandoah 
County have been fruitful in experiences and 
forward-looking ventures; and 
Whereas, the residents of Shenandoah 
County will gather to commemorate their sto-
ried history and bright future throughout 2022; 
now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the United States House of 
Representatives that we commend Shen-
andoah County on the occasion of its historic 
250th anniversary; and, be it 
Resolved Further, that this resolution be 
presented to the chair of the Shenandoah 
County Board of Supervisors as an expression 
of the U.S. House of Representatives’ con-
gratulations, admiration for the County’s his-
tory and contributions to the Commonwealth, 
and best wishes in all its future endeavors.

HONORING MR. DAN JOHNSON 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize Mr. Dan Johnson, a respected 
servant leader whose dedicated forty-five year 
career in municipal government has led to the 
direct enrichment of numerous communities in 
the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. 
Mr. Johnson earned his bachelor’s degree 
in Political Science from Austin College and 
his master’s degree in Public Administration 
from the University of North Texas where he 
was later named the recipient of the 1995 Dis-
tinguished Alumni award. Additionally, Dan is 
a graduate of the prestigious Public Executive 
Institute of the LBJ School of Public Affairs. 
For several years, Johnson held a variety of 
municipal government positions throughout 
North Texas, including past service as the City 
Manager and Deputy City Manager for the

Governments, and as a Budget Officer for the 
City of Sherman. 
In 1996, Dan began his impressive 25-year 
career with the City of Richardson serving as 
the Deputy City Manager and Chief Operating 
Officer from 1996 until he was appointed City 
Manager in 2012. His active role in economic 
development initiatives would be instrumental 
in fostering the prosperity of communities 
throughout Collin County. 
As a testament to the admiration Johnson 
has garnered in the community, his past lead-
ership roles include serving as the President 
of several organizations including the Urban 
Management Assistants of North Texas, and 
the Texas City Management Association. 
Other notable positions include his current 
service on the Methodist Richardson Medical 
Center Advisory Board, the University of 
Texas at Dallas Development Board, the Advi-
sory Council for the UT Dallas School of Eco-
nomic, Political and Policy Sciences, and as 
the Treasurer and Board Executive Committee 
Member of the North Texas Commission. 
Now as Dan Johnson prepares to begin a 
new season of life following his illustrious ca-
reer, I ask my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing him for his dedication and many con-
tributions to the betterment of the North Texas 
region.

REMEMBERING GEORGIANA 
BRUNET 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the late Mrs. Georgiana 
Smith Brunet, who found her heavenly wings 
on February 9, 2022 at the age of 97 years 
old. She was known to many as the Matriarch 
of Algiers, Louisiana, and was recently hon-
ored as the oldest serving community activist 
in 
my 
hometown. 
Affectionately 
called 
‘‘Bunny,’’ she dedicated her entire life to her 
family, faith, and community. 
Mrs. Brunet attended Illinois State University 
and the Booker T. Washington Nursing Pro-
gram of New Orleans. She was married to her 
late husband Mr. Bernard Brunet, Jr. for 37 
years and together they had five children, her 
pride and joy. 
A devout Catholic, Mrs. Brunet was an ac-
tive parishioner of All Saints Church for over 
71 years where she served on the Social Out-
reach Committee as well as the All Saints So-
dality. She was a member of the All Saints 
Rosary Group/Legion of Mary for over 40 
years. In 2012 her lifelong commitment earned 
her the prestigious Order of St. Louis IX Me-
dallion, an award which honors laypersons 
who have contributed their time and talents to 
the church. The award was presented by 
Archbishop Aymond, the Archdiocese of New 
Orleans at St. Louis Cathedral. 
Mrs. Brunet became an active community 
advocate for the Algiers area, while working 
as a Pediatric Nurse within the community 
over her 30 years. Mrs. Brunet’s community 
activism was also celebrated when she was 
honored at the Algiers Courthouse in 2012 for 
her volunteer work. 
Mrs. Brunet left a lasting mark on many of 
the organizations she actively participated in 
including the Ladies Auxiliary of Peter Claver 
St. Rita’s Court 36, 3rd and 4th degree, serv-
ing as Treasurer; the National Association of 
Letter Carriers (NALC) Auxiliary; Fan Advisory 
Committee of her beloved New Orleans 
Saints; Girl Scouts of America, and Krewe of 
NOMTOC (‘‘New Orleans Most Talked of 
Club’’). 
Mrs. Brunet was lovingly known as ‘‘Mother 
Jugs’’ for her work establishing the Krewe of 
NOMTOC and the Jugs Social Club, of which 
her husband was a co-founder and President. 
Nothing stood in her way of preparing and en-
joying the Krewe of NOMTOC on parade Sat-
urdays. 
Mrs. Brunet kept busy following the activities 
of the New Orleans Council on Aging, attend-
ing events at the Arthur Monday Senior Cen-
ter, craft-making, cooking, lobbying the State 
Legislature, and event planning. 
Beyond her work, Georgiana had a vibrant 
social life. She was truly the life of the party 
and would carefully plan her costumes weeks 
in advance. She was a lively character with an 
undeniable fashion sense, always dressed to 
the nines on every occasion. Additionally, 
Georgiana was an avid traveler, visiting most 
states and several international destinations. 
She was a lover of politics, people, and fun, 
and a member of the Golden Girls Social Cir-
cle. 
Algiers, Louisiana will never be the same 
without her. Her poise, talents and enduring 
love of everyone she touched will live in our 
hearts forever. We will all be better citizens 
because of the mark she left on each of us.

CELEBRATING U.S.-UZBEKISTAN 
PARTNERSHIP 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the enduring friendship between 
the United States and Uzbekistan, and to rec-
ognize the 30th anniversary of diplomatic rela-
tions between our nations, including the 20th 
anniversary of the U.S.-Uzbekistan Strategic 
Partnership. Uzbekistan plays a fundamental 
role in the development of an independent, re-
silient, and democratic Central Asia. It is a 
bourgeoning force for regional economic 
growth and a vital partner in strengthening re-
gional stability and cooperation. 
Since Uzbekistan’s independence in 1991, 
with the fall of the Soviet Union, the United 
States and the international community have 
witnessed Uzbekistan emerge from what was 
once considered one of the world’s most iso-
lated and repressive countries into a nation of 
noteworthy transformational improvements. 
Today, Uzbekistan strives to modernize and 
liberalize the economy; streamline its bureauc-
racy; ease political tension; address human 
rights concerns; and engage with the inter-
national community, attracting foreign invest-
ment. Our friendship continues to flourish. In 
2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce led 
its first certified trade mission to Uzbekistan to 
discuss advancing trade opportunities between 
the two countries, and to open new markets 
for U.S. business interests. 
In 2021, the U.S. Department of State and 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic 
of Uzbekistan launched a successful inaugural 
meeting of the U.S.-Uzbekistan Strategic Part-
nership Dialogue in Tashkent, inspiring a con-
tinued 
constructive 
exchange 
on 
critical 
issues. 
I will continue to be a friend of Uzbekistan 
and support the great strides Uzbekistan has 
made to democratize. I look forward to a long 
and mutually beneficial relationship between 
our two nations.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
LYLES 
CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL CENTEN-
NIAL 
HON. LARRY BUCSHON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
commemorate the 100th anniversary of the 
completion of the Lyles Consolidated School 
located in Gibson County, Indiana. This school 
served as a cornerstone of Lyles Station, a 
town that began as an African American farm-
ing settlement, until its closure in 1955 and 
again today as a museum where the history of 
the site and town are preserved. 
Throughout its history, the Lyles Consoli-
dated School produced exemplary graduates 
including; Alonzo Fields, the Chief Butler for 
Presidents at the White House for 21 years, 
Burniss Priestly, a member of the Tuskegee 
Airmen, Aaron Fisher, the most decorated Afri-
can American soldier from Indiana to serve in 
World War I, and Matthias Nolcox, the first 
principal of Indianapolis’ Crispus Attucks High 
School. 
It wasn’t until 1999 when this outstanding 
piece of our history was recognized and pro-
tected by being added to the National Register 
of Historic Places, an important step in pre-
serving the building after it had fallen to dis-
repair after closure. Today, the Lyles Station 
Historic School and Museum continues the 
tradition of educating visitors on the contribu-
tions, struggles, and achievements of the Afri-
can American Hoosiers who studied and lived 
here. The school is filled with period-correct 
seating, books, and other materials that help 
bring the site to life for those that visit. 
I am grateful to the Hoosiers that painstak-
ingly work to preserve this part of our history, 
and encourage my colleagues and all of their 
constituents to come visit southern Indiana so 
that they can stop by the Lyles Station Historic 
School and Museum to recognize their centen-
nial and contributions to the United States.

February 15, 2022 
Jr. This year, Aurora Community of Faith pre-
sented the Spirit of MLK Award to Dr. Shan-
non-Bannister for her selfless service as an 
ally and advocate for our community. Devoted 
to a cause greater than herself, Dr. Shannon- 
Bannister works tirelessly to take risks and ad-
dress critical issues and concerns in the lives 
of everyday people—just as Dr. King did. 
Dr. Shannon-Bannister dedicated her life to 
serving the community. From founding several 
nonprofit organizations that aid the under-
served to bringing the Aurora Branch of the 
NAACP to Colorado, she has long been en-
gaged in civil rights advocacy and issues im-
pacting marginalized communities. Upon her 
retirement from a 36-year career with the City 
of Aurora, Dr. Shannon-Bannister has focused 
her efforts on Grand Design Inc.—a nonprofit 
organization she founded in 1984 to preserve 
cultural and musical traditions of the Black 
community in Aurora. It is still one of the only 
Black performing arts companies in the city. 
Dr. Shannon-Bannister is a fervent advocate 
and champion for the African American com-
munity, and her commitment—and voice—has 
never wavered from aiding those in need. Her 
extraordinary career and service to our com-
munity epitomize what it means to live a life 
for others. In honoring the legacy of Dr. King, 
I can think of no one more deserving of the 
Spirit of MLK Award. I congratulate and thank 
her for her incredible dedication to our com-
munity.

HONORING 
THE 
CITY 
OF 
LONG 
BEACH 
AS 
THE 
COMMUNITY 
CELEBRATES 100 YEARS SINCE 
ITS FOUNDING 
HON. JAIME HERRERA BEUTLER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the City of Long 
Beach, as the community celebrates 100 
years since its founding in 1922. 
On this historic occasion, I find it important 
to briefly revisit the history of Long Beach. 
Originally purchased as a parcel of land by 
Henry Harrison Tinker in 1880, the land was 
transformed into a small town known as 
Tinkerville. Only a few decades later in 1922, 
the coastal town of Tinkerville would be rees-
tablished under a new name—Long Beach. 
Long Beach has certainly transformed over 
the years. But while physical structures may 
have come and gone, the spirit and resiliency 
of the folks who call it home have not. 
As Southwest Washington’s Member of 
Congress, it’s an honor and privilege to serve 
and represent this special community. I will 
continue working to make sure Long Beach 
remains a great place to live, work, and raise 
a family. 
Once again, I want to honor the City of 
Long Beach, as it celebrates 100 years since 
its founding. May the city and its people flour-
ish for 100 more. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF HAVEN J. 
BARLOW 
HON. BLAKE D. MOORE 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Haven J. 
Barlow. Utah lost a community giant who lived 
to be 100 years old. It’s hard to believe, but 
Haven’s life was nearly cut short when at just 
nine months old a train struck the Model T 
Ford he was riding in, killing his mother and 3 
other passengers. Fortunately he survived and 
lived a full life in service of others. Haven 
served our country as a Navy Ensign in World 
War II and was the longest serving state legis-
lator in Utah history, first elected in 1953 and 
served until 1995. 
Haven’s service to Utah and Davis County 
is immeasurable where he spent much of his 
time focused on matters pertaining to edu-
cation. He led the fight to establish and fund 
the first state vocational institution in Davis 
County—now Davis Technical College, the es-
tablishment of Weber State/Davis Campus, 
and Utah’s creation of the weighted pupil 
index (WPU) ensuring a child can get the 
same level of education regardless of where 
they lived. In addition, Haven helped establish 
the Hill Aerospace Museum, the Freeport Cen-
ter, the restoration of Utah’s Governors Man-
sion and was behind the original Utah Sym-
phony Endowment fund. 
Haven was married to Bonnie Rae Ellison 
for 58 years before her passing and raised 6 
children.

CELEBRATING THE WORK OF WAL-
TER SMITH, EXECUTIVE DIREC-
TOR, DC APPLESEED 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the critically important and remark-
able work of Walter Smith, who, after over 20 
years, is stepping down as the executive di-
rector of the DC Appleseed Center for Law 
and Justice. At DC Appleseed, Walter has 
made significant contributions to the District of 
Columbia on issues ranging from democracy 
to public health to the environment to edu-
cation. 
I have worked closely with Walter in the 
fight for statehood, congressional voting rep-
resentation and home rule for D.C. Walter has 
been one of the intellectual architects of these 
efforts, leading litigation, testifying before Con-
gress and authoring legal opinions. 
Walter has led DC Appleseed’s important 
work on HIV/AIDS, early childhood programs, 
special education, drinking water, the Ana-
costia River and end-of-life care. Last year, 
Walter’s work led to a settlement with a health 
insurer that resulted in the creation of a $95 
million fund to address public health needs in 
D.C. 
Walter has litigated numerous cases before 
the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the D.C. Circuit and the D.C. Court 
of Appeals. Prior to joining DC Appleseed, 
Walter served as Special Deputy Corporation 
Counsel at the D.C. Office of the Corporation 
Counsel, which is now D.C.’s Office of the At-
torney General, where he oversaw major liti-
gation. Prior to his D.C. service, Walter prac-
ticed appellate litigation at Hogan Lovells for 
16 years, where he served as a partner and 
was the full-time director of the firm’s pro bono 
practice. Walter also served as a Lieutenant in 
the U.S. Navy JAG Corps. 
Walter is a graduate of the University of 
Oklahoma and Harvard Law School. After law 
school, Walter clerked for a judge on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. 
Walter has been recognized for his out-
standing legal work. For example, Walter re-
ceived the President’s Award from the Wash-
ington Council of Lawyers in 2011, was 
named one of the ‘‘90 Greatest Washington 
Lawyers of the last 30 years’’ in 2007 by the 
Legal Times and received the D.C. Bar’s high-
est award for public service, the Brennan 
Award, in 2014. He has also enjoyed an active 
role in local musical theater, staring in several 
major productions. 
I ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in recognizing the important contributions 
of Walter Smith, and to congratulate him as he 
steps down as the executive director of the 
DC Appleseed Center for Law and Justice.

brate the life of Mr. Jonathan ‘‘Jon’’ Flagler, a 
beloved community member and firefighter in 
the 33rd Congressional District who passed 
away in the line of duty at the age of 48 on 
January 6, 2022. 
Born on October 9, 1974, Jon was born and 
raised in the neighborhood of San Pedro in 
the City of Los Angeles. He attended Crest-
wood Elementary School, Dodson Middle 
School, and graduated Class of 1992 from 
San Pedro High School. Immediately after 
high school, Jon threw himself into working to-
wards his passion, dedicating his time to help-
ing others by becoming a firefighter. After high 
school, he attended El Camino Community 
College to take fire science classes and then 
later graduated from Rio Hondo’s Fire Acad-
emy. Jon continued his education and grad-
uated with a bachelor’s degree in Fire Admin-
istration from California State University, Los 
Angeles in 2001. 
Jon began his 21-year career as an indus-
trial firefighter with Northrop Grumman Aero-
space in 2002 before being hired by the City 
of Vernon Fire Department later that same 
year. He spent the majority of his career work-
ing at Vernon Fire Station One and Three. In 
2020, Jon relocated to the Los Angeles Coun-
ty Fire Department after the agency took over 
firefighting services for the City of Vernon. As 
a part of the Los Angeles County Fire Depart-
ment, he worked at Fire Station 22 before 
moving to Fire Station 83, located in Rancho 
Palos Verdes, just a few blocks from his child-
hood home. Tragically, Jon lost his life in the 
line of duty—bravely fighting a fire, selflessly 
protecting the community he served.

Jon exemplified the important traits of a fire-
fighter both on the job and off the job. Jon 
was known by friends as always being willing 
to lend a helping hand and for his infectious 
smile that would light up a whole room. As a 
man of faith dedicated to a life of service, 
Jon’s greatest love was always his family. 
Jon is survived by his loving wife Jenny and 
sons Brody and Jack Flagler; his nephews 
Matix, Corey, Van, and his niece Mikiela, and 
his in-laws Dwight, Cindy, and Tracy. May his 
kindness and dedication to selflessness con-
tinue to live on in those he touched with his 
compassionate and welcoming spirit.

HONORING THE HEROIC LIFE AND 
SERVICE 
OF 
RICHARD 
C. 
WOODCOCK, SR. 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 15, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the heroic life of Army veteran 
and Saratoga Springs native, Richard C. 
Woodcock, Sr. 
Richard Woodcock was born on August 7, 
1937 in Saratoga Springs, New York. After 
graduating from Saratoga Spring High School 
in 1958, Richard joined the U.S. Army and 
was subsequently honorably discharged. 
After his time in the military, Richard dedi-
cated his life to serving the town and residents 
of Saratoga Springs. With the help of his fa-
ther, Richard built Eastside Garage at 46 East 
Avenue in Saratoga Springs, which he owned 
and operated for fifty-five years. At Eastside 
Garage, Richard owned several tow trucks 
and was always willing to help his community 
whenever his services were needed, regard-
less of the time or day. He was the official tow 
truck driver of Saratoga Springs and a top pro-
vider for the American Automobile Association. 
After selling Eastside Garage, Richard 
opened a contract hauling business, RCW 
Transport. They delivered sanders and salt 
spreaders for Tarrant Manufacturing out of 
Saratoga Springs. Richard also transported 
materials to the new Tappan Zee Bridge 
Project for Fort Miller out of Greenwich, New 
York. During his retirement, Richard remained 
an active participant in his community. He was 
a member of the Hudson Mohawk Chapter of 
the American Truck Historical, where he orga-
nized performances, worked the front gate, 
and helped with ticket distribution. Richard 
also volunteered at the front desk of Matt’s 
Service Center, which was owned by his busi-
ness rival and lifelong friend Matt Ernst. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I am 
honored to recognize the extraordinary life of 
Richard Woodcock. It is my hope that his ac-
tive spirit and community service will be car-
ried on by those who knew and loved him. 
Richard will be buried with military honors in 
the Saratoga National Cemetery.
