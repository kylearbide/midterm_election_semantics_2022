DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

PRAYER 
Rabbi Barry H. Block, Congregation 
B’nai Israel, Little Rock, Arkansas, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Source of blessing, we come before 
You today asking Your blessings upon 
the United States House of Representa-
tives. 
At this time of grave division, inspire 
these Members of the people’s House to 
reach across every kind of aisle, to 
build new friendships that may grow 
into opportunities for greater under-
standing, seeking shared solutions to 
America’s greatest problems. 
As the winds of war threaten all hu-
manity, inspire the Members of the 
people’s House to work toward peace, 
for the ability to wage peace is a great-
er measure of a nation’s strength than 
the capacity to wage war. 
Consecrate this House to perfect the 
Nation our Founders could not even en-
vision—justice, liberty, freedom from 
persecution, and discrimination for 
every person within our borders. Then 
will this House and our Nation truly be 
blessed. 
Amen. 
f 
THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair has examined the Journal of the 
last day’s proceedings and announces 
to the House his approval thereof. 
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY 
DAVIS) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois led 
the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
WELCOMING RABBI BARRY BLOCK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL) is recognized for 1 
minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise with my friend JOHN BOOZ-
MAN, former Member of this House and 
now a Senator from Arkansas, to wel-
come today’s guest chaplain, my dear 
friend, Rabbi Barry Block of Congrega-
tion B’nai Israel in Little Rock, Arkan-
sas. 
Realizing his love for reformed Juda-
ism at a young age, Rabbi Block earned 
his master of arts in Hebrew letters 
from Hebrew Union College-Jewish In-
stitute of Religion before being or-
dained 3 years following completion of 
his degree. 
Having devoted much of his life to 
the church, Rabbi Block found his way 
to Congregation B’nai Israel in my 
hometown of Little Rock, Arkansas, in 
2013, after serving over 20 years at 
Temple Beth-El in San Antonio, Texas. 
He has served Reform Judaism na-
tionally and regionally as a member of 
the Board of the Central Conference of 
American Rabbis and chair of its reso-
lutions and nominating committees 
and as president of the Southwest As-
sociation of Reform Rabbis. 
He is the loving father of his two 
sons, Robert and Daniel. 
I want to thank Rabbi Block for his 
gracing us with a wonderful opening 
prayer and wish him, his family, and 
his congregation continued success in 
our community of Little Rock.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The Chair will entertain up 
to five further requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H152 
January 10, 2020 
MOURNING THE LOSS OF DUSTIN 
PARKER 
(Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the 
tragic death of Dustin Parker. 
At 25 years old, Dustin was a loving 
father, a hard worker, and a generous 
member 
of 
his 
community 
in 
McAlester, Oklahoma. As a man who 
happened to be transgender, Dustin 
helped found the McAlester chapter of 
Oklahomans for Equality. 
Sadly, Dustin was shot and killed on 
New Year’s Day. While we do not know 
who is responsible for Dustin’s death, 
we do know that transgender Ameri-
cans are disproportionately the victims 
of violent crimes. Last year, more than 
two dozen trans and gender noncon-
forming people were violently killed, 
that we know of. Every death under-
scores the Nation’s need for urgent ac-
tion to address this epidemic. 
Mr. Speaker, our country lost a 
champion for equality. As we continue 
to 
search 
for 
answers 
following 
Dustin’s death, we must continue to 
fight to ensure that all Americans are 
treated with dignity and respect. 
My prayers are with Dustin’s entire 
family for their loss, and my heart goes 
out to our communities bearing this 
pain. 
f 
CELEBRATING NATIONAL 
MENTORING MONTH 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, since 2002, January has been 
recognized 
as 
National 
Mentoring 
Month. We all should recognize the 
positive impacts that mentoring has on 
young people. 
From our servicemembers stationed 
at Cherry Point to the volunteers of 
the Greensboro United Way, the stu-
dents and staff of Wake Forest Univer-
sity to the Journeymen of Asheville, 
North Carolinians remain actively en-
gaged 
in 
mentoring 
opportunities 
across my State. 
According to mentoring.org, at-risk 
youth who were paired with a mentor 
are 55 percent more likely to enroll in 
college, 78 percent more likely to vol-
unteer regularly in their communities, 
and 130 percent more likely to hold 
leadership positions in their careers. 
Mr. Speaker, the numbers speak for 
themselves. Mentoring is a cornerstone 
of the growth and development of 
young people across our country. I 
commend the individuals involved in 
being mentors. 
f 
ADDRESSING THE URGENT PRIOR-
ITIES OF THE AMERICAN PEO-
PLE 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I just 
returned from overseas. I led a delega-
tion of our colleagues, a bipartisan del-
egation, to visit our troops during the 
Christmas holiday; and, of course, we 
all were struck by the extraordinary 
service of these brave men and women 
who are serving our country. 
One of the things they shared about 
was, of course, their concerns about 
things back at home with their fami-
lies. It reminded me that the agenda 
that we develop to address the urgent 
priorities of the American people re-
mains important: to drive down the 
cost of healthcare, to raise family in-
comes and rebuild the crumbling infra-
structure of our county, to take on the 
corruption and self-dealing in Wash-
ington, and to get the government 
working for the people again. 
That is what Democrats have been 
working on in a bipartisan way. We 
have passed over 400 pieces of legisla-
tion; 275 of those bills are bipartisan. 
Sadly, 80 percent of those bills are 
stuck on MITCH MCCONNELL’s desk. 
So, as we return from this trip, I am 
reminded that this is an opportunity to 
call on the Senate majority leader. We 
are working hard to prevent war with 
Iran. We are working hard to hold the 
President accountable for his mis-
conduct. But our most important pri-
ority is to deliver on those promises we 
made to the American people: to drive 
down the cost of healthcare, to raise 
family incomes, to rebuild the infra-
structure of our country, and to get 
government working for the people 
again. 
It is time for the Senate majority 
leader to take those bills up and give 
them a vote. Our men and women de-
serve nothing less. 
f 
OUR MORAL OBLIGATION TO 
ERADICATE HUMAN TRAFFICKING 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, January 
is 
Human 
Trafficking 
Awareness 
Month, so I rise today to renew my re-
solve to eradicate the horrific injustice 
that is human trafficking. 
Human trafficking is a modern-day 
form of slavery, as it strips individuals 
of their freedom and dignity. It has ab-
solutely no place in our society. 
In my part of Minnesota, many of the 
women and children preyed upon by 
human traffickers are Native Amer-
ican. In fact, Minnesota currently 
ranks ninth in the Nation for missing 
and murdered indigenous women. 
As a Member of Congress, I believe 
we have a moral obligation and legisla-
tive duty to protect the most vulner-
able. That is why I proudly support Sa-
vanna’s Act, a bill that will empower 
Tribal law enforcement to address this 
devastating issue. 
I will also ensure that the recently 
created Federal task force on missing 
and murdered Native American women 
coordinates with State, local, and Trib-
al officials to more effectively solve 
unresolved cases and prevent similar 
violence. 
While these are steps in the right di-
rection, our work is far from done. As 
a father, a former law enforcement of-
ficer, and a Member of Congress, I will 
not stop until human trafficking is 
eliminated and the criminals who have 
chosen to exploit others have been 
brought to justice. 
f 
UNITED STATES’ RELATIONSHIP 
WITH IRAN 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, over the last 
week, our relationship with Iran has 
fallen to its most difficult period since 
1979. The United States killed Major 
General Qasem Soleimani, a bad man 
whom we do not mourn, and yet it was 
a 
provocative 
and 
disproportionate 
event. 
Iran responded with missiles on two 
of our military bases. I am grateful, 
thankful that none of our soldiers were 
in that attack and that tensions be-
tween our countries appear to be eas-
ing. 
I hope we can use this moment to as-
sess where we are, how we got here, and 
find the better path that lies ahead. 
First, I call on the administration to 
share the intelligence with Congress 
about the timing and rationale for the 
strike. 
Second, I urge continued de-esca-
lation. We stand less safe in heightened 
tensions with Iran. It is essential that 
we emphasize diplomacy once again. 
Third, I ask that we treat this mo-
ment as an opportunity to redefine our 
relationships with foes and friends 
alike and how we act as a nation. 
We will always defend America’s se-
curity, but we should never create 
needless provocation. As Matthew tells 
us: ‘‘Blessed are the peacemakers: for 
they shall be called children of God.’’ 
f 
HONORING VIC POWER 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Vic 
Power, who retired as the owner of 
Kevin Barry’s Irish Pub in Savannah 
on December 31, 2019. 
Kevin Barry’s Irish Pub was not only 
a stalwart of locally owned business in 
downtown Savannah, but also an excel-
lent representation of Irish heritage in 
our city. 
Although Irish individuals have been 
calling Savannah home since its found-
ing, the Irish potato famine in the mid- 
1800s caused an influx of migration to 
Savannah. By 1860, one in three White 
households could claim Irish heritage. 
Today, Savannah has one of the larg-
est St. Patrick’s Day parades in the

world. This is why it is fitting that, 
when Kevin Barry’s Irish Pub opened in 
Savannah in 1980, it was the first Irish 
pub south of Washington, D.C., to offer 
live music 7 days a week. 
With its live Irish music, cozy inte-
rior, topnotch customer service, and 
quality food, it quickly became a main-
stay. In 2016, Kevin Barry’s even won 
an award for being the most authentic 
Irish pub outside of Ireland. 
With Mr. Power’s retirement, Kevin 
Barry’s will be sorely missed. 
We congratulate Mr. Power on his re-
tirement. We thank him for letting all 
Savannahians and visitors, alike, enjoy 
Kevin Barry’s for the last 40 years. 
f 
UNJUST IRANIAN AMERICAN 
DETENTIONS 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, America 
is less safe when the words and actions 
of our leaders cast unnecessary sus-
picion on our fellow citizens. America 
is less safe when families, including 
children, are targeted by government 
officials based on their ethnicity or by 
their country of origin. 
Reports of unjust, prolonged deten-
tions of Iranian Americans and perma-
nent residents at our borders should be 
alarming to everyone. It calls to mind 
the unjust internment of Japanese 
Americans during World War II. 
My own parents were toddlers in Jap-
anese American internment camps, and 
they, along with 120,000 others, were 
unjustly incarcerated, having com-
mitted no crimes or acts of disloyalty. 
What happened to my family was the 
result of a failure of political leader-
ship. All of us in this body have a duty 
to remain vigilant and to defend the 
dignity of all citizens. To do nothing is 
to be complicit in violating the spirit 
of our Constitution and the individual 
liberties it guarantees.

RURAL AMERICA NEEDS TO BE 
ACCOUNTED FOR IN UPCOMING 
CENSUS 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to call attention to the 2020 Cen-
sus and to emphasize the importance of 
ensuring that rural America is ac-
counted for. 
Our once-a-decade counting of all 
Americans is important for numerous 
reasons. Most importantly, census data 
provides us with a roadmap for allo-
cating hundreds of billions of dollars 
annually in government services. These 
include investments in things like edu-
cation, roads, and bridges, and other 
areas of importance to rural districts 
like mine. 
I appreciate the U.S. Census Bureau’s 
efforts to streamline government du-
ties by including an online response op-
tion this year. However, I am very con-
cerned that rural areas like Kentucky’s 
First Congressional District could get 
left behind. 
Unfortunately, nearly 30 percent of 
my district lacks internet access or 
lacks access to reliable connection. 
This high number is unacceptable and 
could have dire consequences, includ-
ing ensuring that people I serve are ac-
counted for. 
This startling lack of internet access 
in rural America is a call to action for 
Congress to step up to the plate. My of-
fice has worked tirelessly to address 
this issue, including funding critical 
programs in the 2018 farm bill. But we 
must do more to expand internet 
connectivity so that our voices will not 
be undercounted and left behind. 
Without action, small towns across 
Kentucky and our entire Nation risk 
being left behind in the upcoming cen-
sus, an outcome that should be unac-
ceptable to every member of this body. 
f 
CONGRATULATING 
STATE 
FOOT-
BALL CHAMPIONS NORTH SHORE 
SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
on December 21, 2019, the Galena Park 
ISD’s North Shore Senior High School 
football team became back-to-back 
State football champions. 
It was a hard-fought win, but they 
won because they worked together as a 
team displaying much heart and grit 
on the field. This win was the culmina-
tion of an entire year’s worth of prac-
tice and hard work under the leader-
ship of Coach Kay. 
They took nothing for granted and 
showed the entire State that with hard 
work and determination, anything is 
possible. The North Shore Senior High 
School football team made all of the 
North Shore Mustangs and the Galena 
Park ISD community very, very proud. 
As their Congresswoman, I was not 
there, but I was watching from afar 
cheering them on, and I am so happy to 
share their achievement with all of 
Congress on this floor of the House of 
Representatives. 
Congratulations for an amazing win. 
I know we can do it again, and we will 
make it a three-peat.

RECOGNIZING OFFICERS OF 
UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, in honor of Law Enforcement 
Appreciation Day, I rise today to rec-
ognize the officers of the United States 
Capitol Police force for their heroic ac-
tions to save lives as part of their high-
ly trained and committed service to 
this congressional community through-
out 2019. 
When they heard the radio call about 
an unresponsive individual in a car, 
two officers responded and ultimately 
saved the life of a man who had suf-
fered a heart attack. 
Officers administered tactical com-
bat casualty care to the victim of a 
shooting and helped get that person to 
a hospital. 
Three officers saved the life of a man 
who, shockingly, had a heart attack 
during his visit to this Capitol Build-
ing. 
These are only a few occasions in an 
impressive list of heroic actions. We 
owe our gratitude to all of the officers 
of the United States Capitol Police 
force for the hard work they do here. 
I thank all of the police force for 
going the extra mile; not only pro-
tecting and defending us here in the 
congressional community, but for all 
they do in all of our communities.

ation of the bill, H.R. 535.

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
Accordingly, 
the

resolved 
itself into the Committee of the Whole

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chairman, it is an 
honor to fight alongside Representa-
tives DINGELL and KILDEE in protecting 
our water and environment. I also ap-
preciate Chairman PALLONE for work-
ing with us on this critical issue to 
Michigan and the Nation. 
The amendment ensures frontline 
communities like mine who have been 
directly harmed by the lack of urgency 
to address the public health impacts 
due to environmental injustices have a 
true seat at the table when it comes to 
addressing this crisis. 
I grew up in southwest Detroit which 
houses the most polluted ZIP Code in 
the State; where the smell isn’t nor-
mal; where our kids go to schools that 
don’t have clean drinking water, where 
our parks are closed down, literally, 
barred away from residents having ac-
cess to it because the soil is too con-
taminated; and where so many of our 
residents live in fear that the polluting 
industry nearby is killing them. 
Two communities I represent within 
Wayne County, Michigan, found PFAS 
contamination. In the recent Metro 
Times publication, there was a power-
ful, yet tragic, statement on what resi-
dents in 48217 are forced to live with. 
‘‘Gone are the fruit trees and vegetable 
gardens. Residents no longer grow 
produce because the air and the ground 
are too contaminated with hazardous 
substances.’’ 
The amendment before us clearly de-
fines disadvantaged, exposed commu-
nities and ensures that priority for in-
frastructure funding to combat PFAS 
go to these frontline communities like 
our own 48217 and other neighborhoods. 
If we are not intentional about where 
we put our resources to address this 
crisis, then we are not serious about 
universal clean air and water. This 
amendment will ensure that we have 
equitable funding that goes to neigh-
borhoods that have been ignored for far 
too long. 
I urge you to support the frontline 
communities 
amendment 
and 
safe-
guard the health and environmental 
justice of the neighborhoods that have 
historically been victim of structural 
racism and disinvestment. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
BARRAGA´ N), my good colleague and 
partner in this fight who is the cospon-
sor of this amendment. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Chairman, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Too often our communities of color 
are left behind. Too often, they are on 
the front lines of environmental injus-
tice. That is why I am proud to cospon-
sor 
this 
bill 
with 
Representatives 
TLAIB and OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Our amendment makes sure that help 
gets to the people who need it the 
most. It requires the newly established 
PFAS community water systems grant 
program 
to 
prioritize 
communities 
that are disproportionately exposed to 
environmental harms and public health 
impacts from pollution. 
Many of those communities are com-
munities like my very own district. 
Communities of color and low-income 
communities 
are 
disproportionately 
exposed to PFAS contamination. They 
often face a variety of environmental 
threats, such as: exhaust from con-
gested highways, water runoff or air 
pollution from toxic chemical facili-
ties, and close proximity to landfills. 
When a grant application to address 
PFAS contamination is under consider-
ation, these communities that have ex-
posure first and worst should get pri-
ority. It shouldn’t be an afterthought. 
That is why this is a critical first step 
to ensuring the Safe Drinking Water 
Act prioritizes environmental justice. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, again, I sup-
port this amendment and thank my 
colleagues for working on this. 
Growing up in southwest Detroit, the 
stories of the smell, but not only the 
fact that we didn’t understand why 
parks and certain chemicals and so 
forth were exposed to us, is so impor-
tant. That is why this amendment is so 
critically important; not only for 48217, 
but the cities of Melvindale, as well as 
the Delray neighborhood within south-
west Detroit, again, have been exposed 
to PFAS contamination. 
These are two communities, literally, 
steps away from the Detroit riverfront, 
and that is why it is critically impor-
tant for us to push forward on address-
ing the PFAS contamination across 
this Nation. 
I want to thank my colleagues in un-
derstanding why it is important for the 
Great Lakes State of Michigan that we 
need to be able to take care of our 
frontline communities first to really be 
able to ensure that we have access to 
clean water universally. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, I yield such 
time as he may consume to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAL-
LONE). 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, we ob-
viously support the amendment. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, the Safe Drinking 
Water Act already makes special pri-
ority for what is termed ‘‘disadvan-
taged communities’’ which is based on 
affordability criteria. 
I wish my colleagues who offered this 
amendment would have been here last 
night when we passed an amendment to 
support rich communities who have al-
ready funded their cleanup and are al-
lowing them then to dip back into Fed-
eral funds to make the payment. 
So they may have, if they had a 
chance to be here for that amendment, 
voted against communities that have 
already been able to afford to clean up, 
but we are going to dip into this money 
at the expense of poor communities. So 
that is kind of what occurred last 
night. 
This covers a range of low-income 
communities that may have trouble 
paying for infrastructure needs and has 
been widely supported as an appro-
priate function of taxpayer support. 
This amendment creates a broad new 
category that disproportionately ex-
poses, and which would appear to ex-
pand coverage beyond economic factors 
which may actually undermine the 
straightforward support for the poor 
and the disadvantaged already in stat-
ute. 
I 
respect 
the 
desire 
to 
ensure 
prioritization 
to 
communities 
that 
may be particularly hard hit with 
other 
economic 
and 
environmental 
issues, but the workability of the new 
definition has not been closely exam-
ined and may complicate the provi-
sions of resources to those commu-
nities that need it. A better way to do 
this would be to require a rulemaking 
to sort out the best approach to 
prioritize funding to disadvantaged 
people. 
In a letter written by the water com-
munities, one paragraph says—and I 
would hope my colleagues would listen 
to this—because in every community 
we have water companies that are sup-
posed to provide safe drinking water to 
our citizens. So the water companies 
have written to us about this bill. And 
that is the American Water Works As-
sociation, 
the 
Metropolitan 
Water 
Agencies, the National Association of 
Water Companies, the National Water 
Resources Association, the National 
Rural Water Association, and Water 
Environment Federation. 
These are the people who are going to 
provide clean drinking water to our 
constituents, and this is what they say 
about this bill: 
‘‘Unfortunately, H.R. 535 would leave 
municipal water and wastewater sys-
tem customers subject to financial li-
ability 
for 
PFAS 
cleanup 
under 
CERCLA,’’ i.e., the Superfund, ‘‘even in

PFAS disposal. This is in direct con-
trast to the objective of holding pol-
luters responsible.’’ 
I include their letter in the RECORD. 
JANUARY 8, 2020. 
Re Opposition to H.R. 535, the PFAS Action 
Act. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: The undersigned 
organizations 
representing 
the 
nation’s 
drinking water and wastewater utilities are 
writing to express our opposition to H.R. 535, 
the PFAS Action Act of 2019. Unfortunately, 
the legislation fails to protect water system 
customers from liability for PFAS cleanup 
costs. 
We believe that per- and polyfluoroalkyl 
substances (PFAS) should be kept out of our 
nation’s water supplies, and that PFAS pol-
luters should be held responsible. The funda-
mental mission of water and wastewater 
utilities is to protect public health and the 
environment, and in doing so they must also 
be mindful of affordability and the financial 
burden borne by their customers and the 
communities they serve. Utilities are tre-
mendously concerned about what PFAS is 
doing in their communities and, as they have 
done with all previous public health and en-
vironmental challenges, are committed part-
ners in finding a solution to this problem. 
However, Congress must make a distinc-
tion between entities that introduced PFAS 
into the environment, and water and waste-
water systems that are on the front lines of 
cleaning up the contamination. Utilities are 
not the producers of PFAS, but the receivers 
of PFAS and must dispose of water and 
wastewater treatment byproducts containing 
traces of the chemicals. A water system that 
follows all applicable laws in its disposal of 
water 
treatment 
byproducts 
containing 
PFAS should not be held liable under the 
Comprehensive 
Environmental 
Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) 
for any further environmental cleanup costs 
related to these chemicals. Doing so would 
penalize customers twice: once when they 
make investments to remove PFAS from 
their waters, and again when they are forced 
to pay to cleanup PFAS contamination else-
where. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 535 would leave munic-
ipal water and wastewater systems cus-
tomers subject to financial liability for 
PFAS cleanup under CERCLA—even in cases 
where the system followed all applicable 
laws and regulations related to PFAS dis-
posal. This is in direct contrast to the objec-
tive of holding polluters responsible. 
It is particularly disappointing that the 
manager’s amendment proposed for H.R. 535 
would offer a CERCLA liability shield to air-
ports that are required to use firefighting 
foam containing PFAS, but fails to extend 
that same protection to water and waste-
water systems who may be required to re-
move and dispose of PFAS. As receivers of 
PFAS, water utilities should be afforded the 
same liability protections that airports are 
being awarded in the legislation. 
Again, we share the goal of keeping the na-
tion’s waters free of PFAS and holding ac-
countable those entities that are responsible 
for environmental contamination. But be-
cause H.R. 535 would leave water system cus-
tomers unprotected against liability for en-
vironmental cleanup of PFAS, we have no 
choice but to oppose the legislation in its 
current form.

Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, it is just 
amazing that last night, the National 
Journal published an article called: 
‘‘PFAS Bill Could Spark Tort ‘Bo-
nanza’.’’ 
b 0930 
I will read from that: ‘‘An associa-
tion of U.S. trial lawyers with deep lob-
bying pockets and the ear of influential 
Democrats is helping to push a sweep-
ing chemical-regulation package that 
could pave the way for a prolific legal 
bumper crop.’’ 
This is not just a forever chemical 
debate. This is a forever litigation de-
bate, litigation after litigation as 
Superfund sites get established. They 
are there for decades, as I quoted last 
night numerous times. We have Super-
fund sites that have been identified 
that are still unremediated 30 to 40 
years after they were established. 
This bill attempts to use the Super-
fund as the silver bullet to address this 
concern. I mentioned last night, but it 
is a new day: This is the first time in 
the history of the Superfund legisla-
tion that, in the Clean Water Act, we 
are legislatively identifying a chemical 
as hazardous not using the scientific 
process. 
For that and all the other reasons, I 
ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amend-
ment. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 20 OFFERED BY MR.

Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Chairman, I 
ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
the 
amendment be modified in the form I 
have placed at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will re-
port the modification. 
The Clerk read as follows:

Mr. MALINOWSKI (during the read-
ing). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous con-
sent to dispense with the reading of the 
modification. 
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection 
to the request of the gentleman from 
New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection 
to the original request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
The Acting CHAIR. The amendment 
is modified. 
The gentleman from New Jersey is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 535, the PFAS 
Action Act, and my amendment to the 
bill, which gives manufacturers an op-
portunity to be transparent with con-
sumers and make clear that their prod-
ucts are indeed free of PFAS. 
PFAS chemicals are found in coat-
ings that line products like nonstick 
pots and pans, waterproof clothing, and 
grease-resistant 
and 
fast-food 
con-
tainers, items that we use every day 
and rarely think about. We are now 
well aware of the devastating harm 
that these chemicals can cause, like 
growth and learning delays in infants 
and children, an increased risk of birth 
defects, weakened immune systems, de-
creased fertility, and an increased risk 
of cancer. 
Each year, billions of pounds of these 
products are dumped into landfills or 
burned in incinerators, releasing PFAS 
pollutants into the air, water, and soil, 
contaminating the food we eat and the 
water we drink. In my district in New 
Jersey, there are over 133 contami-
nated sites, more than 30 of which are 
schools. 
Right now, consumers have no way of 
knowing for sure whether products like

the water-resistant spray that we put 
on our shoes and jackets or the stain- 
resistant sprays we put on our fur-
niture, rugs, and carpets are or are not 
contaminated with PFAS coatings that 
can harm our health. 
My amendment would alleviate this 
problem. It will add stain-, water-, and 
grease-resistant coatings to the list of 
products eligible for a voluntary label 
indicating the absence of PFAS, which 
will allow consumers to make safer and 
more informed decisions about the 
products that we purchase. 
We must start holding polluting com-
panies accountable for the chemicals 
that they are putting into the products 
that we bring to our homes and give to 
our children, but we should also be giv-
ing companies that do the right thing 
and that protect consumers a way to be 
recognized and a way to be rewarded 
for responsible behavior. 
Mr. Chairman, I look forward to vot-
ing for this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SHIMKUS. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Once again, this 
is simply about greater transparency. 
It is about giving consumers choice. It 
is about American companies that have 
done the right thing that are facing 
competition often from abroad, often 
from companies that have not done the 
right thing, giving them a chance to 
put a credible label on their products 
that says: This is safe. This is PFAS- 
free. 
Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense 
amendment. I hope that everybody ac-
cepts it, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
we 
addressed 
an 
amendment like this last night from 
the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. PIN-
GREE). Very similar, and I will raise the 
same objections. 
I have been here a long time, and I 
actually remember the Alar scare. I 
also remember BPA, bisphenol A. That 
is the plastic—it was a kind of the 
same type—that was going to kill ev-
erybody, and we ought to ban it. We 
went through the scientific process and 
found out that it wasn’t. 
In the meantime, did we need the 
government to offer labeling a ‘‘-free’’ 
product? The answer in the example of 
BPA is no. 
Bisphenol A was used in baby bottles. 
Company retailers that made bottles 
with other substances had no problems. 
In fact, it was a great marketing at-
tempt for them to say that it was BPA- 
free. 
They didn’t need government to do 
that. They did it because of the adver-
tising and the consumer potential to do 
that. 
There will be, and there are, compa-
nies trying to do the right thing. They 
should take advantage of that oppor-
tunity, especially in this environment 
when we are dealing with 7,866 per- and 
polyfluorinated compounds. The debate 
is that every one of those 7,866 com-
pounds is hazardous and destructive to 
individuals. If you are making a prod-
uct, this is a perfect time to be able to 
do that and say that it is PFAS-free. 
Why would we have the government 
do that? Some could argue that this is 
a 
corporate 
perk, 
that 
we 
are 
incentivizing and rewarding companies 
through government action to do some-
thing that if they are good stewards, 
they should be able to do on their own. 
That is why I have some concerns with 
this. 
Mr. Chairman, I include in the 
RECORD another letter from numerous 
of these companies—some you would 
label bad actors; some you would label 
good actors—as they submitted a letter 
in opposition to this overall bill. 
JANUARY 8, 2020. 
TO
THE MEMBERS
OF
THE U.S. HOUSE
OF 
REPRESENTATIVES: PFAS are a large and di-
verse group of chemicals with unique prop-
erties that have been used in a broad number 
of beneficial applications for years. Height-
ened attention to potential health effects of 
certain PFAS has led to an increased public 
concern and interest in new regulatory pro-
tections in this area. 
We understand these concerns and are 
committed to working with legislators, regu-
lators, and all stakeholders to establish risk- 
based standards that protect human health 
and the environment. We also support the 
development of a consistent approach and 
clear timelines for assessing and regulating 
specific PFAS across all relevant federal 
agencies to ensure that government regula-
tions, actions, and communications are co-
ordinated for maximum effectiveness. 
Any federal action should not address 
PFAS as a class or with predetermined out-
comes, but rather should be based on sound 
science and the weight of the scientific evi-
dence. Further, Congress should not cir-
cumvent existing regulatory authorities. 
The Environmental Protection Agency, as 
well as other relevant agencies, should re-
tain their traditional power to study PFAS 
and determine whether to regulate certain 
PFAS. Many provisions included in the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2020, signed into law at the end of last 
year, took important steps towards meeting 
those goals. 
We look forward to working with you on 
this important matter as the legislative 
process continues. We oppose H.R. 535, the 
‘‘PFAS Action Act of 2019.’’

lines for America, American Chemistry 
Council, American Coatings Association,

Mr. SHIMKUS. They say in this let-
ter: ‘‘Any Federal action should not ad-
dress PFAS as a class or with predeter-
mined outcomes, but rather should be 
based on sound science and the weight 
of the scientific evidence.’’ 
As I said before, this is the first time 
in the history of the country that we 
are labeling a chemical formulation as 
toxic 
politically 
using 
political 
science, not science. 
They go on to say: ‘‘Further, Con-
gress should not circumvent existing 
regulatory authorities. The Environ-
mental Protection Agency, as well as 
other relevant agencies, should retain 
their traditional power to study PFAS 
and determine whether to regulate cer-
tain PFAS. Many provisions included 
in the National Defense Authorization 
Act’’—we talked about that a lot last 
night—‘‘for Fiscal Year 2020, signed 
into law at the end of last year, took 
important steps toward meeting those 
goals.’’ There is a list of 30 or 40 orga-
nizations. I am not going to read them 
all this morning. 
I appreciate my colleague’s amend-
ment. We actually were close when we 
were thinking about getting a bipar-
tisan bill to bring to the floor. This 
was one of the provisions that was on 
the 
table. 
My 
friends, 
I 
believe, 
couldn’t say yes, so here we are, fight-
ing this bill that the Senate will not 
take up, and the President will not 
sign, and you will have to wait for the 
next Congress to address this issue. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment, as modified, offered 
by the gentleman from New Jersey

CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-

means the following: 
(A) The Committee on Energy and Com-
merce of the House of Representatives. 
(B) The Committee on the Environment 
and Public Works of the Senate. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, my amendment requires, within 5 
years, a comprehensive report to Con-
gress by the Environmental Protection 
Agency, the EPA, regarding the ac-
tions the Agency will take to clean up 
and remediate PFAS contamination 
sites once we pass the important bill 
before us into law. 
I would like to begin by thanking my 
friend Chairman PALLONE and his staff 
for working with me on this, as well as 
my 
fellow 
Michiganders, 
Congress-
woman DINGELL, Congressman UPTON, 
and Congressman KILDEE, for their bi-
partisan leadership on this bill. 
I am proud that this bill includes my 
bill cosponsored with Representative 
KHANNA, the PFAS Safe Disposal Act, 
which prohibits unsafe incineration of 
PFAS. We need to ensure that when 
PFAS chemicals are destroyed by in-
cineration, PFAS particles are not 
emitted into the air. The monumental 
effort of PFAS cleanup will be for 
naught if PFAS is simply transmitted 
from water and soil into the air we 
breathe. 
We in Michigan know all too well the 
growing threat that PFAS chemicals 
pose to our communities and our water 
resources. They have been linked to 
cancer, damage to both reproductive 
and immune systems, developmental 
issues, and changes in liver, immune, 
and thyroid functions. 
The troubling reality is that both in-
dustry and the EPA itself have known 
about the risks from PFAS chemicals 
for decades. We know, for example, 
that 
industry 
studies 
have 
dem-
onstrated the adverse health effects of 
these chemicals since as early as 1950. 
That is 70 years ago. We also know that 
even though the EPA has recognized 
the risks of PFAS since at least 1995, 
the Agency is continuing to allow new 
PFAS chemicals onto the market to 
this day. 
By passing H.R. 535 into law, we can 
finally begin to reverse decades of the 
EPA’s failure and finally deliver the 
protections 
impacted 
communities 
need in both the short and long term. 
But after decades of the EPA failing to 
treat this matter with urgency, we 
need to make sure that the cleanup 
process that will be set in place, once 
we finally designate PFOA and PFAS 
as hazardous substances, is both timely 
and effective. 
My amendment is a commonsense 
transparency and accountability meas-
ure that requires the EPA to submit a 
comprehensive review to Congress after 
5 years of cleanup efforts. The report 
required by my amendment will in-
clude the number of sites that have to 
be remediated, the types of PFAS 
chemicals present at each site, an anal-
ysis of discrepancies and cleanup be-
tween Federal and non-Federal con-
tamination sites, and more. 
For the sake of our constituents and 
after so many years of inexcusable 
threats to their health, Congress must 
ensure that EPA’s PFAS cleanup ef-
forts are effective. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
in opposition. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI), 
who is the Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and con-
gratulate him on his important amend-
ment. I hope this important study will 
be part of that legislation. 
Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to come 
to the floor to join our colleagues, the 
distinguished chairman of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee and the 
former chair, Mr. UPTON, in their bi-
partisan support of this legislation. 
I salute Congresswoman DEBBIE DIN-
GELL, a crusader in this urgent mission 
to protect our communities from PFAS 
chemicals. 
I also thank Mr. TONKO, the chair of 
the Environment and Climate Change 
Subcommittee of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. 
The list goes on and on, and I will 
name some more. 
Last year, our Members worked re-
lentlessly to pass bold legislation to 
tackle the PFAS crisis. We salute the 
Members whose bills were included in 
the bipartisan National Defense Au-
thorization Act agreement reached by 
the House. 
b 0945 
Unfortunately, at the end of the 
year, the Senate GOP refused to join 
the House to secure full, robust protec-
tions against PFAS chemicals, and key 
provisions were cut from the NDAA, 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act. The Senate GOP obstruction is 
why we are here today. 
We are also here today because our 
distinguished chairman, Mr. PALLONE, 
promised that we would have a chance 
to vote on robust legislation after the 
first of the year. I thank the chairman. 
PFAS chemicals are a serious public 
health threat, contaminating the water 
we drink, the air we breathe, and the 
food we eat. These forever chemicals— 
which do not break down easily—are 
exposing millions of Americans to liver 
disease, asthma, thyroid dysfunction, 
multiple forms of cancer, and further 
health threats. 
Today, nearly all Americans, includ-
ing newborn babies, expectant mothers, 
and children, have PFAS in their 
blood; and up to 110 million people may 
be drinking tainted water, including, 
as our colleagues from Michigan have 
indicated, the challenge in their State 
indicated by the leadership and dem-
onstrated on the floor in a bipartisan 
way on this issue. 
Our colleague from Hoosick Falls, 
New York, Mr. DELGADO, has been a 
champion on this issue. Their contami-
nation from a plastics factory raised 
the level of PFAS chemicals in resi-
dents’ blood to 100 times the national 
average, Mr. SHIMKUS. 
In 
Chincoteague, 
Virginia, 
near 
Maryland, where I grew up, contamina-
tion from NASA Wallops Flight Center 
forced the local community to find an 
entirely new drinking water supply. 
And we thank Congresswoman LURIA 
for her leadership in all of this. 
And Mr. PAPPAS, also with ANNIE 
KUSTER, has a situation in Portsmouth, 
New Hampshire, where contamination 
from Pease Air Force Base poisoned 
the drinking water of thousands of 
residents, including children and in-
fants. 
Mr. Chair, before we won the major-
ity, we had a hearing. It really was 
about a number of issues, environ-
mental justice being one of them. Rev-
erend Barbera brought people from all 
over the country to talk about this. I 
particularly remember our conversa-
tions in the testimony of Peggy Price. 
She came and told the story of her 
family and how they were affected by 
what was happening at Camp Lejeune 
in North Carolina. It was a very sad 
story. Their families suffered, the par-
ents, the children—just a horrible situ-
ation. They were serving our country 
at Camp Lejeune, and they were vic-
timized by the water supply there. 
Particularly egregious, is the epi-
demic of contamination on military 
sites, as I mentioned just now, and 
more than 400 sites across the United 
States are affected. It is unacceptable 
that our men and women who sacrifice 
to keep us safe around the world face 
this danger in their health at home. 
Sadly, some big corporations and the 
EPA have known about the risks from 
PFAS chemicals for decades, but they 
have failed to prevent the spread of 
contamination. The Trump administra-
tion’s EPA is breaking its own prom-
ises every day that it delays and puts 
polluters ahead of the American peo-
ple. 
In stark contrast, the House is tak-
ing action. We are cleaning up commu-
nities by designating PFAS as a haz-
ardous substance by the EPA, which is 
the key barrier to cleaning up military 
and industrial sites.

We are also creating new, robustly 
funded grants, in partnership with 
States, to help with cleanup and reme-
diation efforts. Hopefully, we will be 
adding this important study that Mr. 
LEVIN is proposing to this legislation. 
And we are helping stem the tide of 
further contamination with tough, new 
testing reporting and monitoring re-
quirements, strict limits on the intro-
duction of new PFAS chemicals, limits 
on air emissions, and banning unsafe 
incineration—strong measures to hold 
contaminating companies accountable. 
Last month, the Senate GOP fought 
to prevent many of these lifesaving 
measures from becoming law in the 
NDAA. Now, Senator MCCONNELL will 
have to explain once again to the 
American people why he is blocking 
our bipartisan action to clean up con-
taminated communities. 
I urge a strong vote on this legisla-
tion to keep the American people 
healthy and safe and, again, salute all 
of those who have worked so hard to 
bring this legislation to the floor in a 
bipartisan way. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, may I inquire how much time I 
have remaining. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Michigan has 45 seconds remain-
ing. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, I am prepared to close, and I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chair, while people may have all 
kinds of opinions on the underlying 
issue, this amendment is simply about 
sunshine. It simply is about good gov-
ernment: Will our Federal agencies tell 
our Article I body here what they are 
up to? I think it just makes all kinds of 
sense to ask them to give us a com-
prehensive report after a reasonable pe-
riod of time, so I hope everyone can 
support this amendment. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I am happy to follow the Speaker, 
and I do have great respect for her. It 
gets me in trouble in my district every 
now and then when I talk about our re-
lationship, but it has to be said that I 
can’t allow a revisionist history to re-
port on what occurred, especially on 
the Safe Drinking Water Act and in the 
final negotiations. 
It is well-reported that there was a 
three-corner agreement. One corner 
couldn’t get there, and that is why we 
didn’t have it. I won’t name names. I 
won’t point fingers. But to point this 
over at our friends in the other side of 
the building where they had come to an 
agreement, that is just not accurate. 
I would also point out that, in this 
bill, we are exempting airports from 
Superfund liability. We are not ex-
empting medical devices. We are not 
exempting military contractors. We 
are not exempting water companies. 
We are exempting airports who use, 
probably the most toxic of all these 
chemicals: firefighter foam. Somehow, 
they were able to get a carve-out where 
other companies, industries, could not. 
The only other organization that 
benefited was the Trial Lawyer Asso-
ciation. I want to mention that again. 
It is amazing, the article came out last 
night. I am not sure how that hap-
pened, but it states in the article: 
An association of U.S. trial lawyers with 
deep lobbying pockets and an ear of influen-
tial Democrats is helping to push a sweeping 
chemical regulation package that could pave 
the way for a prolific legal bumper crop. 
Now, where would that happen in this 
bill? Well, it would happen in the Kil-
dee amendment that we passed last 
night, which would federalize informa-
tion publication that States should 
handle. We can get that at the Federal 
level, then the trial bar could go 
through this information. The Pappas 
amendment had unrealistic deadlines, 
so they had this litigation based upon 
not being able to meet a deadline. 
Then you have section 2 of the Super-
fund designation without science and 
unrealistic review deadlines. 
Section 4, toxic labeling of unreal-
istic risks without a review. 
Section 15, Clean Air Act designation 
without science and unrealistic review 
deadlines. 
And the Brindisi amendment, we 
passed, that makes it marginally bet-
ter, but, of course, not good enough for 
us to be able to accept that—or at least 
me—in the vote on the floor. 
So, if this colleague of mine would 
amend this amendment and say let’s 
have transparency on the class action 
lawsuits, then the litigation and the 
legal costs of doing this—we know that 
Superfund designation is not a silver 
bullet to cleanup, and I used this nu-
merous times last night. 
Old Springfield, Vermont, was added 
on the Superfund list, September 8, 
1983. Guess where it is 36 years later? 
Still on the Superfund list. 
Colbert 
Landfill, 
Spokane, 
Wash-
ington, added September 8, 1983. Guess 
what it is? Still a Superfund site 36 
years later. 
We should do a transparency look at 
how much litigation and money has 
been spent, both by the government 
and lawyers, on these Superfund sites. 
And, if we want to talk about trans-
parency, I think that would also be a 
good way. Maybe we could have a bi-
partisan agreement on timelines and 
remediation, 
but 
also 
follow 
the 
money. Where is the money going? 
So this amendment does not require 
informing Congress of private-sector 
actions to clean up PFAS under Super-
fund and is unclear how much cleanup 
is being done by other Federal agen-
cies. Plus, this is something that the 
Government Accountability Office or 
the congressional committees could do 
without such expense to the Federal 
Government. 
Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 22 OFFERED BY MS. SLOTKIN 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 22 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–366. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chair, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 47, after line 15, insert the following: 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 1 year after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Ad-
ministrator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, in consultation with the head of the 
U.S. Fire Administration and other relevant 
Federal departments or agencies, shall re-
port to Congress on the efforts of the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency and other rel-
evant Federal departments and agencies to 
identify viable alternatives to firefighting 
foam and other related equipment con-
taining any PFAS. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 779, the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chair, I rise today 
in support of my amendment to the 
PFAS Action Act, which would require 
the Administrator of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, in consulta-
tion with other relevant government 
agencies, to report to Congress on ef-
forts to identify viable alternatives to 
PFAS firefighting foam and other re-
lated equipment containing PFAS. 
PFAS contamination hits particu-
larly close to home for me and my con-
stituents. We in Michigan are con-
fronting widespread PFAS contamina-
tion in our water, chemicals that we 
know are linked to cancer and other 
diseases. 
This past summer, I toured Straw-
berry Lake, part of Livingston Coun-
ty’s beautiful chain of lakes in my dis-
trict, where foam resulting from PFAS 
buildup is visible in plain sight. 
I held a forum focused on PFAS con-
tamination in Pinckney, Michigan, a 
community that has been under a ‘‘do 
not eat fish’’ advisory for over a year 
and a ‘‘do not touch foam’’ advisory for 
many months. The more than 200 
attendees expressed deep concern about 
the impact of PFAS contamination on 
their health, safety, and livelihoods, 
and had simple questions about how to 
know whether their water is safe to 
drink, eat fish from, or even touch. 
In September, I met with Brighton 
Fire Chief Michael O’Brien and fire 
chiefs from across Livingston County 
and discussed their concerns about ex-
posure to firefighting foam that con-
tains high concentrations of PFAS. 
PFAS 
presents 
alarming 
health 
risks. According to the CDC, exposure 
to PFAS can affect growth, learning, 
and behavior in infants and older chil-
dren; lower a woman’s chance of get-
ting pregnant; increase the risk of can-
cer; and impact the immune system. In

fact, one of my constituents, who spent 
his career as an auto mechanic and was 
exposed to PFAS-contaminated mate-
rials on a daily basis, is now con-
necting his diagnosis of MS, or an 
autoimmune disease, to his exposure to 
PFAS at work. 
In Michigan, the high levels of PFAS 
have been detected in 34 sites, includ-
ing at Diamond Chrome Plating in my 
district. 
In addition, these chemicals have 
been found at some level in municipal 
drinking water serving more than 2 
million people across the State. 
PFAS has been detected in 54 Michi-
gan schools, including 5 schools in my 
district. 
Last summer, the Michigan Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
issued an emergency ‘‘do not eat’’ advi-
sory regarding all fish from sections of 
the Huron River in my district after 
fish from Kent Lake were discovered to 
contain very high levels of PFAS. 
Let me be clear: I believe that access 
to clean water out of your tap is a 
right and not a privilege. 
b 1000 
I believe that environmental security 
is homeland security. If it is threat-
ening the safety and security of your 
family and preservation of your way of 
life, that is homeland security. 
When Michigan families can’t be con-
fident that the water they are giving 
their children to drink won’t make 
them sick or give them a learning dis-
ability; when they can no longer fish 
the rivers or hunt in the areas they 
have hunted for years with their fami-
lies, that is a threat to our security, to 
our way of life. 
It doesn’t matter if you are a Demo-
crat, or a Republican, or an Inde-
pendent, if you are going to hand your 
child a glass of water, you should be 
confident it won’t cause cancer or 
other lifelong health issues. That is 
your family, and that is their safety. 
My amendment would simply require 
the EPA to report to Congress on ef-
forts to identify viable alternatives to 
products and equipment containing 
PFAS, including firefighting foam used 
on our military bases. 
The PFAS Action Act of 2019 does a 
great deal to meet the threat of PFAS 
contamination with robust legislation 
that responds to it. And my amend-
ment will hold Federal agencies ac-
countable for finding viable alter-
natives to prevent further PFAS con-
tamination. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment, al-
though I do not believe I will oppose 
the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from Illinois is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chair, I have no 
speakers and I am prepared to close 
after the gentleman closes. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Illinois has the right to close. The 
gentlewoman from Michigan is recog-
nized. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Chair, I ask for 
the bill to be supported, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
the 
gentlewoman 
brings up an issue about firefighter 
foam. She talks about military instal-
lations. She does not talk about com-
mercial aviation and waterway issues 
which are exempted in this bill. 
Again, I am not sure why we are 
wanting to clean up all PFAS contami-
nation, the world is ending, but we ex-
empt airports. We don’t exempt med-
ical devices. 
Let me hold up this. This was used 
last night. This is a medical device 
that is inserted into a child, maybe an 
unborn child, to close a hole in the 
heart. FDA said this is safe to insert 
into a heart. You want to talk about 
daily exposure? Here is daily exposure 
in an infant child. 
So the nexus between the gentle-
woman’s amendment and this debate is 
that maybe when we are investigating 
firefighter 
foam 
for 
alternatives, 
maybe we are going to investigate al-
ternatives for this type. 
FDA has approved this. So why are 
we going to possibly ban chemicals? 
We also mentioned last night that 
the Food and Drug Administration has 
claimed PFAS lining for food packages 
is safe. So we already have government 
entities that have investigated por-
tions of the PFAS world. 
Remember, we are talking about 7,866 
different permutations; not one chem-
ical, not two chemicals, but 7,866. And 
this is the first time in the history of 
our Nation that, without science and 
due diligence, we are going to label a 
chemical as toxic. That is part of the 
objection. 
Let’s use real science. I get beat up 
all the time, being a science-denier, cli-
mate change. 
Here, my friends on the Democrat 
side aren’t ready to rely on science to 
address each of these 7,866 different ap-
plications. In fact, they are trying to, 
in this legislation, cause a rush to 
judgment, create an inability for the 
EPA to make a decision. So then, the 
companies can be sued because there is 
no way they can meet the timelines 
based upon this bill. 
I would like to also read from the 
American Council of Engineering Com-
panies letter, a letter that I will ask, 
at the appropriate time, to submit to 
the RECORD; and it says this: ‘‘By des-
ignating certain PFAS chemicals as 
hazardous substances under CERCLA,’’ 
which is the Superfund, ‘‘as called for 
in H.R. 535, we are concerned that such 
action could upset the progress already 
made to address this challenge, divert 
resources away from more pressing 
threats to water quality, and impose 
significant costs and liability on our 
water utility clients and the rate-
payers they serve.’’ 
Mr. Chairman, I include the letter I 
just referenced in the RECORD. 
AMERICAN COUNCIL OF 
ENGINEERING COMPANIES, 
Washington, DC, January 9, 2020. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. GREG WALDEN, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
PALLONE
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER WALDEN: On behalf of the American 
Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC)— 
the business association of the nation’s engi-
neering industry—we wish to express our 
concerns over H.R. 535, the PFAS Action 
Act. While we agree that aggressive steps are 
needed to protect water resources from per- 
and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) con-
tamination, we believe that ongoing efforts 
at the federal level to develop risk-based reg-
ulations offer a more effective approach to 
address this problem. 
ACEC represents over 5,500 engineering 
companies and thousands of engineering pro-
fessionals who work on a daily basis to im-
prove the nation’s water infrastructure and 
protect human health and the environment. 
While PFAS chemicals have been in wide use 
for many decades, concerns have emerged in 
recent years regarding the health effects of 
certain types of PFAS. In response to this, 
federal and state regulators, as well as water 
supply, wastewater and other stakeholders 
are working together to define the public 
health risks of the PFAS chemicals as well 
as consideration of technologies to cost-ef-
fectively mitigate those risks. 
The Council supports this deliberative, 
consistent and data-driven approach to de-
veloping risk-based PFAS standards. By des-
ignating certain PFAS chemicals as haz-
ardous substances under CERCLA (Super-
fund), as called for in H.R. 535, we are con-
cerned that such action could upset the 
progress already made to address this chal-
lenge, divert resources away from more 
pressing threats to water quality, and im-
pose significant costs and liability on our 
water utility clients and the ratepayers they 
serve. 
We would respectfully urge the House to 
reconsider this approach, and instead work 
to support and where necessary enhance the 
existing regulatory framework and action 
plan. 
Sincerely, 
LINDA BAUER DARR, 
President & CEO. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chairman, I al-
ready 
asked 
for 
inclusion 
in 
the 
RECORD a letter from the local munic-
ipal water plants, or the rural water 
associations, or the for-profit-owned 
water companies who said this makes 
it more difficult for us to clean up the 
water. We are going to be held to 
Superfund liability. We have to pay the 
court costs. 
Now we have exempted airports. We 
haven’t exempted the water companies. 
That is really just a pass-through. 
They are receiving, they are cleaning 
up, and then they are disposing, but we 
are not going to exempt them. We are 
going to exempt airports. 
We are not going to exempt medical 
device manufacturers who are saving

the lives of unborn children who have 
daily exposure of PFAS; and this is a 
lifesaving application. 
This is just one of many. I could pull 
up heart stents. Last night we also 
talked about F–16s and our defense in-
dustry. 
Maybe, with this amendment, we will 
do due diligence and find a suitable 
chemical formula that will replace 
this. So I applaud it. I think it is well 
thought of. It is meaningful. 
I would also like to, in the end, be-
cause this will probably be my last 
time to be able to talk on this. We, on 
both sides of the aisle, really need to 
thank legislative counsel, because of 
the short timeframe they had in the 
amendment offerings, their response to 
the majority’s concerns and writing. 
And actually, obviously, we are prob-
ably more difficult because we are try-
ing to really dig in and find the fal-
lacies of the coming amendments. 
So my personal thanks to legislative 
counsel and professional staff who 
worked tirelessly on behalf of both 
sides. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

So the amendment was agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chair,

No. 11 and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 10. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CLAY). There 
being no further amendments, under 
the rule, the Committee rises. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR) having assumed the chair, 
Mr. CLAY, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration 
the bill (H.R. 535) to require the Ad-
ministrator of the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency to designate per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
substances 
as 
haz-
ardous substances under the Com-
prehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act of 
1980, and, pursuant to House Resolution 
779, he reported the bill, as amended by 
that resolution, back to the House with 
sundry further amendments adopted in 
the Committee of the Whole. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered. 
Is a separate vote demanded on any 
further amendment reported from the 
Committee of the Whole? If not, the 
Chair will put them en gros. 
The amendments were agreed to. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I have a motion to recommit 
at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentlewoman opposed to the bill? 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. I am 
in its current form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mrs. Rodgers of Washington moves to re-
commit the bill H.R. 535 to the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce with instructions 
to report the same back to the House forth-
with, with the following amendment:

born child (as defined in section 1841(d) of 
title 18, United States Code)’’ before the pe-
riod at the end. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington (dur-
ing the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the motion be 
considered as read. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Washington is recognized for 5 minutes 
in support of her motion. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, this motion is the last oppor-
tunity to amend the bill, and it does so 
without delay in passage. 
We all agree that PFAS chemicals 
that present health risks to the public 
should be cleaned up as quickly as pos-
sible, but it should be done according 
to the best available science. 
The majority often likes to claim 
that they are the party of science. Un-
fortunately, this bill ignores science 
and facts for scoring political talking 
points by grouping together an entire 
class of PFAS chemicals. Some of 
these chemicals are essential to life-
saving medical devices; others provide 
for cutting-edge technologies in aero-
space that are critical to our national 
security. 
By ignoring scientific evidence, this 
bill would kill innovations that could 
help further lift people’s standard of 
living and save lives. 
I understand and share frustrations 
for slow cleanup of the dangerous 
PFAS chemicals. In my own district, 
Fairchild Air Force Base and Airway 
Heights, Washington, are dealing with 
PFAS. However, we just passed bipar-
tisan 
legislation 
based 
on 
science 
through the NDAA that will ensure 
that affected communities are cleaned 
up quickly. This bill would ignore 
those efforts. 
It is unprecedented that Congress 
would unilaterally classify chemicals 
under CERCLA. By doing so, Congress 
will designate communities like Air-
way Heights a Superfund site, signifi-
cantly harming their ability to attract 
new investments and hurting property 
values. 
Instead of trying to score political 
points, we should be proud of the bipar-
tisan achievement of the NDAA and 
continue to work to clean up our com-
munities and get results. 
This amendment is a good faith ef-
fort to improve this legislation in a 
way that enhances its efforts to pro-
tect 
all 
Americans 
from 
harmful 
chemicals. 
Section 5 of H.R. 535 seeks to guar-
antee protection of vulnerable popu-
lations from potential PFAS dangers in 
their drinking waters. It states that 
the new rules ‘‘shall be protective of 
the health of subpopulations at greater 
risk.’’ 
The Safe Drinking Water Act already 
identifies pregnant women as an at- 
risk group. However, there is not just 
one. When it comes to pregnant women 
who are at risk, there are two people at 
risk: the pregnant woman and the un-
born child. 
The science is clear. Technology 
today allows us to look inside the 
womb. We see the baby’s development 
day by day, week by week. That person 
is the most vulnerable population that 
should be protected. 
This motion to recommit is simple; it 
is clear; it is direct. It clarifies that 
the protection of vulnerable popu-
lations must include any unborn child. 
Yesterday, Chairman PALLONE recog-
nized the potential harm these chemi-
cals can have on child development. 
Today, Speaker PELOSI reiterated the 
importance of protecting expectant 
mothers. By rejecting this amendment, 
you would be further denying the 
science of the development of a child in 
the womb. 
This motion is consistent with policy 
that EPA itself has employed: consid-
ering the impact of chemical exposures 
to babies in the womb. For example, in 
2011, the EPA, under President Obama, 
decided to regulate certain chemicals 
in drinking water based in part on the 
impacts to the in utero person. 
Congress also passed bipartisan legis-
lation, a law in 2004, the Unborn Vic-
tims of Violence Act, recognizing the 
personhood of an unborn child. 
This motion makes a small but vital 
improvement to this bill. It is an im-
provement that is necessary to pre-
serve the central goal of the bill’s spon-
sors: 
protecting 
vulnerable 
popu-
lations. 
If that is the majority’s goal, then 
this amendment should be accepted. It 
does not strike or delay anything in 
the bill. It only clarifies what is con-
sidered a vulnerable population based

on the same language in the bipartisan 
2004 act. 
Most importantly, it protects the un-
born child, something that I hope ev-
eryone in this room can agree should 
be one of our greatest priorities: to 
protect people before they are born and 
at every stage of their life. 
I urge my colleagues to support 
science by supporting my motion to re-
commit. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CLAY). The gentlewoman from Michi-
gan is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I have 
great respect for my colleague, but I 
oppose this amendment because it is 
really nothing more than a political 
stunt. 
This bill will protect communities 
across 
this 
country. 
The 
drinking 
water standard in this bill will be pro-
tective of the health of populations at 
greater risk, what we generally call 
vulnerable populations. 
That requirement was opposed by the 
Republicans. 
Mr. 
SHIMKUS
had 
an 
amendment to strike that provision of 
the bill. He opposed protecting vulner-
able populations. I deeply respect my 
colleague, but he opposed it every step 
of the way; and yesterday, he withdrew 
that amendment. 
If Republicans want to protect vul-
nerable populations, including preg-
nant women, infants, and children, 
they should support this bill. 
Let’s be very clear: PFAS is an ur-
gent health and environmental threat, 
period, and no one can deny that. 
The number of contamination sites, 
nationwide, is growing at an alarming 
rate, including our military bases—al-
most 400 military installations in this 
country. 
Developed in the 1940s, PFAS is a for-
ever chemical. It is in the blood of 
more than 99 percent of Americans. It 
poses potential health risks. We know 
it. EPA has known the risk for decades 
and allowed this contamination to 
spread. 
EPA is not going to take care of this 
problem. Congress needs to act. The 
longer we wait, the worse the contami-
nation becomes. The time is now to act 
on the PFAS Action Act. We have got 
to do it together. The American people 
count on us. 
The bill is a strong and serious pack-
age, and it is supported by some Repub-
licans. It will jump-start cleanups. It 
will get PFAS out of our drinking 
water. It will limit PFAS in the air. It 
will limit PFAS in our rivers and 
streams. It will drive and require com-
prehensive testing for PFAS, and it 
will give our first responders and con-
sumers tools to protect themselves. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this motion to recommit and urge 
Members to support the underlining 
bill so we can work together to enact 
laws that protect the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
RECORDED VOTE

mit will be followed by a 5-minute vote

House adjourns today, it adjourn to 
meet on Monday next, when it shall 
convene at noon for morning-hour de-
bate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
HARDER of California). Is there objec-
tion to the request of the gentleman 
from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise for 
the purpose of inquiring of the major-
ity leader the schedule for the week to 
come, and I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House 
will meet at noon for morning-hour de-
bate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, 
with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the 
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning- 
hour debate and noon for legislative 
business. 
On Thursday, the House will meet at 
9 a.m. for legislative business, with last 
votes of the week expected no later 
than 3 p.m. 
We will consider several bills under 
suspension of the rules. The complete 
list of suspensions will be announced 
by the close of business today. 
The House will consider H.R. 1230, the 
Protect Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act. This bill ensures that 
victims of age discrimination in the 
workplace can enforce their rights so 
that older Americans are able to 
strengthen our economy by continuing 
to contribute their talents to the work-
force, a proposition that I personally 
believe is very important. 
In addition, the House will consider 
H.J. Res. 76, a Congressional Review 
Act resolution of disapproval of the De-
partment of Education’s borrower de-
fense to repayment rule that leaves 
student loan borrowers who were de-
frauded by their educational institu-
tions with little or no recourse.

through those bills. There were a few 
bills that the Speaker had referenced 
earlier this week that would also be 
considered. Congresswoman LEE’s reso-
lution to repeal the 2002 AUMF, and 
there was also some legislation by Con-
gressman KHANNA that would eliminate 
the ability for the administration to 
use certain funds related to Iran. 
I wanted to ask if those two bills 
were going to be part of that package 
for next week, and I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. That is a possibility, but 
they have not yet been scheduled. 
Mr. SCALISE. As it relates to the 
War Powers Act, obviously, we had a 
heated debate on the floor yesterday. 
We have had a robust debate for 
years in this House on whether or not 
to modify and make changes to the 2002 
AUMF. It has been a constant debate. 
There has been a lack of an ability to 
form consensus, clearly, on both sides. 
I know the gentleman is aware there 
are a number of Members on our side 
who have brought up this issue before, 
as well as Members on your side. 
Yesterday, we were literally in the 
middle of a crisis. We had just taken 
out one of the worst and most brutal 
terrorists 
that 
we 
have 
seen, 
in 
Soleimani. I haven’t seen a lot of dis-
agreement that he was a brutal ter-
rorist. The Obama administration des-
ignated him as the head of a terrorist 
organization, and he was in violation of 
international law that prohibited him 
from being in Iraq. 
In the time of crisis, instead of hav-
ing a conversation separate from that 
on actual changes to the AUMF, if that 
is where my friend’s majority would 
like to go—clearly, again, on our side, 
there were people who were interested 
in having that debate. It was dis-
appointing that, instead, we went into 
what turned out to be more of an effort 
to take a cheap shot at the administra-
tion by bringing a resolution that had 
absolutely no effect of law. 
If the AUMF is going to be changed, 
it has to be an act of Congress. I know 
the gentleman is aware of that. On our 
side, we are aware of that, too. Instead 
of trying to engage in that kind of con-
versation, debate, and negotiation, it 
was just a resolution that everyone 
recognizes would not have made any 
changes to the AUMF. 
Why, during this time that we are in 
right now, was that the path to go, as 
opposed to trying to have a sincere de-
bate on whether or not real changes to 
the AUMF should take place? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his question. 
As to the issue of authorizations of 
military force consistent with the War 
Powers Act and consistent with the 
Constitution of the United States, 
which sets forth clearly that it is the 
Congress and only the Congress that 
can declare war, we believed and still 
believe it was necessary to move as 
quickly as possible to clarify that the 
expectation of the Congress of the 
United States is that it would be in-
cluded in any conversation, discussion, 
and debate with reference to whether 
or not we ought to take an act of war. 
Without getting into the complex-
ities, I would call your attention to an 
extraordinarily good article that was 
in today’s paper by Jim Webb, the 
former Secretary of the Navy and a 
Navy Cross awardee who fought in 
Vietnam and who served in the United 
States 
Senate, 
with 
reference 
to 
whether or not legally the action that 
was 
taken 
by 
the 
President 
was 
justified. 
b 1130 
Let me say something, Mr. Speaker. 
I would hope this debate—and I said 
this yesterday during the course of the 
debate—would not descend into dema-
goguery. 
I was very disappointed with a re-
mark that was made by one of the Re-
publican Members of this House when 
he said, they are ‘‘in love with terror-
ists,’’ referring to the Democrats, pre-
sumably, who were proponents of as-
suring that the War Powers Act would 
be honored by the President and with 
the constitutional requirement that we 
are the ones, and only ones, who de-
clare war. Not one of us loves terror-
ists. 
He went on to say: ‘‘We see that they 
mourn 
Soleimani 
more 
than 
they 
mourn our Gold Star families.’’ 
Now, that is interesting from, frank-
ly, a member of a party whose Presi-
dent criticized very, very sharply and 
directly a Gold Star family, the Khans. 
It is ironic coming from a party whose 
President—our President, but of the 
Republican Party—said he didn’t re-
spect John McCain, one of America’s 
great war heroes, who showed such 
courage. 
So my point to the gentleman is that 
I would hope—Proverbs 19:5 says this: 
‘‘A 
false 
witness 
will 
not 
go 
unpunished, and he who speaks lies will 
not escape.’’ 
I would hope the gentleman that ut-
tered these comments would apologize 
to every Member of this side of the 
aisle. The gentleman correctly, just 
now, I thought, made a very calm and 
correct statement with respect to that 
we ought to have a substantive debate. 
I have criticized this Congress, others 
have criticized this Congress, from 
both sides of the aisle, for not, over the 
last 30 years, passing Authorizations 
for Use of Military Force. The last one 
we did, of course, was in 2001 and 2002. 
The gentleman asked whether those 
bills may come to the floor. We voted 
on them, as you know, previously. 
Those amendments passed. They were 
in the National Defense Authorization 
Act to directly address the issue of au-
thorization of military forces and the 
expenditures of funds in military ac-
tion. Nobody laments the loss of Mr. 
Soleimani, who did, in fact, not only 
plan, but execute and fund terrorist ac-
tions that resulted in the loss of Amer-
ican life. 
Having said that does not absolve us 
from the responsibility for policies 
which are akin to or are acts of war. 
Without going further into that, let me 
refer to what we did yesterday, and let 
me read from this War Powers Act, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Congressional Action, paragraph (c): 
‘‘Concurrent resolution for removal by 
President of United States Armed 
Forces. 
‘‘Notwithstanding subsection (b), at 
any time that United States Forces are 
engaged in hostilities outside the terri-
tory of the United States, its posses-
sions and territories without a declara-
tion of war or specific statutory au-
thorization, such forces shall be re-
moved by the President if the Congress 
so directs by concurrent resolution.’’ 
That is what we passed yesterday. 
Many Republicans, Mr. Speaker, said, 
well, this is an act that has no con-
sequence. I would hope that none of us 
believes that the expression of opinion 
by the Congress of the United States 
by majority vote in each House has no 
consequence. If that is the case, we are 
in a bad time in our democracy. 
So, what we did yesterday was con-
sistent with section (c) of section 1544 
regarding congressional action, and it 
is exactly what we did yesterday. 
It will go to the Senate. It will have, 
as we understand from the Parliamen-
tarians in the Senate, privileged sta-
tus, meaning that the Senate will have 
to consider that, and also meaning that 
it can be passed or defeated by a major-
ity vote. 
This is a serious time. Taking the 
kind of military action we took was a 
serious step. Many of us were not very 
pleased with the lack of substantive in-
formation that we received at the 
briefing this week. Obviously, many 
Members of the United States Senate 
were not pleased as well. 
So I would say to my friend, Mr. 
Speaker, it is important that this 
body, confronted with one of its most 
important and serious and consequen-
tial decisions—that is, the declaration 
of war and military action against an-
other nation—that it be debated seri-
ously without pejoratives being pro-
jected at either side, without invective 
similar to the one that I just read, and 
without the aspersions that somehow, 
if you believe the Constitution of the 
United States requires the Congress to 
act before we can take actions of war, 
that somehow that implies that you 
are in bed with or temporizing about or 
favorable to those who commit terror. 
That is a McCarthy tactic. It is high-
ly offense. And, if said on this floor, 
would be subject to the words being 
taken down and the Member not being 
allowed to speak again on this floor 
during that day. 
Mr. Speaker, let me, in closing on 
this response, simply say to the Repub-
lican whip that I agree with his 
premise that we ought to have a care-
ful, adult, substantive discussion about 
policies that may plunge this Nation 
into war. That is our duty. That is 
what our citizens expect of us.

I think we had that yesterday. Strike 
that. I think in some instances we had 
a serious discussion, but in some in-
stances there was too much invective 
that we were giving aid and comfort to 
terrorists. 
That is a slippery slope if we cannot 
discuss what posture the United States 
ought to be in and exercise our con-
stitutional duties to decide whether 
this Nation ought to go to war with a 
foreign country, with another nation. 
Hopefully, we can have that in the fu-
ture, because it is one of the most con-
sequential debates that this body ever 
has. 
Mr. Speaker, I will tell the gen-
tleman, again, that we may be taking 
up additional legislation consistent 
with the War Powers Act. I believe the 
Senate, hopefully, will, next week or— 
at the latest, I think they have 15 days 
or 10 days to consider it and put it on 
the Senate floor for a vote so that we 
can transmit to the President of the 
United States Congress’ view on how 
carefully we ought to approach these 
issues. 
Very frankly—I will say, sadly— 
there is much sentiment on this side of 
the aisle that the Commander in Chief 
does not address these issues carefully 
and thoughtfully and in concert with 
his advisers and the advisers in the 
Congress of the United States. We had 
no consultation. We didn’t even have a 
notice, much less consultation of this 
action. 
No one, I would close with, laments 
the loss of a life who has sponsored, 
funded, and advocated terrorism. But 
this is not about him. It is about us. It 
is about our Constitution. It is about 
our responsibility. It is about how 
these decisions ought to be made. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, to start 
with, the comment that the gentleman 
referenced on the floor yesterday, I will 
read from a statement from the gen-
tleman who made that comment yes-
terday: ‘‘Let me be clear: I do not be-
lieve Democrats are in love with ter-
rorists, and I apologize for what I said 
earlier this week.’’ 
So the gentleman has apologized for 
that statement. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate that, and I thank the gentleman 
for calling that to my attention. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I point 
that out and that that not be used for 
any kind of justification for the other 
disagreements and issues and concerns 
we had with what happened on the 
floor yesterday. 
Frankly, there were statements made 
on the gentleman’s side as well that I 
think ought to be addressed, apologized 
for. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, if the gen-
tleman would call my attention to 
those statements and the speakers of 
those, I would be happy to oblige and 
talk to them. 
I really do believe, Mr. Speaker, this 
issue should be handled in the most re-
sponsible and respectful way possible, 
because it is one of the most serious, if 
not the most serious, issues with which 
we will deal. And we ought to deal with 
one another based upon the intellec-
tual 
arguments, 
the 
constitutional 
premises, and the law, not on personal-
ities or assertions of malintent. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. 
First of all, to start with, it is the 
President’s not just authority, but it is 
the President’s responsibility under 
the Constitution as our Commander in 
Chief to keep this country safe. Presi-
dent Trump has made it very clear that 
he is going to protect this country 
from terrorists or people who want to 
do us harm domestically or abroad. 
In the case of Soleimani, there was a 
redline issued a long time ago. 
I know, in the past, previous admin-
istrations have issued redlines and 
then let those lines be blown through 
without taking any action, and I would 
argue that makes our country less safe 
when people don’t think we are going 
to back up our words with actions as 
not just the greatest military force in 
the world, but the greatest defender of 
freedom throughout the world, anyone 
who seeks freedom, including people in 
Iran who seek freedom today from this 
oppressive regime. 
They have one place they can look 
to, and that is the United States of 
America. That is what makes us such a 
great nation is that we don’t shed our 
blood to conquer more land; we shed 
our blood to keep people safe, not just 
here in America, but to provide free-
dom all around the world to anyone 
who seeks it. 
The fact that President Trump main-
tained a redline that was crossed is 
something we all should applaud. 
And I would say this. You can go 
back to when President Obama was in 
office and Osama bin Laden had been 
the number one target of this country 
since the September 11 attacks, and 
President Obama made the decision. It 
was his call to take out bin Laden 
when they thought—they weren’t posi-
tive, but they thought—they might 
have a real intelligence understanding 
of where he was. And the President 
made that call. 
We had a lot of disagreements with 
President Obama during that time on 
policy, but we applauded that decision. 
We united behind that decision because 
it was the right thing to do to take out 
a terrorist who had been a major 
threat to our country. 
By the same token, I understand that 
your side has a lot of differences with 
the President. I just wish in a time like 
that, when everyone acknowledges how 
brutal a terrorist he was and he crossed 
a redline—he was in Iraq plotting to 
kill more Americans. We don’t have to 
wonder if he was going to do it, because 
he has a decades-long history of killing 
Americans. The blood of hundreds of 
our men and women in uniform were on 
his hands, and no one disputes it. 
And so he is taken out by a call that 
I think is the right call by our Presi-
dent to take him out in Iraq, which the 
2002 AUMF gives him the authority to 
do, the Constitution gives him the au-
thority do. 
Again, if there are some that didn’t 
want the President to have that legal 
authority, that debate should happen 
here under the guise of changing the 
law, but the law gives the President 
that authority. Congress gave that au-
thority to the President in 2002. I 
wasn’t here. I know the gentleman was. 
It was heavily debated. 
b 1145 
But ultimately, that law was passed, 
and that law is still on the books 
today. If there is a desire to change the 
law, that debate should happen, not 
through a resolution in the middle of 
this conflict, where missiles are being 
fired back and forth, but where we can 
actually talk about changing the law 
in a responsible way that focuses on 
the longer-term objective; not just to 
try to undermine the President in the 
middle of him acting out his duties as 
Commander in Chief under the Con-
stitution and under all legal authority. 
There are Obama administration offi-
cials, multiple Obama administration 
officials who, just in the last few days, 
very 
publicly 
said 
that 
President 
Trump had the full legal authority to 
take the action he did. 
Now, we can debate whether or not 
you think he should have done it. I 
think he should have. I am glad that 
Soleimani is no longer on this planet 
plotting to kill more Americans, which 
is what he was doing illegally in Iraq. 
And that, ultimately, is something 
that we can debate. 
But a lot of us felt it was inappro-
priate to be bringing a resolution, not 
to change the War Powers Act, not to 
have this serious discussion about 
whether or not the 2002 AUMF should 
still be in place as it was; but to just 
take a cheap political shot at the 
President in the middle of this. 
There was a Presidential candidate 
just yesterday, Democrat Presidential 
Candidate, a major candidate for Presi-
dent, who said innocent civilians are 
now dead because they were caught in 
the middle of an unnecessary and un-
warranted military tit-for-tat. 
So, in essence, equating the killing of 
one of the most brutal terrorists, who 
killed hundreds of Americans, and plot-
ting to kill more, equating that to Iran 
shooting down an airplane and another 
176 people dead because of Iran’s ac-
tions, the two of those are not on the 
same level. 
Those kinds of comments are unnec-
essary as well. I am not sure what is 
unwarranted 
about 
taking 
out 
Soleimani, if that is what he is sug-
gesting, and others have suggested it 
too. 
So, again, we can have that disagree-
ment. But the legislation was not only 
untimely, but it wouldn’t even achieve 
the purpose that many on both sides of 
the aisle would like to see, and that is 
a real discussion about whether the 
War Powers Act operates properly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H167 
January 10, 2020 
Frankly, there are many scholars 
who suggest the War Powers Act may 
be unconstitutional. We have never 
challenged it in the courts. On a num-
ber of fronts there were times when 
President Obama took action, many 
times, using drone strikes, using other 
attacks, where he never notified us. 
I surely wasn’t notified in advance of 
the Bin Laden killing. I am not sure if 
the gentleman from Maryland was no-
tified by President Obama in advance 
of the Bin Laden killing, and I am okay 
with that. I don’t think the President 
needed to get permission. He notified 
us afterwards, which is what the law 
requires, by the way. The law does re-
quire notification after. 
I think it would be irresponsible to 
require the President to notify Con-
gress prior to the taking out of a ter-
rorist every time they are trying to 
take out a terrorist. 
Again, President Obama used that 
authority multiple times to take out 
terrorists without prior notification of 
Congress, but clearly meeting other 
legal requirements along the way. If 
those legal requirements should be 
changed, let’s have that debate. 
I haven’t seen that legislation come 
forward. Maybe the gentleman is going 
to bring the legislation to the floor 
next week that would repeal the 
AUMF. I think that would be an unwise 
move to do, but let’s have that debate, 
if that is where the majority wants to 
go. But yesterday wasn’t that debate 
because it wasn’t a change of law. 
A 1983 U.S. Supreme Court decision 
made it clear that measures do not 
have the force of law unless they are 
formally presented to the President; 
and we all know that that, even if it 
were to pass the Senate, which I doubt 
highly it would, it doesn’t go to the 
President. It doesn’t change the law. 
So typically, when we have conflicts 
like this, Congress comes together be-
hind our Commander in Chief to stand 
up for America against terrorists. A lot 
of us felt that that wasn’t the case yes-
terday, it was disappointing. 
Again, the gentleman from Georgia 
made his comments apologizing for 
that comment he made, but in the 
broader context of what happened yes-
terday, it was just disappointing that, 
instead of having a sincere debate 
about whether the 2002 AUMF should 
stay in place as is or be changed, which 
is a longer negotiation; that resolution 
just took a swipe at the President and 
tried to limit his ability. I mean, lit-
erally language that says directing the 
President to do certain things is dis-
ingenuous when the resolution doesn’t 
have the effect of law. 
You can’t direct the President to do 
something. You can’t call him on the 
phone and say I direct you to do some-
thing. You could pass a law to direct 
him to do something, but that is not 
what happened yesterday, and that is 
the point and the concern. 
Again, as the gentleman knows, 
there is strong interest on both sides to 
revisit, maybe to keep it in place. But 
the 2002 AUMF has been a topic of con-
versation for a long time and will con-
tinue to be one. 
But if there is going to be a sincere 
effort to change it and a desire to 
change it, then it ought to happen 
through the proper course of legisla-
tion, and that wasn’t what happened 
yesterday. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comments. 
Simply to focus on the RECORD and to 
make clear the RECORD, the 2002 Au-
thorization for Use of Military Force to 
which the gentleman refers authorizes 
the use of force: One, to defend against 
Iraq, not Iran; and two, to enforce 
United Nations Security Council reso-
lutions regarding Iraq. 
For counsel or the administration to 
argue that the 2002 Authorization for 
Use of Military Force authorized the 
action that was taken, I think, is in-
correct. That is what they do argue. It 
hasn’t been resolved by a court, but I 
believe, and I think many on my side of 
the aisle and, frankly, I think many 
scholars 
around 
the 
country 
have 
opined, that the 2002 authorization did 
not authorize that particular act. 
Again, no one laments the loss of 
Soleimani. Everybody agrees that he 
sponsored, paid for and ordered com-
mitted acts of terrorism. And we will 
continue to believe that the Congress 
needs to speak. 
Whether or not a court would hold 
that the section that I just read with 
reference to the President would have 
to take action in the event that the 
Senate and the House adopt the con-
current resolution that we passed yes-
terday, and that is now at the Senate 
and under the War Powers Act will 
have to be considered by the Senate, 
and will be subject to a majority vote, 
not a 60-vote threshold for passage. 
I would hope that if Congress did 
that, that the President would cer-
tainly take that into consideration and 
consult with the Congress on any fur-
ther action that he might take; unless, 
of course, and as the War Powers Act 
authorizes, 
the 
President 
can 
and 
should, and the military can and 
should take any actions necessary to 
defend itself in the face of imminent 
threat and/or actual threat. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, finally, 
to talk about where we are on the im-
peachment resolution that was passed 
last year, at the end of last year by the 
House. Ultimately, it is typically an 
administrative duty to send papers 
over to the Senate if legislation passes, 
obviously 
impeachment 
managers 
would then need to be named. 
There is breaking news that the 
Speaker is announcing that she has 
asked Chairman NADLER to be prepared 
to bring impeachment managers to the 
floor next week. I am not sure if that is 
ongoing, or if that is something that 
had already been in the works. 
But does the gentleman expect that 
legislation to come to the floor next 
week? And does that mean that the pa-
pers either have been transmitted to 
the Senate or would be transmitted to 
the Senate within the next few days? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, in answer 
to the gentleman’s question, the expec-
tation is that we will have, consistent 
with the letter just sent to all of our 
Members, and instructions to Mr. NAD-
LER, or suggestions to Mr. NADLER, we 
do expect there to be legislation on the 
floor next week with reference to what 
we call supplemental legislation for 
the appointment of managers, the 
funding of the effort. And we expect 
the papers will be sent sometime soon. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, of course 
we have been seeing a chorus of Demo-
crat Senators in the recent days ex-
pressing 
concern 
that 
the 
papers 
should be sent over. Obviously, on our 
side, we felt that there was no case, 
there was no crime, and it was clear I 
think in so many areas of this. 
But ultimately, if the House passes 
legislation, any legislation, whether 
the Speaker voted for it or against it, 
it is not some power of the Speaker, ex-
clusively and dictatorially, to hold 
onto that if the Speaker doesn’t want 
to send it to the Senate. Ultimately, 
for the ability to function as a legisla-
tive body, if the House passes legisla-
tion, it goes to the Senate so that the 
Senate can take it up and do whatever 
they are going to do with it. 
But this idea that one person out of 
435 can make a decision that even if 
the House passes legislation and the 
motion to reconsider is tabled, then it 
goes to the Senate. 
Hopefully, that is resolved by next 
week and that charade ends, and we fi-
nally get true justice where it is dis-
posed of, which I think everybody ac-
knowledges that will happen once it 
goes over to the Senate. 
But let us get back to the business of 
doing the people’s work. And hopefully, 
we can then get to some of the broader 
bipartisan legislation that has been in 
the works for a long time to address 
real issues like lowering drug prices, 
like securing our border, like so many 
other things that Republicans and 
Democrats actually in the middle of all 
of this are working on together to try 
to accomplish. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
As the gentleman knows, of course, 
we have 275 bipartisan bills which have 
been sent from the House to the Senate 
involving very, very serious issues, 
dealing with the environment, dealing 
with wages, and dealing with jobs, 
dealing with making our communities 
safer, dealing with violence against 
women, dealing with equal pay for 
equal work, which was something that 
John Kennedy signed in 1963, but is, 
today, not a reality, unfortunately. So 
there are many issues I could name. 
Obviously, a lot more, because there

are 275 and we sent over 400 bills to the 
Senate and they sit untended. 
Why? Because the Senate has been 
confirming judges. 
Why? So they can put in judges that 
agree with their positions. That is the 
irony of a party that was so intent, in 
my political life, in making sure that 
judges acted only on the law. What 
philosophical imprimatur has to be 
given to judicial appointments now-
adays? And by a majority leader who 
refused a President of the United 
States who submitted a nominee, Mr. 
Garland, for 11 months. 
It is inconceivable to me that any 
Founding 
Father 
thought, 
for 
11 
months—now, it has a been a few days 
since we passed impeachment that we 
have sent those papers up. 
For 11 months, a President of the 
United States, pursuant to his con-
stitutional 
authority 
and 
responsi-
bility, sent a nominee to the United 
States Senate; 11 months before the 
election. And the majority leader said, 
tough. We are not going to consider it. 
We are not going to allow the com-
mittee to consider it. We are not going 
to allow it to be reported out to the 
floor and there is going to be no vote 
on it. 
So, yes, there has been some delay, 
because in that context and in the con-
text of the majority leader working 
hand-in-glove with the defendant, or 
the respondent, however you want to 
call it, in a civil case, criminal case, 
hand-in-glove. 
By his own admission he was not 
going to do anything that the Presi-
dent didn’t want him to do. It is like 
the prosecutor saying—or the juror 
saying, I am not going to do anything 
that the defendant doesn’t want me to 
do. 
So, yes, we have been very concerned, 
and are concerned to this day. An hon-
est trial—and that is what is the re-
sponsibility of the United States Sen-
ate. An honest trial tries to elicit from 
both sides all of the relevant evidence. 
We are concerned that it appears 
that the Senate, certainly at this junc-
ture has made no decision to receive all 
the relevant evidence. We think that is 
inconsistent with their responsibilities 
under the Senate rules and to the 
American people. We lament that fact 
and we have been trying to get from 
the Senate what are the rules? 
Mr. Speaker, the other side talked a 
lot about process, about how they 
needed to have this avenue, that ave-
nue, and the other. That is all we were 
asking because this is the trial, not the 
time when you have, essentially, a 
grand jury deciding whether or not 
there is probable cause that the Presi-
dent of the United States has abused 
his power. 
b 1200 
That is especially what our role is, as 
an analogy to a criminal case. But 
there was no expression from the Sen-
ate that a normal process to determine 
the truth of the allegation was going to 
be pursued in the United States Sen-
ate. 
The Speaker simply wanted to have 
that assurance. We have not gotten it. 
The American people have not gotten 
it. 
What has happened since we passed 
that resolution? A number of people 
have come forward. Mr. Bolton, in par-
ticular, said that he will testify. Other 
people have been identified as having 
relevant, pertinent, firsthand knowl-
edge, not hearsay, firsthand knowledge 
of the allegations that are included in 
the Articles of Impeachment I and II. 
I am hopeful that, in fact, the Sen-
ate, both Republicans and Democrats, 
will come to an agreement that all the 
fact witnesses will raise their hand to 
tell the whole truth and nothing but 
the truth. 
The Senate is going to raise their 
hand under Senate rules and say they 
swear to be impartial in consideration 
of the evidence, yet they will not allow 
the evidence, apparently, at this point 
in time at least, to be elucidated. I am 
hopeful that changes. 
I expect, as I said earlier, Mr. Speak-
er, to the Republican whip, that those 
papers will be transferred in the near 
term. I don’t know specifically when 
but in the near term to the Senate. 
I am hopeful the American people 
will get what they deserve from the 
United States Senate serving as essen-
tially jurors and will be sworn in as 
such by the Chief Justice, not by the 
Vice President presiding over the Sen-
ate but the Chief Justice presiding over 
a quasi-legal, quasi-political process. 
I will tell my friend that a letter has 
been sent. I do expect legislation to be 
considered next week, which is nec-
essary to proceed with the process. I 
hope the process proceeds, Mr. Speak-
er, in a judicial, fair way that allows 
all the evidence on both sides, from the 
President’s side and the House’s side, 
which will carry the argument justi-
fying the Articles of Impeachment and 
the finding of fact that those articles 
are, in fact, worthy of having the 
President of the United States removed 
for abuse of power. 
That is the issue. It ought to be ar-
gued fairly on both sides, and the evi-
dence ought to be adduced on both 
sides. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, it is in-
teresting that the gentleman talks 
about fairness in the trial. It is quite 
rich of the Speaker to call for fairness 
in the Senate when she denied fairness 
in the House. 
You can look at House rules that re-
quire the minority gets a day of hear-
ings on impeachment, and that rule 
was thrown out the window. 
The gentleman said an honest trial 
tries to elicit all the evidence. Of 
course, we had multiple witnesses we 
wanted to bring forward that were de-
nied. Clearly, all the evidence didn’t 
get out. 
I guess, by definition, it was not an 
honest trial in the House. I am con-
fident they will have an honest and fair 
trial in the Senate. In fact, there are 
negotiations to make sure it will be 
fair. 
By the way, I want to make this 
point because when the impeachment 
proceedings were moving forward with 
President Nixon, it was a Democratic 
Congress that negotiated with the 
Nixon administration, with the Nixon 
White House, to determine a fair set of 
rules, and the House adopted those 
rules. That was a Democratic con-
ference. 
Then, fast forward to the Clinton im-
peachment where you had a Demo-
cratic President and a Republican 
House. The House negotiated with the 
White House to come up with fair 
rules. Ultimately, they adopted the 
Nixon 
standard 
because 
everybody 
agreed that was a fair process. 
Whether or not you like the outcome 
is one thing, but it was a fair process. 
That never happened here. This House 
didn’t make an effort to try to nego-
tiate a fair set of rules with us in the 
minority or with the White House. 
Again, House rules actually require a 
minority day of hearings, and that was 
broken and not allowed. We didn’t get 
that minority day of hearings. We re-
quested it multiple times to try to get 
some fairness to elicit facts from all 
sides, but we weren’t given that oppor-
tunity. 
The Senate now has a case that was 
sent over to them. By a lot of esti-
mates, it is an inadequate case, and it 
is a weak case. I think the majority 
must acknowledge that, which is why 
they are holding the papers and hoping 
for more things, which is what this was 
all about anyway. 
It seems like every week we would 
hear more rumors that, next week, the 
big witness is going to come out and 
everything is going to be exposed, and 
then that witness would testify under 
oath that, no, they didn’t see a crime. 
But don’t worry, next week, there is 
going to be another one. 
This will go on forever. It is like a 
Groundhog Day of impeachment. At 
some point, I would hope the majority 
says enough is enough, that they will 
actually let the people of this country 
decide, which they will. It is going to 
be the people of the country that de-
cide the President at the end of this 
year in the election. 
This President, obviously, has a very 
strong case to make with what he has 
done to get this economy back on 
track, to rebuild this military, to pro-
tect America, to secure our border, and 
all the other things that he will have a 
case to make to the people. 
Of course, the gentleman is going to 
have a nominee who is going to make 
their case, however far left that case 
will be. We will see through the pri-
maries. But the people will, ulti-
mately, make that decision. 
Our job should be to focus on doing 
the work of the American people, and 
hopefully, that happens. The Senate is 
going to have their opportunity. I am 
confident they are going to have a fair

January 10, 2020 
trial. I wish that would have been the 
case here in the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
First of all, the Constitution does not 
provide for a trial in the House of Rep-
resentatives, period. 
However, Mr. Speaker, the minority 
continues to make the analogy of what 
is done in the House: impeachment, 
analogous to an indictment, making a 
charge and determining that there is 
probable cause. 
Secondly, in the Nixon administra-
tion, there was a Democratic Congress, 
and there was discussion back and 
forth. Guess what? The President’s wit-
nesses came forward. 
What happened in this case? The 
President said nobody can testify to 
the Congress. I believe that was ob-
struction of justice, but that is for the 
Senate to decide—certainly, obstruc-
tion of the Congress. 
In the Clinton administration, the 
same thing happened. Witnesses came 
forward, including, I believe, the Chief 
of Staff of the White House. So it was 
a very different situation. 
In addition, in both the Nixon and 
Clinton administrations, the minority 
shoves aside the fact that there were 
special prosecutors that had deposi-
tions of all the witnesses and were 
available in the United States Senate 
at the time of the trial. So the Senate 
had full information. 
Thirdly, the gentleman does not ei-
ther remember or assert, Mr. Speaker, 
that the Judiciary Committee said to 
the White House counsel that you can 
participate. There is time for you to 
come down. There is time for you to 
call witnesses. There is time for you to 
make your case. Mr. Cipollone, the 
White House counsel, notified the com-
mittee they were not interested. Why 
were they not interested? Because, in 
my opinion, their expectation is they 
were going to go to the Senate and 
have the case dismissed without any 
evidence being adduced. 
Mr. Speaker, I think that is unfortu-
nate, but those are the facts. That is 
what happened. If you make a further 
analogy of the grand jury, the defend-
ant plays no role in the grand jury, 
none, zero, zip, no counsel, no wit-
nesses in the room. The jury decides if 
there is probable cause to believe that 
X committed an offense worthy of 
going forward. That is what happens. 
There is no participation. 
There was participation here. The 
President had opportunities here. All 
the Republicans participated and could 
cross-examine the witnesses that did, 
in fact, come forward in the Judiciary 
Committee, 
Oversight 
and 
Reform 
Committee, Intel Committee, Foreign 
Affairs Committee, and Financial Serv-
ices Committee. 
I would hope that would happen in 
the Senate. If you want to know the 
truth, Mr. Speaker, that is what ought 
to happen. 
If it is just presenting information 
that is not relevant in this trial, i.e., ‘‘I 
did a good job on the economy. I did a 
good job on foreign policy. I did a good 
job on protecting our borders.’’ That is 
the President’s argument in a political 
sense. I understand that. But that is 
not legally relevant information as to 
whether or not he abused his power in 
particular in the phone call with the 
Ukrainians 
in 
which 
he 
withheld 
money appropriated by the Congress of 
the United States to help protect an 
ally, Ukraine, against incursion by Mr. 
Putin. I am sure Mr. Putin was very 
pleased that that money did not go to 
President Zelensky and the Ukrainian 
forces. 
We think that was an abuse of power. 
My friend the Republican whip thinks 
it was not. I get that. That is what 
makes the world go around, differences 
of opinion. 
It is now in the Senate. That is where 
a trial is provided for in the Congress. 
That is where witnesses should be pro-
vided. That is where both sides ought 
to be able to make their arguments be-
fore the jury, the United States Sen-
ate. Then and only then should the 
United States Senate make a deter-
mination whether or not the allega-
tions had merit and warrant the con-
sequences. 
I tell my friend, when you make 
these analogies of what happened here 
in the House, it is done. The whip may 
think it is bad, Mr. Speaker. The whip 
may think it wasn’t done correctly. 
But the proof in the pudding will be: Is 
he urging the Senate to do what every-
body in America thinks of as a trial? 
That is what the Senate under the Con-
stitution is: the trier of the facts and 
law, presided over by the Chief Justice 
of the Supreme Court of the United 
States. 
I would hope the gentleman would be 
urging as strenuously in the Senate, 
where trial and proper procedures 
should be followed, as they did here in 
the House. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, clearly, 
as the gentleman knows, it is the Sen-
ate’s job to try the House’s case. If the 
House failed to make its case, that is 
the House’s fault. To suggest that the 
Senate needs to mop up the mess that 
was done here because there was not 
fairness, because both sides didn’t get 
the opportunity, if one side wants to 
say, ‘‘I have a case to make. I am going 
make my case, but I am not going to 
let them make theirs, and I am not 
going to let them call their witnesses,’’ 
and we had a long list of witnesses we 
wanted to call that we were denied. 
You are in the majority. You get to 
make the rules. If that is what you 
want to call fair, you can, but it is not. 
The Senate has it, but it was all done 
according to the majority out of ur-
gency. That is the word we heard over 
and over again. If the gentleman want-
ed to have other people come to testify, 
the President and every President ex-
erts executive privilege, so if the 
standard is a President exerting execu-
tive privilege equates to obstruction of 
Congress, then you would have to 
retroactively go back and impeach 
every 
President, 
including 
George 
Washington. 
Exerting executive privilege is not an 
obstruction of Congress. Congress can 
have a disagreement with the Presi-
dent. We have surely had disagree-
ments with previous Presidents exert-
ing executive privilege when we were 
in the majority. You fight those out in 
the courts. The gentleman is well 
aware of that. Maybe the courts will 
say yes, and maybe the courts will say 
no, but that attempt wasn’t made. 
Why? Because according to your own 
leader, 
Speaker 
PELOSI, 
‘‘urgent’’; 
Chairman SCHIFF, ‘‘The timing is driv-
en by the urgency’’; Chairman NADLER, 
‘‘The threat is urgent.’’ They rammed 
it through, and other facts and other 
witnesses that they didn’t want, they 
discarded. 
The actual rule of the House, clause 
2(j)(1) of rule XI requires—not allows 
but requires—the minority to have a 
day of hearing. That was denied be-
cause there was urgency. They didn’t 
want all the facts to get out. They 
were concerned about urgency. 
Lo and behold, it passes, and all of a 
sudden, what happened to the urgency? 
The Speaker says we are going to hold 
the papers. You had Democratic Sen-
ators: I think it is time to send the im-
peachment to the Senate. Let MITCH 
MCCONNELL be responsible for the fair-
ness of the trial. He ultimately is. 
Other Senators said very similar 
things. At some point in time, if it was 
urgent and then it happened, and then 
you don’t send it over because now all 
of a sudden you realize it is a weak 
case and you are hoping something else 
pops up, you are hoping maybe the 
Senate can do the things that weren’t 
done here because it was an urgency, it 
was expediency, appeasing a political 
base. 
b 1215 
There was no crime. Every other im-
peachment started with a crime, not 
the hope of a crime. You can listen to 
a phone call and suggest something. 
Interestingly, I never saw any at-
tempt to impeach President Obama be-
cause he didn’t give that aid to 
Ukraine. If the aid was so important 
that it was impeachable not to give it, 
Obama didn’t give it. We didn’t try to 
impeach him. It was bad foreign policy 
that he didn’t provide Javelin missiles 
to Ukraine. It wasn’t impeachable. 
But President Trump did give the 
aid, President Trump did sell the Jav-
elin missiles to help Ukraine stand up 
to Putin. 
President Obama didn’t help Ukraine 
stand up to Putin. If that is who you 
are most concerned about, then maybe 
the impeachment would have been in 
the other direction. 
But, again, that was bad foreign pol-
icy that President Obama didn’t give 
Ukraine the tools that they asked for 
and were denied by the Obama adminis-
tration, but it wasn’t impeachable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H170 
January 10, 2020 
Here you might have a disagreement 
with President Trump’s foreign policy. 
You might have a disagreement that he 
did sell the Javelin missiles, maybe 
you agreed with it. But ultimately the 
President did send that aid. There was 
no investigation and he sent the aid. 
But impeach him for it anyway because 
you disagree with other things. I think 
that became very clear. 
At some point, if it is focused on per-
sonality, I think that is what people 
are most fed up with. 
If there were facts, then both sides 
would have been able to present all of 
the evidence, both sides would have 
been able to call all of the witnesses. 
If the majority had confidence in 
their case, they would have said, Okay. 
You can call your witnesses, because 
our witnesses are better. We have high-
er confidence in our case. But that 
didn’t happen. 
We were denied what the rules of the 
House requires: a minority day of hear-
ing. We wanted it, we asked for it, the 
rules 
required 
it, 
but 
they 
blew 
through it, they threw that away. 
That is not fairness. But the Senate 
will conduct a fair trial based on a 
weak case. If the case was stronger, re-
gardless, the Senate’s job is to try the 
case that was made in the House, 
whether it was a strong or a weak case, 
and that ought to happen. Justice is 
being denied every day it is not. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
tleman, I don’t know what analogy he 
is using to process, but what he just 
said would effectively say, if the wit-
nesses weren’t called and presented in 
the grand jury, then the defense attor-
ney can’t call them, then the pros-
ecutor can’t call them. 
That is absolutely untrue. I could use 
a harsher word of how lacking in sub-
stance I think that representation is. 
The Senate is now trying the case. 
The grand jury has sent the case over 
there strong enough to have a signifi-
cant majority of the House vote for it, 
by the way, in a partisan sense, not a 
single Republican. Well, there was a 
single Republican. As a matter of fact, 
there are three or four who have talked 
to me privately—I will not mention 
their names—but they didn’t vote, as 
they talked to me. 
But the fact of the matter is, what 
the gentleman’s proposition is is that 
if you didn’t call the witnesses in the 
House, then you can’t call them in the 
Senate. 
Now, the reason for that is because 
they don’t want the witnesses called, 
which is why the President told them, 
Don’t testify in the House. 
They were asked to testify. And what 
happened when we asked them to tes-
tify? No, you have to have a subpoena. 
What happened when we had sub-
poenas when we talked to Mr. McGahn? 
He went to court. And when he lost, he 
appealed, and they were going to ap-
peal to the Supreme Court. That takes 
forever. 
The fact of the matter is there was 
certainly, from our perspective, over-
whelming evidence, not that he with-
held money, but the reason he withheld 
money. 
Obviously in the cases cited by the 
minority whip, Congress had not appro-
priated and directed that money to be 
sent to Ukraine. And, in fact, President 
Obama gave significant aid. He didn’t 
give them missiles, but he gave signifi-
cant aid and assistance to the Ukrain-
ians. But the fact of the matter is, we 
didn’t direct him to send the money. 
We directed this President to send 
the money. Why? As we have done be-
fore on Russian sanctions very early on 
with Mr. MCCARTHY and I cosponsoring 
legislation which directed the Presi-
dent to impose the sanctions on Russia 
because we weren’t confident that he 
would do so on his own. 
But the analogy that the gentleman 
continues to make as a rationalization 
for why the Senate does not appear to 
be going to have a fair, open trial-like, 
as the Constitution requires, with 
swearing to be impartial, meaning they 
want to get at the facts and make a 
judgment on the facts, he has not, Mr. 
Speaker, explained why he is not rec-
ommending the same fairness that he 
wanted to have here. 
He wasn’t in charge. He says he 
didn’t get it. I get that. But they are in 
charge over there. And I would urge 
the minority whip to urge the majority 
leader to have a trial as we would ex-
pect to have a trial if either of us were 
under indictment. We would expect to 
be able to call witnesses, and we would 
understand that the prosecution would 
call such witnesses as they believe nec-
essary and are relevant to the case. 
That is a very important phrase I 
want to emphasize, ‘‘relevant to the 
case,’’ because so many of the wit-
nesses, like the whistleblower, who is 
protected by our laws that we have 
passed from being exposed to adverse 
actions, and the President says, Bring 
us the whistleblower. The Republicans 
say, Bring us the whistleblower. The 
whistleblower doesn’t have any knowl-
edge to testify on. They are correct: it 
was hearsay. 
He heard from somebody that the 
guy down the street committed a 
crime. I didn’t see it. He told me. So 
what do I do? I call up the police and 
say, Joe Doe told me a crime is being 
committed down the street. You better 
go see. 
So I emphasize, Mr. Speaker, hope-
fully in closing, that we have passed— 
Republicans all voted ‘‘no,’’ I get that. 
But the House of Representatives be-
lieved by a majority vote that we had 
made a case for probable cause. And 
under those circumstances, the Con-
stitution says the Senate will then try 
that case to determine whether or not, 
in fact, the probable cause was accu-
rate. 
All we are asking is that it be done in 
a fair, open, and complete manner. Be-
cause there was no Special Prosecutor, 
there was no way to compel some of 
those witnesses who refused to come 
testify, who now, John Bolton being 
the specific example, are saying, Yes, I 
will testify. 
Personally, I don’t believe that the 
Senate majority leader wants John 
Bolton to testify, but he clearly has 
firsthand knowledge, not the whistle-
blower, not somebody told me, but 
firsthand knowledge. By the way, when 
he heard about it, apparently he called 
it a drug deal. 
So I hope, Mr. Speaker, that the whip 
will urge the Senate to do what he 
wanted done here, or perhaps take the 
position, they are wrong means we can 
be wrong. Maybe two wrongs will make 
a right. That is not the way we usually 
think of it, but I am hopeful that not 
only will the minority whip, the Re-
publican whip do that, I hope the mi-
nority leader will do that. It would be 
good for the country. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, if the 
gentleman wants to talk about how the 
process works, I have made it clear. 
The gentleman is in the majority. They 
get to make the rules however they 
want. 
But to say, as the gentleman said 
earlier, an honest trial tries to elicit 
all of the evidence, no one can make 
the argument that all of the evidence 
was presented. 
Again, we called and asked for mul-
tiple witnesses and were denied. We 
were denied the ability to have the wit-
nesses we asked for. 
Now, they are in the majority. They 
said no, and they were able to roll over 
that because they had the votes. But 
don’t say it was fair. Don’t say it was 
an honest trial, when by their own defi-
nition, all of the facts in evidence have 
to come out. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, will the 
gentleman yield for just one second so 
I can clarify? 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we did not 
have a trial. The Constitution does not 
require a trial. We are not the trial 
forum. The Senate is the trial forum. 
Certainly the gentleman has watched 
enough television trials, maybe been in 
trials for all I know, I am a lawyer, so 
obviously I have been in trials. That is 
the place where you call witnesses. 
That is where the defendant has the 
right. 
He has no right in the grand jury to 
call witnesses. He has no right in the 
grand jury to be there. He has no right 
to have his lawyer in the grand jury 
room. 
Now, we afforded the President of the 
United States that right, and he re-
jected it. His lawyer sent a letter to 
Mr. NADLER and said, Thank you, but 
no thanks. We are not going to play. 
So, Mr. Speaker, in my view, the mi-
nority leader, minority whip continues 
to conflate the responsibility we had 
here in the House and the responsi-
bility the Senate has. 
The Senate is the trier of facts, not 
the House. The House is the deter-
minant of whether there is probable

cause, and we did that and it is over in 
the Senate, and it is their responsi-
bility and duty. 
They lift their hands to swear they 
will be impartial, to get all the rel-
evant evidence—relevant evidence, rel-
evant evidence—not just some fishing 
expedition on either side, the prosecu-
tion or defense. 
And with that, I hope we can end this 
debate, because it will be endless if we 
do not, simply because we are not 
going to agree, Mr. Speaker. 
We have, obviously, very different 
perceptions as to what the duty of the 
House was and very different percep-
tions that if we thought what we did in 
the House was wrong, we ought to re-
peat it in the Senate. 
I think the papers will be going to 
the Senate. The Senate will decide 
what it is going to do. I hope the Sen-
ators 
comport 
themselves 
as 
the 
Founders and the people would expect. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, let’s be 
clear. Probable cause is not the stand-
ard in the Constitution. 
To remove a sitting President, the 
Constitution is very specific: treason, 
bribery, or other high crimes and mis-
demeanors, not probable cause. That 
would be in the Constitution if that is 
what the Framers intended for im-
peachment to be used for, but that is 
not what impeachment is to be used 
for. 
There were witnesses called, multiple 
witnesses. 
There were tryouts, by the way, in 
secret that Chairman SCHIFF had prior 
to asking the President at the last 
minute, after all of this innuendo and 
you would hear leaks and leaks and 
this is going to happen, and then they 
would have a secret hearing where wit-
nesses were sworn in, but none of us 
could find out what was happening in 
those secret hearings. 
And as we talked to Members that 
were there, all of the leaks and innu-
endos turned out to be disproven. We 
couldn’t find that out, because the 
chairman closed those hearings to the 
public, closed those hearings to most 
Members of Congress. 
But ultimately the Senate’s job is to 
try the case that was made in the 
House, weak or strong. And clearly it 
was weak, because the urgency that 
was talked about, it would already be 
going on if it was a strong case. But 
even if it is a weak case, it is not the 
Senate’s job to mop up that mess. 
It is the Senate’s job to go and hear 
the case that was made in the House 
with one side presenting their wit-
nesses. 
And, again, the majority got to have 
that opportunity. We didn’t have the 
opportunity to present witnesses we 
wanted to bring forward. And there 
were witnesses. They were sworn in. I 
don’t know if you would call them 
something different, but that is what 
they were. They were there to present 
facts. 
Many gave innuendo, but when asked 
under oath, Can you name the crime? 
No. 
Was there bribery? 
No. 
But let the Senate do their job, and 
hopefully they get that next week. I 
would encourage that the House get 
that done next week. It should have 
been done a while back. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
if he has anything else. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
nothing else at this time. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time.

CONGRATULATING 
NATHAN 
KIRSCH, 
MILKEN 
EDUCATOR 
AWARD WINNER 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
congratulate 
Whitehaven 
High School math teacher Nathan 
Kirsch. He won the Milken Educator 
Award. This award is given to only 40 
early- and mid-career teachers across 
the United States, and there was only 
one in Tennessee who won it. 
Mr. Kirsch was surprised with the 
award at a school assembly Wednesday 
morning, where the entire student 
body applauded him for being the only 
teacher in Tennessee to receive the na-
tional distinction, which some have 
called the Oscar award for teaching. It 
could be the Nobel Prize for teaching. 
In accepting the award, Mr. Kirsch 
called it one ‘‘for all of my students,’’ 
past, current, and future. 
The Whitehaven High School commu-
nity is rightly proud of this accom-
plishment, and I am, too. 
It is very encouraging that a pro-
gram known for being an athletic pow-
erhouse is also recognized for its excel-
lence in academics. The principal at 
Whitehaven, Vincent Hunter, posts the 
names of the scholars, the ones who 
have gotten the best scores and the 
most scholarship offers, on the wall 
outside 
of 
his 
office—not 
athletic 
awards, of which there are a plethora, 
but academic awards. 
Mr. Kirsch embodies both traditions 
that Whitehaven has—as a coach of 
teams and a great teacher who has 
raised their calculus scores. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. 
Kirsch and all the Whitehaven Tigers 
on this exceptional achievement.

RECOGNIZING DR. MARTHA 
HUGHES CANNON 
(Mr. CURTIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, my family 
tree on both sides is full of prominent 
women who served in elected office. 
The most notable of these is my wife’s 
great-grandmother, Dr. Martha Hughes 
Cannon, a pioneer in both government 
and heritage. 
123 years ago, she was sworn into the 
Utah State Senate, becoming the first 
woman in the country to hold that of-
fice. My wife is quick to remind me 
that she won that office by defeating 
her husband. 
Utah is home to some of the most ca-
pable and influential female leaders in 
the Nation, and I am fortunate to have 
these impressive women help advise me 
on all issues, and specifically those 
that impact Utah women. 
Because of the initiative of Martha 
Hughes Cannon, thousands of women 
have followed in her footsteps and 
served in State legislatures and as 
local and national leaders. 
I am excited and proud to introduce a 
resolution dedicating January 11, 2020, 
as National Martha Hughes Cannon 
Day and honor the path that she paved 
for the many women who serve today.

SWEEPING ACTION TO ADDRESS 
PFAS CONTAMINATION 
(Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, today the House took sweep-
ing bipartisan action to address PFAS 
contamination that has proliferated 
across communities in America. These 
forever chemicals have been linked to 
negative health effects, including can-
cer, impaired child development, and 
even infertility. 
Granite Staters have already seen 
the harmful consequences of PFAS 
contamination, and I am pleased that 
the legislation we passed today will 
safeguard communities, clean up con-
taminated sites, and protect public 
health. 
Importantly, the bipartisan bill we 
passed today includes language I au-
thored to turn off the tap for new 
PFAS chemicals being approved by the 
EPA. Enough is enough. There are al-
ready 
too 
many 
dangerous 
PFAS 
chemicals in our environment, and the 
last thing Americans need is more of 
these forever chemicals. 
The PFAS Action Act also included a 
bipartisan amendment offered by my 
good 
friend 
and 
colleague 
CHRIS 
PAPPAS and myself, which would au-
thorize significant grant funding to 
public water treatment facilities to 
safeguard our drinking water. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the Senate to 
take up this important bill.

H172 
January 10, 2020 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize an extraordinary three- 
war veteran, Lieutenant Colonel Daniel 
Daube. 
Colonel Daube is a highly decorated 
veteran, having served in World War II, 
Korea, and Vietnam, amassing over 
5,000 flight-hours between the Navy and 
the Air Force. He flew the P–51 Mus-
tang, multiple fighter jets, and heavy 
metal. He even served in the space pro-
gram. His name is enshrined on the 
Wall of Honor in the Smithsonian Air 
and Space Museum. 
Colonel Daube’s record of service is 
emblematic of why we all revere the 
Greatest Generation. Now, at 95 years 
old, he is still the cheerful warrior. He 
lives in Callaway, Florida, near his son, 
Dr. Skip Daube, who has been my 
friend for over 25 years. 
I was honored to serve them both 
Thanksgiving dinner at Tyndall Air 
Force Base this year, and it was a time 
of great comradery. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in salut-
ing a living hero from our father’s gen-
eration, Colonel Daniel Daube.

HONORING THE DONUT DOLLIES 
OF THE VIETNAM CONFLICT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. FLORES) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 627 brave civilian 
women who served as Donut Dollies for 
the Red Cross’ Supplemental Rec-
reational Activities Overseas Program 
during the Vietnam conflict between 
1965 and 1972. 
The name Donut Dollies was coined 
during World War II to describe the 
Red Cross volunteers who passed out 
hot coffee and donuts from the backs of 
military vehicles. While the women 
who volunteered in Vietnam did so 
much more than hand out donuts and 
coffee, the name Donuts Dollies was 
applied to them. 
The young women of the Donut Dol-
lies were stationed throughout Viet-
nam, from Saigon up to Quang Tri. 
They lived in tents and abandoned vil-
las. They endured incoming fire, and 
they flew over enemy territory just 
like our military personnel. 
These brave women quickly became 
to be known as angels in a combat zone 
for their bright smiles and powder blue 
uniforms that lifted the spirits at 
every base they toured. 
The Donut Dollies hosted daily rec-
reational events at large bases, such as 
pool tournaments, fashion shows, and 
various contests to provide fun and re-
laxation for off-duty military per-
sonnel. They helped serve food in chow 
lines, and they brought Kool-Aid to the 
night sentries working in perimeter 
towers. 
Others 
were 
assigned 
to 
the 
Clubmobile 
program, 
which 
toured 
more remote bases, often requiring hel-
icopter transport to reach them. They 
would gather the troops, usually beside 
a bunker or tank, to play competitive 
audience participation games. 
For the hour or so that they were 
there, 
the 
Donut 
Dollies 
brought 
laughter 
and 
a 
sense 
of 
lightheartedness 
that 
was 
deeply 
missed in the war zone. Because death 
was so close, the laughter was healing, 
funny things were funnier, and their 
laughter helped join everyone together. 
One soldier once said it was the mir-
acle of making the war disappear for a 
little while. 
The approximately 1,500 visits of the 
Clubmobile program logged over 2.1 
million air miles. Their primary goal 
on these visits and at the events at 
larger bases was to boost morale and to 
provide the men with a sense of home 
before going out in the field. 
Mr. Speaker, the contributions of the 
Donut Dollies represented a changing 
role of women to serve their country at 
a time when women had previously 
been limited to noncombat roles. Their 
patriotism helped bring warmth, light, 
and laughter to the darkness of war-
time. 
My wife, Gina, and I are honored to 
recognize the women of the Donut Dol-
lies and to thank them for their impor-
tant and sacrificial contributions that 
they made for our country during the 
Vietnam conflict. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country, 
for our military men and women who 
protect us, and for our first responders 
who keep us safe at home. 
HONORING CHRIS AND PEGGY OSBORNE OF 
BRYAN-COLLEGE STATION, TEXAS 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the 33 years of 
service and ministry of Chris and 
Peggy 
Osborne to Central Baptist 
Church and to the community of 
Bryan-College Station, Texas. 
Central Baptist Church was founded 
in 1925 as a mission-minded ministry 
dedicated to sharing a passion for 
God’s Word. Today, Central Baptist 
Church has become an integral part of 
the Bryan-College Station community, 
where a strong sense of discipleship has 
led to the creation of many outreach 
programs, children’s ministry events, 
and college ministry groups. 
Even as the church has grown, Cen-
tral Baptist Church remains com-
mitted to their original mission-mind-
ed goals, and through the efforts of the 
congregation, thousands of people have 
found the joy, peace, and contentment 
that spring from a fulfilling and per-
sonal relationship with Jesus Christ. 
For the past 33 years, Pastor Chris 
and his wife, Peggy, have been a source 
of light and encouragement and joy for 
the entire Central Baptist Church com-
munity. Under the leadership of Pastor 
Chris, Central has seen significant 
change and growth. The relocation of 
its church to its current 3,500-seat wor-
ship center and the more recent addi-
tion to the children’s wing have pro-
vided members of the Central Baptist 
family with ever-increasing opportuni-
ties for worship and community. 
Chris’s commitment to outreach and 
involvement have made him a pillar of 
the Bryan-College Station community, 
serving as chaplain for the police de-
partment, hosting cook-offs and baking 
competitions, 
and 
participating 
in 
charity golf tournaments. 
Pastor Chris’ dedication to service 
has not gone unnoticed, and hundreds 
of members of his congregation have 
experienced life change from his en-
couraging and supportive approach. 
On January 26, 2020, Central Baptist 
Church will say good-bye to Pastor 
Chris and to his wife, Peggy, as they 
begin the next chapter of their lives in 
Fort Worth, Texas, where Chris will 
continue to spread the Word of God as 
a professor at Southwestern Baptist 
Theological Seminary. 
As members of the Central Baptist 
Church congregation, my wife, Gina, 
and I have both grown in Christ be-
cause of the impact of the church 
under the leadership and friendship of 
Chris and Peggy. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to recog-
nize and thank both Chris and Peggy 
for their down-to-earth and positive 
leadership of this congregation and for 
their impact of spreading the good 
news of Jesus Christ. 
I have requested that a United States 
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol 
to honor the lives and legacies of Chris 
and Peggy Osborne. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country, 
for our military men and women who 
protect us, and for our first responders 
who keep us safe at home. 
RECOGNIZING THE 140TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
ASSOCIATION OF FORMER STUDENTS OF TEXAS 
A&M UNIVERSITY 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the recent 140th an-
niversary of The Association of Former 
Students of Texas A&M University. 
The Agricultural and Mechanical 
College of Texas, now known as Texas 
A&M University, was founded as a 
land-grant college by the State of 
Texas in 1871, pursuant to the Morrill 
Act. The college was the first public in-
stitution of higher education in Texas 
and started classes on October 4, 1876. 
On June 26, 1879, with the Agricul-
tural and Mechanical College of Texas 
still in its infancy, 11 former cadets 
hosted a reception in Houston, initi-
ating the first formal organization of 
A&M former students. The persons at 
that meeting included: 
William Sleeper, class of 1879; 
William Trenckmann, class of 1878; 
Pinckey Downs, class of 1879; 
Edward Fitzhugh, class of 1879; 
Edward Cushing, class of 1880; 
George Hardy, class of 1879; 
David Alexander, class of 1879; 
William Small, class of 1882; 
Robert Chatham, class of 1877; 
William Brown, class of 1882; and 
Thomas Fuller, class of 1881. 
It was decided at that first meeting

former cadets who attended the A&M 
College of Texas, thus promoting and 
maintaining fellowship. The Ex-Cadets 
Association was reorganized to form 
the Alumni Association in 1888. 
Developing throughout the years in 
tandem with the Alpha Phi Fraternity, 
which was founded in the 1890s and in-
cluded former students who had not 
graduated, a coalition was formed in 
1919 to formally reorganize and adopt 
the name The Association of Former 
Students. 
This name was written into the char-
ter granted by the State of Texas in 
1925. In this charter, the association 
committed to ‘‘support of benevolent, 
charitable, 
and 
educational 
under-
takings by extending financial and 
other aid to students at Texas A&M; by 
promoting social, literary, and sci-
entific pursuits; by perpetuating and 
strengthening the ties of affection and 
esteem formed in university or college 
days; by promoting the interests and 
welfare of Texas A&M University and 
education generally in the State of 
Texas.’’ 
Since its first day of class over 143 
years ago, with six professors and 40 
students, the university has grown to 
become one of the largest Tier 1 re-
search and education institutions in 
the United States, with almost 70,000 
students, thousands of faculty and 
staff, and close to a billion dollars of 
annual research activity. 
b 1245 
Through its existence, the Associa-
tion of Former Students has continued 
to grow rapidly. Today it serves more 
than 508,000 former students of Texas 
A&M University and generates an im-
pact of almost $14 million annually for 
university support through scholar-
ships, student activities, and long-re-
vered traditions, such as the Aggie 
Ring Program. 
As the university has grown and de-
veloped, the Aggie Network—as the or-
ganization is commonly referred to 
today—has evolved but has always 
maintained its core values and com-
mitments to the university, its current 
students and its former students. To-
gether, the association and the univer-
sity collaborate to maintain six core 
values of: loyalty, integrity, excel-
lence, leadership, selfless service, and 
respect. These are the core values that 
unite all Texas A&M students and by 
which all Aggies strive to live. 
As former chairman of the board of 
the Association of Former Students 
during 2007, I am honored and humbled 
to be able to recognize the accomplish-
ments of the organization over the past 
140 years. The Aggie Network is truly 
the glue that unites our current stu-
dents, former students, and our respon-
sibilities to live our core values every 
day. 
Mr. Speaker, in recognition of the re-
cent 140th anniversary of the Associa-
tion of Former Students of Texas A&M 
University, I applaud the organiza-
tion’s ongoing commitment to all 
Texas Aggies and to the core values of 
our beloved institution. 
I have requested that the United 
States flag be flown over our Nation’s 
Capitol to honor the 140 years of legacy 
and the impact of the worldwide Aggie 
Network. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue to pray for our country, for 
our military men and women who keep 
us safe, and for our first responders 
who protect us at home. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

REFLECTIONS ON THE WAR 
POWERS DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) is recognized 
for the remainder of the hour as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
throughout the debate yesterday on 
the so-called War Powers Resolution, 
fundamental misunderstandings sur-
faced that I think need to be addressed. 
The first misunderstanding is that 
the justification for the attack that 
killed Soleimani was that he was an 
evil terrorist responsible for the deaths 
of hundreds of Americans. Well, there 
are a lot of evil terrorists out there, 
and that does not give the President 
authority to launch attacks on foreign 
countries to kill them. 
But what did give the President au-
thority in this case, was the fact that 
Soleimani was acting as an armed com-
batant against U.S. forces in a war 
zone in which the Congress had author-
ized the President to take military ac-
tion through the Authorization for the 
Use of Military Force in Iraq in 2002. 
Now, I hate to shock my woke col-
leagues, but killing active enemy com-
batants is what war is all about, and it 
is a war that Congress started with 
that act. 
That act of Congress provides: ‘‘The 
President is authorized to use the 
Armed Forces of the United States as 
he determines to be necessary and ap-
propriate in order to defend the na-
tional security of the United States 
against the continuing threat posed by 
Iraq.’’ 
The very nature of this authority in-
cludes combating hostile militia and 
armed 
proxies 
acting 
within 
Iraq 
against American forces. That is ex-
actly what the President did. 
The authorization to use military 
force did not end with the defeat of 
Saddam Hussein any more than the 
President’s 
military 
authority 
in 
Japan and Germany ended with the de-
feat of Hirohito and Hitler. 
In those cases, the President’s au-
thority didn’t terminate until 1952 and 
1955, respectively, and the President’s 
military authority in Iraq remains in 
effect until the President and Congress 
terminate it. 
Now, the second misunderstanding is 
that the President’s action was an at-
tack on Iran. It most certainly was 
not. It was carried out in the theater of 
war defined by Congress against a com-
batant who was commanding hostile 
forces against American troops. 
Not only did the President act en-
tirely within his legal authority as 
Commander in Chief, but within his 
moral responsibility to protect Amer-
ican military and diplomatic personnel 
and American citizens in Iraq. 
The third misunderstanding is that 
the War Powers Act is applicable in 
this circumstance. The War Powers Act 
governs only those circumstances when 
the President responds without con-
gressional authority to an attack upon 
the United States, its territory or pos-
sessions, or its Armed Forces. In this 
case, the President already had con-
gressional authority. 
The fourth misunderstanding is that 
the attack on Soleimani was equiva-
lent to President Obama’s attack on 
Libya. The two are entirely different 
matters. The attack on Libya had no 
congressional authorization and the 
War Powers Act did not apply because 
Mr. Obama’s military attack was not 
in response to an attack on the United 
States, its territory or possessions, or 
its Armed Forces. 
It was an entirely unprovoked at-
tack, entirely unauthorized and, ac-
cordingly, it was entirely illegal. 
I think as we go forward, we need to 
get back to some basic, fundamental 
understandings about the constitu-
tional parameters of war powers. 
The American Founders made a 
sharp distinction between starting a 
war and waging a war for some very 
good reasons. They understood that 
this most solemn and lethal decision 
should not be entrusted to one indi-
vidual whose authority would be great-
ly augmented by it. 
The decision to start a war was given 
exclusively to Congress to assure that 
every voice in the country was heard, 
and that Congress, once having taken 
that stand, would be obligated to put 
the resources of the country behind 
that war and those fighting it. 
But once the war has begun, the 
Founders wanted a single Commander 
in Chief directing it with clear and un-
ambiguous authority. There is no surer 
path to military disaster than having 
535 squabbling prima donnas second- 
guessing every decision being made. 
Thus, the President can wage war but 
cannot declare it, and the Congress can 
declare war but cannot wage it. 
The Founders debated these prin-
ciples thoroughly during the Constitu-
tional Convention. They recognized 
that the President did need certain re-
sidual military power to repel an at-
tack when Congress couldn’t act. And I 
believe the War Powers Act faithfully 
defines these circumstances and estab-
lishes a framework to contain them. 
But the War Powers Act does not 
give the President the authority to

launch military attacks except in re-
sponse to a direct attack on our coun-
try, nor can it limit the President’s au-
thority as Commander in Chief once 
Congress does authorize war. 
I believe the 2002 Authorization for 
the Use of Military Force in Iraq was a 
colossal mistake. It created a dan-
gerous power vacuum. It was never 
supported with the full resources of the 
United States, and it was without prov-
ocation. 
But there should be no rewriting of 
history here. It might have been 
George W. Bush who advocated for the 
war and Bush, Obama, and now Presi-
dent Trump who have waged it, but it 
was Congress’ adoption of the AUMF 
that formally started it. 
And once started, only the President 
can wage it. President Trump inherited 
this mess and history will judge how 
well he handles it. Certainly, in this in-
stance, the President not only had 
clear and unambiguous authority to 
order the attack, he had a moral im-
perative to do so. 
What is crystal clear from the debate 
yesterday is that if the Democrats had 
had their way, Soleimani would be 
alive today, and the attack on Amer-
ican troops that he was in the final 
stages of planning would have un-
folded. We would likely, today, be 
mourning very many American casual-
ties. 
If the President, knowing that this 
attack was coming and in full posses-
sion of the opportunity and the author-
ity to stop it, had taken the Demo-
crats’ advice and done nothing, he 
would have been deeply culpable for 
the loss of these Americans. It is 
shocking to me, and perhaps to the 
country as well, that even in hindsight 
this is the course the Democrats have 
made clear that they prefer. 
That brings me to the nature of the 
resolution that the House passed yes-
terday. The separation of war powers 
between the legislative and executive 
branches has been badly blurred in re-
cent decades, and I do believe that we 
need to reestablish not only the con-
stitutional principles that separate the 
declaring of war from the waging of 
war, but also the American tradition 
that we only go to war when we have 
been attacked. 
When we must go to war, we have the 
utmost obligation to put the entire 
might and resources and attention of 
the Nation behind it, and to get it over 
with just as quickly as possible. 
Now, that is a legitimate debate to 
have, but that is not what the House 
did yesterday. Yesterday, it delib-
erately and recklessly undermined the 
position of the United States Govern-
ment and the United States Armed 
Forces that we sent to Iraq, shredding 
the tradition that politics stop at the 
water’s edge. 
In a perilous moment, the House re-
fused to stand behind the war that it 
had authorized in 2002, refused to pro-
tect the men and women that it placed 
in harm’s way, and it gave a hostile 
foreign power a major propaganda vic-
tory. 
That is yet another stain upon the 
honor of this House, and one which 
should be deplored and condemned 
through the ages to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

IMPOSING SANCTIONS WITH RE-
SPECT TO ADDITIONAL SECTORS 
OF IRAN—MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–94) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and the Committee on Financial Serv-
ices and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report 
that I have issued an Executive Order 
(the ‘‘order’’) with respect to Iran that 
takes additional steps with respect to 
the national emergency declared in Ex-
ecutive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995. 
The order takes steps to deny Iran 
revenue, 
including 
revenue 
derived 
from the export of products from key 
sectors of Iran’s economy, that may be 
used to fund and support its nuclear 
program, 
missile 
development, 
ter-
rorism and terrorist proxy networks, 
and malign regional influence. 
The order blocks the property and in-
terests in property of persons deter-
mined by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, in consultation with the Secretary 
of State: 
to operate in the construction, min-
ing, manufacturing, or textiles sectors 
of the Iranian economy, or any other 
sector of the Iranian economy as may 
be determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Sec-
retary of State; 
to have knowingly engaged, on or 
after the date of the order, in a signifi-
cant transaction for the sale, supply, 
or transfer to or from Iran of signifi-
cant goods or services used in connec-
tion with a sector of the Iranian econ-
omy specified in, or determined by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, in consulta-
tion with the Secretary of State, pur-
suant to, section 1(a)(i) of the order; 
to have materially assisted, spon-
sored, or provided financial, material, 
or technological support for, or goods 
or services to or in support of, any per-
son whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to the 
order; or 
to be owned or controlled by, or to 
have acted or purported to act for or on 
behalf of, directly or indirectly, any 
person whose property and interests in 
property are blocked pursuant to the 
order. 
The order also authorizes the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, in consultation 
with the Secretary of State, to impose 
correspondent account and payable- 
through account-related sanctions on a 
foreign financial institution upon de-
termining the foreign financial institu-
tion has, on or after the date of the 
order, knowingly conducted or facili-
tated a significant financial trans-
action: 
for the sale, supply, or transfer to or 
from Iran of significant goods or serv-
ices used in connection with a sector of 
the Iranian economy specified in, or 
determined by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, in consultation with the Sec-
retary of State, pursuant to, section 
1(a)(i) of the order; or 
for or on behalf of any person whose 
property and interests in property are 
blocked pursuant to section 1 of the 
order. 
I have delegated to the Secretary of 
the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, the authority to 
take such actions, including adopting 
rules and regulations, to employ all 
powers granted to the President by 
IEEPA as may be necessary to imple-
ment the order. 
I am enclosing a copy of the order I 
have issued.

WEAPONIZATION OF LANGUAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is 
my honor to be recognized to address 
you here on the floor of the United 
States House of Representatives. 
I come to the floor today, Mr. Speak-
er, because this is the 1-year anniver-
sary of the date that a disparaging mis-
quote in The New York Times was 
posted, January 10 of 2019, this being 
January 10 of 2020. 
I am hopeful that this new year we 
have, 2020, will bring about some clar-
ity of vision on the part of my col-
leagues, the American people, and I 
don’t know that I have as much hope 
for the press. But this day, a year ago 
today, I was misquoted by The New 
York Times. The Times alleged that I 
had used three terms and asked, why 
does that language become offensive? 
Well, the truth is that it was a 56- 
minute telephone interview, a call on 
my cell phone. I didn’t have a way to 
tape it. But I have a practice over the 
years, I have done interviews with any 
kind of media I can think of, and if I 
don’t have a means to tape what I say 
to them, I make it a point not to re-
peat anything, say anything that I 
haven’t already said to the press. That 
way, there is nothing new out there for 
them to take and manipulate it in the 
article.

January 10, 2020 
Friday morning, about 8:35 in the 
morning, I took the call. I would have 
preferred to have done it in the office, 
but sometimes you need to get some 
work done and move on to other 
things, and that was part of the incen-
tive. 
The reporter for The New York 
Times told me that he had been as-
signed by his chief editor to write an 
article about how it is that the immi-
gration policy that I have advocated 
for at least since the first days I came 
to this Congress and years before that, 
so sometime around 2000 or so, that 
that immigration policy of build the 
wall, end birthright citizenship, en-
force the rule of law, end the sanctuary 
cities, and the list of other things that 
have been part of what I have cham-
pioned along the way here in this Con-
gress, he was assigned to write an arti-
cle about how it was that our President 
Donald Trump had adopted my immi-
gration positions and gotten elected on 
those immigration positions, and now 
the national debate was surrounding 
the very topics that I had talked about 
for so long. 
So we embarked upon a 56-minute 
interview. He didn’t have a tape, and I 
didn’t have a tape. I know he didn’t 
have a tape for a couple of reasons. One 
of them was that, on an occasion or 
two, he asked me to carefully repeat 
the statement I had made so that he 
could type it down and get it accurate. 
That told me that was one he is going 
to quote. It wasn’t the one of con-
troversy, however. 
Then the second piece of it was that 
we asked him on the telephone the fol-
lowing week: Do you have a tape? 
His answer was: Why do you want to 
know? 
In that phone call, he would not an-
swer the question as to whether he had 
a tape. We found out later on that he 
had admitted that there was no tape. 
So we asked for his notes. He wouldn’t 
release his notes. We asked him for the 
question that he had posed to me, and 
he wouldn’t even speculate as to what 
the question was that he had posed to 
me in this 56-minute interview. 
He did assert that he can type as fast 
as anyone can talk, that he is highly 
trained on that and so skilled that the 
words would be perfect and so would 
the punctuation be perfect. 
Now, I am here on the floor of this 
House of Representatives. We have 
some of the best stenographers in the 
world here. They get more practice in 
the House than anywhere else, and 
they talk slower in the Senate. I have 
asked them: About how fast can you 
type? 
A lot of them are about 130 words a 
minute on a conventional typewriter, 
and when they get to what I call the 
magic keyboard here, Mr. Speaker, 
then those words may go up to as many 
as 260 words a minute. 
Then I asked them: Can you keep up 
with me when I am on a roll? 
They say: No. We are always glad 
when you pause and let us catch up. 
These are the best there are any-
where. I can’t believe that a reporter 
for The New York Times with a con-
ventional and not a magic keyboard 
can outpace the people on this floor to 
keep up with these fast-talking people 
in the House of Representatives, the 
very best there are in the world. That 
is not his skill set anyway. 
So when he asserts that he could type 
it up accurately with utter precision 
and the punctuation would be correct, 
even when I asked the best in the world 
what about the punctuation, if that 
comes out to be perfect, too, they will 
say: No, I have to go back and listen to 
the tape to make sure we get that part 
of it right. We get the words right, but 
the punctuation may be in question. 
I have great respect for the skill sets 
here. I do not respect the response that 
he gave in defense because it is not be-
lievable that a reporter can be on a 
telephone on the other end typing at a 
speed with the kind of precision nec-
essary to settle the kind of cases that 
we have here. 
Nonetheless, when that story came 
out on the 10th of January, things blew 
up here in this Congress, and I imme-
diately put out a statement that 
should have shut all that criticism 
down. I put it out with clarity. I clear-
ly rejected more emphatically than 
anyone in this House of Representa-
tives has, including the resolution that 
passed the following week, more clear-
ly than anyone else has the idea of the 
odious ideologies of white nationalism 
and white supremacy. 
Those are ideologies that didn’t exist 
in my environment anyplace that I was 
in all of my growing up, in my forma-
tive years, my adult years, and my 
time here in the Congress. 
When our minority leader, KEVIN 
MCCARTHY, asked for a meeting with 
me on the following Monday, it was his 
assertion that it has always meant the 
same thing. I said I don’t know how we 
know, if it is language that has not 
been used or utilized. How do we know 
what it meant to people? You couldn’t 
look up an ideology that is two words, 
not one, in this huge dictionary over 
here. You won’t be able to look up 
‘‘white nationalism’’ or ‘‘white suprem-
acy’’ there because that is a phrase. It 
is an ideology that ties two words to-
gether with a meaning that perhaps 
could be different. 
So in an interview with DAVE PRICE 
of WHO-TV on October 20, 2018, he had 
asked me the question: What is a white 
nationalist? 
I said it might have meant something 
different 1 or 2 or 3 years ago, but 
today it implies racist. I knew that be-
cause I have been paying attention to 
the weaponization of language. This is 
what the left has been doing. They 
have been calling people racist for 20, 
25 years, and they have watched as Re-
publicans—especially 
Southern 
con-
servative Republicans—curl up away 
from that kind of accusation because it 
shuts them down. 
I recall the conversation that I re-
lated, actually, to The New York 
Times reporter in that 56-minute inter-
view. In my answer to the question, 
whatever it was that he asked me: 
What had happened in February 2013? 
That was an immigration meeting 
down the hallway over toward the Sen-
ate side where we had a discussion 
about immigration with four or five 
Senators, five or six House Members, 
and some nongovernment representa-
tives who were also there at the table 
and around the table. 
It was the first time that I had met 
Senator TED
CRUZ. He had made a 
statement that we need to be very 
careful with the language we use, espe-
cially on immigration, because if we 
are not, if we use any language that is 
offensive, they will use it against us. 
I listened to that, and I thought that 
I had better respond. I said: Well, Sen-
ator, I agree with what you said, but 
we also need to keep in mind that if we 
let them define that which is offensive, 
then whatever language is effective 
will be defined as offensive. 
I waited for his answer, which was es-
sentially a nod, which I took to mean 
an agreement with me, and I believe it 
was because it was certainly a logical 
statement, and it was objective. 
I set this up this way, Mr. Speaker, 
so that when I lay out this case, it is 
going to be clearly understood by all 
who are paying attention. It says: I am 
just going to take the term ‘‘white na-
tionalist,’’ that is what KEVIN MCCAR-
THY was so concerned about and believ-
ing that it confirmed some kind of a 
hidden ideology in me that no one had 
been able to discover in personal con-
tact with me that had been discovered 
by The New York Times reporter over 
the telephone. He argued that the re-
sponse I gave, that it might have 
meant something different 1 or 2 or 3 
years ago, exposed that I didn’t know 
that it was a negative connotation that 
had to do with white nationalism. And 
somehow or another, he assigned an-
other belief system to me, which is 
generally what the left does. 
I asked for 24 hours to disprove this. 
He said you have 1 hour and walked out 
of the room—1 hour. Well, it takes a 
lot of digging. I just proved it clearly 
but not in an hour. 
So what I have here, what I would 
like to show you, Mr. Speaker, is this: 
What did the term ‘‘white nation-
alism’’ mean in the year 2000, when it 
was virtually unused, or in any year 
prior to that, when it was also vir-
tually unused? What did it mean in 
2001, 2002, and 2003? All the way up, you 
can see that it was virtually unused, 
and it never even starts to move until 
2016. 
This is a LexisNexis search of the 
term ‘‘white nationalism’’ or ‘‘white 
nationalist,’’ derivatives of this term. 
LexisNexis, Mr. Speaker, goes into 
blogs, web postings, newspaper print, 
and magazine print. You name it, if it 
is in print out there, then LexisNexis is 
very likely to have it all. This is the 
only objective way you can quantify 
the utilization of this term.

‘‘White nationalism’’ is virtually un-
used all the way up until 2016, actually. 
There, it jumped up to 10,000 times a 
year. It was virtually unused, and all of 
a sudden, in 2016, there it goes to 10,000 
times a year; in 2017, 30,000 times; and 
in 2018, it is still up there at 20,000 
times. 
How did it happen that a terminology 
that had been virtually unused all of a 
sudden becomes used multiple times, 
up to 30,000 times a year, when 1 to 200 
times a year is this virtually unused 
definition down here? 
How did it happen that this is the 
word that gets tagged on me? Is that 
an accident, Mr. Speaker? I don’t think 
so. In fact, any objective person look-
ing at the data couldn’t come to that 
conclusion either. 
This is the annual utilization: vir-
tually unused up to 2016, then up to 
10,000 times a year, and then up to 
30,000 times the next year. It is still at 
20,000 the following year. 
This is a weaponized term created by 
the left to attack conservatives with. 
It is one of their weaponized terms. 
They have multiple weaponized terms 
now because they wore out the term 
‘‘racist’’ and needed to make up new 
terms that they could be offended by. 
How did this happen, that 2016 was 
the year that the term ‘‘white nation-
alist’’ was used 10,000 times in that 
year? I asked them to break this thing 
down, LexisNexis’ utilization of ‘‘white 
nationalist,’’ 
month 
by 
month 
throughout the year 2016. That is the 
jump year down here. 
Here is the data. From November and 
December, it is down here, used a little 
more, perhaps you could still call it 
virtually unused, but there is a little 
blip in August. Then it jumps up in No-
vember, and it is still up there in De-
cember. 
What happened in 2016 that brought 
about the use of the term ‘‘white na-
tionalist’’ as an almost always pejo-
rative term? It is almost always used 
to attack conservatives. What hap-
pened? Well, there is the circumstance 
that Donald Trump was elected Presi-
dent of the United States on November 
8, 2016. 
When that happened, there was al-
ready a gathering for the hierarchy of 
the Democratic Party to gather to-
gether at the Mandarin Occidental 
Hotel here in Washington, D.C. Their 
agenda was to best plan how they were 
going to utilize what they expected 
would be a Hillary Clinton Presidency. 
They admitted that they had to change 
their agenda when they got the sur-
prise of Donald Trump winning the 
election as opposed to Hillary. They 
did change their agenda at the Occi-
dental Hotel. 
By the way, it was led by George 
Soros. His face is on the front cover 
here of Politico’s article that tells 
about this. There are several other ar-
ticles, Mr. Speaker, but George Soros 
led on this. 
There, they planned how they were 
going to deal with a Trump Presidency 
and how they were going to try to 
handcuff, tie down, refuse, and resist. 
Mr. Speaker, if we remember what 
happened, that came into our verbiage 
also. I didn’t run the LexisNexis num-
bers on this, but I am certain I am 
right. 
‘‘Resist,’’ 
‘‘resistance 
move-
ment’’ would be also, probably, a little 
more used than ‘‘white nationalist,’’ 
but we might be able to define that as 
virtually unused until the conference 
at the Mandarin Occidental Hotel in 
Washington, D.C., that started on Sun-
day, November 13, the Sunday after 
Trump was elected President. 
There, they planned how they were 
going to deal with the Trump Presi-
dency and how they were going to 
handcuff him, tie him down, resist, re-
sist, and resist. The resistance move-
ment was born in this hotel by Demo-
cratic leadership led by George Soros 
and no doubt funded by George Soros. 
The executive director position that 
was managing over all this was a 
former Soros staff person. 
They planned their resistance move-
ment, and out of that also came some 
words to be weaponized: white nation-
alist, white supremacist, Nazi, and fas-
cist. 
That is what I was talking about in 
my interview with Trip Gabriel as 
what had happened to weaponize lan-
guage and how it was being used 
against people. We should never forget 
that we have the left in this country in 
particular—and I hope it is to a lesser 
degree, and I believe it is, from the 
other side—that assigns a belief system 
to people and then attacks them for 
the belief system that they have as-
signed. They use the words that they 
have been assigned to use to assign to 
people for the belief system that they 
have assigned. 
So what we have is virtually unused 
‘‘white nationalist’’ here throughout 
all these years until we come to 2016. 
Then we have the events of November 
13, 14, and 15, checking out on the 
morning of Wednesday the 16th of No-
vember. That was taking place at the 
Mandarin Occidental Hotel. Clearly, 
somebody said: We are going to start 
using ‘‘white nationalist’’ against con-
servatives. Get to it. 
They were at it while they were in 
the hotel, and it showed up some 5,000 
times in that little window of time 
there. 
Now, if you wonder, well, maybe I am 
not right on the date, Mr. Speaker, I 
had them break down the month of No-
vember 2016. Here is the month of No-
vember. The 1st, 2nd, kind of virtually 
unused, under 100 times in any given 
day. Until you get to they checked in 
here, the 13th of November, and, zing, 
all the way we go up to here to the top 
and back, this peak right here rep-
resents the times that they were in 
that hotel, making the decision and ac-
tivating the weaponization of a number 
of terms but certainly the term ‘‘white 
nationalism.’’ 
b 1315 
So, they all knew what they were 
doing. They were in that hotel, and 
they knew what they were doing. 
I am just not convinced that the peo-
ple in the leadership on the Republican 
side knew what was being perpetrated 
against our ideology, Mr. Speaker. And 
it seemed as though a number of my 
own leadership decided that they were 
going to jump on the bandwagon, too, 
with no chance for self-defense. 
I would reflect that, even if you go 
back through all of Christianity, if you 
go back through Judeo-Christianity, if 
you go back through Western civiliza-
tion, if you go back through the foun-
dation of American culture and civili-
zation—you can go back to Jesus; you 
can go back to St. Paul—everybody ac-
cused had a right to face their accusers 
and had, also, the presumption of inno-
cence until proven guilty. I can find no 
exceptions in anybody’s framework. 
That is the standard. That is the 
civilizational standard. 
I have listened as our minority lead-
er, KEVIN MCCARTHY, has aggressively 
and effectively, I believe—and I am 
glad he is doing it—defended our Presi-
dent of the United States and said that 
he deserves due process and he deserves 
a fair process and that he is innocent 
until proven guilty. I agree with all of 
that. 
But KEVIN MCCARTHY doesn’t seem to 
agree that should be in a manner that 
I would be treated. I believe that I de-
serve due process and I deserve inno-
cent until proven guilty. 
And I would point out that there is 
no evidence to make the case against 
me—no evidence, no real evidence. I 
have put out the fact-check document. 
It is on my website. It went on in 
March of last year. It is about six 
pages. No one has poked a hole in any 
of that rationale. 
And here is another ‘‘no one,’’ Mr. 
Speaker. 
Even though Brett Kavanaugh had 
about six or seven or so accusers, and I 
believe Brett Kavanaugh was unjustly 
accused in every one of those cases, but 
at least he had an opportunity to face 
his accusers and at least one of them 
came forward to testify and could be 
examined by the panel of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary that was there. 
Brett Kavanaugh, I believe, was ex-
onerated from those charges. He is now 
seated on the United States Supreme 
Court, and I believe that he will go on 
to be a stellar Justice on our United 
States Supreme Court. But he had a 
chance to face his accusers, and he had 
them. 
In my case, Mr. Speaker, not only did 
I not have a chance to face my accus-
ers, neither do I have the presumption 
of innocence until proven guilty. But 
on top of that, I don’t have any accus-
ers—not one. Of the tens of thousands 
of people that I have dealt with face to 
face in my years in public life—rough-
ly, a quarter of a century in public life, 
and we have been in the construction 
business dealing with people clear back

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H177 
January 10, 2020 
to 1975—there is not one individual who 
has come forward and said that I have 
treated them in any kind of disrespect-
ful, disparaging, or racist way of any 
kind whatsoever. 
I don’t have an accuser to face, not 
one, unless it might be hearsay. And 
even the hearsay doesn’t seem to be 
out there. 
This 
is 
the 
analysis 
of 
the 
weaponization of language and the 
eager embracement of it by my own 
leadership who has denied me any due 
process. 
So, here I am, the fourth Member of 
Congress in all of history to be re-
moved from my committees—only the 
fourth, Mr. Speaker. And the other 
three, fairly modern history: James 
Traficant, who stood on this floor and 
said, ‘‘Beam me up, Scotty.’’ He was 
convicted of something like nine dif-
ferent Federal felonies and he ran for 
reelection from prison. 
We lost a couple of Republicans in 
this Congress, one from Buffalo and 
one from California, either convicted 
or confessed to Federal felonies. I re-
gret that. But that is three of four are 
Federal felons. 
And then there is me. I am treated 
like a Federal felon by my own leader-
ship in this House of Representatives 
because somebody called the hit from 
up the chain above them, and they de-
cided that they needed to do that under 
the command of the individual or indi-
viduals that called that hit. 
So only four people removed from all 
their committees in the history of this 
Congress, three are either convicted or 
confessed Federal felons, and there is 
me. And there is not even a rule that I 
violated, let alone a law, let alone a 
Federal violation, a felony, to be treat-
ed like a Federal felon by my own lead-
ership for a made-up story that doesn’t 
hold up, cannot hold up under the scru-
tiny of history, and it must be rec-
tified. 
So, on top of that, I have heard our 
esteemed minority leader say that 
there 
is 
no 
constitutional 
charge 
against Donald Trump for impeach-
ment, that they are made-up charges 
on the part of the Democrats, and that 
it is either treason, bribery, high 
crimes, or misdemeanor, and the Presi-
dent has violated none of those. 
And I agree with him. That is true. 
None of those reasons for impeachment 
of a President exists in the activities 
that have been examined here in this 
House of Representatives, even down in 
the secret bunker of ADAM
SCHIFF. 
They don’t exist. 
So they made up a couple of charges, 
and one of them was obstruction of 
Congress, and the other one was about 
putting our Nation at risk. 
Well, that is a judgment call, and I 
think the President made the right 
judgment call on Soleimani; he has 
made a lot of right judgment calls up 
and down the line. 
But because you disagree with the 
President is not a reason to impeach 
him. There is no statute, no law, no 
rule that the President is guilty of, or 
at least has been proven to be guilty of. 
There is no substantive information 
that supports that allegation. 
They impeached the President of the 
United States in this House of Rep-
resentatives on December 18 because 
they don’t like Donald Trump. And 
then part of what they cooked up in 
the Mandarin Hotel on the following 
week after he was elected President in 
2016, those are some of the reasons. 
The biggest reason is they need a 
shield from prosecution in the inves-
tigations and prosecutions that are 
taking place now in the Department of 
Justice and the FBI looking into the 
weaponization of our Federal Govern-
ment for political purposes, for going 
in and misrepresenting information to 
the FISA court, for perhaps duping a 
FISA judge or maybe having a FISA 
judge that should have been a little 
more alert. How many times did James 
Comey sign a FISA request when he 
knew the information was false? You 
can go on and on. 
If that comes forward and indict-
ments are brought forward on that, 
that is going to crush the other side. 
They need this impeachment as a 
shield, and that is the biggest reason 
why they decided to move forward. 
But I believe the foundation was laid 
in that Mandarin Hotel on that week-
end starting on Sunday, November 13, 
2016, and concluding on Wednesday 
when they checked out that morning. I 
believe that is when much of the strat-
egy was put together. 
And I would go further, Mr. Speaker, 
and that is that we had the Mueller in-
vestigation that tied this country up 
for nearly 2 years. The strategy on 
that, I believe, was discussed in that 
hotel room. That is just too close to 
the pattern of things that flowed out of 
there that we do know of. 
And we know from the own words of 
James Comey that he went in to inter-
view the President, to brief the Presi-
dent on whether or not there was the 
existence of an investigation that the 
President was under; and, out of that, 
he typed up his notes and handed them 
over to a professor at Columbia Univer-
sity with the directions or under-
standing that they would be leaked to 
The New York Times, with the objec-
tive of the leakage of those notes that 
were written up by James Comey to 
bring about a special counsel to inves-
tigate Donald Trump for alleged nefar-
ious activities in Russia and that the 
special counsel was to be Robert 
Mueller. 
All of that was known before James 
Comey went in to brief Donald Trump. 
All that was known before to James 
Comey. 
As that flowed out and Mueller is 
named as the special counsel, we went, 
then, through 2 years, and we had the 
investigators that went from 13 up to 
18, built-in bias in most of them and 
perhaps all of them, and they came up 
empty. And that was about May 7 of 
last year. 
Then they had to look for another 
reason to impeach this President. They 
thought the Mueller report was going 
to do it, and it didn’t. They couldn’t 
make the case. They tried. And after-
wards, some of them tried again. They 
tried to resurrect it again and again. 
Finally, the house of cards on the 
Mueller investigation collapsed, and 
they had to come up with something 
new. 
Well, then there is the phone call of 
July 25 of last year, which I have read 
through the transcript of that multiple 
times, Mr. Speaker. Never do I see any-
thing in there that troubles me. 
And I believe Professor Jonathan 
Turley, in his testimony before the 
House Committee on the Judiciary, 
when he said, to the effect that, if you 
had told George Washington that he 
could be impeached for a conversation 
he had, that his powdered wig would 
catch on fire. That is what we are deal-
ing with. 
So these very, very thin excuses for 
impeachment, but the calendar was 
turning pages over and they needed to 
get this done, so they took the thinnest 
of excuses and turned that into what 
was a show for the American people 
that I think will live in infamy 
throughout history. 
In my case, Mr. Speaker, I have 
clearly proven that these allegations 
are false. There is no rule that I have 
violated. There is nothing that is 
pointed to. There is nothing in history 
that says that there is a pattern in this 
Congress that the freedom of speech of 
a Member of Congress, whether he is 
accurately quoted or not, can be dis-
ciplined by the will or whim of a leader 
in this House of Representatives. 
Everyone in this country has to have 
the First Amendment right, freedom of 
speech, religion, and the press, and all 
of the rest of the rights that we have in 
the Bill of Rights. 
But the chilling effect of the actions 
taken by the leader here of the minor-
ity in the House of Representatives 
chills the freedom of speech of every-
body in here—at least on the Repub-
lican side—and everybody that is ei-
ther running as a candidate in, poten-
tially, a primary or aspires to run for 
office. 
The most principled people we have 
in this country will not want to submit 
to censorship by a leader that may or 
may not have enjoyed their support to 
get elected to that leadership position. 
This is a chilling, chilling effect, and 
the history of this is not going to go 
down very well as people examine what 
happened. There is much, much more 
to come out. 
Mr. Speaker, as I watch the clock 
tick down, I make the point that I have 
introduced a resolution here, and I will 
have a number early next week, but it 
has just gone in in the last few hours. 
I have been waiting to drop this resolu-
tion. I am dropping it and introducing 
it on the anniversary of the misquote 
that got dropped on me 1 year ago 
today for The New York Times that al-
legedly launched this firestorm that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H178 
January 10, 2020 
has brought about these things that I 
have talked about. 
This resolution makes the case clear-
ly that The New York Times could not 
be right and that I could not be wrong, 
and the balance of this was people 
wanting it to be true and so they wrote 
it up. 
So this disproves The New York 
Times quote; and, additionally, Mr. 
Speaker, I delivered that quote on the 
floor of the House of Representatives 
the following Tuesday in the fashion 
that I would have said it if I had actu-
ally said it. 
In other words, I would never tie to-
gether white nationalism, white su-
premacy, and Western civilization. No, 
Mr. Speaker, I would never do that, be-
cause they don’t fit at all together. 
The pejorative terms were: Nazi, fas-
cist, white nationalist, white suprem-
acy. And I made the point there would 
be a distinct pause, and I would start 
from the beginning and say, But West-
ern civilization, how did that language 
become pejorative? Why I did sit in 
classrooms while all of that time being 
taught about the merits of our civiliza-
tion? 
And this CONGRESSIONAL RECORD mis-
quoted me exactly the same way that 
The New York Times did. This amend-
ment fixes that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE 
By unanimous consent, leave of ab-
sence was granted to: 
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK (at the request of 
Mr. HOYER) for today on account of

the family.

p.m.), under its previous order, the 
House adjourned until Monday, Janu-
ary 13, 2020, at noon for morning-hour

IN MEMORY OF MR. BENJAMIN 
‘‘BEN’’ EVANS 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 10, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay tribute to a tal-
ented tailor, dedicated husband, loving father, 
and dear friend of longstanding—Mr. Benjamin 
‘‘Ben’’ Evans. Sadly, Ben passed away on 
Thursday, January 2, 2020. His funeral service 
will be held on Saturday, January 11, 2020, at 
1:00 pm at New Pleasant Grove Missionary 
Baptist Church located at 795 Maynard Street 
in Macon, Georgia. 
Benjamin Evans (affectionately known as 
‘‘Ben’’ to his family, friends, and colleagues) 
was born in Bibb County, Georgia to the late 
Clifford Danielly and Fannie B. Evans. He was 
born on August 5, 1929 and was the eldest of 
two sons. 
He attended Hudson High School in Macon, 
Georgia and later joined the U.S. Army. Ben 
was a veteran, having retired from the military 
as a Staff Sergeant with 22 years of service. 
He was always industrious and hard-working. 
He attended Morgan State College in Balti-
more, Maryland where he majored in Fashion 
Design. He loved men’s fashion. Having 
learned the art of tailoring, Ben was so skilled 
that he could design a suit without a pattern. 
Known for being one of the best-dressed men 
in Macon, he loved to design matching outfits 
for himself and his beloved wife, Lillie Ruth. 
Ben opened an alteration shop, Genesis, and 
operated it in Downtown Macon for many 
years. He also served as the Business Man-
ager and Co-Owner of Gantt’s Pre-School and 
M.A. Evans Academy. 
On June 2, 1982, Ben was joined in Holy 
Matrimony to the Love of His Life, Lillie Ruth 
Gantt-Evans. They married after a long court-
ship. He made a dress from memory for his 
beloved Lillie Ruth and presented it to her as 
a gift on their first date. 
Ben accepted Christ at an early age where 
he was a member of Friendship Baptist 
Church in Macon, GA. He later became a 
member of New Pleasant Grove Missionary 
Baptist Church where he served on the Trust-
ee Board. 
Ben cared about his community, and he 
was always engaged in organizations that did 
positive work. He served dutifully as a mem-
ber of the following organizations: Disabled 
American Veterans (Life Member), Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, Homosapien Civic & Social 
Club, former member of 100 Black Men of 
Middle Georgia, Inc., Bibb County Democrats 
(Post Seat Holder), and former member of the 
Civil Service Board of Bibb County. Ben en-
joyed sewing and loved to listen to music. He 
had a vast collection of blues and jazz. He 
loved to attend the annual Tom Bonner Picnic 
and VFW events and cared about the commu-
nity. 
Ben accomplished much in his life, but none 
of this would have been possible without the 
Grace of God; the love and support of his 
wife, Lillie Ruth; his children, Chandra, Merita, 
Gregory, and Jimmy (deceased); his stepson 
Freeman; and a host of family and friends who 
will miss him deeply. 
On a personal note, I have been truly 
blessed with Ben’s and Lillie Ruth’s friendship 
and support over the years. Ben and Lillie 
Ruth have long had a passion for civic in-
volvement manifested by unreserved support 
of candidates they believed would use the 
public trust of elected office to benefit their 
community. They worked tirelessly in voter 
registration, voter education, and voter partici-
pation. Together they could place campaign 
signs across the Macon landscape with such 
precision and creativity that they appeared to 
grow out of the ground overnight. Never have 
two people worked together for so long in so 
many elections for so many candidates and so 
successfully as the ‘‘Ben and Lillie Ruth’’ polit-
ical team. I and countless other elected offi-
cials benefited and for their tireless service we 
will forever be grateful. Truly Macon, Bibb 
County, and America are better because Ben-
jamin Evans passed our way. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more 
than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second 
Congressional District, in paying tribute to Mr. 
Benjamin ‘‘Ben’’ Evans and in extending our 
deepest sympathies to his family, friends and, 
loved ones during this difficult time of bereave-
ment. Moreover, we pray that we will all be 
consoled and comforted by an abiding faith 
and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and 
months ahead.

TRIBUTE TO LISA C. WILLIAMS 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 10, 2020 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a great humanitarian, a 
proud military veteran, and a woman some 
call ‘‘a latter-day Harriett Tubman.’’ Lisa C. 
Williams is a survivor, a fighter and a cham-
pion for all who have been sexually exploited. 
She is an inspiration and an example of how 
one person can make a tremendous change in 
the world. 
A U.S. Air Force and Army commissioned 
officer, Ms. Williams left the service with an 
honorable discharge and set her sights on 
helping women and children victimized by sex 
trafficking, sexual exploitation, and intimate 
partner violence. Drawing from her own expe-
riences to find freedom from a life of trauma 
and sexual abuse, she founded Circle of 
Friends: Celebrating Life, Inc., in 1999. She 
has worked for more than twenty years to help 
educate, equip, and empower women to live 
their best lives, free of violence. 
As the founder of Living Water Learning Re-
source Center, Ms. Williams has developed a 
program that the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tions (FBI) calls ‘‘one of the most comprehen-
sive, rehabilitative programs for child victims of 
sex trafficking in the country.’’ Over the years, 
she has helped hundreds of children and 
young women reclaim their lives from sexual 
abuse. 
Ms. Williams is an author, an orator, and a 
thought leader and has taken her message to 
the White House and the United Nations. She 
travels the world as a motivational Speaker for 
the Centre for H.O.P.E. (Helping Other People 
Excel), and hosts the podcast Front Porch 
Conversations. 
I have grown to know Ms. Williams through 
her partnership and support of the annual Na-
tional Health Disparities Conference, which I 
help coordinate with the Medical University of 
South Carolina and can attest to her powerful 
presence and message. 
Her work has been featured in numerous 
publications, including: O Magazine, Essence, 
Ebony, Glamour, Black Enterprise, Good 
Housekeeping, Woman’s Day, Cosmopolitan, 
and Seventeen. She has appeared in film and 
television on the award-winning CNN Special 
Report: Children for Sale: The Fight to End 
Human Trafficking, CNN International News, 
CNN Freedom Project, BBC Brazil, and C– 
SPAN. 
Ms. Williams has been honored by numer-
ous organizations, including CNN, Ford Motor 
Company, Porsche USA, YWCA, Glamour, 
and L’Ore´al Paris. 
She earned a Bachelor of Science from 
Campbell University, a Masters of Arts from 
Bowie State University and attended a doc-
toral program at Virginia Tech. Ms. Williams 
latest endeavor is establishing the Circle of 
Friends Impact and Circle of Friends Impact 
Legacy Scholarship Fund endowments at Bos-
ton University. 
To honor her contributions, the university 
will dedicate the Lisa C. Williams Listening 
Room in her honor at the Howard Thurman 
Center for Common Ground. This room is a 
safe space for quiet meditation, introspection 
and contemplation, which is being dedicated 
on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day this year. The 
room dedication is part of a program spot-
lighting women who advocate for social jus-
tice. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in applauding the selfless 
work that Lisa C. Williams has done to end 
sexual exploitation and help those who have 
been victimized by this brutal crime to live 
their best lives. She is a true example of self-
less service for country and community, and 
her work has changed so many lives, includ-
ing her own. I offer Ms. Williams best wishes 
as she is honored in Boston, and I look for-
ward to watching her ongoing efforts and their 
tremendous impacts.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO NICHOLAS 
FISH 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 10, 2020 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to a lifetime of public service. This 
week, Nicholas Fish, or Nick as his friends 
called him, passed away. He will be fondly re-
membered for his commitment to advancing 
the quality of urban life for all. 
Nick was born in New York City in 1958. 
After attending the Dutchess Day School as a 
child in Millbrook, NY, and later St. Alban’s 
School in Washington, DC, he earned his 
bachelor’s degree in 1981 from Harvard and in 
1986 he completed a J.D. at Northeastern 
University. 
Politics and public service were a family 
business for Nick. His father and grandfather 
Hamilton Fish IV and III—both served in the 
U.S. House of Representatives. His great- 
great-grandfather, Hamilton Fish, served as a 
congressman, senator, governor of New York 
and secretary of state to President Ulysses S. 
Grant. 
Nick continued this illustrious family tradi-
tion, cutting his teeth as a Legislative Assist-
ant for Congressman Barney Frank of Massa-
chusetts, an experience that he would often 
say fueled his passion for serving others. 
After earning his Juris Doctor, he practiced 
law in New York City, representing healthcare 
workers and labor unions. He was appointed 
to Manhattan’s Community Board Five, where 
he served as Chair for two years. In that ca-
pacity, Nick championed the upgrade of the 
Times Square Hotel. In collaboration with local 
nonprofits, the hotel was transformed into af-
fordable housing and a thriving community for 
residents with HIV, previously homeless indi-
viduals and employees of New York City’s the-
ater district. 
In the mid-1990s, Nick’s wife, Patricia, was 
offered a job at Portland State University and 
the couple moved west, settling in the Goose 
Hollow neighborhood of Portland. Although 
new to the West Coast, Nick and Patricia 
quickly made fast friends in the community 
and he continued his pursuit of public service 
in their new community. He joined the board 
of the Housing Authority of Portland and 
worked to raise money for local nonprofits that 
assisted victims of domestic abuse and vulner-
able children. 
In 2008, Nick was elected to the Portland 
City Council. There he was a steadfast voice 
for affordable housing. He was instrumental in 
the creation of a separate city agency dedi-
cated to addressing housing issues and ex-
panding and renovating Portland parks. For 11 
years on the Portland City Council, he earned 
a reputation as a steady hand, helping im-
prove the Council and make local government 
work for everyone. Known for a steady tem-
perament and sharp policy mind, he often took 
on the toughest assignments of local govern-
ment, such as overseeing the city water and 
sewers bureaus, simultaneously. Even after 
confronting health challenges, Nick continued 
his tireless work, serving on the City Council 
until just a few days ago. 
Today, our nation, the Capitol Hill Commu-
nity and the City of Portland have lost a dedi-
cated statesman and a consummate public 
servant. It is my hope that Patricia and his two 
children, 
Maria 
and 
Chapin, 
may 
draw 
strength and comfort from his many contribu-
tions. I ask all my colleagues to join me in 
paying homage to a lifetime of service and re-
membering Nick Fish.

HONORING CHARLES HOWARD 
BRADSHAW 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 10, 2020 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Charles Howard Bradshaw, a Fire De-
partment Chief and business owner in Henry 
County, and his wife Sherri, who died on De-
cember 13, 2019. Mr. Bradshaw was a tre-
mendous contributor to Henry County and his 
presence will be missed. 
Mr. Bradshaw was president of Triangle 
Electric Corporation, a privately-owned and 
operated business since 1965, but had also 
long served as a first responder. In the 1980s, 
Mr. Bradshaw was employed with the Fieldale 
Police Department. Since 2007, he had been 
Chief of the Horsepasture Volunteer Fire De-
partment. In 2010, he was honored as Out-
standing Firefighter for the month of May and 
Fire Officer of the year. 
In addition to his business and first re-
sponder activities, Mr. Bradshaw served on 
the Henry County Building Board of Appeal. 
In 2010, he was recognized for his many 
years volunteering with Henry County by re-
ceiving the Jack Dalton Community Service 
Award. 
Charles and Sherri Bradshaw are survived 
by their daughter, Ashlee Bradshaw (James 
Hill); son, Michael Bradshaw (Crystal Beckett); 
sister-in-law, 
Barbara 
Bradshaw; 
grand-
children, Hunter, Logan, Lauren, Rylee, Nikole 
and Jordan; nephew, Jonathan Bradshaw (Eli-
sha); and several other nieces and nephews. 
Henry County and the Commonwealth of 
Virginia were fortunate to have a great volun-
teer, leader, and businessman in their commu-
nity. I offer my condolences to the Bradshaw 
family, the volunteers of the Horsepasture Fire 
Department, and the people of Henry County 
on their loss.

RECOGNIZING STEWART MORRIS’ 
100TH BIRTHDAY AND THE MOR-
RIS FAMILY CENTER FOR LAW 
AND LIBERTY AT HOUSTON BAP-
TIST UNIVERSITY 
HON. BILL FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 10, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Dr. Stewart Morris, who turned 
100 years old on October 28, 2019. 
To commemorate this occurrence, Houston 
Baptist 
University 
hosted 
a 
ceremonial 
groundbreaking of the new Morris Family Cen-
ter for Law and Liberty in honor of its name-
sake and founding father of the University, Dr. 
Stewart Morris. 
Growing up in Houston, Morris was known 
as a cantankerous boy. He notoriously adopt-
ed a pet leopard named Spot who he kept in 
his room to stop family members from entering 
his personal space. At the age of ten, Morris 
displayed a natural drive to succeed and start-
ed his first job as Office Boy at the family 
business, Stewart Title. He quickly worked his 
way up from running errands to making busi-
ness transactions. 
In 1943, Morris experienced many major 
milestones. He graduated from The University 
of Texas with a BA, Southern Methodist Uni-
versity with a JD, and Columbia University 
with a Midshipman’s degree all in the same 
year. Following his many academic accom-
plishments, Morris joined the Navy and mar-
ried his wife Joella Mitchell. Together they 
were blessed with three children. 
As an officer in the Navy, Morris was sent 
to the South Pacific. A young and frightened 
sailor, Morris distinguished himself by working 
to establish discipline and order aboard his 
ship. 
Following the close of World War II in 1945, 
Morris returned home to Texas, where he re-
sumed work at Stewart Title. Determined to 
expand the business, Morris began traveling 
all over Texas, picking up a pilot’s license and 
became proficient in Spanish along the way. 
Under Morris’ diligent leadership, Stewart Title 
grew rapidly from a local Houston business to 
an international powerhouse with offices in all 
50 states, 13 foreign countries, and over 9,000 
locations. 
His hunger for excellence, forward thinking- 
ethos, and deep faith in God inspired those 
around him. It was often said by his peers that 
‘‘when Morris was at the helm of a project, it 
seemed like nothing was impossible.’’ It was 
this same sense of passion and joy for life that 
made Morris the perfect leader to pioneer the 
establishment of a new Christian college in 
Houston, Texas. 
In 1952, Morris joined the Union Baptist As-
sociation in raising funds and assessing land 
for the new Houston Baptist University. For 
the past 67 years, Morris dedicated countless 
hours of his time and generous financial con-
tributions to this community. A peer once said 
about Morris that ‘‘there is no single person 
more influential in the founding and earliest 
history of HBU.’’ 
On his 100th birthday, the Houston Baptist 
University community joined together in cele-
brating the life and accomplishments of Dr. 
Stewart 
Morris 
with 
the 
ceremonial 
groundbreaking of the Morris Family Center 
for Law and Liberty. This new center will work 
to promote a greater understanding and ap-
preciation for our nations history and founding 
principles amongst students. 
Madam Speaker, Dr. Stewart Morris has 
lived a long life filled with love, joy, and dedi-
cated to his belief that ‘‘its more blessed to 
give than to receive.’’ I am proud to recognize 
him on this joyous occasion and know that his 
family and friends love him and are proud of 
him. I wish Morris many more years of health 
and happiness. 
I have requested that a United States flag 
be flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recog-
nize Dr. Stewart Morris’ 100th Birthday. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans to 
continue to pray for our country, for our vet-
erans, for our military men and women who 
protect us, and for our first responders who 
keep us safe at home.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDITH 
CUNNANE 
HON. ANN WAGNER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 10, 2020 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
deeply saddened by the loss of a wonderful 
friend and mentor and integral member of the 
St. Louis community. Today, in Missouri’s 
Second Congressional District, Mrs. Edith 
Cunnane is being laid to rest following an in-
credible and selfless life of service. 
Along with her beloved husband, Jim 
Cunnane, Edith made St. Louis her home and 
worked to improve the lives of the most vul-
nerable. She was a fixture of the St. Louis 
philanthropic community for decades as a 
community volunteer and activist, civic leader, 
and supporter of social services. She had an 
endless desire, willingness, and ability to help 
others. With this boundless passion, Edith 
founded the St. Patrick Center in 1982. The 
first of its kind in the region, the St. Patrick 
Center is a multifaceted social service agency 
that serves the homeless and at-risk individ-
uals. 
Over her nearly forty-year tenure at the 
Center, Edith sought to expand its services to 
unprecedented heights. Under her leadership, 
the St. Patrick Center opened the Shamrock 
Club, the first day treatment program for indi-
viduals suffering from behavioral health issues 
in the entire nation. Additionally, Edith spear-
headed the St. Patrick Center’s Casserole 
Program, an initiative where groups of volun-
teers bake, freeze, and deliver casseroles to 
the needy. Since its inception thirty-five years 
ago, this program has served over five and a 
half million hot meals across the Greater St. 
Louis area. 
Edith’s efforts have been an inspiration to 
countless individuals. During her tenure, Edith 
mobilized over three thousand volunteers to 
help their fellow citizens, turning the St. Pat-
rick Center into a beacon for homeless assist-
ance and social services providers. Last year 
alone, the Center provided nearly sixty thou-
sand services to over three thousand people 
and served close to one hundred and fifty 
thousand hot meals. 
Edith’s drive to help others involved many 
forms of public service. A former staff member 
for Congressman Jim Talent, Edith went on to 
become a member of the St. Louis County 
Council in 1998. She used this experience to 
work 
with 
institutions 
and 
organizations 
throughout the region to continue improving 
the lives of others. She served on the board 
of directors for the St. Louis County Library as 
well as the Today and Tomorrow Education 
Foundation, which strives to provide edu-
cational opportunities for children in need. 
For her years of generosity and hard work, 
Edith has been recognized locally, nationally, 
and globally. At the local level, she received 
numerous awards, most notably the St. Louis 
Women of Achievement Award and the St. 
Louis Community Leader Award. Nationally, 
President George H.W. Bush bestowed upon 
Edith the Thousand Points of Light Award in 
1991. At the international level, she was 
awarded the United Nations Human Rights 
Award. I believe it is not only appropriate, but 
necessary, to honor Edith’s incredible life be-
fore the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Edith is survived by her husband, Jim, their 
two children, Jim Jr. and Cori, and six beau-
tiful grandchildren, along with many family 
members and friends. I extend my sincerest 
condolences and prayers to the Cunnane fam-
ily as they mourn this immeasurable loss and 
celebrate Edith’s life and all the love she gave 
to those around her. Edith and her faith, work, 
and unwavering generosity will never be for-
gotten. We thank God for blessing us with her 
life.

HONORING THE LIFE OF NEEDHAM 
SLADE HURST 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 10, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Needham Slade Hurst, a renowned Hoosier 
business executive and dedicated community 
leader. His passion and drive for excellence 
led him to successes as a student, army offi-
cer, and business executive. Needham’s phil-
anthropic and community service helped to 
uplift the lives of countless fellow Hoosiers. 
The people of Indiana’s Fifth Congressional 
District are forever grateful for Needham’s im-
mense contributions to the State of Indiana. 
Born to parents Needham King (N.K.) and 
Martha Slade Hurst on October 15th, 1933, in 
Indianapolis, Indiana, young Needham was 
brought up to be industrious in his work, kind 
and fair to others, and to be charitable to his 
fellow citizens. In 1938, his father founded the 
N.K. Hurst Company. The company began as 
a distributor of coffee, tea, sugar and other 
food commodities to local grocers throughout 
the State of Indiana. In 1947, they began 
packaging edible dry beans, a product that 
has become so popular over the decades that 
it has made the Hurst’s Beans name a nation-
ally known brand, synonymous with the high-
est of quality. As the years went by, young 
Needham showed himself to be an exemplary 
student at Broad Ripple High School. It was 
during his time at Broad Ripple that he would 
meet and fall in love with fellow student Mary 
Lou Beesley. 
After graduation from Broad Ripple High 
School in 1951, Needham matriculated at Indi-
ana University in Bloomington, Indiana. It was 
during this time in his life that Needham and 
Mary Lou would marry in 1954. In 1956 he de-
parted from Indiana University having earned 
both his Bachelors of Science in Business and 
a Masters in Business Administration. Having 
been a member of the Reserve Officer Train-
ing Corp while at Indiana University Needham 
then went on to answer his country’s call to 
duty, joining the United States Army in 1956. 
During his time in the Army, Needham served 
in the Quartermasters Corp, while stationed at 
Fort Lee in Petersburg, Virginia. By the time of 
his honorable discharge from the United 
States Army in 1958, Needham had risen 
through the ranks, ultimately attaining the rank 
of 2nd Lieutenant. 
Later in 1958, Needham and Mary Lou re-
turned to Indianapolis to settle down and raise 
their children, son Rick, and daughter Cathy. 
Upon his arrival back in Indianapolis, Need-
ham began his career at the family business, 
N.K. Hurst Company, where he initially worked 
in sales. In the succeeding years Needham 
would ascend to the position of Company 
President, working hand in hand with his 
brother Bill Hurst to grow the family business. 
Under the leadership of Needham and Bill, the 
N.K. Hurst Company expanded its operations 
becoming a nationwide distributor of coffee, 
tea, sugar and other food commodities. It was 
also during this time that the company be-
came a major supplier of these food commod-
ities to the United States Military Commissary 
Network. Having successfully stewarded the 
company through the decades, Needham and 
Bill, were able to pass the ownership and op-
erations of the company to the 3rd and 4th 
generations of the Hurst Family. 
Wanting to spread the good fortune of the 
company’s success to those less fortunate in 
Indiana, Needham and Bill continued the com-
pany’s long history of supplying local food 
banks and charitable organizations with food 
supplies. This commitment to the betterment 
of his fellow Hoosiers is something that Need-
ham practiced throughout his life. Needham 
served others in the community in a variety of 
different roles including serving as a church 
elder and deacon at the Second Presbyterian 
Church. He also maintained a role in encour-
aging youth sports as a basketball coach at 
the Jordan YMCA, and as a board member of 
the Indianapolis Junior Tennis Board. 
Needham also lent his leadership skills to 
many organizations throughout the State of In-
diana. Terms serving on the Board of Direc-
tors of the Indiana University Foundation, as 
Governor of the Orchard School of Indianap-
olis, and as a Franklin College Trustee al-
lowed Needham the opportunity to provide 
countless educational opportunities to ensuing 
generations 
of 
Hoosiers. 
Needham 
also 
served his community through his membership 
in organizations including the Beta Theta Pi 
Fraternity, the Junto Club, the YPO (formerly 
the Young President Organization) and the 
University Club of Indianapolis. 
Along with his beloved wife Mary Lou, and 
son Rick, Needham served on the Board of 
St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis. Having 
also served as a member of the Board of St. 
Vincent Hospital, I had the distinct pleasure of 
developing a close friendship and working re-
lationship with the Hurst Family. 
Needham cherished the summers he would 
spend with his family and friends on Lake 
Wawasee. His love of boating was a lifelong 
passion that he shared with succeeding gen-
erations of his family. Trips around Lake 
Wawasee in his boat ‘‘Little Sugar’’, a 1951, 
16′ Century inboard were a favorite pastime of 
his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, es-
pecially during the ‘‘Thunder Run’’ parade of 
vintage boats on Sunday mornings. Need-
ham’s love for Lake Wawasee inspired him to 
serve on the Wawasee Area Conservancy 
Foundation, an organization aimed at keeping 
a clean and healthy lake for future generations 
to enjoy. 
After a long life of service to others, Need-
ham passed away surrounded by his family 
and loved ones on January 1, 2020. Needham 
will be forever missed by the many Hoosiers 
whose life he impacted. On behalf of Indiana’s 
Fifth Congressional District, I extend my deep-
est condolences to Needham’s beloved wife 
Mary Lou, their daughter Cathy Meyer and her 
husband Philip, their son Rick Hurst and his

CONGRATULATING 
BRIAN 
HINTZ 
ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE 
POLICE 
DEPARTMENT 
OF 
GRAPEVINE, TEXAS 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 10, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Brian Hintz on his well- 
earned retirement from the Grapevine Police 
Department after more than twenty years of 
dedicated service. 
Brian is a hardworking and highly respected 
Senior Officer at the Grapevine Police Depart-
ment. He has honorably served as an officer 
in the state of Texas since beginning his dis-
tinguished career with the Midland Police De-
partment in August of 1990. During his time in 
Midland, Brian served as a K–9 officer along 
with his K–9 partners, Lex and Rio. 
In 1999, Brian joined the Grapevine Police 
Department where he has served for more 
than two decades with the K–9 unit. Attaining 
the rank of Senior Officer, Brian has received 
numerous recognitions throughout his career, 
including the 2014 Medal of Valor and the 
2016 Life Saving Award. Furthermore, Brian, 
along with his K–9 partners Darby and 
Brinkley, have won numerous K–9 competition 
awards, advancing to the United States Police 
Canine Association Nationals. Brian’s commit-
ment to service is apparent through these out-
standing achievements, and his dedication to 
continuing his law enforcement career is dem-
onstrated through the 6,791 training hours that 
he has accumulated. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recognize 
the exhaustive work that Brian has contributed 
to the City of Grapevine and the state of 
Texas. I applaud his work and ask all my dis-
tinguished colleagues to join me in recognizing 
Senior Officer Brian Hintz for his many years 
of service.

5G DEPLOYMENT AND CONSULTA-
TION WITH LOCAL STAKE HOLD-
ERS 
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, January 10, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
this week the House considers important 
pieces of legislation related to the global race 
to 5G. 5G is the newest iteration of wireless 
technology, and as telecommunications com-
panies and service providers begin deploying 
their digital cellular networks, I want to take a 
moment to discuss an important aspect of the 
5G rollout: consultation with local governments 
and homeowners. 
Last year, the 5G rollout began in my district 
in parts of Baton Rouge. The utility poles 
needed to support the new small wireless fa-
cilities and other 5G infrastructure are being 
installed in public rights of way in front of 
homes. While it is absolutely an economic and 
national security priority to win the race to 5G, 
it is vital that Congress consider the impact 
that this rollout will have on communities 
across America. 
In June, I sent a letter to Federal Commu-
nications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai out-
lining my concerns and urging service pro-
viders to work closely with local stake holders 
as they install this new technology infrastruc-
ture. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the following letter to the FCC from June 13, 
2019. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, June 13, 2019. 
Hon. AJIT PAI, 
Chairman, Federal Communications Commis-
sion, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
PAI: 
Recently, 
tele-
communications 
service 
providers 
have 
begun installing the new wireless broadband 
infrastructure that is necessary to support 
5G in cities across America, including Baton 
Rouge. While I share your appreciation for 
the tremendous role that technology plays, 
both in the economy and in the lives of its 
users, I am concerned by the roll out of these 
small-cell facilities in homes and neighbor-
hoods across my district. 
A technological transformation of 5G’s 
magnitude requires a massive support struc-
ture, but that deployment cannot come at 
the expense of property values and neighbor-
hood aesthetics, especially in historic com-
munities. America’s 5G leadership is an im-
portant national priority, but even a na-
tional priority demands consultation with 
local stakeholders. I respectfully ask you to 
encourage wireless carriers to collaborate 
with municipalities on the placement and 
design of these new transmission systems. 
Additionally, recent reports by the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion (NOAA) and the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration (NASA) suggest 
that the 5G network could interfere with sat-
ellite data, reducing the accuracy of weather 
forecasting by as much as 30 percent. I urge 
you to work closely with the NOAA, NASA, 
and any other stakeholders to investigate 
any potential effects of 5G on our nation’s 
ability to forecast and prepare for severe 
weather events. 
As the FCC continues to oversee the de-
ployment of the 5G network, we must re-
member that the rollout is not happening in 
isolation. It is crucial to consider the effects 
that these innovations will have on existing 
technologies and communities across Amer-
ica. Thank you for your prompt attention to 
these important issues. 
Sincerely, 
GARRET GRAVES, 
Member of Congress.
