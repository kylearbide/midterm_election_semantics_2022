PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Merciful God, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
The flags on Capitol Hill are all at 
half-mast as we recall that day 19 years 
ago when the security of our Nation 
was threatened so devastatingly. We 
pray that the children of this genera-
tion and their children’s children may 
never have to experience another day 
like the one that flooded our TV 
screens so many years ago. 
Protect and guide this Nation to a 
new security, built upon human integ-
rity and communal solidarity with all 
who love freedom and human dignity, 
while respecting the lives and beliefs of 
others. 
Empower governments around the 
world to establish just laws and seek 
the common good that will lead to 
ways of equity and peace. Bless the 
Members of this people’s House as they 
hear the voices of all their constitu-
ents—those who voted for them and 
those who did not. Give them wisdom 
and good judgment in the legislative 
work that remains to be completed be-
fore the final weeks leading up to the 
election. 
May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and service of 
Lance Gershen, M.D. 
Dr. Gershen was born in 1944 in New York 
City, where he spent his childhood. He at-
tended Stuyvesant High School and then went 
on to study at Brooklyn College of The City 
University of New York. After graduating in 
1965, Dr. Gershen received his M.D. from Al-
bert Einstein College of Medicine in 1969. 
Dr. Gershen’s professional ambitions were 
delayed when he was drafted into the U.S. 
Navy during the Vietnam War, during which 
time he served at the Naval Station Great 
Lakes in Chicago. Upon discharge from the 
military, Dr. Gershen moved to California 
where he completed his residency at The Chil-
dren’s Hospital Los Angeles. Dr. Gershen then 
made his way to Contra Costa County and 
began working as a pediatrician at Diablo Val-
ley Pediatrics where he became a principal 
partner. Dr. Gershen was also the Pediatric 
Department Chairman at several local hos-
pitals and President of the East Bay Pediatric 
Society. One of Dr. Gershen’s many achieve-
ments came when he developed the first alter-
native birthing center in the East Bay. Dr. 
Gershen’s professional legacy, which spanned 
over 40 years, is one of thoughtfulness and 
dedication to children and families. 
In his personal life, Dr. Gershen was an ac-
tive participant in his community. He was a 
member of Congregation B’nai Tikvah in Wal-
nut Creek, the J Mensch men’s group, and 
helped found JBL, a Jewish men’s softball 
team. Above all else, Dr. Gershen loved 
spending time with his family. Dr. Gershen’s 
faith in humanity was seen in his compas-
sionate nature and his work to improve the 
lives of others. 
Following Dr. Gershen’s diagnosis with Par-
kinson’s Disease, he learned about the Parkin-
son Network of Mt. Diablo. Serving as co- 
president, he worked to support and provide 
resources to others living with the disease. Dr. 
Gershen’s own battle with Parkinson’s never 
impacted his work to help others. 
Sadly, Dr. Gershen passed away this year 
at the age of 75. He is survived by his eight 
children, fourteen grandchildren, and his wife 
Cindy. Please join me in honoring Dr. Lance 
Gershen for his many contributions to our 
community and this country. Dr. Gershen was 
a cherished member of Contra Costa County 
and he will be missed. 
RECOGNIZING AMBER HARBIN 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to remember the 2,977 victims who 
lost their lives in the World Trade Center, the 
Pentagon, and four hijacked planes. 
For all Americans, September 11th will be 
marked in our minds and hearts forever as a 
solemn day where innocent men and women 
were killed in what became the greatest attack 
on this nation since Pearl Harbor. 
After the attacks, the Conway Fire Depart-
ment sent firefighters to Ground Zero in New 
York to help. In October 2011, the Conway 
Fire Department requested and received a 
large piece of steel from the World Trade Cen-
ter. 
That piece sat inside Central Station until 
Conway resident Kevin Bass took it upon him-
self to create a memorial, launching the Citi-
zens for Conway 9–11 Memorial page. 
Thanks to the efforts of the Conway Fire 
Department, Conway city officials, and Mr. 
Bass, that piece of the World Trade Center is 
now a memorial to honor those who lost their 
lives. 
The Searcy Fire Department also was se-
lected by the Port Authority of New York and 
New Jersey to receive an I-beam of steel from 
the World Trade Center. 
The Searcy Fire Department Ladies Auxil-
iary organized a fundraiser to cover the costs 
of that memorial. They had businesses and 
residents in Searcy to sponsor one of 343 
American flags that were placed along the 
Beebe-Capps Expressway. The flags were 
placed on September 11, 2011, and each bore 
a ribbon with the name of a firefighter killed on 
9/11. 
Thanks to the community’s help, the 9/11 
Memorial is a focal point at the Searcy Fire 
Department today. 
Both memorials stand as stark reminders of 
the constant bravery and heroism displayed by 
our nation’s firefighters. 
This year, on the 19th anniversary of Sep-
tember 11, I pray for the families who lost 
loved ones and friends who no longer have 
their companions. 
May their cherished memories of good 
times, laughter, and happiness never fade.

HONORING COLE SAMPSON AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise to ask 
the House of Representatives to join me in 
honoring a dedicated and community-minded 
young man from Cass County for this week’s 
Iowan of the Week. Cole Sampson, now a 
freshman at Iowa State University, was re-
cently honored with the 2020 Silver Cord 
Scholarship in his hometown of Atlantic, Iowa. 
The Silver Cord Program promotes vol-
unteerism with all civic organizations in the 
area. Atlantic High School seniors who volun-
teered a minimum of 200 hours throughout 
their high school career graduated this year 
with a silver cord and were eligible for a schol-
arship provided by the Atlantic Area Chamber 
of Commerce. 
‘‘The Silver Cord program was started to 
educate students about the importance of 
community service. It gives students the op-
portunity to see firsthand how investing their 
time can enhance and grow their community,’’

Bailey Smith, Executive Director of the Atlantic 
Area Chamber of Commerce said. 
Cole volunteered for numerous community 
activities, including Red Cross community 
blood drives, RAGBRAI, AtlanticFest, Coca- 
Cola Days, Christmas in Atlantic Ice-Skating 
Rink, and more. One of his favorite days 
among them was enlisting at a company pic-
nic for a local organization. There, he manned 
bouncy castles and was able to interact with 
a lot of great community members. 
‘‘A big lesson I learned from these experi-
ences was the importance of coordination and 
communication. I saw the many details and all 
the preparation that goes into events like 
these and how it can go smoothly if things are 
well planned and executed. I come from a 
family who believes in volunteering,’’ Cole 
stated. 
Volunteerism is significant to the entire 
Sampson family, Cole’s mother Jackie being 
an encouraging force for Cole to continue vol-
unteering within his community. His grand-
mother, Eleanor Hoover, was also a role 
model for what it means to be a true member 
of the community. 
‘‘My grandmother was always ready to help 
in the community in any way she was able, 
whether it was with sporting competitions, 
YMCA events, or with anyone else who need-
ed a hand,’’ said Cole. 
Maintaining a rural community takes many 
hands and the work is never finished. Atlan-
tic’s Silver Cord Scholarship program is a 
great example of not only how to maintain a 
community, but also how to instill from a 
young age a sense of purpose and pride in 
giving back for the greater good. Because of 
that early engagement and opportunity to 
learn, a young man is carrying important Iowa 
values with him from Atlantic to Ames and be-
yond. I am proud to recognize Cole for his 
dedication to supporting his hometown and 
causes that make a meaningful, local impact. 
I am even prouder knowing there are many 
young people from communities across south-
west Iowa who are carrying that same spirit 
forward as they embark on the next phase. It 
is my honor to share Cole Sampson’s story 
and recognize him as our Iowan of the Week.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF INA 
RAE BURDMAN LEVY 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Ina Rae Burdman Levy, of 
Sarasota, Florida, who passed away peace-
fully Sunday, Aug. 30, 2020, at the age of 91. 
Mrs. Levy was born July 22, 1929, to Harry 
and Doris Burdman, in Youngstown, Ohio. 
Each of her parents immigrated to the United 
States from Russia in the 1920s. Mrs. Levy 
was raised in Youngstown, and in 1957, she 
married the love of her life, Rabbi Theodore S. 
Levy. Together for 48 beautiful years, they 
lived in Huntington, West Virginia, and Water-
bury, Connecticut, and then settled with their 
family in Syracuse, New York, for 30 years. 
After Syracuse they spent 10 years on Hilton 
Head Island, where Rabbi Levy died in 2004. 
Ina Rae moved to Sarasota, Florida and into 
the Sarasota Bay Club, where she enjoyed 
continued community work, new friends and 
being closer to her children and grandchildren. 
Mrs. Levy’s life was full of educational pur-
suits, community involvement, philanthropic 
work, family and travel. Ina Rae Levy earned 
her Bachelor of Science degree in education 
in 1967 and a Master of Science degree in 
family therapy in 1972 from Syracuse Univer-
sity. Her relationship with Syracuse University 
continued throughout the 1970s while she 
worked as an assistant professor and assist-
ant to the dean in the College of Human De-
velopment. Mrs. Levy was involved in innu-
merable local and worldwide organizations 
and received many awards as a result of her 
impact in those organizations. She was vice 
president of the New York State Federations 
of Women’s Clubs and was the first president 
of the Women’s Assembly of Syracuse Jewish 
Federation. Levy was also active in the Na-
tional Federation of Temple Sisterhoods and 
was the president of her district. As a vice 
chair for the World Union for Progressive Ju-
daism, she traveled extensively with her hus-
band, visiting member Reform Congregations 
around the world. While in Syracuse, Mrs. 
Levy was also the president of the prestigious 
Upstate Medical Center. Levy once received 
the Hannah G. Solomon Award from the Na-
tional Council of Jewish Women. 
Mrs. Levy was also tireless in her devotion 
to the equality and advancement of women. 
She was named by the Syracuse Post-Stand-
ard as the Woman of Achievement in Career 
Development in 1972 and again in 1985 she 
was named the Overall Woman of Achieve-
ment. In addition, she was always involved in 
and passionate about Planned Parenthood 
and The League of Women Voters wherever 
she lived. One of Ina Rae’s proudest achieve-
ments was being the only woman invited to 
participate in the first ordination of Rabbis 
since the Holocaust in Dresden, Germany. 
When Mrs. Levy moved to Sarasota, she 
once again became active in her synagogue, 
became an active member of the American 
Jewish Committee (AJC), chairing fundraising 
events in both Sarasota and Tampa. She al-
ways was concerned with the plight of Jews 
around the world. In 2005, Mrs. Levy was in-
strumental in the donation of a Holocaust 
Torah from a synagogue in Youngstown to a 
small synagogue in a small Russian commu-
nity. She regretted not being able to attend the 
Torah dedication herself. 
Despite all of the accolades and achieve-
ments, foremost for Mrs. Levy was her love for 
her family. She had three younger brothers, 
Ronald, B. Richard and Kenneth Burdman, all 
who predeceased her. She leaves behind two 
sisters-in-law, Babette Burdman and Marsha 
Burdman and their families. In addition to her 
children, Seth (and wife, Alice), Cyndi and 
Jonathan (and wife, Karen), she leaves five 
grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren. 
They were all the joys of her life. 
I sincerely thank Mrs. Levy for her years of 
dedicated service and activism. She truly em-
bodied the spirit and grit of the Mahoning Val-
ley. I am proud to be friends with Mrs. Levy’s 
son, Jonathan, and his wife, Karen. My deep-
est condolences go out to Mrs. Levy’s entire 
family, and to all whose lives she touched. 
APPRECIATING BILL RISER 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, the Midlands of South Carolina is 
appreciating the extraordinary service of the 
late Bill Riser, as so well revered by The 
Times and Democrat of Orangeburg on Au-
gust 21, 2020: 
JOHN W. RISER SR. 
WEST COLUMBIA—On Monday, Aug. 17, 2020, 
John William ‘‘Bill’’ Riser Sr., loving hus-
band, father, grandfather and great-grand-
father, passed away at the age of 86 after a 
short illness. 
Bill was born on Jan. 4, 1934, in Bowman, 
to the late Thomas ‘‘Doc’’ Riser Sr. and Nell 
Weathers Riser. He received a BS degree 
from Clemson University in 1957, where he 
played basketball from 1952–56. He was on 
the first Clemson team to play in the first 
ACC Conference in 1954. He worked for the 
Clemson University Extension Service in 
Aiken, Saluda and Richland counties retir-
ing in 1989. In 2015, he was in the first class 
of inductees to be inducted into the A. Frank 
Lever County Extension Agent Hall of Fame 
for service to S.C. and the farming industry. 
Bill also served in the South Carolina 
House of Representatives from 1991–2002 for 
House District No. 69, Lexington County. His 
tenure in the House included effective mem-
bership on the critical Ways and Means Com-
mittee and on the budget subcommittee for 
Higher Education, TECH, and Cultural, as 
well as his vital chairmanship of the legisla-
tive Personnel and Benefits Subcommittee. 
He was also a member of the Agricultural, 
Natural Resources and Environment Affairs 
Committee for four years. 
Bill served his community well, and never 
met a stranger. When he became Richland 
County’s top agent, he became a media star, 
hosting the Early Riser show from 1976–89, 
and was a columnist for The State. A long-
time farmer and extension agent, he never 
refused to share plant and garden tips as he 
traveled the countryside. Bill was a former 
Jaycee, Lion’s Club member, and worked 
with the youth in the 4–H program in Saluda 
County. 
He is survived by his wife of 62 years, 
Peggy Ann Gwinn Riser. They raised three 
children, Deborah A. Riser of Columbia, 
Karen R. Roof (Robert) of Eastover and John 
W. Riser Jr. (Jennifer) of Atlanta; four 
grandchildren, 
Caldwell 
Roof, 
Kirsten 
McClam, Emma Riser and Chloe Riser; as 
well as one great-grandchild, Drakeford 
McClam.

HONORING EMORY ALTIZER

Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Emory Ralph Altizer of Cedar Bluff, 
Virginia, who passed away on August 29 at 
the age of 99. Once recognized as America’s 
oldest coal miner, Mr. Altizer represented the 
strong work ethic, spirit, patriotism, and faith 
that characterize the people of Virginia’s Ninth 
Congressional District whom I am honored to 
serve. 
Mr. Altizer was a native of Tazewell County, 
born on August 12, 1921 to William and Chloe

Day Altizer. He graduated in 1940 from Rich-
lands High School. He began his career in the 
coal mines of Southwest Virginia in the 1930s. 
He told Coal People Magazine in 2007 that 
the first time he entered an underground mine, 
he could stand up in low-seam coal. ‘‘I was 
raised in mining,’’ Mr. Altizer said. ‘‘Don’t know 
why I liked it. I just did.’’ 
Like many of his generation, his life was in-
terrupted by World War II; also like so many, 
he proudly served, manning the tail gun of a 
Martin PBM Mariner flying boat stationed 
aboard the USS Chandeleur. 
After the war, he resumed his career in the 
coal mines, working at a succession of them 
over 68 years. He saw the industry change 
many times, but he remained dedicated to it. 
As he said to Coal People Magazine, ‘‘I’m get-
ting old, I know, and I realize someday I’m 
going to have to quit, but I don’t want to. Don’t 
want any handouts. If I ever thought I couldn’t 
help, I would quit.’’ 
In 2012, when he stopped working in the 
mines at last at the age of 91, he was recog-
nized as America’s oldest coal miner. He met 
then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016, and I 
had the honor to meet Mr. Altizer several 
times as well. 
Mining was important to Mr. Altizer, but it 
wasn’t the only thing. He was a charter mem-
ber of the Richlands Tabernacle and attended 
Belfast Full Gospel Fellowship. He was mar-
ried for 73 years to his wife Lila, and they had 
six children. 
Emory Altizer is survived by Lila, his chil-
dren Danny, Dana, Diane, and Doug, thirteen 
grandchildren, fifteen great-grandchildren, two 
great-great grandchildren, and his brother 
Landon. I would like to offer them my condo-
lences. In a region that takes pride in its coal 
mining heritage, Emory Altizer became a leg-
end.

HONORING CROSSROADS CHURCH 
FOR 
25 
YEARS 
OF 
CHRISTIAN 
MINISTRY 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to 
honor 
my 
home church, Crossroads 
Church, for a quarter century of Christian min-
istry in Concord, North Carolina. I am both 
grateful and proud to be part of this family, 
which continues to grow in membership and 
impact while embracing our mission to create 
a community where people are welcomed 
home, built up, and sent out. 
Crossroads Church first met in 1995 when 
Pastor Lowell McNaney and thirty-five others 
gathered to worship in an office building. We 
inhabited a number of other worship locations, 
including a delicatessen, poolside, and roller 
rink, before making our home on 22 acres of 
land where we offer multiple ministries that 
each day transform lives. Our youth group 
planted a church in Mexico and was the very 
first recipient of the Denman Award for their 
impact in evangelism. 
As we celebrate today, I am reminded of 
Matthew 5:16, ‘‘Let your light so shine before 
men, that they may see your good works, and 
glorify your Father which is in heaven.’’ A 
steward of grace in our community, Cross-
roads has ministered under bridges, at sprawl-
ing cathedrals, and everywhere in-between. 
Crossroads has sent out dozens of medical 
mission teams, disaster relief teams, and 
building teams, and their missions have fed 
tens of thousands of people locally and 
around the world. 
Crossroads has seen countless international 
ministries launch from our body and raised up 
many first-time pastors, missionaries, and 
youth leaders; among them, Capstone Climb-
ing and Adventure, Seekers Aquatic Adven-
ture, Anathon, Nehemiah International Min-
istries, and Elder Orphan Care. 
I would like to extend my most heartfelt ap-
preciation to my good friend, Pastor Lowell 
McNaney, and our entire church family for 25 
years of service and dedication to our commu-
nity. Renee, Lane, and I look forward to the 
next 25 years together. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Crossroads Church for a quarter 
century of Christian ministry in our community 
and across the globe.

HONORING CONGRESSMAN JOHN 
LEWIS 
HON. JIM COOPER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. COOPER. Madam Speaker, it has come 
to my attention my full statement honoring my 
late friend and colleague John Lewis, was not 
included in the RECORD on July 22, 2020; only 
my brief remarks on the House floor were re-
corded. I am resubmitting below my full state-
ment that I prepared for delivery so it may be 
properly reflected in the RECORD: 
No one loved Nashville as much as John 
Lewis. The self-described ‘boy from Troy’ 
Alabama arrived in Nashville on a bus, with 
a ticket purchased by the Rev. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr. Dr. King wanted John to study 
at American Baptist College, one of Nash-
ville’s four legendary HBCUs. For anyone 
wondering how to honor the legacy of John 
Lewis, think of his alma mater, American 
Baptist, or the other justly-famous Nashville 
HBCU he later attended, Fisk University. If 
you want more John Lewis’s in our world, 
those were his beloved training grounds. 
John loved reminiscing about Nashville. 
Once, when John was trying to integrate the 
Krystal restaurant on West End, the man-
ager panicked and locked John inside alone. 
The fire-suppression system was turned on, 
filling the building with gas. John could 
have suffocated but he somehow managed to 
escape unharmed. Yet he never hated the 
manager whose panic could have killed him. 
He understood the man’s fear and tried to 
ease his fear. 
John loved learning non-violence from Dr. 
James Lawson who led seminars, including 
at the Highlander Folk School, about how to 
resist the overwhelming urge to fight back 
during protests despite the taunts, the in-
sults, the cigarette burns, the physical 
blows, and even the broken bones. They prac-
ticed hurting each other so they knew they 
were battle-hardened. The young activists 
knew the danger. They made out their wills 
before joining the Freedom Rides. 
As congressman, John was always kind to 
meet with visitors, interns and staffers from 
Nashville, and even individual families, who 
wanted a moment with the great man, the 
historic figure, the living saint. After the 
meeting, they were starry-eyed, often crying 
from the intensity and purity of the encoun-
ter. John also accepted as many invitations 
as he could to speak in Nashville, once bring-
ing the Faith & Politics pilgrimage to Nash-
ville. 
John made history again with his anti- 
gun-violence protest on the floor of this 
House in 2016. We on the Democratic side 
were honored to follow his leadership, his 
empathy for victims, his impatience with in-
justice, and his moral courage. His friends 
across the aisle could not quite comprehend 
his motivation or his actions, but he forgave 
them anyway. 
Nashville’s 
current 
District 
Attorney, 
Glenn Funk, contacted me a few months ago 
to ask John how he would like his Nashville 
arrest records handled: expungement, apol-
ogy, or even, it sounded like, a ticker-tape 
parade. Much like when I personally wit-
nessed Montgomery’s police chief officially 
apologize to John for his treatment at the 
hands of local authorities, I was happy that 
John was finally being recognized by Nash-
ville, the city he loved, for causing Good 
Trouble, only Good Trouble, just the way his 
mother preferred it, if he had to get in trou-
ble at all. I believe that John was called by 
God to get in Good Trouble and I am thank-
ful that he accepted that call, for the sake of 
us all.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
GRAND 
OPENING 
OF 
THE 
CHEROKEE 
CHARTER ACADEMY 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the grand opening of the 
Cherokee Charter Academy of Gaffney, South 
Carolina. 
The Cherokee Charter Academy offers a 
quality, well-rounded education to students of 
South Carolina cost-free. Their mission is sim-
ple: to be the best educational institution in the 
Upstate developing the next generation of 
American citizens. 
A core belief of the Cherokee Charter Acad-
emy is that a good education is not one-size- 
fits-all. Their commitment to a holistic ap-
proach to learning is rooted in the belief that 
education is best when individual growth is of 
higher priority than judging a student by the 
performance of their peers. The academy rec-
ognizes the importance of a diverse, rigorous 
education for young minds which is why in ad-
dition to core subjects, students have physical 
education and are exposed to either music or 
art class every single day. The Cherokee 
Charter Academy is where kids get to be kids. 
Gaffney will not only be the peach capital of 
South Carolina, but also home to some of the 
brightest students the state has to offer. 
I congratulate the town of Gaffney and 
Cherokee County on their beautiful new ele-
mentary school and the students on the bright 
future ahead of them as the next generation of 
leaders. Go Patriots.

a native of Anderson County, Kentucky and 
worked to desegregate our nation’s armed 
forces during WWII. Today she is honored 
with the renaming of her hometown Main 
Street in her honor. 
Ms. Clarke grew up in Anderson County and 
was a 1937 graduate of Lawrenceburg High 
School. She then furthered her education at 
Kentucky State College where she participated 
in athletics, wrote for the school newspaper, 
and joined Delta Sigma Theta sorority before 
graduating with a bachelor’s degree in soci-
ology and economics in 1941. Following the 
Attack on Pearl Harbor, Ms. Clarke decided to 
join the all-female Women’s Army Auxiliary 
Corps (WAAC). 
Upon completion of WAAC officer training at 
Fort Des Moines, Iowa, Third Officer Anna 
Mac Clarke became the first African-American 
WAAC assigned to a command that was oth-
erwise an all-white unit. Ms. Clarke went on to 
lead a unit of 144 African-American women in 
service at Wakeman General Hospital at 
Camp Atterbury, Indiana before also serving at 
the WAAC Headquarters in Washington, D.C. 
After the WAAC auxiliary units became a part 
of the regular army, Ms. Clarke let the first 
Women’s Army Corps (WAC) unit onto base 
at Douglas Army Air Field in Arizona. When 
she and her unit first arrived, the base was 
segregated. 
However, 
Ms. 
Clarke 
stood 
against this injustice, refused to sit in the col-
ored section, and raised this issue with com-
manding officers. In response, the com-
manding officer issued the following order, 
‘‘Educate properly all enlisted and civilian per-
sonnel in your respective departments to ac-
cept any colored WACs assigned as you 
would any white man or woman in the Army 
of the United States. Every consideration, re-
spect, courtesy, and toleration will be afforded 
every colored WAC. No discrimination will be 
condoned.’’ 
Ms. Anna Mac Clarke sadly passed away 
on April 19, 1944 at the age of 24 following 
complications from surgery. Yet, her steadfast 
contributions to the desegregation of our 
armed forces serve as an extraordinary exam-
ple of courage and patriotism in service to 
one’s country. It is my honor to recognize Ms. 
Clarke, as a street is renamed today in her 
honor in her hometown of Lawrenceburg, Ken-
tucky. I am forever grateful for brave Ameri-
cans like Anna Mac Clarke.

CONGRATULATING 
MS. 
JAILENE 
FRANCOIS FOR WINNING THE 2020 
CONGRESSIONAL ART COMPETI-
TION IN FLORIDA’S 20TH CON-
GRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Ms. Jailene Francois for 
submitting the winning entry in the 2020 Con-
gressional Art Competition for Florida’s 20th 
Congressional District. Jailene is a 10th grader 
at Millennium 6–12 Collegiate Academy in 
Tamarac, Florida. Her photograph, entitled 
‘‘Oppression,’’ 
represents 
the 
oppression 
faced by people of color in America. The piece 
features a black and white photograph of a 
small African-American girl, crying, with a 
white X across her lips. 
Typically, we would recognize and congratu-
late young artists from Congressional Districts 
throughout the United States with a celebra-
tion here in the Capitol. This year is anything 
but typical. The COVID–19 pandemic has 
forced millions of American to cancel or post-
pone their celebrations and we in Congress 
are not exempt. 
Madam Speaker, I take great pride in hon-
oring Jailene for her inspiring art work, which 
will be displayed on Capitol Hill for the next 
year.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF PAUL 
DEBOLT) 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of Paul DeBolt 
upon his retirement as an educator in Contra 
Costa County after forty years. 
A West Contra Costa native and graduate of 
De Anza High School in Richmond, Paul at-
tended Contra Costa College before transfer-
ring to San Diego State University, where he 
was a walk-on member of the Aztecs’ basket-
ball team. It was during this pursuit of his pas-
sion for basketball that Paul discovered an-
other passion in journalism. He graduated with 
a degree in journalism in 1977 and earned a 
Master’s Degree in mass communications 
from San Diego State in 1980. 
After completing his education, Paul re-
turned to Contra Costa College, teaching jour-
nalism and advising the student newspaper. In 
the classroom, he introduced Contra Costa’s 
diverse student population to the basics of 
journalism. Through his tutelage and practical 
experience, students learned the value that 
quality, accurate reporting can have on com-
munities across the country. Paul even count-
ed among his students his own son David, 
who would eventually go on to win a Pulitzer 
Prize for his role in reporting on Oakland’s 
Ghost Ship Fire. 
In 1986, Paul started a women’s basketball 
team at Contra Costa College. By the time he 
stepped down in 2016, he had led the Comets 
to 11 Bay Valley Conference titles, four visits 
to California’s final eight, three trips to the final 
four, and two visits to the state championship. 
Following the state championship game in 
2001, Paul was named the California Commu-
nity College Women’s Basketball Association 
Coach of the Year. 
Paul’s work in the classroom and on the 
court has impacted the lives of countless stu-
dents and athletes at Contra Costa College. 
As he retires from Contra Costa College, we 
wish Paul well knowing that his legacy will 
continue to inspire all those who have known 
and worked with him. 
REMEMBERING STAFF SERGEANT 
VINCENT MARKETTA 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
memory of Staff Sergeant Vincent P. Marketta 
of Brick, New Jersey, who tragically passed 
away following an accident while conducting 
aviation training with this Regiment. He was 
just 33 years old. 
Staff Sergeant Marketta enlisted in the U.S. 
Army in 2011 as a 15T UH–60 ‘‘Black Hawk’’ 
Repairer, and was assigned to the 160th Spe-
cial Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). 
While assigned to the 160th SOAR, he was 
deployed to Afghanistan in support of Oper-
ation Enduring Freedom, and deployed mul-
tiple times to Iraq in support of Operation In-
herent Resolve. During his service, Staff Ser-
geant Marketta was awarded the Distin-
guished Flying Cross, an Air Medal with V De-
vice for heroism against an armed enemy, and 
an Army Commendation Medal with C Device. 
Staff Sergeant Marketta represents the kind 
of uncommon courage and sacrifice that de-
fines our service members and their families. 
Vincent was a loyal and dedicated member of 
his family and community and served bravely 
alongside his Regiment in defending our na-
tion abroad. His passing is a tragedy that is 
felt in Brick, and across the State of New Jer-
sey. 
The immense sacrifice that Vincent and his 
family have made in service to our country is 
a reminder to all of us in Congress that we are 
here serving something greater than our-
selves. My heart goes out to Staff Sergeant 
Marketta’s family, and the entire Brick commu-
nity during this incredibly difficult time. Vincent 
Marketta’s dedication and service to our coun-
try will not be forgotten.

TRIBUTE TO DR. FRENCH HARMON 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to my long-time 
friend and pastor, Dr. French Harmon, who 
has been elected to lead the Kentucky Baptist 
Foundation. 
During a time of great unrest in our nation, 
the church remains our guiding light as an in-
visible enemy attacks the health of Americans, 
our economy, and our way of life. It is spiritual 
leaders like Dr. Harmon who will ensure that 
our sovereign God is still recognized as the 
cornerstone of our blessed and sovereign na-
tion. 
His servant’s heart has never been resigned 
to ministry inside a building. Rather, Dr. Har-
mon has embodied the love of Christ through 
his outreach in every community where he has 
resided, and through mission work in foreign 
countries, including Brazil, Israel, Kenya, and 
South Africa. Successful ministries are often 
defined by congregation size, tithing growth 
and doctoral achievements; to that end, Dr. 
Harmon is among the elite as a Doctor of Phi-
losophy, a Doctor of Ministry, a Master of The-
ology, a Master of Divinity and upwards of

200% growth in church membership and giv-
ing throughout his pastoral assignments. How-
ever, it is with great humility that Dr. Harmon 
would suggest that there is no greater success 
in ministry than simply sharing the gospel of 
Christ to a lost world in need of a Savior. As 
a member of his congregation at First Baptist 
Church in Somerset, Kentucky, I can person-
ally attest that countless lives have changed 
as a result of his dedication to Christ’s Great 
Commission. 
In recent years, Dr. Harmon has been a 
consummate advocate for the needs of the 
people of southern and eastern Kentucky. He 
organized an anti-drug abuse march and rally 
in partnership with Operation UNITE to com-
bat the opioid abuse epidemic in our Appa-
lachian region. I recruited him to share his 
wisdom and expertise as a board member, 
and now Vice Chair, of SOAR—Shaping Our 
Appalachian Region, an initiative to revitalize 
and diversify our coal-producing region. I 
deeply appreciate his ingenuity and guidance 
as we collectively work to inspire and generate 
new economic development opportunities in 
the mountains. 
In addition to serving as my pastor, I count 
Dr. Harmon as a true friend and trusted advi-
sor. In fact, I invited him to lead prayer on 
Capitol Hill for the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and to join me during meetings with 
prominent leaders over the years, including 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He 
has been a tremendous ambassador for the 
United States, the Commonwealth of Kentucky 
and the City of Somerset. 
For those reasons, I find it bittersweet to 
congratulate Dr. Harmon as he begins a new 
chapter as President of the Kentucky Baptist 
Foundation. My prayer for Dr. Harmon and his 
family is written in Numbers 6:24–26, ‘‘The 
Lord bless you and keep you; the Lord make 
his face shine upon you and be gracious to 
you; the Lord turn his face toward you and 
give you peace.’’

HONORING SIG SANCHEZ 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate Sig San-
chez on his upcoming 100th birthday. 
Sig was born in Hollister, California as the 
second eldest of eleven children. Raised by 
his Spanish immigrant parents on his family 
farm, he would eventually have his own farm 
before entering public service. 
In our community, Sig is well known as a 
pillar of the community and champion of south 
Santa Clara County. Seven years ago, I rose 
to honor Sig’s accomplishments and thank him 
for his dedication to our community. He spent 
over 55 years in public service before retiring, 
spending numerous years as a Gilroy City 
Councilmember and Mayor, before becoming 
a Santa Clara County Supervisor, and then 
joining as a Valley Water Board Director. He 
was a key player in the merger of water dis-
tricts that allowed for full integration of all the 
county’s reservoirs and groundwater facilities, 
as well as many other important projects. Sig 
guided the community through the floods in 
the 1980s and the 1987 drought. 
Sig’s impact and influence is well docu-
mented in our community. He has been in-
ducted into the Gilroy Hall of Fame and was 
named Man of the Year by Gilroy’s Chamber 
of Commerce in 2013. Even a portion of High-
way 101 is named after him. 
We are thankful for his many years of serv-
ice and his presence in our community. Along 
with his family and friends, I extend my best 
wishes and heartfelt congratulations to Sig on 
his 100th birthday.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
BILLIE DEAN 
HON. VAL BUTLER DEMINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of City of Apopka 
Commissioner, Billie Dean. Commissioner 
Dean passed away on Saturday, September 
5, 2020, but his life of service will continue to 
make a difference in the lives of others for 
decades to come. 
Mr. Dean proudly served in the U.S. Army 
during the Korean War, earning the Bronze 
Star for his heroism on the battlefield. 
After his military service, Commissioner 
Dean attended Florida Agricultural and Me-
chanical University and received a master’s 
degree in Agriculture. Commissioner Dean 
was a proud, ‘‘rattler’’ and everyone knew it! 
He was one of the most enthusiastic alumnus 
and served as an inspiration to young adults 
in college or preparing for the journey. Com-
missioner Dean had a long-standing career 
spanning 38 years as an agriculture teacher at 
both Phyllis Wheatley High School and 
Apopka High School. He fully understood that 
education was the key to success, and he 
committed to ensuring that his students were 
prepared for the future. 
Billie Dean loved Apopka and he was willing 
to do the work necessary to make the place 
he called home a great place to live, work, 
and visit. After retiring from the school system, 
he was elected to the Apopka City Commis-
sion. A visionary with a powerful voice, Com-
missioner Dean worked tirelessly to revitalize 
South Apopka by creating state of the art fa-
cilities, enhancing affordable housing opportu-
nities, and increasing public safety. 
Commissioner Dean served on the city com-
mission with honor and distinction for 24 years 
before retiring as the Vice Mayor. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Dean was a true pub-
lic servant. His unselfish service to his country 
and community has truly made a positive dif-
ference in the city of Apopka, in the State of 
Florida, and the United States of America. We 
are grateful for a life well lived.

IN RECOGNITION OF MARSHALL J. 
HUNT 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Marshall J. Hunt’s many con-
tributions to the communities of Wayne Coun-
ty, Michigan and statewide, particularly his 
nearly four decades of service to Accounting 
Aid Society, one of southeast Michigan’s larg-
est Volunteer Income Tax Assistance non- 
profit organizations. 
A Certified Public Accountant for more than 
fifty years, Marshall Hunt accumulated more 
than thirty years of federal service to the Inter-
nal Revenue Service (IRS) and in tax adminis-
tration before joining the team at Accounting 
Aid Society. Mr. Hunt possesses a wealth of 
knowledge and expertise on income tax issues 
and tax code. More importantly, Marshall Hunt 
recognizes the need for financial and income 
tax services in metropolitan Detroit’s most vul-
nerable communities. 
As director of Accounting Aid’s income tax 
program, Mr. Hunt has been instrumental in 
the organization’s growth to provide free in-
come tax preparation at multiple locations 
throughout southeast Michigan, including mo-
bile pop-up sites. This work is vital in putting 
deserved dollars in the form of income tax re-
funds back into the pockets of the people who 
need it most. 
Beyond his work with Accounting Aid Soci-
ety, Marshall Hunt is an educator. He teaches 
accounting at University of Michigan Dearborn 
and is instrumental in Accounting Aid’s volun-
teer income tax preparers’ education each 
year. In addition, he has served on the Inter-
nal Revenue Service Advisory Council. He is 
a member of the Michigan Department of 
Treasury Individual Tax Advisory Group, the 
Tax Practice and Procedures Committee of 
the American Institute of CPAs, and the Steer-
ing Committee of the Taxpayer Opportunity 
Network. Mr. Hunt is also active in the Michi-
gan Association of CPAs and is a member of 
the Board of Directors of the Old Newsboys’ 
Goodfellow Fund of Detroit. 
Please join me in recognizing Marshall 
Hunt’s numerous outstanding contributions 
and his thirty-nine years of service to Account-
ing Aid Society.

HONORING JOANI MOLLER AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, September is 
National Suicide Prevention month. In light of 
this, I rise to ask the House of Representa-
tives to join me in recognizing Joani Moller, 
the Area Director for the Iowa Chapter of 
American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, 
as our Iowan of the Week. 
In Iowa, one person dies by suicide every 
18 hours. It is the second leading cause of 
death amongst people ages 15–34 and is the 
ninth leading cause of death in the state over-
all. Iowa finds itself in a particularly concerning 
situation as farmers remain at highest risk of 
death by suicide. And as we continue to see 
the effects of isolation during the COVID–19 
pandemic on mental health across the board, 
suicide rates are an immediate concern. 
Thankfully, we have people like Joani Moller 
dedicated to the mission of eliminating sui-
cides in Iowa. After 20 years of non-profit 
work, Joani became Area Director of the 
American Foundation of Suicide Prevention 
(AFSP) Iowa Chapter just over a year ago. In

the short time since, she has managed to 
build their board, collaborate with new commu-
nity organizations to support their suicide 
awareness and fundraising events, and build 
coalitions with other suicide prevention organi-
zations in Polk County. She is inspired by her 
volunteers’ dedication to the mission of AFSP 
and the stories they share with her. ‘‘When I 
started for AFSP, it was shocking to me how 
many people’s lives have been touched by 
suicide,’’ said Joani. At the age of 18, she too 
experienced the loss of her boyfriend when he 
took his life. 
American Foundation for Suicide Prevention 
in Iowa is a grassroots organization that fo-
cuses on eliminating death by suicide through 
programming, events, and providing vital re-
sources to Iowans in need. 
Their programs educate people from dif-
ferent backgrounds about the risk factors and 
warning signs of suicide. They also work hard 
to raise much-needed funds for research and 
programs that provide support to people who 
have lost individuals to suicide. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, AFSP’s 
Iowa Chapters have successfully transitioned 
their in-person programming to virtual offer-
ings, providing over 500 presentations in just 
four months. They have also created an addi-
tional program: Enhancing Mental Health dur-
ing COVID–19. 
Preventing suicides is no small task. Joani 
believes that continuing to have conversations 
is a critical part of suicide prevention as it 
destigmatizes the topic and makes people 
more comfortable confronting it. As new obsta-
cles continue to present themselves during 
this pandemic, we are fortunate and grateful to 
have people like her running vital organiza-
tions in Iowa. While Joani humbly credits the 
success of AFSP to her volunteers, we know 
it would not be the organization that it is today 
without her dedication towards its success and 
the elimination of suicide in the state of Iowa. 
It is my honor to recognize Joani Moller as 
our Iowan of the Week. I will continue to work 
in Congress to ensure everyone has access to 
accessible and affordable health and mental 
health care so that Joani’s goal of zero sui-
cides becomes a reality.

RECOGNIZING 
HOWARD 
BERRY’S 
TIRELESS ADVOCACY FOR VET-
ERANS 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I am 
honored to recognize Mr. Howard Berry of 
Cincinnati, Ohio, who passed away on June 
17, 2020, for his tireless advocacy for vet-
erans of the United States Armed Forces. 
After tragically losing his son, Joshua, a 
U.S. Army veteran, to suicide, Mr. Berry dedi-
cated himself to veteran mental health issues 
and veteran suicide. His advocacy throughout 
Greater Cincinnati led to expanded resources 
and programs for veterans experiencing post- 
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Recognizing a serious problem, Mr. Berry 
started Flags for Forgotten Soldiers, which 
placed American flags on the graves of 
servicemembers who died from suicide to 
honor their service. Flags for Forgotten Sol-
diers has now been replicated in 32 other 
states. 
Mr. Berry was passionately committed to 
raising awareness about veteran suicide, and 
in February 2020, Ohio became the first state 
in the nation to dedicate a highway and recog-
nize veteran suicide in that way. 
I thank Howard for his commitment to draw-
ing greater attention to this issue and pro-
viding better resources and care for our na-
tion’s brave and deserving veterans. Our com-
munity is grateful for his many years of advo-
cacy and contribution.

Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Brian Patrick O’Donnell, of 
Akron, Ohio, who passed away on September 
1, 2020. 
Born in Altoona, PA, Brian lived most of his 
life in Akron, Ohio. He was a diehard Cleve-
land Indians and Cleveland Browns fan and 
loved fishing, especially with his grandchildren. 
Brian was an amazing baseball player him-
self, playing for his high school alma mater, 
South High School in Akron. Mr. O’Donnell 
loved spending time with his family and duti-
fully served our country in the United States 
Army. After leaving the Army, Brian worked for 
the Finest, Tops, and Giant Eagle food chains 
for over 30 years. 
Brian was preceded in death by his grand-
mother, Grandma Burks: brother Leon (Lee) 
Jones, Jr.; mother-in-law, Ruth Mosley; broth-
ers-in-law, Robert Mosley and Roger Mosley, 
Sr. 
Brian leaves to cherish his life and legacy, 
the love of his life, Velze (Mosley) O’Donnell, 
his wife of 42 years; children: Camilla (Frank-
lin) Lewis, Tara Mosley Samples, Gordon

cerest thanks to Mr. O’Donnell for his brave

INTRODUCTION OF THE FRANCIS 
G. 
NEWLANDS 
MEMORIAL 
RE-
MOVAL ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the Francis G. Newlands Me-
morial Removal Act. This bill would remove 
the plaque and inscription bearing Francis G. 
Newlands’ name from Chevy Chase Circle, a 
federal park located both in the District of Co-
lumbia and Maryland. I am pleased that Rep-
resentative JAMIE RASKIN joins me in intro-
ducing this bill. 
Newlands was a U.S. senator from Nevada, 
a conservationist and the founder of the 
Chevy Chase Land Company, which devel-
oped the Chevy Chase neighborhood that 
touches D.C. and Maryland. Newlands was 
also a segregationist. He built Connecticut Av-
enue and dedicated it to D.C., and ran a 
streetcar up the road to the newly built Chevy 
Chase Lake. However, homes on Connecticut 
Avenue were purposely priced to keep work-
ing families out, and covenants were later 
added to many of the property deeds in Chevy 
Chase explicitly prohibiting the land from ever 
being owned by African Americans or Jews. 
These covenants have since been declared 
void. He also used his conservationism as a 
way to keep Black and white Americans sepa-
rate. In the late 1800s, he and Senator William 
Stewart secured 2,000 acres of land for Rock 
Creek Park. Establishing this park not only in-
creased property values for landowners like 
Stewart and Newlands, but also kept white 
communities distinct from emerging Black 
communities on what they called the ‘‘wrong 
side of the park.’’ Newlands’ racist views went 
even further. In 1912, he called for the repeal 
the 15th amendment, which gave African 
American men the right to vote. 
The fountain was established in 1932 by 
Congress. In 1990, the Chevy Chase Land 
Company also added the plaque next to the 
fountain. My bill would remove Newlands’ 
name from the fountain and remove the 
plaque entirely. A resolution to remove 
Newlands’ name from the fountain was first in-
troduced by the Chevy Chase Advisory Neigh-
borhood Commission in 2014, and on July 27, 
2020, the Commission voted unanimously to 
ask the National Park Service to remove the 
bronze plaque bearing Newlands’ name and to 
begin discussion on a new name for the foun-
tain. My legislation would gift both the plaque 
and 
the 
inscription 
on 
the 
fountain 
to 
Newlands’ descendants. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

when returning to the water to save the third 
child, Manjit was swept away. He was just 29 
years old.

Gurdaspur District of Punjab. He came from a 
small farming family and was dedicated to his 
family, neighbors, and community. He came to 
the United States in 2018 seeking economic 
opportunities and religious freedom with hopes 
to support his family in Punjab. He fell in love 
with the Central Valley community and was 
eager to build roots and become locally in-
volved. 
Throughout the local Sikh community, he 
was known for his community service, gen-
erosity, caring-nature, jovial personality, and 
infectious laugh. He had inspiration and the 
entrepreneurial drive to start his own trucking 
company. 
In a time where we have seen too much 
selfishness and hatred, Manjit’s actions should 
always be remembered. Madam Speaker, I 
ask my colleagues to join us in a moment of 
silence to honor the sacrifice of Mr. Manjit 
Singh. Manjit will be missed by all his loved 
ones and our community will mourn the loss of 
this noble hero.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
PANDORA 
NASH- 
KARNER—CALIFORNIA’S 
24TH 
CONGRESSIONAL WOMEN OF THE 
YEAR 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, each 
year, through the Women of the Year Award, 
my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year 
Award recipient, Pandora Nash-Karner of Los 
Osos, California. 
Pandora has been a consistent, positive 
force in Los Osos and San Luis Obispo. She 
was elected to serve on the Los Osos Com-
munity Service District Board when it was 
formed in 1998 and chaired its Wastewater 
and Park Committees. She has also served on 
the San Luis Obispo County Parks and Recre-
ation Commission (PRC) as a Parks Commis-
sioner since 1991, where she continuously ad-
vocates for parks and public open space for 
our community. 
Pandora is the force behind Celebrate Los 
Osos, a 501 (c)(3) that utilizes volunteers to 
plant, paint, beautify, build, repair, refurbish, 
and maintain projects in order to stimulate 
community pride and leave a legacy for all to 
enjoy. She has been recognized for this work 
as Los Osos Citizen of the Year, Woman of 
the Year, Kiwanian of the Year, San Luis 
Obispo County Volunteer of the Year and re-
ceived the Mary Rhode Award from the 
League of Women Voters. 
Those who know Pandora describe her as 
someone who shares herself as a person and 
role model. She has motivated countless com-
munity members to get involved, which has 
served as inspiration for exceptional projects 
and an abundance of good will. Our commu-
nity is tremendously lucky to count her as a 
friend and neighbor. Pandora’s tireless service 
to our district makes her someone who all 
young women and men can look up to with 
admiration. 
I ask all Members to join me today in hon-
oring an exceptional woman of California’s 
24th Congressional District, Pandora Nash- 
Karner, for her incredible service to her com-
munity.

Ex-

H.R. 2694 would require all public-sector 
employers and any private-sector employers 
with more than 15 workers to make reason-
able accommodations for the known limita-
tions related to pregnancy, childbirth, or re-
lated medical conditions of employees and 
job applicants.1 The bill would not require 
employers to make any accommodation that 
would impose an undue hardship on business 
operations. Under the bill, the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) 
would be required to issue regulations to im-
plement the bill within two years of enact-
ment. 
Using information from the EEOC, CBO ex-
pects that for the first three years after the 
regulations are issued, the EEOC would re-
ceive roughly 500 more claims related to 
pregnancy discrimination (an increase of 
about 20 percent) each year. (The EEOC ex-
pects that after three years, the number of 
pregnancy discrimination claims would re-
turn to prior levels as employers comply 
with the new regulations.) To meet that 
workload, CBO estimates that the commis-
sion would need seven additional employees, 
at a cost of about $3 million over the 2021– 
2025 period. Such spending would be subject 
to the availability of appropriated funds. For 
fiscal year 2020, the Congress appropriated 
about $390 million for all of the EEOC’s oper-
ations. 
Enacting the bill could affect direct spend-
ing by some agencies that are allowed to use 
fees, receipts from the sale of goods, and 
other collections to cover operating costs. 
CBO estimates that any net changes in di-
rect spending by those agencies would be 
negligible because most of them can adjust 
amounts collected to reflect changes in oper-
ating costs. 
CBO has not reviewed H.R. 2694 for inter-
governmental or private-sector mandates. 
Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform 
Act excludes from the application of that act 
any legislative provisions that would estab-
lish or enforce statutory rights prohibiting 
discrimination. CBO has determined that the 
bill falls within that exclusion because it 
would extend protections against discrimina-
tion in the workplace based on sex to em-
ployees requesting reasonable accommoda-
tion for pregnancy, childbirth, or related 
medical conditions. 
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate 
are Sofia Guo (for federal costs) and Lilia 
Ledezma (for mandates). The estimate was 
reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy 
Director of Budget Analysis. 
1 Current law provides protections to preg-
nant workers who are denied reasonable ac-
commodations by their employers. However, 
the Supreme Court has ruled that a pregnant 
worker may bring a claim against an em-
ployer only if the petitioner can demonstrate 
that the employer has provided accommoda-
tions to workers with similar limitations 
who are not pregnant (Young v. United Parcel 
Service, Inc., 575 U.S. 12, 1226 (2015). https:// 
go.usa.gov/xG4jx, PDF, 230 KB). H.R. 2694 
would allow pregnant workers to bring such 
claims without meeting that requirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT 
CAMPBELL 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and service of Rob-
ert ‘‘Bob’’ Campbell. 
Born in Southern California, Bob moved at 
a young age with his family to Richmond, Cali-
fornia, where he grew up in a World War II 
housing development known as Atchison Vil-
lage. After high school, he attended Contra 
Costa Community College and graduated from 
San Francisco State University. Bob went on 
to receive a Master’s Degree in history from 
UC Berkeley and serve in both the U.S. Army 
and California National Guard. 
As a dedicated member of the community, 
Bob was elected to the Richmond City Council 
in 1975. In 1980, he was elected to the Cali-
fornia State Assembly, where he represented 
District 11—the same district I represented. 
Bob served in the California Legislature for 16

years, during which time he was the chair of 
the State Assembly’s Ways and Means sub-
committee on education. 
After his time in the Assembly, Bob was ap-
pointed to the California Coastal Commission, 
where he continued to work tirelessly on be-
half of his community and our state. Bob is re-
membered by his colleagues as a passionate, 
energetic, and humble civic leader who 
prioritized connecting with the individuals he 
represented, especially those needed help the 
most. 
Later in Bob’s career, he continued to lobby 
in Sacramento and worked as a consultant for 
school and college districts. He is also remem-
bered as a member of the local business com-
munity, having been an insurance broker and 
owning a brokerage company in Richmond. 
Sadly Bob passed away this year. He is sur-
vived by his wife, former Richmond City 
Councilmember Maria Viramontes. Please join 
me in honoring Bob Campbell for his many 
contributions to our community and the state 
of California. Bob was a cherished member of 
Contra Costa County and he will be missed.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
AHMADIYYA 
MUSLIM 
COMMUNITY’S 
CON-
TRIBUTIONS TO SOCIETY 
HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the important work of the 
Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Specifically, I 
want to recognize the important partnership 
between the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community 
and the Red Cross, as well as congratulate 
them on celebrating their Centennial in the 
United States. 
For the past 10 years, the Ahmadiyya Mus-
lim Community and the Red Cross have 
teamed up to host the ‘‘Muslims for Life’’ 
Blood Drive Campaign to remember the lives 
lost on 9/11. I am proud to work alongside the 
dedicated members of this community as they 
push to spread the message of peace and 
global unity. It is through their message of reli-
gious tolerance and freedom where we can 
truly bring people together in peaceful har-
mony. 
It is through actions like that I stand as a 
proud member of the bi-partisan Congres-
sional Ahmadiyya Muslim Caucus, which 
works with the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community 
to protect religious freedom and fight against 
religious intolerance. 
Through the work in the Caucus, I have 
been fortunate to meet His Holiness Mirza 
Masroor Ahmad, who serves as the fifth 
Khalifa of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. 
As the spiritual leader of the community, his 
message of global peace and devotion to 
human rights radiates to his millions of mem-
bers around the world. 
As we persevere in the movement for 
human rights and religious tolerance across 
the globe, I am grateful to continue this part-
nership with the Ahmadiyya Muslim Commu-
nity and thank them for their positive work in 
our communities. 
HOPE AND HEALTH EQUITY FOR 
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR 
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, nearly six 
months have passed since the novel corona 
virus 2019 (COVID–19) was declared a public 
health emergency in the United States. At this 
moment in time, we have seen over 192,000 
deaths nationwide due to COVID–19, with a 
disproportionate share of those impacted 
being Black and African American and His-
panic and Latino Americans. 
The disparity in the number of cases, hos-
pitalizations, and deaths is stunning. The rate 
of COVID–19 cases in Black and African 
American or Hispanic and Latino Americans 
are 2.6 times and 2.8 times, respectively, 
greater than white Americans. Black and Afri-
can American patients are dying at 2.4 times 
the rate of white Americans. Hispanic or 
Latino Americans are hospitalized at 4.6 times 
the rate of white Americans. We can quantify 
this disparity by the incidence and prevalence 
of this disease by race and ethnicity, but we 
have a responsibility to understand how these 
disparities are rooted and linked to social de-
terminants of health already present in minor-
ity and underserved communities that com-
pound the disproportionate impact of COVID– 
19. 
In New York’s 13th Congressional District, 
we have seen the disproportionate impact of 
this disease in all parts of our community from 
Harlem to Washington Heights to Inwood and 
into the Bronx. In our community we have 
dedicated health care providers—extraordinary 
professionals of all backgrounds, experience, 
and expertise—who have gone to extraor-
dinary lengths to care for COVID–19 patients. 
Among these health care heroes are groups 
like SOMOS Community Care and the Visiting 
Nurse Service of New York who have dem-
onstrated incredible agility in caring for their 
patients who are most vulnerable and in need. 
They understand how patient care and inter-
ventions need can best be tailored to meet the 
challenge of COVID–19 or otherwise in the 
hospital, clinic, and home settings. This is a 
tremendous benefit for the patient and their 
family members, and I am grateful for the 
work they continue to provide especially in 
providing palliative and hospice care. These 
are fields of care that we may not often think 
about until the moment that we or a loved one 
need this care the most. But these are impor-
tant tools that we must utilize in order to ad-
dress social determinants of health as we 
move towards better outcomes and quality of 
life for patients. 
In these past six months, we have learned 
a great deal about this COVID–19 disease 
and best practices to care for vulnerable popu-
lations in underserved communities. The Vis-
iting Nurse Service of New York PROJECT 
HOPE Physicians and Health Leaders’ Sum-
mit is a great opportunity to share what we 
have seen and learned through this pandemic 
and apply the best practices towards imme-
diate and future health care planning and de-
livery. As this group of health care profes-
sionals convenes, I join in their Day of HOPE 
and Equity for Communities of Color in New 
York and reject the premise that one’s zip 
code defines their life span and health. 
HONORING AL MAGGINI 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Al Maggini 
in celebration of his 105th birthday on Sep-
tember 5, 2020. 
Mr. Maggini was born and raised in San 
Francisco, California. After graduating from St. 
Ignatius College Preparatory in 1933, he 
began his career in the financial industry. At 
the onset of World War II, Mr. Maggini put his 
career on pause to join the United States 
Army Air Corps as a B–17 aerial navigator in 
the Eighth Air Force. After the war, Mr. 
Maggini returned to San Francisco to continue 
his career as a stockbroker before moving to 
Santa Rosa in 1965. 
After moving to Santa Rosa, Mr. Maggini 
joined the faculty of Santa Rosa Junior Col-
lege to teach night classes, including a course 
on flying to returning soldiers and a basic fi-
nance class. After more than eleven years of 
teaching, he was invited to serve on the Santa 
Rosa Junior College’s board of trustees. Dur-
ing his 33-year tenure as a trustee, he helped 
guide the board through many difficult deci-
sions by urging his fellow trustees to consider 
what is in the best interest of the students that 
they serve. 
Mr. Maggini’s service to his community ex-
tends beyond his time at Santa Rosa Junior 
College. He has dedicated his time and en-
ergy to ensure the health and quality of life of 
his fellow community members, both through 
his efforts to fundraiser for Santa Rosa Memo-
rial Hospital and through his endowment of the 
Al and Helen Maggini Legacy. In 2018, he 
was presented with the Frank P. Doyle Philan-
thropy Award, which honors local business 
leaders who use their time, money, and en-
ergy to help meet critical community needs. 
Madam Speaker, Al Maggini is the kind of 
community member we should all strive to be. 
His life has been dedicated to serving the peo-
ple around him, from his time in the Army to 
his work in Santa Rosa. It is therefore fitting 
and proper that we honor him here today.

HONORING COLONEL AARON W.

Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I am 
grateful for the opportunity to honor Colonel 
Aaron W. Reisinger, Commander and District 
Engineer of the United States Army Corps of 
Engineers 
(USACE)—Chicago 
District. 
Throughout his command, Colonel Reisinger’s 
dedication and steadfast leadership has prov-
en worthy of the highest praise. Colonel 
Reisinger will relinquish his command to Colo-
nel Paul B. Culberson at a change of com-
mand ceremony on September 18, 2020, in 
Chicago, Illinois. 
In 1994, Colonel Reisinger graduated from 
the United States Military Academy with a de-
gree in mechanical engineering. He went on to 
earn a master’s degree in engineer manage-
ment from the University of Missouri at Rolla

and a master’s degree in public policy from 
Georgetown University. In addition, he is a 
distinguished graduate of the United States 
Naval War College where he earned a mas-
ter’s degree in National Security and Strategic 
Studies. 
Colonel Reisinger’s lifetime of service to the 
United States Army and to the citizens of our 
great country is to be highly commended. The 
Colonel served as a platoon leader and exec-
utive officer in the 14th Engineer Battalion 
from 1994 to 1998. From 2000 to 2002, he 
was a company commander in the 299th Engi-
neer Battalion at Fort Hood, Texas. Later, 
from 2012 to 2014, Colonel Reisinger com-
manded the 84th Engineer Battalion at 
Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. In addition, he has 
served as a trainer at the National Training 
Center in Fort Irwin, California, an action offi-
cer for the Joint Staff, Plans and Strategy 
within the Deputy Directorate for the War on 
Terrorism, as military transition team chief 
within an Iraqi infantry battalion, operations of-
ficer in the 65th Engineer Battalion and 130th 
Engineer Brigade, and chief of operations for 
the 8th Theater Sustainment Command. He 
also completed two combat deployments to 
Iraq and one operational deployment in the 
South Pacific. 
For 
his 
distinguished 
service, 
Colonel 
Reisinger is the recipient of two Bronze Star 
Medals, three Meritorious Service Medals, two 
Joint Service Commendation Medals, two 
Army Commendation Medals, one Joint Serv-
ice Achievement Medal, five Army Achieve-
ment Medals, a Meritorious Unit Commenda-
tion, and multiple Iraq campaign stars. 
Colonel Reisinger assumed command of the 
USACE-Chicago District in 2017. During his 
time as District Commander in Chicago, his 
leadership has played an integral role in the 
agency’s accomplishments, most notably in 
Northwest Indiana. In partnership with local 
municipalities, the USACE implemented more 
than $14 million in stormwater and sanitary 
sewer infrastructure projects designed to im-
prove water quality throughout the region and 
ultimately improve the quality of life and place 
in these communities. Colonel Reisinger’s 
command saw the completion of the Little Cal-
umet River Flood Control and Recreation 
Project, protecting residents from the dev-
astating effects of flooding and providing the 
opportunity for increased economic develop-
ment. Dredging continues within the Indiana 
Harbor Ship Canal to remove contaminated 
sediment and to restore its navigable depth, 
benefitting local industry as the improvements 
within the canal allow industrial users to in-
crease efficacy in shipping along the Great 
Lakes. 
As our country continues to grapple with the 
uncertainty and strain of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, I would be remiss for not praising Colo-
nel Reisinger for his dedicated effort this 
spring to coordinate the large-scale operation 
to convert Chicago’s McCormick Place Con-
vention Center into an alternative care facility. 
Finally, I would like to offer my deep appre-
ciation for his efforts, alongside officials at the 
Division and HQ, to successfully complete the 
realignment and expansion of Chicago District 
in the last few months, ensuring continued 
mission stability and the long-term partnership 
between the Corps and our local communities. 
These projects and others stand testament to 
Colonel 
Reisinger’s 
commitment 
to 
the 
USACE’s mission to work with its partners to 
energize the nation’s economy through its civil 
works projects and to respond to the toughest 
challenges. I am grateful for his generosity of 
spirit, his meticulous work ethic, and his dedi-
cated life of service. 
Madam Speaker, Colonel Reisinger has 
selflessly served his country and his fellow 
Americans, and he has been unwavering in 
his leadership and commitment to our great 
country. I respectfully ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in hon-
oring Colonel Aaron W. Reisinger for his ex-
ceptional service to the United States and for 
his outstanding command of the United States 
Army Corps of Engineers—Chicago District.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN ‘‘JACK’’ 
FRANCIS DWYER (1921–2015) FOR 
HIS SERVICE AS PART OF THE 
OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICE 
(OSS) DURING WWII AS PART OF 
OPERATION CARPETBAGGER 
HON. JAHANA HAYES 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the late Sargent John Francis 
Dwyer and his service to our country. As a 
member of the Office of Strategic Services 
(OSS) during WWII as part of Operation Car-
petbagger, Sargent Dwyer was among the 
men and women who comprised America’s 
first spy agency, a predecessor to the CIA. On 
March 21, 2018, Congress bestowed its high-
est civilian honor upon the group by pre-
senting them with the Congressional Gold 
Medal. 
The archivists of the Air Force Historical Re-
search Agency, the repository of the United 
States Air Force’s official unit histories, have 
researched their files and found that after en-
listment on August 5, 1942, Sergeant John F. 
Dwyer arrived in England on March 18, 1945 
and was subsequently assigned to the 406th 
Bombardment Squadron at Harrington Air-
drome. After theater and aircrew orientation, 
Sergeant Dwyer and his crew, under the com-
mand of Captain Maurice W. Freeman, be-
come operational on May 17, 1945. Captain 
Freeman and his crew flew eight successful 
missions between May 17 and June 9. Ser-
geant Dwyer was honorably discharged on 
November 10, 1945. 
In addition to the dangers from German 
night fighters and flak, the Carpetbaggers al-
ways ran the risk of crashing into hillsides as 
they made low-level parachute deliveries to 
the resistance forces waiting below. From Jan-
uary 1944 to May 1945, they completed 1,860 
sorties and delivered 20,495 containers and 
11,174 packages of vital supplies to the resist-
ance forces in western and northwestern Eu-
rope. Overall, more than 1,000 parachutists 
were dropped into enemy territory. 
The OSS Congressional Gold Medal Act 
states that the group was America’s first effort 
to implement a system of strategic intelligence 
during World War II and provided the basis for 
the modern-day American intelligence and 
special operations communities. At its peak in 
late 1944, it employed almost 13,000 individ-
uals, a third of whom were women. 
The OSS organized, trained, supplied, and 
fought with resistance organizations through-
out Europe and Asia which played an impor-
tant role in America’s victory during World War 
II. The OSS invented and employed new tech-
nology through its Research and Development 
Branch, inventing new weapons and revolu-
tionary communications equipment. Its X–2 
branch pioneered counterintelligence with the 
British and established the modern counter-
intelligence community. The network of con-
tacts built by the OSS with foreign intelligence 
services led to enduring Cold War alliances. 
OSS ‘‘Mercy Missions’’ at the end of World 
War II saved the lives of thousands of Allied 
prisoners of war. 
Present-day 
Special 
Operations 
Forces 
trace their lineage to the OSS. Its Maritime 
Unit was a precursor to the U.S. Navy SEALs. 
The OSS Operational Groups and Jedburghs 
were forerunners to U.S. Army Special Forces. 
The 801st/492nd Bombardment Group were 
progenitors to the Air Force Special Oper-
ations Command. The Marines who served in 
the OSS were predecessors to the Marine 
Special Operations Command. U.S. Coast 
Guard personnel were recruited for the Mari-
time Unit and its Operational Simmer Group. 
Ultimately, the OSS spawned the Central Intel-
ligence Agency. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Sergeant John Francis Dwyer 
as he rests in peace after such extraordinary 
service to the United States of America.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
CENTENNIAL 
ANNIVERSARY OF NEW HAVEN’S 
UNION STATION 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
my heartfelt congratulations that I rise today to 
join the Connecticut Department of Transpor-
tation and the City of New Haven to celebrate 
the Centennial Anniversary of our very own 
Union Station—a remarkable milestone for this 
community treasure. 
Union Station holds a special place in my 
heart as it has been of my life for many years. 
Having attended Lauralton Hall in Milford, I 
was at Union Station every day to catch the 
train to school. Today, as a Member of Con-
gress, the train is how I commute to work 
every week. In fact, I would be remiss if I did 
not extend a special note of gratitude to the 
Red Caps of Union Station who have helped 
me with all of my luggage getting to and from 
the train on numerous occasions—without 
them I may have missed many trains. De-
signed by famed architect Cass Gilbert, with 
its vaulted ceilings and marbled brick, deco-
rated with oblong benches upon which model 
trains are showcased, Union Station is not 
only a bustling intermodal center, it is a work

Now in its centennial year, Union Station is

Connecticut along one of the busiest rail lines

generating nearly fifty million dollars in rev-
enue a year into our local economy. But be-
yond its economic importance to our commu-
nity, its value lies in the connection it brings to 
us. It connects the New Haven line into New 
York City, the Hartford Line into Hartford and 
Springfield. It also connects the Shoreline East 
into New London and Amtrak’s Northeast Cor-
ridor from Boston to Washington, D.C. and 
points beyond. 
Most importantly, Union Station connects 
our past to our future. Opened in the shadow 
of the Spanish Influenza pandemic, it is a par-
ticularly poignant reminder of what can be 
done and what must be done even amid ca-
lamity. We stand here today to both celebrate 
that old victory and to set our eyes forward to 
new ones. It is inspiring to see a local re-
minder of what America can do when we build 
toward a better future through infrastructure 
and when we at all levels of government sup-
port local priorities. 
I extend my deepest thanks and sincere ap-
preciation to all the workers who keep Union 
Station running every day—especially those 
declared essential at this difficult time. I am 
honored to stand today and join all of those 
gathered in wishing this remarkable institution 
a very happy 100th anniversary. As we say in 
Italian, Cent’ Anni.

IN RECOGNITION OF EDWARD 
JAMES LOVE 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Edward James Love, better 
known as Ed Love, a legend in Detroit’s music 
scene, on the occasion of his retirement. Ed 
Love is the renowned voice of ‘‘Destination 
Jazz: The Ed Love Program’’, playing jazz 
classics and new material each week on De-
troit’s WDET radio station. 
Born in Parsons, Kansas, Mr. Love was 
raised in a family of music lovers and whose 
parents instilled in him a great appreciation for 
jazz music. He began studying the trumpet in 
grade school and continued his studies 
through junior college. After graduating from 
Parsons Junior College in Kansas, Mr. Love 
chose to pursue a career in broadcasting at 
the Pathfinder Broadcast School in Kansas 
City, Missouri, where he graduated at the top 
of his class. 
Ed Love’s first job in broadcasting came in 
1951 at radio station KIND in Independence, 
Kansas. In 1952 he joined the United States 
Air Force and served as an Armed Forces 
Radio staffer in the Philippines, during the Ko-
rean War. After returning home from the war, 
Mr. Love returned to KIND to continue his ca-
reer in radio. Throughout the 1950s, Ed Love 
worked at radio stations in New York, West 
Virginia, and Pennsylvania. 
In 1959, fate brought Ed Love to Detroit, 
where he went to convalesce among family 
and friends from a severe case of influenza. 
Mr. Love was delighted to discover the pro-
liferation of jazz clubs and lively musical scene 
in the city of Detroit. From then on, Ed Love 
made his home in Detroit. Pursuing his pas-
sion for music by night, Mr. Love worked as a 
U.S. postal carrier by day, a job he held for 
more than thirty-five years. 
During his tenure in Detroit, Mr. Love 
worked at a variety of jazz stations before 
landing at Detroit’s National Public Radio affil-
iate WDET in 1983. His weekly show, Destina-
tion Jazz: The Ed Love Program, grew into a 
one of the station’s most popular programs, 
responsible for introducing several generations 
of young people to jazz. His deep and mellif-
luous voice is familiar not only to Detroiters, 
but also to the national audiences who heard 
his syndicated National Public Radio (NPR) 
program, The Evolution of Jazz—a program 
that ran for six years and was heard on sev-
eral stations around the US and two stations 
in Puerto Rico. 
Ed Love overcame a stroke suffered in 1994 
to continue making an impact in the world of 
music. There is no doubt that his passion for 
music has left a lasting impression on appre-
ciators of jazz locally and across our nation. 
Please join me in recognizing his many con-
tributions as we wish him well in his retirement 
from more than six decades in broadcasting.

HONORING MS. LUSILA ‘‘LUSI’’ 
ORTEGA 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the accomplishments of a remark-
able community leader from my district, Ms. 
Lusila ‘‘Lusi’’ Ortega. 
A native of Lozano, Texas, Ms. Ortega, got 
her first job as a teacher at the Rio Hondo 
Head Start in 1971. At the time, the Head 
Start program did not provide transportation, 
so she, along with her husband Juan Alaniz, 
retrofitted an old GSA van and drove it to 
transport children in the surrounding rural 
areas. She also organized many fundraisers 
and fun family events to benefit the Head Start 
children and families. Ms. Ortega’s dedication 
and success caught the eye of her supervisors 
and she was promoted to work at the adminis-
trative level as a Parent Involvement/Volunteer 
Services Coordinator. With the support of her 
peers and community leaders, she helped 
build a phenomenal Parent Involvement Pro-
gram that was recognized at the national level. 
Ms. Ortega spearheaded many fund raising 
events that provided parents the opportunity to 
travel and advocate for Head Start in the state 
of Texas and across the country. 
In 1990, Neighbors In Need of Services, Inc. 
(NINOS) was awarded the Head Start grant 
and Ms. Ortega was promoted to Assistant 
Head Start Director. During her tenure, the 
Head Start Program grew from serving a few 
hundred children to now serving over 2,900 
Head Start and Early Head Start students. Ms. 
Ortega served on the National Head Start As-
sociation Board of Directors and she was the 
first Head Start staff member elected to pre-
side over the Texas Head Start Association 
(THSA) Board of Directors. The THSA con-
tinues to honor her service by awarding a 
yearly scholarship in her name. Ms. Ortega 
was also selected to represent Region VI at 
the White House when President Bill Clinton 
signed a bill into law that broadened the Head 
Start Program to include children under the 
age of three. 
Ms. Ortega was a member of the National 
Head Start Association Board of Directors, the 
Texas Department of Human Services Licens-
ing Advisory Council, the University of Texas 
at Brownsville Child Care and Development 
Advisory Council, the Rio Grande Valley OIC 
Foster Grandparent Advisory Council, and was 
the Region VI Head Start Association Board of 
Directors officer. She was also a fellow with 
the Johnson & Johnson Management program 
and served as intergovernmental staff in the 
Office of Children and Families Region VI for 
one year. 
Anyone who knows Lusi Ortega knows her 
as the ‘‘Voice of Head Start.’’ I wish her a 
happy retirement and thank her for her lasting 
contributions to the educational and personal 
development of the children of South Texas.

ONGOING 
TRANSATLANTIC 
EN-
GAGEMENT THROUGH THE OSCE 
PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to update my Congressional colleagues on my 
continued consultations with transatlantic part-
ners to address critical challenges in Euro-
pean security. 
On September 2nd, I joined a video meeting 
of the leadership of the Parliamentary Assem-
bly of the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe (OSCE PA), in my capac-
ity as Chairman of that body’s Committee on 
Political Affairs and Security. The meeting in-
cluded about one dozen parliamentarians from 
across Europe. Senator ROGER WICKER of 
Mississippi also participated in the discussion. 
The news of the confirmed poisoning of 
Russian political figure Alexey Navalny broke 
during our meeting, and I am pleased to report 
that my colleagues and I immediately agreed 
to unanimously condemn this heinous act, 
whose origins can be traced directly to the 
Putin regime. There are now reports that 
some in Germany are reconsidering the 
Nordstream 2 pipeline deal with Russia. I have 
long argued against this project in the Par-
liamentary Assembly on grounds that it jeop-
ardizes Europe’s energy security. 
The Assembly’s leadership continues to 
monitor the deeply concerning developments 
in Belarus in the wake of the falsification of 
the results of the presidential elections in 
Belarus on August 9. Detentions and brutal 
treatment of protesters, members of the 
media, and bystanders continues unabated 
even as the Belarusian people rise in defense 
of 
their 
fundamental 
rights, 
rights 
the 
Belarusian government has pledged itself to 
uphold under the Helsinki Final Act. I am hon-
ored to represent the U.S. Congress in discus-
sions with our European partners as we try to 
encourage a peaceful and democratic way for-
ward for the people of Belarus. 
Among the other issues under discussion 
was the outbreak of fighting along the Arme-
nia-Azerbaijan border in mid-July and the role 
that regional powers may be playing in the 
tense security situation. We agreed that the 
parties should continue to look for ways to de- 
escalate, and to resume negotiations under 
the auspices of the OSCE Minsk Group. The 
Assembly has generally backed the work of 
the Minsk Group Co-Chairs, the agreed inter-
national format for addressing the conflict; the

Co-chairs have called for all sides to refrain 
from provocative statements and actions. We 
were asked to look into troubling reports that, 
following the devastating August 4th Beirut 
port explosion, de facto Armenian authorities 
in Nagorno Karabakh are resettling displaced 
Lebanese Armenians to disputed or occupied 
territories. While any reasonable person wit-
nessing that horrible event would welcome the 
Armenian Government’s efforts to provide re-
lief and resettlement support to displaced Leb-
anese Armenians, I fear that resettlement in 
disputed or occupied territory could damage 
prospects for a peaceful, negotiated resolution 
to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. The Assem-
bly’s leadership agreed to consider additional 
steps it could take towards supporting peace-
ful resolution of this conflict. 
The OSCE, including the Parliamentary As-
sembly, engages in election observation ef-
forts, primarily with the goal of encouraging 
good practices in countries still in the process 
of democratic transition. In Montenegro during 
the last week of August, the Assembly de-
ployed its first observation mission since the 
pandemic struck. I welcomed that effort in our 
NATO ally, not only to strengthen the demo-
cratic institutions that fundamental to NATO 
membership but also to support that country 
as it faces malign outside influences, including 
from Russia. 
The OSCE also intends to observe our gen-
eral elections in November, demonstrating that 
all countries, not just those in transition, 
should be open to observation and willing to 
consider ways to improve their respective 
electoral processes. I noted the extensive de-
bates we Americans have on this same sub-
ject, including now the issue of mail-in voting. 
In discussing the situation in the United 
States, I made an effort to note that our coun-
try is facing challenges but is still strong. I be-
lieve it is important to present a complete pic-
ture that counters perceptions of a more dire 
situation when viewed across the Atlantic, as 
well as malign messaging that seeks to sepa-
rate us from our friends and allies. 
The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, Madam 
Speaker, provides Members of Congress with 
a unique, bipartisan opportunity to work with 
our friends and allies to help resolve pressing 
global issues while promoting our shared val-
ues. Because it also includes delegations from 
Russia, Belarus and other countries who dis-
regard the OSCE commitments to which they 
gave their consent regarding democratic gov-
ernment and respect for human rights, it is 
also uniquely suited to speaking to their rep-
resentatives directly and making clear that 
their behavior is unacceptable and negatively 
affects our bilateral relationships. 
Madam Speaker, I hope all my colleagues 
agree and join me today in condemning 
Lukashenko’s cruel repressions in Belarus and 
the Putin regime’s sinister efforts to silence its 
critics, as well as in recognizing the impor-
tance of continued Congressional engagement 
with the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE 
as a means to address these important mat-
ters. 
HONORING 
TROY 
AND 
TANNER 
BARABY, FOUNDERS OF SOUTH

ENTERPRISES, 
FOR 
THEIR 
SUCCESSFUL 
REVITAL-
IZATION OF THE PLATTSBURGH 
RAIL YARD 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the tremendous effort Troy and 
Tanner Baraby have put into revitalizing the 
rail yard in Plattsburgh, New York. 
In 2017, the Baraby brothers established 
South Junction Enterprises to provide local 
businesses the opportunity to ship inventory in 
and out of the area by rail. The company has 
facilitated local farmers in reaching a wide 
customer base as their cars ship products 
across the North Country, New England and 
Canada. 
This 
project 
has 
successfully 
repurposed an abandoned rail yard to a thriv-
ing business. In the first two years of oper-
ations, South Junction Enterprises has quad-
rupled its rail car capacity to greater fulfill the 
community needs. 
Local businesses are the backbone of the 
North Country economy and push innovation 
forward. Job creation and economic growth 
stemming from entrepreneurship are vital for 
long term sustainable development in our 
community. I applaud the entrepreneurial spirit 
that runs within the Baraby family and their 
commitment to serving our community that 
has continued over many generations. In addi-
tion to South Junction Enterprises, the broth-
ers continue to operate Moore Recycling in 
Keeseville, New York which was founded by 
their grandfather, George Moore. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I 
would like to thank the Baraby family and the 
entire South Junction Enterprises team for 
their dedication to the community and con-
gratulate them on their hard-earned achieve-
ments thus far.

HONORING SABETHA MUMM AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I ask the 
House of Representatives to join me in cele-
brating an Iowan who models the promise of 
the American Dream and someone who has 
turned their passion for dance into a thriving 
small business. It is my great honor to recog-
nize Sabetha Mumm, the owner of Dance Vi-
sion in Johnston, as Iowan of the Week. 
A lifelong dancer, Sabetha always knew she 
was meant to share her love of dance with 
others. After one semester of college as a pre- 
law major, she switched to a dance major, 
eventually graduating with a Bachelor of Arts 
in Dance with Honors. Without enough re-
sources to help her career in dance imme-
diately come to fruition, she initially opted for 
a more traditional career path in an office set-
ting. 
Years later while encouraging her young 
son to follow his dreams, she realized she 
needed to do the same. She wanted to lead 
by example for her children and provide young 
Iowans the resources she hadn’t had to pur-
sue their dreams of careers in dance. With the 
support of her family, the native Iowan dedi-
cated the next few years to researching and 
planning her business: Dance Vision. Since 
opening in 2003, Mumm has grown Dance Vi-
sion from a rented, 2,500 square foot space 
with one studio to a custom-designed, 12,000 
square foot facility with five different studios. 
Thousands of talented students have come 
through her classes and several hundred have 
gone on to find professional success as danc-
ers in the United States and abroad. They’ve 
graced Broadway shows, advanced through 
televised dance competitions, toured with 
world-famous musical artists, and been fea-
tured in music videos, Sabetha credits this 
overwhelming success to the spirit and work 
ethic of Iowans. There’s plenty of talent here, 
she says, and now a resource to help it flour-
ish. 
After learning more about Sabetha’s journey 
and growing venture, it came as no surprise 
that she was named the Small Business Ad-
ministration’s 
2020 
Iowa 
Small 
Businessperson of the Year: a prestigious 
honor very well deserved. 
Businesses like Sabetha’s are vital to the 
success of any community. This is a fact we 
see more each day as the pandemic stretches 
on. As a small business owner myself, I know 
it is an incredible challenge to start and main-
tain that vision. Sabetha’s drive to pursue her 
dream is inspiring—that kind of leap is not for 
the faint of heart. Her decision has clearly paid 
off as we celebrate her success and thriving 
dance studio today. She’s helping kids and 
families find joy through movement and self- 
expression and is passing her passion for 
dance down to new generations. She is a per-
fect example of how strategic collaboration, 
creativity, a little patience, and a lot of hard 
work can make your dreams a reality. 
As I’ve traveled all 16 counties across my 
district, one thing every place has in common 
is that women are who hold our communities 
together. Whether it’s through volunteering at 
church, providing child care for neighbors, or-
ganizing an annual festival, or operating a 
successful small business—the ladies in our 
communities are getting things done. 
Sabetha says, ‘‘The only dreams impossible 
to reach are the ones that you never pursue.’’ 
It is people with that kind of spirit that make 
Iowa such a great place to live, have a family, 
and grow a business. I will continue to fight in 
Congress for small business owners like 
Sabetha to ensure the American dream will al-
ways be alive in our community. It is my honor 
to recognize Sabetha Mumm as our Iowan of 
the Week.

Everette family moved around the country for 
his father’s job as an Evangelical Lutheran 
Church builder. Commander Everette attended 
Oregon State University, where he joined the 
Naval ROTC and was a member of the nation-
ally ranked rifle team. Following graduation, 
Commander Everette joined the U.S. Navy 
and became a midshipman on the USS Wis-
consin-BB-64. His first deployment was on the 
USS Bauer-DDE 1025 and he was later sta-
tioned in Pearl Harbor where he carried out 
nuclear submarine service. He went on to be-
come the project manager of the Trident Bal-
listic Missile Program in Washington, D.C., 
during which time he helped design the 
SATRAK 
Satellite. 
In 
1981, 
Commander 
Everette was transferred to Contra Costa 
County as the Executive Officer at the Con-
cord Naval Weapons Station before retiring in 
1985. 
Throughout Commander Everette’s deco-
rated military service, he earned the National 
Defense Service Medal, Navy Unit Com-
mendation, Navy Commendation Medal, Navy 
Achievement Medal, Navy Meritorious Unit 
Commendation, Navy Expeditionary Medal, 
Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Medal of 
Gallantry, SSBN Deterrent Patrol Insignia, and 
Meritorious Service Medal. 
In addition to his professional accomplish-
ments, then-Lieutenant Everette married Patsy 
Thompson and the couple had two children. 
He enjoyed gardening, camping, and studying 
his genealogy, finding six Revolutionary War 
ancestors. Commander Everette was also ac-
tive in several veterans organizations, includ-
ing the Holland Club of the U.S. Submarine 
Veterans Mare Island Base, MOAA, Contra 
Costa Council of the Navy League of the 
United States, Walnut Creek Elks, VFW Post 
1525, and Thomas Jefferson Chapter Sons of 
the American Revolution. For many years, he 
walked in Concord, California’s Fourth of July 
parade with the VA. 
Commander Everette passed away earlier 
this year. He was a cherished resident of Con-
cord and he will be missed. Please join me in 
honoring Commander Everette for his many

fortitude deserves recognition. It is this kind of 
initiative and patriotism that I love to see in

HONORING THE LIFE OF GUSTAVA 
WILSON 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 11, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Gustava Wilson, a ‘‘Rosie 
the Riveter’’ who passed away on August 29, 
2020 at the age of 97 after a lifetime of exem-
plary service to the United States of America 
and her community in Marin City. 
Gustava Wilson was born in Scotlandville 
parish, Baton Rouge, Louisiana on March 14, 
1923, to McKinley and Olivia Hill. The second 
of nine children, she attended school until the 
ninth grade, at which point she took care of 
her younger siblings and began working at the 
Istrouma Laundry. Gustava traveled to Cali-
fornia in 1942 at the age of 17 as part of the 
Second Great Migration, following her brother 
Isaac Hill and cousin Robert Valentine in 
search of better opportunities working in the 
shipyards during World War II. A determined 
and curious woman, she went to California to 
see for herself if rumors that the streets were 
paved with silver and gold were true. 
During the war, Gustava joined the roughly 
44,000 civilian workers at Mare Island Naval 
Hospital in Vallejo, California, where she 
worked as a nurse and cook. The hospital and 
its staff achieved national and international ac-
claim during WWII for their orthopedic depart-
ment, better known as the ‘‘amputee shop’’ or 
‘‘brace shop.’’ The development and manufac-
ture of plastic limbs and therapy that followed 
served tens of thousands of disabled military 
personnel. It is from her dedicated service in 
this role that Mrs. Wilson earned her place in 
history as a ‘‘Rosie the Riveter.’’ 
After the war Gustava returned to Louisiana, 
where she met and married Joe Wilson. Two 
years later, they settled and proceeded to 
raise a family in Marin City, California. They 
lived in the same home for 60 years and be-
came embedded in the community. Gustava’s 
community service included membership in 
the Mother’s Guild, Senior Sunshine Club, and 
the Performing Stars’ Guiding Stars Grand-
parents Group. She was affectionately known 
as ‘‘Granny’’ in the community. 
Gustava 
received 
many 
distinguished 
awards and accolades over the years, includ-
ing YMCA Woman of the Year, Marin Wom-
en’s Hall of Fame, and she was honored dur-
ing Rotary Club of Sausalito’s Marinship 75th 
Anniversary during the Marin City Veterans 
Day Ceremonies. In 2017, the Native Sons of 
the Golden West honored Gustava as a great 
woman of this state for her dedication and 
service that was instrumental in our country’s 
victory and the Allied victory in World War II. 
Gustava was a dedicated mother who deep-
ly treasured every moment with her family, es-
pecially her grandchildren. Vivacious and 
straightforward, she was a strong, determined, 
and fiercely independent woman. 
Gustava is survived by her brother, Wilbert 
Hill and his wife Inez, sister-in-law Mary Hill, 
two children Mona and Lena, stepchildren 
Allen Dell, David, Charles, Nellie Pearl, Jose-
phine & Hollis; goddaughter, Edwina Figueras, 
godson, Reginald Tisdale; six grandchildren, 
Kameelah McNeely and husband Derek, 
Darrena, Robert, Jr., Nellie, Lamar Jr., David; 
five great grandchildren, Derek, Jr., Dawaiian, 
Yazmin, Kylea, Amya, and numerous nieces, 
nephews, and extended family. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in extend-
ing my appreciation for Gustava Wilson’s 
many years of service and dedication to this 
country and her community, and in expressing 
my deepest condolences to her family and 
friends. She will be forever remembered as a 
shining example of American exceptionalism, 
and a true Rosie the Riveter.
