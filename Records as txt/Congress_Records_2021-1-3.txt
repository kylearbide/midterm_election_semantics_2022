Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, SUNDAY, JANUARY 3, 2021 
No. 1 
House of Representatives 
This being the day fixed by the 20th 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States, for the meeting of the 
117th Congress of the United States, 
the Representatives-elect met in their 
Hall, and at noon were called to order 
by the Clerk of the House of Represent-
atives, Hon. Cheryl L. Johnson. 
Reverend Emanuel Cleaver, II, St. 
James United Methodist Church, Kan-
sas City, Missouri, offered the fol-
lowing prayer: 
Eternal God, noiselessly we bow be-
fore Your throne of grace as we leave 
behind the politically and socially 
clamorous year of 2020. We gather, now, 
in this consequential Chamber to inau-
gurate another chapter in our roller 
coaster 
representative 
government. 
The Members of this august body ac-
knowledge Your sacred supremacy and, 
therefore, confess that without Your 
favor and forbearance, we enter this 
new year relying, dangerously, on our 
own fallible nature. 
God, at a moment when many believe 
that the bright light of democracy is 
beginning to dim, empower us with an 
extra dose of commitment to its prin-
ciples. May we, of the 117th Congress, 
refuel the lamp of liberty so brimful 
that generations unborn will witness 
its undying flame. And may we model 
community healing, control our tribal 
tendencies and quicken our spirit that 
we may feel Thy priestly presence even 
in moments of heightened disagree-
ment. May we so feel Your presence 
that our service here may not be soiled 
by any utterances or acts unworthy of 
this high office. Insert in our spirit a 
light so bright that we can see our-
selves and our politics as we really 
are—soiled by selfishness, perverted by 
prejudice and inveigled by ideology. 
Now, may the God who created the 
world and everything in it bless us and 
keep us. May the Lord make His face 
to shine upon us and be gracious unto 
us. May the Lord lift up the light of 
His countenance upon us and give us 
peace—peace in our families, peace 
across this land and dare I ask, O Lord, 
peace even in this Chamber, now and 
evermore. We ask it in the name of the 
monotheistic God and Brahma and God 
known by many names by many dif-
ferent faiths. 
Amen, and a woman. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The CLERK. The Representatives- 
elect and their guests will please re-
main standing and join in the Pledge of 
Allegiance. 
The Clerk led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The CLERK. As directed by law, the 
Clerk of the House has prepared the of-
ficial roll of the Representatives-elect. 
Certificates of election covering 434 
seats in the One Hundred Seventeenth 
Congress have been received by the 
Clerk of the House. The Clerk has not 
received a certificate of election from 
the 22nd District of the State of New 
York. The names of those persons 
whose credentials show that they were 
regularly elected as Representatives in 
accord with the laws of their respective 
States or of the United States will be 
called. 
The Representatives-elect will record 
their presence by electronic device and 
their names will be reported in alpha-
betical order by State, beginning with 
the State of Alabama, to determine 
whether a quorum is present. 
Representatives-elect 
will 
record 
their presence by electronic device. 
Representatives-elect who have not 
obtained their voting ID cards may do 
so now in Statuary Hall. 
The call was taken by electronic de-
vice, and the following Representa-
tives-elect responded to their names:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3 
January 3, 2021 
House of Representatives for the 117th 
Congress. 
Nominations are now in order. 
The Clerk recognizes the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Clerk, I rise 
today at the direction of the House 
Democratic Caucus, by the vote of that 
Caucus, to place the name of the Hon-
orable NANCY PELOSI, Representative- 
elect from the great State of Cali-
fornia, by way of Charm City, into 
nomination for election to the position 
of Speaker of the United States House 
of Representatives. 
NANCY PELOSI believes in the power 
of American exceptionalism. 
NANCY PELOSI believes in the good-
ness of the American people. 
NANCY PELOSI believes that our di-
versity is our strength and that our 
unity is our power. 
NANCY
PELOSI
believes 
that 
the 
House is fundamentally the institution 
best equipped to reflect the hopes, the 
dreams, and the aspirations of every-
day Americans. 
NANCY PELOSI believes that our sa-
cred mission is to continue America’s 
long, necessary, and majestic march 
toward a more perfect Union. 
The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., once observed that the true 
measure of a leader is not how one 
fares in moments of comfort or conven-
ience, but how one fares in moments of 
challenge 
and 
controversy. 
NANCY 
PELOSI has passed that test with flying 
colors over and over and over again. 
As a result of her tremendous leader-
ship, during a moment of great turbu-
lence, House Democrats ended the 
longest government shutdown in Amer-
ican history; addressed the humani-
tarian crisis at the border; negotiated a 
historic trade agreement that pro-
tected good-paying American jobs; held 
the President accountable because no 
one is above the law; passed progres-
sive legislation to transform policing 
in America as part of our effort to deal 
with systemic racism; ended the egre-
gious practice of surprise billing be-
cause healthcare is a right, not simply 
a privilege; and confronted the once-in- 
a-century COVID–19 pandemic with a 
comprehensive, passionate, and con-
tinuing congressional response that, at 
the end of the day, will crush the virus 
and supercharge our economy. 
That is the NANCY
PELOSI
track 
record. 
NANCY PELOSI is a champion of the 
children, a defender of the disenfran-
chised, a voice for the voiceless, a fabu-
lous facilitator, a notorious negotiator, 
and a legendary legislator for such a 
time as this. 
This is a moment of great challenge 
here in America, filled with trials and 
tribulations and a lot of pain and suf-
fering and death. But America is a re-
silient Nation. House Democrats are a 
resilient Caucus. NANCY PELOSI is a re-
silient leader. 
Brighter days are ahead in the 
United States of America. This is a day 
of great renewal in the House of Rep-
resentatives. This is a day when House 
Democrats will begin our work with 
the next President of the United States 
of America, Joe Biden, and his partner, 
KAMALA HARRIS, so we can build back 
better for the people. This is a day 
when, once again, NANCY D’ALESANDRO 
PELOSI will become the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representa-
tives. 
Madam Clerk, I proudly place her 
name into nomination, and when it is 
all said and done, history will record 
that today was a good day. 
God bless NANCY PELOSI. God bless 
the Congress. God bless the United 
States of America. 
The CLERK. The Clerk now recog-
nizes the gentlewoman from Wyoming 
(Ms. CHENEY). 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Clerk, first of 
all, let me thank my colleague from 
New York (Mr. JEFFRIES). 
Madam Clerk, I also start by asking 
all of our colleagues to remember in 
their thoughts and prayers the family 
of Luke Letlow, Congressman-elect 
from Louisiana, who died tragically 
last week. 
We also want to remember our friend 
and colleague JAMIE RASKIN and pray 
for his family as they deal with the 
devastating loss of their son. 
We engage in heated exchanges in 
this body, as we should, but it is well 
for us always to remember that we are 
all God’s children. Our hearts break 
when our colleagues and friends are 
suffering. I am reminded of the words 
of the 19th century religious scholar 
who said: I expect to pass through this 
world but once. If, therefore, there can 
be any kindness I can show or any good 
thing I can do my fellow being, let me 
do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect 
it, for I shall not pass this way again. 
Fine words to guide us as we embark 
on this Congress. 
Madam Clerk, the nominating cere-
mony looks very different today in this 
Chamber. 
Our 
masks 
and 
our 
distancing requirements are reminders 
of this pandemic threat that we face 
and that we must defeat together, but 
the Congress is also different because 
of something we all take great pride in. 
This body now has more women 
Members than at any time in our his-
tory. Our new Republican women are 
here to work. They are here to get 
things done. As we like to say in Wyo-
ming, it is time to cowgirl up. 
There is no one in this body more re-
sponsible for our tremendous new class 
of Members, our men and women, than 
our leader, KEVIN MCCARTHY. Through 
his tireless work and his efforts to 
date, we have made historic gains, and 
we are not done yet. 
These gains would not have happened 
without 
Leader 
MCCARTHY’s 
un-
matched work ethic, his strategic and 
tactical skill, and his commitment to 
our candidates. Nor would they have 
happened without KEVIN’s steadfast 
commitment to defending our freedom, 
standing up for our Constitution, and 
remembering that the work we do in 
this Chamber affects American fami-
lies and workers all across this Nation. 
Madam Clerk, it is my high honor 
today to have the great privilege to 
nominate the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCARTHY) to lead us in 
our work as Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives. 
Leader MCCARTHY is a grandson of a 
cattle rancher, the son of a firefighter. 
He grew up in a working-class family. 
He started and ran his own business, 
Kevin O’s in Bakersfield. He paid his 
way through college. And he knows 
firsthand that our small businesses are 
the backbone of our economy and that 
government is more often the problem 
than the solution. 
No one has been a greater champion 
of ensuring that our government is 
limited, defending the rights of the 
States and the people in those States, 
and resisting the urge of some of our 
colleagues to steal power from the peo-
ple and give it to the government. 
Leader MCCARTHY will always look 
for ways to work across the aisle. More 
times than I can count over the last 2 
years, he has led us in putting forward 
proposals, like the Commitment to 
America, that encapsulate good policy 
and should be bipartisan. He will con-
tinue to do this, but he will never com-
promise our fundamental rights and 
freedoms. 
Last year, as the threat from the 
Chinese Communist Party grew and 
spread, Leader MCCARTHY established 
the China Task Force and urged Demo-
crats to join us in confronting a grave 
threat that requires bipartisan solu-
tions. They refused. Nonetheless, the 
task force he directed published legis-
lative recommendations, two-thirds of 
which are bipartisan. 
Leader MCCARTHY ensured that we 
were united as we successfully fought 
the unconstitutional and partisan im-
peachment effort launched by our Dem-
ocrat colleagues, and he guided us 
through the unprecedented challenges 
of operating in and responding to the 
global COVID pandemic. 
For a real guide as to how things will 
operate once Leader MCCARTHY
is 
Speaker MCCARTHY, look to the his-
toric productivity we saw the last time 
Republicans were in charge in the 115th 
Congress. Leader MCCARTHY led us in 
repealing regulations, cutting taxes, 
supporting our veterans, combating 
opioid 
addiction 
and 
human 
traf-
ficking, securing our borders, growing 
our economy, and defending our Na-
tion. 
Leader MCCARTHY made sure that we 
passed on time and at a sufficient level, 
for the first time in more than a dec-
ade, defense appropriations to ensure 
that we fulfilled our most sacred con-
stitutional duty. As Speaker, that is 
the kind of record he will deliver on 
again. 
Madam Clerk, as Republicans, we 
know that the United States Constitu-
tion is our sword and our shield. We 
know that our rights do not come from 
government; they come from God. We

know that those rights are protected 
by the exquisite structure designed by 
our Founding Fathers. 
Madam Clerk, over here on this side 
of the aisle, we are going to continue 
to call them Founding Fathers, despite 
the new House rules package. We know 
that the man to lead us as we confront 
the important work ahead is our Re-
publican leader, KEVIN MCCARTHY. 
Madam Clerk, because he will lead us 
in fighting for all the people of this 
great Nation; because he will continue 
to stand against socialism and will 
continue to stand against the expan-
sion of government power that strips 
power from the people and gives it to 
the government; because he knows that 
the most important words of our found-
ing document are the first 3 words, 
‘‘We the people,’’ as chair of the House 
Republican Conference, I am honored 
and directed by the vote of that Con-
ference to present for election to the 
Office of the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives for the 117th Congress 
the name of the Honorable KEVIN 
MCCARTHY, Representative-elect from 
the State of California. 
The CLERK. The names of the Hon-
orable NANCY PELOSI, a Representative- 
elect from the State of California, and 
the Honorable KEVIN MCCARTHY, a Rep-
resentative-elect from the State of 
California, have been placed in nomina-
tion. 
Are there further nominations? 
There being no further nominations, 
the Clerk appoints the following tell-
ers: 
The gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. 
KAPTUR); 
The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
RODNEY DAVIS); 
The gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. LOFGREN); and 
The gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina (Ms. FOXX). 
The tellers will come forward and 
take their seats at the desk in front of 
the Speaker’s rostrum. 
The roll will now be called, and those 
responding to their names will indicate 
by surname the nominee of their choos-
ing. 
The Reading Clerk will now call the 
roll. 
The tellers having taken their places, 
the House proceeded to vote for the 
Speaker.

SWEARING IN OF SPEAKER 
The Sergeant at Arms announced the 
Speaker-elect of the House of Rep-
resentatives of the 117th Congress, who 
was escorted to the chair by the Com-
mittee of Escort. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Colleagues, friends, 
and fellow Americans, it is my honor 
to welcome you to the first day of the 
117th Congress. We are here with the 
support of our families and the faith of 
our neighbors to be their voice in 
Washington. 
Since Congress first sat in this room, 
Americans have always found a way to 
ensure that their needs were top of the 
mind. In fact, when Abraham Lincoln 
served here, Members of Congress only 
had small desks on the House floor to 
store their work. One of those desks 
now sits in the Cannon Office Building 
tunnel. As Members traveled back and 
forth to the Nation’s Capital, they 
were compelled to carry all of their 
work with them. There were no filing 
cabinets and no servers in the cloud or 
offices. Their desk was their office. 
Members rarely went anywhere with-
out physically bringing their constitu-
ents’ concerns with them. 
These small desks are a timeless re-
minder to every American that the 
House is made to represent you, the 
people; and that is a responsibility I 
welcome 
and 
embrace 
every 
day. 
Today, however, it is easier than ever 
to neglect or ignore this responsibility. 
From social media to special interest 
groups, to the culture police, there are 
endless temptations to distract from 
why we are here and who is truly im-
portant. 
Sadly, the last Congress suffered 
from this neglect. In this Chamber 2 
years ago, the Speaker spoke of a new 
dawn for the middle class. But for the 
next 2 years, the majority was con-
sumed with everything else. During 
some of the most challenging times for 
our country, I felt Congress was on the 
sidelines. 
When the need for more pandemic re-
lief was obvious, did we deliver in a 
timely manner the lifeline America 
needed? 
Or did we say nothing was better 
than something until politics dictated 
our actions? 
When unrest filled into the cities and 
communities across the country, did 
we deliver safety that Americans want-
ed? 
Or did we let calls to defund the po-
lice intimidate us from protecting life, 
liberty, and property? 
When Americans relied on essential 
workers to keep our country moving, 
did we serve the people’s House in a 
way Americans deserved? 
Or did we shrink and reward Mem-
bers who stayed home, skipped work, 
and still got paid? 
The unfortunate answers to these 
questions underscore why the last Con-
gress was the least productive Congress 
in 50 years. 
It has been said that a house divided 
cannot stand. If there are any lessons 
that Americans have learned in the 
last 2 years, it is this: a House dis-
tracted cannot govern. 
I wish I could say that the majority 
in Congress is committed to changing 
for the common good and focusing on 
what really matters, but I am con-
cerned that the early actions are point-
ing in the wrong direction. 
Tomorrow, this majority of the new 
117th Congress plans to adopt new rules 
that would silence our constituents’ 
voices in Congress. Those rules throw 
away more than 100 years of represen-
tation in our Nation’s Capitol and ef-
fectively kill the key opportunity to 
amend legislation. 
Worse, they would penalize any Mem-
ber who shares news or views that 
maybe their allies in the media deem 
fake. They actually make it an ethics 
violation, which is usually reserved for 
such unbecoming conduct as bribery or 
corruption. Under these rules, all Mem-
bers are equal, but some are more 
equal than others. For our constitu-
ents, it means freedom of speech is si-
lenced, good ideas are stifled, and dis-
sent is punished. 
Why would an American political 
party use this as your first action in 
Congress? 
Perhaps they feel an urgency to pro-
tect their political careers. Given the 
message that the American people sent 
to Washington, the grip is slim and the 
majority is slimmer. Two months ago 
to this very day, the American people 
said, Enough. Enough with politicians 
who dictate what you can say, where 
you can eat, or whether you can go to 
church; enough with politicians who ig-
nore the stay-at-home lockdowns they 
impose on the rest of us; and enough 
with arrogance and hypocrisy. 
Americans are fed up with it, and we 
Republicans are too. As the party of 
Lincoln, Republicans understand what 
it means to carry our constituents’ 
concerns with us at all times. We are a 
growing, working class coalition of 
proud Americans who are more ener-
getic, united, and confident than ever 
before. 
We 
believe 
in 
the 
exceptionalism of this Nation and are 
not afraid to say it. We have listened 
to our constituents. We heard how 
things needed to change, and we made 
a commitment to America to restore 
our way of life, rebuild the economy, 
and renew the American Dream. 
That is what we campaigned on. That 
is what we offered in every district. 
And if the voices of the people matter, 
that is how we plan to govern. 
The response from the American peo-
ple to our commitment was resound-
ing. Even though we were outspent in 
district by district, no Republican in-
cumbent 
was 
defeated—none. 
All 
across this country, voters endorsed 
common sense, not conflict. It was a 
referendum against a radical agenda to 
defund the police and punish hard 
work. It was a wake-up call. 
The question I ask of this Congress 
is: Were we listening? 
As we enter the new Congress, I ask 
every Member to step out of your of-
fice, go to the Cannon Office Building 
tunnel, look at that small desk, and 
ask yourself: What is in your desk? 
Here is what is in mine: As the son of 
a fireman, I know how our police offi-
cers and first responders put every-
thing on the line to keep us safe. I will 
never, never, never vote to defund 
them. 
Can we make that same commitment 
to America? 
As a former small business owner, I 
understand how tough things can be 
even in the best of times. As we battle 
the coronavirus, our small businesses 
are battling lockdowns that are de-
stroying livelihoods and making it im-
possible to beat the odds. So I will not 
hike their taxes. 
Can we make that same commitment 
to America? 
As a fourth-generation Central Val-
ley Member from California, I rep-
resent farmers and oil field workers 
who rise at the dawn to go to work; 
who pray to God; and who raise the 
next generation of good, decent citi-
zens. I will respect their individuality 
and their freedom, and I will not forget 
them. 
Can we keep that commitment to 
America? 
No more misplaced priorities. The 
American people deserve better. Amer-
ica is worth fighting for. Americans’ 
rights are worth fighting for. Their 
dreams are worth fighting for; their 
voices are worth fighting for; and, most 
importantly, their voices are worth 
being heard on this floor. 
During the darkest days of the Civil 
War, when this Nation was literally 
burning with division, Abraham Lin-
coln advised us to strive ‘‘to maintain

the government and institutions of our

to transmit them to our children and 
our children’s children forever.’’ 
He was right then and he is right 
now. For the sake of the many genera-
tions to come, we need to succeed now. 
With that, I want to congratulate the 
Speaker. 
Madam Speaker, as I hand you this 
gavel, I just ask that you keep in mind 
that all the people in America will 
have a voice on this floor. 
b 1730 
Ms. PELOSI. Members of Congress, 
families, friends, welcome all. 
As Speaker of the House, it is my 
great honor to preside over this sacred 
ritual of renewal as we gather under 
the dome of this temple of democracy 
to begin the 117th Congress. 
Thank you, Leader MCCARTHY. Con-
gratulations on your election as leader. 
I look forward to working with you to 
meet the needs of the American people 
during this great moment of challenge. 
As the leader knows, usually on this 
day, the day of our swearing-in, there 
is a bipartisan church service that we 
all attend, and we pray together for 
America. Until that is possible again, 
let us all pray personally, pray that 
there be peace on Earth, and let it 
begin with us. That is our recurring 
theme. And our prayers, as we all 
know, are very needed now. 
As we are sworn in today, we accept 
a responsibility as daunting and de-
manding as any previous generation of 
leadership has ever faced. We begin 
this new Congress during a time of ex-
traordinary difficulty. 
Each of our communities has been 
drastically affected by the pandemic 
and its economic crisis: 350,000 tragic 
deaths, which we sadly carry in our 
hearts; over 20 million infections; mil-
lions without jobs—a toll beyond com-
prehension. 
To our new Members—and we will be 
welcoming them soon to swear them 
in—welcome and congratulations on 
your election to the United States 
House 
of 
Representatives. 
As 
our 
Founders intended, our democracy will 
be reinvigorated by the vibrancy and 
dynamism of the communities that you 
represent. 
To our returning Members, congratu-
lations to you and your families upon 
your reelection. 
As we open the new Congress, we 
grieve the passing of Congressman- 
elect Luke Letlow. We send our deepest 
sympathy to his wife, Julia, and their 
children, and we are praying for them 
at this sad time. We carry this symbol 
of Louisiana, in a bipartisan way, in 
his honor. 
Our Congress also suffered another 
sad loss this week with the passing of 
Jamie 
and 
Sarah 
Raskin’s 
son, 
Tommy. Our hearts are broken for 
them, and I hope it is a comfort to 
them that so many mourn their loss. 
Each of us comes to this Chamber, of 
course, strengthened by our constitu-
ents but with the love of our families. 
Thank you to the families of our Mem-
bers for sharing your loved ones with 
the Congress and with the country. It 
is a sacrifice, we know. 
Personally, I want to thank my hus-
band, Paul; our five children, Nancy 
Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, 
and Alexandra; our nine grandchildren; 
and my D’Alesandro family from Balti-
more, Maryland. With me in spirit are 
my mother and father and my brother, 
Tommy. My parents taught us through 
their example that public service is a 
noble calling and that we all have a re-
sponsibility to help others. Italian 
American, proud of our Italian herit-
age, fiercely patriotic Americans, de-
voutly Catholic, and staunchly Demo-
cratic, we saw that as connected. 
In that spirit, I thank my constitu-
ents in San Francisco, California, who 
have entrusted me to represent them in 
the spirit of Saint Francis, the patron 
saint of our city, whose anthem, the 
‘‘Song of Saint Francis,’’ is the anthem 
of our city: ‘‘Lord, make me a channel 
of thy peace.’’ 
I thank my Democratic colleagues in 
the Congress for the confidence you 
have placed in me in electing me 
Speaker. I will endeavor to meet the 
moment 
with 
courage, 
unity, 
and 
grace. 
I especially thank our distinguished 
chair of the Caucus, Mr. JEFFRIES, 
Chairman JEFFRIES, for his very gen-
erous nomination. 
Thank you, Mr. JEFFRIES. 
It gives me great pride to serve as 
Speaker of the most diverse House of 
Representatives in the history of our 
country with a record-shattering 122 
women—122 women, you can applaud 
that—100 years after women won the 
right to vote. 
Now, let us take a moment to give 
thanks to our courageous servicemem-
bers in uniform, and our veterans and 
their families and caregivers, whose 
service makes us the land of the free 
and the home of the brave. Our promise 
to them is that Congress will continue 
to work in a bipartisan way to build a 
future worthy of their sacrifice. 
As we look forward to the new Con-
gress, let us take a moment to remem-
ber three champions of democracy we 
lost during the 116th Congress, each 
honored by a lying-in-state ceremony 
in the United States Capitol. 
In the fall of last year, we said good- 
bye to Mr. Chairman, Elijah Cum-
mings, our North Star, who said: When 
we are dancing with the angels, the 
question will be asked: What did you do 
to be sure we kept our democracy in-
tact? 
He is dancing with the angels now. 
This past spring, we said good-bye to 
our beloved colleague John Lewis, the 
conscience of the Congress, who would 
say, when you see something that is 
not right, not fair, not just, you must 
speak up, and he would remind us to 
make good trouble. 
In the fall, we memorialized Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the most 
brilliant legal minds in our history and 
a champion for equality, who once said 
right here in the Capitol—some of you 
were there, perhaps, in the Statuary 
Hall—she once said, right here in the 
Capitol, about women: Once the door is 
open, there is no stopping us. 
Each of their memories is a source of 
strength and inspiration to us as we ap-
proach the challenges ahead. Scripture 
tells us that to everything there is a 
time, a season: a time for every pur-
pose under the heavens; a time to 
build, a time to sow, a time to heal. 
Now is certainly a time for our Nation 
to heal. 
Our most urgent priority will con-
tinue to be defeating the coronavirus, 
and defeat it, we will. Defeat it, we 
will. 
Two weeks ago, we passed an emer-
gency relief package to crush the virus 
and put money in the pockets of work-
ers and families, which is now the law, 
but we must do more to recognize our 
heroes. Let us thank our heroes: our 
healthcare workers; our first respond-
ers; our police and fire, who we have 
denied support by denying help to 
State and local government; our trans-
portation, sanitation, food, and social 
workers; and our teachers, our teach-
ers, our teachers. They make our lives 
possible at the State and local level 
and will facilitate the distribution of 
the vaccine in a fair and equitable 
manner. We owe them more. 
Many of our essential workers are 
from communities of color and low 
wealth, which have been devastatingly 
and disproportionately affected by the 
coronavirus. They have been there for 
us; we must be there for them. 
With President-elect Biden and Vice 
President-elect 
HARRIS, 
who 
were 
elected 2 months ago from today, the 
House will continue our work to save 
lives and livelihoods, to build back bet-
ter in a way that advances justice in 
America. 
Indeed, the pandemic has pulled back 
the curtain and shown even worsened 
disparities in our economy and our so-
ciety. We must pursue justice: eco-
nomic justice, justice in health, racial 
justice, environmental and climate jus-
tice—the list goes on. 
Every morning in this Chamber, we 
take the pledge: One nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for 
all. 
‘‘Liberty and justice for all.’’ Every 
day, this Congress must live up to that 
pledge. 
To advance justice, I am establishing 
the bipartisan Select Committee on 
Economic Disparity and Fairness in 
Growth to combat the disparities of in-
come and wealth that undermine faith 
in America’s promise for a better fu-
ture for our children. Working with the 
committees of jurisdiction, the select 
committee will recommend proposals 
that power fair economic growth to 
make our economy work for everyone. 
In all that we do, let us be For the 
People, recognizing the beautiful diver-
sity of America so that no one is left

out and no one is left behind. We do so 
guided by the vision of our Founders, 
the sacrifice of our military and their 
families, and the aspirations that we 
all have for the children. 
To do so, we need God’s blessing. May 
God bless all of us. God bless all of you. 
God bless our men and women in uni-
form, our servicemembers and their 
families, our veterans. And may God 
bless America. 
Thank you all very much. It is my 
honor. 
As Speaker, I am now ready to take 
the oath of office. I usually do so sur-
rounded by children, but, of course, 
COVID has prevented that. But they 
are our purpose—for the children. 
I ask the dean of the House of Rep-
resentatives, the Honorable DON YOUNG 
from Alaska, to administer the oath of 
office. 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, before 
I issue the oath, I would like to take 
privilege on the floor as the dean. 
I have been in this House longer than 
anybody else. I have served with you 
longer than anybody else has served 
with you. I love this institution. I will 
be honest: I do not like what I see. It is 
time we hold hands and talk to one an-
other. 
Madam Speaker, I say this with all 
sincerity: You will be the Speaker of 
the House, not of a party. 
And that may hurt some of you. The 
job of our Nation is for the House of 
Representatives to govern this Nation. 
It was never meant to be the executive 
branch. It was never meant to be the 
judicial branch. It is this House that 
raises the money and dedicates how it 
shall be spent. And we are representing 
the people, as we were elected. 
b 1745 
And I say this with all sincerity, 
Madam Speaker, that when you do 
have a problem or there is something 
so contentious, let’s sit down and have 
a drink and solve those problems for 
the good of this Nation, for this insti-
tution, and, as you said, for the future 
children of this great Nation. We can 
do it as a body. As the dean to the new 
Speaker, I ask you to try to attempt to 
do that. With our leader, we can do it 
together. 
If the gentlewoman from California 
will please raise her right hand. 
Mr. YOUNG
then administered the 
oath of office to Ms. PELOSI of Cali-
fornia, as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear that you will sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic; that you will bear true faith 
and allegiance to the same; that you take 
this obligation freely, without any mental 
reservation or purpose of evasion; and that 
you will well and faithfully discharge the du-
ties of the office on which you are about to 
enter, so help you God. 
(Applause, the Members rising.) 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, Con-
gratulations. 
The SPEAKER. I thank the dean. 
SWEARING IN OF DEAN 
The SPEAKER. I am honored to be 
sworn in by the dean, the gentleman 
from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG), my friend of 
many years. Thank you for your guid-
ance. And, again, I don’t drink, but I 
am happy to have ice cream with any-
body anytime. 
The Chair will now swear in the gen-
tleman from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG). 
The Speaker administered the oath 
of office to Mr. YOUNG as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you 
will support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic; that you will bear true 
faith and allegiance to the same; that you 
take this obligation freely, without any 
mental reservation or purpose of evasion; 
and that you will well and faithfully dis-
charge the duties of the office on which you 
are about to enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations. You 
are now a Member of the 117th Con-
gress.

Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and 
Wisconsin. 
The SPEAKER. Under the prece-

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER (during the vote). As 
we have seen, all Members have not 
voted; but I hope, in the next few mo-
ments, they will have voted, Members- 
elect. 
Before we settle, though, I want to 
make an announcement. 
When we swear in the freshmen, the 
first-time Members-elect, anyone else 
who is in the room may raise his or her 
hand and take the oath of office as 
well. And then, after that, I want to 
note that, with the new Members-elect, 
you all have to walk down the aisle 
there to sign the oath card. 
Once again, before I close the vote— 
and it is clear that some more Mem-
bers-elect need to vote—to new Mem-
bers-elect, head over here sooner so 
that it can end sooner. 
When we swear in the Members-elect, 
the new, first-time Members-elect who 
will be here, when we swear them in, 
anyone else who is in the room may 
raise his or her hand and take the oath 
as well. 
However, then when you leave here, 
whether you do it now—I mean, after 
you have been sworn in or you are 
doing it in the series, you must leave 
through this door and go sign the oath 
card. After you get sworn in, you must 
leave and go sign the card that you 
have been sworn in, out that door. So 
that will save you some time, if you 
wish. 
We still have a number of Members- 
elect who have not voted yet, so we 
cannot do the swearing in until that 
happens. But to our new Members- 
elect, observe that it is important to 
vote early, because we don’t usually 
keep it open this long. 
b 1834 
Messrs. 
PALAZZO 
and 
REED 
changed their vote from ‘‘nay’’ to 
‘‘yea.’’ 
So the resolution was agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
Stated for: 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, the vote was 
gaveled down before my group (5) was called 
to the floor. Had I been present, I would have 
voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 3. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, the vote was 
gaveled down before my group 6 was ever 
called. Had I been present, I would have voted 
‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 3. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I was 
detained and missed rollcall Vote No. 3. Had 
I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on 
rollcall No. 3. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. Will the new Mem-
bers-elect come forward to be sworn in. 
As was said, due to the ongoing pan-
demic, the Chair will swear in remain-
ing Members-elect in groups. The Chair 
will now swear in the group of first- 
term Members-elect present in the 
Chamber. 
And as I announced, all Members- 
elect who are in the Chamber who wish 
to raise their hand and take the oath 
are welcome to do so. 
f 
SWEARING IN OF MEMBERS 
The SPEAKER. The Members-elect 
will rise and raise their right hand. 
The Members-elect rose, and the 
Speaker administered the oath of office 
to them as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear that you will sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic; that you will bear true faith 
and allegiance to the same; that you take 
this obligation freely, without any mental 
reservation or purpose of evasion; and that 
you will well and faithfully discharge the du-
ties of the office on which you are about to 
enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you 
are now Members of the 117th Congress. 
Will Members who have been sworn 
in please clear the Chamber so that we 
can swear in the next group. Thank 
you. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair is prepared 
to swear in the group of Members-elect 
currently in the Chamber. The Mem-
bers-elect will rise. 
The Chair will now administer the 
oath of office. All Members-elect will 
raise their right hand. 
The Members-elect rose, and the 
Speaker administered the oath of office 
to them as follows:

port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic; that you will bear true faith

this obligation freely, without any mental 
reservation or purpose of evasion; and that 
you will well and faithfully discharge the du-
ties of the office on which you are about to 
enter, so help you God. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The swearing in cere-
mony will be at 7:05 of any remaining 
Members-elect who have not been 
sworn in. So if you are in your office, 
or whatever, come on over now because 
we want to proceed with other busi-
ness. 
This is the schedule as it was sched-
uled—last call. So thank you all, and I 
see we have some already here. 
We have about 6 more minutes. 
The Chair is prepared to swear in the 
group 
of 
Members-elect 
currently 
present in the Chamber. The Members- 
elect will rise. 
The Chair will now administer the 
oath of office. All Members-elect will 
raise their right hand.

ties of the office on which you are about to

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
WELCOMING MEMBERS OF THE 
SENATE 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
very briefly, I simply want to welcome 
all Senators on this first day of the 
117th Congress. 
Today, six new Members are joining 
our ranks for the first time. Senators 
HAGERTY
from 
Tennessee, 
HICKENLOOPER from Colorado, LUJA´ N of 
New Mexico, LUMMIS
of Wyoming, 
MARSHALL of Kansas, and TUBERVILLE 
of Alabama have been elected to serve 
the people of their home States, and, of 
course, Senator KELLY of Arizona was 
sworn in a few weeks ago. We congratu-
late all of our new colleagues, as well 
as their families, and look forward to 
the ways in which their unique experi-
ences, their ideas, and their priorities 
will 
enrich 
this 
institution 
and 
strengthen our shared work for the Na-
tion. 
To say the 117th Congress convenes 
at a challenging time would indeed be 
an understatement. From political di-
vision to a deadly pandemic, to adver-
saries around the world, the hurdles be-
fore us are many, and they are serious. 
But there is also plenty of reason for 
hope. An optimistic, forward-looking, 
can-do spirit has been one of our coun-
try’s most distinctive calling cards 
since our very earliest days. And with 
safe and effective vaccines rolling out 
across our Nation every day, I would 
say 2021 looks bright already. 
We gavel in today like 116 prior Sen-
ates have gaveled in before us, with 
plenty of disagreements and policy dif-
ferences among our ranks but all—all— 
swearing the same oath to support and 
defend the same Constitution, all lov-
ing the same country, and all of us 
committed to do all we can to leave be-
hind an even stronger nation than the 
one we have been blessed to inherit. 
So I look forward to the Senate’s 
work these next 2 years. Let’s make 
the American people proud.
