f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LOWENTHAL) come 
forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. LOWENTHAL led the Pledge of 
Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS’ WEEK 
(Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in observance of Gun Violence Sur-
vivors’ Week. 
For all those who have lost their 
lives due to gun violence, there are 
thousands more who experience trau-
ma, loss, and suffering. 
In a recent poll, 58 percent of Amer-
ican adults reported that they or some-
one that they care for have experienced 
gun violence. That statistic is shock-
ing, and it is also shameful. No other 
wealthy country faces a gun violence 
epidemic on this scale. 
The House has passed strong bipar-
tisan bills to reduce gun violence. Ma-
jority Leader MCCONNELL and the gun 
lobby continue to block this legisla-
tion. The obstruction is outrageous. It 
fails to honor the legacy of the sur-
vivors that we honor this week. 
I know we can do better. We simply 
must do better. 
f 
RECOGNIZING JESSIE CRAFT OF 
REAGAN HIGH SCHOOL 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jes-
sie Craft, an exemplary Latin teacher 
at Reagan High School in Pfafftown, 
North Carolina. 
Simply put, Jessie goes the extra 
mile to provide his students with a 
high-quality education. Instead of rely-
ing only on textbook instruction, he 
crafts lesson plans that meet the 
unique needs of his students. From cre-
ating online language tutorial videos 
to reading and speaking entirely in 
Latin, Jessie keeps his students en-
gaged while unlocking new ways to 
help them learn pertinent material. 
His novel approach serves as a re-
minder that when educational innova-
tion is deliberately exercised, students 
succeed. 
Reagan High School is fortunate to 
have Jessie Craft as a teacher, and I 
am confident that he will continue to 
impact the lives of students now and in 
the future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H756 
February 4, 2020 
HONORING JERSEY CITY POLICE 
DETECTIVE JOSEPH SEALS 
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, on 
December 10, armed extremists, tar-
geting Jewish Americans and law en-
forcement, gunned down four people in 
Jersey City, including Jersey City Po-
lice Detective Joseph Seals. 
Today, I am joined by his daughter, 
Hailey, as my State of the Union guest. 
I want to thank her for her commit-
ment to her father’s legacy and for 
joining us in honoring him. 
Detective Seals was a veteran of the 
Jersey City police force and was a lead-
ing officer in the effort to get guns off 
the street. He was a good man and a 
good father. He worked every day try-
ing to make New Jersey safer for all of 
us and I am glad we have a chance to 
recognize him. 
But I also believe that we owe his 
family more than just recognition, 
more than just remembrance. We owe 
them a dedicated effort to confront do-
mestic extremism as seriously as we 
have rightly confronted international 
terrorism, with more resources for law 
enforcement, stronger gun laws, great-
er scrutiny of social media companies 
that monetize hatred online, and zero 
tolerance for politicians who exploit 
that hatred for political ends. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
DISABLED 
AMERICAN VETERANS 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate and thank 
the Disabled Veterans of the World 
War, now the Disabled Veterans of 
America, on its 100th anniversary. 
It was founded in 1920 and headed by 
World War I veteran and Cincinnati 
Judge Robert S. Marx. The DAV has 
stood as an organization of disabled 
veterans serving veterans as they make 
that critical transition from military 
life to civilian life. 
As Marx said of the need of the DAV, 
‘‘We had a common experience which 
bound us together, and we ought to 
continue through an organization of 
our own . . . an organization of us, by 
us, and for us.’’ 
With 1.2 million members, the DAV 
has grown into one of the foremost vet-
erans’ service organizations in our 
country. 
Arkansas DAV Commander Charlie 
Brown, who served for more than 26 
years in the U.S. Air Force, in both 
Desert Storm and in Vietnam, has 
helped lead our State’s fight in support 
of America’s injured veterans and their 
families. 
I would like to extend my congratu-
lations to the entire Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans family and wish them 
continued success for generations to 
come. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
TELEMACHUS 
ORFANOS WHO WAS KILLED IN 
THE BORDERLINE SHOOTING 
(Ms. BROWNLEY of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. 
Speaker, during National Gun Violence 
Survivors’ Week, I stand before you to 
call attention to the tragic impact of 
gun violence on our Nation. 
On November 7, 2018, Ventura County 
was forever altered by the Borderline 
shooting, which took the lives of 12 in-
dividuals. 
Telemachus Orfanos, a U.S. Navy 
veteran, survived the Las Vegas shoot-
ing only to be killed 1 year later at 
Borderline. Tel died a hero, rushing to 
save others when gunfire erupted. 
Today, I am joined by his mother, 
Susan, whose presence is a reminder of 
the far too many families grieving the 
loss of their loved ones. 
Since the Borderline shooting, an es-
timated 45,000 people have died from 
gun violence, and the Senate still re-
fuses to act. Tel and all victims of gun 
violence deserve better. They deserve 
much better. 
The Senate must act. The lives of 
every American depend upon it. 
f 
ACHIEVEMENTS 
OF 
THE 
PRESI-
DENT 
FROM 
THE 
VANTAGE 
POINT OF THE WHITE HOUSE 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, as the President in the State 
of the Union reviews his achievements 
from the vantage point of the White 
House, I have lived his successes on the 
ground level, in South Carolina and 
overseas. 
In Orangeburg, his Opportunity Zone 
legislation with Senator TIM SCOTT has 
prompted a $20 million spec building 
for jobs. 
In Munich, Germany, with Senator 
LINDSEY
GRAHAM, I saw his urging 
NATO defense spending. 
In Aiken, Chancellor Sandra Jordan 
has achieved the funding for the Ad-
vanced Manufacturing Collaborative in 
USC-Aiken. 
In New Delhi, India, and also in 
Houston, 
Prime 
Minister 
Narendra 
Modi assured his alliance with Presi-
dent Trump. 
In Cayce, Lou Kennedy of Nephron 
Pharmaceuticals continues her success, 
growing over 2,000 jobs. 
And in Manama, Bahrain, it was 
heartwarming to see our Arab allies 
appreciate peace through strength. 
In Columbia, I joined Governor Henry 
McMaster to visit Fort Jackson to 
meet our reinforced troops. 
In Krakow, Poland, our allies appre-
ciate the 5,000 U.S. troops to stop Putin 
aggression. 
In Barnwell, foreign investments at 
Swiss Krono have reached half a billion 
dollars. 
In Israel, citizens are more grateful 
for the President’s moving of the Em-
bassy to Jerusalem. 
Our prayers for Rush Limbaugh, an 
American icon of truth telling. 
f 
JOIN US TO IMPROVE THE STATE 
OF HEALTHCARE 
(Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, as I 
walked over to the floor, I left a group 
of workers in my office who were 
scared to death that we were going 
back to the days that people with dia-
betes, high blood pressure, or heart 
issues, must fear being denied cov-
erage, or have premiums too high that 
they could not afford. 
Tonight, House Democrats are bring-
ing more than 80 patients, doctors, and 
healthcare advocates from across the 
country as guests to the State of the 
Union to shine a light on our fight to 
improve the ‘‘State of Healthcare.’’ 
We must stop this disastrous lawsuit 
that strikes down protections for peo-
ple with pre-existing conditions, but 
also would eliminate every last protec-
tion and benefit provided by the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
At the same time, House Democrats 
have passed 11 bills to lower prescrip-
tion drug prices, protect people with 
pre-existing conditions, and strengthen 
Medicare and Medicaid. 
We are ready and willing to work 
with anyone who will come to the 
table. Please work with us to improve 
the State of Healthcare in this coun-
try. 
f 
HONORING OFFICER JASON 
DOBBINS 
(Mr. BANKS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Police Officer 
Jason Dobbins. 
Sixteen years ago, Officer Dobbins 
began working in law enforcement. In 
2012, he transferred to the Warsaw Po-
lice Department, where he followed in 
the footsteps of his father, Ted, who 
also served as a police officer in the 
City of Warsaw for 20 years. 
In the wake of his tragic passing last 
Saturday, Officer Dobbins is mourned 
by the Warsaw Police Department, and 
by the whole of Warsaw, who remember 
him as a great leader, father, and 
friend. 
And as Warsaw Mayor Joe Thallemer 
told me just earlier today in a text 
message, he said, ‘‘The overwhelming, 
immediate outpouring of support is 
testimony to his commitment to the 
well-being of the Warsaw community. 
His legacy of service lives on.’’ 
It is people like Jason Dobbins who 
embody the very best of what our Na-
tion has to offer.

February 4, 2020 
I offer my deepest condolences to his 
wife, his son, his three daughters, and 
his stepson in this sad time, and I pray 
that they may find peace. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE JULY 20, 2012, 
AURORA THEATRE MASSACRE 
(Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in remembrance of victims 
of gun violence. 
Gun violence rips through a commu-
nity, leaving trauma with the families 
and friends of the victims, the medical 
staff, the first responders, and the en-
tire community for a lifetime. It is a 
trauma and a scar too many commu-
nities in Colorado have faced, as well 
as the rest of the Nation. 
I represented Aurora, Colorado, on 
July 20, 2012, during the Aurora The-
atre massacre. I will never forget the 
victims and the families impacted by 
that tragedy, including, A.J. Boik, 18; 
Jon Blunk; Jesse Childress; Gordon 
Cowden, who died protecting his chil-
dren; Jessica Ghawi; John Larimer; 
Matt 
McQuinn; 
Micayla 
Medek; 
Veronica Moser-Sullivan, only 6 years 
old; Alex Sullivan; Alexander Teves; 
and Rebecca Wingo. 
These people died far too young. 
These stories are just a few of the 36,000 
Americans killed each year, and 100,000 
Americans shot and injured by fire-
arms. We cannot let this type of vio-
lence and tragedy rip through another 
community. 
Let’s make 2020 the year we finally 
honor these victims with action.

CELEBRATING GHOST TOWN TRAIL 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
the Ghost Town Trail that runs be-
tween Ebensburg and Blairsville, Penn-
sylvania. The Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Conservation and Natural Re-
sources recently named the Ghost 
Town Trail the Pennsylvania Trail of 
the Year. 
As a lifelong Pennsylvanian and avid 
outdoorsman, I am proud the 15th Dis-
trict is leading the way in developing 
and growing Pennsylvania’s extensive 
trail network. It is important we cul-
tivate an appreciation of the outdoors. 
We know trails are environmentally 
friendly, but they also are economi-
cally friendly. Trails boost real estate 
values. They present new business op-
portunities and bolster tourist-related 
revenue. The 44-mile long Ghost Town 
Trail provides all of these benefits. 
According to some experts, if it con-
tinues on its current trajectory, it will 
be the first trail in the East to connect 
in a full loop. 
The Trail of the Year award is well 
deserved for the Ghost Town Trail, and 
I am proud to recognize it here today. 
f 
COMMONSENSE GUN REFORM 
NEEDED 
(Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speak-
er, every day, dozens of Americans lose 
their lives to guns. If a virus killed doz-
ens of Americans each day, we would 
treat it as a public health emergency. 
But despite that loss of life from gun 
violence, our country has failed to im-
plement commonsense gun reform. 
One of those solutions is my bill, the 
COOL OFF Act, which would establish 
a 3-day waiting period on all handgun 
sales, to take the passion out of crimes 
of passion. 
Research has shown waiting periods 
reduce murders by 17 percent and sui-
cides by 10 percent. A national waiting 
period would save hundreds if not thou-
sands of lives each year by preventing 
handgun sales to those motivated to-
ward crimes of passion. 
Thousands of Americans have died as 
we have waited to pass gun reform. By 
passing the COOL OFF Act, we can en-
sure that a wait of just 3 days starts to 
save lives. 
f 
CONGRESS SHOULD GET BACK TO 
WORK 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, tomor-
row will be the culmination of a very 
predictable series of events. 
There were never 67 votes to convict 
the President. There was never any bi-
partisan 
support 
for 
impeachment. 
This contrived process was never going 
to be successful, and everybody knew 
it. 
When House Democrats, first in a 
hurry in December to get the articles 
through, and then after a month’s 
delay sent the articles over to the Sen-
ate, they claimed their case was com-
pelling and overwhelming, yet their 
case had zero actual evidence and was 
made only of opinion or speculation or 
third-hand comments. 
Then the Democrat impeachment 
managers asked for more witnesses in 
order to prove their case that they had 
rushed through the House. Pure hypoc-
risy. The same has surrounded this en-
tire so-called process. 
From quid pro quo to extortion to 
bribery, 
they 
have 
continuously 
grasped for straws—the same straws 
they try to ban in California, by the 
way—that would make their narrative 
more compelling. 
Here we are, over 4 months since this 
inquiry was announced, yet they found 
not a way to convince Americans that 
the President has committed an actual 
crime. 
Once the Senate votes to acquit the 
President, we must get back to work 
and do actual things. 
f 
AWARD DORIS MILLER WITH 
MEDAL OF HONOR 
(Ms. JOHNSON of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today during Black History 
Month to recognize the life and legacy 
of Doris Miller. 
Miller was stationed on the USS West 
Virginia during the attack at Pearl 
Harbor. Once the attack began, Miller 
left his role in the kitchen to rescue 
shipmates and provide cover fire. 
News hit Waco, Texas, where I was a 
little girl, that said he helped to stop 
the U.S. invasion by the Japanese. Mil-
ler was awarded the Navy Cross for his 
heroics, though his actions unquestion-
ably merited the Medal of Honor. 
I recently attended a ceremony at 
Pearl Harbor with the Acting Sec-
retary of the Navy to announce the 
naming of the future aircraft carrier in 
his honor. This will be the first aircraft 
carrier named for an African American 
sailor. It is appreciated, but it is not 
the Medal of Honor. 
I have introduced H.R. 5549, the Doris 
Miller Medal of Honor Act of 2020. This 
bill would waive the statute of limita-
tions to upgrade Miller’s Navy Cross to 
the Medal of Honor. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
SHELDON WHITEMAN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of 
Long County Deputy Sheriff Sheldon 
Whiteman, who died in the line of duty 
on January 23 at the age of 44. 
Deputy Whiteman was assisting in a 
vehicle pursuit in the First Congres-
sional District of Georgia when his ve-
hicle left the roadway. Deputy White-
man had been with the Long County 
Sheriff’s Office for only 4 months at 
the time of the incident. 
Previously, 
Deputy 
Whiteman 
worked with the Chatham County Po-
lice Department and was a POST Cer-
tified Peace Officer since 2016. 
Deputy Whiteman is survived by his 
wife, Alisa Ann, and his three sons. 
It is, unfortunately, times like these 
when we remember the risks that our 
law enforcement officers take every 
day that they put on their uniforms. I 
encourage everyone to take some time 
to thank our law enforcement officers 
for the work they do to keep our com-
munities safe. 
Deputy 
Whiteman’s 
family 
and 
friends, as well as the Long County and 
Chatham County police departments 
will be in my thoughts and prayers 
during these most difficult times.

RECOGNIZING THE TOLL GUN 
VIOLENCE TAKES ON SURVIVORS 
(Ms. SPEIER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the toll that gun vi-
olence takes on survivors left to strug-
gle in the wake of unspeakable trag-
edy. 
When we talk about gun violence, we 
usually focus on lives lost, but the full 
cost of gun violence is measured in the 
lives irreparably changed by physical 
and mental wounds. Survivors are the 
students who hid under desks and in 
closets at their schools, domestic vio-
lence victims who tried to hold front 
doors shut and shield their children, 
and families left with holes where 
loved ones used to be. I know because I 
am a gun violence survivor. 
According to Everytown, 58 percent 
of Americans have witnessed or been 
threatened with gun violence or know 
someone who has. This is National Gun 
Violence Survivors Week. Let’s honor 
survivors by refusing to let their expe-
riences become the new normal. 
f 
RURAL AMERICANS NEED ACCESS 
TO EMERGENCY CARE 
(Mr. GREEN of Tennessee asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, over the past decade, more than 100 
rural hospitals have been forced to 
close their doors, including 12 hospitals 
in Tennessee. These communities are 
now left without access to healthcare 
in general, let alone emergency care. 
Many rural hospitals across the Na-
tion continue to face significant finan-
cial difficulties. As this crisis con-
tinues at a growing rate, current Fed-
eral regulations stand in the way, only 
allowing a free-standing emergency de-
partment within 35 miles of a hospital. 
My bill, the Rural ER Access Act, 
would repeal this ridiculous 35-mile 
rule to permit free-standing emergency 
departments to operate in the rural 
communities that need them the most. 
As an emergency medicine physician, 
I believe that we should and can make 
sure that rural Americans are not left 
without access to emergency care be-
cause of some unnecessary bureau-
cratic regulation.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CLAY). Pursuant to clause 4 of rule I, 
the following enrolled bills were signed 
by Speaker pro tempore MATSUI
on 
Monday, February 3, 2020: 
S. 153, to promote veteran involve-
ment in STEM education, computer 
science, and scientific research; 
S. 3201, to extend the temporary 
scheduling order for fentanyl-related 
substances. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. After 
consultation among the Speaker and 
the majority and minority leaders, and 
with their consent, the Chair an-
nounces that, when the two Houses 
meet tonight in joint session to hear 
an address by the President of the 
United States, only the doors imme-
diately opposite the Speaker and those 
immediately to her left and right will 
be open. 
No one will be allowed on the floor of 
the House who does not have the privi-
lege of the floor of the House. Due to 
the large attendance that is antici-
pated, the rule regarding the privilege 
of the floor must be strictly enforced. 
Children of Members will not be per-
mitted on the floor. The cooperation of 
all Members is requested. 
The practice of purporting to reserve 
seats prior to the joint session by 
placement of placards or personal 
items will not be allowed. Chamber Se-
curity may remove these items from 
the seats. Members may reserve their 
seats only by physical presence fol-
lowing the security sweep of the Cham-
ber. 
All Members are reminded to refrain 
from engaging in still photography or 
audio or video recording in the Cham-
ber. Taking unofficial photographs de-
tracts from the dignity of the pro-
ceedings and presents security and pri-
vacy challenges for the House.

RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until ap-
proximately 8:35 p.m. for the purpose of

of the United States. 
Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 26 min-

The President of the United States, 
escorted by the committee of Senators 
and Representatives, entered the Hall

stood at the Clerk’s desk. 
(Applause, the Members rising.) 
The SPEAKER. Members of Con-
gress, the President of the United 
States. 
(Applause, the Members rising.) 
The PRESIDENT. Madam Speaker, 
Mr. Vice President, Members of Con-
gress, the First Lady of the United 
States, and my fellow citizens, 3 years 
ago, we launched the great American 
comeback. Tonight, I stand before you 
to share the incredible results. Jobs are 
booming; incomes are soaring; poverty 
is plummeting; crime is falling; con-
fidence is surging; and our country is 
thriving and highly respected again. 
America’s enemies are on the run; 
America’s fortunes are on the rise; and 
America’s future is blazing bright. 
The years of economic decay are 
over. The days of our country being 
used, taken advantage of, and even 
scorned by other nations are long be-
hind us. 
Gone too are the broken promises, 
jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and 
constant excuses for the depletion of 
American wealth, power, and prestige. 
In just 3 short years, we have shat-
tered the mentality of American de-
cline, 
and 
we 
have 
rejected 
the 
downsizing of America’s destiny. We 
have totally rejected the downsizing. 
We are moving forward at a pace that 
was unimaginable just a short time 
ago, and we are never, ever going back. 
I am thrilled to report to you tonight 
that our economy is the best it has 
ever been. Our military is completely 
rebuilt with its power being unmatched 
anywhere in the world—and it is not 
even close. Our borders are secure. Our 
families are flourishing. Our values are 
renewed. Our pride is restored. And for 
all of these reasons, I say to the people 
of our great country and to the Mem-
bers of Congress: The state of our 
union is stronger than ever before. 
The vision I will lay out this evening 
demonstrates how we are building the 
world’s most prosperous and inclusive 
society, one where every citizen can 
join in America’s unparalleled success 
and where every community can take 
part in America’s extraordinary rise. 
From the instant I took office, I 
moved rapidly to revive the U.S. econ-
omy: slashing a record number of job- 
killing regulations, enacting historic 
and record-setting tax cuts, and fight-
ing for fair and reciprocal trade agree-
ments. 
Our agenda is relentlessly pro-work-
er, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most 
of all, pro-American. 
Thank you. 
We are advancing with unbridled op-
timism and lifting our citizens of every 
race, color, religion, and creed very, 
very high. 
Since my election, we have created 7 
million new jobs, 5 million more than 
government experts projected during 
the previous administration. The un-
employment rate is the lowest in over 
half a century. 
And very incredibly, the average un-
employment rate under my administra-
tion is lower than any administration 
in the history of our country. If we 
hadn’t reversed the failed economic 
policies of the previous administration, 
the world would not now be witnessing 
this great economic success. 
The unemployment rates for African 
Americans, Hispanic Americans, and 
Asian Americans has reached the low-
est levels in history. 
African American youth unemploy-
ment has reached an all-time low. Afri-
can American poverty has declined to 
the lowest rate ever recorded. 
The unemployment rate for women 
reached the lowest level in almost 70 
years, and last year, women filled 72 
percent of all new jobs added. 
The veterans’ unemployment rate 
dropped to a record low. 
The unemployment rate for disabled 
Americans has reached an all-time low. 
Workers without a high school di-
ploma have achieved the lowest unem-
ployment rate recorded in U.S. history. 
A record number of young Americans 
are now employed. 
Under the last administration, more 
than 10 million people were added to 
the food stamp rolls. Under my admin-
istration, 7 million Americans have 
come off food stamps, and 10 million 
people have been lifted off of welfare. 
In 8 years under the last administra-
tion, over 300,000 working-age people 
dropped out of the workforce. In just 3 
years of my administration, 3.5 million 
people, working-age people, have joined 
the workforce. 
Since my election, the net worth of 
the bottom half of wage earners has in-
creased by 47 percent—three times fast-
er than the increase for the top 1 per-
cent. 
After decades of flat and falling in-
comes, wages are rising fast—and, won-
derfully, they are rising fastest for low- 
income workers, who have seen a 16 
percent pay increase since my election. 
This is a blue-collar boom. 
Real median household income is 
now at the highest level ever recorded. 
Since my election, U.S. stock mar-
kets have soared 70 percent, adding 
more than $12 trillion to our Nation’s 
wealth, transcending anything anyone 
believed was possible. This is a record. 
It is something that every country in 
the world is looking up to, they ad-
mire. 
Consumer 
confidence 
has 
just 
reached amazing new highs. All of 
those millions of people with 401(k)s 
and pensions are doing far better than 
they have ever done before, with in-
creases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 percent 
and even more. 
Jobs and investments are pouring 
into 9,000 previously neglected neigh-
borhoods thanks to opportunity zones, 
a plan spearheaded by Senator TIM 
SCOTT as part of our great Republican 
tax cuts. In other words, wealthy peo-
ple and companies are pouring money 
into poor neighborhoods or areas that 
haven’t seen investment in many dec-
ades, creating jobs, energy, and excite-
ment. This is the first time that these 
deserving communities have seen any-
thing like this. It is all working. 
Opportunity zones are helping Ameri-
cans like Army veteran Tony Rankins 
from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling 
with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, 
his house, and his family. He was 
homeless. But then Tony found a con-
struction company that invests in op-
portunity zones. He is now a top 
tradesman, drug free, reunited with his 
family, and he is here tonight. 
Tony, keep up the great work. Thank 
you, Tony. 
Our roaring economy has, for the 
first time ever, given many former 
prisoners the ability to get a great job 
and a fresh start. This second chance 
at life is made possible because we 
passed landmark criminal justice re-
form into law. 
Everybody said that criminal justice 
reform couldn’t be done, but I got it 
done and the people in this room got it 
done. 
Thanks to our bold regulatory reduc-
tion campaign, the United States has 
become the number one producer of oil 
and natural gas anywhere in the world, 
by far. With the tremendous progress 
we have made over the past 3 years, 
America is now energy independent, 
and energy jobs, like so many other 
elements of our country, are at a 
record high. We are doing numbers that 
no one would have thought possible 
just 3 years ago. 
Likewise, we are restoring our Na-
tion’s 
manufacturing 
might, 
even 
though predictions were, as you all 
know, that this could never ever be 
done. 
After losing 60,000 factories under the 
previous two administrations, America 
has now gained 12,000 new factories 
under my administration, with thou-
sands upon thousands of plants and fac-
tories being planned or being built. 
Companies are not leaving, they are 
coming back to the U.S.A. The fact is 
that everybody wants to be where the 
action is, and the United States of 
America is indeed the place where the 
action is. 
One of the biggest promises I made to 
the American people was to replace the 
disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact,

unfair trade is perhaps the single big-
gest reason that I decided to run for 
President. 
Following NAFTA’s adoption, our 
Nation lost one in four manufacturing 
jobs. Many politicians came and went, 
pledging to change or replace NAFTA, 
only to do so and then absolutely noth-
ing happened. But unlike so many who 
came before me, I keep my promises. 
We did our job. 
Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and 
signed the brand-new United States- 
Mexico-Canada Agreement into law. 
The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 
new high-paying American auto jobs 
and massively boost exports for our 
farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. 
It will also bring trade with Mexico 
and Canada to a much higher level, but 
also to a much greater degree of fair-
ness and reciprocity. We will have that: 
fairness and reciprocity. And I say 
that, finally, because it has been many, 
many years since we were treated fair-
ly on trade. 
This is the first major trade deal in 
many years to earn the strong backing 
of America’s labor unions. 
I also promised our citizens that I 
would impose tariffs to confront Chi-
na’s massive theft of America’s jobs. 
Our strategy has worked. Days ago, we 
signed the groundbreaking new agree-
ment with China that will defend our 
workers, protect our intellectual prop-
erty, bring billions and billions of dol-
lars into our Treasury, and open vast 
new markets for products made and 
grown right here in the USA. 
For decades, China has taken advan-
tage of the United States. Now we have 
changed that, but at the same time, we 
have perhaps the best relationship we 
have ever had with China, including 
with President Xi. 
They respect what we have done be-
cause, quite frankly, they could never 
really believe that they were able to 
get away with what they were doing 
year after year, decade after decade 
without someone in our country step-
ping up and saying: That is enough. 
Now we want to rebuild our country, 
and that is exactly what we are doing. 
We are rebuilding our country. 
As we restore American leadership 
throughout the world, we are once 
again standing up for freedom in our 
hemisphere. That is why my adminis-
tration reversed the failing policies of 
the previous administration on Cuba. 
We are supporting the hopes of Cu-
bans, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to 
restore democracy. 
The United States is leading a 59-na-
tion diplomatic coalition against the 
socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolas 
Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate 
ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his peo-
ple, but Maduro’s grip on tyranny will 
be smashed and broken. 
Here this evening is a very brave man 
who 
carries 
with 
him 
the 
hopes, 
dreams, and aspirations of all Ven-
ezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is 
the true and legitimate president of 
Venezuela, Juan Guaido. 
Mr. President, please take this mes-
sage back to your homeland. Thank 
you, Mr. President. It is a great honor. 
Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, please take this mes-
sage back, that all Americans are 
united with the Venezuelan people in 
their righteous struggle for freedom. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Socialism destroys nations, but al-
ways remember, freedom unifies the 
soul. 
To safeguard American liberty, we 
have invested a record-breaking $2.2 
trillion in the United States military. 
We have purchased the finest planes, 
missiles, rockets, ships, and every 
other form of military equipment. And 
it is all made right here in the U.S.A. 
We are also getting our allies, fi-
nally, to help pay their fair share. I 
have raised contributions from other 
NATO members by more than $400 bil-
lion, and the number of allies meeting 
their minimum obligations has more 
than doubled. 
Just weeks ago, for the first time 
since President Truman established the 
Air Force more than 70 years earlier, 
we created a brand-new branch of the 
United States Armed Forces. It is 
called the Space Force. It is very im-
portant. 
In the gallery tonight, we have a 13- 
year-old 
young 
gentleman, 
Iain 
Lanphier. He is an eighth grader from 
Arizona. 
Iain, please stand up. 
Iain has always dreamed of going to 
space. He was the first in his class and 
among the youngest at an aviation 
academy. He aspires to go to the Air 
Force Academy, and then he has his 
eye on the Space Force. As Iain says: 
‘‘Most people look up at space. I want 
to look down on the world.’’ 
Sitting behind Iain tonight is his 
greatest hero of them all, Charles 
McGee, who was born in Cleveland, 
Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of 
the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, 
the first Black fighter pilots, and he 
also happens to be Iain’s great-grand-
father. 
It is an incredible story. After more 
than 130 combat missions in World War 
II, he came back home to a country 
still struggling for civil rights and 
went on to serve America in Korea and 
Vietnam. 
On December 7, Charles celebrated 
his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I 
signed a bill promoting Charles McGee 
to brigadier general, and earlier today, 
I pinned the stars on his shoulders in 
the Oval Office. 
General McGee, our Nation salutes 
you, and I thank you, sir. 
From the Pilgrims to the Founders, 
from the soldiers at Valley Forge to 
the marchers at Selma, and from Presi-
dent Lincoln to the Reverend Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr., Americans have 
always rejected limits on our children’s 
future. 
Members of Congress, we must never 
forget that the only victories that mat-
ter in Washington are victories that 
deliver for the American people. The 
people are the heart of our country. 
Their dreams are the soul of our coun-
try, and their love is what powers and 
sustains our country. We must always 
remember that our job is to put Amer-
ica first. 
The next step forward in building an 
inclusive society is making sure that 
every young American gets a great 
education 
and 
the 
opportunity 
to 
achieve the American Dream. 
Yet, for too long, countless American 
children have been trapped in failing 
government schools. To rescue these 
students, 18 States have created school 
choice in the form of Opportunity 
Scholarships. Their programs are so 
popular that tens of thousands of stu-
dents remain on a waiting list. 
One of those students is Janiyah 
Davis, a fourth grader from Philadel-
phia. Janiyah’s mom, Stephanie, is a 
single parent. She would do anything 
to give her daughter a better future. 
But last year, that future was put fur-
ther out of reach when Pennsylvania’s 
Governor vetoed legislation to expand 
school 
choice 
to 
50,000 
children. 
Janiyah and Stephanie are in the gal-
lery. 
Stephanie, thank you so much for 
being here with your beautiful daugh-
ter. 
Janiyah, I have some good news for 
you because I am pleased to inform you 
that your long wait is over. I can 
proudly announce tonight that an Op-
portunity 
Scholarship 
has 
become 
available. It is going to you, and you 
will soon be heading to the school of 
your choice. 
Now, I call on Congress to give 1 mil-
lion American children the same op-
portunity Janiyah has just received. 
Pass the Education Freedom Scholar-
ships and Opportunities Act because no 
parent should be forced to send their 
child to a failing government school. 
Every young person should have a 
safe and secure environment in which 
to learn and to grow. For this reason, 
our 
magnificent 
First 
Lady 
has 
launched the Be Best initiative to ad-
vance a safe, healthy, supportive, and 
drug-free life for the next generation, 
online, in school, and in our commu-
nities. 
Thank you, Melania, for your ex-
traordinary love and profound care for 
America’s children. Thank you very 
much. 
My administration is determined to 
give our citizens the opportunities they 
need, regardless of age or background. 
Through our pledge to American work-
ers, over 400 companies will also pro-
vide new jobs and education opportuni-
ties to almost 15 million Americans. 
My budget also contains an exciting 
vision for our Nation’s high schools. 
Tonight, I ask Congress to support our 
students and back my plan to offer vo-
cational and technical education in 
every single high school in America. 
To expand equal opportunity, I am 
also proud that we achieved record and 
permanent funding for our Nation’s

historically Black colleges and univer-
sities. 
A good life for American families 
also requires the most affordable, inno-
vative, and high-quality healthcare 
system on Earth. 
Before I took office, health insurance 
premiums had more than doubled in 
just 5 years. I moved quickly to provide 
affordable alternatives. Our new plans 
are up to 60 percent less expensive—and 
better. 
I have also made an ironclad pledge 
to American families: We will always 
protect patients with preexisting con-
ditions, and we will always protect 
your Medicare, and we will always pro-
tect your Social Security—always. 
The American patient should never 
be blindsided by medical bills. That is 
why I signed an executive order requir-
ing price transparency. 
Many experts believe that trans-
parency, which will go into full effect 
at the beginning of the next year, will 
be even bigger than healthcare reform. 
It will save families massive amounts 
of money for substantially better care. 
But as we work to improve Ameri-
cans’ healthcare, there are those who 
want to take away your healthcare, 
take away your doctor, and abolish pri-
vate insurance entirely. 132 lawmakers 
in this room have endorsed legislation 
to impose a socialist takeover of our 
healthcare system, wiping out the pri-
vate health insurance plans of 180 mil-
lion very happy Americans. To those 
watching at home tonight, I want you 
to know: We will never let socialism 
destroy American healthcare. 
Over 130 legislators in this Chamber 
have endorsed legislation that would 
bankrupt our Nation by providing free 
taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions 
of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to 
subsidize free care for anyone in the 
world who unlawfully crosses our bor-
ders. 
These proposals would raid the Medi-
care benefits of our seniors and that 
our seniors depend on, while acting as 
a powerful lure for illegal immigration. 
That is what is happening in California 
and other States. Their systems are to-
tally out of control, costing taxpayers 
vast 
and 
unaffordable 
amounts 
of 
money. 
If forcing American taxpayers to pro-
vide unlimited free healthcare to ille-
gal aliens sounds fair to you, then 
stand with the radical left. But if you 
believe that we should defend Amer-
ican patients and American seniors, 
then stand with me and pass legisla-
tion 
to 
prohibit 
free 
government 
healthcare for illegal aliens. 
This will be a tremendous boon to 
our already very strongly guarded 
southern border, where, as we speak, a 
long, tall, and very powerful wall is 
being built. We have now completed 
over 100 miles and will have over 500 
miles fully completed in a very short 
period of time. Early next year, we will 
have substantially more than 500 miles 
completed. 
My administration is also taking on 
the big pharmaceutical companies. We 
have approved a record number of af-
fordable generic drugs, and medicines 
are being approved by the FDA at a 
faster clip than ever before. And I was 
pleased to announce last year that, for 
the first time in 51 years, the cost of 
prescription drugs actually went down. 
And working together, Congress can 
reduce drug prices substantially from 
current levels. I have been speaking to 
Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY of Iowa and 
others in Congress in order to get 
something on drug pricing done, and 
done quickly and properly. I am calling 
for bipartisan legislation that achieves 
the goal of dramatically lowering pre-
scription drug prices. Get a bill on my 
desk, and I will sign it into law imme-
diately. 
With unyielding commitment, we are 
curbing the opioid epidemic. Drug 
overdose deaths declined for the first 
time in nearly 30 years. Among the 
States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 per-
cent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, 
Wisconsin is down 10 percent—and we 
will not quit until we have beaten the 
opioid epidemic once and for all. 
Protecting Americans’ health also 
means fighting infectious diseases. We 
are coordinating with the Chinese Gov-
ernment and working closely together 
on the coronavirus outbreak in China. 
My administration will take all nec-
essary steps to safeguard our citizens 
from this threat. 
We have launched ambitious, new ini-
tiatives to substantially improve care 
for Americans with kidney disease, 
Alzheimer’s, and those struggling with 
mental health. And because Congress 
was so good as to fund my request, we 
are pursuing new cures for childhood 
cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS 
epidemic in America by the end of this 
decade. 
Almost 
every 
American 
family 
knows the pain when a loved one is di-
agnosed with a serious illness. 
Here, tonight, is a special man, be-
loved by millions of Americans, who 
just received a stage IV advanced can-
cer diagnosis. This is not good news, 
but what is good news is that he is the 
greatest fighter and winner that you 
will ever meet. 
Rush Limbaugh: Thank you for your 
decades of tireless devotion to our 
country. 
And, Rush, in recognition of all that 
you have done for our Nation, the mil-
lions of people a day that you speak to 
and that you inspire and all of the in-
credible work that you have done for 
charity, I am proud to announce, to-
night, that you will be receiving our 
country’s highest civilian honor: the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
I will now ask the First Lady of the 
United States to present you with the 
honor, please. 
Rush and Kathryn, congratulations. 
Thank you, Kathryn. 
As we pray for all who are sick, we 
know 
that 
America 
is 
constantly 
achieving new medical breakthroughs. 
In 2017, doctors at Saint Luke’s Hos-
pital in Kansas City delivered one of 
the earliest premature babies ever to 
survive. 
Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days and 
weighing less than a pound, Ellie 
Schneider was a born fighter. Through 
the skill of her doctors—and the pray-
ers of her parents—little Ellie kept on 
winning the battle of life. Today, Ellie 
is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sit-
ting with her amazing mother, Robin, 
in the gallery. 
Ellie and Robin: We are glad to have 
you with us tonight. 
Ellie reminds us that every child is a 
miracle of life. And thanks to modern 
medical wonders, 50 percent of very 
premature babies delivered at the hos-
pital where Ellie was born now survive. 
It is an incredible thing. Thank you 
very much. 
Our goal should be to ensure that 
every baby has the best chance to 
thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is 
why I am asking Congress to provide 
an additional $50 million to fund neo-
natal research for America’s youngest 
patients. That is why I am also calling 
upon Members of Congress here tonight 
to pass legislation finally banning the 
late-term abortion of babies. 
Whether Republican, Democrat, or 
Independent, surely we must all agree 
that every human life is a sacred gift 
from God. 
As we support America’s moms and 
dads, I was recently proud to sign the 
law providing new parents in the Fed-
eral workforce paid family leave, serv-
ing as a model for the rest of the coun-
try. Now I call on Congress to pass the 
bipartisan 
Advancing 
Support 
for 
Working Families Act, extending fam-
ily leave to mothers and fathers all 
across our Nation. 
Forty 
million 
American 
families 
have an average $2,200 extra thanks to 
our child tax credit. I have also over-
seen historic funding increases for 
high-quality 
childcare, 
enabling 
17 
States to help more children, many of 
which have reduced or eliminated their 
wait lists altogether. And I sent Con-
gress a plan with a vision to expand 
high-quality childcare and urge you to 
act immediately. 
To protect the environment, days 
ago, I announced that the United 
States will join the One Trillion Trees 
Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring 
together government and the private 
sector to plant new trees in America 
and all around the world. 
We must also rebuild America’s in-
frastructure. I ask you to pass Senator 
JOHN BARRASSO’s highway bill—to in-
vest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels 
all across our land. 
I am also committed to ensuring that 
every citizen can have access to high- 
speed internet, including, and espe-
cially in, rural America. 
A better tomorrow for all Americans 
also requires us to keep America safe. 
That means supporting the men and 
women of law enforcement at every 
level, including our Nation’s heroic ICE 
officers. 
Last year, our brave ICE officers ar-
rested 
more 
than 
120,000

February 4, 2020 
aliens charged with nearly 10,000 bur-
glaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 vio-
lent assaults, and 2,000 murders. 
Tragically, there are many cities in 
America where radical politicians have 
chosen to provide sanctuary for these 
criminal illegal aliens. In sanctuary 
cities, local officials order police to re-
lease dangerous criminal aliens to prey 
upon the public instead of handing 
them over to ICE to be safely removed. 
Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien 
freed by the sanctuary city of New 
York was charged with the brutal rape 
and murder of a 92-year-old woman. 
The killer had been previously arrested 
for assault, but under New York’s sanc-
tuary policies, he was set free. If the 
city had honored ICE’s detainer re-
quest, his victim would still be alive 
today. 
The State of California passed an 
outrageous law declaring their whole 
State to be a sanctuary for criminal il-
legal immigrants—a very terrible sanc-
tuary—with catastrophic results. 
Here is just one tragic example. In 
December 2018, California police de-
tained an illegal alien with five prior 
arrests, including convictions for rob-
bery and assault. But as required by 
California’s sanctuary law, local au-
thorities released him. 
Days later, the criminal alien went 
on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. 
He viciously shot one man going about 
his daily work; he approached a woman 
sitting in her car and shot her in the 
arm and in the chest. He walked into a 
convenience store and wildly fired his 
weapon. He hijacked a truck and 
smashed into vehicles, critically injur-
ing innocent victims. One of the vic-
tims—a terrible, terrible situation— 
died, a 51-year-old American named 
Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas sta-
tion when this vile criminal fired eight 
bullets at him from close range, mur-
dering him in cold blood. 
Rocky left behind a devoted family, 
including his brothers, who loved him 
more than anything else in the world. 
One of his grieving brothers is here 
with us tonight. 
Jody, would you please stand. Jody. 
Thank you. Jody, our hearts weep for 
your loss and we will not rest until you 
have justice. 
Senator THOM TILLIS has introduced 
legislation to allow Americans like 
Jody to sue sanctuary cities and States 
when a loved one is hurt or killed as a 
result of these deadly practices. I ask 
Congress to pass the Justice for Vic-
tims of Sanctuary Cities Act imme-
diately. The United States of America 
should be a sanctuary for law-abiding 
Americans, not criminal aliens. 
In the last 3 years, ICE has arrested 
over 5,000 wicked human traffickers. 
And I have signed nine pieces of legis-
lation to stamp out the menace of 
human trafficking, domestically and 
all around the globe. 
My administration has undertaken 
an unprecedented effort to secure the 
southern border of the United States. 
Before I came into office, if you 
showed up illegally on our southern 
border and were arrested, you were 
simply released and allowed into our 
country never to be seen again. My ad-
ministration has ended catch-and-re-
lease. If you come illegally, you will 
now be promptly removed from our 
country. Very importantly, we entered 
into historic cooperation agreements 
with the Governments of Mexico, Hon-
duras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As 
a result of our unprecedented efforts, 
illegal crossings are down 75 percent 
since May, dropping 8 straight months 
in a row. And as the wall rapidly goes 
up, drug seizures rise, and the border 
crossings are going down and going 
down very rapidly. 
Last year, I traveled to the border in 
Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul 
Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent 
Ortiz and his team have seized more 
than 200,000 pounds of poisonous nar-
cotics, arrested more than 3,000 human 
smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 
migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was 
promoted to Deputy Chief of Border 
Patrol, and he joins us tonight. 
Chief Ortiz, please stand. A grateful 
Nation thanks you and all of the he-
roes of border patrol and ICE. Thank 
you very much. Thank you. 
To build on these historic gains, we 
are working on legislation to replace 
our outdated and randomized immigra-
tion system with one based on merit, 
welcoming those who follow the rules, 
contribute to our economy, support 
themselves financially, and uphold our 
values. 
With every action, my administra-
tion is restoring the rule of law and re-
asserting the culture of American free-
dom. Working with Senate Majority 
Leader MITCH MCCONNELL—thank you, 
MITCH—and his colleagues in the Sen-
ate, we have confirmed a record num-
ber of 187 new Federal judges to uphold 
our Constitution as written. This in-
cludes 
two 
brilliant 
new 
Supreme 
Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett 
Kavanaugh. Thank you. And we have 
many in the pipeline. 
My administration is also defending 
religious liberty, and that includes the 
constitutional right to pray in public 
schools. In America, we don’t punish 
prayer. We don’t tear down crosses. We 
don’t ban symbols of faith. We don’t 
muzzle preachers and pastors. In Amer-
ica, we celebrate faith. We cherish reli-
gion. We lift our voices in prayer, and 
we raise our sights to the glory of God. 
Just as we believe in the First 
Amendment, we also believe in another 
constitutional right that is under siege 
all across our country. So long as I am 
President, I will always protect your 
Second Amendment right to keep and 
bear arms. 
In reaffirming our heritage as a free 
Nation, we must remember that Amer-
ica has always been a frontier Nation. 
Now we must embrace the next fron-
tier, America’s manifest destiny in the 
stars. I am asking the Congress to fully 
fund the Artemis program to ensure 
that the next man and the first woman 
on the moon will be American astro-
nauts—using this as a launching pad to 
ensure that America is the first Nation 
to plant its flag on Mars. 
My administration is also strongly 
defending our national security and 
combating radical Islamic terrorism. 
Last 
week, 
I 
announced 
a 
groundbreaking plan for peace between 
Israel and the Palestinians. Recog-
nizing that all past attempts have 
failed, we must be determined and cre-
ative in order to stabilize the region 
and give millions of young people the 
chance to realize a better future. 
Three years ago, the barbarians of 
ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of 
territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the 
ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 
percent destroyed, and the founder and 
leader of ISIS, the bloodthirsty killer 
known as al-Baghdadi, is dead. 
We are joined this evening by Carl 
and Marsha Mueller. After graduating 
from college, their beautiful daughter 
Kayla became a humanitarian aid 
worker. She once wrote: ‘‘Some people 
find God in church. Some people find 
God in nature. Some people find God in 
love; I find God in suffering. I’ve known 
for some time what my life’s work is, 
using my hands as tools to relieve suf-
fering.’’ 
In 2013, while caring for suffering ci-
vilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, 
tortured, and enslaved by ISIS, and 
kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi him-
self. After more than 500 horrifying 
days of captivity, al-Baghdadi mur-
dered young, beautiful Kayla. She was 
just 26 years old. 
On the night that U.S. Special Forces 
operations ended al-Baghdadi’s miser-
able life, the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, 
received a call in the Situation Room. 
He was told that the brave men of the 
elite Special Forces team that so per-
fectly carried out the operation had 
given their mission a name, Task Force 
814. It was a reference to a special day, 
August 14, Kayla’s birthday. 
Carl and Marsha, America’s warriors 
never forgot Kayla, and neither will 
we. 
Every 
day, 
America’s 
men 
and 
women in uniform demonstrate the in-
finite depth of love that dwells in the 
human heart. One of these American 
heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Chris-
topher Hake. On his second deployment 
to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a 
letter to his 1-year-old son, Gage. 
‘‘I will be with you again,’’ he wrote 
to Gage. ‘‘I will teach you to ride your 
first bike, build your first sandbox, 
watch you play sports, and see you 
have kids also. I love you, son. Take 
care of your mother. I am always with 
you. Dad.’’ 
On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was 
out on patrol in Baghdad when his 
Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a 
roadside bomb. That night, he made 
the ultimate sacrifice for our country. 
Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal 
glory in Arlington, and his wife, Kelli, 
is in the gallery tonight, joined by 
their son, who is now a 13-year old, and 
doing very, very well.

February 4, 2020 
To Kelli and Gage, Chris will live in 
our hearts forever. He is looking down 
on you now. Thank you. Thank you 
very much. Thank you both very much. 
The terrorist responsible for killing 
Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, 
who provided the deadly roadside bomb 
that took Chris’ life. Soleimani was the 
Iranian regime’s most ruthless butch-
er, a monster who murdered or wound-
ed thousands of American servicemem-
bers in Iraq. 
As 
the 
world’s 
top 
terrorist, 
Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of 
countless men, women, and children. 
He directed the December assault and 
went on to assault U.S. Forces in Iraq 
and was actively planning new attacks 
when we hit him very hard. And that is 
why, last month, at my direction, the 
U.S. military executed a flawless preci-
sion strike that killed Soleimani and 
terminated his evil reign of terror for-
ever. 
Our message to the terrorists is 
clear: You will never escape American 
justice. If you attack our citizens, you 
forfeit your life. 
In recent months, we have seen proud 
Iranians raise their voices against 
their oppressive rulers. The Iranian re-
gime must abandon its pursuit of nu-
clear weapons; stop spreading terror, 
death, and destruction; and start work-
ing for the good of its own people. 
Because of our powerful sanctions, 
the Iranian economy is doing very, 
very poorly. We can help them make a 
very good and short-time recovery. It 
can all go very quickly, but, perhaps, 
they are too proud or too foolish to ask 
for that help. 
We are here. Let’s see which road 
they choose. It is totally up to them. 
As we defend American lives, we are 
working to end America’s wars in the 
Middle East. In Afghanistan, the deter-
mination and valor of our warfighters 
has allowed us to make tremendous 
progress, and peace talks are now un-
derway. 
I am not looking to kill hundreds of 
thousands of people in Afghanistan, 
many of them totally innocent. It is 
also not our function to serve other na-
tions as law enforcement agencies. 
These are warfighters that we have, 
the best in the world, and they either 
want to fight to win or not fight at all. 
We are working to finally end Amer-
ica’s longest war and bring our troops 
back home. War places a heavy burden 
on our Nation’s extraordinary military 
families, especially spouses like Amy 
Williams, from Fort Bragg, North 
Carolina, and her two children, 6-year- 
old Elliana, and 3-year-old Rowan. 
Amy works full time and volunteers 
countless hours helping our military 
families. For the past 7 months, she 
has done it all while her husband, Ser-
geant First Class Townsend Williams, 
is in Afghanistan on his fourth deploy-
ment in the Middle East. Amy’s kids 
haven’t seen their father’s face in 
many months. 
Amy, your family’s sacrifice makes 
it possible for all of our families to live 
in safety and in peace, and we want to 
thank you. Thank you, Amy. 
But, Amy, there is one more thing. 
Tonight, we have a very special sur-
prise. I am thrilled to inform you that 
your husband is back from deployment. 
He is here with us tonight, and we 
couldn’t keep him waiting any longer. 
Welcome home, Sergeant Williams. 
Thank you very much. 
As the world bears witness tonight, 
America is a land of heroes. This is the 
place where greatness is born, where 
destinies are forged, and where legends 
come to life. This is the home of Thom-
as Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of 
many great generals, including Wash-
ington, Pershing, Patton, and Mac-
Arthur. This is the home of Abraham 
Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia 
Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright 
brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many 
more. This is the country where chil-
dren learn names like Wyatt Earp, 
Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This 
is the place where the Pilgrims landed 
at Plymouth and where Texas patriots 
made their last stand at the Alamo, 
the beautiful, beautiful Alamo. 
The American Nation was carved out 
of the vast frontier by the toughest, 
strongest, fiercest, and most deter-
mined men and women ever to walk on 
the face of the Earth. Our ancestors 
braved the unknown; tamed the wilder-
ness; settled the wild west; lifted mil-
lions from poverty, disease, and hun-
ger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; 
ushered the world to new heights of 
science and medicine; laid down the 
railroads, dug out the canals, raised up 
the skyscrapers—and, ladies and gen-
tlemen, our ancestors built the most 
exceptional Republic ever to exist in 
all of human history. And we are mak-
ing it greater than ever before. 
This is our glorious and magnificent 
inheritance. 
We are Americans. We are pioneers. 
We are the pathfinders. We settled the 
New World; we built the modern world; 
and we changed history forever by em-
bracing the eternal truth that every-
one is made equal by the hand of Al-
mighty God. 
America is the place where anything 
can happen. America is the place where 
anyone can rise. And here, on this land, 
on this soil, on this continent, the 
most incredible dreams come true. 
This Nation is our canvas, and this 
country is our masterpiece. We look at 
tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers 
just waiting to be explored. Our bright-
est discoveries are not yet known. Our 
most thrilling stories are not yet told. 
Our grandest journeys are not yet 
made. The American age, the American 
epic, the American adventure has only 
just begun. 
Our spirit is still young; the Sun is 
still rising; God’s grace is still shining; 
and, my fellow Americans, the best is 
yet to come. 
Thank you. God bless you. And God 
bless America. Thank you very much. 
Thank you. 
(Applause, the Members rising.)

f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
these past weeks, the Senate has grap-
pled with as grave a subject as we ever 
consider: a request from a majority of 
the House to remove the President. 
The Framers took impeachment ex-
tremely seriously, but they harbored 
no illusions that these trials would al-
ways begin for the right reasons. 
Alexander 
Hamilton 
warned 
that 
‘‘the demon of faction’’ would ‘‘extend 
his sceptre’’ over the House of Rep-
resentatives ‘‘at certain seasons.’’ He 
warned that ‘‘an intemperate or de-
signing majority of the House’’ might 
misuse impeachment as a weapon of or-
dinary politics rather than emergency 
tool of last resort. The Framers knew 
impeachments might begin with over-
heated passions and short-term fac-
tualism. But they knew those things 
could not get the final say, so they 
placed the ultimate judgment not in 
the fractious lower Chamber but in the 
sober and stable Senate. 
They wanted impeachment trials to 
be fair to both sides. They wanted 
them to be timely, avoiding the ‘‘pro-
crastinated 
determination 
of 
the 
charges.’’ They wanted us to take a 
deep breath and decide which outcome 
would reflect the facts, protect our in-
stitutions, and advance the common 
good. They called the Senate ‘‘the most 
fit depositary of this important trust.’’ 
Tomorrow, we will know whether that 
trust was well-placed. 
The 
drive 
to 
impeach 
President 
Trump did not begin with the allega-
tions before us. Here was reporting in 
April of 2016, before the President was 
the nominee: ‘‘Donald Trump isn’t even 
the Republican nominee yet . . . [but] 
‘Impeachment’ is already on the lips of 
pundits, newspaper editorials, constitu-
tional scholars, and even a few mem-
bers of Congress.’’ 
Here was the Washington Post head-
line minutes after President Trump’s 
inauguration: ‘‘The campaign to im-
peach President Trump has begun,’’ the 
Washington Post says. 
The Articles of Impeachment before 
us were not even the first ones House 
Democrats introduced. This was go- 
around number, roughly, seven. Those 
previously alleged high crimes and 
misdemeanors 
included 
things 
like 
being impolite to the press and to pro-
fessional athletes. It insults the intel-
ligence of the American people to pre-
tend this was a solemn process reluc-
tantly begun because of withheld for-
eign aid. No, Washington Democrats’ 
position on this President has been 
clear literally for years. Their position 
was obvious when they openly rooted 
for the Mueller investigation to tear 
our 
country 
apart 
and 
were 
dis-
appointed when the facts proved other-
wise. It was obvious when they sought 
to impeach the President over and 
over. 
Here is their real position: Wash-
ington 
Democrats 
think 
President 
Donald Trump committed a high crime

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S814 
February 4, 2020 
or misdemeanor the moment he de-
feated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 elec-
tion. That is the original sin of this 
Presidency: that he won and they lost. 
Ever since, the Nation has suffered 
through a grinding campaign against 
our norms and institutions from the 
same people who keep shouting that 
our norms and institutions need de-
fending—a campaign to degrade our de-
mocracy and delegitimize our elections 
from the same people who shout that 
confidence in our democracy must be 
paramount. 
We have watched a major American 
political party adopt the following ab-
surd proposition: We think this Presi-
dent is a bull in a China shop, so we are 
going to drive a bulldozer through the 
China shop to get rid of him. This fever 
led to the most rushed, least fair, and 
least thorough Presidential impeach-
ment inquiry in American history. 
The House inquiry under President 
Nixon spanned many months. The spe-
cial prosecutors’ investigation added 
many more months. With President 
Clinton, 
the 
independent 
counsel 
worked literally for years. It takes 
time to find facts. It takes time to liti-
gate executive privilege, which hap-
pened in both those investigations. 
Litigating privilege questions is a nor-
mal step that investigators of both par-
ties understood was their responsi-
bility. But this time, there was no 
lengthy investigation, no serious in-
quiry. The House abandoned its own 
subpoenas. They had an arbitrary po-
litical deadline to meet. They had to 
impeach by Christmas. They had to im-
peach by Christmas. So in December, 
House Democrats realized the Framers’ 
nightmare. A purely partisan majority 
approved two Articles of Impeachment 
over bipartisan opposition. 
After the Speaker of the House de-
layed for a month in a futile effort to 
dictate Senate process to Senators, the 
articles finally arrived over here in the 
Senate. 
Over the course of the trial, Senators 
have heard sworn video testimony from 
13 witnesses, over 193 video clips. We 
have entered more than 28,000 pages of 
documents into evidence, including 17 
depositions. And our Members asked 
180 questions. In contrast to the House 
proceedings, our trial gave both sides a 
fair platform. Our process tracked with 
the structure that Senators adopted for 
the Clinton trial 20 years ago. 
Just as Democrats such as the cur-
rent Democratic leader and then-Sen-
ator Joe Biden argued at length in 1999, 
we recognized that Senate traditions 
imposed no obligation to hear new live 
witness testimony if it is not necessary 
to decide the case—if it is not nec-
essary to decide the case; let me em-
phasize that. 
The House managers themselves said 
over and over that additional testi-
mony was not necessary to prove their 
case. They claimed dozens of times 
that their existing case was ‘‘over-
whelming’’ and ‘‘incontrovertible.’’ 
That was the House managers saying 
their evidence was overwhelming and 
incontrovertible at the same time they 
were arguing for more witnesses. 
But in reality, both of the House’s 
accusations are constitutionally inco-
herent. 
The 
‘‘obstruction 
of 
Congress’’ 
charge is absurd and dangerous. House 
Democrats argued that anytime the 
Speaker invokes the House’s ‘‘sole 
power of impeachment,’’ the President 
must do whatever the House demands, 
no questions asked. Invoking executive 
branch privileges and immunities in re-
sponse to House subpoenas becomes an 
impeachable offense itself. 
Here is how Chairman SCHIFF put it 
back in October. ‘‘Any action’’—any 
action—‘‘that forces us to litigate, or 
have to consider litigation, will be con-
sidered further evidence of obstruction 
of justice.’’ 
That is nonsense impeachment. That 
is nonsense. ‘‘Impeachment’’ is not 
some magical constitutional trump 
card that melts away the separations 
between the branches of government. 
The Framers did not leave the House a 
secret constitutional steamroller that 
everyone somehow overlooked for 230 
years. 
When Congress subpoenas executive 
branch officials with questions of privi-
lege, the two sides either reach an ac-
commodation or they go to court. That 
is the way it works. 
So can you imagine if the shoe were 
on the other foot? How would Demo-
crats and the press have responded if 
House Republicans had told President 
Obama: We don’t want to litigate our 
subpoenas over Fast and Furious. So if 
you make us step foot in court, we will 
just impeach you. We will just impeach 
you. 
Of course, that is not what happened. 
The Republican House litigated its sub-
poenas for years until they prevailed. 
So much for ‘‘obstruction of Con-
gress.’’ 
And the ‘‘abuse of power’’ charge is 
just as unpersuasive and dangerous. By 
passing that article, House Democrats 
gave in to a temptation that every pre-
vious House has resisted. They im-
peached a President without even al-
leging a crime known to our laws. 
Now, I do not subscribe to the legal 
theory that impeachment requires a 
violation of a criminal statute, but 
there are powerful reasons why, for 230 
years, every Presidential impeachment 
did in fact allege a criminal violation. 
The Framers explicitly rejected im-
peachment for ‘‘maladministration,’’ a 
general charge under English law that 
basically encompassed bad manage-
ment—a sort of general vote of no con-
fidence. Except in the most extreme 
circumstances, except for acts that 
overwhelmingly shocked the national 
conscience, the Framers decided Presi-
dents must serve at the pleasure of the 
electorate—the electorate—and not at 
the pleasure of House majorities. As 
Hamilton wrote, ‘‘It is one thing to be 
subordinate to the laws, and another to 
be 
dependent’’—dependent—‘‘on 
the 
legislative body. 
So House Democrats sailed into new 
and dangerous waters—the first im-
peachment unbound by the criminal 
law. Any House that felt it needed to 
take this radical step owed the country 
the most fair and painstaking process, 
the most rigorous investigation, the 
most bipartisan effort. Instead, we got 
the opposite—the exact opposite. 
The House managers argued that the 
President could not have been acting in 
the national interest because he acted 
inconsistently with their own concep-
tion of the national interest. Let me 
say that again. The House managers 
were basically arguing that the Presi-
dent could not have been acting in the 
national interest because he acted in-
consistently with their conception of 
the national interest, a conception 
shared by some of President’s subordi-
nates as well. 
This does not even approach a case 
for the first Presidential removal in 
American history. It doesn’t even ap-
proach it. Such an act cannot rest 
alone on the exercise of a constitu-
tional power, combined with concerns 
about whether the President’s motiva-
tions were public or personal, and a 
disagreement over whether the exer-
cise of the power was in the national 
interests. 
The Framers gave our Nation an ulti-
mate tool for evaluating a President’s 
character and policy decisions. They 
are called elections. They are called 
elections. 
If Washington Democrats have a case 
to make against the President’s reelec-
tion, they should go out and make it. 
Let them try to do what they failed to 
do 3 years ago and sell the American 
people on their vision for the country. 
I can certainly see why, given Presi-
dent 
Trump’s 
remarkable 
achieve-
ments over the past 3 years, Democrats 
might feel a bit uneasy about defeating 
him at the ballot box. But they don’t 
get to rip the choice away from the 
voters just because they are afraid 
they might lose again. They don’t get 
to strike President Trump’s name from 
the ballot just because, as one House 
Democrat put it, ‘‘I am concerned that 
if we don’t impeach [him], he will get 
re-elected.’’ 
The impeachment power exists for a 
reason. It is no nullity. But invoking it 
on a partisan whim to settle 3-year-old 
political scores does not honor the 
Framers’ design. It insults the Fram-
ers’ design. 
Frankly, it is hard to believe that 
House Democrats ever really thought 
this reckless and precedent-breaking 
process would yield 67 votes to cross 
the Rubicon. 
Was their vision so clouded by par-
tisanship that they really believed— 
they really believed—this would be 
anywhere near enough for the first 
Presidential removal in American his-
tory? 
Or was success beside the point? Was 
this all an effort to hijack our institu-
tions for a month-long political rally? 
Either way, ‘‘the demon of faction’’ 
has been on full display, but now it is

February 4, 2020 
time for him, the demon, to exit the 
stage. We have indeed witnessed an 
abuse of power—a grave abuse of 
power—by just the kind of House ma-
jority that the Framers warned us 
about. 
So tomorrow—tomorrow—the Senate 
must do what we were created to do. 
We have done our duty. We considered 
all the arguments. We have studied the 
‘‘mountain of evidence,’’ and, tomor-
row, we will vote. 
We must vote to reject the House’s 
abuse of power, vote to protect our in-
stitutions, vote to reject new prece-
dents that would reduce the Framers’ 
design to rubble, and vote to keep fac-
tional fever from boiling over and 
scorching our Republic. 
I urge every one of our colleagues to 
cast the vote that the facts in evi-
dence, the Constitution, and the com-
mon good clearly require. Vote to ac-
quit the President of these charges. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
majority leader can come up on the 
floor and repeat his talking points, but 
there are some salient points that are 
irrefutable. 
The first, this is the first impeach-
ment trial of a President or impeach-
ment trial of anybody else that was 
completed that has no witnesses and no 
documents. The American people are 
just 
amazed 
that 
our 
Republican 
friends would not even ask for wit-
nesses and documents. 
I thought the House did a very good 
job. I thought they made a compelling 
case. But even if you didn’t, the idea 
that that means you shouldn’t have 
witnesses and documents, when we are 
doing something as august, as impor-
tant as an impeachment trial, fails the 
laugh test. It makes people believe— 
correctly, in my judgment—that the 
administration, its top people, and 
Senate Republicans are all hiding the 
truth. They are afraid of the truth. 
Second, the charges are extremely se-
rious. To interfere in an election, to 
blackmail a foreign country to inter-
fere in our elections gets at the very 
core of what our democracy is about. If 
Americans believe that they don’t de-
termine who is President, who is Gov-
ernor, who is Senator, but some foreign 
potentate out of reach of any law en-
forcement can jaundice our elections, 
that is the beginning of the end of de-
mocracy. 
So it is a serious charge. Republicans 
refused to get the evidence because 
they were afraid of what it would show, 
and that is all that needs to be said. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, to-
morrow we will be voting on the two 
impeachment articles sent over to us 
by the House of Representatives, a 
process, as the leader pointed out, that 
really started from the very day this 
President took office. 
I will be voting to acquit the Presi-
dent for several reasons. First and fore-
most, I do not believe the facts in this 
case rise to the high bar that the 
Founders set for removal from office. 
The Founders imposed a threshold for 
impeachment of ‘‘Treason, Bribery, or 
other 
high 
Crimes 
and 
Mis-
demeanors’’—in other words, very seri-
ous violations of the public trust. 
The Founders were deliberate in 
their choice of words. They wanted to 
be clear that impeachment was a se-
vere remedy to be deployed only for 
very serious violations. When George 
Mason proposed adding the term ‘‘mal-
administration’’ to the impeachment 
clause during the Constitutional Con-
vention, the Framers rejected the pro-
posal because, as Madison pointed out, 
the term was too vague and would be 
‘‘equivalent to a tenure during pleasure 
of the Senate.’’ 
The Founders recognized that with-
out safeguards, impeachment could 
quickly degenerate into a political 
weapon to be used to turn over elec-
tions when one faction or another de-
cided they didn’t like the President. 
That is why the Founders split the im-
peachment power, giving the House the 
sole authority to impeach and the Sen-
ate the sole authority to try impeach-
ments. As a final check, the Founders 
required a two-thirds supermajority 
vote in the Senate to remove a Presi-
dent from office. All of these things 
show just how seriously the Founders 
regarded 
removing 
a 
duly 
elected 
President. They intended it as an ex-
treme remedy to be used only in very 
grave circumstances. 
I do not believe that the charges the 
House has leveled against the Presi-
dent meet that high bar. The House 
managers’ 
presentation, 
which 
stretched over 22 hours, included testi-
mony from more than a dozen wit-
nesses. We also heard from the House 
managers during more than 16 hours of 
questions from Senators—in all, about 
180 questions—and we received more 
than 28,000 pages of testimony, evi-
dence, and arguments from the House 
of Representatives. 
I considered all the evidence care-
fully, but ultimately I concluded that 
the two charges presented by the House 
managers—abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of Congress—did not provide a 
compelling case for removing this 
President. 
According to public reporting, House 
Democrats toyed with charging the 
President with bribery, believing that 
it polled well, but they didn’t have the 
evidence to prove that charge or, in-
deed, to prove any actual crime. 
While allegations of specific criminal 
conduct may not be constitutionally 
required, they anchor impeachment in 
the law, and their absence is telling. 
Lacking evidence of a specific crime, 
the House decided to use the shotgun 
approach and throw everything under 
the catchall ‘‘abuse of power’’ um-
brella. 
Abuse of power is vaguely defined 
and subject to interpretation. In fact, I 
don’t believe there has been a Presi-
dent in my lifetime who hasn’t been ac-
cused of some form of abuse of power. 
For that reason, abuse of power seemed 
to me a fairly weak predicate on which 
to remove a democratically elected 
President from office. During the Clin-
ton impeachment, I voted against the 
abuse of power article precisely be-
cause I believed it did not offer strong 
grounds for removing the duly elected 
President. 
With respect to the second article, 
obstruction of Congress, the House 
took issue with the President’s asser-
tion of legal privileges, including those 
rooted in the constitutional separation 
of powers. Of course, every President in 
recent memory has invoked such privi-
leges—for example, when the Obama 
administration cited executive privi-
lege to deny documents to Congress 
during 
the 
Fast 
and 
Furious 
gunrunning investigation. 
The House could have challenged the 
President’s privilege claims by going 
through the traditional channels to re-
solve disputes between the executive 
and legislative branches, that being, of 
course, the courts. That is what was 
done in previous impeachment inquir-
ies, like the Clinton impeachment. But 
the House skipped that step in the 
hopes that the Senate would bail them 
out and compel testimony and docu-
ments that the House, in its rush to 
impeachment, was unwilling to pro-
cure. Again, it seemed like a very thin 
basis on which to remove a duly elect-
ed President from office. 
The facts in the case are that aid to 
Ukraine was released prior to the end 
of the fiscal year. No investigation of 
the scandal-plagued firm Burisma or 
the Bidens was ever initiated. While we 
can debate the President’s judgment 
when it comes to his dealings with 
Ukraine or even conclude that his ac-
tions were inappropriate, the House’s 
vague and overreaching impeachment 
charges do not meet the high bar set by 
the Founders for removal from office. 
My second consideration in voting to 
acquit the President is the deeply par-
tisan nature of the House’s impeach-
ment proceedings. The Founders’ over-
riding concern about impeachment was

that partisan majorities could use im-
peachment as a political weapon. 
In Federalist 65, Alexander Hamilton 
speaks of the danger of impeachment 
being used by ‘‘an intemperate or de-
signing majority in the House of Rep-
resentatives.’’ By limiting the House’s 
power to impeaching the President and 
not to removing him from office, the 
Founders hoped that the Senate would 
act as a check on any attempt by the 
House to use the power of impeach-
ment for partisan purposes. 
Unfortunately, the Founders’ con-
cerns about partisanship were realized 
in this impeachment process. For the 
first time in modern history, impeach-
ment was initiated and conducted on a 
purely partisan basis. 
While the Nixon impeachment pro-
ceedings in the House are held up as an 
example of bipartisanship, even the im-
peachment of President Clinton was 
initiated with the support of more than 
30 Democrats. By contrast, in this case, 
House Democrats drove ahead in a 
completely—completely—partisan 
ex-
ercise. Then they rushed through the 
impeachment process at breakneck 
speed, rejecting a thorough investiga-
tion because they wanted to impeach 
the President as fast as possible. Then 
they expected the Senate to take on 
the 
House’s 
investigative 
responsi-
bility. 
House Democrats paid lip service to 
the idea that they regretted having to 
impeach the President, but their ac-
tions told a different story. The Speak-
er of the House—the Speaker—distrib-
uted celebratory pens when she signed 
the Articles of Impeachment and then 
went on TV and celebrated the im-
peachment with a fist bump. 
It doesn’t require much work to 
imagine the damage that could be done 
to our Republic if impeachment be-
comes a weapon to be used whenever a 
political party doesn’t like a President. 
Pretty soon, Presidents would not be 
serving at the pleasure of the American 
people but at the pleasure of the House 
and the Senate. 
We need to call a halt before we have 
gone too far to turn back. Endorsing 
the House’s rushed, partisan, and slip-
shod work would encourage future 
Houses to use impeachment for par-
tisan purposes. Both parties need to 
learn that partisan impeachments are 
perilous. 
Finally, I believe that except in the 
most extreme circumstances, it should 
be the American people, and not Wash-
ington politicians, who decide whether 
a President should be removed from of-
fice. Presidential primary voting, as we 
learned yesterday in Iowa, is already 
underway. We have a Presidential elec-
tion in November, when the people of 
this country can weigh in and make 
their voices heard. I think we should 
leave the decision up to them. 
Indeed, 
given 
the 
deep 
divisions 
plaguing our country, as reflected in 
the starkly different views about this 
impeachment, removing the President 
from office and from the ballots for the 
upcoming election would almost cer-
tainly plunge the country into even 
greater political turmoil. 
I am deeply troubled by the events of 
the past few months. I have always be-
lieved that we can differ here in Con-
gress while still respecting and work-
ing with those who disagree with us, 
but 
Democrats 
have 
increasingly 
sought to demonize anyone who doesn’t 
share their obsession with impeaching 
this President. One of the House man-
agers in this trial went so far as to sug-
gest that any Senator who voted 
against them was treacherous. 
At one point, a Senator asked wheth-
er the Chief Justice’s constitutionally 
required participation in the trial was 
contributing to ‘‘the loss of legitimacy 
of the Chief Justice, the Supreme 
Court, and the Constitution,’’ with the 
clear suggestion that the only way for 
the Supreme Court to maintain its le-
gitimacy would be for it to agree with 
the Democratic Party. We have sunk 
pretty low when we have come to the 
point of suggesting that disagreement 
is unconstitutional. 
But for all this, I remain hopeful. 
Congress has been through contentious 
times before, and we have gotten 
through them. There is no question 
that this partisan impeachment has 
been divisive, but I do believe we can 
move on from this. I am ready to work 
with all of my colleagues, both Demo-
crat and Republican, in the coming 
weeks and months as we get back to 
the business of the American people. 
And for the Nation that we all love, I 
pray that proves possible. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, the 
Senate must determine whether to re-
move a President duly elected by the 
people. A decision of such magnitude 
deserves, first, full consideration of the 
procedures; second, the merits of the 
charges; and third, the ramifications 
removal would have on our Republic. 
The Framers of the Constitution 
granted the House of Representatives 
impeachment powers yet cautioned 
against using that power unless abso-
lutely necessary. Impeachment negates 
an election in which Americans choose 
their leader. If substantial numbers of 
Americans disagree with removing the 
President, removal damages civic soci-
ety. It follows that the House should 
conduct thorough and complete inves-
tigations, even if time-consuming, be-
fore impeaching. 
A thorough investigation educates 
Americans that a President should be 
impeached and removed. Failing to 
convince the people invites anger to-
wards, disdain for, and abandonment of 
the democratic process. 
The Framers also required a two- 
thirds Senate majority for removal to 
prevent partisanship, so that removal 
only occurs after the House convinces 
its own Members, the Senate, and the 
American people. The Watergate inves-
tigation, for example, convinced Amer-
icans that President Nixon committed 
crimes, forcing his resignation with 
overwhelming support for removal in 
the House and the Senate. 
In the case against President Trump, 
the House declined to call witnesses it 
felt relevant, arguing that the courts 
would take too long and the President 
was an imminent threat to our Repub-
lic. House managers blamed legal re-
sistance from the administration and 
witnesses. For example, Dr. Charles 
Kupperman threatened to sue. A con-
gressional committee afraid of being 
sued while claiming to be fearlessly 
pursuing truth for the good of the 
country rings hollow. It also rang hol-
low when ADAM SCHIFF said that we 
could not wait for the next election for 
voters to decide President Trump’s fate 
after Speaker NANCY PELOSI held the 
articles for 37 days. That decision 
smacks of partisan political motiva-
tions. 
The 
partisanship 
the 
Founders 
warned against was reflected in the 
House vote with the only bipartisan 
votes 
being 
against 
impeachment. 
House Managers SCHIFF, NADLER, and 
LOFGREN once said that party-line im-
peachment would divide the Nation. 
They never explained why their opin-
ions changed. 
The role of the Senate, though, is to 
judge the House’s evidence. House man-
agers stated their case was ‘‘over-
whelming’’ and ‘‘compelling.’’ Having 
not pursued further witness testimony 
in building their case, the House man-
agers demanded the Senate call wit-
nesses the House did not call. 
Additional witnesses, however, would 
not have changed material facts, but 
allowing the House to poorly develop a 
case, sacrificing thoroughness for polit-
ical 
timing, 
would 
have 
forever 
changed the dynamic of the Chambers 
respective to the role of each in the im-
peachment process. Should the Senate 
acquiesce in this manipulation of the 
process, it would welcome the House to 
use impeachment as a political weap-
on, whatever the merits of its case. 
I have been speaking of procedure. I 
want to emphasize that procedure mat-
ters. Justice Frankfurter once wrote: 
‘‘The history of liberty has largely 
been the history of the observance of 
procedural safeguards.’’ If the appro-
priate use of impeachment is to be pre-
served, procedural safeguards must be 
observed. 
Moving now to charges, in article II, 
House managers argued the President 
obstructed Congress by acting on the 
advice of legal counsel to resist sub-
poenas. The judiciary resolves disputes 
between the executive and legislative 
branches. The House should have ex-
hausted judicial remedies before bring-
ing this charge. I shall vote against ar-
ticle II. 
On article I, abuse of power, three 
issues must be addressed: one, the legal 
standard of guilt by which to judge the 
President; two, whether the President 
committed a crime; and if so, three, 
whether that crime warrants removal 
from office.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S817 
February 4, 2020 
First, the standard of guilt was never 
established. Legal standards for convic-
tion vary from the lower—more prob-
able than not—threshold to the higher, 
which is beyond a reasonable doubt, 
which is used in criminal cases. 
Since 
House 
managers 
charged 
‘‘something akin’’ to a crime, ‘‘beyond 
a reasonable doubt’’ seems most appro-
priate, the higher threshold. As Sen-
ator Jay Rockefeller stated during 
President Clinton’s impeachment, be-
yond a reasonable doubt ‘‘means that 
it is proven to a moral certainty, that 
the case is clear, that the case is con-
cise.’’ 
Second, House managers allege that 
the President held military aid to 
Ukraine to leverage an investigation 
into former Vice President Biden as a 
quid pro quo, although they did not 
charge President Trump with the crime 
of requiring a quid pro quo or bribery. 
The President’s defense team cast rea-
sonable doubt on this allegation. 
For example, regarding the July 25 
phone call, which was reported by the 
whistleblower and which triggered the 
House impeachment proceedings, the 
President raised the issue of corruption 
in Ukraine. President Trump has al-
ways been skeptical of foreign aid and 
especially when he thinks it is wasted. 
Hunter Biden was mentioned, but no 
connection was made with the release 
of aid to Ukraine. 
Other defense arguments included 
that Ambassador Kurt Volker denied a 
connection between aid and corruption 
investigations; President Zelensky and 
Ukrainian officials denied feeling pres-
sure; and President Trump denied a 
quid pro quo to Ambassador Sondland 
and told Senator RON JOHNSON, when 
asked if there was some sort of ar-
rangement, ‘‘No way. I would never do 
that.’’ 
Both aid to Ukraine was released be-
fore the statutory deadline and a meet-
ing between Presidents Trump and 
Zelensky occurred without an an-
nounced investigation. 
It is also important to note that the 
release of aid on September 11 followed 
new Ukrainian anti-corruption meas-
ures, which included swearing in a re-
formed Parliament and installing a 
new prosecutor general—August 29— 
and the newly established High Anti- 
Corruption Court meeting for the first 
time—September 5. 
The third issue regarding article I, 
abuse of power, is that the term is a 
nebulous one which does not define a 
specific crime. Contrast this with the 
impeachment of President Nixon when 
the House drafted an Article of Im-
peachment alleging abuse of power 
which enumerated five specific crimi-
nal and noncriminal offenses against 
President Nixon. 
The Constitution speaks of treason, 
bribery, or other high crimes and mis-
demeanors. Because high crimes and 
misdemeanors are not specifically de-
fined, it is reasonable to assume that 
the Framers meant for impeachment to 
occur only if a crime approached levels 
as severe as treason and bribery. 
Since the House managers allege 
President Trump committed something 
‘‘akin to a crime,’’ in deciding whether 
abuse of power is a high crime or mis-
demeanor, the prudent decision is to 
apply the principle of lenity. This prin-
ciple, relied upon by Supreme Court 
Justice Marshall and Justice Frank-
furter, says that if a law is ambiguous, 
it is better to narrowly interpret the 
words of a law in favor of the defend-
ant. 
Although the preceding discussion 
finds that the House managers failed to 
prove their case beyond a shadow of a 
doubt, failed to define the crime, there-
by invoking the principle of lenity, it 
is still a question that if a crime was 
committed, was it an impeachable 
crime? 
In 1998, then-Democratic Congress-
man Ed Markey argued that even 
though President Clinton, as chief law 
enforcement officer of the land, lied 
under oath, the crime was not im-
peachable. The Senate agreed, estab-
lishing the precedent that to remove a 
President, the crime must reach a high 
threshold of severity. The allegation 
against President Trump was not prov-
en beyond a reasonable doubt, and it 
does not meet that high threshold. 
I shall vote against article I. 
I end by speaking of the ramifica-
tions for our Republic. In 1998, then- 
Congressman CHUCK SCHUMER said of 
the Clinton impeachment: 
I suspect history will show that we have 
lowered the bar on impeachment so much, 
we have broken the seal on this extreme pen-
alty so cavalierly that it will be used as a 
routine tool to fight political battles. My 
fear is that when a Republican wins the 
White House, Democrats will demand pay-
back. 
Mr. SCHUMER was a prophet. 
This must stop. 
With that, I yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I 
want to first thank the House man-
agers and the counsel for the President 
for their time and their hard work and 
patience these past few weeks. 
Yes, folks, we have had a robust and 
at times a rancorous trial. Some days I 
left here feeling angry, and some days 
I left more hopeful. Frankly, it is like-
ly that many Americans—and in my 
case, 
Iowans—from 
every 
political 
stripe will feel hurt by this process at 
some level. But we are all representa-
tives of the ideals and beliefs of the 
people we are here to represent. 
Like all of you, I have sworn an oath 
to uphold the Constitution, and I take 
that oath very seriously. There have 
been a lot of arguments presented 
about what the Constitution says re-
garding the threshold for impeaching a 
President. It is clear to me that the 
Constitution goes out of its way to 
make it a high bar for removing the 
President. This is because the Found-
ers were rightfully concerned that im-
peachment might be used to upend the 
electoral will of the American people. 
Absent restraint, the impeachment 
process would be all too tempting for 
those who oppose a sitting President to 
simply use it as a tool to achieve polit-
ical advantage. 
Each of us had one job—one job—dur-
ing this process: to decide, based on the 
evidence, whether the President com-
mitted an impeachable offense. Upon 
reviewing the record containing the 
testimony of 17 witnesses and over 
28,000 pages, as well as hearing from 
both sides on their arguments pre-
sented throughout this process, I will 
vote against both Articles of Impeach-
ment. 
The arguments of the House man-
agers simply did not demonstrate that 
the President’s actions rise to an im-
peachable offense. Given the constitu-
tional requirements, voting any other 
way on these articles would remove the 
ability of the American people to make 
their own decision at the ballot box in 
November. 
This process was fraught from the 
start with political aims and partisan 
innuendos that simply cannot be over-
looked. 
The 
House 
managers’ 
arguments 
have argued that the American people 
cannot be trusted to render their own 
judgment on this President. I reject 
this premise and the complete distrust 
of the American people with every-
thing in my heart. To do this would set 
a new and dangerous precedent in 
American history. 
As we sit here today, we believe we 
are experiencing a unique and histor-
ical event; however, if the case pre-
sented by the House of Representatives 
is allowed to be the basis for the re-
moval of this President, I am afraid 
that impeachment will become just an-
other tool used by those who play par-
tisan politics. This is not what the 
Founders intended, and this is a very 
dark path to go down. 
Under the Constitution, impeach-
ment wasn’t designed to be a litmus 
test on every action of the President’s; 
elections were designed to be that 
check. Further, the issue of foreign af-
fairs has historically been fraught with 
peril for Presidents. Foreign affairs is 
an art, not a science, and trying to in-
sert a formula into every Presidential 
interaction with a foreign leader is a 
path toward ineffectiveness. 
The Senate is about to close this 
chapter in American history. I pray 
that we do not allow this to become 
the norm. I also pray earnestly that we 
will shift into a spirit of cohesiveness, 
coming together to get our work done 
for the American people. Our people, 
our Founders, our country, and my 
great State of Iowa deserve better than 
this. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from the great State of Mis-
sissippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, to-
morrow I will cast my vote against the 
removal of our duly elected President. 
I will do so based upon my under-
standing of the duty conferred upon me

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S818 
February 4, 2020 
by the Constitution of the United 
States. 
I do not believe the House managers 
have proved the allegations contained 
in the Articles of Impeachment, nor do 
I believe the articles allege conduct 
that may be used as grounds for re-
moval. I find the President’s counsel to 
be persuasive in this regard. Signifi-
cantly, much of the American public, 
without the benefit of learned constitu-
tional instruction, has come to the 
same conclusion. 
During the 21⁄2 weeks of this trial, we 
have received more than 28,000 pages of 
documents, we have seen 192 video clips 
of 13 different witnesses, we had the op-
portunity to question each side for a 
total of 16 hours, and we have listened 
to literally hours and hours of argu-
ment. Clearly, I am unable to discuss 
every aspect of the trial in the time al-
lotted me. Some facts in this case are 
in dispute, but many are not. Here is 
what we all know beyond a doubt: 
First, we know that voices on the left 
have been calling for the impeachment 
of Donald Trump since day one—lit-
erally day one. The Washington Post 
on January 20, 2017, published an arti-
cle titled ‘‘The Campaign to Impeach 
President Trump Has Begun’’ on Inau-
guration Day. 
Secondly, 
we 
know 
that 
the 
yearslong $32 million Mueller inves-
tigation failed to reveal sufficient am-
munition for those who desired im-
peachment. 
Third, 
the 
impeachment 
of 
this 
President in the House was the result 
of a narrowly partisan vote, with no 
Republican 
Representatives—zero— 
voting in favor of the articles. 
And fourth, a guilty verdict this 
week would not only immediately re-
move the President from office, but it 
would also remove his name from the 
ballot in an election, which is already 
going on, and the first caucuses of 
which were conducted only yesterday. 
The words are right there in articles I 
and II, on pages 3 and 4 of the resolu-
tion: ‘‘disqualification to hold . . . any 
office.’’ 
The Founders of this country en-
trusted Congress with the power of im-
peachment as a check and balance on 
the executive branch. This power was 
never intended to settle policy dif-
ferences or political disagreements— 
even intense disagreements. It was not 
designed so that Congress could get rid 
of a President they found odious or ob-
noxious or with whom they vehemently 
disagree. 
The Constitution gives Congress this 
extraordinary authority as a remedy 
only for what it calls ‘‘high Crimes and 
Misdemeanors.’’ And making it clear 
what an extreme action of impeach-
ment is, the Framers required the sup-
port of two-thirds in this Chamber in 
order to convict. 
These standards intentionally set a 
very high bar to prevent abuse of the 
impeachment process. Meeting these 
standards requires this process be used 
to try only the most serious allega-
tions and requires broad consensus in 
the Senate. Members of both parties 
have, in the past, warned about the 
dangers of a narrowly partisan im-
peachment. 
As late as last year, House Speaker 
NANCY PELOSI cautioned: 
Impeachment is so divisive to the country 
that unless there’s something so compelling 
and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t 
think we should go down that path because 
it divides the country. 
Congressman NADLER, one of the im-
peachment managers, said in 1998: 
There must never be a narrowly voted im-
peachment or an impeachment substantially 
supported by one of our major political par-
ties and largely opposed by the other. Such 
an impeachment would lack legitimacy, 
would produce divisiveness and bitterness in 
our politics for years to come. 
This wide approach has been sup-
ported in the past by House Manager 
ZOE LOFGREN, by Senator and future 
Vice President Joe Biden, and by our 
own colleagues, Senator MENENDEZ and 
SCHUMER, who feared that impeach-
ment would become a routine tool. 
These leaders had good company in 
taking this position. In Federalist No. 
65, Alexander Hamilton warned of the 
danger that the decision to impeach 
‘‘will be regulated more by the com-
parative strength of the parties than 
by the real demonstrations of inno-
cence or guilt.’’ 
Many of our Democratic friends who 
once sided with Hamilton have appar-
ently changed their minds. They have 
also reversed themselves on the ur-
gency of doing so—a rather sudden and 
abrupt change of heart on that ques-
tion. 
House 
advocates 
of 
impeachment 
have argued that President Trump is 
willing to cheat in the ongoing election 
and amounting to such an imminent 
threat to our democracy that he must 
be removed at once. Unless he is out of 
office and out quickly, they assert, we 
cannot have any confidence that the 
2020 election results will be trust-
worthy. 
I ask: Does any Senator really be-
lieve that; that America cannot have a 
fair election if Donald Trump is in the 
White House? But that alleged danger 
was the reason for the abbreviated 
House procedure. The lead House man-
ager, Congressman SCHIFF, said in an 
interview last year that the timing of 
impeachment was driven by the ur-
gency of removing the President. Con-
gressman NADLER agreed, saying that 
‘‘nothing 
could 
be 
more 
urgent.’’ 
Speaker PELOSI repeated the same ar-
gument many times to explain the 
rushed process in the House and why 
there was not time to give the Presi-
dent a fair hearing. Senators heard the 
words repeated and repeated on video 
clips shown during this trial—‘‘ur-
gent,’’ ‘‘urgency.’’ 
What happened to that urgency once 
the House voted? Did the Speaker then 
rush the papers to the Senate so we 
could address this imminent threat? 
Hardly. Speaker PELOSI held the arti-
cles for more than a month. If this 
trial was so urgent, why not send the 
articles without delay? Some might 
conclude that by withholding the arti-
cles, the Speaker exposed that she did 
not, in fact, believe that this case was 
so urgent. Perhaps it was an effort to 
influence our procedural decisions. I do 
not impugn motives here. Our rules 
prohibit me from doing so. I merely 
note an obvious change for whatever 
reason. 
As I consider the high bar of im-
peachment tomorrow, I will vote not to 
convict. I will do so because there is 
not overwhelming evidence, because no 
high crimes are shown, because there is 
not a broad consensus among my coun-
trymen, only articles passed on a nar-
rowly partisan basis, and because re-
moving President Trump on these 
charges at this time would set a dan-
gerous precedent. 
I conclude by reminding my col-
leagues that we are the trustees of the 
Constitution of 1787. We have the privi-
lege and responsibility of standing on 
the shoulders of our remarkably per-
ceptive Founders, but we also act as 
trustees for our Republic on behalf of 
future generations. With that in mind, 
we have an enhanced obligation to be 
careful, to resist the passions of the 
moment, and to remember that what 
we do today establishes precedence for 
decades and centuries to come. 
Manager SCHIFF closed his remarks 
yesterday with an ominous reference to 
nefarious midnight decisions somehow 
threatening the freedom or welfare of 
Americans. His hopeful conclusion was 
that it is midnight in America, but the 
Sun will rise tomorrow, a sentiment I 
happen to share, though my concept of 
what amounts to a beautiful sunrise 
may differ from his. 
Over a century ago, during the 
depths of World War I, Vachel Lindsay 
composed ‘‘Abraham Lincoln Walks at 
Midnight,’’ 
imagining 
an 
agonized, 
sleepless Lincoln walking the streets of 
Springfield, dismayed over the carnage 
in Europe. 
Let us ask ourselves today, do Ham-
ilton and Madison and Franklin walk 
these venerable halls at midnight? Do 
these Founding Fathers traverse the 
stone corridors of these great building, 
this symbol of stability and rule of 
law? If they do, they caution us, as 
they always have, to be careful, to 
avoid rash decisions, to resist the urges 
of partisanship, and to let the Con-
stitution work. I hope my colleagues 
will heed their counsel. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, as we think back over these last 
weeks, when we have sat together on 
the floor considering evidence and sit-
ting in judgment as jurors and judges, 
spending countless hours deliberating, 
I often think about what I will remem-
ber from these days on a very personal 
level. 
It has been a historic event, but in 
some ways, the human element strikes

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S819 
February 4, 2020 
me as the most memorable. I will re-
member vividly the bravery of dedi-
cated public servants who had every-
thing to lose and nothing to gain by 
telling the American people the truth 
about Donald Trump and his scheme to 
corruptly use power for his personal 
benefit. Their courage, their grace 
under 
pressure, 
their 
dignity, 
and 
unshakeable honesty should be a model 
for all of us. 
I will remember, for example, LTC 
Alexander Vindman, whose video ap-
peared before us, a man who was 
brought to the United States at the age 
of 3 and grew to love this country so 
much that he put his life at risk in 
combat and then his career at risk by 
coming before the Congress. 
I will remember Fiona Hill, the 
daughter of a coal miner and nurse, 
who proceeded to get a Ph.D., swear an 
oath to this country, serving in both 
Republican and Democratic adminis-
trations, warning us not to peddle the 
‘‘fictional narrative . . . perpetrated 
and propagated,’’ as she said, ‘‘by the 
Russian security services themselves’’ 
about this supposed Ukrainian effort to 
meddle in our election. I will remember 
very vividly Ambassador William Tay-
lor, West Point graduate and decorated 
Vietnam war veteran, who testified 
that he thought it was ‘‘crazy to with-
hold security assistance for help with a 
political campaign.’’ 
I will remember the whistleblower 
who came forward to express shock and 
alarm that the President of the United 
States would attempt to extort a vul-
nerable, fledgling democracy to help 
him cheat in the next election in ex-
change for the foreign military aid 
they so desperately needed to fight 
their adversary, Russia, and our adver-
sary, Russia, attacking and killing 
their young men and women. 
I have met some of those young men 
and women who came to Connecticut 
to the Burn Center at Bridgeport Hos-
pital, so badly injured they could bare-
ly talk, and the stories of their suf-
fering and hardship came back to me, 
as I sat on the floor here, and their 
courage and their bravery and strength 
also will stay with me. 
I will remember the moment that we 
raised our hands and took an oath to be 
impartial, all 100 of us—99—at the same 
time, in a historic moment when the 
weight of that responsibility shook me 
like a rock. I will also remember the 
shame and sadness that I felt when this 
body—supposedly, the greatest delib-
erative body in the history of the 
world—voted to close its eyes, to put 
on blinders to evidence, witnesses, and 
documents; firsthand knowledge, eyes 
and ears on the President, black and 
white—documents don’t lie—that were 
necessary to understand the complete 
story and give the American people the 
complete truth. That moment—unfor-
tunately, a moment of dismay and dis-
appointment—will stay with me as 
well, after aspiring for so long to be 
part of this body, which I respected and 
revered, so utterly failing the Amer-
ican people at this moment of crisis. 
And I will remember audible gasps, 
some laughs, and raised eyebrows in 
this Chamber when Professor Alan 
Dershowitz made the incredible, shock-
ing argument that a President who be-
lieves that his own reelection serves 
the public interest can do anything he 
wants, and his actions are not im-
peachable. The implications of that ar-
gument for the future of our democ-
racy are simply indescribable. 
I have been a trial lawyer. I have 
spent most of my career in and out of 
the courtroom. So I can argue the le-
galities. But I am not here to rehash 
the legal arguments, because culpa-
bility here seems pretty clear to me. 
The President solicited a bribe when he 
sought a personal benefit and inves-
tigation of his political opponent, a 
smear of his rival, in exchange for an 
official act—in fact, two official acts: 
the release of military funding for an 
ally and a White House meeting—in re-
turn for that personal benefit. Those 
actions are a violation of section 201, 18 
United States Code, today. They were a 
violation of criminal law at the time of 
the Framers, and that is why they put 
it in the Constitution. 
Bribery and treason are specifically 
mentioned. Bribery is included as an 
abuse of power, as it was when Judge 
Porteous was convicted and impeached. 
Many of the Members of this Chamber 
voted to impeach him, although brib-
ery was never mentioned in the articles 
charging him with abuse of power. 
The idea that bribery or any crime 
has to be mentioned for there to be an 
abuse of power is clearly preposterous. 
In my view, the elements of bribery 
have been proved beyond a reasonable 
doubt, and there is no excuse for that 
criminal conduct. I am going to submit 
a detailed statement for the RECORD 
that makes the legal case, but, clearly, 
bribery has been committed by this 
President. 
Looking beyond the legalities, what 
strikes me, perhaps, as most telling 
here is the constant theme of secrecy— 
the fact that the President kept his 
reasons for withholding aid a secret. 
Unlike other suspensions of aid to 
other countries—like the Northern Tri-
angle in Central America or Egypt, 
where it was announced publicly and 
Congress was notified—here, he kept it 
secret. He operated through his per-
sonal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in se-
cret, not through the State Depart-
ment, not through the Department of 
Justice. Despite all of his claims of 
corruption and wrongdoing by Hunter 
or Joe Biden, he either never went to 
the Department of Justice or they de-
clined to investigate because there was 
no ‘‘there’’ there. Instead, he sought, 
secretly, the investigation of a polit-
ical rival through a foreign govern-
ment, targeting a U.S. citizen secretly. 
His refusal to provide a single docu-
ment to Congress, to allow a single 
witness to testify, keeping their testi-
mony and that evidence secret, con-
cealing it; his defiance of every sub-
poena in court, effectively neutering 
Congress’s 
oversight 
authority—our 
oversight authority—to check any of 
these abuses, all of it is for the purpose 
of secrecy. 
His claim of absolute immunity is to-
tally discredited and rejected by the 
court because, as the court said in the 
McGahn case, he is not a King. 
His claim of executive privilege as 
the reason for keeping that evidence 
secret—well, he never really invoked 
executive 
privilege, 
but 
executive 
privilege cannot be invoked to conceal 
criminal conduct that fits within the 
crime of a fraud exception. 
And while the President’s lawyers ar-
gued before this body that the House 
should have gone to court to enforce 
those subpoenas instead of resorting to 
the remedy of impeachment, they then 
had the audacity to, simultaneously, at 
exactly the same time, argue in court 
that Congress cannot seek a judicial 
remedy to enforce subpoenas because it 
has the remedy of impeachment. They 
argued no jurisdiction because of im-
peachment, and at the same time no 
access to evidence necessary for im-
peachment because, supposedly, you 
can go to court. This duplicity is abso-
lutely stunning. 
Again, I will say, just on a personal 
note as a prosecutor, it is a dead give-
away. He is guilty. Regardless of what 
we do tomorrow, we know for sure, in 
this great democracy, the truth will 
come out. It always does. It is just a 
question of when. It comes out about 
all of us at some point. And, for this 
President, the truth is coming out in 
realtime, as we speak on this floor and 
as we vote tomorrow. 
The revelations in the New York 
Times about what John Bolton has 
written in his book indicate the truth 
is going to come out in mid-March with 
John Bolton’s book, assuming the 
President doesn’t try to censor it and 
tie him up in court or exercise some 
prior restraint. It will come out in con-
gressional investigations when John 
Bolton and others testify. It will come 
out because there are courageous men 
and women, like Ambassador Taylor, 
Fiona Hill, Colonel Vindman, and oth-
ers, who are willing to put country 
ahead of their personal careers. 
When my children grow up—and they 
are pretty well grown—I hope they will 
be more like them than like the Presi-
dent. I never, ever thought I would say 
that in the Senate of the United 
States, let alone anywhere, because 
this President has shown that he will 
take advantage of every opportunity 
for self-enrichment and self-aggran-
dizement. Whether it is violating the 
emoluments clause—and I, along with 
199 of my colleagues, have sued him on 
that issue, making money from the 
Presidency, profiting and putting prof-
it ahead of his official duties, or seek-
ing to smear a political rival and solic-
iting a bribe. Even if the aid went 
through and even if the investigation 
was never announced, it is still a 
crime—putting that kind of self-benefit 
ahead of his duty to the country and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S820 
February 4, 2020 
our national security, the welfare and 
fight of an ally at the tip of the spear 
against a common adversary who is 
seeking to destroy Western democ-
racies. He is someone who has said: 
Show me the boundaries of the law, 
and I will push them, and if I can suc-
cessfully cross them, I will do it again. 
And he will do it again. Everyone in 
this Chamber knows it. 
So, as we make this momentous deci-
sion, I implore each of my colleagues 
to think about the gravity of what we 
will do if we fail to convict this Presi-
dent, the message that we send to 
countries struggling to overcome cor-
ruption, because America is more than 
just a country. America is an idea and 
an ideal. When we implore them to 
fight corruption, our credibility is 
shredded when we condone it at home. 
The Framers, in their wisdom, knew 
that elections every 4 years were an in-
adequate check against any President 
who corruptly abuses power for per-
sonal gain. And this situation and this 
President are exactly what they feared 
when our young infant country was 
struggling to avoid foreign interference 
in our elections. It was their worst 
nightmare, foreign interference, the 
threat of foreign meddling—exactly 
what this President has invited. 
It was delegate William Davie of 
North Carolina who said: ‘‘If he be not 
impeachable whilst in office, he will 
spare no effort or means whatever to 
get himself re-elected.’’ It was pre-
cisely cheating in a future election, 
foreign interference in our domestic af-
fairs, that the Framers established im-
peachment to prevent. That is why the 
remedy exists, and that is why we must 
use it now. 
History will judge us harshly if we 
fail in this historic challenge. History 
will haunt the colleagues who fail to 
meet this challenge, who lack the cour-
age that was demonstrated by those 
heroes: Taylor, Vindman, Hill, Cooper, 
and others. And they will continue to 
serve our country. The truth will come 
out. 
The heroes of this darker era will be 
our independent judiciary and our free 
press. They will continue uncovering 
the truth. They will continue providing 
freedom of information material under 
the law. They will continue to protect 
civil rights and civil liberties. They 
will continue their vigilance, even if 
we fail in ours. 
But we have this task now. History 
will sit in judgment of us, and the fu-
ture of our Republic will be in jeopardy 
if we fail tomorrow to do the right 
thing. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Mary-
land is recognized. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, it is the constitutional duty of 
each Senator to weigh the evidence be-
fore us and render a final verdict on 
the two Articles of Impeachment. 
On the charge of abuse of power, the 
House managers have presented over-
whelming evidence, a ‘‘mountain of it,’’ 
as Senator ALEXANDER has conceded. 
For anyone with eyes to see or ears to 
hear, President Trump undoubtedly 
used the power of the Presidency to 
withhold vital, taxpayer-funded mili-
tary aid from Ukraine to extort its 
government into helping him in his re-
election campaign. He did so even 
though fighting Russian aggression is 
in our national interest. And make no 
mistake, the fact that he got caught 
before his scheme succeeded is no de-
fense. 
The House has also proved its case on 
the charge of obstruction of Congress. 
President Trump has engaged in un-
precedented stonewalling, a blanket 
coverup that makes President Nixon 
look like an amateur—not a single doc-
ument produced nor a single witness. 
Those who did testify did so despite the 
President’s order not to show up. They 
raised their right hands and swore to 
tell the truth. They included Trump 
political appointees and a major donor 
to 
his 
campaign, 
individuals 
who 
served our country in war, dedicated 
public servants who took an oath to de-
fend the Constitution. Dismissing them 
as ‘‘anti-Trumpers’’ and ‘‘Democratic 
witnesses’’ is wrong, as were the Presi-
dent’s attempts to bully and intimi-
date them. 
With the facts proven, the Senate 
must now ask: Do these charges meet 
the standard for impeachment? The 
President 
claims 
impeachment 
re-
quires charging him with a statutory 
crime, but that is a fringe view with 
patently absurd results. Their lead law-
yer 
making 
this 
argument, 
Alan 
Dershowitz, did not hold this view dur-
ing the Clinton impeachment; nor does 
Trump’s Attorney General, William 
Barr; 
nor 
does 
Jonathan 
Turley, 
Trump’s constitutional law expert at 
the House Judiciary Committee hear-
ing—nor does the authority cited by 
the President’s own lawyers here in the 
Senate and referenced nine times in 
their legal briefs. That authority, enti-
tled 
‘‘Impeachment: 
A 
Handbook’’ 
states that ‘‘the limitation of impeach-
able offenses to those offenses made 
generally criminal by statute is unwar-
ranted—even absurd.’’ 
This suggested standard has been 
roundly dismissed because it leads to 
ridiculous 
conclusions—for 
example, 
that a President could withhold tax-
payer-funded disaster assistance to the 
people of a State until their Governor 
endorsed the President for reelection. 
Even Alan Dershowitz recognized the 
folly of his own argument, so he 
switched to saying impeachment re-
quires ‘‘criminal-like’’ conduct. Well, 
the President’s actions here have all 
the markings of criminal-like conduct, 
including what the Founders would 
consider bribery and extortion. More-
over, as made clear by the nonpartisan 
legal opinion I requested from the 
GAO, the President and his team broke 
the impoundment control law as part 
of his overall extortion scheme. 
In fact, the toxic mix of misconduct 
we find here—a President corruptly 
using his office in a manner that com-
promises our national security to get a 
foreign government to help him stay in 
power—is exactly the kind of abuse of 
power our Founders most feared. 
Yet the President shows no sign of 
remorse or regret. His refusal to ac-
knowledge any wrongdoing is an ongo-
ing threat to our country and our Con-
stitution. Even as this impeachment 
process has proceeded, he has contin-
ued to solicit other countries, includ-
ing China, to help his reelection ef-
forts, as he says the Constitution gives 
him ‘‘the right to do whatever I want 
as President.’’ 
Let’s be honest. President Trump 
sees the Constitution not as a check on 
his powers but as a blank check to 
abuse power, and he will not change. 
His ongoing betrayal of the oath of of-
fice represents a clear and present dan-
ger to our Constitution, our democ-
racy, and the rule of law. 
Those who argue we must not remove 
the President before the next election 
ignore the fact that the Founders in-
cluded an impeachment clause in the 
same Constitution that establishes 4- 
year terms for the President. They 
wrote the impeachment clause for ex-
actly this moment, to prevent a cor-
rupt President from enlisting a foreign 
power to help him cheat in an election. 
President Trump has committed high 
crimes and misdemeanors against the 
Constitution, and we must use the 
Founders’ remedy. We must find him 
guilty and remove him from office. 
Failure to convict will send a terrible 
signal that this President and any fu-
ture President can commit crimes 
against the Constitution and the Amer-
ican people and get away with it. 
But it is not only the President who 
has violated his duty under the Con-
stitution. So, too, has this Senate, not 
because of the ultimate conclusion ex-
pected tomorrow but because of the 
flawed way the Senate will reach that 
decision. While I strongly disagree with 
acquittal, that verdict might be ac-
cepted by most Americans if reached 
through a real and a fair trial. But this 
Senate did not hold a real trial. It held 
the first impeachment proceeding in 
our history not to call a single witness 
or seek a single document. 
President Trump’s former National 
Security Advisor, John Bolton, offered 
us important information about the 
charges against the President. The 
Senate voted not to hear from him. 
President Trump said he wanted his 
Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, 
to testify at the Senate trial, but then 
he changed his mind and Senate Repub-
licans voted not to hear from him. I of-
fered to have the Chief Justice make 
decisions about relevant witnesses and 
documents, just as impartial judges do 
in trials every day across America. In 
fact, unlike in every other courtroom, 
it preserved the right of the Senate to 
overturn the Chief Justice’s decision 
by a majority vote. That is obviously a 
fair process for the President, but 
every 
Republican 
Senator 
voted

against it. And why? Because they are 
afraid of getting to the truth, the 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth. 
They know that, as more incriminating 
facts come out, it becomes harder to 
acquit. By joining the President’s 
coverup, they have become his accom-
plices. 
While the decision on the President 
will come tomorrow, the verdict on 
this 
Senate 
is 
already 
in—guilty, 
guilty of dereliction of its constitu-
tional duty to conduct an impartial 
trial. And because the trial was a farce, 
the final result will be seen by most of 
the country as illegitimate, the prod-
uct of a tainted trial. 
President Trump must understand 
this: There is no exoneration, no vindi-
cation, no real acquittal from a fake 
trial. In failing to adhere to the prin-
ciples of our Constitution and the val-
ues of our country, I fear we have done 
grievous injury to the nature of our de-
mocracy. I only hope America will find 
the resilience to repair the damage in 
the years to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan is recognized. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
swore an oath to defend the Constitu-
tion, both as an officer in the U.S. 
Navy Reserve and as a U.S. Senator. At 
the beginning of this impeachment 
trial, I swore an oath to keep an open 
mind, listen carefully to the facts, and, 
in the end, deliver impartial justice. 
After carefully listening to the argu-
ments presented by both House man-
agers and the President’s lawyers, I be-
lieve the facts are clear. President 
Trump stands accused by the House of 
Representatives of abusing his power in 
an attempt to extort a foreign govern-
ment to announce a trumped-up inves-
tigation into a political rival and 
thereby put his personal interest ahead 
of national security and the public 
trust. 
The President illegally withheld con-
gressionally approved military aid to 
an ally at war with Russia and condi-
tioned its release on Ukraine making 
an announcement the President could 
use to falsely discredit a likely polit-
ical opponent. 
When the President’s corrupt plan 
was brought to light, the White House 
engaged in a systematic and unprece-
dented effort to cover up the scheme. 
The President’s complete refusal to co-
operate with a constitutionally author-
ized investigation is unparalleled in 
American history. 
Despite the extraordinary efforts by 
the President to cover up the facts, the 
House managers made a convincing 
case. It is clear the President’s actions 
were not an effort to further official 
American foreign policy. The President 
was not working in the public interest. 
What the President did was wrong, un-
acceptable, and impeachable. 
I expected the President’s lawyers to 
offer new eyewitness testimony from 
people with firsthand knowledge and 
offer new documents to defend the 
President, but that did not happen. It 
became very clear to me that the 
President’s closest advisers could not 
speak to the President’s innocence, and 
his lawyers did everything in their 
power to prevent them from testifying 
under oath. 
No one in this country is above the 
law—no one, not even the President. If 
someone is accused of a crime and they 
have witnesses that could clear them of 
any wrongdoing, they would want 
those witnesses to testify. In fact, not 
only would they welcome it; they 
would insist on it. All we need to do is 
use some common sense. The fact that 
the President refuses to have his clos-
est advisers testify tells me that he is 
afraid of what they will say. 
The President’s conduct is unaccept-
able for any official, let alone the lead-
er of our country. Our Nation’s Found-
ers feared unchecked and unlimited 
power by the President. They rebelled 
against an abusive Monarch with un-
limited power and, instead, created a 
republic that distributed power across 
different branches of government. They 
were careful students of history. They 
knew unchecked power would destroy a 
democratic republic. They were espe-
cially fearful of an unchecked execu-
tive and specifically granted Congress 
the power of impeachment to check a 
President who thought of themselves 
as above the law. 
Two years ago, I had the privilege of 
participating in the annual bipartisan 
Senate tradition, reading President 
George Washington’s Farewell Address 
to the Senate. In that address, Presi-
dent 
Washington 
warned 
that 
un-
checked power, the rise of partisan fac-
tions and foreign influence, if left un-
checked, would undermine our young 
Nation and allow for the rise of a 
demagogue. He warned that we could 
become so divided and so entrenched in 
the beliefs of our particular partisan 
group that ‘‘cunning, ambitious, and 
unprincipled men will be enabled to 
subvert the power of the people and to 
usurp for themselves the reins of gov-
ernment.’’ 
I am struck by the contrast of where 
we are today and where our Founders 
were more than 200 years ago. George 
Washington was the ultimate rock star 
of his time. He was beloved, and when 
he announced he would leave the Presi-
dency and return to Mount Vernon, 
people begged him to stay. 
There was a call to make him a King, 
and he said no. He reminded folks that 
he had just fought against a Monarch 
so that the American people could 
enjoy the liberties of a free people. 
George Washington, a man of integrity 
and an American hero, refused to be 
anointed King when it was offered to 
him by his adoring countrymen. He 
chose a republic over a monarchy. 
But tomorrow, by refusing to hold 
President Trump accountable for his 
abuses, Republicans in the Senate are 
offering him unbridled power without 
accountability, and he will gleefully 
seize that power. And when he does, 
our Republic will face an existential 
threat. A vote against the Articles of 
Impeachment will set a dangerous 
precedent. It will be used by future 
Presidents to act with impunity. Given 
what we know—that the President 
abused his power in office by attempt-
ing to extort a foreign government to 
interfere with an American election; 
that he willfully obstructed justice at 
every turn; and that his actions run 
counter to our Nation’s most cherished 
and fundamental values—it is clear the 
President betrayed the trust the Amer-
ican public placed in him to fully exe-
cute his constitutional responsibilities. 
This betrayal is, by definition, a high 
crime and misdemeanor. If it does not 
rise to the level of impeachment and 
removal, I am not sure what would. 
The Senate has a constitutional re-
sponsibility to hold him accountable. If 
we do not stand up and defend our de-
mocracy during this fragile period, we 
will be allowing the President and fu-
ture Presidents to have unchecked 
power. This is not what our Founders 
intended. 
The oath I swore to protect and de-
fend the Constitution demands that I 
vote to preserve the future of our Re-
public. I will faithfully execute my 
oath and vote to hold this President 
accountable for his actions. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, may I say that it is a pleasure to 
speak to the Senate with the new Sen-
ator from Georgia presiding for the 
first time, at least, that I have had this 
occasion. 
Well, here we are. The impeachment 
outcome is settled, as it was from day 
one. In my view, the facts are clear, 
the conduct impeachable, and the ob-
struction unprecedented. 
In my view, this impeachment proc-
ess ran into a partisan wall, and the 
Senate’s part was to deny the Amer-
ican people the most basic elements of 
a fair trial: witnesses and evidence. 
Alexander 
Hamilton, 
years 
ago, 
warned us of what he called the ‘‘great-
est danger’’ in impeachments, ‘‘that 
the decision will be regulated more by 
the comparative strength of parties, 
than by the real demonstrations of in-
nocence or guilt.’’ 
In my view, that danger has met us. 
As a boy I often sang a hymn with 
the stanza that ‘‘to every man and na-
tion comes the moment to decide, in 
the strife of truth with falsehood, for 
the good or evil side.’’ 
In my view, the Senate chose the 
wrong side. 
We are obviously going to disagree 
about a lot here, so let me focus on two 
thoughts that perhaps we can agree on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S822 
February 4, 2020 
One is that what we have done here 
should carry little weight as precedent. 
Politics cast very long shadows over 
this proceeding. This was not our finest 
hour, by any stretch, and much of what 
was said and done here should not be 
repeated, let alone treated as prece-
dent. 
I hope history treats this episode as 
an aberration, not a precedent. 
Too many things that are right and 
proper had to be bent or broken to get 
to the preordained result, and too 
much of what was said by White House 
counsel was not only wrong but dis-
graceful. 
The presentation in this Chamber by 
White House counsel was characterized 
by smarminess, smear, elision, out-
right misstatement, and various dis-
honest rhetorical tricks that I doubt 
they would dare pull before judges. 
Knowing that we were a captive and 
silent audience, knowing the outcome 
was predetermined in their favor, and 
grandstanding for a TV audience, par-
ticularly an audience of one, they de-
livered a performance that leaves a 
stain on the pages of the Senate 
RECORD. 
Perhaps there will be consequences 
for some of their conduct in our Cham-
ber. 
The conduct of White House counsel 
in the Trump impeachment trial raise 
grave concerns. 
A staunch Republican friend, who is 
an able and eminent lawyer, emailed 
me about a White House counsel argu-
ment, calling it ‘‘the most shocking 
thing I have seen a ‘serious’ lawyer say 
in my entire legal career.’’ He referred 
to Professor Dershowitz, but the con-
duct of White House counsel in this 
matter has indeed been shocking far 
beyond 
the 
excesses 
of 
Professor 
Dershowitz. 
In some cases, we do not know who 
pays them. Mr. Sekulow is evidently 
anonymously paid, with dark money, 
through a mail drop box. Who is he 
working for here? Does his secret bene-
factor create a conflict for him? We 
should know. 
Among them are lawyers who appear 
to have grave professional conflicts. 
They represent the President although 
they are fact witnesses to conduct 
charged in the impeachment. This con-
cern was brought to their attention by 
House letter on January 21, 2020, put-
ting them on notice. They ignored the 
letter. 
The House argued that members of 
the White House counsel team actually 
administered a massive cover-up, using 
extreme and unprecedented arguments 
to protect a blanket defiance against 
congressional 
inquiry 
into 
alleged 
Presidential misdeeds, with the intent 
to hide evidence of those misdeeds. 
There is new evidence that counsel 
were not just fact witnesses, but 
present at meetings in which the 
scheme at issue was advanced, and the 
misconduct alleged was confessed to, 
by the President. Being present during 
the commission of the offense and wit-
ness to an overt act in furtherance of 
the alleged scheme is more grave than 
being a mere fact witness. This needs 
further inquiry, but it raises the ques-
tion of actual participation in the 
crime or fraud or misconduct at issue, 
which would waive their attorney-cli-
ent privilege. 
They have not been candid about the 
law. They have argued over and over 
that they will delay the Senate pro-
ceedings by litigation in United States 
District Courts if we allow witnesses or 
subpoenas, mentioning only once, in 
their pretrial brief, the case of Walter 
Nixon v. United States, where the Su-
preme Court save the federal Judiciary 
‘‘no role’’ in senate impeachment pro-
ceedings, warning ‘‘that opening the 
door of judicial review to the proce-
dures used by the Senate in trying im-
peachments would ‘expose the political 
life of the country to months, or per-
haps years, of chaos,’ ’’ the very delay 
White House lawyers have threatened. 
Further investigation may reveal 
whether various counsel made, or per-
mitted co-counsel to make, arguments 
at odds with facts to which they were 
witness, 
thereby 
deliberately 
mis-
leading the Senate. For a lawyer to 
participate in or be immediate witness 
to criminal or impeachable wrongful 
activity; and then practice as a counsel 
in matters related to that criminal or 
impeachable or wrongful activity; and 
then conceal from that tribunal what 
they knew about that criminal or im-
peachable or wrongful activity, and 
even affirmatively mislead that tri-
bunal about the misconduct as they 
witnessed it, would be attorney mis-
conduct of the gravest nature. 
In light of these problems, one recur-
ring argument by White House counsel 
takes on new meaning. In an often 
conflated argument, White House coun-
sel insisted that no crime was alleged 
in the House of Representatives’ Arti-
cles of Impeachment and that there 
was no crime committed. If, as recent 
evidence suggests, at least one White 
House counsel was present at and par-
ticipated in a meeting in furtherance 
of the scheme at issue, the argument 
that the scheme was not criminal is 
deeply self-serving. That self-serving 
nature is precisely why counsel under 
that sort of conflict of interest should 
not appear in proceedings addressing 
conduct which they witnessed, which 
they aided or abetted, or in which they 
participated. 
White House counsel used their time 
before us to smear non-parties; to 
present virtual political commercials; 
to misstate, exaggerate or mislead 
about legal propositions; to misstate, 
exaggerate or mislead about factual 
propositions; to misstate, exaggerate 
or mislead about House managers’ ar-
guments; and to float conspiracy theo-
ries and unsupported political charges 
to the public audience. In some cases, 
arguments are deeply unfair: for in-
stance, calling secondary witnesses’ 
testimony hearsay and secondhand at 
the same time they are blocking the di-
rect witnesses’ testimony. It was in 
sum, a sordid spectacle, one that few if 
any courts would have tolerated. They 
came into our House, and dirtied it. 
So enough of my professional disgust 
with their performance, but let us 
agree that this ought not be precedent. 
Let us also agree on something else. 
There is one particular argument the 
White House made that we should 
trample, discard, and put out into the 
trash: the notion that a U.S. district 
court can supervise our Senate im-
peachment proceeding. I truly hope we 
can agree on this. 
As a Court of Impeachment, we are 
constituted at the Founders’ command. 
The Chief Justice presided in that seat 
at the Founders’ command. We con-
vened as a body at the Founders’ com-
mand. And at the Founders’ command, 
the Senate—the Senate—has the sole 
power to try all impeachments. 
Every signal from the Constitution 
directs that we try impeachments and 
no part of the Senate’s power to do so 
is conferred anywhere else in the gov-
ernment. It is on us. 
The 
President’s 
counsel 
proposed 
that they may interrupt the Senate’s 
trial of impeachment, delay the Sen-
ate’s trial of impeachment, in order to 
go down the street to the U.S. district 
court to litigate our trial determina-
tions about evidence and privilege—de-
terminations in our proceeding. 
There are three arguments against 
that proposition. The most obvious one 
is the Constitution. The Constitution 
puts the trial in the hands of the Sen-
ate sitting as a Court of Impeachment 
and makes no mention of any role for 
any court to supervise or pass on the 
Senate’s conduct of this trial. It is sim-
ply not in the Constitution. 
The second argument is the improb-
ability—the 
improbability—that 
the 
Founders would convene the U.S. Sen-
ate as a Court of Impeachment, bring 
the managers of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives over here to present their 
charges, put the Chief Justice of the 
U.S. Supreme Court into that chair to 
preside over the trial, give the Senate 
the sole power to try the impeachment, 
and then allow a defendant to run down 
the street to a district judge and inter-
rupt the proceedings. That idea is con-
trary to common sense as well as con-
stitutional order. 
The impeachment provisions of the 
Constitution 
were 
adopted 
by 
the 
Founders in September of 1787, after 
that long, hot summer in Philadelphia, 
and ratified with the Constitution in 
1788. The Judiciary Act establishing 
lower courts did not pass until 1789. It 
is hard to imagine that the Founders 
meant the proceedings and determina-
tions of our Senate Court of Impeach-
ment to be subject to the oversight of 
a judge down the road from us whose 
office did not even exist at the time. 
The Founders in the Constitution put 
this squarely on us. No one else is men-
tioned. It is our ‘‘sole Power.’’ It is the 
duty of the Chief Justice under the 
Constitution to preside over the trial.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S823 
February 4, 2020 
It is his duty to make appropriate rul-
ings. And it is on us to live with that, 
unless—as we may—we choose to over-
rule the Chief Justice as a body, by re-
corded vote, and live with that. We run 
this trial—the Senators, the Senate— 
no one else. We are responsible to the 
people of the United States to run this 
trial. We were trusted by the Founders 
to live up to those responsibilities. 
When we sit as a Court of Impeach-
ment, it is all on us. The Founders put 
it squarely on us. We took that job 
when we took our oaths. That means 
we control the trial rulings, the tim-
ing, the evidence determinations, and 
the privileges we will accept. We can 
accept the rulings of the Chief Justice 
or we can reverse them, but it is our 
job. 
Previous impeachments record the 
Senate making just such rulings. Never 
has the Senate referred such a ruling 
to a court. Indeed, in Walter Nixon v. 
United States, 506 U.S. 224, a 1993 deci-
sion, the Supreme Court held that Fed-
eral courts have no power to review 
procedures used by the Senate in try-
ing impeachments, that it was a non-
justiciable political question, and that 
‘‘the Judiciary, and the Supreme Court 
in particular, were not chosen to have 
any role in impeachments.’’ 
The Supreme Court in that decision 
even foresaw the delays that White 
House Counsel threatened us with and 
saw them as an argument against any 
judicial role. The Court said that 
‘‘opening the door of judicial review to 
the procedures used by the Senate in 
trying impeachments would expose the 
political life of the country to months, 
or perhaps years, of chaos,’’ and the 
Court immediately went on to particu-
larly highlight that concern with re-
spect to the impeachment of a Presi-
dent. 
It would have been nice if White 
House Counsel, when they were in this 
Chamber arguing for their threatened 
delays, would have addressed this Su-
preme Court decision. 
The Constitution, common sense, and 
our impeachment precedents all put 
the responsibility for a Senate trial of 
impeachment 
squarely 
on 
us. 
We 
should not—we should never—shirk 
that responsibility. 
This has been a sad and sordid mo-
ment for the Senate. It has done harm 
enough. Let it not provide any credit 
to this false White House argument, 
and let this not be precedent for future 
Presidential misconduct. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota is recognized. 
Ms. SMITH. Madam President, this 
morning, I let Minnesotans know that 
I will vote to remove President Donald 
Trump from office. I rise today be-
cause, on this historic vote, I want 
Minnesotans to understand why and 
where I think we go from here. 
I was reluctant to go down the path 
of impeachment. While I strongly dis-
agree with the President on many 
issues, I see impeachment as a last re-
sort, and I feared that leaping to im-
peachment would only serve to drive us 
even further into our political corners. 
This changed when I read the whistle-
blower report, which alleged nothing 
less than the President’s corrupt abuse 
of power, an abuse that had the poten-
tial to undermine our election in 2020. 
For me, this left no choice but for the 
House to fully investigate these allega-
tions. 
When the House sent the two Articles 
of Impeachment to the Senate, it be-
came my job to ‘‘do impartial justice 
according to the Constitution and the 
laws,’’ and I take that oath as seriously 
as anything I have ever done. 
This impeachment trial has been 
about whether the President’s corrupt 
abuse of power—power that he used for 
his own personal, political benefit 
while betraying the public trust—is a 
high crime and misdemeanor as defined 
by the Founders of our Constitution. 
I believe that it is, and I also believe 
that to condone corrupt behavior such 
as this undermines the core values we 
stand for as a nation that no one is 
above the law, including and most es-
pecially the President. 
Over the past several weeks, I have 
listened carefully to hundreds of hours 
of presentations, questions and an-
swers, and read thousands of pages of 
documents. Through it all, the facts 
underlying the case against the Presi-
dent were never really refuted. 
The President, working through his 
personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, with-
held Ukrainian security assistance and 
a prestigious meeting in the White 
House in an effort to persuade Presi-
dent Zelensky to announce he was in-
vestigating Joe Biden and the theory 
that Ukraine interfered in our 2016 
elections. In order to improve his pros-
pects for reelection, Trump directed 
that vital assistance be withheld until 
Ukraine announced investigations into 
a baseless conspiracy theory that origi-
nated as Russian propaganda, and he 
only released the aid when he was 
found out. 
Then, when the House sought to in-
vestigate these actions, the Trump 
White House categorically blocked any 
and all subpoenas for documents and 
witnesses. No U.S. President has ever 
categorically rejected the power of 
Congress to investigate and do over-
sight of the executive branch—not 
Nixon, not Clinton. This obstruction 
fractures the balance of power between 
the legislative and executive branches. 
How can our constitutional system 
work if we allow the President to de-
cide if and how Congress can inves-
tigate the President’s misconduct? It 
can’t. If we say that the President can 
decide when he cooperates with a con-
gressional investigation, we are saying 
that he is above the law. 
While evidence of the President’s 
wrongdoing is substantial, I advocated 
every way I could for a trial that would 
be fair for both sides, which means 
hearing from witnesses with direct 
knowledge of the President’s actions. I 
am greatly disappointed that almost 
all of my Republican colleagues in the 
Senate abandoned the historical, bipar-
tisan precedent of hearing from wit-
nesses in every Senate impeachment 
trial. 
Ultimately, when so many people 
know the truth of what happened, the 
complete truth will come out. Yet the 
Senate abandoned its responsibilities 
when it blocked efforts to get the com-
plete truth here in this Chamber. As a 
result, there will be a permanent cloud 
over these proceedings. The President 
may be acquitted, but without a fair 
trial he cannot claim to be exonerated. 
The core question of this impeach-
ment trial is this: Do we say that it is 
OK for the President to use his office 
to advance his personal political inter-
ests while ignoring or damaging the 
public good? My answer is no. 
Corruptly soliciting a foreign govern-
ment to interfere in our elections and 
to announce an investigation to dam-
age a political rival and an American 
citizen at the expense of free and fair 
elections and our national security— 
that is the definition of an abuse of 
power. This is what Alexander Ham-
ilton was talking about when he wrote 
that impeachment proceedings should 
concern ‘‘the abuse or violation of 
some public trust.’’ 
Some have argued that what the 
President did was wrong, but his con-
duct does not rise to the level of im-
peachment. They agree that the Presi-
dent used his power to secure an unfair 
advantage in our elections but think 
that this abuse of power isn’t that bad. 
It isn’t bad enough to remove him from 
office. 
It is that bad. Trump’s abuses of 
power are grave offenses that threaten 
the constitutional balance of power 
and the core value that no one, espe-
cially the President, is above the law. 
The President’s abuse of power under-
mines the integrity of our next elec-
tion and calls into question whether 
our elections will be free and fair. His 
abuses of power damage national secu-
rity by undermining the moral stature 
of the United States as a trusted ally 
and as a fighter against corruption. 
For me, one of the saddest moments 
of this trial was the testimony from 
American diplomats who urged Ukrain-
ian leaders not to engage in political 
investigations. According to the testi-
mony, the Ukrainians responded by 
saying, in effect: Do you mean like the 
investigations you are asking us to do 
with the Bidens and the Clintons? 
Some have said that we should wait 
and let the American people decide in 
the next election, only months away. 
But when the President has solicited 
foreign nations to influence our elec-
tions with disinformation and has pre-
vented the American people from hear-
ing a full and fair accounting of that 
effort, our duty to defend the Constitu-
tion requires that we act now. A vote 
to remove the President from office 
protects our next election.

allow the Senate to consider election

security 
legislation 
and 
when 
the 
President shows no remorse and says 
publicly that he is ready to do it again, 
we have no choice but to act. When the 
President says that the Constitution 
allows him to do whatever he wants, 
Congress must act. 
The President’s conduct is a threat 
to our elections and our national secu-
rity. What is more, if we fail to check 
this President, future Presidents may 
be emboldened to pursue even more 
shameless schemes. 
Lots of countries have high-minded 
constitutions full of powerful words 
and strong enunciations of rights that 
don’t really mean anything. As House 
manager ADAM
SCHIFF
pointed out, 
Russia has a Constitution like this. 
Our Constitution is different. It is not 
some dry, historic document that we 
keep behind glass in a museum. It is 
the big idea of our system of govern-
ment that no one is above the law, and 
people, not Monarchs, are the source of 
power. Everything—everything—flows 
from this great idea realized in the 
lives of Minnesotans who, every day, 
seek the freedom and the opportunities 
they need to build the lives they want. 
There is nothing inevitable about de-
mocracy. It is not a natural state. It is 
a state that we have to fight for. The 
fight for democracy and our Constitu-
tion has chosen us in this moment, and 
it is our job to rise to this moment. 
After the Senate vote, the work of re-
inforcing the American values of fair-
ness and justice will continue. We have 
a lot of work to do. Democracy is hard 
work, and I know that Minnesotans are 
up to it. The truth is that I see more 
signs of common ground, hope, and de-
termination in Minnesota than I do the 
fractures of division, distrust, and par-
tisanship, and that is a foundation for 
us all to build on going forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the great 
irony of the last several weeks in the 
impeachment trial is that the Demo-
crats accused the President of using his 
governmental office to go after his po-
litical opponent. The irony is, they 
then used the impeachment process to 
go after their political opponent. In 
fact, as you look at the way it un-
folded, they admitted as much. 
As the impeachment proceedings un-
folded, they said: We didn’t have time 
for witnesses. We had to get it done be-
fore Christmas because we wanted it 
done and ready to go for the election. 
We had to get it done—the entire proc-
ess needed to be completed—before the 
election. 
They didn’t have time for the proc-
ess. They didn’t have time for due proc-
ess. They didn’t have time for the 
President to call his own witnesses or 
cross-examine their witnesses. 
The great irony is, they did exactly 
what they accused the President of. 
They used the government and the gov-
ernment’s process to go after their po-
litical opponent. 
What is the evidence that it is par-
tisan? They didn’t convince one Repub-
lican. Not one elected Republican de-
cided that any of their arguments were 
valid or that the President should be 
impeached. 
They made it into a sham. They 
made it into a political process because 
they didn’t like the results of the elec-
tion. 
When did this start? Did the im-
peachment start with a phone call to 
the Ukrainian President? No, the im-
peachment and the attacks on the 
President started 6 months before he 
was elected. 
We had something truly devastating 
to our Republic happen. We had, for the 
first time in our history, a secret court 
decide to investigate a campaign. At 
the time, when those of us who criti-
cized this secret court for spying on 
the Trump campaign, they said: Oh, it 
is just a conspiracy theory. None of 
this is happening. There is no ‘‘there’’ 
there. 
But now that we have investigated 
it—guess what—the FISA court admits 
they were lied to. The FBI has now 
been proven to have lied 17 times. We 
have a half a dozen people at the top 
level of our intelligence community 
who have admitted to having extreme 
bias. You have Peter Strzok and Lisa 
Page talking about taking down the 
President and having an insurance pol-
icy against him succeeding and becom-
ing the President. You have McCabe, 
you have Comey, and you have Clapper. 
You remember James Clapper, the 
one who came to the Senate, and, when 
asked by Senator WYDEN, ‘‘Are you 
storing, are you gathering information 
from Americans by the millions and 
storing it on government computers?’’ 
James Clapper said no. He lied to Con-
gress. Nobody chose to impeach him, 
but he lied to Congress and committed 
a felony. Is he in jail? No, he is making 
millions of dollars as a contributor on 
television now, using and peddling his 
national security influence for dollars, 
after having committed a felony in 
lying to us. 
These are the people who plotted to 
bring the President down. These are 
the people who continue to plot to 
bring the President down. Before all of 
this started, though, I was a critic of 
the secret courts. I was a critic of 
FISA. I was a critic of them abusing 
American civil liberties. I was a critic 
of them invading our privacy, record-
ing the length of our phone calls, who 
we talk to, and sometimes recording 
conversations—all of this done sup-
posedly to go after terrorists, but 
Americans, by the millions, are caught 
up in this web. 
But now, for the first time, it is not 
just American civil liberties that are 
being abused by our intelligence agen-
cies. It is an entire Presidential cam-
paign, and it could go either way. This 
is why you want to limit power. Men 
are not angels, and that is why we put 
restrictions on government. We need 
more restrictions now. We can’t allow 
secret courts to investigate campaigns. 
This started before the election. It 
went on for the last 3 years, through 
the 
Mueller 
investigation. 
They 
thought they had the President dead to 
rights, and they would bring him down 
through this investigation. So, ini-
tially, the spying didn’t work, and the 
Mueller 
investigation 
didn’t 
work. 
They went seamlessly into the im-
peachment. 
The question for the American public 
is now: Will they go on? Are they going 
to immediately start up hearings again 
in the House that will be partisan hear-
ings again? I suspect they will. They 
have had their day in the Sun, and they 
loved it, and I think they are going to 
keep doing it time and time and time 
again. 
Now, during the proceedings, I asked 
a question that was disallowed, but I 
am going to ask that question again 
this morning, because the Constitution 
does protect debate and does protect 
the asking of questions. I think they 
made a big mistake not allowing my 
question. 
My question did not talk about any-
body who is a whistleblower. My ques-
tion did not accuse anybody of being a 
whistleblower. It did not make a state-
ment believing there was someone who 
was a whistleblower. I simply named 
two people’s names because I think it 
is very important to know what hap-
pened. 
We are now finding out that the 
FISA 
investigation 
was 
predicated 
upon 17 lies by the FBI, by people at 
high levels who were biased against the 
President, and it turns out it was an il-
legitimate investigation. Everything 
they did about investigating the Presi-
dent was untrue and abused govern-
ment to do something they never 
should have done in the first place. 
So I asked this question. And this is 
my question—my exact question. We 
will put it up here: 
Are you aware that the House Intelligence 
Committee staffer Shawn Misko had a close 
relationship with Eric Ciaramella while at 
the National Security Council together? Are 
you aware and how do you respond to reports 
that Ciaramella and Misko may have worked 
together to plot impeaching the President 
before there were formal House impeach-
ment proceedings? 
Now, why did I ask this question? Be-
cause there are news reports saying 
that these two people—one of them 
who works for ADAM SCHIFF and one of 
them who worked with this person at 
the National Security Council—that 
they knew each other and had been 
overheard talking about impeaching 
the President in the first month of his 
office. In January of 2017, they were al-
ready plotting the impeachment. 
And you say: Well, we should protect 
the whistleblower. The whistleblower 
deserves anonymity. 
The law does not preserve anonym-
ity. His boss is not supposed to say 
anything about him. He is not supposed 
to be fired. I am for that. 
But when you get into the details of 
talking about whistleblowers, there is 
a variety of opinions around here. The

greatest whistleblower in American 
history, in all likelihood, is Edward 
Snowden. What did people want to do 
with him? Half the people here want to 
put him to death and the other half 
want to put him in jail forever. So it 
depends on what you blow the whistle 
on, whether or not they are actually 
for the whistleblower statute. 
I am not for retributions on the whis-
tleblower. I don’t want him to go to 
jail, and I don’t want him to lose his 
job. But if six people, who all work to-
gether at the National Security Coun-
cil, knew each other and gamed the 
system, knowing that they would get 
these protections—they gamed the sys-
tem in order to try to bring down the 
President—we should know about that. 
If they had extreme bias going into the 
impeachment, we should know about 
that. 
I think the question is an important 
one, and I think we should still get to 
the bottom of it. Were people plotting 
to bring down the President? They 
were plotting in advance of the elec-
tion. Were they plotting within the 
halls of government to bring down the 
President? Look, these people also 
knew the Vindman brothers, who are 
still in government. So you have two 
Vindman brothers over there who know 
Eric Ciaramella, who also know Sean 
Misko, who also knew two people work-
ing on ADAM SCHIFF’s staff, and ADAM 
SCHIFF throws his hands up and says: I 
don’t know who the whistleblower is. I 
have never met him. I have no idea who 
he is. 
So if he doesn’t know who he is and 
the President’s counsel doesn’t know 
who he is, how does the Chief Justice of 
the United States know who the whis-
tleblower is? I have no independent 
confirmation from anyone in govern-
ment as to who the whistleblower is. 
So how am I prevented from asking a 
question when nobody seems to admit 
that they even know who this person 
is? 
My point is, is by having such protec-
tions—such overzealous protection—we 
don’t get to the root of the matter of 
how this started, because this could 
happen again. When the institution of 
the bureaucracy, when the intelligence 
community with all the power to listen 
to every phone conversation you have 
has political bias and can game the 
system to go after you, that is a real 
worry. It is a real worry that they 
spied on the President. 
But what if you are an average ordi-
nary American? What if you are just a 
supporter of President Trump or you 
are a Republican or you are a conserv-
ative? Are we not concerned that se-
cret courts could allow for warrants to 
listen to your phone calls, to tap into 
your emails, to read your text mes-
sages? I am very concerned about that. 
So we are going to have this discus-
sion go on. It isn’t really about the 
whistleblower so much. It is about re-
forming government. It is about lim-
iting the power of what they can do as 
secret courts. I think the FISA Court 
should be restricted from ever inves-
tigating campaigns. If you think a 
campaign has done something wrong, 
call the FBI, go to a regular court, 
where judges get to appear on both 
sides, and if you want to subpoena 
somebody or tap the phone, all right, 
we can do it, but it has got to be an ex-
traordinary thing. 
Think about it. Think about the dan-
ger. The other side says it is a danger 
to democracy. Think about the danger 
to democracy of letting your govern-
ment tap the phones of people you dis-
agree with politically. 
I don’t care whether it is Republican 
or Democrat. We cannot allow the in-
telligence 
community 
and 
secret 
courts like the FISA court to go after 
political campaigns. And I mean that 
sincerely—Republican or Democrat. We 
need to change the rules. We cannot 
have secret courts trying to reverse the 
elections. 
I feel very strongly about this. I was 
for this reform before Donald Trump 
ever came on the scene and before any 
of this happened. I have been for hav-
ing more significant restrictions on 
these secret courts and more signifi-
cant restrictions on the intelligence 
community to make sure they don’t 
abuse the rights of Americans. This is 
a big deal, and if we are going to get 
something good out of this, if there is 
going to be some positive aspect to 
having to go through this nightmare 
we have been through over the last sev-
eral months or years now, the blessing 
in disguise here would be that we actu-
ally reform the system so this never 
happens to anyone else ever again. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I rise 
to voice my opposition to these Arti-
cles of Impeachment. I want the people 
of Nebraska to know how I will vote 
and why, as the Senate prepares for the 
trial’s final vote. 
I took an oath to uphold the Con-
stitution, and I have a responsibility to 
be an impartial juror during the trial. 
I have given fair and careful consid-
eration to the evidence presented dur-
ing this trial, and I have engaged in the 
questioning process. This is a process 
that should be about facts and fairness, 
and that is what the Senate has done 
its very best to do, but the reality is 
that the House of Representatives 
didn’t do its job. 
Under the Constitution and by prece-
dent, the impeachment investigation is 
the responsibility of the House, not the 
Senate. Hearings in the House inquiry 
during the Nixon impeachment inves-
tigation lasted for 14 months. The Clin-
ton impeachment House inquiry relied 
on years of prior investigation and 
overwhelming amounts of testimony 
from firsthand witnesses. President 
Trump’s inquiry in the House was deep-
ly partisan, and it lasted only 12 weeks. 
Disturbingly, there was a lack of due 
process during this House investiga-
tion. The President was not allowed to 
have his lawyers cross-examine wit-
nesses at the House Intelligence Com-
mittee hearings and depositions. This 
is the committee that was the lead on 
the investigative hearings. Shockingly, 
the President of the United States was 
prevented from participating in the 
House’s impeachment for 71 of the 78 
days of investigation. Our founding 
document protects the right of the ac-
cused. 
The 
Constitution 
explicitly 
states that no one should ‘‘be deprived 
of life, liberty or property without due 
process of law.’’ Our blueprint for free-
dom protects all individuals’ rights, 
whether that person is a truckdriver, a 
farmer, a businesswoman, or the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
The third branch of government—our 
court system—is of foundational im-
portance, and we have it for a reason. 
That reason is to provide every Amer-
ican with the opportunity to have jus-
tice in a fair way in accordance with 
the Constitution and the rule of law. 
But because House Democrats were in 
a rush to impeach the President before 
their holiday break, they decided to 
abandon the courts completely. 
It was the House’s constitutional 
right to subpoena witnesses. It was the 
President’s constitutional right to as-
sert privilege. And it was the court’s 
constitutional right to enforce sub-
poenas. The House did not petition the 
court to enforce subpoenas. Short- 
circuiting the process led to an incom-
plete investigation by the House. 
Article 1, section 3 of the Constitu-
tion provides that ‘‘the Senate shall 
have the sole Power to try all Impeach-
ments.’’ If the Senate were to become 
the factfinder in an impeachment in-
vestigation, 
it 
would 
completely 
change the role of the Senate from this 
point forward, this hallowed Chamber, 
the world’s greatest deliberative body. 
It would become an investigative arm 
of the House. Setting this precedent 
would have a devastating effect on our 
political institution, transforming the 
very nature of the Senate during im-
peachment hearings for generations to 
come. 
The Senate is supposed to conduct a 
fair trial, protect the Constitution, and 
guarantee due process of law. 
My Republican colleagues and I un-
derstand the gravity of these pro-
ceedings. The record shows that Presi-
dent Clinton’s impeachment trial was 
met with a motion filed by Senator 
Byrd to dismiss the Articles of Im-
peachment early on. This time, not a 
single Senator filed such a motion. We 
approached this process with the seri-
ousness it deserves. 
Senate Republicans supported a reso-
lution that gave the House managers 
more than ample time to lay out their 
case. Since then, we have heard an ex-
traordinary amount of information 
over the last 2 weeks. The House man-
agers presented 192 video clips with tes-
timony from 13 witnesses and sub-
mitted more than 28,000 pages of docu-
ments. Senators then submitted 180 
questions. After 2 weeks of trial argu-
ments, the House managers failed to

make a compelling case that the Presi-
dent should be removed from office; 
therefore, I will vote for the Presi-
dent’s acquittal. 
I firmly believe it is time for the 
Senate to move forward and return to 
the people’s business. It is time to 
refocus our attention on our bipartisan 
work: providing for our servicemem-
bers, caring for our veterans, funding 
research to cure diseases that cut short 
too many lives, fighting the opioid ad-
diction, and improving our criminal 
justice system. 
So I speak to Nebraskans and to all 
Americans in urging every Senator in 
this Chamber to have the courage, the 
heart, and the vision to move past this 
process and work together toward a 
brighter future for generations to 
come. That should be our mindset at 
this pivotal moment. That should be 
our mindset in everything we do. 
I urge my colleagues to take the long 
view and fulfill our constitutional role. 
Let’s reunite around our common goals 
and our values. Let’s bring this process 
to an end and advance policies that 
will make life better for Nebraskans 
and better for all Americans. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss why I will be voting to 
acquit President Trump on both Arti-
cles of Impeachment tomorrow after-
noon. 
Our Constitution makes clear that 
only a particularly grave act—‘‘trea-
son, bribery, or other high crimes and 
misdemeanors’’—would justify a Sen-
ate voting to reverse the will of the 
people, the voters, and remove from of-
fice the person they chose to lead this 
Nation. 
Besides making clear just how seri-
ous an offense needs to be in order to 
warrant impeachment, our founding 
document allows the President to re-
main in office unless two-thirds of our 
body—the Senate—votes for impeach-
ment. To me, that underscores the 
need for a national consensus that runs 
across partisan lines before undoing an 
election. 
The Senate has never in our history 
removed a President from office fol-
lowing an impeachment trial. 
Our Founding Fathers recognized 
that impeachment should not be used 
as a blunt partisan instrument. 
President Trump was duly elected by 
the people of this country to be Presi-
dent of the United States in 2016. Noth-
ing that I have heard in this process 
has come close to providing a reason 
that would justify my voting to over-
turn the choice made by nearly half a 
million West Virginians and tens of 
millions of other Americans and even 
further—even further—to remove him 
from the ballot in 2020. 
There is no doubt that the House im-
peachment process was partisan, politi-
cally driven, and denied President 
Trump some of his most basic rights of 
due process. At the same time, the 
product that was brought to our Cham-
ber was obviously flimsy, rushed, and 
contained incomplete evidence. 
Time and again, House managers de-
manded that we do things here in the 
Senate that they neglected to do them-
selves during their House proceedings, 
such as calling witnesses they refused 
to call—witnesses they are now asking 
us to bring forward. 
Regardless of the failings of the 
House managers, it is the Senate’s job 
and, indeed, our oath to do impartial 
justice. In keeping with that oath, I 
supported a trial process that was mod-
eled after the Senate’s precedent in 
1999, when it received the approval of 
100 Senators. I am glad we conducted 
this trial under that process because I 
felt it was fair to both sides. 
Both the managers and the Presi-
dent’s attorneys were given 3 full days 
in the Senate to present their respec-
tive cases, and Senators spent 2 full 
days—16 hours—asking questions and 
receiving answers from the parties. Ac-
tually, I found that very instructive. 
The Senate heard testimony from wit-
nesses in 192 video segments—some of 
them repetitive—and received more 
than 28,000 pages of documents. The 
House record, which we received here 
in the Senate, included the testimony 
of 17 witnesses. So there were wit-
nesses. The House brought witness tes-
timony into the Senate. 
I keenly listened to these presen-
tations with an open mind, and I have 
concluded that the arguments and evi-
dence do not provide me with a suffi-
cient rationale for reversing the 2016 
election 
and 
removing 
President 
Trump from the ballot in 2020. That is 
especially true considering the par-
tisan nature of this impeachment proc-
ess. 
In the cases of President Nixon and 
President Clinton, there was signifi-
cant support from House Members of 
the President’s party for opening im-
peachment inquiries. The impeachment 
inquiry into President Nixon was sup-
ported by more than 400 Members of 
the House, many of those—an over-
whelming number of those—from his 
own party. And 31 House Democrats 
voted to open an impeachment inquiry 
into their President, the Democratic 
President, President Clinton. 
By contrast, in this case, not a single 
Member of the President’s party voted 
in the House of Representatives to 
start an impeachment inquiry or to 
adopt either Article of Impeachment 
against the President. 
Many of the President’s political op-
ponents want—and have wanted for 
years—to have him removed from of-
fice, while virtually no one in his own 
party supports this impeachment. 
We have a mechanism in this country 
for dealing with issues that divide 
along party lines. That mechanism is 
not impeachment or removal. That 
mechanism, quite simply, is an elec-
tion, and we have one in 9 months. So, 
beginning yesterday, we think, and in 9 
months, we will have the certainty ev-
eryone desires. 
In the meantime, I am casting a ‘‘no’’ 
vote in this Chamber tomorrow. I am 
voting no on both of these articles. But 
do you know what? I am also going to 
do something else. I am going to take 
this opportunity to rededicate myself 
to the principles that this U.S. Senate 
stands for. I am going to take this op-
portunity to look at those principles 
and appreciate that these are the prin-
ciples that are tied to making America 
better each and every day. Together we 
can do this, as Republicans and Demo-
crats. 
During the impeachment process, Re-
publicans approached me all the time— 
West Virginians approached me all the 
time, regardless of party, to ask why 
we were spending all of this time on a 
wasted process. They asked me ques-
tions like, Why don’t you just get on 
with the business of giving America 
the confidence that you are working on 
the things that we care about—this was 
the butcher in the grocery store who 
asked me this very question—our fami-
lies, making our families stronger, our 
lives better, and our jobs more perma-
nent? 
When we rid ourselves of the shackles 
of politics, we can truly work together 
on 
issues 
like 
transportation, 
broadband, energy, ending the drug cri-
sis, or strengthening our military. 
These are the issues that affect all of 
us. These are the issues that transcend 
the day-to-day lives of all the people 
we represent. They also transcend the 
day-to-day sound bites we hear from 
the constant barrage of both positive 
and negative media to which we are so 
attuned. 
No one has been served by this in-
tense—and, at times, sensationalized— 
and very divisive proceeding. When we 
rid ourselves of the poisonous venom of 
partisan politics, we see more clearly. 
We know that we don’t always agree. 
That is pretty clear. But we can cer-
tainly find common ground, and we do, 
as was envisioned by our Founders. 
So let’s all just take a deep breath 
and move on from here. Let’s listen to 
our better voices. Those are the Ameri-
cans we represent, who remind us every 
day how important our freedom and 
our futures are to the country and to 
the constitutional institutions that 
gird our values. 
We sure have work to do. The Amer-
ican public expects us to do better. We 
should expect that of ourselves. After 
these wayward few weeks, there is no 
question we will need to rebuild that 
confidence. Do you know what? I am in 
this for the long haul, as I know the 
Presiding Officer is—the one where 
West Virginians and Texans and Amer-
icans see better days ahead for them-
selves and their children; the ones 
where West Virginians, Texans, and 
Americans drive to work each day and 
hear that Congress is actually doing its 
job. We were sent to Congress to work

February 4, 2020 
for the American people, to deliver re-
sults, to renew their faith in our insti-
tutions, to rise above our own parties, 
and to make life better. 
I have always been humbled by the 
confidence that has been placed in me 
by my fellow West Virginians. It is 
truly an honor to serve, and it is one 
that comes with great responsibility. 
We need to roll up our sleeves, stop the 
bickering, and deliver. 
I am looking at a lot of young people 
here in the Hall of the Senate, and I am 
thinking: How can I do better for you 
all? That is where our future lies. 
I am an eternal optimist. I always 
have been. I am optimistic that we can 
find the solutions that move our coun-
try forward. Sure, there will be dif-
ferences of opinion. There will prob-
ably be some harsh and sharp words 
along the way and differences in our 
philosophies, but Americans and these 
young people expect that we will bridge 
those gaps. It is going to take a lot of 
hard work, but I am certainly ready for 
the challenge, and I hope you will join 
me. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, tomor-
row, on this floor, the Senate will re-
convene again as a court to vote on 
two Articles of Impeachment against 
President 
Trump. 
Now, 
after 
per-
forming my due diligence, along with 
many others, and considering all asser-
tions by the House and Senate man-
agers, I believe the President should be 
acquitted from both charges. I do not 
believe that removal from office is war-
ranted, more especially during an elec-
tion year. 
I, like everyone in this body, listened 
to 12 days of debate and testimony cov-
ering nearly 90 hours. I spent time 
meeting with my fellow Senators in 
order to reach a conclusion that was, 
one, fair; and two, met our constitu-
tional mandates; and three, what will 
best serve our Nation. 
I did not seek that responsibility. 
However, I have tried to carry it out to 
the best of my ability. As a Senate 
juror, I was asked to weigh whether or 
not the House Articles of Impeachment 
charging the President with obstruc-
tion of Congress or abuse of power had 
merit and, if true, whether the offenses 
rose to a level that requires the Presi-
dent to be removed from office—again, 
during an election year. 
And like many of us, I am troubled 
by multiple factors. Quite frankly, I 
am troubled with the House managers’ 
demand that we in the Senate fill in 
the gaps of their investigation and call 
more witnesses, something they failed 
to execute themselves. The job of the 
Senate is to be an honest jury, if you 
will, and not take up the role of pros-
ecutor or prosecution. Nonetheless, 
after hearing House managers’ state-
ments, it is clear this is exactly the 
role they insisted we do. 
I am troubled that countless times 
the House managers made Senators 
feel as if we were the ones on trial. I 
believe the House managers were both 
incorrect and demanding, constantly 
stating that Senators have no choice 
but to agree with their line of rea-
soning, and if we did not, then we 
would deal with the consequences—a 
veiled threat yet to be defined. 
I served in the House 16 years. For 12 
years before that, I was chief of staff 
for a House Member. I know the House. 
I truly enjoyed my service there. But 
you don’t come to the Senate and point 
fingers at Senate Members and make 
the insinuation that we are on trial if 
we do not do the right thing, as they 
have concluded. Enough of that. 
Additionally, my top concern was 
what precedence would be set for fu-
ture Presidents and their expectations 
of privacy in conversation with their 
advisers, not to mention the future, 
with regard to this situation, once 
again, with our Nation finding itself in 
a whirlpool of partisan impeachment. I 
have been most troubled that the 
House managers have not put cause be-
fore personal animus. I would think, 
back in the day, perhaps, that they had 
a barrel—like a rain barrel to capture 
the excess water off of the roof. I know 
we had that in Dodge City. I think it 
probably sat right over there. It is 
flowing over with personal animus. It 
is a rain barrel to catch that and get 
rid of it and let us get back to our busi-
ness. I deeply regret that. 
As has been stated frequently, Alex-
ander Hamilton described it best, that 
charges against the President ‘‘will sel-
dom fail to agitate the passions of the 
whole community, and to divide it into 
parties more or less friendly or inim-
ical to the accused. In many cases it 
will connect itself with the pre-exist-
ing factions, and will enlist all their 
animosities, partialities, influence, and 
interest on one side or the other; and 
in such cases there will always be the 
greatest danger [to our Nation] that 
the decision will be regulated more by 
the comparative strength of parties, 
than by the real demonstrations of in-
nocence or guilt.’’ 
I don’t know how many Senators and, 
for that matter, the distinguished pro-
fessor 
from 
Harvard, 
Professor 
Dershowitz, said that over and over 
again. Unfortunately, the warning of 
Alexander Hamilton and our Founders 
have come into fruition today. It is in-
fectious and harming our ability to 
function as the United States Senate, 
where the threads of comity are al-
ready getting pretty frayed, thread-
bare. 
In this regard, I appreciated yester-
day when the White House counsel 
showed clips of major bills important 
to the American people that we have 
done in a bipartisan fashion, despite 
our differences, despite the animus in 
the 
Senate, 
especially 
highlighting 
something called the farm bill, where 
we achieved 87 votes, with the support, 
by the way, of the distinguished Pre-
siding Officer. We don’t always agree 
on every issue on the Ag Committee, 
but we can work together to accom-
plish great things for America. We 
have done that with the farm bill. 
Along with Senator STABENOW and the 
entire Agriculture Committee, we are 
the least partisan committee in this 
distinguished body. That is what we do 
in the Senate; that is what we do on be-
half of our farmers, ranchers, our grow-
ers—everybody throughout rural and 
smalltown 
America—and 
we 
are 
charged with certainty and predict-
ability, and we had to get it done. That 
is what the White House has done on a 
number of occasions. We use the 
threads of comity to get things done. It 
needs a lot of restitching. 
So I ask, have President Trump’s ac-
tions risen to the level and vision by 
our Founding Fathers and the Con-
stitution as high crimes and mis-
demeanors warranting removal from 
office? Our Constitution requires that 
the threshold for that judgment must 
be set by each Senator sitting as a 
juror. 
All of us in this Senate have concerns 
about the direction this country is 
heading, but let me just stress that we 
have come through, time and time 
again, dark times. These are not the 
worst of times. When I first arrived 
here in the Senate as a chief of staff for 
Senator Frank Carlson, it was within 
weeks we had the horrible tragedy of 
the assassination of Martin Luther 
King. Washington was burning. Ma-
rines were on the Capitol steps with 
sandbags and live ammunition. That 
was tough. Vietnam tore the country 
apart, so did Watergate, so did the im-
peachment of Bill Clinton, so did Iran- 
Contra, just to name a few. 
Today a charge of impeachment 
against the President has placed this 
Nation in jeopardy again. The House 
managers’ assertions are exactly the 
kind of situation the Framers were try-
ing to avoid—the remarks by Alex-
ander Hamilton that I just read—as 
they devised the impeachment mecha-
nism to remove a sitting President 
whose actions endangered the Repub-
lic. 
However, as we did back then, we will 
once again come together. As I said, 
these are not the worst of times, and 
we have always pulled it together. We 
are a strong nation because we have 
strong people. We are a strong nation 
because it is in our nature to work to-
gether, even as we disagree among our-
selves. 
So I made my choice very clear, and 
my plea is, let us restore the threads of 
comity in this distinguished body. 
Work together, we must. We will 
emerge strong because we will. 
I yield the floor.

ator from North Dakota.

February 4, 2020 
pages of documents, including testi-
mony from 17 witnesses gathered as 
part of the House investigation, will be 
part of the Senate record. Over the 
course of 2 days, Senators asked 180 
questions of the House managers and 
the White House counsel. The Senate 
took its constitutional duty very seri-
ously. 
After carefully listening to the House 
managers, President’s counsel, review-
ing the documents and testimony, and 
asking questions, it is clear to me that 
the House should not have impeached 
President 
Trump, 
and 
the 
Senate 
should vote to acquit the President. 
The House process did not provide 
the President with important due proc-
ess rights. On the other hand, the Sen-
ate trial was conducted using past 
precedent of the Clinton trial as the 
framework. At the start of the Senate 
trial, the Senate agreed that the House 
evidence could be admitted into the 
record. We provided ample opportunity 
for both the House managers and White 
House counsel to make their argu-
ments and ensure that Senators had 
substantial time to ask their ques-
tions. As I said, in fact, Senators asked 
180 questions over 2 full days and re-
ceived lengthy answers from both—and 
detailed answers from both President’s 
counsel and the House managers. 
The American public has seen the 
transcript of the call between Presi-
dent Trump and President Zelensky. 
President Zelensky has said on several 
occasions that he did not feel pressured 
to do anything in return for the secu-
rity assistance. Further, the military 
aid was provided to Ukraine without 
any investigations being conducted. 
Given these facts, the House’s allega-
tions do not rise to the level of an im-
peachable offense. 
Our Founding Fathers believed that 
impeachment should not be used as a 
partisan weapon and that the President 
serves at the will of the people. With 
an election to be held in coming 
months, it should be up to the Amer-
ican people to decide who will lead the 
country. 
We need to put this impeachment be-
hind us. We need to get back to work 
advancing measures to help improve 
the lives of Americans. These legisla-
tive priorities, delayed while the House 
and Senate focused its attention on 
partisan impeachment, include impor-
tant items like addressing our Nation’s 
infrastructure, lowering prescription 
drug costs, providing middle-class tax 
relief, promoting American energy de-
velopment, supporting our military 
and veterans, upholding our trust and 
treaty obligations to our Tribal com-
munities, securing our borders, and 
continuing to fight for our farmers and 
our ranchers. These should all be areas 
where we can work together on a bipar-
tisan basis for the American people. 
With these important priorities in 
mind, I look forward to getting back to 
work for the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today as an unwavering believer in 
the system of checks and balances laid 
out by our Framers in the Constitu-
tion, with three coequal branches of 
government at times working with 
each other and at times working as a 
check against each other. It is this sys-
tem of checks and balances that safe-
guards our Republic against tyranny 
and ensures that our government by 
the people, for the people, as Abraham 
Lincoln said, does not perish from the 
Earth. 
My colleagues, what the facts of this 
trial have shown and what every Mem-
ber of this body knows is that Presi-
dent Trump did exactly what the House 
has accused him of in these two Arti-
cles of Impeachment: abusing his power 
and obstructing Congress. 
These articles strike at the very 
heart of a republic ruled not by men 
but by laws and the very notion of a 
government elected by and for the peo-
ple. 
I took my constitutional oath to do 
impartial justice seriously. I came to 
the trial with an open mind. I listened 
to both sides. I waited for the facts to 
persuade me. But in all the many hours 
I sat through this trial, not once did I 
hear the President’s team make a com-
pelling defense. Instead, I heard a 
damning case from the House managers 
detailing how President Trump sub-
verted our national security and solic-
ited foreign interference in our elec-
tion for his own personal political ben-
efit. 
The facts show that the President 
used U.S. security assistance and an of-
ficial White House meeting—two of 
Ukraine’s highest priorities—not to ad-
vance our national security but, rath-
er, his own 2020 reelection effort. In so 
doing, he violated the law known has 
the Impoundment Control Act and un-
dermined Congress’s constitutional au-
thority. 
As the ranking member of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, I want 
to make something clear. When a for-
eign adversary like Russia interferes in 
our elections, it is not for the benefit 
of the United States; it is for the ben-
efit of Russia. 
The United States provides foreign 
assistance to countries all over the 
world because it benefits America’s in-
terests. We help Ukraine in their fight 
against Russian aggression because it 
is the right thing to do for our national 
security. But when U.S. officials tell 
Ukraine that in order to get the Oval 
Office meeting their President wants 
and the security assistance it urgently 
needs, their government must first an-
nounce investigation into President 
Trump’s political opponents, that is 
not advancing our national security. 
That is corrupting it. That is forcing a 
foreign country to choose between 
their own security and getting per-
versely involved in another country’s 
elections. 
When we use U.S. foreign assistance 
as a political pawn, we weaken our 
standing and credibility in the world. 
Ukraine needed our help. Yet, when 
it sought our military assistance, in-
stead of sending it right away, the 
President of the United States said: 
Well, I would like you to do us a favor, 
though. The damage of that message 
cannot be undone. And if we don’t hold 
this President accountable, then we are 
saying it is OK to do it again. 
I fear the consequences of the Presi-
dent’s actions, and I fear the con-
sequences of our own inaction—not 
just for today or this year but for years 
to come when we have to explain to our 
allies ‘‘Trust us; we will be there’’ or 
when we tell the American people 
‘‘Trust us; we are doing this in the 
name of U.S. national security’’ or 
when we press other countries about 
strengthening the rule of law and hold-
ing free and fair elections. 
If we do not rein in this conduct, if 
we do not call it the abuse of power 
that it is, then we have failed to live up 
to the ideals of our Republic. 
I fear we have already let the Amer-
ican people and our Constitution down 
by failing to hold a fair trial. There is 
no American across this country who 
would call a trial without witnesses 
and documents a fair trial. They would 
call it a sham. And by refusing wit-
nesses and documents, the Senate is 
complicit in the President’s obstruc-
tion of Congress—the essence of the 
House’s second Article of Impeach-
ment. 
The House had a constitutional pre-
rogative to conduct an impeachment 
and oversight investigation. Yet Presi-
dent Trump engaged in unprecedented 
obstruction in order to cover up his 
misconduct by blocking witnesses with 
firsthand knowledge, by denying access 
to any documents, by publicly dispar-
aging and threatening—threatening— 
those with the courage to defy his or-
ders and testify publicly, by casting 
aside a coequal branch of government, 
as if he can really do, as he himself has 
said, whatever he wants. 
When a President tries to extort a 
foreign government for his own polit-
ical aims and in doing so ignores the 
law and the Constitution, the only 
remedy can be that which our Framers 
gave us: impeachment and removal. 
The Framers knew this day would 
come. They knew the threat of an Ex-
ecutive who welcomed or solicited for-
eign interference in our elections is 
real. What the Framers of our Con-
stitution never could have imagined is 
that there would come a day when the 
U.S. Senate would shrink in the face of 
a President who would behave like a 
King, not out of principle but out of 
willful ignorance and blind party loy-
alty. 
Our failure to conduct a fair trial 
casts doubt on the very verdict ren-
dered by this body. This is not an exon-
eration of a President; it is a corona-
tion of a King. 
I believe that the day we fail to re-
move this President will go down in 
history as a day of constitutional in-
famy. It will be remembered as a dark

February 4, 2020 
day for our democracy, for our national 
security, and for our constitutional 
order. 
I ask my colleagues, what future 
damage will we enable if this body says 
that it is OK for a President to subvert 
our national security interests and so-
licit foreign interference in our elec-
tions? What will be left of our system 
of checks and balances if there are no 
consequences for obstructing investiga-
tions, blocking witnesses, and with-
holding evidence from Congress? If we 
do not remove this President, can we 
pull ourselves back to a place where 
the rule of law matters? How much 
more shredding of the Constitution as 
a nation can we possibly endure? 
We already know President Trump 
thinks he can go to war without con-
gressional authorization. He believes 
he can misuse congressionally appro-
priated funds for whatever he wants, 
like taking billions from the Depart-
ment of Defense to spend on a border 
wall that every day proves to be a co-
lossal waste. And through it all, the 
compliant and complicit Republican 
majority has further emboldened this 
President by eliminating the 60-vote 
threshold for Supreme Court nomina-
tions, by refusing to call witnesses in 
this trial, by further stripping the Sen-
ate of its David versus Goliath role in 
which we serve as a check on vast exec-
utive power. 
If the Senate is prepared to say that 
this President and all future Presidents 
of either party can misuse congression-
ally appropriated funding to extract 
political favors from a foreign power, 
can deny all witnesses, can withhold 
all relevant documents, can openly 
threaten Ambassadors, career public 
servants, and Members of Congress—if 
a President can commit all of these 
gross abuses of power as if he were 
above the law, then the very essence of 
our democracy is broken, and what we 
must ask ourselves is, What is left? 
What is left of our Constitution if we 
are not prepared to defend it? What is 
left other than lawlessness? 
We need Republicans of conscience 
and courage to say more than just 
‘‘Yes, the President did it, and it was 
wrong.’’ We need our Republican col-
leagues to be intellectually honest. We 
need them to speak the truth and say 
it is impeachable so we can mount a bi-
partisan defense of the Constitution 
and all that America stands for. 
I, for one, am prepared to defend our 
Constitution. I will vote guilty on the 
Articles of Impeachment, not because 
of loyalty to any party, not because of 
how it will or won’t play in any upcom-
ing election. I will vote for impeach-
ment and removal not because I hate 
this President, because I don’t, but be-
cause I love our country more. 
I took an oath to uphold the Con-
stitution, and with this vote, I intend 
to do so. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI). The Senator from Massachu-
setts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
thank you. 
Over the course of this trial, we have 
heard nothing less than a blistering, 
scalding 
indictment 
of 
President 
Trump’s conduct. The House managers 
put 
forward 
a 
compelling—indeed, 
overwhelming—case 
that 
Donald 
Trump engaged in impeachable con-
duct. He withheld both congressionally 
approved aid to our ally Ukraine and 
an Oval Office meeting desperately 
sought by Ukraine’s new President— 
two official acts—in exchange for per-
sonal favors that would benefit him po-
litically. 
Trump sought an announcement by 
Ukraine of baseless investigations into 
bogus corruption allegations against 
Joe Biden, whom Donald Trump most 
feared as an opponent in the 2020 Presi-
dential 
election. 
He 
also 
wanted 
Ukraine to announce an investigation 
into the discredited and debunked con-
spiracy theory that Ukraine, not Rus-
sia, interfered in the 2016 Presidential 
election. 
At every turn, Donald Trump refused 
to cooperate with and actively ob-
structed Congress’s investigation into 
his wrongdoing. His obstruction was, in 
the words of the Articles of Impeach-
ment, ‘‘unprecedented, categorical, and 
indiscriminate.’’ 
I listened carefully to the President’s 
lawyers as they presented their defense 
case. Like my colleagues, I took pages 
of notes. My colleagues were very pa-
tiently trying to hear each argument 
that was being made by the defense 
counsel. I took notes. They took notes. 
As I sat at this desk, with the seri-
ousness and sanctity of the proceedings 
thick in the air, I waited for the Presi-
dent’s lawyers to rebut the avalanche 
of evidence against their client, and I 
waited and I waited. At the end of the 
case, I was still waiting. And that is 
because the President’s lawyers did 
nothing to rebut any of the facts in 
this case—nothing. They knew what we 
all knew after we heard the House 
managers’ case. Donald Trump did it. 
He did it. He did exactly what he was 
alleged to have done. He abused his 
power. 
He 
committed 
impeachable 
crimes. He is guilty. There is no ques-
tion about it—no question at all. 
There is no doubt that President 
Trump used his personal attorney, 
Rudy Giuliani, to solicit Ukraine’s in-
terference in the 2020 election. There is 
no doubt that President Trump froze 
the $391 million of taxpayer dollars in 
Ukraine military aid and security as-
sistance that Congress authorized and 
appropriated. There is no doubt that 
President Trump conditioned the re-
lease of that aid on the Ukrainian Gov-
ernment’s announcement of politically 
motivated investigations. 
There is no doubt that in a July 25, 
2019, telephone call, President Trump 
directly solicited investigations from 
President Zelensky, as the partial 
transcript memorialized and as Acting 
White House Chief of Staff Mick 
Mulvaney admitted. There is no doubt 
that President Trump released the aid 
to Ukraine only after a patriot within 
the intelligence community blew the 
whistle on him and after several House 
committees announced a joint inves-
tigation into the President’s coercive 
scheme. There is no doubt that the 
President directed and orchestrated a 
coverup and the wholesale obstruction 
of Congress’s investigation into his 
wrongdoing. 
Donald Trump has shown no remorse, 
no contrition, no recognition whatso-
ever that his conduct was wrong. In-
stead, he has doubled down on his 
abuses, gaslighting us repeatedly with 
the assertion that his call with Presi-
dent Zelensky was ‘‘perfect’’ and by 
publicly urging Ukraine and China to 
investigate his political rivals. 
The question now before the U.S. 
Senate is not, What are the facts? We 
know the facts. No reasonable person 
can dispute them. No, the question for 
the Senate is, What in the pursuit of 
impartial justice, as our oaths require, 
must we do with these facts? 
To me, the answer is clear. We must 
vote to convict Donald Trump and re-
move him from office. All the evidence 
shows that he has committed impeach-
able offenses and is a clear and present 
danger to our democracy and our na-
tional security. 
But if we fail to remove Donald 
Trump from office, we are left with an 
equally consequential question: What 
would prevent an acquitted Donald 
Trump from abusing his power again? 
We all know that the answer is noth-
ing—nothing will. That is the answer I 
received from the House managers 
when I asked this question during the 
trial. In fact, we know that an acquit-
tal will only embolden him. 
We know that Donald Trump’s phone 
call with Ukrainian President Zelensky 
took place the day after Special Coun-
sel Mueller testified in the House of 
Representatives. The special counsel 
found and explained in his House testi-
mony that there was evidence of a 
criminal conspiracy between members 
of the Trump campaign and Russia, but 
the evidence was not sufficient to bring 
charges. Robert Mueller never said 
there was no evidence of such a con-
spiracy. There was evidence. It was 
merely insufficient for a prosecution. 
We know that Donald Trump took 
this as a green light to invite further 
foreign interference in our elections, 
which he did the very next day. 
Donald Trump has no shame. He can-
not help himself. If we acquit President 
Trump, he will believe himself to be ac-
countable to no one, and when—not if, 
but when—he is again faced with a 
choice between the public interest and 
his personal interest, he will choose his 
personal interest, and it will, in part, 
be a reckoning of our own making. A 
majority in this Chamber will have 
made President Trump a dictator. 
Then, what will we tell the American 
people? How will we convince them 
that we still have a democracy that 
they should have faith in, a system of

checks and balances that ensures ac-
countability, that no one is above the 
law? 
This weekend I asked some of my 
constituents what they would say on 
the floor of the Senate if they could 
make remarks in this trial. 
Jennifer Baker Jones of Woburn said 
it perfectly: 
Wednesday’s vote won’t be a vindication of 
Trump, but an end to the right of Congress 
to push back on the President. They are giv-
ing up their balance of power. 
It will be difficult because we have 
already ceded much of our authority 
and, indeed, betrayed the public’s faith 
in us by the conduct of this trial. 
Hope Anderson in Lowell, MA, told 
me: 
We need to not only hold our leaders and 
ourselves accountable, but seek to maintain 
and repair the public’s trust. 
We are not here simply to protect 
one election in 2020. We are here to pro-
tect all elections. 
At the beginning of this trial, we 
each took an oath to do impartial jus-
tice, but then we held the trial without 
witnesses and without documents. We 
moved to vote on the Articles of Im-
peachment without hearing from John 
Bolton, a witness whose firsthand 
knowledge directly cuts the heart out 
of the President’s case; without hear-
ing from Mick Mulvaney, whose finger-
prints are all over this scheme; without 
the emails, texts, and other documents 
we know exist, writings that memori-
alize communications about the ac-
tions at issue here. 
A trial is a search for the truth, the 
full truth, the whole truth. That search 
for the truth requires hearing from rel-
evant witnesses and seeing relevant 
documents so that the fact finders un-
derstand the entire story. By not pur-
suing this evidence, the Senate—the 
fact finders—have told the American 
people that the truth does not matter. 
They deserve better from us. Our 
Constitution demands it, our democ-
racy demands it, and I believe the vast 
majority of my Republican colleagues 
do understand what Donald Trump did 
here and know that it is very, very 
wrong. They know the House managers 
proved their case. Some are even say-
ing that out loud. 
I believe the vast majority of my Re-
publican colleagues recognizes that 
abuse of power is an impeachable of-
fense and that the President is not 
above the law. But, unfortunately, I 
also believe that they are simply too 
afraid of Donald Trump to do what 
they know is right. 
Every Senator needs to consider this 
question. If what Donald Trump did 
here is not impeachable—extorting for-
eign interference in our free and fair 
elections and then covering it up— 
then, what is impeachable? 
We have to have accountability. That 
is our duty. We cannot give future 
Presidents carte blanche to tear down 
our Constitution and interfere with 
free and fair elections, period. That has 
to be our standard. 
I will end my remarks with the an-
swer I got from my constituent Mat-
thew Murray in Gloucester to what he 
would say if he were here. He said: 
I urge you, my fellow Senators, to delib-
erate in accordance to your conscience and 
the oath you took when you were elected, 
and vote to remove this dangerous President 
from office. 
This is the choice we must make: 
duty to this President or duty to de-
mocracy. For this reason, I will be vot-
ing to remove President Trump from 
office. This is an historic moment. I do 
not think that this body has a choice. 
Thank you, Madam President. I yield 
back. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, 233 
years ago, our Founding Fathers gath-
ered in Philadelphia, just a few miles 
north of us in Delaware. Eleven years 
earlier, we had declared our independ-
ence from the British Crown, the most 
powerful empire in the world. Despite 
long odds, David overcame Goliath, and 
we won our independence, but would 
the government of this new Nation en-
dure? 
When 
the 
Founders 
gathered 
in 
Philadelphia that summer of 1787, they 
began debating a new form of govern-
ment. At times, the differences be-
tween our Founders—Northern States, 
Southern States, small States, and 
large 
States—seemed 
irreconcilable. 
However, a great compromise was 
eventually reached, and an intricate 
system of checks and balances was 
written into a governing document, the 
Constitution of the United States. 
Nebraska Senator William Jennings 
Bryan once remarked: ‘‘Destiny is not 
a matter of chance. It is a matter of 
choice.’’ Our Constitution has endured 
longer than any other on Earth, in 
large part because we did not leave our 
destiny to chance. Today, our Con-
stitution remains the longest lasting 
Constitution in the world. 
Our Founders, despite their many 
disagreements, made the crucial choice 
that this new Constitution would not 
lead to the creation of an all-powerful 
King. They came from places where 
they had done that, been there, and 
they didn’t want to go through that 
again. Instead, the Constitution cre-
ated three separate, coequal branches 
of government—an executive branch, a 
legislative 
branch, 
and 
a 
judicial 
branch. This ingenious system would 
ensure that a future President with the 
impulses of a King would be restrained 
by the other two branches. 
The Constitution also provided an-
other backstop against abuses from a 
future President who committed trea-
son, bribery, or other high crimes and 
misdemeanors. 
That 
constitutional 
backstop is called impeachment. 
As we consider the impeachment of 
Donald J. Trump, I ask my colleagues 
to remember that while we are here 
today because of the conduct of one 
man, the Constitution that guides us 
through these choppy waters some 233 
years later is the triumph and wisdom 
of many men. We are here because of 
patriots like Washington, Adams, Jef-
ferson, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, 
and many others who lived under the 
harsh rule of a King and fought for the 
freedom to govern themselves. 
Our Constitution gives the House of 
Representatives the sole power of im-
peachment, while the Senate has the 
sole power to conduct a trial in the 
event the House impeaches a sitting 
President. 
We are now at the end of the im-
peachment trial of Donald J. Trump. It 
is not the trial that many of us had 
hoped for. We had hoped for a fair trial. 
The American people deserve a fair 
trial. A fair trial has witnesses. A fair 
trial has evidence. 
I don’t believe that history will be 
kind to those who have and continue to 
prevent the truth from coming to light 
during this trial. The American people 
deserve to know the truth, as does this 
jury, the Members of the United States 
Senate. 
President Lincoln once said: 
I am a firm believer in the people. If given 
the truth, they can be depended upon to 
meet any national crisis. 
Thomas Jefferson said something 
very similar to that. He said that if the 
people know the truth, they won’t 
make a mistake. 
The same is true of the Senate. If 
given the truth, we, too, can be de-
pended upon to meet this crisis and do 
the right thing. I believe the truth will 
not only set us free but keep us free. 
We now have an obligation to con-
sider the evidence presented by House 
managers and the President’s defense 
team related to two Articles of Im-
peachment—one, abuse of power; two, 
obstruction of Congress. 
The House managers have presented 
a case that is a result of a 3-month- 
long investigation during which the 
House Intelligence Committee issued 
scores of subpoenas for documents and 
testimony. Donald Trump obstructed 
this process from the start. No Presi-
dent—not 
even 
President 
Richard 
Nixon 
during 
Watergate—has 
ever 
issued an order to direct a witness to 
refuse to cooperate in an impeachment 
inquiry. As a result of this unprece-
dented obstruction, the Trump admin-
istration did not provide a single docu-
ment to the House of Representatives— 
not one. 
Fortunately, those 17 brave public 
servants, many of whom risked their 
careers, came forward to testify under 
oath, and here is what we learned from 
them. 
Donald Trump used the powers of his 
office to pressure the Government of 
Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 elec-
tion on his behalf and to smear his

most feared political opponent, our 
former colleague, former Vice Presi-
dent Joe Biden. Donald Trump did this 
by illegally withholding funds appro-
priated by Congress to help an ally, 
Ukraine, in the midst of a hot war 
against Russia. Donald Trump did this 
by withholding a coveted White House 
meeting from the newly elected Presi-
dent of Ukraine, President Zelensky. 
This President illegally withheld the 
funds and a meeting until President 
Zelensky merely announced sham in-
vestigations involving Vice President 
Joe Biden and a debunked conspiracy 
theory that Ukraine, not Russia, inter-
fered in the 2016 election. And when he 
got caught in the midst of this corrupt 
scheme, President Trump even called 
for other foreign nations to interfere 
on his behalf in the upcoming 2020 elec-
tion. 
While I believe the evidence against 
Donald Trump is overwhelming, like 
any criminal defendant, he is entitled 
to a robust defense. 
Many of us listened carefully to the 
President’s defense team over the 
course of his 2-week trial. Not once did 
the President’s defense team rebut the 
facts of the case. Not once did they de-
fend their client’s character or call an 
eyewitness who could contradict the 
assertions made by witnesses who tes-
tified under oath. Not once did we hear 
the President’s defense team say: Of 
course, the President wouldn’t use the 
weight of the Federal Government to 
smear his political rival. 
What did we hear? Instead, we heard 
distractions, conspiracy theories, un-
founded smears about Vice President 
Biden—our former colleague—and his 
family. Instead, we heard a farfetched 
legal theory that Presidents cannot be 
impeached for soliciting foreign inter-
ference in our elections if they believe 
their own reelection is in the national 
interest. 
I believe the House managers proved 
their case, and there now appears to be 
some bipartisan agreement that the 
President abused his power. Still, does 
this merit conviction and removal 
from office? Think about that. 
Our Constitution, agreed to in 1787, 
sought to establish ‘‘a more perfect 
Union’’—not a perfect union, ‘‘a more 
perfect Union.’’ The hard work toward 
a more perfect union did not end when 
Delaware became the first State to rat-
ify the Constitution on December 7, 
1787. In truth, it had only just begun. 
We went on as a nation to enact the 
Bill of Rights, abolish slavery, give 
women the right to vote, and much, 
much more. 
Throughout our history, each genera-
tion of Americans has sought to im-
prove our government and our country 
because, after all, we are not perfect. 
In the words of Senator Bryan, we do 
not leave our destiny to chance. We 
make it a matter of choice. And we 
choose to make this a more perfect 
union, a reflection that the hard work 
begun in Philadelphia in 1787 is never— 
never—truly complete. 
Our Constitution has weathered a 
Civil War, World War I, World War II, 
Vietnam, Watergate, a Great Depres-
sion, a great recession, death of Presi-
dents, assassination of Presidents, and, 
yes, impeachment of Presidents. Our 
Constitution will weather this storm 
too. 
A vote to acquit this President does 
not exonerate this President. A vote to 
acquit effectively legalizes the corrup-
tion of our elections—the very founda-
tion under our democratic process. A 
vote to acquit says to the President, 
and to all who follow, that you may use 
the powers of the office to solicit for-
eign interference in our elections—the 
very thing that the Founding Fathers 
feared. A vote to acquit is the realiza-
tion of our Founders’ worst fears: leav-
ing a President with the impulses of a 
King, unchecked by the other coequal 
branches of government and undeterred 
by the prospect of impeachment. 
Donald Trump violated his oath. He 
broke the law. He attempted to cheat 
in the 2020 election, and when he got 
caught, he left little doubt that he will 
cheat again. That is not the conduct 
we expect of an American President. 
That is the conduct of someone who be-
lieves that he or she is above the law. 
Donald Trump is our President. He is 
not our King. 
So colleagues, if our destiny is to re-
main the most enduring democracy in 
the history of the world, we must not 
leave this to be a matter of chance. We 
must choose to preserve and protect 
our Constitution, and, to do so, we 
must convict Donald Trump on both 
Articles of Impeachment and remove 
him from office. 
As he left the Constitutional Conven-
tion in 1787, Benjamin Franklin was 
asked this question we heard asked 
several times in the last 2 weeks on 
this floor. He was asked: ‘‘What do we 
have, [what do we have here] a mon-
archy or a republic?’’ Franklin an-
swered famously: ‘‘A republic, if you 
can keep it.’’ 
Today I want to pose the same ques-
tion to all of us, to our colleagues, in 
this Chamber: What do we have here, a 
monarchy or a Republic? I guess we 
can all answer for ourselves, but I want 
to leave you with my answer today. 
Here it is. We have a Republic, and I in-
tend to keep it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise 
also to discuss the pending matter, the 
serious matter of impeachment. 
President Trump schemed to get 
Ukraine to help him win the 2020 elec-
tion by strong-arming its new Presi-
dent to announce a bogus investigation 
against a political opponent. To carry 
out his scheme, he smeared, fired, and 
threatened a dedicated career ambas-
sador, thwarted Congress by secretly 
withholding appropriated military aid 
over the advice of his national security 
team, violated two laws in order to 
hide his actions, outsourced critical 
foreign policy to a rogue private attor-
ney, hurt an American ally, gratified 
an adversary, and overturned long-
standing precedent regarding the rela-
tionship between the executive and leg-
islative branches. The scheme was so 
repellant that numerous members of 
his own administration fought against 
it, and then, when they could not stop 
it themselves, courageously brought it 
to light. 
The House managers have proven 
both Articles of Impeachment. But I 
have struggled during the Senate proc-
ess—which cannot be called a trial due 
to the shocking refusal to allow key 
witnesses and documents—with a basic 
question: Is it an abuse of trust for a 
President to behave exactly as ex-
pected? 
President Trump’s behavior has been 
appalling, but it has not been a sur-
prise. The American people knew that 
Donald Trump would seek foreign help 
to win an election. He publicly did so 
in 2016 by appealing to Russia for help 
at the same time as our Chairman of 
the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Russia 
was America’s chief adversary. That he 
is doing so again is no surprise. 
The American public knew that Don-
ald Trump would target political oppo-
nents with false attacks. He publicly 
did so in 2016 by leading crowds in 
chants of ‘‘Lock her up.’’ That he will 
again 
target 
perceived 
opponents, 
Democrats 
or 
Republicans, 
Ambas-
sadors or whistleblowers, Representa-
tives or Senators, war heros or teenage 
environmental activists, is no surprise. 
The American public knew that Don-
ald Trump would obstruct the release 
of information. He publicly did so in 
2016, when he violated longstanding 
practice by refusing to release his tax 
returns. That he will continue to ob-
struct Congress, the media, and the 
American public is no surprise. 
His bigotry is no surprise. His lying 
is no surprise. His lack of ethics is no 
surprise. His xenophobia is no surprise. 
His misogyny is no surprise. His obses-
sive selfishness is no surprise. His hate-
ful, divisive, and ignorant rhetoric is 
no surprise. 
But Presidential impeachment was 
not designed to remove an amoral lead-
er that the Nation had knowingly and 
willingly elected. It was designed to 
rescue the Nation from a leader who 
abuses the public trust. Can one abuse 
the public trust by behaving exactly as 
expected? 
The Senate impeachment process an-
swered my question. In 1974, Senators 
of both parties were willing to con-
demn 
extreme 
Presidential 
mis-
conduct. In 1999, Senators of both par-
ties were able to distinguish between 
unacceptable personal behavior and 
‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ But 
in 2020, the Senate majority engineered 
an effort to conceal the truth rather 
than find the truth. Some described 
their motives as ‘‘let the people de-
cide,’’ even as they voted to hide crit-
ical evidence from the American peo-
ple.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S832 
February 4, 2020 
While the President’s actions have 
not been surprising, the Senate’s capit-
ulation has surprised me. And last Fri-
day, 
as 
the 
majority 
repeatedly 
blocked the effort to consider witnesses 
and documents, I had a sad epiphany. 
Unchallenged evil spreads like a virus. 
We have allowed a toxic President to 
infect the Senate and warp its behav-
ior, and now the Senate’s refusal to 
allow a fair trial threatens to spread a 
broader anxiety about whether ‘‘impar-
tial justice’’ is a hollow fiction. An ac-
quittal will lead to worse conduct. 
I will not be part of this continual 
degradation of public trust; thus, I will 
vote to convict. 
An acquittal will, however, under-
score a higher principle. The removal 
of a man will not remove the moral 
void he exemplifies. Instead, every day, 
people of good will must engage as 
never before and show to ourselves and 
to the world that Americans still have 
the capacity to choose right over 
wrong, service over self, fact over fic-
tion, and decency over malice. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, tomor-
row afternoon, the Senate will vote to 
acquit President Trump in these im-
peachment proceedings. That is the 
right thing to do. That is the decision 
that comports with both the facts and 
the law. 
These 
impeachment 
proceedings 
began in the House of Representatives 
in a thoroughly partisan affair, driven 
by House Democrats, without allowing 
the President to participate in cross- 
examining witnesses and calling de-
fense witnesses. 
When the matter came to the Senate, 
the Senate was obligated to do much 
better. We had an obligation under the 
Constitution to conduct a fair trial, 
and that is what the Senate has done. 
Over the course of the last 2 weeks, we 
have heard hour upon hour upon hour 
of argument. The House proceeding 
heard testimony from 18 different wit-
nesses. The Senate saw 193 video clips 
of witness testimony presented here on 
the Senate floor. The Senate posed 180 
separate questions from Senators to 
the House managers or the White 
House defense team. Within the record 
were over 28,000 pages of documents, in-
cluding the single most important evi-
dence in this case, which is the actual 
transcript of the conversation at issue 
between President Trump and the 
President of Ukraine. The Trump ad-
ministration, to the astonishment of 
everyone, declassified that transcript 
and released it to the world so that we 
can read precisely what was said in 
that conversation. 
The reason acquittal is the right de-
cision is that the House managers 
failed to prove their case. They failed 
to demonstrate that they satisfied the 
constitutional standard of high crimes 
and misdemeanors. The text of the 
Constitution provides that a President 
may be impeached for ‘‘Treason, Brib-
ery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors.’’ The House managers fell 
woefully short of that standard. In-
deed, in the Articles of Impeachment 
they sent over here, they don’t allege 
any crime whatsoever. They don’t even 
allege a single Federal law that the 
President violated. 
An awful lot of Americans looking at 
these proceedings have heard a lot of 
noise, have heard a lot of screaming, 
but are left wondering, What was this 
all about? 
If you examine the substance, there 
are two things that the House man-
agers allege the President did wrong. 
One, they allege that the President 
wrongfully delayed aid to Ukraine, 
and, two, they allege that the Presi-
dent wrongfully asked for an investiga-
tion into a political rival. Both of 
those are legitimate ends. 
Let me address them one at a time 
because there is a deep irony in the ar-
gument of the House managers. Both of 
those objectives are consistent with 
law, are permissible and legal, and both 
of those objectives have been done, by 
any measure, substantially worse by 
the preceding administration, by the 
Obama administration. 
Let’s take delaying aid to Ukraine. I 
am a big believer in America standing 
with Ukraine. Indeed, I traveled to 
Ukraine. I went to the Maidan Square 
and stood with protesters who had been 
shot down by their government as the 
protesters stood for freedom. 
I believe military aid to Ukraine is a 
good thing, and it is true that the 
Trump administration temporarily de-
layed aid to Ukraine. That is their 
right to do so. Presidents have delayed 
foreign aid before. The Trump adminis-
tration has done so with regard to a 
number of countries. The Obama ad-
ministration did so before that. Pre-
vious administrations have done so. 
But we heard hour upon hour of the 
House managers trying to establish the 
proposition that aid to Ukraine was de-
layed when President Trump admits 
aid to Ukraine was delayed. There is no 
dispute about it. 
We 
heard 
testimony 
about 
how 
Ukrainians died because aid was de-
layed. Here is the irony: If you support 
aid to Ukraine, as I do, military aid to 
Ukraine as they stand up to Russia, 
there is no dispute whatsoever that, for 
the entirety of his Presidency, Presi-
dent Obama refused to give lethal mili-
tary aid, defensive aid, to Ukraine, de-
spite the fact that I and other Members 
of this body called on President Obama 
to give aid to Ukraine. I remember 
when we all went to the floor of the 
House of Representatives to hear a 
speech to a joint session of Congress 
from President Poroshenko, then the 
President of Ukraine, where the Presi-
dent of Ukraine called out the Obama 
administration because they were send-
ing blankets and MREs—meals. And 
President Poroshenko rightly said that 
you can’t fight a Russian tank with a 
blanket. 
So if the House managers are right 
that there is something improper about 
delaying military aid, the Obama ad-
ministration did so for the entirety of 
the administration. What did President 
Trump do? He did something Obama 
never did: He provided lethal defensive 
military aid—Javelin missiles that can 
take out Russian tanks. 
The first ground they allege, of de-
laying aid, is legal and permissible, and 
by any measure, the Trump adminis-
tration’s record on it is much, much 
better than the Obama administra-
tion’s. 
How about the second ground: direct-
ing an investigation into your political 
rival. The most important legal ques-
tion in this proceeding, the question 
that resolves this proceeding, is this: 
Does the President have the constitu-
tional authority to investigate credible 
allegations of corruption? 
The House managers built their case 
on the proposition that seeking an in-
vestigation into Burisma, the corrupt 
Ukrainian natural gas company, and 
Joe Biden and Hunter Biden—seeking 
any investigation into whether there 
was corruption was, in the words of the 
House managers, ‘‘baseless,’’ ‘‘a sham,’’ 
and utterly ‘‘without merit.’’ In their 
opening arguments, the House man-
agers spent over 2 hours trying to 
make that case, and Madam President, 
I will say, on the face of it, that propo-
sition is objectively absurd. 
The White House legal defense team 
laid out, in considerable detail, that 
there was very substantial evidence of 
corruption. Burisma is a company that 
was built on corruption. The oligarch 
who started Burisma, Mr. Zlochevsky, 
was the sitting energy minister in 
Ukraine, and he amassed his billions 
by, as the sitting energy minister, giv-
ing gas licenses to his own company 
that he was head of. That is where 
Burisma made their money. It was a 
company built on corruption from day 
one. 
Now, I think it is worth pausing and 
examining the timeline of what oc-
curred because, remember, the House 
managers’ case is that it is baseless 
and a sham to even investigate corrup-
tion. 
In early 2014, Vice President Joe 
Biden was named the point person for 
the Obama administration on Ukraine. 
In April—on April 13 of 2014—Devon Ar-
cher, business partner of Hunter Biden, 
the son of Joe Biden, joined the board 
of Burisma and began being paid a mil-
lion dollars a year. On April 28, Brit-
ain’s securities fraud bureau freezes $23 
million 
in 
accounts 
controlled 
by 
Zlochevsky, the oligarch who owned 
Burisma. Then, just 2 weeks later, on 
May 12, Hunter Biden, the son of Joe 
Biden, is named to the board and paid

a million dollars a year, despite having 
no background in oil and gas and no 
discernible background in Ukraine. 
Hunter Biden gets paid a million dol-
lars a year, and Joe Biden actively, ag-
gressively, vigorously leads the Obama 
administration’s policies on Ukraine. 
Now, the House managers were asked 
in questioning: What exactly did Hun-
ter Biden do for his million dollars a 
year? They refused to answer that. 
That is a perfectly reasonable question 
to ask if you are investigating corrup-
tion. Joe Biden is seen on video not 
just admitting but bragging that he 
told the President of Ukraine he would 
personally block a billion dollars in 
foreign aid loan guarantees unless 
Ukraine fired the prosecutor who was 
investigating Burisma, the company 
paying his son a million dollars a year. 
As Joe Biden bragged on that video, 
‘‘Well, son of a bitch,’’ they fired him. 
Now, that, on its face, raises signifi-
cant issues of potential corruption. We 
don’t know for sure if there was, in 
fact, corruption, but when President 
Trump asked that it be investigated to 
get to the bottom of what happened, 
the President has the authority to in-
vestigate corruption, and there was 
more than sufficient basis to do so. 
Of course, the House managers are 
right that it is somehow illegitimate, 
it is somehow inappropriate—it is, in 
fact, impeachable—to seek the inves-
tigation of your political rival. 
We know for a fact that the Obama 
administration not only sought the in-
vestigation but aggressively led an in-
vestigation marred by abuse of power, 
going after then-Candidate Trump, in-
cluding wiretaps, including fraudu-
lently obtained court documents and 
court warrants from the FISA Court. 
Impeachment is an extraordinary 
remedy. It is not designed for when you 
disagree. It is not designed for when 
you have political differences or policy 
differences. It is designed for when a 
President crosses the constitutional 
threshold. 
On February 6, 1974, the Democratic 
Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter 
Rodino, Democrat from New Jersey 
who led the impeachment inquiry into 
Richard Nixon, told his colleagues: 
Whatever the result, whatever we learn or 
conclude, let us now proceed, with such care 
and decency and thoroughness and honor 
that the vast majority of the American peo-
ple, and their children after them, will say: 
This was the right course. There was no 
other way. 
That was the standard that led to an 
overwhelming bipartisan vote to open 
the impeachment proceeding against 
Richard Nixon. That standard was not 
remotely followed by the House man-
agers. This was a partisan impeach-
ment, and we are right now in an elec-
tion year. The voters are voting, and it 
is up to the voters to decide which poli-
cies they want to continue. The House 
managers have abused the constitu-
tional process by trying to use im-
peachment to settle a partisan score. 
That is divisive to the country, and I 
am proud that this body will vote—and 
I hope in a bipartisan way—to reject 
these Articles of Impeachment, to ac-
quit the President, and to find Presi-
dent Trump not guilty of the articles 
the House has sent over. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
CAPITO). The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
will vote against each of the House 
Democrats’ Articles of Impeachment, 
and I would like to explain why. 
The House Democrats’ impeachment 
proceedings and their Articles of Im-
peachment were and are fatally flawed. 
My friends, the House Democrats, say 
that the President is out of control. 
What they really mean is that the 
President is out of their control. And 
that is not grounds for impeachment. 
First, the process. The House Demo-
crats’ impeachment proceedings were 
rigged. Speaker PELOSI and the House 
Democratic leadership decided before 
they even began to give President 
Trump a fair and impartial firing 
squad. Speaker PELOSI and the House 
Democrats’ judicial philosophy from 
the very beginning was guilty. That is 
why much of the proceedings were held 
in secret. 
Democracy, they say, dies in dark-
ness, and I believe it. That is why the 
House Democrats hid the identity of 
the original accuser, the so-called 
whistleblower, thus prohibiting the 
American people from being able to 
judge the accuser’s motives. That is 
also why the House Democrats pre-
vented the President and his counsel 
from cross-examining the House Demo-
crats’ witnesses, from offering his own 
witnesses, from offering rebuttal evi-
dence, and even from being able to 
challenge the House Democrats’ evi-
dence. The House Democrats wouldn’t 
even allow the President or his counsel 
to attend critical parts of the impeach-
ment proceedings. 
The U.S. Senate cannot and should 
not consider an impeachment based on 
such a deficient record. It is true that 
in America no one is above the law, but 
no one is beneath it either. Fairness 
matters in our country. 
The House Democrats’ impeachment 
is also flawed because it is a partisan 
impeachment. Its genesis is partisan 
rage. Not a single, solitary House Re-
publican voted for the Articles of Im-
peachment—not one. 
The House Democrats made a con-
scious decision to turn impeachment 
into a routine Washington, DC, polit-
ical weapon, to normalize it. Our coun-
try’s Founders were concerned about 
impeachments based on partisan rage 
and our country’s Founders were ada-
mantly opposed. That is why in the 
Constitution they required a two- 
thirds vote of the Senate to impeach. 
Now, a word about the substance of 
the House Democrats’ Articles of Im-
peachment. The House Democrats ac-
cused the President of obstruction of 
justice. Why? Because he chose to as-
sert executive privilege and testi-
monial immunity when the House 
Democrats sought testimony and docu-
ments from some of the President’s 
closest aides. Anyone who knows a law-
book from a J. Crew catalog does not 
take this charge seriously. Executive 
privilege and testimonial immunity 
are well-established, constitutionally 
based 
Presidential 
and 
executive 
branch privileges that every President 
at one time or another has asserted. 
The proper course by the House Demo-
crats in the face of the assertion of 
these privileges was to seek judicial re-
view—go see a judge to seek judicial 
review from our third branch of gov-
ernment, which then would have bal-
anced the policies underlining the 
privileges against the public interest of 
overriding the privileges. But House 
Democrats chose not to do that. They 
cannot now complain. 
The House Democrats also accused 
President Trump of abuse of power. If 
you listen carefully to their allega-
tions, you will see that they don’t real-
ly argue that the President of the 
United States did not and does not 
have the inherent authority to pause 
U.S. foreign aid to Ukraine until 
Ukraine agreed to investigate corrup-
tion. That is clearly within the author-
ity of the President of the United 
States. 
Instead, the House Democrats, claim-
ing to be able to read the President’s 
mind, say that the President did it 
with a corrupt motive because the in-
vestigation of corruption was against 
former Vice President Joe Biden, a po-
litical rival. But the President didn’t 
get 
Joe 
Biden’s 
name 
out 
of 
a 
phonebook. Why did the President ask 
for an investigation involving former 
Vice President Biden? Four words: 
Hunter Biden and Burisma. 
Now, these are the facts. President 
Obama put Vice President Biden in 
charge of the foreign affairs of our 
country 
for 
two 
other 
countries, 
Ukraine and China. And in both in-
stances, the former Vice President’s 
son, Hunter Biden, promptly walked 
away with millions of dollars in con-
tracts from politically connected com-
panies in those two countries, includ-
ing Burisma Holdings. The message 
that this behavior sent to the world 
was that America’s foreign policy can 
be bought like a sack of potatoes. No 
fairminded person can argue that an 
investigation of this possible corrup-
tion was not in the national interest. 
The House Democrats’ impeachment 
proceedings and their Articles of Im-
peachment are an example of swamped- 
up Washington, DC, both procedurally 
and substantively. On the basis of par-
tisan 
rage—partisan 
rage 
coursing 
through their veins—the House Demo-
crats seek to annul the 134 million 
Americans who voted in the 2016 Presi-
dential election, which resulted in the 
Trump Presidency, and to do so when a 
new Presidential election is just 10 
months away. No one in the Milky Way 
who is fairminded can believe this is 
good for America. A nation as great as 
ours deserves better.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S834 
February 4, 2020 
So to my Democratic friends, here is 
what I say. The 2016 Presidential elec-
tion is over. Let it go. Put aside your 
partisan rage. Stop regretting yester-
day, and instead, let’s try working to-
gether and creating tomorrow, because, 
after all, the future is just a bunch of 
things we do right now strung to-
gether. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mr. PERDUE. Madam President, in 
Federalist Papers No. 65, which we 
have heard referred to quite a bit in 
the last 2 weeks, Alexander Hamilton 
warned that the impeachment process 
should never be used as a partisan po-
litical weapon. He said that impeach-
ment can ‘‘connect itself with the pre- 
existing factions and will enlist all 
their animosities, partialities, influ-
ence, and interest on one side or on the 
other . . . in such cases there will al-
ways be the greatest danger that the 
decision will be regulated more by the 
comparative strength of the parties, 
than by the real demonstrations of in-
nocence or guilt.’’ 
Today, unfortunately, over two cen-
turies later, Hamilton’s fears have be-
come reality. This current impeach-
ment process has never been about the 
truth, justice, or the rule of law. For 
my colleagues across the aisle, this is 
only about overturning the 2016 elec-
tion, impacting the 2020 election, and 
gaining the Senate majority. 
From the start, this House process 
has been totally illegitimate. The Arti-
cles of Impeachment that the House of 
Representatives presented to us last 
month were nothing more than the 
fruit of a poisonous tree. 
In America, we believe in the rule of 
law. In America, we believe in due 
process. In America, we believe anyone 
has the right to a fair trial. In Amer-
ica, we believe anyone is innocent until 
proven guilty. However, House Demo-
crats 
violated 
each 
of 
these 
foundational precepts in using the im-
peachment process as a partisan polit-
ical weapon. 
Throughout the course of the House 
impeachment investigation, Democrats 
repeatedly denied President Trump due 
process and the fundamental rights of 
the accused in America. Simply put, 
what they did was not fair. They de-
nied him the right to have counsel, the 
right to have witnesses, the right to 
cross-examine 
their 
witnesses, 
the 
right to see the evidence, and, lastly, 
the right to face his accuser. 
Contrast that with the last two 
Presidents to face impeachment. The 
grand jury investigation of Clinton and 
the Watergate investigation of Nixon 
were conducted in a fair manner, with 
rights for the accused. No action was 
taken by the House of Representatives 
until the facts were clear and indis-
putable in both of those trials. When 
these investigations were complete and 
those two Presidents were found to 
have committed a crime, impeachment 
had bipartisan support, unlike this 
time. 
This investigation is entirely dif-
ferent. It was rushed and was totally 
partisan, with not one single House Re-
publican voting for these two pitiful 
Articles of Impeachment. 
The impeachment trial in the Senate 
has been going on for the past 11 days. 
Unlike in the House, the Senate upheld 
its constitutional duty to conduct a 
fair trial. The Democratic House man-
agers had the opportunity to present 
their case. Then, for the first time in 
this sad affair, the President and his 
team—his lawyers—had an opportunity 
to present their case, their defense. 
Neither article I, ‘‘abuse of power,’’ 
nor article II, ‘‘obstruction of Con-
gress,’’ qualify as constitutional rea-
sons for impeachment. 
It is pretty simple. I am not a law-
yer, but if you look at the facts, it is 
very direct. The Constitution clearly 
lays out four explicit reasons for im-
peaching a President. Even corruption 
does not qualify under these defini-
tions. It is very clear. They itemized 
treason, bribery, high crimes, and mis-
demeanors. And they explained to us in 
the hearings: Another translation in 
modern terms, using the Old English 
for misdemeanors, is crimes. It is an-
other word for crime. 
The charges against President Trump 
don’t come close to any of these speci-
fied requirements. It is as simple as 
that. The House really was beginning 
to make up new constitutional law. 
Each of the other three Presidents who 
has faced impeachment was charged 
with committing a crime. 
President Trump is the first Presi-
dent ever to face impeachment who 
was never accused of any crime in 
these proceedings, whatsoever. These 
two Articles of Impeachment simply do 
not qualify as reasons to impeach any 
President. Further, Democratic House 
managers did not prove their case for 
either of the two Articles of Impeach-
ment. 
The entire case for abuse of power is 
centered around the June 25, 2019, 
phone call between President Trump 
and President Zelensky of Ukraine. 
The Democrats allege President Trump 
only asked for help in investigating the 
Burisma situation for political gain. It 
is clear now, after hearing all the testi-
mony, that the primary motivation to 
ask Zelensky to look into the Biden- 
Burisma corruption issue was to root 
out corruption in the Ukraine. Ukraine 
has had a long history of corruption 
and this President was well within his 
rights to ask for help in rooting out 
this fairly obvious example of corrup-
tion. Democrats completely failed to 
prove the President’s request was for 
political gain only. 
Regarding the obstruction of Con-
gress article, every President has the 
right to exert executive privilege to 
protect our national interests and the 
separation of power. Honestly, this ar-
ticle should have never been received 
in the Senate in the first place. We 
should have dismissed this article out 
of hand. It simply is absurd. 
Arguing that President Trump ob-
structed Congress by claiming his 
rights is unacceptable and would fun-
damentally weaken this right for fu-
ture 
Presidents. 
When 
President 
Trump exerted executive privilege—his 
right under the Constitution—Demo-
crats could simply have pursued the 
subpoenas. That is the way the Found-
ers laid it out. They could have pur-
sued the subpoenas in court. For some 
reason, the House Democrats chose not 
to do that. 
House Democrats were in such a rush 
that they sent the Senate an incom-
plete case. That is why I believe the 
Senate should not have accepted them 
in the first place, because the process 
was illegitimate, inappropriate, and in-
complete. 
Bottom line: House Democrats sim-
ply did not do their job. In the Clinton 
investigation, the House investigated 
for over 400 days before they brought 
Articles of Impeachment. There was a 
conviction. In this case, it was barely 
100. 
The 
Democratic 
House 
managers 
brought the Articles of Impeachment 
and claimed they had overwhelming 
proof. Immediately in their opening 
statement, 
they 
had 
overwhelming 
proof. However, right away, even with 
that, they immediately demanded the 
Senate call witnesses that the House 
had already chosen not to call, like 
John Bolton. They could have easily 
called him but chose not to, claiming it 
would take too long. Instead, they de-
manded that the Senate call additional 
witnesses who were not included in the 
House investigation. 
The Constitution requires that the 
House conduct the investigation, in-
cluding calling witnesses, taking depo-
sitions, collecting evidence, and the 
Senate is charged to rule based on the 
evidence the House provides. 
This was designed this way for a very 
specific reason, a very practical reason. 
In the House, committees can inves-
tigate these charges while the rest of 
the House continues to do their legisla-
tive work. Unfortunately, in the Sen-
ate, when Articles of Impeachment are 
brought and sent to the Senate, the 
Senate, by constitutional law, must 
stop what it is doing, must open an im-
peachment hearing, and while in a for-
mal impeachment hearing, the Senate 
cannot do anything else by law. It goes 
into legislative shutdown by law. 
In this case, if we were to call addi-
tional witnesses, then we would be set-
ting a dangerous precedent for every 
future case. The House could theoreti-
cally make up any flimsy charge they 
wanted, with no investigation, no wit-
nesses, no testimony, no evidence 
whatsoever, and then send the articles 
to the Senate and expect the Senate to 
do their job. That is not what the 
Founders wrote. That is not what they 
had in mind. It would open up a pan-
dora’s box, shut the Senate down in-
definitely, and you can see why the 
Founders did not want to go down that 
road. That is now how they built this

process. For the sake of our very sys-
tem of government, we cannot yield to 
this unconstitutional effort. 
The House actually did call 17 wit-
nesses. They sent over 193 videos and 
28,000 pages of documents. Ultimately, 
a majority in this body concluded it 
was unnecessary to hear from any of 
those witnesses again. On top of that, 
the impeachment rules do not require 
the Senate to call witnesses. That is 
the House’s job. It is just that simple. 
Let’s be very clear. This entire im-
peachment process has been a purely 
partisan political stunt perpetrated by 
House Democrats. It truly is an embar-
rassment and exactly what Alexander 
Hamilton warned us all against. 
It is no secret—Democrats have been 
trying to obstruct this President from 
day one. On the day President Trump 
was inaugurated, the headline of the 
Washington Post—right here in town— 
claimed ‘‘The Campaign to Impeach 
this President has Begun.’’ 
House Democratic manager ADAM 
SCHIFF, in his opening remarks, said 
you can’t trust elections. That is why 
we have impeachments. Really? Real-
ly? That is absurd. 
The President has done nothing to 
warrant this impeachment process. He 
must be acquitted. If we let House 
Democrats get away with this today, 
we are setting a dangerous precedent 
for the future. 
Already, we are in an era of impeach-
ment. In the first 180 years, we only 
had one impeachment case that came 
to the Senate and was investigated in 
the House. In the last 45 years, we have 
had three investigated by the House, 
and two have actually made it to the 
Senate. If we let Democrats improperly 
use the impeachment process as a par-
tisan political weapon, then it will 
only get worse in the future. 
I call on my colleagues today—I 
plead with my colleagues today—to re-
ject this unconstitutional effort and 
vote to acquit Donald J. Trump of 
these illegitimate and unconstitutional 
Articles of Impeachment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Madam President, I rise 
today in the very Chamber where just 
three Presidential impeachment trials 
have been held over the course of our 
Nation’s history—President Johnson in 
1868, President Clinton in 1999, and now 
President Trump. 
In fact, I sat at this desk the past 2 
weeks listening to over 65 hours of trial 
proceedings, and during that time, we 
heard from 13 witnesses, and we viewed 
193 video clips and 28,000-plus pages of 
documentation. Senators, over a 16- 
hour period, asked over 180 questions. 
In the Senate, we took our solemn duty 
seriously. 
If there is one thing to be remem-
bered from this trial for generations to 
come, it is this: Sadly, over the course 
of our country’s 244-year history, never 
has our Nation faced such a partisan 
abuse of power. Never has the Senate 
been faced with Articles of Impeach-
ment that allege no crimes in an at-
tempt to remove a duly elected Presi-
dent of the United States from office. 
Never before have we seen such a par-
tisan Presidential impeachment proc-
ess. 
In 1974, when President Nixon faced 
impeachment—Nixon, a Republican— 
177 House Republicans joined Demo-
crats in support of the impeachment 
inquiry. During President Clinton’s im-
peachment—a Democrat—31 Democrats 
joined House Republicans. But with 
President Trump, there were zero. Not 
one Republican supported it. In fact, 
there were some Democrats who op-
posed it. So, to be clear, there was ac-
tually bipartisan opposition. 
This impeachment is an unprece-
dented, purely partisan threat to the 
Constitution. Our Founding Fathers, 
the Framers of our great Constitution, 
understood what the power of impeach-
ment meant when they gave it to Con-
gress after great deliberation. 
Alexander Hamilton and James Madi-
son feared—they feared—congressional 
abuse of power and legislative tyranny 
as they debated whether to include the 
power of impeachment in the Constitu-
tion because the Founders knew the re-
moval of a President from office 
amounted to a political death sentence. 
In Federalist 65, Hamilton warns that 
the House could be ‘‘intemperate,’’ was 
the word he used, and abuse their ma-
jority. He proclaimed that the Senate 
would 
be—and 
I 
use 
his 
words— 
‘‘unawed and uninfluenced,’’ the ‘‘inde-
pendent’’ 
institution 
to 
determine 
whether a House impeachment was 
warranted. 
The Founders had the wisdom to es-
tablish 
a 
two-thirds 
Senate 
vote 
threshold to help ensure that removal 
could not be achieved by mere partisan 
politics. The Founders established that 
the thermonuclear option of impeach-
ment must be bipartisan to safeguard 
not just the President from unwar-
ranted removal but, importantly, to 
protect the will of the American people 
who elected the President in the first 
place. 
Unfortunately, NANCY PELOSI, ADAM 
SCHIFF, and House Democrats have 
done exactly what the Founding Fa-
thers feared. They have ignored what 
House manager and the chairman of 
the House Judiciary Committee, JERRY 
NADLER, himself correctly observed 
during the 1998 Clinton impeachment 
when he stated: 
There must never be a narrowly voted im-
peachment or an impeachment substantially 
supported by one of our major political par-
ties and largely opposed by the other. Such 
an impeachment would lack legitimacy. 
That was JERRY NADLER in 1998. 
Unfortunately, NANCY PELOSI’s House 
of Representatives discarded NADLER’s 
very wise words, and they stubbornly 
defied historical precedent by rushing 
these Articles of Impeachment, driven 
by a Christmas deadline, on a purely 
partisan vote and sending it to the 
Senate. 
The Democrats’ decision was a mis-
take, and it has only further divided 
our Nation at a time when we need to 
be working together. It was wrong, and 
it has damaged our country. We now 
need to fear for future Presidents, 
Democrats or Republicans, who will 
hold the oath of office in this newly 
hyperpartisan era. 
Importantly, for the first time in our 
Nation’s history, the Articles of Presi-
dential Impeachment passed by NANCY 
PELOSI’s 
House 
accuse 
President 
Trump of no crimes, let alone dem-
onstrate the President’s actions war-
ranted removal from office. 
This partisan and weak case from the 
House managers proves what this im-
peachment has always been about—it 
is about purely partisan politics. This 
impeachment has been nothing more 
than an attempt to overturn the 2016 
Presidential election and to severely 
impact the 2020 election. 
By the way, if we were to convict the 
President of either one of these arti-
cles, one or both, he literally would be 
removed not only from office but from 
the 2020 ballot. 
Speaking of the 2020 ballot, the 2020 
election is already underway. Just yes-
terday, Americans cast their votes in 
Iowa for President of the United 
States. In fact, last Friday, Montanans 
submitted signatures and filed the pa-
perwork to place President Trump on 
the Montana ballot for the 2020 elec-
tion. 
Sadly, it is no surprise that we are in 
this situation today. You see, the 
Democrats have been obsessed with im-
peaching President Trump since before 
he was even sworn into office. They 
could not accept the fact that Donald 
Trump won the 2016 election. 
On December 15, 2016, just 5 weeks 
following the 2016 Presidential elec-
tion, there was a headline from Vanity 
Fair, and I quote it: ‘‘Democrats are 
Paving the Way to Impeach Donald 
Trump.’’ 
On January 20—now, when I think of 
January 20, 2017, I think about the day 
the President was inaugurated, which 
it was—the Washington Post headline 
read ‘‘The campaign to impeach Presi-
dent Trump has begun.’’ This article 
was posted 19 minutes—just 19 min-
utes—after President Trump was sworn 
into office. 
It gets worse. Ten days later, on Jan-
uary 30, 2017, the attorney for the whis-
tleblower who was talked about during 
the trial—the whistleblower’s attor-
ney, 10 days after President Trump was 
inaugurated back in 2017, said this in a 
tweet: ‘‘Coup has started. First of 
many steps. Rebellion. Impeachment 
will follow immediately.’’ That was the 
attorney for the whistleblower who 
really started this entire impeachment 
process. 
We have even seen some House Demo-
crats publicly state that the only way 
to beat President Trump in the next 
election is to impeach him. 
Our 
Founding 
Fathers 
would 
be 
grieved by the careless use of this most 
powerful tool against the Presidency. 
Impeachment is not a tool to overturn

the results of a past election. It is not 
a tool to change the outcome of an up-
coming election. 
You see, in America, the power of our 
government doesn’t come from 100 Sen-
ators in this body or a handful of law-
makers; our power is derived from the 
people whom we serve. This grand 
American experiment of our demo-
cratic Republic is built upon the idea 
of a government of, by, and for the peo-
ple. 
Montanans elected me to represent 
them in the U.S. Senate, to be their 
voice on this floor and in Washington, 
DC. Montanans overwhelmingly oppose 
this impeachment. Montanans stand 
with President Trump. In fact, Presi-
dent Trump won Montana by over 20 
points in the 2016 election. Supporting 
this impeachment means ignoring the 
voices of Montanans who voted for 
President Trump in the last election, 
and it means silencing Montanans who 
plan to vote for President Trump in the 
2020 election. 
Keep in mind—never before has the 
U.S. Senate ever removed a President 
from office, and it is not going to hap-
pen now. 
I am voting to acquit President Don-
ald J. Trump. 
For the good of our country, let it be 
seared in our minds forevermore: Im-
peachment must never ever again be 
used as a partisan weapon. 
I encourage my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to fully understand 
the magnitude of what this would 
mean for our country. This is the first 
purely partisan impeachment in our 
Nation’s history, and it must be our 
last. It should be up to the American 
people to decide who their next Presi-
dent is, not the U.S. Senate. 
The answer is an election, not im-
peachment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. 
ROUNDS. 
Madam 
President, 
today, I rise to discuss the decision on 
whether to remove the President from 
office based on the Articles of Impeach-
ment sent to us by the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Our Founding Fathers included im-
peachment—effectively 
overturning 
the will of the American electorate—to 
be used only as a last resort. They 
trusted the Senate, requiring more sol-
emn judgment than their counterparts 
in the House, to decide whether an alle-
gation by the House has the substan-
tiality to require removal from office. 
According to ‘‘Commentaries on the 
Constitution’’ by Joseph Story, the 
Framers saw the Senate as a tribunal 
‘‘removed from popular power and pas-
sions . . . and from the more dangerous 
influence of mere party spirit,’’ guided 
by ‘‘a deep responsibility to future 
times.’’ 
This impeachment process, driven by 
partisan desire, was rushed and lacked 
any proper form and substance. This is 
an attempt by the House to undo the 
results of the 2016 election and impact 
the 2020 election. 
Article II, section 4 of the Constitu-
tion states: ‘‘The President, Vice Presi-
dent and all civil Officers of the United 
States, shall be removed from Office on 
Impeachment for, and Conviction of, 
Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors.’’ 
During the debates at the Federal 
Convention of 1787, James Madison, 
Alexander Hamilton, and others relied 
heavily on Sir William Blackstone’s 
work, ‘‘Commentaries on the Law of 
England,’’ which Madison described as 
‘‘a book which is in every man’s hand.’’ 
Within his work, Blackstone dis-
cussed ‘‘high misdemeanors,’’ which in-
cluded many crimes against the King 
and government, including maladmin-
istration. According to Blackstone, 
maladministration applied to high offi-
cers in public trust and employment 
and was punished by the method of par-
liamentary impeachment. It is from 
this understanding that the Framers 
selected 
‘‘high 
Crimes 
and 
Mis-
demeanors’’ 
for 
the 
impeachment 
clause in our Constitution. 
The term ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’ had a limited and tech-
nical meaning that was well known to 
the Framers. It was a term of art. As 
early as 14th century England, high 
crimes and misdemeanors were a cat-
egory of political crimes against the 
State and were tried in parliamentary 
impeachments. It should be understood 
that the word ‘‘high’’ in high crimes 
and misdemeanors is a modifying ad-
jective and also applies to the word 
‘‘misdemeanors.’’ 
‘‘High misdemeanors’’ was applied in 
impeachment proceedings conducted 
by Parliament long before there was 
such a crime as a misdemeanor as we 
know it today. Misdemeanors alone re-
ferred to criminal sanctions for private 
wrongs. High crimes and misdemeanors 
were charged against officers of the 
‘‘highest rank and favor with the 
crown’’ or who were in ‘‘judicial or ex-
ecutive offices’’ and, because of their 
stations, were unindictable by ordinary 
rules of justice. 
For those individuals who were not 
indictable by the ordinary rules of jus-
tice, the Founding Fathers, in their 
subtle brilliance, sought to have some-
thing akin to crimes and misdemeanors 
that allowed them to impeach for great 
and 
dangerous 
crimes 
committed 
against the State. 
As we know, the Founding Fathers 
specifically adopted the phrase ‘‘high 
crimes and misdemeanors.’’ The em-
phasis on high misdemeanors is impor-
tant in this context because the House 
of Representatives has not alleged 
treason, and they have not alleged 
bribery. Their case rests on whether 
the articles charged are the types of 
high crimes and high misdemeanors in-
tended by our Framers. 
In 
defining 
high 
misdemeanors, 
Blackstone stated that ‘‘the first and 
principal is the mal-administration of 
such 
high 
officers.’’ 
However, 
the 
Founding Fathers specifically chose 
not to include maladministration as a 
basis for impeachment. 
When George Mason and James Madi-
son debated the specific language of 
the impeachment clause, Mason stated: 
Why is the provision restrained to treason 
and bribery only? Treason as defined in the 
Constitution will not reach many great and 
dangerous offences. Hastings is not guilty of 
Treason. Attempts to subvert the Constitu-
tion may not be Treason as above defined. 
Mason then moved to add after brib-
ery, ‘‘or maladministration,’’ to which 
Madison replied and I quote: ‘‘So vague 
a term will be equivalent to a tenure 
during pleasure of the Senate.’’ 
The Framers knew what they were 
adopting when they chose ‘‘high crimes 
and misdemeanors.’’ They explicitly 
rejected maladministration and other 
vague terms in favor of more specific 
allegations, which had a limited and 
technical meaning. 
In the first Article of Impeachment 
before the Senate, the question is 
whether abuse of power as a charge on 
its own is an impeachable offense. 
The answer is no. Abuse of power 
does not have a limited meaning and is 
as vague as maladministration. The 
Framers actually discussed abuse of 
power and rejected it. 
At the Virginia ratifying convention, 
James Iredell, one of the first Supreme 
Court Justices, stated: 
No power of any kind or degree can be 
given but what may be abused; we have, 
therefore, only to consider whether any par-
ticular power is absolutely necessary. If it 
be, the power must be given, and we must 
run the risk of abuse. 
In the first Article of Impeachment, 
the House has claimed that the abuse 
of power is within the scope of high 
crimes and misdemeanors. I believe the 
Founding Fathers saw abuse of power 
as an inherent risk within the delega-
tion of that authority. The Framers 
did 
not 
intend 
impeachment 
pro-
ceedings to be brought every time an 
abuse of power is alleged. 
In the second Article of Impeach-
ment, the House alleges the President 
obstructed Congress when he refused to 
comply with congressional subpoenas. 
The President rejected the legitimacy 
of those subpoenas. The House then 
failed to pursue redress through the 
courts, rejecting the court’s rightful 
role in settling disputes between the 
two branches of government. 
The separation of powers doctrine 
recognized executive privilege as a law-
ful exercise for the President to protect 
both 
Presidential 
and 
deliberative 
process communications. The House 
showed a deliberate disregard for the 
proper role of the judicial branch and 
now expects the Senate to gather evi-
dence after they have already im-
peached. 
Alleging an obstruction of Congress 
charge before the House exhausted its 
remedy for judicial relief would change 
the balance of power between our co- 
equal branches of government and ig-
nore the rightful place the courts hold 
in arbitrating differences between the 
executive and legislative branches. 
No branch of government is above 
the Constitution. We are obligated

under oath of office to support and de-
fend it. 
Article I, sections 2 and 3 of the Con-
stitution state ‘‘the House shall have 
the sole Power of Impeachment,’’ and 
‘‘[t]he Senate shall have the sole Power 
to try all Impeachments.’’ The Fram-
ers intentionally separated these au-
thorities. 
The Senate does not have the author-
ity to impeach; however, the Senate 
does have the authority to judge the 
sufficiency of articles presented to it. 
The Senate, as a trier of facts, should 
not overstep its role. It is the House’s 
responsibility to bring the evidence to 
make their case, not simply make an 
allegation. 
This does not mean that the Senate 
cannot call witnesses, but it most cer-
tainly should not be the Senate’s obli-
gation to do so because the House 
failed to do so in the first place. 
Upon the founding of the Senate, 
James Madison explained that the Sen-
ate would be a ‘‘necessary fence’’ 
against the ‘‘fickleness and passion’’ 
that tended to influence the attitudes 
of the general public and Members of 
the House of Representatives. 
George Washington is said to have 
told Thomas Jefferson that the Fram-
ers had created the Senate to ‘‘cool’’ 
House legislation, just as a saucer was 
used to cool hot tea. For impeachment, 
there can be no difference. 
When the House is ignited by par-
tisan passions, eager to reach a desired 
result, the Senate must be cool and 
firm in its heightened review. In recog-
nizing the haste and half-hearted at-
tempt by our colleagues in the House, 
the Senate must also recognize these 
Articles of Impeachment to be wholly 
insufficient and not warranting a re-
moval from office. 
Let this decision lie in its rightful 
place, with the electorate. The Senate 
has conducted a fair, impartial trial. 
We did our due diligence and fulfilled 
our constitutional duty. Now it is time 
to bring this process to a close and get 
on with the business of the American 
people who sent us here. 
I will vote against the Articles of Im-
peachment, in keeping with the con-
stitutional intent our Framers ex-
pected. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that citations to my remarks 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
CITATIONS 
1. According to Commentaries on the Con-
stitution by Joseph Story, the Framers saw 
the Senate as a tribunal ‘‘removed from pop-
ular power and passions . . . and from the 
more dangerous influence of mere party spir-
it,’’ guided by ‘‘a deep responsibility to fu-
ture times.’’ 2 Joseph Story, Commentaries 
on the Constitution § 743 (1833). 
2. During the debates of the Federal Con-
vention of 1787, James Madison, Alexander 
Hamilton and others relied heavily on Sir 
William Blackstone’s work, Commentaries 
on the Laws of England, which Madison de-
scribed as ‘‘a book which is in every man’s 
hand.’’ 3 The Debates in the Several State 
Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal 
Constitution, at 501 (Jonathan Elliot 2nd ed. 
1987). 
3. According to Blackstone, maladmin-
istration applied to high officers in public 
trust and employment and was punished by 
the method of parliamentary impeachment. 
4 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the 
Laws of England, *122.

The 
term 
‘‘high 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors’’ had a limited and technical 
meaning that was well-known to the fram-
ers. Raoul Berger, Impeachment: The Con-
stitutional Problems 74 (1973). 
5. ‘‘High misdemeanors’’ was applied in im-
peachment proceedings conducted by par-
liament long before there was such a crime 
as a ‘misdemeanor’ as we know it today. 4 
Blackstone at *121. 
6. ‘‘High misdemeanors’’ was applied in im-
peachment proceedings conducted by par-
liament long before there was such a crime 
as a ‘misdemeanor’ as we know it today. Mis-
demeanors alone referred to criminal sanc-
tions for private wrongs. Berger at 61. 
7. High crimes and misdemeanors were 
charged against officers of the ‘‘highest rank 
and favor with the crown’’ or who were in 
‘‘judicial or executive offices’’ and because of 
their stations, were un-indictable by ordi-
nary rules of justice. Berger at 60; See also 
id. ‘‘The House of Lords was reminded of this 
history by Serjeant Pengelly during the im-
peachment of Lord Chancellor Macclesfield 
in 1725: your lordships are now exercising a 
power of judicature reserved in the original 
frame of the English constitution for the 
punishment of offenses of a public nature, 
which may affect the nation; as well in in-
stances where the inferior courts have no 
power to punish the crimes committed by or-
dinary rules of justice; as in cases within the 
jurisdiction of the courts of Westminster 
Hall, where the person offending is by his de-
gree, raised above the apprehension of dan-
ger, from a prosecution carried on in the 
usual course of justice; and whose exalted 
station requires the united accusation of all 
the Commons.’’ 
8. In defining high misdemeanors, Black-
stone stated ‘‘. . . the first and principal is 
the mal-administration of such high officers 
. . .’’ 4 Blackstone at *122. 
9. When George Mason and James Madison 
debated the specific language of the im-
peachment clause, Mason stated: ‘‘Why is 
the provision restrained to treason and brib-
ery only? Treason as defined in the Constitu-
tion will not reach many great and dan-
gerous offences. Hastings is not guilty of 
Treason. Attempts to subvert the Constitu-
tion may not be Treason as above defined.’’ 
2 The Records of the Federal Convention at 
499. See also id: The impeachment of Warren 
Hastings was a failed attempt between 1788 
and 1795 to impeach the first Governor-Gen-
eral of Bengal in the Parliament of Great 
Britain. Hastings was accused of misconduct 
during his time in Calcutta particularly re-
lating to mismanagement and corruption. 
10. Mason then moved to add after bribery, 
‘‘or maladministration,’’ to which Madison 
replied, ‘‘So vague a term will be equivalent 
to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.’’ 2 
The Records of the Federal Convention at 
499. 
11. At the Virginia ratifying convention, 
James Iredall, one of the first Justices of the 
Supreme Court, stated: ‘‘No power of any 
kind or degree can be given but what may be 
abused; we have, therefore, only to consider 
whether any particular power is absolutely 
necessary. If it be, the power must be given, 
and we must run the risk of abuse.’’ 4 The 
Debates in the Several State Conventions on 
the Adoption of the Federal Constitution, at 
95 (Jonathan Elliot 2nd ed. 1987). 
12. Upon the founding of the Senate, James 
Madison explained that the Senate would be 
a ‘‘necessary fence’’ against the ‘‘fickleness 
and passion’’ that tended to influence the at-
titudes of the general public and members of 
the House of Representatives. George Wash-
ington is said to have told Thomas Jefferson 
that the framers had created the Senate to 
‘cool’ House legislation, just as a saucer was 
used to cool hot tea. U.S. Senate, ‘‘Senate

artandhistory/history/minute/Sen-
ate_Created.htm (January 3, 2020). 
Mr. ROUNDS. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor this afternoon to ex-
press my profound disappointment. 
This is a sad moment in our Nation’s 
history. I, like all of us in the Senate, 
came to this body to try and make a 
difference for our constituents, to ad-
dress the kitchen table issues that af-
fect their everyday lives—lowering pre-
scription drug costs, rebuilding our 
crumbling infrastructure, making col-
lege more affordable, protecting our 
environment, helping our veterans, 
supporting our small businesses—so 
many of the things that I and others 
here have worked on. 
Critics have argued that the im-
peachment process is nothing more 
than a political attack orchestrated by 
those who have wanted to remove this 
President since his election. I flatly re-
ject that argument. 
I have repeatedly expressed my reluc-
tance to the use of impeachment. Un-
fortunately, it is this President’s dis-
turbing actions that have put us in this 
position. 
President 
Trump 
went 
to 
great 
lengths to try and force the Ukrainian 
President to help smear Joe Biden, his 
political rival. This scheme included 
withholding military aid and with-
holding a meeting at the White House 
with the Ukrainian President. 
Each of us here took an oath to sup-
port and defend the Constitution. The 
Constitution requires us to do this job. 
It tells us that the Senate shall have 
‘‘the sole Power to try all Impeach-
ments.’’ After the power to declare 
war, the power to impeach is among 
the most serious and consequential 
powers granted to Congress by our 
founding document. 
When we all stood here at the begin-
ning of this trial, we took an oath to do 
‘‘impartial justice.’’ That should mean 
a commitment to seek all of the facts. 
A fair trial means documents and wit-
nesses, facts that will help us better 
understand the truth. 
Previous Senates understood this. In 
fact, every Senate impeachment trial 
in history included witnesses. Most re-
cently, in the Judge Porteous impeach-
ment trial in 2010, when I was one of 
the Senators who served on that im-
peachment committee, we heard from 
26 witnesses, 17 of whom had not testi-
fied before in the House. We believed 
then that Senate witnesses were impor-
tant for impeachment of a Federal dis-
trict court judge. So why wouldn’t we

want witnesses in something as impor-
tant as an impeachment of a sitting 
President? 
We know that documents exist that 
could help shed more light on this case. 
We also know of other witnesses with 
additional firsthand information whom 
we have yet to hear from. We have one 
witness, in particular—former National 
Security Advisor John Bolton, who has 
told the world he has relevant informa-
tion and he is willing to testify. 
Yet, despite all of that, the Senate, 
on a partisan vote, refused to listen to 
Ambassador Bolton or any other wit-
nesses. Members of this institution 
have willfully turned their back on im-
portant, relevant, firsthand informa-
tion. 
On the Articles of Impeachment be-
fore us, I have listened to the extensive 
arguments from both the House man-
agers and the defense counsel for the 
President. I believe the evidence clear-
ly shows that the President abused his 
power—which has been acknowledged 
by several Republican Senators—and 
he obstructed Congress, which is why I 
will be supporting both Articles of Im-
peachment. 
On the first Article of Impeachment, 
it is my strong view that the House 
managers have proved that President 
Trump withheld military aid and a 
White House meeting from the Govern-
ment of Ukraine to further his own po-
litical interests in the upcoming Presi-
dential election and to damage the 
candidacy of his opponent. The evi-
dence presented to the Senate was 
overwhelming. 
Further supporting the House man-
agers’ case, the independent Govern-
ment Accountability Office, the GAO, 
concluded that the withholding of mili-
tary aid to Ukraine was improper and 
illegal under the law. The nature of the 
President’s offenses outlined in the ar-
ticles strike at the very heart of our 
democratic system. 
Our Founding Fathers were very con-
cerned about both foreign interference 
in our democracy and the executive 
abusing the powers of the office for 
electoral gain. James Madison warned 
of a President who ‘‘might betray his 
trust to foreign powers.’’ 
George Washington, in his Farewell 
Address, warned us all ‘‘to be con-
stantly awake, since history and expe-
rience prove that foreign influence is 
one of the most baneful foes of repub-
lican government.’’ 
As a Senator who sits on the Armed 
Services and Foreign Relations Com-
mittees, I am keenly aware of the seri-
ous national security interests that are 
at stake here. This body, the Senate, 
has been deeply supportive of an inde-
pendent Ukraine and a strong U.S.- 
Ukraine relationship. I join with Sen-
ators from both sides of the aisle in 
support of providing lethal assistance 
to help Ukraine better defend itself 
from Russian aggression. We continue 
to do so because it is in our direct na-
tional security interest to support our 
partner in the midst of an active war 
with Russia, our adversary. 
We know that Russia has serious de-
signs on Eastern Europe. They are 
looking at ways to influence European 
countries—former 
Soviet 
republics 
where they think they can make in-
roads—and Ukraine is standing at the 
wall between Eastern Europe and Rus-
sia. 
I also joined the bipartisan leader-
ship of the Ukraine Caucus in writing a 
letter expressing deep concerns over re-
ports that aid to Ukraine was being 
held up. This September 2019 letter 
clearly stated that the administra-
tion’s hold on assistance would do last-
ing damage to the Ukrainian military 
and would undo the progress made by 
Ukraine to defend itself. That was a bi-
partisan letter. 
Putting our national security at risk 
in order to secure personal political fa-
vors is an unacceptable abuse of power, 
and that is why we are here today. In 
response to the overwhelming evidence 
presented by the House managers, the 
President’s counsels failed to refute 
these serious allegations. Their argu-
ments that President Trump was fo-
cused only on the national interest are 
not supported by the facts. The Presi-
dent has never demonstrated an inter-
est 
in 
rooting 
out 
corruption 
in 
Ukraine and has a troubling pattern of 
personally seeking political dirt from 
foreign governments. I worry that this 
behavior will continue. 
The 2020 election is 9 months away, 
and the President continues to suggest 
that he would consider receiving polit-
ical help from foreign governments. 
Just recently, the President suggested 
that China should also investigate the 
Bidens. 
Now, with respect to the second arti-
cle dealing with obstruction of justice, 
the House managers have also pre-
sented overwhelming evidence that 
President Trump obstructed the inves-
tigation 
into 
his 
conduct 
toward 
Ukraine. The President has repeatedly 
denied the House of Representatives’ 
constitutional authority to conduct an 
impeachment inquiry. The President 
ordered Federal agencies and officials 
to ignore all requests for documents 
and all subpoenas. Those agencies 
obeyed the President’s order, and not a 
single document was turned over to the 
House. In total, nine witnesses called 
by 
the 
House 
followed 
President 
Trump’s order and refused to testify 
under subpoena in the impeachment 
proceedings. This is an unprecedented 
attempt to thwart Congress’s constitu-
tional authority to exercise the im-
peachment 
power. 
Even 
President 
Nixon instructed his White House staff 
to voluntarily appear before Congress 
and to testify under oath. 
Despite 
the 
administration’s 
stonewalling, many courageous offi-
cials did come forward to testify at 
great personal and professional ex-
pense. I want to thank those who testi-
fied. Their bravery and commitment to 
the truth should be commended. But if 
the President is allowed to completely 
stonewall congressional impeachment 
investigations into executive branch 
abuses, then the congressional power of 
impeachment is meaningless. 
As a Senator, I never imagined I 
would have to participate in an im-
peachment trial of a sitting President. 
These proceedings cause strain and di-
vision not just here in Congress but 
across the country. I would much pre-
fer that Congress be engaged in the 
critical bipartisan work that is needed 
on important issues, things that can 
improve lives across this country and 
move our Nation forward. I hope that 
this body will move on from this dis-
appointing day and will get back to the 
business of the country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
the decision to remove a President at 
any point in their term—particularly 9 
months 
before 
an 
election—is 
not 
something we should take lightly. Im-
peachment should not be a tool that 
Congress uses to settle policy or per-
sonal disagreement. Instead, it should 
only be used if a President engages in 
misconduct so egregious that their 
conviction and removal is necessary 
and in the Nation’s best interest. 
Alexander Hamilton wrote in Fed-
eralist 65 that the Founders chose the 
Senate as ‘‘the most fit depositary of 
this important trust’’ to make such a 
weighty decision. They actually had 
faith that this body could rise above 
pure partisanship to conduct a fair 
trial and reach a just verdict. 
In this case, however, we could not 
reach bipartisan agreement—not even 
on how to conduct the trial. It is a fact 
that, for the first time in this Nation’s 
history, the Senate will render a ver-
dict in an impeachment hearing with-
out hearing from a single witness and 
without reviewing key documents that 
have been withheld by the executive 
branch. 
As recently as last Friday, OMB ad-
mitted it continues to withhold key 
documents. Let me provide an exam-
ple. In a court filing, an OMB lawyer 
wrote that 24 White House emails were 
being withheld because they ‘‘reflect 
communications’’ by the President, 
Vice President, or top advisers on the 
‘‘scope, duration, and purpose of the 
hold 
on 
military 
assistance 
to 
Ukraine.’’ 
Proceeding without such vital evi-
dence is a real mistake. I came to this 
trial with an open mind, to listen to 
the case presented by both sides and 
then to make a determination based on 
the facts. After hearing the House 
managers’ case, it is clear that Presi-
dent Trump withheld U.S. aid in an ef-
fort to obtain Ukraine’s assistance to

S839 
February 4, 2020 
win reelection by asking that Ukraine 
launch and make public an investiga-
tion into Joe Biden, Mr. Trump’s polit-
ical opponent. 
The President’s legal team tried to 
argue that this didn’t happen, but 
without seeing key documents and 
hearing from key fact witnesses such 
as John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, 
top advisers with firsthand knowledge 
of the President’s conduct and motives, 
their arguments were not persuasive. 
So, after weighing the evidence avail-
able to us and considering the Presi-
dent’s pattern of similar misconduct, I 
will vote yes on the Articles of Im-
peachment. 
The House presented a compelling 
factual case. Congress appropriated 
nearly $400 million in foreign aid to 
Ukraine, an ally engaged in a war with 
a major power, Russia. It was signed 
into law by President Trump, who 
knew what he was signing and what it 
entailed. President Trump also knew 
that Ukraine desperately needed the 
aid and America’s partnership in its ef-
forts against the huge power, Russia. 
He used that vulnerability to his ad-
vantage. He privately demanded that, 
in exchange for U.S. aid and a White 
House meeting for Ukraine’s newly 
elected President, Ukraine’s leaders 
had to publicly announce an investiga-
tion that would damage his political 
rival, Vice President Joe Biden. The 
President relayed those same demands 
to senior Ukrainian officials through 
both private and official government 
channels. This was a clear quid pro 
quo, and it is at the heart of the argu-
ment in the first Article of Impeach-
ment: abuse of power. 
President Trump took this action to 
benefit himself personally and not for 
the good of the Nation. He violated the 
law by withholding appropriated funds 
in order to benefit himself and not our 
country. President Trump did not 
withhold these funds because of con-
cern about corruption generally. In-
stead, he demanded just two specific 
investigations—Burisma and Biden— 
both intended to help him win reelec-
tion in 2020. 
After hearing the House managers’ 
presentation, I think we have got to 
really ask ourselves, How can this 
President deal with any foreign nation 
after compromising himself in such a 
fashion? How can he be trusted to en-
sure that American elections are free 
from foreign interference? Other coun-
tries are watching. After the President 
compromised himself this way with 
Ukraine, what is to keep them, or any 
other country, from seeking benefits 
from the President in exchange for po-
litical or personal assistance? So, if the 
Senate refuses to correct this prece-
dent now, the door to foreign political 
influence in our elections will be 
opened. 
The House managers also presented a 
strong case on the second Article of 
Impeachment: obstruction of Congress. 
Here, the facts themselves are not in 
dispute. President Trump ordered his 
administration to withhold all docu-
ments and ordered executive branch 
witnesses not to testify before the 
House began its inquiry. The Presi-
dent’s legal team countered that he has 
a right to defy congressional subpoenas 
as a matter of executive privilege, but 
there is no precedent for their sweeping 
claim of absolute immunity from con-
gressional oversight, particularly in 
the 
context 
of 
impeachment 
pro-
ceedings. 
President Trump has taken the posi-
tion that there are no checks on his 
Presidential 
authority, 
effectively 
placing himself above the law, and I 
don’t believe the Senate can let this 
stand. Unfortunately, the President’s 
actions are not isolated incidents. Both 
Articles of Impeachment point to this. 
The articles note: ‘‘These actions were 
consistent with President Trump’s pre-
vious 
invitations 
of 
foreign 
inter-
ference in U.S. elections’’ and with 
‘‘previous efforts to undermine United 
States Government investigations into 
foreign interference in United States 
elections.’’ 
During the 2016 campaign, President 
Trump welcomed Russia’s assistance to 
defeat his opponent, Hillary Clinton. 
The Mueller report detailed exactly 
how the Trump campaign sought to 
work with Russia to improve his elec-
toral chances, including providing in-
ternal campaign polling data to a Rus-
sian operative, inviting Russia to hack 
Hillary Clinton after Russia had al-
ready successfully hacked the Demo-
cratic National Committee, and ob-
taining information about upcoming 
releases of emails stolen by Russian 
agents and weaponizing these stolen 
documents to harm Hillary Clinton. 
When this conduct came under ques-
tion, President Trump obstructed the 
investigation. Special Counsel Mueller 
catalogued not 1 or 2 but 10 clear in-
stances where President Trump sought 
to interfere in this investigation. This 
isn’t my view. This isn’t anyone else’s 
view; it is a catalogue of a group of 
legal professionals indicating 10 clear 
instances 
where 
Trump 
sought 
to 
interfere in the investigation. 
This egregious pattern of soliciting 
foreign interference and blocking any 
effort to investigate continues to this 
day. As recently as October, while the 
House impeachment inquiry was going 
on, President Trump stood on the 
White House lawn and asked China to 
investigate the Biden family. 
This trial must do impartial justice 
as is required by the oath we all took. 
After listening to the arguments of 
both sides, it is clear the House man-
agers have proven their case. The 
President’s conduct with respect to 
Ukraine has mirrored other parts of his 
Presidency, and it is all about what is 
best for President Trump. If we vote to 
acquit and allow President Trump’s be-
havior, we will set a dangerous prece-
dent, one that has the strong possi-
bility of inflicting lasting damage on 
our country. 
We will be saying that any President, 
Republican or Democratic, can lever-
age their office for personal political 
gain. We will be inviting more foreign 
interference into our elections and say-
ing it is acceptable to use the Presi-
dency to solicit that assistance. His de-
fense counsel admitted as much. 
And we will be accepting the Presi-
dent’s extreme view that article II of 
the Constitution gives him the right to 
do whatever he wants. 
I am convinced this is a rare instance 
where this Senate has no choice but to 
vote to convict and remove this Presi-
dent. I reach this conclusion reluc-
tantly and with deep concern but with 
the belief that this action is necessary 
and cannot and should not be ignored. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia is recognized. 
Mr. WARNER. Madam President, be-
fore I get started on my comments, I 
want to commend my colleague from 
California, who has served in this body 
with great distinction for a long time, 
who was present during the preceding 
impeachment proceedings under Presi-
dent Clinton, and who, time and 
again—and I have had the honor of fol-
lowing in her shoes on the Intelligence 
Committee—has always been a voice 
who stood up for what is right, for 
what is correct, oftentimes what may 
not be politically expedient but what 
she thinks is right and appropriate. 
It is with great honor that I follow 
her as I make my statement as well on 
this most serious of matters, the im-
peachment of Donald J. Trump. So I 
thank my friend, the senior Senator 
from California, for her comments. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank Mr. WAR-
NER. 
Mr. WARNER. I will echo many of 
her thoughts. 
Madam President, I want to begin my 
remarks the way we began this trial: 
with the oath we each took to do im-
partial justice. Now, any other day, we 
walk into this Chamber as Republicans 
and Democrats, but in this trial we 
have a much greater responsibility. 
The allegations against this Presi-
dent are grave. The House managers 
presented a compelling case, based on 
the testimony of more than a dozen 
witnesses. And the remarkable thing 
about the dozen witnesses that we saw 
clips of: all of these witnesses were ei-
ther appointees—political appointees— 
of President Trump or career public 
servants. The fact that these dozen- 
plus witnesses had the courage to 
speak truth to power when they knew 
that their careers, their reputations 
would be sullied in many ways speaks 
volumes. 
Their testimony and the House man-
agers’ case presents a clear fact pat-
tern, a fact pattern that even many of 
my Republican colleagues acknowledge 
is true. 
This 
evidence 
reflects 
a 
corrupt 
scheme to solicit foreign interference 
in support of this President’s reelec-
tion. The President both unlawfully 
withheld aid to an ally at war with 
Russia and he withheld a White House

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S840 
February 4, 2020 
meeting that would have strengthened 
our relationship with a democratically 
elected leader of Ukraine, a leader who 
was trying to prevent further Russian 
occupation of his country. 
The President used these powerful 
tools of American foreign policy as le-
verage—not leverage to further ad-
vance America’s national interests but 
leverage to secure investigations into a 
political opponent. He also used these 
as an opportunity to try to expound on 
the so-called CrowdStrike conspiracy 
theory, a notion that has been repeat-
edly debunked by Mr. Trump’s own law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies; 
a theory that somehow it was Ukraine, 
not Russia, that attacked our democ-
racy in 2016. It is a theory, by the way, 
that currently has been and continues 
to be promoted by the Russian spy 
services. 
Since this information came to light, 
the President has attempted to con-
found the House of Representatives’ 
constitutional role in the impeachment 
process. The White House issued a 
blanket refusal to provide any wit-
nesses or documents without any his-
torical precedent or sound legal argu-
ment to support this position. For this 
reason, 
President 
Trump 
is 
also 
charged with obstruction of Congress. 
Frankly, I understand some of the 
points the President’s defense team has 
raised concerning this second Article of 
Impeachment. There are legitimate 
questions to consider about executive 
privilege and separation of powers, but 
we cannot accept the absolute immu-
nity argument this White House has in-
vented. This absolute stance and the 
evidence we have seen about the Presi-
dent’s corrupt actions and intentions 
do not reflect a principled, good-faith 
defense of executive privilege. Rather, 
it suggests an effort to deny Congress 
the constitutional authority to inves-
tigate Presidential wrongdoing and, ul-
timately, to prevent exposure of the 
President’s conduct. 
In reviewing this evidence, I have 
tried to stick to my oath of impar-
tiality. I have tried to keep an open 
mind about what witnesses like John 
Bolton and Mick Mulvaney—people 
who were in the room with the Presi-
dent—could tell us. If anyone can pro-
vide new information that further ex-
plains the President’s actions, it is 
they. But I don’t see how the White 
House’s desperate efforts to block wit-
nesses is anything but an admission 
that what they would say under oath 
would not be good for this President. 
And I am deeply disappointed that the 
Senate could not achieve the majority 
necessary for a full, fair trial. Con-
sequently, the defense of the President 
that we are left with is thin, legalistic, 
and, frankly, cynical. 
Instead of disputing the core facts, 
which are damning on their own terms, 
the President’s lawyers have resorted 
to remarkable legal gymnastics. The 
notion that even if the President did 
what he is accused of, abuse of power is 
not impeachable; that foreign inter-
ference is not a crime; that even call-
ing witnesses to seek the truth about 
the President’s actions and motiva-
tions might somehow endanger the Re-
public. 
And 
then 
when 
Professor 
Dershowitz made his bizarre argument 
that abusing Presidential power to aid 
your reelection cannot be impeachable 
if you believe your own election to be 
in the national interest, I paid close at-
tention. Frankly, I paid closer atten-
tion to what Professor Dershowitz said 
in this Chamber than I paid when I was 
in his class back in 1977. But you don’t 
need a Harvard Law School degree to 
understand what utter nonsense that 
argument is and where it could take us 
if we followed it to its logical conclu-
sion. 
The Framers wrote impeachment 
into the Constitution precisely because 
they were worried about the abuse of 
Presidential power. And if an abuse of 
power is what the Framers had in mind 
when they crafted impeachment, then, 
the two questions remaining in our de-
liberations are simple: Did President 
Trump abuse his power and should he 
be removed from office? 
The House managers have presented 
a compelling case that the President 
did pressure Ukraine to announce po-
litically 
motivated 
investigations. 
Again, a number of my Republican col-
leagues have acknowledged these facts, 
acknowledged that what the President 
did was wrong. And, frankly, it is clear 
why he did it. Does anyone here hon-
estly believe that Donald Trump want-
ed an investigation into the Bidens for 
any other reason than to damage Joe 
Biden politically and, therefore, aid in 
his own reelection? Time and again, 
this President has shown a willingness 
to attack anyone who stands in his 
way. And on this he is ecumenical—Re-
publicans, Democrats, members of his 
staff, Members of this body. Nobody is 
off limits. There is nothing out of char-
acter about this President using every 
available tool to damage an opponent 
regardless of their political party. 
I don’t find fault for the President in 
his unorthodox style. That is not an 
impeachable offense. The long list of 
things I disagree with this President on 
are not impeachable offenses either. 
But the Constitution draws a line that 
is much clearer than the President’s 
lawyers have tried to argue. The Presi-
dent crossed it. He abused his power. 
He commandeered America’s foreign 
policy, not to advance America’s inter-
est but to advance Donald Trump’s po-
litical interest. And despite his efforts 
to cover it up, he got caught. 
Now, each one of us must vote guilty 
or not guilty. I will vote to convict the 
President because I swore an oath to do 
impartial justice and the evidence 
proves the charges against him are 
true. There must be consequences for 
abusing the power of the Presidency to 
solicit foreign interference in our elec-
tions. 
If the Senate fails to hold him ac-
countable, we will be setting a dan-
gerous precedent. We will be giving the 
green light to foreign adversaries and 
future Presidents that this kind of be-
havior is OK. I will vote to convict the 
President because it is the Senate’s 
constitutional responsibility to uphold 
this bedrock American principle that 
no one is above the law, not even the 
President, and especially not the Presi-
dent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I am 
going to read a statement and then I 
am going to go back through the infor-
mation that I used to make the deci-
sion to be able to write this statement. 
Montanans sent me to the U.S. Sen-
ate to hold government accountable. I 
fought to allow this trial to include 
documents and testimony from wit-
nesses with firsthand knowledge of the 
allegations against the President, re-
gardless of whether they were incrimi-
nating or exculpatory, so that the Sen-
ate could make its decision based on 
the best information available. 
Unfortunately, my Republican col-
leagues and the administration blocked 
this information, robbing the American 
people of their legitimate right to hold 
their elected officials accountable. 
Based on the evidence that was avail-
able to me during this trial, I believe 
President Trump abused his power by 
withholding military aid from an ally 
for personal political gain, and that he 
obstructed legitimate oversight by a 
coequal branch of government. 
It is a sad day for this country and 
for all Americans who believe that no 
one—not even the President of the 
United States—is above the law. 
So how did I get to this point? Well, 
just a little over 2 weeks ago, we came 
into this Chamber and we started hear-
ing testimony. That testimony re-
sulted in these two notebooks full of 
notes, 
because, 
quite 
frankly, 
the 
House managers laid out a compelling 
case. The defense made their argu-
ments, but the case of the House was 
incredibly compelling. 
An impeachment is a solemn time. It 
is not something we should be taking 
without the deepest and most serious 
consideration. I compare it to a vote to 
send our people to war. But in this par-
ticular case, there was very little 
transparency, and none, if the Presi-
dent would have had it his way, of in-
formation coming to this body during 
this trial. This, in fact, is the shortest 
impeachment trial of a President ever. 
If we are going to have information to 
make good decisions—and I always said 
if you have good information, you can 
make good decisions—then, the Presi-
dent really needed to open up and co-
operate just a little bit. 
This is the first time ever that we 
had a trial with no witnesses and no 
documents—a trial in the Senate with 
no information from the executive 
branch. And I get it. I get ‘‘executive 
privilege,’’ and I think there are times 
when executive privilege has to be used 
because the information is sensitive.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S841 
February 4, 2020 
But I have to tell you that the Wil-
liams letter is a prime example. I went 
down to the SCIF. I read it. I have to 
tell you something. If there is some-
thing in there that needs to be classi-
fied, you have me. The information in 
that letter was information that I 
knew before I went in the SCIF. It is 
the same with many of the emails—if 
not all of the emails—that the Presi-
dent has requested to be classified and 
kept away from this body and kept 
away from the press. 
That is not the way this democracy 
should work. It should be open. If 
things are done, the people should be 
allowed to know. 
There are moments in time when 
documents have to be classified on sen-
sitive information, but I am here to 
tell you I have seen none of that. I 
think many of the FOIA requests that 
have been brought forth show heavily 
redacted email messages, and then 
when we find out what was really in 
them, there was no need for that redac-
tion. 
So when it comes to the obstruction 
of Congress, the article II impeach-
ment, I don’t think there is any doubt 
that the President obstructed our abil-
ity—the Senate of the United States— 
to do its job as a coequal branch to 
make sure that the executive branch is 
being honest and forthright. 
Let’s talk about the abuse of power. 
There is a lot of information that was 
brought forth during this trial about 
what the President did. It has been 
stated many times on this floor over 
the last nearly 3 weeks. The fact of the 
matter is, there is little doubt that the 
President withheld the aid to an ally 
for the purpose of creating a position 
where they had to do an investigation 
if they were going to get that money, 
or at least announce that investigation 
on a U.S. citizen who happened to be a 
political foe, to corrupt our next elec-
tion. 
There is no doubt about that. Many 
of the folks who are not going to vote 
for impeachment have already said 
that the President has wrongdoing, but 
it is not an impeachable offense. And I 
am here to tell you, if anybody in this 
country—especially the President of 
the United States—corrupts an elec-
tion and that is not an impeachable of-
fense for the President of the United 
States, I don’t know what is. Fair elec-
tions are a foundational issue for this 
country, and to corrupt our elections is 
something that we need to hold people 
accountable for if they have done it. 
And I will tell you that the prosecution 
proved that point beyond a shadow of a 
doubt. 
I would also say that if you take a 
look at the episodes that happened be-
fore we got to this point that have ac-
tually nothing to do with the impeach-
ment, but it does have something to do 
with the point that the defense said 
about folks having been calling for im-
peachment since this President got in 
office, I offer you this: Freedom of 
speech is something that is very impor-
tant to this country. And I can tell you 
that when the President first got into 
office and he got in a fight with the 
Prime Minister of Australia and the 
Prime Minister of Sweden and got in a 
fight with the Prime Minister of the 
best friend the United States has, Can-
ada, I was critical of the President. 
When the President pushed back on 
NATO and embraced every dictator in 
the world, from Putin, to Erdogan, to 
Xi, to Kim Jong Un, yes, I was critical 
of the President. When the President 
pulled troops out of northern Syria and 
left our allies the Kurds on the field 
alone, I was critical of the President. 
When the President did his trade wars 
that put American family farmers and 
Main Street businesses at risk of clo-
sure, I was critical of the President. 
And we should be. That had nothing to 
do with the impeachment, but it abso-
lutely has everything to do with your 
freedom of speech. 
Today—tomorrow, I should say—we 
are going to vote on whether to convict 
or acquit the President on taking tax-
payer dollars and withholding them 
from an ally that is at war with an ad-
versary for his own personal and polit-
ical good, and we are going to vote on 
whether to convict a President of with-
holding information from the entire 
executive branch. And the only ones 
who testified were those patriotic 
Americans who defied his order. We are 
going to vote whether he obstructed 
Congress. This is a no-brainer. He abso-
lutely, unequivocally is guilty of both 
article I and article II of the impeach-
ment. 
So the question is this: If it goes as 
predicted tomorrow and the President 
gets acquitted, where do we go from 
here? I am very concerned about where 
we go from here because the next 
President will use this precedent to not 
give any information to a coequal 
branch of government when we ques-
tion them. The next President will use 
this as, geez, if it is good for me and 
my election, it is good for the country, 
as Dershowitz said. So, Katy, bar the 
door. 
As Chairman SCHIFF said yesterday, 
if you think this President is going to 
stop doing these actions, you are living 
on a different planet than I am living 
on. This will empower him to do any-
thing he wants. 
At some point in time—if we want to 
listen to what the Framers said—at 
some point in time, we are going to 
have to do our constitutional duty. It 
doesn’t appear we are going to do it 
this time. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, for 
more than 200 years after our Constitu-
tion was adopted, only one President 
faced an impeachment trial before the 
Senate. That was Andrew Johnson in 
1868. But now we are concluding our 
second impeachment trial in just 21 
years. 
While each case must stand on its 
own facts, this trend reflects the in-
creasingly 
acrimonious 
partisanship 
facing 
our 
Nation. 
The 
Founders 
warned against excessive partisanship, 
fearing that it would lead to ‘‘insta-
bility, injustice, and confusion,’’ ulti-
mately posing a mortal threat to our 
free government. 
To protect against this, the Founders 
constructed an elaborate system of 
checks and balances to prevent ‘‘fac-
tions’’ from sacrificing ‘‘both the pub-
lic good and the rights of other citi-
zens.’’ Impeachment is part of that 
elaborate system. The Founders set a 
very high bar for its use, requiring that 
the President may only be removed by 
a two-thirds vote of the Senate. 
The Framers recognized that in re-
moving a sitting President, we would 
be acting against not only the office-
holder but also the voters who en-
trusted him with that position. Thus, 
the Senate must consider whether mis-
conduct occurred, its nature, and the 
traumatic and disruptive impact that 
removing a duly elected President 
would have on our Nation. 
In the trial of President Clinton, I ar-
gued that in order to convict, ‘‘we 
must conclude from the evidence pre-
sented to us with no room for doubt 
that our Constitution will be injured 
and our democracy suffer should the 
President remain in office one moment 
more.’’ The House managers adopted a 
similar threshold when they argued 
that President Trump’s conduct is so 
dangerous that he ‘‘must not remain in 
power one moment longer.’’ 
The point is, impeachment of a Presi-
dent should be reserved for conduct 
that poses such a serious threat to our 
governmental institutions as to war-
rant the extreme step of immediate re-
moval from office. I voted to acquit 
President Clinton, even though the 
House managers proved to my satisfac-
tion that he did commit a crime, be-
cause his conduct did not meet that 
threshold. 
I will now discuss each of the arti-
cles. 
In its first Article of Impeachment 
against President Trump, the House as-
serts that the President abused the 
power of his Presidency. While there 
are gaps in the record, some key facts 
are not disputed. 
It is clear from the July 25, 2019, 
phone call between President Trump 
and Ukrainian President Zelensky that 
the investigation into the Bidens’ ac-
tivities requested by President Trump 
was improper and demonstrated very 
poor judgment. 
There is conflicting evidence in the 
record about the President’s motiva-
tion for this improper request. The 
House managers stated repeatedly that 
President Trump’s actions were moti-
vated ‘‘solely’’ for his own political 
gain in the 2020 campaign. Yet the 
President’s attorneys argued that the 
President had sound public policy mo-
tivations, including a concern about 
widespread corruption in Ukraine. 
Regardless, it was wrong for Presi-
dent Trump to mention former Vice

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S842 
February 4, 2020 
President Biden on that phone call, and 
it was wrong for him to ask a foreign 
country to investigate a political rival. 
The 
House 
Judiciary 
Committee 
identified in its report crimes that it 
believed the President committed. Ar-
ticle I, however, does not even attempt 
to assert that the President committed 
a crime. I sought to reconcile this con-
tradiction between the report and the 
articles in a question I posed to the 
House managers, but they failed to ad-
dress that point in their response. 
While I do not believe that the con-
viction of a President requires a crimi-
nal act, the high bar for removal from 
office is perhaps even higher when the 
impeachment is for a difficult-to-de-
fine, noncriminal act. 
In any event, the House did little to 
support its assertion in article I that 
the President ‘‘will remain a threat to 
national security and the Constitution 
if allowed to remain in office.’’ 
As I concluded in the impeachment 
trial of President Clinton, I do not be-
lieve that the House has met its burden 
of showing that the President’s con-
duct, however flawed, warrants the ex-
treme step of immediate removal from 
office, nor does the record support the 
assertion by the House managers that 
the President must not remain in office 
one moment longer. The fact that the 
House delayed transmitting the Arti-
cles of Impeachment to the Senate for 
33 days undercuts this argument. 
For all of the reasons I have dis-
cussed, I will vote to acquit on article 
I. 
Article II seeks to have the Senate 
convict the President based on a dis-
pute over witnesses and documents be-
tween the legislative and executive 
branches. As a general principle, an ob-
jection or privilege asserted by one 
party cannot be deemed invalid, let 
alone impeachable, simply because the 
opposing party disagrees with it. 
Before the House even authorized its 
impeachment inquiry, it issued 23 sub-
poenas to current and former adminis-
tration officials. When the House and 
the President could not reach an ac-
commodation, the House failed to com-
pel testimony and document produc-
tion. The House actually withdrew a 
subpoena seeking testimony from Dr. 
Charles Kupperman, a national secu-
rity aide, once he went to court for 
guidance. And the House chose not to 
issue a subpoena to John Bolton, the 
National Security Advisor, whom the 
House has identified as the key wit-
ness. 
At a minimum, the House should 
have pursued the full extent of its own 
remedies before bringing impeachment 
charges, including by seeking the as-
sistance of a neutral third party—the 
judicial branch. 
In making these choices, the House 
substituted its own political preference 
for speed over finality. The House man-
agers described impeachment as a ‘‘last 
resort’’ for the Congress. In this case, 
however, the House chose to skip the 
basic steps of judicial adjudication and 
instead leapt straight to impeachment 
as the first resort. Therefore, I will 
vote to acquit on article II. 
This decision is not about whether 
you like or dislike this President, or 
agree with or oppose his policies, or ap-
prove or disapprove of his conduct in 
other circumstances. Rather, it is 
about whether the charges meet the 
very high constitutional standard of 
‘‘Treason, 
Bribery, 
or 
other 
High 
Crimes or Misdemeanors.’’ 
It has been 230 years since George 
Washington first took the oath of of-
fice, and there are good reasons why 
during that entire time the Senate has 
never removed a President. Such a 
move would not only affect the sitting 
President but could have unpredictable 
and potentially adverse consequences 
for public confidence in our electoral 
process. 
It is my judgment that, except when 
extraordinary circumstances require a 
different result, we should entrust to 
the people the most fundamental deci-
sion of a democracy; namely, who 
should lead their country. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, in 
1974, after the House Judiciary Com-
mittee voted to approve Articles of Im-
peachment against President Nixon, 
Chairman Peter Rodino, of my home 
State of New Jersey, a lifelong Newark 
resident of my home city who had been 
thrust into the high-profile position 
only the previous year, returned to his 
office and called his wife. When she an-
swered the phone, this chairman, this 
longtime Congressman broke down in 
tears and cried. 
Forty-six years later, our Nation has 
found itself under similar duress, and I 
agree with my fellow Newarker—im-
peaching a President is a profoundly 
sad time for our Nation. It is a painful 
time. No matter what party, if you 
love your country, then this is heart-
breaking. 
When we think about our history as 
Americans, so many of us have rev-
erence for our Founding Fathers and 
our founding documents. They rep-
resented imperfect genius. We talk 
about the Declaration of Independence. 
We hail the Constitution. These docu-
ments literally bent the arc of not just 
our own history but human history for 
democratic governance on the planet. 
While these were milestones in the 
path of our Nation’s relatively brief ex-
istence, the governing document that 
came between the Declaration of Inde-
pendence and our Constitution is often 
overlooked—the Articles of Confed-
eration. 
With the benefit of hindsight, it is 
easy to view the development of our 
Nation as preordained, inevitable—as if 
it were an expected march toward the 
greatness we now collectively hail, 
that this was somehow a perfectly plot-
ted path toward a more perfect union. 
But it wasn’t. 
In 1787, as our Founders gathered in 
Philadelphia, our fledgling country was 
at a crisis and at a crossroads. Its fu-
ture, as in so many moments of our 
past, was deeply uncertain. 
You see, when the Framers designed 
our system of government in the Arti-
cles of Confederation, you can say they 
overcompensated. With the tyranny of 
King George III fresh in their minds, 
they created a government with powers 
so diffuse and decentralized that noth-
ing could really get done. Instead of 
one Nation, we were operating essen-
tially as 13 independent States. The 
Federal Government could not tax its 
citizens. It could not raise money. It 
lacked a judiciary and an executive 
branch. 
So when our Framers arrived in 
Philadelphia that hot summer, they 
would have to thread a difficult needle, 
providing for a strong central govern-
ment that represented the people and 
one that also guarded against the cor-
rupt tendencies that come when power 
is concentrated, as they well knew was 
so in a monarchy. 
Our democratic Republic was their 
solution. The Nation needed a powerful 
Executive, yes, but that Executive 
needed guardrails, and his power need-
ed to be checked and balanced. So the 
Framers created what we now almost 
take 
for 
granted—three 
coequal 
branches of government: the legisla-
tive, 
the 
executive, 
and 
judicial 
branches. Each branch would have the 
ability to check the power of the other 
branches to ensure, as James Madison 
so profoundly argued, that ambition 
would ‘‘be made to counteract ambi-
tion.’’ 
But this system of checks and bal-
ances was not enough for our Founders. 
Still reeling from their experience 
under the oppressive rule of the King, 
many feared an unaccountable, auto-
cratic leader. So the Founders created 
a mechanism of last resort—impeach-
ment. 
George Mason prophetically asked 
the Founders to wrestle with the con-
cept of impeachment at the Constitu-
tional Convention, saying: ‘‘Shall any 
man be above Justice?’’ 
The Founders answered that question 
with a resounding no. The Constitution 
made clear that any Federal officer, 
even the President, would be subject to 
impeachment and removal. No one—no 
one—no one is above the law. This was 
seen as the ultimate safeguard, and it 
has only been invoked twice before in 
American history. This is the third. 
I sat in this very spot and listened to 
the evidence presented, honoring my 
oath to be objective, and based on the 
evidence that was presented in hour 
after hour after hour of presentations, 
I concluded that the President, Donald 
John Trump, is guilty of committing 
high crimes and misdemeanors against 
the United States of America, against 
the people. I believe he abused the awe-
some power of his office for personal 
and political gain to pressure a foreign 
power to interfere in the most sacred 
institution of our democracy, our elec-
tions. He then engaged in a concerted,

far-reaching, and categorical effort to 
cover up his transgression and block 
any efforts for the people’s representa-
tives to have the truth. 
It brings me no satisfaction to come 
to this conclusion. I feel that sadness 
of my predecessor. Yet we have sworn 
an oath to protect and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States. 
This is not a moment that should 
call for partisan passions. It is not a 
moment that we think of in terms of 
the limitlessness of personal ambition. 
This is a patriotic moment. It is about 
putting principle above party. It is 
about honoring this body and the Sen-
ate’s rightful place in our constitu-
tional system of checks and balances. 
It is about fulfilling the enormous 
trust the Founders placed in this body 
as an impartial Court of Impeachment 
and a necessary check on what they 
foresaw as the potential for ‘‘grave 
abuses’’ by the Executive. 
If we fail to hold this President ac-
countable, then we fail the Founders’ 
intent; we fail our democracy; and I 
fear the injury that will result. 
When our grandchildren and their 
children read about this chapter in the 
history books at a time far into the fu-
ture, when this President is a memory 
along with those of us serving in this 
Chamber, it will not be seen through 
the eye of politics or partisanship. 
They will read about how this body 
acted in their moment of constitu-
tional crisis. I fear that their unflinch-
ing eyes, at a time when the full body 
of evidence will be out in the public do-
main, will see clearly how this body ab-
dicated its constitutional responsibil-
ities, surrendering them to partisan 
passions. They will read about how the 
Senate shut its doors to the truth, even 
though it was within easy reach; how, 
for the first time in our history of im-
peachment proceedings for judges and 
for past Presidents, the world’s great-
est deliberative body conducted an im-
peachment trial without demanding a 
single 
witness 
and 
without 
sub-
poenaing a single document; how, even 
as new evidence during the trial con-
tinued to be uncovered, the Members of 
this body failed to even view it. They 
failed to pursue with even the faintest 
effort those things that would have 
easily and more perfectly revealed the 
breadth and depth of the President’s 
misconduct. 
We know across the street, in the Su-
preme Court, the saying is that justice 
is blind, but that means that no one is 
above the law. It does not mean that 
this body should abdicate its respon-
sibilities and it should abandon its 
senses and even abandon common 
sense. If there is evidence we know 
about that could speak beyond a rea-
sonable doubt to this President’s al-
leged crimes and misconduct, it makes 
no sense whatsoever that we should 
deny, in this deliberative body, the 
truth—the truth. 
This kind of willful ignorance, this 
metaphorical closing of our eyes and 
ears, is a grave danger to any democ-
racy. It is the rot from within, when 
the ideals of truth and justice fall vic-
tim to the toxic tyranny of absolute 
partisanship. 
This President has claimed authori-
tarian power that our Constitution was 
explicitly designed to prevent. He has 
literally said that article II allows him 
to do whatever he wants. That out-
rageous statement tomorrow could be 
given life within this democracy. 
He has declared himself unaccount-
able to and above the law. He has 
shredded the very governing ideals of 
this great Republic, and we, the Sen-
ate, the body designed to check such 
abuses of power, that ‘‘dignified . . . 
independent 
. . . 
unawed 
and 
uninfluenced’’ tribunal, as Hamilton so 
famously wrote in Federalist Paper No. 
65, have been enablers to this destruc-
tive instinct. 
This is a sad day. This is a sad mo-
ment in the history of this body and in 
our Nation, and I fear that it is em-
blematic, that it is a symptom of deep-
er challenges to this Nation, challenges 
that are being exploited by our enemies 
abroad and by opportunists here at 
home. 
The factionalism that our Founders 
warned us of has deepened beyond mere 
partisanship to a self-destructive trib-
alism. The ‘‘cunning, ambitious, and 
unprincipled men’’ seeking to subvert 
the power of the people, as Washington 
predicted in his profound and prophetic 
Farewell Address, have found their sea-
son to flourish here in our time. Many 
in our society now hate other Ameri-
cans, not because of the content of 
their character or their virtue and the 
values they hold dear, but we, as Amer-
icans, now more and more see hate pro-
liferating in our country between fel-
low Americans because of what party 
we belong to. 
We have failed to listen to the words 
that come out of each other’s mouths, 
failed to listen to the ideals or the 
principles or the underlying facts be-
cause we now simply listen to partisan-
ship. This Nation was founded with 
great sacrifice. The blood, sweat, and 
tears of our ancestors, which gave life 
and strength to this Nation, are now 
being weakened and threatened, as our 
very first President warned. 
And, yes, today is a sad moment, but 
we, as a nation, have never been de-
fined by our darkest hours. We have al-
ways been defined by how we respond 
to our challenges, how we have refused 
to surrender to cynicism, and how we 
have refused to give in to despair. 
As Senator after Senator today gets 
up and speaks, I fear that mere words 
in this time are impotent and ineffec-
tive. It may mark where we as individ-
uals stand for the record, but the chal-
lenge demands more from all of us in 
this time. We have already seen on this 
Senate floor that sound arguments 
have been dismissed as partisanship. 
We have heard speech after speech and 
seen how they will not cure this time. 
They will not save this Republic from 
our deepening divides. 
So I ask: What will? How? How do we 
heal? How do we meet this crisis? I 
know that this President is incapable 
of healing this Nation. I have never 
seen a leader in high office ever take 
such glee in meanness. He considers it 
some kind of high badge of virtue in 
the way he demeans and degrades his 
political adversaries. He demonizes 
others, often the weak in our society, 
and I firmly believe that he has shown 
that he will even conspire with foreign 
nations to defeat his adversaries, and 
then defend himself not with any truth 
or transparency but by trying to 
heighten and ignite even more partisan 
passions. 
So the question is really, How do we 
heal this Nation? How do we meet this 
challenge that is not embodied in any 
individual? 
It was a man far greater than me 
named Learned Hand who said: 
Liberty lies in the hearts of men and 
women; when it dies there, no constitution, 
no law, no court can save it; no constitution, 
no law, no court can even do much to help it. 
The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not 
too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty 
is the spirit which seeks to understand the 
minds of other men and women; the spirit of 
liberty is the spirit which weighs their inter-
ests alongside its own without bias. 
I continue to quote this great judge. 
Our dangers, as it seems to me, are not 
from the outrageous but from the con-
forming; not from those who rarely and 
under the lurid glare of obloquy upset our 
moral complaisance, or shock us with unac-
customed conduct, but from those, the mass 
of us, who take their virtues and their 
tastes, like their shirts and their furniture, 
from the limited patterns which the market 
offers. 
I love our Nation’s history. I am tell-
ing you right now we have seen that 
the true test of our democracy will not 
come simply from the low actions from 
our leaders on most high. The true test 
of our democracy will not turn alone 
on the actions of this body because 
Presidents before and this body before 
have failed us in dark times. They 
failed the ideals of freedom when time 
and again they defended slavery. This 
body has failed the ideals of liberty 
when time and again it rejected civil 
rights. This body has failed the ideals 
in the past of equality when it voted 
down, again and again, suffrage for 
women. Lo, Presidents before and the 
Senate before has failed this Nation in 
the darkest of times. As the songs of 
my ancestors have said, our path has 
been watered with the tears and blood 
of ancestors. 
How do we heal? How do we move for-
ward? I say on this dark day that the 
hope of this Nation lies with its people. 
As Learned Hand said: The spirit of lib-
erty is not embodied in the Constitu-
tion. Other nations have constitutions 
and have failed. The hope of this Na-
tion will always lie with its people. 
So we will not be cured today, and, I 
tell you, tomorrow’s vote—it is a de-
feat. But we, as a people facing other 
defeats in this body, must never be de-
feated. Just like they beat us down at

Stonewall and they beat us back in 
Selma, the hope of this Nation lies 
with the people who faced defeats but 
must never be defeated. 
So my prayer for our Republic, now 
yet in another crisis in the Senate, is 
that we cannot let this be leading us 
further and further into a treacherous 
time of partisanship and tribalism 
where we tear at each other and when 
we turn against each other. Now is the 
time in America where we must begin, 
in the hearts of people, to turn to each 
other and to begin to find a way out of 
this dark time to a higher ground of 
hope. This is not a time to simply 
point blame at one side or another. 
This is a time to accept responsibility. 
Like our ancestors in the past so un-
derstood, that change does not come 
from Washington. It must come to 
Washington. As I was taught as a boy, 
we didn’t get civil rights because 
Strom Thurmond came to the Senate 
floor one day and pronounced that he 
had seen the light. No, this body re-
sponded to the demands of people, and 
now is a time that we must demand the 
highest virtues of our land and see each 
other for who we are—our greatest 
hope and our greatest promise. 
We are a weary people in America 
again. We are tired. We are frustrated. 
But we cannot give up. That flag over 
there and we who swear an oath to it 
and don’t just parrot words or say 
them with some kind of perfunctory 
obligation—but those who swear an 
oath to this Nation—must now act 
with a greater unyielding conviction. 
We must act to do justice. We must act 
to heal harms. We must act to walk 
more humbly. We must act to love one 
another 
unconditionally. 
And 
now, 
more than ever, perhaps we need to act 
in the words of a great abolitionist, a 
former slave, who in a dark, difficult 
time when America was failing to live 
up to its promise, gave forth a senti-
ment of his actions captured in the po-
etry of Langston Hughes. He declared 
through his deed and through his work 
and through his sacrifice: 
America never was America to me, 
And yet I swear this oath— 
America will be! 
As a Nation, in this difficult time 
where we face the betrayal of a Presi-
dent, the surrender of obligation by a 
body, may we meet this time with our 
actions of good will, of a commitment 
to love and to justice, and to yet again 
elevating our country so that we, too, 
may be like, as it says in that great 
text, ‘‘a light unto all Nations.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here today to talk about the Senate 
trial and the factors I have considered 
in making my decision on the Articles 
of Impeachment from the House. I have 
now read hundreds of pages of legal 
briefs and memos, including the testi-
mony of 17 witnesses. Here, on the Sen-
ate floor, I have reviewed more than 
190 witness videos and listened care-
fully to more than 65 hours of detailed 
presentations from both the House 
managers and from the President’s 
legal team. 
As cofounder and cochair of the 
Ukraine Caucus and someone who is 
proud to represent many Ukrainian 
Americans in Ohio, I have been active 
for the past several years in helping 
Ukraine as it has sought freedom and 
independence since the 2014 Revolution 
of Dignity that saw the corrupt Rus-
sian-backed 
government 
of 
Viktor 
Yanukovych replaced with pro-Western 
elected leaders. 
Since first seeing the transcript of 
the 
phone 
call 
between 
President 
Trump 
and 
President 
Zelensky 
4 
months ago, I have consistently said 
that the President asking Ukraine for 
an investigation into Joe Biden was in-
appropriate and wrong. I have also 
said, since then, that any actions 
taken by members of the administra-
tion or those outside the administra-
tion to try to delay military assistance 
or a White House meeting pending an 
investigation by Ukraine were not ap-
propriate either. 
But while I don’t condone this behav-
ior, these actions do not rise to the 
level of removing President Trump 
from office and taking him off the bal-
lot in a Presidential election year that 
is already well under way. 
I first looked to the fact that the 
Founders meant for impeachment of a 
President to be extremely rare, re-
served for only ‘‘Treason, Bribery, or 
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ 
Any fair reading of what the Founders 
meant in the Constitution and in the 
Federalist papers in the context of his-
tory and just plain common sense 
makes it clear that removing a duly 
elected President demands that those 
arguing for conviction meet a high 
standard. 
As an example, for good reason there 
has never been a Presidential impeach-
ment that didn’t allege a crime. In the 
Clinton impeachment, the independent 
counsel concluded that President Clin-
ton committed not one but two crimes. 
In this case, no crime is alleged. Let 
me repeat. In the two Articles of Im-
peachment that came over to us from 
the House, there is no criminal law vio-
lation alleged. Although I don’t think 
that that is always necessary—there 
could be circumstances where a crime 
isn’t necessary in an impeachment— 
without a crime, it is even a higher bar 
for those who advocate for a convic-
tion, and that high bar is not met here. 
What is more, even though it was de-
layed, the President ultimately did 
provide the needed military assistance 
to Ukraine, and he provided it before 
the September 30 budget deadline, and 
the 
requested 
investigations 
by 
Ukraine were not undertaken. It is an 
important point to make. The aid 
went. The investigations did not occur. 
The military assistance is particu-
larly important to me as a strong sup-
porter of Ukraine. In fact, I was one of 
those Senators who fought to give 
President Obama and his administra-
tion the authority to provide badly 
needed lethal military assistance to 
Ukraine in response to the Russian ag-
gression that came right after the Rev-
olution of Dignity in 2014. 
I must say, I strongly urged the 
Obama administration to use that au-
thority, and, like Ukraine, I was deeply 
disappointed when they did not. I 
strongly supported President Trump’s 
decision to change course and provide 
that assistance shortly after he came 
into office. While visiting Ukrainian 
troops on the frontlines in the Donbas 
region of Ukraine, I have seen first-
hand how much those soldiers need the 
military assistance President Trump 
alone has provided. 
Beyond whether the President’s con-
duct met the high bar of impeachment, 
there is also the underlying issue of the 
legitimacy of the House impeachment 
process. The House Democrats sent the 
Senate a flawed case built on what re-
spected George Washington University 
constitutional law professor Jonathan 
Turley calls ‘‘the shortest proceeding, 
with the thinnest evidentiary record, 
and the narrowest grounds ever used to 
impeach a President.’’ 
Instead of using the tools available 
to 
compel 
the 
administration 
to 
produce documents and witnesses, the 
House followed a self-imposed and en-
tirely political deadline for voting on 
the Articles of Impeachment before 
Christmas. After the rushed vote, the 
House then inexplicably stalled, keep-
ing those articles from being delivered 
here in the Senate for 28 days, time 
they could have used to subpoena wit-
nesses and resolve legitimate disagree-
ments about whether evidence was 
privileged or not. They didn’t even 
bother to subpoena witnesses they then 
wanted the Senate to subpoena for 
them. 
The House process was also lacking 
in fundamental fairness and due proc-
ess in a number of respects. It is in-
comprehensible to me that the Presi-
dent’s counsel did not have the oppor-
tunity to cross-examine fact witnesses 
and that the House selectively leaked 
deposition testimony from closed-door 
sessions. 
Rushing 
an 
impeachment 
case 
through the House without due process 
and giving the Senate a half-baked 
case to finish sets a very dangerous 
precedent. If the Senate were to con-
vict, it would send the wrong message 
and risk making this kind of quick, 
partisan impeachment in the House a 
regular occurrence moving forward. 
That would be terrible for the country. 
Less than a year ago, Speaker NANCY 
PELOSI said: ‘‘Impeachment is so divi-
sive to the country that unless there’s 
something so compelling and over-
whelming and bipartisan, I don’t think 
we should go down that path.’’ She was 
right. 
It is better to let the people decide. 
Early voting has already started in 
some States, and the Iowa caucuses oc-
curred last night. Armed with all the

February 4, 2020 
information, we should let the voters 
have their say at the ballot box. 
During the last impeachment 21 
years ago, now-House Manager Con-
gressman JERRY NADLER said: 
There must never be a narrowly voted im-
peachment or an impeachment substantially 
supported by one of our major political par-
ties and largely opposed by the other. Such 
an impeachment would lack legitimacy. 
In this case, the impeachment wasn’t 
just 
‘‘substantially 
supported’’ 
by 
Democrats; it was only supported by 
Democrats. In fact, a few Democrats 
actually voted with all the Republicans 
to oppose the impeachment. 
Founder Alexander Hamilton feared 
that impeachment could easily fall 
prey to partisan politics. That is ex-
actly what happened here with the 
only purely partisan impeachment in 
the history of our great country. For 
all of these reasons, I am voting 
against the Articles of Impeachment 
tomorrow. 
It is time to move on and to move on 
to focus on bipartisan legislation to 
help the families whom we represent. 
Unlike 
the 
House, 
the 
Senate 
is 
blocked from conducting its regular 
business during impeachment. 
My colleague from New Jersey asked 
a moment ago, how do we heal? How do 
we heal the wounds? Our country is di-
vided, and I think the impeachment 
has further divided an already polar-
ized country. I think we heal, in part, 
by surprising the people and coming 
out from our partisan corners and get-
ting stuff done—stuff that they care 
about that affects the families we were 
sent here to represent. 
While in the impeachment trial, we 
were prevented from doing the impor-
tant legislative work our constituents 
expect, like passing legislation to 
lower prescription drug costs, like re-
building 
our 
crumbling 
roads 
and 
bridges, like addressing the new addic-
tion crisis—the combination of syn-
thetic opioids like fentanyl and crystal 
meth, pure crystal meth coming from 
Mexico. It is an opportunity for us to 
strengthen our economy with better 
skills training, including passing legis-
lation to give workers the skills they 
need to meet the jobs that are out 
there. Those are just a few ideas that 
are ready to go—ideas the President 
supports, 
Republicans 
support, 
and 
Democrats support. 
I have been working on bipartisan 
initiatives like the JOBS Act to pro-
vide that needed skills training, the 
Restore Our Parks Act to deal with the 
infrastructure that is crumbling in our 
national parks, the Energy Savings and 
Industrial Competitiveness Act, which 
promotes energy efficiency—something 
we should be able to agree on across 
the aisle. All of these have been sitting 
idle this year as we have grappled with 
impeachment. 
How do we heal? How do we heal the 
wounds? In part, let’s do it by working 
together to pass legislation people care 
about. 
Back home, I have seen that the im-
peachment process has, indeed, further 
divided an already polarized country. A 
conviction in the Senate, removing 
Donald Trump from office and taking 
his name off the ballot, would dan-
gerously deepen that growing rift. That 
is one reason I am glad we are not like-
ly to see a conviction because I do care 
about our country and bringing it to-
gether. 
Instead, my hope is that lessons have 
been learned; that we can heal some 
wounds for the sake of the country; 
that we can turn to the bipartisan 
work most Americans expect us to do; 
and that we can allow American vot-
ers, exercising the most important con-
stitutional check and balance of all, to 
have their say in this year’s Presi-
dential election. I believe this is what 
the Constitution requires and what the 
country needs. 
I yield back my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, as I rise 
today to discuss this impeachment 
trial, I am reminded of an inscription 
above the front door of the Finance 
Building in Harrisburg, PA, from the 
1930s. Here is the inscription: ‘‘All pub-
lic service is a trust, given in faith and 
accepted in honor.’’ 
I believe that President Trump and 
every public official in America must 
earn that trust every day. That sacred 
trust is given to us, as the inscription 
says, ‘‘in faith,’’ by virtue of our elec-
tion. 
The question for the President and 
every public official is this: Will we ac-
cept this trust by our honorable con-
duct? The trust set forth in the inscrip-
tion is an echo of Alexander Hamilton’s 
words in Federalist No. 65, where Ham-
ilton articulated the standard for im-
peachment as ‘‘offenses which proceed 
from the misconduct of public men, or, 
in other words, from the abuse or viola-
tion of some public trust.’’ 
Over the past 2 weeks, I have listened 
carefully to the arguments put forward 
by the President’s defense lawyers and 
the House managers. In light of the 
substantial record put forth by the 
managers in this case, I have deter-
mined that the managers have not only 
met but exceeded their burden of proof. 
President Trump violated his duty as 
a public servant by corruptly abusing 
his power to solicit foreign inter-
ference in the 2020 election and by re-
peatedly obstructing Congress’s con-
stitutionally based investigation into 
his conduct. 
President 
Trump’s 
clearly 
estab-
lished pattern of conduct indicates 
that he will continue to be ‘‘a threat to 
national security and the Constitution 
if allowed to remain in office.’’ For 
these reasons, I will vote guilty on 
both article I and article II. 
This impeachment was triggered by 
the President’s conduct. We are here 
because 
the 
President 
abused 
his 
power—the awesome power of his of-
fice—to demand that an ally inves-
tigate a political opponent, proving his 
contempt for the Constitution and his 
duties as a public official. 
The House managers provided sub-
stantial evidence of wrongdoing. First, 
as to article I regarding abuse of 
power, many of the facts here are un-
disputed. For example, there is no dis-
pute that the President has said, when 
referring to the Constitution itself: 
‘‘Article II allows me to do whatever I 
want.’’ This is what the President of 
the United States of America said. 
Then he withheld congressionally au-
thorized military assistance to Ukraine 
in a White House meeting with Presi-
dent Zelensky and conditioned that 
military assistance and the meeting on 
Ukraine publicly announcing inves-
tigations into Vice President Biden and 
his son, as well as a debunked con-
spiracy theory about the 2016 election 
interference. The memorandum of the 
July 25 phone call in which President 
Trump asked President Zelensky ‘‘to 
do us a favor though,’’ after Zelensky 
brought up in the conversation mili-
tary assistance, that evidence is com-
pelling evidence of wrongdoing. 
The 
President 
reiterated 
on 
the 
White House lawn on October 3 that 
Ukraine should ‘‘start a major inves-
tigation into the Bidens’’ before adding 
that China should also ‘‘start an inves-
tigation into the Bidens.’’ 
President Trump’s own politically 
appointed Ambassador to the European 
Union, Gordon Sondland, explicitly tes-
tified that the meeting and the assist-
ance were conditioned on announcing— 
announcing—the investigations. 
The President’s defense lawyers first 
insisted on this floor that he ‘‘did abso-
lutely nothing wrong.’’ But later, after 
even Republican Senators would not 
make that claim, the new justification 
for his misconduct was ‘‘corruption’’ 
and ‘‘burden-sharing.’’ 
If the President were so concerned 
about corruption in Ukraine, why did 
he dismiss one of our best corruption- 
fighting 
diplomats, 
Marie 
Yovanovitch? In May, the Department 
of Defense also certified—certified— 
that Ukraine had taken ‘‘substantial 
actions’’ to decrease corruption. 
If there were legitimate foreign pol-
icy concerns about corruption, the 
President would not have released aid 
to Ukraine without delay in 2017 and in 
2018, only to delay it in 2019, after Joe 
Biden announced his run for President. 
If there were legitimate foreign pol-
icy concerns, the President would not 
have been interested in pursuing inves-
tigations based on—as Dr. Fiona Hill 
testified—a ‘‘fictional narrative that is 
being perpetrated and propagated by 
the Russian security services’’ to raise 
doubts about Russia’s own culpability 
in the 2016 election interference and to 
harm the relationship between the 
United States and Ukraine. 
Furthermore, the President’s defense 
team would have us believe that he le-
gitimately asserted executive privilege 
over the House’s well-founded impeach-
ment inquiry, despite the fact that he 
never actually asserted a privilege over 
a single document or witness. Rather, 
he issued a blanket directive in which

February 4, 2020 
he refused to cooperate entirely with 
the House investigation. This action 
not only obstructed the House’s con-
stitutional responsibility of oversight, 
it also sought to cover up the Presi-
dent’s corrupt abuse of power. 
At the time of the drafting of the 
Constitution, 
the 
Framers’ 
under-
standing of ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’ was informed by centuries 
of English legal precedent. This under-
standing was reflected in the language 
of Federalist No. 65 that I referred to 
earlier regarding ‘‘an abuse or viola-
tion of some public trust.’’ Based on 
this history, both Chambers of Con-
gress have consistently interpreted 
‘‘high 
Crimes 
and 
Misdemeanors’’ 
broadly to mean ‘‘serious violations of 
the public trust.’’ 
The President’s defense lawyers ar-
gued that impeachment requires the 
violation of a criminal statute to be 
constitutionally valid. This argument 
is offensive, dangerous, and not sup-
ported by historical precedent, credible 
scholarship, or common sense about 
the sacred notion of the public trust. 
When 
applying 
the 
impeachment 
standard of an ‘‘abuse or violation of 
some public trust,’’ it is clear that 
President Trump’s conduct exceeded 
that standard. Any effort to corrupt 
our next election must be met with 
swift accountability, as provided for in 
the impeachment clause in the Con-
stitution. There is no other remedy to 
constrain a President who has acted 
time and again to advance his personal 
interests over those of the Nation. 
Furthermore, 
as 
demonstrated 
through Special Counsel Mueller’s re-
port regarding Russian interference in 
the 2016 election and the substantial 
evidence presented in this impeach-
ment trial and the House proceedings, 
President Trump has engaged in ongo-
ing efforts to solicit foreign inter-
ference in our elections. 
As the Washington Post reported on 
September the 21st in a story written 
by three reporters who have covered 
the President for several years, the 
President’s conduct on the Ukraine 
phone call revealed a ‘‘President con-
vinced of his own invincibility—appar-
ently willing and even eager to wield 
the vast powers of the United States to 
taint a political foe and confident that 
no one could hold him back.’’ 
This President will abuse his power 
again. 
At the outset of this trial and 
throughout the proceedings, Senate 
Democrats and 75 percent of the Amer-
ican people have repeatedly called for 
relevant witnesses and relevant docu-
ments to be subpoenaed to ensure a full 
and fair trial for all parties. For exam-
ple, we sought testimony from former 
National 
Security 
Advisor 
John 
Bolton, whose unpublished manuscript 
indicates that the President explicitly 
told Bolton that he wanted to continue 
the delay in military assistance to 
Ukraine until it announced the polit-
ical investigations he was seeking. 
Fifty-one Senate Republicans refused 
to examine this or other relevant evi-
dence, thereby rigging this trial to the 
benefit of the President. Fair trials 
have witnesses and documents. Cover-
ups have neither. 
This is the third Presidential im-
peachment trial in our country’s his-
tory, and it is the only one—the only 
one—to be conducted without calling a 
single witness. In fact, every completed 
impeachment trial in history has in-
cluded new witnesses who were not 
even interviewed in the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Senate 
Republicans 
slammed the door shut on relevant tes-
timony, contrary to the national inter-
est. 
Our Founders had the foresight to en-
sure that the power of the President 
was not unlimited and that Congress 
could, if necessary, hold the Executive 
accountable 
for 
abuses 
of 
power 
through the impeachment process. This 
trial is not simply about grave Presi-
dential abuse of power; it is about our 
democracy, the sanctity of our elec-
tions, and the very values that the 
Founders agreed should guide our Na-
tion. 
I go back to the beginning and that 
inscription: ‘‘All public service is a 
trust, given in faith and accepted in 
honor.’’ President Trump dishonored 
that public trust and thereby abused 
his power for personal political gain. In 
order to prevent continuing inter-
ference in our upcoming election and 
blatant obstruction of Congress, I will 
vote guilty on both articles. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to address the topic that has 
consumed this body for the past several 
weeks, which is, of course, the im-
peachment trial of the President of the 
United States. 
After the passage of two Impeach-
ment Articles in the House, Speaker 
PELOSI waited nearly a month to trans-
mit the articles to the Senate. Once 
she finally did, the trial took prece-
dence, and the wheels were set in mo-
tion to conduct the proceedings and 
render a verdict. 
Since it became clear that the House 
would vote to impeach the President, I 
have taken my constitutional duty to 
serve as a juror in the impeachment 
trial with the seriousness and atten-
tion that it demands. 
In light of the extensive coverage the 
situation received, it was impossible 
not to take notice of the process that 
unfolded in the House over the course 
of its investigation. Its inquiry was 
hasty, flawed, and clearly undertaken 
under partisan pretenses. 
Having rushed to impeach the Presi-
dent ahead of an arbitrary deadline, as 
well as failing to provide adequate op-
portunities for the President to defend 
himself, the impeachment investiga-
tion in this case specifically was con-
trived, at least partially, and was a ve-
hicle to fulfill the fierce desire among 
many of the President’s detractors 
that has existed since before he was 
even sworn in to remove him from of-
fice. 
Be that as it may, the Constitution 
makes clear that the Senate has a duty 
to try all the impeachments. As such, 
the chief concern I had, as I know 
many of my colleagues also shared, was 
for the process in this body to be fair. 
It was clear to me that what transpired 
in the House was incredibly partisan 
and unfair. 
I believed the Senate must and would 
rise to the occasion to conduct a trial 
that was fair, respectful, and faithful 
to the design and intent of our Found-
ers. I believed that the organizing reso-
lution that we passed was sufficient in 
establishing a framework for the trial 
and also would address the outstanding 
issues at the appropriate times. 
Throughout the course of the trial, I 
stayed attentive and engaged, taking 
in the arguments and the evidence pre-
sented to the Senate, which included 
the testimony of over a dozen wit-
nesses and thousands of documents as 
part of the House investigation. 
The House impeachment managers 
were emphatic that their case against 
the 
President 
was 
overwhelming, 
uncontested, convincing, and proven. 
The President’s counsel made an equal-
ly forceful case in his defense, coun-
tering the claims made by the House 
and underscoring the grounds on which 
the Senate should reject the articles 
and, by necessity, the attempt to expel 
him from office and a future ballot. 
Based on the work done by the 
House—or maybe, more accurately, the 
work not done and the inherently 
flawed and partisan nature of the prod-
uct it presented to the Senate—I was 
skeptical that it could prove its case 
and convince anybody, apart from the 
President’s longtime, most severe crit-
ics, that his behavior merited removal 
from office. After 2 weeks of pro-
ceedings in the Senate, my assessment 
of the situation has not been swayed, 
nor has it changed. That is why I will 
vote to acquit the President and reject 
the weaponization of Congress’s au-
thority to impeach the duly elected 
President of the United States. 
To be clear, the partisan nature of 
this impeachment process potentially 
sets the stage for more impeachments 
along strictly partisan lines—a devel-
opment that would be terrible for our 
country. The Constitution lays out jus-
tifications for impeachment, which in-
clude ‘‘Treason, Bribery, or other high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ 
As a U.S. Senator, there is perhaps 
no more important decision that I am 
asked to make aside from voting to 
send Americans to war. That is exactly 
why I treated this impeachment trial 
with the gravity and the thoughtful-
ness I believe that it deserved. 
The accusations explicitly made by 
the House impeachment managers and 
echoed by some on the other side that 
the Senate is engaging in a coverup are 
wrong on the merits and further drag 
this process down into the rhetoric of

partisan political warfare. I regret that 
it has descended to such a place. Ful-
filling my constitutional obligation 
after drawing my own conclusions is 
far from a coverup. 
The attempt to turn the impeach-
ment power into a weapon of political 
convenience will be far more damaging 
than any other aspect of this chapter 
in our Nation’s history. 
At the end of the day, this partisan, 
deficient process yielded a product 
built on inadequate foundation, in ad-
dition to being clearly motivated by 
the desire to remove the President, 
who some vocal activists have viewed 
as illegitimate since Election Day 2016. 
Not even a year ago, Speaker PELOSI 
was still attempting to stem the push 
for impeachment within her own party, 
arguing that ‘‘impeachment is so divi-
sive to the country that unless there’s 
something so compelling and over-
whelming and bipartisan, I don’t think 
we should go down that path.’’ She was 
right, and this impeachment process 
has failed by each of these metrics. It 
has further divided the country. 
The case is certainly not over-
whelming, and it has been anything 
but bipartisan. In fact, the vote against 
impeaching the President in the House 
was bipartisan. As a result of Senate 
rules 
and 
precedents, 
it 
has 
also 
brought the legislative process nearly 
to a grinding halt. 
But as the trial reaches its conclu-
sion, I believe we must move on and re-
turn to doing the work of trying to get 
things done for the American people. 
The average Arkansan, like many 
other Americans, is looking for results 
and asking how the elected leaders 
they have chosen are trying to help 
make their lives better and move our 
country forward. They are not inter-
ested in the political games and the-
ater that have consumed much of 
Washington since September. It is my 
hope that we return to that real, press-
ing work in short order. 
In just a few months, the voters of 
this country will get to decide who 
they prefer to lead our country. I trust 
them to make that decision, and I 
trust that the process by which we 
choose our President and other leaders 
will remain free and fair and that the 
outcome will represent the will of the 
people. The hard-working men and 
women of our intelligence, law enforce-
ment, and national security commu-
nities will continue to work tirelessly 
to ensure that this is the case, and I 
have every confidence they will suc-
ceed in that endeavor. 
It is time to get back to the impor-
tant work before us and to remember 
that those we represent are capable of 
judging for themselves how this im-
peachment was conducted and, maybe 
just as importantly, how we conducted 
ourselves as it unfolded. 
We have a responsibility to lead by 
example. I implore my colleagues to 
join me in committing to getting back 
to doing the hard and necessary work 
before us when this impeachment trial 
reaches its conclusion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we 
are in our third week of the impeach-
ment trial right now. After thousands 
of documents being reviewed and over a 
dozen witnesses that we have heard, 
well over 100 video testimony clips that 
we have gone through, we are nearing 
the end. 
The country is deeply divided on 
multiple issues right now, and the im-
peachment trial is both a symptom of 
our times and another example of our 
division. 
The Nation didn’t have an impeach-
ment inquiry for almost 100 years, 
until 1868, the partisan impeachment of 
Andrew Johnson. 
Another impeachment wasn’t con-
ducted for over 100 years after that, 
when the House began a formal im-
peachment 
inquiry 
into 
President 
Nixon with an overwhelmingly bipar-
tisan vote of 410 to 4. 
Just a little over two decades later, 
there was another partisan impeach-
ment process—President Clinton, when 
he 
was 
impeached 
on 
an 
almost 
straight partisan vote. 
Tomorrow I will join many others to 
vote to acquit the President of the 
United States. His actions certainly do 
not rise to the level of removal from 
office. This is clearly another one of 
our partisan impeachments, now the 
third in our history. 
Over the past 3 years, the House of 
Representatives has voted four times 
to open an impeachment inquiry: once 
in 2017, once in 2018, and twice in 2019. 
Only the second vote in 2019 actually 
passed and turned into an actual im-
peachment inquiry. 
For 4 months the country has been 
consumed with impeachment hearings 
and investigations. First, rumors of 
issues with Ukraine arose on August 28, 
when POLITICO wrote a story about 
U.S. aid being slow-walked for Ukraine, 
and then September 18, when the Wash-
ington Post released a story about a 
whistleblower 
report 
that 
claimed 
President 
Trump 
pressured 
an 
unnamed foreign head of state to do an 
investigation for his campaign. 
Within days of the Washington Post 
story, before the whistleblower report 
came out, before anything was known, 
Speaker PELOSI announced the House 
would begin hearings to impeach the 
President, which led to a formal House 
vote to open an impeachment inquiry 
on October 31 and a formal vote to im-
peach the President on December 18. 
The House sent over two Articles of 
Impeachment, asking the Senate to de-
cide if the President should be removed 
from office and barred from running for 
any future office in the United States— 
one on abuse of power; the second on 
obstruction of Congress. Let me take 
those two in order. 
The abuse of power argument hinges 
on two things: Did the President of the 
United States use official funds to 
compel the Ukrainian Government to 
investigate Joe Biden’s son and his 
work for the corrupt natural gas com-
pany in Ukraine, Burisma, and did the 
President withhold a meeting with 
President Zelensky until President 
Zelensky agreed to investigate Joe 
Biden’s son? 
To be clear, the theory of the funds 
being withheld from Ukraine in ex-
change for an investigation doesn’t 
originate from that now-infamous July 
25 call. There is nothing in the text of 
the call that threatens the withholding 
of funds for an investigation. The the-
ory originates from the belief of Am-
bassador to the European Union Gor-
don Sondland’s—what he said—pre-
sumption—and he repeated that over 
and over again—presumption that the 
aid must have been held because of the 
President’s desire to get the Biden in-
vestigation done, since the President’s 
attorney—his private attorney—Rudy 
Giuliani was working to find out more 
about the Biden investigation and 
Burisma. 
Ambassador Sondland told multiple 
people about his theory. When he actu-
ally called President Trump and asked 
him directly about it, the President re-
sponded that there wasn’t any quid pro 
quo. He just said he wanted the Presi-
dent of Ukraine to do what he ran on 
and to do the right thing. 
Interestingly enough, that is the 
same thing that President Zelensky 
said and his Defense Minister said and 
his chief of staff said. The aid was held 
because there was legitimate concern 
about the transition of a brand-new 
President in Ukraine and his adminis-
tration in the early days of his Presi-
dency. An unknown on a world stage 
was elected, President Zelensky, on 
April 21. His swearing-in date was May 
21. During his swearing-in, he also 
abolished Parliament and called for 
snap elections. No one knew what he 
was going to do or what was going to 
happen. 
Those elections happened July 21 in 
Ukraine, where an overwhelming num-
ber of President Zelensky’s party won 
in Parliament. There was an amazing 
transition in a relatively short period 
of time in Ukraine and there were a lot 
of questions. 
I will tell you, I was in Ukraine in 
late May of 2019, and our State Depart-
ment officials there certainly had ques-
tions on the ground about the rapid 
transition 
that 
was 
happening 
in 
Ukraine. It was entirely reasonable for 
there to be able to be a pause in that 
time period. Those concerns were re-
solved in August and early September 
when the new Parliament started pass-
ing anti-corruption laws, and Vice 
President PENCE sat down face-to-face 
with President Zelensky on September 
1 in Poland to discuss the progress and 
corruption and their progress on get-
ting other nations to help supply more 
aid to Ukraine. 
As for the meeting with the Presi-
dent being withheld, as I just men-
tioned, the Vice President of the 
United States met with President

February 4, 2020 
Zelensky on September 1. That meet-
ing was originally scheduled to be with 
the President of the United States and 
all the planning had gone into it, and 
there was documentation for that. 
There was a meeting happening be-
tween President Zelensky, which was 
actually the place and date that he 
asked for to meet with President 
Trump, except in the final moments of 
that and the final days leading up to it, 
Hurricane 
Dorian 
approached 
the 
United States and that meeting had to 
be called off by the President while he 
stayed here, so the Vice President went 
in his stead. 
There was no quid pro quo in a meet-
ing. The meeting that was requested 
actually occurred. It was interesting to 
note, as well, when I researched the 
record about the aid dates for Ukraine 
in the past 3 years, I found out that, in 
2019, the aid arrived in September. It is 
interesting, from 2016 to 2018, the vast 
majority of military aid for each of 
those years—2016, 2017, and 2018—also 
went to Ukraine in September. 
Well, it is easy to create an intricate 
story about the hold of foreign aid. It 
is also clear that President Trump has 
held foreign aid from multiple coun-
tries over the last 2 years, including 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Honduras, Gua-
temala, El Salvador, Lebanon, and oth-
ers. There is no question that a Presi-
dent can withhold aid for a short pe-
riod of time, but it has to be released 
by September 30, which it was to 
Ukraine on time. 
The hold did occur. There are mes-
sages back and forth about being able 
to hold, but it is entirely reasonable to 
have the hold, and it was such a short 
period of time—the aid arrived at the 
same time as it usually did each of the 
past 3 years—that the Minister of De-
fense for Ukraine actually stated that 
the hold was so short, they didn’t even 
know it. 
What is interesting about this is this 
is stretched from not just an ‘‘abuse of 
power,’’ but also ‘‘obstruction of Con-
gress.’’ That is the second Article of 
Impeachment. The House argument 
was that the President didn’t turn over 
every document and allow every wit-
ness without submitting everything to 
Congress immediately. They argued 
that, if the President challenged any 
subpoena, he was stalling, he was act-
ing guilty, and so it was grounds for 
impeachment. 
Remember how fast this all hap-
pened. The investigation started Sep-
tember 24. The official start of im-
peachment started October 31 and 
ended on December 18, with a partisan 
vote in the House for impeachment. If 
President Trump obstructed Congress 
because he didn’t turn over documents 
that didn’t even have a legal subpoena 
within 2 months, then I would say 
President Obama was not impeached, 
but maybe he should have been, though 
I don’t think he should have been. 
But you could argue in that same 
way because President Obama did not 
honor three subpoenas in 3 years on the 
Fast and Furious investigation when 
that happened. For 3 years, he stalled 
out, but there was no consideration for 
impeaching President Obama because 
he shouldn’t have been impeached. He 
was working through the court system 
as things moved. 
This was a serious issue that became 
even more serious when the House 
managers moved, not just to say that 
this is obstruction of Congress if the 
President doesn’t immediately submit, 
but they took this to a different level 
by saying the President should not 
have access to the courts at all, lit-
erally stating: Does the Constitution 
give the legislative branch the power 
to block the executive branch from the 
judicial branch? 
House managers said, yes, they can 
rapidly move through a trial, then 
bring the case to the Senate and have 
it only partially investigated and then 
try to use the power of the Senate to 
block the executive branch from ever 
going to court to resolve any issue. 
That has not been done in the past, nor 
should it be. The President, like every 
other citizen of the United States, 
should have access to the courts, and it 
is not grounds for contempt of Con-
gress to block the President from ever 
trying to go to court to resolve issues 
that need to be resolved. Every other 
President has had that right. This one 
should have had that right as well. 
This 
tale 
that 
President 
Trump 
thinks he is a King and doesn’t want to 
follow the law begs reality. Let me re-
mind everyone of the Mueller inves-
tigation, where 2,800 subpoenas were 
done in over 21⁄2 years, with 500 wit-
nesses, including many of the Presi-
dent’s inner circle. All of those were 
provided. None of those were blocked 
by the administration. 
After 21⁄2 years, the final conclusion 
was there was no conspiracy between 
the President’s campaign and the Rus-
sians. The President did honor those 
subpoenas. The President has been very 
clear in multiple court cases that he 
did not like it and he did not agree 
with it. He has been outspoken on 
those, but he has honored each court 
decision. It would be a terrible prece-
dent for the Senate to remove a Presi-
dent from office because he didn’t 
agree that Congress couldn’t take away 
his rights in court like every other 
American. 
The difficulty in this process, as with 
every impeachment process, is sepa-
rating facts and the politics of it. 
There are facts in this case that we 
took a lot of time to go through. Each 
of us in this body sat for hour upon 
hour upon hour, for 21⁄2 weeks, listening 
to testimony and going through the 
record. We all spent lots of time being 
able to read, on our own, the facts and 
details. That was entirely reasonable 
to be able to do. 
But we have to examine, at the end 
of the day, what is a fact-based issue 
that has been answered—and each of 
the key facts raised by the House all 
have answers—and what is a politics 
issue—to say in an election year, what 
is being presented by the House that 
says: What can we do to slow down this 
process and to try to give the President 
a bad name during the middle of an 
election time period? To separate out 
those two is not a simple process. 
But we begin with the most basic ele-
ment. Do the facts line up with the ac-
cusations made by the House? They do 
not. Are there plenty of accusations? 
Yes, there are. My fear is that, in the 
days ahead, there will be more and 
more accusations as we go. There have 
been for the last 3 years. 
But at this moment and the facts at 
this time, in the partisan rancor from 
the House and into the Senate, I am 
going to choose to acquit the President 
of the United States. This certainly 
does not rise to the level of removal 
from office and forbidding him to run 
for any other office in the future. It 
certainly doesn’t rise to that level. 
In the days ahead, as more facts 
come out, all of history will be able to 
see how this occurred and the details of 
what happens next. I look forward, ac-
tually, for that to continue to be able 
to come out so all can be known. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I would 
like to share my remarks, not only 
with my colleagues today, but more so 
with those who will come after us. I 
want to touch on four issues: the trial 
evidence; the President’s actions as 
outlined in articles I and II of the Arti-
cles of Impeachment; and finally, and 
most importantly in my mind, the im-
plications of our decision this week on 
the future of our government and our 
country. 
First, the trial—weeks ago, I joined 
my colleagues in swearing an oath to 
‘‘do impartial justice.’’ Since that 
time, I have done everything possible 
to fulfill that responsibility. I paid full 
attention, taken three legal pads’ 
worth of notes, reviewed press ac-
counts, and had conversations with my 
colleagues and citizens in my home 
State of Maine. 
The one question I got most fre-
quently back home was how we could 
proceed without calling relevant wit-
nesses and securing the documents 
that would confirm or deny the charges 
against the President, which are at the 
heart of this matter. 
But for the first time in American 
history, we failed to do so. We robbed 
ourselves and the American people of a 
full record of this President’s misuse of 
his office. This failure stains this insti-
tution, undermines tomorrow’s verdict, 
and creates a precedent that will haunt 
those who come after us and, indeed, 
will haunt the country. But now, we 
are here, left to make this decision 
without the facts, concealed by the 
White House and left concealed by the 
votes of this body last Friday. 
This was not a trial in any real sense. 
It was, instead, an argument based 
upon a partial, but still damning,

February 4, 2020 
record. How much better it could have 
been had we had access to all the facts, 
facts which will eventually come out, 
but too late to inform our decisions? 
As to the articles themselves, I 
should begin by saying I have always 
been a conservative on the subject of 
impeachment. For the better part of 
the last 3 years, I have argued both 
publicly and privately against the idea. 
Impeachment should not be a tool to 
remove a President on the basis of pol-
icy 
disagreements. 
The 
President’s 
lawyers are right when they argue that 
this would change our system of gov-
ernment and dangerously weaken any 
President. 
But this reluctance must give way if 
it requires my turning a blind eye to 
what 
happened 
last 
summer. 
The 
events of last summer were no policy 
disagreement. They were a deliberate 
series of acts whereby the President 
sought to use the power of his office in 
his own personal and political inter-
ests, specifically by pressuring a gov-
ernment of a strategic partner—a part-
ner, by the way, significantly depend-
ent upon our moral and financial sup-
port—pressuring that government to 
take action against one of the Presi-
dent’s political rivals and, thereby, un-
dermine the integrity of the coming 
American election. 
This last point is important. In nor-
mal circumstances, the argument of 
the President’s defenders that im-
peachment is not necessary because 
the election is less than a year away 
would be persuasive. I could under-
stand that. But the President, in this 
matter, was attempting to undermine 
that very election, and he gives every 
indication that he will continue to do 
so. 
He has expressed no understanding 
that he did anything wrong, let alone 
anything reassembling remorse. Im-
peachment is not a punishment; it is a 
prevention. The only way, unfortu-
nately, to keep an unrepentant Presi-
dent from repeating his wrongful ac-
tions is removal. This President has 
made it plain that he will listen to 
nothing else. 
Article I charges a clear abuse of 
power, inviting foreign interference in 
the upcoming election. The President 
tasked his personal attorney to work 
with a foreign head of state to induce 
an investigation—or just the mere an-
nouncement of an investigation—that 
could harm one of the President’s top 
political rivals. 
And to compel the Ukrainians to do 
so, he unilaterally withheld nearly $400 
million appropriated by Congress to 
help them fend off Russia’s naked and 
relentless aggression. The President’s 
backers claim that this was done in an 
effort to root out corruption. So why 
not use official channels? Why did he 
focus on no examples of corruption 
generally other than ones directly af-
fecting his political fortunes? And why 
did he not make public the withholding 
of funds, as the executive branch typi-
cally does, when seeking to leverage 
Federal moneys for policy goals? 
No matter how many times the 
President claims his phone call with 
President Zelensky was perfect, it sim-
ply wasn’t. He clearly solicited foreign 
interference in our elections. He dis-
regarded a congressionally passed law. 
He impaired the security of a key 
American partner. He undermined our 
own national security. And, if he was 
simply pursuing our national interests 
rather than his own, why was his per-
sonal attorney Rudy Giuliani put in 
charge? Why was Rudy Giuliani men-
tioned in that phone call? 
Put bluntly, no matter the defense, 
and as a majority of the Members of 
this body apparently now recognize, 
President Trump placed his own polit-
ical interests above the national inter-
ests he is sworn to protect. And, as I 
mentioned, he has shown no sign that 
he will stop doing so when the next oc-
casion arises, as it surely will. 
The implications of acquitting the 
President on article I are serious. This 
President will likely do it again, and 
future Presidents will be unbound from 
any restraints on the use of the world’s 
most powerful political office for their 
own personal political gain. 
We are moving dangerously close to 
an elected Monarch—the very thing the 
Framers feared most. 
Article II, to me, is even more seri-
ous in its long-term implications. Arti-
cle I concerns an incident—an egre-
gious misuse of power, to be sure, but a 
specific set of actions in time. A 
scheme is probably the most appro-
priate description, which took place 
over the course of the past year. 
Article II, however, which concerns 
the President’s wholesale obstruction 
of the impeachment process itself, goes 
to the heart of Congress’s constitu-
tionally derived power to investigate 
wrongdoing by this or any future Presi-
dent. 
I do not arrive at this conclusion 
lightly. I take seriously the White 
House counsel’s argument that there is 
a legitimate separation of powers issue 
here, that executive privilege is real— 
although I have to note it was never 
actually asserted in this case, but that 
executive privilege is real—and that 
there must be limits on Congress’s 
ability to intrude upon the executive 
function. 
But in this case, despite counsel’s 
questions about which authorizing res-
olution passed when or whether the 
House should have more vigorously 
pursued judicial remedies, the record is 
clear and is summarized in the White 
House letter to the House in early Oc-
tober—that the President and his ad-
ministration ‘‘cannot participate’’ in 
the impeachment process—cannot par-
ticipate. 
To me, it is this ongoing blanket re-
fusal to cooperate in any way—no wit-
nesses, no documents, no evidence of 
any kind—that undermines the asser-
tion that a categorical refusal, with 
overt witness intimidation thrown in, 
was based upon any legitimate, nar-
rowly tailored legal or constitutional 
privilege. 
No prior President has ever taken 
such a position, and the argument that 
this blanket obstruction should be 
tested in court is severely undercut by 
the administration’s recent argument 
that the courts have no jurisdiction 
over such disputes and that the remedy 
for 
stonewalling 
Congress 
is—you 
guessed it—impeachment. They argued 
that in the Federal court in Wash-
ington this week. 
Interestingly, the first assertion of 
executive privilege was by George 
Washington, when the House sought 
background documents on the Jay 
Treaty. Washington rested his refusal 
to produce those documents on the idea 
that the House had no jurisdiction over 
matters of foreign policy, but, interest-
ingly, Washington, in his message to 
Congress, did specify one instance 
where the House would have a legiti-
mate claim on the documents’ release. 
What was the instance? You guessed 
it—impeachment. 
If allowed to stand, this position that 
the President—any President—can use 
his or her position to totally obstruct 
the production of evidence of their own 
wrongdoing eviscerates the impeach-
ment power entirely, and it com-
promises the ongoing authority of Con-
gress to provide any meaningful over-
sight of the executive whatsoever. 
For these and other reasons, I will 
vote guilty on both Articles of Im-
peachment. 
A final point, the Congress has been 
committing slow-motion institutional 
suicide for the past 70 years, abdicating 
its constitutional authorities and re-
sponsibilities one by one: the war 
power, effectively in the hands of the 
President since 1942; authority over 
trade with other countries, superceded 
by unilateral Presidentially imposed 
tariffs on friends and foes alike; and 
even the power of the purse, which a 
supine Congress ceded to the President 
last year, enabling him to rewrite our 
duly passed appropriations bill to sub-
stitute his priorities for ours. And now 
this. 
The structure of our Constitution is 
based upon the bedrock principle that 
the concentration of power is dan-
gerous, that power divided and shared 
is the best long-term assurance of lib-
erty. To the extent we compromise 
that principle, give up powers the 
Framers bestowed upon us, and acqui-
esce to the growth of an imperial Presi-
dency, we are failing. We are failing 
our oaths, we are failing our most fun-
damental responsibility, we are failing 
the American people. 
History may record this week as a 
turning point in the American experi-
ment—the day that we stepped away 
from the Framers’ vision, enabled a 
new and unbounded Presidency, and 
made ourselves observers rather than 
full participants in the shaping of our 
country’s future. 
I sincerely hope I am wrong in all of 
this, but I deeply fear that I am right. 
I yield the floor.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO ALICE PRIESTER 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, it 
is my distinct honor to recognize a be-
loved member of my hometown of 
Farmington, WV, as well as a very dear 
lifelong friend to me and my family: 
Alice Priester, who celebrated her 
100th birthday on February 2, 2020. 
Particularly what comes to mind 
when I think of Alice is our bond with 
the coal miners of our great State. She 
and I have both lost loved ones to acci-
dents in the coal mines. Every day, as 
I fight for these brave souls who per-
form this dangerous work, I am also 
thinking of the family members like 
Alice, who also depend on safety stand-
ards, fair wages, and precautions. She 
and her late husband Paul have one 
son, Fred, who is also involved in the 
coal industry. I carry this heritage 
with me no matter where I am but es-
pecially when I am in Washington. 
The women in my life who raised me 
are the most important people in the 
world to me. Even those not related by 
blood are considered as good as family 
in tight-knit communities like Farm-
ington, and Alice is an inspiration to 
me and so many others. Having de-
feated cancer twice, Alice is one of the 
strongest, most inspirational people I 
have ever had the pleasure of calling a 
dear friend. When she is not cheering 
on the WVU Mountaineers, Alice is 
very involved with our church, helping 
with funeral dinners and driving her 
neighbors and friends to town and 
church functions. She also has had a 
history of involvement with the volun-
teer fire department and fundraising, 
and she treats her neighbors as family. 
From her days working at the local 
mine’s company store to her retire-
ment from the dining hall at Fairmont 
State University, Alice has showcased 
an unparalleled work ethic and zest for 
life that truly represents the very best 
of what it means to be a West Vir-
ginian. 
Alice while you weren’t born here, 
you certainly are a West Virginian in 
your heart and soul. In West Virginia, 
if you are hungry, you will be fed. If 
you are lost, someone will not only 
give you directions but will offer to 
drive you to your destination. I am so 
deeply proud of the people of my home 
State and the values that make us 
stand out from the rest of the Nation. 
Gayle and I are so deeply appreciative 
of your very dear friendship, your gen-
erosity to the Farmington community, 
and your warm, welcoming hospitality. 
Alice, as your family and friends 
honor you, please know that you have 
provided so much happiness and wis-
dom to the lives of those around you 
throughout the years. It is my wish 
that the memory of your special 100th 
birthday remains with you just as your 
guidance and influence will remain in 
all the lives you have touched. Again, 
it is with the greatest admiration that 
I send to you my best wishes.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MATTIE FLORENCE 
JONES 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I want 
to 
recognize 
Ms. 
Mattie 
Florence 
Jones, recipient of the 2020 Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Freedom Award, for 
her lifetime of commitment to the 
dream of equality so beautifully ar-
ticulated by Dr. King. Her tireless civil 
rights advocacy is surpassed only by 
her loving commitment to her family, 
including the dozens of foster children 
who were welcomed into her Louisville 
household. Her legacy of activism and 
service are unparalleled and worthy of 
this special distinction.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING SUN HARVEST 
CITRUS 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I honor a small business 
that demonstrates America’s unique 
entrepreneurial spirit. I am pleased to 
recognize a business that has been a 
notable member of their local commu-
nity for nearly 30 years. Today, it is 
my pleasure to name Sun Harvest Cit-
rus of Fort Myers, FL, as the Senate 
Small Business of the Week. 
Founded in 1990 by Sandy McKenzie 
Nicely, Sun Harvest Citrus is known 
for their high-quality citrus products, 
which makes them a premiere Fort 
Myers destination. Their produce is 
sourced from citrus groves originally 
purchased by Sandy’s grandfather Rob-
ert Edsall, Sr., in 1940. The grove, lo-
cated along the east coast of Florida 
and consisting of approximately 800 
acres of land, has passed through her 
family for three generations and is now 
managed 
by 
her 
brother, 
David 
McKenzie. Sandy became inspired to 
open the Sun Harvest Citrus store in 
1990 when the Florida citrus industry 
dealt with overproduction. The store 
became a great way to sell the surplus 
citrus from the groves, while offering a 
location for customers to gather. Since 
1990, they have expanded their products 
to offer several different types of citrus 
produce, juices, candies, and sweets, as 
well as serve as a tourist attraction for 
the Fort Myers area. 
Today, Sun Harvest Citrus employs 
more than 25 Floridians and produces a 
diverse variety of orange and grape-
fruit products. The store sells seasonal 
citrus baskets and produces up to 2,500 
gallons of juice a day. One of their 
most popular products is the Orange 
Vanilla mix soft-serve ice cream that 
has become a well-known tourist stop 
for people traveling down the west 
coast of Florida. Many of their prod-
ucts are seasonal, such as Valencia or-
anges or Honeybell tangelos, with Sun 
Harvest Citrus providing each seasonal 
fruit and juice during the months they 
are produced. 
In addition to their store and citrus 
groves, Sun Harvest Citrus has become 
a centerpiece in the Fort Myers com-
munity. USA Today listed Sun Harvest 
Citrus as one of the 10 best places to 
shop in the Fort Myers area. Sun Har-
vest Citrus also distributes their juice 
to local businesses and community 
events. For example, in an effort to 
spread Christmas cheer, Sun Harvest 
Citrus provided their fresh orange juice 
to patients and families at a holiday 
event hosted by the local Fort Myers 
Kiwanis at the John Hopkins All Chil-
dren’s Outpatient Care center. 
Sun Harvest Citrus is an excellent 
example of a family run business that 
is making a positive impact in their 
community. I commend this Florida 
business for its dedication to providing 
great products to the community and 
creating a gathering place where all 
local residents and visitors are wel-
comed. I am proud to recognize every-
one at Sun Harvest Citrus, and I look 
forward to seeing their continued suc-
cess.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S851 
February 4, 2020 
report; which was ordered to lie on the 
table: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, 
Members of Congress, the First Lady of 
the United States, and my fellow citi-
zens: 
Three years ago, we launched the 
great American comeback. Tonight, I 
stand before you to share the incred-
ible results. Jobs are booming, incomes 
are soaring, poverty is plummeting, 
crime is falling, confidence is surging, 
and our country is thriving and highly 
respected again! America’s enemies are 
on the run, America’s fortunes are on 
the rise, and America’s future is blaz-
ing bright. 
The years of economic decay are 
over. The days of our country being 
used, taken advantage of, and even 
scorned by other nations are long be-
hind us. Gone too are the broken prom-
ises, jobless recoveries, tired plati-
tudes, and constant excuses for the de-
pletion of American wealth, power, and 
prestige. 
In just 3 short years, we have shat-
tered the mentality of American de-
cline, 
and 
we 
have 
rejected 
the 
downsizing of America’s destiny. We 
are moving forward at a pace that was 
unimaginable just a short time ago, 
and we are never going back! 
I am thrilled to report to you tonight 
that our economy is the best it has 
ever been. Our military is completely 
rebuilt, with its power being un-
matched anywhere in the world—and it 
is not even close. Our borders are se-
cure. Our families are flourishing. Our 
values are renewed. Our pride is re-
stored. And for all these reasons, I say 
to the people of our great country, and 
to the Members of Congress before me: 
The State of our Union is stronger than 
ever before! 
The vision I will lay out this evening 
demonstrates how we are building the 
world’s most prosperous and inclusive 
society—one where every citizen can 
join in America’s unparalleled success, 
and where every community can take 
part in America’s extraordinary rise. 
From the instant I took office, I 
moved rapidly to revive the United 
States 
economy—slashing 
a 
record 
number of jobkilling regulations, en-
acting historic and record-setting tax 
cuts, and fighting for fair and recip-
rocal trade agreements. Our agenda is 
relentlessly 
pro-worker, 
pro-family, 
pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-Amer-
ican. We are advancing with unbridled 
optimism and lifting high our citizens 
of every race, color, religion, and creed. 
Since my election, we have created 7 
million new jobs—5 million more than 
Government experts projected during 
the previous administration. 
The unemployment rate is the lowest 
in over half a century. 
Incredibly, the average unemploy-
ment rate under my Administration is 
lower than any administration in the 
history of our country. If we had not 
reversed the failed economic policies of 
the previous administration, the world 
would not now be witness to America’s 
great economic success. 
The unemployment rates for African- 
Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and 
Asian-Americans have reached the low-
est levels in history. African-American 
youth unemployment has reached an 
all-time low. 
African-American poverty has de-
clined to the lowest rate ever recorded. 
The unemployment rate for women 
reached the lowest level in almost 70 
years—and last year, women filled 72 
percent of all new jobs added. 
The veterans’ unemployment rate 
dropped to a record low. 
The unemployment rate for disabled 
Americans has reached an all-time low. 
Workers without a high school di-
ploma have achieved the lowest unem-
ployment 
rate 
recorded 
in 
United 
States history. 
A record number of young Americans 
are now employed. 
Under the last administration, more 
than 10 million people were added to 
the food stamp rolls. Under my Admin-
istration, 7 million Americans have 
come off of food stamps, and 10 million 
people have been lifted off of welfare. 
In 8 years under the last administra-
tion, over 300,000 working-age people 
dropped out of the workforce. In just 3 
years of my Administration, 3.5 million 
working-age people have joined the 
workforce. 
Since my election, the net worth of 
the bottom half of wage-earners has in-
creased by 47 percent—3 times faster 
than the increase for the top 1 percent. 
After decades of flat and falling in-
comes, wages are rising fast—and, won-
derfully, they are rising fastest for low- 
income workers, who have seen a 16 
percent pay-increase since my election. 
This is a blue collar boom. 
Real median household income is 
now at the highest level ever recorded! 
Since my election, United States 
stock markets have soared 70 percent, 
adding more than $12 trillion to our 
Nation’s 
wealth, 
transcending 
any-
thing anyone believed was possible— 
this, as other countries are not doing 
well. Consumer confidence has reached 
amazing new heights. 
All of those millions of people with 
40l(k)s and pensions are doing far bet-
ter than they have ever done before 
with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and even 
100 percent. 
Jobs and investment are pouring into 
9,000 
previously-neglected 
neighbor-
hoods thanks to Opportunity Zones, a 
plan spearheaded by Senator TIM SCOTT 
as part of our great Republican tax 
cuts. In other words, wealthy people 
and companies are pouring money into 
poor neighborhoods or areas that have 
not seen investment in many decades, 
creating jobs, energy, and excitement. 
This is the first time that these deserv-
ing communities have seen anything 
like this. It is all working! 
Opportunity Zones are helping Amer-
icans like Army Veteran Tony Rankins 
from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling 
with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, 
his house, and his family—he was 
homeless. But then Tony found a con-
struction company that invests in Op-
portunity Zones. He is now a top 
tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his 
family, and he is here tonight. Tony: 
Keep up the great work. 
Our roaring economy has, for the 
first time ever, given many former 
prisoners the ability to get a great job 
and a fresh start. This second chance 
at life is made possible because we 
passed landmark Criminal Justice Re-
form into law. Everybody said that 
Criminal Justice Reform could not be 
done, but I got it done, and the people 
in this room got it done. 
Thanks to our bold regulatory reduc-
tion campaign, the United States has 
become the number one producer of oil 
and natural gas in the world, by far. 
With the tremendous progress we have 
made over the past 3 years, America is 
now energy independent, and energy 
jobs, like so many elements of our 
country, are at a record high. We are 
doing numbers that no one would have 
thought possible just 3 years ago. 
Likewise, we are restoring our Na-
tion’s 
manufacturing 
might, 
even 
though predictions were that this could 
never be done. After losing 60,000 fac-
tories under the previous two adminis-
trations, America has now gained 12,000 
new factories under my Administration 
with thousands upon thousands of 
plants and factories being planned or 
built. We have created over half a mil-
lion new manufacturing jobs. Compa-
nies are not leaving; they are coming 
back. Everybody wants to be where the 
action is, and the United States of 
America is, indeed, where the action is. 
One of the single biggest promises I 
made to the American people was to re-
place the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. 
In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the sin-
gle biggest reason that I decided to run 
for 
President. 
Following 
NAFTA’s 
adoption, our Nation lost one in four 
manufacturing jobs. Many politicians 
came and went, pledging to change or 
replace NAFTA—only to do absolutely 
nothing. But unlike so many who came 
before me, I keep my promises. Six 
days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed 
the brand new United States-Mexico- 
Canada Agreement (USMCA) into law. 
The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 
new high-paying American auto jobs, 
and massively boost exports for our 
farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. 
It will also bring trade with Mexico 
and Canada to a much higher degree, 
but also to a much greater level of fair-
ness and reciprocity. This is the first 
major trade deal in many years to earn 
the strong backing of America’s labor 
unions. 
I also promised our citizens that I 
would impose tariffs to confront Chi-
na’s massive theft of American jobs. 
Our strategy worked. Days ago, we 
signed the groundbreaking new agree-
ment with China that will defend our 
workers, protect our intellectual prop-
erty, bring billions of dollars into our 
treasury, and open vast new markets

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S852 
February 4, 2020 
for products made and grown right here 
in the United States of America. For 
decades, China has taken advantage of 
the 
United 
States, 
now 
we 
have 
changed that but, at the same time, we 
have perhaps the best relationship we 
have ever had with China, including 
with President Xi. They respect what 
we have done because, quite frankly, 
they could never believe what they 
were able to get away with year after 
year, decade after decade, without 
someone in our country stepping up 
and saying: Enough. Now, we want to 
rebuild our country, and that is what 
we are doing. 
As we restore American leadership 
throughout the world, we are once 
again standing up for freedom in our 
hemisphere. That is why my Adminis-
tration reversed the failing policies of 
the previous administration on Cuba. 
We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, 
Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans to re-
store democracy. The United States is 
leading a 59-nation diplomatic coali-
tion against the socialist dictator of 
Venezuela, Nicola´s Maduro. Maduro is 
an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who bru-
talizes his people. But Maduro’s grip of 
tyranny will be smashed and broken. 
Here this evening is a man who carries 
with him the hopes, dreams, and aspi-
rations of all Venezuelans. Joining us 
in the gallery is the true and legiti-
mate President of Venezuela, Juan 
Guaido´. Mr. President, please take this 
message back to your homeland. All 
Americans are united with the Ven-
ezuelan people in their righteous strug-
gle for freedom! Socialism destroys na-
tions. But always remember, freedom 
unifies the soul. 
To safeguard American Liberty, we 
have invested a record-breaking $2.2 
trillion in the United States Military. 
We have purchased the finest planes, 
missiles, rockets, ships, and every 
other form of military equipment—all 
made in the United States of America. 
We are also finally getting our allies to 
help pay their fair share. I have raised 
contributions from the other NATO 
members by more than $400 billion, and 
the number of allies meeting their 
minimum obligations has more than 
doubled. 
And just weeks ago, for the first time 
since President Truman established the 
Air Force more than 70 years earlier, 
we created a new branch of the United 
States Armed Forces, the Space Force. 
In the gallery tonight, we have one of 
the Space Force’s youngest potential 
recruits: 13-year-old Iain Lanphier, an 
eighth grader from Arizona. Iain has 
always dreamed of going to space. He 
was first in his class and among the 
youngest at an aviation academy. He 
aspires to go to the Air Force Acad-
emy, and then, he has his eye on the 
Space Force. As Iain says, ‘‘most peo-
ple look up at space, I want to look 
down on the world.’’ 
Sitting beside Iain tonight is his 
great hero. Charles McGee was born in 
Cleveland, 
Ohio, 
one 
century 
ago. 
Charles is one of the last surviving 
Tuskegee 
Airmen—the 
first 
black 
fighter pilots—and he also happens to 
be Iain’s great-grandfather. After more 
than 130 combat missions in World War 
II, he came back to a country still 
struggling for Civil Rights and went on 
to serve America in Korea and Viet-
nam. On December 7th, Charles cele-
brated his 100th birthday. A few weeks 
ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles 
McGee to Brigadier General. And ear-
lier today, I pinned the stars on his 
shoulders in the Oval Office. General 
McGee: Our Nation salutes you. 
From the pilgrims to our Founders, 
from the soldiers at Valley Forge to 
the marchers at Selma, and from Presi-
dent Lincoln to the Reverend Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr., Americans have 
always rejected limits on our children’s 
future. 
Members of Congress, we must never 
forget that the only victories that mat-
ter in Washington are victories that 
deliver for the American people. The 
people are the heart of our country, 
their dreams are the soul of our coun-
try, and their love is what powers and 
sustains our country. We must always 
remember that our job is to put Amer-
ica first! 
The next step forward in building an 
inclusive society is making sure that 
every young American gets a great 
education 
and 
the 
opportunity 
to 
achieve the American Dream. Yet, for 
too long, countless American children 
have been trapped in failing govern-
ment schools. To rescue these students, 
18 States have created school choice in 
the form of Opportunity Scholarships. 
The programs are so popular, that tens 
of thousands of students remain on 
waiting lists. One of those students is 
Janiyah Davis, a fourth grader from 
Philadelphia. Janiyah’s mom Steph-
anie is a single parent. She would do 
anything to give her daughter a better 
future. But last year, that future was 
put further out of reach when Penn-
sylvania’s Governor vetoed legislation 
to expand school choice for 50,000 chil-
dren. 
Janiyah and Stephanie are in the gal-
lery this evening. But there is more to 
their story. Janiyah, I am pleased to 
inform you that your long wait is over. 
I can proudly announce tonight that an 
Opportunity Scholarship has become 
available, it is going to you, and you 
will soon be heading to the school of 
your choice! 
Now, I call on the Congress to give 1 
million American children the same 
opportunity Janiyah has just received. 
Pass the Education Freedom Scholar-
ships and Opportunity Act—because no 
parent should be forced to send their 
child to a failing government school. 
Every young person should have a 
safe and secure environment in which 
to learn and grow. For this reason, our 
magnificent First Lady has launched 
the ‘‘Be Best’’ initiative—to advance a 
safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free 
life for the next generation, online, in 
school, and in our communities. Thank 
you, Melania, for your extraordinary 
love and profound care for America’s 
children. 
My Administration is determined to 
give our citizens the opportunities they 
need regardless of age or background. 
Through our Pledge to American Work-
ers, over 400 companies will also pro-
vide new jobs and education opportuni-
ties to almost 15 million Americans. 
My Budget also contains an exciting 
vision for our Nation’s high schools. 
Tonight, I ask the Congress to support 
our students and back my plan to offer 
vocational and technical education in 
every single high school in America. 
To expand equal opportunity, I am 
also proud that we achieved record and 
permanent funding for our Nation’s 
Historically Black Colleges and Uni-
versities. 
A good life for American families 
also requires the most affordable, inno-
vative, and high-quality healthcare 
system on Earth. Before I took office, 
health insurance premiums had more 
than doubled in just 5 years. I moved 
quickly to provide affordable alter-
natives. Our new plans are up to 60 per-
cent less expensive. I have also made 
an ironclad pledge to American fami-
lies: We will always protect patients 
with pre-existing conditions—that is a 
guarantee. And we will always protect 
your Medicare and your Social Secu-
rity. 
The American patient should never 
be blindsided by medical bills. That is 
why I signed an Executive Order re-
quiring price transparency. Many ex-
perts believe that transparency, which 
will go into full effect at the beginning 
of next year, will be even bigger than 
healthcare reform. It will save families 
massive amounts of money for substan-
tially better care. 
But as we work to improve Ameri-
cans’ healthcare, there are those who 
want to take away your healthcare, 
take away your doctor, and abolish pri-
vate insurance entirely. One hundred 
thirty-two lawmakers in this room 
have endorsed legislation to impose a 
socialist takeover of our healthcare 
system, wiping out the private health 
insurance plans of 180 million Ameri-
cans. To those watching at home to-
night, I want you to know: We will 
never let socialism destroy American 
healthcare! 
Over 130 legislators in this chamber 
have endorsed legislation that would 
bankrupt our Nation by providing free 
taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions 
of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to 
subsidize free care for anyone in the 
world who unlawfully crosses our bor-
ders. These proposals would raid the 
Medicare benefits our seniors depend 
on, while acting as a powerful lure for 
illegal immigration. This is what is 
happening in California and other 
States—their systems are totally out 
of control, costing taxpayers vast and 
unaffordable amounts of money. If 
forcing American taxpayers to provide 
unlimited free healthcare to illegal 
aliens sounds fair to you, then stand 
with the radical left. But if you believe

that we should defend American pa-
tients and American seniors, then 
stand with me and pass legislation to 
prohibit free Government healthcare 
for illegal aliens! 
This will be a tremendous boon to 
our 
already 
very-strongly 
guarded 
southern border where, as we speak, a 
long, tall, and very powerful wall is 
being built. We have now completed 
over 100 miles and will have over 500 
miles fully completed by early next 
year. 
My Administration is also taking on 
the big pharmaceutical companies. We 
have approved a record number of af-
fordable generic drugs, and medicines 
are being approved by the FDA at a 
faster clip than ever before. I was 
pleased to announce last year that, for 
the first time in 51 years, the cost of 
prescription drugs actually went down. 
And working together, the Congress 
can reduce drug prices substantially 
from current levels. I have been speak-
ing to Senator CHUCK
GRASSLEY
of 
Iowa and others in the Congress in 
order to get something on drug pricing 
done, and done properly. I am calling 
for bipartisan legislation that achieves 
the goal of dramatically lowering pre-
scription drug prices. Get a bill to my 
desk, and I will sign it into law with-
out delay. 
With unyielding commitment, we are 
curbing 
the 
opioid 
epidemic—drug 
overdose deaths declined for the first 
time in nearly 30 years. Among the 
States hardest hit, Ohio is down 22 per-
cent, Pennsylvania is down 18 percent, 
Wisconsin is down 10 percent—and we 
will not quit until we have beaten the 
opioid epidemic once and for all. 
Protecting Americans’ health also 
means fighting infectious diseases. We 
are coordinating with the Chinese gov-
ernment and working closely together 
on the Coronavirus outbreak in China. 
My Administration will take all nec-
essary steps to safeguard citizens from 
this threat. 
We have launched ambitious new ini-
tiatives to substantially improve care 
for Americans with kidney disease, 
Alzheimer’s, and those struggling with 
mental health challenges. And because 
the Congress funded my request, we are 
pursuing new cures for childhood can-
cer, and we will eradicate the AIDS 
epidemic in America by the end of the 
decade. 
Almost 
every 
American 
family 
knows the pain when a loved one is di-
agnosed with a serious illness. Here to-
night is a special man, someone be-
loved by millions of Americans who 
just received a Stage 4 advanced cancer 
diagnosis. This is not good news, but 
what is good news is that he is the 
greatest fighter and winner that you 
will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh: Thank 
you for your decades of tireless devo-
tion to our country. Rush, in recogni-
tion of all that you have done for our 
Nation, the millions of people a day 
that you speak to and inspire, and all 
of the incredible work that you have 
done for charity, I am proud to an-
nounce tonight that you will be receiv-
ing 
our 
country’s 
highest 
civilian 
honor, the Presidential Medal of Free-
dom. I will now ask the First Lady of 
the United States to please stand and 
present you with the honor. Rush, 
Kathryn, congratulations! 
As we pray for all who are sick, we 
know 
that 
America 
is 
constantly 
achieving new medical breakthroughs. 
In 2017, doctors at St. Luke’s hospital 
in Kansas City delivered one of the ear-
liest premature babies ever to survive. 
Born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and 
weighing less than a pound, Ellie 
Schneider was born a fighter. Through 
the skill of her doctors—and the pray-
ers of her parents—little Ellie kept on 
winning the battle for life. Today, Ellie 
is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sit-
ting with her amazing mother Robin in 
the gallery. Ellie and Robin: We are so 
glad you are here. 
Ellie reminds us that every child is a 
miracle of life. Thanks to modern med-
ical wonders, 50 percent of very pre-
mature babies delivered at the hospital 
where Ellie was born now survive. Our 
goal should be to ensure that every 
baby has the best chance to thrive and 
grow just like Ellie. That is why I am 
asking the Congress to provide an addi-
tional $50 million to fund neo-natal re-
search for America’s youngest pa-
tients. That is also why I am calling 
upon the Members of Congress here to-
night to pass legislation finally ban-
ning the late-term abortion of babies. 
Whether we are Republican, Democrat, 
or Independent, surely we must all 
agree that every human life is a sacred 
gift from God! 
As we support America’s moms and 
dads, I was recently proud to sign the 
law providing new parents in the Fed-
eral workforce paid family leave, serv-
ing as a model for the rest of the coun-
try. Now, I call on the Congress to pass 
the bipartisan Advancing Support for 
Working Families Act, extending fam-
ily leave to mothers and fathers all 
across the Nation. 
Forty 
million 
American 
families 
have an average $2,200 extra thanks to 
our child tax credit. I have also over-
seen historic funding increases for 
high-quality 
childcare, 
enabling 
17 
States to serve more children, many of 
which have reduced or eliminated their 
waitlists altogether. And I sent the 
Congress a plan with a vision to fur-
ther expand access to high-quality 
childcare and urge you to act imme-
diately. 
To protect the environment, days 
ago, I announced that the United 
States will join the One Trillion Trees 
Initiative, an ambitious effort to bring 
together Government and the private 
sector to plant new trees in America 
and around the world. 
We must also rebuild America’s in-
frastructure. I ask you to pass Senator 
BARRASSO’s highway bill—to invest in 
new roads, bridges, and tunnels across 
our land. 
I am also committed to ensuring that 
every citizen can have access to high- 
speed internet, including rural Amer-
ica. 
A better tomorrow for all Americans 
also requires us to keep America safe. 
That means supporting the men and 
women of law enforcement at every 
level, including our Nation’s heroic ICE 
officers. 
Last year, our brave ICE officers ar-
rested 
more 
than 
120,000 
criminal 
aliens charged with nearly 10,000 bur-
glaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 vio-
lent assaults, and 2,000 murders. 
Tragically, there are many cities in 
America where radical politicians have 
chosen to provide sanctuary for these 
criminal illegal aliens. In Sanctuary 
Cities, local officials order police to re-
lease dangerous criminal aliens to prey 
upon the public, instead of handing 
them over to ICE to be safely removed. 
Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien 
freed by the Sanctuary City of New 
York was charged with the brutal rape 
and murder of a 92-year-old woman. 
The killer had been previously arrested 
for assault, but under New York’s sanc-
tuary policies, he was set free. If the 
city had honored ICE’s detainer re-
quest, his victim would be alive today. 
The State of California passed an 
outrageous law declaring their whole 
State to be a sanctuary for criminal il-
legal immigrants—with catastrophic 
results. 
Here is just one tragic example. In 
December 2018, California police de-
tained an illegal alien with five prior 
arrests, including convictions for rob-
bery and assault. But as required by 
California’s Sanctuary Law, local au-
thorities released him. 
Days later, the criminal alien went 
on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. 
He viciously shot one man going about 
his daily work; he approached a woman 
sitting in her car and shot her in the 
arm and the chest. He walked into a 
convenience store and wildly fired his 
weapon. He hijacked a truck and 
smashed into vehicles, critically injur-
ing innocent victims. One of the vic-
tims of his bloody rampage was a 51- 
year-old 
American 
named 
Rocky 
Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when 
this vile criminal fired eight bullets at 
him from close range, murdering him 
in cold blood. Rocky left behind a de-
voted family, including his brothers 
who loved him more than anything. 
One of his grieving brothers is here 
with us tonight. Jody, would you 
please stand? Jody, our hearts weep for 
your loss—and we will not rest until 
you have justice. 
Senator THOM TILLIS has introduced 
legislation to allow Americans like 
Jody to sue Sanctuary Cities and 
States when a loved one is hurt or 
killed as a result of these deadly poli-
cies. I ask the Congress to pass the 
Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities 
Act immediately. The United States of 
America should be a sanctuary for law- 
abiding 
Americans—not 
criminal 
aliens! 
In the last 3 years, ICE has arrested 
over 5,000 wicked human traffickers—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S854 
February 4, 2020 
and I have signed 9 pieces of legislation 
to stamp out the menace of human 
trafficking, domestically and around 
the globe. 
My Administration has undertaken 
an unprecedented effort to secure the 
southern border of the United States. 
Before I came into office, if you 
showed up illegally on our southern 
border and were arrested, you were 
simply released and allowed into our 
country, never to be seen again. My 
Administration has ended Catch-and- 
Release. If you come illegally, you will 
now be promptly removed. We entered 
into historic cooperation agreements 
with the Governments of Mexico, Hon-
duras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As 
a result of our unprecedented efforts, 
illegal crossings are down 75 percent 
since May—dropping 8 straight months 
in a row. And as the wall goes up, drug 
seizures rise, and border crossings go 
down. 
Last year, I traveled to the border in 
Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul 
Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent 
Ortiz and his team have seized more 
than 200,000 pounds of poisonous nar-
cotics, arrested more than 3,000 human 
smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 
migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was 
promoted to Deputy Chief of Border 
Patrol—and he joins us tonight. Chief 
Ortiz: Please stand—a grateful Nation 
thanks you and all the heroes of Border 
Patrol. 
To build on these historic gains, we 
are working on legislation to replace 
our outdated and randomized immigra-
tion system with one based on merit, 
welcoming those who follow the rules, 
contribute to our economy, support 
themselves financially, and uphold our 
values. 
With every action, my Administra-
tion is restoring the rule of law and re- 
asserting the culture of American free-
dom. Working with Senate Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL and his colleagues 
in the Senate, we have confirmed a 
record number of 187 new Federal 
judges to uphold our Constitution as 
written. This includes two brilliant 
new Supreme Court Justices, Neil 
Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh. 
My Administration is also defending 
religious liberty, and that includes the 
Constitutional right to pray in public 
schools. In America, we do not punish 
prayer. We do not tear down crosses. 
We do not ban symbols of faith. We do 
not muzzle preachers and pastors. In 
America, we celebrate faith. We cher-
ish religion. We lift our voices in pray-
er, and we raise our sights to the Glory 
of God! 
Just as we believe in the First 
Amendment, we also believe in another 
Constitutional right that is under siege 
all across our country. So long as I am 
President I will always protect your 
Second Amendment right to keep and 
bear arms. 
In reaffirming our heritage as a free 
Nation, we must remember that Amer-
ica has always been a frontier nation. 
Now we must embrace the next fron-
tier, America’s manifest destiny in the 
stars. I am asking the Congress to fully 
fund the Artemis program to ensure 
that the next man and the first woman 
on the moon will be American astro-
nauts—using this as a launching pad to 
ensure that America is the first nation 
to plant its flag on Mars. 
My Administration is also strongly 
defending our national security and 
combating radical Islamic terrorism. 
Last 
week, 
I 
announced 
a 
groundbreaking plan for peace between 
Israel and the Palestinians. Recog-
nizing that all past attempts have 
failed, we must be determined and cre-
ative in order to stabilize the region 
and give millions of young people the 
change to realize a better future. 
Three years ago, the barbarians of 
ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of 
territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the 
ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 
percent destroyed, and the founder and 
leader of ISIS—the bloodthirsty killer 
Al-Baghdadi—is dead! 
We are joined this evening by Carl 
and Marsha Mueller. After graduating 
from college, their beautiful daughter 
Kayla became a humanitarian aid 
worker. Kayla once wrote, ‘‘Some peo-
ple find God in church. Some people 
find God in nature. Some people find 
God in love; I find God in suffering. I’ve 
known for some time what my life’s 
work is, using my hands as tools to re-
lieve suffering.’’ In 20l3, while caring 
for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla 
was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved 
by ISIS, and kept as a prisoner of Al- 
Baghdadi himself. After more than 500 
horrifying 
days 
of 
captivity, 
Al- 
Baghdadi murdered young Kayla. She 
was just 26 years old. 
On the night that United States Spe-
cial 
Forces 
Operators 
ended 
Al- 
Baghdadi’s miserable life, the Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen-
eral Mark Milley, received a call in the 
Situation Room. He was told that the 
brave men of the elite Special Forces 
team, that so perfectly carried out the 
operation, had given their mission a 
name—‘‘Task Force 8–14.’’ It was a ref-
erence to a special day: August 14th— 
Kayla’s birthday. Carl and Marsha, 
America’s 
warriors 
never 
forgot 
Kayla—and neither will we. 
Every 
day, 
America’s 
men 
and 
women in uniform demonstrate the in-
finite depths of love that dwells in the 
human heart. 
One of these American heroes was 
Army 
Staff 
Sergeant 
Christopher 
Hake. On his second deployment to 
Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a let-
ter to his 1-year-old son, Gage: ‘‘I will 
be with you again,’’ he wrote to Gage. 
‘‘I will teach you to ride your first 
bike, build your first sand box, watch 
you play sports and see you have kids 
also. I love you son, take care of your 
mother. I am always with you. Dad.’’ 
On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was 
out on patrol in Baghdad when his 
Bradley Fighting Vehicle was hit by a 
roadside bomb. That night, he made 
the ultimate sacrifice for our country. 
Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal 
glory in Arlington, and his wife Kelli is 
in the gallery tonight, joined by their 
son, who is now 13 years old. To Kelli 
and Gage: Chris will live in our hearts 
forever. 
The terrorist responsible for killing 
Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, 
who provided the deadly roadside bomb 
that took Chris’s life. Soleimani was 
the Iranian Regime’s most ruthless 
butcher, a monster who murdered or 
wounded thousands of American serv-
ice members in Iraq. As the world’s top 
terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the 
deaths of countless men, women, and 
children. He directed the December as-
sault on United States Forces in Iraq, 
and was actively planning new attacks. 
That is why, last month, at my direc-
tion, the United States Military exe-
cuted a flawless precision strike that 
killed Soleimani and terminated his 
evil reign of terror forever. 
Our message to the terrorists is 
clear: You will never escape American 
justice. If you attack our citizens, you 
forfeit your life! 
In recent months, we have seen proud 
Iranians raise their voices against 
their oppressive rulers. The Iranian re-
gime must abandon its pursuit of nu-
clear weapons, stop spreading terror, 
death, and destruction, and start work-
ing for the good of its own people. Be-
cause of our powerful sanctions, the 
Iranian economy is doing very poorly. 
We can help them make it very good in 
a short period of time, but perhaps 
they are too proud or too foolish to ask 
for that help. We are here. Let’s see 
which road they choose. It is totally up 
to them. 
As we defend American lives, we are 
working to end America’s wars in the 
Middle East. 
In Afghanistan, the determination 
and valor of our warfighters has al-
lowed us to make tremendous progress, 
and peace talks are underway. I am not 
looking to kill hundreds of thousands 
of people in Afghanistan, many of them 
innocent. It is also not our function to 
serve other nations as a law enforce-
ment agency. These are warfighters, 
the best in the world, and they either 
want to fight to win or not fight at all. 
We are working to finally end Amer-
ica’s longest war and bring our troops 
back home! 
War places a heavy burden on our Na-
tion’s extraordinary military families, 
especially spouses like Amy Williams 
from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and 
her 2 children—6-year-old Elliana and 
3-year-old Rowan. Amy works full 
time, and volunteers countless hours 
helping other military families. For 
the past 7 months, she has done it all 
while her husband, Sergeant First 
Class Townsend Williams, is in Afghan-
istan on his fourth deployment to the 
Middle East. Amy’s kids have not seen 
their father’s face in many months. 
Amy, your family’s sacrifice makes it 
possible for all of our families to live in 
safety and peace—we thank you.

But Amy, there is one more thing. 
Tonight, we have a very special sur-
prise. I am thrilled to inform you that 
your husband is back from deployment, 
he is here with us tonight, and we 
could not keep him waiting any longer. 
America proudly welcomes home Ser-
geant Townsend Williams! 
As the world bears witness tonight, 
America is a land of heroes. This is the 
place where greatness is born, where 
destinies are forged, and where legends 
come to life. This is the home of Thom-
as Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of 
many great Generals, including Wash-
ington, Pershing, Patton, and Mac-
Arthur. This is the home of Abraham 
Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia 
Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright 
Brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many 
more. This is the country where chil-
dren learn names like Wyatt Earp, 
Davy Crockett, and Annie Oakley. This 
is the place where the pilgrims landed 
at Plymouth and where Texas patriots 
made their last stand at the Alamo. 
The American Nation was carved out 
of the vast frontier by the toughest, 
strongest, fiercest, and most deter-
mined men and women ever to walk 
the face of the Earth. Our ancestors 
braved the unknown; tamed the wilder-
ness; settled the Wild West; lifted mil-
lions from poverty, disease, and hun-
ger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; 
ushered the world to new heights of 
science and medicine; laid down the 
railroads, dug out canals, raised up the 
skyscrapers—and, ladies and gentle-
men, our ancestors built the most ex-
ceptional Republic ever to exist in all 
of human history. And we are making 
it greater than ever before! 
This is our glorious and magnificent 
inheritance. 
We are Americans. We are the pio-
neers. We are the pathfinders. We set-
tled the new world, we built the mod-
ern world, and we changed history for-
ever by embracing the eternal truth 
that everyone is made equal by the 
hand of Almighty God. 
America is the place where anything 
can happen! America is the place where 
anyone can rise. And here, on this land, 
on this soil, on this continent, the 
most incredible dreams come true! 
This Nation is our canvas, and this 
country is our masterpiece. We look at 
tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers 
just waiting to be explored. Our bright-
est discoveries are not yet known. Our 
most thrilling stories are not yet told. 
Our grandest journeys are not yet 
made. The American Age, the Amer-
ican Epic, the American Adventure, 
has only just begun! 
Our spirit is still young; the sun is 
still rising; God’s grace is still shining; 
and my fellow Americans, the best is 
yet to come! 
Thank you. God Bless You. God Bless 
America.

RECOGNIZING L.F. ‘‘SANDY’’ SAMS, 
JR. 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate L.F. ‘‘Sandy’’ Sams, 
Jr., who is retiring after a successful career at 
the Mitchell, McNutt & Sams law firm in 
Tupelo, Mississippi. 
Sandy is a lifelong Mississippian who was 
born in Meridian, Mississippi, and later moved 
to West Point, Mississippi. After high school, 
he attended the University of Mississippi for 
undergrad and then returned to the University 
for Law School, where he graduated with hon-
ors. Sandy served our Nation in the United 
States Army as an Assistant Staff Judge Ad-
vocate in the U.S. Army XVIII Airborne Corps 
at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. After his serv-
ice, he returned to West Point to practice law. 
In 1971, he officially began his career in 
Tupelo with the Mitchell McNutt law firm. 
Sandy Sams is a remarkable Mississippian, 
and it is individuals like him that make Mis-
sissippi and America great. I wish him all the 
best in his well-deserved retirement.

I proudly pause to recognize Ryan DeHaan. 
Ryan is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1692, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Ryan has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Ryan has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Ryan 
has contributed to his community through his 
Eagle Scout project. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Ryan DeHaan for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the

for your continued contribution to our commu-
nity.

COMMEMORATING BLACK HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, this 
February we recognize and celebrate the 42nd 
commemoration of Black History Month. 
This month we celebrate the contributions of 
African Americans to the history of our great 
nation, and pay tribute to trailblazers, pio-
neers, heroes, and leaders like the 44th Presi-
dent of the United States and First Lady, 
Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, respec-
tively; Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Su-
preme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall; U.S. 
Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce; U.S. Congress-
woman Barbara Jordan; U.S. Congressman 
Mickey Leland; Astronauts Dr. Guion Stewart 
Bluford, Jr. and Mae C. Jemison; activists, in-
tellectuals, authors, artists, and entrepreneurs 
like Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Wash-
ington, James Baldwin, Harriet Tubman, Rosa 
Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, Gwen-
dolyn Brooks, Shonda Rhimes, Ava Duvernay, 
Oprah Winfrey, and Super Bowl LIV winning 
quarterback Patrick Mahomes and National 
Football League Most Valuable Player Lamar 
Jackson, just to name a few of the countless 
number of well-known and unsung heroes 
whose contributions have helped our nation 
become a more perfect union. 
The history of the United States has been 
marked by the great contributions of African 
American activists, leaders, writers, and art-
ists. 
As a member of Congress, I know that I 
stand on the shoulders of giants like Shirley 
Chisolm, John Conyers, JOHN LEWIS, Ronald 
Dellums, and Barbara Jordan whose struggles 
and triumphs made it possible for me to stand 
here today and continue the fight for equality, 
justice, and progress for all, regardless of 
race, religion, gender or sexual orientation. 
The greatest of these giants to me are Mrs. 
Ivalita ‘‘Ivy’’ Jackson, a vocational nurse, and 
Mr. Ezra A. Jackson, one of the first African 
Americans to succeed in the comic book pub-
lishing business. 
They were my beloved parents and they 
taught me the value of education, hard work, 
discipline, perseverance, and caring for others. 
And I am continually inspired by Dr. Elwyn 
Lee, my husband and the first tenured African 
American law professor at the University of 
Houston. 
Madam Speaker, I particularly wish to ac-
knowledge the contributions of African Amer-
ican veterans in defending from foreign ag-
gressors and who by their courageous exam-
ples helped transform our nation from a seg-
regated society to a nation committed to the 
never-ending challenge of perfecting our 
union. 
Several years ago about this time, I was 
honored to join Congressmen JOHN LEWIS and 
former Congressman Charles Rangel, a Ko-
rean War veteran, in paying tribute to sur-
viving members of the Tuskegee Airmen and 
the 555th Parachute Infantry, the famed ‘‘Tri-
ple Nickels’’ at a moving ceremony sponsored 
by the U.S. Army commemorating the 50th an-
niversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. 
The success of the Tuskegee Airmen in es-
corting bombers during World War II—achiev-
ing one of the lowest loss records of all the 
escort fighter groups and being in constant de-
mand for their services by the allied bomber 
units—is a record unmatched by any other 
fighter group. 
So impressive and astounding were the 
feats of the Tuskegee Airmen that in 1948, it 
helped persuade President Harry Truman to 
issue his famous Executive Order No. 9981, 
which directed equality of treatment and op-
portunity in all of the United States Armed 
Forces and led to the end of racial segrega-
tion in the U.S. military forces. 
It is a source of enormous and enduring 
pride that my father-in-law, Phillip Ferguson 
Lee, was one of the Tuskegee Airmen. 
Clearly, what began as an experiment to de-
termine whether ‘‘colored’’ soldiers’ were ca-
pable of operating expensive and complex 
combat aircraft ended as an unqualified suc-
cess 
based 
on 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Tuskegee Airmen, whose record included 261 
aircraft destroyed, 148 aircraft damaged, 
15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions 
over Italy and North Africa. 
They also destroyed or damaged over 950 
units of ground transportation and escorted 
more than 200 bombing missions.

They proved that ‘‘the antidote to racism is 
excellence in performance,’’ as retired Lt. Col. 
Herbert Carter once remarked. 
Madam Speaker, Black History Month is 
also a time to remember many pioneering 
women like U.S. Congresswoman Shirley 
Chisholm; activists Harriet Tubman and Rosa 
Parks; astronaut Mae C. Jemison; mathemati-
cians like Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy 
Vaughan and Mary Jackson authors Maya 
Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn 
Brooks; all of whom have each in their own 
way, whether through courageous activism, 
cultural or intellectual contributions, or artistic 
creativity, forged social and political change, 
and forever changed our great Nation for the 
better. 
It is also fitting, Madam Speaker, that in ad-
dition to those national leaders who contribu-
tions have made our nation better, we honor 
also those who have and are making a dif-
ference in their local communities. 
In my home city of Houston, there are nu-
merous men and women who are great be-
cause they have heeded the counsel of Dr. 
King who said: 
‘‘Everybody can be great because anybody 
can serve. You only a need a heart full of 
grace. A soul generated by love.’’ 
By that measure, I wish to pay tribute to 
some of the great men and women who help 
to make Houston the wonderful, dynamic, vi-
brant, inclusive, and progressive city that it is. 
As we celebrate Black History Month, let us 
pay tribute to those who have come before us, 
and pay forward to future generations by ad-
dressing what is the number one issue for Af-
rican American families, and all American fam-
ilies today: preserving the American promise 
of economic opportunity for all. 
Our immediate focus must be to work ’For 
The People’ for job creation, and enacting leg-
islation that will foster and lay the foundation 
for today’s and tomorrow’s generation of 
groundbreaking activists, leaders, scientists, 
writers and artists to continue contributing to 
the greatness of America. 
We must continue to preserve the American 
Dream for all. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand here 
in celebration of the heroic and historic acts of 
African Americans and their indispensable 
contributions to this great Nation. 
It is through our work in creating possibilities 
for today and future generations that we best 
honor the accomplishments and legacy of our 
predecessors.

HONORING LAUREN ACKERMAN 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Lauren Acker-
man for her dedicated service to our commu-
nity as the Proprietor of Ackerman Heritage 
House. 
Ms. Ackerman was born in Los Angeles, 
California where she attended the University 
of Southern California and attained a Bachelor 
of Arts degree in Public Relations and Busi-
ness. She then attended Pepperdine Univer-
sity, completing a Master of Business Adminis-
tration with an emphasis in Strategic Mar-
keting and Entrepreneurship. Currently serving 
on the City of Napa General Plan Advisory 
Council (GPAC) 2040; her most notable con-
tribution to the Napa community came when 
Ms. Ackerman bought and restored an historic 
property in downtown Napa, a Queen Anne 
Victorian home originally designed by ac-
claimed architect Luther Turton. The property 
is now celebrating its 130th anniversary, and 
the restoration done by Ms. Ackerman won a 
2019 Preservation Design Award for Restora-
tion. 
This achievement alone warrants recogni-
tion, but Ms. Ackerman’s contribution to our 
community is not limited to the Heritage 
House. She plays a very active role in our 
community in many other ways. Ms. Ackerman 
serves as chair of the board for both the 
American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, 
and the Napa Valley Community Foundation. 
She is also on the board for the Napa Valley 
Film Festival, The Society of Fellows and the 
Board Advancement Committee for the Cul-
inary Institute of America, among others. 
Lauren Ackerman is an advocate for Women 
in Business and determined to maintain the 
history of Napa through the contribution of the 
Ackerman Heritage House. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Ackerman is the kind 
of citizen we should all strive to be. Her as-
tounding level of community involvement and 
commitment to preserving the history and cul-
ture of our community is noteworthy. It is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor 
Lauren Ackerman here today.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO

Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Red Rocks 
Community College on being awarded the 
West Metro Chamber of Commerce Large 
Business of the Year Award. 
With campuses in Lakewood and Arvada, 
Colo., Red Rocks Community College is a tre-
mendous asset in our community assisting 
students in meeting their career and edu-
cational goals through multiple pathways to 
success and in a collaborative environment. 
Red Rocks Community College serves thou-
sands of students each semester, the vast 
majority of whom are considered non-tradi-
tional students. A typical student at Red Rocks 
is 28 years old on average and most work part 
or full-time, in addition to pursuing their de-
gree. Many students also have a family to 
support as well. Red Rocks offers 150 degree 
and certificate programs, 40 department of 
Student Success Services programs, and re-
cently became the first community college in 
the nation to offer a master’s degree and two 
bachelor’s degrees. 
Red Rocks has been ranked first among 
Colorado Community colleges for first-year 
graduate earnings and ranked third among 
Colorado public and private 2-year and 4-year 
institutions. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Red 
Rocks Community College for this well-de-
served recognition and thank them for their 
continued service to the community.

HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Reverend Dr. Marcus Demond 
Davidson, Senior Pastor of the New Mount 
Olive Baptist Church, on his 10th Annual Pas-
toral Anniversary, which will take place during 
the month of March 2020.

out his career, he has tirelessly served faith- 
based and secular groups by helping to trans-
form and empower others to achieve their 
greatest potential.

his call into the preaching ministry. In 1999, he 
was elected and previously served for ten 
years as pastor of the Pleasant Grove Mis-
sionary Baptist Church in Courtland, Alabama. 
Rev. Davidson’s move to the New Mount

a 
young, 
spirited 
minister 
who’s 
many 
achievements include his work as a gospel re-
cording artist, entrepreneur, noted preacher, 
pastor, and teacher. Additionally, he has been 
an inspiring figure through his numerous other 
works and engagements within the commu-
nity. 
Madam Speaker, Rev. Davidson has long 
stated that ‘‘worship is not so much style as it 
is substance.’’ It is abundantly clear that over 
the last decade at New Mount Olive Baptist 
Church that this remains his ethos every sin-
gle day. I once again want to congratulate 
Reverend Dr. Marcus Demond Davidson on 
his 10th Annual Pastoral Anniversary and wish 
him many more years of successful service to 
our community.

HONORING CAMILO HERMOSILLO 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the exceptional 
life of Camilo Hermosillo. 
Camilo 
was 
born 
July 
28, 
1929, 
in 
Jalostotitlan Jalisco, Mexico. He was raised in 
humble circumstances, by a single mother. He 
often recounted working with his mother in the 
corn fields for a penny a day. Camilo immi-
grated to the United States as a young man 
in 1947 as part of the Bracero program. 
His life was built on a foundation of hard 
work and service, and he was always grateful 
for the opportunities that the United States 
provided him. He had many farming and agri-
cultural jobs throughout his life. He worked on 
the Leveroni Ranch in south Sonoma, where 
he worked for three generations of Leveronis. 
He and his wife owned the first Mexican mar-
ket and restaurant in Sonoma Valley. With his 
hard work, he was able to purchase three 
homes in Sonoma County, which he rented 
out inexpensively to give Latino families a 
hand up. 
An immigrant himself, Camilo understood 
the barriers that many Latinos must overcome 
in order to create a happy and successful life 
in the United States. He dedicated himself and 
his resources to serving fellow Latino immi-
grants. He helped find jobs, drove people to 
the DMV to get their driver licenses, and even 
housed people in the spare bedrooms of his 
own home. He found great joy in helping his 
own family and other Latinos get settled in 
California. 
Camilo is survived by his loving wife, Maria, 
and their children; Gabriel Hermosillo, Gerardo 
Hermosillo, Carmen Cervantes, Marco Antonio 
Hermosillo, Martha Sanchez, and Rebecca 
Hermosillo. He is preceded in death by his 
daughter Cecilia Hermosillo. He leaves behind 
14 grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren and 
a large extended family. 
Madam Speaker, Camilo Hermosillo was the 
kind of father that everyone wishes for, and 
the kind of person we should all strive to be. 
It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor 
him here today.

OPPOSITION TO S. 3201, THE TEM-
PORARY REAUTHORIZATION AND 
STUDY 
OF 
THE 
EMERGENCY 
SCHEDULING 
OF 
FENTANYL 
ANALOGUES ACT 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, on January 
29, I voted against S. 3201, the Temporary 
Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency 
Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. 
Fentanyl, a deadly synthetic drug 50 times 
more powerful than heroin, is wreaking havoc 
on Americans across the country. In 2017, 
there were over 47,000 opioid overdose 
deaths, and 28,000 of those deaths involved 
synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. In Oregon, 
fentanyl use and deaths associated with 
fentanyl use continue to climb: In 2013, there 
were 14 related fentanyl deaths in Oregon; In 
2018, there were more than 75. 
We must to do more to combat this epi-
demic. We should start with aggressively 
cracking down on major manufacturers. Ac-
cording to the Oregon-Idaho High Intensity 
Drug Trafficking Area program, most non- 
pharmaceutical fentanyl and fentanyl ana-
logues that are available in Oregon are illicitly 
manufactured—primarily in China, as well as 
in Mexico—and then imported into the United 
States. 
That’s why I am a cosponsor of the 
Fentanyl Sanctions Act. This legislation would 
require the imposition of sanctions on drug 
manufacturers in China who knowingly provide 
synthetic opioids to traffickers, transnational 
criminal organizations (such as cartels in Mex-
ico who are known to mix fentanyl with other 
drugs before trafficking them into the U.S.), 
and financial institutions that assist such enti-
ties. It would also authorize new funding for 
law enforcement and intelligence agencies to 
combat the foreign trafficking of synthetic 
opioids and urge the president to significantly 
ramp up diplomatic efforts with China and 
Mexico to establish multilateral sanctions 
against foreign synthetic opioid traffickers. I 
am pleased that this important legislation was 
included in the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2020 that was signed into 
law last year. 
However, I have strong concerns that S. 
3201 will expose more individuals to prosecu-
tions and aggressive federal mandatory mini-
mums for even trace amounts of illicit fentanyl 
and 
fentanyl 
analogues, 
undermine 
our 
progress on bipartisan sentencing reform ef-
forts like the First Step Act, and fail to focus 
our efforts on combatting major illicit fentanyl 
manufacturers and traffickers. 
We must not arrest our way out of this cri-
sis. This epidemic demands thoughtful legisla-
tion from Congress, not a knee-jerk response 
that is likely to exacerbate troubling trends in 
federal drug prosecutions and incarceration 
levels. 
Given that S. 3201 will extend the Drug En-
forcement Administration’s (DEA) emergency 
scheduling 
of 
fentanyl-related 
substances 
through May 6, 2021, I hope the committees 
of jurisdiction use that time to develop a bal-
anced, comprehensive approach that protects 
public health and safety while addressing 
fentanyl overdoses and reducing the harm of 
federal mandatory minimums and overincar-
ceration.

HONORING ADVENTIST HEALTH 
HOWARD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Adventist Health Howard 
Memorial Hospital for its recent five-star rating 
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services. This rating reflects the hard work 
and dedication of Adventist Health Howard 
Memorial’s staff and their commitment to high 
quality, patient-centered care. 
In 1925, members of the Willits Develop-
ment Association discussed the need for a 
community hospital. This group included 
Charles S. Howard, the owner of a nearby 
ranch and the racehorse Seabiscuit. In 1926, 
Charles Howard’s 15-year-old son died in an 
automobile accident, and the family felt a lack 
of emergency equipment and access to hos-
pital facilities contributed to his death. Charles 
Howard donated substantial funds toward the 
construction of the Frank R. Howard Memorial 
Hospital to be built in honor of his son. The 
hospital admitted its first patient in 1928. 
Of the more than 4,500 hospitals rated by 
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Serv-
ices (CMS) this year, Adventist Health Howard 
Memorial Hospital is one of only 407 hospitals 
to receive a five-star rating. This rating is 
based on the hospital’s performance across 
seven metrics of quality, including patient ex-
perience and readmission rates. 
In addition to this rating, the hospital re-
cently received a Planetree Gold Certification 
which reflects ‘‘Excellence in Person-Centered 
Care’’. It is an evidence-based certification 
program 
that 
provides 
a 
framework 
for 
healthcare providers to improve overall health 
and well-being by engaging patients, families, 
staff, and the wider community in tailoring

HONORING LARRY SLY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Larry Sly for 
over four decades of service to our community 
and to celebrate his retirement from the Food 
Bank of Contra Costa and Solano. 
Mr. Sly began his work with the Food Bank 
after graduating from the University of Cali-
fornia Berkeley. He accepted a job as a truck 
driver for the then newly formed Food Bank of 
Contra Costa and Solano. In just three years, 
he became the organization’s Executive Direc-
tor. Since that time, he has been instrumental 
in the development and growth of the Food 
Bank’s mission and success. When he be-
came Executive Director, the Food Bank was 
distributing just 36,000 pounds of food per 
year from parking lots and churches. 40 years 
later and due to Mr. Sly’s devoted service and 
leadership, the Food Bank now distributes 25 
million pounds of food each year to our com-
munity. 
Mr. Sly served as Vice Chair of the Board 
of Directors of Feeding America, the national 
food bank network, and on the National Coun-
cil, an elected group of food bank leaders who 
serve as the voice of the network for Feeding 
America. He has also served on the Board of 
Directors of the California Association of Food 
Banks, and now chairs the Emergency Food 
and Shelter Board that works to allocate fed-
eral funds to hunger and shelter agencies in 
Contra Costa County. He has served on State 
Advisory Committees on hunger and has been 
appointed to several task forces for Feeding 
America. His commitment to nourishing our 
community is truly unprecedented and we are 
grateful for his many contributions. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Sly is the kind of cit-
izen we should all strive to be. His incredible 
work and leadership have served countless 
people in our community. It is therefore fitting 
and proper that we honor him here today.

ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Jack has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Jack has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Jack 
has earned the rank of Warrior in the Tribe of 
Mic-O-Say, become a Brotherhood member of 
the Order of the Arrow, and led his troop as 
the Senior Patrol Leader. Jack has also con-
tributed to his community through his Eagle

SEVERE WEATHER SHELTER 
NETWORK

OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud the Severe 
Weather Shelter Network on being awarded 
the West Metro Chamber of Commerce Non-
profit of the Year Award. 
The Severe Weather Shelter Network was 
developed out of the Severe Weather Collabo-
ration in 2012. The Collaboration is one of 
seven sub-committees of the Heading Home 
collaboration in Jefferson County with the goal 
of addressing the needs of families and indi-
viduals experiencing homelessness during life- 
threatening weather, such as winter nights. As 
a Christian ministry, the group welcomes all 
volunteers who share a passion for aiding indi-
viduals experiencing homelessness. 
The Severe Weather Shelter Network part-
ners with community organizations and agen-
cies to provide overnight shelter on life-threat-
ening winter nights for individuals living on the 
streets. They work with local churches to pro-
vide sites to host individuals and families over-
night where they can also enjoy a hot, home-
made meal and friendly conversation. The 
group also connects homeless individuals with 
other much-needed resources. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to the 
Severe Weather Shelter Network for this well- 
deserved recognition and thank them for their 
continued service to the community.

HONORING JOHN JOSEPH 
MANFREDA 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember John Jo-
seph Manfreda for his lifelong belief in and 
staunch commitment to exceptional public 
service. 
Born in Washington, D.C., Mr. Manfreda re-
ceived his undergraduate degree in business 
finance and economics from the University of 
Maryland. He earned his law degree from the 
American University School of Law in 1970 
and earned a master’s degree in tax law from 
Georgetown University Law Center in 1974. 
Mr. Manfreda began his almost 50-year career 
in public service at the Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco, and Firearms (ATF) Counsel Office 
and its Internal Revenue Service predecessor. 
From 1999 to 2003, he served as Chief Coun-
sel for ATF. Mr. Manfreda was integral to the 
founding of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and 
Trade Bureau (TTB). He served TTB as the 
Deputy Administrator before being appointed 
to the Administrator of the Bureau in 2005. 
Mr. Manfreda was widely respected for his 
knowledge, fairness, and honesty by his col-
leagues and those he worked with in the in-
dustry he regulated. He helped write many al-
cohol laws when he served as Counsel for 
ATF and retained the information about those 
laws. He was a fair man and was always will-

recognized for his important work with the 
Meritorious and Distinguished Presidential 
Rank Awards and the Lifetime Achievement 
Award from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
and Firearms. 
Madam Speaker, John Joseph Manfreda 
was a dedicated public servant who held the 
sincere belief in the good of public service. He 
inspired his coworkers and was a friend and 
mentor to all who knew him and a devoted 
family man to his wife, children, and grand-
children. It is therefore fitting and proper that 
we remember the life and honor the service of 
John Joseph Manfreda here today.

IOWAN OF THE WEEK—KRISTI 
MYERS 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Kristi Myers from Des Moines on this 
year’s World Cancer Day. 
Kristi is the mom of a smart and talented 
daughter, Audrey, and the wife of a wonderful 
partner, Dan. She works as a high school 
English teacher at Central Academy, and I 
hear she’s a student favorite. Kristi is forever 
a Chicago Cubs fan, which speaks to her con-
stant optimism. Kristi is a beautiful soul with a 
generous heart. 
And Kristi is another thing—a cancer sur-
vivor. She’s fought and beaten cancer three 
times, and she is supported by her community 
making sure she’ll be a fourth-time survivor. 
She’s survived Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a brain 
tumor, breast cancer, and is now fighting a 
second brain tumor. I am in awe of Kristi’s 
strength, and the love and support of her fam-
ily, to stand up to cancer four times over. On 
this World Cancer Day, I want to honor Kristi’s 
fighting spirit, thank her family and our com-
munity who have helped support her, and 
make sure that we remember all those who 
have cancer on this day. 
Cancer doesn’t know age or gender; it 
doesn’t care about your race or how much 
money you have. When someone is diag-
nosed with cancer, it impacts us all. Everyone 
in Iowa knows someone with cancer, and 
that’s why I’m committed to providing research 
and development funding for all types of can-
cer—across the board. As a mom, I’m com-
mitted to making sure that moms across Iowa 
have a fighting chance. 
Kristi, and all cancer fighters in Iowa, need 
our support. Today, on World Cancer Day, it 
is important we remember that cancer affects 
us all. I’ll keep fighting for more funding and 
research, and I know that Kristi will keep fight-
ing too.

Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Napa Valley 
Community Foundation for twenty-five years of 
dedicated service to our community. 
The Napa Valley Community Foundation 
(NVCF) was established in 1994 and is cele-

improve the quality of life for residents in our 
community, and currently serves as the philan-
thropic partner to thousands of individuals, 
families, nonprofit agencies and corporations 
in Napa Valley and beyond. 
NVCF has a long tradition of tackling signifi-
cant challenges in an even-handed, non-par-
tisan and strategic way. Its projects have in-
cluded studies on the economic impacts of im-
migration in Napa Valley, providing affordable, 
legal immigration assistance and helping more 
than 1,300 legal permanent residents in Napa 
county become U.S. citizens. The Foundation 
also manages the Napa Valley Community 
Disaster Relief Fund, which has provided re-
sources for short-term relief and long-term re-
covery to survivors of the 2014 South Napa 
Earthquake and the devastating fires in 2017. 
The Foundation has distributed nearly $18 mil-
lion in the form of direct financial assistance to 
survivors, and to pay for critical relief and re-
covery services like temporary shelters, meals, 
medical care, counseling, legal aid and assist-
ance in navigating insurance claims. Apart 
from these major initiatives, the Foundation 
serves as a consultant to hundreds of local 
donors each year, helping them find greater 
joy and impact in their charitable giving. 
Madam Speaker, the Napa Valley Commu-
nity Foundation is a community leader whose 
only agenda is to make the Valley stronger, 
more cohesive and more vibrant. It is there-
fore fitting and proper that we honor the Napa

sas State Spelling Bee. He will be moving on

week as the state’s top speller among 50 stu-
dents in third through eighth grades from 
around the State of Arkansas. 
Seeing the story of Thomas’ perseverance

outstanding example of everything that aca-
demic excellence and hard work can accom-

I know that he will represent the Fourth Dis-
trict and the State of Arkansas well on the na-

HONORING JEREMIAH KAHMOSON 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON

Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jeremiah 
Kahmoson for years of exceptional public 
service to the young people of Lake County, 
California and to honor him as the Lake Coun-
ty Teacher of the Year. 
Jeremiah Kahmoson was born and raised in 
Sonoma County and believes in giving back to 
the 
next 
generation 
of 
students. 
Mr. 
Kahmoson is a teacher at the North Bay Met 
Academy and serves as the Executive Direc-
tor of the B-Rad Foundation, which works to 
empower individuals through environmental 
stewardship, health, and adventure programs. 
In August of 2014, he lost his best friend 
Bradley ‘‘B-Rad’’ Parker in a tragic climbing 
accident in Yosemite National Park. The B- 
Rad Foundation was founded in Brad’s mem-
ory and based upon the three pillars of his life: 
Health, Stewardship, and Adventure. Today, 
the B-Rad Foundation seeks to create a uni-
verse where children live a life where every 
year features 365 days of awesome. 
For the past five years, the B-Rad Founda-
tion has supported thousands of kids and their 
families with fun-filled programs and events. 
They have partnered with the King Ridge 
Foundation to lead extended back-country ad-
ventures for Sonoma County youth in Yosem-
ite National Park. They were instrnmental in 
the giveaway of over 500 bicycles for dev-
astated children, who lost all their possessions 
in the 2017 wildfires. The B-Rad program also 
practices an important ‘‘pay-it-forward’’ philos-
ophy, as students use their newly acquired re-
pair skills to fix donated broken bikes and re- 
gift 
them 
to 
local 
at-risk 
youth. 
Mr. 
Kahmoson’s deep commitment to enriching 
the education of our youth through environ-
mental stewardship has become a deeply ap-
preciated part of our community. 
Madam Speaker, Jeremiah Kahmoson is a 
passionate adventurer and educator who has 
made great contributions to better the lives of 
others in our community. It is therefore fitting

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Patricia G. 
Leary and to celebrate her retirement after 
three decades of public service on a local, 
state, and federal level. 
Ms. Leary began her career in public serv-
ice after graduating from the University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles in 1981 with a degree in 
Political Science. Upon graduating, Ms. Leary 
began working as a legislative staffer in Cali-
fornia State Government. From 1991 to 1995, 
Ms. Leary worked as my Legislative Director 
in the California State Senate, where she was 
a valuable asset to my team. She was an ar-
ticulate, straightforward communicator with a 
strong passion for public service. Her institu-

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Eaton Senior 
Communities on being awarded the West 
Metro Chamber of Commerce Medium Busi-
ness of the Year Award. 
Eaton Senior Communities (ESC) evolved 
from the West Alameda Community Baptist 
Church with big ideas and a passion for serv-

organization of several nonprofits including 
local senior communities in the area and the 
Eaton Healthy Food Truck. 
Since 1980, ESC’s mission has been to pro-
vide affordable housing in a service-rich envi-
ronment that enables all individuals to live to 
their fullest potential. Their wholistic approach 
on providing services for the whole person 
means they are focused on the physical, emo-
tional, intellectual, nutritional, environmental, 
social, and spiritual aspects of each individ-
uals, which is what earned them this recogni-
tion.

HONORING TEMPLE SOLEL OF 
HOLLYWOOD 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
wish a heartfelt Mazel Tov to Temple Solel of 
Hollywood, Florida on their 50th Anniversary 
Jubilee. 
The Jewish faith teaches us that we must lift 
up everyone to make the world a better 
place—Tikkun Olam. For 50 years, the mem-
bers of Temple Solel have humbly done their 
part to repair the world for all those who strug-
gle, for all who are forced to go without, and 
for everyone who is in need of a helping hand. 
And they do it unconditionally, with generosity, 
and with Gemilut Hasadim—the gift of loving 
kindness. 
Congratulations to Rabbi Robert Frazen, 
Rabbi Jeffrey Salkin, Cantor Israel Rosen, and 
all those who have served the congregation 
over the past 50 years. Their decades of lead-
ership, spiritual guidance, and service have 
helped make Temple Solel become one of the 
most progressive faith-based institutions in 
Broward County. Whether educating our com-
munity about the dangers of climate change 
and sea level rise or supporting the values of 
full equality for LGBTQ Jews and their fami-
lies, they have set an example for all to follow. 
I hold a deep admiration for the tremendous 
kindness the clergy and congregants of Tem-
ple Solel have shown our community for half 
a century. I wish them much success and joy 
as they continue to grow for the next 50 years. 
HONORING CHIEF ERNIE SANCHEZ 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA

Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chief Ernie 
Sanchez for his exceptional public service to 
the people of Northern California and to honor 
his retirement after 29 years as a California 
Highway Patrol (CHP) officer. 
Chief Ernie Sanchez was born in East Los 
Angeles, California. He earned a bachelor’s 
degree in Political Science and Spanish from 
Brigham Young University. Since then, he has 
dedicated his career to improving the commu-
nity around him. As he rose through the ranks 
from CHP Officer to Chief of the Vallejo Gold-
en Gate Division, he garnered the respect of 
those he worked with as a compassionate and 
fair leader. As Chief, he was committed to the 
Department’s vision and maintained an un-
wavering dedication to serving our community 
with professionalism. This allowed him to gain 
the support and gratitude of his subordinates, 
peers, allied agency leaders, and members of 
the public for his dedication and expertise. 
Throughout his time as a member of the 
California Highway Patrol, Chief Sanchez was 
recognized for his hard work and commitment. 
He was awarded the Governor’s Employee 
Safety Award for lowering motorcycle involved 
injury collisions in the Bay Area and the Com-
missioner’s Unit Citation for the development 
of the Office of Inspector General and related 
policies and procedures. In addition, he was a 
multiple year awardee for the California Law 
Enforcement Challenge, designed to help re-
duce motor vehicle involved injury collisions 
and lower the Mileage Death Rate. Most re-
cently, he lent his support to our community 
as Incident Commander during the devastating 
Atlas, Tubbs, and Kincade fires. 
Madam Speaker, Chief Ernie Sanchez is the 
kind of citizen we should all strive to be. He 
has made immense contributions throughout 
his career to better our community. It is there-
fore fitting and proper that we honor him here 
today.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF CONGREGA-
TION BETH JACOB ON ITS 90TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, we rise 
today to honor Congregation Beth Jacob of 
Redwood City, California, as it celebrates its 
90th Anniversary of service to Jewish resi-
dents living between the cities of San Fran-
cisco and San Jose. The founders, Polish and 
Russian immigrants, were among the many 
Jews who fled Eastern Europe between 1882 
and 1910. The group’s first service was at-
tended by 25 members and was held in a 
member’s home. 
The Congregation held services in its first 
synagogue in Menlo Park in 1931. In 1952, 
the Congregation broke ground for its current 
facility on Alameda de las Pulgas in Redwood 
City. In 1979, Beth Jacob suffered a cata-
strophic fire, and the current facility was rebuilt 
in 1981. 
Congregation Beth Jacob’s first leader was 
Kenneth Carlton Zwerin who served for a dec-
ade, followed by numerous rabbis and lay 
leaders. Rabbi H. David Teitelbaum, a distin-
guished civil rights activist, led Beth Jacob to 
join the United Synagogue of Conservative Ju-
daism, an affiliation that continued until 2013. 
Rabbi Nathaniel Ezray, the Congregation’s 
current leader, took the leadership position in 
1995. 
Beth Jacob, a vibrant and egalitarian Con-
gregation, is widely known and highly re-
garded for its leadership in progressive actions 
within the Conservative movement. For many 
years, women, LGBTQ individuals, people with 
disabilities and those who are homeless have 
been active and important within the Con-
gregation. In fact, Beth Jacob was the first 
local synagogue to build a ramp so those with 
limited mobility could reach the Torah. Beth 
Jacob strives to see the image of God in 
every person who steps through its doors and 
believes in the importance of honoring dif-
ferences. 
Madam Speaker, we ask our colleagues to 
join us in wishing Congregation Beth Jacob 
many more years of service to our community, 
and in thanking Beth Jacob for 90 years of 
providing a welcoming, safe and joyful place 
of worship to its devoted members. Congrega-
tion Beth Jacob is a beacon of hope in a world 
in need of hope, and a shining jewel in the 
crown of the San Francisco Peninsula.

IN RECOGNITION OF JUDGE ANNA 
FRUSHOUR 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Anna Frushour as she is 
appointed to the 14A District Court judge 
bench. Her dedication to our community is 
worthy of commendation. 
Anna Frushour is a well-respected profes-
sional whose years of legal experience make 
her a qualified addition to the District Court. 
Frushour is an accomplished attorney who is 
a partner at Feiser & Frushour, a law firm that 
contracts with Ann Arbor to represent criminal 
defendants for misdemeanors, and is a private 
practice attorney with Frushour Law. More-
over, she has served as assigned defense 
counsel for the Mental Health Court, Veteran’s 
Treatment Court, Sobriety Court, and Street 
Outreach 
courts 
in 
Washtenaw 
County. 
Frushour earned her Juris Doctor degree from 
Wayne State University and received her 
bachelor’s degree from the University of Michi-
gan. 
On December 17, 2019, Governor Gretchen 
Whitmer appointed Anna Frushour to the 14A 
District Court, and we celebrate her investiture 
today. Frushour will be an exemplary District 
Court judge, exemplified through her positive 
reputation in the community, diligent work 
ethic, and legal expertise. Throughout all of 
her professional pursuits, Frushour has been 
regarded as a fair, dedicated, and humble 
leader who strives for excellence. Her commit-
ment to the law and her entire community will 
enable all to feel that they are heard, re-
spected, and treated with dignity in her court-
room.

HONORING THE REGIONAL PARKS 
FOUNDATION 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Regional 
Parks Foundation on the 50th anniversary of 
its founding. 
Since its establishment in 1969, the Re-
gional Parks Foundation has supported the 
East Bay Regional Park District and its com-
munity. The Foundation serves the vibrant and 
diverse communities of Northern California’s 
East Bay area, including parts of California’s 
Fifth Congressional District. The Regional 
Parks Foundation is deeply committed to mak-
ing parks available and accessible to everyone 
in our community. 
The Regional Parks Foundation works to 
support universal access to parks, promote 
environmental stewardship, organize and fund 
educational and recreational programs and ac-
quire parklands. The foundation provides com-
munity education around important legislative 
initiatives that preserve open space, protect 
our natural resources, and promotes park ac-
cess for under-served populations. 
The Foundation has been instrumental in 
the environmental education and enjoyment of 
citizens of all ages and abilities. The Regional 
Parks Foundation has sent over 10,000 young 
people to environmental education programs 
and has funded thousands of other opportuni-
ties for seniors, veterans, and those living with 
disabilities. The Foundation has fundraised 
nearly $50 million to support our communities 
and parks. These funds enable the foundation 
to provide swim lessons, loan out safety gear, 
organize community tree planting, shoreline 
clean-ups and other environmental restoration 
projects. 
Madam Speaker, the Regional Parks Foun-
dation has been instrumental in supporting the 
betterment and longevity of our open spaces. 
It is therefore fitting and proper that we honor 
the foundation on the 50th anniversary of its 
founding.

CONGRATULATING 
J. 
THOMAS 
MAY ON HIS RECEIPT OF THE 
UNIVERSITY 
OF 
ARKANSAS 
PRESIDENT’S MEDAL FOR SERV-
ICE 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate J. Thomas May for re-
ceiving the University of Arkansas System 
President’s Medal for Service. 
This award is given by the school’s presi-
dent and cabinet to recognize those who have 
‘‘demonstrated a distinguished and sustained 
commitment to helping the UA System carry 
out its mission to the state through their time, 
knowledge, and philanthropy.’’ 
Mr. May has long been a resident of the 
Fourth Congressional district and was pre-
viously the president and CEO of Simmons 
Bank. May is also the only person in Arkansas 
history to have served as both Chairman of 
the Board and Acting President of the Univer-
sity of Arkansas System. His contributions to 
the University of Arkansas for Medical Science 
and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff 
have led to growth, development and suc-
cesses at both institutions. 
His life is an example of servant leadership 
and one of what wise stewardship and grace 
can accomplish in the lives of others. I and the 
rest of the Fourth District of Arkansas are 
proud to call Mr. May one of our own. I take 
this time to congratulate him once again on 
this tremendous honor and to thank him for 
his service to our district and our state.

CHIEF DAN BRENNAN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud retired Wheat 
Ridge Police Chief Dan Brennan on being 
awarded the West Metro Chamber of Com-
merce Steve Burkholder Diamond Legacy 
Award. 
Throughout his career, Chief Brennan left 
his mark on Jefferson County—from the Lake-
wood Police Department, to helping create 
Jeffcom 911 and a regional SWAT Team, to a 
community approach to policing that address-
es the causes of crime, not just the crime. 
Brennan began his 42 years in law enforce-
ment with the Lakewood Police Department 
rising through the ranks from Police Agent to 
Commander. During his career at Lakewood 
Police Department, he worked in multiple posi-
tions where his leadership and dedication to 
the community became apparent. 
After being appointed Chief of the Wheat 
Ridge Police Department in 2005, along with 
other department employees, Brennan devel-
oped a new mission statement for the depart-
ment: Exceptional people providing excep-
tional service. They also established a core 
set of values, with integrity at the core—which 
became Chief Brennan’s mantra for the next 
14+ years. 
At the Wheat Ridge Police Department, he 
led the charge for a community policing ap-
proach to responding to crime, traffic, and 
quality of life issues in the community while 
ensuring all officers and supervisors received 
CIT mental health training and engaging the 
community and stakeholder groups to listen to 
community concerns and feedback. During 
that time, he served on various local, state 
and national boards and committees, including 
as the President of the Colorado Association 
of Chiefs of Police. Throughout his esteemed 
career, he was awarded numerous awards 
and recognitions and was known for always 
trying to do the right thing for the right rea-
sons. 
Chief Brennan’s leadership, compassion, is 
collaboration, and integrity left a positive mark 
on our community for years to come. I extend 
my deepest congratulations to Chief Dan 
Brennan for this well-deserved recognition and 
thank him for his countless contributions to our 
community.

HONORING THE SONOMA VALLEY 
FIREFIGHTER HOLIDAY DINNER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Sonoma 
Valley Firefighter Holiday Dinner and recog-
nize the outstanding efforts of firefighters 
throughout Sonoma Valley. 
At the time, the 2017 North Bay Wildfires 
were the most devastating in our state’s his-
tory. We saw firsthand, that wildfires do not re-
spect district or regional boundaries. In re-
sponse, firefighters from near and far came to-
gether to protect our community. Firefighters 
from all over the valley fought shoulder to 
shoulder to save lives and property, risking 
their own lives along the way. Our entire com-
munity, both firefighters and civilians alike, left 
with a renewed sense of comradery and part-
nership that continues to permeate the area 
today. 
Following this extraordinary united effort, the 
Glen Ellen Volunteer Firefighter Association 
extended their annual holiday celebration to 
their teammates, past and present, from the 
entire Sonoma Valley Fire and Rescue Author-
ity, as well as the Kenwood and Mayacamas 
volunteer stations. The holiday dinner honors 
the incredible sacrifices made by the entire fire 
community and is a joy to all who participate. 
The dinner brings together all current volun-
teer and career firefighters, department board 
members, retired chiefs, battalion chiefs, and 
their spouses. Meals are prepared and deliv-
ered to the on-duty firefighters staffing their 
stations. It is a time to honor past leadership, 
reflect on the year’s successes, and support 
the Explorer program to help develop future 
staff. Additionally, there is an opportunity to 
recognize spouses, widows, and families, as it 
takes an entire village to support those on the 
front line. 
Madam Speaker, the Sonoma Valley fire 
agencies are always ready to help and protect 
our community. Their unparalleled commit-
ment to protecting Sonoma Valley makes 
them a model for the region. It is therefore fit-
ting and proper that we honor them here 
today.
