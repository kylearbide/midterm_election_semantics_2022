HONORING BOB STACEY’S 
DISTINGUISHED CAREER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
Portland Metro Councilor Bob Stacey 
announced he is going to retire next 
month. To say Bob is an unsung hero is 
true only for those who were never 
privileged to work with Bob or watch 
him in action. He is a hero in every 
sense of the word and the quintessen-
tial champion for livability in our com-
munity—and not just for Oregon—be-
cause his long and distinguished career 
earned him a national reputation. 
I have had the special privilege to 
work with Bob in every facet of his dis-
tinguished career. As a young legis-
lator, he worked to enact Oregon’s 
landmark land use legislation; and 
Bob, as a young attorney for the One 
Thousand Friends of Oregon, fought to 
establish and protect Oregon’s iconic 
land use legislation with pioneers like 
Henry Richmond, Dick Benner, and 
Richard Whitman—true Oregon pio-
neers. His work put him into direct 
conflict with the cult, the Rajneeshees, 
who at that point had taken over the 
central Oregon town of Antelope. They 
actually tried to poison him as he had 
the courage to stand up for the integ-
rity of local government and land use 
planning. 
When I was elected to the Portland 
City Council and became the commis-
sioner of public works, Bob was my 
chief of staff helping to manage a di-
verse portfolio of critical bureaus in-
cluding planning, transportation, and 
environmental services. He was direc-
tor of the Portland Planning Bureau 
for 
over 
5 
years 
with 
landmark 
achievements including the Central 
City Plan and the Albina Community 
Plan during a very challenging time for 
the city financially. And Bob was re-
spected and beloved by the planning 
bureau staff. He was tireless and cre-
ative. 
He spent a period of time in private 
practice I think just to figure out what 
it was like. He served as a special ad-
viser to Governor Barbara Roberts. He 
was executive director at our regional 
transportation agency TriMet, director 
of planning and policy, and then he was 
executive director of the One Thousand 
Friends of Oregon, the watchdog group 
committed to protecting the integrity 
of our land use. 
He barely lost a race for the metro 
council president but then went on to 
serve three terms as a councilor where 
he was insightful and influential for 
our entire region. He has been a 
thought leader in all things that mat-
ter—environmental 
protection, 
land 
use, climate, traffic congestion, afford-
able housing, air quality, and economic 
development. He was always clear-eyed 
and visionary, but thoughtful, all while 
being one of the nicest people, Madam 
Speaker, you would ever want to meet. 
He is stepping down in a few days to 
deal with some health issues, and while 
I will miss him, it is important that he 
take care of himself. 
Oregon thanks Bob for an exemplary 
achievement in public service in his 
own quiet, thoughtful way. He has been 
a key part of all the important issues 
in our region for almost half a century, 
and I thank him for his lifetime of pub-
lic service.

HIPPOCRATIC 
OATH: 
THE 
CON-
GRESS’ 
COLLECTIVE 
CON-
SCIENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, as a physician, I took the Hip-
pocratic oath to first do no harm. That 
means caring for the sick and pro-
tecting 
those 
who 
cannot 
protect 
themselves. That means fighting to 
protect the unborn. 
Sadly, not all Members of Congress 
share that commitment. Right now, 
liberals in this body are attempting to 
repeal the Hyde amendment which pro-
hibits tax dollars from funding abor-
tions. Worse, they are attempting to 
legalize abortions on demand until the 
moment of birth. While science tells us 
that the unborn baby is a human life 
and deserves protection, our collective 
conscience should motivate us to pro-
tect these unborn children. 
We owe it to the American people to 
defend the sanctity of life. We owe it to

them to protect the most vulnerable 
among us. As a doctor and as a legis-
lator, I will always stand for life. 
STRONG AMERICAN MILITARY 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, as Congress prepares to con-
sider the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, our Nation continues to face 
national security threats abroad. I am 
proud that this legislation protects our 
military 
from 
the 
administration’s 
reckless spending cuts that would have 
made Americans less safe. It also pro-
vides a 2.7 percent pay raise for our Na-
tion’s servicemembers and protects 
their right to personal expression. 
This bill would allow our troops to 
make their own choice on whether to 
receive the COVID–19 vaccine. It would 
prohibit them from being dishonorably 
discharged 
for 
making 
their 
own 
healthcare 
decisions. 
Furthermore, 
this legislation would increase security 
on our southern border. It acknowl-
edges the record number of illegal 
crossings which is truly a national se-
curity crisis. 
With the threat of global terrorism 
on the rise, now is not the time to 
allow our borders to be more vulner-
able. President Reagan once said that 
we 
maintain 
peace 
through 
our 
strength and that weakness only in-
vites aggression. 
Now is the time for a strong United 
States military. Now is the time for 
that peace through strength. And now 
is the time to pass the National De-
fense Authorization Act and to con-
tinue to protect each and every Amer-
ican. 
f 
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, women’s freedom to choose their re-
productive care is under attack by poli-
ticians who want to control their deci-
sions. 
A woman’s freedom to make a deci-
sion on this very private, personal mat-
ter should be respected and should be 
left to her alone together with her fam-
ily and her doctor and guided by her 
faith. 
Politicians and government should 
have no control. Yet 3 weeks ago, my 
home State of Texas passed one of the 
strictest abortion bills in the country 
which on its face is unconstitutional. 
Politicians in Texas are trying to 
control women’s freedom to choose and 
the progress that we have made in the 
last 50 years. It also allows anyone— 
anyone—in the country to file a law-
suit against a provider, family, friend, 
clergy, Uber driver, Lyft driver, and 
anyone who assists a woman seeking 
an abortion. If successful, the plaintiffs 
get $10,000. 
In fact, just last week two individ-
uals, not even from Texas, filed law-
suits against a doctor from San Anto-
nio who publicly acknowledged that he 
had performed an abortion outside the 
legal limits of this Texas law. One of 
the plaintiffs even admitted that his 
reason for filing this suit was the 
$10,000 bounty. He needed the money. 
This is outrageous and must be 
stopped. Texas already has some of the 
most restrictive abortion laws in the 
country. 
Before this law entered into effect, 
my 
home 
State 
already 
required 
women to get mandatory sonograms, 
and we also have a 24-hour waiting pe-
riod. Now this law makes existing re-
strictions even worse. 
Texas has almost 7 million women 
aged 15 to 49 out of a total of 75 million 
in this age group in the entire country. 
So we make up now one in ten of the 
U.S. women of reproductive age. All 
these women all over Texas now have 
no choices. Now, effectively, Roe v. 
Wade is meaningless. 
Madam Speaker, women’s freedom to 
choose what to do with their bodies is 
hanging by a thread, and Congress 
can’t sit idle. 
Last week, I visited Planned Parent-
hood’s headquarters in my district and 
heard horrific stories about how this 
draconian law is affecting women in 
my region. 
On September 1, the day that Texas 
law took effect, one Texas woman 
learned she was about 5 weeks preg-
nant—and still within the new legal 
limits in the Texas law to obtain an 
abortion in Texas. But at the same 
visit she also learned that she had 
COVID–19. By the time she would finish 
her quarantine period it would be too 
late to get an abortion in Texas and 
she would then have to go out of State 
for care. 
On September 2, Planned Parenthood 
providers 
saw 
a 
patient 
for 
an 
ultrasound that showed she was under 6 
weeks and still within the new legal 
limits of the Texas law. When she came 
back the next day after the State man-
dated 24-hour waiting period, the sec-
ond sonogram showed she had passed 
the new legal limit. Overnight she lost 
access to an abortion in Texas. 
Here is another story. A few days 
after the Texas law took effect, a 
woman walked into the Planned Par-
enthood’s health center after trying to 
self-manage an abortion. Having no 
money or resources, she had turned to 
the internet where she found some 
abortion tea. She took it, and it didn’t 
work. The ultrasound showed she was 
past the new legal limit, and doctors in 
Texas couldn’t help her. She too was 
now forced to seek care out of State or 
to continue with her pregnancy. 
Then, Madam Speaker, I am sure you 
heard about tropical storm Nicholas. 
The storm made landfall during some 
patients’ State mandated 24-hour wait-
ing period. They were hunkered down. 
They couldn’t get to the clinic, and the 
clinic was closed. They lost their right 
to an abortion during that time period. 
Another case I heard of was from a 
44-year-old patient, already a parent, 
who didn’t think she could have any 
more children but learned that she was 
pregnant at 7 weeks, just past the legal 
limits of the new Texas law. This pa-
tient was never planning to stay with 
her current partner and now, due to 
this pregnancy, feels pressured to re-
main in that relationship. 
Madam Speaker, these cases are 
heartbreaking, and I am sure we will 
hear more and worse because women’s 
lives are at risk. And although I am en-
couraged to know the Justice Depart-
ment is acting on this, Congress needs 
to act, and this is why we must pass 
H.R. 3755.

HONORING LARRY JOE 
ALEXANDER OF JERSEYVILLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor 
of Larry Joe Alexander of Jerseyville 
who passed away on September 6 at the 
age of 57. 
After graduating from Jersey Com-
munity High School, Larry attended 
Worsham College of Mortuary Science 
and obtained his degree in funeral di-
recting and embalming. 
Larry married his true love, Julie 
Ann Calvey, in 1989. After building a 
beautiful life together, Julie passed 
away on May 14, 2016, after a brave bat-
tle with cancer. 
In 1985 Larry started his career in the 
funeral home business. In 1992 Larry 
was elected as the Jersey County Cor-
oner and continued to hold that office 
until his death. Larry was a member of 
the First Assembly of God church in 
Jerseyville, the Jersey County Repub-
lican Party, the Shriners, Full Moon 
Masonic Lodge 341, the Scottish Rite, 
and many other organizations. 
His passing is a loss for the 13th Dis-
trict and everyone who had the pleas-
ure of knowing him. In the past few 
months, Larry and his daughters have 
been in the process of creating a schol-
arship in his wife, Julie’s, memory. His 
daughter, Alyssa, and niece, Kari Jo, 
have decided to honor both their par-
ents with a joint education scholar-
ship. 
Shannon and I send our thoughts and 
prayers to Alyssa, Kari Jo, and the rest 
of Larry’s family. 
Larry, may you rest in peace my 
friend.

HONORING THE DISTINGUISHED SERVICE OF 
WILLIAM HAINE 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
my good friend, William Haine, for his 
distinguished service to the State of Il-
linois and the American people. 
Bill was born in Alton in 1944. He at-
tended St. Patrick’s Grade School and 
Marquette High School in Alton, and 
received a Bachelor’s Degree from St. 
Louis University. Soon after, he en-
listed and served in Vietnam as a mem-
ber of the First Cavalry Division, earn-
ing the Bronze Star for Meritorious 
Service in Combat Operations.

H4869 
September 22, 2021 
After returning home from Vietnam, 
he earned his juris doctorate from St. 
Louis University, where he met his fu-
ture wife, Anna. 
Bill began his career as a clerk for 
George Moran of the Fifth Appellate 
Court District. He soon became an as-
sistant public defender while entering 
into private practice. Bill’s illustrious 
career of public service began with his 
election to the Madison County Board. 
He was then elected to multiple terms 
as the Madison County State’s Attor-
ney and eventually as a State Senator 
in the 13th District. At the time of 
Bill’s passing just a few weeks ago, he 
was serving on the Illinois State Board 
of Elections. 
Bill was a member of many civic and 
religious organizations, including the 
Knights of Columbus, the Equestrian 
Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jeru-
salem, and the American Legion and 
VFW. 
One of my favorite stories about Sen-
ator Haine was when he and his family 
and his wife, Anna, came to tour Wash-
ington, D.C., and I had a chance to 
take him on the House floor here and 
on the Senate floor where Bill, who 
wasn’t in the best health when he 
came, decided to sit down in the Sen-
ate, and an overzealous Senate staffer 
came out and said: ‘‘I’m sorry, but that 
chair is reserved for a Senator.’’ And 
Bill said: ‘‘I’m a Senator.’’ 
And I happily reminded that over-
zealous staffer at the time that it was 
actually a staff member’s chair and 
Bill was okay sitting there while we 
showed the glorious splendor of what 
we get to see every day. 
Shannon, my kids, we send our heart-
felt prayers to his wife, his seven chil-
dren, his 38 grandchildren, and his 
great grandchild. 
Bill’s commitment to public service 
was second to none. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF JOE CHAMPLEY 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize one of my best friends in the 
world, Joe Champley, who was honored 
as Taylorville Junior High School’s 
Teacher of the Month for September. 
Joe has over 30 years of experience 
serving as a teacher, coach, mentor, 
and friend to so many in our commu-
nity. 
Joe received Taylorville Junior High 
School’s Red Apple Award which hon-
ors his outstanding dedication to stu-
dents and staff. As an instructor, his 
compassion and care for kids is un-
matched, as is his humor. He teaches 
because he believes teachers can make 
a difference in kids’ lives, and he hopes 
to lead them down the right path. And 
I can count countless numbers of kids 
who have gone through the junior high 
school that I went to who Joe has 
helped. 
One of his fondest memories is when 
he introduced the Illinois Secretary of 
State, Jesse White, and all the stu-
dents chanted ‘‘Champley needs a 
raise. Champley needs a raise.’’ 
Joe graduated from our high school, 
Taylorville High School, in 1985, after 
having an outstanding career in ath-
letics. During Joe’s tenure as a three- 
year starter on the basketball team, 
the Tornadoes won an Apollo Con-
ference Championship and a regional 
championship; and he happens to still 
be 16th on the all-time Tornadoes scor-
ing list. 
The Taylorville community, my com-
munity, is honored to have leaders like 
Joe Champley. Joe is somebody who 
has made a difference in so many lives, 
and he is going to continue to do that 
for many years to come. 
I wish you the best, Joe, my friend.

REBUILDING OF AMERICA BEGINS 
NOW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, we feel the 
wind of history at our back this week 
and next. This has been a long time 
coming. Not since the mid-1960s have 
we had such an opportunity to do so 
many big, bold, and historic things as 
we have in front of us right now; things 
like paid family leave; modernizing and 
rebuilding our K–12 public schools, tui-
tion-free community college, universal 
pre-K; and injecting the single biggest 
investment in our infrastructure in our 
Nation’s history, roads, bridges, rail, 
replacing water and sewer lines that 
have been there for over a century, 
taking out old gas lines that are dan-
gerous, leaded pipes that have literally 
cost lives. 
This is all right in front of us right 
now, and here in the House, it hangs by 
perhaps a few votes. Just one or two 
votes may make the critical difference. 
Every single one of these measures I 
mentioned is popular, every single one. 
And it is not just Democrats. Sixty-six 
percent of Americans support the pack-
age I just described. That includes 61 
percent of Independents, and even 39 
percent of Republicans. 
The American people get it. They 
recognize that we must rebuild Amer-
ica, rebuild our infrastructure in terms 
of our physical infrastructure and the 
infrastructure of our society. 
Now, some might ask, understand-
ably, okay, all these things sound 
great, but how are you going to pay for 
it? 
Well, in the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, we just put our money where 
our mouth is. We just put up vote after 
vote to raise taxes on the richest one- 
tenth of 1 percent; to raise the revenue 
necessary to fund every single one of 
the priorities that I just described. 
I understand there are those who 
want to keep things as they are; who 
don’t believe we should invest in our 
infrastructure; don’t believe we should 
have paid family leave, even though 
the rest of the industrialized world has 
it and has for decades; don’t believe 
that we should have funding for child 
care. 
They want to keep the system the 
way it is. They like the idea that there 
was just a $2 trillion tax cut under the 
previous administration, none of it 
paid for and, according to CBO, 83 per-
cent of it going to the richest 1 per-
cent. They are fine with that. 
But in terms of reforming our tax 
system to make the richest Americans 
pay their fair share and to use that 
money to invest in the American peo-
ple, they are opposed to that. 
Well, I proudly support it. This will 
be one of the best votes I cast in my ca-
reer. This is an exciting, truly trans-
formative time in our Nation’s history. 
It is now incumbent upon all of us in 
the House, all of us in the Senate, to 
seize this moment. The rebuilding of 
America begins now. 
f 
ISRAEL’S IRON DOME 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, Israel’s 
Iron Dome has saved countless lives 
from barrages of missiles launched by 
Hamas. 
One would think that the majority 
would understand this fact and recog-
nize the Iron Dome’s significance. How-
ever, after caving to the demands of 
several of their own fringe members 
yesterday, it is clear they don’t have a 
clue. 
Israel has always been a longstanding 
ally to the United States, and now is 
not the time to turn our back on Israel. 
Madam Speaker, without question, 
House Republicans are proud to stand 
with Israel and the Jewish community. 
Our alliance with them is a testament 
to our shared values, and it should not 
be forsaken under any circumstance. 
WASHINGTON LIBERALS’ PERNICIOUS GRASP 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, there is 
no issue small enough to escape Wash-
ington liberals’ pernicious grasp. For 
one, anonymous bureaucrats demand 
disgustingly low levels of salt and fat 
in school lunches even though dieti-
cians acknowledge these ingredients 
are part of a well-balanced diet. 
House Democrats have also passed a 
bill that would skim the top off work-
ers’ paychecks to line the pockets of 
union bosses, even though those work-
ers are not even union members. 
And most recently, Congressional 
Democrats are pushing a $3.5 trillion 
socialist wish list, which the New York 
Times said ‘‘would touch virtually 
every American’s life, from conception 
to aged infirmity.’’ 
While these micromanagers are busy 
finding new ways to interfere in your 
personal decisions, dangerous totali-
tarian nations like China, Russia, and 
Iran threaten individual liberties and 
global prosperity. Democrats ought to 
turn their attention to these existen-
tial concerns instead of seeking to im-
pose their agenda on free Americans. 
NOW IS THE TIME FOR ANSWERS 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, the 
American 
people 
deserve 
to 
know

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4870 
September 22, 2021 
about the failures that led up to the 
disastrous 
Afghanistan 
withdrawal. 
This is an issue that cannot be swept 
under the rug and forgotten. Unfortu-
nately, this administration has already 
decided to move on and look the other 
way. 
Thirteen patriots lost their lives just 
a few short weeks ago, and countless 
Americans who wanted to leave were 
left behind. The whole world watched 
this 
crisis 
grow, 
and 
America’s 
strengths and leadership were called 
into question by our closest allies. This 
crisis should have never unfolded the 
way it did. 
Now is the time for answers, Madam 
Speaker. The American people demand 
them and the world expects them. 
REAL COST OF INFLATION 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, Amer-
ican families are feeling the immense 
strain that has been caused by Presi-
dent Biden’s economic crisis. From the 
gas pumps to the grocery store, prices 
for even the most basic commodities 
are skyrocketing to obscene levels. 
The cost of gasoline is up almost 43 
percent. The cost of beef is up almost 
12 percent. The cost of propane is up al-
most 23 percent. Even the prices of 
used cars are up almost 45 percent. 
Madam Speaker, increased spending 
by the Federal Government is not a 
remedy to solve this crisis, nor is a $3.5 
trillion spending bill that will cripple 
the American economy even further. 
Congress must get its fiscal house in 
order. 
f 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
INITIATIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
last week, the Ways and Means Com-
mittee on which I sit, along with nu-
merous 
other 
committees 
in 
this 
House, moved forward toward com-
pleting our work to achieve President 
Biden’s and the American people’s vi-
sion to build back better. 
The legislation contains economic 
development initiatives that I have 
long championed to create good-paying 
jobs, while lowering costs and cutting 
taxes for American families, not Amer-
ican wealthy. This is the kind of legis-
lation that makes America great. This 
is the kind of legislation that assures 
the American people that we have not 
abandoned them in their time of need. 
To remain the greatest Nation, we 
must support the most vulnerable por-
tion of America. 
Importantly, for my district, this bill 
contains specific measures for the 
much-needed economic recovery of the 
U.S. territories, which have been se-
verely tried in recent years. It fixes 
longstanding fiscal cliffs related to re-
bate on Federal excise taxes on dis-
tilled spirits production in the terri-
tories, our rum cover over. The cover 
over has been a part of the funda-
mental tax relationship between the 
United States and its island territories 
before there was even an income tax. 
This bill would repeal the cap that has 
been imposed on the program since 
1984. 
In addition, we are continuing to ex-
pand the federally funded Child Tax 
Credit, including reimbursing the Is-
lands’ government who pay out the 
costs for providing the credit. The 
credit, as expanded in the American 
Rescue Plan, would be continued for 
additional 4 years. 
This child tax cut has cut child pov-
erty by 50 percent, 50 percent. Cutting 
child poverty by the child tax cut 
makes economic sense. 
Under the Annie E. Casey Founda-
tion study, America has lost $500 bil-
lion a year in lost production due to 
children who have lived in poverty 
most of their life because of hunger, 
leading to loss of jobs, school dropouts, 
prison, all of these things will now 
have a way for these children to come 
out. 
Furthermore, we are extending the 
changes made to the Earned Income 
Tax Credit in the American Rescue 
Plan. We increase the value of the 
Earned Income Tax Credit for workers 
with no qualifying dependents, and we 
do that on a permanent basis in Build 
Back Better. 
b 1030 
In 
addition, 
we 
are 
providing 
lookback provisions that are necessary 
for individuals. This important part of 
the earned income tax credit is pre-
mised on the idea that if a taxpayer’s 
earned income was less in a given year 
than it is in the prior year, the tax-
payer may elect to use their prior 
year’s earned income in computing the 
EITC. 
That 
is, 
this 
is 
a 
1-year 
lookback. This will provide stability to 
taxpayers who have experienced eco-
nomic shocks in any given year, the 
same way we do for businesses. 
This legislation provides much-need-
ed relief to the U.S. territories from 
the GILTI tax that was supposed to 
apply to foreign jurisdictions. Since 
2017, there have been significant con-
cerns about the application of the 
GILTI tax to sovereign territories of 
the United States, including the U.S. 
Virgin Islands as well as the other ter-
ritories, flowing from the treatment of 
U.S. territories under the Internal Rev-
enue Code. 
I am pleased to see the additional ac-
commodations to smaller-sized busi-
nesses and the economic activity that 
will allow jobs and incomes to flourish. 
For these employers, the possessions 
wage credit would be increased from 20 
percent to 50 percent of eligible posses-
sions wages and allocable fringe bene-
fits for each employee. With these en-
hanced credits, the Ways and Means 
Committee acted to provide relief to 
service-based economies. 
I am also excited about the proactive 
support for disaster resilience. We are 
providing tools to mitigate the impact 
of natural disasters by providing incen-
tives for upfront investments. 
We are providing strong incentives to 
attract capital and promote jobs in 
communities that need it the most, 
significant resources for rural areas, 
Tribal communities, and underserved 
minority communities. 
We have affordable housing to help 
reduce housing inequality and path-
ways to homeownership, which is about 
wealth creation in this country. 
Democrats have heard the needs and 
desires of the American people, all 
American people—Democrats, Repub-
licans, 
independents, 
rural, 
urban, 
small town, islands even. We are here 
to help you.

BIDEN’S BORDER CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to discuss the cri-
sis along our southwest border during 
the ongoing public health emergency. 
Last year, the Department of Home-
land Security Office of Inspector Gen-
eral released a report titled ‘‘DHS 
Needs to Enhance Its COVID–19 Re-
sponse at the Southwest Border.’’ The 
DHS OIG findings highlight what Re-
publicans have been saying for 7 
months, that U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection does not conduct COVID–19 
testing for migrants who enter CBP 
custody and is not required to do so. 
Further, the report notes that with-
out 
stronger 
COVID–19 
prevention 
measures in place, DHS is putting its 
workforce, support staff, border com-
munities, and all communities and mi-
grants at greater risk of contracting 
the virus. 
It is our responsibility in Congress to 
ensure that our frontline workforce, in-
cluding the brave men and women of 
CBP, who put their lives on the line 
daily, are adequately protected. 
More than 6 months ago, I introduced 
my first piece of legislation, the 
REACT Act, which would require the 
Department of Homeland Security to 
test all migrants illegally crossing our 
border who they plan to release into 
our communities. In March, I offered to 
bring the REACT Act to the floor for a 
vote, but it was rejected by the major-
ity. 
Simultaneously, we are seeing the 
majority prepare to spend $3.5 trillion, 
mortgaging our children’s and grand-
children’s futures. 
Let’s be clear that none of the money 
in this tax-and-spend package would go 
to CBP. This is while the DHS OIG 
heard from CBP officials that they do 
not have the necessary resources to 
conduct COVID–19 testing. Yet, many 
on the other side remain unconcerned 
about the lack of testing along our 
southern border. 
In August, more than 208,000 mi-
grants were encountered along the 
southwest border. This means each day

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4871 
September 22, 2021 
approximately 6,700 individuals were 
encountered. 
To put this in perspective, President 
Obama’s Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity, Jeh Johnson, stated in his tenure 
that 1,000 apprehensions a day was con-
sidered a bad day. We are more than six 
times that now, and on top of it, we 
face a global pandemic. 
We are currently watching a debacle 
unfold in Del Rio, Texas, where this 
weekend alone there were estimated to 
be approximately 15,000 migrants cross-
ing the Rio Grande. This surge is over-
whelming an already overburdened sys-
tem, and the agents and officers of CBP 
need Congress to focus on this crisis. 
While it is promising that CBP will 
be surging resources to the area, it re-
mains extremely worrisome to me 
that, as the OIG found, CBP is not re-
quired to test these migrants. And I 
understand there is also a measles out-
break at Fort Bliss. 
Moreover, we will continue to see the 
border crisis of varying scales until we 
institute policies that will deter illegal 
immigration. 
Programs such as the Migrant Pro-
tection Protocols and Title 42 health 
restrictions should be utilized to stem 
the flow of illegal migration and help 
keep our communities safe during the 
pandemic. 
Notably, the DHS OIG report also 
states that the ‘‘erosion of Title 42 au-
thority has had a significant negative 
impact on CBP’s COVID–19 mitigation 
measures and creates increased risk.’’ 
I encourage this administration to 
continue to implement these health re-
strictions for migrants crossing ille-
gally, especially while we see new 
variants emerging. 
As the former director of the Iowa 
Department of Public Health, I know 
we must ensure that any individuals 
the Biden administration insists on re-
leasing into our communities do not 
have COVID–19 or other infectious dis-
eases. In fact, the Biden administration 
is recognizing the need for COVID–19 
testing and vaccinations for another 
group of individuals, those who are 
being paroled in from Afghanistan. 
I cannot comprehend how we can vac-
cinate those individuals for not only 
COVID–19 but also measles, mumps, ru-
bella, polio, and any other age-appro-
priate vaccinations that are required 
by the CDC but not those coming 
across our border illegally. 
It is clear that this administration is 
creating a double standard not only for 
U.S. citizens and migrants but also for 
individuals they are bringing into this 
country. 
If I may, I will also add a boisterous 
happy birthday to my husband, Curt.

RECOGNIZING KMPH TELEVISION’S 
50TH ANNIVERSARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a significant mile-
stone for one of the local news stations 
in my hometown and district in Fres-
no, California. KMPH Television is 
celebrating 50 years of TV program-
ming and broadcast news excellence. 
First taking the air in 1971, by the 
Pappas family, KMPH launched its 
news department 7 years later, serving 
as a vital source of information for 
viewers across the Central Valley. 
It has not been an easy time for jour-
nalists in the last decade throughout 
our 
country. 
Nearly 
one-fourth 
of 
America’s newspapers have shuttered 
their operations, and a significant por-
tion of print and TV journalists, sadly, 
have lost their jobs. This leaves many 
smaller stations with fewer reporters 
to inform the public on what is hap-
pening in their communities. Getting 
local news is so critical to having an 
informed public. 
KMPH is no stranger to these chal-
lenges, but it continues to thrive, 
make a difference, and inform the pub-
lic. 
A free press, as we all know, is the 
cornerstone of our democracy. Local 
news plays an integral role in shaping 
America, keeping people informed, and 
allowing 
them 
to 
be 
active 
in 
participatory democracy. 
During a time of disinformation— 
sadly, these days—in social media, I 
think supporting local journalism has 
never been more critical. 
Fifty years of public service is worth 
celebrating. Congratulations to KMPH 
in Fresno for 50 years of informing the 
public. 
CELEBRATING HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate Hispanic Heritage 
Month, to honor the cultures, history, 
and achievements of the Hispanic com-
munity, both in my district and across 
the country, for generations. 
Throughout the last year, every seg-
ment of our society has been impacted 
by the COVID pandemic. Certainly, 
Hispanic Americans have felt this im-
pact as well, but they have worked 
hard to do their part. 
Many of them are essential workers 
who have to be on their job every day, 
like the farmworkers, some of the 
hardest working people you will ever 
meet in your life, putting food on 
America’s dinner table every night. 
Some are healthcare workers—doctors, 
nurses, technicians, first responders— 
and they risk their lives every day 
doing their jobs and putting their fami-
lies at risk. 
Every day, the Hispanic-American 
community’s quest for the American 
Dream has impacted our communities. 
They are living the American Dream of 
immigrants 
past 
and 
immigrants 
present. 
There are examples such as the Fres-
no Area Hispanic Foundation, where 
over 320 female small business owners 
have participated in the Latinapreneur 
and Womanpreneur programs to grow 
their small businesses, creating jobs 
and creating vital economic activity. 
Other individuals historically have 
played a role and have been barrier- 
breakers, like our valley’s own Coach 
Tom Flores, son of migrant workers in 
the San Joaquin Valley. He spent 30 
years in the NFL, as the first Hispanic 
quarterback and then coaching and be-
coming the first Hispanic Super Bowl 
champion. Just a month ago, Coach 
Flores was inducted into the NFL Hall 
of Fame for these achievements. 
We have so many others who have 
made a difference, such as my dear 
friend Joseph Castro from Hanford, 
California, who is today chancellor of 
the California State University Sys-
tem, the largest public university sys-
tem in America. We also have Juan 
Sanchez Munoz, who is chancellor of 
UC Merced, one of the newest univer-
sities in America, making a difference. 
In addition, my neighbor, Dr. Saul Ji-
menez-Sandoval, is the newest presi-
dent of Fresno State University. Go 
Dogs. 
All of these individuals have played a 
role. All have unique stories and ca-
reers. They have helped to educate and 
create new opportunities, and they 
serve as a role model for future leaders. 
But we must not forget that many in 
our Hispanic community live in fear of 
attaining these important goals. 
Over the past few years, I have met 
with DACA students across my district 
to hear their stories and discuss the 
need 
for 
immigration 
reform. 
For 
them, America is the only country 
they have really known, and so immi-
gration reform is so critical. 
As we commemorate this month, let 
us not forget that they are counting on 
Congress to bring about comprehensive 
immigration reform. 
As a proud member of the Hispanic 
Caucus, I work with my colleagues 
every day to ensure the promise of 
America is accessible to the 62 million 
Hispanics living across the country. 
f 
MILITARY NEEDS LARGER PAY 
INCREASE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on an 
important facet of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2022. While I am pleased that the NDAA 
bill delivers good top-line and procure-
ment financial support for our Nation’s 
defense capabilities, the bill is not per-
fect. 
Specifically, I want to share my frus-
tration with the bill’s failure to prop-
erly increase our Nation’s military 
pay, specifically for our enlisted per-
sonnel. The 2.7 percent pay increase for 
our military servicemembers is simply 
not enough. Throughout today, during 
the debate over the NDAA, we will hear 
Members from both sides of the aisle 
talk about the 2.7 percent, almost tout-
ing this. 
I want to put this in perspective. For 
the average junior enlisted personnel 
member, this translates to roughly 
$1.80 a day more for their service. This

September 22, 2021 
is unsatisfactory, especially given the 
gap between military pay and their ci-
vilian counterparts is currently at an 
all-time high. 
The reality is that many of our U.S. 
servicemembers 
and 
their 
families 
must serve 3 years and gain the rank of 
E4 before they can be at or above most 
States’ minimum wage. This is also 
based on the assumption that they are 
working only 40 hours a week, which 
we all know is not true. Most service-
members are actually working 50 to 60 
hours per week, given the current oper-
ational tempo worldwide. 
We should never have to discuss food 
insecurities for those protecting our se-
curity, but the reality is that we have 
a significant percentage of service-
members and their families who actu-
ally qualify for food stamps. This is un-
acceptable. We should start by paying 
them an adequate amount of base pay 
and avoid the burden of food stamps for 
our military. 
Earlier this year, during committee 
markup of the FY22 Defense appropria-
tions bill, I offered an amendment that 
would ensure that all servicemembers 
make the equivalent of $15 an hour, or 
$31,200 a year, in base pay. These are 
not seismic numbers. These are not 
numbers we, as a Nation, cannot af-
ford. 
b 1045 
When considering the 2.7 percent pay 
increase included in the FY22 NDAA, 
we must realize that this would still 
leave many servicemembers below that 
$15 minimum that I advocated for in 
July. Not to mention, the 2.7 percent 
pay increase actually falls below the 
current inflation rate, so they are ac-
tually losing ground relative to current 
prices. It also fails to keep pace with 
servicemembers’ pay relative to their 
civilian counterparts. 
If we want to attract and retain the 
requisite skill sets and warriors needed 
in a complex battle space against a 
threat like China, we need to be willing 
to pay our troops a living wage. In the 
grand scheme of things, this pay raise 
for our enlisted ranks is extremely af-
fordable. It not only pays for our serv-
icemembers and their families, but also 
deepens and solidifies our Nation’s se-
curity. This is a priceless return on a 
relatively small investment. 
While the amendment I offered to the 
FY22 NDAA bill was not included in 
the final bill, I secured a commitment 
from Defense Subcommittee Chair-
woman BETTY
MCCOLLUM
that she 
would create a working group to find a 
way to address the necessary military 
pay raise in conference negotiations 
with the Senate, and I appreciate the 
Chairwoman’s willingness to work with 
me on this issue. 
Let me be clear: While the FY22 
NDAA is not perfect and it does not 
properly raise our military’s pay, I 
plan to support the overall bill as it 
does make important strides to provide 
a large majority of the necessary fund-
ing and, frankly, the initiatives that 
our Nation’s military needs. I also 
promise to continue to work on ensur-
ing our servicemembers receive the pay 
raises that they actually deserve. 
After 20 years of unprecedented de-
ployment cycles during the global war 
on terror, now is the time to invest in 
our precious servicemembers and their 
families who provide our beautiful na-
tion its security blanket on a daily 
basis. $15 an hour or $31,000 a year is a 
reasonable minimum base salary for 
our troops.

DOLLY PARTON AND THE HOT 
FERC SUMMER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. CASTEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to declare for now the end of Hot FERC 
Summer. 
Sixty-four days ago I kicked off Hot 
FERC Summer with Megan Thee Stal-
lion and then Fergie to elevate the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-
sion’s critical role in solving the cli-
mate crisis, and to urge the White 
House to nominate a fifth FERC com-
missioner. 
Some, even in this Chamber, have la-
mented the bad dad jokes and puns, 
and many have asked what does this 
have to do with climate change? 
Here’s the thing. For far too long we 
have just used FERC’s mind and we 
never gave them credit. And, frankly, 
allowing the most important Federal 
agency to fight climate change to con-
tinue to go unnoticed and short staffed, 
well, that would have driven me crazy, 
if I had let it. 
I am thrilled to report that the Presi-
dent has embraced that Hot FERC 
Summer spirit and nominated Willie 
Phillips, taking us one step closer to 
restoring FERC to its full strength, en-
abling us to make this transition to 
clean energy at the pace the climate 
crisis demands. 
Those commissioners and their hard-
working, underappreciated staff, they 
are FERCalicious. 
But they can’t start working yet, and 
that is why today I am calling on my 
Senate colleagues to prioritize the con-
firmation hearings for Mr. Phillips so 
that he can start FERCing 9 to 5. 
You see, when you tumble out of bed 
and stumble to the kitchen, pour your-
self a cup of that ambition, your alarm 
clock, the lights, the hot coffee, they 
are in part, in no small part, thanks to 
the folks at FERC who are working to 
ensure that robust transmission sys-
tem that we take for granted every 
day. 
And when you jump in the shower 
hot enough that your blood starts 
pumping and drive out to the street be-
fore the traffic starts jumping, the 
charging networks for all those electric 
vehicles that stay cheap and reliable 
are also thanks to the folks FERCing 9 
to 5. 
FERCing 9 to 5, what a way to save 
the planet. We will not slow down this 
rapid 
acceleration 
of 
devastating 
wildfires, hurricanes, heat waves and 
blackouts that have already impacted 
one in three Americans this summer 
until we build out a zero-carbon energy 
system. With FERC’s help, we can turn 
this ship around, if we let it. 
FERCing 9 to 5, what a way to save 
the economy. Every day FERC helps 
make sure that energy isn’t just a rich 
man’s game. They have the ability and 
the authority to bring about this clean 
energy transition while keeping our en-
ergy markets competitive, reliable, 
and affordable to make sure that your 
utility isn’t just taking without giving. 
So why FERC? Couldn’t we just do 
this in Congress? 
Well, 
as 
long 
as 
the 
Senate 
prioritizes the preservation of the fili-
buster over the preservation of the 
planet, a fully staffed, climate-focused 
FERC will remain the most powerful, 
most important, and maybe the only 
tool we have to get to a low-cost, zero- 
carbon economy at the pace that the 
crisis demands. 
But let’s be clear: Getting FERC 
fully staffed is necessary but insuffi-
cient. Once fully staffed, they have got 
a lot of work to do. We need new rules 
to 
debottleneck 
our 
inter-regional 
transmission system to deliver clean, 
cheap, and reliable energy to all Amer-
icans—and thank you to my friend 
Senator HEINRICH, and fellow nerd engi-
neer, on that front—to ensure that 
market rules incentivize clean energy 
investments to decarbonize our system 
and lower the cost of energy, even as 
those investments lower the resulting 
cash flows; to ensure that the economic 
gains of zero-carbon energy are equi-
tably shared by investors, by con-
sumers, and by workers; to make sure 
that long-subsidized but inherently un-
economic fossil fuel plants can transi-
tion offline without unduly burdening 
consumers. 
That stuff is really complicated. But 
the simple and important truth is that 
we don’t have to keep paying too much 
for dirty energy. We don’t have to ac-
cept the fossil-fuel-funded false dichot-
omy between our morals and our wal-
lets. There is a better life, Madam 
Speaker, and you think about it, don’t 
you? 
FERC is the place where we can pre-
serve a livable planet for ourselves, for 
our kids, for our grandkids. We are all 
in the same boat; and with FERC’s 
help, the tide is going to come in and it 
is going to roll our way. 
So at the end of Hot FERC Summer, 
the day after the 21st night of Sep-
tember, thank you to Megan, Fergie, 
and Dolly for the inspiration, and for 
helping me ensure that my daughters, 
however embarrassed they may now be, 
can inherit a livable planet. Thanks to 
all who paid attention, helped me prove 
that FERC is indeed hot enough to 
warrant this level of attention, and 
moved us a little closer, a little 
quicker to a fully functioning Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission. And 
thanks to all the incredibly dedicated

REMEMBERING LINDA FISK 
MORRIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Linda 
Fisk Morris of Savannah, Georgia, who 
sadly passed recently at the age of 77. 
Linda spent her life serving her com-
munity by sharing her love for art and 
nature. 
After moving to Georgia’s First Con-
gressional District in 1997, Linda began 
supporting the Telfair Museums in Sa-
vannah, Georgia. 
During 
her 
career 
in 
Savannah, 
Linda served on the collections com-
mittee and helped direct the acquisi-
tion of rare works of art for the mu-
seum. 
Linda’s passion for her outdoor life 
and adventures led her to travel around 
the world. From the Grand Canyon to 
the Amazon, her passion for life was 
undeniable. 
Everyone who knew Linda recognized 
her giving heart and love for her com-
munity. 
I am thankful for the immense im-
pact Linda had on the Savannah com-
munity. I know her legacy will remain. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
her family, friends, and all who knew 
her during this most difficult time. 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIP WITH INDIA 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
important diplomatic partnership be-
tween the United States of America 
and the Republic of India. 
Visits of our nations’ leaders are crit-
ical aspects of our relationship, and the 
United States is honored to welcome 
Prime Minister Modi. 
The United States and India share 
deep historic ties that are rooted in de-
mocracy, freedom, and rule of law. 
Over the years, our two nations have 
increased 
our 
trade 
collaboration 
which is an important component of 
our partnership. In 2019 trade in goods 
and services reached $149 billion be-
tween our countries. Increasing trade 
between the United States and India 
will result in greater prosperity for our 
people. 
It is vital that the world’s largest de-
mocracy has a strong diplomatic part-
nership with this shining city upon a 
hill that we have been elected to rep-
resent. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Prime Min-
ister Modi for being a friend of the 
United States. 
HONORING JONATHAN HOLLAND, II 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Jonathan 
Holland, II of Brunswick, Georgia, who 
sadly passed away on August 6 at the 
age of 73. 
Jon had a long, distinguished career 
in the United States military and as a 
Federal and State law enforcement of-
ficial. 
After serving in the United States 
Air Force, Jon worked at the FBI be-
fore moving to the Virginia Alcohol 
Control Board, where he spent the next 
34 years. 
During this time, he was a first re-
sponder at the Pentagon attack on 
September 11. After assisting on site 
for 7 days, Jon received a declaration 
of valor from the Governor of Virginia. 
Jon retired in 2003 and began an 11- 
year career at the Federal Law En-
forcement Training Center in Bruns-
wick, Georgia. 
Jon’s service to his country and 
Georgia’s First Congressional District 
is extraordinary and will never be for-
gotten. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time. 
REMEMBERING JOHN ROBERT PADDISON 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor John 
Robert Paddison of Savannah, Georgia, 
who sadly passed away on August 1 at 
the age of 98. 
Bob dedicated his life to loving and 
serving both his country and commu-
nity. 
During World War II Bob enlisted in 
the United States Air Force and served 
as a pilot. He served in Germany for 18 
months, aiding in post-war recovery. 
Upon returning to Savannah, Bob 
worked at the Savannah Bank, where 
he would work for the next 30 years 
until retiring as bank vice president. 
Following his retirement, he then 
served his community as a volunteer

PRIORITIES OF THIS 
ADMINISTRATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the priorities of the 
Biden administration because they are 
not good for the American people. 
What are the administration’s prior-
ities as outlined by the infrastructure 
package? It is not roads, bridges, high-
ways, rail, and waterways. Instead, 
their infrastructure plan is a Trojan 
horse for a leftist wish list that will 
jam progressive policies like the Green 
New Deal through this Congress at the 
expense of actual infrastructure. De-
spite promises that this plan would be 
budget neutral, the CBO has estimated 
it will increase our national deficit by 
$256 billion. 
What are the administration’s prior-
ities as outlined in the reconciliation 
bill? It is not fairness, but partisan-
ship. Senator BERNIE
SANDERS
said 
that under this budget no middle-in-
come family would pay more in taxes. 
That is not true. The reconciliation 
bill includes damaging tax increases, 
falling largely on the shoulders of mid-
dle-income families, small businesses, 
and family farms. This bill would be 
the largest tax-and-spend measure in 
America’s history and would increase 
public debt by more than $4.16 trillion. 
It would also allow the Federal Govern-
ment to intervene even more in our 
daily lives and kill countless jobs. 
What are the administration’s poli-
cies regarding ag policy? It is not sup-
porting the people who feed, fuel, and 
clothe all of us, but eliminating their 
protections and taxing them out of 
their land. I proposed an amendment 
on this very issue at the House Agri-
culture Committee earlier this month 
that was not even considered by Demo-
crat leadership. I don’t want to see 
farmers and ranchers taxed on their 
generational property over and over 
again, which will destroy their liveli-
hoods. This administration demands 
more taxes, and their party does what 
it often does and hammers rural Amer-
ica’s middle class. Farmers in my dis-
trict understand perfectly well that the 
majority party doesn’t care about the 
issues they face while they work tire-
lessly to keep the breadbasket of our 
Nation full. 
Just yesterday, I spent 2 hours in the 
Ag Committee marking up a resolution 
to retroactively designate July 2021 as 
National Blueberry Month. Now, I like 
blueberries as much as the next guy, 
but I stand before you in disbelief that 
this committee would rather name a 
portion of the past after a berry than 
protect the future of farmers in this 
country. These are backward priorities 
on full display. 
ABORTION BILL IS HORRIBLE 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to voice my opposition for H.R. 
3755, which would federally legalize 
abortions on demand up until birth. 
This bill isn’t just morally reprehen-
sible. It also prohibits States from 
passing their own laws acknowledging 
the humanity of unborn children. It is 
a wicked path to accomplish a wicked 
end. This bill would override both Fed-
eral and State laws adopted before and 
even after its enactment. This year, 48 
States have introduced a combined 289 
pro-life bills, 89 of which have been 
signed into law. H.R. 3755 does not re-
flect the voice of the American people 
on the issue of abortion. It reflects the 
voice of the abortion lobby. 
This bill abolishes any law that regu-
lates abortion in any way, including 
laws that prevent sex-selection abor-
tion and abortions based on a Down 
syndrome diagnosis. By 12 weeks of 
age, babies have fully formed arms, 
hands, fingers, feet, and toes and a 
functional 
circulatory 
system 
and 
liver, and the capacity to experience

pain. All of this, astonishingly, at a 
weight of one ounce and a length of 4 
inches. I believe that life begins at con-
ception. I support adoptions, foster 
care, and crisis pregnancy centers. God 
knits every one of us together in our 
mother’s wombs. Life is a miracle, and 
I believe that the right to it extends to 
the unborn in this country. That is 
why I strongly oppose this horrible 
bill. 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to call attention once again to 
the disastrous situation that President 
Biden has created at our southern bor-
der. 
The first priority of any administra-
tion must be to protect the homeland 
and keep Americans safe. We have 
brave Border Patrol agents putting 
themselves in harm’s way every day 
doing just that; and, meanwhile, their 
calls for a complete southern border se-
curity system are falling on deaf ears 
in Washington. They know that it 
would make their jobs easier and our 
country safer, and the funds are al-
ready appropriated. Why, then, is the 
administration forcing these agents, 
who deserve our unwavering support, 
to do their jobs with anything less than 
the most comprehensive technology 
available? 
Across the globe from our southern 
border lies Afghanistan, where there 
exists yet another disastrous situation 
President Biden created. Make no mis-
take, the fall of Afghanistan to the 
Taliban is not an isolated problem in a 
land far, far away. The Taliban could 
redistribute their terrorists across the 
world in a matter of days, and our 
southern border is about as secure as a 
welcome mat, inviting terrorists who 
hate America to come and set up shop. 
President Biden didn’t just torpedo the 
stability of Afghanistan last month, he 
also put Americans in danger, which 
highlights yet another need to address 
the 
southern 
border 
crisis 
imme-
diately.

RECOGNIZING BRAIN ANEURYSM 
AWARENESS MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Brain Aneu-
rysm Awareness Month, the time when 
we spread awareness of the signs and 
symptoms and seek increased research 
into treatment and prevention. 
Northeast Florida is home to the 
headquarters 
of 
the 
Trinity 
Love 
Hoblit Foundation, which works to 
support and fund neurological research, 
training, and treatment for brain aneu-
rysms, strokes, and other cerebro-
vascular conditions. 
Its namesake is Trinity Love Hoblit, 
who was born with a rare form of pri-
mordial dwarfism and grew to only be 
29 inches tall. 
Throughout her life she battled brain 
aneurysms and underwent numerous 
surgeries to alleviate the symptoms. 
Sadly, Trinity passed away in 2015 
and was only 14 years old. 
So in honor of Trinity and Brain An-
eurysm Awareness Month, please listen 
carefully to the risk factors and signs 
and symptoms of brain aneurysm. 
The risk factors include smoking, 
high blood pressure, older age, alcohol, 
or drug abuse, and family history. The 
symptoms 
include 
headache, 
pain 
above or behind one eye, blurred or 
double vision, difficulty speaking or 
swallowing, numbness or weakness on 
one side of the body, and seizures. 
Folks, please do not ignore these 
symptoms and promptly seek medical 
care if you experience any of them, es-
pecially if you are having the worst 
headache of your life. 
When it comes to brain aneurysms, 
awareness is the beginning of preven-
tion and cure. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, I am proud 
to recognize Brain Aneurysm Aware-
ness Month, and I thank the Trinity 
Love Hoblit Foundation for the lives 
they are helping to save every day. 
IMPROVING BENEFITS FOR FIRST RESPONDERS 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
it has been 20 years since terrorists at-
tacked the United States on September 
11. 
We have now had a generation to ap-
preciate the courage and sacrifices so 
many of our first responders make to 
keep us safe. 
In my 40 years of law enforcement, 
including 12 as sheriff of Duval County, 
I know good officers who have made 
the ultimate sacrifice in service to 
their community. 
Twenty years after 9/11, many of our 
first responders who are critically in-
jured in the line of duty still have a 
hard time getting the benefits that 
they have earned and sacrificed. 
That is why I am proud to cosponsor 
H.R. 2936, the Protecting America’s 
First Responder Act. 
This bill would improve death and 
disability benefits for police, fire-
fighters, and other public safety offi-
cers. 
This is a commonsense solution to a 
major problem, and I urge the Judici-
ary Committee to immediately con-
sider this bill. 
f 
IRAN IS A THREAT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, yester-
day at the United Nations General As-
sembly meeting, President Biden once 
again declared that he wants to ensure 
that Iran will never get a nuclear 
weapon on his watch. But he reiterated 
that his administration intends to do 
everything it can to get back into the 
discredited nuclear deal with Iran. 
Now, Madam Speaker, this was his 
only reference directly about Iran in 
his remarks. 
Today, I rise to remind my col-
leagues about the risks of this ap-
proach. Iran is the number one state 
sponsor of terrorism and the greatest 
threat against our ally, Israel, and to 
stability in the Middle East. 
In July, I joined Chairman MEEKS 
and traveled to Israel in the first Con-
gressional codel since the new Israeli 
government has come into power. 
Despite the change in power and the 
coalition between the left and right, 
there is no space between the parties, 
and the number one national security 
concern in Israel continues to be Iran. 
And while Republicans and Demo-
crats agree in principle that Iran 
should never have a nuclear weapon, in 
action, the flawed nuclear deal of the 
Obama administration did not end 
Iran’s quest. It only delayed modestly 
the development of a nuclear weapon; 
development that continues, Madam 
Speaker. 
This deal kicked the can down the 
road in exchange for a windfall to the 
Iranian mullahs and sanctions relief 
and pallets of cash delivered on a 
tarmac. 
Further, President Trump’s max-
imum pressure campaign of economic 
sanctions was working, and he took de-
cisive action with his strike against 
former IRGC head, Solemani. 
So, my friends, I am afraid that we 
will return to the Obama-era policy of 
paying cash for promises from the Ira-
nian leadership that will never be kept. 
Iran has blood on their hands, prop-
ping up Assad in Syria, the death of 
American troops in Iraq, and recently 
even blatantly attempting kidnapping 
in New York City. 
As a result, I reintroduced my legis-
lation, the Holding Iranian Leaders Ac-
countable Act. 
This bipartisan bill with my friend 
Mr. LAWSON from Florida would make 
public the funds obtained in an illegal 
or corrupt manner by Iran’s authori-
tarian leaders. 
For more than four decades the peo-
ple of Iran have lived under the brutal 
dictatorship of the Ayatollahs. 
The government leadership and the 
heads of the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps have all profited, Madam 
Speaker, at the expense of the strug-
gling Iranian people. 
By combining publicly available in-
formation with U.S. intelligence that 
can be made public, this legislation 
will provide a valuable window into the 
wealth making of Iran’s corrupt offi-
cials and limit their financial holdings 
which are used to support and sponsor 
terrorism. 
However, since this administration is 
attempting to re-enter nuclear negotia-
tions, we throw away a lot of leverage. 
This bill gives the U.S. Government 
and Iranian people knowledge by know-
ing how corrupt their leadership is. 
COMMEMORATING ERMA HENDRIX 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate Little Rock 
City Director Erma Hendrix, who sadly

September 22, 2021 
Born and raised in Little Rock, Di-
rector Hendrix dedicated her life to 
public service. From serving as a nurse, 
to local government, to her philan-
thropic endeavors, she always put our 
community first. 
Erma 
spent 
over 
15 
years 
rep-
resenting her community as part of 
Little Rock City’s Board of Directors 
representing Ward 1. Known for her 
passion, she spent her career fighting 
for racial equality and greater rep-
resentation in city governance. 
I value having the opportunity to 
work alongside Director Hendrix. I am 
grateful to have known her for so long 
and so favorably, and I know that the 
city of Little Rock is better for the 
service and work of Director Erma 
Hendrix. God rest her soul. 
f 
HEARTBEATS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I stand 
before you today on behalf of our Na-
tion’s unborn children, children, let me 
remind you, with heartbeats at 6 
weeks, with fingers and toes at 10 
weeks, and with the ability to feel and 
react to pain as early as 12 weeks. For 
too long, our Nation’s leaders have tol-
erated the murder of millions of our 
precious children through cruel and 
painful abortions. Madam Speaker, this 
cruelty and insanity must stop. 
Many States have passed legislation 
to protect both these unborn babies 
and their mothers, but my Democratic 
colleagues are actively attempting to 
undermine and overturn these protec-
tions through H.R. 3755, the Abortion 
on Demand Until Birth Act. 
In addition, the bill disregards the 
conscience rights of millions of Ameri-
cans. An Associated Press poll released 
in June of this year shows that up to 66 
percent of adults believe abortions 
should be illegal in the second tri-
mester and up to 81 percent in the 
third trimester. Yet H.R. 3755 is set in 
direct contradiction to the beliefs of 
the people as it allows for full-term 
abortions for any reason under the 
bill’s all-inclusive health clause. 
The abortion on demand bill is mur-
der in the first degree. 
Madam Speaker, it is impossible to 
justify the murder of a precious child 
in the womb. We all know that it is 
wrong to take innocent life, and no 
amount of slick talk will make it 
right. 
The scientific community has made 
great advancements through modern 
medicine and patient care practices to 
extend longevity for those who could 
not otherwise survive on their own, 
both old and young. 
At the time of Roe v. Wade, the aver-
age life expectancy for a man was close 
to 68 years and for a woman 75 years. 
Today, the average life expectancy is 78 
years for men and nearly 83 for women. 
These are significant increases thanks 
to modern medicine. 
Such scientific and medical advance-
ments have also proven viability for 
many infants born as early as 21 weeks 
gestational age, a feat that was nearly 
impossible at the time of Roe v. Wade 
or Planned Parenthood v. Casey. We 
also now know that a heartbeat exists 
at 6 weeks. 
While science is ever improving, the 
moral and ethical considerations are 
crystal clear: To end an innocent 
human life is to end a heartbeat. That 
is murder. 
I firmly believe that life begins at 
conception, and speaking objectively, I 
ask you this: What better scientific 
metric to determine the existence of 
life than the presence of a heartbeat? 
You have a heartbeat, and I have a 
heartbeat. We both are alive. A heart-
beat means life. When a heartbeat 
ceases, then life ceases. So when a 
heartbeat is present, we know there is 
life. When two heartbeats are present, 
a mom and her child, we know there 
are two lives. 
Madam Speaker, a heartbeat is a de-
fining evidence of life. 
A small child and an aged adult alike 
can both wrap their minds around the 
fact that a heartbeat equals life, and 
that to end a heartbeat is to end life. 
This bill, H.R. 3755, ends heartbeats, 
so it ends life. The Declaration of Inde-
pendence says: ‘‘We hold these Truths 
to be self-evident, that all Men are cre-
ated equal, that they are endowed by 
their Creator with certain unalienable 
Rights, that among these are Life, Lib-
erty, and the pursuit of Happiness. 
That to secure these Rights, Govern-
ments are instituted among Men . . . ’’ 
Life is the first of the unalienable 
rights mentioned in the Declaration of 
Independence. And to secure these 
rights, government is instituted. To 
protect life is our first responsibility. 
We cannot ignore this. We must not ig-
nore this. 
Therefore, I encourage my colleagues 
to reject H.R. 3755 and join me in 
standing for the sanctity of life, for the 
preservation of the most innocent 
heartbeats in America. Soli Deo gloria. 
f 
STOP PRETENDING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today because our border is still in 
crisis. I rise today to bring attention to 
the dereliction of duty by this Presi-
dent occurring at our southern border. 
Most of all I rise to ask this: Can we all 
stop pretending? 
Can we stop pretending that this ad-
ministration deserves any benefit of 
the doubt, pretending it is a tough sit-
uation 
beyond 
their 
control, 
pre-
tending that this administration, and 
frankly, the entire Democratic Party 
have any intention of solving the bor-
der crisis. Stop pretending as if this 
isn’t purposeful, because it is. 
When every single policy measure 
that you partake in results in more il-
legal immigration, well, then it stands 
to reason using the powers of deduction 
that maybe you want more illegal im-
migration. So let’s stop pretending 
otherwise. 
And while we are at it, let’s also stop 
pretending that more than a tiny frac-
tion of those illegally crossing our bor-
der have any valid claims to asylum 
whatsoever. We all know it. We all 
know that they are coming because it 
is easy and because America is a pretty 
great place. We all know they were 
trained by their drug cartel handlers to 
repeat certain phrases that make them 
eligible for the asylum process so that 
they will be given a bus ticket and 
maybe a court date which they will 
never show up for. 
Let’s stop pretending that this isn’t 
just a giant scam, a giant abuse of our 
well-meaning and generous system. 
And also, let’s stop pretending mass 
migration is America’s fault. Let’s stop 
pretending to listen to outlandish 
claims of climate change causing mi-
gration or the tired old refrain of, well, 
it is American imperialistic foreign 
policy or whatever, and so let’s just let 
everybody in. 
And let’s stop pretending that this 
isn’t getting exceedingly dangerous for 
us. It is dangerous for our border 
agents. It is dangerous for our border 
communities. It is dangerous for the 
children being trafficked. It is dan-
gerous for everyday Americans. 
At our border communities, crime is 
rising. There is greater insecurity. 
There is a spike in COVID cases. And 
the migrants, who I thought my friends 
on the other side of the aisle claim to 
care about, well, they are paying thou-
sands of dollars to smugglers to take 
them on an exceedingly dangerous 
journey that often ends in children 
dead, stranded in the desert, or in the 
Rio Grande. 
b 1115 
The only people who benefit from all 
of this are the drug cartels. They make 
money off the human misery by using 
asylum-seeking migrants to tie down 
the border agents so they can move 
their drugs with little to no risk. These 
smugglers aren’t just bringing your ge-
neric pot. They are bringing fentanyl, 
bringing enough fentanyl to kill every 
single American. 
Finally, let’s stop pretending that 
the Democrats’ pro-open border posi-
tion has anything to do with compas-
sion or kindness. There is nothing com-
passionate about tent cities, nothing 
compassionate about children being 
trafficked. There is nothing compas-
sionate about firing American workers 
for not getting a COVID shot, putting 
them out on the street while illegal im-
migrants flood into our country with-
out even a COVID test and then get 
treated to a bus ride or a hotel at the 
expense of the American taxpayer. And 
then, they probably get hired. 
And guess what? There is nothing 
compassionate about allowing hun-
dreds of thousands of illegal immi-
grants to cut in front of millions of

CRADLE-TO-GRAVE SOCIALISM 
WILL BANKRUPT OUR COUNTRY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. MILLER) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, from the cradle to the grave, 
the mission of House Democrats is a 
socialist transformation of America, 
which will bankrupt our country and 
make the U.S. dollar worthless, dimin-
ishing the buying power, savings, and 
pensions of regular Americans. 
House Democrats want to fund their 
$3.5 trillion spending spree by raising 
our taxes and increasing the debt on 
our children and grandchildren. After 
opening our southern border to allow 
200,000 illegal immigrants to cross 
every month, they are now attempting 
to ram through amnesty so foreign na-
tionals can vote in our elections. 
The crisis in Del Rio, Texas, is the di-
rect result of failed open border poli-
cies of the Biden-Harris administra-
tion, which put human traffickers and 
cartels in control of our border. 
The Bernie Sanders spending plan 
was produced by socialist Democrats 
who have never run a business, signed a 
paycheck, or kept to a budget. 
Our Nation’s taxpayers deserve the 
utmost respect when it comes to our 
Federal budget. The Federal Govern-
ment has no money, except for what 
they extort from us and the future of 
our children and grandchildren. 
Fiscal responsibility is vital for a 
stable, strong, and long-lasting econ-
omy. Under the Biden administration, 
inflation continues to skyrocket and 
the price of everything from gas to gro-
ceries has gone up. 
Gas prices are at their highest since 
October 2014. Fertilizer prices are the 
highest since the financial crisis of 
2008. 
Crime, especially homicide, is on the 
rise in our cities, where these Demo-
crats have pushed to defund the police. 
The American people do not want 
failed politicians who have created cri-
ses upon crises, from our borders to ru-
inous cities, in charge of everything 
and every aspect of our life. We reject 
the House Democrats’ cradle-to-grave 
socialist takeover.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
You have called us, O God, and we 
have answered. From cities and towns 
across the country, with enthusiasm 
for a life of service and a commitment 
to faithful citizenship, all who labor in 
these hallowed halls have responded to 
Your summons to serve and preserve 
the noble ideals of this Nation. 
And so we offer to You everything we 
are, lay before You all we hope to ac-
complish, and pray for what we lack: 
The ability to represent the concerns 
of our compatriots in this challenging 
forum of debate and decision; the resil-
ience to maintain a grueling schedule 
while staying above water in the 
storms of frustration and animosity; 
the compassion for an issue or group of 
people, and the need to broaden that 
empathy to hear the voices of those 
with whom we do not agree; the wis-
dom to know when a cause is justified 
but the discernment to refrain if the 
timing isn’t right; and the discipline to 
rise above the fray of harsh discourse. 
O Lord, we pray Your guiding pres-
ence amidst the protectors and guard-
ians of the laws of this land, the de-
fenders of the marginalized, and the 
safe keepers of the virtues, freedoms, 
and opportunities on which this Nation 
was founded. May we prove worthy of 
Your trust in us. 
In the mercy of Your name, we pray. 
Amen.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF FRANK BURSTEIN 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, just 4 
months ago, I rose to remember a 
Montgomery County favorite, Denise 
Burstein, and today, with a heavy 
heart, I remember her husband, my 
friend and community leader, Frank 
Burstein. 
Frank passed away last Saturday. 
Montgomery County will not be the 
same without his enthusiasm, his serv-
ice, and his generosity. 
Frank embodied service. As a young 
man, he proudly served in the Army 
Medical Unit, and even in his career as 
an executive, he was a local political

Frank was known for his hospitality, 
a wonderful chef who regularly wel-
comed the community to his famous

CRISIS ON OUR SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, while the President was vacationing 
at his beach house, and the Border Czar 
Kamala 
Harris 
enjoyed 
a 
football 
game, our Border Patrol agents were 
working around the clock to address 
the over 12,000 migrants who illegally 
crossed 
the 
Del 
Rio 
International 
Bridge this week. 
This is on top of the more than 
200,000 apprehensions Border Patrol 
agents encountered in August, a 317 
percent increase from the same time 
last year. 
So what has changed? 
The Biden administration’s reckless 
repeal of President Trump’s successful 
border policy and the Biden open bor-
der 
agenda. 
Even 
the 
Democratic 
Mayor of Del Rio, Texas, admitted that 
‘‘this is beyond crisis. This is urgent. 
This is dire.’’ 
The President campaigned on open 
borders and free health care for illegal 
immigrants. Americans need to wake 
up to the socialist policies that are de-
stroying our Nation and undermining 
the rule of law. The Biden experiment 
has not worked and will not work and 
it is a total failure.

ONGOING CONFLICT IN THE 
TIGRAY REGION OF ETHIOPIA 
(Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
discuss the ongoing conflict taking 
place in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. 
For over 10 months, the Tigray Peo-
ple’s Liberation Front and the Ethio-
pian National Defense Force have 
clashed in and around Tigray. The 
TPLF and the Ethiopian government 
must come to a true ceasefire agree-
ment and move toward peace. 
The people of Ethiopia are suffering 
in the most horrific ways imaginable; 
starvation, murder, rape as a weapon of 
war, and other crimes against human-
ity. They are losing their lives, homes, 
and security. 
Now is not the time to bicker about 
where the fault lies, with both parties 
blaming each other for varied and hei-
nous acts. Innocent civilians are suf-
fering as a result of this brutal con-
flict. Both the TPLF and the Ethiopian 
government must put the good of the 
people first. 
It is time that we address the needs 
of the suffering Ethiopian people by 
prioritizing refugee visas, and aid that 
actually reaches displaced people. We 
must support peace in the region.

HONORING CAPTAIN BILL 
ROBINSON 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor my good friend, Captain Bill 
Robinson, as Tennessee’s Second Dis-
trict Veteran of the Month. 
Captain Robinson was born in Roa-
noke Rapids, North Carolina. In 1961 he 
enlisted in the United States Air 
Force. He was trained as a helicopter 
maintenance technician and worked at 
Air Force bases in the United States, 
South Korea, and Thailand during the 
Vietnam War. 
On September 20, 1965, Captain Rob-
inson’s helicopter was shot down over 
North Vietnam during a rescue mis-
sion. He was captured and taken as a 
prisoner of war. During his time in cap-
tivity, Captain Robinson endured inhu-
mane conditions at infamous camps 
like 
the 
Hanoi 
Hilton 
and 
the 
Briarpatch. By the time he was re-
leased on February 12, 1973, Captain 
Robinson had spent 2,703 days as a pris-
oner of war, making him the longest- 
held enlisted prisoner of war in Amer-
ican history. 
Captain Robinson credits four faiths 
for his survival during his 71⁄2 years in 
captivity: Faith in himself, faith in his 
fellow prisoners, faith in his country, 
and faith in the Lord, Mr. Speaker. 
After he returned home, he continued 
serving in the Air Force until his re-
tirement on December 1, 1984, to Mad-
isonville, Tennessee. 
Since his retirement, Captain Robin-
son has dedicated his life to helping his 
fellow veterans. He is heavily involved 
in Chapter 1078 of the Vietnam Vet-
erans of America, which made me an 
honorary member, which is now named 
after him. 
Thank you Captain Robinson for 
your service and your sacrifice. It is an 
honor to recognize you on the House 
floor and call you my friend.

FUNDING 
FOR 
THE 
NATIONAL 
MARITIME 
HERITAGE 
GRANTS 
PROGRAM 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
amendment to the National Defense 
Authorization Act authorizing funding 
for the National Maritime Heritage 
Grants Program. 
The competitive matching grant pro-
gram, 
intended 
to 
enhance 
public 
awareness, education, and appreciation 
for United States maritime history, 
has not issued grants for the last serve 
years due to lack of funding. 
The Buffalo and Erie County Naval 
and Military Park in my community is 
home to several decommissioned Naval 
vessels that serve as floating museums, 
allowing visitors to be immersed in the 
incredible stories of historic military 
battles and brave U.S. soldiers. 
Without resources, ships like these 
across the country are deteriorating 
and, in some cases, are literally sink-
ing. 
I ask my colleagues to support our 
amendment authorizing $10 million for 
the National Maritime Heritage Grants 
Program and join me in protecting ir-
replaceable 
maritime 
history 
from 
being lost forever.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF SAYED OBAIDULLAH AMIN 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Sayed Obaidullah 
Amin, who served heroically in Afghan-
istan and risked his life as a translator 
for U.S. forces in Sangan Valley. 
Sayed had a pending SIV, P1, and P2 
application to get to the United States. 
He had the help of marines who he 
served with, as well as the help of my 
office. Unfortunately, he and his wife 
were killed at Abbey Gate during the 
Kabul airport attack fighting to get to 
safety. Their two infant children sur-
vived, and they are P1, P2 applicants, 
and they need the help of our State De-
partment to get to safety. 
My heart continues to be with his 
children, the marines he served with, 
and all those who worked so hard to 
get him to safety. Our mission is not 
over. We have lives to save.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
CHARLES BOLDEN 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize a valued mem-
ber of my team, Charles Bolden, who 
recently departed my office for a new 
challenge. 
Charles began working in my office 
in 2016 and has proven himself time and 
again to be a vital and integral part of 
the team. He started out as a staff as-
sistant in the office enthusiastically 
greeting guests and savoring every con-
versation with constituents. His dedi-
cation to serving the people of Illinois’ 
Second Congressional District, which is 
also his home, stood out. 
Charles handled the gun violence 
portfolio for the office, which is per-
sonal to him as he personally lost close 
friends to gun violence. This is an issue 
that is so important to both Charles 
and me, and I am grateful for his many 
years of service working to save lives 
and bring gun violence prevention re-
sources to the people of Chicagoland. 
While I am so sad to see Charles 
Mackie Bolden, aka Charlie, to me, 
move on, I am very grateful for his 
years of service, and I wish him the 
best in his next endeavor.

INFLATION UNDERMINES 
AMERICAN FAMILIES 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, American neighborhoods are 
under terrorist threat due to the Biden 
catastrophic blunder of the Afghan sur-
render with on open southern border. 
This is not his only failure as inflation 
undermines American families. 
Under Biden, borrowing and spending 
has already caused inflation to surge to 
the fastest pace in 13 years, according 
to the Labor Department. Sadly, we 
have price increases: Gasoline, 42.7 per-
cent; bacon, 17 percent; chicken, 7.2 
percent; fish and seafood, 10.6 percent; 
eggs, 9.9 percent. 
Whatever the increase in wages, in-
flation has wiped out gains. Americans 
keep less under Biden. Now, Biden pro-
poses $3.5 trillion in more borrowing, 
taxing, and spending, which will de-
stroy private sector jobs, add to the 
debt of younger citizens, and weaken 
retirement accounts. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from abroad to our 
neighborhoods.

BUILD BACK BETTER 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to speak in favor of the Build Back 
Better agenda and the investments it 
makes in our Nation’s care economy. 
Specifically, I urge the House to invest 
$250 billion over 10 years in Medicaid 
Home and Community Based Services. 
This will give domestic workers a long 
overdue raise in wages and vastly ex-
pand covered services for aging fami-
lies. 
Expanding Medicaid will fail a tragic 
gap in our long-term care system that 
forces seniors and people with disabil-
ities out of their homes. 
Today, over 3.5 million older adults 
and people with disabilities receive 
Medicaid for home-based care, but be-
cause of caps on coverage, 820,000 
Americans remain on wait lists. Mean-
while, domestic workers earn poverty 
wages without access to a safety net. 
Let’s pass both the Build Back Better 
Act and the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill to right this wrong, invest in our 
care economy, and protect American 
working families.

OPPOSING $3.5 TRILLION 
SPENDING PACKAGE 
(Mr. PFLUGER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the Democrats’ $3.5 tril-
lion spending spree that favors green 
special interests over American wages 
and livelihoods. 
This legislative package is pushing 
amnesty, adds trillions to our already 
historic levels of debt, expands the wel-
fare state to disincentivize work, and 
enacts Green New Deal policies that 
will drive up utility bills for Americans 
across the Nation and destroy our 
American energy industry. 
Additionally, the crippling tax hikes 
could cost up to 4 million jobs nation-
wide, with the middle class and our 
Main 
Street 
businesses 
burdening 
much of the cost. 
One proposal pushed by Democrats, 
the elimination of the stepped-up- 
basis, effectively creates a new, second 
death tax that would eviscerate over 1 
million jobs and hurt farmers and 
ranchers across the country. 
While some of these proposals may 
not currently be in the House bill, we 
must remain vigilant until Senate 
Democrats 
and 
the 
administration 
take these harmful policies off the 
table entirely. 
Folks in my district, and I believe 
most Americans, do not want a top- 
down, 
one-size-fits-all, 
job-killing 
agenda that will completely reshape 
our society. 
Everyday working-class Americans 
are hurting, not the rich. I will oppose 
any measure that results in higher 
taxes, lower wages, higher prices, more 
government control, and less economic 
growth. 
f 
SUPPORTING HAITIAN REFUGEES 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of refugees who are at 
the border seeking refuge and asylum 
due to economic conditions and a cli-
mate crisis in Haiti, where they wit-
nessed a horrible earthquake and sev-
eral devastating storms. They seek 
shelter, food, and opportunities. 
In recent days, Haitians have shown 
up at our door. They are looking to get 
our help. America has a longstanding 
tradition to help refugees. It is simply 
inhumane to turn our backs on them. 
They have witnessed horrendous cli-
mate conditions, the assassination of a 
President, and instability in their Na-
tion for many decades. 
We must continue to hold the torch. 
We must continue to provide access to 
each and every one of those refugees 
who come to our door, and we will be 
able to determine which are allowed to 
be granted asylum. 
Let’s uphold our legacy of America, a 
nation of immigrants.

TRIBUTE TO NAVY CORPSMAN 
MAXTON WILLIAM ‘‘MAX’’ SOVIAK 
(Mr. JORDAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Hospital 
Corpsman 
Maxton 
William 
‘‘Max’’ 
Soviak of the United States Navy, who 
made the ultimate sacrifice while se-
curing safe passage for his fellow 
Americans in Afghanistan on August 
26. 
Max grew up in Berlin Heights, part 
of the Fourth District of Ohio. He at-
tended Edison High School, where he 
played for the football team and was a 
member of the State championship 
wrestling team. His proudest decision, 
according to his family, was to enlist 
as a Devil Doc in the Navy after high 
school. 
A Devil Doc’s mission is to perform 
lifesaving work even as unknown dan-
gers advance. Amid the deteriorating 
security conditions at Hamid Karzai 
Airport in Kabul, with the likelihood of 
an attack increasing, Max stood at the 
gates to help evacuate American citi-
zens and our Afghan allies. 
Throughout his career, and especially 
during his service in Afghanistan, Max 
embodied the words of the Corpsman’s 
Pledge: ‘‘I shall do all within my power 
to show in myself an example of all 
that is honorable and good.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, Maxton Soviak is an 
American hero who will never be for-
gotten. He served his Nation bravely 
and honorably. We will never be able to 
repay his sacrifice, but we must always 
remember it. 
SUPPORTING VOTER RIGHTS 
(Ms. BOURDEAUX asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. 
BOURDEAUX. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Georgia was one of the first States in 
the country to pass a voter suppression 
bill after the 2020 general election, but 
S.B. 202 is just our State’s latest at-
tempt to disenfranchise minority com-
munities. 
Georgia has a long history of under-
mining the right to vote, from the Jim 
Crow era to more recent voter roll 
purges and exact-match policies. This 
week, news from Georgia and Florida 
confirmed, yet again, that bills like 
S.B. 202 were adopted because Repub-
licans are afraid that they will lose 
elections if all eligible voters partici-
pate. 
It is time for Congress to fix what 
the Supreme Court broke in 2013 when 
they effectively gutted the Voting 
Rights Act. 
I proudly supported the For the Peo-
ple Act and the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights 
Advancement 
Act, 
both 
of 
which laid essential groundwork to-
ward protecting our democracy. I now 
look forward to supporting the Free-
dom to Vote Act in the coming weeks.

OPPOSING THE CONTINUING 
RESOLUTION 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to address H.R. 5305, the 
continuing resolution for short-term 
government funding that passed the 
House 
last 
night, 
which 
I 
voted 
against. 
Earlier this year, House Democrats 
passed their $3.5 trillion partisan budg-
et package, which significantly in-
creased funding for their own spending 
priorities. However, this bill did not in-
clude funding for our military, the De-
partment of Homeland Security, or 
grants for law enforcement. 
Now, House Democrats have intro-
duced their continuing resolution to 
fund the government and raise the debt 
ceiling through December 2022 to allow 
even more taxpayer dollars to go to-
ward their spending spree. 
Mr. Speaker, funding the government 
should be a bipartisan issue. Yet, rath-
er than working together, Democrats 
expect Republicans to give them a 
blank check for their unprecedented 
spending. Democrats are responsible 
for expenditures; they need to take re-
sponsibility for the borrowing, too.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4879 
September 22, 2021 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, Amer-
ica is a great Nation, but with all the 
challenges 
we 
face—protecting 
our 
homeland, repairing our broken infra-
structure, taking care of our seniors, 
creating an economy that works for 
working people—extremist politicians 
continue to find time for their war on 
women. 
When I was a police officer, I put 
away rapists, stalkers, and domestic 
abusers. Now, extremist politicians in 
Texas and my State of Florida are in-
stead trying to empower those same 
criminals to sue victims if they get an 
abortion. 
Let me be clear: No Florida woman 
needs to justify her healthcare deci-
sions to anyone. It is our freedom to 
decide versus your attempts to control. 
When I chose to start a family, I did 
not ask my Senator, my Congressman, 
nor my Governor for permission. Every 
woman has the right and the freedom 
to make her choice for herself and to 
do so based on her own personal, indi-
vidual circumstances. 
The Constitution is a stubborn thing. 
This week, we will preserve the con-
stitutional protections of the 1973 deci-
sion in Roe v. Wade. I ask my col-
leagues to support women by voting for 
the Women’s Health Protection Act.

HONORING THE OMAR FAMILY 
(Mr. TIFFANY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the Omar family. 
On Labor Day, Kelly and Jay Omar 
ran out to pick up dinner for their fam-
ily while their oldest child, Briar, 
looked after his four siblings. 
It wasn’t long after they left that the 
kids started smelling smoke. Briar and 
his sister Peyton began looking around 
and noticed that the playpen was on 
fire. 
The 13-year-old immediately sprang 
into action, getting his four sisters, the 
youngest of whom is just 6 months old, 
out of the house. 
After Briar got his sisters to safety, 
he went back into the house in hopes of 
putting out the flames with a nearby 
fire extinguisher, but the blaze had 
grown too large to contain. Smoke sur-
rounded him, making it nearly impos-
sible to breathe or see the way out. 
Luckily, their family dog, Mandy, 
nudged Briar before guiding him out of 
the house and back to safety. 
Kelly and Jay Omar returned to find 
their house engulfed in flames but felt 
a sigh of relief as they counted each of 
their children outside and out of 
harm’s way. 
Although they are devastated by 
what they lost, they remain fortunate 
for what they still have. 
Thank you for the heroic efforts of 
Briar to save his sisters. 
ALLOW MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE 
DRUG PRICES 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, for far too 
long, the pharmaceutical industry has 
dictated who in America has access to 
the medicines they need for their 
health and well-being and who doesn’t, 
leaving millions of Americans in dis-
tricts like mine to make impossible 
choices about their healthcare. 
Already this year, drug companies 
have hiked the prices of 1,100 prescrip-
tion drugs, more than 90 percent of 
which were above the rate of inflation. 
The largest single price hike for a pre-
scription drug this month was nearly 16 
percent, 
while 
inflation 
has 
risen 
slightly more than 2 percent. 
Big Pharma’s bottom line should 
never be more important than the 
health of my constituents in the Sev-
enth District of Pennsylvania or the 
American people at large. 
That is why I recently organized a 
letter signed by 14 of my colleagues, 
asking our leaders to allow Medicare to 
negotiate lower drug prices and include 
that language in the budget reconcili-
ation bill currently being negotiated. 
Here is the truth: Giving Medicare 
the power to negotiate would lower the 
cost of prescription drugs for hard-
working families so that everyone has 
access to the medicines they need. It 
would also result in nearly half a tril-
lion dollars in savings for taxpayers, 
money that we can invest in making 
healthcare more affordable for even 
more people.

WISHING BURDETT LOOMIS A 
SPEEDY RECOVERY 
(Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and

Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to ask that you all join me 
in wishing Burdett Loomis a speedy re-
covery. 
You may not know Bird, unless you 
took a political science class at the 
University of Kansas anytime in the 
last 40 years, in which case he was 
probably your favorite professor. Or 
maybe you would know him from his 
decades as the KU Washington Semes-
ter coordinator, helping students gain 
real-world experience at various orga-
nizations and congressional offices here 
in D.C. 
Regular followers of Kansas politics 
and government will, of course, know 
him for his insight, wit, and frequent 
interviews and columns in the local 
news. 
He is an irreplaceable member of our 
community whose contributions are 
too numerous for me to list in my 
short time here. He has been a trusted 
friend and adviser to many Kansas offi-
cials over the years, and I am person-
ally grateful for his guidance through-
out my time in Congress and his un-
conditional dedication to the State of 
Kansas and the well-being of its democ-
racy. 
Bird has a huge community wishing 
him well. From students to Senators 
and so many in between, we look for-
ward to seeing you soon and are keep-
ing you in our thoughts.

LIVES 
LOST 
IN 
BOULDER, 
COLORADO, 
MASS 
SHOOTING 
(Mr. NEGUSE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, 6 months 
ago today, we experienced a tragedy in 
my community of Boulder, Colorado. 
On a Monday afternoon in March, 10 
lives were lost at our local King 
Soopers as a gunman opened fire on 
customers and employees. 
Ten lives were taken far too soon— 
daughters, sons, neighbors, spouses, co-
workers, community members, each of 
whom left a profound impact on our 
community. 
While the national news may have 
moved on, for our community, for the 
families, friends, and neighbors, we are 
still grieving and still healing. 
May we continue to remember them. 
May we lift up their families and 
friends in our prayers and in our 
thoughts. 
In the words of Thomas Campbell: 
‘‘To live in hearts we leave behind is 
not to die.’’ 
Our community remains strong in 
the face of this senseless act of vio-
lence. In strength, in kindness, and in 
compassion, may we move forward.

HAITIAN REFUGEES HAVE RIGHT 
TO SEEK ASYLUM 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, for many of 
our residents, the images of the United 
States Customs and Border Patrol offi-
cers on horseback whipping Black Hai-
tian immigrants at the border were 
triggering. It was traumatic. It was a 
reminder of our country’s ugly history 
and its decades of mistreatment of 
Black folks. 
What we all witnessed in Del Rio, 
Texas, was disgusting, not just because 
of the rogue, out-of-control CBP but 
also because the actions were a blatant 
betrayal of our human rights values. 
Those brave Haitian refugees have a 
legal right to seek asylum in our coun-
try, like all who are fleeing violence 
and repression. 
America is supposed to be a safe 
haven. Instead, Black asylum seekers 
at the border are being met with vio-
lence and deportation back to a crisis- 
stricken country. 
All Black Haitians deserve to be 
treated with human dignity, and we 
must do better. Our failure to act

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4880 
September 22, 2021 
against Federal agencies, at least over-
sight of Black immigrants coming in, 
is going to enable these shameful acts 
to continue. We must act together to 
stop it.

GIVING BACK TO VETERANS 
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I come 
from a family of veterans. My father, 
my brother, and nephew all served, and 
I am honored to fight for our veterans 
and their families here in Washington. 
Our servicemen and -women have 
sacrificed so much for this country. 
And our community and our country 
are forever grateful to all who have 
served, and we must always give back 
to those who have given us so much. 
I am proud of the funding that we 
have helped procure for the Veteran 
Rapid Retraining Assistance Program. 
It gives veterans in my community and 
the country the opportunity to receive 
a year of job training, education, and 
housing costs. 
This pandemic has been extraor-
dinarily difficult for so many across 
our country, and this is an important 
step toward serving the thousands who 
have so bravely served our Nation. 
f 
THREATS TO ABORTION ACCESS 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, on September 1, the 
Supreme Court allowed Texas Senate 
Law 8 to go into effect, which bans 
nearly all abortions in Texas. 
Make no mistake, a 6-week ban is a 
ban on virtually all abortions. Most 
people don’t even know if they are 
pregnant at 6 weeks. This is the latest 
in a series of extremist attempts to re-
strict abortion access. 
This December the Supreme Court 
will consider a 15-week ban in Mis-
sissippi that directly threatens Roe v. 
Wade. With this recent action, the 
Court has shown that we cannot depend 
on it to protect our rights. 
This Thursday, I am holding an Over-
sight 
Committee 
hearing 
on 
the 
unending threat to abortion access, 
and on Friday the House must pass the 
Women’s Health Protection Act. 
Our abortion rights are under threat, 
and we must act now before it is too 
late. 
f 
CONTINUING 
RESOLUTION 
WILL 
AVERT A GOVERNMENT SHUT-
DOWN 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, this 
week the House is expected to pass a 
continuing resolution to fund the gov-
ernment through December and avoid a 
government shutdown, which would be 
catastrophic for families and the econ-
omy as we recover from the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
I am pleased that this bill includes a 
provision to cancel the outstanding 
balance of community disaster loans 
issued by FEMA to the Virgin Islands 
as well as disaster assistance through-
out this country. 
The CR also extends the current en-
hanced rate of Federal matching funds 
for Medicaid through December 3 of 
2021, averting a sharp decline in the 
rate of Federal Medicaid funding for es-
sential healthcare for the territories 
and Virgin Islanders living there. 
The suspension of the debt limit is 
also in the continuing resolution, to 
prevent a default that would trigger an 
economic catastrophe, not only here 
but around the world. This suspension 
is to help pay for President Trump’s 
2017 tax cut and the original COVID re-
lief bill signed into law by President 
Trump. 
We know from his past practices that 
President Trump has no trouble keep-
ing debt, declaring bankruptcy. Thank 
God Democrats will be the adults in 
the room and make responsible deci-
sions. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT). Pursuant to clause 1(c) of 
rule XIX, further consideration of the 
bill (H.R. 4350) to authorize appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2022 for military 
activities of the Department of Defense 
and for military construction, to pre-
scribe military personnel strengths for 
such fiscal year, and for other pur-
poses, will now resume. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-
ished business is the question on

House Report 117–125, on which further 
proceedings were postponed and on

Add at the end of subtitle C of title XIII of 
division A the following: 
SEC. 13ll. REPORT ON AZERBAIJAN. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AZERBAIJAN’S IL-
LEGAL DETENTION OF ARMENIAN PRISONERS OF 
WAR.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(A) On September 27, 2020, Azerbaijan, with 
support from Turkey and foreign militia 
groups, launched a military assault on 
Nagorno-Karabakh, also known as Artsakh, 
resulting in the deaths of thousands and dis-
placing tens of thousands of ethnic Arme-
nian residents. 
(B) On November 9, 2020, Azerbaijan, Arme-
nia, and Russia signed a tripartite statement 
to end the conflict. 
(C) In signing the November 9 statement, 
all parties agreed that the ‘‘exchange of pris-
oners of war, hostages and other detainees as 
well as the remains of the fatalities shall be 
carried out.’’. 
(D) The Third Geneva Convention, of which 
Azerbaijan is a signatory, and customary 
international law require the release of pris-
oners of war and captured civilians upon the 
cessation of hostilities and require that all 
detainees be treated humanely. 
(E) Despite Azerbaijan’s obligations under 
the Geneva Conventions and their commit-
ments in signing the November 9 statement, 
long after the end of the conflict, the Gov-
ernment of Azerbaijan continues to detain 
an estimated 200 Armenian prisoners of war, 
hostages, and detained persons, misrepre-
senting their status in an attempt to justify 
their continued captivity. 
(F) Human Rights Watch reported in De-
cember 2020, that Azerbaijani military forces 
had mistreated ethnic Armenian prisoners of 
war and subjected them to ‘‘physical abuse 
and humiliation’’. 
(G) Columbia University’s Institute for the 
Study of Human Rights issued a report on 
the 
conflict 
that 
‘‘document[s] 
crimes 
against humanity and other atrocities com-
mitted by Azerbaijani armed forces and 
Turkish-backed Islamist fighters against Ar-
menians’’, including beheadings, summary 
executions, and the desecration of human re-
mains. 
(H) There is limited reliable information 
about the condition or treatment of pris-
oners of war and captured civilians, and 
there is significant concern that female de-
tainees in particular could be subject to sex-
ual assaults and other mistreatment. 
(I) The continued detainment of prisoners 
of war and captured civilians by Azerbaijan 
calls into serious question their commit-
ment to human rights and negotiating an eq-
uitable, lasting peace settlement. 
(J) Armenia has fulfilled its obligations 
under the November 9 statement and inter-
national law by returning Azerbaijani pris-
oners of war. 
(K) The United States is a co-chair, along 
with France and Russia, of the Organization 
for Security and Co-operation in Europe 
Minsk Group, which was created to seek a 
durable 
and 
peaceful 
solution 
to 
the 
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(A) Azerbaijan must immediately and un-
conditionally return all Armenian prisoners 
of war and captured civilians; and 
(B) the Biden Administration should en-
gage at all levels with Azerbaijani authori-
ties, including through the Organization for 
Security and Co-operation in Europe Minsk 
Group process, to make clear the importance 
of adhering to their obligations, under the 
November 9 statement and international 
law, to immediately release all prisoners of 
war and captured civilians. 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of Defense, in consultation with 
the Secretary of State, shall submit to the 
relevant congressional committees a report 
on the following: 
(1) United States-origin parts and tech-
nology discovered in Turkish Bayraktar un-
manned aerial vehicles deployed by Azer-
baijan against Nagorno Karabakh between 
September 27, 2020 and November 9, 2020, in-
cluding an assessment of any potential viola-
tions of violations of the Arms Export Con-
trol Act or other applicable laws, sanctions 
policies, or other provisions of United States 
law related to the discovery of such parts 
and technology. 
(2) Azerbaijan’s use of white phosphorous, 
cluster bombs, and prohibited munitions de-
ployed by Azerbaijan against civilians and 
civilian infrastructure in Nagorno Karabakh 
between September 27, 2020, and November 9, 
2020, including an assessment of any poten-
tial violations of United States or inter-
national law related to the use of such muni-
tions. 
(3) Turkey’s and Azerbaijan’s recruitment 
of foreign terrorist fighters to participate in 
Azerbaijan’s offensive military operations 
against Nagorno Karabakh between Sep-
tember 27, 2020, and November 9, 2020, includ-
ing an assessment of any related potential 
violations of United States law, the Inter-
national Convention against the Recruit-
ment, Use, Financing and Training of Merce-
naries, or other international or multilateral 
treaties. 
(c) 
RELEVANT
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—In this section, the term ‘‘relevant 
congressional committees’’ means the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs and Committee on 
Armed Services of the House of Representa-
tives and the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions and Committee on Armed Services of 
the Senate. 
(1) Azerbaijan must immediately and un-
conditionally return all Armenian prisoners 
of war and captured civilians; and 
(2) the Biden Administration should engage 
at all levels with Azerbaijani authorities, in-
cluding through the Organization for Secu-
rity and Co-operation in Europe Minsk 
Group process, to make clear the importance 
of adhering to their obligations, under the 
November 9 statement and international 
law, to immediately release all prisoners of 
war and captured civilians.

the Eighteenth Air Force headquartered 
with the Air Mobility Command at Scott Air 
Force Base in Illinois. (4) 
(4) The ‘‘Eagle Wing’’ flies hundreds of mis-
sions throughout the world, provides a quar-
ter of the United States’ strategic airlift ca-
pability, and boasts a global reach to over 
100 countries around the world.

ible aircrews and aircraft utilized by the 
United States Air Force, including the C–5M 
Super Galaxy and C–17A Globemaster III air-

ment to the dedication and readiness of the

new section: 
SEC. 576. JUSTICE FOR WOMEN VETERANS. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) In June 1948, Congress enacted the 
Women’s Armed Services Integration Act of 
1948, which formally authorized the appoint-
ment and enlistment of women in the reg-
ular components of the Armed Forces. 
(2) With the expansion of the Armed Forces 
to include women, the possibility arose for 
the first time that members of the regular 
components of the Armed Forces could be-
come pregnant. 
(3) The response to such possibilities and 
actualities was Executive Order 10240, signed 
by President Harry S. Truman in 1951, which 
granted the Armed Forces the authority to 
involuntarily separate or discharge a woman 
if she became pregnant, gave birth to a child, 
or became a parent by adoption or a step-
parent. 
(4) The Armed Forces responded to the Ex-
ecutive order by systematically discharging 
any woman in the Armed Forces who became 
pregnant, regardless of whether the preg-
nancy was planned, unplanned, or the result 
of sexual abuse.

September 22, 2021 
(5) Although the Armed Forces were re-
quired to offer women who were involun-
tarily separated or discharged due to preg-
nancy the opportunity to request retention 
in the military, many such women were not 
offered such opportunity. 
(6) The Armed Forces did not provide re-
quired separation benefits, counseling, or as-
sistance to the members of the Armed Forces 
who were separated or discharged due to 
pregnancy. 
(7) Thousands of members of the Armed 
Forces were involuntarily separated or dis-
charged from the Armed Forces as a result of 
pregnancy. 
(8) There are reports that the practice of 
the Armed Forces to systematically separate 
or discharge pregnant members caused some 
such members to seek an unsafe or inacces-
sible abortion, which was not legal at the 
time, or to put their children up for adop-
tion, and that, in some cases, some women 
died by suicide following their involuntary 
separation or discharge from the Armed 
Forces. 
(9) Such involuntary separation or dis-
charge from the Armed Forces on the basis 
of pregnancy was challenged in Federal dis-
trict court by Stephanie Crawford in 1975, 
whose legal argument stated that this prac-
tice violated her constitutional right to due 
process of law. 
(10) The Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit ruled in Stephanie Crawford’s favor 
in 1976 and found that Executive Order 10240 
and any regulations relating to the Armed 
Forces that made separation or discharge 
mandatory due to pregnancy were unconsti-
tutional. 
(11) By 1976, all regulations that permitted 
involuntary separation or discharge of a 
member of the Armed Forces because of 
pregnancy or any form of parenthood were 
rescinded. 
(12) Today, women comprise 17 percent of 
the Armed Forces, and many are parents, in-
cluding 12 percent of whom are single par-
ents. 
(13) While military parents face many 
hardships, today’s Armed Forces provides 
various lengths of paid family leave for 
mothers and fathers. for both birth and adop-
tion of children. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.— 
(1) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that women who served in the 
Armed Forces before February 23, 1976 should 
not have been involuntarily separated or dis-
charged due to pregnancy or parenthood. 
(2) 
EXPRESSION
OF
REMORSE.—Congress 
hereby expresses deep remorse for the women 
who patriotically served in the Armed 
Forces, but were forced, by official United 
States policy, to endure unnecessary and dis-
criminatory actions, including the violation 
of their constitutional right to due process 
of law, simply because they became pregnant 
or became a parent while a member of the 
Armed Forces. 
(c) GAO STUDY OF WOMEN INVOLUNTARILY 
SEPARATED
OR DISCHARGED DUE
TO PREG-
NANCY OR PARENTHOOD.— 
(1) 
STUDY
REQUIRED.—The 
Comptroller 
General of the United States shall conduct a 
study regarding women involuntarily sepa-
rated or discharged from the Armed Forces 
due to pregnancy or parenthood during the 
period of 1951 through 1976. The study shall 
identify— 
(A) 
the 
number 
of 
such 
women, 
disaggregated by— 
(i) Armed Force; 
(ii) grade; 
(iii) race; and 
(iv) ethnicity; 
(B) the characters of such discharges or 
separations; 
(C) discrepancies in uniformity of such dis-
charges or separations; 
(D) how such discharges or separations af-
fected access of such women to health care 
and benefits through the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs; and 
(E) recommendations for improving access 
of such women to resources through the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs. 
(2) BRIEFING AND REPORT.— 
(A) BRIEFING.—Not later than 6 months 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Comptroller General shall brief the Commit-
tees on Armed Services and the Committees 
on Veterans’ Affairs of the Senate and the 
House of Representatives on the study. 
(B) REPORT.—Not later than 18 months

BILITERACY PROGRAMS. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The people of the United States cele-
brate cultural and linguistic diversity and 
seek to prepare students with skills to suc-
ceed in the 21st century. 
(2) It is fitting to commend the dedication 
of students who have achieved proficiency in 
multiple languages and to encourage their 
peers to follow in their footsteps. 
(3) The congressionally requested Commis-
sion on Language Learning, in its 2017 report 
‘‘America’s Languages: Investing in Lan-
guage Education for the 21st Century’’, notes 
the pressing national need for more people of 
the United States who are proficient in two 
or more languages for national security, eco-
nomic growth, and the fulfillment of the po-
tential of all people of the United States. 
(4) The Commission on Language Learning 
also notes the extensive cognitive, edu-
cational, and employment benefits deriving 
from biliteracy. 
(5) Biliteracy in general correlates with 
higher graduation rates, higher grade point 
averages, higher rates of matriculation into 
higher education, and higher earnings for all 
students, regardless of background. 
(6) The study of America’s languages in el-
ementary and secondary schools should be 
encouraged because it contributes to a stu-
dent’s cognitive development and to the na-
tional economy and security. 
(7) Recognition of student achievement in 
language proficiency will enable institutions 
of higher education and employers to readily 
recognize and acknowledge the valuable ex-
pertise of bilingual students in academia and 
the workplace. 
(8) States such as Utah, Arizona, Wash-
ington, and New Mexico have developed in-
novative testing methods for languages, in-
cluding Native American languages, where 
no formal proficiency test currently exists. 
(9) The use of proficiency in a government- 
recognized official Native American lan-
guage as the base language for a Seal of 
Biliteracy, with proficiency in any addi-
tional 
partner 
language 
demonstrated 
through tested proficiency, has been success-
fully demonstrated in Hawaii. 
(10) Students in every State and every 
school should be able to benefit from a Seal 
of Biliteracy program.

At the end of subtitle H of title XXVIII, 
add the following new section: 
SEC. 28ll. ANNUAL REPORT ON RENEWAL OF 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE EASE-
MENTS AND LEASES OF LAND IN 
HAWAI‘I. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Lands throughout the State of Hawai‘i, 
which are currently owned and leased by the 
Department of Defense or in which the De-
partment of Defense otherwise has a real 
property interest, are critical to maintaining 
the readiness of the Armed Forces now sta-
tioned or to be stationed in Hawai‘i and 
throughout the Indo-Pacific region and else-
where. 
(2) Securing long-term continued utiliza-
tion of those lands by the Armed Forces is 
thus critical to the national defense. 
(3) As a result of various factors, including 
complex land ownership and utilization 
issues and competing actual and potential 
uses, the interdependency of the various 
military components, and the necessity of 
maintaining public support for the presence 
and operations of the Armed Forces in Ha-
wai’i, the realization of the congressional 
and Department of Defense goals of ensuring 
the continuity of critical land and facilities 
infrastructure requires a sustained, dedi-
cated, funded, top-level effort to coordinate 
realization of these goals across the Armed 
Forces, between the Department of Defense 
and other agencies of the Federal Govern-
ment, and between the Department of De-
fense and the State of Hawai’i and its civil-
ian sector. 
(4) The end result of this effort must ac-
count for military and civilian concerns and 
for the changing missions and needs of all 
components of the Armed Forces stationed 
or otherwise operating out of the State of 
Hawai‘i as the Department of Defense ad-
justs to meet the objectives outlined in the 
National Defense Strategy. 
(b) ANNUAL REPORT.— 
(1) REPORT REQUIRED.—Not later than Feb-
ruary 1 of each year, the Secretary of De-
fense shall submit to the congressional de-
fense committee a report describing the 
progress being made by the Department of 
Defense to renew each Department of De-
fense land lease and easement in the State of 
Hawai‘i that— 
(A) encompasses one acre or more; and 
(B) will expire within 10 years after the 
date of the submission of the report. 
(2) REPORT ELEMENTS.— Each report sub-
mitted under paragraph (1) shall include the 
following: 
(A) The location, size, and expiration date 
of each lease and easement. 
(B) 
Major 
milestones 
and

timelines for maintaining access to the land 
covered by each lease and easement. 
(C) Actions completed over the preceding 
two years for each lease and easement. 
(D) Department-wide and service-specific 
authorities governing each lease and ease-
ment extension. 
(E) A summary of coordination efforts be-
tween the Secretary of Defense and the Sec-
retaries of the military departments. 
(F) The status of efforts to develop an in-
ventory of military land in Hawai‘i, includ-
ing current and possible future uses of the 
land, that would assist in land negotiations 
with the State of Hawai‘i. 
(G) The risks and potential solutions to en-
sure the renewability of required and critical 
leases and easements.

(2) The Red Hill Bulk Fuel Facility is con-
structed in basalt rock that overlays a key 
aquifer serving as one of the major ground 
water resources for the fresh water needs of 
the City of Honolulu, including key military 
installations and associated facilities. Past 
leaks from the tanks and other infrastruc-
ture of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facil-
ity, while not resulting in any appreciable 
effect to the aquifer, raise significant ques-
tions whether the facility is being operated 
and maintained to the highest standard pos-
sible and whether the facility presents a ma-
terial risk to the aquifer and to Honolulu 
water resources. 
(3) Safety inspections of the Red Hill Bulk 
Fuel Storage Facility at 10-year intervals, as 
required by the American Petroleum Insti-
tute 570 standards, set the upper boundaries

(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—In order to fully 
effectuate national security, assure the max-
imum safe utilization of the Red Hill Bulk 
Fuel Storage Facility, and fully address con-
cerns as to potential impacts of the facility 
on public health, it is the sense of Congress 
that the Secretary of the Navy and the De-
fense Logistics Agency should— 
(1) operate and maintain the Red Hill Bulk 
Fuel Storage Facility to the highest stand-
ard possible; and 
(2) require safety inspections to be con-
ducted more frequently based on the corro-
sion rate of the piping and overall condition 
of the pipeline system and support equip-
ment at the facility. 
(c) INSPECTION REQUIREMENT.— 
(1) INSPECTION REQUIRED.—The Secretary of 
the Navy shall direct the Naval Facilities 
Engineering Command to conduct an inspec-
tion of the pipeline system, supporting infra-
structure, 
and 
appurtenances, 
including 
valves and any other corrosion prone equip-
ment, at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Fa-
cility. 
(2) INSPECTION AGENT; STANDARDS.—The in-
spection required by this subsection shall be 
performed— 
(A) by an independent American Petroleum 
Institute certified inspector who will present 
findings of the inspection and options to the 
Secretary of the Navy for improving the in-
tegrity of the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage 
Facility and its appurtenances; and 
(B) in accordance with the Unified Facili-
ties Criteria (UFC-3-460-03) and American Pe-
troleum Institute 570 inspection standards. 
(3) EXCEPTION.—The inspection required by 
this subsection excludes the fuel tanks at 
the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. 
(d) 
LIFE-CYCLE
SUSTAINMENT
PLAN.—In 
conjunction with the inspection required by 
subsection (c), the Naval Facilities Engineer-
ing Command shall prepare a life-cycle

Storage Facility, which shall consider the 
current condition and service life of the 
tanks, pipeline system, and support equip-
ment.

later than one year after the date of the en-
actment of this Act, the Secretary of the 
Navy shall submit to the Committees on 
Armed Services of the Senate and the House 
of Representatives a report containing—

tity. 
‘‘(g) NONCOMPLIANCE WITH REQUIRED RE-
PORTING.— 
‘‘(1) PURPOSE.—In the event a covered enti-
ty experiences a cybersecurity incident but 
does not comply with the reporting require-
ments under this section, the Director may 
obtain information about such incident by 
engaging directly such covered entity in ac-
cordance with paragraph (2) to request infor-
mation about such incident, or, if the Direc-
tor is unable to obtain such information 
through such engagement, by issuing a sub-
poena to such covered entity, subject to 
paragraph (3), to gather information suffi-
cient to determine whether such incident is 
a covered cybersecurity incident, and if so, 
whether additional action is warranted pur-
suant to paragraph (4). 
‘‘(2) INITIAL REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the Director has rea-
son to believe, whether through public re-
porting, intelligence gathering, or other in-
formation in the Federal Government’s pos-
session, that a covered entity has experi-
enced a cybersecurity incident that may be a 
covered cybersecurity incident but did not 
submit pursuant to subsection (d) to the Of-
fice a covered cybersecurity incident report 
relating thereto, the Director may request 
information from such covered entity to con-
firm whether the cybersecurity incident at 
issue is a covered cybersecurity incident, and 
determine whether further examination into 
the details surrounding such incident are 
warranted pursuant to paragraph (4). 
‘‘(B) TREATMENT.—Information provided to 
the Office in response to a request under sub-

‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If, after the date that is 
seven days from the date on which the Direc-
tor made a request for information in para-
graph (2), the Director has received no re-
sponse from the entity from which such in-
formation was requested, or received an in-
adequate response, the Director may issue to 
such entity a subpoena to compel disclosure 
of information the Director considers nec-
essary to determine whether a covered cy-
bersecurity incident has occurred and assess 
potential impacts to national security, eco-
nomic security, or public health and safety, 
determine whether further examination into 
the details surrounding such incident are 
warranted pursuant to paragraph (4), and if 
so, compel disclosure of such information as 
is necessary to carry out activities described 
in subsection (c). 
‘‘(B) CIVIL ACTION.—If a covered entity does 
not comply with a subpoena, the Director 
may bring a civil action in a district court of 
the United States to enforce such subpoena. 
An action under this paragraph may be 
brought in the judicial district in which the 
entity against which the action is brought 
resides, is found, or does business. The court 
may punish a failure to obey an order of the 
court to comply with the subpoena as a con-
tempt of court. 
‘‘(C) NON-APPLICABILITY OF PROTECTIONS.— 
The protections described in subsection (f) 
do not apply to a covered entity that is the 
recipient of a subpoena under this paragraph 
(3). 
‘‘(4) ADDITIONAL ACTIONS.— 
‘‘(A) EXAMINATION.—If, based on the infor-
mation provided in response to a subpoena 
issued pursuant to paragraph (3), the Direc-
tor determines that the cybersecurity inci-
dent at issue is a significant cyber incident, 
or is part of a group of related cybersecurity 
incidents that together satisfy the definition 
of a significant cyber incident, and a more 
thorough examination of the details sur-
rounding such incident is warranted in order 
to carry out activities described in sub-
section (c), the Director may direct the Of-
fice to conduct an examination of such inci-
dent in order to enhance the Agency’s situa-
tional awareness of cybersecurity threats 
across critical infrastructure sectors, in a 
manner consistent with privacy and civil lib-
erties protections under applicable law. 
‘‘(B) PROVISION OF CERTAIN INFORMATION TO 
ATTORNEY
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding sub-
section (e)(4) and paragraph (2)(B), if the Di-
rector determines, based on the information 
provided in response to a subpoena issued 
pursuant to paragraph (3) or identified in the 
course of an examination under subpara-
graph (A), that the facts relating to the cy-
bersecurity incident at issue may constitute 
grounds for a regulatory enforcement action 
or criminal prosecution, the Director may 
provide such information to the Attorney 
General or the appropriate regulator, who 
may use such information for a regulatory 
enforcement action or criminal prosecution. 
‘‘(h) VOLUNTARY REPORTING OF CYBER INCI-
DENTS.—The Agency shall receive cybersecu-
rity incident reports submitted voluntarily 
by entities that are not covered entities, or

AMENDMENT NO. 110 OFFERED BY MR. COHEN OF 
TENNESSEE 
Add at the end of subtitle C of title XIII of 
division A the following: 
SEC. lll. TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION AC-
COUNTABILITY AND PREVENTION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The International Criminal Police Or-
ganization (INTERPOL) works to prevent 
and fight crime through enhanced coopera-
tion and innovation on police and security 
matters, including kleptocracy, counterter-
rorism, cybercrime, counternarcotics, and 
transnational organized crime. 
(2) United States membership and partici-
pation in INTERPOL advances the national 
security and law enforcement interests of 
the United States related to combating 
kleptocracy, 
terrorism, 
cybercrime, 
nar-
cotics, and transnational organized crime. 
(3) Article 2 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
states that the organization aims ‘‘øto¿ en-
sure and promote the widest possible mutual 
assistance between all criminal police au-
thorities . . . in the spirit of the ‘Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights’ ’’. 
(4) Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
states that ‘‘øi¿t is strictly forbidden for the 
Organization to undertake any intervention 
or activities of a political, military, reli-
gious or racial character’’. 
(5) These principles provide INTERPOL 
with a foundation based on respect for 
human rights and avoidance of politically 
motivated actions by the organization and 
its members. 
(6) According to the Justice Manual of the 
United States Department of Justice, ‘‘øi¿n 
the United States, national law prohibits the 
arrest of the subject of a Red Notice issued 
by another INTERPOL member country, 
based upon the notice alone’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that some INTERPOL member 
countries 
have 
repeatedly 
misused 
INTERPOL’s databases and processes, in-
cluding Notice and Diffusion mechanisms, 
for activities of an overtly political or other 
unlawful character and in violation of inter-
national human rights standards, including 
making requests to harass or persecute polit-
ical opponents, human rights defenders, or 
journalists. 
(c) SUPPORT
FOR INTERPOL INSTITUTIONAL 
REFORMS.—The Attorney General and the 
Secretary of State shall— 
(1) use the voice, vote, and influence of the 
United 
States, 
as 
appropriate, 
within 
INTERPOL’s General Assembly and Execu-
tive Committee to promote reforms aimed at 
improving the transparency of INTERPOL 
and ensuring its operation consistent with 
its Constitution, particularly articles 2 and 
3, and Rules on the Processing of Data, in-
cluding— 
(A) supporting INTERPOL’s reforms en-
hancing the screening process for Notices, 
Diffusions, and other INTERPOL commu-
nications 
to 
ensure 
they 
comply 
with 
INTERPOL’s Constitution and Rules on the 
Processing of Data (RPD); 
(B) 
supporting 
and 
strengthening 
INTERPOL’s coordination with the Commis-
sion for Control of INTERPOL’s Files (CCF) 
in cases in which INTERPOL or the CCF has 
determined that a member country issued a 
Notice, Diffusion, or other INTERPOL com-
munication against an individual in viola-
tion of articles 2 or 3 of the INTERPOL Con-
stitution, or the RPD, to prohibit such mem-
ber country from seeking the publication or 
issuance of any subsequent Notices, Diffu-
sions, or other INTERPOL communication 
against the same individual based on the 
same set of claims or facts; 
(C) increasing, to the extent practicable, 
dedicated funding to the CCF and the No-
tices and Diffusions Task Force in order to 
further expand operations related to the re-
view of requests for red notices and red diffu-
sions; 
(D) supporting candidates for positions 
within INTERPOL’s structures, including 
the Presidency, Executive Committee, Gen-
eral Secretariat, and CCF who have dem-
onstrated experience relating to and respect 
for the rule of law; 
(E) seeking to require INTERPOL in its an-
nual report to provide a detailed account, 
disaggregated by member country or entity 
of— 
(i) 
the 
number 
of 
Notice 
requests, 
disaggregated by color, that it received; 
(ii) 
the 
number 
of 
Notice 
requests, 
disaggregated by color, that it rejected; 
(iii) the category of violation identified in 
each instance of a rejected Notice; 
(iv) the number of Diffusions that it can-
celled without reference to decisions by the 
CCF; and 
(v) the sources of all INTERPOL income 
during the reporting period; and 
(F) supporting greater transparency by the 
CCF in its annual report by providing a de-
tailed account, disaggregated by country, 
of— 
(i) the number of admissible requests for 
correction or deletion of data received by the 
CCF regarding issued Notices, Diffusions, 
and other INTERPOL communications; and 
(ii) the category of violation alleged in 
each such complaint; 
(2) inform the INTERPOL General Secre-
tariat about incidents in which member 
countries abuse INTERPOL communications 
for politically motivated or other unlawful 
purposes so that, as appropriate, action can 
be taken by INTERPOL; and 
(3) request to censure member countries 
that 
repeatedly 
abuse 
and 
misuse 
INTERPOL’s red notice and red diffusion 
mechanisms, including restricting the access

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Washington. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Oregon 
(Mr. 
BLU-
MENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Let me express 
my deep appreciation to the committee 
and staff for helping us zero in on a 
couple of things that are longstanding 
interests of mine. 
One is an amendment requiring the 
Department of Defense to have a cost 
estimate and program evaluation for 
unexpected cost increases for the W80– 
40 nuclear warhead life extension pro-
gram. I appreciate this giving us a lit-
tle more information.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4932 
September 22, 2021 
But I would like to focus on one par-
ticular area that has been deeply trou-
bling me for years. I have, in the mid-
dle of the city of Portland, a Superfund 
site that people have been working on 
cleaning up the toxic residue of years. 
And one party has not been a part of 
this effort, the Department of Defense. 
The Department of Defense built and 
decommissioned battleships for World 
War I, World War II, and the Korean 
war in the heart of the city. We have 
been working on a hundreds-of-mil-
lions-of-dollars cleanup working with 
the private sector, working with indi-
viduals, with utilities, and local gov-
ernments. The Federal Government has 
been missing in action. 
We found this last summer as we 
were starting some of the remedial 
cleanup. Over 400 shells were dug up, 
and still, the Department of Defense is 
missing in action, not taking responsi-
bility for cleaning up the toxic legacy 
of military activities in my commu-
nity and around the country. 
I have worked on this for years. I 
have been extraordinarily frustrated 
that the Department of Defense pushes 
this responsibility off. It is time to 
change. I appreciate what the com-
mittee has done. I hope this is a new 
era. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this is an en bloc 
that was put together in close con-
sultation with the minority. I urge all 
Members to support it, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Chairman SMITH and Ranking Member 
ROGERS for their hard work on this bill. 
I have two amendments that have 
been added into this amendment. The 
first puts anticorruption at the core of 
U.S. 
foreign 
policy, 
reflecting 
the 
Biden 
administration’s 
declaration 
that corruption is a national security 
threat, and indeed it is. 
As the House chair of the bipartisan 
and bicameral Helsinki Commission, 
bipartisan foreign policy to promote 
human rights and counter corruption is 
deeply important to our group and to 
our Nation. Corruption is the fuel of 
human rights abuse, and dictatorship 
is the primary means by which dic-
tators and their cronies influence gov-
ernment and society. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
large group of bipartisan colleagues 
who supported this amendment, many 
of whom are members of the Counter- 
Kleptocracy Caucus. A special thank- 
you to Representatives MALINOWSKI 
and SALAZAR, whose Combating Global 
Corruption Act is also included in the 
amendment. 
The other amendment would require 
the Secretary of Defense to attempt to 
recover the Afghan aircraft that the 
U.S. provided to the Afghan Govern-
ment and were flown out of the coun-
try 
by 
Afghan 
pilots 
fleeing 
the 
Taliban. These aircraft were purchased 
with U.S. tax dollars and should be re-
turned to us. They are in Uzbekistan 
and other countries. I am sure the 
Taliban would like to get them back, 
but they should come back to the USA. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
first in support of my amendment, the 
Gray Zone Assessment Act. 
Whether we look at the annexation of 
Crimea, the militarization of the South 
China Sea, the economic coercion of 
Australia, or the cyberattacks that 
have stolen our data and crippled our 
industries, we see the same pattern. 
Our adversaries are using methods of 
coercion that lie somewhere in the so- 
called gray zone, between war and 
peace. 
To make matters worse, thus far, we 
seem incapable of effectively respond-
ing to this aggression. It is well past 
time that we have a viable response. 
Experts 
have 
identified 
several 
causes for our failure to deter these 
gray zone campaigns—in particular, 
our weakness at coordinating all of our 
tools of national power by requiring 
the GAO to take a hard look at these 
problems. My amendment aims to 
move forward a process of reform that 
will enable us to effectively counter 
the shadow war that China, Russia, and 
others are waging against us and 
against the free world. 
I would also like to voice my support 
for Mr. CONNOLLY’s amendment, No. 
114, the Global Health Security Act. 
After 18 months of lockdowns, masks, 
social distancing, school closures, and, 
worst of all, a mounting death toll, 
COVID–19 has taught us that a disease 
that starts at the other side of the 
world can pose a direct national secu-
rity threat right here in America. 
Back at the end of 2018, before 
COVID–19 even existed, Mr. CONNOLLY 
and I recognized this threat and be-
lieved that Congress needed to support, 
direct, and provide oversight for our 
global health security work abroad. 
We introduced the bipartisan Global 
Health Security Act to strengthen the 
U.S. and global capacity to better re-
spond to outbreaks like COVID–19. 
Passing this amendment will help us be 
prepared for the next virus so that it 
does not become a pandemic like this 
one did. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment, 
and I again thank the ranking member 
and the chair. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAL-
LONE). 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman SMITH and his team 
for including several important amend-
ments to this year’s National Defense 
Authorization Act, and that includes 
my amendment that requires a report 
from the Department of Defense ad-
dressing instances where U.S. security 
assistance is given to foreign military 
units known to have committed gross 
human rights violations. 
This amendment specifically focuses 
on the section 333 Building Partner Ca-
pacity Program, which has sent enor-
mous sums of American taxpayer dol-
lars 
to 
authoritarian 
and 
human 
rights-abusing regimes. 
A prime example of the program’s 
problematic nature is the $100 million 
given to Azerbaijani President Aliyev’s 
regime in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. As 
Azerbaijan was still receiving equip-
ment and training from the U.S. mili-
tary, they began a deadly attack 
against 
Nagorno-Karabakh, 
or 
Artsakh, on September 27, that led to 
the death of thousands and the dis-
placement of so many more. 
Passage of this amendment sends a 
clear signal that the United States 
takes seriously its democratic norms 
and commitment to peace by ensuring 
oversight of our security assistance. I 
hope it leads to future restraint from 
aiding and tolerating similar regimes 
in the future, especially when their ac-
tions are aimed at destabilizing a fel-
low democracy. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER), one 
of our outstanding freshmen. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the 2022 Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act, and I 
applaud the efforts of Chairman SMITH 
and Ranking Member ROGERS to bring 
this bipartisan bill to the floor. 
This bill boosts defense funding in 
line with the recommended 3 to 5 per-
cent real growth needed to maintain 
our competitive edge over China. The 
debacle in Afghanistan has weakened 
our position on the global stage and is 
a propaganda boon for our adversaries 
seeking to dismantle the democratic 
world order. There is no doubt that 
China and Russia are eyeing this op-
portunity to cast doubts on U.S. re-
solve and our commitments. It is im-
perative that we reassure our allies and 
partners of American strength at every 
turn. 
China is building its military and 
technological capabilities, and these 
investments will help achieve the next- 
generation joint fighting force, specifi-
cally of air and sea power. 
I am an F–22 pilot and have flown 
against some of the world’s most tech-
nologically advanced weapons systems. 
Now is the time that we need to take 
this seriously. Every threat around the 
world is looking at our vulnerabilities, 
and it is this body’s work that will help 
us maintain those competitive advan-
tages. 
To meet these challenges head-on, we 
must fully embrace the whole-of-gov-
ernment approach to counter any ma-
lign intentions. 
Congress is integral to this concept, 
and we must recognize these challenges 
and respond with strength at this time. 
We should not let perfect be the enemy

of good, and we cannot delay this legis-
lation at all. The strength of our mili-
tary is at stake. 
The readiness and lethality that the 
warfighters so desperately need, which 
this bill includes, is absolutely impera-
tive to making sure the United States 
can meet any challenges and defeat 
any enemy around the world. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
the underlying bill, and I look forward 
to ironing out our differences through 
the conference process. 
b 1515 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman SMITH for all his hard 
work on the NDAA. I fully support this 
measure. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of en bloc 1 which includes my two 
amendments, amendment No. 29 that 
creates 
an 
Afghan 
refugee 
special 
envoy position and amendment No. 117 
that requires the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs to ensure that all women 
veterans receive quality healthcare in 
a safe and dignified manner and on a 
timely basis. 
The Afghan refugee position assures 
that our allies who fought alongside 
American soldiers for 20 years receive 
the support that they need to resettle 
in the United States and are integrated 
into our great Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support amendments en bloc 
1 and to support my amendments, No. 
29 and No. 117. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I have some more speakers 
who aren’t ready to speak right now, so 
at this time I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS). 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for including my 
two amendments so that we may learn 
from the mistakes of the forever wars 
and ensure the Taliban cannot benefit 
from our financial system. 
I served in Afghanistan’s Helmand 
Province. I saw what began as a coun-
terterrorism 
mission 
mutate 
under 
President Bush into a $1 trillion boon-
doggle of a counterinsurgency. 
My first amendment ensures that 
Congress’ Afghanistan Commission can 
access the classified documents behind 
the forever war and hold to account 
those decision makers who let the fal-
lacy of sunk costs guide their con-
tinual investments of time, troops, and 
treasure into an unwinnable war. 
My second amendment directs the 
Treasury Department to closely mon-
itor illicit financing flowing to the 
Taliban. This safeguards our financial 
system and ensures the Taliban can’t 
use it to finance terrorist activities. At 
the close of this war, we must move 
forward with the assurance that we 
will learn from history. 
Madam Speaker, to increase trans-
parency and counter the Taliban, I 
urge adoption of this en bloc package. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my two amend-
ments to the NDAA to ensure the Pen-
tagon pays attention to the most vul-
nerable, both within the ranks and 
within the theaters of war, where they 
operate. 
My first amendment is a response to 
the ongoing but still poorly understood 
problem of hazing in the military. For 
years, unchecked hazing has been erod-
ing unit cohesion and troop morale. 
Too many, like my own nephew, Harry 
Lew, have died by suicide after having 
been mercilessly hazed by their fellow 
soldiers. 
Stopping this requires understanding 
the problem, which is why this amend-
ment extends regular reports through 
2027 on hazing and what the Pentagon 
is doing to address it. 
My second amendment is a response 
to the horrific August drone strike in 
Kabul that killed at least 10 civilians. 
This kind of mistake is inexcusable. 
These families can never get their 
loved ones back, but with just com-
pensation they can begin to rebuild 
their lives. Accepting our responsi-
bility is the bare minimum of what 
they deserve. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this en bloc package. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
CAMMACK), who is another outstanding 
freshman Member. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, Mr. ROGERS, for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, my amendment No. 
84 would require a report on the feasi-
bility of establishing a Customs and 
Border Protection preclearance facility 
in Taiwan. 
Last year, Taipei International Air-
port 
applied 
to 
offer 
customs 
preclearance with strong support and 
calls for approval of their application 
on both sides of the Pacific. 
Taiwan would be the first country in 
East Asia to offer preclearance, an ex-
cellent choice given our close economic 
ties with the island, our shared values, 
and our ever-more critical security 
partnership. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment to 
enhance travel between the United 
States and Taiwan. 
Secondarily, I rise in support of my 
amendment which would require the 
Secretary to conduct an anonymous 
survey to determine the effects of the 
COVID–19 vaccine mandate on both re-
enlistment and recruitment to the 
Armed Forces. 
I am not anti-vaccine, but I am 100 
percent 
anti-mandate. 
Individuals 
should be able to choose what is best 
for them and their families in consulta-
tion with their doctors. They should 
not be forced to take a vaccine by gov-
ernment at any level. 
I believe my colleagues who are pro- 
vaccine mandates should support this 
amendment to determine what effects 
the mandate at DOD will have on both 
reenlistment and recruitment. We need 
to know what, if any, effect this policy 
will have on our national security and 
our readiness. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close at this 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I urge support of the amend-
ments en bloc, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I too urge support of the 
amendments en bloc, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendments included in En 
Bloc No. 1. My first amendment, No. 100, 
would require DoD to develop more distributed 
military and Intelligence Community satellite 
architectures through a limitation of funds until 
Secretary of Defense certifies that the Sec-
retary of Air Force is carrying out the program 
and the appropriate report on implementation 
is provided. His amendment was part of a 
China Task Force recommendation from last 
year that was dropped from the FY21 NDAA, 
despite its inclusion in the report. Section 
1607 of the FY2020 NDAA mandated that the 
Secretary establish a program to prototype an 
M-code based, multi-global navigation satellite 
system receiver that is capable of receiving 
covered signals with the intent to increase the 
resilience and capability of military position 
and navigation equipment. This program 
would as a result deter the liklihood of attack 
on the worldwide Global Positioning System 
by reducing the benefits of such an attack. In 
last year’s annual report to congress, the ‘‘Mili-
tary and Security Developments involving the 
People’s Republic of China’’ highlighted PRC 
military strategists increasing development of 
capabilities that utilize space-based systems 
and to deny use of space-based systems to 
adversaries as central to modern warfare. The 
report further cites China’s strengthening of its 
military space capabilities despite its public 
stance against the militarization of space. This 
program is critical to countering the CCP’s in-
tent to reduce U.S. competitive technological 
advantage in space. Just this spring, the DNI’s 
annual Threat Assessment highlighted the 
PRC’s advancing interests in advancements in 
the space domain, detailing China’s intent to 
continue to develop craft to intercept, capture, 
or destroy US satellites. Additionally, this past 
summer Director of Intelligence for Indo-Pa-
cific Command, Rear Adm. Studeman re-
peated similar concerns: ‘‘From dazzling to 
jamming, to kinetic kill-from-the-ground, from 
space—all that, they’re on the march. They 
take a look at our space capability and want 
to equal and exceed those and be able to 
dominate to guarantee themselves the maneu-
vering they need to be able to secure their ob-
jectives if they’re in a fight.’’ It is critical that 
as we further develop space-capabilities we

do so by prioritizing resilience in these sys-
tems as our adversaries continue to develop 
technology to not just rival, but dominate our 
efforts in the space domain. 
My second amendment included in this En 
Bloc, No. 101, would prohibit the Secretary of 
the Interior from altering the designation of 
uranium as a critical mineral until a report as-
sessing the effects of the loss of domestic ura-
nium production. The Secretary of Defense, in 
coordination with the Secretaries of Energy 
and Commerce, are to conduct the assess-
ment of the national security impact of remov-
ing uranium from the list and submit a follow- 
up report. The U.S. Geological Survey, which 
updates the critical minerals list every three 
years, published its revised methodology pub-
lished in May noting that ‘‘Fuel minerals, in-
cluding uranium, were explicitly excluded from 
consideration in this analysis.’’ Removing ura-
nium from this list, as the Biden Administration 
is proposing, is another effort to cave to the 
whims of environmental groups. The impact of 
this is not exclusive to national security. Do-
mestic uranium production has almost com-
pletely idled and the source of uranium for our 
reactors has increasingly become foreign 
state-owned entities. Keeping it as a resource 
on the list will go a long way to restoring and 
securing American uranium production. 
Producing less energy at home means that 
we are forced to rely on our adversaries for 
these critical resources, emboldening them 
and weakening our global standing as they at-
tempt to undermine our interests. U.S.-origin 
uranium is critical to national defense for the 
purpose of nuclear weapons and the naval 
fleet, providing propulsion for 11 aircraft car-
riers and 70 submarines. Many international 
nuclear cooperation agreements to which the 
United States is a party, restrict the use of nu-
clear material imported under those agree-
ments to peaceful uses. The United States re-
quires U.S.-origin uranium and nuclear tech-
nologies for use in the production of uranium- 
based products for U.S. defense systems, with 
no foreign obligations that restrict the uses of 
such nuclear material. At this time, there is 
only one functional enrichment facility in the 
United States despite employing three major 
defense systems that require highly-enriched 
uranium. Removing uranium from the critical 
minerals list would be a dangerous and mis-
guided decision as it is a vital component to 
both our national security and energy security. 
We cannot continue to rely on unfriendly na-
tions that leverage energy dominance for geo-
political influence. These amendments are im-
portant additions to the National Defense Au-
thorization Act and highlight the diverse chal-
lenges to our national security. I am encour-
aged by their inclusion into En Bloc No. 1 and 
urge adoption into the final bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to Amendment No. 3, 
which directs the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) to reclassify public safety tele-
communications officers, also called 911 dis-
patchers, as a protective service occupation in 
the U.S. Government’s Standard Occupational 
Classification (SOC) system. This Amendment 
would have no direct effect on these workers’ 
wages, benefits, or other resources; pro-
ponents of this reclassification have stated 
that it ‘‘would provide validation.’’ 
The SOC classification system is a federal 
statistical standard used across agencies in 
data collection. According to OMB, ‘‘[t]he SOC 
is designed exclusively for statistical pur-
poses.’’ Changes to the codes affect multiple 
data sources frequently used by policymakers, 
researchers, and employers, including the 
American Community Survey, the nation’s 
largest household survey; the Current Popu-
lation Survey (CPS), the key source of our 
monthly employment numbers; and the Occu-
pational Employment Statistics (OES), the au-
thoritative source of employment and wage in-
formation by occupation. These changes 
would undermine the intent and legitimacy of 
the SOC by deviating from the long-estab-
lished process designed to ensure the objec-
tivity and integrity statistical data classifica-
tions more broadly. 
A standing committee at OMB, the SOC 
Policy Committee (SOCPC), is responsible 
maintaining the accuracy of these codes using 
well-defined principles. The SOCPC under-
takes a routine revision of the codes roughly 
once per decade; the process spans multiple 
years and ‘‘involves extensive background re-
search, periods of public comment, review of 
comments, and implementation of revisions.’’ 
During its latest revision, which began in early 
2012 and was finalized in 2018, OMB specifi-
cally rejected comments requesting it reclas-
sify 911 dispatchers as directed in Amend-
ment No. 3. In its response to public com-
ments presented in the May 2014 Federal 
Register, the Obama Administration’s OMB 
explained it ‘‘did not accept these rec-
ommendations based on Classification Prin-
ciple 2, which states that workers are coded 
according to the work performed. The work 
performed is that of a dispatcher, not a first re-
sponder.’’ In 2016, OMB declined a similar re-
quest for reclassification. Based on the prin-
ciples OMB’s policy committee applies to de-
termine SOC codes, 911 telephone dis-
patchers are already properly and accurately 
classified. This point was reiterated in commu-
nications with the Education and Labor Com-
mittee in 2021, explaining ‘‘After an extensive 
technical review of the requested reclassifica-
tion for 911 dispatchers, OMB, consistent with 
the recommendation of the Chief Statistician 
of the United States, decided not to make 
such an adjustment because it is inconsistent 
with the statistical purposes of the SOC.’’ 
Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS), in a written communication with the 
Education and Labor Committee on Sep-
tember 26, 2021, reported that the change 
made by H.R. 1175, a bill identical to Amend-
ment No. 3, would ‘‘will introduce costly, un-
necessary logistical and data interpretation 
delays and challenges affecting the quality of 
data.’’ Moreover, changes outside of the rou-
tine revision process would undermine the 
goal of data continuity, limiting data sources’ 
usefulness for their key purpose of statistical 
analysis; create precedent for disrupting the 
standard SOC revision process; and under-
mine the SOCPC’s authority as experts to 
apply the classification principles to determine 
what accuracy requires. 
Public safety telecommunications officers 
perform critical, challenging work. They de-
serve our honor and gratitude for their efforts. 
However, considering the many alternative 
ways policymakers could confer ‘‘validation,’’ 
as the proponents are seeking, there is little 
policy justification for this Amendment’s ap-
proach to achieving that goal. The SOC is not 
intended to rank or group occupations by edu-
cation, credentials, earnings, benefits or any 
other user-defined indicator of status. 
In conclusion, mandating a change to a sta-
tistical code would not affect these workers’ 
wages, benefits, or other resources—but it 
would disrupt data series continuity; require 
significant additional work for government 
agencies, researchers, employers, and others; 
and intervene in an official, routine govern-
ment data-collection and statistical process. 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act (NDDA) and my bipartisan amend-
ment which authorizes an increase of five mil-
lion dollars for a pancreatic cancer early de-
tection initiative (EDI) at the Department of 
Defense (DoD). I thank my colleagues, Rep. 
ESHOO and Rep. MCKINLEY, for their support 
and leadership on this issue. Pancreatic can-
cer has the lowest survival rate of all major 
cancers—in large part due to lack of research 
in early detection. I believe we all agree that 
the patients, families, friends and loved ones 
suffering from this disease deserve greater 
support. 
My amendment will provide critical funding 
needed for more research and an early detec-
tion initiative (EDI) under the Congressionally 
Directed 
Medical 
Research 
Programs 
(CDMRP) at DoD. I am pleased that the Ap-
propriations Defense Subcommittee has al-
ready appropriated fifteen million dollars for 
general pancreatic cancer research funding in 
this year’s funding legislation. While encour-
aging, we need to continue doing more. 
This issue has hit painfully close to home 
recently, as America lost giants to pancreatic 
cancer. Rep. John Lewis, our civil rights hero, 
passed away from pancreatic cancer only 
seven months after receiving his diagnosis. 
My good friend and colleague, Rep. Alcee 
Hastings, also passed from pancreatic cancer 
earlier this year. And, Americans lost a fighter 
for voting rights and women’s protection, Jus-
tice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to this deadly dis-
ease. We have lost too many loved ones and 
must do everything we can to save lives. It is 
unacceptable that, despite being the third 
leading cause of cancer-related death in our 
country, pancreatic cancer still does not have 
a dedicated early detection initiative. In fact, 
the lack of research in ways to detect pan-
creatic cancer early has led to devastating 
consequences: sixty-six percent of patients 
live less than one year following their diag-
nosis. 
If diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate 
for pancreatic cancer patients is above eighty 
percent. However, if pancreatic cancer is de-
tected late, the five-year survival rate drops to 
less than five percent. By failing to support our 
nation’s researchers with the means to find 
new ways to detect pancreatic cancer early, 
we are leaving America’s pancreatic cancer 
patients with few ways to detect this disease 
in time to extend the quality and duration of 
their lives. 
It’s important to note that persistent health 
care inequities and disparities for communities 
of color compound the devastation of pan-
creatic cancer and the effects of lack of early 
detection research. Unfortunately, Black peo-
ple are more likely than their fellow Americans 
to get pancreatic cancer. In fact, the incidence 
rate for pancreatic cancer among Black Ameri-
cans is twenty percent higher than any other 
racial demographic. This disease is more 
deadly for us: the pancreatic cancer death rate 
is seventeen percent higher for Black men 
than white men. Significant evidence dem-
onstrates that these disproportionate levels of

pancreatic cancer are in large part rooted in 
disparities in health care and access to tests 
and diagnostics. As a result, the lack of pan-
creatic cancer early detection research accel-
erates the racial unfairness in our health care 
system, with devastating consequences for mi-
norities. 
At a time when our country is having a na-
tional conversation about the deep disparities 
in access to health care for Black and Brown 
people during a global pandemic, Congress 
must do everything within our power to im-
prove health outcomes through research and 
treatment. Providing dedicated funding for 
early detection research at DoD will help fill a 
critical gap in our pancreatic cancer research 
and will help address the pancreatic cancer 
disparities for communities of color. 
I urge the House to support this amend-
ment. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of my amendment reaffirming the im-
portance of the U.S. Israel alliance. At a time 
when the Middle East is in constant turmoil, 
the United States needs strong allies like 
Israel. Allies who are stable, dependent, and a 
force for good in the region. Effective foreign 
policy in the Middle East begins with an ac-
knowledgment of Israel as one of our Nation’s 
strongest allies. As Israel continues to confront 
security challenges, particularly with Iran, it is 
in America’s national strategic interest to con-
tinue to offer security assistance to Israel. For 
nearly 75 years, Israel has been a constant 
and stable ally in a region devoid of stability. 
With the rise of Iran, the Taliban, and China’s 
growing influence in the region, the United 
States and Israel must continue to stand to-
gether against these monstrous regimes. 
Since its creation in 1948, Israel and the 
United States have been bonded together 
through our common values of freedom, pros-
perity, and constitutional norms. At a time 
when Israel is facing assaults and threats from 
tyrannical regimes, the United States Con-
gress must send a strong, unflinching mes-
sage that we remain united with our friends 
and allies just as we have for nearly 75 years. 
My amendment provides a full endorsement 
from the U.S. Congress on the importance of 
the United States-Israel relationship. We un-
equivocally stand with Israel. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, in Feb-
ruary of this year, more than two years after 
the cold-blooded murder of Washington Post 
journalist, 
and 
my 
constituent, 
Jamal 
Khashoggi, the Director of National Intel-
ligence released a previously classified U.S. 
intelligence report. 
The report clearly stated: ‘‘We assess that 
Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Muhammad bin 
Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, 
Turkey to capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi.’’ 
It concluded that ‘‘since 2017, the Crown 
Prince has had absolute control of the King-
dom’s security and intelligence organizations, 
making it highly unlikely that Saudi officials 
would have carried out an operation of this na-
ture without the Crown Prince’s authorization.’’ 
We’ve always known, beyond a shadow of 
a doubt, that Crown Prince Muhammad bin 
Salman directed the assassination of Jamal 
Khashoggi. 
We also know that this operation is part of 
a broad and ongoing effort to use violence to 
intimidate and silence dissidents abroad. 
Furthermore, we know that some of the kill-
ers of Jamal Khashoggi were trained in the 
United States, demonstrating an overwhelming 
need for reforms to our current arms sales 
processes and increased accountability. 
And yet, despite all this, Crown Prince MBS 
and Saudi Arabia have generally been shield-
ed from accountability, especially by the pre-
vious administration, signaling this kind of ab-
horrent behavior was somehow ok, inviting fur-
ther atrocities. 
That impunity ends with my amendment, 
based on the text of my bill, H.R. 1392, the 
Protection of Saudi Dissidents Act of 2021, 
which passed the House with overwhelming 
bipartisan support earlier this year. 
This legislation is targeted and does four 
things, specifically: 
It limits arms exports to Saudi intelligence, 
internal security, or law enforcement entities if 
the President finds that Saudi Arabia has en-
gaged in the following activities: 
Forced repatriation, intimidation, or killing of 
dissidents in other countries; 
The unjust imprisonment in Saudi Arabia of 
United States citizens or residents or the plac-
ing of travel restrictions on them or their family 
members; 
And the torture of detainees in the custody 
of the Government of Saudi Arabia. 
It requires the closure of one or more Saudi 
diplomatic facilities if the President finds that 
Saudi Arabia is using diplomatic or consular 
personnel to harass or harm Saudi nationals 
in the United States. 
It requires a report on whether Saudi Arabia 
has been engaged in a consistent pattern of 
acts of intimidation or harassment directed 
against individuals in the United States. 
And finally, it requires a report on whether 
the U.S. intelligence community fulfilled its 
duty to warn Jamal Khashoggi of threats to his 
life. 
In the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I 
worked closely with the Chairman and Rank-
ing Member to improve this legislation as in-
troduced, ensuring that this effort is bipartisan. 
This legislation has the support of dozens of 
human rights organizations, including the 
Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters 
Without Borders, PEN America, Human Rights 
First, Human Rights Watch, Freedom Now, 
and many others. 
When we turn a blind eye to human rights 
abuses, we embolden friend and foe alike to 
continue to engage in these horrific violations. 
We must end this ‘‘two-year pageant of im-
punity’’ and finally hold Saudi Arabia account-
able for their treatment of dissidents and those 
who stand up for human rights and against 
autocratic repression. 
Jamal Khashoggi was not the only one to 
face the brutality of the Saudi regime and is 
not the only one who would benefit from this 
legislation. 
I thank Chairman MEEKS for his support on 
this amendment, and I ask my colleagues to 
join me in sending a message to human rights 
defenders, dissidents, and journalists world-
wide and reaffirm the unshakeable American 
commitment to basic rights and freedoms. 
I ask you to join me in supporting adoption 
of this amendment. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, more 
than 4.7 million people around the globe have 
died because of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
In fact, more people in the United States 
have died from COVID–19 than they did from 
the 1918 flu pandemic—the previous worst 
pandemic to date. 
For a year and a half, our lives, and the 
lives of people around the world, were com-
pletely upended, supply chains disrupted, gov-
ernments thrown into disarray. This emer-
gency impacted every part of our lives and we 
were caught completely unprepared. 
We can’t afford to let that happen again. 
Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, there was 
a dearth of leadership and strategy around 
U.S. planning for a global health security 
emergency. 
As we continue to try to emerge from the 
worst of COVID–19, we now understand just 
how important planning like this truly is. 
COVID–19 has underscored not only the 
need for a robust federal response to such a 
crisis, but also the importance of investing in 
global health security and pandemic prepared-
ness around the world. 
Given the disruption this pandemic has 
caused, it’s clear that we need to consider 
global health security when we consider our 
national defense and security. 
This amendment will: 
Establish a Global Health Security Agenda 
Interagency Review Council overseen by the 
National Security Advisor and whose member-
ship includes the heads of agencies relevant 
to carrying out the Global Health Security 
Agenda; 
Establish a United States Coordinator for 
Global Health Security responsible for coordi-
nating the interagency response to a global 
health security emergency; 
Require the President to develop a global 
health security strategy with specific and 
measurable goals, benchmarks, and perform-
ance metrics that will improve U.S. leadership 
on global pandemic preparedness; 
And establish an international Fund for 
Global Health Security and Pandemic Pre-
paredness. 
The text of this amendment is based on my 
bill H.R. 391, the Global Health Security Act, 
which passed the House earlier this year with 
broad bipartisan support—the fifth time that it 
has passed the House of Representatives. 
The original legislation was improved with 
amendments during committee markup. They: 
Updated the findings sections to reflect ac-
tions taken by the Biden Administration on 
global health security; 
Tasks the National Security Advisor with 
overseeing interagency review council estab-
lished in the bill; 
Added the Department of the Treasury and 
ODNI to the council membership; 
And elevated participation on the council to 
heads of agencies. 
These edits were helpful suggestions from 
the Ranking Member and we were glad to in-
corporate them. 
We wrote this legislation long before the 
current pandemic and have adapted the text 
to incorporate lessons learned. 
I thank Representatives CHABOT, BERA, 
FITZPATRICK, and LARSEN for leading on the 
original bill with me, and for their support on 
this amendment. 
The Biden Administration has already com-
mitted to funding the Fund for Global Health 
Security and Pandemic Preparedness, and in-
cluded it in their FY22 Presidential Budget Re-
quest. 
There is a similar, bipartisan effort in the 
Senate led by Senators MENENDEZ and RISCH, 
demonstrating the widespread support for bol-
stering global health security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4936 
September 22, 2021 
This is not a red or blue issue—this is an 
issue that impacts every single person on the 
planet. 
This legislation is endorsed by Modernizing 
Foreign Assistance Network (MFAN), the ONE 
Campaign, Pandemic Action Network, RE-
SULTS VA, Right to Health Action and others. 
It is also supported by Centers for Disease 
Control and USAID. 
Global health crises are ongoing and in-
creasing—it’s only a matter of time before the 
next one hits. 
Saving lives from the next global pandemic 
starts with investing in preparedness before it 
strikes. 
Diseases do not respect borders, and global 
health crises have immense security, eco-
nomic, and humanitarian consequences. 
With this legislation, the United States can 
be a leader on preventing and responding to 
the next pandemic. 
It is past time this legislation become law. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, this 
amendment would provide welcome account-
ability and transparency for our security co-
operation training programs. 
It would require the Department of Defense 
and Department of State to review the partici-
pants in security cooperation training pro-
grams from the last ten years to determine if 
any of the participants were later designated 
by the United States Government as human 
rights abusers, terrorists, or military coup par-
ticipants. 
The amendment would require such report-
ing be updated on an annual basis. 
And, finally, it would create a reporting re-
quirement to Congress for any names sub-
mitted to the Departments by the Chair and 
Ranking Member of the armed services and 
foreign affairs committees. 
Earlier this year, it was reported that some 
of the members of the kill squad that mur-
dered and dismembered Jamal Khashoggi 
were trained right here in the United States. 
This is not something we found out through 
congressional reporting requirements from the 
Department of Defense, Department of State 
or public admissions from private sector con-
tractors. 
We found out because of reporting based 
on leaked documents. 
It has also been reported that at least seven 
of the individuals who helped assassinate the 
President of Haiti, Jovenel Moı¨se, were trained 
by the United States military. 
The review and ongoing transparency re-
quired by this amendment would provide wel-
come oversight of U.S. security cooperation 
programs and ensure that our capacity build-
ing efforts are not working against American 
interests or values. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer an amendment to the FY2022 
National Defense Authorization Act which 
would provide a statutory framework for the 
Federal Risk and Authorization Management 
Program, or FedRAMP, which was established 
administratively in 2011. 
FedRAMP is a standardized approach to 
certifying and assessing in an ongoing manner 
the security of cloud computing technologies 
used across the federal government. 
FedRAMP 
seeks 
to 
reduce 
the 
redundancies of federal cloud migration by 
creating a ‘‘certify once, reuse many times’’ 
model for cloud products and services that 
provide a cost-effective, risk-based approach 
to cloud adoption. 
This 
amendment 
would 
codify 
the 
FedRAMP program and address many of the 
concerns raised by government and industry 
stakeholders. 
For more than four years, I have worked 
with administrations under both Democratic 
and Republican leadership, industry stake-
holders, and my friends on the other side of 
the aisle to ensure that the legislative text be-
hind this amendment makes needed improve-
ments to the FedRAMP program, but also 
gives the program flexibility to grow and adopt 
to myriad future changes in cloud tech-
nologies. 
This amendment supports a critical need to 
keep our nation’s information secure in cloud 
environments. It is an improvement for agen-
cies, for our private sector partners, and for 
taxpayers. 
Enabling the efficient and secure procure-
ment of cloud computing technology is an im-
portant part of federal IT modernization efforts 
and essential to the federal government’s tran-
sition to a more virtual, but secure posture. 
The text behind this amendment has passed 
the House with bipartisan support three times 
in the span of a year. Once under suspension 
by voice vote in the 116th Congress, again as 
an amendment to the House National Defense 
Authorization Act for FY2021, and again as a 
standalone at the very beginning of the 117th 
Congress. 
I want to thank the Ranking Member of the 
Oversight Committee, Mr. COMER, for co-spon-
soring this amendment with me. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman 
from 
Washington 
(Mr.

AMENDMENT NO. 25 OFFERED BY MR. BOWMAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 25 
printed in part C of House Report 117– 
125. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of subtitle C of title XII, add 
the following: 
SEC. 1229. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO 
MAINTAIN A UNITED STATES MILI-
TARY PRESENCE IN SYRIA. 
None of the funds authorized to be appro-
priated or otherwise made available to carry 
out this Act may be used to maintain a 
United States military presence in Syria be-
ginning on the date that is 1 year after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, except 
pursuant to a specific statutory authoriza-
tion enacted into law in accordance with the 
War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et 
seq.). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. BOWMAN) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge 
support for my amendment that will 
take an important step towards restor-
ing congressional war powers. This 
amendment will bring our unauthor-
ized military presence in Syria to a 
long overdue debate in Congress so we 
can ultimately vote to authorize or re-
ject military action. 
Members on both sides of the aisle 
have long recognized the Constitution 
and the War Powers Act of 1973 grant 
Congress the exclusive power to send 
our servicemen and -women into war. 
I represent parts of the Bronx and 
Westchester County, New York, and in 
my district I am humbled to represent 
so many veterans who have sacrificed 
so much for our country. Hundreds of 
thousands of brave men and women 
have spent years away from their fami-
lies, missing precious moments in their 
families’ lives. Many have seen their 
brothers and sisters in arms be injured 
and killed in battle. Many have suf-
fered life-changing injuries themselves. 
Others have made the ultimate sac-
rifice. On a daily basis, more than 17 
veterans die by suicide every single 
day. A study from Brown University’s 
Costs of War project estimates that 
more than 7,000 servicemembers have 
been killed in post-9/11 operations, and 
a suicide epidemic has claimed more 
than 30,000 Active Duty servicemem-
bers and veterans. 
Given the unimaginable sacrifice our 
troops make for our country, we owe 
them the respect of holding a debate 
and a vote on deploying them into 
harm’s way. I hope that no one serving 
in this body would oppose honoring 
their service and their sacrifice by de-
bating and voting on these life and 
death matters. 
We haven’t shown that respect in my 
view. Washington is known for mili-
tary contractors lobbying for endless 
wars and a bloated Pentagon budget 
while 
our 
investments 
in 
schools, 
healthcare, and jobs at home are ne-
glected. Our military footprint extends 
across dozens of countries far from 
public scrutiny and accountability. In 
Congress we find out about drone 
strikes after they occur in the news. 
My amendment—which I am honored 
to 
be 
joined 
by 
Representatives 
KHANNA, DEFAZIO, SCHAKOWSKY, TLAIB, 
LEVIN, COHEN, and RITCHIE TORRES in 
offering—is a fundamental next step 
toward breaking that cycle. 
This is a question of war and peace 
that should be answered with a re-
corded vote in Congress. 
This amendment does not take a po-
sition on substantive Syria policy 
questions. It merely requires this body 
to follow the Constitution and hold a 
debate and vote to authorize military 
action. I hope that my colleagues will 
agree that our troops and the Amer-
ican people deserve to see this body

hold that debate and then cast their 
vote. 
Under the last administration, Presi-
dent Trump made it clear that U.S. 
military troops in Syria were there to 
secure the oil, but an explicit author-
ization from Congress was never ob-
tained for that purpose. 
I disagree with claims that the 2001 
AUMF—which was about responding to 
the September 11 attacks—authorized 
our troops to engage in hostilities 
against these forces which nobody ar-
gues had anything to do with those at-
tacks or to guard oil fields. 
My colleagues who believe that the 
President does not need specific au-
thorization to deploy U.S. military 
forces to seize Syria’s oil in an uncon-
stitutional war should just admit that 
to their constituents. They don’t care 
about the duty of Congress, the Con-
stitution, or the War Powers Act. 
I agree with what President Biden 
said yesterday at the United Nations 
where he called for a new era of relent-
less diplomacy and that U.S. military 
power must be our tool of last resort, 
not our first, and should not be used as 
an answer to every problem we see 
around the world. 
One step in the right direction would 
be to restore war powers, which is the 
solution put forth in this amendment. 
After U.S. troops clashed with armed 
Syrian villagers last year, now-senior 
Biden NSC advisor Brett McGurk wrote 
on Twitter last year that American 
soldiers with an ill-defined mission in 
Syria are forced to navigate roads con-
trolled by Russian and Syrian regime 
forces. He said that this is too much to 
ask of our brave warriors. 
I agree. And that is why I am seeking 
a vote to show them the minimum re-
spect of doing our constitutional duty 
and either authorizing a mission with 
clear goals and a timeline or bringing 
our troops home to their families. 
I honor and respect the incredible 
sacrifices made by our Kurdish allies. 
Nothing in this amendment supports 
abandoning the Kurdish people, nor do 
I personally support that. The current 
unauthorized U.S. military presence of 
indefinite duration is disrespectful to 
the Kurdish people as it does not pro-
vide them the clarity that they need to 
make their own sovereign decisions 
about how best to protect their people 
and advance their own interests. 
I want to have a transparent and vig-
orous debate in front of the American 
people on the role of the U.S. military 
in Syria. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in support of my 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from South Carolina is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, as I begin, I was 
grateful to support the prior amend-
ment that we just had by President 
GERRY CONNOLLY and also Congressman 
STEVE CHABOT, but I oppose this par-
ticular amendment. 
U.S. troops are in Syria to fight ISIS. 
They were sent by President Barack 
Obama pursuant to the 2001 counterter-
rorism AUMF. The global war on ter-
rorism is not over. It is moving, as we 
have sadly seen, the terrorist attack 
last week in New Zealand and as we see 
the terrorists who are coming across 
the southern border into the United 
States. 
For years we have worked with our 
partners on the ground to eliminate 
the caliphate. We must not leave them 
behind as they have been brave patri-
ots and could be subject to murderous 
terrorists. 
This mission has been incredibly suc-
cessful. However, the job is not done. 
The threat of ISIS against American 
families and our allies remains. The 
nations that have faced the most cross- 
border attacks are India with 60,000 
deaths; Israel with—just this year, in 
the past couple of months—12,000 Ira-
nian rockets by an attack by Hamas 
from Gaza; and, of course, in America 
3,000 persons murdered on 9/11. 
Our 
continued 
presence 
on 
the 
ground is necessary to ensure the en-
during defeat of ISIS and protecting 
American families by defeating terror-
ists overseas. 
This shortsighted amendment would 
prematurely cut short our presence in 
Syria. Our small force in Syria is in-
credibly effective and part of the global 
coalition to defeat ISIS. This is not the 
time for America to abandon our allies 
and partners in Syria in the global war 
on terrorism. None of us want our sol-
diers overseas longer than absolutely 
necessary, but forcing a withdrawal too 
soon only ensures we will have to re-
turn as we saw in Iraq when the troops 
were withdrawn too soon, and U.S. 
troops had to go in just a few years 
later to fight ISIS. 
b 1530 
In my opinion, we are seeing this 
play out again, sadly, in Afghanistan 
as the country is a safe haven for Is-
lamic extremists to provide for suicide 
bomber attacks on families in India, 
Israel, and America. 
We must avoid a similar situation in 
Syria. Withdrawals should be based on 
the defeat of ISIS, not an artificial 
timeline. We know the success of peace 
through strength, and we also know of 
failure by war through appeasement. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, al-
though I would like to point out that I 
agree very much with my colleague 
from New York of the appreciation of 
our Kurdish allies. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

in 
support 
of 
the 
Mfume-Neguse 
amendment which will codify Congress’ 
support for small businesses across the 
country, particularly as it relates to 
this defense bill. 
This amendment increases the over-
all Federal contracting goal for eligible 
small businesses from 23 to 25 percent. 
But more specifically, the amendment 
also increases the Federal contracting 
subgoals in different areas. 
For example, for service-disabled vet-
erans, who we always talk about and

September 22, 2021 
sometimes do something about, this is 
an important aspect of this amendment 
because, for service-disabled veterans, 
this increases the contracting goal 
from 3 to 4 percent, over a year or two. 
For qualified small businesses, it in-
creases the Historically Underutilized 
Business Zone contracting goals from 3 
to 4 percent. 
And for qualified women-owned and 
controlled businesses, it increases the 
contracting goals from 5 to 7 percent; 
which I think is significant for women- 
owned businesses and, as I said before, 
those disabled veteran businesses. 
For small businesses that are owned 
by socially-disadvantaged individuals, 
it increases the contracting goal to 15 
percent, and it does that over 4 years 
incrementally. 
This is an extremely rare oppor-
tunity for us to do something in this 
particular bill about the people who 
are going to be benefiting from the bill 
and the people who have worked so 
hard in and out and around the defense 
industry who are small businesses in 
our country, veteran-owned businesses, 
women-owned 
businesses, 
minority- 
owned businesses. 
And at the beginning and the end of 
the day, Madam Speaker, this is a sim-
ple amendment aimed at growing con-
tracting opportunities for those cat-
egories. And again, this is not a man-
date; these are goals, and we think 
they are very achievable. 
I would urge consideration, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
MEUSER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
though I agree with Mr. MFUME that we 
need to find ways to incentivize and en-
courage agencies to contract with 
small businesses, very much so, I do 
not believe this is the correct ap-
proach. 
This amendment, unfortunately, does 
not actually incentivize more contract 
with small businesses in a meaningful 
way. There are many underlying fac-
tors 
affecting 
the 
small 
business 
goaling numbers that must be ad-
dressed first before we raising the 
goals. We need more effective solutions 
to increasing contracting with small 
businesses. 
First, the amendment does not ad-
dress the concern of small businesses 
leaving the Federal marketplace at a 
very rapid rate. In fact, the amend-
ment only incentivizes more dollars go 
to small businesses, which can easily 
be achieved by awarding huge con-
tracts to a handful of mature small 
businesses, which can arguably be 
viewed as flouting the purpose of the 
goals themselves. It does nothing to 
incentivize agencies to contract with a 
greater number of small businesses, 
which is critical to maintaining a 
healthy 
and 
competitive 
industrial 
base. 
Second, the Small Business Com-
mittee has taken several actions over 
the years to understand and address 
the problems of agencies overreporting 
their small business goals. This issue is 
still a work in progress. Some of these 
dollars purported to have gone to small 
businesses may have gone to large 
businesses, perhaps legally, likely le-
gally. However, agencies are permitted 
to report all dollars as going to small 
businesses when this may not truly be 
the case. 
Similarly, issues with double count-
ing of the goals continue to exist. Rais-
ing the goals won’t do enough—won’t 
really do anything to increase the 
transparency or accuracy as currently 
reported. We need to know whether the 
government is truly meeting its goals 
before we can consider raising them. 
Third, it may be simply be too pre-
mature to raise some of those goals my 
colleague proposes to raise. The gov-
ernment has never met its HUBzone 
goal, yet the amendment raises the 
goal from 3 to 4 percent, while the pre-
vious goals, as stated, have never been 
met. 
Similarly, with the women-owned 
small business goal, which has been 
met only a few times in nonconsecutive 
years, raising that as well does not 
seem it would have the result that we 
are seeking. 
Lastly, the SBA is undergoing some 
significant changes to its government 
contracting programs; namely, begin-
ning to fully certify women-owned 
small businesses and service-disabled 
veteran-owned small businesses. These 
goaling numbers presumably capture 
awards made to firms that self-cer-
tified as women-owned, or service-dis-
abled veteran-owned. Once the SBA be-
gins to start certifying firms and self- 
certification is no longer an option, we 
should expect to see a correlative dip 
in these two goals since there will be 
less vendors for agencies to choose 
from. It may be prudent to wait and 
see the true picture of where the gov-
ernment stands on these goals, once 
these front-end certification programs 
are fully in place, rather than raising 
them now. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I 
would respectfully disagree with the 
gentleman in his opposition. There are 
a couple of things that I think are im-
portant to be pointed out. 
As the vice chair of the Small Busi-
ness Committee of the House, I con-
tinue to hear the stories from women- 
owned businesses, veteran businesses, 
minority-owned businesses, and those 
that are socially and economically dis-
advantaged, that they want this; that 
they believe that if you increase these 
goals, things then will change. 
By the way, these goals are aspira-
tional; that is why they are called 
goals. This is not a mandate; not say-
ing that we are going to move 1 year to 
another. It is all aspirational. And we 
believe it is the right thing to do; oth-
erwise I don’t know what we go back 
and say to those different groups of in-
dividuals. 
Now, 
Republican 
and 
Democratic 
Members alike on this committee have 
heard over and over again about how 
we ought to do more; how we ought to 
push the government to actually do 
what it ought to be doing in many re-
spects. But, again, this is an aspira-
tional goal. 
These are very, very small increases. 
And as we talk about defense con-
tracting and the ability of minority 
businesses, 
women-owned 
businesses 
and, even more importantly, as I have 
said before, service-disabled veteran 
businesses to be able to compete with 
some real hope of being able to benefit. 
I would really urge passage of this 
amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, although I very much share 
my colleague, Mr. MFUME’s goal and 
idea, conceptually, in seeing more con-
tract dollars be awarded to small busi-
ness, I do not believe this is the correct 
approach. 
As a member of the Small Business 
Committee’s Contracting and Infra-
structure Subcommittee, I look for-
ward to working with him, and cer-
tainly others, to address the under-
lying challenging our small businesses 
are facing in such contracting. 
I do not support this amendment, and 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, how 
much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 11⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I look 
forward to the gentleman, not only 
being on the committee, but agreeing 
and certainly offering the invitation to 
work together. My hope is that this 
passes; and, if it does, then I would ex-
tend to him the opportunity to do that, 
and I would join with him in doing that 
to make sure the already existing goals 
are achievable, and the aspirational 
goals really represent a ray of hope for 
these four groups. 
And I don’t favor one over another, 
except that it is hard for me to look at 
a service-disabled veteran who is try-
ing to do business in a bill dealing with 
defense, and to be able to say, well, I 
am sorry, we just didn’t do it again. 
So I would close—I appreciate the 
gentleman’s 
opposition, 
although 
I 
don’t agree with it, and I would urge 
passage of this amendment, Madam 
Speaker. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. MFUME). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. MFUME). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it.

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

AMENDMENT NO. 28 OFFERED BY MR. KHANNA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 28 
printed in part C of House Report 117– 
125. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the appropriate place in subtitle C of 
title XIII, insert the following: 
SEC. 13ll. PROHIBITION ON SUPPORT OR MILI-
TARY PARTICIPATION AGAINST THE 
HOUTHIS. 
(a) PROHIBITION RELATING
TO SUPPORT.— 
None of the funds authorized to be appro-
priated or otherwise made available by this 
Act may be made available to provide the 
following forms of United States support to 
Saudi-led coalition’s operations against the 
Houthis in Yemen: 
(1) Sharing intelligence for the purpose of 
enabling offensive coalition strikes. 
(2) Providing logistical support for coali-
tion strikes, including by providing mainte-
nance or transferring spare parts to coalition 
members flying warplanes engaged in anti- 
Houthi bombings. 
(b) PROHIBITION
RELATING
TO
MILITARY 
PARTICIPATION.—None of the funds author-
ized to be appropriated or otherwise made 
available by this Act may be made available 
for any civilian or military personnel of the 
Department of Defense to command, coordi-
nate, participate in the movement of, or ac-
company the regular or irregular military 
forces of the Saudi and United Arab Emir-
ates-led 
coalition 
forces 
in 
hostilities 
against the Houthis in Yemen or in situa-
tions in which there exists an imminent 
threat that such coalition forces become en-
gaged in such hostilities, unless and until 
the President has obtained specific statutory 
authorization, in accordance with section 
8(a) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 
1547(a)). 
(c) RULE
OF CONSTRUCTION.—The prohibi-
tions under this section may not be con-
strued to apply with respect to United States 
Armed Forces engaged in operations directed 
at al Qaeda or associated forces. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. KHANNA) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to offer my amendment with Chairman 
SMITH, with Chairman SCHIFF, and Rep-
resentative JAYAPAL, to finally end the 
humanitarian disaster in Yemen that 
has been going on year after year. 
Our amendment would end all U.S. 
logistical support and transfer of spare 
parts for Saudi warplanes that are 
bombing Yemen; that are bombing 
schools; that are killing children; that 
are bombing civilians in the largest hu-
manitarian crisis around the world. 
Now, this body passed the War Pow-
ers Resolution to say that we would 
not be aiding the Saudi offensive in 
Yemen. President Trump suspended the 
fueling of those planes, and President 
Biden made that policy formal. 
And yet, the Saudis have not lis-
tened. Yet, they have a blockade 
where, just last month, in August, in 
the Port of Hodeidah, no fuel was let 
in. They come and they tell the United 
States one thing: We are letting fuel 
in. They lie, again and again they lie. 
There is a reason the 9/11 families 
wanted transparency and the decom-
missioning of the reports. There is a 
reason there was outrage in all of this 
country when they brutally murdered 
Khashoggi. 
They need accountability, and we are 
not going to use taxpayer dollars to 
give them equipment for their planes 
to bomb Yemeni’s kids. 
Now of course the Houthis are to 
blame as well. No one says the Houthis 
are blameless. Of course they are to 
blame, and of course they have had 
human rights violations. 
But the point is, the United States 
should not be making this war con-
tinue by arming or by giving parts to 
the Saudis that end up facilitating the 
conflict or elongating the conflict and 
killing people. It is time for the Saudis 
to recognize what everyone recognizes, 
that they have lost in Yemen. It is 
time for them to end the blockade, and 
it is time for them to allow a peace 
process that has a ceasefire in Yemen 
and a civilian government, instead of 
trying to win this by force. 
So I hope that everyone who sup-
ported our amendment last time—it 
passed 240–185 in this body—Jake Sul-
livan, who is the National Security 
Council Adviser; Wendy Sherman, who 
is the Deputy Secretary of State; Rob 
Malley, who is the envoy to Iran, all 
supported it. So I hope the administra-
tion will support it this time, that it 
won’t get stripped out of conference; 
and that it will pass, and we will fi-
nally begin to end this war. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1545 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from South Carolina is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, we are all concerned 
about the ongoing war in Yemen, in-
cluding civilian casualties in the con-
flict with the Houthis murderously 
using civilians as human shields. 
The Iran-backed Houthis continue to 
launch indiscriminate attacks against 
the Saudi homeland, threatening Saudi 
civilians and more than 70,000 Amer-
ican citizens residing in Saudi Arabia. 
These murderous attacks target ci-
vilians and civilian infrastructure, like 
the Abha International Airport, caus-
ing death, injury, and damage to prop-
erty. This is an intentional targeting 
of civilians and is in no way a military 
target. 
The terrorist-supporting regime of 
Iran is using the Houthis as proxies in 
the ongoing global war on terrorism. 
We cannot forget the pain and suf-
fering that the Houthis themselves 
have inflicted on the Yemeni citizens 
with the Houthi brutal subjugation and 
occupation. 
One-sided initiatives that restrict 
U.S. support for Saudi Arabia, in word 
or deed, only telegraph more vulnera-
bility that will lead to further attacks 
by the Houthis. We know the success of 
peace through strength and the failure 
of war through appeasement. 
It is encouraging that, in recent 
weeks, the Biden administration’s mes-
saging has focused strongly on the 
Houthis’ intransigence in ending the 
conflict in Yemen, calling on the 
Houthis to agree to a comprehensive 
cease-fire immediately. 
We must stop terrorists overseas to 
protect our allies who are targeted by 
the terrorists. India has lost over 60,000 
persons due to cross-border terrorism; 
Israel, this year, has had to face nearly 
12,000 rockets provided by Iran to the 
Hamas terrorists in Gaza; and, sadly, 
we noted the 20th anniversary of 3,000 
Americans killed on September 11, 2001. 
We should be using our longstanding 
relationship with the Saudis to press 
them to take every possible precaution 
to prevent civilian casualties. For 
nearly a century, there has been a 
warm cultural, educational, military, 
and economic partnership with the peo-
ple of Saudi Arabia. 
But this amendment is too far de-
tached from the sad realities of the 
Houthi attacks across the border and 
in Yemen. The drones and rockets have 
been provided by the terrorist-spon-
soring regime of Iran, which oppresses 
its citizens and defames the extraor-
dinary heritage of Persia. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SCHIFF), the distin-
guished chair of the Intelligence Com-
mittee. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in 
strong 
support 
of 
the 
Khanna 
amendment. I am very grateful to Rep-
resentative KHANNA for his leadership. 
Yemen and its people are suffering 
through a catastrophic tragedy. Six-
teen million in Yemen are at risk of 
famine. This year alone, 400,000 chil-
dren may die from severe malnutrition 
made so much worse by the conflict 
raging there. 
Today, we have a powerful oppor-
tunity to help bring an end to this suf-
fering by terminating the U.S. decision 
to provide military assistance to the 
Saudi Arabian coalition fueling Yem-
en’s civil war. Our participation in this 
suffering simply cannot continue. We 
cannot be a party to the death of chil-
dren and innocent civilians. 
This is why I urge an emphatic ‘‘yes’’ 
in support of this amendment, to bring 
an end to the U.S. funding of the 
Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.

September 22, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to reit-
erate and join, actually, with my col-
leagues to point out that it has been 
encouraging in recent weeks that the 
Biden administration has changed its 
messaging to strongly focus on the 
Houthis’ intransigence in ending the 
conflict in Yemen and calling for the 
Houthis to agree to a comprehensive 
cease-fire immediately, as we also rec-
ognize, again, that we have had a 100- 
year relationship with the people of 
Saudi Arabia that has been so mutu-
ally beneficial for the people of Saudi 
Arabia, the United States, and our al-
lies. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I will 
end with this. A year ago, this exact 
amendment passed this body 240–185. 
The war has only gotten worse. Saudi 
Arabia has not lived up to its commit-
ment to lift the blockade. The Saudis 
have not lived up to their commitment 
to stop the offensive strikes. 
I hope that this amendment will pass 
with an even bigger majority this time, 
and I hope the people in the adminis-
tration, who supported this amend-
ment as private civilians, will support 
it in their current roles. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from California (Mr. KHANNA). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. KHANNA). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

the House of Representatives. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. MEEKS) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak on Meeks amendment No. 30. 
The facts are plain. Saudi Arabia and 
its partners have perpetuated a cata-
strophic and devastating military cam-
paign in Yemen since 2015, with no end 
in sight and without regard to civilian 
casualties. 
Saudi Arabia’s brutal Yemen war has 
resulted in the world’s largest humani-
tarian crisis, pushed millions of Yem-
enis to starvation, and decimated Yem-
en’s civilian infrastructure. 
Although the frequency and the in-
tensity of the Saudi military’s bomb-
ing campaign has decreased as it has 
engaged in efforts to end the war 
through 
international 
negotiations, 
unfortunately strikes resulting in ci-
vilian casualties have continued. 
Between January and March 2021, 
airstrike incidents causing civilian 
casualties in Yemen actually increased 
as compared to the previous 3-month 
period at the end of 2020. 
On one such strike on March 7, 2021, 
Saudi aircraft bombed the residential 
areas in Sanaa for the first time in 
months, leaving four civilians injured. 
Later in March and into April, fur-
ther strikes continued, striking trans-
portation 
infrastructure, 
residential 
areas, and a marketplace, leaving doz-
ens of civilians injured, including two 
children. 
The Biden administration took the 
important step earlier this year of sus-
pending the deliveries of certain weap-
ons to the Saudi military in response 
to this pattern of actions, as well as 
appointing 
veteran 
diplomat 
Tim 
Lenderking 
as 
Special 
Envoy 
to 
Yemen. 
However, despite these actions and 
repeated congressional statements and 
efforts, the Saudi air force has contin-
ued conducting strikes in Yemen that 
have resulted in civilian casualties 
using U.S. support. 
That is why I am introducing this 
amendment, with the support of Rep-
resentatives DEUTCH
and LIEU
and 
Chairmen SMITH and SCHIFF, to sus-
pend U.S. sustainment and mainte-
nance to Saudi air units conducting 
strikes that result in Yemeni civilian 
casualties. 
My amendment also requires a thor-
ough set of reporting requirements to 
Congress on the extent and details of 
Saudi offensive air operations and ci-
vilian casualties. 
It also includes exceptions for nec-
essary 
counterterrorism 
operations 
against al-Qaida and its affiliates, ter-
ritorial air defense, and defense of U.S. 
personnel and facilities. 
Houthi militants and the Iranian 
military continue to launch explosive- 
laden drones and ballistic missiles into 
Saudi Arabia at civilian areas and in-
frastructure, 
including 
many 
areas

where American civilians live and 
work. 
While we seek to urgently address 
the tragic toll of civilian casualties 
borne by Yemeni civilians as a result of 
the Saudi military’s expansive air cam-
paign, we recognize that Saudi Arabia 
does have a right and a need to defend 
itself, which this amendment provides 
for. 
In short, by suspending ongoing 
sustainment and maintenance of Saudi 
aircraft shown to have conducted air-
strikes resulting in civilian casualties, 
we take a critical and necessary step to 
ensuring the United States is not 
complicit in or supportive of this de-
structive, tragic war. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from South Carolina is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition, 
with the great appreciation of our 
chairman, GREG MEEKS—great appre-
ciation, even if I disagree. 
We are all concerned about the ongo-
ing war in Yemen, including the civil-
ian casualties in the conflict due to the 
Houthis using human shields. 
However, sadly, many are focused 
disproportionately on Saudi Arabia 
while the Iran-backed Houthis con-
tinue to terrorize the people of Yemen 
and launch intentional, indiscriminate 
attacks against the Saudi homeland of 
innocent civilians, where 70,000 Ameri-
cans live and work. 
We need to be aware of how the rhet-
oric in America regarding Saudi Arabia 
and the Yemen war empowers the 
Houthis to engage in further aggres-
sion with the murderous, intentional 
attacks on Saudi citizens, using drones 
and rockets provided by the terrorist- 
sponsoring regime in Iran, which op-
presses its citizens and defames the ex-
traordinary heritage of Persia. Iran 
perpetuates the ongoing global war on 
terrorism. 
It is encouraging that, in recent 
weeks, the Biden administration’s mes-
saging has strongly focused on the 
Houthis’ intransigence in ending the 
conflict in Yemen, calling on the 
Houthis to agree to a comprehensive 
cease-fire immediately. 
Additionally, the President already 
announced his plan to end U.S. support 
for offensive operations in Yemen, in-
cluding relevant arms sales. 
We should wait and see the results of 
this new policy before adding further 
legislative restrictions. We should be 
using our longstanding relationship 
with the Saudis to press them to take 
every precaution against civilian cas-
ualties. For nearly a century, there has 
been a warm cultural, educational, 
military, and economic partnership 
with the wonderful people of Saudi 
Arabia. 
While the amendment contains speci-
fied exceptions, it does not address the 
core challenge of trying to rehabilitate 
the U.S.-Saudi partnership while try-
ing to improve Saudi actions with re-
spect to civilian protections as Houthis 
murderously use human shields. 
I do not think this amendment helps 
protect our national security interests 
in the Middle East, nor will it measur-
ably change Saudi actions. We should 
be standing for the success of peace 
through strength and not the failure of 
war through appeasement. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. DEUTCH), the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Middle East, North 
Africa and Global Counterterrorism of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has only 11⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. MEEKS. I yield the balance of 
my time to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DEUTCH). 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of Chairman MEEKS’ 
amendment, which would clarify and 
advance the administration’s January 
decision to suspend offensive support 
for the Saudi-led coalition’s operations 
in Yemen. 
The crisis in Yemen continues to dev-
astate innocent civilians who suffer at 
the hands of Houthi assaults, coalition 
airstrikes, and a de facto blockade that 
hinders the transit of necessary goods, 
like food, fuel, and medicine. 
The war in Yemen will not be solved 
by military operations. The parties 
must commit to political negotiations 
to end this conflict. But as military op-
erations continue, it is critical that 
the United States does not play a role 
in supporting further civilian blood-
shed. 
This amendment requires the Depart-
ment of State and Department of De-
fense to ascertain whether any coali-
tion strikes resulted in civilian casual-
ties and, in turn, suspend U.S. support 
and maintenance to those units. 
The House voted overwhelmingly to 
end U.S. support for the Saudi coali-
tion’s offensive, and it is imperative 
that we follow through on that promise 
while ensuring that we protect the 
vital interests of the United States. 
We cannot allow human suffering in 
Yemen to continue unabated. Children 
are starving. COVID is raging. Enough 
is enough. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
MEEKS for his leadership, and I urge 
support for this amendment. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I will disagree with 
Chairman TED
DEUTCH. Usually, we 
agree. 
Additionally, I disagree with Chair-
man GREG MEEKS, but I do appreciate 
the chairman’s recognition of the Ira-
nian and Houthi drone attacks on civil-
ian communities where large numbers 
of Americans live. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I en-
courage my colleagues to vote for this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

mon identifiers wherever possible, and con-
tains current and historical data regarding 
such information.

fied data on race, ethnicity, tribal affili-
ation, gender, disability, sexual orientation, 
veteran status, and whether the appointee is

combination, to the greatest level detail pos-
sible without allowing the identification of 
individual appointees. 
‘‘(B) OPTION

NOT
SPECIFY.—When col-
lecting each category of data described in

lowed an option to not specify with respect

‘‘(C) CONSULTATION.—The Director shall 
consult with the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs of the Senate re-
garding reports published under this sub-

mation or other changes are needed for such 
reports. 
‘‘(3) EXCLUSION OF CAREER POSITIONS.—For 
purposes of applying the term ‘appointee’ in 
this subsection, such term does not include 
any individual appointed to a position de-
scribed in subsection (a)(5)(F).’’. 
(2) CLERICAL
AMENDMENT.—The table of 
sections for subchapter I of chapter 33 of

AND
REPORT.—Not later 
than 1 year after the date such website is es-
tablished, the Comptroller General shall con-
duct a review, and issue a briefing or report,

the amendments made by this subtitle. The 
review shall include— 
(A) the quality of data required to be col-
lected and whether such data is complete, 
accurate, timely, and reliable; 
(B) any challenges experienced by agencies 
in 
implementing 
this

amendments made by this subtitle; and 
(C) any suggestions or modifications to en-
hance compliance with this subtitle and the 
amendments made by this subtitle, including 
best practices for agencies to follow. 
(2) SUNSET
OF
PLUM
BOOK.—Beginning on 
January 1, 2024, such website shall serve as 
the public directory for policy and sup-
porting positions in the Government, and the 
publication entitled ‘‘United States Govern-
ment Policy and Supporting Positions’’, 
commonly referred to as the ‘‘Plum Book’’, 
shall no longer be issued or published. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. CARO-
LYN B. MALONEY) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of this amendment, which con-
tains my bill to increase transparency 
and accountability of senior leaders in 
the executive branch, called the Peri-
odically Listing Updates to Manage-
ment Act or PLUM Act. 
This bill would require the Office of 
Personnel Management to maintain a 
current publicly available online direc-
tory of senior government leaders. 
Currently, a comprehensive list of 
people appointed by the President is 
available only once every four years in 
a publication referred to as the Plum 
Book. 
The Plum Book provides only a snap-
shot in time and does not reflect 
changes that occur between publica-
tions. As a result, current information 
about senior administration officials is 
often outdated and difficult to find. In 
the digital age, providing Americans 
with a list of top Federal officials once 
every four years is simply unaccept-
able. 
This 
bill 
would 
implement 
rec-
ommendations made by the Govern-
ment Accountability Office and the Ad-
ministrative Conference of the United 
States by modernizing and expanding 
the current publication of the Plum 
Book and aligning it with modern data 
standards. 
The Committee on Oversight and Re-
form considered this bill in June of this 
year, and it was approved on a voice 
vote. 
The Senate Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs Committee ap-
proved a similar bill last Congress with 
broad 
bipartisan 
support, 
and 
the 
PLUM Act has been strongly endorsed 
by a bipartisan group of more than two 
dozen civil society organizations and 
experts. 
I want to thank my cosponsors on 
the bill: Representatives CONNOLLY, 
SARBANES, NORTON, MFUME, and CAS-
TRO. 
I also want to thank my colleague, 
Representative OCASIO-CORTEZ for in-
troducing the Political Appointments 
Inclusion and Diversity Act, which re-
quires OPM to coordinate with the 
White House to make a summary of de-
mographic information on political ap-
pointees publicly available. The re-
quirements in her bill are included in 
the PLUM Act. 
We should be working together and 
working toward making our govern-
ment more transparent for the Amer-
ican people and more representative of 
everyone in our country. The PLUM 
Act would provide timely and trans-
parent information about senior gov-
ernment officials who are making deci-
sions impacting the lives of millions. It 
would shine a light on who is at the 
table in our government and who is 
not. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to amendment 35, and I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The amendment would establish an 
online public directory of political ap-
pointees at the Office of Personnel 
Management. 
I want to thank Ranking Member 
ROGERS for his extraordinary leader-
ship throughout this process. I want to 
echo his words from his opening testi-
mony on Monday before the House 
Rules Committee where he urged the 
committee to ‘‘keep out superfluous 
amendments that are not related to 
the Department of Defense.’’ 
Unfortunately, this advice fell upon 
deaf ears with regard to this particular 
amendment. This politically charged 
amendment is wholly outside HASC’s 
jurisdiction. It does not belong in the 
NDAA. 
This lies solely within the jurisdic-
tion of the House Oversight and Re-
form Committee, and the reasoning as 
to why we are debating this as a meas-
ure in the NDAA is absolutely beyond 
me. 
The Plum Book is already available 
online, and as of 2012 has already been 
published in a more searchable and ac-
cessible format. Given that the Plum 
Book is already accessible online in 
two separate locations, there is no jus-
tification whatsoever for the measure’s 
authorization for $7 million in appro-
priated taxpayer money to build this 
new online database. 
This amendment goes beyond the 
original intent of the Plum Book by 
creating 
a 
continuously 
updated 
website listing thousands of political 
appointees and senior government offi-
cials, which may dissuade good people 
from serving in future Presidential ad-
ministrations and risk abuse by ena-
bling political targeting. 
A tool that is updated monthly is not 
a transitional resource between admin-
istrations but, rather, a database that 
can be readily exploited by political ac-
tivists to track down and target politi-
cally appointed leaders. 
Political appointees are already ac-
countable to the duly elected President 
whom they serve, and the President, of 
course, is accountable to the American 
people every 4 years and to Congress 
each day of his or her term. 
Even more concerning is requiring 
the OPM Director to publish a report 
containing information on any ap-
pointee’s demographics, including self- 
identified data on race, ethnicity, Trib-
al affiliation, gender, disability, sexual 
orientation, veteran status, and wheth-
er the appointee is over the age of 40. 
Although the bill language claims to 
make the information anonymous, the 
mere fact that OPM would be in posses-
sion 
of 
this 
personal 
information, 
which is utterly unrelated and immate-
rial to the position to which the person 
is 
being 
appointed, 
could 
have 
a 
chilling effect on future political ap-
pointees. 
Additionally, there appear to be no 
safeguards in this amendment pro-
tecting this personal information from 
subsequent 
disclosure, 
whether 
through a FOIA request or a cyber

breach. We have already seen during 
this 
Congress 
the 
multiple 
cyber 
breaches at various Federal agencies. 
If we can’t secure the information 
collected by the Federal Government, 
then the government shouldn’t be in 
possession of that information to begin 
with. 
This provision in and of itself is egre-
gious. 
Transparency and accountability are 
essential to our constitutional govern-
ment, but this amendment neglects the 
necessary safeguards to protect Fed-
eral employees. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues, 
what protections are in the PLUM Act 
to ensure that the database cannot be 
abused by activists to target and har-
ass public officials? 
What 
protections 
exist 
in 
this 
amendment to protect officials who are 
serving in sensitive, national security 
positions? 
Why is it truly necessary, given that 
political appointees are already ac-
countable to the public through their 
service under an elected President? 
Don’t you agree that this sensitive, 
private information this amendment 
seeks is not appropriate for the govern-
ment to be collecting from our civil 
servants? 
Shouldn’t we instead be concerned 
about the effectiveness of our govern-
ment leadership? 
This amendment is a slippery slope 
to requiring, collecting, and publishing 
the same information about our broad-
er Federal workforce. 
Until these questions can be an-
swered with sound policy, and our Fed-
eral agencies can guarantee the cyber-
security and other security of this in-
formation, I urge my colleagues to op-
pose this nongermane amendment. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say 
that I disagree with the gentleman 
strongly. We need to move into the 
modern age. Right now all information 
is on the internet. It is digital and it is 
available. The bill would merely re-
quire the Office of Personnel Manage-
ment to maintain a current, publicly 
available, online directory of senior 
government officials so that anyone 
could access it at any time. 
A comprehensive list is already out 
there, as you said, but it is printed 
only once every four years in a book 
that is called the Plum Book, and it is 
only a snapshot. It is not up to date. 
This bill is about modernizing the 
Plum Book and aligning it to modern 
data standards. That is what this is 
about. 
Information on senior leaders in gov-
ernment may already be obtained by 
outside groups through FOIA, freedom 
of information requests, or paid sub-
scription services. There are paid sub-
scription services, and you can get it 
through a freedom of information. So 
it is available. 
OPM civil service regulations stipu-
late that certain information from per-
sonnel records for current and former 
Federal employees is available to the 
public, including names, present and 
past position titles, salaries, position 
descriptions, and duty stations. 
Federal employees generally have no 
expectation of privacy regarding this 
information. It is available on all of us. 
It is available by private means, it is 
available 
through 
other 
means, 
through the FOIA, so why not make it 
available and easily used by the public? 
I want to answer the gentleman’s 
claim that identifying appointees pub-
licly puts them at risk of political 
demonstrations or may make them not 
want to serve or whatever. He men-
tioned that this was a negative. 
My time is running out, but right 
now there is an exception for national 
security positions that is recognized 
and reporting on demographic informa-
tion is important to get to the public, 
too. 
I strongly support this bill. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, I would just urge opposition to 
this nongermane, intrusive, and over-
reaching amendment. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 2043’s inclusion in the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. 
I want to thank the distinguished Chair-
woman of the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform for working with Mr. SARBANES and me 
to improve the bicameral Periodically Listing 
Updates to Management (PLUM) Act. 
And I want to thank Mr. SMITH for including 
this provision in the NDAA. 
This provision builds on my previous efforts 
to make government more transparent and ac-
countable. 
This provision seeks to update and mod-
ernize the ‘‘Plum Book,’’ which is a publication 
that includes a comprehensive list of positions 
appointed by the president and the individuals 
who hold those positions. 
Because it is published every four years, the 
Plum Book provides only a snapshot in time 
and does not reflect changes that occur be-
tween publications. The publication, therefore, 
is almost immediately outdated. 
Moreover, it is often inaccurate, listing posi-
tions that no longer exist in government or 
missing newly-established ones. 
To provide more timely, transparent, and ac-
curate information, the PLUM Act provisions 
would require: the Office of Personnel Man-
agement (OPM) to develop and maintain a 
publicly accessible website with data on senior 
leaders in government that meets modem data 
standards; all federal agencies to share data 
on senior officials with OPM; and OPM to co-
ordinate with the White House every six 
months to confirm that information is com-
plete, accurate, reliable, and up to date. 
Information on senior leaders in government 
is already available—although you have to 
make a Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, 
request to get it. 
OPM civil service regulations stipulate that 
certain information from personnel records for 
current and former federal employees be 
available to the public, including names, 
present and past position titles, salaries, posi-
tion descriptions, and duty stations. 
The people we serve have a right to know 
who is serving them. And they should not 
have to file endless information requests to 
get that information. 
And OPM guidance already provides excep-
tions to the release of the names of individuals 
in sensitive national security positions. 
The bill also begins federal efforts to track 
the demographics of our senior leaders in fed-
eral government. 
It also allows individuals to opt out of pro-
viding such demographic data. So no potential 
applicant will be forced to share their demo-
graphic information. It’s voluntary and helps us 
determine whether our nation’s leadership re-
flects the population it serves. 
The PLUM Act is about promoting account-
ability in our federal government leaders. And 
it already strikes the right balance between 
privacy and transparency. 
In the 116th Congress, the PLUM Act was 
favorably reported out of the House Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform and the Sen-
ate Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs. This Congress, it’s time 
for enactment. 
The PLUM Act implements Government Ac-
countability Office recommendations, and is 
endorsed by 24 bipartisan organizations and 
experts. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legisla-
tion and urge its inclusion in the NDAA. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 667, the previous question is or-
dered on the amendment offered by the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4946 
September 22, 2021 
I think we can all agree that commu-
nity confidence in law enforcement is 
at an all-time low, and a huge factor in 
this loss of confidence is the mili-
tarization of our police departments 
across the Nation. 
This trend has been exacerbated by 
the 1033 program that creates a pipe-
line to transfer surplus military weap-
ons from war zones directly to domes-
tic law enforcement agencies. 
These 
law 
enforcement 
agencies, 
without consent of the civilian au-
thorities, obtain military grade weap-
onry directly from the war zones of 
Iraq and Afghanistan, and it is the ci-
vilian authorities who should decide 
whether such equipment is needed, not 
the law enforcement agencies them-
selves. 
The approval of city councils, county 
commissions, and other civilian au-
thorities is bypassed under the 1033 
program, and this amendment would 
fix that. It would stop law enforcement 
agencies from acquiring military-grade 
weaponry without the consent of the 
governed. 
They oftentimes have no need for 
these weapons of war, nor are they 
trained as to how and when to use the 
equipment, but a requirement in the 
1033 program mandates that the ac-
quired equipment be placed into use 
within 12 months of acquisition. This 
mandate has resulted in the misuse of 
the equipment and abuse of civilians 
against whom it was used. 
The result has been communities 
alienated and a loss of confidence in 
law enforcement. Momentum is build-
ing toward reform of the 1033 program. 
American communities are not and 
should not be turned into battlefields, 
and 
people 
in 
those 
communities 
should not be looked at as enemy com-
batants. 
The ending of the war in Afghanistan 
makes it even more important than 
ever that we close down this pipeline of 
military-grade weapons from foreign 
war zones to the streets of our Nation. 
Over 17,000 pieces of military equip-
ment have been declared excess or sur-
plus and sent to the Defense Logistics 
Agency for distribution on our streets. 
The time is now to act, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amend-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1615 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself 30 seconds. 
I fully support our law enforcement 
community, and particularly those in 
small and rural communities like those 
that pepper my entire congressional 
district. Those are the ones that ben-
efit the most from the 1033 program. 
Limiting military equipment trans-
fers would significantly impede their 
ability to do their jobs to keep us safe. 
We need to be supporting our law en-
forcement community, not making 
their missions more difficult. 
For that reason I oppose this amend-
ment and urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, a small law enforcement agency 
being able to order massive amounts of 
military equipment directly from the 
battlefields of this country and to do it 
without consent of the governed is 
wrong, and that is what this amend-
ment will get at. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN), 
my friend and colleague, and a great 
member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Alabama for yielding me time to 
speak on the importance of section 1033 
of the military surplus program. 
My Democratic colleagues frequently 
argue the 1033 program exists to mili-
tarize our police by providing lethal 
equipment. They claim the program 
transfers weapons of war to the police. 
They continue to perpetuate this mis-
leading narrative to advance their dan-
gerous crusade against law enforce-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I have spoken with law 
enforcement in my district. The 1033 
program has helped them acquire a 
number of needed pieces of equipment, 
including heavy rescue vehicles. 
In 2015, a perpetrator in Polk County, 
Florida, my home district, wearing a 
bulletproof vest infiltrated a police 
line and had a shootout with our SWAT 
team. He had a stockpile of weapons, 
including AR–15s and AK–47s, and he 
used them to fire 93 rounds at deputies 
attempting to take him into custody. 
Sadly, John Mikula, a Polk County 
EMT, was shot and injured during the 
shootout. 
If not for this armored SWAT mili-
tary surplus vehicle acquired through 
the 1033 program, more deputies might 
have been injured or killed. 
The 1033 program provides law en-
forcement agencies with needed heavy- 
duty equipment at little to no cost. 
It is taxpayer friendly and efficient 
to recycle, reuse, and extend the life of 
equipment bought by taxpayers. It 
would be wasteful to simply discard 
this gear. 
Many of the types of vehicles are also 
used during hurricane recovery to res-
cue stranded citizens. The 1033 program 
also provides tents, generators, and air 
conditioners that are used for natural 
disaster field facilities. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a military veteran 
and familiar with weapons of war. I 
have never seen rescue vehicles, tents, 
generators, or air conditioners used or 
referred to as weapons of war. 
Our law enforcement agencies use the 
1033 program to acquire equipment 
that protects our officers and serves 
our communities. 
This amendment is another ridicu-
lous amendment to defund and under-
mine the men and women who protect 
us and put their lives on the line. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendment. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, rather than defund police, this 
amendment restores civilian authority 
over law enforcement. 
And I will submit to you that a small 
law enforcement agency doesn’t need a 
military-grade tank to rescue stranded 
individuals due to a hurricane or some-
thing like that, some kind of a natural 
disaster. You don’t need a military 
tank to do that. 
And no law enforcement agency 
should be able to order that equipment 
directly from the battlefield without 
the consent of the governed. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD), my 
good friend and a former sheriff. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my good friend from Alabama 
for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this amendment, which would unneces-
sarily restrict the Department of De-
fense from transferring surplus equip-
ment to local, State, and Federal law 
enforcement agencies. 
We all remember the tragic Pulse 
nightclub shooting in my home State 
of Florida. 
During their response, law enforce-
ment officers set off a controlled explo-
sion to distract the shooter and used an 
armored vehicle to breach the walls of 
the nightclub to gain entry. 
One of the entry officers was literally 
shot in the head, but his life was saved 
by his antiballistic helmet. Now, I be-
lieve had the gentleman across the 
aisle been an entry officer that night, 
he might have a different opinion on 
the equipment that is necessary at 
those scenes. 
Under this amendment, those officers 
would not have had the explosives, the 
armored vehicle, or the antiballistic 
helmet to save their lives and many 
more lives that night. 
This program works to get our law 
enforcement officers what they need to 
protect themselves and to protect our 
communities. I always promised my 
community that our law enforcement 
officers would be men and women of 
character, well equipped, properly de-
ployed, and skillfully managed. The 
1033 program helps achieve that goal 
with significant reductions of cost to 
hardworking taxpayers. We must not 
take that away. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, a large metropolitan law enforce-
ment agency with the consent of the 
governed has the ability to purchase 
whatever equipment they need, but the 
bottom line is the civilian authorities 
get to decide, and the taxpayers pay for 
it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4947 
September 22, 2021 
But there should not be a supply line 
directly from the battlefield to a local 
law enforcement agency without con-
sent of the governed and with the gov-
erned having to bear the cost of unnec-
essary equipment, as well as its misuse 
that contributes to the decline and 
confidence in law enforcement. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. NEHLS), another out-
standing freshman. 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition 
to 
this 
amendment. 
If 
passed, this amendment would greatly 
restrict law enforcement officer agen-
cies throughout the country from ob-
taining 
lifesaving 
surplus 
military 
equipment like the OH–58 helicopter, 
and utility trucks, like the Humvee. 
When I was sheriff of Fort Bend 
County, Texas, if I had to comply with 
this amendment, it would have limited 
my ability to save lives. 
The 1033 program allowed me to ob-
tain two surplus Army OH–58 heli-
copters saving county taxpayers thou-
sands of dollars. They were free. Addi-
tionally, the program provided replace-
ment parts to keep them flying at no 
cost. 
After taking possession, we equipped 
them with lifesaving equipment and 
painted them with our department col-
ors so everyone could see who was fly-
ing the helicopter. 
The idea of saying we are milita-
rizing our police departments, this is 
what the OH–58 looked like. This is me 
in Kentucky picking it up. Six weeks 
later, this is what they looked like. 
Does that look like a military heli-
copter? Absolutely not. So that argu-
ment holds no water. 
In addition, county, city councils, 
and commissioners court must approve 
that equipment. It is not a rogue police 
chief; you must approve the equipment. 
On several occasions, my department 
responded to silver alerts where senior 
adults were missing and couldn’t be 
found. We deployed our helicopters to 
help search for them, and we were suc-
cessful in many cases. And sadly, sir, 
some we were too late. 
During Hurricane Harvey and other 
events, we used Humvees received out 
of Fort Hood to rescue hundreds of 
families stranded in high water. The 
typical 
law 
enforcement 
vehicle 
doesn’t have the ability to forge 
through 
this 
high 
water 
where 
Humvees can, even up to 5 feet, and I 
have the pictures to prove it. 
If the amendment passes, folks, you 
will be restricting law enforcement 
agencies from receiving this lifesaving 
equipment. I know the benefits of the 
program, because I participated in it. 
It works, and I respectfully ask Mem-
bers to reject this amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman from Alabama 
(Mr. ROGERS) has expired. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, a pig with lipstick is still a pig, and 
a military-grade helicopter secured 
from the battlefields of Afghanistan is 
still a military-grade helicopter being 
used against the citizens. 
Now, if the gentleman’s jurisdiction, 
the city council or the county commis-
sioner agreed to purchase and voted on 
that, agreed to accept the material, 
then that is good, but that is not re-
quired under the 1033 program, which 
allows law enforcement agencies to pe-
tition directly to the Department of 
Defense and get this equipment like 
those helicopters without the consent 
of the governed. And that is wrong. 
Over the last several decades, the 
1033 program has transferred more than 
$7.4 billion in surplus military equip-
ment to over 8,000 Federal, Tribal, 
State, and local law enforcement agen-
cies across the country. 
When I first introduced this language 
in 2014, I have heard every single ex-
cuse why we should not do something 
about this program, but it needs to 
end. The militarization of our police 
departments needs to end so that we 
can begin the process of restoring con-
fidence in law enforcement. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. JOHNSON). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 38 OFFERED BY MR. GARAMENDI 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 38 
printed in part C of House Report 117– 
125. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end of title XVI the following 
new subtitle: 
Subtitle F—Ballistic Missiles 
SEC. 1661. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) According to the Congressional Budget 
Office, the projected cost to sustain and 
modernize the United States nuclear arsenal, 
as of 2017, ‘‘is $1.2 trillion in 2017 dollars over 
the 2017–2046 period: more than $800 billion to 
operate and sustain (that is, incrementally 
upgrade) nuclear forces and about $400 bil-
lion to modernize them’’. With inflation, the 
cost rises to $1,700,000,000,000 and does not in-
clude the cost of the additional nuclear capa-
bilities proposed in the 2018 Nuclear Posture 
Review. 
(2) The Government Accountability Office 
found in July 2020 that the Department of 
Defense and the National Nuclear Security 
Administration have still not taken mean-
ingful steps to address affordability concerns 
or heeded the Government Accountability 
Office’s recommendation to consider ‘‘defer-
ring the start of or cancelling specific mod-
ernization programs’’, including the W87–1 
warhead modification program, to address 
increases in the weapons activities budget 
requests of the National Nuclear Security 
Administration. 
(3) The ground-based strategic deterrent 
program 
is 
expected 
to 
cost 
between 
$93,100,000,000 and $95,800,000,000 which does 
not include the cost of the W87–1 warhead 
modification program or the cost to produce 
new plutonium pits for the warhead. The 
total estimated life cycle cost of the ground 
based 
strategic 
deterrent 
program 
is 
$264,000,000,000, and the program is intended 
to replace 400 deployed Minuteman III mis-
siles with more than 600 new missiles, to 
allow for test flights and spares. 
(4) The Air Force awarded a sole-source 
contract to Northrop Grumman for the engi-
neering and manufacturing component of the 
ground-based strategic deterrent program in 
September 2020, raising concerns that the ab-
sence of competition for the award may re-
sult in higher than projected costs to United 
States taxpayers. 
(5) The National Nuclear Security Admin-
istration is also in the early stages of devel-
oping a replacement intercontinental bal-
listic missile warhead, the W87–1, and ex-
panding plutonium pit production to build 
new 
warhead 
cores, 
costing 
at 
least 
$12,000,000,000 and $9,000,000,000, respectively, 
to meet the modernization needs of the 
ground-based strategic deterrent program. 
(6) Maintaining and updating the current 
Minuteman III missiles is possible for mul-
tiple decades and, according to the Congres-
sional Budget Office, through 2036 this would 
cost $37,000,000,000 less in 2017 dollars than 
developing and deploying the ground-based 
strategic deterrent program. 
(7) On April 3, 2019, Lieutenant General 
Richard M. Clark, then-Air Force Deputy 
Chief of Staff for Strategic Deterrence and 
Nuclear Integration, noted in testimony be-
fore the Committee on Armed Services of the 
House of Representatives that we have ‘‘one 
more opportunity’’ to conduct life extension 
on the Minuteman III intercontinental bal-
listic missile, indicating the technical feasi-
bility of extending the Minuteman III mis-
sile despite his stated preference for the 
ground-based strategic deterrent. 
(8) Even in the absence of an interconti-
nental ballistic missile leg of the triad, the 
2018 Nuclear Posture Review signaled that 
the United States would have an assured re-
taliatory capability in the form of ballistic 
missile submarines, which are, ‘‘at present, 
virtually undetectable, and there are no 
known, near-term credible threats to the 
survivability of the [ballistic missile sub-
marine] force’’, a benefit that will be en-
hanced as the Department of Defense moves 
to replace the Ohio class ballistic submarine 
fleet with the new Columbia class ballistic 
missile fleet. 
(9) While intercontinental ballistic mis-
siles had historically been the most respon-
sive leg of the United States nuclear triad, 
advances in ballistic missile submarine com-
munications now provide immediate dissemi-
nation of information during wartime. 
(10) Intercontinental ballistic missiles can-
not be recalled, leaving decision-makers 
with mere minutes to decide whether to 
launch the missiles before they are de-
stroyed, known as a posture of ‘‘launch on 
warning’’ or ‘‘launch under attack’’ in the 
face of a perceived nuclear attack, greatly 
increasing the risk of a national leader initi-
ating a nuclear war by mistake.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4948 
September 22, 2021 
(11) In 1983, Stanislav Petrov, a former 
lieutenant colonel of the Soviet Air Defense 
Forces correctly identified a false warning in 
an early warning system that showed several 
United States incoming nuclear missiles, 
preventing Soviet leaders from launching a 
retaliatory response, earning Colonel Petrov 
the nickname ‘‘the man who saved the 
world’’. 
(12) Former Secretary of Defense William 
Perry, who once briefed President Bill Clin-
ton on a suspected Russian first nuclear 
strike, wrote that the ground-based leg of 
the nuclear triad is ‘‘destabilizing because it 
invites an attack’’ and intercontinental bal-
listic missiles are ‘‘some of the most dan-
gerous weapons in the world’’ and ‘‘could 
even trigger an accidental nuclear war’’. 
(13) General James Cartwright, former vice 
chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former 
Commander of the United States Strategic 
Command, wrote, with Secretary Perry, 
‘‘[T]he greatest danger is not a Russian bolt 
but a US blunder—that we might acciden-
tally stumble into nuclear war. As we make 
decisions about which weapons to buy, we 
should use this simple rule: If a nuclear 
weapon increases the risk of accidental war 
and is not needed to deter an intentional at-
tack, we should not build it. . . . Certain nu-
clear weapons, such as...the [interconti-
nental ballistic missile], carry higher risks 
of accidental war that, fortunately, we no 
longer need to bear. We are safer without 
these expensive weapons, and it would be 
foolish to replace them.’’. 
(14) General George Lee Butler, the former 
Commander-in-Chief of the Strategic Air 
Command and subsequently Commander-in- 
Chief of the United States Strategic Com-
mand, said, ‘‘I would have removed land- 
based missiles from our arsenal a long time 
ago. I’d be happy to put that mission on the 
submarines. So, with a significant fraction of 
bombers having a nuclear weapons capability 
that can be restored to alert very quickly, 
and with even a small component of Trident 
submarines—with all those missiles and all 
those warheads on patrol—it’s hard to imag-
ine we couldn’t get by.’’. 
(15) While a sudden ‘‘bolt from the blue’’ 
first strike from a near-peer nuclear adver-
sary is a highly unlikely scenario, extending 
the Minuteman III would maintain the pur-
ported role of the intercontinental ballistic 
missile leg of the triad to absorb such an at-
tack. 
SEC. 1662. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON SERVICE 
LIFE 
OF 
MINUTEMAN 
III 
INTER-
CONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES 
AND PAUSE IN DEVELOPMENT OF 
GROUND-BASED STRATEGIC DETER-
RENT PROGRAM. 
It is the policy of the United States that— 
(1) the operational life of the Minuteman 
III intercontinental ballistic missiles shall 
be safely extended until at least 2040; and 
(2) the research, development, testing, and 
evaluation of the ground-based strategic de-
terrent program shall be paused until 2031. 
SEC. 1663. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR 
GROUND BASED STRATEGIC DETER-
RENT PROGRAM AND W87–1 WAR-
HEAD MODIFICATION PROGRAM. 
None of the funds authorized to be appro-
priated by this Act or otherwise made avail-
able for fiscal year 2022 for the Department 
or Defense or the National Nuclear Security 
Administration may be obligated or ex-
pended for the ground-based strategic deter-
rent program (including with respect to sup-
porting infrastructure) or the W87–1 warhead 
modification program. 
SEC. 1664. LIFE EXTENSION OF MINUTEMAN III 
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MIS-
SILES. 
(a) LIFE EXTENSION PROGRAM.—Beginning 
not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of De-
fense shall commence efforts for a life exten-
sion program of Minuteman III interconti-
nental ballistic missiles to extend the life of 
such missiles to 2040. 
(b) ELEMENTS
OF PROGRAM.—In carrying 
out the life extension program under sub-
section (a), the Secretary shall ensure the 
following: 
(1) The program will incorporate new and 
necessary technologies that could also be in-
corporated in the future ground-based stra-
tegic deterrent program, including with re-
spect to technologies that— 
(A) increase the resilience against adver-
sary missile defenses; and 
(B) incorporate new nuclear command, 
control, and communications systems. 
(2) The program will use nondestructive 
testing methods and technologies similar to 
the testing methods used by the Navy for 
Trident II D5 submarine launched ballistic 
missiles to reduce destructive testing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
GARAMENDI) and a Member opposed 
each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, the 
United States, Russia, and China are 
aggressively engaged in a new nuclear 
arms race. The rapid development by 
all three nations of new bombs, new 
stealth delivery systems, and near 
total reliance on space for observation 
and communications makes this new 
nuclear arms race far more dangerous 
than the previous arms race. 
Therefore, in an effort to slow the 
pace and to create time for arms con-
trol negotiations to move forward, I 
rise to offer an amendment to the fis-
cal year 2022 National Defense Author-
ization Act that pauses the develop-
ment and prohibits the funding for the 
Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, the 
GBSD, program and the associated 
W87–1 nuclear warhead for the fiscal 
year 2022. 
This amendment also extends the 
service life of the Minuteman III Inter-
continental Ballistic Missile, which is 
in place today, the current missile sys-
tem that the GBSD is slated to replace, 
until at least 2040. 
My amendment also requires the use 
of nondestructive testing methods and 
technologies similar to those used by 
the Navy for the Trident II D5 sub-
marine-launched ballistic missiles. 
There has been much debate over the 
ground-based leg of the nuclear triad 
recently. I have frequently argued for a 
longer pause for the GBSD program to 
help defer the cost of over $240 billion 
that will occur in the next 20 years for 
not only this, but the remaining nu-
clear enterprise monitorization initia-
tives and to slow the pace of the ongo-
ing arms race with Russia and China. 
However, this amendment does not 
seek to permanently resolve the ques-
tion of the future of the land-based bal-
listic missile systems. While that de-
bate is of utmost importance, my 
amendment only seeks a 1-year pause 
in the funding. 
Why a 1-year pause? The answer is 
because a short pause is practical and 
prudent, given the Biden administra-
tion is currently undertaking a new 
nuclear posture review, which is ex-
pected to be completed in the early cal-
endar year of 2022. 
b 1630 
The NPR will establish the future 
role of the nuclear arsenal. Further de-
velopment of the GBSD, therefore, can 
occur after that time period. 
Now, before we spend billions of dol-
lars in fiscal year 2022 on the GBSD 
and the W87–1 warhead, and over $276 
billion when accounting for the total 
lifecycle cost on a nuclear missile sys-
tem that is not yet needed, we should 
wait until the President completes the 
NPR so that we have a complete pic-
ture of the overall requirements. 
This pause will have absolutely no 
impact on our deterrence capability, 
now or in the near future. We know 
that the Minuteman III ICBMs can be 
safely life-extended until at least 2040. 
We know that because that is exactly 
what the Air Force intends to do with 
more than half of that arsenal. The 
U.S., Russia, and China, as they rush to 
modernize their nuclear arsenals, the 
tripwire is becoming more taut each 
and every day. 
Observation and communication sat-
ellites and systems are increasingly 
vulnerable to attacks. All three coun-
tries 
are 
fielding 
stealth 
and 
hypersonic nuclear delivery systems 
designed to evade detection. The risks 
of a false alarm or a political mis-
calculation 
has 
always—always— 
haunted the nuclear landscape, and 
they do even more today. 
While we must recognize the need to 
preserve a safe, secure, and effective 
deterrent as long as nuclear weapon 
systems exist, some aspects of the cur-
rent modernization programs are sim-
ply not required. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend, Mr. GARAMENDI, for 
bringing this forward. I do mean that 
‘‘thank you’’ sincerely because he gives 
us an opportunity to highlight that 
this provision that he seeks to undo 
has strong bipartisan support. 
Representative GARAMENDI, although 
being my good friend, is in the minor-
ity of the minority. He gives us an op-
portunity to highlight that, in fact, his 
amendment would remove funding that 
is requested by President Joe Biden. It 
is of a program that was initiated by 
the Obama administration. These plans 
have been validated by three Presi-
dential administrations—Democrat and 
Republican—six Congresses, and six 
Secretaries of Defense, and a bipartisan 
majority in Congress has voted repeat-
edly in support of this program. The 
same holds true for the warhead, which 
will eventually go on top of the mis-
sile. Both Democrat and Republican

Presidents support this system as it 
will replace the oldest warhead in the 
U.S. arsenal. This will increase our 
safety and security. 
We have been told by Secretary Aus-
tin that to try to extend—if it could— 
the Minuteman III, it would take $38 
billion more. We would have less capa-
bility. And earlier this year, we even 
had a failure of a Minuteman III ICBM 
test. This cannot be accomplished, and 
it has bipartisan support to move for-
ward. This is about safety and security 
of our nuclear deterrent and our Na-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
GARAMENDI. 
Oh, 
my 
good 
friend from Ohio, how often have I 
heard you say that President Biden has 
been wrong so many times over the 
last 6 months. And, indeed, he is wrong 
in this respect, also. So let’s agree on 
that. 
The fact of the matter is the exten-
sion of the Minuteman III for the next 
15 to 20 years is not more expensive 
than the GBSD. In fact, the GBSD cost 
estimates compared to the Minuteman 
III are based on a 50-year period of time 
until 2075. 
Oh my goodness. When did we last 
take up that period of time in any of 
our cost calculations here? We don’t. It 
is simply a false way of addressing the 
cost differential. 
It is, in fact, cheaper in the next 15 to 
20 years to do a life cycle extension 
when necessary on the Minuteman III 
missiles, and it is entirely feasible to 
do so, as said by the military them-
selves. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California’s time has ex-
pired. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. BACON). 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I stand in 
strong opposition to this amendment 
and the extreme damage it would do to 
our national security. 
This amendment is misguided based 
on the rapid changes in the global 
threat environment. It is well-estab-
lished that Russia has modernized its 
entire nuclear arsenal. Meanwhile, we 
are still debating it, and we have a 50- 
year-old ICBM. Even more concerning 
is that we have recently learned that 
China has embarked on a crash nuclear 
buildup program, the pace of which has 
stunned observers around the world. 
Open-source reporting has recently 
confirmed three new Chinese ICBM 
fields with over 100 silos each. When 
armed, these silos, along with China’s 
road-mobile ICBMs model, will match 
our ICBM inventory, and they will be 
new. China is now on pace to quadruple 
its nuclear stockpile as it sprints to 
achieve parity with the United States 
and Russia. 
For the first time in our history, the 
United States confronts not one but 
two peer nuclear-armed competitors 
who do not share our values. 
Make no mistake, our friends and al-
lies are watching this vote. Further de-
laying modernizing our land-based leg 
of the triad while China and Russia 
modernize theirs will have the disas-
trous effect of encouraging allies to de-
velop their own nuclear capabilities or, 
worse, submit to coercion from China 
and Russia. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
oppose this amendment. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has the only time re-
maining. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 21⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank my friend from California for 
the debate as well. 
Mr. Speaker, we debate this often. 
We have made our points. We have 
done this in committee for several 
months. I want to highlight a couple of 
things here of what I believe is misin-
formation about this program, specifi-
cally related to the cost and effective-
ness of the current Minuteman III. 
The amendment sponsors will claim 
that the Congressional Budget Office 
has concluded that Minuteman III life 
extension will cost $37 billion less than 
GBSD. The Office of the Secretary of 
Defense and the U.S. Air Force have 
come to a different conclusion. 
I recall conversations in a committee 
hearing with Secretary Roth, an ap-
pointment of President Biden, talking 
about when you look at the overall 
benefit of GBSD, if we continue to try 
to fix our old carburetor or my old fur-
nace, it is not going to be more effec-
tive for what the long-term gain is. 
The Democrat sponsors will claim 
that the Air Force has stated that they 
can extend the Minuteman III. Admiral 
Richard told us that a life extension is 
not possible. We simply don’t have the 
parts. We have the engineers at Hill 
Air Force Base that are looking on 
eBay, trying to get actual parts for 
this. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not possible. It is 
time to modernize. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. JACKSON). 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this amendment, as it cuts funding for 
the W87–1 warhead, which will be as-
sembled at the Pantex Plant in Ama-
rillo, Texas. 
These are funds that have been men-
tioned or requested by President Biden 
and are broadly supported across all of 
Congress. Cutting funding for the W87– 
1 would be irresponsible and unsafe, as 
it is slated to replace the W78, which 
will soon be the oldest weapon in the 
stockpile. 
This program was started by Obama, 
continued by Trump, and is now being 
funded by Biden. It has been a great 
success as it has hit all of its markers 
and is on track to reach IOC and de-
liver the first unit in 2030. 
Further, plutonium pits for the W87– 
1 will eventually be produced at the 
Los Alamos National Lab and Savan-
nah River Site, giving us a production 
capability that we do not currently 
have. 
For these reasons and the others 
mentioned by my colleagues, I urge ev-
eryone to oppose this far-left attempt 
to 
unilaterally 
disarm 
the 
United 
States. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, Rep-
resentative GARAMENDI is correct. Rus-
sia and China are in an arms race; we 
are not merely modernizing our forces. 
It is sad that we are here trying to de-
fend against an amendment that will 
weaken our national defense just as 
yesterday the majority cut a billion 
dollars from the defense of Israel in its 
Iron Dome, which will only make it 
more likely that there is conflict. 
Cutting our nuclear deterrent also 
just increases the likelihood that there 
would be conflict. This is about making 
certain our country remains safe. This 
is about our national security. Every-
one should vote ‘‘no’’ on this amend-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposi-
tion to amendment No. 38, offered by my col-
league Rep. GARAMENDI. The sponsors of this 
amendment would have you believe that this 
amendment is an attempt to save money and 
that life extending the Minuteman III ICBM is 
a cost saver. This is simply untrue. The House 
Armed Services Committee has heard witness 
after witness testify that any Minuteman Ill life 
extension will cost billions more than GBSD. 
We’ve 
heard 
from 
Admiral 
Richard 
of 
STRATCOM, General Hyten, and General 
Milley that the current ICBM can no longer be 
credibly or affordably sustained—and even if it 
could, it would not meet deterrence require-
ments of the future. According to Secretary 
Austin, even if the Minuteman III could be life 
extended, which is increasingly difficult as an-
tiquated parts fall out of production, such an 
effort would be at least $38 billion more ex-
pensive than GBSD. For the MM III to be use-
fully life extended, the United States would 
need to replace a number of major missile 
components—which, even if accomplished at 
cost and on time, would still fall short of the 
Department of Defense’s requirements—in-
cluding accommodating modern safety and se-
curity features and defeating the emerging 
anti-missile technologies of our adversaries. 
GBSD will incorporate low risk, technically ma-
ture components; feature a modular architec-
ture that can incorporate emerging technology 
to adapt to rapidly evolving threat environ-
ments; and will be easier to maintain than the 
MM III—all of which will save on costs and 
provide great value as GBSD operates well 
into the 2070s. Finally, the GBSD program will 
not only replace the MM III missile, but also 
modernize the launch facilities, improve com-
mand and control, and increase safety and se-
curity. While our adversaries are modernizing

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to offer an amendment to this 
year’s National Defense Authorization 
Act to help rein in a practice that has 
existed from the 1990s known as the un-
funded priorities list or unfunded re-
quirements list. 
The practice originally had good in-
tent, to allow some flexibility for the 
Armed Services for issues that came up 
outside of the normal appropriations 
process, but it has grown to become 
embedded to encompass larger areas in 
the Pentagon budget that were never 
considered to be part of that mandate 
at the time. 
Mr. Speaker, we are getting out of 
Afghanistan. We have decided that we 
are not going to be pursuing every war 
overseas, trying to protect American 
servicemen and -women. Our budget 
should reflect that. 
We have tried to be honest in our 
budget this year. The overseas contin-
gency budget has been eliminated. 
Let’s be honest in our budget request. 
We go through an extensive process, 
both in the authorizing committee of 
the Armed Services and in our Com-
mittee on Appropriations, to make 
sure that the budget requests are rea-
sonable and reflect the interests of the 
American people and the congressional 
districts that we represent. 
Let’s be honest here. The budget has 
changed. It is time to rein in some of 
the spending. The Defense Department 
has showcased $125 billion in waste and 
inefficiencies within its own budget. It 
is time to rein that in. The unfunded 
requirement list, the unfunded prior-
ities list, is part of that. 
My amendment does not eliminate it. 
I want to repeat that. It does not elimi-
nate it. It just restricts its use back to 
the services and SOCOM, like it was 
originally intended. It still gives the 
Pentagon the ability to showcase addi-
tional needs not included in the main 
budget request, but it eliminates that 
budgetary creep that we have seen over 
the past several years. 
Mr. Speaker, this issue crosses party 
lines. Former Senate Armed Services 
Committee Chairman John McCain 
said, ‘‘I am not really big on unfunded 
priority lists. I think they are sort of a 
backdoor way of getting things done.’’ 
We have actually seen what happens 
when the Pentagon stops this from 
happening. With Roberts Gates as Sec-
retary, we cut down on the use of these 
UPLs drastically during his tenure, 
and the DOD budget continued to oper-
ate just fine. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in strong opposition to this 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I want people to understand what 
the gentleman is proposing because it 
is naive and reckless. 
When we get the budget proposal 
from the administration, it is just 
that. It is a proposal. But it is also 
from the executive branch. It is not 
coming directly from the combatant 
commanders, who are the individuals 
that we charge with the responsibility 
for executing the U.S. missions around 
the world. 
This 
amendment 
would 
prohibit 
them giving us the items that were not 
funded by the President’s budget pro-
posal. Keep in mind, both this Presi-
dent and the last President have given 
us budget proposals that were grossly 
inadequate. We were able to remedy it 
under the last President; we were able 
to remedy it in this one with this 
President. And we depend heavily on 
what the combatant commanders tell 
us they need. 
It is critical that Congress knows 
what the commanders need to keep our 
servicemembers safe and ensure the 
success of their missions. 
Here is an example. In the fiscal year 
2022 unfunded priority, the CENTCOM 
commander sent us a $106 million re-
quest to operate and maintain the Pa-
triot batteries deployed in Iraq to keep 
our troops safe from missiles fired from 
Iran and the proxies in Syria. 
That money was not in the Biden 
budget. We found out about it and 
funded it because of that critical need, 
and it is now in the bill because Gen-
eral McKenzie told us about it in his 
unfunded 
requirement 
list. 
We 
wouldn’t have known about that other-
wise. That is just one example of why 
this amendment is misguided. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
oppose it, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1645 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I 
think the good gentleman on the other 
side of the aisle is confused. We are not 
talking about restricting the appro-
priations process or the Armed Serv-
ices Committee from making the deci-
sions and the priorities based on what 
is submitted by the Defense Depart-
ment agencies, as well as congressional 
districts themselves. 
This merely just says, if we abide by 
some of the decisions, we should abide 
by the decisions that are made by the 
Appropriations Committee, as the good 
gentleman points out. Actually, abide 
by the decisions that are made by the 
appropriators, based on their input, the 
intel that was just described. 
We are talking about the unfunded 
priorities list, which is basically a 
slush fund for mission creep that we no 
longer need. We have to respect the 
will of the people, the congressional 
districts that we represent, and should 
abide by their wishes in our budgetary 
allocations. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I know the gentleman means well, 
but I am not misguided, and I don’t 
misunderstand anything. 
I know exactly what the unfunded re-
quirements request list is, it is a vital 
piece of information for our committee 
to do its oversight, and I urge the 
Members of this body to reject this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I 
would just point out, as Chairman

SMITH said in last year’s NDAA, some 
people believe that no matter what you 
spend on the Pentagon and defense 
spending, you should always spend 
more. And they are trying to push us 
down that road towards more, which is 
wrong, because it is waste. 
It is also wrong because it is bad for 
national security. We need to make 
choices, not imagine that the budget is 
unlimited. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this is a terrible and reckless 
amendment, and I urge all the Mem-
bers of this body to reject it, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, very 
simply put, my colleagues and friends, 
if the priorities did not make it into 
the largest piece of the discretionary 
budget that we vote on, how big a pri-
ority can it really be? Let’s restrict, 
but not eliminate, the unfunded prior-
ities list. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

AMENDMENT NO. 40 OFFERED BY MS. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 40 
printed in part C of House Report 117– 
125. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise to offer amendment 40, as 
the designee of Congressman MARK 
POCAN, to reduce the Pentagon budget 
by 10 percent. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of subtitle A of title X, insert 
the following: 
SEC. 10ll. REDUCTION IN AMOUNT AUTHOR-
IZED TO BE APPROPRIATED FOR FIS-
CAL YEAR 2022 BY THIS ACT. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The amount authorized 
to be appropriated for fiscal year 2022 by this 
Act is the aggregate amount authorized to 
be appropriated for fiscal year 2022 by this 
Act minus the amount equal to 10 percent of 
the aggregate amount. 
(b) ALLOCATION.—The reduction made by 
subsection (a) shall apply on a pro rata basis 
among the accounts and funds for which 
amounts are authorized to be appropriated 
by this Act (other than the Defense Health 
Program, military personnel, and persons ap-
pointed into the civil service as defined in 
section 2101 of title 5, United States Code), 
and shall be applied on a pro rata basis 
across each program, project, and activity 
funded by the account or fund concerned. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to offer amendment 40, to re-
duce the Pentagon budget by 10 per-
cent. 
During a time when our country is 
withdrawing from foreign wars, when 
COVID–19 and its fallout is one of the 
greatest threats that we face, when 
record levels of unemployment, hous-
ing, and healthcare crises are among 
us, the United States should be reduc-
ing its military spending by at least 10 
percent and prioritize the very needs of 
our communities here at home. 
Today, we can cut the defense au-
thorization by 10 percent, without any 
need to deny our servicemembers or 
their families any of the support that 
they need. And in doing so, we can free 
up to $77 billion to go towards fighting 
the COVID–19 pandemic and much 
more. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment will strip $79 bil-
lion out of the bill. That would have 
catastrophic effects on our training 
and readiness. 
I need to remind Members, we have 
been at war for two decades, we have 
worn out everything we have got. We 
have got to start replacing and mod-
ernizing for the future to be able to 
take on the threats from China and 
other adversaries. This will set us back 
on clean-up and environmental remedi-
ation of PFAS and other contaminated 
items. 
It would put off construction of new 
military 
housing, 
schools, 
and 
childcare facilities, and the list goes 
on. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
oppose this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, 
there was a point brought up that this 
could potentially threaten our readi-
ness, and I would counter that it is not 
the readiness that cutting our defense 
budget threatens, it is the profit mar-
gins of defense contractors. 
In fact, almost every major defense 
contractor here in the United States 
has had to pay fines or settlements for 
fraud or misconduct, all while getting 
about $1 trillion in public funding in 
defense contracts. I have seen this per-
sonally in my work on the Oversight 
and Reform Committee, where we have 
encountered 
contractor 
after 
con-
tractor gouging the public and draining 
our resources. 
In fact, the $77 billion is not even 
that hard to find. The Pentagon could 
save almost $58 billion by eliminating 
obsolete weapons, weapons like Cold 
War era bombers and missiles designed 
and built in the last century that are 
completely unsuitable for this one. 
We could find another $18 billion by 
simply 
preventing 
the 
end-of-year 
spending sprees that lead to contract 
money being shoveled out the door 
every September. In fact, the Congres-
sional Research Service has docu-
mented these spending spikes, and you 
could set your watch to it. 
Each September, as offices at the 
Pentagon go on last minute spending 
sprees to justify next year’s budget in-
creases, we have increased our military 
spending year after year, senselessly 
and needlessly. And now, again, during 
a time when we have ended an almost 
two decade war, there is no reason for 
us to be increasing our military spend-
ing and our defense budget when we are 
not 
funding 
childcare, 
healthcare, 
housing priorities, and the climate cri-
sis here at home. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this bill does everything the gentle-
woman just talked about. We are in-
vesting in those items that she has 
talked about, and we are divesting our-
selves of those $78 billion worth of leg-
acy platforms that will not be useful in 
the future, and we are applying that 
money toward future platforms. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
gentleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
DESJARLAIS), my friend and colleague, 
and an outstanding member of the 
Armed Services Committee. 
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to the 
Pocan amendment. A 10 percent cut to 
this budget will leave America vulner-
able to our adversaries. 
The United States is facing daily 
threats from China, Iran, Russia, North 
Korea, and a whole host of other bad 
actors. We must fully fund our military 
so the U.S. has every capability nec-
essary to deter those who wish to do us 
harm. 
The fiscal year 2022 National Defense 
Authorization Act has bipartisan sup-
port from the House Armed Services 
Committee already. With the approved 
budget on the floor today being $23.9 
billion more than the bare-bones budg-
et that originally came through. There 
is a reason why the improved budget 
was approved in a bipartisan vote of 
the committee by an overwhelming 57– 
2 margin. 
Modernization is an important part 
of our military strategy. Our military 
leaders have spent the past year sound-
ing the alarm and testimony before 
Congress that our top competitors, 
Russia and China, are working at a 
startling pace to close the gap between 
themselves and the U.S. in areas like

nuclear modernization. In other areas, 
like hypersonic capabilities, they may 
have already surpassed us. 
This budget is absolutely necessary 
in order to maintain advantages over 
our enemies as technology continues to 
evolve and change rapidly. Now is not 
the time to recklessly cut what we 
must spend to protect our country and 
provide for our men and women in uni-
form. 
We must ensure our brave men and 
women in the armed services have 
every resource necessary to keep the 
American people safe. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, 
the Pentagon is the only Federal de-
partment that has never passed an 
audit, despite this requirement being 
on the books for over 30 years. You 
know there are folks who are sup-
portive of the current levels, the in-
crease and skyrocketing levels of de-
fense spending, saying, we are already 
meeting all of our needs with this. 
I don’t think a single American, I 
don’t know a single member of my dis-
trict that can say that our childcare 
needs are being met in this country, 
that our healthcare needs are being 
met, that our climate action that is 
necessary is being met. Our needs are 
not being met. 
And despite all of this rhetoric about 
the deficit and all this fear about gov-
ernment spending, for some reason, our 
defense budget seems to be exempt 
from this conversation, and that we 
ask Americans and people in this coun-
try year after year to engage in the 
magical thinking that defense spending 
comes at no real cost. It does. 
It comes at the cost of our security, 
because when we do not have and we 
are not able to go to school, to go to 
work and count on childcare for our 
children, it makes us less safe. When 
we are not able go to an emergency 
room and have our healthcare covered, 
we are less safe. 
The degradation and erosion of our 
social systems here domestically is a 
threat as well. And that is happening 
because of our explosion in defense 
spending. The explosion in defense 
spending is coming at the cost of our 
domestic development here at home. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I would point out that achieving or 
meeting the objectives that the gentle-
woman just outlined and defense are 
not mutually exclusive, we can do both 
and should do both. 
And I would point out that the $3.5 
trillion that the other side is proposing 
doesn’t spend a dime on defense. Also, 
we are in the process of auditing. The 
gentlewoman is exactly right, the De-
fense Department has never passed an 
audit. This bill continues the pressure 
on them to get that complete. We have 
had many agencies that passed, not all 
have, and we are not going to let up 
until they pass an audit. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
GALLAGHER), the ranking member of 
the Military Personnel Subcommittee 
and the Armed Services Committee, 
and an outstanding leader. 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment, 
which I think would be very destruc-
tive. 
Earlier this year, the former head of 
Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Phil 
Davidson, warned that the Chinese 
Communist Party could make a move 
on Taiwan within the next 6 years. 
Within the next 6 years, we could be 
facing a crisis unlike anything we have 
seen in our lifetime. 
This assessment was concurred by 
the chief of naval operations, the com-
mandant of the Marine Corps. And the 
idea that we are going to do an across 
the board 10 percent cut, an indiscrimi-
nate across the board 10 percent cut to 
the Pentagon, at a time when we are 
facing a serious national crisis, I think, 
makes absolutely no sense. 
The ranking member pointed out the 
irony and tragedy that the other side is 
proposing to spend $3.5 trillion on so-
cial welfare spending, and then telling 
us that we have an explosion in defense 
spending, when defense spending, as a 
percentage of GDP, is still at lows rel-
ative to what we spent during the Cold 
War. 
Does anyone seriously believe that 
by releasing a press release or engaging 
in a security partnership with the 
Taliban we somehow ended a war? Does 
anyone 
seriously 
believe 
that 
the 
struggle against Salafi jihadism is 
somehow over because we have surren-
dered in that struggle? Absolutely not. 
And the reason and the irony that de-
fense spending has gone up, if you can 
even compare the Obama cut in real 
terms to the Reagan defense build-up, 
it is not because of missiles or ships or 
bombs, it is because of increasing per-
sonnel costs, right? It is healthcare and 
retirement costs. 
So as an empirical matter, what you 
are arguing is simply not true. As for 
spending too much money on defense, 
what costs a lot of money is when you 
stumble into war on someone else’s 
terms, and the best way to do that is to 
project weakness. Weakness invites ag-
gression. We can achieve peace only 
through strength. 
b 1700 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
think what we just experienced and 
have seen in our last two-decade war is 
exemplary of the types of waste that 
goes on, where what we see is lack of 
oversight and what we see is runaway 
military contractor spending with lit-
tle oversight in what is going on, and 
then folks are caught surprised in the 
end that all of this investment seems 
to not have panned out and it has not 
been invested in the way that the 
American public was led to believe all 
along. 
Now, not only are they tremendous 
costs that we had laid out earlier, but 
also this explosion in spending leaves 
our public health priorities under-
funded, militarizes every problem in 
our society, and turns peaceful pro-
testers into targets for weapons of war. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, this amendment guts our bill which 
is, I am certain, the gentlewoman’s in-
tention. It is recklessly irresponsible. 
It would harm our servicemembers and 
their families.

Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment offered 
by my friend and colleague, Congress-
woman BARBARA
LEE, restores the 
NDAA to the original funding level re-
quested by the White House, the Pen-
tagon, and the chair of the Armed 
Services Committee. 
Specifically, it would remove the 
Rogers amendment which would in-
crease the pending authorization by 
$23.9 billion. When Mr. ROGERS’ amend-
ment was offered during committee 
markup, I voted against it, and nothing 
over the last few weeks has led me to 
change my mind. 
Mr. Speaker, just 3 weeks ago we 
ended our military operations in Af-
ghanistan—America’s longest war and 
one that started when I was in middle 
school. Yet what some are concluding 
from that is that what we need is more 
war, more weapons, and billions of dol-
lars more than even what the Pentagon 
themselves are asking for. 
So many of my colleagues who sup-
ported Mr. ROGERS’ amendment note 
the emerging threat from China as 
their reason to support this increase, 
even though very little of this increase 
is even relevant to China and most na-
tional security experts agree that mak-
ing needed domestic investments is far 
more important to our competitiveness 
with China. Instead, this inflated budg-
et seeks to sugarcoat that for years we 
have been decreasing investments in 
diplomacy and the support of our serv-
icemembers in favor of purchasing new, 
unproven, and un-needed weapons. 
We need to have an honest conversa-
tion about the Pentagon budget and 
focus on what is achievable, what the 
real threats are, and what we actually 
need for our national security. For the 
last 20 years, we have been told that we 
need more, but I think it is time to rec-
ognize that there are simply not mili-
tary solutions to every problem. 
I thank Congresswoman LEE for of-
fering this amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, here we go again. This 
time they are stripping $25 billion in 
funding added by Republicans and 
Democrats on the committee. 
The gentlewoman argues that the 
Biden budget is sufficient for our na-
tional defense. I strongly disagree. The 
Biden budget constitutes a cut of about 
$4 billion in real spending from last 
year. The budget cuts the number of 
Navy ships. It cuts the number of Navy 
ships and destabilizes the industrial 
base. It slashes procurement across the 
board. It guts missile defense. It leaves 
unfunded $25 billion in combatant com-
mander priorities, and it cuts the 
Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines. 
At least they left the Space Corps 
alone. 
It does all this while our adversaries, 
especially China, are investing in mili-
tary modernization. China increased 
its defense spending by 75 percent over 
the last decade—6 percent this year 
alone. They are leapfrogging this into 
capabilities like AI and hypersonics, 
and they are stepping up malign oper-
ations against America and our allies. 
What is the President’s response to 
this? 
He responds with a budget that would 
cut funding programs that we need to 
deter China. It doesn’t make sense, es-
pecially when he is proposing to swell 
nondefense spending by a massive 16 
percent this year. This bill corrects 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
oppose this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH), 
who is the esteemed chair of the Armed 
Services Committee. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I want to get the 
numbers clear here. The budget pro-
posed by President Biden was $753 bil-
lion, and by supporting this amend-
ment, we support President Biden’s 
budget of $753 billion, which was a $12 
billion increase over last year’s budget. 
Last year’s budget—the last budget 
from the Trump administration—only 
increased the defense budget that year 
by $3 billion. So a $3 billion increase 
last year was perfectly acceptable to 
my Republican colleagues in the House 
and Senate under President Trump. A 
$12 billion increase this year is not. So 
the numbers are just being dramati-
cally presented here as some kind of 
cut when it is actually a bigger in-
crease than Trump did in his last year 
in the White House. 
Let me make it clear: I see the 
threats, and I do agree more with my 
Republican colleagues on that point. I 
don’t support the previous amendment 
that does the $75 billion cut because I 
understand the threat environment and 
I know that we need to modernize to 
meet that threat environment. 
But the other thing I see is decades 
of waste and wasteful expenditures on 
programs like the F–35 and the Ford- 
class carrier. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield the gentleman an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, we spent money in a very im-
prudent way. We have got to instill dis-
cipline at the Pentagon so we get value 
for the dollars that we spend. Simply 
giving them another $25 billion does 
not do that, and $753 billion is enough. 
It is even better if we actually start 
spending it wisely, intelligently, and 
effectively. That doesn’t happen. I am 
a little short. Can you just give me a 
little more money? 
I always love the Winston Churchill 
quote: ‘‘Gentlemen, we have run out of 
money; now we have to think.’’ 
That is the type of discipline we need 
at the Pentagon, not just to give them 
a blank check every time they ask. The 
President’s budget is sufficient to meet 
our needs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the 
amendment. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. WITTMAN), who is a 
real leader on the Armed Services 
Committee and ranking member on the 
Seapower and Projection Forces Sub-
committee. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the Republican leader for yielding. 
Similar to the previous amendment, I 
believe this amendment is extremely 
misguided. In fact, on March 24 of this 
year, I invited both Ms. LEE and Mr. 
POCAN to attend a classified briefing on 
the existential threats we face in great 
power competition. 
Mr. Speaker, instead of taking me up 
on that offer, they continue to turn a 
blind eye. The chairs of the Defense 
Spending Reduction Caucus don’t want 
to learn about what the threats are. 
They don’t want to learn more about 
the critical capabilities that would be 
out of the hands of our warfighters if 
this amendment were to pass. 
I can stand here and tell that caucus 
about how this plus-up has $9.8 billion 
in procurement that is aimed directly 
at deterring China. That means build-
ing additional ships, among other capa-
bilities, to keep up with China. 
Or I can tell them that there is $3 bil-
lion for sustainment operations that 
allow our warfighters to conduct global 
operations, including humanitarian op-
erations in places like Haiti. 
Or I can tell them there is $3.8 billion 
for military construction to improve 
facilities in districts across the coun-
try to make sure our servicemembers 
aren’t working in rundown facilities. 
I can even tell them there is $5.2 bil-
lion for research and development that 
assures our future servicemembers will 
have what they need when called upon 
to do the job or to fight to victory and 
come home safe. 
But I don’t think any of that is going 
to resonate because these progressive 
Members don’t want to learn about the 
existential threats we face. These far- 
left Members just want to play progres-
sive politics, and that means weak-
ening our national security. 
To the rest of my colleagues here 
today, this plus-up is good for national 
security and good for this country. 
Mr. Speaker, you can ask any service 
branch 
chief 
or 
combatant 
com-
mander—because we have asked them— 
and they have told us these are the 
things that they need going forward.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4954 
September 22, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge every-
one to vote against this amendment. 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, may I inquire how much time 
I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 13⁄4 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Alabama has 2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distin-
guished gentlewoman from New York 
(Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ). 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of amendment No. 41 
which would cut $25.5 billion from the 
defense authorization bill. 
There were some accusations just 
now saying that this is about progres-
sive politics. But this bill allocates $25 
billion more than President Biden even 
requested. So what we should be doing 
is sticking to the plan and giving the 
President of the United States what he 
determines is necessary for defense 
spending and not a dime more. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from the great State of Alabama (Mr. 
CARL), who is one of our outstanding 
freshmen on the Armed Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to oppose this amendment. 
There are several different ways to 
look at this amendment. The budget 
that we got from the President was be-
fore our problems in Afghanistan. We 
asked him for $25 billion to replace $80 
to $85 billion we left on the ground for 
the Taliban to fight back at us. So I 
ask that we keep an open mind on re-
placing that equipment, if nothing else. 
It is critical to pass this bill which 
includes a bipartisan increase—I re-
peat, bipartisan. 
How many times do you hear that 
word, Mr. Speaker? 
I have been here for 9 months, and I 
can probably count that on one hand. 
The bill includes a bipartisan in-
crease in spending to counter threats 
and project U.S. strength around the 
world. 
This amendment would limit readi-
ness and the needed capabilities to 
counter these threats. Passage of this 
amendment 
would 
basically 
short-
change our military at a time when 
they need our support more than ever. 
I am proud to have worked on this 
bill with my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to ensure that our military is 
fully funded so our men and women in 
uniform have the resources they need 
to protect and defend the United States 
of America. 
Folks in my district in south Ala-
bama work hard every day to support 
the military readiness of this country. 
Unlike President Biden and his allies 
in Congress, Alabamians understand 
how important it is to fully fund our 
military. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support our Armed Forces and oppose 
this amendment. 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I am prepared to close. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Alabama has the right to 
close. The gentlewoman is recognized. 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I hear my colleagues on the 
other side talk a lot about the needs 
from Afghanistan. What is interesting 
is that in the continuing resolution 
that this body passed just yesterday 
there 
was 
additional 
supplemental 
funding for Afghanistan, and yet my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
decided to vote against it. 
I also hear them talk about the 
threats and the briefings that sup-
posedly we were not in. I sit on both 
the Foreign Affairs and Armed Services 
Committees, I assure you, Mr. Speaker, 
I have been to every single one of those 
classified briefings on the threats. I am 
very aware of the threats. But we need 
to dispel the notion that our ability to 
respond to the threats depends solely 
on the size of our military. 
I am honored to represent San Diego, 
a proud military community. They 
don’t need a larger budget. They need 
one that takes their needs into ac-
count, which means better wages and 
housing free of mold, childcare and job 
opportunities for their spouses, and 
they need a government that goes 
through every diplomatic channel be-
fore making the decision to send them 
to war. 
Earlier this month vice chair of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff General John 
Hyten asked: Do you think any tax-
payer in this country would believe 
that for $700 billion a year we can’t 
have a great defense? 
Hyten said: We should be able to, and 
it is crazy that we can’t. 
He is right. It is crazy, and more of 
us need to be willing to say what ev-
eryone knows is true: we don’t need to 
spend money even the Pentagon them-
selves are not asking for. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
b 1715 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, the underlying bill before this body, 
the FY22 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, would increase spending by 3 
percent over inflation, which is a mod-
est increase. And it passed our com-
mittee with an overwhelming bipar-
tisan vote. 
This amendment guts the bill. I urge 
all Members to oppose it, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. JACOBS). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. JACOBS). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appear to have it. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

ture capital firms that are engaged in the 
military and non-military research, develop-
ment, funding, and production of innovative 
technologies that support the national secu-
rity of the United States. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States at-
tracts and develops some of the bright-
est minds in the world. They can for-
tify national security and boost eco-
nomic competitiveness. Unfortunately, 
much of that talent leaves because 
there are few options to remain. 
My amendment provides a pathway 
to citizenship for the best foreign tal-
ent to work in the U.S. in support of 
our National Security Innovation Base. 
Great power competition is a race for 
talent to maintain our military and 
technological superiority. We want the 
brightest minds in the world working 
for us, not the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
The U.S. has less than 5 percent of 
world’s population, so it is no surprise 
that many great scientific minds are 
born outside U.S. borders. So then how 
have we maintained our technological 
superiority over the last 70 years, by 
way of example? 
Well, our world-class universities and 
innovative private sector attract fu-
ture Nobel laureates in critical tech-
nologies like machine learning and ar-
tificial intelligence. However, our con-
stricted pathways to residency and 
citizenship drive this talent into the 
arms of our adversaries; so we face in-
tense competition from other countries 
who offer large research grants and ex-
pedited citizenship to lure this talent 
away. 
But it is not just potential adver-
saries. Some U.S. companies are set-
ting up R&D facilities in Canada be-
cause their immigration policies more 
effectively attract highly-skilled work-
ers. 
Under this amendment, the Sec-
retary of Defense will implement a 
competitive annual process to select 
scientists with technical expertise in 
critical technologies and recommend 
them for proper processing and vetting. 
It is in our national security interests 
not only to have these scientists work-
ing on research on our behalf, but also 
to prevent this talent from working for 
our adversaries. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Wisconsin is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The ramifications of this amendment 
could be dangerous and far-reaching. 
Quite frankly, we should not be look-
ing outside of the United States for 
such scientists and researchers. We 
should cultivate our own talent. Unfor-
tunately, this bill does nothing to de-
velop that talent. 
We must ask, which foreign nationals 
would be eligible for the program? 
Most likely, those from China. 
China is so intent on using our U.S. 
immigration system to steal our sen-
sitive technologies that the Trump ad-
ministration had to issue a proclama-
tion suspending entry of certain Chi-
nese students and researchers. 
The Trump administration proclama-
tion stated: ‘‘The People’s Republic of 
China is engaged in a wide-ranging and 
heavily resourced campaign to acquire 
sensitive United States technologies 
. . . to bolster the modernization and 
capability of its military.’’ 
The proclamation went on to state 
that ‘‘students or researchers from the 
PRC 
studying 
beyond 
the 
under-
graduate level . . . are at high risk of 
being exploited or co-opted by the 
PRC.’’ 
Because of the brutal nature of the 
Chinese Communist Party, the same is 
true for virtually any Chinese national 
who comes to the United States to 
study or research, or to otherwise work 
in sensitive technologies like those 
contemplated under this amendment. 
In fact, the Department of Homeland 
Security told us last year that the Chi-
nese government requires its nationals 
to ‘‘support, assist, and cooperate with 
State intelligence work.’’ 
The idea for this amendment came, 
at least in part, from the Commission 
on Artificial Intelligence, which called 
for ‘‘increasing China brain drain.’’ So 
clearly, the green cards contemplated 
under this amendment would go to Chi-
nese nationals. 
The last thing we should do is make 
it easy for the Chinese Communist 
Party to gain access to our National 
Security Innovation Base work, De-
partment of Defense research, or other 
critical technologies. 
I would also note that, sadly, the De-
partment of Defense does not have a 
great track record regarding immi-
grant programs. Many of you may re-
member that the Department of De-
fense supported and encouraged the 
Military Accessions Vital to the Na-
tional Interest program through which 
foreign nationals were able to enlist in 
the U.S. military. Once enlisted, they 
were eligible to naturalize. 
The Department of Defense was not 
living up to its promise to adequately 
vet and perform high-level background 
checks on the MAVNI participants. 
The program was halted by the Obama 
administration when it was discovered 
that the Department had allowed some 
Chinese spies to enlist in the military. 
Let that sink in. The Department of 
Defense let Chinese spies enlist in the 
U.S. military. So I am not comfortable 
with several aspects of the program 
created by this amendment. I urge my 
colleagues to oppose the amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Rhode Island has 3 min-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4956 
September 22, 2021 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this amendment that would allow a 
small number of special immigrant 
visas to the world’s top scientists and 
technical experts selected by the Sec-
retary of Defense. I trust the Secretary 
of Defense looking out after the Na-
tion’s security interests, and it is im-
portant that our security depends on 
having access to the top scientists in 
the world who are committed to the 
success of our country. 
We need to take bold action to make 
sure that we educate and train our 
American people to be the best sci-
entists they can be. But that doesn’t 
mean that every smart person who 
loves America was born in America. In 
fact, some of the most patriotic people 
I have ever met were immigrants who 
came here and became Americans by 
choice. 
It is absolutely clear that nations 
that attract and retain highly-skilled 
innovators gain a competitive advan-
tage, and we can help do that for Amer-
ica through this very thoughtful plan. 
For us, the promise of the American 
Dream remains a powerful draw for the 
world’s innovators. 
This amendment would move us in 
the right direction and help ensure 
that America, and not our competitors, 
benefits from the world’s best minds. 
I want to thank Mr. LANGEVIN for 
this smart amendment, and I urge its 
adoption. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, so once 
again, we hear that this will be a small 
number of people that are coming in. 
All we have to do is look at our south-
ern border and other places for hearing 
about how small numbers of people are 
going to come into our country. 
We also hear, trust the Secretary of 
Defense. As I cited in my opening re-
marks, we had a real problem with the 
MAVNI program, where the Obama ad-
ministration discovered Chinese spies 
in our military. This is a serious, seri-
ous situation. 
And here is the thing that I find frus-
trating, Mr. Speaker. We have so many 
people that project our freedoms and 
how we view them on other countries, 
including China, that they treat their 
people the same way. They simply do 
not, and it is fully proven that the Chi-
nese Communist Party demands com-
plete fealty of anyone, whether they 
are in China, or they come to our coun-
try to go back and give all information 
to the Chinese Communist Party. They 
do not protect intellectual property 
rights, which are a foundation of our 
freedoms here in America. We should 
not 
be 
sanguine about what this 
amendment will do. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers so I am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, let me 
just say that when the Secretary of De-
fense deems it vital to the national se-
curity interests of the United States, 
this would give that authority to grant 
this special pathway to the Secretary 
to make that determination. 
A special immigrant visa, by the 
way, to streamline the admission of ap-
plicants in the name of national secu-
rity is not new. My amendment is mod-
eled after a 1949 law granting the Di-
rector of the CIA the authority to ob-
tain permanent residency for anyone 
deemed ‘‘in the interest of national se-
curity or essential to the furtherance 
of national intelligence missions.’’ 
Today, the Secretary of Defense has 
no mechanism for retaining top tech-
nical and scientific talent who are 
vital to national security. 
Unsurprisingly, the Department of 
Defense explicitly endorses the amend-
ment. So, again, my amendment is not 
new or groundbreaking to the immigra-
tion conversation. In fact, again, it 
provides the Secretary of Defense with 
the same authority that the Director 
of the CIA has enjoyed since 1949. 
This authority is not challenged as a 
less strident or reckless method that 
our adversaries exploit because it does 
not circumvent the current immigra-
tion process. All the Secretary of De-
fense innovation referrals are subject 
to the same rigorous and extensive 
background checks that any other ap-
plicant receives. I am confident that 
they will properly vet these applicants 
as we will keep the best talent in the 
world working on our behalf. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this amendment to ensure our contin-
ued military and technological superi-
ority. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the amendment. 
International students and researchers pro-
vide enormous benefits for American competi-
tiveness and prosperity. As of 2018, immi-
grants founded 50 of the 91 privately held bil-
lion-dollar startup tech companies in the 
United States. A quarter of those founders 
came to the U.S. as international students. 
These companies created an average of 1,200 
jobs each, and have a collective value of $250 
billion. International students and researchers 
bring fresh perspectives, diverse experiences, 
expertise, energy, and creativity to the U.S. re-
search enterprise. 
The 
global 
competition 
to 
attract 
top 
science, 
technology, 
engineering, 
mathe-
matics, and medical talent is intensifying. And 
attracting talent is just half the battle. Restric-
tive immigration policies and xenophobic rhet-
oric, restrictions due to the pandemic, and 
concerted efforts by other countries to attract 
talent, have given talented international STEM 
students good reason to consider opportuni-
ties outside of the U.S. We must take bold ac-
tion now to ensure the U.S. can continue to 
attract and retain global STEM talent. 
This amendment creates a new pathway to 
permanent residency for a small number of 
outstanding students and professionals en-
gaged in critical fields that are vital to achiev-
ing the goals of the National Defense Strategy 
and National Defense Science and Tech-
nology Strategy. While modest in scope, the 
amendment would help advance areas of in-
novation that are critical to our national secu-
rity and economic competitiveness. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-

AMENDMENT NO. 105 OFFERED BY MR. BOWMAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 105 
printed in part C of House Report 117– 
125. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise as 
the designee of the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
AMENDMENT NO. 105 OFFERED BY MR. BOWMAN 
OF NEW YORK 
Add at the end of title LX the following: 
SEC. 6lll. CONTRACTS BY THE PRESIDENT, 
THE VICE PRESIDENT, OR A CABI-
NET MEMBER. 
(a) AMENDMENT.—Section 431 of title 18, 
United States Code, is amended— 
(1) in the section heading, by inserting 
‘‘the President, the Vice President, a Cabinet 
Member, or a’’ after ‘‘Contracts by’’; and 
(2) in the first undesignated paragraph, by 
inserting ‘‘the President, the Vice President, 
or any member of the Cabinet,’’ after ‘‘Who-
ever, being’’. 
(b) TABLE OF SECTIONS AMENDMENT.—The 
table of sections for chapter 23 of title 18, 
United States Code, is amended by striking 
the item relating to section 431 and inserting 
the following: 
‘‘431. Contracts by the President, the Vice 
President, a Cabinet Member, 
or a Member of Congress.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. BOWMAN) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to offer a commonsense, good- 
government amendment that has al-
ready passed this House on a bipartisan 
basis. 
Decades ago, Congress recognized 
that there is an inherent conflict of in-
terest when elected officials, who de-
cide how taxpayer dollars are spent,

are also allowed to contract with the 
Federal Government to receive those 
dollars. That is why Federal law pro-
hibits every single Member of this body 
from contracting with the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
At the time, it was thought that 
there was no need to include the Presi-
dent, Vice President, or members of 
the Cabinet in this statutory prohibi-
tion because every recent executive 
had voluntarily divested of their finan-
cial conflicts of interest. Unfortu-
nately, 
that 
trend 
of 
presidential 
transparency was broken by the last 
administration. If we have learned any-
thing from Donald Trump, it is that we 
can no longer rely on norms and tradi-
tion to ensure our elected officials do 
the right thing. 
b 1730 
In 2014, the General Services Admin-
istration awarded The Trump Organi-
zation a contract to operate a hotel in 
the taxpayer-owned Old Post Office Pa-
vilion. A provision in that contract 
specifically stated that no elected offi-
cial of the Government of the United 
States shall be admitted to any share 
or part of this lease or to any benefit 
that may arise therefrom. 
Despite this clear and unambiguous 
prohibition, the GSA shockingly de-
clared that the President of the United 
States could continue to operate this 
hotel on Federal Government property 
and personally benefit from the pro-
ceeds of that operation. 
As a result, it was easier than ever 
for foreign governments and special in-
terests to put money directly into 
President Trump’s pocket. Just ask 
Saudi Arabia, which reportedly spent 
$270,000 at the Trump Hotel in 2017, or 
the island nation of Cyprus, which 
hosted a ‘‘Justice for Cyprus’’ con-
ference there, or the Iraqi sheikh who 
spent tens of thousands of dollars stay-
ing 26 nights at the hotel. 
The solution to this problem is very 
simple. My amendment simply inserts 
‘‘the President, Vice President, and 
any Cabinet member’’ into the existing 
statutory prohibition on Members of 
Congress contracting with the Federal 
Government. 
With the addition of these eight 
words, we can ensure that every elect-
ed official is free from the conflict of 
interest associated with both deciding 
who gets Federal contracts and then 
benefiting from those contracts. 
The American people deserve to 
know their President is working for 
them, not to line their own pockets. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment and hold the President, 
Vice President, and members of the 
Cabinet to the same standard of con-
duct we hold ourselves. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
This amendment would prohibit the 
President, Vice President, and Cabinet 
members from contracting with the 
Federal Government. The amendment 
adds broad new language to the crimi-
nal code and could discourage people 
from entering Federal service. We 
should want and encourage the most 
qualified people to run for office and 
serve in our Federal Government. 
This amendment is completely out-
side the scope of the NDAA and noth-
ing more than a desperate attempt to 
score political points. This is the kind 
of unrelated amendment that does not 
belong in the NDAA. 
We are now 8 months into the Biden 
administration, yet Democrats con-
tinue to push legislation, as mentioned 
by the previous speaker, that is tar-
geted at the Trump administration. 
But what else can Democrats talk 
about? 
Rising 
inflation 
caused 
by 
President Biden’s failed economic poli-
cies? Rising crime caused by Demo-
crats defunding the police? The Biden 
border crisis? 
If Democrats were serious about eth-
ics reform, they would carefully con-
sider this as a standalone bill. Instead, 
they choose to slap it onto an unre-
lated 
bill 
with 
no 
discussion 
or 
thought. This amendment and provi-
sion should go through regular order so 
Members have the opportunity to de-
bate and consider ethics reforms. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Mr. Speaker, to my 
colleagues who oppose this amend-
ment, I ask this simple question: If 
they think the President should be al-
lowed to contract with the Federal 
Government, do they support repealing 
the current statute that prohibits 
every Member of the body from con-
tracting with the Federal Government? 
Of course they don’t. That would be 
outrageous. 
My amendment is common sense. It 
will apply to any President, regardless 
of party affiliation. It will help restore 
integrity to the Office of the President 
by closing the door on self-enrichment 
at the White House. And it will prevent 
some of the corruption that defined the 
Trump Presidency from ever happening 
again. 
I urge my colleagues to support my 
amendment 
and 
impose 
the 
same 
standards of conduct we imposed on 
ourselves to every federally elected of-
ficial. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, this 
is not the bill for this amendment, and 
it certainly should go through the 
process and be given the consideration 
and discussion due true ethics reforms 
instead of amendments that simply 
target the former President and his ad-
ministration. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-
vious

(1) Korean and Korean-American veterans 
of the war in Vietnam served honorably 
throughout the conflict, fighting valiantly 
both as a part of and alongside the United 
States Armed Forces and often making the 
ultimate sacrifice, with many later becom-

War is one of several examples that dem-

their heroism and honorable service.

flict to support the United States Armed 
Forces and the cause of freedom at the re-
quest of the United States. 
(5) From 1964 until the last soldier left Sai-
gon on March 23, 1973, 325,517 members of 
South Korea’s armed forces served in Viet-
nam, the largest contribution of troops sent 
by an ally of the United States.

throughout the theater and were known for 
their dedication, tenacity, and effectiveness 
on the battlefield.

States friends and allies.

cant injuries due to their service in Vietnam,

total disability, and the effects of the toxic 
defoliant Agent Orange. 
(9) Korean-American veterans of the Viet-
nam conflict upheld the highest ideals of the 
United States through their dedicated serv-
ice and considerable sacrifices, with many 
continuing to carry the visible and invisible 
wounds of war to this day.

the following new section: 
SEC. 
16ll. 
LEVERAGING 
COMMERCIAL 
ON- 
ORBIT SATELLITE SERVICING. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) National security depends on reliable 
access to, and safe operations in, space. Mod-
ern society is reliant on space operations, 
but most spacecraft today are designed to be 
discarded at end-of-mission, leaving poten-
tial gaps in mission continuity and contrib-
uting to risk in the space domain. 
(2) Existing and future critical Department 
of Defense missions operating in space and 
providing multidomain support would ben-
efit from the application of commercial On- 
orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufac-
turing 
(in 
this 
section 
referred 
to 
as 
‘‘OSAM’’) capabilities, which extend the lon-
gevity and operability of national security 
space systems through inspection, repair, re-
fueling, and mitigation of debris. 
(3) Because the domain in which space sys-
tems operate is increasingly congested, the 
risk of collisions and orbital debris genera-
tion has increased, a risk that is exacerbated 
by a lack of utilization of OSAM services. A 
secure, stable, and accessible space domain 
is paramount to the unimpeded and resilient 
operations of civil, military, intelligence, 
and commercial space assets by the United 
States and its allies. OSAM technologies 
support Department of Defense strategy by 
improving the adaptability and efficiency of 
existing and future military space architec-
tures. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) Congress strongly encourages the Sec-
retary of Defense to invest in developing 
technologies to support the advancement of 
debris remediation, such as rendezvous, prox-
imity operations, and debris removal as an 
element of OSAM; 
(2) because of the importance of the space 
domain, the Secretary should seek ways to 
collaborate with United States industry 
partners and allied nations; 
(3) beyond technology development, the 
Secretary and the intelligence community 
should consider satellite servicing and active 
disposal as a viable operational trade-off—in 
this way, in the future, a back-up disposal 
plan using direct retrieval should be a pre-
ferred and viable method for relevant or off- 
nominal missions. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than December 3, 
2021, the Secretary of Defense, in consulta-
tion with the Director of National Intel-
ligence and the Administrator of the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion, shall submit to the appropriate con-
gressional committees a report that— 
(1) identifies critical investment areas for 
the further development and usage of com-
mercial OSAM technologies and capabilities 
to meet emerging and changing government 
space mission needs on-orbit; and 
(2) includes a plan for interagency engage-
ment in the standardization and adoption of 
commercial OSAM interfaces for government 
space systems. 
(d) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES
DEFINED.—In this section, the term 
‘‘appropriate 
congressional 
committees’’ 
means— 
(1) the congressional defense committees; 
(2) the Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology and the Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence of the House of Rep-
resentatives; and 
(3) the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation and the Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence of the Senate.

COST 
ANALYSIS 
REPORT 
ON 
CHANGES TO MILITARY PRIORITIES. 
Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of De-
fense shall submit to the Committee on 
Armed Services and the Committee on For-
eign Affairs of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Armed Services and 
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the 
Senate a report on— 
(1) the estimated cost savings as a result of 
a full drawdown of United States personnel 
and contractors from Afghanistan, Iraq, and 
Syria compared with actual costs for such 
personnel and contractors in fiscal year 2021; 
and 
(2) the estimated cost of redirecting United 
States personnel and materials, including in-
creased budget authority for ships, aircraft, 
nuclear weapons, major personnel, and oper-
ational costs, to effectively engage in great 
power competition with Russia and China to 
effectively curb and deter Russia and China 
militarily in their respective regions. 
Mr. SMITH of Washington (during 
the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that the reading of the 
modification be dispensed with. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the original request of the 
gentleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
amendment is modified. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Washington (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN). 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the en bloc package, 
which contains amendment No. 384 to 
create four critical technology security 
centers. 
These 
centers 
would 
be 
created 
through competitive grants issued by 
the Department of Homeland Security 
to universities or federally funded re-
search and development centers, in-
cluding national laboratories. 
Each center would have a different 
focus, with the first four covering net-
work technology, network industrial 
control systems, open source software, 
and Federal critical software, respec-
tively. 
Each center would rigorously test 
the security of a set of technologies de-
veloped with input from the Cybersecu-
rity and Infrastructure Security Agen-
cy, or CISA, the compromise of which 
would represent the highest level of 
risk to our critical infrastructure. 
With respect to those specific tech-
nologies, centers would evaluate their 
overall security posture; develop new 
tools and capabilities for vulnerability 
discovery, management, and mitiga-
tion; and support the remediation of 
the vulnerabilities they find. 
This is an important recommenda-
tion of the Cyberspace Solarium Com-
mission, and I thank my fellow Com-
missioner, Mr. GALLAGHER, for cospon-
soring this amendment. I also thank 
Chairman THOMPSON for his support of 
the measure. I urge Members to sup-
port the en bloc package and the un-
derlying bill. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this en bloc package 
was put together in close consultation 
with the minority. I urge all Members 
to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman, and I thank the 
ranking member for his support, long-
time friends. 
Let me quickly indicate that as I 
have embraced the NDAA over the 
years, it has always been my focus to 
deal with the military personnel and to 
make us the best, the strongest, and 
the most well respected and appre-
ciated. 
I want to thank this committee and 
the Rules Committee for allowing my 
amendments Nos. 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 
196, 197, and 198. Many of them speak 
for themselves. 
Let me clearly say that I have 
worked year after year as a breast can-
cer survivor to ensure that triple-nega-
tive breast cancer, which is one of the 
most deadly forms of cancer—that 
women in the military have the serv-
ices that they need. 
Let me just share with you that tri-
ple-negative breast cancer has a sur-
vival rate of 5 years. The key to beat-
ing this cancer is early detection. 
There is $10 million to enhance re-
search and to help these women. In ad-
dition, I have asked for $2 million for 
post-traumatic stress disorder. I even, 
under then-Colonel Murtha, organized 
a center in my district. 
But the most important point for 
supporting this amendment is that it 
still exists—Operation Iraqi Freedom 
and Enduring Freedom, 11 to 20 out of 
100; Gulf war, 12 out of 100; Vietnam 
war, 30 out of 100. It is still needed, and 
we appreciate this amendment. 
I also want to thank you for recog-
nizing that we are going into space. My 
amendment says that we should have a 
bill that studies the risks proposed by 
man-made space debris in lower orbit, 
including recommendations and reme-
diation of such risks. It is extremely 
important. 
Finally, I want to speak to a very im-
portant amendment dealing with the 
longstanding history of African Ameri-
cans in the United States military, to 
create a task force that respects the 
fact that Crispus Attucks, a runaway 
slave who escaped—during the Boston 
Massacre to the present day—an es-
caped slave who fought in the Revolu-
tionary War with George Washington. 
This story is a long-story story. The 
United States Army and others have a 
very long history. This task force will 
determine the impact of slavery and 
the impact of our soldiers from the 
very early years, who happened to be 
ex-slaves fighting all the way through 
the many different wars. 
I believe we will find that those who 
are descendants of enslaved Africans 
have fought in wars from the very be-
ginning. It is an important story. It 
should be told. I am very pleased that 
this particular amendment is included. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
will just conclude that this task force, 
which will be a very significant histor-
ical study, will be very much appre-
ciated. 
But let me quickly say that having 
worked with our various nominees to 
the military academies, one in par-
ticular was an individual who stut-
tered. By the time he finished, they 
said he could not have his command. 
They never assessed him in the acad-
emy while he was there. 
I believe this is an important assess-
ment, to assess that vital $250,000 stu-
dent, so that when he graduates, he 
will have a command even if he is a 
stutterer because he made it into the 
academy; he was successful academi-
cally; and he should be allowed to serve 
his country. 
I thank you for considering my 
amendments and for them to stay in to 
become law. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my Amend-
ments in the En Bloc Amendment No. 2 to 
H.R. 4350, the National Defense Authorization 
Act for FY 2022, which incorporates Jackson 
Lee Amendments Nos. 191, 192, 193, 194, 
195, 196, 197, and 198. 
I thank the Rules Committee for making 
these amendments in order. 
I also thank Chairman SMITH of the House 
Armed Services Committee and his staff for 
working with me and my staff to include the 
Jackson Lee Amendments in this En Bloc, and 
for his great work in shepherding the bill to the 
floor. 
The amendments included in En Bloc No. 2 
are as follows: 
1. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as 
No. 191—Provides authorization for a $10 mil-
lion increase in funding for increased collabo-
ration with NIH to combat Triple Negative 
Breast Cancer. 
2. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as 
No. 192—Provides authorization for $2.5 mil-

formance on the speech test. Academy stu-
dents shall have the option of undergoing

4. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as 
No. 194 recognizes that Black men and 
women have played an integral role in the de-
fense of the nation from the bravery of Crispus 
Attucks, an escaped slave, during the Boston 
Massacre to the present day, and seeks to de-
termine how to address the historical and cur-
rent barriers to their participation and equal 
treatment in the Armed Services. 
5. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as 
No. 195—Requires report on Maternity Mor-
tality Rates for military members and their de-
pendents. 
6. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as 
No. 196—Requires a report to be submitted to 
Congress within 240 days following enactment 
on the risks posed by debris in low earth orbit 
and to make recommendations on remediation 
of risks and outline plans to reduce the inci-
dent of space debris. 
7. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as 
No. 197—Requires the Secretary of Defense 
to report to Congress programs and proce-
dures employed to ensure students studying 
abroad through Department of Defense Na-
tional Security Education Programs are trained 
to recognize, resist, and report against recruit-
ment efforts by agents of foreign governments. 
8. Jackson Lee Amendment designated as 
No. 198—Directs the Secretary to submit to 
Congress within 180 days a report on the rec-
ognition of African Americans who have 
served in the Armed Forces in DOD naming 
practices and conventions for military installa-
tions, infrastructure, vessels, and weapon sys-
tems. 
Jackson Lee Amendment 191 provides au-
thorization for a $10 million increase in funding 
for increased collaboration with NIH to combat 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer. 
As a Member of Congress, a mother, a sis-
ter, a spouse, and a breast cancer survivor, I 
feel a special responsibility to do all I can to 
ensure every American can win in the fight 
against all types of breast cancer but espe-
cially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). 
WHAT IS TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER? 
The term triple negative breast cancer refers 
to the fact that this form of breast cancer will 
test negative, which means that each of the 
tests will return negative results for the pres-
ence of breast cancer for three types of breast 
cancer tests: 
Estrogen receptor; 
Progesterone receptor; and 
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
or the HER2 test will be negative. 
In addition, triple-negative breast cancer: 
Tends to be more aggressive than other 
types of breast cancer; 
Five-year survival rates also tend to be 
lower for triple-negative breast cancer; and 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer tends to be 
higher grade than other types of breast can-
cer. 
Studies have shown that triple-negative 
breast cancer is more likely to spread beyond 
the breast and more likely to recur (come 
back) after treatment. 
For example, a study of more than 1,600 
women in Canada published in 2007 found 
that women with triple-negative breast cancer 
were at higher risk of having the cancer recur 
outside the breast—but only for the first 3 
years. 
As years go by, the risks of the triple-nega-
tive breast cancer recurring become similar to 
those risk levels for other types of breast can-
cer. 
The key to beating this cancer is not just 
early detection—but detection period. 
A 2007 study of more than 50,000 women 
with all stages of breast cancer found that 77 
percent of women with triple-negative breast 
cancer survived at least 5 years, versus 93 
percent of women with other types of breast 
cancer. 
Another study of more than 1,600 women 
published in 2007 found that women with tri-
ple-negative breast cancer had a higher risk of 
death within 5 years of diagnosis, but not after 
that time period. 
The recurrence and survival figures in these 
and other studies are averages for all women 
with triple-negative breast cancer. 
Factors such as the grade and stage of the 
breast cancer will influence an individual wom-
an’s prognosis. 
About 15–20 percent of breast cancers are 
triple negative. 
Triple Negative tumors tend to occur more 
often in younger women and African-American 
women. 
In studies of U.S. and British women, triple 
negative breast cancer appears to be more 
common among black women (especially be-
fore menopause) compared to white women. 
Triple negative breast cancer may also be 
more common among Hispanic women com-
pared to white women. 
Although the reasons for racial/ethnic dif-
ferences in rates of triple negative breast can-
cer are not clear, lifestyle factors may play a 
role. 
For example, some findings show African- 
American women tend to have lower rates of 
breastfeeding compared to other women, 
which may increase the chances of having tri-
ple negative breast cancer. 
For these individuals and the tens of thou-
sands of survivors and their daughters this 
amendment is needed. 
Jackson Lee Amendment 192 provides au-
thorization for $2.5 million increase in funding 
to combat post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD). 
PTSD was first brought to public attention in 
relation to war veterans, but it can result from 
a variety of traumatic incidents, such as tor-
ture, being kidnapped or held captive, bomb-
ings, or natural disasters such as floods or 
earthquakes. 
People with PTSD may startle easily, be-
come emotionally numb (especially in relation 
to people with whom they used to be close), 
lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have 
trouble feeling affectionate, be irritable, be-
come more aggressive, or even become vio-
lent. 
They avoid situations that remind them of 
the original incident, and anniversaries of the 
incident are often very difficult. 
Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive 
the trauma in their thoughts during the day 
and in nightmares when they sleep. These are 
called flashbacks. A person having a flash-
back may lose touch with reality and believe 
that the traumatic incident is happening all 
over again. 
My amendment recognizes that these sol-
diers are, first and foremost, human. They 
carry their experiences with them. 
Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghani-
stan about the frequency of nightmares they 
experience, and one will realize that serving in 
the Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, 
whether good or bad. 
According to the National Center for PTSD, 
the number of Veterans with PTSD varies by 
service era: 
Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Endur-
ing Freedom (OEF): About 11–20 out of every 
100 Veterans (or between 11–20 percent) who 
served in OIF or OEF have PTSD in a given 
year. 
Gulf War (Desert Storm): About 12 out of 
every 100 Gulf War Veterans (or 12 percent) 
have PTSD in a given year. 
Vietnam War: It is estimated that about 30 
out of every 100 (or 30 percent) of Vietnam 
Veterans have had PTSD in their lifetime. 
Another cause of PTSD in the military can 
be military sexual trauma (MST). This is any 
sexual harassment or sexual assault that oc-
curs while you are in the military. 
MST can happen to both men and women 
and can occur during peacetime, training, or 
war. 
Among Veterans who use VA health care, 
about: 
23 out of 100 women (or 23 percent) re-
ported sexual assault when in the military. 
55 out of 100 women (or 55 percent) and 38 
out of 100 men (or 38 percent) have experi-
enced sexual harassment when in the military. 
My amendment will help ensure that ‘‘no 
soldier is left behind’’ by addressing the urgent 
need for more outreach toward hard-to-reach 
veterans suffering from PTSD, especially 
those who are homeless or reside in under-
served urban and rural areas of our country. 
Jackson Lee Amendment ±194 recognizes 
that Black men and women have played an in-
tegral role in the defense of the nation, from 
the bravery of Crispus Attucks, an escaped 
slave, during the Boston Massacre to the 
present day, and seeks to determine how to 
address the historical and current barriers to 
their participation and equal treatment in the 
Armed Services. 
Black Americans became pilots, nurses, Ma-
rines, and West Point graduates, but it was 
not until President Harry S. Truman issued an 
executive order in 1948 that the armed serv-
ices were integrated; and even then, some 
units refused to do so for several more years. 
In 1777, when George Washington faced a 
dearth of white soldiers willing to fight on be-
half of the colonies, he allowed Black men to 
fight in the continental army and during the 
harsh winter of 1778 the Rhode Island Assem-
bly, therefore, passed a law in 1778 allowing 
‘‘every able-bodied negro, mulatto, or Indian 
man slave in this state to enlist.’’ 
100 black soldiers signed up in exchange 
for their freedom. 
During the Civil War, around 179,000 Black 
men served in the Union army, either in the 
Army, Navy, or non-combat positions and 
more than 40,000 gave the last full measure 
of devotion to their country. 
Over 125,000 Black soldiers served over-
seas in the segregated military during World

War II, but the U.S. military remained seg-
regated. 
When Black veterans came home, many 
found it difficult to get housing or jobs because 
White veterans were given preference. 
The racial inequality and mistreatment of 
Black men and women that has historically 
permeated our military continues to this day, 
with more than 750 complaints of discrimina-
tion by race or ethnicity from service members 
in the fiscal year 2020 alone. 
But discrimination doesn’t exist just within 
the military rank-and-file, as in that same fiscal 
year, civilians working in the financial, tech-
nical, and support sectors of the Army, Air 
Force; and Navy also filed 900 complaints of 
racial discrimination and over 350 complaints 
of discrimination by skin color, data from the 
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-
sion shows. 
According to a report by the Defense De-
partment’s Diversity and Inclusion Board, while 
the enlisted ranks of the active and reserve 
military were ‘‘slightly more racially and eth-
nically diverse than its U.S. civilian counter-
parts,’’ the opposite was true for the officer 
corps. 
With the rise and normalization of white su-
premacist expression during the Trump admin-
istration, the concept of restorative justice has 
gained more urgency, garnering the attention 
of mainstream commentators, and illustrating 
the need for a national reckoning. 
We owe it to those brave men and women 
who have proven time and time again to be an 
integral part of our military to examine the 
Armed Services’ history of discrimination and 
to determine the necessary steps to repair the 
harm caused by these inequities. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 96 directs that 
the Secretary of DoD provide a report 240 
days from enactment of this bill on the risks 
posed by man-made space debris in low-earth 
orbit, including recommendations on remedi-
ation of such risks, and outlines of plans to re-
duce the incident of space debris. 
Space debris encompasses both natural 
and artificial particles. 
This Jackson Lee Amendment would ad-
dress the risk of man-made space debris. 
Man-made objects in Earth’s orbit that may 
no longer serve a useful function can include 
nonfunctional spacecraft, abandoned launch 
vehicle stages, mission-related debris and 
fragmentation debris. 
Space debris travels at speeds up to 17,500 
miles per hour is fast enough for a small piece 
of man-made debris to damage a satellite or 
a spacecraft. 
There are more than 20,000 pieces of de-
bris larger than a softball orbiting the Earth. 
There are 500,000 pieces of debris the size 
of a marble or larger. 
There are many millions of pieces of debris 
that are so small they can’t be tracked. 
NASA tracks more than 500,000 pieces of 
man-made space debris in Earth’s orbit. 
This amendment seeks a report from the 
Secretary of Defense on the risks posed by 
man-made space debris, solutions for reduc-
ing risks and strategies for reducing the inci-
dence of more man-made space debris being 
introduced into space.

Amendment No. 2 and the underlying legisla-
tion, H.R. 4350, the National Defense Author-
ization Act for FY 2022

Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT), my long-
time friend and colleague. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of amendment 165. It creates a 
separate career track for military 
judges to prevent undue influence from 
command above. 
In the 1970s it was seen that it would 
be good for trial defense attorneys to 
have a separate track so that they 
were not rated by the same person who 
was pushing to have a court martial. 
That created some problems and at 
times some abuses. 
The separation and the creation of a 
trial defense service served a great pur-
pose, but before 2004 each of the judge 
advocates general of the armed serv-
ices subscribed to the policy that all 
judge advocates should have a broad 
career and move from job to job. They 
became quite good at all trades but 
masters of none. 
So junior judge advocates would try 
a few court martials, then move from 
one job to another. It gave them a 
broad basis, but it was not helpful 
overall. 
By giving the military judges a sepa-
rate career track, it will ensure avoid-
ance of undue command influence and 
will give our servicemembers the fair 
trials they deserve. I would encourage 
everyone to vote for this amendment. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI). 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speak-
er, I urge support of my amendment, 
which would permit the Secretary of 
HHS to receive unused and oftentimes 
just about to expire COVID vaccines 
from States and be able to redistribute 
them to foreign partners or allies. 
Now, my primary legislation before 
the body in Congress is called NOVID. 
It is a play on words, no more COVID. 
And this legislation would actually es-
tablish a program to help vaccinate 60 
percent of the population of the world’s 
92 poorest countries. I hope that this 
legislation is taken up by this body and 
supported by the administration. 
In the meantime, the very least that 
we can do is to donate unused vaccines 
from the States. Now, these vaccines 
are about to expire. They are going to 
be no good in just a matter of months, 
and so instead of allowing them to go 
to waste, we should donate them 
abroad. 
This is not only the right thing to do 
to help to end suffering abroad, but it 
is the smart thing to do because then it 
helps to prevent variants that are gen-
erated abroad from coming back home 
to the United States and further 
wreaking havoc on our economy. 
On top of that, we see the Chinese 
Communist Party going around the 
world 
peddling 
their 
ineffective 
Sinovac vaccine, and we should be in-
stead vaccinating those populations 
with effective vaccines. 
Again, I hope that the administra-
tion utilizes this amendment to great 
impact, and I hope that they also do 
more and endorse my NOVID legisla-
tion. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. JACKSON), an out-
standing freshman member of the 
Armed Services Committee. 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support 
of 
my 
amendment, 
which 
clearly states that Israel is a critical 
defense partner of ours. Our national 
security is inextricably linked to our 
relationship with and our military’s 
support for Israel. 
As our strongest ally in the Middle 
East, it is critical that we conduct 
military exercises with Israel to im-
prove interoperability and readiness. 
We must ensure that Israel has the ca-
pabilities it needs to defend itself 
against terrorists with consistent and 
reliable transfers of defense articles. 
Last year, President Trump nego-
tiated the historic Abraham Accords, 
and to honor that, my amendment 
states clear support for Israel’s work to 
promote peace. While some in this body 
have made their disdain for the Jewish 
State of Israel clear, I believe our rela-
tionship with Israel is nonnegotiable. 
Our friends in Israel are currently 
questioning our commitment because 
some of my more radical colleagues 
forced the Speaker to withdraw finan-
cial support for the Iron Dome yester-
day. 
I urge all Members of this body to 
support my amendment. We must take 
this step to show the only democracy 
in the Middle East that they can count 
on us for support. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY). 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of en bloc No. 2, which 
includes three amendments I worked 
on. 
Amendment No. 217 establishes a 
pilot transition assistance program for 
military spouses, offering similar serv-
ices to those available for members of 
our Armed Forces. 
This includes mental health first aid 
training since military spouses are well 
positioned to notice warning signs for 
any mental health or subsequent abuse 
struggles a new veteran might experi-
ence. 
Amendment No. 218 will improve 
interagency communication as the low 
Earth orbit becomes more crowded 
with defense, civil, and commercial 
space assets. 
Finally, amendment No. 158 with 
Representative GONZALES will create a 
National Digital Reserve Corps to 
bring private sector talent into the 
Federal Government to work on short- 
term projects. We need more cyberse-
curity, artificial intelligence, and de-
veloper expertise in the Federal Gov-
ernment if we are going to meet the 
challenges of the 21st century. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
en bloc.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4988 
September 22, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. GARCIA), an out-
standing freshman member of our Con-
ference. 
Mr. 
GARCIA 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of my crit-
ical, bipartisan, bicameral bill, the 
Military Spouse Licensing Relief Act, 
which was included as an amendment 
in this en bloc package. 
My amendment would support mili-
tary families by allowing military 
spouses with valid professional licenses 
in one State reciprocity in another 
State where their spouse is stationed 
on military orders. This effectively al-
lows the spouse to cross-deck their pro-
fessional license to another State while 
their spouse is on Active Duty. 
More than 30 percent of our military 
spouses work in a field requiring pro-
fessional licensing, and when these 
families receive move orders to a new 
State, military spouses often must 
spend time and money to reapply for a 
professional license that they already 
have. On average, military families 
lose thousands of dollars per move in 
lost wages and fees caused by reli-
censing barriers, and in many cases the 
spouse ends up not even applying for 
the license because it takes too long or 
is too costly to do so. 
The struggle often threatens the eco-
nomic security and quality of life for 
these families, as their loved ones 
serve our Nation. No military spouse 
should have to decide between job secu-
rity and being with their family. Mili-
tary families already sacrifice so much 
in service to our great country, and we 
must work to protect these families. 
At a time in which our communities 
are also facing critical shortages of 
skilled professionals, like nurses and 
teachers, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this commonsense amendment 
that will drastically improve the qual-
ity of life for our military families as 
well as our communities. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the bipar-
tisan National Defense Authorization 
Act, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the bill and my five amendments 
included in the bill. 
My State of North Carolina is home 
to eight military bases and more than 
800,000 Active Duty military service-
members and veterans. 
The NDAA will give these service-
members a 2.7 percent pay raise and 
add a crucial level of accountability by 
taking the prosecution of sexual as-
sault and other crimes out of the chain 
of command. 
I urge support for my amendment re-
quiring the military to consider the 
benefits of using electric vehicles for 
students at military installations. In-
creased use of electric vehicles by our 
military will help accelerate our tran-
sition to clean energy and create good- 
paying jobs in districts like mine. 
This bill also includes my amend-
ments to express concern about the 
safety of Afghan women and girls and 
to require the Secretary of Defense to 
appoint an official to assist the State 
Department 
with 
continued 
evacu-
ations from Afghanistan. We must do 
better for the people who helped our 
troops. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
act. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Puerto 
Rico 
(Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in support of my amendments 
that are included in this amendment en 
bloc number 2 for the National Defense 
Authorization Act. 
This bill includes three amendments 
that were submitted by my office that 
will directly benefit our Nation’s secu-
rity and, of course, the people of Puer-
to Rico. 
The first one is amendment 162, 
which authorizes research into the 
health effects of nearly 70 years of live 
fire training in the municipality of 
Vieques. 
As well, amendment 163 supports the 
Puerto Rico National Guard by prohib-
iting the retirement of the current 
landing craft ships, or the MAG boats, 
not only used in the aftermath of Hur-
ricanes Irma and Maria in 2019 and that 
were used again in March of this year. 
The Puerto Rico National Guard has 
used these ships to provide lifesaving 
food, water, and other equipment to 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, Vieques, and 
Culebra after any natural disaster. We 
cannot afford to retire these ships until 
they are replaced. 
Lastly, will be amendment 164, which 
requires the Secretary of the Army to 
allocate a Modular Small Arms Range 
to Puerto Rico. This is to increase the 
readiness of the Armed Forces. Right 
now, Puerto Rico only has a single fire-
arms range for the Department of De-
fense personnel. That means that there 
are numerous scheduling conflicts, and 
it decreases the mission readiness on 
the island. 
I think those amendments should be 
supported. 
I want to thank Chairman SMITH and 
Ranking Member ROGERS; I really ap-
preciate all their good work on this 
NDAA. Included in this en bloc are nu-
merous provisions for the people of 
Puerto Rico as a territory. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. LAW-
RENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the FY22 NDAA. 
As the co-chair of the Democratic 
Women’s Caucus, I am proud to see two 
of my amendments, 238 and 239, in-
cluded as part of this en bloc. 
These amendments would help us un-
derstand the factors that influence 
women servicemembers to stay in or 
leave the military as well as to take 
action to improve mental health out-
comes for pregnant veterans. 
Unfortunately, 
pregnant 
veterans 
have been found to be disproportion-
ately impacted by mental health dis-
orders and must be given adequate sup-
port to prevent childbirth complica-
tions. 
This language would encourage the 
VA to support the use of doulas for ex-
pectant mothers and increase access 
for doulas for pregnant veterans. 
This is a time we must come together 
in our support of the growing number 
of women in the military. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), my friend 
and an outstanding leader on the Fi-
nancial Services Committee. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman of the committee and my 
ranking member for the world-class 
work on this NDAA package. 
This package contains two of my 
amendments. First, my bipartisan bill, 
H.R. 3146, the SAVE Act, passed the 
House unanimously earlier this year, is 
included as an amendment. The SAVE 
Act builds on the good work of the 
Armed Services Committee to include 
important provisions to counter China 
by improving the U.S. supply chain 
independence and security. 
Secondly, this en bloc includes my 
amendment to require the creation of 
an interagency strategy within the 
United States Government to disrupt 
and dismantle the production and traf-
ficking of the drug Captagon that is 
being produced by the Syrian regime 
led by Assad. 
b 1800 
In addition to regularly committing 
war crimes against his own people, the 
Assad regime is now becoming a narco- 
state. 
The United States Government must 
do all it can to disrupt this industrial 
level of production of this drug cur-
rently taking place in Syria. 
I thank my friends for their support 
of these amendments, and I urge sup-
port of this en bloc. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I am prepared to close, therefore, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I urge support of the amendments 
en bloc, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I urge support of the amend-
ments en bloc, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of en bloc package num-
ber two for the National Defense Authorization 
Act of 2022. 
This bill includes three amendments that 
were submitted by my office and will directly 
benefit the people of Puerto Rico and our Na-
tion’s security. 
Amendment 162 requires the Secretary of 
Defense to enter into an agreement with the 
National Academy of Sciences for the purpose 
of investigating the health effects on the island 
Municipality of Vieques that may have been

caused by toxic waste left after nearly 70 
years of live fire training. 
This waste includes heavy metals like lead, 
cancer-causing fuel chemicals, and even de-
pleted uranium. In some locations, areas are 
so contaminated that it is not safe for workers 
to collect samples. 
While there are numerous studies from dif-
ferent government agencies on this topic, in-
cluding from the Centers for Disease Control 
and Government Accountability Office, much 
work remains to be done to further understand 
the consequences from this practice. 
I am proud to say that this legislation now 
builds upon existing research for this important 
topic. 
Amendment number 163 prohibits the Sec-
retary of Defense from retiring the Landing 
Craft ships used by Puerto Rico’s Army Na-
tional Guard until such time as an adequate 
replacement is provided. 
These ships delivered critical food, water, 
and other materials to Puerto Rico’s non-
contiguous islands of Vieques and Culebra, as 
well as the US Virgin Islands, following the 
aftermath of Hurricane Maria. 
The landing craft ships were scheduled to 
be retired this year, however the adopted 
amendment prohibits this decommissioning 
until replacement equipment arrives to Puerto 
Rico. 
My third and last amendment, number 164, 
requires the Secretary of the Army to allocate 
a Modular Small Arms Range to Puerto Rico. 
Currently, Puerto Rico only has a single fire-
arms range for Department of Defense per-
sonnel. 
This creates numerous scheduling conflicts 
and decreases mission readiness. 
Puerto Rico’s own Fort Buchanan has the 
capacity to support a Modular Small Arms 
Range. My office has met with both Army 
leaders who support this request. 
Let me close by noting that H.R. 4350 in-
cludes funding over 12 million dollars in fund-
ing for Fort Allen and 10 million for the Ramey 
Unit School, under the energy resilience and 
conservation program. Finally, H.R. 4350 in-
cludes 14 million under military construction 
for Fort Buchanan in Puerto Rico. I am appre-
ciative of the Armed Service committees work 
and I look forward to seeing these projects to 
completion. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor 
of en bloc number two.

ant to House Resolution 667, the pre-

ture the dietary supplements to be provided 
pursuant to subsection (c)(3) at a manufac-
turing facility owned by the contractor. In

ance with the adverse event reporting policy

lowing new title: 
TITLE 
LIV—SAUDI 
ARABIA 
ACCOUNT-
ABILITY FOR GROSS VIOLATIONS OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 
SEC. 5401. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Saudi Ara-
bia Accountability for Gross Violations of 
Human Rights Act’’. 
SEC. 5402. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On October 2, 2018, Washington Post 
journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered by 
Saudi Government agents in Istanbul. 
(2) According to the United Nations Spe-
cial Rapporteur’s June 2019 report, Mr. 
Khashoggi contacted the Saudi Embassy in 
Washington regarding required documenta-
tion he needed to obtain from Saudi authori-
ties and ‘‘was told to obtain the document 
from the Saudi embassy in Turkey’’. 
(3) 
According 
to 
press 
reports, 
Mr. 
Khashoggi’s associates were surveilled after 
having their phones infiltrated by spyware. 
(4) On July 15, 2019, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed by a margin of 405-7 the 
Saudi Arabia Human Rights and Account-
ability Act of 2019 (H.R. 2037), which re-
quired— 
(A) an unclassified report by the Director 
of National Intelligence on parties respon-
sible for Khashoggi’s murder, a requirement 
ultimately inserted into and passed as part 
of the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92); 
(B) visa sanctions on all persons identified 
in such report; and 
(C) a report on human rights in Saudi Ara-
bia. 
(5) On February 26, 2021, the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence released the report pro-
duced pursuant to congressional direction, 
which stated, ‘‘we assess that Saudi Arabia’s 
Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman ap-
proved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey to 
capture or kill Saudi journalist Jamal 
Khashoggi.’’. The report also identified sev-
eral individuals who ‘‘participated in, or-
dered, or were otherwise complicit in or re-
sponsible for the death of Jamal Khashoggi 
on behalf of Muhammad bin Salman. We do 
not know whether these individuals knew in 
advance that the operation would result in 
Khashoggi’s death.’’. 
(6) Section 7031(c) of division K of the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2021 states 
‘‘Officials of foreign governments and their 
immediate family members about whom the 
Secretary of State has credible information 
have been involved, directly or indirectly, 
in. . .a gross violation of human rights. . . 
shall be ineligible for entry into the United 
States.’’. 
(7) Section 6 of the Arms Export Control 
Act (22 U.S.C. 2756) provides that no letters 
of offer may be issued, no credits or guaran-
tees may be extended, and no export licenses 
may be issued with respect to any country 
determined by the President to be engaged in 
a ‘‘consistent pattern of acts of intimidation 
or harassment directed against individuals 
in the United States’’. 
(8) Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance 
Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2304) directs the Presi-
dent to formulate and conduct international 
security assistance programs of the United 
States in a manner which will ‘‘promote and 
advance human rights and avoid identifica-
tion of the United States, through such pro-
grams, with governments which deny to 
their 
people 
internationally 
recognized 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, in 
violation of international law or in con-
travention of the policy of the United 
States’’. 
(9) Secretary of State Antony Blinken on 
February 26, 2021, stated: ‘‘As a matter of 
safety for all within our borders, perpetra-
tors targeting perceived dissidents on behalf 
of any foreign government should not be per-
mitted to reach American soil. . . We have 
made absolutely clear that extraterritorial 
threats and assaults by Saudi Arabia against 
activists, dissidents, and journalists must 
end.’’.

AMENDMENT NO. 276 OFFERED BY MR. MCCAUL OF 
TEXAS 
Add at the end of subtitle E of title XII the 
following: 
SEC. 12ll. STATEMENT OF CONGRESS REGARD-
ING 
ONGOING 
ABUSES 
AGAINST 
UYGHURS. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) On December 9, 1948, the United Nations 
General Assembly unanimously adopted the 
Convention on the Prevention and Punish-
ment of the Crime of Genocide (the Genocide 
Convention) signifying a commitment in re-
sponse to the Holocaust and other crimes 
against humanity committed in the first half 
of the twentieth century. 
(2) The Genocide Convention entered into 
force on January 12, 1951, and declares that 
all state parties ‘‘confirm that genocide, 
whether committed in time of peace or in 
time of war, is a crime under international 
law which they undertake to prevent and to 
punish’’. 
(3) The Genocide Convention defines geno-
cide as ‘‘any of the following acts committed 
with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a 
national, ethnical, racial or religious group, 
as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) 
Causing serious bodily or mental harm to 
members of the group; (c) Deliberately in-
flicting on the group conditions of life cal-
culated to bring about its physical destruc-
tion in whole or in part; (d) Imposing meas-
ures intended to prevent births within the 
group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of 
the group to another group’’. 
(4) The United States ratified the Genocide 
Convention with the understanding that the 
commission of genocide requires ‘‘the spe-
cific intent to destroy, in whole or in sub-
stantial part, a [protected] group as such’’. 
(5) The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is 
a state party to the Genocide Convention. 
(6) Since 2017, the PRC Government, under 
the direction and control of the Chinese 
Communist Party (CCP), has detained and 
sought to indoctrinate more than one mil-
lion Uyghurs and members of other ethnic 
and religious minority groups. 
(7) Recent data indicate a significant drop 
in birth rates among Uyghurs due to en-
forced sterilization, enforced abortion, and 
more onerous birth quotas for Uyghurs com-
pared to Han. 
(8) There are credible reports of PRC Gov-
ernment campaigns to promote marriages 
between Uyghurs and Han and to reduce 
birth rates among Uyghurs and other Turkic 
Muslims. 
(9) Many Uyghurs reportedly have been as-
signed to factory employment under condi-
tions that indicate forced labor, and some 
former detainees have reported food depriva-
tion, beatings, suppression of religious prac-
tices, family separation, and sexual abuse. 
(10) This is indicative of a systematic ef-
fort to eradicate the ethnic and cultural 
identity and religious beliefs, and prevent 
the births of, Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs and 
Kyrgyz, and members of religious minority 
groups. 
(11) The birth rate in the Xinjiang region 
fell by 24 percent in 2019 compared to a 4.2 
percent decline nationwide. 
(12) On January 19, 2021, the Department of 
State determined the PRC Government, 
under the direction and control of the CCP, 
has committed crimes against humanity and 
genocide against Uyghurs and other ethnic 
and religious minority groups in Xinjiang. 
(13) Secretary of State Antony Blinken and 
Former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo 
have both stated that what has taken place 
in Xinjiang is genocide and constitutes 
crimes against humanity. 
(14) Article VIII of the Genocide Conven-
tion provides, ‘‘Any Contracting Party may 
call upon the competent organs of the United 
Nations to take such action under the Char-
ter of the United Nations as they consider 
appropriate for the prevention and suppres-
sion of acts of genocide’’. 
(15) The International Court of Justice has 
stated that it is the obligation of all state 
parties to the Genocide Convention to ‘‘em-
ploy all means reasonably available to them, 
so as to prevent genocide so far as possible’’. 
(16) The United States is a Permanent 
Member of the United Nations Security 
Council. 
(b) STATEMENT OF CONGRESS.—Congress— 
(1) finds that the ongoing abuses against 
Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and re-
ligious minority groups constitute genocide 
as defined in the Genocide Convention and 
crimes against humanity as understood 
under customary international law; 
(2) attributes these atrocity crimes against 
Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and re-
ligious minority groups to the People’s Re-
public of China, under the direction and con-
trol of the Chinese Communist Party; 
(3) condemns this genocide and these 
crimes against humanity in the strongest 
terms; and 
(4) calls upon the President to direct the 
United States Permanent Representative to 
the United Nations to use the voice, vote, 
and influence of the United States to— 
(A) refer the People’s Republic of China’s 
genocide 
and 
crimes 
against 
humanity 
against Uyghurs and members of other eth-
nic and religious minority groups to the 
competent organs of the United Nations for 
investigation; 
(B) seize the United Nations Security 
Council of the circumstances of this geno-
cide and crimes against humanity and lead 
efforts to invoke multilateral sanctions in 
response to these ongoing atrocities; and 
(C) take all possible actions to bring this 
genocide and these crimes against humanity 
to an end and hold the perpetrators of these 
atrocities accountable under international 
law.

SEC. 7102. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE 
OF DEPARTMENT OF STATE’S WORK. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) United States global engagement is key 
to a stable and prosperous world; 
(2) United States leadership is indispen-
sable in light of the many complex and inter-
connected threats facing the United States 
and the world; 
(3) diplomacy and development are critical 
tools of national power, and full deployment 
of these tools is vital to United States na-
tional security; 
(4) challenges such as the global refugee 
and migration crises, terrorism, historic 
famine and food insecurity, and fragile or re-
pressive societies cannot be addressed with-
out sustained and robust United States dip-
lomatic and development leadership; 
(5) the United States Government must use 
all of the instruments of national security 
and foreign policy at its disposal to protect 
United 
States 
citizens, 
promote 
United 
States interests and values, and support 
global stability and prosperity; 
(6) United States security and prosperity 
depend on having partners and allies that 
share our interests and values, and these 
partnerships are nurtured and our shared in-
terests and values are promoted through 
United States diplomatic engagement, secu-
rity cooperation, economic statecraft, and 
assistance that helps further economic de-
velopment, good governance, including the 
rule of law and democratic institutions, and 
the development of shared responses to nat-
ural and humanitarian disasters; 
(7) as the United States Government agen-
cies primarily charged with conducting di-
plomacy and development, the Department 
and the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) require sus-
tained and robust funding to carry out this 
important work, which is essential to our 
ability to project United States leadership 
and values and to advance United States in-
terests around the world; 
(8) the work of the Department and USAID 
makes the United States and the world safer 
and more prosperous by alleviating global 
poverty and hunger, fighting HIV/AIDS and 
other infectious diseases, strengthening alli-
ances, expanding educational opportunities 
for women and girls, promoting good govern-
ance and democracy, supporting anti-corrup-
tion efforts, driving economic development 
and trade, preventing armed conflicts and 
humanitarian crises, and creating American 
jobs and export opportunities; 
(9) the Department and USAID are vital 
national security agencies, whose work is 
critical to the projection of United States 
power and leadership worldwide, and without 
which Americans would be less safe, United 
States economic power would be diminished, 
and global stability and prosperity would 
suffer; 
(10) investing in diplomacy and develop-
ment before conflicts break out saves Amer-
ican lives while also being cost-effective; and 
(11) the contributions of personnel working 
at the Department and USAID are extraor-
dinarily valuable and allow the United 
States to maintain its leadership around the 
world.

to prepare them to promote and defend 
United States national interests and the 
health and safety of United States citizens 
abroad; 
(2) the Department of State’s investment 
of time and resources with respect to the 
training and education of its personnel is 
considerably below the level of other Federal 
departments and agencies in the national se-
curity field, and falls well below the invest-
ments many allied and adversarial countries 
make in the development of their diplomats; 
(3) the Department faces increasingly com-
plex and rapidly evolving challenges, many 
of which are science and technology-driven, 
and which demand the continual, high-qual-
ity training and education of its personnel; 
(4) the Department must move beyond reli-
ance on ‘‘on-the-job training’’ and other in-
formal mentorship practices, which lead to 
an inequality in skillset development and ca-
reer advancement opportunities, often par-
ticularly for minority personnel, and to-
wards a robust professional tradecraft train-
ing continuum that will provide for greater 
equality in career advancement and increase 
minority participation in the senior ranks; 
(5) the Department’s Foreign Service Insti-
tute and other training facilities should seek 
to substantially increase its educational and 
training offerings to Department personnel, 
including developing new and innovative 
educational and training courses, methods, 
programs, and opportunities; and 
(6) consistent with existing Department 
gift acceptance authority and other applica-
ble laws, the Department and Foreign Serv-
ice Institute may accept funds and other re-
sources from foundations, not-for-profit cor-
porations, and other appropriate sources to 
help the Department and the Institute en-
hance the quantity and quality of training 
offerings, especially in the introduction of 
new, innovative, and pilot model courses. 
(b) TRAINING
FLOAT.—Not later than 90 
days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of State shall develop and 
submit to the appropriate congressional 
committees a strategy to establish a ‘‘train-
ing float’’ to allow for up to 15 percent of the 
Civil and Foreign Service to participate in 
long-term training at any given time. The 
strategy should identify steps necessary to 
ensure implementation of the training prior-
ities identified in subsection (c), sufficient 
training capacity and opportunities are 
available to Civil and Foreign Service offi-
cers, equitable distribution of long-term 
training opportunities to Civil and Foreign 
Service officers, and any additional re-
sources or authorities necessary to facilitate 
such a training float, including programs at 
the George P. Schultz National Foreign Af-
fairs Training Center, the Foreign Service 
Institute, 
the 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Security 
Training Center, and other facilities or pro-
grams operated by the Department of State. 
The strategy shall identify which types of 
training would be prioritized, the extent (if 
any) to which such training is already being 
provided to Civil and Foreign Service offi-
cers by the Department of State, any factors 
incentivizing or disincentivizing such train-
ing, and why such training cannot be 
achieved without Civil and Foreign Service 
officers leaving the workforce. In addition to 
training opportunities provided by the De-
partment, the strategy shall consider train-
ing that could be provided by the other 
United States Government training institu-
tions, as well as non-governmental edu-
cational institutions. The strategy shall con-
sider approaches to overcome disincentives 
to pursuing long-term training. 
(c) PRIORITIZATION.—In order to provide the 
Civil and Foreign Service with the level of 
education and training needed to effectively 
advance United States interests across the 
globe, the Department of State should— 
(1) increase its offerings— 
(A) of virtual instruction to make training 
more 
accessible 
to 
personnel 
deployed 
throughout the world; or 
(B) at partner organizations to provide use-
ful outside perspectives to Department per-
sonnel; 
(2) offer courses utilizing computer-based 
or assisted simulations, allowing civilian of-
ficers to lead decision-making in a crisis en-
vironment; and 
(3) consider increasing the duration and ex-
panding 
the 
focus 
of 
certain 
training 
courses, including— 
(A) the A-100 orientation course for For-
eign Service officers, and 
(B) the chief of mission course to more ac-
curately reflect the significant responsibil-
ities accompanying such role. 
(d) 
OTHER
AGENCY
RESPONSIBILITIES.— 
Other national security agencies should in-
crease the enrollment of their personnel in 
courses at the Foreign Service Institute and 
other Department of State training facilities 
to promote a whole-of-government approach 
to mitigating national security challenges.

STRUCTION. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Department’s Bureau of 
Overseas Building Operations (OBO) or suc-

shall carry out any new United States em-
bassy compound or new consulate compound 
project that utilizes a non-standard design, 
including those projects that are in the de-
sign or pre-design phase as of the date of the 
enactment of this Act, only in consultation 
with the appropriate congressional commit-
tees. The Secretary shall provide the appro-
priate congressional committees, for each 
such project, the following documentation: 
(1) A comparison of the estimated full 
lifecycle costs of the project to the esti-
mated full lifecycle costs of such project if it 
were to use a standard design. 
(2) A comparison of the estimated comple-
tion date of such project to the estimated 
completion date of such project if it were to 
use a standard design. 
(3) A comparison of the security of the 
completed project to the security of such 
completed project if it were to use a stand-
ard design. 
(4) A justification for the Secretary’s selec-
tion of a non-standard design over a standard 
design for such project. 
(5) A written explanation if any of the doc-
umentation necessary to support the com-
parisons and justification, as the case may 
be, described in paragraphs (1) through (4)

(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON WORKFORCE RE-
CRUITMENT.—It is the sense of Congress that 
the Secretary of State should continue to 
hold entry-level classes for Foreign Service 
officers and specialists and continue to re-
cruit civil servants through programs such 
as the Presidential Management Fellows 
Program and Pathways Internship Programs 
in a manner and at a frequency consistent 
with prior years and consistent with the 
need to maintain a pool of experienced per-
sonnel effectively distributed across skill 
codes and ranks. It is further the sense of 
Congress that absent continuous recruit-
ment and training of Foreign Service officers 
and civil servants, the Department of State 
will lack experienced, qualified personnel in 
the short, medium, and long terms. 
(b) LIMITATION.—The Secretary of State 
should not implement any reduction-in-force 
action under section 3502 or 3595 of title 5,

ments for early separation or retirement 
under any other provision of law unless— 
(1) the appropriate congressional commit-
tees are notified not less than 15 days in ad-
vance of such obligation or expenditure; and 
(2) the Secretary has provided to the ap-
propriate congressional committees a de-
tailed report that describes the Department 
of State’s strategic staffing goals, includ-
ing— 
(A) a justification that describes how any 
proposed workforce reduction enhances the 
effectiveness of the Department; 
(B) a certification that such workforce re-
duction is in the national interest of the 
United States; 
(C) a comprehensive strategic staffing plan 
for the Department, including 5-year work-
force forecasting and a description of the an-
ticipated impact of any proposed workforce 
reduction; and 
(D) a dataset displaying comprehensive 
workforce data for all current and planned 
employees of the Department, disaggregated 
by— 
(i) Foreign Service officer and Foreign 
Service specialist rank; 
(ii) civil service job skill code, grade level, 
and bureau of assignment; 
(iii) contracted employees, including the 
equivalent job skill code and bureau of as-
signment; and

ERANS EMPLOYMENT AT THE DE-
PARTMENT OF STATE.

(1) the Department of State should con-
tinue to promote the employment of vet-
erans, in accordance with section 301 of the 
Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 3941), 
including those veterans belonging to tradi-
tionally under-represented groups at the De-
partment; 
(2) veterans employed by the Department 
have 
made 
significant 
contributions 
to 
United States foreign policy in a variety of 
regional and global affairs bureaus and diplo-
matic posts overseas; and 
(3) the Department should continue to en-
courage veteran employment and facilitate 
their participation in the workforce. 
SEC. 7311. EMPLOYEE ASSIGNMENT RESTRIC-
TIONS AND PRECLUSIONS. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Department of State 
should expand the appeal process it makes 
available to employees related to assignment 
preclusions and restrictions. 
(b) APPEAL OF ASSIGNMENT RESTRICTION OR 
PRECLUSION.—Subsection (a) of section 414 of 
the Department of State Authorities Act, 
Fiscal Year 2017 (22 U.S.C. 2734c(a)) is amend-
ed by adding at the end the following new 
sentences: ‘‘Such right and process shall en-
sure that any employee subjected to an as-
signment restriction or preclusion shall have 
the same appeal rights as provided by the 
Department regarding denial or revocation 
of a security clearance. Any such appeal 
shall be resolved not later than 60 days after 
such appeal is filed.’’.

eign Affairs Manual guidance regarding de-
nial or revocation of a security clearance to

restrictions by the Department of State, in-
cluding specific case studies related to 
cleared American Foreign Service and civil 
service employees of the Department that 
demonstrate 
country-specific 
restrictions 
serve a counterintelligence role beyond that 
which is already covered by the security 
clearance process. 
(2) The number of such Department em-
ployees subject to assignment restrictions 
over 
the 
previous 
year, 
with 
data

cer, civil service employee, eligible family 
member, or other employment status.

of the precluded employee. 
(C) Gender.

tion. 
(3) A description of the considerations and 
criteria used by the Bureau of Diplomatic 
Security to determine whether an assign-
ment restriction is warranted. 
(4) The number of restrictions that were 
appealed and the success rate of such ap-
peals. 
(5) The impact of assignment restrictions 
in terms of unused language skills as meas-
ured by Foreign Service Institute language 
scores of such precluded employees. 
(6) Measures taken to ensure the diversity 
of adjudicators and contracted investigators, 
with accompanying data on results. 
SEC. 7312. RECALL AND REEMPLOYMENT OF CA-
REER MEMBERS. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) career Department of State employees 
provide invaluable service to the United 
States as nonpartisan professionals who con-
tribute subject matter expertise and profes-
sional skills to the successful development 
and execution of United States foreign pol-
icy; and 
(2) reemployment of skilled former mem-
bers of the Foreign and civil service who 
have voluntarily separated from the Foreign 
or civil service due to family reasons or to 
obtain professional skills outside govern-
ment is of benefit to the Department.

2022 through 2027, the Secretary of State 
shall assess the capacity and commitment of 
foreign governments to which the United 
States provides foreign assistance under the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 
et seq.) or the Arms Export Control Act (22 
U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) to combat public corrup-
tion. Each such assessment shall— 
(1) utilize independent, third party indica-
tors that measure transparency, account-
ability, and corruption in the public sector 
in such countries, including the extent to 
which public power is exercised for private 
gain, to identify those countries that are 
most vulnerable to public corruption; 
(2) consider, to the extent reliable informa-
tion is available, whether the government of 
a country identified under paragraph (1)— 
(A) has adopted measures to prevent public 
corruption, such as measures to inform and 
educate the public, including potential vic-
tims, about the causes and consequences of 
public corruption; 
(B) has enacted laws and established gov-
ernment structures, policies, and practices 
that prohibit public corruption; 
(C) enforces such laws through a fair judi-
cial process; 
(D) vigorously investigates, prosecutes, 
convicts, and sentences public officials who 
participate in or facilitate public corruption, 
including nationals of such country who are 
deployed in foreign military assignments, 
trade delegations abroad, or other similar 
missions who engage in or facilitate public 
corruption; 
(E) prescribes appropriate punishment for 
serious and significant corruption that is 
commensurate with the punishment pre-
scribed for serious crimes; 
(F) prescribes appropriate punishment for 
significant corruption that provides a suffi-
ciently stringent deterrent and adequately 
reflects the nature of the offense; 
(G) convicts and sentences persons respon-
sible for such acts that take place wholly or 
partly within the country of such govern-
ment, including, as appropriate, requiring 
the incarceration of individuals convicted of 
such acts; 
(H) holds private sector representatives ac-
countable for their role in public corruption; 
and 
(I) addresses threats for civil society to 
monitor anti-corruption efforts;

(A) verifiable measures taken by the gov-
ernment of a country identified under para-
graph (1) to prohibit government officials 
from 
participating 
in, 
facilitating, 
or 
condoning public corruption, including the 
investigation, prosecution, and conviction of 
such officials; 
(B) the extent to which such government 
provides access, or, as appropriate, makes 
adequate resources available, to civil society 
organizations and other institutions to com-
bat public corruption, including reporting, 
investigating, and monitoring; 
(C) the extent to which an independent ju-
diciary or judicial body in such country is 
responsible for, and effectively capable of, 
deciding public corruption cases impartially, 
on the basis of facts and in accordance with 
law, without any improper restrictions, in-
fluences, inducements, pressures, threats, or 
interferences, whether direct or indirect, 
from any source or for any reason; 
(D) the extent to which such government 
cooperates meaningfully with the United 
States to strengthen government and judi-
cial institutions and the rule of law to pre-
vent, prohibit, and punish public corruption; 
and 
(E) the extent to which such government— 
(i) is assisting in international investiga-
tions of transnational public corruption net-
works and in other cooperative efforts to 
combat serious, significant corruption, in-
cluding cooperating with the governments of 
other countries to extradite corrupt actors; 
(ii) recognizes the rights of victims of pub-
lic corruption, ensures their access to jus-
tice, and takes steps to prevent such victims 
from being further victimized or persecuted 
by corrupt actors, government officials, or 
others; and 
(iii) refrains from prosecuting legitimate 
victims of public corruption or whistle-
blowers due to such persons having assisted 
in exposing public corruption, and refrains 
from other discriminatory treatment of such 
persons; and 
(4) contain such other information relating 
to public corruption as the Secretary of 
State considers appropriate.

SEC. 7004. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The majority of recent emerging infec-
tious diseases have originated in wildlife. 
(2) There is a rise in the frequency of 
zoonotic spillover events and outbreaks of 
such diseases. 
(3) This rise in such spillover events and 
outbreaks relates to the increased inter-
action between humans and wildlife. 
(4) There is a progressive and increasing 
rise in interaction between human popu-
lations and wildlife related to deforestation, 
habitat degradation, and expansion of human 
activity into the habitat of such wildlife. 
(5) The increase in such interactions due to 
these factors, particularly in forested re-
gions of tropical countries where there is 
high mammalian diversity, is a serious risk 
factor for spillover events. 
(6) A serious risk factor for spillover events 
also relates to the collection, production, 
commercial trade, and sale for human con-
sumption of wildlife that may transmit to 
zoonotic pathogens to humans that may then 
replicate and be transmitted within the 
human population. 
(7) Such a risk factor is increased if it in-
volves wildlife that— 
(A) does not ordinarily interact with hu-
mans; or 
(B) lives under a stressful condition, as 
such condition exacerbates the shedding of 
zoonotic pathogens. 
(8) Markets for such wildlife to be sold for 
human consumption are found in many coun-
tries. 
(9) In some communities, such wildlife may 
be the only accessible source of high quality 
nutrition. 
(10) The public health emergency has re-
sulted in— 
(A) trillions of dollars in economic damage 
to the United States; and 
(B) the deaths of hundreds of thousands of 
American citizens.

In title LX, add at the end the following: 
SEC. 6013. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE USE OF 
THE DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT OF 
1950 FOR GLOBAL VACCINE PRODUC-
TION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(1) As President Biden has stated, ‘‘We 
know America will never be fully safe until 
the pandemic that is raging globally is under 
control. No ocean is wide enough, no wall is 
high enough to keep us safe.’’. 
(2) More than 600,000 Americans have al-
ready died from COVID-19. Already, more 
Americans have died from COVID-19 than 
from World War I, World War II, the Vietnam 
War, and 9/11 combined. The continued rep-
lication of SARS-CoV-2 abroad increases the 
likelihood of a harmful mutation that ren-
ders current vaccines ineffective. A new vari-
ant could be more transmissible and cause 
more severe disease, posing a higher risk to 
the millions of Americans who have not been 
vaccinated, like the Delta variant. 
(3) Approximately 11 billion doses are need-
ed to vaccinate the world’s population, but 
to date, the US government has donated just 
40 million doses. More recent promises by 
the G7 would only deliver an additional one 
billion doses by the end of 2022. 
(4) Sharing manufacturing know-how and 
expertise is critical to quickly ramping up 
production. Expanding the world’s manufac-
turing capacity is critical because donations 
and bilateral agreements to increase vaccine 
doses in low- and middle-income countries 
cannot quickly meet the global demand. 
(5) The U.S. Government, as the largest 
coronavirus 
research 
and 
development 
funder in the world, is uniquely positioned to 
push companies to share the knowledge re-
quired to end the pandemic. 
(6) Manufacturers around the world have 
affirmed that they can help ramp up produc-
tion if they have access to technology. Ac-
cording to the World Health Organization, 19 
manufacturers from more than a dozen coun-
tries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America have 
expressed interest in ramping up mRNA vac-
cine production. The Biden administration 
has also urged companies to share tech-
nology. But vaccine originator corporations 
have been reluctant to share technology. 
(7) The Defense Production Act of 1950 pro-
vides the President with broad authority to 
support the nation’s defense. The Defense 
Production Act of 1950’s definition of ‘‘na-
tional defense’’ includes ‘‘military or critical 
infrastructure assistance to any foreign na-
tion’’. 
(8) The Defense Production Act of 1950 em-
powers the President to directly ‘‘allocate 
materials, services, and facilities’’ to pro-
mote national defense needs. The Act defines 
‘‘materials’’ to include ‘‘any technical infor-
mation or services ancillary to the use of 
any such materials’’. 
(9) The Defense Production Act of 1950 has 
been used repeatedly to prioritize contracts 
and orders from U.S. companies to foreign 
nations. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the President should make full 
use of the President’s authority under the 
Defense Production Act of 1950 to scale vac-
cine production and deployment globally, 
which will save millions of lives and protect 
Americans from the risk of emerging viral 
threats. 
AMENDMENT NO. 350 OFFERED BY MR. QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS 
TITLE LIV—PREVENTING FUTURE 
PANDEMICS 
SEC. 5401. WILDLIFE MARKET DEFINED. 
In this Act, the term ‘‘wildlife market’’— 
(1) means a commercial market that— 
(A) sells or slaughters terrestrial, includ-
ing avian, wildlife for human consumption as 
food or medicine, whether the animals origi-
nated in the wild or in a captive environ-
ment; and 
(B) delivers a product in communities 
where alternative nutritional or protein 
sources are available; and 
(2) does not include markets in areas where 
no other practical alternative sources of pro-
tein or meat exists, such as wildlife markets 
in rural areas on which indigenous people 
rely to feed themselves and their families. 
SEC. 5402. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that global institutions, including 
the Food and Agriculture Organization of 
the 
United 
Nations 
(FAO), 
the 
World 
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and 
the World Health Organization (WHO), to-
gether with leading nongovernmental orga-
nizations, 
veterinary 
colleges, 
and 
the 
United States Agency for International De-
velopment (USAID), should promote the par-
adigm of One Health—the integration of 
human health, animal health, agriculture, 
ecosystems, and the environment as an effec-
tive and integrated way to address the com-
plexity of emerging disease threats. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States to facilitate inter-
national cooperation by working with inter-
national partners and through intergovern-
mental, international, and nongovernmental 
organizations such as the United Nations 
to— 
(1) lead a resolution at the United Nations 
Security Council or General Assembly and 
World Health Assembly outlining the danger 
to human and animal health from emerging 
zoonotic 
infectious 
diseases, 
with 
rec-
ommendations for implementing the world-
wide closure of wildlife markets and the end-
ing of the associated commercial trade of 
terrestrial wildlife that feed and supply 
those markets, except for in such countries 
or regions where the consumption of wildlife 
is necessary for local food security or where 
such actions would significantly disrupt a 
readily available and irreplaceable food sup-
ply; 
(2) work with governments through exist-
ing treaties and the United Nations to de-
velop a new protocol or agreement, and 
amend existing protocols or agreements, re-
garding stopping deforestation and other 
ecosystem destruction, closing commercial 
wildlife markets for human consumption, 
and end the associated commercial trade of 
terrestrial wildlife that feed and supply 
those markets while ensuring full consider-
ation to the needs and rights of indigenous 
peoples and local communities that are de-
pendent on wildlife for their food security, 
national sovereignty, and local laws and cus-
toms; 
(3) disrupt and ultimately end the commer-
cial international trade in terrestrial wild-
life associated with wildlife markets and 
eliminate commercial wildlife markets; 
(4) disrupt and ultimately eliminate wild-
life trafficking associated with the operation 
of wildlife markets; 
(5) raise awareness on the dangerous poten-
tial of wildlife markets as a source of 
zoonotic 
diseases 
such 
as 
the 
novel 
coronavirus that causes the disease COVID– 
19 and reduce demand for the consumption of 
wildlife through evidence-based behavior 
change programs while ensuring that exist-
ing wildlife habitat is not encroached upon 
or destroyed as part of this process; 
(6) encourage and support alternate forms 
of food production, farming, and shifts to do-
mestic animal- or plant-source foods instead 
of terrestrial wildlife where able and appro-
priate, and reduce consumer demand for ter-
restrial wildlife through enhanced local and 
national food systems, especially in areas

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tleman from Washington (Mr. SMITH) 
and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
ROGERS) each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Washington. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ). 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce four amend-
ments to protect the human rights of 
the Colombian and Saudi people. 
Earlier this year in Colombia in the 
middle of the pandemic, President 
Duque proposed crushing new sales 
taxes on basic food items. 
When the Colombian people dem-
onstrated in protest, the government 
responded with brutality. Sixty-eight 
people were murdered, and over 1,100 
protestors and bystanders were injured. 
This is part of a pattern of human 
rights violations by President Duque. 
He is also planning to resume aerial fu-
migation, 
which 
most 
countries 
stopped using when devastating health 
impacts were discovered. 
Our amendments would require the 
Department of State and Defense to 
issue a report on the State of human 
rights in Colombia. They would also 
limit the U.S. transfer of weapons to 
the police unit responsible for many of 
the demonstrators’ murders. And fi-
nally, they would prohibit U.S. funds 
from being used to support aerial fumi-
gation. 
Similarly, in 2018 we stood horrified 
by the Saudi government’s assassina-
tion of journalist Jamal Khashoggi for 
speaking 
up 
against 
the 
regime’s 
human rights abuses. 
Our amendment would prohibit funds 
from being used to provide weapons, 
military aid, or military training to 
the unit that carried out his assassina-
tion. 
The U.S. has long supported abusive 
regimes in South America and the Mid-
dle East to serve our own interests, yet 
we seem somehow shocked and con-
fused when refugees from these regions 
show up at our borders seeking asylum 
from the inhumane conditions that we 
helped create in their homelands. 
It is now beyond time for us to rec-
tify these wrongs, and I submit this 
amendment. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from West Virginia (Mrs. MIL-
LER), an outstanding member of the 
Ways and Means Committee. 
Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of this bill 
and my four amendments. 
The first amendment will require a 
report on the status of women in Af-
ghanistan. The rights we fought to se-
cure for them are in dire peril. 
The second will hold the administra-
tion accountable by requesting a report 
on the amount of money and materials 
left behind in Afghanistan. 
The third blocks any funding for in-
telligence sharing and ensures no tax-
payer dollars are wasted working with 
the Taliban. They proved that they 
can’t be trusted by the deadly events 
at the airport. 
The final amendment will establish a 
memorial for the 13 servicemembers 
who perished securing the airport. 
They 
lost 
their 
lives 
protecting 
Americans and our allies. This memo-
rial would ensure that they are never 
forgotten for their sacrifice. 
I urge adoption of all four of my 
amendments. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers at

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5032 
September 22, 2021 
this time, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN), my 
friend and colleague, and also the rank-
ing member of the Natural Resources 
Committee. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for the hard work that went into pre-
paring this NDAA. 
I rise today in support of one amend-
ment in particular included in this en 
bloc package, which would add the bi-
partisan Alexander Lofgren Veterans 
and Parks Act or the VIP Act to the 
bill. 
The VIP Act would provide free life-
time passes to our national parks and 
public lands for veterans and Gold Star 
family members and free annual passes 
for active duty military members. 
I am a proud cosponsor of both the 
amendment and identical legislation 
which passed the House earlier this 
year with an amazing 420 in favor to 
zero against vote with over 150 bipar-
tisan cosponsors. Senator SINEMA and 
Senator BOOZMAN from my home State 
of Arkansas are leading the bipartisan 
Senate companion of this legislation. 
In addition to its broad support here 
in Congress, the VIP Act has also been 
endorsed by over 60 organizations rep-
resenting a diverse coalition of con-
servation, recreation, and veterans’ 
groups. 
In just the past month, as we have 
watched the horrible situation unfold-
ing in Afghanistan, the country has 
awoken again to the sacrifice and her-
oism displayed by our brave men and 
women in uniform. These men and 
women often return home carrying 
both visible and invisible wounds from 
their time in combat. 
During the Biden administration’s 
botched evacuation of Afghanistan, the 
VA’s crisis hotline had a 9 percent up-
tick in calls. Despite the fact that sui-
cide rates among veterans were the 
lowest in 12 years, an average of 17 vet-
erans per day still died by suicide in 
2019. 
That is what makes this amendment 
so vital now more than ever. Our out-
doors can be a place of healing and 
hope for our veterans, particularly 
wounded or paralyzed veterans who 
turn to nature for solace and comfort. 
Financial barriers should not be a 
factor for our veterans as they try to 
access the majestic and iconic parts of 
our country that they fought so hard 
to defend. Our veterans, active duty 
military, and Gold Star families de-
serve permanent, free access that can 
never be taken away from them. 
While we can never fully repay the 
debt we owe to our veterans and Gold 
Star families, this amendment is a 
small gesture to symbolize their sac-
rifices were not in vain, and that they 
we will never forget their bravery and 
heroism. 
That is why I am also a strong sup-
porter of an amendment that passed in 
an earlier en bloc passage to locate the 
Global War on Terrorism Memorial on 
the National Mall here in Washington, 
D.C. 
Our Nation’s patriots who selflessly 
fought to defend this Nation in the 
wake of terror attacks against our 
homeland deserve nothing less than a 
lasting tribute in our Nation’s capitol 
in a place of prominence on the Na-
tional Mall. 
I strongly support the amendment 
and would urge the eventual NDAA 
conferees to ensure it stays in the final 
text and will fight to make sure that it 
does. 
Before I conclude, I would be remiss 
if I didn’t mention several wildfire-re-
lated amendments. 
I believe that better pay and benefits 
for our wildland firefighters is both 
well-deserved and well-earned, but we 
must address both the short- and long- 
term issues facing our firefighters and 
Federal lands; which means addressing 
the catastrophic forest health crisis 
through better management. 
Nearly six million acres have burned 
this year, and States like California 
and Oregon saw some of the largest 
fires in their State’s history. Fire sea-
sons are getting longer and more in-
tense because of our lack of forest 
management, which in turn puts a 
heavy physical, mental, and emotional 
strain on our wildland firefighters. 
I would like to extend an invitation 
to my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle to work on this issue together 
so that we stop putting our firefighters 
in impossible situations year after 
year. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
Miller-Meeks, Gallego, Westerman, and 
Grijalva amendment. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE), 
one of our great new freshman mem-
bers of the Republican Conference. 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this en bloc, which 
includes my friend and colleague Rep-
resentative 
DEAN
PHILLIPS’ 
amend-
ment, which directs the Secretary of 
Defense to submit a report on the ef-
fects of the Department of Defense’s 
Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certifi-
cation framework on small business. 
Recognizing the increased cyber vul-
nerabilities of small contractors, the 
DOD initiated a new cybersecurity as-
sessment framework called the Cyber-
security Maturity Model Certification 
to assess contractor implementation of 
cybersecurity requirements. 
While no one disputes the Federal 
Government’s need to address the 
growing cybersecurity risks facing our 
Nation, I am concerned that the CMMC 
has created another hurdle to keep 
small businesses from competing effec-
tively in the defense marketplace. 
There is no question our military re-
lies heavily on the many small busi-
nesses that make up our defense con-
tracting network, and their voices 
should be heard throughout this proc-
ess. 
Strong national security and cyber-
security in a thriving defense indus-
trial base shouldn’t be mutually exclu-
sively goals, and I hope this amend-
ment will set a clear path forward for 
our smaller contractors. 
I would also like to rise today in sup-
port of the following amendments en 
bloc, which includes my supply chain- 
focused amendment that I was proud to 
introduce with my main colleague, Mr. 
GOLDEN. 
Now, more than ever, we must ensure 
our supply chains are protected, and 
with every business I meet, I continue 
to hear how they are experiencing 
firsthand impacts of supply chain dis-
ruptions due to COVID–19. And to pre-
vent further disruptions, we must act 
now to identify vulnerabilities. Pro-
tecting our supply chain is more than 
just business, it is a matter now of na-
tional security. 
My amendment will begin this proc-
ess by directing the DNI and the CIA to 
identify those critical supply chains to 
our national security, economic secu-
rity, and public health, as well as rec-
ommend necessary actions. 
It is my goal, along with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, that 
this amendment will prevent another 
grave supply chain crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of these 
two amendments. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY), an 
outstanding member of the Republican 
Conference and a retired general offi-
cer. 
b 1815 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman and appreciate the op-
portunity to introduce this amendment 
combating illegal CCP dictates in the 
South China Sea. 
Mr. Speaker, on September 1, China’s 
Maritime 
Security 
Administration 
began to demand that foreign ships re-
port specific vessel information before 
entering the CCP’s imagined maritime 
claims. 
This information includes the fol-
lowing: the name and number; the sat-
ellite telephone number; the position 
and recent locations; and cargo. 
Vessels needing to provide this infor-
mation include submersibles, nuclear 
vessels, ships carrying radioactive ma-
terials, as well as any vessel the CCP 
deems to be a threat, which is, natu-
rally, purposefully vague. 
Now, what this is is the Chinese Com-
munist Party literally drew a line in 
the South China Sea and said: You 
come across it, even though you are in 
international waters, you have to do 
this. 
No, we don’t have to do this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5033 
September 22, 2021 
The United States has repeatedly 
said we reject all maritime claims 
made by China within the so-called 
nine-dash line, the 10-dash line, or the 
11-dash line, or whatever they want to 
call it, at any time, as virtually all of 
those claims are both imagined and il-
legal. This position was prominently 
reinforced by former Secretary Pompeo 
on July 13, 2020. 
Fortunately, it appears to be the case 
that the administration agrees with 
this assessment. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
amendment to push back against Chi-
na’s lawless activity in the South 
China Sea. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this en bloc was put to-
gether in close consultation by the ma-
jority with the minority. I urge all 
Members to support it, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I concur in the remarks of the 
ranking member. I urge support for the 
en bloc, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the Chair for his support of my 
amendment. 
This amendment is based on legislation I 
have introduced previously, the Corey Adams 
Searchlight Act. 
I want to talk about why this amendment is 
so important. 
It is about helping services members who 
have been heroes and have given so much for 
our safety. 
The bill is named after my constituent, 
Corey Adams. 
Corey always wanted to serve his country 
and follow in his fathers and grandfathers’ 
footsteps and join the Air Force after high 
school. 
Corey served 4 years on active duty, then 
joined the Air Force Reserve. 
Sergeant Corey also served six months in 
Afghanistan in 2009. 
Sergeant Corey Adams was later diagnosed 
with Post traumatic stress disorder and later 
moved into his parent’s home in Milwaukee, 
WI. 
On March 20, 2017 the Adams family was 
changed forever. 
Segreant Corey Adams was missing. 
His family tried to file a missing persons re-
port soon after he went missing, 
It took eight days before the police deter-
mined he met the critical missing persons cri-
teria, a crucial delay. 18 days after his dis-
appearance, Corey Adams’ body was recov-
ered from Dineen Park, one mile from his 
mother’s home. 
No family should have to suffer a tragedy 
like this. This Sunday would have been 
Corey’s 50th birthday. 
In the aftermath of this tragedy, Wisconsin 
became the first state to enact a green alert 
system to find veterans who are reported 
missing. Delaware, Tennessee, and Texas 
have since enacted laws to do so, and other 
states are currently looking to do the same. 
When a Veteran goes missing, we should 
ensure that we have their 6. 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, my amendment 
No. 363, which is included in En Bloc 3, en-
sures the 1,700 small businesses in my district 
can access financing through the Small Busi-
ness Administration’s micro loan program. 
The program is targeted specially to help 
women, low-income, veteran, and minority en-
trepreneurs. 
The Marianas is the only place in the U.S. 
not included in the program, which provides 
loans, typically not offered by banks, of up to 
$50,000. 
My bipartisan amendment would correct that 
by ensuring access to microloans on the same 
basis as their counterparts across the nation. 
I 
thank 
Representatives 
GARBARINO, 
KAHELE, and RADEWAGEN for their cosponsor-
ship of the amendment. 
I ask my colleagues to support En Bloc 3. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CASTEN). Pursuant to House Resolution 
667, the previous question is ordered on 
the amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman 
from

SMITH).

AMENDMENT NO. 366 OFFERED BY MR. SAN 
NICOLAS OF GUAM 
In title LI of division E, after section 5105, 
insert the following: 
SEC. 5106. INCLUDING OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS 
AND TERRITORIES IN THE HIGH- 
RISK MONEY LAUNDERING AND RE-
LATED FINANCIAL CRIME AREAS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(1) According to the Department of Jus-
tice, human trafficking is ‘‘a crime that in-
volves exploiting a person for labor, services, 
or commercial sex’’, a global illicit trade 
that is estimated by Global Financial Integ-
rity to be valued at more than $150.2 billion 
each year. 
(2) Polaris, the non-governmental organi-
zation which runs the United States Na-
tional Human Trafficking Hotline, has found 
that while human trafficking is a nationwide 
problem, the majority of domestic human 
trafficking victims are ‘‘people who have his-
torically faced discrimination and its polit-
ical, social and economic consequences: peo-
ple of color, indigenous communities, immi-
grants and people who identify as LGBTQ+’’. 
(3) For this reason, it is important that law 
enforcement representing native commu-
nities and territories are part of the national 
dialogue 
about 
countering 
human 
traf-
ficking. 
(4) The High Intensity Financial Crime 
Areas program, which is intended to con-
centrate law enforcement efforts at the Fed-
eral, State, and local level to combat money 
laundering 
in 
designated 
high-intensity 
money laundering zones, considers human 
trafficking among other financial crime 
issues and actors. 
(5) In each High Intensity Financial Crime 
Area, a money-laundering action team, com-
prised of relevant Federal, State, and local 
enforcement authorities, prosecutors, and fi-
nancial regulators, works together to coordi-
nate Federal, State, and local anti-money 
laundering effort. 
(6) The High Intensity Financial Crime 
Area program does not currently mandate 
the inclusion of law enforcement and other 
agencies from Tribes and territories. 
(7) Further, the National Strategy for 
Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Fi-
nancing, a valuable report which is sched-
uled to sunset in January 2022, does not cur-
rently mandate the inclusion of law enforce-
ment and other agencies from Tribes and 
Territories. 
(b) NATIONAL
STRATEGY
FOR
COMBATING 
TERRORIST
AND OTHER ILLICIT FINANCING.— 
The Countering Russian Influence in Europe 
and Eurasia Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 9501 et seq.)

Illicit Financing’ and ‘2022 National Strategy 
for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit Fi-
nancing’ ’’; and 
(ii) by striking ‘‘the broader counter ter-
rorism strategy of the United States’’ and 
inserting ‘‘the broader counter terrorism and 
national security strategies of the United 
States’’;

NANCE’’ and inserting ‘‘PREVENTION, DETEC-
TION, AND DEFEAT OF ILLICIT FINANCE’’; 
(ii) by striking ‘‘private financial sector’’

nancial and other relevant industries,’’; and 
(iii) by striking ‘‘with regard to the pre-
vention and detection of illicit finance’’ and 
inserting ‘‘with regard to the prevention, de-
tection, and defeat of illicit finance’’;

officials’’ and inserting ‘‘Federal, State, 
local, Tribal, and Territory officials’’; and 
(ii) by inserting after ‘‘State and local 
prosecutors,’’ the following: ‘‘Tribal and Ter-

SEC. ll. OBSERVANCE OF NATIONAL ATOMIC 
VETERANS DAY. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the Sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States should annually ob-
serve Atomic Veterans Day to recognize 
American military service members who par-
ticipated in nuclear tests between 1945 and 
1962, served with United States military 
forces in or around Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
through mid-1946, or were held as prisoners 
of war in or near Hiroshima or Nagasaki; 
(2) the people of the United States should 
recognize and remember the contributions of 
America’s Atomic Veterans for their sac-
rifice and dedication to our Nation’s secu-
rity, and recommit themselves to supporting 
our Atomic Veterans and educating them-
selves on the role these patriots played in 
our national story; and 
(3) President Reagan and President Biden 
took important steps to recognize Atomic 
Veterans by proclaiming July 16, 1983, and 
July 16, 2021, respectively, as National Atom-
ic Veterans Day, reflective of the fact that 
July 16 is the anniversary of Trinity, the

AMENDMENT NO. 406 OFFERED BY MS. 
SPANBERGER OF VIRGINIA 
At the end of subtitle G of title X insert 
the following: 
SEC. 10ll. ANOMALOUS HEALTH INCIDENTS 
INTERAGENCY COORDINATOR. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Since at least 2016, United States Gov-
ernment personnel and their family members 
have reported anomalous health incidents at 
diplomatic missions across the world and in 
the United States, which are sometimes re-
ferred to as ‘‘Havana Syndrome’’. 
(2) Some of the anomalous health incidents 
have resulted in unexplained brain injuries, 
which have had permanent, life-altering ef-
fects that have disrupted lives and ended ca-
reers. 
(3) A panel of experts convened by the Bu-
reau of Medical Services of the Department 
of State in July 2017 to review triage assess-
ments of medically evaluated personnel from 
the United States Embassy in Havana came 
to a consensus that the findings were most 
likely related to neurotrauma from a non-
natural source. 
(4) A 2020 report by the National Academy 
of Sciences found that ‘‘many of the distinc-
tive and acute signs, symptoms, and observa-
tions reported by [affected] employees are 
consistent with the effects of directed, 
pulsed radio frequency (RF) energy’’ and 
that ‘‘directed pulsed RF energy [...] appears 
to be the most plausible mechanism in ex-
plaining these cases’’. 
(5) According to the National Academy of 
Sciences report, ‘‘such a scenario raises 
grave 
concerns 
about 
a 
world 
with 
disinhibited malevolent actors and new tools 
for causing harm to others’’. 
(6) The number and locations of these sus-
pected attacks have expanded and, according 
to press reporting, there have been more 
than 130 possible cases that have been re-
ported by United States personnel in Asia, in 
Europe, and in the Western Hemisphere, in-
cluding within the United States. 
(7) The continuing and expanding scope of 
these suspected attacks is impacting the se-
curity and morale of United States per-
sonnel, especially those posted overseas. 
(8) The Convention on the Prevention and 
Punishment of Crimes against Internation-
ally Protected Persons (including diplomatic 
agents) to which 180 countries are a party, 
protects diplomatic personnel from attacks 
on their persons, accommodations, or means 
of transport, and requires all state parties to 
punish and take measures to prevent such 
grave crimes. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the threat to United States Government 
personnel from suspected attacks presenting 
as anomalous health incidents is a matter of 
urgent concern and deserving of the full at-
tention of government; 
(2) personnel, dependents, and other appro-
priate 
individuals 
suffering 
anomalous 
health incidents from these suspected at-
tacks deserve equitable, accessible, and high- 
quality medical assessment and care, regard-
less of their employing Government agency; 
(3) diagnoses and determinations to treat 
personnel, dependents, and other appropriate 
individuals 
experiencing 
symptoms 
con-
sistent with such injuries should be made by 
experienced medical professionals and made 
available by the Federal Government; 
(4) any recriminations, retaliation, or pun-
ishment associated with personnel self-re-
porting 
symptoms 
is 
unacceptable 
and 
should be investigated by internal agency 
oversight mechanisms; 
(5) information sharing and interagency 
coordination is essential for the comprehen-
sive investigation, attribution, and mitiga-
tion of these injuries; 
(6) the Administration should provide Con-
gress and the public with timely and regular 
unclassified updates on the threat posed to 
United States Government personnel by the 
suspected causes of these injuries; 
(7) recent efforts by the Administration 
and among relevant agencies represent posi-
tive steps toward responding to the threat of 
anomalous health incidents, but more com-
prehensive measures must be taken to fur-
ther assist victims, investigate and deter-
mine the cause of the injuries of such vic-
tims, and prevent future incidents; 
(8) establishing the source and cause of 
these anomalous health incidents must be a 
top priority for the United States Govern-
ment and requires the full coordination of 
relevant agencies; 
(9) if investigations determine that the 
anomalous health incidents are the result of 
deliberate acts by individuals, entities, or 
foreign countries, the United States Govern-
ment should recognize and respond to these 
incidents as hostile attacks; and 
(10) any actors found to have been tar-
geting United States Government personnel 
should be publicly identified, as appropriate, 
and held accountable. 
(c) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States— 
(1) to detect, deter, and punish any clan-
destine attacks that cause persistent inju-
ries to United States personnel; 
(2) to provide appropriate assistance to 
United States personnel harmed by such at-
tacks; 
(3) to hold responsible any persons, enti-
ties, or governments involved in ordering or

threat to homeland security. 
‘‘(2) REQUIREMENTS.— 
‘‘(A) RISK ANALYSIS OF CRITICAL DOMAINS.— 
The research under paragraph (1) shall in-
clude a risk analysis of each identified 
United States critical domain for economic 
security to determine the degree to which 
there exists a present or future threat to 
homeland security in the event of disruption, 
corruption, exploitation, or dysfunction to 
such domain. Such research shall consider, 
to the extent possible, the following: 
‘‘(i) The vulnerability and resilience of rel-
evant supply chains. 
‘‘(ii) Foreign production, processing, and 
manufacturing methods. 
‘‘(iii) Influence of malign economic actors.

corruption, exploitation, or dysfunction to 
such a domain. For each such high-risk do-
main, or element thereof, such research 
shall— 
‘‘(i) describe the underlying infrastructure 
and processes; 
‘‘(ii) analyze present and projected per-
formance of industries that comprise or sup-
port such domain; 
‘‘(iii) examine the extent to which the sup-
ply chain of a product or service necessary to 
such domain is concentrated, either through 
a small number of sources, or if multiple 
sources are concentrated in one geographic 
area; 
‘‘(iv) examine the extent to which the de-
mand for supplies of goods and services of 
such industries can be fulfilled by present 
and projected performance of other indus-
tries, identify strategies, plans, and poten-
tial barriers to expand the supplier indus-
trial base, and identify the barriers to the 
participation of such other industries; 
‘‘(v) consider each such domain’s perform-
ance capacities in stable economic environ-
ments, adversarial supply conditions, and 
under crisis economic constraints; 
‘‘(vi) identify and define needs and require-
ments to establish supply resiliency within 
each such domain; and 
‘‘(vii) consider the effects of sector consoli-
dation, including foreign consolidation, ei-
ther through mergers or acquisitions, or due

AMENDMENT NO. 436 OFFERED BY MRS. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
At the end of title XIII of division A, add 
the following: 
Subtitle D—Central American Women and 
Children Protection Act of 2021 
SEC. 1331. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Central 
American Women and Children Protection 
Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1332. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The Northern Triangle countries of El 
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have 
among the highest homicide rates in the 
world. In 2020, there were— 
(A) 19.7 homicides per 100,000 people in El 
Salvador; 
(B) 15.4 homicides per 100,000 people in Gua-
temala; and 
(C) 37.6 homicides per 100,000 people in Hon-
duras. 
(2) El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras 
are characterized by a high prevalence of 
drug- and gang-related violence, murder, and 
crimes involving sexual- and gender-based 
violence against women and children, includ-
ing domestic violence, child abuse, and sex-
ual assault. 
(3) In 2019, El Salvador, Guatemala, and 
Honduras were all listed among the 7 coun-
tries in the Latin America and Caribbean re-
gion with the highest rates of femicides (the 
intentional killing of women or girls because 
of their gender). In 2019— 
(A) 113 women in El Salvador were victims 
of femicide; 
(B) 160 women in Guatemala were victims 
of femicide; and 
(C) 299 women in Honduras were victims of 
femicide or violent homicide. 
(4) In 2015, El Salvador and Honduras were 
among the top 3 countries in the world with 
the highest child homicides rates, with more 
than 22 and 32 deaths per 100,000 children, re-
spectively, according to the nongovern-
mental organization Save the Children. 
(5) Thousands of women, children, and fam-
ilies from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Hon-
duras fled unsafe homes and communities in 
2019. 
(6) Violent crimes against women and chil-
dren are generally assumed to be substan-
tially under-reported because the majority 
of victims lack safe access to protection and 
justice. 
(7) Impunity for perpetrators of violence 
against women is rampant in El Salvador, 
Guatemala, and Honduras. There was a 5 per-
cent conviction rate for violence against 
women in El Salvador in 2016 and 2017. The 
impunity level for violence against women in 
Guatemala was 97.05 percent in 2018. In 2018, 
there was an impunity rate of 95 percent for 
violence against women in Honduras. 
(8) According to a study conducted by the 
Woodrow Wilson International Center for 
Scholars— 
(A) childhood experiences with domestic 
violence in Latin America are a major risk 
factor for future criminal behavior; and 
(B) 56 percent of incarcerated women and 
59 percent of incarcerated men surveyed ex-
perienced 
intra-familial 
violence 
during 
childhood.

an outstanding member of our Con-
ference. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of two of my amend-
ments that are included in this en bloc. 
Amendment No. 333 authorizes a 
long-overdue China watcher program 
within the Department of State. This 
program aims to monitor and combat 
Chinese malign influence across eco-
nomic and political sectors in certain 
high-priority countries. 
The People’s Republic of China is 
challenging the United States at mul-
tiple levels and remains a threat to our 
vitally important interests across the 
globe. The threats posed by the PRC 
demand greater resources, which is ex-
actly what this amendment delivers. 
My second amendment, No. 343, es-
tablishes a program for the Depart-
ment of the Air Force to develop a 
proof-of-concept 
quantum 
network 
testbed. This will support the incred-
ible work the Air Force is doing around 
the country, including the information 
directorate in Rome, New York, which 
is in the heart of my district in New 
York. 
The establishment of this program 
will deepen the military’s expertise in 
cutting-edge quantum computing. It 
will enable the United States to com-
pete globally with our adversaries, 
dominate the virtual battlespace, and 
counter emerging threats. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
SMITH and Ranking Member ROGERS 
for the work they put into shepherding 
this bill through Congress and reject-
ing partisan cuts to our Nation’s mili-
tary that were proposed by the admin-
istration. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this en bloc. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL). 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the time of the gentleman. 
Mr. Speaker, the mishandled evacu-
ation from Afghanistan was a tragic 
disaster. The fundamental misunder-
standing 
of 
the 
situation 
on 
the 
ground, a faulty plan for withdrawal, 
and poor strategic decisionmaking in 
Washington put our troops in harm’s 
way, leading to the abandonment of 
American citizens and the deaths of 13 
brave American servicemembers, in-
cluding critical injuries to two marines 
from the First Congressional District 
of Wisconsin. 
My amendments to the national de-
fense bill are directed at getting an-
swers for our troops and the American 
people, and I ask my colleagues for 
their support. 
My first amendment would require 
the Treasury Department to report to 
Congress on the current status of the 
U.S. and U.N. sanctions on the Taliban. 
We must look at the current gaps in 
our sanctions and ensure that the 
Taliban is not able to finance their 
takeover by profiting from the drug 
trade and rare earth minerals. 
My second amendment would require 
the Treasury Department to regularly 
report to Congress on any sanctions 
waivers provided to allow transactions 
between financial institutions and tar-
geted individuals. 
In addition, my amendment requires 
the Treasury Department to list out 
foreign banks that conduct significant 
transactions for persons that have been 
sanctioned for human rights abuses or 
corruption. 
My third amendment will hold Iran 
accountable. 
Iran 
has 
been 
emboldened. At a time when this ad-
ministration is signaling that they in-
tend to remove sanctions with Iran, we 
must ensure U.S. sanctions are en-
forced to prevent the world’s largest 
state sponsor of terrorism from obtain-
ing a nuclear weapon. 
Congress must understand the full 
nature of Iran’s power and undertake a 
full audit of how Iranian-backed groups 
in 
the 
Iraqi 
Popular 
Mobilization 
Forces took advantage of U.S. assist-
ance given to the Iraqi Government in 
the anti-ISIS campaign. 
Finally, I introduced an amendment 
with my colleague, Congresswoman 
DEAN. Our bill improves intelligence 
coordination to combat the illicit fi-
nancing of human trafficking. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support these amendments. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this amendment, and I 
thank the gentleman from Alabama for 
the time. 
The amendment I speak of comes 
after many years of experiencing well- 
documented U.S. Navy maintenance 
backlogs and deficiencies and much- 
needed naval upgrades. These backlogs 
and deficiencies seriously inhibit our 
force-in-readiness and operational ca-
pabilities. 
Our military needs to be the readiest 
it can be in order to meet the chal-
lenges of the future, and this amend-
ment will help do that. 
Shipyards across the country are 
ready, willing, and able to support the 
maintenance and upgrade requirements 
needed by our naval assets, including 
one in Superior, Wisconsin, in my con-
gressional district. 
These non-homeport shipyards can 
support vital surge capacity, address-
ing maintenance needs that cannot al-
ways be addressed in a timely fashion 
at homeports. This change will also 
support good family-wage jobs across 
the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased to 
have 
worked 
with 
Representative 
STAUBER just across the border on this 
amendment. It is so important. By uti-
lizing those people who work in the 
twin ports of Superior and Duluth, 
with their exceptional workmanship 
that they provide for shipbuilding on 
the Great Lakes, I think this makes 
this amendment very worthy. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE), my 
friend and colleague and a real leader 
on the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Alabama for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to express con-
cerns with the Thompson amendment 
No. 427. The amendment requires the 
Department of Homeland Security, 
DHS, to establish a medical counter-
measures program for preparedness and 
response capabilities. It also requires 
DHS to maintain and pre-position a 
stockpile of medical countermeasures. 
After dealing with the ongoing pan-
demic for the past year and a half, we 
can all appreciate the necessity of 
being prepared to deal with these 
threats. However, this new program is 
completely duplicative of existing ini-
tiatives at HHS. 
Currently, under HHS, the Strategic 
National Stockpile, or SNS, is part of 
the Federal medical response infra-
structure for such attacks. The Public 
Health Emergency Medical Counter-
measures Enterprise determines opti-
mal allocation of resources and organi-
zation of the stockpile to best address 
high-priority threats. 
This interagency coordination al-
ready includes the input of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security and coordi-
nates Federal efforts to combat these 
threats. While I do believe we should 
evaluate our country’s pandemic re-
sponse given the COVID–19 pandemic, 
we do not need to create a duplicative 
program that will only lead to confu-
sion and hinder coordination. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1830 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I want to state 
this en bloc package was reached in 
close coordination between the major-
ity and minority. I urge its favorable 
support, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Washington. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I also support the en bloc. 
This will be the last chance for me to 
speak before we conclude the amend-
ment process, so I do just want to 
make a final pitch for the underlying 
piece of legislation. 
I think the amendment process has 
gone just fine. The underlying bill is 
incredibly well put together in the 
manner we have described, has bipar-
tisan support, reflects a lot of the ideas 
and priorities of Members of Congress 
from both sides of the aisle as well, and 
from even outside the committee.

September 22, 2021 
I think we have an excellent piece of 
legislation that will help meet the na-
tional security needs of our country, 
and I urge support for the bill in the 
final passage process, which will hap-
pen at some point tomorrow after we 
vote on, I don’t know, 18–20 amend-
ments, something like that. We will be 
here awhile. 
Don’t forget what brought us here in 
the first place. The need to pass the 
National Defense Authorization Act 
and maintain our commitment to put 
the men and women who serve in the 
military in the best possible position 
to carry out the missions that we give 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for final 
passage of the bill and urge support for 
this en bloc amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, in 
the spirit of transparency and accountability 
my amendment directs the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) to probe whether the 
Department of Defense ever weaponized ticks 
with Lyme disease or any other dangerous 
pathogen. 
Two similar amendments I have offered— 
one for an investigation by the Inspector Gen-
eral and another by the GAO—previously 
passed the House but did not make it through 
the Senate. I offer it again as the investigation 
and research may help uncover decades-old 
information and possibly provide some an-
swers for those that suffer from Lyme. Ameri-
cans deserve the truth. 
For years, books and articles have been 
written credibly asserting that significant re-
search at Fort Detrick, Plum Island, and else-
where was conducted to turn ticks into bio-
weapons. 
In her book, ‘‘Bitten: The Secret History of 
Lyme Disease and Biological Weapons,’’ Kris 
Newby includes interviews with Dr. Willy 
Burgdorfer, the researcher who is credited 
with discovering Lyme disease. It turns out 
that Dr. Burgdorfer was a bioweapons spe-
cialist. The interviews, combined with access 
to Dr. Burgdorfer’s files, reveal that he and 
other bioweapons specialists stuffed ticks with 
pathogens in a quest to cause severe dis-
ability, disease, and death. 
Mr. Speaker, Lyme disease and other tick- 
borne diseases are exploding in the United 
States. According to the December 2020 re-
port of the Health & Human Services’ Tick- 
Borne Disease Working Group—a federal ad-
visory committee created by language in-
cluded in the 21st Century Cures Act, which I 
fought for—Lyme disease is the most common 
tick-borne disease with an estimated 300,000 
new cases diagnosed each year. A figure that 
many researchers, and Lyme-literate doctors, 
believe is underreported and could be up-
wards of 476,000 cases each year. 
I also might add that this threat is very real 
for our servicemembers as they train in the 
field, especially at Fort Dix in my district where 
the geographic area has an increased preva-
lence of Lyme. To stop the spread of these 
horrific tickborne diseases, we must first un-
derstand their origins and how they came to 
be so pervasive. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment tasks the GAO 
to ask the hard questions about DOD’s bio-
weapons research on ticks from 1950 to 1977. 
What were the parameters of the program if 
there was one? Who ordered it? Was there 
any accidental release anywhere or at any 
time of any of the diseased ticks? And the 
most important question, can any of this infor-
mation that might be derived from that study, 
that audit, help current day researchers find a 
way to mitigate these diseases? 
10 to 20 percent of Americans with Lyme 
suffer with chronic Lyme disease. They have 
a right to know whether any of this is true, and 
if any old research documents could be ap-
plied by current-day scientists to finding a bet-
ter diagnostic or treatment for Lyme disease— 
something that’s desperately needed. 
If the investigation concludes our govern-
ment’s bioweapons program did not contribute 
to the proliferation of Lyme, we tum the page. 
And if it did, hopefully this investigation and 
research will contribute to a cure. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment to the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act which would 
deliver a win-win-win for stormwater-stressed 
ecosystems; the military; and communities, 
like Hampton Roads, that host military installa-
tions. I was pleased to introduce this bipar-
tisan amendment with support from my Hamp-
ton Roads colleagues, Representatives LURIA 
and WITTMAN, as well as Representatives 
SARBANES and BROWN from Maryland and 
Representative MACE from South Carolina. 
Flooding that occurs on and around bases 
jeopardizes military readiness and compounds 
the stress of military families. In addition to 
causing flooding, stormwater also remains a 
stubborn source of pollution in the Chesa-
peake Bay, complicating the ongoing work to 
restore this national treasure. For that reason, 
I introduced this amendment to enhance both 
community resilience and the health of water-
ways. 
As rainwater falls on and travels across 
pavement and other impermeable surfaces, it 
picks up all kinds of things—nutrients from 
lawn fertilizer, pet waste, sediments, and 
chemicals that pollute the Chesapeake Bay 
and its tributaries. Because climate change 
and unchecked emissions are heating up our 
atmosphere and oceans, extreme precipitation 
events and deadly storms, like Ida, have be-
come more severe. In addition to more fre-
quent and severe precipitation events on land, 
climate change-driven sea level rise also 
wreaks havoc on coastal stormwater systems, 
especially during high tide. 
My amendment would help address the 
growing threat stormwater poses by expanding 
the authorization of existing infrastructure and 
resilience programs to help slow, store, and fil-
ter stormwater on military bases and in the 
communities that host them. Through the im-
plementation of low impact design and instal-
lation of stormwater management features like 
stormwater ponds, rain gardens, permeable 
pavement, cisterns, and tree boxes, my 
amendment will reduce the stress on water in-
frastructure and address both the issue of 
flooding and stormwater pollution. 
The military recognizes climate change as 
the ‘‘threat multiplier’’ that it is and I am grate-
ful for the Department of Defense’s partner-
ship in the coordinated effort to restore the 
Chesapeake Bay. This amendment will pro-
vide the military the authorization it needs to 
integrate its work to enhance mission readi-
ness with its work to protect the communities 
and watersheds in which installations are situ-
ated. 
While we continue to work to enhance resil-
ience in Hampton Roads and beyond, we 
must also work to rapidly mitigate emissions 
and protect precious carbon sinks—like the 
Chesapeake Bay—to avoid the worst of the 
climate crisis. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment in en bloc number four.

SEC. lll. AMENDMENT TO RADIATION EXPO-
SURE COMPENSATION ACT. 
Section 2(a)(1) of the Radiation Exposure 
Compensation Act (Public Law 101–426; 42 
U.S.C. 2210 note) is amended by inserting ‘‘, 
including individuals in New Mexico, Idaho,

Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, everyone knows the first 
atomic bomb was exploded at the Trin-
ity Site in New Mexico. In fact, be-
tween 1945 and 1992, the United States 
Government conducted more than 200 
aboveground nuclear tests. These tests 
exposed nearby communities and the 
people living and working in those 
communities to radiation. 
As a result of the exposure, tens of 
thousands of downwinders contracted 
cancers and other diseases. In 1999, in 
recognition of this exposure, Congress 
passed the Radiation Exposure Com-
pensation Act to provide a one-time 
payment to many of these individuals

in addition to the uranium miners, mil-

Unfortunately, downwinders in many 
States, including my beautiful State of 
New Mexico, were not included and left 
to deal with the health effects of these 
explosions, like the very first bomb, on 
their own. 
I recently met with Tina Cordova and 
members 
of 
the 
Tularosa 
Basin 
Downwinder Coalition. They told me 
the stories of their loved ones who died 
as a result of these tests. They have 
fought for so long for the government 
to simply recognize them and their 
pain. We do hear their voices, we see 
their pain, and now we must act. 
It is not just New Mexicans that have 
suffered, it is people from Washington 
to the Dakotas to Texas, and all the 
way to Guam. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support 
amendment No. 241, and provide an 
apology to individuals in New Mexico, 
Idaho, Colorado, Arizona, Utah, Texas, 
Wyoming, Oregon, Washington, South 
Dakota, North Dakota, Nevada, Guam, 
and the Northern Mariana Islands, who 
were exposed to radiation during the 
government’s nuclear testing. 
Identical language was included in 
the House-passed National Defense Au-
thorization Acts for both 2019 and 2020. 
It is past time for Congress to begin 
to acknowledge the harm nuclear test-
ing caused to these communities by 
passing this amendment. Our govern-
ment owes these communities a formal 
apology. Let’s do that. 
My amendment is supported by Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote for it, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, near 
the end of World War II, the United 
Stated detonated the first atomic 
weapon at the Trinity Test Site in New 
Mexico. 
Between this first test in 1945 and 
1963, the United States did conduct 
nearly 200 atmospheric, that is above-
ground, atomic weapons tests. These 
activities and other aspects of our 
atomic weapons program may indeed 
have led to cancer in some people and 
other radiation-related illnesses. 
That is why, in 1990, Congress passed 
the Radiation Exposure Compensation 
Act, or RECA, to provide restitution to 
these individuals. This would add to 
RECA an apology to individuals in 
many 
States. 
Now, 
notably, 
this 
amendment would extend an apology 
to individuals residing in States not 
even eligible for compensation under 
the current terms of RECA. 
After Congress last extended and ex-
panded RECA in 2000, the National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
and Medicine studied the effect of nu-
clear weapons tests on the health of 
surrounding populations. This study 
concluded, ‘‘the scientific evidence in-
dicates that in most cases it is un-
likely that exposure to radiation from 
fallout was a substantial contributing 
cause to developing cancer.’’ 
Simply put, the science does not sup-
port the assertion that atomic weapons 
testing caused widespread instances of 
cancer. 
Despite 
this 
finding, 
the 
amendment before us would declare 
that 
U.S. 
atomic 
weapons 
testing 
caused cancer in individuals in New 
Mexico, 
Idaho, 
Colorado, 
Arizona, 
Utah, Texas, Wyoming, Oregon, Wash-
ington, South Dakota, North Dakota, 
Nevada, Guam, and the Northern Mar-
iana Islands. 
The Democrats are fond of saying we 
must follow the science when they for-
bid Americans from going to work or 
children from attending school or fami-
lies from attending church. I wish they 
would actually follow the science not 
only when they find it politically con-
venient, but when they find it politi-
cally inconvenient. 
Any change to RECA must be fully 
considered by the Judiciary Committee 
to ensure that compensation is only 
provided for illnesses that can be rea-
sonably traced to activities of the U.S. 
Government. 
On a personal note, I would add that 
my father, in 1945, was serving in the 
88th Infantry Division in Italy. They 
were under orders to prepare to ship 
out for the invasion of the Japanese 
mainland. That invasion would have 
created a slaughter on both sides un-
imaginable to history. 
The development of this weapon pre-
vented that from occurring and saved 
countless Japanese and American lives 
and the slaughter that would have oth-
erwise unfolded. That is not something 
I intend to apologize for. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, precisely because of the im-
portance of those atomic tests and the 
impact on the people of New Mexico, 
which we all recognize was the very 
first test of an atomic bomb, and the 
importance that it played in our his-
tory, and the ending of World War II. 
What we are asking for, at the very 
least, is an apology not for the bomb, 
but for the impact; the impact that it 
had on those lives of those people in 
those communities who are people that 
I know. They are grandparents and 
children, they are my neighbors. And I 
believe, that at the very least, we must 
apologize to those who we left out of 
RECA for the impact that they suffered 
with regards to their health. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 667, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Mrs. 
TORRES) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
amendment—a 
very 
simple 
amend-
ment. My amendment seeks to restore 
congressional 
notification 
require-
ments on a category of munitions ex-
port licenses. 
For decades, when a U.S. company 
wanted to export these munitions, the 
sale required authorization from the 
Federal Government. The State De-
partment has the responsibility for 
issuing approvals for most types of 
weapons once it has assessed any im-
pact on our national security or our 
foreign policy. 
The State Department was also re-
quired to notify Congress every time it 
approved a license. Unfortunately, the 
Trump administration changed all of 
this. It moved the licensing of firearms 
export sales from the State Depart-
ment to the Department of Commerce, 
and it changed the standard review 
process. 
They also ended the congressional 
notification process. The Department 
of Commerce is not currently required 
to notify Congress when they issue a 
munitions export license. 
I strongly opposed those changes. 
Given the serious national security 
implications of foreign munitions sales 
and the possibility that those weapons 
could end up in the wrong hands, Con-
gress has a clear policy interest in un-
derstanding when they occur. 
This amendment will restore those 
notification 
requirements 
by 
man-
dating that the Department of Com-
merce follow the same procedure and 
guidelines that was in place prior to 
that change. 
Frankly, I am surprised that anyone 
is objecting to restoring longstanding 
congressional oversight powers. 
I hope my colleagues will support my 
amendment to ensure that foreign mu-
nitions sales receive the careful scru-
tiny they deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment, and I am 
opposed to the legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, on Janu-
ary 23, 2020, President Trump carried 
forward an initiative that had begun in 
2010 focused on improving processes for 
reviewing 
arms 
exports, 
including 
making 
necessary 
updates 
to 
the 
United States Munitions List. Specifi-
cally, the items that moved fell within 
the category of firearms, for sure, how-
ever, only certain items were moved, 
not all. 
The State Department retains over-
sight of those defense articles and serv-
ices that provide a critical military or 
intelligence advantage or, in the case 
of weapons, are inherently for military 
end use. 
Now, what does that mean? 
That means fully automatic firearms 
and modern artillery, silencers, compo-
nents, parts, and accessories specifi-
cally designed for automatic firearms 
remain on the munitions list under 
State Department jurisdiction. These 
are still subject to congressional noti-
fication requirements as appropriate. 
For the items that were moved to 
Commerce, their export still requires 
authorization, but under Commerce 
Department regulations. 
Just keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, we 
compete. Even arms manufacturers in 
the United States still have to compete 
globally. Now, we can either sell Amer-
ican arms to our allies, or we can have 
them go shop with Russia or China. 
That would be great. 
Now, the Department of Commerce 
has been regulating exports of shot-
guns and specific types of ammunitions 
for decades and continues to do so 
today. For goodness’ sake, even Presi-
dent Biden, who really doesn’t have a 
clue about weapons, recommended that 
we all get a shotgun, didn’t he? He said 
that. 
The House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee has the ability and responsi-
bility to request any licenses or au-
thorizations approved or denied by 
Commerce, pursuant to the Export 
Control Reform Act passed in August 
of 2018. To date, there has not been any 
inappropriate licenses issued for any of 
these items to any entities—none. 
Moreover, no Member has even re-
quested licensing information from 
Commerce since this shift. There just 
simply has not been any problem. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a solution that is 
looking for a problem. There isn’t a 
problem. There is no basis for this 
amendment as it directly contradicts 
the spirit of this regulatory change. 
Shifting this regulatory function to 
Commerce does not and never has gov-
erned the illicit transfer of firearms. 
This is about the illicit transfer of 
firearms. If we wanted to get to the il-
licit transfer of firearms, and my col-
leagues on the other side were really 
serious about that, they would be in-
terested to find out what ever hap-
pened with Fast and Furious. That was 
an illicit transfer of firearms. 
This amendment falsely claims to ad-
dress illicit transfer of firearms. This is 
not an amendment that will address 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, we can reserve the debate 
whether the State Department or the 
Commerce Department should have ju-
risdiction over gun sale exports. 
This amendment is not about that. 
This amendment is very simple. It re-
stores a longstanding requirement to 
notify Congress—a notification. That is 
not dictating to anyone where they 
should sell or whom they should sell 
weapons to. Simply report to Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I respectfully request a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I just want 
to reiterate that the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee—that is a committee 
in Congress. That is Congress, by the 
way. That is what Congress is. 
The House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee can request and has the author-
ization to approve or deny these ex-
ports pursuant to the Export Control 
Reform Act passed in August of 2018. It 
is already covered. All we are doing is 
adding redundancy. All we are doing is 
making it more difficult if we pass this 
for us to sell our allies things that they 
want to have from us and we want to 
sell to them. 
Why would we make that more dif-
ficult? It seems to me we want to help 
our allies and our allies want to help 
us. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

WHAT INJUSTICE LOOKS LIKE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, Mr. Speaker, and I rise 
tonight to preview a resolution that I 
hope to present to the entirety of the 
Congress for a vote. It is H. Res. 670. 
I rise tonight to present this resolu-
tion because of what I have seen, by 
way of television, at the southern bor-
der. What I have seen is more than de-
plorable, more than horrific. For me, it 
is inhumane. And here is the resolution 
that I hope to have my colleagues give 
consideration to. 
Resolution condemning the inhu-
mane treatment of Haitian migrants at 
the southern border of the United 
States. 
Whereas, some U.S. Customs—might 
I pause to indicate that we should ac-
centuate the word some, not all, not all 
U.S. customs agents are engaged in 
this abhorrent behavior, this inhumane 
behavior. Not all. I would never say all. 
I would never intend all. 
I am in Congress today, I believe, be-
cause of an uncle who was a deputy 
sheriff, and he was a person that I had 
great respect for, great admiration for, 
and he proclaimed when I was a very 
young child that I would be a lawyer. I 
didn’t know what a lawyer was but, be-
cause of the respect that I had for him 
and the belief that he was right, I 
wanted to be a lawyer. And from that 
moment forward, from being a young 
child, less than 10 years of age, I want-
ed to be a lawyer. Hence, I went to law 
school and, by fortuitous circumstance, 
I happened to have been associated 
with a professor at the law school who 
was running for public office, which 
caused me to find my way into politics. 
So I owe a lot to just a sentence, a 
statement from someone who was en-
gaged in law enforcement that I had 
great respect for. 
So, whereas, some U.S. Customs Bor-
der Patrol agents, not all, have treated 
Haitian migrants inhumanely, charg-
ing them on horseback, while using 
reins as lashes; now, therefore, be it re-
solved that the House of Representa-
tives condemns and denounces the ac-
tions of those Customs and Border Pa-
trol agents. 
Note that I said of ‘‘those’’ Customs 
and Border Patrol agents, only the 
ones who engaged in this despicable be-
havior. 
Resolved that the House of Rep-
resentatives condemns and denounces 
the actions of those Customs and Bor-
der 
Patrol 
agents 
who 
confronted 
some, not all of the Haitians, but some 
Haitian migrants on horseback, using 
their reins as lashes. 
I believe that the same House that 
has condemned its Members for con-
duct thought to be unbecoming; the 
same House that has condemned the 
behavior of people who are not associ-
ated with this House; it has been done. 
I believe that this same House should 
condemn the conduct of these agents, 
the conduct, what they did. Their con-
duct should be condemned. 
Now, why do I take such a strong po-
sition? 
I take such a strong position, because 
I know what injustice looks like. I 
have had persons in my lifetime to do 
some very ugly things and require 
some ugly things of me. 
I was required to sit in the back of 
the bus. I know what injustice looks 
like. 
I know what it tastes like. I had to 
drink from filthy, colored water foun-
tains. White water fountain; colored 
water fountain. White water fountain; 
pristine, clean. Colored water fountain; 
filthy. But that is what I was relegated 
to. 
I know what it smells like. I had to 
go into necessary facilities. That is 
what we call it in the law, but a nec-
essary facility is nothing more than a 
toilet. And I was forced to go into 
these filthy toilets. And this is where I 
would have to wash my hands in a 
filthy facility with water that some-
times was colored in its own being. It 
was brown. 
So I know what it looks like; I know 
what it tastes like; I know what it 
smells like. But I also know what it 
hurts like. 
I know what it is like to be required 
to leave a seat so that someone else 
could take a seat. I know what that 
feels like. I know what it feels like to 
have to step off the sidewalk to let 
other persons pass. This was the seg-
regated south that I grew up in. 
I am a son of the segregated south. 
The rights and privileges that the Con-
stitution recognized for me, my neigh-
bors in the segregated south denied me. 
So I know what injustice is like. 
I also know what invidious discrimi-
nation is like, but tonight let’s just 
talk about injustice. And because I 
know what it looks like, I also know 
how it behaves. 
Injustice is not static, it is dynamic. 
It is like this pandemic. It is like the 
virus. It can metamorphose. 
Do not assume that the injustice in-
flicted upon some today will not be in-
flicted upon others tomorrow. Do not 
assume that injustice will only find its 
way to those who look like me. Injus-
tice has a way of metamorphosing into 
a hate that can consume all of us. 
With this understanding, I want to 
just share some of what I see as I re-
flect on what happened at the border. 
This is something that I believe to be 
relevant, in that this is a depiction of 
where Black people were at one time in 
this country. If you will look to the far 
end of this picture, it is actually a por-
trait, if you will. You will see a person 
on a horse, and he has a whip and he 
seems to be screaming, and he seems to 
be about to use this whip; he is about 
to lash this person who is between him 
and another person on a horse. 
Now, what is to be noticed about this 
is that the person who is on foot, this 
person seems to have his hands in a po-
sition of surrender; doesn’t have a 
weapon; doesn’t seem to be a threat to 
men on horses. 
And if you will note, there is a rope 
that has him tethered to the horse or 
the man in front of it. 
And if you will note, look at his eyes, 
if you can see his eyes. He has a look of 
regret and sorrow. He has a look of a 
person who wishes that he could some-
how express something that would 
cause his condition to subside. He 
seems to be pleading with the person in 
front of him, possibly realizing what is 
about to happen as a result of what the 
person behind him will do. 
This is a sad commentary on our 
country. It is a sad commentary on 
what the United States of America 
was. It is a sad commentary. It is 
something we don’t like to discuss. We 
don’t want to acknowledge, we don’t 
want it taught in our schools that this 
is the truth about a bygone era in this 
country. 
But you can’t escape the truth. Truth 
crushed to Earth will rise again. This 
is a sad commentary. 
Let’s move forward. 
By the way, the prior depiction was 
from 1817. 
This depiction occurred at the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge. All in Congress 
are aware of the Edmund Pettus Bridge 
because the Honorable John Lewis was 
here, and we all know his story of what 
happened 
at 
the 
Edmund 
Pettus 
Bridge. 
John Lewis and I were friends. The 
Honorable John Lewis and I were 
friends. We went to jail together sev-
eral times. We talked to each other 
while we were in jail. John Lewis was 
in jail the same as he was with us. He 
was a wonderful, marvelous person, and 
I miss him. I believe we do, all of us. 
But I remember him explaining how 
you cannot tolerate injustice. You 
can’t. Those who tolerate injustice per-
petuate injustice. Some things bear re-
peating. Those who tolerate injustice 
perpetuate injustice. 
This gathering at the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge was about people who were no 
longer going to tolerate injustice. They 
made their minds up. 
If you have ever been to the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge, and if you haven’t been 
there, you should go. The Edmund 
Pettus Bridge has a crest such that 
when you initially approach it, you 
can’t readily see what lies on the other 
side. You don’t know what your fate is, 
if there is something that would harm 
you on the other side.

When you march across the Edmund 
Pettus Bridge and you reach that crest, 
you can see what your fate is, if there 
are persons of ill will waiting for you. 
These marchers, on what is known 
now as Bloody Sunday, were marching 
up the Edmund Pettus Bridge from 
Selma to Montgomery. They had no 
weapons. They had no means of defend-
ing themselves against persons who 
had clubs. But their fate, they saw. 
Yet, they marched on. As they were 
confronted by the constabulary, they 
marched on. 
I have often thought, if they had re-
sisted and put up a fight, would Bloody 
Sunday have the same representation, 
the same meaning that it has now be-
cause when these images were shown 
around the world, it gave a President 
the opportunity to take some affirma-
tive action to bring about significant 
change. 
But this is what was happening on 
Bloody Sunday. You see, there are men 
on horses. These men on horses are 
moving toward the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge, which you can see in the dis-
tance, and you can see that there are 
other men moving this way. In here, 
you have peaceful protesters, just 
marching. 
This is a representation that a good 
many persons of African ancestry have 
indelibly printed within their memory. 
Bloody Sunday changed our lives be-
cause there were people who were will-
ing to make great sacrifices so that we 
could confront injustice, not tolerate 
it. They didn’t tolerate it. 
Now, let’s fast-forward. This is a de-
piction, a true and accurate depiction, 
I believe, of what I have seen televised 
and of what happened at our southern 
border. 
If you didn’t have to sit in the back 
of the bus, if you didn’t have to step off 
the sidewalk to let others pass, if you 
have never had a cross burned—I say 
‘‘in my honor’’—but burned in your 
yard, you may not see what I see. You 
may see agents doing their job, trying 
to make sure that people who are in-
vading our country are prevented from 
invading our country. This is what you 
may see. 
But I believe people of goodwill, re-
gardless of who, when people of good-
will see this, people of goodwill are of 
the opinion that this is an injustice. I 
don’t believe that people of goodwill 
who never have experienced what I 
have experienced and seen these other 
representations, I don’t believe that 
people of goodwill can see a means by 
which we can justify this kind of be-
havior. 
This is behavior that we cannot tol-
erate in a country that pledges alle-
giance to liberty and justice for all. 
You can’t tolerate this in a country 
that requires in some places respect for 
the flag. I believe that you can respect 
the flag if you choose to. But there are 
some places in the country where peo-
ple want to require—maybe I should 
say ‘‘want to require’’ you to respect 
the flag. I believe you respect the flag 
because you respect what it stands for. 
I say the Pledge of Allegiance. You 
cannot tag me as a flag burner, but I 
respect those who want to burn it. You 
have every right to do so, and I will re-
spect your right to burn it. But I am 
not a flag burner. I believe in the coun-
try and what it stands for, the ideals of 
this country. 
If you believe in the ideals of liberty 
and justice for all—not all who were 
born here, by the way, but all, regard-
less of your race, creed, color, or your 
place of origin. This is what this coun-
try stands for. If you stand for this, 
there is no way you can tolerate this. 
If you stand for we the people, if you 
stand for a more perfect Union, you 
can’t tolerate this. It can’t just be an-
other thing that happened and let’s go 
on with our lives. 
I am not a person who believes that 
we should simply live and let live. I am 
not a live-and-let-liver. Live and let 
live, to me, means I live my life; you 
live your life; I am not going to get in 
your way and don’t you get in my way. 
That is not my philosophy. 
I believe in live and help live. If I see 
someone in harm’s way, I believe I 
have a duty, a moral obligation, a 
moral imperative, to do what I can to 
help that person in harm’s way. 
These persons are in harm’s way. We 
have a moral imperative to help these 
persons. That is why I am presenting 
this resolution. It is a part of a moral 
imperative. 
To be very honest with you, I hope 
every Member will vote for it. I hope 
the leadership will allow it to come to 
the floor. To be very honest, to be to-
tally, completely, and absolutely hon-
est, if no one votes for it, I am going to 
present it. 
I have a responsibility, and I am 
going to live up to my responsibility. I 
didn’t come here to just get along so 
that I could move along. 
We have a moral imperative to be 
helpful. Let me expound upon this im-
perative for just a second or two. 
There is something called TPS, tem-
porary protective status. TPS has been 
accorded to Haitians who are residents 
in the country prior to a certain date. 
TPS means that we won’t send them 
back to Haiti because we have con-
cluded that it would not be safe for 
them to go back to Haiti. So, we are 
not sending them back. 
That is TPS, except if you are at the 
southern border, except if you are at 
the southern border and you are trying 
to get into this country. Then we send 
you back, and we do so under another 
section of the law. 
But I have to ask myself: How can we 
rationalize saying that it is okay to 
send them back, these persons, when 
we already have said that other per-
sons from the same country deserve 
temporary protection, the temporary 
protective status? 
Then you have to ask yourself about 
these people. Where are they from? 
Where did they come from just before 
getting here? Where did they come 
from? My guess is they didn’t swim 
across the Gulf of Mexico a week or 
two before. No, the facts are that they 
didn’t and that many of them have 
been living in places south of the bor-
der for years, some more than 10 years. 
So, we decide that persons who are 
protected with TPS, not these persons, 
but who are going to go to a country 
where persons are not going to be sent 
because it is not safe to send them 
there, we decide that is where we are 
going to send these people who haven’t 
been there in 10 years—not these spe-
cific people, but Haitians who are out 
there among the throngs of people, out 
there among the throngs under the 
bridge at the southern border. We de-
cided we are going to send them to 
Haiti. 
I was in a hearing just recently with 
the experts, the people who know. My 
question was: When we send people to 
Haiti who haven’t been there in a dec-
ade, what do we give them? What kind 
of help do we give them? 
Well, here is what we give them: a 
cell phone and some money, not a lot 
of money. At the time, there was no 
real answer as to how much. My guess 
is not a lot. 
By the way, this doesn’t just happen 
to Haitians, this sending back. Mr. 
Jose Escobar, who lives in my district, 
went to report to the authorities with 
his wife and child. They took him from 
his wife and his child, with $20 in his 
pocket, and sent him to El Salvador. 
He hadn’t been to El Salvador in 15 
years. 
He came here by virtue of a desire to 
escape harm’s way. His mother re-
ceived TPS, brought him here as a 
child, about 15 years of age, but he 
didn’t get TPS—some mixup in the pa-
perwork. So they had been trying for 
years to right the wrong in terms of 
the mixup in paperwork. 
It took 2 years to bring Mr. Escobar 
home. But my staff and I worked for 2 
years, and I went to El Salvador myself 
multiple 
times. 
We 
brought 
Mr. 
Escobar home. 
I am not giving up on the Escobars of 
the world, and I am not giving up on 
these persons. I don’t know them, but I 
have a moral obligation to make sure 
that an injustice is not tolerated. 
Now, let’s talk about one additional 
thing. 
I suppose I could leave this up. 
Maybe this person had done something 
wrong. I can’t see why we would have 
this, what appears to be the reins of 
the horse moving in his direction. 
But here is what is interesting. In all 
the shots that I saw, the reins were al-
ways on the side where the people 
were. The reins weren’t off on this side. 
They were on the side where the people 
were. If you want to make the argu-
ment that they were not using reins as 
lashes, you can. But I find it highly co-
incidental—too much of a coincidence 
to be a coincidence—that the reins are 
always on the side with the people. 
I think I will leave it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5080 
September 22, 2021 
Friends, these are similar moments 
in time, moments in time that can im-
pact the rest of time. Tolerate this and 
you are not seeing the last of it. That 
is why I believe that we in this House 
should take up a resolution that con-
demns the actions. 
I am not condemning the person. I 
am condemning what the person is 
doing. He is entitled to due process. 
But in the court of public opinion, and 
based on what my eyes see, this behav-
ior should not be tolerated. 
Someone has said, well, you need to 
hear his side of the story. I don’t mind 
hearing his side of the story. But I also 
understand what I see. 
You can explain anything away in to-
day’s culture and today’s time with the 
mindsets that we have in this country. 
You can explain anything away. But I 
believe my eyes. You don’t have to be-
lieve yours. I believe my eyes. This is 
wrong. This is an injustice, not some-
thing that this House should tolerate. 
I have already sent the letter, I be-
lieve—as I was leaving my office, I 
asked my staff to send it—to leader-
ship, asking that the resolution be 
heard. 
It is not a privileged resolution. For 
those who don’t know, a privileged res-
olution is one that does not require the 
consent of leadership to be brought to 
the floor for a vote. This is not a privi-
leged resolution, so we have to have 
the consent. 
b 1930 
It is no secret that I am making the 
request. I have great respect for all of 
the leadership in this Congress, on both 
sides of the aisle, but I want to let peo-
ple know that I am going to ask that 
the resolution be voted on. It is very 
simple. It is not difficult to com-
prehend. There is nothing enigmatic 
about it. It is very pragmatic, in my 
mind’s eye. 
But I want it to be brought to the 
floor. And I want people to know that 
we who represent the people of this 
country—we who represent the people 
of this country will not tolerate this 
kind of behavior. 
I believe that if we do so, we will pre-
vent many other persons from having 
to suffer the same kind of injustice. I 
think we have a moral imperative to 
bring this to the floor. 
I will close with this. C. A. Tindley 
shared these words that I will para-
phrase. He reminds us that: 
‘‘Harder yet may be the fight; 
right may often yield to might; 
wickedness a while may reign; 
Satan’s cause may seem to gain. 
There is a God that rules above, 
with hand of power and heart of love;’’ 
And when I am right, that God will help me 
fight. 
Harder yet may be the fight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
UNPRECEDENTED CRISES IN 
AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON) is recognized for 60 minutes as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, what a mess we have here on 
our hands. Make no mistake, our coun-
try was facing numerous crises when 
we all left here for the August district 
work period, and now it has only got-
ten worse. 
Because of the backwards Biden poli-
cies, we have a number of crises, un-
precedented crises like our country has 
never faced, all at one time. 
We have an economic crisis where 
jobs 
remain 
stalled 
and 
consumer 
prices continue to soar at their highest 
rate in 40 years. 
We have a border crisis. Everybody 
can see that. It is impossible to over-
state what a disaster it has become. We 
all see these horrific videos showing 
over 
10,000 
illegal 
migrants 
being 
housed under a bridge in the hot Texas 
sun. 
In August alone over 208,000 illegal 
aliens were encountered at our border 
by our law enforcement, what is left of 
it, the Border Patrol, Customs agents. 
Our border security is overwhelmed, 
and they can’t do the job that they are 
hired to do. 
We have a national security crisis. 
On Friday, of course, tragically we 
learned that President Biden’s disas-
trous Afghanistan exit was topped off 
by a drone strike that killed 10 civil-
ians, including 7 children and zero ter-
rorists. 
After nearly two months of district 
work away from Washington, instead 
of coming back here early to deal with 
all these unprecedented crises, the 
Democrat leadership waited, and so 
now here we are. 
What do they have for us now? What 
do they have on the docket to handle 
all these crises? Well, we have a bill to 
legalize abortion on demand until 
birth, we have a bill to spend another 
$3.5 trillion, and they are pushing one 
of the largest tax increases in our Na-
tion’s history. 
Their answer for the American peo-
ple, their answer to us, their answer to 
stalled jobs and rising inflation and a 
humanitarian crisis and a foreign pol-
icy crisis and all the rest is more abor-
tion, trillions more in spending, and 
more tax hikes. 
This is not what was advertised. This 
is not what the American people want 
or need. 
You will hear a lot tonight about the 
Democrats’ abortion on demand until 
birth legislation. We are talking about 
it tonight. My colleagues who will be 
joining me here tonight, many will 
speak to this issue because it is one of 
the darkest, most brazen, most ex-
treme bills ever brought to this floor. 
It would legalize on-demand abortion 
until birth. It would remove nearly all 
pro-life protections for the unborn, and 
it would abolish laws that prevent even 
late-term abortion. It is barbaric, and 
it must be stopped. 
I am so fortunate to be joined to-
night by so many colleagues who share 
my concerns about this to discuss all 
these monstrous proposals and these 
terrible disasters that we are facing 
and to offer our competing vision for 
the future of this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I want to respond a little bit to 
the statement made prior to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana. I think maybe 
some of the public was misled into be-
lieving that people, the Haitians cross-
ing our southern border are coming 
here from Haiti. They are actually liv-
ing quite comfortably or at least ade-
quately in Brazil and Chile and are not 
coming here out of necessity. 
They are coming here because of a 
change in policy in special immigra-
tion status instituted by the Biden ad-
ministration which, as expected, has 
resulted in Haitians coming here from 
other countries than Chile. 
Now, tonight there are many issues 
that should be debated. We have the 
crisis at the border. We still have the 
crisis in Afghanistan, we have more 
mundane inflation here at home, we 
have the racial hatred trying to be in-
cited by the majority party. 
But in the midst of all these other 
issues, they have decided on Friday, 
over 220 of them are planning to vote 
on 
something 
called 
the 
Women’s 
Health Protection Act. I haven’t seen a 
more morally reprehensible piece of 
legislation in all my time in public life. 
This legislation is going to legalize 
abortion up to the date of birth. So you 
understand, right now that will put us 
as one of seven countries worldwide 
who are in that ballpark, and only 
three other countries would have a bill 
so extreme—Red China, North Korea, 
and Vietnam—all countries in the re-
cent past—and things have turned 
around a little in China—countries 
that proudly shut down religion and in 
particular Christianity, though it has 
bounced back a little in China. 
So there we are. Are you proud? 
United States, North Korea, North 
Vietnam, Red China. 
This bill will legalize abortion up to 
the date of birth. Unbelievable. You 
have 
to 
realize 
in 
this 
country 
throughout most of our history abor-
tion was illegal. Abortion was illegal 
even 
though 
we 
didn’t 
have 
ultrasounds, and it wasn’t so obvious 
how horrific it is. 
So what did we respond to with about 
50 years of ultrasounds in this country? 
We look at those ultrasounds, and we 
send people to Congress who say: Let’s 
kill those children. 
I also want to point out there are 
some moderating bills around the var-
ious States which were designed to at 
least give the people some ability to 
back away from some of these horrific 
abortions. 
When I was in the State legislature, 
I authored a bill, it was a 24-hour wait-
ing period bill, and I talked to plenty

of women who were bullied into abor-
tions by boyfriends or parents and re-
gretted it. So we passed a 24-hour wait-
ing period bill, and after they showed 
up at the abortionist, they looked at 
the 
literature 
they 
had 
received, 
looked at the ultrasounds and turned 
around. 
There is some evidence that because 
of that bill about one in seven women 
changed their mind and would not re-
turn for the second appointment. But 
apparently that was too much for the 
majority party. We cannot give women 
a 24-hour waiting period. We have to 
have that abortion soon after they 
enter the clinic. 
The next thing that really intrigues 
me is some States have gone after sex- 
selective abortion. Perhaps since the 
majority party wants to invite people 
from all over the world here, they like 
the cultural change which some people 
view around the world, they view a 
baby girl as somewhat less desirable 
than a baby boy, and therefore they 
want to kill that baby girl. Of course, 
here in the United States we are of-
fended by such a thing, and States pass 
bills saying we are not going to have 
sex-selective abortions. But apparently 
it is time to weigh in, the majority 
party feels, time to weigh in into an 
area which has traditionally been the 
purview of the States and say: No, no, 
we can’t have States having such a 
law. 
We have to go back to the days in 
which you would come and do the 
ultrasound, and say: Oh, it looks like a 
little girl, better get rid of this one 
right away. That is apparently what 
the majority party wants to make 
legal. 
I want the American people to wake 
up. We need a moral reawakening in 
this country. Wake up and realize that 
the majority of the House of Rep-
resentatives on this Friday is going to 
stand up and say abortion is legal vir-
tually until birth. 
They are going to say it is wrong for 
any State to say you need a 24-hour 
waiting period, it is wrong to say that 
we want to stop the sex-selective abor-
tions. 
Wake up, America. We are in the 
middle of a moral free fall. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. It is 
time to wake up, Mr. Speaker. I yield 
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. KELLY), who is equally passionate. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, tonight we are going to be 
talking about the leading causes of 
death in the United States. I just want 
to go over this because I think some-
times we become disillusioned with 
what is actually happening. 
The National Center for Health Sta-
tistics of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention reports on the 
leading causes of death in the United 
States but does not include abortion 
among their list of causes of death. 
Here is an accurate representation of 
the leading causes of death for 2019, 
which includes the number one cause of 
death. That is abortion. Also, deaths 
due to COVID in 2020 and 2021 are in-
cluded for comparison. 
You start off with suicide or inten-
tional self-harm, 47,511 Americans died. 
Influenza 
and 
pneumonia, 
49,783 
Americans died. 
Nephritis and nephrotic syndrome, 
kidney disease, 51,665 died from that. 
Diabetes, 87,647. 
Alzheimer’s disease, 121,499 deaths. 
Stroke, 150,005 deaths. 
Chronic lower respiratory, 156,979 
deaths. 
Accidents, 172,040 deaths. 
Cancer, 599,601 deaths. 
COVID, 656,488, and that is 18 months 
total. 
Heart disease, 659,041. 
And we all know about these deaths 
because you cannot watch TV or listen 
to any news when you are not con-
stantly hearing about what people in 
America are dying from because it is a 
crisis for us. 
Abortion, 849,000. 
All the data are from one year, 2019, 
except for COVID. Deaths in the United 
States of America from COVID reached 
528,600 at the one-year mark of March 
2020 to March 2021, but the entire 18- 
month death toll is included in the 
comparison above. 
More unborn babies died daily from 
abortion in the United States of Amer-
ica than born children and adults from 
the COVID pandemic. 
We are asked to wear masks, we are 
asked to social distance, we are asked 
to self-quarantine. What we aren’t 
asked is to address deaths by decision. 
Abortions. 
I would like to suggest that, not only 
all Members of this Congress, but the 
330 million Americans that we rep-
resent, if they have the opportunity to 
do it, call their parents and thank 
them for being pro-life. 
How can we possibly be debating on 
this floor the destruction of life by a 
decision, not from a disease but from a 
decision? 
849,000 souls cry out to us. They can-
not defend themselves, but we can de-
fend them. We will pass a law—it will 
get passed here on this floor. 
And people will say: Well, you don’t 
understand. You know what, KELLY, I 
am really not for abortion, it is not my 
personal preference, but gosh darn it, it 
is what the Supreme Court issued. 
I tell all those Members, you have a 
voting card that is actually your per-
sonal preference and your decision. 
Please do not try to fool the American 
people about what is taking place right 
here in this House, the people’s House, 
and say that somehow your personal 
preference would not be to see all these 
children aborted, but there is nothing 
you can do about it. 
Yes, there is. Vote the right way. 
Turn this down. Abortion right up 
until birth? Are you kidding me? How 
in the world can we ever talk about 
ourselves as being a Judeo-Christian 
moral country whenever we do things 
like this? 
Mr. Speaker, I just hope that Amer-
ica wakes up and looks at what is tak-
ing place right now and says, not on 
our watch, not ever on our watch, not 
at this time or any time. The greatest 
country in the world, the greatest na-
tion in the world, the greatest pro-
tector of freedom and liberty cannot 
sit back and blindly accept what is 
happening in our country. 
b 1945 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
always 
appreciate 
Mr. 
KELLY’s clarity and conviction. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BABIN), another man 
with great conviction. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend and neighbor for yielding. 
I rise today in fierce opposition to 
H.R. 3755, the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act of 2021. The goal of this bill is 
not to protect the health of women, 
but rather, to remove all barriers 
standing in the way of murdering mil-
lions of innocent babies. 
This deceptively-named legislation 
would be more accurately entitled the 
abortion on demand until birth act. 
Once again, the Democrat Party has 
pathetically caved to the demands of 
the far left. 
This bill will not only legalize abor-
tion on demand for any reason, it will 
make it available at any time during 
the pregnancy. 
By nullifying State regulations, this 
radical bill will eliminate any prohibi-
tions on sex-selection abortions, late- 
term abortions, and abortions based on 
Down syndrome or another genetic di-
agnosis. 
The Democrats know that their pro- 
abortion agenda does not align with 
the views of most Americans. 
They know that when given a choice, 
more than 75 percent of Americans sup-
port some limitations on abortion. 
Knowing this, it is too risky for them 
to leave the choice to the people and to 
the State legislatures that represent 
them. Instead, Democrats vote to im-
pose their will at all costs. 
We cannot, and I will not, remain si-
lent while Democrats play abhorrent 
political games with the lives of our 
most vulnerable citizens. I will never 
stop fighting to protect the unborn and 
stand firm in my opposition to this hei-
nous legislation. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI), another 
strong voice on the issues. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this week the House is 
considering radical legislation that 
would 
unravel 
fundamental 
human 
rights and obliterate pro-life laws that 
are across our Nation. 
The Democrats’ effort to advance 
this abortion on demand piece of legis-
lation across the Nation could be con-
sidered the most consequential legisla-
tion of my lifetime. 
Much has changed since the Supreme

September 22, 2021 
decades later our medical capabilities 
and understanding is far better. And 
with incredible advancements in mod-
ern sonograms and imaging, there can 
be no doubt that a child in a womb is 
a living person deserving of life. 
And yet in this moment we are about 
to embark on one of the biggest set-
backs in our Nation’s history. 
Right now, this very moment as it 
ticks by, lives are on the line as every 
second goes by. 
Some of this bill’s supporters like to 
call pro-life Americans and our convic-
tions extreme. Let me tell you in this 
House about extreme. I have seen ex-
treme, and I am going to tell you about 
extreme. 
At home in South Bend, Indiana, I 
saw an extreme abortionist. I saw what 
an extreme abortionist can do in one 
decade in several States that happened 
to be on the abortion train. 
It is sickening beyond words what Dr. 
Ulrich ‘‘George’’ Klopfer did as he pro-
vided abortions in Indiana for decades. 
When he died in 2019, his family found 
the medically preserved remains of 
2,411 children in formaldehyde bottles 
lining the walls in his garage. That is 
nearly 2,500 human beings. 
Law enforcement officials believe 
that the remains were gathered from 
his so-called medical practices in Indi-
ana between 2000 and 2003. Dr. Klopfer 
had countless victims, both unborn ba-
bies and mothers, and he represents a 
grotesque violation of human dignity. 
This American society should not 
and cannot tolerate that. That is ex-
treme. 
The abortionist revealed a callous 
disregard for life. If that isn’t extreme, 
ladies and gentlemen, I don’t know 
what is. 
Human life is precious, and every 
human life, every person deserves that 
dignity that we are fighting for to-
night. We have an obligation to the 
next generation to oppose this extreme 
anti-life effort and to uphold the sanc-
tity of life in this Nation. 
I am proud to join with millions of 
pro-life Americans to oppose abortion 
on demand and to defend the right to 
life. Science is on our side. More im-
portantly, ladies and gentlemen, the 
truth is on our side. Our enduring com-
mitment to life will prevail. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
that compelling testimony. And this 
legislation would formalize, legalize 
the very industry that allowed that 
monster to continue his practices in 
Indiana and elsewhere. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE), a former pas-
tor and great lawmaker. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my dear friend from Louisiana 
for yielding. We are here this evening 
to recognize, but most importantly, to 
defend the sanctity of human life, 
something that once again is under at-
tack in this House. 
In response to the left’s adamant de-
sire for abortion legislation, Speaker 
PELOSI is demanding that we vote on 
H.R. 3755 to allow abortion at any time 
during a pregnancy. The left wants to, 
in addition, strip away the rights of 
States to protect the lives of unborn 
children. This is abortion on demand, 
and quite frankly, the Democrats don’t 
care if the unborn child has a fully de-
veloped heart. They don’t care if it has 
arms or legs or fingers or toes. They 
don’t care if it feels pain. They want 
abortion, period, and they want to fi-
nance it with your tax dollars. 
Time and time again, the Democrats 
in Congress stand in the way of those 
of us who are trying to protect the 
lives of those who cannot protect 
themselves. 
Eliminating 
innocent 
human life is despicable. It is outright 
evil. And I for one am tired of the left 
continually sacrificing the lives of the 
unborn on the altar of their progressive 
ideals. 
We cannot give up this fight. We can-
not turn a blind eye. We must defend 
the sanctity of life and the unborn. 
Never, and I mean never, will we falter 
in this duty. 
I stand in strong opposition along 
with my colleagues to H.R. 3755. Life is 
sacred. It is a fundamental and divine 
right that is gifted to every single 
human being, and we will always stand 
against the abortion industry and 
fight. Life and the right to life is some-
thing that only God almighty gives, 
and it is something that our Constitu-
tion guarantees. So help us God to 
stand for it. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Thank 
you so much for that, my brother. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER), 
one of the great pro-life champions in 
the congress. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 3755, the 
supposed Women’s Health Protection 
Act. The underlying bill would be more 
aptly titled the women and babies 
health endangerment act, as it evis-
cerates State pro-life laws that serve 
to protect women and babies from dan-
gerous and discriminatory abortion 
procedures. Simply put, this bill will 
allow healthcare providers to perform 
an abortion on anyone, for any reason, 
at any time up until birth. 
By erasing state parental consent 
protections, informed consent laws, 
and dangerous take-home chemical 
abortion prohibitions, this bill would 
allow a 16-year-old pregnant minor to 
show up at an abortion clinic, and 
without knowing how far along she is 
or any of the risks associated with an 
abortion procedure be sent home to 
perform a chemical abortion on herself 
without medical supervision and with-
out her parents’ awareness. Abortion 
on anyone. 
This bill also invalidates State anti-
discrimination laws, which would allow 
babies to be aborted solely because of 
unwanted characteristics, such as their 
race, their sex, or disability. Abortion 
for any reason. 
By prohibiting laws that restrict 
late-term abortions, this bill will allow 
a baby to be aborted up until birth. As 
gestational age is the strongest risk 
factor for abortion-related mortality, 
this bill marks the most egregious 
abortion policy ever considered in Con-
gress. In fact, a woman seeking an 
abortion at 20 weeks is 35 times more 
likely to die from abortion than she 
was in the first trimester. At 21 weeks 
or more, she is 91 times more likely to 
die from abortion than she was in the 
first trimester. Abortion at any time. 
This bill is bad for women, and it is 
bad for babies, directly placing both in 
harm’s way. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this appalling measure. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Thank 
you, Ms. Hartzler, for your leadership 
on all these things. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. LATURNER). 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong opposition to the Women’s 
Health Protection Act, or more accu-
rately, the abortion on demand until 
birth act. 
This legislation imposes on-demand 
abortion until birth, meaning anyone 
can have an abortion for any reason up 
until the day the baby is born. Repub-
licans, and as hard as it is to believe 
now, at one point even some Demo-
crats, have been fighting for pro-life 
protections for decades. This bill re-
moves nearly all protections for the 
unborn at the State and Federal level 
and allows babies to be aborted just 
based on the baby’s sex, race, and dis-
ability. 
Since day one of the Biden adminis-
tration, Democrats have made it their 
goal to push a radical pro-choice agen-
da, and this bill is no exception. 
For months, Democrats have been 
encouraging taxpayer-funded abortions 
in the United States and even going as 
far as limiting healthcare access to ba-
bies that survive abortions. 
My colleagues and I standing up here 
tonight are not the only ones who 
agree that this bill is wrong for our 
country. The Democrats’ radical agen-
da is extremely out of touch with the 
majority of Kansans in my district. In 
fact, over 80 percent of Americans 
agree that abortion should be illegal in 
the third trimester. I am proud to be a 
member of the Pro-Life Caucus where 
we are pushing back to help ensure 
every baby is protected under the law 
and to be a voice for the millions of 
pro-life Americans who will not rest 
until the sanctity of life is protected. 
As my Democrat colleagues continue 
to advance their radical and immoral 
pro-choice agenda, my constituents can 
be 
assured 
that 
I 
will 
always 
unapologetically defend the most vul-
nerable among us, the unborn. And 
may God help us all in this effort. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER), one of the 
most compassionate voices in the Con-
gress. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank my friend for yielding and 
for hosting tonight’s special order.

H5083 
September 22, 2021 
I can attest that the most sacred gift 
we have is our ability to create life. 
Children are the greatest resource of 
our Nation. It doesn’t matter if the un-
born child has a fully-developed heart, 
arms, legs, fingers, toes, or pain recep-
tors, at any time during a pregnancy 
even until birth, Democrats want to 
allow abortions, and they plan to fi-
nance it with your tax dollars. 
And it is a fact when it is legal and 
free, it is an inducement to women who 
find themselves in a hard spot to have 
an abortion. 
I remember seeing the sonogram of 
my first child and all six of my chil-
dren after that. A sonogram is a win-
dow to the womb. 
Interestingly, the Democrats are also 
anti-informed choice. They want to 
rush women through and withhold the 
truth from the pregnant women by 
withholding required sonograms. I have 
spoken to many people involved in the 
industry, and women change their 
minds when they see the baby in the 
womb. 
Hearing the heartbeat, there is no 
doubt that my first daughter was a 
human being. The party that says 
‘‘trust the science’’ would have you 
doubt the humanity of an unborn child. 
b 2000 
The right to life is the first right 
enumerated in the Declaration of Inde-
pendence. House Republicans support a 
culture that defends innocent lives and 
protects the voiceless children in the 
womb. We also want to protect the 
women from making the worst decision 
of their life. This is not about pro-
tecting women. You are making vic-
tims out of the women also. 
Democrats in Congress continue to 
stand in the way of us protecting those 
who cannot protect themselves. The 
American people from all faiths and 
walks of life have to choose what kind 
of society they want to live in, one 
that defends and protects a 9-month 
baby in the womb or one that is going 
to sell its body for parts. 
May we fear God’s coming wrath and 
weep and mourn over this great na-
tional sin. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. I thank 
the gentlewoman for that stark re-
minder. It is certainly what the Found-
ers of this country believed, as she 
noted. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON). 
Mr. Speaker, everyone sees it on the 
news. No one can legitimately deny it. 
Our country is going through the worst 
immigration crisis in the country. 
Now, statistics reported by Customs 
and Border Patrol show that, in August 
2021, our frontline border agents en-
countered 208,000 illegal migrants. That 
is a 317 percent increase from August 
2020, just 1 year ago. 
In total, over 1.3 million illegal 
aliens have crossed our border this 
year alone, and we are on track to 
reach almost 2 million by the end of 
the calendar year. We do not have a se-
cure border. 
Now, with the continued failure of 
the administration to fully use Title 42 
authority to expel illegal immigrants 
and reduce the spread of COVID–19, it 
is not just border communities facing 
the consequences of the Biden adminis-
tration’s policies; it is every commu-
nity. Every State is now a border State 
thanks to the administration’s open 
border policies that have green-lighted 
drug smugglers, human trafficking, 
and other criminal enterprising that 
are finding their way into our commu-
nities. 
Instead of using the Federal Govern-
ment and the resources at its disposal 
to 
protect 
American 
citizens, 
the 
White House and my Democrat col-
leagues are doing nothing, failing to 
even call what we continue to witness 
at the border a crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. We 
must finish the wall to control the cri-
sis at our southern border, and then we 
must consistently implement our im-
migration 
laws. 
Americans 
deserve 
nothing less. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend. He is ex-
actly right. Creating that humani-
tarian disaster on the southern border 
also shows a callous disregard for the 
sanctity of human life. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mrs. 
BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, it ap-
pears that the death of 13 American 
soldiers and the billions in American 
military equipment handed over to ter-
rorists isn’t enough tragedy for my 
Democrat colleagues. 
To continue their legacy of death and 
destruction, progressives decided to 
bring abortion on demand up for a vote 
this week. These baby-killing advo-
cates have been spewing lies and half- 
truths at an alarming rate since heart-
beat bills have been passed by States 
all across the country. So, I thought I 
would just address a few of these lies. 
Lie number one: Abortion is good for 
women. That is some CNN fake news 
right there. 
Women who have an abortion have an 
81 percent increase in risk for mental 
health problems and are 35 percent 
more likely to commit suicide. Abor-
tion doubles the risk of alcoholism for 
women, increases the risk of future 
miscarriages by up to 60 percent, and, 
of course, increases the chances of 
death in the mother. Every abortion 
leaves one dead and one wounded. 
Abortion is bad for women. 
Lie number two: Rape victims need 
abortions. 
Wrong. They need love. They need 
support. They need safety and healing. 
They needed a Glock 19 when it hap-
pened. It is time we start addressing 
killing the raper rather than the baby. 
What isn’t needed is trying to rectify a 
horrible situation through the killing 
of an innocent life. 
Abortion makes up only 3 percent of 
Planned Parenthood’s services. Yep, 
that is lie number 3. Seriously, no one 
believes this. 
Planned Parenthood is America’s 
number one abortion provider. More 
than 96 percent of women who seek 
help at Planned Parenthood have abor-
tions. Planned Parenthood is for wom-
en’s healthcare like Mattress Firm 
sells mattresses. Right. 
And number four: Heartbeat bills re-
strict abortion. 
Actually, this one is true. You are 
damn right they restrict abortion, and 
I am proud to support them. I am 
proud that, in just a few years, because 
of heartbeat bills all across America, 
there will be children enrolling in ele-
mentary schools, laughing and smiling 
because someone took a stand for the 
voiceless. 
God bless these children. God bless 
their mothers. And God bless America. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Amen. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. OWENS). 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Louisiana. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to abortion on demand until birth 
act. I have watched over the last 40 
years as abortionists have targeted my 
race. It was a race that, as a child in 
the 1960s, had more men committed to 
marriage, over 70 percent than any 
other community. Black women were 
more likely to get married than White 
women until 1970. 
In 
that 
community, 
Black 
men 
taught their sons to respect women, to 
honor their wives, and to be stellar ex-
amples for their children. 
Over the last 40 years, my race has 
remained silent as abortionists have 
murdered close to 20 million of our 
children. This equates to 40 percent of 
the Black race exterminated by a 
multibillion-dollar death industry. 
This same industry, and the Demo-
crats who are promoting this bill, are 
teaching our young girls that killing 
their babies after being born alive has 
no consequences, that a living, beating 
heart is nothing more than a hangnail. 
Black women represent 12 percent of 
America’s female population but make 
up almost 40 percent of the women who 
end up on the operating table of a 
wealthy abortionist. 
In civilized countries, the taking of 
20 million lives would be called geno-
cide. The left now calls it choice. 
Over the decades since my youth, we 
have turned more than 70 percent of 
our 
Black 
fathers 
into 
whiners, 
whinnies, and wimps as they, with no 
shame, desert their families. They then 
convince the mothers of their children 
to absolve them of their responsibility, 
to man up, to find the character and 
backbone to provide and protect their 
own namesake and legacy. 
The celebration of the killing our 
most innocent is pure evil, my friends. 
We cannot kill the most innocent 
among us and think we will be blessed.

September 22, 2021 
Take it from someone who has seen 
this movie before. Compare the Black 
family of my youth in the 1950s and 
1960s with the shell of the Black family 
today. 
The pathway to the destruction of 
our precious family unit, manhood, 
womanhood, and our American culture 
begins with the wanton destruction of 
our babies. If we continue to allow this 
to happen to our great Nation, evil 
wins and America loses. I pray that our 
Nation finally turns its back on this 
dark and destructive industry. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, it is pure evil. I thank the 
gentleman for stating it so clearly. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the 
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. CARL). 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to express my opposition to H.R. 3755, 
the abortion on demand act. 
This bill would make permanent a 
law to allow abortion providers to per-
form an abortion for any reason at any 
point in a pregnancy. 
It would also make permanent law a 
woman’s ability to get an abortion for 
any reason and at any point in the 
pregnancy. This is in direct violation 
of countless State and Federal pro-life 
laws. 
By passing this law, pro-abortion 
radicals would eliminate even the most 
basic protection for unborn children at 
any stage in their development. 
It is extremely discouraging to see 
the absolute lack of care for human life 
and basic human dignity. Life is a pre-
cious gift from God, and every human 
is made in God’s image. Every person, 
especially children, should have the in-
herent dignity in the right to life. 
We have a fundamental duty as a so-
ciety to fight for life and to ensure 
that the most vulnerable among us are 
protected. I am proud to be 100 percent 
pro-life, and I will continue fighting 
any efforts by this body to take away 
the rights of the unprotected, unborn, 
and newborn children. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides to reject this abortion on de-
mand act and join me for the fight. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. CARL) so much. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 90 seconds to the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my in-
tense opposition to H.R. 3755, the abor-
tion on demand until birth act. 
States have long had the right, even 
under Roe v. Wade, to pass laws to pro-
tect life and women’s health. But with 
this bill, House Democrats would over-
ride the will of my constituents and 
the 
American 
people, 
eliminating 
State and Federal pro-life laws across 
the country. 
The bill is so extreme that it would 
throw out Utah laws that are actually 
in line with Roe v. Wade. It would over-
turn a Utah law passed in 2006, which 
requires minors to receive parental 
consent before receiving an abortion; a 
Utah law passed in 2012, which requires 
those seeking an abortion to wait 72 
business hours before a face-to-face in-
formational visit and an abortion; and 
a Utah law amended in 2009, which bans 
abortion at the point of viability. 
This bill would legalize in Utah es-
sentially all abortions up until birth. 
The vast majority of my constituents 
in the First District, including those 
on the right, those in the center, and 
those on the left, support commonsense 
protections of third-trimester babies. 
The bipartisan partial-birth abortion 
ban, which protects children from pain-
ful—my wife is 6 months pregnant, 
sorry. It would also explicitly preempt 
the Religious Freedom Restoration Act 
and eliminate conscience rights for 
doctors and nurses who don’t want to 
participate in abortions. 
Our focus in Congress should be ori-
ented toward ensuring every child has 
opportunities, 
no 
matter 
the 
cir-
cumstances of their conception or 
birth, and that pregnant women and 
mothers have the resources they need 
to support the families so they can 
make the right choice. 
Democrats’ radical attempt to fed-
eralize and expand abortion until birth 
is unconscionable in every way for the 
First District of Utah and for our Na-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in adamant opposition to H.R. 
3755. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, it should break our hearts. I 
thank my friend for that authenticity. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER). We began the morning 
in a prayer group, and now we end with 
this. 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak against this uncon-
scionable abortion on demand until 
birth act. I strongly oppose this ex-
treme bill. 
I am a mother and a grandmother of 
two precious grandsons, and I am com-
mitted to protecting the life of the un-
born. As a pharmacist, I have helped 
many women overcome fertility issues 
to be able to give birth to these treas-
ured trusts from Heaven, which sup-
porters of this bill deem expendable 
and nonviable. 
These same women were desperate to 
have and to hold these precious chil-
dren that this bill would make so easy 
to abort for such reasons as inconven-
ience, wrong sex, medical inadequacies, 
and bad timing. The uncompromising 
push to allow on-demand abortions 
until birth is heartbreaking. It would 
overturn almost all pro-life laws put in 
place by States to protect those unborn 
children, including late-term abortion 
bans. 
We cannot allow this to happen. I 
will be voting no on the abortion on de-
mand bill. And let me tell you, when I 
do, I will be thinking of all the pre-
cious 
lives 
that 
have 
been 
saved 
through the very pro-life protections 
that this bill seeks to overturn. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow col-
leagues who care about the sanctity of 
life to join me in opposition. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER), 
who has made a career out of defending 
the defenseless. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the abortion on demand act. 
This week, Democrats have brought 
the so-called Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act to the floor for a vote. This 
grotesque bill would dismantle all ef-
forts by State lawmakers who work on 
behalf of their constituents to protect 
the unborn. 
b 2015 
The passage of pro-life laws in Texas, 
such as the heartbeat bill, has broad 
support in the States in which they are 
enacted. Voters elect Republican legis-
lators to ensure that their values are 
protected and defended. Out-of-touch 
Democrats are overriding the con-
sciences of millions of Americans who 
support the right to life. 
Most egregiously, this bill would le-
galize abortions up through the last 
trimester. Late-term abortions are not 
a healthcare issue; they are a human 
rights issue. 
With this bill, pro-choice colleagues 
fail to address one crucial element, the 
choice of an unborn child to live out 
their God-given destiny. 
Republicans stand ready to give our 
voice to the voiceless and to do every-
thing in our reach to ensure that this 
bill never becomes the law of the land. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. PFLUGER. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana. 
Mr. Speaker, this evening I am here 
with my colleagues in opposition to 
H.R. 3755, a bill that House Democrats 
are pushing this week that would 
eliminate protections for unborn babies 
and establish a nationwide system of 
abortion on demand. 
If enacted, this bill would overrule 
all Federal and State laws that recog-
nize the sanctity of life. Under this 
proposal, an abortion could be per-
formed for any reason at any time up 
until the baby is born. 
Contrary to what some have claimed, 
this bill is not healthcare. It is the 
exact opposite of healthcare, and it 
prioritizes the profits of the abortion 
industry above the sanctity of life. 
Washington Democrats’ pro-abortion 
agenda is appalling, and you can count 
on me to always fight for life and 
shield taxpayer dollars from ever being 
used for abortions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
stand for life and support unborn ba-
bies and vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. PALMER),

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5085 
September 22, 2021 
who is the policy chairman of the Re-
publican Conference. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Louisiana, Rep-
resentative JOHNSON, for arranging this 
Special Order to highlight the devi-
ously entitled Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act and for giving us the oppor-
tunity to speak up for the unborn. 
With this bill, the Democrats have 
actually sought to remove protections 
for women and their babies enacted by 
State legislatures across the country. 
These 
protections 
include 
ensuring 
that abortion providers have the most 
basic of medical credentials, admitting 
privileges at a hospital should an emer-
gency arise as a result of an abortion. 
The bill would also preclude abortion 
clinics from providing information rel-
evant to a woman’s right to know, in-
cluding an ultrasound prior to the pro-
cedure. 
By removing these protections and 
the right of women to be fully in-
formed, the supporters of this bill are 
exposing women to injury and death 
and, in many cases, a lifetime of sor-
row and regret. 
There is another loss that is suffered. 
In the loss of millions of lives not 
lived, this Nation has lost incalculable 
talent, intellect, and achievement of 
those who never lived to bless us with 
the gifts they surely possessed. These 
are children who could have been great 
teachers, doctors, inventors, artists, 
and spiritual leaders. Our lives are less 
today because we never gave them the 
chance to live. 
These were lives that deserved pro-
tection. This bill denies the reality of 
what we have lost and ignores the 
great potential of children whose lives 
will be taken if this bill passes. 
Tonight, I stand in this Chamber to 
declare that the lives of those lost to 
abortion mattered, and we are less as a 
Nation because of it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, 
both Democrats and Republicans, to 
oppose this bill and to stand not just 
for the lives of unborn children but 
also for the enormous potential that 
those lives have. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 3755 and 
embrace life and all its potential. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Alabama. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. 
FISCHBACH). 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Louisiana for 
hosting this Special Order to discuss 
the abortion on demand act. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill imposes na-
tional abortion on demand until birth, 
abolishing all past, present, and future 
State laws on this topic. Not only does 
this pose a grave threat to States’ 
rights, but it will also harm countless 
babies and women along the way. 
During Rules Committee, I asked a 
simple question: Does anything in this 
bill 
actually 
have 
any 
reasonable 
health benefit for women? And the an-
swer is, no, it does not. The bill the 
Democrats name the Women’s Health 
Protection Act has nothing to do with 
women’s health. 
This bill would wipe out countless 
State laws that protect women and ba-
bies, like clinic regulation and paren-
tal notice, including a law I shepherded 
through the Minnesota State Legisla-
ture on women’s right to know. This 
law simply requires a physician to pro-
vide a woman seeking an abortion in-
formation about medical risks. 
I can’t imagine a world in which a 
physician performs a non-emergent 
medical procedure on any person with-
out explaining their options and risks 
beforehand, but that is apparently the 
world my Democrat colleagues want to 
live in. 
As a co-chair of the Congressional 
Pro-Life Caucus, one of my highest pri-
orities as a Member of Congress is pro-
tecting innocent life. This bill is a di-
rect, tragic attack on life, and I urge 
my colleagues to oppose it. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
her leadership on the issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana, 
my dear friend. I am honored to be here 
and to stand with you and so many of 
my colleagues who believe, like we in 
west Texas believe unquestionably and 
unequivocally, that life is sacred, and 
it is a gift from God. We celebrate that, 
and we praise God for that. 
We also believe that whether you are 
2 weeks in the womb as an unborn cit-
izen of this great country or you are 2 
years old or you are 22, you deserve the 
constitutionally protected right to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
If anybody questioned whether the 
Democratic Party has been hijacked by 
the radical left, look no further than 
H.R. 3755, abortion on demand for any 
reason at any time, right up until the 
child is born, when the child is viable 
to 
live 
independently 
outside 
the 
womb, when the child can feel pain in 
the termination of its life. 
Mr. Speaker, this would put us on par 
with the likes of North Korea, China, 
and only seven countries in the world 
that allow for late-term abortions. 
It usurps States’ sovereign rights to 
determine their values and their cul-
ture of life and to restrict reasonably 
this horrible procedure where people 
would abort a child simply because 
they didn’t get a boy when they wanted 
a girl, or somehow they discovered that 
the child has Down syndrome. 
They can’t put these reasonable pro-
tections in place because this is yet an-
other top-down from Washington, a 
one-size-fits-all to impose Washington 
values on the American people. 
I can just tell you, Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud of Texas’ record of passing pro- 
life legislation that reflects the pro-life 
values of the people of Texas. 
I stand against H.R. 3755. As for me 
and my house and the people of west 
Texas, we stand for life, which is why 
we oppose this. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend. Well said. 
God bless Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise with 
my colleagues in support of life and 
against the so-called Women’s Health 
Protection Act, which would radically 
expand abortion nationwide through 
all 9 months of pregnancy. 
Importantly, rather than protecting 
women and their children, it removes 
essential protections that are cur-
rently in place for both of them. 
Here is what the bill does instead. It 
abolishes informed consent laws that 
ensure parental involvement in the de-
cisions of their children. It abolishes 
laws that regulate the prescribing or 
dispensing of dangerous chemical abor-
tion drugs. 
Think about this for a minute. This 
bill would prohibit laws that actually 
protect women from the harms of a 
dangerous, 
do-it-yourself 
chemical 
abortion without seeing a doctor first. 
It abolishes laws that regulate or re-
strict abortions performed via tele-
medicine. It abolishes health and safe-
ty regulations for abortion clinics. It 
abolishes waiting period laws. It abol-
ishes laws that prevent abortion prior 
to fetal viability, legislatively impos-
ing the viability rule. 
In addition, the bill would strip the 
rights of States to pass lifesaving regu-
lations on abortion and also requires 
that new pro-life laws be approved by 
the Department of Justice before tak-
ing effect. 
The radical nature of this bill goes so 
far as to make it impossible to protect 
unborn children who have been diag-
nosed with Down syndrome or other 
fetal anomaly diagnoses from selective 
abortions, as well as enabling sex-se-
lection 
abortions. 
It 
denies 
basic 
science. 
But here is what we do know. At 6 
weeks, the unborn baby has a heart-
beat of approximately 98 beats per 
minute. By 10 weeks, the unborn baby 
has arms and legs, fingers and toes, and 
is sucking his or her thumb. By 15 
weeks, all of the unborn baby’s major 
organs have formed. They can feel 
pain, and surgeries have been success-
fully performed on unborn babies at 
this age. 
That is why I strongly oppose H.R. 
3755. Since my first day in Congress, I 
have stood to protect life and be a 
voice for the defenseless, and I won’t 
stop now. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. CLINE has done that, in-
deed, and I am grateful for his leader-
ship. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
CAWTHORN). 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, diplo-
macy with a tyrant is useless.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5086 
September 22, 2021 
Joe Biden does not sympathize with 
the plight of States fighting the border 
crisis. He revels in it. This is his 
dream: open borders and American car-
nage. 
Joe Biden has backed Republican 
Governors into a corner. They are in 
fight or flight mode. Sending letters 
like this one demanding a meeting 
with him on the border is not in the 
fight mode we need. To him, and the 
American people, it is a white flag of 
surrender. 
Republican Governors, do something. 
You are writing letters to a man who 
does not give a damn about you. He 
does not care about your plight. He 
does not care about your State. He 
does not care about you. Stop sending 
letters and start taking action. 
Stand up and defend your State 
today. You have the power. Use it. You 
have the resources. Use them. You 
have the National Guard. Use it. Do 
whatever it takes because the Demo-
crats, hellbent on radicalizing Amer-
ica, are barreling over us with their 
agenda while we push paper. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
responsibility 
has fallen to our Republican Governors 
to have to defend our borders and de-
fend our country. If they fail in this 
plight, then we will not have a country 
to remember. 
Please, do the job that has, unfortu-
nately, fallen on your shoulders. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
those comments. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President, and Members are also re-
minded to address their remarks to the 
Chair and not to a perceived viewing 
audience. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP-
SON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight during 
this Special Order to speak in opposi-
tion to H.R. 3755, the Women’s Health 
Protection Act. It is misappropriately 
named, given the many unborn girls, 
women, and boys that will be murdered 
should this act be enacted. 
b 2030 
Earlier this year I spoke on the floor 
defending the Hyde amendment as 
Democrats, for the first time in over 
four decades, decided to remove it from 
the fiscal year 2022 appropriations. 
Tonight, I am back to fight for the 
rights of the unborn as Democrats at-
tempt to push through another item of 
their radical pro-abortion agenda. This 
legislation is extreme. It would impose 
nationwide abortion on demand until 
birth laws making every State a late- 
term abortion State. 
This bill would create a national 
standard to allow for abortions for any 
reason and at any stage of pregnancy. 
It would abolish virtually all past, 
present, and future pro-life State laws, 
ultimately overriding State laws that 
prevent discriminatory abortions based 
on the identity of the baby—of the yet- 
to-be-born child—and based on a baby’s 
sex, race, or disability. 
We should be putting forth legisla-
tion supporting a culture that values 
life and respects the health of mothers 
and children, born and unborn. We 
must always be a voice for the voice-
less, and that is why I will continue to 
fight for the lives of the unborn. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
gentleman for leading this Special 
Order. It is a righteous cause. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I am grateful for the leader-
ship of my friend. 
Mr. Speaker, I am running out of 
time here, but in the very short few 
seconds I have remaining, I just want 
to reiterate what all my colleagues 
shared with such compassion, convic-
tion, and clarity here on the floor to-
night. H.R. 3755, the abortion on de-
mand until birth legislation, is, as we 
said, brazen. It is dark, and it is one of 
the most extreme bills imaginable, cer-
tainly ever presented on this floor. We 
pray that it is defeated, and we will 
work to defeat it, we owe that to the 
American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I know my time has ex-
pired, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
f 
THE GREEN NEW DEAL PUTS 
CHINA FIRST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
GREENE) for 30 minutes. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, today, I would like to talk about 
the Green New Deal. This is a serious 
issue right now. It used to be a piece of 
legislation that most Republicans in 
the country laughed at and thought 
was some sort of high school project 
turned in as a House resolution, but it 
is actually something that America 
needs to take seriously because it is 
written in the infrastructure bill and it 
is written in the $3.5 trillion budget. So 
the Green New Deal is rapidly becom-
ing a very real reality for America, 
which is tragic. 
The first thing I would like to talk 
about is that I am always shocked, as 
a freshman Member of Congress, in the 
dysfunction of Congress. 
You see, Mr. Speaker, tonight I am 
starting a speech that was difficult to 
schedule, not knowing when I would be 
able to start the speech based on the 
House floor constantly changing. But 
this is the order of affairs in Wash-
ington that is always shocking to me. 
I come from the private sector in the 
real world where people work every 
single day, do a good job, solve prob-
lems, and they make a profit. But the 
difference in the real world and what I 
would consider a very messed up world 
here in Washington, D.C., is here in 
Congress everything is upside down. We 
are not able to keep a schedule that 
runs well. As a matter of fact, it runs 
wrong most of the time. 
Another problem is that everything 
that is produced with the taxpayer dol-
lars here in Congress produces a loss 
continuing to keep the American peo-
ple in debt. Everything that happens 
here in Congress is shocking to me be-
cause I can’t believe how opposite the 
bills and the discussions are of what 
freedom stands for and our Constitu-
tion, especially on the wall where it 
says: In God We Trust. 
So as just a regular American citizen 
who decided to run for Congress and 
won my race representing Georgia’s 
14th district, I am here to speak on be-
half of the American people and how 
outraged we are at the policies of the 
Green New Deal, which are in the $1.2 
trillion infrastructure bill and the $3.5 
trillion budget because these policies 
are the most America-last policies. As 
a matter of fact, they do nothing but 
put China first. 
So we will go ahead and address what 
these policies are that are so shocking 
to me. If the American people actually 
knew what these globalist, America- 
last policies are, I believe they would 
be ringing every single phone up here 
probably demanding that Congress go 
home because America is only safe 
when Congress is out of session. But, 
unfortunately, Congress is in session, 
so let’s tell the truth about what is 
happening. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a simple meme 
that you would find on the internet, 
but this meme is very real. The Green 
New Deal surprise is that it serves 
China and China only. 
So today, talking about the Green 
New Deal and the all-out war on the 
men and women who built this coun-
try—which 
is 
definitely 
happening 
every single day here in Congress— 
Democrats want to turn the lights out 
on America. They want to shut down 
our economy, they want to end our en-
ergy independence and surrender Amer-
ica, putting us on our knees to China— 
dependent on China, yes, just to drive a 
car or a truck. That is not in some dis-
tant time in the future. That is pretty 
soon, especially in less than 10 years. 
In his last 6 months as President, Joe 
Biden has demonstrated that he would 
rather listen to BERNIE SANDERS, AOC, 
and the climate Democrats who want 
to do what is ‘‘best for America.’’ 
He is raising an army of vaccine po-
lice and climate justice troops to track 
your every single move. Yes, American 
citizens, the government wants to 
track you. 
On top of that, Democrats in Con-
gress are happy to take every penny of 
Americans’ hard-earned paycheck to 
destroy our economy through the so- 
called Green New Deal—a complete 
government take-over of every aspect 
of our lives under the excuse of so- 
called climate justice. 
This is not a theoretical idea for 
these 
people, 
unfortunately.

September 22, 2021 
Speaker, you would think it is a joke, 
but it is not. No. They want to trans-
form America into a Third World coun-
try, and that is exactly what these 
policies will do. 
To quote Senator ED MARKEY: 
The Green New Deal isn’t just a reso-
lution, it is a revolution. In the past 2 
years, the Green New Deal has become 
the DNA of climate action. And the 
principles of jobs, justice, and climate 
action are now widely represented in 
legislation and State and local actions 
across the country. 
The Green New Deal provides the 
framework we need to confront the 
intersecting crises our country faces— 
climate change, a public health pan-
demic, racial injustice, and economic 
inequality. We can transform our econ-
omy and our democracy for all Ameri-
cans by addressing the generational 
challenge of climate change. We have 
the technology to do it. We have the 
economic imperative. We have the 
moral obligation. We just need the po-
litical will. 
So let’s talk a little bit more about 
the people who believe in this. One of 
my colleagues here in the House of 
Representatives is a Democrat from 
New York. I had asked her to debate 
this policy because I believe in debate. 
I believe the American people deserve 
to know exactly what is in these bills 
and the outcome and the effect on the 
economy. 
As a successful business owner who 
makes a profit and not a loss, I would 
like to debate my colleague from New 
York and talk to her about how her 
policies are actually going to destroy 
jobs and do nothing for the climate, be-
cause the reality is the climate has 
changed in the entire history of the 
Earth and no amount of taxes that 
anyone can pay is going to change the 
climate. That is just the truth. That is 
not made up like climate change and 
climate justice. 
So 
according 
to 
Congresswoman 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, the dozens of bills that 
have sprung from this resolution since 
we introduced it 2 years ago all con-
tain, number one, a commitment to 
creating good paying union jobs; num-
ber two, prioritizing frontline and vul-
nerable 
communities 
disproportion-
ately affected by climate change. 
I didn’t know the climate affected 
some communities and not others. I am 
from Georgia. It is pretty hot and 
humid. I didn’t know it had anything 
to do with the color of our skin or how 
much money that we made, but, appar-
ently, according to Congresswoman 
OCASIO-CORTEZ, it does. 
Number three, Mr. Speaker, she says 
that reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
from human sources by 40 to 60 percent 
within 10 years and net zero global 
emissions by 2050 is in line with the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change which is finding that global 
temperatures must not increase more 
than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-in-
dustrialized levels in order to avoid the 
most severe impacts of climate change. 
I find it pretty shocking that people 
actually think that Members of Con-
gress and their legislation is actually 
going to control the Earth’s tempera-
ture or the climate. Really what all of 
this is going to do is help this man out 
the most, President Xi of China. It is 
sad, really, really sad. 
The White House proudly stated that 
President Biden rejoined the Paris 
Agreement on day one and organized a 
national climate task force to estab-
lish a new 2030 emissions target. In 
April, President Biden committed to 
having greenhouse gas emissions cut in 
half by 2030 and creating a carbon pol-
lution-free power sector by 2035. As 
other countries race past us, President 
Biden wants to dismantle and cripple 
the United States’ energy grid in order 
to look good at climate events in Eu-
rope while China laughs at our decline. 
Oh, yes, President Xi will be laugh-
ing, and he is already laughing at 
President Joe Biden right now because 
President Xi himself knows one thing 
very clearly: if we are going to reduce 
our carbon emissions by cutting them 
down in half by 2030, that means we are 
cutting our economy in half by 2030. 
So President Xi of China, who is very 
clever and thinks the long game, is 
planning on ramping up his economy, 
as a matter of fact, increasing carbon 
output, he says, until at least 2035. And 
then while President Joe Biden says: 
Oh, well, America’s carbon will be net 
zero by 2050; President Xi is still laugh-
ing saying: Oh, well, maybe China can 
try to get to net zero by 2060. 
Mr. Speaker, China is gaming us at 
our own stupidity. We have a President 
in the White House who is looking to 
do everything he can to serve China, 
and maybe that will help out his son in 
his business dealings in foreign coun-
tries like China. 
Under the woke ideology of Biden’s 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency, 
public waters could mean any source of 
standing water the government feels 
constitutes 
Waters 
of 
the 
United 
States. 
What does that apply to? 
Does that apply to someone’s pond on 
their private land or a private lake on 
someone’s farm? 
What does that apply to, Mr. Speak-
er, a puddle in your front yard or your 
swimming pool in your backyard? 
Are those going to be considered 
Waters of the United States so the Fed-
eral Government can come and say 
whatever they want to do with them? 
Who knows? 
That means the Federal Government 
can claim jurisdiction over millions of 
acres of privately owned land and 
water under the excuse of ensuring 
conservation. 
The Federal Government thinks it 
knows better than the American peo-
ple. 
Mr. Speaker, here is the truth: fami-
lies 
who 
have 
passed 
down 
land 
through generations could see their 
property carved up and controlled by 
bureaucrats in Washington. I think 
this past year has shown that bureau-
crats in Washington are the ones 
screwing everything up. 
Biden’s executive order implements a 
socialist agenda by creating well-pay-
ing union jobs, including more for 
women and people of color in occupa-
tions where they are underrepresented 
to combat the climate crisis and re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions, seques-
ter carbon in soils, grasses, trees, and 
other vegetation and source of sustain-
able bio-products and fuels, cows, cow 
flatulence, and whatever else. 
Biden’s policies regarding electric ve-
hicles and batteries could cripple the 
American economy, and this is where 
the real danger lies. 
b 2045 
The infrastructure plan, which the 
Speaker would very much like to pass, 
the Progressives would very much like 
the $1.2 trillion infrastructure deal, 
matched with the $3.5 trillion budget, 
because that is the whole package of 
the Green New Deal, and they would 
have a lot to celebrate. 
This plan includes $7.5 billion, this is 
in the infrastructure, billion for a net-
work of 500,000 electric vehicle charg-
ing stations across the country and an-
other $7.5 billion for electric buses. 
So this is a situation where the gov-
ernment has decided to take over the 
economy. This is what the Green New 
Deal does. You see, in the past—unfor-
tunately, I don’t know why it is chang-
ing, because the past has actually 
worked pretty well—our economy has 
worked on demand. 
When there is consumer demand in 
the marketplace, businesses, private 
businesses—not the government, by the 
way—would produce their products and 
sell their goods to match the consumer 
demand. That is what happens in a 
healthy economy. 
Currently, right now, this is Amer-
ica’s charging network. As you can see, 
electric vehicle charging stations al-
ready exist over much of America, and 
the good news is, they are pretty much 
able to meet the demand, no problem, 
because electric vehicles run on bat-
teries that can keep a charge and the 
technology is increasing and they can 
keep charges for a good long distance, 
some of them 300 miles or more. And so 
people are able to drive and find an-
other charging station and charge their 
vehicle, and that is because this exists, 
mostly, through a private market, a 
private economy, through businesses 
meeting the public demand. 
But that is not what the Democrats 
want to do. That is not what they want 
to continue to exist. No, they want to 
use the power of the Federal Govern-
ment and radically change the way 
Americans drive, because your cars and 
trucks would have to drive on bat-
teries, not gasoline or diesel. 
So right now, currently, there are al-
ready 44,000 public charging stations in 
the U.S. President Biden has even pro-
posed 
spending 
nearly 
$6 
billion 
transitioning the entire Federal fleet

the Speaker of the House, the Demo-
crats, everyone is on board with this 
right here, spending $7.5 billion of 
Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars 
that they had to work for and then the 
IRS collects, so that the government 
can force us to move to electric vehi-
cles by building another 500,000 electric 
vehicle charging stations. 
Why would they have to do that? 
That is because they are going to force 
you to drive an electric vehicle that 
uses a battery. And then they want to 
spend more of your tax dollars, $7.5 bil-
lion for electric buses, and then more 
of your tax dollars, $6 billion, as a mat-
ter of fact, to transition the whole Fed-
eral fleet to electric vehicles. This is so 
shocking. 
Here, let’s go further. What else dam-
age has he done? 
He terminated the Keystone XL pipe-
line—that happened first in his presi-
dency—according to the pipeline’s de-
veloper, which caused 1,000 union work-
ers to immediately lose their jobs. By 
the way, that was the same union that 
voted for President Biden. They backed 
him and supported him. 
But what did he do right away? He 
made a decision to kill their jobs and 
ended a project that was expected to 
employ more than 11,000 Americans in 
2021. 
Democrats are job killers, and Joe 
Biden is doing a great job of it. 
The majority of them, union work-
ers, by the way. Isn’t unions what all 
the people that are for the Green New 
Deal want? The majority of the union 
workers, hurting these jobs, 11,000 of 
them. 
But what did it do? It cost them $1.6 
billion in wages. Cost them $1.6 billion 
in wages. It is so shocking you can’t 
even make it up. Unfortunately, it is 
real. 
By the end of President Biden’s first 
term, his ban on new oil and gas leases 
on Federal land, according to one 
study, would destroy an average of 
58,676 jobs annually. And what we have 
seen over the past year and a half is so 
many destroyed already by COVID 
shutdowns. That is unbelievable. 
And for the people at home that work 
so hard in small businesses, that I to-
tally understand because that is all I 
have ever done my entire life is been a 
small business owner, it is heart-
breaking how many small businesses 
have shut down over the past year and 
a half to COVID shutdowns. But yet, 
then we have a President in the White 
House and a Democrat-controlled Con-
gress that wants to continue to force 
this to happen. Unbelievable. 
Biden has also signed executive or-
ders to raise the social cost of carbon, 
the social cost of carbon, by 700 per-
cent. What this means for Americans is 
that the price of gas will go up; heating 
your home in the winter will become 
more expensive; and electric bills will 
go up. This will especially take a toll 
on our fellow citizens who are already 
struggling to get by as it is. So we will 
make the poor poorer after we have al-
ready cost them their jobs by these 
fatal climate change policies. 
In 2019, the United States became en-
ergy independent—what an amazing 
thing that was—and exported more en-
ergy than it took in for the first time 
since 1952. Let’s say that again. 
In 2019, the United States became en-
ergy independent and exported more 
energy than it took in for the first 
time since 1952. I would like to thank 
President Donald J. Trump for that 
and his America first policies. Sadly, 
they are no more. 
Part of this came from the fact that 
the U.S. exported more natural gas 
than ever before, partially because the 
United States transitioned away from 
coal to natural gas. Our carbon emis-
sions 
shrunk—wow, 
isn’t 
that 
the 
goal—which allowed the U.S. to lead 
the world in reducing energy-related 
CO2 emissions. 
But let’s get back to electric vehi-
cles, because this is what is going to 
truly affect every single American that 
drives a car or a truck or relies on a ve-
hicle to get to work or, let’s just be 
real, as a taxpayer. 
After years of planning, China domi-
nates the world’s production of new 
generation batteries that are used in 
electric vehicles, most portable con-
sumer electronics, such as cell phones 
and laptops. 
I don’t know if anyone realizes this, 
but right now there is over 50,000 
trucks sitting, brand new trucks sit-
ting in Kentucky. Do you want to 
know why they can’t be sold? They are 
waiting on microchips; and the reason 
why they are waiting on microchips is 
because China dominates the market, 
because they dominate the market of 
rare earth minerals. They dominate 
creating them; they dominate the mar-
ket that creates microchips; and they 
dominate the market that creates 
Lithium batteries that drive cars, elec-
tric vehicles. 
So, as the demand for electric vehi-
cles grows, it is expected that most of 
them will be built with Chinese bat-
teries. That is because China domi-
nates the market at 80 percent. And 
America barely competes at 10 percent. 
This doesn’t look good for our econ-
omy, does it? 
We have a Federal Government, a 
Democrat-controlled Federal Govern-
ment, a Democrat-controlled Congress, 
that wants to transition our economy 
that 
is 
already 
functioning 
really 
well—our 
Americans 
businesses 
do 
well—but we want to move it to rely on 
basically one country, China, Com-
munist China, who is not our friend, 
who is our enemy, and sent us the 
COVID virus that we are already stag-
gering from, from the past year and 
half. 
But yet, it is our own government 
that wants to cripple us and put us on 
our knees to rely on China that domi-
nates this market for our battery 
needs, from our federally-forced elec-
tric vehicles, coming soon to you by 
2030. It is pretty unbelievable. 
So, of the 136 Lithium ion battery 
plants in the pipeline that are going to 
be to 2029, 101 of those are based in 
China. China dominates the battery 
market, ladies and gentlemen. 
The pace of demand growth is ex-
pected to rise rapidly over the next few 
years as sales of electric vehicles are 
slated to reach 12.2 million in 2025, so 
we are going to continually—the more 
electric vehicles that we are forced to 
drive because the Federal Government 
has decided that that is how the pri-
vate market should go. Isn’t that inter-
esting? 
Since when in America should the 
government decide how the private 
market should buy and sell? But that 
is what is in the $1.2 trillion infrastruc-
ture deal; and that is what is in the $3.5 
trillion budget; and that is what is in 
the Green New Deal. 
So hear we have—this is a really in-
teresting chart. This shows you the 
production of how you get an electric 
vehicle. Right here, you can see stage 
one is mining. Let me tell you the per-
centages here that the U.S. competes. 
For nickel, 0 percent; cobalt, 0 per-
cent; graphite, 0 percent; Lithium—oh, 
we got 1 percent for lithium. That is 
what goes in the electric vehicle bat-
tery. Zero percent for manganese. 
Okay, we have—China’s doing really 
well. They have got 31 percent, 1 per-
cent, 65 percent, there is 0, then we got 
6 percent, right here, stage one mining. 
But don’t count them out on that. 
Let me show you. Global share pro-
duction. This is in 2019. Stage one, 
chemical processing refining. Let’s go 
with America and China. Nickel, 1 per-
cent; cobalt, 0; graphite, 0; Lithium, 4 
percent. Ooh, we moved up a little bit. 
Then we got this last one, manganese, 
at 0 percent. 
Oh, but China is doing really well. 
They are at nickel with 65 percent; co-
balt, 82 percent; graphite, 100 percent. 
Geez, I would say that is complete 
domination. 
Uh oh, then we went up with lithium 
at 59 percent. Yeah, China is doing 
pretty good. 
Let’s go down here. What happens in 
stage three? We have got the cathode 
of anode production. So what happens 
here? What is going on with America? 
Zero percent for cathode. Zero per-
cent for anode. But what does China 
have? Oh, 61 percent for cathode and 83 
percent for anode. 
So here you see, America is not doing 
well. But guess what? President Joe 
Biden and the Democrats in Congress, 
and I am sure the Democrats in the 
Senate, would love to force you to be 
dependent on everything that goes into 
an electric vehicle. And you can see by 
the percentages I am telling you, 
America doesn’t compete. That is 
America last. That puts our businesses, 
our American businesses, our American 
workers completely dependent on Com-
munist China. No thank you. 
Let’s go a little further. What hap-
pens in stage four? Well, here is the

really important part. Stage four is 
Lithium ion battery cell manufac-
turing. And this is something that I 
don’t think my colleague from New 
York, who cosponsored this little deal 
that we are having to deal with now, 
quite 
understands. 
Apparently, 
she 
knows the economy, but she wouldn’t 
debate me, so I don’t know how that 
works out. 
You see, when it comes to producing 
the cells, this is where we have a prob-
lem. We have right here, 6 percent with 
the European Union. We have the 
United States at 10 percent, and ac-
cording to this one, China has 73 per-
cent. And now they are increasing, be-
cause you know what happened in Af-
ghanistan? We walked away from $1 
trillion worth of rare earth mineral 
mines. Why did we do that? 
So, what goes into an electric vehi-
cle? Just a battery. That is what 
makes it drive. And as you can see, 
China dominates and America is barely 
a speck in the economy and the market 
share for Lithium batteries. 
So rare earth minerals. Let’s talk 
about rare earth minerals. I just named 
some of them that go into the battery 
production, that affect batteries for 
electric 
vehicles. 
They 
affect 
microchips that are very important, 
such as the trucks, over 50,000—it is 
probably even more now that can’t be 
sold because we are waiting on these. 
Don’t 
forget 
appliances 
like 
dish-
washers, 
refrigerators, 
cell 
phones, 
computers, they all rely on rare earth 
minerals, and America is not com-
peting very well in this market. But 
China is. 
According to the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey, China currently producers ap-
proximately 84 percent of the world’s 
rare earth minerals, while the U.S. 
only produces 4 percent, a portion of 
which is owned by, guess who, the Chi-
nese. How about that? 
The estimated value of rare earth 
compounds and metals imported by the 
United States increased by 10 million 
from 2018 to 2019. That is a big market 
because everybody knows that this has 
been the goal for quite a time. 
There was a decline last year due to 
COVID. Well, everything shut down. 
But these numbers are sure to keep ris-
ing, and they are sure to keep rising 
because we have a government forcing 
us to these policies. We are being 
forced through these bills that we are 
working on and going to be voting on 
very soon. We are going to be forced to 
rely on rare earth minerals that, by 
the way, I just told you the U.S. only 
produces at 4 percent, but the Com-
munist Chinese produce at 84 percent. 
This is a big problem. That is China 
first, America last. 
b 2100 
China is already one of the top five 
producers of lithium. They are not just 
barely one; they are number one. They 
are buying up most of the reserves in 
Australia. Why? Because China listens 
and pays attention. Well, we know they 
listen. They listen more than we want 
them to. 
Joe Biden didn’t just abandon our fel-
low citizens in Afghanistan. He also 
left behind valuable resources to the 
Taliban. 
Let’s just show them that. 
Not only did we abandon Americans 
in Afghanistan, which was shocking— 
because in America we always thought 
the rule was ‘‘no man left behind’’—we 
abandoned Americans. We armed the 
Taliban, a radical Islamic terrorist-run 
nation, with $85 billion worth of the 
world’s best military equipment and 
weapons. We also left behind $1 trillion 
in rare earth minerals. Can you believe 
that? 
We didn’t even negotiate for them. 
But do you know who did? China did. 
China has moved in and is negotiating 
a deal with Afghanistan for this $1 tril-
lion worth of rare earth minerals. They 
also just made a 25-year deal with Iran, 
and they are working very hard on the 
Belt and Road project that will go 
right through Afghanistan to Iran. 
You see, these deals, the infrastruc-
ture deal, the $3.5 trillion budget the 
Democrats in Congress know all the de-
tails to, are putting America last, are 
going to force every single American to 
have to drive a Communist Chinese 
battery just to get to work or go to the 
store. 
And then guess what? When the bat-
tery runs out and you need a new one, 
you know what is going to happen to 
you? You are going to have to order it 
from China. Hopefully, there will be no 
more COVID shutdowns, and hopefully, 
you can get your Communist Chinese 
battery in time so you can start driv-
ing your government-forced electric 
vehicle. 
This is an unbelievable thing. As a 
private business owner for over two 
decades, I cannot believe that our Fed-
eral Government is putting Americans 
in this position. I don’t care if you are 
a Democrat or a Republican or if you 
don’t care about politics, you should 
care about this because these are the 
policies that are going to destroy our 
economy and destroy our country. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the 
time remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 30 seconds remaining. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, what I would like to say is, I would 
like to appeal to my Democrat col-
leagues. Don’t force us, don’t force the 
American people, to rely on Com-
munist China by taking over our pri-
vate market and forcing the American 
people to have to rely on Communist 
China just to drive a car and a truck. 
Don’t force Americans into this situa-
tion with their own tax dollars. And 
stop worshiping the fake climate reli-
gion. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, whose plans stand firm 
forever, You test the motives of our 
hearts. Today, give our lawmakers 
such ethical consistency that their mo-
tives will remain pure. May love for 
You become the dominant motivation 
for all they think, say, and do. 
As they strive to live according to 
Your precepts, fill their hearts with 
songs of gratitude. Lord, remind them 
that this day is a gift from You, so 
they should rejoice because of the 
blessing of another sunrise. 
We pray in Your generous Name. 
Amen.

f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday evening, the House of Rep-
resentatives approved a continuing res-
olution that will keep the government 
open through December, provide emer-
gency funding for Afghan refugees and 
Americans affected by natural disas-
ters, and suspend the debt ceiling 
through the end of 2022. 
The bill now comes to the Senate, 
where both parties must pass it to-
gether to steer the United States away 
from a number of fast-approaching cri-
ses. Absent congressional action, the 
government will shut down in just over 
a week. The United States could face a 
first-ever default soon thereafter, and 
it will be American families who will 
suffer most. 
Now our Republican colleagues say 
they don’t want a shutdown. They say 
they don’t want a credit default. They 
say they want hurricane aid. Then they 
should vote yes on this bill. 
You want to avoid a default, Repub-
lican colleagues? Vote yes. 
You want to avoid a government 
shutdown? Vote yes. 
You want to provide hurricane aid? 
Vote yes. 
You want to help the Afghan refu-
gees? Vote yes. 
That is the bill that will be on the 
floor. Those who will vote yes will vote 
to avoid default, to avoid a government 
shutdown. 
Those who vote no will be saying: We 
are OK with default and we are OK 
with a government shutdown. 
To say, ‘‘Do it another way,’’ that 
doesn’t cut it. This is what is on the 
floor. This is what the House passed. 
And, again, the kind of sophistry that 
we have heard from the Republican 
leader doesn’t make any sense, either 
through past history or through practi-
cality and what we need today. 
At the end of the day, it is how we 
vote that matters most. Our constitu-
ents sent us here to vote, plain and 
simple. So Republicans face a choice. 
Vote yes to pay our bills and keep the 
government open; or vote no, which 
means you are OK with default and a 
government shutdown. 
Every single Democrat will support 
this bill. Whether or not we avoid de-
fault is simply entirely up to the Re-
publican Senators. It is up to them, 
plain and simple. 
The President has the proposal. The 
House has passed the proposal. I will 
put that proposal on the Senate floor. 
And remember, this is not just a po-
litical fight. The last time Republicans 
played with the debt ceiling in 2011, the 
credit of the United States was down-
graded for the first time ever. And all

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6596 
September 22, 2021 
indications are that if Republicans suc-
ceed in causing a default this time 
around, the consequences will be cata-
strophic. 
According to a sobering new analysis 
by Mark Zandi at Moody’s Analytics, a 
default would erase up to 6 million jobs 
in the economy. It would cause unem-
ployment, which we have worked so 
hard to bring down during this COVID 
season, to spike up again to as much as 
9 percent. And as much as $15 trillion 
of household wealth will be wiped out 
of existence. Every American family 
will suffer from the Republican desire 
to play political games and send our 
Nation into default. 
Let me say that again: $15 trillion of 
household wealth. And that means 
thousands of dollars for each family— 
for many families—thousands. 
That is not fair. All for the sake, 
Leader MCCONNELL, of a political gain. 
Political gain. It is an incomprehen-
sible number. I can’t think of a worse 
gut punch to the American people who 
spent the last 19 months fighting 
against the COVID–19 pandemic than 
to see their life savings disappear be-
cause Republicans won’t pay the bills 
and are simply trying to gain mere po-
litical advantage. 
There is no scenario on God’s green 
Earth where it is worth risking 6 mil-
lion jobs, 9 percent unemployment, and 
$15 trillion of household wealth just to 
stick it to your political opponents. 
But that seems to be the MO these 
days of the Republican leader: not car-
ing at all about the American people 
and what matters to them and playing 
political games in an effort—I believe a 
futile effort—to gain political advan-
tage. 
It won’t succeed. Everyone knows 
who is doing what around here. 
So, over the past few weeks, Repub-
licans have advanced a number of dis-
honest and duplicitous arguments to 
rationalize their opposition to the debt 
ceiling, to play political games that 
the minority leader is involved in. 
I expect we will be hearing these ar-
guments over and over again, so let’s 
set the record straight on two of their 
main points. 
First, our Republican colleagues have 
argued that raising the debt ceiling 
should exclusively be the domain of 
one party when it controls all three 
branches of government. Of course, this 
is nonsense. 
Since 1960, the debt ceiling has been 
raised about 80 times under both uni-
fied and divided government. 
As recently as 2017, Leader MCCON-
NELL, as majority leader, put forward a 
bill to raise the debt ceiling when there 
was a Republican President, a Repub-
lican Senate, and a Republican House; 
urged Democrats to join him. 
And, of course, we did because it is 
the right thing to do. We don’t want to 
hurt the American people. We don’t 
want to play games with the livelihood 
of Americans the way the Republican 
leader seems to revel in doing. And 
rather than play political games and 
rather than engage in an ill-considered 
game of chicken, Democrats worked 
with the other side. 
Second and even far more dishonest, 
Republicans say they don’t want to 
raise the debt ceiling because they 
don’t want to clear the way for more 
domestic spending. This statement is 
false, pure and simple. 
Our proposal to suspend the debt ceil-
ing is not about future spending. Rais-
ing the debt ceiling is about paying the 
bills that have already been racked up. 
The proposal the House sent over is de-
signed to help pay for the $908 billion 
that we approved last year in the 
depths of the COVID crisis. 
That legislation was drafted by Re-
publicans, voted for by Republicans, 
put on the floor by Leader MCCONNELL, 
and signed by a Republican President. 
It is the Trump debt—the Trump 
debt—that we now must pay. 
For Republicans, after voting for it, 
after going back to their districts and 
claiming credit for some of the things 
in that bill, to now decide they have 
changed their minds and they don’t 
want to pay the debt that they will-
ingly took on and brag about the 
spending that incurred that debt is the 
height 
of 
irresponsibility 
and 
the 
height of hypocrisy. It is a dine-and- 
dash of unprecedented proportions. And 
if they have their way, it is going to be 
the American people who will foot the 
bill. 
The full faith and credit isn’t a game. 
It is the bedrock upon which our econ-
omy stands. No lawmaker can vote to 
refuse to pay the bills and then say 
they have the best interests of the 
American people in mind. 
So, again, here is what is on the line 
with this vote: the well-being of tens of 
millions of Americans—everyone from 
small business owners, homeowners, 
veterans, Active Duty military, Social 
Security beneficiaries, and American 
consumers everywhere. 
And Senator WARNER
has made a 
very good point. If we default or even if 
the risk of coming close to default 
raises interest rates by 1 percent, that 
will cost the government more—more— 
than some of the spending programs— 
many of the spending programs that 
the Republicans say they don’t like, 
even though they voted for it. 
There is a very simple answer to 
avoiding this entire problem. When the 
CR comes to the floor, Republicans 
vote yes and put this needless crisis to 
an end. But if they choose to vote in 
favor of default by a cynical political 
blame game, it will ultimately be the 
American people who will pay the 
price. And the American people will 
know who did this—the Republican 
Senate. Because there will be a pro-
posal by the Democratic President, the 
bill will pass the floor, and Democrats 
and Republicans will each have to vote 
yes or no, simply put, on whether we 
want to default. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on nominations. Last night, I filed clo-
ture on seven nominations that have, 
to date, been tied up by Republican ob-
structionists. 
These individuals will play a critical 
role 
in 
advancing 
U.S. 
diplomacy 
across the globe, from Europe to East 
Asia to Africa. One will be tasked with 
international narcotics law enforce-
ment; another will advise on military 
affairs. 
These are not controversial nomi-
nees. Quite the contrary, they were all 
reported out of committee with over-
whelming bipartisan support and would 
normally be confirmed by this Cham-
ber without much fuss. 
Now a few on the other side have de-
cided they are going to hold these crit-
ical nominations hostage for the sake 
of scoring political points with the far 
right. It is a sort of a manic dash, who 
can be the most irresponsible to please 
the far right of people who seem to be 
interested in running for President in 
2024. 
They want to drag out what should 
be an easy process, wasting the Cham-
ber’s time and energy and hindering 
the government’s ability to protect 
American interests. 
The Republicans who are delaying 
the confirmation of these nominees are 
deliberately making the American peo-
ple less safe just so they can try to en-
hance their political fortunes, which, 
in my judgment, if there is any gain, it 
will be short term and the loss of doing 
this will be much greater to them. 
Everyone here knows what is really 
going on, but despite Republican ob-
struction this week, we are going to 
make sure these important nominees 
are confirmed by the Senate. I hope we 
can come to an agreement to ulti-
mately move them quickly through 
this Chamber, but either way, we are 
going to stay here until these nominees 
have been confirmed. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

with Prime Minister Morrison of Aus-
tralia as well. Any day Congress has 
the opportunity to strengthen working 
relationships with two of our Nation’s 
closest friends and allies is a good day 
indeed. 
Our meetings today come at a time 
when our most important trans-Atlan-
tic and trans-Pacific alliances are fac-
ing growing threats to collective secu-
rity and to prosperity. 
In the face of Russia’s meddling, Chi-
na’s expansionism, a reinflamed War on 
Terror, and further threats to democ-
racy and human rights around the 
world, the steady leadership of com-
mitted partners is more crucial than 
ever. So I specifically wanted to thank 
our friends in Australia and the United 
Kingdom for their years of loyal friend-
ship that have underpinned coalition 
operations in Afghanistan and our 
joint efforts elsewhere to check the 
most pressing threats to our nations 
and to the kind of world that will help 
us thrive. 
I will be reaffirming my own commit-
ment that America must be the reli-
able, committed, and globally engaged 
ally that our closest friends deserve. 
f 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on another matter, over the past sev-
eral months, American families have 
had to contend with a historic amount 
of painful, painful inflation. This sum-
mer, we saw the prices for core per-
sonal consumption soar at the fastest 
pace in nearly 30 years. Last month, 
the Producer Price Index notched its 
steepest year-on-year jump in more 
than a decade. All across the country, 
across the economy, families and busi-
nesses are being hit hard. 
One measure of construction mate-
rials is reporting that homebuilders are 
facing materials costs that are 22 per-
cent higher than just last year—22 per-
cent higher than just last year. Home-
owners and renters are approaching a 
fall and winter in which heating costs 
are projected to reach a 13-year high. 
Eighty-six percent of respondents told 
one recent poll they were either ‘‘ex-
tremely’’ or ‘‘very worried’’ about in-
flation. 
Now, this is exactly what Repub-
licans, independent experts, and even 
liberal economists warned would hap-
pen if Democrats started ramming 
through massive, massive inflationary 
spending. Back in the springtime, 
Larry Summers, the top economic ad-
viser to both President Clinton and 
President Obama, warned at the time 
that runaway spending could ‘‘set off 
inflationary pressures of a kind we 
have not seen in a generation.’’ And, of 
course, that is exactly what has hap-
pened. 
Well, just ask any working family in 
this country about their last trip to 
the gas station, the grocery store, or 
the car dealership. Inflation has gotten 
so bad on Democrats’ watch that it has 
wiped out every ounce of the average 
American worker’s pay growth during 
this economic recovery and then some. 
Annual real wage growth is negative 
even 
though 
employers 
have 
been 
handing out raises because—because— 
of inflation. 
Remember, at the start of the year, 
working Americans had an economy 
that was teed up for a roaring recov-
ery. So when Washington Democrats 
rolled out their first springtime spend-
ing spree, even the Washington Post 
cautioned that ‘‘the improving picture 
is raising questions about whether the 
stimulus bill is mismatched to the 
needs of the current moment.’’ That 
was the Washington Post on the so- 
called rescue package that passed back 
in March. 
You might think that the disastrous 
consequences of Democrats’ last spend-
ing binge for working Americans might 
give our colleagues some pause about 
the next one, but, alas, no such luck. 
Behind closed doors, they are putting 
together another, even more reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree. They want 
to take the last bill, which Democrats 
called the most leftwing law in Amer-
ican history, and actually dwarf even 
that. 
Massive tax hikes on Americans that 
will hurt families and help China. Let 
me say that again. Massive tax hikes 
on Americans that will hurt families 
and help China. A socialist trans-
formation that nobody voted for last 
year. Another invitation for even more 
painful inflation that will hit working 
Americans right where it hurts. The 
American people don’t want it, and 
Senate Republicans won’t support it. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on a related matter, yesterday evening, 
Senator SHELBY and I introduced a con-
tinuing resolution that could pass the 
Senate and prevent a government shut-
down. Our legislation would fund the 
government 
through 
December. 
It 
would restore the defensive assistance 
for our ally Israel that House Demo-
crats stripped out to appease some of 
the worst elements of the far left. 
As one frustrated Democratic Con-
gressman stated yesterday, ‘‘A missile 
defense system [like] Iron Dome de-
fends civilians from missiles. Hence the 
name. Only in a morally inverted uni-
verse would this be considered a ‘con-
troversy.’ ’’ That is a House Democrat 
describing the action yesterday of 
House Democrats. 
Our bill also removes the debt limit 
language that Democrats have known 
since July—since July—will not re-
ceive bipartisan support from Senate 
Republicans. As one of my colleagues 
put it succinctly, if Washington Demo-
crats want to jam through trillions of 
dollars in reckless spending all by 
themselves, they can raise the debt 
limit all by themselves. If they want to 
do one, they will need to do the other. 
To do one, if they need to do one, they 
will do the other. It is that simple. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, one final 
matter. 
The 
American 
people 
are 
watching a terrible sight unfold down 
on our southern border. Many thou-
sands of people, largely from Haiti, are 
literally huddled together underneath 
a bridge in Del Rio, TX, just across the 
Rio Grande. Temperatures have been in 
the triple digits. The conditions are un-
sanitary and inhumane. 
This nightmare is the direct result of 
the leftwing policies and leftwing mes-
sages pushed by the Biden administra-
tion. They say their approach to immi-
gration is the compassionate path, the 
one that reflects the soul of America. 
They are wrong. In no way does it 
honor America’s soul or uphold Amer-
ican values to tolerate a major border 
security 
crisis 
and 
unending— 
unending—humanitarian disaster that 
appear to be permanent features of life 
under the Biden administration. 
This false choice is the constant re-
frain from the left. Either we adopt 
Democratic policies that lure people 
into literal squalor and effectively 
open our borders in the middle of a 
pandemic or else we are somehow be-
traying the spirit of the Statue of Lib-
erty? That is simply nonsense. 
Legal, orderly immigration has been 
a proud strength of our country and a 
core pillar of the American way of life 
literally for generations. That is com-
pletely 
different 
than 
Washington 
Democrats sabotaging our border while 
publicly advertising a catalog—a cata-
log—of socialist benefits they say they 
will provide for illegal immigrants who 
manage to make it in. 
When President Biden was sworn in, 
thousands and thousands of people 
took his far-left campaign rhetoric se-
riously and began streaming toward 
our borders. One person at the border 
directly told the Washington Post they 
came because they heard ‘‘President 
Biden was letting people in.’’ 
First, in the springtime, his adminis-
tration called this a seasonal surge. 
Well, so much for that. We have had 
more than 150,000 border apprehensions 
every single month for the past 6 
months. Encounters usually fall off 
during the hot summer months, but on 
President Biden’s watch, the opposite 
has happened. 
Listen to one recent example of the 
chaos. A few days ago, the Biden ad-
ministration filled a big bus with ille-
gal immigrants from this encampment. 
The bus set out for somewhere else in 
Texas. But according to news report-
ing, partway through the journey, the 
illegal immigrants on board revolted, 
took control of the bus, and broke out. 
But more broadly, it sounds like catch- 
and-release may be the de facto Biden 
policy. 
Just this morning, the Associated 
Press reports that according to govern-
ment 
officials, 
‘‘Haitian 
migrants 
camped in a . . . Texas border town are 
being released in the United States . . . 
on a very, very large scale . . . under-
cutting

Nobody believes Democrats that this 
lawlessness, chaos, and human suf-
fering is the fair and compassionate 
way to govern our country. Nobody 
buys that. An average of recent sur-
veys shows that only 36 percent—36 
percent—of the country approves of 
President Biden’s handling of immigra-
tion, while 56 percent disapprove. 
Look, Americans know a train wreck 
when they see one. Our citizens deserve

of leadership, and so do the people 
Democrats are luring here with a mi-
rage.

f 
NOMINATION OF FLORENCE Y. 
PAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate will vote on Florence 
Pan’s nomination to the District Court 
for the District of Columbia. 
She is highly qualified, with more 
than a decade of experience on the 
bench. If confirmed, she would be the 
first Asian-American woman to serve 
on that court. 
She graduated summa cum laude 
from the University of Pennsylvania 
and received her law degree with dis-
tinction from Stanford. 
After clerking on the Southern Dis-
trict of New York in the Second Cir-
cuit, she decided to pursue a legal ca-
reer in public service. In 1995, she was 
selected for the prestigious Bristow fel-
lowship in the Office of the Solicitor 
General. After completing her fellow-
ship, she served as attorney in the Ap-
pellate Section of the Criminal Divi-
sion of the Justice Department and 
senior advisor to the Department of 
the Treasury. 
Beginning in 1999, Judge Pan worked 
as an assistant U.S. attorney for the 
District of Columbia for 10 years. In 
this role, she litigated local and Fed-
eral courts at the trial and appellate 
level. 
In 2009, President Obama nominated 
her to serve on the DC Superior Court. 
She was confirmed with unanimous 
support by the Senate. 
Years later, President Obama nomi-
nated her to serve on the DC district 
court, and her nomination was re-
ported out of the Republican-con-
trolled Judiciary Committee by a voice 
vote. Unfortunately, she didn’t receive 
a floor vote in time, though lawmakers 
on both sides of the aisle recognized 
that she was eminently qualified. 
Since 2009, Judge Pan has presided 
over more than 650 trials: criminal 
cases, family court cases, civil cases. 
She 
was 
unanimously 
rated 
‘‘well 
qualified’’ by the American Bar Asso-
ciation. She has the strong support of 
Congresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES NOR-
TON, who submitted a statement for the 
record and described her as an excep-
tional nominee. 
Last month, she was voted out of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee on a bi-
partisan vote of 18 to 4. 
What is more, the historic nature of 
Judge Pan’s nomination will help build 
a Federal bench that reflects full diver-
sity. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting her. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, less 
than 2 miles from this Capitol, there 
are 666,000 small white flags stretching 
across the National Mall like a sea of 
suffering and loss. Each of these flags 
represents an American life lost to 
COVID—666,000. Let me tell but one of 
them. Her name was Candace Ayers. 
She lived in my hometown of Spring-
field, IL. 
Early last March, as soon as they 
could, Candace and her husband Terry 
received their second coronavirus vac-
cinations. That was a day of joy and re-
lief for the family because Candace 
lived with rheumatoid arthritis, which 
weakened her immune system. 
In July, she traveled to Mississippi— 
a State, sadly, with one of the lowest 
vaccination rates—to console a friend 
who had lost her husband. At the time, 
COVID infections were at a low point, 
and the Delta variant was just start-
ing, so Candace thought she would be 
safe, having been vaccinated. 
Soon after the trip, she tested posi-
tive for COVID. She was hospitalized 
and moved to an ICU, and she spent the 
last few weeks of her life on a venti-
lator. 
She died on September 3 at the age of 
66, leaving behind her husband, their 
son and daughter and 5-year-old triplet 
grandchildren. 
In the obituary in my hometown 
paper, her family wrote: ‘‘She was vac-
cinated but was infected by others who 
chose not to be. The cost was her life.’’ 
I read that to my wife the morning it 
was printed and said I have never seen 
a sentence or two like that in any obit-
uary. 
Experts call what took Candace 
Ayers’ life a ‘‘breakthrough’’ COVID 
infection, meaning an infection that 
occurs after an individual has been vac-
cinated. Breakthrough infections are 
typically mild, but can be devastating 
for immunocompromised people like 
Candace. 
With the rise of the Delta variant, it 
is 
not 
just 
the 
elderly 
or 
immunocompromised who are at risk. 
Children made up only 3 percent of 
COVID cases at the start of this pan-
demic. Today, children account for 27 
percent of new COVID infections, and 
the school year is just starting. 
We are in the midst of yet another 
wave of this pandemic. COVID is once 
again overwhelming America’s health 
system, and the rate of COVID infec-
tions and deaths are dramatically high-
er in the areas of lower vaccination. 
An article in last Friday’s Chicago 
Tribune tells the story in Illinois. Last 
Thursday was the fourth day in a row 
that every ICU bed in Southern Illinois 
was filled. In a 20-county area—home 
to 400,000 people—there were no ICU 
beds available. 
Doctors, nurses, and first responders 
are working around the clock to care 
for sick patients, but after 18 grueling 
months, they are reaching a breaking 
point. And with our healthcare system 
pushed to the brink, everyone is feeling 
it. 
If you live in Southern Illinois and 
you have a heart attack, a stroke, a se-
rious accident, or a life-threatening 
condition, bad news: There are no ICU 
beds available for you. Hospital staffs 
in those areas have to call hospitals 
sometimes hundreds of miles away in 
Nashville, TN; St. Louis, MO; Kansas 
City, MO, to try to find a bed. 
Compare the situation to Chicago, 
some 300 miles away but a world of dif-
ference. COVID infection rates are 
starting to decrease. Public health offi-
cials are hopeful they are finally turn-
ing a corner. 
Why the great disparity between the 
Chicago regional area and Southern Il-
linois? One reason: vaccinations. In 
Chicago, two in three adults are fully 
vaccinated against COVID. In Southern 
Illinois, the figure is only one in three. 
So much of the suffering and expense 
could be avoided if we could take the 
politics out of the COVID debate and 
stop the spread of misinformation that 
is literally killing people. As Candace 
Ayers’ family would tell you, the most 
important thing is that more people 
get vaccinated. Vaccines are safe, ef-
fective, and free—and widely available 
to anyone over the age of 12. 
Here is a statistic that should trou-
ble everyone. The New York Times 
tracks COVID vaccinations around the 
world using figures supplied by na-
tional governments. Where do you sup-
pose the United States of America 
ranks globally compared to other coun-
tries on vaccination rates? Well, you 
would guess the top three, right? The 
top 10 for sure. How about top 20? You 
would be wrong. Last week, the United 
States ranked 55th globally for the per-
centage of people vaccinated. We are 
just behind Cambodia. 
And in the wealthiest Nation on 
Earth and in the country that led the 
research and development in finding 
these vaccines, that is sad; it is inex-
cusable; and it is deadly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6599 
September 22, 2021 
Now, listen, all Americans respect in-
dividual rights, but the only way to 
end the pandemic is for everyone to ac-
cept the personal responsibility for our 
shared well-being. That is why I sup-
port President Biden’s recent action to 
strengthen America’s defense against 
COVID and bring this pandemic finally 
to an end. 
Many responsible employers, large 
and small, have already decided on 
their own to require that their workers 
get vaccinated. I encourage more to do 
it. A strong majority of Americans sup-
port this policy. President Biden’s deci-
sion to extend that policy to much of 
the Federal workforce and to private 
employers with 100 or more workers 
means that two out of three American 
workers will be required to get vac-
cinated. 
We even have a situation in the Fed-
eral Bureau of Prisons where the infec-
tion rate of Federal prisoners is six 
times the national average. Yet fewer 
than half of Federal prison guards have 
been vaccinated—fewer than half. That 
is inexcusable. 
Other nations have already insti-
tuted policies which encourage vac-
cinations. It is time for us to do the 
same. If we are ever going to see this 
pandemic come to an end, kids get 
back in school, and life return to nor-
mal, more Americans have to roll up 
their sleeves and face the reality that 
vaccination is the pathway to that re-
sult. 
Now, sadly, while this debate is going 
on nationally, politicians in two dozen 
States, with vaccination rates below 
the national average, are threatening 
to sue the Biden administration over 
its new COVID policy. In other words, 
these Governors are saying to the 
President: Stop any requirement for 
masks; stop any requirement for vac-
cinations. In the war against COVID, 
these lawmakers in these two dozen 
States are siding with the virus. Their 
actions, if they follow through on these 
threats, will result in more illness, 
more death, and more harm to the 
economy. 
Now, how can I say that? Well, I will 
tell you how—by taking a look at the 
numbers. Take a look at the numbers 
from the 24 States threatening law-
suits. The infection rate is 3,471 for 
every 100,000 people. How about the 
other States that are not filing a law-
suit against President Biden? Coinci-
dentally, COVID death rates in those 24 
States where these attorneys general 
are threatening lawsuits against Presi-
dent Biden is 31 per 100,000. The COVID 
death rates in the rest of the country: 
11 per 100,000. 
Vaccination rate: 49 percent in those 
States, 57 percent in the States that 
are not suing the President. That tells 
a story. 
They are exalting liberty over life. 
This notion that we don’t have a re-
sponsibility to ourselves and our fam-
ily and innocent people to step forward 
is exactly the point that was being 
made by Candace Ayers’ family. We do. 
We bear that responsibility, and we 
should accept it. 
Since June, the average rates of 
COVID infections in the 24 States 
threatening to sue President Biden 
have been double the rates of COVID 
infection in the other 26 States. COVID 
death rates in those States have been 
nearly three times worse than the rest 
of the country. These reckless political 
actions have deadly, real-world con-
sequences. 
President Biden’s actions are reason-
able; they are necessary; and a major-
ity of the American people believe it. 
Politicians hoping to gin up their base 
by suing the President should stop and 
start fighting the virus instead of the 
President’s ambitions to bring this 
pandemic to an end. The sooner we do 
that, the sooner we can end this pan-
demic once and for all. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, Federal 
takeovers are being discussed in both 
the House and the Senate this week. 
The Democrat leaders announced that 
the Senate will once again be taking up 
legislation to put the Federal Govern-
ment, instead of the States, in charge 
of elections in this country. Mean-
while, over in the House of Representa-
tives, they are expected to vote on leg-
islation to eliminate essentially all 
State restrictions on abortion, no mat-
ter how modest or how widely sup-
ported. 
So what is up with all of these Fed-
eral takeovers? Well, Democrats have 
been 
pushing 
election 
legislation— 
what they call H.R. 1, or the For the 
People Act—for multiple years now. 
This radical legislation would provide 
for a massive Federal takeover of our 
electoral system, chill free speech, and 
turn the Federal Election Commission, 
which is the primary enforcer of elec-
tion law in this country, into a par-
tisan body, among other dangerous 
measures. 
And the reason—the reason for this 
radical legislation? Well, as even some 
Democrats have implicitly admitted, 
this legislation is designed to make it 
easier for Democrats to win elections. 
Fast forward to last week. With H.R. 
1 unable to pass the Senate, some 
Democrats produced a modified version 
of this legislation. It is called For the 
People Act ‘‘lite.’’ 
And while I appreciate their efforts, 
unfortunately, as the Republican lead-
er said yesterday morning, ‘‘This latest 
version is only a compromise in the 
sense that the center left compromised 
with the far left,’’ or, as the Wall 
Street Journal editorial board put it 
this 
morning, 
‘‘Calling 
this 
bill 
slimmed down . . . is like touting your 
healthy choices after you order a Diet 
Coke with four Big Macs.’’ 
The For the People Act ‘‘lite’’ would 
still impose troubling new burdens on 
free speech; it would still undermine 
State voter ID laws; it would still 
spend taxpayer dollars on political 
campaigns; it would still make it easi-
er for those here illegally to vote; and, 
most of all, it would still put Wash-
ington, not State governments, in 
charge of elections for no reason at all. 
Let’s be clear. There is absolutely 
zero reason to have the Federal Gov-
ernment start dictating States’ elec-
tion policies—zero reason. There is no 
systemic problem with State election 
laws, and State election officials do not 
need Washington bureaucrats dictating 
how many days of early voting they 
should offer or how they should man-
age mail-in ballots. 
This bill, like its parent H.R. 1, is a 
solution in search of a crisis. States 
have been doing a fine job running 
elections. Even Democrats have sort of 
had to admit that given the huge voter 
turnout in the last election and the 
fact that Democrats won, albeit by the 
slimmest of margins—even Democrats 
have had to admit that States are 
doing a pretty good job running elec-
tions. 
So now that they can no longer tell 
us that our electoral system is broken, 
Democrats are telling us that we need 
election legislation like this because 
States are passing legislation that will, 
Democrats claim, threaten election ac-
cess—baloney. It is just another at-
tempt to manufacture a crisis that will 
justify passing H.R. 1 or some variant. 
Democrats are pushing election legis-
lation for one simple reason: because 
they 
think 
it 
will 
improve 
their 
chances in future elections. That is not 
a good reason to bring up election leg-
islation, and I will continue to oppose 
any Federal takeover of elections. 
South Dakota election officials are 
doing just fine without having their 
every move dictated by Washington bu-
reaucrats. 
f 
ABORTION 
Mr. THUNE. Meanwhile, Mr. Presi-
dent, over in the House, Members are 
expected to consider legislation that 
would, as I said, preempt virtually all 
State restrictions on abortion. Demo-
crats are calling the bill the Women’s 
Health Protection Act. A more accu-
rate name might be the ‘‘abortion on 
demand act’’ or we could simply refer 
to it as what it is—probably the most 
anti-life legislation ever to be consid-
ered in the U.S. Congress. 
This bill would eliminate pretty 
much any and every abortion restric-
tion in every State across the country: 
parental notification laws, informed 
consent laws. Measures adopted by

States and upheld by the Supreme 
Court would disappear under Demo-
crats’ legislation. The bill would also 
prevent States from restricting any 
particular method of abortion, no mat-
ter how barbaric the method, and the 
bill would make it essentially impos-
sible to impose any meaningful restric-
tions at all on abortion in any stage of 
pregnancy, including after the point of 
fetal viability, when the baby can sur-
vive outside its mother. 
The bill would also jeopardize doc-
tors’ and nurses’ right to refuse to par-
ticipate in abortions and specifically 
prevent them from having recourse 
under the Religious Freedom Restora-
tion Act to protect their conscience 
rights. It would put measures in place 
to ensure that any State pro-life law 
would face an uphill climb in the court-
room. In short, this legislation would 
make abortion on demand at any time, 
for essentially any reason, the law of 
the land in the United States. 
I hope—I really do hope—that during 
debate on this measure the Democrats 
are not going to pretend that their pro-
posed abortion law somehow represents 
the prevailing sentiment of the coun-
try—because it doesn’t. The vast ma-
jority of Americans believe that there 
should be at least some restrictions on 
abortion. 
Gallup has been polling on abortion 
for decades, and in all that time, the 
percentage of Americans who believe 
abortion should be legal under any cir-
cumstances has always remained under 
35 percent. In fact, for most of the past 
several decades that number has re-
mained squarely under 30 percent. 
A strong majority of Americans sup-
port at least some restrictions on abor-
tion. 
Furthermore, 
the 
Associated 
Press poll from this June found that 65 
percent of Americans believe that 
abortion should generally be illegal in 
the second trimester, or from about 13 
weeks of pregnancy, while a whopping 
80 percent—80 percent—of Americans 
believe that abortion should generally 
be illegal in the third trimester. 
And it is not surprising. Americans 
aren’t 
dumb. 
And 
thanks 
to 
ultrasounds and scientific advances 
and plain old common sense, they 
know just how ridiculous it is to claim 
that unborn children are just blobs of 
tissue. Most people are well aware that 
an unborn baby with its own heartbeat 
and fingers and toes and DNA is, in 
fact, not a blob of tissue but a human 
being. 
And most people believe that human 
beings deserve to be protected, even 
when they are small and weak and vul-
nerable—especially 
when 
they 
are 
small and weak and vulnerable. And so 
it doesn’t surprise me in the least that 
80 percent of the American people 
think abortion should generally be ille-
gal in the third trimester, because I 
can’t 
imagine 
anyone 
being 
com-
fortable with the idea of killing a baby 
who is not only, like any unborn baby, 
a human being worthy of protection, 
but who is actually old enough to sur-
vive outside of his or her mother. 
And so, as I said, I really, really hope 
the Democrats are not going to pretend 
that they are representing the Amer-
ican people with this appalling legisla-
tion. They are not representing the 
American 
people. 
They 
are 
rep-
resenting the radical abortion lobby, 
and the radical abortion lobby is terri-
fied that, as it well knows, it does not 
have the majority of the American peo-
ple on its side. And so it is relying on 
its Democrat allies to push for perhaps 
the most radical pro-abortion legisla-
tion ever considered. 
The American people are better than 
this, and I would hope that the Demo-
cratic Party would be better than this. 
The Democratic Party has historically 
portrayed itself as the defender of the 
little guy. It is unfortunate that that 
doesn’t extend to the littlest guys and 
girls among us: the unborn babies in 
danger of dying from abortion. 
There are hundreds of thousands of 
abortions in the United States every 
year. That is hundreds of thousands of 
innocent human lives lost. Do we real-
ly need to remove even the most mod-
est restrictions on abortion? 
While, unfortunately, the vast major-
ity of the Democratic Party is in the 
pocket of the radical abortion lobby, I 
hope that there are at least some— 
some House Democrats—out there who 
aren’t comfortable with this bill in the 
Democratic Party’s extreme abortion 
politics. 
And I hope that these Democrats will 
stand up and oppose their party’s abor-
tion-on-demand legislation. This anti- 
life legislation is an abomination, and 
it should never, never make it out of 
the House of Representatives. 
I yield the floor.

SOCIALISM 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, para-
phrasing a philosopher of his era, Win-
ston Churchill once said: Those that 
fail to learn from history are doomed 
to repeat it. 
And I doubt that Churchill was the 
only one that said that. I think we 
quote 
other 
people 
saying 
similar 
things. 
Now, Churchill was himself a devoted 
student to history. The research for his 
multivolume biography of his ancestor, 
John Churchill, first Duke of Marl-
borough, likely informed his strategic 
military thinking as Prime Minister 
during World War II. 
Churchill was also a fierce critic of 
socialism in his time, and that is the 
main point of my remarks today—talk-
ing about socialism. 
Socialism, as we know it today, is 
based on a different view of history 
than what Churchill had, a history that 
says we are headed in a particular di-
rection, and you just need to see where 
it is heading to ‘‘be on the right side of 
history.’’ 
Socialism was thought to be the 
wave of the future in Churchill’s time, 
just as it was the wave of the future 
when Karl Marx was writing about it in 
the mid-1800s. In fact, a wave is an apt 
analogy for socialism. Enthusiasm for 
socialism has crested and then crashed 
down many, many times in the last 
couple of centuries. 
Today, some enthusiasts are again 
riding high on this socialism wave. 
Some of them are too young to know 
better, while others simply refuse to 
learn the lessons from the previous 
crashes that socialism has shown us. 
Given previous spectacular failures of 
full-fledged socialism in Eastern Eu-
rope, Latin America, Asia, and Africa, 
usually, as we learn, resulting in vio-
lence, in poverty, and, most impor-
tantly, suppression of individual rights 
that we value here in the United 
States, but also advocates of socialism 
find themselves on the defensive once 
again. 
When asked why we should try a sys-
tem that has repeatedly and spectacu-
larly failed, a common fallback is to 
cite Sweden and other Nordic countries 
as examples that we should learn from. 
It may surprise some of my col-
leagues here in the Senate that this is 
one point where I agree with the social-
ists. We should examine and learn from 
Sweden’s experience. In fact, an excel-
lent summary of Sweden’s experience 
from the 1950s to this very day has been 
compiled by the Swedish economist 
Johan Norberg. His video, which goes 
by the title ‘‘Sweden: Lessons for 
America,’’ is available on YouTube as 
part of the Free to Choose Network. A 
short paper similarly titled, ‘‘Sweden’s 
Lesson for America,’’ has been pub-
lished by the Cato Institute. 
So I would recommend to all of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
paying attention to either that video 
or that publication by Cato because we 
can learn a lot from Sweden, and it is 
not what people will be espousing here 
in the U.S. Senate based upon a lot of 
political speeches from those on the 
left. 
As Norberg points out, by about 1950, 
Sweden was the fourth richest country 
in the world and had the fifth freest 
economy. In other words, Sweden be-
came wealthy through economic free-
dom, like we have here in America. 
And then, you know what, Sweden 
started to adopt socialist policies. 
At first, it was just a few welfare pro-
grams. But between 1960 and 1980, gov-
ernment spending in Sweden doubled 
from 31 percent of gross domestic prod-
uct to 60 percent of gross domestic 
product, and, of course, that meant for 
all the people in Sweden to pay sky- 
high taxes. 
This is the time period that older so-
cialists remember so fondly and we see 
espoused here on the Senate floor. Swe-
den was surfing on top of the socialist 
wave and seemed to have it all: pros-
perity, massive government spending, 
and a highly regulated economy. How-
ever, even the best surfers cannot ride 
a wave forever. All waves eventually 
come crashing down. Sweden’s socialist 
policies started to kill off the wealth 
creation that had made its economy 
the fourth richest in the world. That 
wealth economy was needed to fund all 
that government spending. 
Norberg points out that Sweden was 
10 percent richer than the G7 countries 
on a per-capita basis in 1970. But 25 
years later, 1995, it was more than 10 
percent poorer than those same G7 
countries. During that time, not a sin-
gle job was created in Sweden’s private 
sector, and, more importantly, infla-
tion took away almost all of the value

of any wage increases during that pe-
riod of time in Sweden—just as we see 
since the first of the year, inflation 
eating away so the workers today in 
America do not have a real wage in-
crease. 
As Margaret Thatcher famously said, 
‘‘The problem with socialism is that 
you eventually run out of other peo-
ple’s money.’’ 
One of the most iconic Swedish com-
panies is Ikea. Its stores all around the 
world are painted the color of the 
Swedish flag. During Sweden’s experi-
ment with socialism, Ikea moved to 
the 
Netherlands 
and 
is 
still 
headquartered there today. Things in 
Sweden had to change. And you know 
what? By the 1990s, Sweden realized its 
mistakes going the Big Government di-
rection that they went and they re-
versed course. 
Yes, it did elect a center-right gov-
ernment in the 1990s. But even more 
importantly, the leftwing Swedish so-
cialist democrats also recognized their 
mistake. 
Norberg quotes a Social Democrat 
Minister of Finance: 
That whole thing with democratic social-
ism was absolutely impossible. It just didn’t 
work. There was no . . . way to go than mar-
ket reform. 
So, yes, let us learn from Sweden 
here in the U.S. Senate, as we are con-
sidering a $4.2 trillion reconciliation 
package that builds more government 
programs and entitlement programs, 
that once you start them they never 
end—because we don’t have to go down 
the socialism road. That road is a dead 
end. 
Yes, Sweden still has much higher 
government spending and a more ex-
tensive welfare state than we have in 
the United States, but in order to gen-
erate the wealth to pay for it, Sweden 
now has very pro-growth economic 
policies. Sweden doesn’t pretend that 
they can finance all that spending by 
taxing the rich, like you have con-
stantly heard from the Democrat ma-
jority in both Houses of this Congress. 
In fact, Sweden’s tax code is much less 
progressive than the Federal Govern-
ment’s Tax Code here in the United 
States. Most Swedish tax revenue 
comes from an income tax system flat-
ter than ours and also from a consump-
tion tax. 
Norberg points out that the top 10 
percent in Sweden pay less than 27 per-
cent of the taxes; whereas, in the 
United States, the top 10 percent pay 45 
percent of all the income in the Fed-
eral Government, and we are still hear-
ing that they aren’t paying enough. 
And yet, from the other side, I never 
hear how much more than that 45 per-
cent that segment of our economy 
should pay because maybe there are 
some people who believe it ought to be 
100 percent. 
Moreover, taxes on employers and 
capital are modest in Sweden to at-
tract investment and remain competi-
tive on our global stage. The Trump 
tax cuts finally made our corporate in-
come tax competitive with Sweden’s. 
Now they want to make the American 
corporate tax rate yet the highest in 
the world, where it was for a long pe-
riod of time until 4 years ago. 
That is right; the Trump tax cuts 
made corporate tax more like Sweden, 
but now the Democrats want to make 
it less competitive once again. That is 
right. I am talking about today’s 
Democrats and the Biden proposals. By 
doing so, they are making the mistake 
that Sweden made decades ago that 
they are now attempting to correct and 
has done so by restoring pro-growth 
policies. 
As Norberg said, ‘‘You can have a big 
government, or you can make the rich 
pay for it all. You can’t have both.’’ 
Everybody in Sweden—rich, middle 
class, and even lower income—pays 
high taxes. That is the deal the Swedes 
have made. If that is the deal Demo-
crats are offering Americans, they 
should be honest instead of pretending 
it is possible to fund Swedish-style gov-
ernment here in the United States by 
spending through soaking the rich. 
They should explain that hard-working 
Americans will have to fork over close 
to half of their income to the govern-
ment in return for the cradle-to-grave 
welfare state benefits. But I think they 
know that would be very, very unpopu-
lar here if that is where it ends up, like 
it did in Sweden between 1970 and 1995. 
Now, the United States is not Swe-
den. Americans, who declared inde-
pendence and fought our Revolutionary 
War over taxes, are, on the whole, 
much less tolerant of giving over their 
hard-earned dollars to the government 
to spend. 
I would urge my colleagues across 
the aisle to learn the lessons from Swe-
den, including their counterparts on 
the center left in Sweden. Do not kill 
job creation. Do not kill wealth cre-
ation. Do not let soaring inflation steal 
the wages of American workers. 
And if you want to look to Sweden, 
look to the Sweden of today, not the 
Sweden of 1980. Better yet, if you want 
a model in the region, look to Sweden’s 
dynamic neighbor across the Black 
Sea, Estonia. Its history has led it to 
be even more resistant to the failed, 
outdated ideology of socialism. Estonia 
has the most competitive tax code in 
the OECD and a fast-growing economy. 
No wonder it is pushing back on 
Biden’s administrative proposal for a 
global minimum tax. Our actions now 
will determine what kind of life our 
kids and grandkids will have in the fu-
ture. 
We ought to learn from history so we 
can shape a brighter future. History is 
clear that economic freedom is the 
ticket to broad prosperity and not so-
cialism. 
IOWA LAND PRICES 
Mr. President, now I would turn to 
one other point. If anybody is waiting 
to speak, it is a little shorter than 
what I just stated. 
I want to make it a priority—or I do 
make it a priority to keep in touch 
with my Iowa constituents, 2.3 million 
of them. I listen to their thoughts and 
concerns. Now, that could be on my 99- 
county tour meetings that I hold every 
year for 41 years in a row now that I 
have been a Senator for Iowa, or it 
could be during the match-up of Iowa 
State versus my alma mater, Northern 
Iowa football. In either case, I meet 
with Iowans where they are and listen 
to what is on their mind. 
During this past State work period, I 
had multiple conversations with farm-
ers about what is on their minds. At 
the UNI-Iowa State game, I had a con-
versation with a friend but also a fel-
low farmer, Ron Heck. He farms near 
Perry, IA, where he talked to me at 
this football game about concerns 
about President Biden’s tax plan. 
Ron followed up with an email to me, 
which I want to share with my col-
leagues on the floor since this is a 
theme that I have consistently heard 
across the State. 
At the end of my speech, Mr. Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that 
this email be printed in the RECORD. 
I am going to refer to parts of that 
email, but I think you ought to hear it 
directly from Ron Heck, so that will be 
at the end. Just read it. 
Here is my summation of it. Ron 
started the email by saying: 
Iowa farmers have a problem with explod-
ing land prices, coupled with Biden’s increas-
ing death and transfer taxes. 
But to quote further: 
A . . . tax at death or transfer can’t be 
paid back by younger working farm families. 
Young Iowa farmers would become feudal 
servants to banks and landlords from outside 
the state. 
There are many cliches and articles writ-
ten about this. I have seen some that don’t 
seem to grasp the problem. 
For those who didn’t grasp the prob-
lem that these taxes might cause, Ron 
highlighted some key statistics on the 
lack of available Iowa farmland. You 
understand, God only made so much 
farmland. 
Quoting again: 
. . . in Iowa, from the third quarter of 2020 
through the second quarter of 2021, CARD 
[the Center for Agricultural Rural Develop-
ment] at ISU [Iowa State University] says 
181,046 acres of Iowa farmland has been 
‘‘available on the market.’’ Out of about 30 
million crop acres, this is 0.6% in a year. Ev-
eryone knows that it might be 100 years be-
fore any one parcel is available again, so 
‘‘you need to buy it now’’ is always said by 
the auctioneer. A Des Moines Register arti-
cle on June 28, 2018, by Donelle Eller says 
that only ‘‘7% of Iowa farmland (owners) in-
tend to sell to a non-family member.’’ 
Ron made this point to show that 
public auction prices are high because 
of the scarcity of available farmland 
for sale. These prices should not be 
used for family tax-transfer valuations 
for taxation. But, of course, they would 
be under some of these ideas coming 
out of the White House. 
Ron continued with facts on the price 
of this farmland: 
Outsiders believe the value is there, but in 
fact, farm families don’t want to sell, so the 
auction price goes up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6603 
September 22, 2021 
Ron said that, in August, there were 
40 Iowa farmland auctions, with most 
of the sales between $10,000 to $16,000 an 
acre. 
Assuming a ‘‘taxable’’ gain of $10,000 per 
acre, Biden’s taxes could be $4,400 per acre. 
Ron told me that, ‘‘At a minimum, 
this would be a $200 per acre cash rent 
for 22 years to the U.S. Government, 
all payable in advance.’’ 
He added: ‘‘This is ‘confiscation, not 
taxation.’ ’’ 
Ron said: ‘‘ . . . since the $4,400 must 
be paid for in after tax dollars, it would 
actually take double this amount to 
pay it back. Interest charges could 
make the payback period more than 50 
years, just to pay the U.S. taxes.’’ 
Ron finished his email by saying: 
It doesn’t take much outside money to 
raise havoc with Iowa farmland auctions, 
and therefore estate or transfer taxes will ul-
timately destroy Iowa’s farm culture. 
Ron, thanks for taking time to write 
to me so I can tell your story to my 
colleagues in the U.S. Senate. It is my 
job to respond to comments and do 
something about it. 
I want to urge my colleagues to join 
together and oppose changes that will 
impact family farmers and small busi-
nesses, generally. Most importantly, of 
those families which we were just told 
in Ron’s statistics, 93 percent of the 
farmers want to pass it on to the next 
generation. That might be true of 
small businesses as well. 
These Iowa farmers, just like farmers 
around the country, feed and fuel our 
country and the world. Only 2 percent 
of the people in this country provide 
food for the other 98 percent. Ensuring 
that the next generation of farmers are 
able to keep the land in their family is 
in our national interest. 
If you want to preserve the family 
farm, then you can’t let it be taken 
away by these Biden tax proposals. 
These tax-and-spend proposals will be 
bad for small business, for farmers, and 
for all Iowans. 
Mr. President, at this point I ask 
unanimous consent that the entire 
email from Ron Heck be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
Jennifer, you and I have not met. I talked 
to Senator Grassley at the ISU/UNI football 
game last week. He asked me to send an 
email to you about our conversation. He will 
recognize my name. 
Iowa farmers have a problem with explod-
ing land prices, coupled with Biden’s increas-
ing death and transfer taxes. As the Senator 
said to me, the result is ‘‘confiscation, not 
taxation’’. A 44% tax at death or transfer 
can’t be paid back by younger working farm 
families. Young Iowa farmers would become 
feudal servants to banks and landlords from 
outside of the state. 
There are many cliches and articles writ-
ten about this. I have seen some that don’t 
seem to grasp the problem, and some that 
are pretty good. I’ll do some math about 
Iowa grain farmers that might be helpful. I 
know the Senator doesn’t need to be con-
vinced that the proposed taxes are wrong. He 
might find some of this useful: 
In the last year in Iowa, from the third 
quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 
2021, CARD at ISU says 181,046 acres of Iowa 
farmland has been ‘‘available on the mar-
ket’’. Out of about 30 million crop acres, this 
is 0.6% in a year. Everyone knows that it 
might be a 100 years before any one parcel is 
available again, so ‘‘you need to buy it now’’ 
is always said by the auctioneer. A Des 
Moines Register article from June 28, 2018, 
by Donelle Eller says that only ‘‘7% of Iowa 
farmland (owners) intend to sell to a non- 
family member’’. POINT: Public auction 
prices are artificially high because of scar-
city and should not be used for family tax 
transfer valuations for taxation. Outsiders 
believe the value is there, but in fact, farm 
families don’t want to sell, so the auction 
price goes up. 
Forty current Iowa auction prices from 
Aug 20 to Aug 27 were from $7400 to $22,600. 
The $22,600 included a wind turbine that was 
bring in about $400/acre in payments, so that 
one doesn’t count. Still, most of them were 
$10,000 to $16,000. Assuming a ‘‘taxable’’ gain 
of $10,000 per acre. Biden’s taxes could be 
$4,400 per acre. At a minimum, this would be 
a $200 per acre cash rent for 22 years to the 
US government, all payable in advance. This 
is ‘‘confiscation, not taxation’’. Actually, 
since the $4,400 must be paid for in after tax 
dollars, it would actually take double this 
amount to pay it back. Interest charges 
could make the payback period more than 50 
years, just to pay the US taxes. 
Farmdoc from the University of Illinois 
has many articles showing the return to land 
and the farmer. They include crop and gov-
ernment revenue, and subtract all costs ex-
cept rent and family living. The number is 
variable, but usually the landlord and tenant 
have about $300 to split as they choose. Iowa 
State has similar numbers, but Illinois has a 
better presentation. 
So, if farmers can’t pay these prices, 
doesn’t this all work out with lower land 
prices? Nope. For one thing, there is a boom 
and bust in Iowa land prices about every 50 
years (1930, 1980, 2030?). Booms, or bubbles, 
are caused by a bad combination of money, 
credit, and attitude. What could be the prob-
lem now? Of course one is the cheap and easy 
credit. With 10 year T-bill rates around 1%, 
and everyone ‘‘knows’’ you can’t lose money 
on farm land, a $240 cash rent on $16,000 land 
at first glance is a 1.5% return. Everyone 
‘‘knows’’ that government programs guar-
antee that farmers will pay the rent (have 
you seen the movie ‘‘The Big Short’’ about 
the housing bust?). 
What about an outside billionaire getting 
excited about carbon sequestration, or get-
ting nervous about the stock market? The 
181,046 auctioned Iowa acres last year if they 
were $14,000 per acre would have been $2.5 bil-
lion dollars. Bill Gates is now the largest 
farmland owner in the US. Back to my point: 
it doesn’t take much outside money to raise 
havoc with Iowa farmland auctions, and 
therefore estate or transfer taxes, and ulti-
mately destroy Iowa’s farm culture.

Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, Demo-

after bill that adds trillions of dollars 
in spending to Washington’s credit 
card. 
First, there was the $1.9 trillion 
‘‘Bidenomics’’ stimulus bill that fanned 
the flames of inflation and paid people 
not to work. Then there was the $1.2 
trillion so-called infrastructure bill 
that was supposed to be entirely paid 
for, but wasn’t. And now the $3.5 tril-
lion budget blueprint that paves the 
way for passing a wish list of progres-
sive priorities, like the Green New Deal 
and other pricey partisan pet projects. 
You might think the reckless spend-
ing spree would have come to a stop 
after reaching the Nation’s debt limit 
in July. Wrong. 
The Democrats are now plotting to 
suspend the debt limit in order to pass 
what would be the most expensive bill 
ever passed by Congress. 
This reckless borrowing and spending 
is driving up the prices of everyday 
goods as well as our national debt and, 
if Democrats have their way, the taxes 
of hard-working Americans, too. With 
the Federal fiscal year ending in mere 
days, another trillion-dollar spending 
bill will probably be rushed through at 
the last minute to avoid a government 
shutdown because Congress put off 
doing its work on time yet again. 
The Democrats have their hands full 
with multiple financial crises, all of 
their own making, and their solution 
to each of these is the same—to spend 
more money we don’t have—which only 
confounds the underlying problems. 
More spending results in higher taxes, 
increased prices, and even more debt. 
The scenario reminds me of this pop-
ular meme of a guy playing UNO, in 
which the whole aim of the game is to 
rid your hand of all of your cards. I 
love this game. I played it as a little 
girl at my grandma’s house. I played 
UNO with all of my cousins. 
OK. So, in the meme, he is seen hold-
ing a wildcard that presents him with a 
choice: Perform an action—in this 
version, to ‘‘cut unnecessary spend-
ing’’—or draw another 25 cards from 
the deck and, most certainly, lose the 
game. 
In the next frame, the man, who rep-
resents the Democrats here, is holding 
a handful of cards because he would 
rather do anything but what the card 
actually suggests. 
Unfortunately, the consequences of 
dealing with Washington’s budget are 
much more dire than losing a game of 
UNO. Instead of drawing cards, the 
Democrats are selecting to borrow 
more to finance totally unnecessary 
and completely indefensible—and often 
bizarre—expenditures rather than sim-
ply cutting waste out of the budget. 
Just like you can’t win UNO without 
getting rid of the cards in your hand, 
we will never get control of our debt 
until we discard the waste in Washing-
ton’s bloated budget. It may sound a 
bit oversimplified, but it isn’t. To dem-
onstrate the point, I brought my own 
deck of cards with me today.

September 22, 2021 
OK. So these are UNO cards, all 
right? Every one of these cards lists a 
current government expenditure and 
its cost to the taxpayers. Each rep-
resents a real choice Congress will 
make in the coming days. In each sce-
nario, the Democrats are likely to 
choose taxing and borrowing to pay for 
the spending rather than to trim the 
unneeded expenditure. So let’s pick a 
card, any card, and see if that is a good 
deal for the taxpayers. 
So let’s see. UNO card No. 1: ‘‘Cut the 
pork or draw 25.’’ 
After a decades-long moratorium on 
congressional earmarks, the House of 
Representatives has revived the cor-
rupt practice of earmarking tax dollars 
for politicians’ pet projects. More than 
3,300 earmarks, consisting of $9.3 bil-
lion, have been proposed by Members of 
Congress just this year, which includes 
purchasing Santa gifts in Indiana and 
building fish markets in the Virgin Is-
lands. We could save billions by pulling 
pork off the menu, but the Democrats 
are going to go with the drawing of 25 
more cards instead. 
OK, let’s try another one. OK. 
‘‘End welfare for politicians or draw 
25.’’ 
Every year, millions of taxpayer dol-
lars are diverted into a special account 
that exists solely to subsidize the cam-
paigns of politicians running for Presi-
dent. The program has doled out more 
than $1.6 billion for parties and politi-
cians to date, and there is currently 
$400 million sitting in the account. We 
could save the $400 million by pulling 
the plug on this welfare program for 
politicians, but, once again, the Demo-
crats will choose to draw 25 more 
cards. 
OK. The next card: ‘‘Put the brakes 
on boondoggles or draw 25.’’ 
Washington continues to bail out 
transit boondoggles across the country 
that are billions of dollars over budget 
and decades behind schedule, like, of 
course, folks, the San Francisco Bay 
Area subway extension to Silicon Val-
ley, 
California’s 
high-speed 
rail 
project, and Honolulu’s elevated rail 
line. The Democrats are proposing $10 
billion more to support the high-speed 
rail projects alone. We could save tens 
of billions of dollars by canceling these 
gravy trains that are taking taxpayers 
for a ride, but you can probably guess 
what the Democrats’ play will ulti-
mately be: to draw 25. 
So, folks, let’s lay the cards on the 
table. The Democrats’ borrowing-based 
budgeting is a real house of cards be-
cause you simply can’t borrow your 
way out of debt. The bills will eventu-
ally come due in the form of higher 
taxes and drastic cuts to government 
services, and it will be the taxpayers 
who get lost in the shuffle. Because the 
Democrats control both Chambers of 
Congress and the White House, it may 
seem that the deck is stacked against 
our taxpayers, but I have a card up my 
sleeve. 
Folks, let’s put it in reverse and go 
in a different direction. Instead of just 
throwing in the cards and going along 
with the Democrats’ demand to borrow 
another penny, let’s first go through 
the budget, line by line, and determine 
what is a priority and what isn’t. 
It is time to make Washington start 
living within a realistic budget, just 
like every other family in America is 
expected to do. That may be a wild idea 
to the big spenders in DC, but tax-
payers know that is how to play your 
cards right. So, instead of picking up 
more debt, let’s skip—let’s skip—the 
spending that isn’t needed until we are 
sure Washington isn’t wasting a single 
dollar. 
UNO. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Florida. 
(The remarks of Mr. SCOTT of Florida 
pertaining to the introduction of S. 
2809 are printed in today’s RECORD 
under ‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills 
and Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I yield the 
floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, obvi-
ously, when you look at what needs to 
be done in the fall and, frankly, if you 
look at what needs to be done in the 
next few weeks, there are important 
items ahead of us. 
One of them that my colleague from 
Florida just did a good job talking 
about is setting the debt limit for how 
much Federal Government debt should 
the country be able to tolerate. 
One way to do this is to set a limit. 
Another way that some of my col-
leagues appear to really prefer is just 
to set a date and say we are going to 
postpone any limit until that date, and 
we will just see what happens. We will 
see how deep the debt gets between 
now and then. But we really don’t want 
to talk about a limit, and when you 
look at what that limit is likely to be, 
you 
would 
understand 
why 
you 
wouldn’t want to talk about that. 
We have really seen this coming for 
some time. It shouldn’t be a crisis, ex-
cept, frankly, our friends on the other 
side seem intent on making it a crisis 
and seeing if they can include all of us 
suddenly in a spending discussion that 
we haven’t been in up until now. How 
much debt can we have? How much can 
we afford? But what we have seen this 
year is, how much money can one side 
spend without involving the other side 
in any way? 
We have never approached the debt 
limit in at least the last 25 years, that 
I am aware of, in a way that didn’t in-
volve talking about spending. In fact, I 
would argue that there is no real rea-
son to have the debt limit if it doesn’t 
force a discussion on spending. Other 
countries don’t have it; we have it. 
One reason I have always thought it 
actually served a purpose was it always 
generated a discussion on spending— 
not just a discussion on full faith and 
credit but how much money are we 
going to spend. In fact, when President 
Obama was President and the debt ceil-
ing had to be extended, we had a dis-
cussion about what our spending caps 
were going to be. We had a decade, be-
cause of that, of spending caps. We 
didn’t always stick with them, but to 
not stick with them, you had to change 
the law, so that forced another discus-
sion. We have all heard for a decade 
about the caps deal, the spending caps 
deal. Well, that was a discussion that 
was had so there would be a bipartisan 
agreement on the debt limit. 
In June of 2019, we saw the debt limit 
coming again, and by that time, Speak-
er PELOSI, who was the Speaker of the 
House in charge of a majority in the 
House, said she wouldn’t cooperate in 
doing anything on the debt limit unless 
the administration agreed to spend 
more money. 
So there you have a spending discus-
sion, but you also have one body of the 
Congress where the leader of the entire 
majority is saying: We are not going to 
be part of the debt limit unless we have 
an agreement on spending, and we 
want to spend more. From that mo-
ment on, Secretary Mnuchin, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, was up here 
over and over again, negotiating with 
the Speaker of the House on just how 
much more it was going to take for her 
to be part of the debt limit. 
Now, here we are in almost October, 
9 months through the year. Repub-
licans really haven’t been asked in any 
serious way up until now this year how 
to set parameters for government 
spending. We would like to spend less; 
the other side would like to spend 
more. But no Republicans—zero Repub-
licans—have been involved in a plan to 
eliminate important parts of the 2017 
tax bill that clearly were producing the 
kinds of economic results we had hoped 
for at the beginning of the pandemic. 
No Republicans were part of the plan 
to spend right at $2 trillion in the 
March COVID relief bill even though 
we really saw our economy already 
coming back. 
By the way—no surprise—when you 
spend $2 trillion, inflation is one of the 
things you are going to get when you 
put that much money into the econ-
omy on top of what we put in in 2020 in 
a bipartisan way to try to stabilize the 
economy. 
Well, the economy was clearly sta-
bilized by the first of last year, and no 
Republican, again, let me say, was part 
of how to spend that $2 trillion. 
No Republican has been part of the 
discussion of how to spend what our 
friends on the other side say would be 
a $3.5 trillion, reckless tax-and-spend-
ing amount. Others estimate that 3.5 
really would be 5 trillion. But, again, 
the point is not how big it would be; 
the point is, no Republican has been 
part of that. 
If you look at what is actually in 
that legislation as it comes out of the 
House, some of the things are pretty 
amazing. There is $3 billion on a 
project called Tree Equity. Now, I 
don’t think that is to make all the

trees the same size. I assume that is a 
project to be sure that everybody has 
their fair percentage of the trees, what-
ever that would mean and how you de-
scribe that. 
There is $200 million for the Presidio, 
the park in Speaker PELOSI’s district— 
$200 million. 
They are talking about $8 billion in 
that bill for a new Civilian Climate 
Corps and $7 billion to buy electric ve-
hicles for the Postal Service. 
Their plan comes to us with $105 mil-
lion for ‘‘entrepreneurial training’’ for 
people who are currently or have just 
been incarcerated. 
There is even $5 million in that bill 
for electronic voting systems for union 
elections. I am not opposed to union 
elections and am not opposed to unions 
having them. It would seem to me that 
they have up until now figured out how 
to provide their own equipment for 
their own elections or rent it or lease 
it. It is certainly a new sort of govern-
ment involvement in that activity. 
Frankly, the list goes on and on. At 
$3 trillion, you are likely to have a lot 
of ideas. Seems to me that a lot of the 
ideas are, you come up with a number, 
which is what it takes to eliminate the 
2017 tax cuts, and then start talking 
about, how many new things do we 
need to do to support that number? 
Well, this shouldn’t be an emergency. 
September is pretty late to reach out 
to the other side and not even now say 
‘‘Well, let’s talk about our spending 
priorities,’’ but say, ‘‘Well, you need to 
help us with this because at some 
point, there is some money that had to 
be spent that was your responsibility 
too.’’ 
I guess we could have said that to 
Speaker PELOSI in 2019 when she said: 
Not going to do it unless we get more 
spending. And we wouldn’t have had an 
agreement in the Obama years if we 
hadn’t set a cap on spending. 
The truth is, this isn’t Speaker 
PELOSI’s money, and it is not Senator 
SCHUMER’s money, and it is not my 
money. We are talking about the 
money that belongs to the American 
people. They need to have a say in this. 
In a 50–50 Senate, one side deciding 
‘‘We are going to make all the deci-
sions about spending money’’ means 
that one side is likely to wind up mak-
ing all the decisions about how to 
reach the debt limit. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
with a Democratic President in the 
White House, Democrats controlling 
the House of Representatives, and 
Democrats 
controlling 
the 
Senate, 
those on the left have every arrow in 
the quiver they need to raise the debt 
limit. It is their sole responsibility. 
They own this. It is also their responsi-
bility, having control of all the levers 
of government, to ensure that govern-
ment does not shut down next Thurs-
day at midnight. 
As you have already heard from my 
colleagues here today, we Republicans 
are united in the fact that we will not 
assist in passing another reckless, Big 
Government, socialism package de-
signed to reshape the Nation and make 
Americans more dependent on the gov-
ernment from the moment they are 
born to the moment they die. 
FDR once warned of a government 
dependency when he said that ‘‘contin-
ued dependence upon relief induces a 
spiritual and moral disintegration fun-
damentally destructive to the national 
fiber. To dole out relief in this way is 
to administer a narcotic, a subtle de-
stroyer of the human spirit.’’ 
As elected officials, we are supposed 
to be good stewards of taxpayer dol-
lars. We are supposed to leave this 
country in better shape for our chil-
dren and grandchildren. But the Demo-
crats’ tax-and-spending spree accom-
plishes neither of these things and, in 
fact, further promulgates the govern-
ment dependency FDR cautioned fu-
ture generations about. 
What is shocking is that in just one 
generation 
the 
national 
debt 
has 
soared from $5 trillion to more than $28 
trillion. Think about that for a second. 
In the first 225 years of our Nation’s 
history, the national debt was approxi-
mately $5 trillion. In the last 20 years, 
we have increased it by nearly another 
$25 trillion, including accumulating 
more than $7 trillion in just the past 2 
years. 
Now, I said this before, but, folks, 
grab your wallets. Grab your wallets 
because the bill they want to pass for 
reconciliation is going to include mas-
sive spending that will put heavy debt 
on our country. It is going to raise 
your taxes. It is going to cause Medi-
care to run out in 2 years. And it is 
going to continue to drive up the cost 
of living. 
The inflation we are seeing now is a 
double whammy. You have less money 
to spend, and the things you are able to 
buy cost more. It is hurting every 
hard-working American, but none more 
than our seniors and young families 
living paycheck to paycheck. 
This looming government shutdown 
is just another crisis created by this 
administration. They created a crisis 
at our southern border, in Afghanistan, 
with a labor shortage, and now on the 
pocketbooks 
of 
Americans 
with 
a 
multitrillion-dollar socialist spending 
package. 
While it is true America has seen a 
number of horrendous financial crises 
before, none have so quickly developed 
as the pending fiscal crisis President 
Biden created with the trillions of dol-
lars’ worth of reckless spending and 
reckless taxing in just the first 9 
months of control. 
And Democrats are now pointing fin-
gers at Republicans, claiming that by 
refusing to go along with their out-of- 
control spending and joining them to 
increase the debt limit, that we are the 
ones who are being financially irre-
sponsible. 
Give me a break. If they were serious 
about getting our fiscal house in order, 
they 
wouldn’t 
be 
trying 
to 
force 
through another partisan spending bill 
that is going to bankrupt our country 
and instead would be pursuing budget 
reforms and debt reduction proposals 
in exchange for increasing the debt. 
This is not a serious political party, 
and America needs to recognize that 
we have a choice between free enter-
prise capitalism and a socialist econ-
omy. Trust me, I heard loud and clear 
this past weekend during my townhall 
meetings in the Kansas City area about 
what Kansans want, and it is not the 
socialism that has borne out trillions 
of dollars’ worth of spending and tax-
ing that has led to reckless inflation, 
hampered our economy, and killed our 
jobs. 
Ultimately, if you want strong roads, 
bridges, 
high-speed 
internet, 
good 
schools, and a strong military, we need 
a stronger economy. That should be 
our focus right now, not continuing 
down this administration’s socialist 
economic policies. 
Pre-COVID, we had the greatest 
economy in my lifetime. That came 
about because we lowered people’s 
taxes, we lowered regulations, and we 
lowered energy prices. We need smart, 
targeted 
investments, 
not 
radical 
spending that leaves the country at a 
disadvantage. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, since day one of this administra-
tion, President Biden has made it 
abundantly clear that he is not inter-
ested in the opinion of anyone who 
poses a threat to his so-called trans-
formative political agenda. 
During his first 3 days in office, he 
signed 30 Executive orders and actions 
that embraced radical environmental 
policies, destroyed thousands of jobs 
associated with the Keystone Pipeline, 
and transformed our southern border 
into a war zone. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle jumped on board with a reck-
less plan to borrow and spend their way 
into economic oblivion. They made it 
clear that despite having no mandate 
from the American people and no 
meaningful buy-in from Republicans, 
they are willing to do whatever it 
takes to transform this country into a 
wasteland defined by debt, dependency, 
and total government control. 
They are alone in this; and for the 
past 9 months, that is the way the 
Democrats have really wanted it to be, 
at least until recently, when it became, 
oh, yes, politically inconvenient. 
Lately, my Democratic colleagues 
have burned a lot of political capital, 
insisting that Republicans must come 
back to the table to help them raise 
the debt limit and avoid a doomsday 
scenario. 
That is right. They are the party of 
party-line votes, and they can’t find it 
within themselves to finance the cost 
of their very own reckless spending 
plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6606 
September 22, 2021 
Why this sudden shift in sentiment? 
The answer is simple. It is because 
they know that what they are doing is 
indefensible. They don’t want to own 
this. They don’t want to have to ex-
plain to their children and their grand-
children who are now stuck with the 
tab. 
What are they going to say when 
their grandchild says: Why does the 
Federal Government take most of my 
money? 
Well, it is because of their spending. 
I don’t blame them. If the Democrats 
have it their way, the national debt 
will hit more than $40 trillion by the 
end of the decade. That is correct, $40 
trillion. 
The American people can already feel 
the effects of this inflationary spending 
every time they go to the grocery store 
and every time they go to the gas 
pump. It looks like that inflation is 
going to be with us until the end of the 
Biden Presidency. 
They have also noticed that our sup-
ply chains are running thin. As we 
speak, Democrats are negotiating the 
largest package of tax increases in dec-
ades. And contrary to the spin from the 
White House, those tax increases will 
hit small businesses and hard-working 
taxpayers. 
Now, let’s be clear. This all happened 
according to plan. It is intentional. But 
here is the problem: My colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle are realizing 
that all those persuadable voters they 
won in 2020 are having buyer’s remorse. 
They realize this is intentional by 
the Democrats. They may have voted 
for President Biden, but, as they tell 
me, they did not vote for this. 
The Democrats have made a mess 
and, I’ll tell you what, they did it in 
record time. The only option that they 
have left is to find a friend to try to 
share the blame. 
I will play no part in facilitating this 
radical socialist agenda. 
I would say to my Democratic col-
leagues: You have known for a long 
time that this day was coming, and yet 
you were content to squander your 
power on a unilateral, multitrillion- 
dollar agenda for which you have no 
mandate and you can’t pay for. Leader 
MCCONNELL did not do this to you. 
Donald Trump did not do this to you. 
This is, indeed, an emergency of your 
own creation. Elections have con-
sequences. As such, you control the en-
tire government, and there is no one 
standing in your way. You chose to 
govern alone, and, fortunately, you 
have all the tools you need to do your 
duty and address the debt limit right 
by yourselves. The time for manipula-
tion and spin is over. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, when 
I served in the House of Representa-
tives, I walked into a lot of meetings 
back in Indiana full of angry conserv-
atives. 
Do you know what they were angry 
about? 
They were angry about the debt limit 
in 2011, 2013, 2014, and more. 
And in each of those meetings, I 
made the argument that raising the 
debt limit was a necessary thing to do, 
a responsible thing to do, a conserv-
ative thing to do. I still believe that. 
Defaulting on our Nation’s debt will 
start a dangerous spiral of economic 
turmoil that will rebound to the dis-
advantage of the least among us. Inter-
est rates would rise, the value of the 
dollar would fall, essential government 
workers might not get paid, and so on 
and so forth. 
Now, back in those days, as a Repub-
lican in the House majority, we never 
failed to raise the debt limit—not once. 
And we also never failed to have a say 
in the spending that necessitated rais-
ing the debt limit. In 2019, we again 
raised the debt limit, this time through 
July 13 of this year. 
Now it is Democrats. It is my Demo-
crat friends who control the majority 
in both Chambers of Congress. And 
with that control, the hard-left has em-
barked on an unprecedented, reckless 
spending spree designed to remake 
America in their image in fairly short 
order—before year’s end—$1.9 trillion 
in March; a $4.2 trillion budget au-
thored by Senator BERNIE
SANDERS; 
and now $3.5 trillion on a partisan, 
human infrastructure grab bag, the 
largest spending bill in American his-
tory. 
And so I say to my Democratic 
friends: You have decided to do all of 
that on your own, and now you want 
our help. It is unclear to me why you 
need it. You have done so much on 
your own. You have a number of op-
tions at your disposal to raise the debt 
limit all by yourself, just as you have 
gone it alone on this spending spree. 
A farmer back home, over the August 
recess, came up to me as I was trav-
eling the highways and byways of the 
Hoosier State. And I would like to 
think that the people I represent are 
blessed with a whole lot of common 
sense, which, for whatever reason, of-
tentimes doesn’t permeate this town. 
And the farmer told me that it seems 
like in this instance the butcher wants 
to build a new slaughterhouse, and he 
is asking the cows to co-sign on the 
construction loan. 
It is a pretty good metaphor for what 
the Democrats are asking of the Re-
publican Members. 
If Democrats had treated Repub-
licans as a governing partner in an 
equally divided U.S. Senate these past 
9 months, I might feel differently about 
this debt limit vote. Instead, they have 
treated us as an annoyance, an obsta-
cle—adverse to every common interest 
we might have. 
Now, I know we can count on my 
Democratic friends to ensure that 
America never defaults on its debt. I 
know we can count on every single 
Democratic U.S. Senator to vote to 
raise that debt ceiling, to own all of 
this spending they—and they alone— 
are responsible for. 
I sure hope we can count on them to 
vote on a specific dollar figure in con-
junction with the reconciliation bill. I 
know there has been apprehension 
made public by the budget chairman 
over in the House of Representatives. I 
suspect that is shared by many of my 
colleagues. But show some courage. Do 
what Republicans have done. Do what I 
have done. Walk the plank. Own this 
spending that you are responsible for. 
I will let you know, a vote by Repub-
licans to raise the debt limit at this 
point in time is a vote to co-sign the 
Democrats’ partisan, irresponsible, and 
unprecedented spending spree, and we 
are going to have none of it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to join my colleague 
from Indiana and to congratulate him 
on those remarks, which would be most 
certainly well received in Wyoming, 
and reflect the feeling of the people in 
my State in terms of the reckless tax- 
and-spending process in which the 
Democrats are engaged. 
And I come today to the floor to op-
pose what the Democrats are trying to 
do in terms of adding money to the 
debt, additional spending, a bill that 
has been described in so many ways. I 
read it and, to me, it is reckless. It is 
extreme. It is scary to talk about the 
sort of things that the Democrats are 
trying to impose on the American peo-
ple. 
When we take a look at what happens 
with this national debt, the folks on 
Medicare and on Social Security are 
concerned they are going to get under-
mined—those wonderful programs that 
work for so many people—because of 
the growing debt. 
How are we going to address it? 
Well, the suspension of the debt ceil-
ing expired a month and a half ago. 
Less than 2 weeks later, Democrats 
passed a blueprint for the largest 
spending bill in the history of the 
United States, over $3.5 trillion. People 
looked at it and saw how much it is, 
and they said: Democrats may say it is 
$3.5 trillion; it is a lot more than that. 
More than America spent in World War 
II to win the war? This is in addition to 
the $2 trillion already spent and added 
to the debt by this administration on a 
party-line vote earlier this year. 
So America’s debt is now over $28 
trillion. We are on our way to $30 tril-
lion. You divide that out by the num-
ber of men, women, and children in 
America, and it is approaching $100,000 
per individual. It is going to have to be 
paid back ultimately to Wall Street, to 
Japan, to China, and to those that hold 
our debt. 
And the problem, when you look at a 
debt that large, and say, ‘‘How do you 
put that into perspective,’’ is how 
much interest are we paying on the 
loan? People that borrow money for a 
car or a home know how much interest 
they are paying on the loan, and for 
the United States, it is approaching

$400 billion in interest on the loan a 
year. And this is at record low interest 
rates. 
Well, where is that money coming 
from? You know, you get nothing in re-
turn for it. But Democrats seem to 
think we need to just keep spending 
money and borrowing money to pay for 
the reckless spending. They don’t want 
voters to know about it. They don’t 
want voters to know how much money. 
They are asking for an unlimited abil-
ity to spend until after the 2022 elec-
tion. 
That is what is coming over from the 
House. They say: Don’t ask us. We are 
not going to tell you. We are just going 
to keep on spending like there is no to-
morrow, all the way through a date 
after the 2022 election. 
They want to cover all of this spend-
ing by suspending what is called the 
debt ceiling so they can borrow as 
much as they want. 
Well, it is not going to happen. You 
can’t have it both ways. If they try to 
spend trillions of dollars, they are 
going to be responsible for the con-
sequences of that spending. Repub-
licans are not going to give CHUCK 
SCHUMER and NANCY PELOSI a blank 
check, period. We are not going to give 
them a rubberstamp to their reckless 
spending. If Democrats want to raise 
the debt ceiling, they have the capac-
ity to do it on their own, and they will 
need to do it on their own. Republicans 
are not going to participate. 
The Democrats have been in charge 
of Washington now for 8 full months. 
They 
have 
complete 
control—the 
House, the Senate, the White House. 
During all that time, they haven’t 
raised a finger to lift the debt ceiling. 
Instead, they had the Secretary of the 
Treasury send a letter. She said the 
Treasury will run out of money in Oc-
tober. It is now September 22. The 
clock is ticking. 
Democrats chose not to raise the 
debt ceiling when they passed their $2 
trillion addition to the debt earlier this 
year. They called it COVID relief, but 
actually 90 percent of the money actu-
ally went for medical care. They chose 
not to raise it as part of this over $3.5 
trillion or $4 trillion spending bill that 
is being proposed as a result of BERNIE 
SANDERS’ socialist budget. 
And Democrats think that the Amer-
ican people can keep spending money 
in such a reckless way. They are play-
ing chicken with our economy. They 
think they can fool the American peo-
ple. It is not going to work. Repub-
licans are not going to be held hostage 
by the Democrats, and the American 
people should not be either or be put on 
the hook. 
If Democrats have enough votes to 
spend trillions of taxpayer dollars, 
then they have enough votes to raise 
the debt limit. This is Democrat debt. 
It is Biden-Schumer-Pelosi debt. Sen-
ate Republicans will not vote to burden 
future generations or to undermine So-
cial Security and Medicare today with 
this kind of reckless spending. 
We are not going to vote for the 
spending bill—not one of us—and not 
going to vote to raise the debt limit on 
Democrat terms. If they want to go it 
alone on spending, the Democrats can 
go it alone on raising the debt ceiling. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF LILY LAWRENCE BATCHELDER 
Mr. 
WYDEN. 
Madam 
President, 
today, the Senate is debating Professor 
Lily Batchelder’s nomination by Presi-
dent Biden to serve as Assistant Treas-
ury Secretary for Tax Policy. 
I am going to be brief, but I just want 
the 
Senate 
to 
know 
that 
Ms. 
Batchelder is an extraordinary indi-
vidual, and I think she will serve in an 
extraordinary way when she is con-
firmed. 
She is not a stranger to the Senate, 
particularly for those of us who serve 
on the Finance Committee. From 2010 
until 2014, she was chief tax counsel to 
then Chairman Max Baucus. Members 
were working hard, looking at ways to 
drive a broader economic recovery fol-
lowing a recession. It was also a time 
when Members were interested in try-
ing to drive a little bit of common 
sense—and I will talk about this more 
in a minute—into America’s broken 
Tax Code. 
Lily excelled in working with Demo-
crats and Republicans to try to find 
common ground. She understood, from 
the time she arrived at the Finance 
Committee, that if you really want to 
tackle big challenges, if you want to 
come up with big solutions and make 
them sustainable, you have to find 
common ground. 
After her service on the Finance 
Committee, Lily became the Deputy 
Director of the National Economic 
Council under President Obama. She 
now serves as the Robert C. Kopple 
Family Professor of Taxation at the 
NYU School of Law. And one of the as-
pects of her scholarship that I particu-
larly admire is her efforts to craft tax 
policies that bring more American 
workers into the economic winners cir-
cle. 
She understands the Tax Code inside 
and out. She knows the Congress. She 
knows how the Congress and the ad-
ministration work. And that is the rea-
son why the Finance Committee ap-
proved her nomination with such a 
strong bipartisan margin, a 22-to-6 
margin. Members of both sides thought 
that she would be a great addition to 
Treasury. The Senate ought to vote the 
same way. 
Second, Lily’s nomination has waited 
long enough for consideration on the 
Senate floor. Secretary Yellen needs a 
full team in place at Treasury. The 
country is going to be dealing with the 
aftereffects of the pandemic economic 
crash for years to come. There is a long 
way to go—a long way to go—before 
full recovery. 
And when we confirm her, she is 
going to have a chance to really bring 
real insight into some big areas, like 
dealing with the climate crisis, the na-
tionwide lack of affordable housing, 
and an increasingly unfair Tax Code. 
And I just want to give you an exam-
ple of the kind of issues she is going to 
have to take on. My colleagues here in 
the Senate have heard me talk about 
how it is that they are reading news 
stories 
about 
how 
billionaires 
all 
across America end up paying little or 
no income tax for years on end. Well, 
there is a little secret to how this hap-
pens, and it is because these billion-
aires are advised, in many instances: 
Don’t take a wage; don’t have taxable 
income; put your money into stocks. 
That was what we did see during the 
pandemic, and they ended up with even 
more financial resources than anyone 
imagined, while we read the news arti-
cles describing how they paid little or 
no income tax for years on end. 
As the chairman of the Senate Fi-
nance Committee, a top priority of 
mine—and I don’t see how anybody can 
oppose this idea—is to say that when 
nurses and firefighters pay taxes with 
every paycheck every year, that we 
should say that the billionaires—we 
are glad they are so successful—should 
pay their fair share every year. 
So I have proposed a billionaire’s tax 
to close this loophole of unfairness. It 
just seems to me to be a basic question 
of fairness, for people in Nevada or Or-
egon or anywhere else, that we all pay 
our fair share—we all pay our fair 
share. And that is just one example of 
what Ms. Batchelder is going to be 
dealing with. 
For example, on clean energy, again, 
the Finance Committee wants to break 
some new ground. We said: Take the 44 
energy tax breaks that are on the 
books—most of them are relics from 
yesteryear—and 
put 
them 
in 
the 
dustbin of history, and in the future 
have one for clean energy, one for clean 
transportation fuel, and one for energy 
efficiency. 
And then, going forward, we will 
have tech neutrality. And we will say 
to every company: Everybody involved 
in the energy area, the more you re-
duce carbon emissions, the bigger your 
savings. The Senate Finance Com-
mittee never did anything like this in 
100 years. But to really carry this out, 
you are going to have to have really 
talented people like Lily Batchelder 
there. 
So she is going to understand what it 
means to make sure everybody pays 
their fair share, and that means bil-
lionaires are no longer exempt from 
paying their fair share. 
She is going to be a huge asset as we 
deal with climate change. And, my 
God, if people think about the last 6 
weeks—the Bootleg Fire in Oregon, and 
I know my colleague in Nevada has 
been clobbered by these fires; the 
storms in the South; and what we saw 
in the east coast of the United States— 
climate change has hit this country 
like a wrecking ball. 
We are going to have Lily Batchelder 
confirmed, I hope, here very shortly.

September 22, 2021 
Those are the kinds of policy ideas she 
is going to be able to pursue. 
The Treasury Department needs a 
tax policy point guard, somebody who, 
in effect—and everybody knows I went 
to school on a basketball scholarship 
dreaming of playing in the NBA. You 
always admired the person who ran the 
floor, who was the point guard, who 
really made sure the work got done and 
didn’t really care who got the credit. 
That is Lily Batchelder. And if ever 
there was a person who could really 
help chip away at the polarization be-
tween Democrats and Republicans, it is 
Lily Batchelder. 
I support her nomination fully. I urge 
my colleagues to do the same, and I 
yield the floor. 
Madam President, I have one more 
nomination to discuss, and I would ask 
unanimous consent that I could com-
plete my remarks—and I will be brief 
on this nomination—before we vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JAYME RAY WHITE 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, next, 
the Senate is considering the nomina-
tion of Jayme White for the position of 
Deputy U.S. Trade Representative. 
Now, Senators know that Jayme has 
been a longtime member of my Finance 
Committee staff. So I won’t bury that 
lede today. We feel, all of us who have 
had a chance to work with him in the 
Finance Committee—and he has been 
supported by business and labor and 
Senators who worked together with 
him repeatedly over the years on com-
plicated trade issues. We all come to-
gether to make the case that Jayme 
will be an exemplary Deputy USTR 
representative. 
He is a topnotch advocate for our 
workers, our businesses, our farmers, 
and our ranchers. His confirmation will 
be a loss for the Senate Finance Com-
mittee—I can tell you that—but it is 
going to be the American people’s gain. 
For a little bit on Jayme’s back-
ground, he is from our part of the 
world, the Pacific Northwest. He is a 
son of union workers near Seattle. He 
has worked on trade policy for more 
than 20 years on Capitol Hill. We kind 
of lured him away from his old job, 
working for his hometown representa-
tive, Congressman Jim McDermott. 
And since 2014, he has been the top 
trade and competitiveness adviser for 
the Finance Committee Democrats. 
I have had a front-row seat watching 
Jayme for over a decade, and what he 
has always tried to do is reach across 
the aisle and say: Look, we know that 
to create more high-skilled, high-wage 
jobs in the private sector—and in our 
part of the world that is crucial. One 
out of four jobs depends on trade, and 
trade jobs pay better, often, than the 
nontrade jobs. You have to think about 
workers and the environment and good 
governance. And Jayme brings Mem-
bers together from both sides of the 
aisle to make sure our trade policies in 
those areas are durable for the long 
term. 
He has been way ahead of the pack on 
the need for more aggressive trade en-
forcement. Years ago, when I was 
chairman of the Finance Trade Sub-
committee—our colleague Max Baucus 
was chairman of the full committee— 
Jayme set up a sting operation, an ac-
tual sting operation, with a dummy 
website to show how the trade cheats, 
the rip-off artists, were able to launder 
merchandise and avoid paying customs 
duties. They would ship goods through 
other countries, slap a new label on 
something with different information 
on their products, and managed to slip 
them into the American market. That 
experience helped us write and build 
momentum 
for 
trade 
enforcement, 
came to be known as the ENFORCE 
Act, passed a few years later. 
When the Trump administration’s 
new NAFTA was weak on enforcement, 
Jayme and Ambassador Tai worked to 
make huge improvements. And we all 
worked together in our committee. 
There were many of us. And, certainly, 
our colleague Senator BROWN of Ohio, 
who has championed this for so many 
years, this effort, this bipartisan effort 
to strengthen enforcement, made sure 
that USMCA raised the bar over any 
other trade agreement in history in 
terms of enforceable commitments on 
labor rights and the environment. He 
has been a champion of transparency 
and accountability. 
And I can tell you, when I came into 
public life, people hardly knew any-
thing about trade agreements that 
were getting ready to be voted on. I 
mean, you would go home for a meet-
ing and people would ask you about 
some trade proposal, and you would be 
kind of in the dark. Jayme wanted to 
make sure that the days when well- 
connected reporters and insiders in the 
industry knew more than Members of 
Congress and the public about what 
was being negotiated—Jayme said: We 
are going to change that. And we did. 
There are now concrete rules giving 
Members access to negotiating text 
while the negotiations happen. Final 
text-to-trade agreements have to be 
public for anybody to see for a min-
imum of 60 days before the Congress 
can consider approving it. Those com-
mitments to transparency, new ac-
countability, which we had nothing 
like when I came into public life, come 
about because of Jayme’s hard work. 
So I will sum it all up. I know we are 
waiting for our vote. What I have come 
to say—and we have all listened to the 
debates about free trade and fair trade 
and the like—Jayme understands that 
our challenge, for all of us, for our 
workers and our small businesses and 
to protect the rights of all concerned, 
we have got to have trade done right— 
trade done right: rigorously enforce the 
trade laws on the books, make sure 
that there is more transparency and 
accountability, 
and, 
particularly, 
make sure that foreign markets—for-
eign markets—are open to American 
products and American workers. 
I will just tell you, I am sorry to lose 
him after 12 years on my staff. I always 
knew that he would be going off to big 
things. I wasn’t sure it was going to be 
this soon. 
Twenty-five members of the Finance 
Committee agreed with me when they 
voted to send his nomination to the 
floor. He has got 110 percent of my sup-
port. I urge my colleagues to vote yes 
on the White nomination. 
My understanding is we will vote 
first on the Batchelder nomination 
that I spoke about earlier and that a 
bit later in the evening, we will vote on 
Mr. White. I strongly urge colleagues 
to vote for both.

upon the table, and the President will 
be immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be recog-
nized as if in morning business for such 
time as I shall consume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first 
of all, I am going to do something that 
is a little bit unusual. I will start off 
by saying thank you. We have got a lot 
of people to thank. Yet we never seem 
to do that. 
When we look at what happened in 
Afghanistan over the past 20 years—I 
can’t approximate how many times I 
was over there—that was tough duty 
for those guys and the gals there; it 
was not easy. This is not the place you 
want to go take a vacation—and to 
their families. Then, of course, on Au-
gust 26, we were reminded so painfully 
of what we ask our troops and their 
families to do. They lay it all on the 
line for this country. Our servicemem-
bers represent the very best of us. Over 
the past 20 years, they did everything 
that they could in Afghanistan to root 
out evil and to champion American 
values. I couldn’t be more grateful to 
or have more respect for them than I 
have today. 
I say this not only because we should 
say it more often but because it is im-
portant to remember that what we saw 
in Afghanistan over the past few 
months was not a failure of our mili-
tary; it was a failure of the Commander 
in Chief—the President of the United 
States—and the people who advised 
him on his policy in Afghanistan. 
I still don’t know who those people 
are, and, you know, I have chaired the 
Senate Armed Services Committee and 
other committees. People ask me, 
when I go back to my State of Okla-
homa—they will say: Hey, who is advis-
ing the President to do all these 
things? I have to tell them I don’t 
know, and I have been around for a 
long time. I don’t remember any ad-
ministration where I just honestly 
didn’t know who was making the deci-
sions and who was advising—in this 
case, advising the President. 
But what we did witness, though, was 
a failure of the Commander in Chief 
and whoever was advising him. No one 
can look at what happened over the 
past few months and claim that it was 
a success like President Biden did. It 
was a disaster. Leaving Americans be-
hind, and allies—don’t forget our allies 
who are still left behind. It was un- 
American. 
The administration keeps saying: 
‘‘We didn’t inherit a plan.’’ That is 
false. They inherited a condition-based 
agreement and made their own policy 
decisions. It was condition-based; it 
wasn’t open-ended. It was something 
that was out there, and they had the 
reins. 
Let’s keep in mind, this administra-
tion has a majority in the House and 
the Senate and the White House, and 
they make their own decisions. And 
they say: We didn’t have a plan. They 
had a plan, and we had a plan, but ev-
erything we did and the previous ad-
ministration did was condition-based. 
So according to the condition-based 
approach, President Trump agreed to 
withdraw our troops from Afghanistan 
if and only if the Taliban acted against 
al-Qaida. Now, that is one of the 
things. There were many other condi-
tions, and one condition was to leave 
some of our troops there, not just to 
walk away, to vacate. And those condi-
tions were in line when this adminis-
tration came in, and that didn’t hap-
pen. President Biden knows it. Sec-
retary Blinken admitted it. 
When President Biden announced his 
decision to withdraw back in April, a 
senior administration official told the 
Washington Post: ‘‘The President has 
judged that a condition-based approach 
is a recipe for staying in Afghanistan 
forever.’’ That is a quote. 
Just last week, in front of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, when 
asked if the Taliban had severed its re-
lationship with al-Qaida, Secretary 
Blinken said the relationship has not 
been severed. 
Let’s keep that in mind. We keep 
hearing that, yes, they are taking ac-
tion against that administration, but 
the relationship has not been severed. 
Now President Biden says that he 
will hold the Taliban accountable, but 
he didn’t hold the Taliban accountable 
while our troops were still in Afghani-
stan. I mean, that is when we had the 
leverage to do it, but we didn’t do it, 
and he has presented no plan for hold-
ing the terrorists accountable now. 
This 
decision—this 
rushed 
with-
drawal 
that 
has 
left 
the 
Taliban 
stronger than it was in 9/11 was Presi-
dent Biden’s alone. He is responsible 
for the chaos that followed. He is going 
to be held accountable and should—ev-
eryone who advised him to make such 
a horrible decision. 
Now, what is more outrageous to me 
is that President Biden left Americans 
behind. That is not something we do. 
He said that we were going to get ev-
eryone out, and that didn’t happen. 
You know, when historians look back 
at this—this may be decades from now, 
centuries from now—this is what they 
will remember: The Biden administra-
tion knowingly left Americans behind. 
The administration has tried to 
downplay this. Early in the evacuation, 
Secretary of State Blinken said that 
there were perhaps 10,000 or 15,000 
American citizens in Afghanistan. Our 
men and women in uniform, working 
tirelessly and effectively with our dip-
lomats under incredibly difficult cir-
cumstances, 
managed 
to 
evacuate 
about 6,000 of our citizens. Now, ac-
cording to my math, that means that 
between 4,000 and 9,000 Americans were 
left behind. Secretary Blinken says 
that there were only 100 and that the 
rest of them preferred to stay in Af-
ghanistan. 
By the way, some legitimately did 
prefer to stay in Afghanistan because 
they were married people, they had 
families, and they made it very clear 
that—when something like this nor-
mally happens, families are moved as a 
family unit. Not there. That is not 
what happened. 
So that is more than bad math; it is 
a lie. We know and every congressional 
office that tried to get people out of Af-
ghanistan knows—and I know this be-
cause our Senate office was very busy 
at that time helping people to get 
out—that there were many U.S. citi-
zens who wanted to leave Afghanistan, 
but they couldn’t leave because the 
Taliban would not let their families go 
with them. Well, that is exactly what I 
would expect from the terrorists who 
were there at that time. 
So Secretary Blinken wants you to 
think that these people made a choice. 
He wants to hide the fact that the ad-
ministration in which he serves created 
its own hostage crisis and gave the 
Taliban the upper hand. 
Keep in mind when we talk about 
this, it is the Taliban. They were the 
terrorists. 
He also wants you to think it was the 
fault of those families they didn’t get 
out before August, repeating that they 
had been telling Americans to leave for 
months. There is a kernel of truth to 
that, but it is clouded by the fact that 
they repeatedly stated that it would be 
a year, probably more, before Kabul 
was at risk of falling to the Taliban. 
Instead of 36 months, the fall of Kabul 
only took 36 hours. 
In addition to American citizens, 
President Biden left behind our Afghan 
partners who risked everything to sup-
port our shared security goals. I was 
out there many times in the past, talk-
ing about that very thing, about the 
problems they had and the dangers 
they were in. 
Now, these are not our American 
citizens; they were some of our allies 
who were left over there. In addition to 
American citizens, President Biden left 
behind our Afghan partners who risked 
everything to support our shared secu-
rity goals. As a result of the Presi-
dent’s decision, Afghan women and 
children have been thrown back to the 
stone age. We all know that. We know 
what they are doing right now. We 
don’t have to guess. 
Our allies and partners around the 
world are questioning our credibility, 
our leadership, and our commitment. 
These are our allies. They are not used 
to having the rug pulled out from 
under them. This is the first time. 
Our enemies are bolstered by Presi-
dent Biden’s policy, which puts Taliban 
terrorists in charge of Afghanistan—a 
policy that spread the perception that 
we not only abandoned our allies and 
partners, but we also abandoned our 
own citizens. 
Seeing all these failures, Americans 
are 
demanding 
accountability, 
and 
they deserve it.

But let’s make this crystal clear: 
None of this is the fault of our mili-
tary. Our military leaders, the ones 
with real experience on the ground, ad-
vised the same thing that I did, and 
that is, leave a small force in Afghani-
stan. Now, this would have supported 
the Afghan military, prevented the 
Taliban’s takeover, kept the pressure 
on the terrorists, reassured our re-
gional partners, and kept our homeland 
safe. 
President Biden pretends that none 
of this was possible. He claims that he 
had two options: a massive deployment 
or zero troops, which is not true. In 
fact, I publicly supported a third op-
tion: maintain a small force to pre-
serve our air power. We can’t do the air 
power without some troops on the 
ground. We needed to have some troops 
on the ground—we did—counterterror-
ism operations and military options. 
Many of us here supported a small, 
tailored deployment to protect our 
core interests, and so did his own mili-
tary advisers. Yet, when he was asked, 
‘‘Did your top military advisers warn 
against withdrawing on this timeline? 
Did they ask you to keep 2,500 troops?’’ 
President Biden said, ‘‘No, they didn’t. 
That wasn’t true.’’ 
But it was true. We talked to the—in 
fact, you are going to find something 
out this coming Tuesday when we have 
a hearing. We are going to have many 
of the principals whom we really 
haven’t heard from, principals who 
were involved in advising the adminis-
tration as to what the military wanted 
and didn’t want. 
Except it was. We know that now. 
The former commander of U.S. Forces- 
Afghanistan, General Miller, told the 
Senate Armed Services Committee just 
this last week—this is our committee, 
the committee I chaired for some pe-
riod of time—he said no. Now, he didn’t 
tell President Biden directly because 
President Biden didn’t even bother 
calling his top commander on the 
ground before making his decision, but 
General Miller did report it to the 
chain of command. 
Now, we are talking about General 
Miller. At that time, he was the top 
commander on the ground. So the 
President didn’t even consult him as to 
whether or not we should—he made it 
very clear he advised him not to go, 
not to close everything up. 
He also tried to say that al-Qaida is 
‘‘gone’’ from Afghanistan and that 
‘‘terrorism is not emanating from that 
part of the world.’’ Well, we know that 
is not true. General McKenzie said al- 
Qaida remains the main focus in the re-
gion. 
Last week, the Director of the De-
fense Intelligence Agency—that is LTG 
Scott Berrier—said that the projected 
timeline for al-Qaida to have the capa-
bility to threaten our homeland is 1 to 
2 years at most, if not sooner, and that 
is it. 
So President Biden was not telling 
the truth in that area about having 
only two choices. He didn’t tell the 
truth about getting American families 
out of Afghanistan. He failed to tell the 
truth about the advice that he got 
from his military commanders, saying 
that his military commanders did not 
advise him. We know better than that, 
and if you don’t know it, stick around 
for next Tuesday, and you will find out. 
He didn’t tell the truth about al-Qaida 
not being a threat. 
So I have to wonder, if he is not tell-
ing the truth about this, what else is 
he not telling the truth about? If we 
can’t trust the President on this, if we 
can’t trust him to tell the truth and we 
can’t trust him to put together a good 
strategy in Afghanistan, how can we 
trust him to protect the Nation from 
our strategic competitors? 
After 
watching 
President 
Biden 
stumble badly in Afghanistan, I am 
worried that he won’t pursue a strong 
strategy to push back on China, and 
China is our top threat right now. We 
all know that. We don’t like to talk 
about it, but it is true. 
As former Secretary Gates famously 
wrote in his memoir, President Biden 
has ‘‘been wrong on nearly every major 
foreign policy and national security 
issue over the past four decades.’’ That 
was Secretary Gates, former Secretary 
of Defense. 
I am also worried about the adminis-
tration desperately trying again to re-
turn to the Obama administration’s 
failed Iran deal and offering Iran mas-
sive sanctions relief, sanctions that 
were put on in the previous administra-
tion to get their—of course, we know 
Iran would just use the sanctions relief 
to ramp up terrorism. 
You know, I don’t know how the 
American people—maybe it is the peo-
ple in Oklahoma. They are the ones I 
have talked to more than any other 
groups. You know, what else would 
they do? What would Iran, with their 
background, do with sanction relief or 
with funds? They would use it on ter-
rorism. That brings us back to Afghan-
istan, which is only one of many, many 
examples in the Middle East and North 
Africa where the administration has no 
plan for countering terrorists and 
keeping us safe. 
President Biden and his administra-
tion have broadly talked about a new 
over-the-horizon strategy to counter-
terrorism. ‘‘Over the horizon’’ means 
that we don’t have boots on the 
ground. We send airplanes in from 
afar—something our military leaders 
have told us is way more difficult than 
most people believe, far more expen-
sive, and almost impossible without 
partners on the ground. 
We can’t do it. You can’t just lead 
with military airpower. Even if it is 
possible, experts are telling us it won’t 
be effective. We haven’t even seen a 
plan for how this will be enough to 
keep American families safe. 
This is a failure of leadership. Along 
the way, President Biden has tried to 
blame everyone else—the Afghan Secu-
rity Forces, the Afghan Government, 
and the previous administration. But 
the blame lands squarely on him, and 
he owns this. 
We should expect his failures in Af-
ghanistan to bleed into other issues. 
China and Russia see a weak America 
now. Terrorists see safe havens and use 
Afghanistan as a rallying cry. 
I still have a lot more questions and 
expect President Biden and his admin-
istration to have more answers. Thir-
teen brave Americans died in the chaos 
created by President Biden’s policies. 
We need explanations and we need ac-
countability. 
We are going to hear from Secretary 
Austin, General Milley, and General 
McKenzie next week. This is going to 
be on Tuesday. I have reminded people 
of that for a long time because we need 
to have a clear understanding, and we 
will get that understanding. We are 
going to start to understand this—just 
what went wrong, who is to blame, and 
what we need to do to protect our-
selves. This is going to be an open 
meeting. This is not a classified meet-
ing. This is an open meeting that is 
going to take place this coming Tues-
day. We are going to be doing this as 
transparently and openly as possible 
because the American people deserve 
the truth. Our servicemembers and 
their families who sacrificed so much 
over the last 20 years deserve that, too, 
and we are going to give them the 
truth. That is going to happen next 
week. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THE CHILD TAX CREDIT 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, it is al-
ways a thrill to come to the floor to 
talk about the child tax credit, espe-
cially with three colleagues who really 
are the authors and the most impor-
tant pushers, if you will, of this bill in 
the Senate. 
I am going to turn it to Senator BEN-
NET—he and I worked on this for damn 
close to a decade now—and Senator 
BOOKER. And then we will be joined last 
by Senator WARNOCK, who has only 
been in the Senate for a year—not 
even—and has done so much already 
for the State of Georgia, and he is one 
of the best supporters of this in the 
U.S. Senate. 
So I will reserve my comments for a 
little later. Senator BENNET will go 
first. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleague from Ohio, Sen-
ator BROWN, for his remarkable leader-
ship in getting us to this point with the 
child tax credit and with the earned in-
come tax credit for childless families 
which, thanks to his leadership, we 
have been able to triple.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6611 
September 22, 2021 
But I think we are here today on a 
really, really momentous matter. When 
I think back to the days when I was the 
superintendent of schools in Denver, 
most of the kids in my city were kids 
of color and most were living in pov-
erty, and many of their families were 
working two or three jobs. And no mat-
ter what they did, they couldn’t get 
their kids out of poverty. 
Today, now, I travel the State of Col-
orado, a State that has got very rural 
areas and very urban areas. If I had to 
summarize the last 10 years of my 
townhalls—10 or 11 years—it is very 
easy to do it. No matter what county I 
am in, people say: We are killing our-
selves, and no matter what we do, we 
can’t afford some combination of hous-
ing, healthcare, higher education, early 
childhood education—if there is any 
childhood education. We can’t save. We 
feel like our kids are going to live a 
more diminished life than the life we 
lived. 
That is the anecdotal reflection of an 
economy that, for 50 years in this 
country, has worked really well for the 
top 10 percent of Americans and not for 
anybody else. The result of that is, 
today, the United States is 38th out of 
41 industrialized countries, in terms of 
childhood poverty. 
The poorest people in our society are 
our children. The poorest generation in 
the United States of America are our 
children, which is scandalous. 
Senators BROWN, BOOKER, WARNOCK, 
and then-Senator HARRIS, before that, 
and I came together to try to address it 
and to say that we don’t have to accept 
this much childhood poverty as a per-
manent feature of our economy or a 
permanent feature of our society. We 
can actually fix this by making three 
changes to the child tax credit: to in-
crease the amount and make it fully 
refundable, so that for the first time in 
our country’s history the poorest kids 
have the benefit of it; and to have it 
paid out on a monthly basis, so that 
when parents and grandparents are at 
the end of the month trying to make 
the rent or buy a few more groceries or 
pay for a little bit more childcare, they 
are able to do it in real time. 
I am sure my colleagues on the floor 
today spent time meeting with people 
in their States over the recess. I did. I 
met mostly moms, but parent after 
parent after parent, who said to me: 
For the first time in my life, I was able 
to buy back-to-school clothes, and I 
didn’t bankrupt my family. Buying 
back-to-school clothes was not a catas-
trophe for my family. My kid was able 
to go to school in a new shirt. 
One mom in Colorado Springs said to 
me that she bought a bicycle for her 
son so he could take himself to school 
and participate in afterschool pro-
grams that he wouldn’t have otherwise 
been able to participate in, because he 
could take himself there and bring 
himself back. 
She said that he had burst a tire in 
this new bicycle and that she was able, 
because of the child tax credit, not to 
buy the cheap tire that she would ordi-
narily buy that would break next 
week—as she said—but to buy a tire 
that the kid could rely on. She said, 
‘‘That is what being poor in America is 
like; you have to pay a tax on every-
thing,’’ because you can’t buy a decent 
pair of shoes and you can’t buy a de-
cent tire for a bike. 
This is a reason why 450 economists 
have written to the administration 
saying we should be making this per-
manent. And I believe we should be 
making it permanent. They have also 
pointed out that it is very important 
for people to hear that this is pro- 
work. The countries that have child al-
lowances like this actually have a 
higher percentage of people in the 
workforce than we do, because people 
can use that allowance to pay for a lit-
tle extra childcare so they can stay at 
work. They can use that allowance to 
help pay to fix a car so they can stay 
at work. This is a pro-work policy. 
Just as importantly, childhood pov-
erty costs our country $1 trillion a 
year. We have been told by Columbia 
University that we are going to see an 
8x annual return as a result of cutting 
childhood poverty in half this year, 
which this policy does, as opposed to 
spending money just to mitigate the ef-
fects of childhood poverty. 
So there is every reason in the world 
that we should make this permanent, 
that we should extend it. In my view, 
we can’t afford not to, and that is why 
we are here today. 
I want to thank my colleague from 
New Jersey, Senator BOOKER, some-
body I have known since he was mayor 
of Newark and I was the super-
intendent 
of 
the 
Denver 
Public 
Schools, and we were working together 
to try to lift up kids in our respective 
communities. There have been many 
times when I have been on this floor 
and I have said that we are treating 
America’s children like they are some-
one else’s children, that only a country 
that didn’t care about their kids would 
treat our kids the way we have. 
But, finally, we are not. Finally, we 
said: We are not going to tolerate this. 
And a lot of that has to do with the 
Senator from New Jersey’s leadership. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank the two leaders that I joined, 
Senators BROWN and BENNET, for cham-
pioning this issue, not just for this 
Congress but for years. Before I came 
to Washington, these two men were 
standing up and talking about the 
moral core of our country. 
If you want to see how a nation is 
doing, don’t look at the buildings we 
build or at how many billionaires we 
have. Just look at children. What is 
galling me right now is that we have 
come to the 1-yard line. 
We are at an inflection point in our 
country where we have to ask a ques-
tion: Who are we? 
My friend Senator BENNET and I have 
been working with kids well before we 
came here. He rattled off data that 
should be repeated. I say this is a 
moral issue, but he has shown us it is 
an economic issue. We are the wealthi-
est Nation on the planet Earth, and of 
the top 41 countries, we are at 38 in 
poor kids. What he pointed out is that 
poverty costs all of us. It is a deep, 
self-inflicted wound in this society, be-
cause poverty costs this Nation over $1 
trillion as measured by economists. 
But I would state that economists 
don’t measure all the things that are 
important. Our GDP does not reflect 
well-being. It doesn’t reflect how many 
antidepressants people take or how 
many child deaths there are. But the 
truth of our economy is that every dol-
lar that we invest in getting children 
out of poverty returns $8 to this econ-
omy. So it is an economic issue, clear-
ly. 
It is a globally competitive issue be-
cause in a global, knowledge-based so-
ciety, the Nation whose children learn 
the most will earn the most and will 
outcompete. 
It is a national security issue as we 
go up against countries like China, 
whose top 10 percent of their grad-
uating high school classes outnumber 
all the children we have, virtually. 
But it is a moral issue most of all. If 
we are going to create a more beloved 
community, how do we treat our chil-
dren? 
Children who live in poverty literally 
have physical effects. Poverty is vio-
lence. Study after study shows that the 
brain development of children in pov-
erty is inhibited, literally—the stress 
hormones, the cortisol. It is akin to an 
adult having a traffic accident every 
single day. It is an indicator of child-
hood trauma. 
Poverty is a moral obscenity, and we, 
the richest Nation on the planet, 
where, year after year, our rich are 
getting richer, our children are getting 
poorer—who are we when we pledge al-
legiance to a flag and say ‘‘liberty and 
justice for all’’? Who are we? 
We don’t even know the demographic 
changes in our country. We have cities 
across America where 1 out of every 10 
children is being raised by a grand-
parent. So here we are discussing child-
hood poverty, and some people are 
talking 
about 
work 
requirements, 
when we know from the data, from con-
servative think tanks to what we see in 
other nations like Canada, that things 
like the child allowance—or in our 
country, the child tax credit—increase 
workforce participation. But if you get 
rid of the child tax credit, those grand-
parents raising grandchildren—half of 
them—plunge back into poverty. 
The stories are profound. 
We heard from my colleague from 
Colorado. We know families in New 
Jersey, like a woman I just saw named 
Margarita. She used her child tax cred-
it payments for exactly what so many 
said they would be used for. She used 
them for food for her children, for 
school supplies, to keep the electricity 
running in her house. We have heard

stories that they are used for a car bill 
to get people to work. They are used to 
pay for childcare that they need for 
their families so that they can work. 
Families are not using this money so 
they could quit their jobs. Quite the 
contrary, they are using them so they 
can get to work. 
We are a nation in crisis because of 
how we treat our children. The child 
tax credit is a lifeline for the millions 
of grandparents raising grandchildren. 
It is a lifeline for low-income children. 
So you heard from Senator BENNET. 
We are at an inflection point. What 
will we do right now? Will we extend 
the child tax credit? Will we make the 
full refundability permanent? Will we 
keep people having these monthly 
checks? That is a policy question. But 
the question before us really is a moral 
one. For once and for all, this is not 
partisan. It is a defining moment for 
the character of our country, and I say 
words are not enough. 
We should show the child tax credit— 
the truth in our policies and what we 
do with our budgets. We should show 
our love through what we do, not what 
we say. And the best leading indicator 
of that will always be how the most 
vulnerable in our society are doing, 
how we take care of our elderly, and, in 
this case, how we care for our children. 
I am honored now to have come to 
the floor our Senator from Georgia. I 
would remark that as much as I love 
the Senator from Ohio and the Senator 
from Colorado, the Senator from Geor-
gia has a much better haircut. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator BOOKER, and I join my friend 
Senator WARNOCK here to talk about 
this. Thanks to Senator BENNET, Sen-
ator BOOKER, and Senator WARNOCK for 
their leadership on what I think is the 
most important thing I have done in 
my years in public office: the child tax 
credit that Senator BENNET and I began 
on years and years and years ago, 
joined by other colleagues. Senator 
WARNOCK has really taken it over in a 
big way this year in getting it across 
the finish line. Sorry for the sports 
metaphor, but that is how important 
this is. 
Senator 
BENNET
said 
something 
about—and I guess Senator BOOKER— 
that raising children is work. At least 
one of my colleagues—a number of my 
colleagues on that side of the aisle, and 
I believe a colleague or two on this side 
of the aisle, said something about a 
work requirement in a child tax credit. 
And I don’t understand that because I 
spent a lot of time, including this 
weekend, with my grandchildren, and I 
see how hard my daughters work rais-
ing children and our son works raising 
children and the pressures. And this 
bill, cutting everything else away, re-
lieves some of the anxiety that parents 
face, the anxiety of how do I get the 
money together to pay the rent this 
week, before the end of the month, so I 
don’t get evicted or I don’t get behind 
in my rent—just the opportunities for 
these parents. 
So I want to talk directly—directly— 
to Ohio parents. We talk about parents 
and about the child tax credit. I want 
to talk to Ohio parents for a moment. 
Parents, check your bank accounts. 
A week ago today, we once again put 
money directly in the pockets of the 
families of most Ohio parents. The 
families of 92 percent of Ohio children 
are getting these dollars either direct 
deposit in their accounts or in their 
mailboxes in checks. It started July 15, 
then August 15, and then September 15. 
It will continue. Our goal on the floor 
today is to make this permanent; at 
least to make sure this goes beyond the 
end of the year. We are going to suc-
ceed in doing that. It is so important 
that we do. 
Back to talking to parents. We know 
how hard you work at your jobs and 
raising your kids. Any parent knows 
how much work it is to take care of 
children, especially young children. It 
has only gotten harder over the last 
year and a half. The pressures are 
greater. The anxiety placed on families 
is more. 
We have not recognized in this coun-
try often enough that raising children 
is work. If you have a job outside the 
home, you are probably not getting 
paid what you are worth. We have seen 
what has happened over the past few 
decades. 
Productivity has gone up. Stock 
prices have soared. Executive com-
pensation is stratospheric. The wages 
have been flat. Wages for most Ameri-
cans have barely budged; meanwhile, 
you all as parents know how expensive 
it 
is 
to 
raise 
kids—childcare, 
healthcare, school lunches, diapers, 
clothes, school supplies, braces, sports 
fees. The list never seems to end. That 
is not to mention trying to put money 
away—just a few dollars a month—try-
ing to put money away for college or 
sending your kid to camp or maybe— 
maybe, as I have heard from some par-
ents—for the first time in 2 or 3 years, 
they are going to get to take a little 
vacation for a few days or maybe, once 
a month, going out to dinner at the 
local diner. 
You feel like you can’t keep up no 
matter how hard you work. It is why 
we passed the child tax credit. It is 
why we started, several years ago, 
working to get other Senators on board 
until we had virtually, literally, every 
Senator on this side of the aisle. Every 
single Democrat has voted for the child 
tax credit twice already. 
Unfortunately, every single Repub-
lican voted against it. I don’t even 
really understand why they are against 
it when, you know, you could look out 
down the aisle here, you can look down 
the hall, and Senator MCCONNELL’s of-
fice is down the hall, and you see the 
lobbyists lining up there. They always 
get their tax cuts. 
A train carrying tax cuts leaves the 
station whenever Republicans are in 
power—a tax cut for wealthy people— 
but this is a tax cut for working fami-
lies, and we know how important that 
is. It is finally—finally—to America’s 
parents, making your hard work pay 
off so you can keep up with those extra 
expenses that keep coming and coming 
and coming when you are raising a 
family. 
Stories have poured into our office 
from parents across Ohio about these 
tax cuts. Let me just give you snippets 
of several of them. 
Katie in Akron: It helps pay for 
school supplies. 
Caitlin: It pays for preschool for my 
son. 
Lindsay: It is back-to-school clothes. 
Fern: It will pay for preschool for 
both of my children, and the rest is 
going into a savings account for them. 
From Melissa: I used part of it to buy 
school uniform pieces for my 4-year- 
old. 
Jennifer: Put it away for college tui-
tion. 
Maia: Food and school supplies. 
And one of the most common stories 
we hear over and over is that parents 
are using this to afford childcare so 
they can go back to work or keep 
working or work a few more hours. 
One mother from Minford in South-
ern Ohio near Portsmouth, wrote to 
me, and she said: 
My husband and I are middle class, raising 
two children [both] under 6. . . . We have 
been worried about the financial burden of 
paying for 2 children in full-time child care. 
The $300, per child, will be placed directly 
towards child care so . . . we [don’t] have to 
worry about how my participation in the 
workforce affects us, and allow us to partici-
pate more in the economy. 
She continued: 
I believe these payments will allow more 
parents, especially mothers, to participate 
more fully in the workforce, [allowing] them 
more time to pursue training, and help 
American families [get] food on the table. 
From the bottom of my heart, thank you. 
She really tells the story. You know 
in Connecticut and in Georgia that not 
everybody has gone back to work that 
could find work; in part, because em-
ployers are finally starting to pay 
more, but so much of the time because 
they can’t find childcare or they can’t 
afford childcare. We know that. That is 
what these tax cuts are all about. 
They are about the dignity of work. 
All work has dignity, whether you 
punch a clock or swipe a badge, wheth-
er you work on a salary or work for 
tips, whether you are raising children, 
or whether you are caring for aging 
parents. Raising children is work. Rais-
ing children is work. It is a hell of a lot 
more work than moving money from 
one overseas bank account to another 
or checking the balance in your stock 
portfolio. 
That didn’t stop Senator MCCONNELL 
and the Republican majority 2 or 3 
years ago from rewarding the CEOs and 
hedge fund managers and Swiss bank 
account holders. We all remember what 
happened. MITCH MCCONNELL—and the 
lobbyists lining up down the hall—and

the politicians who always do their bid-
ding passed their tax cut for the 
wealthy 
and 
corporations 
that 
outsource jobs. You know what they 
promised? They promised it would all 
trickle down and have more jobs and 
workers in Savannah—the hometown 
of the Senator from Georgia—that 
there will be more jobs and the workers 
would get more pay and the companies 
would invest more in the workforce. 
Well, it didn’t exactly happen that 
way. They kept their money for them-
selves. They spent that money on stock 
buybacks. Unsurprisingly, where did 
that money go? It goes in the pockets, 
mostly, of executives. 
Now, this year, without a single vote 
from 
Republicans 
in 
Congress, 
we 
passed tax cuts for everyone else. It is 
a pretty simple contrast. 
Whose side are you on? Do you want 
tax cuts for billionaires and corpora-
tions—that is what they did 4 years 
ago; that is what the President and the 
Congress did 4 years ago—or do you 
want tax cuts for working families? 
That is what Senator WARNOCK’s and 
Senator OSSOFF’s and President Biden’s 
elections meant in November and Jan-
uary of this year; that instead of more 
tax cuts for the richest people in the 
country—though that bill, 70 percent of 
the tax cuts or the benefits went to the 
richest 1 percent—now we are seeing 
our tax cut goes to 90 percent of the 
families in this country. 
Every single month we are showing 
parents and workers we are on your 
side. We will not stop fighting to make 
sure parents’ hard work pays off for 
years to come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I first 
want to say thank you to Senators 
BROWN, BENNET, and BOOKER for keep-
ing a spotlight on this issue. I must 
admit, however, on this issue, when I 
say Senators BROWN, BENNET, and 
BOOKER, I think about the multiple 
choice questionnaires we got in school, 
and I am wondering how a guy with a 
last name ‘‘Warnock’’ got to be a part 
of this effort, but I am grateful. 
I want to get right to the point. 
There are many reasons to move this 
Build Back Better American package 
forward. We have to build back better. 
We have a historic opportunity to 
make landmark investments that will 
strengthen our families, our economy, 
our care infrastructure, including ex-
panding Medicaid benefits to more 
than 4 million Americans. We have got 
600,000 Georgians in the Medicaid gap. 
We have got to provide critical debt re-
lief for small farmers who have taken a 
financial hit during the pandemic. All 
of these things are covered in this 
Build Back Better agenda. 
But the other top priority of mine, 
and why we are all here today, is that 
we have a chance to extend the ex-
panded child tax credit. We have al-
ready seen it making a difference in 
the lives of over 2.2 million children 
just in Georgia alone. 
I want to be clear about who this tax 
cut helps because people who have no 
vision engage in division, and some-
times when we are discussing these 
policies, we need to slow down and 
make sure folk know exactly whom we 
are talking about. 
Ninety-seven percent—97 percent—of 
American families with children would 
benefit from this tax cut. After we 
passed the American Rescue Plan, we 
significantly expanded the child tax 
credit and the earned income tax cred-
it. 
To put more money in the pockets of 
working families, I remember that 
Senator 
BOOKER—actually, 
Senator 
BENNET called me from his car. He was 
on his way back home. I had just got-
ten elected, and just a few short 
months after I got elected, we passed 
the American Rescue Plan because we 
won the majority and were able to do 
this. Senator BROWN said to me: RAPH-
AEL, this is one of the best days of my 
career because we were able to pass the 
American Rescue Plan with all of these 
amazing provisions, and this provision 
alone 
is 
transformational. 
Experts 
have said that this investment that we 
made earlier this year would cut child 
poverty in half nationwide. Think 
about that. One provision. Just giving 
ordinary people, hard-working fami-
lies, a break cuts child poverty in half. 
This is good public policy. 
But I will tell you what would be bad 
public policy. It is bad public policy to 
cut child poverty in half one year and 
then go back the very next year and 
double child poverty. That is poor pub-
lic policy. It is not right, and it is not 
smart. 
The expanded child tax credit is help-
ing Georgians. And do you want to 
know how I know that? I know be-
cause, as I am moving across the State, 
they are telling me. And it is no sur-
prise, when you put an extra $200 or 
$300 in the bank account of ordinary 
people, working people, it makes a 
huge difference. 
In my regular travels around the 
State, Georgians have told me how this 
tax cut for working families has made 
a difference in their lives, made their 
lives just a little bit easier, especially 
at the start of a new school year. 
A few weeks ago, I was down in Co-
lumbus, GA, and I met with some of 
the hard-working families who receive 
this tax cut. And as I stand here, I 
think about Dante and Alicia, a couple 
I met down in Columbus, GA. Their 
daughter’s name is London. And I 
asked them: What are you going to do 
with this monthly payment? 
And they said it will help cover the 
costs of school clothes and brain-build-
ing extracurricular activities. They 
have a very active young daughter, 
very bright, London. She came to the 
meeting. And they said that: We 
wouldn’t be able to afford these extra-
curricular activities, but this extra 
support, just this little lift, has made a 
difference in our personal economy, 
and it has made a difference for Lon-
don. 
I talked to Will, who works as a local 
hairdresser, and the monthly payment 
helps his 12-year-old daughter partici-
pate in karate tournaments, a develop-
ment opportunity that family would 
not otherwise be able to afford. 
In another conversation, I asked a 
Georgia mom of two young, growing 
boys: Where would this tax cut go? 
I said: What are you going to do with 
this tax cut? 
Do you know what she said to me? 
She said: I am going to buy food and 
shoes. 
You know, when you give ordinary 
folk a break, when you give them an 
extra $200 or $300 a month, you know, 
they go and buy extravagant things, 
like food and shoes and a coat for their 
kid. 
They invest in extracurricular activi-
ties because they want to see their 
children do a little bit better than they 
did. And when they invest in their chil-
dren, in a real sense, they invest in all 
of our children. 
When you give folk who already have 
everything they need and then some, 
you give them that money, they hold 
on to that money. But when you give 
money to ordinary folks, they put that 
money right back into our local econo-
mies and into our small businesses. 
Often the right thing to do is also the 
smart thing to do. It creates jobs, helps 
all of us. And so the expanded child tax 
credit grows and bolsters our economy 
from the bottom up. 
I agree with Senator BROWN. I am 
just old enough to remember when 
folks were talking about trickle-down 
economics. And as a pastor, I have 
worked and conducted my ministry in 
these communities that have been 
hearing folks talk about trickle down 
for the last 40 years. The way to grow 
an economy is from the bottom up. The 
right thing to do is the smart thing to 
do. 
The expanded child tax credit is 
changing lives right now, and we have 
a chance in this economic package we 
are working on to secure this invest-
ment for working Georgians and Amer-
icans into the future, and that is why I 
believe we should make it permanent, 
and I will keep advocating for that. 
But extending this critical tax cut 
right now is the right thing to do for 
working families. We ought to do it. 
We ought not just talk about it; we 
ought to do it. 
The Scripture says, He has shown 
you, O mortal, what is good. And what 
does the Lord require . . . but that you 
do justice, love kindness, and walk 
humbly with your God. 
I see the face of God in the faces of 
our children. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Texas. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, in 
June, our Democratic colleagues voted 
on their first and initial efforts to na-
tionalize our State-run and local-run 
election system. That bill—this legisla-
tion, this effort—had been years in the

September 22, 2021 
making. You know, in some ways, it is 
interesting to think about because 
back when our country was founded, 
there was a big debate on whether we 
should have a national government or 
whether we should have a Federal sys-
tem. And, of course, we opted for a 
Federal system where the States re-
tained their sovereignty within their 
authority, and all powers not delegated 
to the Federal Government were re-
tained by the States and the people. 
That is the very definition of a Federal 
system. 
So our colleagues on the Democratic 
side of the aisle have sort of renewed 
that debate again, trying to upend our 
Federal system of governance in favor 
of a national government, basically a 
command and control run out of Wash-
ington, DC. 
When it comes to the takeover of our 
elections or to try to nationalize our 
elections, the initial proposal surfaced 
as a messaging bill in 2019 but over the 
years has undergone a number of 
makeovers. Each time, our colleagues 
have tried to sell this radical change in 
the way that our elections are run by 
different appeals. 
They have talked about, well, this is 
important for election security. Re-
member the 2016 election, obviously— 
big concerns about Russian misin-
formation campaigns and cyber at-
tacks, and election security was obvi-
ously at top of mind. 
Then it was sold as a matter of re-
gaining the voters’ confidence that 
their vote would actually count. 
Then it was sold as a way to remove 
the obstacles that prevented people 
from voting, which appears to be the 
current message. 
Well, in 2020, in my State alone, but 
not just in Texas but across the coun-
try, we saw a record voter turnout. In 
my State, we said 66 percent of reg-
istered voters cast a ballot—11.3 mil-
lion people. 
The last time I had been on the bal-
lot, 6 years previously, we only had 4.8 
million voters, but we went from 4.8 to 
11.3 in just 6 years. Now, part of that is 
because my State has been growing. 
Between 2010 and 2020, we have seen 4 
million new Texans, either born or 
moved or made their way one way or 
another to our State. 
But the 2020 election saw the largest 
voter turnout in 120 years—120 years. 
Well, clearly, if people are voting—in-
cluding people of color, minorities—are 
voting at record levels, it is time to 
come up with a new sales pitch to try 
to sell this hijacking, really, of our 
State- and local-run elections. 
So a number of States, including my 
State, have recently passed legislation 
to address voter confidence, to make 
sure that elections are fair and that 
people have an opportunity to vote who 
are legally qualified to do so. The 
phrase many of them used in that proc-
ess was, they tried to make it easier to 
vote and harder to cheat. So that now 
has been the focus of our Democratic 
colleagues in trying to nationalize our 
State- and local-run elections, which, 
by the way, is ensconced within the 
framework of the Constitution itself. 
So our Democratic colleagues then 
attacked the State election laws and 
really just went over the top in terms 
of their description of what exactly 
was happening. Certainly it was not 
factual, but they said, in a number of 
cases, these changes in State election 
laws—and I am thinking of Georgia, 
Arizona, and Texas in particular—they 
said that they are the most sweeping 
attacks on the right to vote since the 
beginning of Jim Crow, and they said 
the only way to change that was to 
pass their election law. 
Our colleagues talked about the bill 
in terms of protecting the right to vote 
and strengthening our democracy. Who 
could be against that? But the reality 
of the situation is very different, and 
the 
far-reaching 
provisions 
of 
the 
Democratic election takeover bill look 
nothing like the safeguards of democ-
racy; they look more like a partisan 
power play. 
In the end, the only thing bipartisan 
about the bill was the opposition. In 
both the House and Senate, Repub-
licans and Democrats voted against the 
initial legislation, but our Democratic 
colleagues still refuse to recognize the 
reality of the vote and throw in the 
towel. 
After the failed vote this summer, 
our colleagues on the Democratic side 
went back to the drawing board and 
came back with a new bill they call the 
Freedom to Vote Act. Well, if we need-
ed any more proof that this is not a 
good-faith effort to strengthen our 
election but, rather, a partisan power 
play, the bill was introduced 1 week 
ago, and the Senate could end up vot-
ing on it as early as this week. That is 
hardly what I would call a deliberative 
process, one that even invites bipar-
tisan debate and consideration. 
So we may end up being required to 
vote on the bill—that is certainly the 
prerogative of the majority leader— 
with no real committee hearings, no 
real testimony from experts, and no in-
dication that this bill is really being 
taken seriously other than to check a 
box and to send a message. 
What has really been interesting is 
our colleagues on the left have said— 
they have tried to brand this as a com-
promise bill. I think that is primarily 
because of the objection of the Senator 
from West Virginia, Senator MANCHIN, 
who said he couldn’t support the origi-
nal bill. So they tried to come up with 
something that maybe looked more 
like a compromise but really isn’t, and 
I will talk about that more in a second. 
But this bill was not the result of bi-
partisan deliberations or consultation 
or communication even. As the Repub-
lican leader has noted, this so-called 
compromise bill is a compromise be-
tween the left and the radical left, 
which is hardly a compromise at all. 
But that is apparently the way that 
Leader SCHUMER
decides to run the 
Senate, after all, passing a $1.9 trillion 
spending bill right after Joe Biden be-
came President, with no Republican 
support, under the auspices of being 
COVID relief when only 10 percent of it 
actually had anything to do with 
COVID. 
Well, the good news is we have done 
a few bipartisan things. We passed the 
Endless Frontier Act—our way of try-
ing to address the challenge of China. 
We passed a bipartisan infrastructure 
bill. But now our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle want to do it 
alone again, and they are trying to 
pass a bill that could end up costing 
taxpayers as much as $5.5 trillion. A 
nominal figure is $3.5 trillion, but right 
now, they are experiencing a lot of dif-
ferences of opinion within their own 
ranks as to what is acceptable and 
what is not, and they certainly aren’t 
talking to us. 
But all the while, they have contin-
ued to work on a partisan effort to 
overrun our constitutional delegation, 
really, of the election system to State 
and local government. So no one 
should be fooled. This bill is not a com-
promise in any sense of the word. Just 
like its predecessor, this bill hijacks 
State constitutional power to make de-
cisions on things like voter registra-
tion and early voting. 
Actually, this morning in the Con-
stitution Subcommittee, the Senator 
from 
Connecticut, 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL, was talking about the 
fact that his State, Connecticut, did 
not have early in-person voting, but 
they have now passed a bill that pro-
vides for a referendum in Connecticut. 
If the referendum passes, then the 
State legislature may actually provide 
for early voting in person. 
I would just tell you that the con-
trast between the rhetoric and the re-
ality is pretty amazing because the 
Texas election law, passed by the State 
legislature just recently, provides for 
17 days of early voting in person. In 
other words, there is a fulsome oppor-
tunity for anybody who is qualified to 
vote to cast their ballot in person or by 
mail if you qualify or on the day of the 
election. As you can see, with 66 per-
cent of the registered voters actually 
taking advantage of that generous op-
portunity to cast their ballot, they did 
in historic numbers. 
Well, there is a saying that ‘‘if it is 
not broke, don’t fix it,’’ and there is 
nothing broke about our State- and 
local-run election systems. Certainly 
the guardrails are in place. If, for ex-
ample, someone were to deny a minor-
ity voter the opportunity to cast a bal-
lot or to make sure their ballot count-
ed just like anybody else’s, there is sec-
tion 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In fact, 
the Biden Department of Justice has 
filed such a lawsuit against Georgia 
based on the changes in their voting 
laws. So there is plenty of opportunity 
to raise these issues in court should 
the Federal Government and should 
the Biden administration wish to chal-
lenge them, but the truth is, they are 
going to lose because what they have

S6615 
September 22, 2021 
tried to do is to change through litiga-
tion what they cannot do constitu-
tionally through legislation. 
Well, this so-called compromise bill, 
which is no compromise at all, con-
tains invasive disclosure requirements 
that would attack the privacy of voters 
and chill free speech. It places hand-
cuffs on States when it comes to draw-
ing new legislative lines in redistrib-
uting, and it threatens action from the 
Attorney General if those standards 
aren’t met. It makes it too difficult to 
root out fraud and protect the integ-
rity of the vote by prohibiting voter ID 
for mail-in ballots and mandating drop 
boxes for ballots to be dropped by par-
tisan advocates. 
You know, people act like there is no 
such thing as voter fraud, but actually 
we have a famous case in Texas called 
Box 13 in Duval County, TX, where 
Coke 
Stevenson 
and 
LBJ—Lyndon 
Baines Johnson—were running for the 
Senate. 
You know what they found is, be-
cause of the manipulation of the voter 
rolls by the county judge in Duval 
County, literally, they had people who 
were already buried in the cemetery 
vote in favor of Lyndon Baines John-
son in alphabetical order once they fig-
ured out how many votes they needed 
to cast. 
That is just one famous example of 
voter fraud. Our Democratic colleagues 
act like it doesn’t exist. 
But what we did here in the Judici-
ary Committee a few months ago was 
the secretary of state for New Hamp-
shire—he is a Democrat, and they don’t 
have any early voting. It was inter-
esting to hear him say that he thinks 
the single most important factor when 
it comes to people casting their ballot 
is people’s confidence in the system 
that their ballot will actually be 
counted the way they voted. So all of 
these different times and conditions 
under which people can cast their bal-
lot, he says, really don’t have nearly as 
big an impact as just the confidence 
they have that their vote will be count-
ed as they cast it. 
And why our Democratic colleagues 
are opposed to voter ID is beyond me. 
We know Jimmy Carter and James 
Baker III—of course, Jimmy Carter, a 
former 
Democratic 
President; 
and 
James Baker III, a former prominent 
Secretary of State and Treasury Sec-
retary. They had a commission to look 
at things like voter ID, and they actu-
ally recommended that voter ID would 
be one way to instill public confidence 
in the integrity of the vote. 
You have to show your ID when you 
go through the Transportation Secu-
rity Administration—TSA—to get on 
an airplane. You have to show an ID if 
you are going to buy a pack of ciga-
rettes at a convenience store or six- 
pack of beer. I mean, we are accus-
tomed to people being required to iden-
tify who they are. If you want to get 
into a Federal building, you have to 
show an ID. 
So the idea that we should prohibit 
voter ID, to me, is ridiculous, and that 
is one of the provisions in the Demo-
crat substitute bill which is before us. 
It would prohibit the use of voter ID 
through mail-in ballots. 
But that is just the beginning. One of 
the most outlandish—or I should say 
on top of what I have already talked 
about—provisions of this bill is the use 
of taxpayer funds for campaigns. Well, 
a lot of companies have matching pro-
grams for charitable giving. That is a 
positive, good thing. If an employee do-
nates to a charity of their choice, 
many times their company will match 
that donation dollar for dollar. That is 
a positive thing. 
But, here, what happens is, instead of 
a charity getting the money, it is a po-
litical candidate. In other words, our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
are 
recom-
mending that for every dollar that is 
donated to a political candidate, the 
taxpayer kick in an extra 6 bucks. 
Well, I know some of these cam-
paigns that we have already run in re-
cently get to be pretty expensive cam-
paigns. But can you imagine that the 
taxpayers be asked to pony up $6 for 
every $1 that is contributed to the 
campaign? And is it really fair to ask 
taxpayers to subsidize the election of 
somebody they may disagree with? 
It makes no sense to me. Well, this 
means that if someone donates $200 to 
the preferred congressional candidate, 
the Federal Government could match 
with $1,200. And it is not the Federal 
Government; it is the taxpayer, by the 
way. 
Then there are the campaign vouch-
ers, which will provide eligible voters 
with a $25 voucher to donate to the 
campaign of their choosing. I am not 
making this up. This is what is in the 
legislation that, unfortunately, I don’t 
think many people have read or under-
stand. 
It is easy to imagine a better use of 
taxpayer funding, whether infrastruc-
ture, help for people who still are in 
need as a result of the COVID pan-
demic. It could go to crime victims or 
support a response to a humanitarian 
crisis at the border, like we are seeing 
in Del Rio, TX. But, no, our Demo-
cratic colleagues want to put it into 
the political campaigns of the can-
didates of their choice. 
Well, in addition to the rotten provi-
sions that are maintained from the pre-
vious bill, there is even more. The bill 
places immense power in the office of 
General Counsel of the Federal Elec-
tion Commission. He is an unelected of-
ficial. It lowers the legal standard to 
overturn voting laws. And it makes 
election day a Federal holiday, even 
though the bill mandates 15 days of 
early voting, which, again, by the way, 
is less than the State legislature has 
provided for in Texas. We have 17 days 
of early voting. 
Well, the truth is this is a so-called 
solution in search of a problem. The 
truth is there is no voter suppression 
epidemic. 
During the Obama administration, 
their Justice Department brought four 
lawsuits—four lawsuits—under section 
2 of the Voting Rights Act. If you 
thought there was an epidemic of voter 
suppression, 
don’t 
you 
think 
the 
Obama administration would have been 
more active and more vigilant? 
Again, there is the fact that the 2020 
elections saw the highest turnout in 
120 years for all racial and ethnic 
groups. Over the last 4 years, States 
across the country undertook efforts to 
keep their elections free from fraud 
and foreign interference. 
By the way, one of the conclusions 
following the 2016 election by the intel-
ligence community was that the dis-
persed and diffused nature of our elec-
tions actually made it harder for Rus-
sia to impact the outcome because 
they would have had to do so in all 50 
States. 
If this was all run out of Washington, 
DC, and one black box appeared, it 
would probably be easier for them to 
concentrate their efforts on one loca-
tion rather than 50 locations and in-
crease the likelihood of their ability to 
influence the outcome. 
Well, we have kicked in—here in Con-
gress—hundreds of millions of dollars 
to help the States keep their elections 
free from fraud and foreign inter-
ference. 
But under the Constitution, as cur-
rently written, each State has a con-
stitutional authority to govern how 
their elections are run, and I think it is 
a good thing—subject to section 2 of 
the Voting Rights Act if someone com-
mits a foul. 
In my State, 29 million people are 
spread out across major cities and 
small towns alike. And what works 
well in our State may not make as 
much sense in a small, densely popu-
lated State like New Jersey, or large, 
sparsely populated State like Alaska. 
That is why it is important that the 
States be the laboratories of democ-
racy and try to be responsive to the 
needs of the people in their particular 
State, because we are not all the same. 
I believe the leaders in each State 
know best the unique circumstances of 
their constituents, and they are best 
suited 
to 
craft 
voting 
laws 
that 
prioritize both access and security. 
A Federal Government hijacking of 
our State- and local-run election laws 
will not improve voter confidence in 
our elections. In fact, it will stir the 
very fears that Democrats claim they 
are trying to alleviate. But this isn’t 
really new. It is just a repackaged and 
new effort to do the same thing, which 
is to nationalize our elections and run 
all of them out of Washington, DC, and 
to discourage commonsense measures, 
like voter ID, that help bolster public 
confidence in our elections and dimin-
ish the opportunity for people to cheat. 
Well, no matter how many times we 
see this rebranded and new version of 
this Federal takeover of elections, I 
will continue to fight any effort to 
take 
the 
constitutional 
authority 
given to my State to run our own elec-
tions. I certainly am not going to turn

it over to the National Democratic 
Party. 
The Senate will never green light po-
litically motivated attempts to take 
over America’s elections, and that is 
good thing. And we are not going to go 
down this road on this new, rehashed, 
modified, substitute effort to nation-
alize our Federal elections. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
CLIMATE LEGISLATION 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 
for more than 100 years, scientists have 
shown that burning fossil fuels creates 
carbon pollution that heats up and 
builds up in our atmosphere. It just 
doesn’t go away. It just keeps building 
up more and more and more. 
And for more than 100 years, we kept 
on burning fossil fuels anyway. In fact, 
we have given major—as a Congress— 
major, permanent tax benefits for the 
past 100 years to the fossil fuel indus-
try. Now we are experiencing the full 
force and the huge cost of that choice, 
and it is growing even faster than 
many predicted. 
This week, I published a report that 
outlined how extreme weather events 
are becoming more destructive, more 
dangerous, and more expensive, thanks 
to the climate crisis. 
Last year, the U.S. Senate set an 
awful record. We had 22 separate bil-
lion-dollar weather and climate disas-
ters in one year—the most ever. In 
total, these 22 disasters cost the Nation 
almost $100 billion in damages, and 262 
Americans lost their lives in severe 
storms and heat waves and wildfires. 
2020 may have set a record, but, un-
fortunately, it is a record that is going 
to be broken probably this year. Over 
the past 5 years, American taxpayers 
have spent an average of $126 billion a 
year in damages due to these disasters. 
And the total cost of these disasters 
over the last 15 years tops $1 trillion, 
and growing every single day, every 
single year. 
We are debating right now a budget— 
a Build Back Better Budget—and it in-
volves investing in a number of impor-
tant things over 10 years at about $350 
billion a year, and we are going to 
spend that very soon just on climate 
damage if we don’t get ahead of this. 
I know the Presiding Officer is lead-
ing on this in a very important way, 
which I thank you, for the issue around 
clean electricity policies. We have a lot 
of work to do. Nobody is going un-
touched. No State is untouched—from 
Montana to Mississippi, to Massachu-
setts, to Michigan. 
Last week, President Biden was in 
Idaho surveying the terrible damage 
caused by wildfires. He said: ‘‘We can’t 
continue to ignore reality.’’ 
He is right. The reality is carbon pol-
lution is the root cause of the climate 
crisis. Pollution goes into the atmos-
phere. It doesn’t leave. It just gathers 
there more and more and more and 
more, and we are seeing what is hap-
pening as a result of that. 
If we don’t combat the climate crisis 
now, the destruction and the deaths 
will continue to go up and up and up. If 
you think taking action is expensive, 
consider the cost of inaction. 
Who pays the bill? 
Well, we all do. We all pay the bill. 
Then there is the personal cost. I am 
thinking of a landowner who lives on 
the same wooded acres his grandfather 
owned—or at least he did until a 
drought-fueled wildfire destroyed his 
home and the forest that surrounded it. 
I am thinking of the small business 
that lost its roof and all of its inven-
tory when a hurricane and the result-
ing storm surge hit a small beachside 
community. 
I am thinking of all the Michigan 
growers I know who are one early 
freeze or dry season away from being 
unable to keep the family farm going, 
and I am thinking of those 262 families 
who lost someone they loved and will 
never be the same. 
We owe it to those families to take 
action so that the climate crisis 
doesn’t continue to cost people their 
lives and their livelihoods, and we owe 
it to American taxpayers to do all we 
can to avoid the worst impacts of this 
crisis. 
We know what we need to do. We 
know what we need to do. We need to 
cut carbon pollution. That is what we 
need to do. There are big interests on 
the other side—oil and gas and coal in-
terests. There is a lot of money—big 
special interests that keep trying to 
tell us this isn’t real. You know, what 
you are seeing right in front of your 
face, what you are experiencing in your 
life, isn’t real; it is pretend; it is not 
really happening. They put a lot of 
money into trying to stop what we are 
doing, but we have to take action. We 
have to take action. We know this is 
about carbon pollution; it is also about 
methane pollution and other green-
house gases. 
We can start doing something about 
it by passing the Build Back Better 
budget that the President has pro-
posed. The Build Back Better budget 
will make electric vehicles more af-
fordable and ensure that they are built 
right here in the United States. I want 
them built in Michigan, but at a min-
imum, we want them built in the 
United States. That is really important 
because we know that the transpor-
tation sector is the single largest 
source of carbon pollution that is driv-
ing climate change. Electric vehicles 
are a major part of the solution but not 
the only one, but they are a major part 
of it. 
The question is not whether they will 
be built; it is where they will be built— 
whether they are going to be built in 
China, where they are spending over 
$100 billion right now to capture the 
entire market, including electric bat-
teries as well as the vehicles, or wheth-
er we are going to make it in America. 
My goal is to make these vehicles in 
America. I have often said that Michi-
gan workers are the best in the world. 
I believe that. Under the Build Back 
Better budget, they will lead this 
world. American workers will lead the 
world if we are smart about doing what 
we need to do to invest in America. 
The Build Back Better budget also 
provides clean energy tax incentives, 
and it funds clean energy procurement 
so we can make the electricity we need 
to power the vehicles without carbon 
pollution. It helps ensure that the 
technologies we need to transition to 
clean energy are built right here in the 
United States by providing tax credits 
for manufacturers to retool and build 
new plants to produce advanced energy 
parts. 
It will hold polluters accountable and 
make sure they are held responsible for 
their actions. It will invest in impor-
tant clean electricity policies. It will 
invest in climate-smart agriculture so 
that farmers and ranchers and for-
esters can continue to be an even big-
ger part of the solution, and it will re-
store our forests and make them more 
resilient to wildfires. 
The Build Back Better budget, along-
side the bipartisan infrastructure pack-
age, which is also very important, will 
make our infrastructure more resilient 
and tackle the main driver of the cli-
mate crisis: carbon pollution. 
Best of all, these investments will 
also create millions of good-paying 
American jobs. That is the great part. 
As we are transitioning in Michigan, 
we are seeing jobs that are being cre-
ated as part of the clean energy econ-
omy. 
It is true that these policies rep-
resent significant investments, but it 
is also true that the cost of inaction is 
much, much higher. Inaction has con-
sequences—so 
many 
different 
con-
sequences—for us, for our children, for 
our grandchildren, and we can’t afford 
those consequences. We just can’t af-
ford those consequences anymore. 
So, on behalf of all of our children, 
on behalf of our grandchildren, now is 
the time to act. We must take this mo-
ment because we are running out of 
time. We must take this moment to act 
to address the pollution that is cre-
ating this climate crisis. We can do it— 
we know what to do—but now is the 
time to act and get it done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise 
today to call attention to the humani-
tarian crisis that is happening right 
now in the State of Texas, another one 
happening right now in Del Rio, TX— 
yet another consequence of President 
Biden’s and Vice President HARRIS’s 
dangerous refusal to enforce our laws 
or to protect our border, a refusal that 
is causing people to die; that is causing 
young girls to be trafficked; that is 
causing drugs to pour into our State; 
and that is causing our communities to 
become much less safe. 
Right now, thousands of Haitians are 
camped under a bridge in Del Rio, TX,

September 22, 2021 
after illegally entering our country. 
Six days ago, I went down to Del Rio 
myself to see firsthand what was going 
on and why this was happening. The 
sheer number of people under the 
bridge took my breath away. People 
were struggling enormously, including 
infants, including young children, and I 
learned from authorities on the ground 
what had happened and that this was a 
man-made crisis. To understand what 
occurred, we have to go back to Sep-
tember 8. 
On September 8 and in the weeks 
that preceded it, there were between 
700 and 1,000 people under that bridge 
in Del Rio. That was about the traffic 
that was coming in each day illegally. 
Then, on September 8, the Biden ad-
ministration made a political decision. 
There were some 900 Haitian illegal im-
migrants who were scheduled to board 
planes and be deported back to Haiti. 
Roughly, 85 percent of the illegal im-
migrants crossing at Del Rio are from 
Haiti originally. On September 8, the 
Biden administration canceled those 
planes. It informed those 900 Haitians 
that they would not be deported but 
that they would, instead, be allowed to 
stay in the United States, and what 
happened next is simple. 
Those 900 picked up their phones, and 
they called their friends; they called 
their families; they texted their friends 
and families. Between the period of 
September 8, when the Biden adminis-
tration canceled those flights back to 
Haiti and September 16—8 days later 
when I was in Del Rio—the 700 people 
under the bridge had become 10,503. 
That is what the total was the day I 
was there—10,503 packed in in deplor-
able conditions. They had already 
crossed into the United States. They 
were packed under that bridge because 
the Border Patrol lacked the capacity 
to process anything close to that num-
ber, and within a couple more days, the 
10,503 had become 15,000 people. 
To put that in perspective, the city 
of Del Rio has a population of 35,000 
people. Nearly half the population of 
Del Rio was under that bridge. We have 
seen bread and water and toilet paper 
and basic necessities flying off store 
shelves in Del Rio, which wasn’t ex-
pecting to have to handle such a mas-
sive influx of illegal immigrants. 
The people of Del Rio are concerned; 
they are dismayed; they don’t under-
stand why the Federal Government re-
fuses to enforce the law. Law enforce-
ment is concerned and dismayed and 
doesn’t understand why Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS won’t enforce the law. 
The mayor in Del Rio is a Democrat, 
and he is frustrated and dismayed with 
the crisis the Federal Government has 
caused. 
In the past month, I have traveled 
throughout 
South 
Texas, 
doing 
roundtables—sitting down with farm-
ers and ranchers, sitting down with 
sheriffs and local law enforcement, sit-
ting down with elected officials. A 
great many of the elected officials in 
South Texas are Democrats. South 
Texas, historically, has been a very 
Democratic region of the State. To a 
person, every elected Democrat with 
whom I sat down was horrified at what 
was happening. 
More than one elected Democrat in 
South Texas said to me: If the National 
Democratic Party is the party of open 
borders, I can’t be for that. 
You know, in this body, we listen to 
lots of elected officials from States 
that don’t have a border with Mexico 
pontificate on how enforcing the border 
is somehow cruel. I will tell you what 
is cruel: having 10,503 people under-
neath a bridge, in shantytown condi-
tions, where children, where women, 
where men are sleeping out in the ele-
ments and where even more come. 
One of the things that strikes me 
about that Del Rio influx is many of 
those individuals had already been 
granted asylum in Mexico. So they had 
come from Haiti to Mexico. They had 
been granted asylum—they were living 
legally in Mexico—but when the Biden 
administration canceled the flights 
back to Haiti and word got out of, 
‘‘Hey, come to Del Rio. It is olly olly 
oxen free. If you come to Del Rio, you 
can stay in America,’’ it took 8 days 
for 700 people to become 10,503. 
The Biden administration has also 
shut down five Border Patrol check-
points in the Del Rio sector area of re-
sponsibility so they can redirect per-
sonnel just to process the mass of ille-
gal immigrants under the bridge in Del 
Rio, and, of course, it is at those 
checkpoints that trucks carrying ille-
gal immigrants or trucks carrying 
drugs into our country are caught. 
So, with Joe Biden and KAMALA HAR-
RIS pulling the personnel away from 
that, we know yet more illegal immi-
grants will stream into this country. 
We know yet more women will be raped 
and sexually assaulted by human traf-
fickers. We know more children—more 
little boys and more little girls—will 
face physical assault and sexual as-
sault from human traffickers. We also 
know 
that 
more 
heroin, 
more 
fentanyl—more illegal drugs—will pour 
into our States. And, by the way, not 
just the State of Texas, but every 
State in the Union will have more peo-
ple die from illegal drugs because Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS refuse to en-
force the law and are pulling law en-
forcement off of their job of protecting 
our communities. 
On Monday, Department of Homeland 
Security 
Secretary 
Alejandro 
Mayorkas went down to Del Rio. Let 
me say I am glad he did. Joe Biden 
hasn’t been to Del Rio. KAMALA HARRIS 
hasn’t been to Del Rio. She is osten-
sibly the border control czar, but the 
czar can’t be bothered to actually go to 
the southern border where the crisis is 
occurring. 
Secretary Mayorkas, in Del Rio, said: 
‘‘We are very concerned that Haitians 
who are taking this irregular migra-
tion path are receiving false informa-
tion that the border is open.’’ 
Well, I wonder why they think the 
border is open. Maybe it is because the 
Biden administration halted the depor-
tation flights to Haiti. Maybe it is be-
cause Joe Biden is releasing Haitians 
who illegally cross the border at Del 
Rio into the United States at a stag-
gering scale. Maybe it is because Joe 
Biden halted construction of the border 
wall the day that he became President. 
Maybe it is because Joe Biden rein-
stated the failed catch-and-release pol-
icy or maybe it is because Joe Biden, 
on day 1 of the Presidency, ended the 
incredibly successful ‘‘Remain in Mex-
ico’’ policy, which was an international 
agreement that President Trump had 
negotiated with the Government of 
Mexico that provided that when people 
crossed illegally into Mexico, that they 
would remain in Mexico while their 
U.S. asylum case was proceeding. 
That agreement was phenomenally 
successful—so much so that last year, 
in 2020, we had the lowest rate of ille-
gal immigration in 45 years. 
I want to point out to you that some 
of the Democratic Party, some in the 
media like to say: Well, this problem 
has been with us a long time. This 
problem is not Joe Biden’s fault; it is 
not KAMALA HARRIS’ fault. We can’t 
solve the crisis at our southern border. 
If you hear elected Democrats saying 
that, if you hear the corrupt corporate 
media saying that, you know they are 
not telling you the truth. 
Why is that? Because last year, 12 
months ago, we had the lowest rate of 
illegal immigration in 45 years. We 
know how to solve this crisis. The ‘‘Re-
main in Mexico’’ international agree-
ment worked, and Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS, for political reasons, 
decided to tear up that international 
agreement and declare open season on 
our southern border. 
This year, since Joe Biden has been 
President, over 1.2 million illegal im-
migrants have come into the United 
States. We are on pace for more than 2 
million this year, which is the highest 
rate in 20 years. 
Do you want to see how much policy 
and politics matter? We went from the 
lowest rate in 45 years last year to the 
highest rate in 21 years this year. And 
it is all because of politics, because Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS had made 
promises to the open-border radicals in 
their party. 
I will tell you, I have been to the bor-
der. I have been to the Biden cages. For 
4 years, Democrats went on and on and 
on. The corrupt corporate media went 
on and on and on about kids in cages. 
You couldn’t turn on the evening news 
without hearing ‘‘kids in cages.’’ 
What they didn’t tell you is that 
Barack Obama built those cages, and, 
today, under Joe Biden, the cages are 
bigger and they are more full than they 
were before. 
Every Democrat who stood up and la-
mented ‘‘kids in cages’’ and the House 
of 
Representatives—Representative 
OCASIO-CORTEZ has a famous photo of 
her grasping her head by the kids in 
cages. Well, I am going to give a simple 
challenge for Representative OCASIO-

September 22, 2021 
CORTEZ and for every Democrat in this 
body: Go see the Biden cages with your 
own eyes. 
I have seen them—the Donna tent fa-
cility, with over 4,000 people, with lit-
tle boys and little girls on top of each 
other. Just a couple of weeks ago, when 
I was in the Rio Grande Valley, the 
rate of COVID positivity in the Biden 
cages was over 22 percent. 
And all the Democrats who talked 
about this, if they don’t go, if they 
don’t denounce the Biden cages, then 
they are telling you that they are hyp-
ocrites; that they didn’t believe it 
when they said it; that they didn’t care 
about it when they said it; that it was 
all politics. It wasn’t about their kids. 
Why does Joe Biden refuse to go to 
the Rio Grande Valley? Because if he 
goes, the TV cameras will come with 
him. 
Why does KAMALA HARRIS, who is 
supposed to be the border czar—she is 
supposed to be in charge of this—why 
won’t she go to the Rio Grande Valley? 
Because if she went, the TV cameras 
would come and would show the Biden 
cages. 
And the Democrats are counting on 
the corrupt corporate media to sud-
denly say: Nothing to see here. Fifteen 
thousand Haitians under a bridge in 
Del Rio? Nothing to see here. 
Does anyone want to know what Joe 
Biden’s favorite ice cream flavor is? 
That is the news. Never mind 1.2 mil-
lion illegal immigrants. Never mind 
when I took 19 Senators down to the 
border. We went out on the river and 
saw a man floating dead in the river 
who died trying to cross illegally. 
Never mind the South Texas farmers 
and ranchers, the moms who told me: I 
won’t let my teenage kids go out on 
our ranch without being armed with a 
loaded firearm because there are so 
many human traffickers and narcotics 
traffickers that it is dangerous for 
them to go out on their own ranch. 
Never mind the South Texas farmers 
and 
ranchers, 
who 
told 
me 
at 
roundtables how tired they are of going 
out and finding dead bodies. 
Do you want to understand what is 
happening? You say there is no crisis? 
Come to Brooks County. I invite every 
Democrat here to Brooks County. 
Brooks County in South Texas, it is 
just north of the border. Brooks Coun-
ty, over and over and over again, there 
are dead bodies of illegal immigrants. 
The traffickers who are bringing 
them in, they are not nice guys. They 
are not humanitarians. They don’t give 
a damn. That means, if one of the ille-
gal immigrants is a pregnant woman, 
is a young child, is elderly, is sick, 
they just abandon them. They leave 
them in the rough terrain in the sum-
mer heat, and, over and over again, the 
farmers and ranchers encounter dead 
bodies on their property, where the 
traffickers have abandoned them. 
I ask you: Is that humane? Is that 
compassionate, that Joe Biden and 
KAMALA
HARRIS
policy that encour-
ages, that puts people in harm’s way 
and results in people dying? 
When we were down at the border, we 
saw a young girl who had been gang 
raped by the human traffickers who 
had brought her to America. The rate 
of sexual assault is staggering, particu-
larly among the girls and young 
women, so much so that a significant 
percentage of young women, before 
they take the harrowing trip with the 
traffickers, will implant a birth con-
trol because they know the odds of 
their being sexually assaulted are so 
great. 
And I will tell you, as I was doing the 
roundtables, one of the things I saw 
also was the colored wrist bands. So 
the traffickers are global cartels that 
are criminals. They are vicious crimi-
nals. They charge anyone—a young 
man, a young woman, a little boy, a 
little girl—thousands of dollars, any-
where from 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, $8,000 to cross 
into the United States. 
By the way, do you know there is 100- 
percent operational control on the bor-
der—100 percent—on the southern side? 
Nobody crosses the border without the 
cartels’ permission. If you do, they will 
kill you. Every person who crosses the 
border does so after paying the cartels, 
because you will be killed otherwise. 
But often, when they come, they will 
cross, and they will end up at a stash 
house. I have been to those stash 
houses. I have been out on the mid-
night patrols with the Border Patrol. 
You go into those stash houses, and 
there are colored wrist bands that they 
put on the illegal immigrants, and the 
colors correspond to how many thou-
sands of dollars they paid and how 
many thousands of dollars more they 
owe. 
Often, when they get here, the car-
tels will say: Thank you for your x 
thousand dollars. We want y thousand 
more. 
Tragically, it is at those stash houses 
in the United States where many of the 
sexual assaults occur. And so these im-
migrants, many of whom are young 
children, teenage children, when they 
get here, the Biden administration de-
livers them to their final destination. 
Joe Biden and KAMALA
HARRIS
and 
their administration are the last mile 
of the human trafficking network. 
But for the 14-, 15-year-old boy who 
arrives in Atlanta, who arrives in New 
York, who arrives in Detroit, who ar-
rives in Nashville—many of those 14- 
and 15-year-old boys owe thousands of 
dollars to the cartels, which means 
they arrive in your city—you might 
think Georgia is not a border State. 
But when teenagers are arriving in At-
lanta owing thousands of dollars to the 
cartels, they work for the cartels, and 
the cartels know who their family is 
and where their family is, and they 
risk their mother or father being mur-
dered if they don’t work for the cartels 
to pay off the cartels. 
The young women have it even 
worse. There are teenage girls who 
make the decision: I want to come to 
America; I want to come to the prom-
ised land. 
We have been a beacon of hope to 
millions throughout our history. They 
don’t realize they are stepping into 
Hell on Earth when the traffickers 
take them and then take them to a 
cartel facility in whatever city they 
end up in, where many of those teenage 
girls, still owing thousands of dollars 
to the cartels, have to work to pay off 
that debt by forced prostitution. Young 
girls forced into a life of sex slavery be-
cause the alternative is murder at the 
hand of the cartels. This is happening. 
The fact that Joe Biden doesn’t want 
to talk about it, the fact that KAMALA 
HARRIS claims it is not happening, the 
fact that the corrupt corporate media 
ignores it, it doesn’t stop the fact that 
hundreds of thousands of people are 
suffering. 
Mr. President, you and I are on the 
Senate Judiciary Committee. We have 
had four hearings in the Democrat-con-
trolled Judiciary Committee on am-
nesty. In case the American people 
missed it, we get that the Democrats 
want amnesty for every illegal alien. 
That is not lost on anybody. 
We haven’t had a single hearing on 
the humanitarian crisis at the border. 
We haven’t had a single hearing on the 
Biden cages. 
Is it really the case that no Demo-
crat in this Chamber cares about the 
children being assaulted, cares about 
the children catching COVID, cares 
about the illegal immigrants being re-
leased by Joe Biden and KAMALA HAR-
RIS with COVID into our communities? 
I get, politically, that this is an in-
convenient topic to discuss. It is not 
the political narrative Democrats want 
to address. But every Democrat in this 
body needs to ask: Did you believe one 
word of the rhetoric you said during 
the Trump administration? Or was it 
all politics? 
And, by the way, I saw the kids in 
cages, and I went to them directly 
when Obama was President. I saw them 
when Trump was President. I saw them 
when Biden was President. The dif-
ference last year is that we had the 
lowest numbers in 45 years. We were 
fixing the problem last year by enforc-
ing the law. 
Joe Biden has created this crisis 
through political divisions. 
I make one final point: right now, 10 
to 15,000 Haitian illegal immigrants 
under a bridge in Del Rio, TX. It is 
easy for Democrats to say: Well, that is 
not my problem. 
It is easy for Democrats to say: I 
have never been to Del Rio. What do I 
care about those folks in South Texas. 
I ask you: How would this issue be 
different if those illegal immigrants—if 
their point of entry was Martha’s Vine-
yard? How would this issue be different 
if their point of entry was Silicon Val-
ley, perhaps right outside the head-
quarters of Google—15,000 illegal immi-
grants under bridges? 
The corrupt corporate media doesn’t 
care. The Democrats, I hope, will dem-
onstrate that they do. 
And I will tell you this: The Amer-
ican people care. What is happening at

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6620 
September 22, 2021 
Neil Oberheim, a 20-year veteran of the 
Illinois police force who was fatally 
shot on May 19, 2021, while serving in 
the line of duty. Officer Oberheim 
started his remarkable career at the 
Decatur 
Police 
Department 
before 
transferring to the Champaign Police 
Department in 2008. 
Throughout his years of protecting 
and serving, Officer Oberheim earned 
two medals of valor and countless let-
ters of commendation for his coura-
geous acts of selfless bravery. He will 
be remembered by his colleagues as a 
model officer and someone who looked 
forward to making memories with his 
fellow officers at the annual State soft-
ball tournament hosted by the Police 
Benevolent and Protective Association 
of Illinois. 
Officer Oberheim was not only a dedi-
cated law enforcement officer, but also 
a devoted father and citizen who was 
loved and respected in his community. 
Officer Oberheim invested a great deal 
of time off duty to coaching several 
successful girls’ softball teams, and the 
Monticello Sages Softball team paid 
tribute to his legacy as a coach and 
mentor: ‘‘Chris Oberheim was the ulti-
mate girl dad and was so proud of his 
girls. He has given so much to the pro-
gram and we are blessed to have known 
him.’’ 
Officer 
Oberheim 
was 
tragically 
killed in the line of duty while ful-
filling his oath to serve and protect the 
people of the city of Champaign, and I 
am grateful for his years of service. He 
leaves behind his wife Amber and their 
4 daughters Hannah, Avery, Addison, 
and Aubree. May his service, sacrifice, 
and kind spirit serve as an inspiration 
to us all.

80TH ANNIVERSARY OF VANCE AIR 
FORCE BASE 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on Fri-
day, September 17, 2021, Vance Air 
Force Base celebrated its 80th anniver-
sary. On this day, we honored the com-
munity, leadership, cadre of instruc-
tors, and over 35,000 pilots Vance has 
trained since 1941. Vance AFB is the 
top pilot-producing base for 2 years 
running and enables our Nation to pro-
vide and defend global power projec-
tion. 
Vance Air Force Base’s history dates 
back to 1941, originally founded as Air 
Corps Basic Flying School in Enid, OK. 
After World War II, the base reopened 
as a permanent facility on August 26, 
1948, and became Vance AFB on July 9, 
1949. The base is named in honor of Lt 
Col Leon Robert Vance, Jr., a native of 
Enid, who posthumously received the 
Medal of Honor for gallantry in action 
over France on June 5, 1944. 
For 80 years, Vance has served as the 
model for empowering the future of the 
U.S. Air Force through innovation and 
focuses on supporting flight operations 
everyday. The 71st Flying Training 
Wing operates over 200 aircraft, con-
ducting more than 50,000 sorties annu-
ally, and logging more than 74,000 
flight hours in the T–1A Jayhawk, T– 
6A Texan II, and T–38C Talon. Soon, 
Vance will add the T–7 Red Hawk to its 
training aircraft fleet. The base grad-
uates 370 exceptional U.S. Air Force 
and allied student pilots from pilot 
training each year. 
Vance is lucky because it benefits 
from outstanding community support 
and partnerships. The base supports 
more than 1,400 civilian employees and 
1,400 military members and their fami-
lies in the local area. Vance has a re-
markable $381.2 million impact on the 
local community. On September 17, 
thousands of friends and families who 
make the Vance mission a success 
gathered to celebrate the history and 
future of the base. 
Vance strives to accomplish its mis-
sion every day to deliver the world’s 
best pilots, develop resilient airmen 
and families, deploy combat ready war-
riors, and demonstrate Vance culture. I 
am proud that Vance will continue to 
train the finest airmen for the finest 
Air Force in the world. On behalf of my 
colleagues and the entire U.S. Senate, I 
want to congratulate the Vance AFB 
community on 80 years of excellence in 
service to our Nation. ‘‘Vance Proud!’’ 
f 
150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
GREAT PESHTIGO FIRE 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize a grave day in Wis-
consin’s history, the 150th anniversary 
of the ‘‘Great Peshtigo Fire.’’ On this 
sesquicentennial anniversary, we re-
member the great city of Peshtigo, WI, 
that was completely destroyed on Oc-
tober 8, 1871, in the largest fire in U.S. 
history. 
A community surrounded by dense 
forest, the city of Peshtigo was first 
settled in 1838. Located off the western 
shore of Green Bay in Marinette Coun-
ty, the area was first inhabited by Me-
nominee and Ho-Chunk Native Ameri-
cans. Sustained by lumber, shipping, 
and railroad interests, by the end of 
1871, it was the tenth largest city in 
Wisconsin. 
Historians and survivors of the fire 
theorize that the blaze was started by 
railroad workers who were cutting 
trees and burning debris outside of 
Peshtigo. A combination of a prolonged 
drought, a heavy reliance on wooden 
buildings, and 100-mph winds aligned to 
create a firestorm that reached 3 miles 
across and 1,000 feet high. Over the 
course of the night, the fire scorched 
over 1.2 million acres and caused an es-
timated $169 million in damages. Be-
tween 1,200 and 2,500 people lost their 
lives. The fire’s complete destruction 
of local records prevented an accurate 
death toll. An estimated 350 victims lie 
in a mass grave in Peshtigo, victims 
who could not be identified because 
they were either burned beyond rec-
ognition or because those who could 
identify them perished, too. 
Although the Great Peshtigo Fire 
has been well documented, little has 
been written about the crucial role Na-
tive Americans played in preventing 
further loss of life among European 
settlers. One of the most compelling 
stories involves Abraham Place, who 
traveled on foot to Wisconsin from 
Vermont in 1837 to build a homestead 
in the Sugar Bush neighborhood just 
outside of Peshtigo. He married a Me-
nominee woman, and together with 
their children, they tended one of the 
largest 
farms 
in 
the 
area. 
While 
marrying a Native-American woman 
was socially acceptable when Place 
first 
settled 
there, 
attitudes 
had 
changed by 1871, and he was scorned by 
his fellow settlers. 
The Native Americans he regularly 
welcomed to his home warned him of 
the impending danger of fire after 
months of little to no rain and helped 
him create a 3-foot-deep firebreak 
around his farm. His European neigh-
bors dismissed his precaution as the ac-
tions of a crazy man who had married 
a Native American. Mrs. Place’s in- 
laws then spent hours placing dozens of 
wet blankets on the roof of their house 
to prevent its destruction. Their home 
was one of the few buildings still stand-
ing on the morning of October 9. 
Many of the same neighbors who had 
ridiculed them ran to their house or 
died trying. Survivors found the bodies 
of 35 residents who never made it to 
the farm. The hundred or so refugees 
who arrived safely at the Place home 
found a make-shift hospital where they 
could nurse their wounds and recu-
perate. Some stayed for weeks, their 
earlier disdain cured by necessity. 
In the days following the Peshtigo 
fire, 
survivors 
emerged 
from 
the 
Peshtigo River and other safe havens 
untouched by the flames to look for 
missing loved ones and to begin to re-
build their lives. As word of the devas-
tation spread, donations of food, cloth-
ing, and money poured in from across 
the State, the Nation, and several for-
eign countries. This selfless, unified 
show of support empowered the people 
of Peshtigo to rebuild their homes and 
restore their community. 
Occurring on the same night as the 
Great Chicago Fire, the Peshtigo fire 
has 
been 
largely 
forgotten, 
even 
though the Wisconsin death toll is esti-
mated to be seven times that of the 
Chicago tragedy. That is why I join 
Peshtigo residents in remembering the 
time 
when 
prejudices 
that 
turned 
neighbors into enemies were set aside 
in the midst of unimaginable hardship. 
And I applaud their efforts to pause 
this October 8 to remember this incon-
ceivable catastrophe, commemorate its 
victims and honor the resilience of 
those who worked so hard to rebuild 
this city from the ashes of total devas-
tation into the tranquil community of 
today.

TRIBUTE TO DOROTHY SHIRLEY

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6621 
September 22, 2021 
Licht, as she celebrates her 100th birth-
day on Monday, September 27, 2021. 
Dorothy Shirley Krauss was born in 
Providence, RI, in 1921. She spent much 
of her life dedicated to others—raising 
three children, working to enrich her 
community, and supporting her late 
husband, the former Governor of Rhode 
Island Frank Licht, in his political and 
judicial endeavors. 
In 1949, she married Frank Licht, a 
Rhode Islander who graduated from 
Brown University and Harvard Law 
School and served as a State senator in 
Rhode Island from 1949 until being 
sworn in as an associate justice of the 
Rhode Island Superior Court in 1956. 
After 12 steadfast years on the bench, 
Licht thrust himself into an uphill gu-
bernatorial fight against the incum-
bent Governor and my former col-
league, the late Senator John Chafee. 
Following a hard-fought campaign, 
Licht secured an underdog win in 1968, 
and with Dorothy at his side, he be-
came the first Jewish Governor in 
Rhode Island’s history. During Gov-
ernor Licht’s time in office, he focused 
on 
advancing 
mental 
healthcare, 
strong environmental protections, and 
bold economic reforms. With strong 
conviction and courage, he pushed 
through an unpopular tax plan that 
would help guide Rhode Island out of a 
devastating financial crisis. 
No public servant can be successful 
without the strong support of their 
loved ones. Through tough races, long 
hours, and challenging times, Dorothy 
gifted to the people of Rhode Island a 
model for strong and eloquent leader-
ship. During her time as First Lady 
and in the decades since, Dorothy held 
the advancement of the arts and hu-
manities close to her heart. Her work 
to elevate art and culture across our 
community is exemplified by her past 
service on the boards of the Rhode Is-
land State Council on the Arts, the 
New England Foundation for the Arts, 
and 
the 
Rhode 
Island 
Symphony. 
Dorothy’s compassion for helping those 
in need is perhaps best shown through 
her role as an honorary board member 
of the Rhode Island Food Bank, a role 
she still holds today. 
Through all of the highs of Dorothy’s 
life, she has not been immune to loss. 
She has endured the immeasurable bur-
den of burying both her loving husband 
Frank many years ago, as well as her 
eldest daughter Beth, who passed unex-
pectedly earlier this year. Still, Doro-
thy is strengthened and supported by 
her beloved family who join with me to 
celebrate this milestone, including her 
two surviving daughters Carol and 
Judy, her eight grandchildren, and her 
four great-grandchildren, as well as her 
nephew, former Lieutenant Governor 
Richard Licht. 
It is my distinct honor to recognize 
Dorothy for her life of service to Rhode 
Island, her commitment to her family, 
and this momentous occasion of her 
100th birthday. 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL 
JERRY HUMBLE 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, on October 
16, 2021, the Colonel Benjamin Logan 
Chapter of the Sons of the American 
Revolution will present a special award 
to a great modern-day patriot with 
roots in Russellville, KY. 
Retired U.S. Marine Corps Maj. Gen. 
Jerry Humble was born in Russell 
County, KY, but being the son and 
grandson of Methodist ministers, he 
and his family moved several times, 
eventually settling in Russellville, KY, 
where he attended high school and let-
tered in four sports. He accepted a foot-
ball scholarship to Western Kentucky 
University, in my hometown of Bowl-
ing Green, where he was defensive MVP 
his senior year. 
Logan County native, Margaret Jane 
Hollingsworth, his high school sweet-
heart—and fellow WKU graduate—be-
came Jerry’s wife in 1968 and began an 
amazing partnership with him in serv-
ice to their country. 
In the midst of the Vietnam war, 
Jerry enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps 
and was commissioned as a second lieu-
tenant. Beyond Vietnam, his 34-year 
career 
included 
service 
in 
Desert 
Storm and other operations, including 
commanding Marine Forces in Korea. 
He was recognized with the Defense 
Distinguished Service Medal, Navy Dis-
tinguished Service Medal, Legion of 
Merit with two Gold Stars and Combat 
V, Meritorious Service Medal with one 
Gold Star, Joint Service Commenda-
tion Medal with oak leaf cluster, Navy 
and 
Marine 
Corps 
Commendation 
Medal

in a number of books and publications, 
he has appeared on a host of national 
media broadcasts, and he has testified

ing serving as the cabinet secretary for 
homeland security for the State of 
Tennessee.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. SCHUMER (for Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN): 
S. 2805. A bill to revise laws regard-
ing liability in certain civil actions, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I 
rise today to introduce the ‘‘Small Pas-
senger Vessel Liability Fairness Act of 
2021.’’ 
This bill would help the families of 34 
people who were tragically killed in 
the Conception boat fire off the coast of 
Santa Cruz Island, California on Sep-
tember 2, 2019, and other victims and 
their families of similar tragedies. This 
was the worst maritime disaster in 
modern California history, and my 
thoughts continue to be with the vic-
tims and their loved ones. 
In December of last year, my bill, the 
Small Passenger Vessel Safety Act, 
passed as part of the annual National 
Defense Authorization Act. It goes a 
long way toward improving passenger 
vessel safety, but the families of the 
victims are still unable to seek com-
pensation for the great loss of life they 
have suffered. 
The victims of the Conception boat 
fire were killed when a fire started on-
board the boat, while passengers and 
crewmembers were sleeping below deck 
after a nighttime swim. 
The National Transportation Safety 
Board’s final investigation report for 
the fire indicates that the victims were 
awake and trying to escape before they 
were overcome with smoke. Both exits 
from the bunkroom were blocked by 
flames, and coroner reports list smoke 
inhalation as the cause of death for all 
passengers. 
The same NTSB investigation also 
determined that the owner and oper-
ator of the boat was at fault for failing 
to provide effective safety oversight. 
There was no roving watchman as re-
quired, the emergency procedures were 
not properly followed, and the Coast 
Guard failed to enforce safety require-
ments. 
The families of the victims of the 
Conception boat fire have filed claims 
against the owners of the boat for vio-
lating federal safety rules. However, 
due to an outdated maritime liability 
law, The Limitation of Liability Act of 
1851, the owner of the vessel may not 
be financially liable for any of the 
losses incurred as a result of the fire, 
including the enormous loss of life. My 
bill would address this issue. 
How the bill would help: 
My bill would amend the outdated 
law to allow families of victims to 
bring claims against owners of small 
passenger vessels found to be liable for 
maritime accidents such as the Concep-
tion boat fire, and receive proper com-
pensation for their suffering. It would 
require small passenger vessels to be 
governed by liability laws that allow 
for victims to receive compensation. 
I am very appreciative of the NTSB 
and Board Member Jennifer Homendy 
and the Coast Guard’s responsiveness 
to 
several 
safety 
recommendations 
issued by the NTSB, and for their feed-
back on this bill. I am especially appre-
ciative to the families of the Concep-
tion boat fire victims for bringing this 
issue to my attention, and for their 
tireless efforts to improve maritime 
safety and ensure just compensation 
for future victims. 
This bill would provide a long over-
due update to an outdated law. It is 
critical that Congress pass it in a time-
ly manner, so as to ensure families of 
the 34 victims may have their day in 
court and that future victims of simi-
lar tragedies can also seek justice. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor.

himself, 
Mr. 
TOOMEY, 
Mr. 
TILLIS, 
Mr. 
JOHNSON,

BRAUN, Mr. HAGERTY, Mr. CRUZ, 
Mr. CRAMER, Mrs. CAPITO, Mr.

Mr.

S. 2809. A bill to protect social secu-
rity benefits and military pay and re-
quire that the United States Govern-
ment to prioritize all obligations on 
the debt held by the public in the event 
that the debt limit is reached; placed 
on the calendar. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
currently, America’s debt is barreling 
toward $30 trillion. This $30 trillion is 
hard to imagine. So think about it this 
way: That is more than $233,000 of debt 
for every American family. 
On July 31, the suspension on the 
Federal debt limit expired, and now the 
Democrats in Congress, who continue 
to pursue a purely partisan, reckless 
tax-and-spending spree, are pushing 
this as a decision point with only two 
options: to vote to suspend the debt 
limit or increase it with no reforms to 
control excess Federal spending. They 
want us to write the government a 
blank check to spend more money that 
we don’t have. The Republicans have 
been clear: We will not do it. 
Now, my Democratic colleagues will 
say that the debt ceiling shouldn’t be a 
partisan issue, and I completely agree,

September 22, 2021 
but what we have seen from the Demo-
crats this year has been purely par-
tisan even by Washington’s broken 
standards. 
First, they passed a nearly $2 trillion 
so-called COVID bill that spent less 
than 10 percent of its funding on actu-
ally fighting COVID, without any Re-
publican votes, and now they are push-
ing forward a $5.5 trillion reckless tax- 
and-spending spree—again, without a 
single Republican vote. This insane 
Democratic spending means we are on 
the dangerous path of reaching $45 tril-
lion in Federal debt by 2031. That is not 
my number. That is what the Demo-
crats’ own bill says. The Democrats’ 
own projections have their reckless 
spending taking the U.S. debt to $45 
trillion in the next 10 years. 
There are major consequences to this 
financial irresponsibility. Like any 
borrower, 
the 
Federal 
Government 
pays interest on its debt. When you 
rack up nearly $30 trillion in debt, that 
means hundreds of billions of dollars in 
interest. Who pays for it? The tax-
payers. Right now, even with interest 
rates at historic lows, the U.S. Govern-
ment is already spending nearly $345 
billion yearly on interest. Instead of 
funding important infrastructure, de-
fense, or the environment, nearly $345 
billion in hard-earned tax dollars is 
just paying interest which provides 
zero return for American families. Just 
imagine how much that will grow when 
the U.S. reaches $45 trillion in debt. 
And when interest rates return to nor-
mal levels, things will get even worse. 
Let’s look at this. 
Right now, about 11 percent of what 
we are going to collect this year will go 
to pay the interest. There is no return 
for taxpayers on this interest. Let’s 
look at what is going to happen by 2031, 
and this is the Democrats’ budget: 23 
percent of total Federal receipts will 
go toward paying the interest. Now, 
that is assuming that interest rates 
stay low. Why would we believe that 
interest rates are going to stay low? 
Let’s just look. We are having unbe-
lievable inflation right now. When in-
flation goes up, interest rates typically 
follow. Assuming we have low interest 
rates stay low, like the Democrats do, 
we could be spending over $1 trillion on 
just interest by 2031. Imagine, if inter-
est rates return to historical averages, 
our payments will be astronomical. 
The Federal Government brings in less 
than $4 trillion in revenues. So we will 
be spending roughly a quarter of all tax 
revenue on interest that does nothing— 
nothing—for taxpayers. 
How can Congress justify that? 
It is clear: Democratic spending has 
caused this massive Democratic debt, 
and it is time for liberals in Wash-
ington to own the debt crisis they have 
created. 
Republicans have been clear: We 
won’t stand for it. We won’t vote to 
bail out the Democrats’ out-of-control 
spending. We won’t cut radical liberals 
in Congress more blank checks to bury 
our country in more debt, to drive up 
America’s interest expense, and to fuel 
an already raging inflation crisis, hurt-
ing families across my State and across 
this country. 
Just last week, the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reported that the Consumer 
Price Index was up 5.3 percent in 1 
year—from August to August, 5.3 per-
cent. Year-over-year comparisons show 
that inflation has gone up each month 
of 
Biden’s 
Presidency. 
Government 
doesn’t feel the Biden inflation, but ev-
eryday Americans do. 
I am hearing from families all across 
my State—a father of three in Jack-
sonville, 
a 
mother 
of 
four 
in 
Wauchula—and 
small 
businesses 
in 
Miami. Another family in Kissimmee 
told us about how hard it is to keep 
food on the table because everything is 
getting so expensive. They are having 
trouble keeping their car because of 
the cost of maintenance and gas. Of 
course, without a car, they won’t have 
a way to get to work and provide for 
their family. 
It is heartbreaking to hear these sto-
ries. I can relate to this. I grew up in a 
poor family. My mom would take in 
ironing for extra money. She would 
give us exact change to go to the gro-
cery store, and if the price of some-
thing went up, we just simply couldn’t 
get it. 
In the face of this hardship felt by so 
many families in Florida and across 
this great Nation, President Biden and 
Democrats here in Congress have zero 
interest in reducing the national debt 
and cutting their insane spending. 
Democrats have shown a heartless dis-
regard for the struggles so many fami-
lies in Florida and across America are 
dealing with right now. 
It is time we bring accountability to 
Federal spending. Unlike our Demo-
cratic colleagues, Republicans have a 
solution-focused approach to fixing 
America’s debt crisis. We know that 
the Federal Government can and must 
pursue practical measures to make it 
easy and relatively painless to cut 
spending. We can start that right now. 
Earlier this year, I introduced the 
Federal Debt Emergency Control Act, 
which prevents Washington from mind-
lessly spending by requiring that two- 
thirds of the Senate vote to increase 
the debt before approving any bill with 
deficit spending, terminating any un-
obligated funding from the stimulus 
bills and sending it back to the Treas-
ury General Fund for deficit reduction, 
and fast-tracking any bill reducing the 
debt by at least 5 percent over 10 years. 
Today, I am joining my friend Sen-
ator PAT TOOMEY to reintroduce the 
Full Faith and Credit Act. This bill en-
sures that the U.S. Government does 
not default on its debt while also 
prioritizing certain payments to our 
seniors, military, and veterans. 
It is commonsense policy like this 
that will move the United States for-
ward and out of the massive debt crisis 
we are clearly already in. I welcome all 
fiscally responsible colleagues to join 
me to say: We don’t accept the status 
quo. We won’t watch in silence as 
Democrats try to spend us into obliv-
ion. We can get spending under control. 
While I was Governor of Florida, we 
paid down one-third of State debt by 
living within our means, all while cut-
ting taxes. We can do it here. We have 
to start acting responsibly, and the 
time to do that is now. 
Politicians in Washington want you 
to think this is so complicated. They 
want you to think that dysfunction is 
inevitable. That is a lie. It is a lie that 
a broken system and failed politicians 
up here have been telling you for dec-
ades, and it is time for that to end. 
Getting America back on track is 
simple. It starts with passing common-
sense reforms that rein in reckless 
spending, stop Congress from getting 
paid when it shuts down the govern-
ment, and force Congress to stay in 
session until it passes a balanced budg-
et. We keep our Nation on the right fi-
nancial path by making sure Congress 
is constantly held accountable for its 
spending of taxpayer money. It is tax-
payer money, every dollar of it. 
It is time to stand up for those on 
fixed incomes and, of course, families 
whose income can’t keep up with infla-
tion. It is time to stand up for our 
grandkids, whose futures are being 
mortgaged 
by 
out-of-control 
Wash-
ington spending. 
This isn’t political. It is good govern-
ment, and it is common sense. The 
longer we ignore the debt problem, the 
worse it will become not just for us but 
for future generations. 
A debt crisis is here today. It will be 
American families who feel the effects 
of their government’s lack of fiscal re-
sponsibility through inflation, higher 
costs, and rising taxes. That is not the 
America anyone wants. American fami-
lies deserve better. Through smart leg-
islation and responsible choices, we can 
be truly accountable to the American 
people and bring some stability back to 
the Federal Government’s bank ac-
count.

he stockpiled more than 8 tons of ammonium 
nitrate in Cyprus; 
Whereas, in December 2015, the Hizballah 
International Financing Prevention Act of 
2015 (Public Law 114–102) was signed into law 
in the United States, broadening financial 
sector sanctions against Hizballah to compel 
foreign financial institutions to refrain from 
supporting the terrorist group; 
Whereas, in May 2018, the Department of 
the Treasury imposed sanctions on Moham-
mad Ibrahim Bazzi, a Hizballah financier, 
and blacklisted 5 of his companies, including 
Belgian energy services conglomerate Global 
Trading Group; 
Whereas, in October 2018, French police 
raided the Islamic Zahra Centre on suspicion 
of supporting Hizballah, freezing the organi-

Whereas, in September 2020, 4 former lead-
ers of the Zahra Centre were arrested on sus-
picion of continuing to run the association; 
Whereas, in July 2019, the Department of 
the Treasury listed 2 Hizballah-backed mem-
bers of Lebanese Parliament, Amin Sherri 
and Mohammad Raad, to the terror black-
list, stating that Hizballah uses its par-
liamentary power to advance its violent ac-
tivities; 
Whereas, in April 2020, Germany inves-
tigated over 1,050 people with suspected links 
to Hizballah; 
Whereas Europol’s June 2020 European 
Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 
outlined that Hizballah is ‘‘suspected of traf-
ficking diamonds and drugs and of money 
laundering via the trade in second-hand 
cars’’, and the report also stated that ‘‘inves-
tigations 
face 
the 
difficulty 
of 
dem-
onstrating that the funds collected are chan-
neled to the military wing of the organiza-
tion’’; 
Whereas United States-led Operations Cas-

Whereas, 
during 
Operation 
Cassandra, 
Hizballah elements involved in drug traf-
ficking were arrested in the United States, 
South America, and several European coun-
tries, including France, Belgium, Germany, 
and Italy; 
Whereas Hizballah’s criminal activity in 
Europe is run by the BAC, which reports to 
the External Security Organisation, a.k.a. 
Unit 910, or the Islamic Jihad Organization 
(IJO), and Abdallah Safieddine, Hizballah’s 
representative in Iran, is also involved in 
this activity;

Secretary General Guterres called on Leb-
anon to disarm Hizballah, citing the terror 
group’s persistent violation of Resolution 
1701 (2006); 
Whereas Iran is the prime sponsor of 
Hizballah, harboring, financing, training, 
and arming the group; 
Whereas the Department of the Treasury 
and Department of State estimate that Iran 
provides as much as $700,000,000 per year to 
Hizballah in the form of financial and 
logistical support, weapons, and training; 
Whereas Hizballah now has an arsenal of 
approximately 150,000 missiles and rockets, 
many of which can reach deep into Israel; 
Whereas Hizballah fighters have been sup-
porting the Assad regime in Syria, often 
leading operations in the conflict which has 
left more than 500,000 dead; 
Whereas Hizballah’s destabilizing actions 
in Syria has fueled a migrant crisis that has 
brought over 700,000 refugees to Europe; 
Whereas Hizballah trains and provides 
weapons for Shiite militias in Iraq and 
Yemen, further destabilizing the region and 
perpetuating violence in those countries; 
Whereas Hizballah activities continue to 
plague Lebanon with profound economic and 
political instability and violence; 
Whereas, in August 2020, 200 Lebanese peo-
ple died when a massive stockpile of ammo-

Whereas the Lebanese Armed Forces, the 
legitimate security establishment of the 
country as outlined in United Nations Secu-
rity Council Resolution 1701 (2006), are strug-
gling to control the flow of weapons and 
Hizballah fighters at Lebanon’s borders; 
Whereas, in October 2012, Hizballah Deputy 
Secretary General Naim Qassem stated that 
‘‘[Hizballah does not] have a military wing 
and a political one . . . Every element of 
Hizballah, from commanders to members as 
well as our various capabilities, are in the 
service of the resistance’’; 
Whereas, as of September 2021, the United 
States, Germany, the United Kingdom, the 
Netherlands, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Slovenia, Serbia, and Kosovo have des-
ignated Hizballah in its entirety as a terror 
organization; 
Whereas, in March 2016, the Gulf Coopera-
tion Council, the bloc of 6 Gulf Arab nations, 
formally branded Hizballah, in its entirety, a 
terrorist organization, and the League of 
Arab States shortly thereafter adopted the 
same designation; 
Whereas the Department of the Treasury 
has diligently added persons and entities to 
the list of Specially Designated Global Ter-
rorists who have provided material support 
to the Hizballah terrorist organization, 
thereby 
hampering 
its 
financing 
and 
logistical capabilities;

Whereas, 
despite 
restrictions 
put 
on 
Hizballah since the designation of its mili-
tary wing, the group continues to conduct il-
licit narcotrafficking, money laundering,

Whereas 1 in 8 men in the United States 
will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 
their lifetimes and 1 in 41 men in the United 
States will die from prostate cancer; 
Whereas prostate cancer is the most com-
monly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the 
second-leading 
cause 
of 
cancer-related 
deaths among men in the United States; 
Whereas the American Cancer Society esti-
mates that, in 2021, 248,530 men will be diag-
nosed with, and more than 34,130 men will 
die of, prostate cancer; 
Whereas 40 percent of newly diagnosed 
prostate cancer cases occur in men under the 
age of 65; 
Whereas the odds of developing prostate 
cancer rise rapidly after age 50; 
Whereas 
African-American 
men 
suffer 
from a prostate cancer incidence rate that is 
significantly higher than that of White men 
and have more than double the prostate can-
cer mortality rate than that of White men; 
Whereas having a father or brother with 
prostate cancer more than doubles the risk 
of a man developing prostate cancer, with a 
higher risk for men who have a brother with 
the disease and the highest risk for men with 
several affected relatives; 
Whereas screening by a digital rectal ex-
amination and a prostate-specific antigen 
blood test can detect the disease at the ear-
lier, more treatable stages, which could in-
crease the chances of survival for more than 
5 years to nearly 100 percent; 
Whereas only 30 percent of men survive

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise to sup-
port this bipartisan National Defense Author-
ization Act: which honors our values, supports 
our servicemembers and families, strengthens 
our security and advances our leadership in 
the world. 
Thank you to Chairman SMITH, the Com-
mittee and staff for their patriotic, persistent 
leadership on this legislation, which reflects 
the brilliance and diversity of the whole House. 
This bill honors our responsibility to meet 
the needs of the servicemembers who sac-
rifice for our freedoms, and their families. It 
does so by: 
Providing a pay raise for our men and 
women in uniform, 
Strengthening parental leave for caregivers, 
Expanding access to child care, 
Improving the financial security of military 
members, including those who are low-income 
and have family members living with disabil-
ities, 
Protecting military communities from PFAS 
‘‘forever chemicals.’’ 
This NDAA also makes historic changes to 
better combat sexual assault in the military, in-
cluding creating an Office of Special Victim 
Prosecutor within each service to prosecute 
crimes and criminalizing sexual harassment 
under the UCMJ (Uniform Code of Military 
Justice). 
And it improves military health care, includ-
ing related to mental health, women’s repro-
ductive health and suicide prevention. 
In terms of protecting our security, there are 
many provisions of which to be proud in this 
NDAA. This legislation helps America combat 
our adversaries and invest in our alliances— 
with strong action to deter China and Russia, 
fight transnational threats and counter violent 
extremism. 
And it brings our defense further into the 
21st Century—with an historic 36 percent in-
crease in defense-wide research & develop-
ment, $2.5 billion to fix aging infrastructure & 
support security-related R&D, $1 billion in new 
cybersecurity investments, over $1 billion for 
artificial intelligence efforts and investments in 
new partnerships with the private sector and 
academia, including HBCUs and Minority- 
Serving Institutions. 
This NDAA builds on Congress’s bipartisan 
action in passing Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) 
legislation to provide for the relocation of our 
Afghan allies and partners, as it authorizes 
$500 million for this effort. 
This bipartisan policy bill has been signed 
into law for 60 consecutive years. We all look 
forward to seeing the Congress continue this 
proud tradition, as we pass this NDAA on a bi-
partisan basis and send it to the President’s 
desk for his signature. 
Doing so allows us to honor the vision of 
our Founders, as set out in the Preamble, to 
‘‘provide for the common defense,’’ and ‘‘se-
cure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and 
our Posterity.’’

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise

Special Recognition City Award. 
The Special Recognition City Award is given 
to a person, group or organization in Wheat 
Ridge who exemplifies outstanding service, 
leadership, and participation in the community. 
The All-American City designation is given to 
cities that have exemplified extraordinary 
qualities as a municipality and provides a 
great quality of life for its residents. The City 
of Wheat Ridge is most certainly deserving of 
this designation, thanks to the help of the All- 
American City Team. Its members include Val 
Nessler Beck, Kate Cooke, Terry Gale, Rachel 
Hultin, Eugene Kahng, Diana Lopez, Kathleen 
Martell, Joy Opp, Morgan Richards, Jenny 
Snell, Jesse Johnson, Adam Wylie, Coco 
Beck, Thalia Beck, Dave Nosler, and Matt 
Emerson. These men and women display pas-
sion and commitment to their community, and 
I appreciate their hard work to ensure the City 
of Wheat Ridge gets the recognition it de-
serves. 
Congratulations to City of Wheat Ridge’s 
All-American City Team for their contribution 
to the Wheat Ridge community and for receiv-
ing this award.

HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize a tireless advocate for the Hispanic/ 
Latino community—Joe Gonzalez. Joe immi-
grated to Iowa in 1957 when he was 5, along 
with his mother and two younger brothers. 
Like many Iowa immigrant stories of the time, 
his family followed his father who came to 
work on the railroad. Joe is a retired member 
of the Des Moines Police Department where

he worked for 42-years and he remains a vital 
liaison in the department’s outreach to the His-
panic/Latino community. Gonzalez was a long-
time volunteer for Iowa’s Latino Heritage Fes-
tival. He took over the reins of the festival as 
the executive director of Latino Resources Inc. 
in 2015, and has shaped the festival to what 
it is today. 
In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson pro-
claimed a week in September as National His-
panic Heritage Week. The observance was 
expanded in 1988 to a month-long celebration 
(Sept. 15 to Oct. 15). During this month, 
America celebrates the culture and traditions 
of U.S. residents who trace their roots to 
Spain, Mexico and the Spanish-speaking na-
tions of Central America, South America, and 
the Caribbean. September 15 was chosen as 
the starting point for the celebration because 
it is the anniversary of the independence of 
five Latin American countries: Costa Rica, El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nica-
ragua. In addition, Mexico and Chile celebrate 
their independence days on Sept. 16 and 
Sept. 18, respectively. There are 22 countries 
from Latin origin represented in Iowa. 
The Latino/Hispanic community brings so 
much value to our state, and Joe’s work with 
the Latino Heritage Festival is a great way to 
highlight that value. The festival provides the 
public with a family-oriented event filled with 
learning through music, dance, food, children’s 
activities, arts, and cultural exhibits from var-
ious Central and South American countries. It 
also emphasizes the uniqueness of the culture 
by demonstrating the diversity within the 
Latino community. Lastly, it creates a venue to 
showcase Iowa-based performers, artisans, 
cultural craftsmen, and artifact producers. 
Through distinct activities and exhibits, this 
event educates the youth and gives them a 
better understanding of the Latino culture, 
while teaching them tolerance and apprecia-
tion of diversity. Part of the mission for Iowa’s 
Latino Heritage Festival is to give back to the 
community through academic scholarships to 
Iowa high school and college students. The 
festival last year presented nine $1,000 schol-
arships to students. 
Joe’s hard work and dedication to uplifting 
the Latino/Hispanic community in Des Moines 
has changed the lives of countless young peo-
ple in the area. He has helped folks under-
stand why it is important to have a diverse 
community in Des Moines, and he puts a spot-
light on all of the wonderful the Latino commu-
nity has brought to the metro area. It is my 
pleasure to honor Joe Gonzalez as Iowan of 
the Week.

Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise

Ridge, Colorado for receiving the City of

ness that has reinvested significant resources

ASSOCIATION 
PRESIDENT 
JU-
LIUS JEFFERSON 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and congratulate Julius C. Jeffer-
son, Jr., for his service this past year as the 
national president of the American Library As-
sociation (ALA). A fourth-generation native of 
Washington, D.C., Julius received his bach-
elor’s degree in history from Howard Univer-
sity and his master’s degree in library science 
from the University of Maryland. As a librarian, 
Mr. Jefferson has spent his career committed 
to advocacy, information policy, diversity, eq-
uity and inclusion and professional and leader-
ship development. In recognition of his leader-
ship and dedication to librarianship, the mem-
bers of the ALA elected Mr. Jefferson to be 
their 2020–2021 president. 
Like so many of us, libraries have had to 
adapt to changing circumstances during the 
pandemic, and Julius provided extraordinary 
leadership throughout this time. Mr. Jefferson 
began his term as ALA president with a virtual 
tour of 12 libraries. The ‘‘Holding Space’’ tour 
is what he called a series of virtual conversa-
tions that highlighted the innovation and im-
pact of a diverse range of libraries around the 
nation. The ‘‘Holding Space’’ tour engaged 
stakeholders, including elected officials at 
every level of government, to advocate for li-
braries and the communities they serve. 
I note that many of us in Congress benefit 
directly from the work of Mr. Jefferson, who 
serves as a section head of the Congressional 
Research Service at the Library of Congress. 
Mr. Jefferson has also served as president of 
the national Freedom to Read Foundation and 
of the Washington, D.C. Library Association. 
As a member of several boards, including the 
Black Caucus of the American Library Asso-
ciation, Mr. Jefferson has worked to diversify 
the profession of librarianship and elevate the 
principles of diversity, equity and inclusion. 
Once again, I want to congratulate Julius 
Jefferson on his term as President of the 
American Library Association. 
RECOGNIZING THE RAYMORE 
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI

Wednesday, September 22, 2021

today to recognize the Raymore Presbyterian 
Church in Raymore, Missouri and to celebrate 
its 150th year of incorporation as a parish, 
which will be recognized on September 25th. 
In November of 1871, the Raymore Pres-
byterian Church was officially organized, and 
their current church building was completed in 
1895. It is now the oldest standing building in 
Raymore, Missouri. The parish soon began 
making positive impacts in their local commu-
nity. 
The Raymore Presbyterian Church parish 
expresses their love for their fellow neighbors 
by hosting an annual community food drive 
and by being supportive and comforting in the 
community. Since their church doors opened, 
they have continued with traditional hymnals, 
organ music, and a friendly and welcoming at-
titude. 
So, as we approach the 150th anniversary 
of incorporation of the Raymore Presbyterian 
Church in Raymore, Missouri, let us celebrate 
what God has done through the numerous 
rectors and clergy and the faithful parishioners 
in the service of God, their community, and 
our Nation.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE IN-
CORPORATION OF THE VILLAGE 
OF BIRCHWOOD 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 100th anniversary of the in-
corporation of the Village of Birchwood, Min-
nesota. Residents gathered on September 10, 
2021 to kick off its centennial celebration with 
a public reception at the village hall and un-
veiling of historic markers. 
Located just north of Saint Paul in the 
Fourth Congressional District, this charming 
village hugs the southern shores of White 
Bear Lake. Originally part of Grant Township 
like many other small communities in Wash-
ington County, it became a part of Lincoln 
Township in 1918. Development in the area 
began to boom after the streetcar service was 
extended from Wildwood Park to White Bear 
Lake in 1904. This sparked a community of 
summer cottages for residents of Saint Paul, 
who would take the streetcar to vacation on 
White Bear Lake during the hot Minnesota 
summers. 100 years ago, in 1921, Birchwood 
was first incorporated as its own village, 
though the State Legislature later decided to 
convert the ‘‘village’’ to a ‘‘City of the Fourth 
Class.’’ But the term ‘‘village’’ had stuck, and 
members of the community amended the offi-
cial name to ‘‘Birchwood Village.’’ 
Throughout its history Birchwood Village has 
been a wonderful place to experience nature 
right outside of the bustling Twin Cities, at-
tracting visitors to picturesque public parks 
and beaches, many of which remain today.

Many residents of Saint Paul would travel by 
lake steamer to shop in White Bear Lake, 
stopping through Birchwood on the way to col-
lect passengers. The summer residents and 
permanent villagers relied on local farmers for 
much of their fresh produce and milk, as the 
small village was home to only one small gro-
cery store. Many improvements came to the 
area in the 1950s, including water, gas and 
sewer service as well as blacktopped roads, a 
trajectory that led to an increase in permanent 
residents rather than summer vacationers, and 
which led the village to officially be designated 
as the City of Birchwood Village in 1974. 
The historic Birchwood Village Hall was built 
in the early 1930’s to use as a community 
building and for other town business, and the 
city council still holds all of their official meet-
ings there today. The building, which is now 
the only nonresidential structure left in the 
town, underwent a renovation in the 1970’s 
and 1980’s that including an additional room 
and new siding, covering the original mod-
ernist-style design of Saint Paul architect Mag-
nus Jemne. Then, in the spring of 2021, res-
toration crews discovered that the original 
vertical virgin-timber siding was still there in 
remarkable shape, and the village hall was re-
stored to its original design, just in time for the 
centennial celebration this fall. 
The village is led today by long-time resi-
dent Mayor Mary Wingfield, who has served in 
the role for over a decade and has eliminated 
the town of debt among many other accom-
plishments. With a population under 1,000, 
residents take great pride in their storied his-
tory and the neighborly atmosphere that has 
encouraged people to call Birchwood Village 
home for the past century and is sure to con-
tinue to do so for the next 100 years. Madam 
Speaker, please join me in recognition of the 
centennial anniversary of incorporation of 
Birchwood Village.

THORNTON FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the Thornton 
Fire Department in Thornton Colorado for 
earning the 2021 Congressional Fire Service 
Institute’s Masimo Excellence in Fire Service- 
Based EMS Award, which is given annually to 
the top fire department in the country. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
Thornton Fire Department has gone above 
and beyond to serve their community. As part 
of their efforts, they created a Pandemic Re-
sponse Team that has conducted over 20,000 
COVID tests for public employees, senior citi-
zens, first responders, and other community 
members. When vaccines became available, 
the Pandemic Response Team expanded their 
services to administer over 80,000 vaccina-
tions at drive-thru sites for city employees and 
other members of the community. The Pan-
demic Response Team’s success has led 
other fire agencies from around the country to 
look to Thornton as a model for how to effec-
tively respond to the challenges of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
In a very difficult year for fire and emer-
gency services, the Thornton Fire Depart-
ment’s innovative approach to a rapidly chang-
ing public health crisis has been crucial in sav-
ing lives and protecting the broader Thornton 
community. I extend my deepest appreciation 
to the first responders of the Thornton Fire 
Department for their dedication and out-
standing service to their community.

BLINKEN SHOULD RESIGN 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to include in the RECORD 
my remarks from the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee hearing on September 13, 2021. 
I am grateful last Monday, September 13th, 
that there was a bi-partisan zoom appearance 
of Antony Blinken provided by Chairman GREG 
MEEKS and Republican Leader MIKE MCCAUL. 
Mr. Blinken sadly revealed he is disconnected 
from reality of threats to American families at 
home as I cited in my opening statement: 
Thank you Mr. Chairman, 
Sir, in my service on the Foreign Affairs 
committee, 
the 
Global 
Terrorism 
sub-
committee, the Armed Services committee, 
the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and the 
Helsinki Commission, I have always been im-
pressed by American foreign service dip-
lomats worldwide. Their dedication to serv-
ice is inspiring. That is why I am shocked at 
your actions superseding military advice, 
leading to surrender in Afghanistan to be a 
safehaven for murderous terrorists. Biden- 
Harris have opened the Southern Border, 
stopping 
the 
wall 
of 
President 
Donald 
Trump. This allows identified terrorists of 
the Terror Watch List to enter American 
neighborhoods as lone-wolf suicide bombers 
to murder as many Americans as possible. In 
American History, American families have 
never been at greater risk of attack at home 
than today, as the Global War on Terrorism 
is not over, it has moved from abroad to 
American homes. 
As the grateful father of an Afghanistan 
veteran, I especially see your actions as in-
defensible. With 12 visits by me across Af-
ghanistan to thank S.C. Army National 
Guard troops, the 218th Brigade, commanded 
by General Bob Livingston, I know firsthand 
they appreciated serving with their Afghan 
brothers. I saw the U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development’s success in building 
schools, agricultural advances, hospitals, 
roads, and bridges. 
My beliefs have been expressed by the New 
York Post Editorial Board on September 1st. 
Sadly, the advanced military equipment 
left to the terrorists is comparable to all 
equipment provided by America to Israel 
since 1948, including drones that are a threat 
to Americans. The countries who have suf-
fered the most Islamic extremist terrorist 
attacks—India, Israel, and America are en-
dangered. They shout, Death to America, 
Death to Israel. 
We must never forget the May 8th bombing 
in Kabul where Islamic extremist terrorists 
slaughtered over 80 innocent young girls. 
You should have changed course on this 
gruesome, revealing fact alone. The mur-
derers 
of 
that 
attack 
now 
will 
have 
safehaven to target American families at 
home. 
Your bizarre abandoning of Bagram Air-
field led directly to 13 Marines murdered in 
Kabul. You should resign. I yield back. 
IN RECOGNITION OF 80 YEARS OF 
MESSIAS TEMPLE CHURCH 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Messias Temple Church lo-
cated in Ypsilanti, Michigan on the occasion of 
their 80th anniversary. For the past eight dec-
ades, this church has been the embodiment of 
faith and service. Their commitment to serving 
the Ypsilanti community in the past, present, 
and future is worthy of commendation. 
Formed in 1940, a vision inspired Elder 
John T. Elders and Sister Laura Elders to cre-
ate a sanctuary for the people of Ypsilanti. 
They began holding prayer meetings in a 
wooded area they named Messias Grove at 
the corner of Monroe and Hawkins and later in 
the home of the Barfields until they moved into 
their first church building on Monroe Street in 
1941. Faithfulness, dedication, service, and 
spreading the word is what this church has fo-
cused on since their founding. Today, the vi-
sion of the Elders lives on through Bishop 
Harry Grayson, as he has led the Messias 
Temple congregation in faith and service for 
the past thirty years. 
In the years since that first meeting, Mes-
sias Temple Church has grown tremendously, 
and the church is known as a place where 
warmth, compassion, support, and fellowship 
will always be found. The congregation’s char-
itable work has sustained those in their time of 
need. The ‘‘We Care We Share’’ outreach 
ministry provides hot meals and clothing for 
those in need. Through this program they 
have served over ten thousand neighbors. Ad-
ditionally, they host a food pantry and run pro-
grams for local youth and families. Even when 
faced with challenges like the COVID–19 pan-
demic, this congregation has never faltered in 
their commitment to serving the people of the 
community and ensuring that they are taken 
care of. Their dedication to carrying out the 
teachings of their church is unparalleled. 
The Messias Temple Church has positively 
impacted the lives of so many through their 
outreach and for that we are grateful. The 
church has been under the steadfast leader-
ship of Bishop Harry Grayson since 1991 and 
has only grown since then. Their ministry 
reaches not only across Ypsilanti, but around 
the globe. Those who know the spirit of 
Bishop Grayson know his compassion, wis-
dom, and tireless devotion to our community 
and to the faith that drives him as a servant 
of God. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Messias Temple Church for 
their 80 years of faith and service. Please join 
me in congratulating Bishop Grayson and the 
entire Messias Temple congregation on eight 
faithful decades and in wishing them the best 
of luck in the years to come.

HONORING JULIE AND PETER 
BENDER 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Julie and Peter Bender, 
who 
will 
be 
recognized 
as 
the 
2021 
Moorestown Citizens of the Year. 
Julie 
and 
Peter 
Bender 
have 
owned 
Moorestown Hardware for 20 years. Operated 
by these two Moorestown natives, the hard-
ware store offers something for everyone with 
a wide selection of materials and tools, plus 
puzzles and popcorn. However, residents of 
Moorestown will know that their business is 
much more than a store—it’s an extension of 
Julie and Peter’s commitment to community 
service. 
Throughout the year, you can find Julie and 
Peter working to support a wide array of com-
munity efforts that range from fundraising on 
behalf of scout groups and local organizations 
to 
supporting 
institutions 
such 
as 
the 
Moorestown Community House. Their busi-
ness is routinely staffed by local high school 
students and is a part of a local program that 
hires special needs students, each of them 
amplifying the themes of kindness and hard 
work. 
The Benders’ support and dedication to their 
community have made a lasting impact on 
Moorestown, whether it’s by donating 10 per-
cent of their Small Business Saturday profits 
to local institutions or by donating a grand 
piano that has been used to teach thousands 
of children how to play. 
Coretta Scott King once said, ‘‘The great-
ness of a community is most accurately meas-
ured by the compassionate actions of its 
members.’’ The Benders live and breathe their 
store and the town that supports them. Julie 
and Peter Bender are shining examples of 
service, and I commend them for receiving 
this award and their continued involvement in 
strengthening Moorestown.

Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise

Ridge, Colorado for receiving both the City of 
Wheat Ridge’s 17th Annual Cultural Commis-
sion Award and Sustainability Award for his

community. Tadd has been engaged with pro-
viding the residents of Wheat Ridge with an 
enjoyable, cultural experience through his 
local coffee shop, Stylus and Crate, which 
seeks to provide its customers with a unique 
experience integrated with vinyl and art. Lo-
cated at the BartaHouse in the heart of Wheat 
Ridge, Stylus and Crate serves up a mix of 
coffee, music, and art while also engaging in 
sustainable, environmentally friendly practices. 
The coffee shop uses coffee from local Den-
ver companies and ensures their responsible 
sourcing practices have a positive impact on 
our community and our state. 
Congratulations to Tadd Overstreet and Sty-
lus and Crate Coffee Shop for their contribu-
tion to the Wheat Ridge community and for re-
ceiving these awards.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN J. 
WHITT 
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN 
RADEWAGEN 
OF AMERICAN SAMOA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to pay tribute to the late John J. Whitt, who 
ably served as Legislative Director and then 
Chief of Staff to two of our former colleagues 
from Guam: Congressman Robert A. Under-
wood and Congresswoman Madeleine Z. 
Bordallo, respectively. Sadly, John died from 
cancer at the age of 64 on September 16, 
2021. His funeral Mass was celebrated this 
morning at Our Lady of the Chesapeake 
Catholic Church in Pasadena, Maryland, 
where his family and many friends gathered to 
memorialize his life and offer prayers of 
thanksgiving for his public service. I was fortu-
nate to be among them as my husband, Fred, 
and I were friends with John for many years. 
John was well known to the territorial Dele-
gates and their staffs in the House as he was 
a strong collaborator and visionary when it 
came to joining forces and forging con-
sensus—where appropriate and possible—to 
advance Federal policy to improve the quality 
of life for Americans residing in the territories 
and to enhance understanding in Washington 
about indigenous culture and the way of life in 
the Pacific islands. 
Born on October 15, 1956, to the late 
Charles and Christina Whitt, John was im-
mensely proud of his CHamoru heritage and 
his upbringing in Barrigada, Guam. He grad-
uated in 1974 from Father Duenas Memorial 
School in Chalan Pago, Guam, and in 1978 
from the United States Air Force Academy, 
having been nominated for appointment there 
by Guam’s first Delegate to Congress, the late 
Antonio B. Won Pat. Thereafter, John served 
our country as a B–52 pilot. But his other love, 
of politics, lured him back to his home island 
of Guam. One of his mentors, the late Colonel 
Edward Diego ‘‘Eddie’’ Reyes, USAF, who 
was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor on a 
winning ticket with the late Governor Ricardo 
J. Bordallo in 1982 recruited John to work on 
their gubernatorial campaign. It was on the 
campaign trail that Governor Bordallo, and his 
wife, Madeleine, took notice of John’s sharp 
intellect and keen political instinct. Not long 
after 
being 
sworn 
into 
office, 
Governor 
Bordallo tapped John to be his Chief of Staff 
at a tender young age of 27. After Governor 
Bordallo’s term ended, John embarked on a 
short career as a commercial regional jet serv-
ice pilot in the Southeast United States. 
When Congressman Underwood was sworn 
into office in 1993, he brought John on board 
as part of his legislative team. In the 1990s, 
John helped advance the Guam Common-
wealth Act for consideration by the House Nat-
ural Resources Committee and the Clinton Ad-
ministration and assisted with Congressman 
Underwood’s successful efforts to return ex-
cess lands taken by the Federal government 
to the people of Guam. When Typhoon Paka 
struck Guam in 1997, John was tapped by 
Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez and Lieutenant 
Governor Madeline Z. Bordallo to help coordi-
nate the GovGuam response with FEMA. 
Thereafter, John returned to Washington—this 
time to serve as the Governor’s liaison in 
town. When Lieutenant Governor Madeleine 
Bordallo was elected as Guam’s first woman 
Delegate to Congress in 2002, she tapped 
John to serve as her Chief of Staff. John 
served in that capacity for her first seven 
terms helping her advance the Guam war 
claims legislation toward its eventual enact-
ment and to provide for an orderly and bal-
anced realignment of military forces on Guam. 
John was a longtime, active member of the 
Guam Society of America, Inc., here in Wash-
ington, D.C. He was a consistent, consoling 
presence whenever one of the elders in the 
community passed away. John loved to lift our 
hearts in song and was fond of joining in the 
choir on special occasions. He would recite 
the CHamoru hymns and prayers. He was a 
gifted speechwriter and political strategist with 
an appreciation for history. He loved politics, 
the U.S. Air Force, to fly, his home village of 
Barrigada, and Guam. Most of all he loved his 
family, especially his brothers and sisters and 
his numerous nephews and nieces. He is pre-
deceased by his parents and his siblings, Al-
bert, Edwin, Emmett, and Julie Sisson. He is 
survived by his sisters, Frances Lucero (Larry) 
and Arlene Osorio (David), and his brother Jim 
Whitt (Debbie), and his nephews and nieces. 
Madam Speaker, I take this opportunity to 
remember John for his contributions to this in-
stitution as one of its staff members and for 
the positive force he made for the betterment 
of my constituents and our fellow brothers and 
sisters residing in the other territories. On be-
half of the people of American Samoa, I offer 
our condolences to his family and to our 
former colleagues, Congressman Underwood 
and Congresswoman Bordallo, on whose staff 
he served.

COMMEMORATING THE 60TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE PEACE CORPS 
SEPTEMBER 22, 2021 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today 
marks a very important event—the 60th anni-
versary of the Peace Corps. On September 
22, 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed 
the Peace Corps Act (Public Law 87–293). To 
date, more than 240,000 Americans have 
served as Peace Corps volunteers in 142 
countries around the world. Prior to the global 
COVID–19 pandemic, there were nearly 8,000 
Peace Corps volunteers serving in 61 coun-
tries. Today, Peace Corps volunteers stand 
ready to return to their crucial work once it is 
safe and prudent to do so. 
Like successive generations of young Amer-
icans, my wife Patti and I answered President 
Kennedy’s call and served in the Peace Corps 
in Ethiopia from 1966 to 1968. As co-chair of 
the Congressional Peace Corps Caucus, I am 
proud to continue working in support of the 
Peace Corps’ mission, its volunteers, and the 
indelible impact their service has on the lives 
of so many around the world. 
And so today we commemorate 60 years of 
Peace Corps. We celebrate over 240,000 
Peace Corps volunteers who have served 
around the world, and we celebrate those who 
have worked to fulfill the three goals both dur-
ing and after their volunteer service: 1) To 
help the people of interested countries in 
meeting their need for trained men and 
women; 2) To help promote a better under-
standing of Americans on the part of the peo-
ples served; and 3) To help promote a better 
understanding of other peoples on the part of 
Americans. 
As Peace Corps volunteers have returned to 
America, they have continued to serve over 
their lifetimes. They serve as volunteers at 
twice the rate of other Americans. They are in 
our nation’s schools as educators. They are in 
community programs as leaders and mentors 
across the country. And a few are even found 
in the United States Congress. 
Today, there are global leaders of many 
countries who have been taught by Peace 
Corps volunteers in their high schools, in their 
grammar schools, or in their universities. They 
have a very special understanding of America 
because of the Peace Corps. They know 
Americans. They know that Americans have a 
big heart, and they have a desire to see 
progress, economic and social progress, in 
every country of this world. 
The benefits of the Peace Corps at home 
and abroad are undeniable. Congress last re-
authorized the Peace Corps in 1999 (Public 
Law 106–30), which expired at the end of fis-
cal year 2003. Now more than ever, Congress 
must support the Peace Corps’ mission and 
realize President Kennedy’s vision of genera-
tions of young Americans, ready to serve their 
nation and make the world a better place. 
The bipartisan ‘‘Peace Corps Reauthoriza-
tion Act of 2021’’ (H.R. 1456), which I intro-
duced earlier this year on National Peace 
Corps Day (March 1), would do just that by 
providing additional federal resources to better 
support current, returning, and former Peace 
Corps volunteers. This critical legislation will 
help the agency and volunteers impacted by 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
H.R. 1456 builds upon the Sam Farr and 
Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115–256) and the Kate Puzey 
Peace Corps Volunteer Protection Act of 2011 
(Public Law 112–57). The bill guarantees addi-
tional health insurance coverage for returned 
volunteers immediately following their service 
and requires the Peace Corps to better facili-
tate long-term public and private health insur-
ance coverage options for returned volunteers. 
The bill also increases the federal workers’ 
compensation rate for all Peace Corps volun-
teers injured or disabled during their service 
and strengthens protections of volunteers 
against reprisals or retaliations for reporting 
wrongdoing or malfeasance. 
President Kennedy understood in 1961 that 
the Peace Corps would ‘‘permit our people to 
exercise more fully their responsibilities in the 
great common cause of world development.’’ I 
can think of no better way to honor the 60 
years of Peace Corps service than for this 
Congress to pass the bipartisan ‘‘Peace Corps 
Reauthorization Act of 2021’’ (H.R. 1456) to 
advance that vision into the 21st century. 
To all the current and returned Peace Corps 
volunteers, I thank them for their commitment 
to serving others on this, the 60th anniversary. 
Our work continues.

RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PEACE CORPS 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the 60th Anniver-
sary of the Peace Corps Act and the dedi-
cated heroes who work tirelessly to bring a 
positive change in communities across the 
world. 
President Kennedy signed the Peace Corps 
Act into law in 1961 and presented the oppor-
tunity for American citizens to be innovators 
and trailblazers in communities abroad. In the 
last 60 years, over 240,000 American citizens 
have humbly worked across the globe with 
local leaders to meet the needs of the host 
country’s communities. 
It makes me proud to know that for more 
than a decade, California has led the nation in 
recruiting Peace Corps Volunteers. Since 
1961, 31,752 Californians have decided to 
share their heart, creativity, and ingenuity in 
over 140 countries. Our nation is thankful for 
the Peace Corps volunteers who go to their 
host country to bring a greater understanding 
of American values. And we can’t forget the 
lessons that volunteers learn during their time 
abroad, and how their service helps them be-
come more compassionate leaders back 
home. Peace Corps volunteers don’t only 
serve as ambassadors for the global commu-
nity but also as role models for a younger 
generation in the U.S. I hope their passion to 
serve others continues to transform and in-
spire our communities. 
Despite the coronavirus pandemic tempo-
rarily suspending all operations in 2020 and 
evacuating all 7,000 volunteers across the 
world, the Peace Corps stands at the ready to 
once more promote peace and friendship in 
every corner of the world. 
So, I want to take this moment to say thank 
you, not just to the men and women from Cali-
fornia in the Peace Corps, but also to all those 
who serve and have served proudly with the 
Peace Corps. 
Today, Madam Speaker, it is my honor to 
recognize the 60th Anniversary of the Peace 
Corps Act and the men and women who in-
trepidly go out into the world to bring change 
and peace through hard work and American 
values.

TRIBUTE TO U.S. NAVY CORPSMAN 
MAXTON ‘‘MAX’’ SOVIAK 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 22, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to U.S. Navy Corpsman Maxton ‘‘Max’’ 
Soviak of Berlin Heights, Ohio. Max, always 
faithful, became one of the 13 heroes from the 
Navy, Army, and Marine Corps who gave their 
lives on August 26, 2021 at Kabul Airport in 
service to our country. 
Corpsman Soviak was 22 years old, not 
even old enough to remember the terror at-
tacks of 9/11 that spurred the war in which he 
would later be deployed. 
And yet, at just 18, Max took it upon himself 
to answer the Nation’s call to preserve and 
protect the blessings of liberty. 
Reflecting upon his life, we bear witness to 
a young man who was beloved by friends and 
neighbors in his close-knit hometown of Berlin 
Heights, Ohio. 
He excelled in school, was named to the 
honor roll, and earned a two-year certificate in 
electrical technology from the EHOVE Career 
Center. 
He thrived in wrestling, football, Boy Scouts, 
and the school band. 
And he was adored beyond measure by his 
parents and 12 siblings. 
Max embodied the best of our Nation, a 
man of many passions, who was lively, strong,

September 22, 2021 
independent, and fiercely loyal. Max’s talents 
could have taken him in whatever direction he 
desired, and he did just that by enlisting in the 
U.S. Navy. 
After graduating from Recruit Training in Illi-
nois, Max was assigned to the 1st Marine 
Regiment, 1st Marine Division out of Camp 
Pendleton, California. 
He would go on to work in the immunization 
department at the Navy Hospital Guam, where 
he endeared himself to the locals by becoming 
a part of the local wrestling and martial arts 
community. 
Max arrived in Afghanistan carrying with him 
his devotion to serving others, as well as ex-
tensive training in emergency medical tech-
niques. 
As a Corpsman and leader, Max was known 
as a ‘‘Doc, a specially trained Corpsman who 
provides both medical care to Marines in the 
unit, and is also ready and able to engage in 
combat right alongside them. 
Docs are widely respected and possess an 
unbreakable bond with the Marines alongside 
whom they serve, owing to their responsibility 
of keeping the unit alive. 
Max’s duties extended beyond providing 
care and comfort to his unit. During his final 
days at Kabul airport, Max worked around the 
clock to help evacuate Americans as well as 
Afghan citizens, including very young children, 
who faced a dangerous and uncertain future if 
they remained. 
Just before the terrorist attack on the air-
port, one of Max’s final duties was to provide 
comfort to the children in need. One young 
boy in particular was brought through Abbey 
Gate and handed into the arms of Corpsman 
Soviak to be looked after. 
This final act of Corpsman Soviak, providing 
aid to those going through unprecedented 
chaos, was a result of his extensive military 
training. But more than that, it came from who 
Max Soviak was at his core. 
A strong, smart, loving, decent person who 
made a decision, regardless of the uncertainty 
or danger he faced, to join the armed forces 
and serve his nation in her hour of need. 
The immensity of Max’s loss to his family, 
friends, community, and our country, is as in-
calculable as it is heartbreaking. 
That a future as bright as his would never 
come to pass causes a pain that will never 
truly fade. 
But in the face of this unspeakable tragedy, 
where only darkness and sadness seem to re-
side, we hope that those who knew him and 
loved him most may take comfort and pride in 
the fact that their Max—their brother, son, and 
friend—did not die in vain. 
Max’s courage and dedication touched the 
lives of countless Americans and Afghans, in-
cluding a young boy who had lost everything. 
By standing up and answering the call to 
protect and defend innocent civilians, Max’s 
actions, and his life helped to ensure that 
more than 120,000 people were able to reach 
safety after making their way through the 
gates where Max was stationed. 
The men, women, and children whose 
names he will never know, but whose lives 
were assured by his selflessness—will serve 
as a symbol of his commitment until their final 
days. 
It will never be possible to repay the debt 
America owes Corpsman Max Soviak or his 
family. He made the ultimate sacrifice, and his 
family and a grateful nation will forever mourn 
his loss. We will honor his memory, and ex-
press our deep, unending gratitude for his will-
ingness to serve America, and provide safety 
and comfort to strangers in need. Max dem-
onstrated an uncommon heroism. For those 
who knew him at home in Berlin Heights, his 
patriotism and valor are exactly what they ex-
pected of him. 
God bless and hold closely Navy Corpsman 
Max Soviak.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of en bloc amendments #2 and #3 which 
include three of my amendments that will im-
prove transparency in our overseas contin-
gency contracts, make our sanctions regimes 
more effective, and strengthen our ability to 
combat illicit financing networks. 
My first amendment, #252, reauthorizes the 
Commission on Wartime Contracting which 
will engage in vital oversight of our contracting 
and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, Iraq 
and other areas where we conduct contin-
gency operations. 
This Commission has a proven track record 
of helping us reduce waste and fraud in over-
seas operations contracting. Indeed, in its 
prior iteration, from 2008 to 2011, the Com-
mission found between $31 billion and $60 bil-
lion in U.S. taxpayer funds that were lost due 
to contract waste, fraud, and abuse in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. 
Now that the U.S. has withdrawn from Af-
ghanistan after 20 years, and as we prepare 
to end our combat mission in Iraq by the end 
of this year—after 19 years of war—it would 
be irresponsible not to examine what came of 
the hundreds of billions in contract dollars 
spent during these operations. 
Amendment #253 comprises the language 
of two vital bills. The first is the Combating Il-
licit Finance Through Public-Private Partner-
ships Act, which would expand the mandate of 
the interagency supervisory team convened by 
the Department of the Treasury to examine 
strategies to improve public-private partner-
ships to counter illicit finance by including 
sanctions evasion and other illicit financial ac-
tivities. The amendment also contains the pro-
visions of the Strengthening Awareness of 
Sanctions Act, which would establish within 
the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) a 
voluntary public-private information sharing 
partnership among law enforcement agencies, 
national security agencies, financial institu-
tions, and OFAC, which will allow for a more 
effective administration and enforcement to 
better administer and enforce economic and 
trade sanctions. 
This illicit finance amendment will ensure 
that the sanctions we impose are able to suc-
cessfully cut off the funding that allow bad ac-
tors to continue to carry out terror attacks, traf-
fic in drugs, humans, and weapons, pose 
threats to the U.S. and our allies, and cause 
instability around the world. 
Finally, amendment #254 directs the Presi-
dent to re-establish the Afghanistan Threat Fi-
nance Cell. This interagency effort would bring 
together law enforcement, military, and finan-
cial intelligence resources to identify, target, 
disrupt, and dismantle illicit financial networks. 
Like the Commission on Wartime Con-
tracting, the Afghanistan Threat Finance Cell 
has also proven itself as an effective body: not 
long after its establishment in 2008, it was the 
first organization to reveal an interdependent 
web of links between corrupt Afghan officials, 
criminals, drug traffickers, and insurgents. 
Thanks to the efforts of the Threat Finance 
Cell, the Executive Branch took action to pur-
sue broad efforts to address and combat Af-
ghan corruption. 
While the Afghanistan Threat Finance Cell 
ended in 2014, this effort remains just as im-
portant, especially now that the U.S. no longer 
has an in-country military presence. The re-
newed Cell will serve a critical role in tracking 
and disrupting the use of threat finance by in-
surgent groups and other illicit actors, while 
augmenting the oversight work of regional fi-
nancial investigative units. Only by eliminating 
the sources of funding can we effectively take 
on the terrorists, drug traffickers, and other 
criminal elements that continue to feed into 
the corruption and instability in Afghanistan. 
Inclusion of these amendments will strength-
en congressional oversight and government 
transparency, as well as bolster the effective-
ness of our sanctions, and provide vital tools 
with which to combat fraud, waste, and cor-
ruption. 
I would like to thank Chairman SMITH and 
Ranking Member ROGERS for including these 
three amendments in the two en bloc amend-
ments. I would urge all Members to support 
the passage of these en blocs.
