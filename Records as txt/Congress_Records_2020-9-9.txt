PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Faithful 
Father, 
our 
refuge 
and 
strength, give us such lawmakers that 
their lives will enable You to be glori-
fied by bringing healing to our land. 
Lord, provide our Nation with physical, 
mental, social, and spiritual healing by 
the power of Your grace. Sustained by 
this grace, may our Senators seek to 
please You in all they do. Inspire them 
to give You cheerfully their highest al-
legiance. 
Be gracious, mighty God, to our Na-
tion and world. Empower us all until 
the words of our mouths and the medi-
tation of our hearts are acceptable to 
You. 
We pray in Your sacred Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IOWA FARMERS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
this year has been one of the most 
challenging years for Iowa farmers dur-
ing my 40 years in the Senate. Farmers 
have had to confront coronavirus sup-
ply 
chain 
disruptions, 
widespread 
drought, and a record windstorm that 
moved across our State. 
During my 99 county meetings, I saw 
Iowa fields that were completely de-
stroyed—150 miles long and 40 miles 
wide. The images of mature crops lying 
flat on the ground were heartbreaking. 
Iowans are a very resilient people, but 
the hurt the farmers have endured this 
year will be felt in our State for a few 
years to come. 
Senator ERNST and I will keep fight-
ing to strengthen Iowa’s farm economy 
despite this year’s very challenging sit-
uations. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
anyone watching the Senate yesterday 
saw another installment in an ongoing 
series that has become somewhat fa-
miliar. Republicans roll out yet an-
other effort to forge a bipartisan com-
promise around coronavirus relief, and 
Democrats reply with partisan cheap 
shots and threats to block everything. 
Republicans develop a serious plan to 
get historic amounts of additional 
money in the pipeline for kids, jobs, 
and schools, and Democrats just point 
fingers, call names, and keep blocking 
American families from getting any 
more help before the November elec-
tion. 
In July, Republicans put forward a 
serious framework, but Speaker PELOSI 
and the Democratic leader refused to 
talk unless the starting point was their 
literally absurd $3.4 trillion far-left 
wish list that even House Democrats 
called a stunt. 
In August, with those talks stalled, 
Republicans proposed narrow agree-
ments on specific urgent policies to 
help families, unemployment benefits, 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program. 
Democrats refused again. This time 
their invented excuse was that any as-
sistance short of their entire wish list 
was 
too 
‘‘piecemeal’’—too 
‘‘piece-
meal’’—and not worth doing. 
If Democrats didn’t get their diver-
sity studies for the cannabis industry, 
stimulus checks for illegal immigrants, 
and tax cuts for blue State million-
aires, they would make sure millions of 
Americans would lose their unemploy-
ment benefits and PPP would close. 
That is what they threatened, and that 
is what they did. 
So here we are in September. Schools 
and colleges have gone without the $105 
billion that Republicans wanted to give 
them back in July. That is more 
money than Speaker PELOSI put in her 
bill. 
American workers have gone without 
the second round of the PPP that Re-
publicans proposed weeks and weeks 
ago. Speaker PELOSI had no money for 
PPP in her $3.4 trillion bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5480 
September 9, 2020 
The race for treatments and vaccines 
has gone without the additional fund-
ing that Republicans wanted to deliver. 
Families have gone without the eco-
nomic relief that Republicans wanted 
to put in their pockets. And Wash-
ington Democrats have just kept try-
ing to run out the clock—run out the 
clock—until November. 
But here is one thing: The Senate 
majority works for the American peo-
ple. We fight for American families. We 
are not going to let Speaker PELOSI 
and the Democratic leader kill and 
bury coronavirus relief behind closed 
doors without putting every Senator 
on the record. So we have put together 
a new, targeted proposal containing 
several of the most urgent and most 
popular policies that would help Amer-
icans right now. Tomorrow, the whole 
Senate will vote on it. 
It will be a procedural vote. It is not 
a vote to pass our bill tomorrow, pre-
cisely as written. It is a vote for Sen-
ators to say whether they want to 
move forward toward huge amounts of 
relief for kids, for jobs, for healthcare, 
or whether they are happier doing ab-
solutely nothing. 
That is what every single Senator 
will decide tomorrow. Do you want to 
do something—something—or do you 
want to do nothing? 
Democratic leaders know this simple 
choice will put the spotlight on their 
partisan antics. They know this vote 
will expose their obstruction. 
Speaker PELOSI and Leader SCHUMER 
were attacking our new proposal yes-
terday before they even read it, before 
it had even come out. I would normally 
make fun of that, but in this case it 
makes perfect sense because their posi-
tion clearly is that they do not want 
any bipartisan relief whatsoever. They 
do not want any bipartisan relief what-
soever to reach American families 
prior to the election. 
They didn’t even need to see what we 
were proposing. If it helped working 
families in any way—in any way—be-
tween now and November 3, Speaker 
PELOSI and Leader SCHUMER knew for 
sure they opposed it. 
Their red herrings and cherry-picked 
arguments have now given way to total 
dishonesty. Yesterday, our colleague 
from New York railed against a provi-
sion 
pertaining 
to 
critical 
supply 
chains, calling it some sinister give-
away to big business. A provision per-
taining to critical supply chains he 
called a sinister giveaway to big busi-
ness? That provision is cosponsored by 
his own Democratic ranking member 
on the committee. So either the Demo-
cratic leader is impugning his own 
ranking member right along with Re-
publicans or else he simply doesn’t 
know what he is talking about. 
Likewise, the junior Senator from 
Vermont attacked this provision as 
‘‘corporate welfare,’’ but he himself did 
not vote against this very provision in 
committee on two occasions. 
They are so desperate to keep work-
ing families from getting any help be-
fore the election that some Democrats 
are now attacking things they pre-
viously supported. At this point it is 
just silly season on the Democratic 
side. They have run out of excuses not 
to legislate, and even their cheap shots 
just backfire in embarrassing ways. 
So tomorrow—tomorrow—the Senate 
will cut through all the noise with one 
vote. Every Senator will either say 
they want to move forward, agree 
where we can, make a law to help peo-
ple, and keep arguing over our dif-
ferences later or say they prefer to do 
absolutely nothing. 
Every Senator will vote on this sig-
nificant package, which secures Fed-
eral unemployment benefits, reopens 
the PPP for a second draw, sends more 
than $100 billion to keep kids safe in 
school, helps parents with childcare, 
helps 
families 
afford 
expenses 
or 
homeschooling, and rebuilds our stra-
tegic medical stockpile. 
This is not a simplistic argument 
over big versus small. Republicans 
want more money for K–12 and college 
than was in the Democratic bill. We 
want more money for PPP, which their 
bill forgot to fund. These are bipartisan 
priorities that Democrats left behind 
and Republicans want to take care of. 
So 
tomorrow—tomorrow—American 
families will learn who wants to make 
a law for them and who is happiest if 
they get nothing. 
f 
146TH KENTUCKY DERBY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on a completely different matter, on 
Saturday, the world of sports once 
again revolved around my hometown of 
Louisville 
for 
the 
146th 
Kentucky 
Derby. Like so many other events, the 
coronavirus made this year’s derby 
look a little different. 
The race had already been postponed 
for only the second time in history, 
and none of the 150,000 spectators who 
normally fill Churchill Downs were 
there to sing ‘‘My Old Kentucky 
Home,’’ but the most exciting 2 min-
utes in sports refused to be defeated. 
The derby remains the longest con-
tinuously held sporting event, and this 
year’s Labor Day derby proved worth 
the wait. The winning thoroughbred, 
Authentic, outlasted a ferocious chal-
lenge from the favorite. So I would like 
to extend the Senate’s congratulations 
to the entire Hall of Fame team. 
(The remarks of Mr. MCCONNELL per-
taining to the introduction of S. 4547 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I yield the floor.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning 
business is closed. 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Brett H. Lud-
wig, of Wisconsin, to be United States 
District Judge for the Eastern District 
of Wisconsin. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the amount of 1984-like doublespeak 
that comes out of the other side never 
ceases to amaze, and I guess it is be-
coming more and more extreme. The 
Republican leader calls his bill bipar-
tisan? I would remind the leader that 
‘‘bipartisan’’ means two parties, Demo-
crats and Republicans. His bill is only 
a product of the Republican side. 
The Republican leader said Demo-
crats are delaying things. Was it Demo-
crats who called for a pause? Was it 
Democrats who, when COVID was rag-
ing, said we had to assess the situa-
tion? Oh, no, it was the Republican 
leader who said those things. Mean-
while, Democrats in the House, sup-
ported by Democrats in the Senate, 
have passed a strong comprehensive 
bill. We have just been waiting and 
waiting for our Republican friends to 
get their act together so they might 
come close—even near to the moment 
that we need. 
So, after taking a pause on COVID 
relief for 4 months, finally, finally, fi-
nally, Senate Republicans are realizing 
the damage that their delay has done 
to our economy and the Nation’s 
health. 
Yesterday, Leader MCCONNELL
an-
nounced that by the end of the week, 
the Senate would vote on a new 
slimmed-down version of an already 
skinny Republican bill. We know what 
happened here. The leader did nothing 
for months, but the American people 
are demanding action. Republican Gov-
ernors, local officials, hospitals, small 
businesses—everyone is demanding ac-
tion. Restaurants, performance stages, 
and places are demanding action not 
just of Democrats but of both sides of 
the aisle. 
So the leader had to do something. 
At first, he tried to cobble together a 
legislative response, but it failed spec-
tacularly. Leader MCCONNELL was un-
able to bring it even forward for a vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5481 
September 9, 2020 
That happened a couple of weeks ago. 
So, now, because he can’t get the votes 
because, by his own admission, 20 of his 
own members want no money voted in 
this crisis—how many Americans think 
there should be no money at the height 
of the greatest economic crisis we have 
had since the Depression, the height of 
the greatest health crisis we have had 
since the Spanish pandemic flu? How 
many Americans think the Federal 
Government should do nothing? But a 
large chunk of the Republican caucus 
evidently seems to, by the Republican 
leader’s own admission. 
So he couldn’t even get this $1 tril-
lion bill passed. It was pathetic. So, 
now, Republicans are going to cut their 
original inadequate $1 trillion bill in 
half in a desperate attempt to find the 
lowest common denominator among 
Republicans. 
As the economic pain for millions of 
Americans advances, Senate Repub-
licans are actually moving backward. 
Of course, up until now, the issue in 
our negotiations with the White House, 
where Leader MCCONNELL had been ab-
sent, has been about the size and scope 
of the next relief bill. Democrats 
passed a $3 trillion bill in the House 
over 2 months ago. Why? That is the 
need of America during this great cri-
sis. We didn’t come up with just any 
numbers. We studied it carefully. We 
talked to school administrators and 
asked: What do you need? We talked to 
hospital 
administrators 
and 
asked: 
What do you need? We talked to res-
taurants, and we talked to performance 
places and asked: What do you need? 
And we came up with a carefully 
thought-out bill that met the need. 
Our Republican friends didn’t meet 
the need. They came out with what 
they call a skinny bill at $1 trillion. We 
all know why the rightwing ideology 
that has so gripped so much of the Re-
publican Party doesn’t want to spend 
any money. We, at least, in an offer to 
compromise, offered to meet our Re-
publican friends in the middle. They 
balked. No, no, they didn’t want to 
compromise. Their way or no way. And 
now, instead of improving their offer, 
Senate Republicans have made it even 
stingier and even less appropriate for 
the looming crisis that we have. 
I am not sure what kind of negoti-
ating strategy that is, but it sure isn’t 
a serious strategy, and it sure will not 
be successful. That is why I called it 
cynical yesterday. 
COVID–19 has changed nearly every 
aspect of American life. The needs in 
our country are so great. The pain felt 
by average Americans is severe. Yet 
the new Republican proposal doesn’t 
include food assistance for people who 
can’t feed their kids, rental assistance 
for people being kicked out of their 
homes, or aid to State and local gov-
ernments desperate not to lay off bus-
drivers and sanitation workers and 
firefighters. 
In their new bill, Republicans will 
not even let the States use existing 
funds to cover lost revenues. It leaves 
out important worker protections. It 
leaves out hazard pay. It leaves out 
broadband so desperately needed in 
rural areas. It leaves out funding for 
safe elections and help for the census. 
It shortchanges our healthcare system 
and education system. 
As the school year begins across the 
country, the new ‘‘emaciated’’ Repub-
lican bill basically makes funding for 
schools contingent upon reopening. So 
if you are a school that is struggling 
with the costs of operating remotely, if 
you are a school that would like to re-
open safely but needs help instituting 
new standards and protections, the 
GOP bill says ‘‘tough luck.’’ Donald 
Trump comes up with this idea that all 
schools must reopen, and our Repub-
lican colleagues, in obeisance, come up 
with a proposal that says to the mil-
lions of kids who will go to school re-
motely or in hybrid situations: We are 
going to make it much harder for you 
to get help. 
That is to say nothing about the fact 
that the new Republican COVID bill is 
ladened with poison pills designed to 
make its passage impossible. Someone 
looking at this would say: If they want 
to come to a compromise, why would 
they put poison pills in the bill that 
they know are nonstarters to getting 
bipartisan compromise? Is it because 
they really don’t want a bill but a po-
litical issue—one that would ulti-
mately backfire on them, I believe. But 
they have done it. 
There is broad corporate immunity 
that my colleague in Illinois has so fo-
cused on—an immunity provision that 
would protect corporations that put 
their workers in harm’s way from legal 
liability. And evidently to get a hand-
ful of hard-right Senators who didn’t 
want to spend any money, they added a 
partisan school choice program long 
sought by Secretary DeVos—hardly a 
friend of public education. 
Republicans call their new bill ‘‘tar-
geted,’’ but by almost every measure, 
it misses the mark. It is impossible to 
look at the new GOP proposal as a seri-
ous effort to passing a law. It is impos-
sible to look at this GOP proposal and 
not wonder: Do our Republican friends 
see the damage in America? Are they 
still intent on playing these same 
games? Are they still trying to fool the 
American people by calling the harshly 
partisan proposal bipartisan, as the 
leader just did? 
If Republicans were serious about 
achieving a result, they would have 
joined 
negotiations 
with 
Speaker 
PELOSI, me, and the White House. If 
Leader MCCONNELL was so eager to get 
something done, why wasn’t he at the 
table for weeks? Republicans could 
have encouraged the White House to 
improve their offer, to meet us in the 
middle, to break the logjam. Where 
were 
the 
Republican 
Senators? 
I 
haven’t heard a voice speak out and 
say we should meet in the middle. They 
are all so afraid of what Donald Trump 
might say, I suppose. 
Leader MCCONNELL, instead, crafted a 
partisan 
bill—with 
no 
input 
from 
Democrats—even leaner and meaner 
than the previous Republican proposal 
and would rush it to the floor 2 days 
after releasing it. This is one of the 
most cynical moves by any leader I 
have ever seen. This isn’t about mak-
ing law or working in good faith with 
the other party. Leader MCCONNELL 
isn’t searching for bipartisan progress. 
He seems to be looking for political 
cover. It will not pass on Thursday, and 
we will be right back where we are 
today, needing our Republican col-
leagues to understand the gravity of 
this situation in our country and to 
work with us on a bill that actually 
makes some sense and deals with the 
magnitude of this awful crisis. 
SAVE OUR STAGES ACT 
Madam President, now a final mat-
ter. The new Republican bill is silent 
on a whole host of crucial issues, in-
cluding a number of items that affect 
small businesses. 
Over the State work period, I visited 
several independent music and theater 
venues that have struggled during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Live venues were 
some of the first to close, and they will 
be the last to open up. Many of them 
are already on the brink of collapse. 
There is the rent, the utilities, and an 
entire year without revenue. 
Live venues—by definition, people 
are close together, so they couldn’t 
continue during COVID, and they have 
to wait until the very end. But they are 
so important to so many commu-
nities—urban, suburban, and rural. 
Unfortunately, according to one sur-
vey, 90 percent of independent venues 
will have to close permanently without 
Federal funding. What an incredible 
shame that would be. These are indie 
music venues, jazz clubs, symphony or-
chestra halls, comedy clubs, and even 
Broadway, which is made up of dozens 
of small theaters that employ thou-
sands of workers, from the box office to 
the 
backstage. 
These 
independent 
venues provide 75 percent of all artists’ 
income, and they drive economic activ-
ity within our communities at res-
taurants, hotels, stores, and other es-
tablishments. 
But what we risk if these venues 
close permanently isn’t purely eco-
nomic, although it is so important. I 
was in Albany and Syracuse yesterday. 
It is estimated that the arts are one of 
the top five employers in both of those 
cities. We can’t afford to let this hap-
pen. Economically, we will lose thou-
sands and thousands of jobs. Cities will 
lose city downtowns, and rural areas, 
as well, will lose their vitality. 
The risk, if these venues close perma-
nently, is not just economic. They are 
the very fabric of our society, which 
has been stretched to the breaking 
point by this crisis. Once this is all 
over, we will need these venues and the 
passionate, inspiring, artistic work 
that they help make possible as we 
come together again and try to make 
sense of this incredibly difficult mo-
ment in our history. 
We have a bipartisan bill—Save Our 
Stages Act—that would create a new

$10-billion SBA program to provide 
Federal grants to live-venue operators 
so that when, God willing, these live 
stages can reopen safely, these venues 
can come back bigger and better than 
ever. Those grants would go for 6 
months, giving the venues enough time 
and breathing room to recuperate, and, 
God willing, if there is a vaccine in 6 
months, they will be able, God willing, 
to open again. 
One of the most difficult parts of this 
pandemic has been the effect on Amer-
ican society, arts, and culture. These 
are the things we live for: sports, com-
edy, theater, and music. When the day 
finally comes that the pandemic is be-
hind us, we will want to celebrate once 
again with friends and family at these 
venues now in danger of closing. 
I hope we can come together in the 
future to pass the Save Our Stages Act 
and save this essential part of Amer-
ican culture.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleague from New 
York. Many of the things he has said 
on the floor this morning reflect what 
I have seen back in Illinois in the last 
5 or 6 weeks that we have been home, 
people I have spoken to who are genu-
inely 
suffering 
because 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic and the state of 
the American economy. 
There was a moment here on the 
floor of the Senate earlier this year 
when the gravity of the situation 
brought us together. It was March 26— 
almost 6 months ago—when we voted 96 
to 0 to pass the CARES Act, the $3 tril-
lion effort to try to keep America’s 
economy alive and breathing during 
this pandemic and the impact it has 
had on all of our lives. That is $3 tril-
lion—money for the unemployed, sub-
stantial sums for those who are about 
to see their lives transformed over-
night. Laid off and fired from jobs that 
may never return, they tried to keep 
their families together with mortgage 
payments, rent payments, automobile 
loans, the credit responsibilities they 
faced, and just putting food on the 
table. 
It was a wrenching, disquieting situa-
tion for so many of those families, and 
we said that we should give them $600 
a week—$600 a week—in Federal assist-
ance to get through this period. What 
we did not only helped those families, 
but it helped the economy. The money 
those families received was spent al-
most instantaneously. That is under-
standable. They are struggling to sur-
vive. 
But we knew that the program we en-
acted on March 26 had a termination 
date of July 31. We hoped that by then 
the pandemic would be behind us, our 
economy would be recovering, and we 
wouldn’t need any further relief. We 
were wrong—terribly wrong. We still 
face this coronavirus in a way that we 
never expected 6 months ago. It is still 
a challenge—a terrible challenge that 
has claimed over 180,000 American lives 
to date. 
I could speak for a few minutes here 
about our response as a nation to this 
pandemic and talk about the lack of 
leadership from the very top in Wash-
ington when it came to dealing with 
this public health crisis, but suffice it 
to say for the moment that two num-
bers tell the story. The United States 
has 4 percent of the world’s population. 
Sadly, we have 20 percent of the 
COVID–19 deaths in the world. 
The United States has not responded 
as expected. Innocent people have died. 
The situation was chaotic in the White 
House. 
The 
leadership 
we 
needed 
wasn’t there. 
Where are we today? Here we are in 
the second week of September. Where 
are we now as we reflect on the situa-
tion? Many of us believe we still face a 
grievous, serious challenge and need to 
respond accordingly, but others see it 
differently. 
Senator MCCONNELL, the leader on 
the Republican side, is going to offer a 
proposal tomorrow that is a fraction— 
a fraction—of what was offered on 
March 26 to deal with this crisis. Many 
people, obviously on the Republican 
side, feel that America is headed in the 
right direction and therefore we don’t 
need to make a substantial investment 
in people, in businesses, and in the 
health and resources of this country. 
For those who come to the floor and 
argue that America is headed in the 
right direction, three-fourths of the 
American people disagree with them. 
You see, in a survey taken just 2 weeks 
ago, 75 percent of the American people 
said America is headed in the wrong di-
rection. So when the Republicans come 
up with a modest—almost immodest— 
proposal that they are going to bring 
to the floor tomorrow, they disagree 
with three-fourths of the American 
people. 
Many of them obviously believe that 
we don’t have to make a massive in-
vestment in helping families who are 
fighting unemployment, helping busi-
nesses to survive. They must believe 
that the worst is behind us. Well, it 
turns out that two out of three of the 
American people disagree with them. 
That is right—two out of three in a re-
cent survey in America said the worst 
is still ahead. Wrong direction, 75 per-
cent; the worst is still ahead, two- 
thirds. 
What is the response on the Repub-
lican side? First, it was silence. You 
see, it has been almost 4 months now 
since the House of Representatives, 
under the Democratic leadership of 
Speaker PELOSI, passed the Heroes 
Act—a $3 trillion investment to make 
sure that we stood by the families who 
were unemployed, to make sure that 
we put money into the hands of busi-
nesses that needed to survive, to make 
certain that we had adequate testing 
across the United States, to give 
money to schools so that they could 
weather this crisis as they readjust to 
the challenges they face, and to put 
money in the hands of hospitals and 
providers that in some cases are just 
hanging by a thread because of the 
state of the economy and this medical 
challenge. 
That 
is 
what 
Speaker 
PELOSI did almost 4 months ago. 
In the meantime, in that 4-month pe-
riod, the Republican leader of the Sen-
ate has done nothing—nothing. He 
didn’t bring a bill to the floor. He 
didn’t pass a bill and call for a con-
ference committee. In fact, during this 
entire period of time, the Republican 
leader in the Senate has refused to per-
sonally attend the negotiations be-
tween the White House and congres-
sional leaders. Both he and House Re-
publican Leader MCCARTHY have boy-
cotted any negotiation sessions. Any 
persuasion they want to bring to the 
issue, they bring to the floor of the 
Senate in speeches, not behind closed 
doors, where compromise is reached 
and where, in fact, we were successful 
last March, passing the CARES Act. 
So now we face a challenge as a na-
tion. Which party will stand up for 
America to weather this crisis and 
come out strong? The Democrats have 
a proposal. We have had it for 4 
months. 
The 
Republicans, 
tomorrow, 
will 
offer a skinny—some say emaciated— 
version of that proposal. They want to 
take the assistance to unemployed 
Americans—800,000 of them in my home 
State, millions across the Nation—and 
cut it in half. Did Senator MCCONNELL 
get a news flash that I missed that 
mortgage payments will be cut in half 
as of tomorrow, that rental payments 
will be cut in half as of tomorrow, that 
car payments will be cut in half, that 
the cost of food will be cut in half? Not 
at all. 
We know these families will face the 
same obligations and, under the Repub-
lican proposal, receive a fraction of 
what they were given and have re-
ceived between March and the end of 
July. That is unfair to these families. 
I know what is happening in food 
banks across Illinois, and I am sure it 
is the same case in Kentucky, perhaps 
in Georgia, perhaps in New York. Peo-
ple are flooding these food banks ask-
ing for help. Some of them are embar-
rassed 
by 
their 
situation. 
They 
shouldn’t be, but they are. Many people 
who used to volunteer at these same 
food banks are now standing in line, 
looking at their shoes, hoping to take 
enough food home to make it through 
a week. 
That is the reality, but it is not the 
reality that is reflected in the Senate 
action this week. What we have from 
Senator MCCONNELL is a small effort at 
a time when America needs a substan-
tial effort to deal with not only the sit-
uation facing our economy but also the 
coronavirus. 
I am troubled, too, because I rep-
resent a State that is so diverse, with 
the great city of Chicago but all the 
way downstate—my roots—smalltown 
America, rural America. Many of the

September 9, 2020 
hospitals and healthcare providers in 
those areas are literally struggling to 
survive. They are looking to Wash-
ington for a helping hand. Do you know 
what it means to smalltown America 
to lose a hospital? It is devastating, 
not 
only 
from 
the 
viewpoint 
of 
healthcare and emergency care, which 
is unavailable on a timely basis in 
many places, but also because it is 
hard to keep a business or attract a 
business if you don’t have quality 
healthcare nearby. Many of those hos-
pitals are struggling to keep the lights 
on and survive, and they will not make 
it unless we step up. 
So what is included in the Repub-
lican proposal when it comes to these 
healthcare 
providers, 
to 
increasing 
Medicaid assistance to them, for exam-
ple? Virtually nothing. I can’t under-
stand this. I have to believe that the 
Republican 
leadership 
representing 
States with small towns and rural pop-
ulations are hearing exactly what I am 
hearing in downstate Illinois. Yet, 
when it comes to a proposal on the 
floor, they are doing nothing—nothing. 
Let me just add, in closing here, if we 
don’t take testing seriously in Amer-
ica, we cannot be serious about reopen-
ing the economy, reopening schools, 
from colleges to kindergartens. That is 
the reality, to be able to test in an ef-
fective, cost-effective way people who 
are positive for this virus so that they 
are notified and stop from circulating 
among those who are, at that point, 
healthy. 
The testing investment by this bill 
on the Republican side doesn’t meet 
the challenge at all. They can’t call for 
opening the economy on one hand and 
ignore the responsibility for testing on 
another. 
So where do we go from here? Well, 
tomorrow is a symbolic, partisan vote 
on the Republican side when it should 
be much more. After it is finished and 
we know the outcome, perhaps then 
the Republican leader in the Senate 
will be willing to sit down and nego-
tiate. Will he be willing to occupy that 
empty chair in that negotiating room 
with the White House and Democratic 
congressional leaders? Will he be will-
ing to sit down and actually work on a 
compromise comparable to the CARES 
Act that passed here in March, earlier 
this year? 
That is what it takes—not a speech 
on the floor, not a press release, not a 
symbolic vote but something much 
more significant: the willingness to sit 
down and acknowledge the obvious; 
that America is heading in the wrong 
direction, and we should be heading in 
the right direction. 
Many people worry that the worst is 
yet to come. We want them to be more 
hopeful and optimistic because we 
care, and if both parties do care to help 
the unemployed, to help businesses, to 
make sure that our healthcare pro-
viders have the resources that they 
need, then we can start to address this 
coronavirus, this pandemic, with the 
leadership that has been so lacking in 
the months that we have faced it this 
year. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip is recognized. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, start-
ing this week and tomorrow, there will 
be a vote on a coronavirus relief bill, 
and it is a bill that is targeted to the 
areas that really need it, it is fiscally 
responsible, and it is rooted in reality. 
In other words, it is a realistic ap-
proach to dealing with the coronavirus 
challenges that we, as a nation, are 
facing. 
The 
Democratic 
leader 
and 
the 
Democratic assistant leader have been 
down here just now talking about the 
Democratic bill, a bill which passed the 
House of Representatives and a bill 
that was $31⁄2 trillion in terms of its 
pricetag and a bill that was filled with 
goodies for special-interest groups and 
lots of leftwing priorities, many of 
which have nothing to do at all with 
the coronavirus. 
In fact, $31⁄2 trillion is a number that 
I think was pulled out of thin air. I 
have no idea how they came up with it. 
I don’t think it was based on any feed-
back or input that they got from 
States or businesses around the coun-
try. I think it was let’s just make up as 
many things as we can and let’s just 
throw a lot of money out there and see 
what it does. 
Well, unfortunately, I think people 
have come to the realization—people 
around the country, at least—that 
every dollar that we spend now is a 
borrowed dollar. So the $31⁄2 trillion 
that was allocated by the House Demo-
crats and which has been supported 
just in the last few minutes here by the 
Democratic leader and the Democratic 
whip is borrowed money. It should 
come as no surprise to anybody in this 
country that our country already is 
deeply in debt. We added about $3 tril-
lion earlier this year when we passed 
the CARES package—at the time, 
something that was needed. We needed 
to be big and bold and move quickly, 
which we did. 
We have a much better sense now, I 
think, about this disease, what the 
needs are, and we ought to be targeting 
our assistance to those areas of great-
est need, whether it is small businesses 
that need assistance, that haven’t been 
able to reopen; whether it is in the area 
of healthcare, our hospitals and nurs-
ing homes, the provider community; or 
whether it is supporting the efforts 
that are being made to come up with 
vaccines and therapeutics, the money 
that is going into testing. Those are all 
things I think that there was pretty 
broad agreement on at the time. We 
still believe those are things that are 
essential, in addition to supporting our 
schools as they try to safely reopen. 
There are a number of priorities out 
there that I do think we have learned, 
gotten more information about, and de-
termined where the dollars made the 
most difference, what could be changed 
and modified in these programs to 
make them more workable, and that is 
what has led to the discussion we are 
having now and the bill that we will 
vote on tomorrow. 
What the Democrats, in their bill— 
the $31⁄2 trillion bill—did was they just 
decided that money is no object and 
evidently without, again, much consid-
eration about how those dollars are 
spent or in any way making sure that 
they are targeted to the right area, to 
those areas of greatest need, just basi-
cally decided to kind of throw caution 
to the wind and throw $31⁄2 trillion out 
there at the economy. 
The ironic thing about it, in many 
respects, is that, without having feed-
back or input, for example, from State 
and local governments about how much 
they needed, they put another $1 tril-
lion into that bill—$1 trillion for State 
and local governments—at a time when 
very little of the $150 billion that we 
had already done in direct assistance, 
not to mention the additional assist-
ance to States, to education, to col-
leges and universities, elementary and 
secondary education, healthcare pro-
viders—a lot of additional dollars have 
gone through the States, to the tune of 
about a half a trillion dollars already, 
much of which hasn’t been spent. In 
fact, of the $150 billion in direct assist-
ance that went out to State and local 
governments—the latest numbers I had 
as recently as about a week ago—only 
about a quarter of that, about 25 per-
cent of that money had been spent. Yet 
they were asking for another trillion 
dollars, every single dollar of which is 
borrowed. 
It was just reported recently that, in 
2021, the United States will exceed 100 
percent debt to GDP. That puts us in 
the elite and rare company of Italy, 
Greece, Japan, countries around the 
world that have gotten dramatically 
overextended when it comes to their 
sovereign debt. When you get to the 
debt to GDP which is in excess of 100 
percent, that is pretty dangerous terri-
tory. 
Everybody says we are the best econ-
omy in the world, we are the world’s 
reserve currency, and people are going 
to continue to want to invest here in 
the United States. Well, at some point 
there are consequences. The chickens 
do come home to roost. You cannot 
continue to borrow without eventual 
consequence. At some point, interest 
rates will start to normalize, at which 
time these countries that invest in the 
United States are going to demand a 
higher return. Interest rates—when 
they go up, it means the amount we 
have to pay to borrow money goes up, 
and when our interest gets north of $1 
trillion, it will exceed every other item 
in our budget, including the amount 
that we spend for national security. 
So that is the other part of the de-
bate which the other side never ref-
erences; that is, what are we doing to 
the long-term future of this country, to 
our children and grandchildren, all of 
whom are going to be responsible for 
this debt? We are essentially doing ev-
erything we do right now—putting it

on the credit card and handing the bill 
to our children and grandchildren— 
which is to say that the Republicans 
believe 
that 
we 
ought 
to 
do 
coronavirus relief and help those who 
need it. I am going to talk in just a 
moment about all the things that this 
bill does to help those who really need 
the help, but it ought to be targeted. It 
ought to be with some thought toward 
what is the greatest need? where can 
we make the biggest difference? where 
can we help the people who are really 
struggling and really hurting as a re-
sult of the virus, the pandemic? And we 
ought to do it in a fiscally responsible 
way. We ought to do it in a realistic 
way. We ought to have a bill that is, 
frankly, rooted in reality. 
The reason I say that the Democratic 
bill isn’t rooted in reality is because of 
many of the things that it contained. 
In fact, there were more mentions of 
the word ‘‘cannabis’’ in the Democratic 
bill than there were mentions of the 
word ‘‘jobs’’—more mentions of the 
word ‘‘cannabis,’’ a synonym for mari-
juana, than mentions of the word 
‘‘jobs.’’ 
So if you think about that, the 58 
mentions in the Democratic $31⁄2 tril-
lion bill had to do, for example, with 
diversity training. This was a study 
that was requested—I shouldn’t say 
‘‘diversity training’’ but a diversity 
study in the access to financing for 
people who are in the marijuana busi-
ness. That was something that was de-
termined a priority and funded in the 
Democratic-passed bill. 
Now, that is just one of many exam-
ples of why that bill wasn’t taken seri-
ously by anyone. When I say ‘‘anyone,’’ 
I am talking about the New York 
Times. The New York Times called it a 
messaging document and not a viable 
piece of legislation. The New York 
Times called it a messaging document 
and not a viable piece of legislation. 
National Public Radio said that it was 
a wish list—a Democratic wish list—of 
favored policies. POLITICO called it a 
long wish list of Democratic policies. 
Nobody—nobody took the Democratic 
bill seriously. When you can’t get the 
New York Times to speak favorably 
about a Democratic coronavirus relief 
bill, it tells me that it was completely 
out of step and out of touch with what 
is really needed in this country and, 
certainly, by the people in this country 
who do want to see us respond but re-
spond in a way—again, as I said—that 
is targeted and is fiscally responsible 
and doesn’t throw any kind of fiscal 
caution to the wind, that just throws 
money out there at a lot of favored pet 
causes and ideological agenda items on 
the Democratic wish list. That is es-
sentially what that bill did. 
So as we decided to put together a 
bill, we listened carefully. We listened 
to small businesses. We listened to 
healthcare providers. We listened to 
schools, to school administrators. We 
listened to those folks who are im-
pacted on a daily basis by the effects of 
this pandemic and what is really need-
ed, where are those greatest needs, 
where can we make the biggest dif-
ference. 
This is, again, the focus of the Re-
publican bill that we will be voting on 
tomorrow, which, contrary to the as-
sertions that were made by the Demo-
cratic leader, does include a lot of bi-
partisan policy and bipartisan coopera-
tion. Many of the provisions in the bill 
are provisions that share Democratic 
cosponsorship. In fact, I would point 
out that the changes we made to the 
PPP 
program—the 
PPP 
program, 
which is an acronym for the Paycheck 
Protection Program, is one of the most 
successful of all the programs in the 
CARES Act that passed earlier this 
year. It was a very bipartisan effort 
shared with people like MARCO RUBIO 
and SUSAN COLLINS on our side and BEN 
CARDIN and JEANNE SHAHEEN on the 
Democratic side and others involved in 
shaping that program, making it effec-
tive. Subsequent to that, changes made 
it work even better, and this will in-
clude some changes that we think will 
make it work even better. 
There are some in here that I, frank-
ly, was very supportive of because they 
will help people who, under the last 
Paycheck Protection Program, didn’t 
receive help because, for one reason or 
another, they were excluded from the 
qualifications to make them eligible 
for it. 
It makes changes in the Paycheck 
Protection Program, many of which— 
again, this is a bipartisan program— 
will be bipartisan in nature. There 
were a number of things that the lead-
er mentioned over here this morning 
earlier when he was on the floor in 
which he talked about some of the pro-
visions that Senator ALEXANDER had 
added. There are things in that space 
that, again, share bipartisan support. 
So if you look at this bill, in many re-
spects the Democrats are also saying 
that we need to do more to help our 
schools open safely, and this legisla-
tion does that. There is significant 
funding in here that actually helps 
out—makes sure that our schools, our 
administrators, our school boards, our 
students, our parents are assisted in a 
way that would see that our schools 
open safely and get our children back 
to where they can be learning again at 
the fastest rate possible. 
Those are, again, some of the prior-
ities that were in this legislation. I 
would add, because I think it is really 
worthwhile noting, that one of the pro-
visions in this bill does take dollars 
from the CARES Act that have not 
been spent and, frankly, may not be 
spent and repurposes them so that the 
cost of this particular piece of legisla-
tion is reduced—something, again, that 
I think is important. I think it is im-
portant to the American people and it 
is important to our kids and grandkids 
as we look at the pricetags we have 
been talking about—the $3 trillion that 
was done earlier this year, and what we 
might do here—that we do it in a way 
that is fiscally responsible, with con-
sideration and an eye toward ensuring 
that the taxpayers are getting the best 
return on their dollars and that we are 
being good stewards of the American 
tax dollars and spending in a way that 
makes sense and doesn’t just throw 
money out there, which, again, is what 
I would argue the $3.5 trillion bill pro-
posed by the House Democrats did—a 
bill which, again, was roundly de-
nounced not just by Republicans or 
conservatives but by entities like the 
New York Times. 
I want to speak very briefly about 
what is happening out there—why I 
think this bill and this vote is impor-
tant and why I believe it addresses the 
real needs, based on the input that we 
have received from the people out 
there who have been adversely im-
pacted by this. 
The good news is we are hearing con-
tinually improving numbers on the 
economy—as recently as last Friday. 
The economy added 1.4 million jobs in 
August, and the unemployment rate 
fell again to 8.4 percent. 
Let me just be clear: 8.4 percent is 
not where we want to be. But it is a 
tremendous improvement from where 
we were just 4 months ago, near the be-
ginning of the pandemic when the un-
employment rate was at 14.7 percent. It 
is very encouraging to see the economy 
rebounding so quickly. 
The last time America went through 
a really tough time economically—dur-
ing the first few years of the Obama- 
Biden administration—unemployment 
stayed high for years. In fact, during 
the 
Obama-Biden 
administration, 
America went through 2 solid years of 
unemployment that was above 9 per-
cent. 
It has been great to see the economy 
rebounding at a rapid pace. Again, we 
are still a long way from where we need 
to be and where we want to be; 8.4 per-
cent is not an acceptable unemploy-
ment rate. But we are definitely on the 
right track. 
One of the reasons our economy is re-
bounding quickly is that the economy 
was thriving before COVID came along. 
Republican tax reform and pro-growth 
policies 
had 
driven 
unemployment 
below 4 percent and created jobs and 
opportunities for millions of Ameri-
cans. Having the economy in a healthy 
position pre-COVID laid the ground-
work for a strong recovery. The poli-
cies we put in place during the early 
years in the pandemic to help busi-
nesses—particularly small businesses— 
survive the pandemic and keep workers 
on the payroll have gone a long way to-
ward helping our economy rebound. 
Republicans are committed to build-
ing on those policies, but as everyone 
knows, Democrats have so far blocked 
our efforts. Despite weeks of negoti-
ating efforts from Republicans, Demo-
crats refused to budge from their de-
mands for a giant bill that would spend 
an irresponsible amount of taxpayer 
money and include a bunch of measures 
with no relation to the coronavirus cri-
sis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5485 
September 9, 2020 
This week, Republicans are trying 
again. We have introduced a targeted 
bill focused on a few key coronavirus 
priorities—like helping the hardest hit 
small businesses, getting kids and col-
lege students back to school, and pro-
viding additional healthcare resources 
to fight the virus. 
As I mentioned earlier, the Paycheck 
Protection Program, a program Con-
gress passed as part of the CARES Act 
back in March, has played a key role in 
helping small businesses survive the 
pandemic. 
The legislation we have introduced 
would authorize a second round of for-
givable Paycheck Protection Program 
loans for the hardest hit small busi-
nesses but would also simplify the loan 
forgiveness process for small businesses 
with Paycheck Protection Program 
loans of $150,000 or less. Again, I would 
point out that this program, these 
changes, share bipartisan support. 
The virus has highlighted how much 
we rely on our Nation’s farmers and 
ranchers, and I am pleased our legisla-
tion includes an additional $20 billion 
in funding to allow the Department of 
Agriculture to continue to assist ag 
producers—again, a bipartisan priority. 
Our legislation would also provide for 
an additional $300 per week—over and 
above 
unemployment 
benefits—for 
those who have lost their jobs as a re-
sult of the pandemic. 
Our bill contains another important 
measure to help keep our recovery 
going and to protect jobs, and that is 
liability protection. 
No matter how many precautions 
schools, hospitals, and businesses take, 
there is no way—no way—for them to 
completely eliminate all risk of em-
ployees, students, or customers con-
tracting the virus. But that doesn’t 
matter to the army of trial lawyers 
itching to levy lawsuits against even 
the most careful schools and busi-
nesses. I don’t need to tell anybody 
that saddling businesses large and 
small with a bunch of frivolous law-
suits could seriously hamstring our 
economic recovery. 
There is no question that schools and 
businesses should be liable for gross 
negligence or for intentional mis-
conduct. But businesses and schools 
that are taking every reasonable pre-
caution to protect employees and stu-
dents should not have to worry about 
facing lawsuits for virus transmission 
that they could not have prevented. 
In addition to providing schools with 
liability protections, our bill focuses 
on providing schools with the resources 
they need to get kids and teachers 
back in classrooms safely. Our bill 
would help expand the educational op-
tions that parents have for their chil-
dren. And it would provide increased 
funding for childcare during this crisis 
so that parents who are trying to get 
back to work have a safe place to send 
their kids. 
Finally, our bill would provide more 
money for coronavirus testing and 
tracing and for the development of the 
therapies and vaccines we need to de-
feat this virus. And it would focus on 
building up State and national stock-
piles of the medical resources needed 
for public health emergencies like the 
coronavirus. 
I would like to think that Democrats 
would work with us to get a version of 
our legislation passed this week. While 
this bill may not address every current 
or future coronavirus need, it would go 
a long way toward helping with our 
most pressing needs—supporting jobs, 
getting kids and teachers back to 
school, and ensuring that we have the 
medical resources necessary to fight 
the virus. 
Unfortunately, it has become very 
clear that Democrats are more inter-
ested in keeping the coronavirus as a 
political issue than in actually fighting 
the virus. If Democrats were serious 
about coronavirus relief, they would be 
willing to negotiate with Republicans 
to arrive at a bill that both sides could 
agree to and that could actually pass 
Congress. But they have made it very 
clear that reasonable negotiations are 
off the table. Instead, they are content 
to see Americans suffer or our eco-
nomic recovery slow in the hopes that 
they will be able to use the coronavirus 
as a political issue in the November 
elections. 
It is disappointing, but it is not going 
to stop Republicans from continuing to 
try to pass coronavirus relief legisla-
tion. The American people are depend-
ing on us, and we are going to do every-
thing we can not to let them down. 
I hope that at least some Democrats 
will decide that they should join us. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the 
last several months, Texans have found 
new and creative ways to connect with 
one another while following the nec-
essary COVID–19 precautions—things 
like drive-through birthday parties, 
live-streamed weddings, virtual family 
reunions, and socially distanced bar-
becues. Life looks a lot different today 
than it did at the start of the year, but 
despite the challenges we face, we 
know it is unrealistic to hit the pause 
button until the pandemic subsides. 
While COVID–19 continues to be ever 
present in our daily lives, folks across 
my State are safely adapting their rou-
tines, and that certainly has been my 
objective in the Senate. Over the past 
few months, I, like many of my col-
leagues—maybe all of my colleagues— 
have largely replaced in-person con-
versations with virtual ones, through 
more than 150 separate calls with 
groups across the State of Texas. These 
virtual conversations continued over 
the month of August, along with a 
number of socially distanced events 
complete with all of the CDC pre-
cautions. Close communication with 
my constituents has always been im-
portant, and the COVID pandemic has 
made these conversations even more 
critical. 
During August, I spent time hearing 
from my constituents, learning about 
their challenges and what they need in 
the way of additional help. I donned 
my mask—like we all have—to safely 
meet 
with 
city 
leaders, 
teachers, 
healthcare heroes, food bank workers, 
and others across the State. I contin-
ued to join telephone and video calls 
with Texans whose routines and liveli-
hoods have been disrupted by the pan-
demic. 
It actually was an exhilarating op-
portunity to get out from behind my 
computer screen and to share informa-
tion about the coronavirus relief bills 
that we have passed thus far but to 
learn also, just as significantly, where 
those bills were working and where 
more needed to be done. As the Senate 
prepares to vote on a targeted relief 
bill tomorrow, these discussions could 
not have been more timely. 
I also hosted recently four telephone 
townhalls 
with 
constituents 
across 
Texas. This is amazing technology, as 
the Presiding Officer knows, where you 
can reach out to a quarter of a million 
people just in an hour-long phone call 
and give them a chance to express their 
views or ask questions. 
I heard from parents who are con-
cerned about the start of the school 
year; small business owners who are 
trying to stay afloat, not knowing 
when all of this will end; and a woman 
in rural Texas who is worried that if 
the U.S. Postal Service goes under, she 
will not be able to receive her medica-
tion in the mail. 
This is a difficult time for many of 
our neighbors, and I was glad to share 
the information about the resources we 
provided and to answer questions about 
what Texans might be able to expect in 
the next relief bill. 
One of the most commonly asked 
questions was about unemployment in-
surance. Since March, more than 3.4 
million Texans have filed for unem-
ployment 
compensation, 
and 
many 
were able to take advantage of the 
extra $600 a week in Federal benefits 
provided by the CARES Act. But that 
extra funding expired at the end of 
July, leaving many Texans who were 
still unable to return to work without 
the income they need to support their 
families. 
Despite our repeated efforts, Con-
gress has been unable and unwilling to 
come up with an agreement on unem-
ployment benefits before the month of 
August. As a gap-filler, the President 
issued an Executive order to provide an 
extra $300 a week in benefits, which 
Texans have received. This is good 
news for those who came to rely on 
these bolstered benefits, but, unfortu-
nately, it doesn’t help them with the 
same level of certainty that congres-
sional legislation would provide. The 
next relief bill must provide those who 
are still without a way to earn a pay-
check the additional benefits they need 
to replace their income. 
It is important that we agree to an 
amount or a formula that doesn’t

September 9, 2020 
hinder our economic recovery or per-
versely incentivize people not to go 
back to work safely. Over the last 
month, I have heard from a number of 
employers who had trouble rehiring 
workers because in some cases their 
workers were earning more with the 
additional $600 benefit than they would 
from working. Well, it just doesn’t 
make any sense to incentivize people 
not to go back to work when they can 
safely do so. We need to strike a deli-
cate balance that gives them the re-
sources they need to support their fam-
ily without incentivizing them to stay 
home. 
As businesses have reopened and em-
ployees returned to work, Texas has 
made serious progress in getting more 
folks back on the payroll. The State 
unemployment rate has steadily de-
clined from a peak of 13.5 percent to 8 
percent in July. Obviously, that is still 
way too high and a far cry from the 3.5 
percent we saw pre-COVID. If we are 
going to keep working and moving in 
the right direction, we need to have 
our workers return to work when that 
becomes an option. Obviously it goes 
without saying that they would be able 
to safely return. 
Of course, it is not enough to just 
give people the resources they need to 
support their families; we also need to 
ensure they have jobs to return to. 
That is why the Paycheck Protection 
Program has been so vital and has 
saved countless jobs since it was estab-
lished in March through the CARES 
Act. So far, Congress has invested $670 
billion in this job-saving program, and 
I am glad to say that Texas has re-
ceived more than $41 billion across 
more than 417,000 individual loans. It 
has literally been a lifesaver for many 
of these small businesses. I hope the 
next relief bill will provide an oppor-
tunity for the hardest hit businesses to 
receive a second PPP loan and save 
even more jobs and small businesses in 
communities not just across my State 
but across the United States. 
Our State also has a vibrant arts and 
culture scene, and some of the hardest 
hit businesses are live-event venues. 
These were actually some of the first 
to close when the pandemic hit, and 
they will be the last to reopen. Unlike 
restaurants or retailers, which were 
able to switch to curbside or pickup de-
livery, event venues don’t offer a serv-
ice that can be tailored to meet the 
CDC guidelines. 
The experience of a concert at the 
Lowbrow Palace in El Paso or a trip to 
hear the symphony at the Meyerson in 
Dallas isn’t the same through a com-
puter screen. That leaves no oppor-
tunity for live venue operators, pro-
moters, producers, and talent rep-
resentatives to organize events and no 
chance for security guards, ticket tak-
ers, bartenders, or cleanup crews to 
earn a paycheck. 
These venues are not only a special 
part of our culture and our commu-
nities, they are also major employers 
and fuel our economic engine. Pro-
viding relief for these venues is an im-
portant way to protect our local econo-
mies, jobs, and beloved cultural insti-
tutions. That is why I introduced the 
Save our Stages Act with Senator KLO-
BUCHAR, our colleague from Minnesota. 
It would establish a $10 billion grant 
program to give independent venues 
and their employees the funding they 
need to survive this pandemic. We are 
not talking about huge, publicly trad-
ed, multinational corporations here. In 
order to be eligible, recipients must 
have fewer than 500 employees and 
can’t be publicly traded. They can use 
the money to cover payroll and bene-
fits, as well as rent, utilities, and other 
expenses to stay afloat. As the Senate 
continues 
to 
work 
on 
our 
next 
coronavirus relief bill, I hope the Save 
Our Stages provision will be included. 
Our economy in Texas, like the rest 
of the country, is moving in a more 
positive direction. We want to keep it 
this way. We need to do everything we 
can to ensure that once the pandemic 
is contained, our cultural institutions, 
our businesses, and our jobs that we 
rely on will be ready to bounce back. I 
appreciate the countless Texans who 
shared with me their feedback and 
ideas on how Congress can do more to 
support our State and our country 
through this crisis. I am going to do 
my part to keep fighting to enact these 
ideas into law and give Texans the sup-
port they deserve.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
for the past several weeks I have had 
the opportunity to be able to travel 
around the great State of Oklahoma. I 
have literally been from Guymon to 
Talihina, to Bartlesville, to Lawton to 
cover as much space as I could and talk 
to as many people as I could. 
Obviously, we were in smaller groups, 
with masks and social distancing and 
doing all the things we could to take 
care of each other, but taking the mo-
ment to meet with school superintend-
ents, parents, teachers, healthcare pro-
viders and hospital administrators, 
small business owners and employees 
of large and small businesses, not-for- 
profits and their volunteers, law en-
forcement individuals, city managers, 
mayors, city councilmen, State leader-
ship. 
I wanted to hear what was happening 
on the ground in my State in order to 
know what needs to be addressed be-
cause there has been a lot of noise in 
Washington, DC, about what needs to 
be done on COVID. 
There are many people in the na-
tional press who are struck by the fact 
that $3 trillion has already been allo-
cated to deal with COVID–19 and a tre-
mendous number of changes have al-
ready occurred. But in this town there 
are a significant number of people who 
say: We just spent $3 trillion. That was 
fun. Let’s do it all over again and see 
how we can spend even more. 
My focus has been very simple: What 
is needed to be able to beat the virus? 
What I heard all over Oklahoma wasn’t 
‘‘Go do more; just spend more and cre-
ate new programs’’ but ‘‘How can we 
beat this virus back so that we can ac-
tually get to a moment where we can 
function again economically as a na-
tion?’’ 
People are returning to work, but 
they are asking very basic questions. 
The first of those is ‘‘This is a health 
crisis. What do we do?’’ 
The bill that has just been released, 
which we are voting on in the Senate 
tomorrow, has a whole series of issues 
tailored to actually work on beating 
the virus back and getting our econ-
omy going and helping to protect our 
families. That is the design of this. It 
is not just doing something; it is trying 
to do the right things to actually help 
us get through this and get to the 
other side, starting with money for 
testing—not just additional testing but 
new types of testing to make sure that 
we have even faster tests out there and 
that we have more testing that actu-
ally addresses the issue of how we can 
do it on-site, get an accurate result, 
and not wait weeks. While we literally 
have millions of tests that have been 
done, we have some tests that take a 
long time to get back. In March, we 
were dealing with ‘‘Let’s get a test,’’

September 9, 2020 
and now we are dealing with ‘‘Let’s get 
a faster test.’’ That is a lot of the focus 
of the funding here: faster testing. 
On vaccines, there are six vaccines 
right now that are in human trials or 
that are approaching human trials, 
which is remarkable, thinking about 
the history of vaccines and how long it 
has taken. But there was a significant 
amount of money invested in this in 
February and March in previous bills 
to be able to fast-track the research, 
and that has made a difference. Now it 
is a matter of moving it from the re-
search phase to trials to actually im-
plementing it nationwide. So there is 
significant money for testing, for vac-
cines, and for treatments. 
Secondly, how do we get our schools 
open again? I heard over and over again 
from 
parents, 
administrators, 
and 
teachers: We want to get our schools 
open again—public, private, charter, 
online, whatever it may be. Those par-
ents who are taxpayers and individ-
uals—regardless of where they choose 
to send their child to school or if they 
choose to keep their child at home for 
school—want to know what is going to 
be done to help our kids get educated. 
While the vast majority of funding and 
authority for education is in the 
States, there is a Federal connection 
here that we should be able to help, es-
pecially kids with special needs. They 
have unique challenges during this 
time of COVID–19, and we need to be 
able to get those kids back in school 
and get them the additional care they 
need during this time period. 
What all parents are saying to me is 
this: I want the best possible moment. 
I do not want my kid being written off 
for the future because someone didn’t 
choose to invest in them now. 
This bill has $105 billion toward edu-
cation—public, 
private, 
charter, 
homeschool. It has tax credits built in 
to assist parents to be able to choose 
where they want their kids to go. It 
has the ability for more schools to go 
online to help through this season. It 
has additional dollars to be used for 
transportation because many school 
districts are doing multiple bus routes 
to keep down the number of people on 
individual buses. All of those things 
are helpful. We want to help get our 
kids back in school and make sure that 
this is successful. 
During this moment, it has been in-
teresting. As I talked to many super-
intendents and educators, they all said 
to me the same thing: We are working 
hard to get our kids back to class and 
to do the things they need to do. 
Then they would pause and say: For 
years we have talked about innovation 
in education, but we have been stuck 
doing the same thing over and over 
again and have been frustrated with 
the results. This pandemic has forced 
us to innovate in education in ways 
that we only dreamed about years ago. 
We need to be prepared during this sea-
son not only to continue to educate our 
kids in the best way possible but to 
take notes on the best innovations 
across the country in education be-
cause we have said as a nation that we 
need to be stronger in how we are edu-
cating our kids and the end product of 
that and how we are preparing them 
for the workforce. This is that moment 
we should pay attention to, as well, in 
the education innovations that are ac-
tually going on in my State and in 
many States around the country. 
There is money in this, as well, for 
childcare. This has been an interesting 
challenge. Childcare facilities have 
fewer people who are actually allowed 
to be there—the children who are able 
to be there—but the profit margin 
doesn’t work for them to have all those 
employees and fewer children. We want 
them to be able to be there and be suc-
cessful and survive this, so we added 
additional dollars for childcare. 
We have additional dollars for ag be-
cause in some areas of agriculture 
across the country, they have done 
very well, but some have really strug-
gled. If we all want to be able to eat at 
the end of this, we better make sure 
that ag survives and thrives through 
this. 
I met with a lot of small business 
leaders and heard a lot of different con-
versations. They were very appre-
ciative of the Paycheck Protection 
Program. In my State, 61,000 small 
businesses and not-for-profits took ad-
vantage of the Paycheck Protection 
Program, and many of them told me 
that they would not be open today if it 
weren’t for that. They are grateful this 
body came together to deal with the 
Paycheck Protection Program because 
it made a difference in my State and 
many other States around the country. 
The bill we are putting on the floor 
on Thursday deals specifically with the 
next round of paycheck protection, 
limiting it to the hardest hit small 
businesses and nonprofits, those that 
have had the largest amount of revenue 
loss and that are the smallest of busi-
nesses. We need them to be able to sur-
vive through this. Nothing is going to 
make them whole, and the goal of this 
shouldn’t be to make every business 
whole. We can’t financially sustain 
that as a country, but we can try to get 
people through this and get to the 
other side of it. 
We are all going to have to innovate. 
Most of the small businesses that I 
talked to told me about the innova-
tions they were doing and how they 
used to do business one way, and, with-
in 36 hours, they figured out a way to 
do it a different way. That is the Amer-
ican system. That is free market and 
capitalism at their best—that at the 
moment of struggle, you can go inno-
vate and do things different and be suc-
cessful with that. That is what we have 
to continue to protect—not too much 
government oversight and control of 
everything that, in the days and mo-
ments where we have to innovate, peo-
ple can’t innovate because they have so 
much government mandates on them. 
I was grateful to the Trump adminis-
tration for how much flexibility they 
gave to the process, not only to waiv-
ers for child lunches through the 
schools and flexibility there, but flexi-
bility for businesses to be able to inno-
vate in a very difficult moment. 
We will need another round—a small-
er round, but another round—for the 
hardest hit businesses for the Pay-
check Protection Program. Our not- 
for-profits told me over and over how 
much work they are doing during this 
time period. We need to make sure 
those not-for-profits not only survive it 
but thrive. 
As I have said to this body before, we 
have three safety nets in America: the 
family; churches, not-for-profits, and 
faith-based institutions; and then gov-
ernment is third. A lot of people look 
at our safety net as being all the gov-
ernment programs, but that is the last 
in this cycle. If our families aren’t 
strong, then individuals struggle. If our 
faith-based entities and our not-for- 
profits that take care of so much 
human need are not strong and thriv-
ing and those volunteers aren’t en-
gaged, there is no way the government 
can keep up with the issues. 
So just keeping not-for-profits open 
can’t be the goal for this. We have to 
keep them thriving. Those not-for-prof-
its around the country are taking care 
of the homeless, the hungry, and the 
hurting, and we need to find ways to 
strengthen them. The best way to do 
that is not to have some government 
program to establish the best way to 
identify good not-for-profits. The best 
way to do that is to allow the Amer-
ican people to look at what is working 
in their neighborhoods and their com-
munities, because they will invest 
their own dollars to do that. 
In the CARES Act, I pushed for and 
we got a $300 write-off on your taxes if 
every American will give $300 to the 
not-for-profit of their choice. In this 
proposal, that doubles for the individ-
uals and quadruples for the family. 
This is a $600 tax write-off for an indi-
vidual or a $1,200 tax write-off for a 
family if they will donate to a not-for- 
profit. 
Why do we choose to do that? Be-
cause not-for-profits are way more effi-
cient at taking care of human need 
than the government is and because 
they have a face. They are interacting 
with a family. They are interacting 
with an individual directly. They are 
not dealing with someone on the phone 
or online. It is not a check that you re-
ceive or a form that you fill out. It is 
a person that you meet with face to 
face who says: How can I help you? And 
it is a volunteer that will walk through 
life with you. 
Those 
faith-based 
ministries 
and 
those secular and other not-for-profits 
out there are making an enormous dif-
ference, and the best thing that we can 
do to make sure they thrive in this mo-
ment 
is 
to 
make 
sure 
that 
we 
incentivize individuals that give to 
them by saying: You can give this to 
Uncle Sam or you can give this to a 
local charity of your choice. Either

way, it is going to strengthen individ-
uals. Go engage with that. 
That is in this bill, and it is impor-
tant that we continue to walk along-
side them and all of those not-for-prof-
its to make sure they thrive because 
we need them thriving, not just sur-
viving in this moment. 
There is one other thing that I want 
to identify. There are a lot of things 
that are in this bill. It is liability pro-
tections. Businesses and universities in 
my State said: We desperately need the 
Federal Government to clarify liability 
protections. 
Now, there have been individuals on 
the other side of the aisle that have 
said: We don’t want to do that. We 
want to just leave that up to the law-
yers in the days ahead who have law-
suits. What is occurring is there are 
many businesses in my State that are 
holding back and many schools in my 
State that are holding back trying to 
figure out what happens next for fear 
of what could be a series of lawsuits. 
They just want clarity. They want to 
do business where they can protect 
their employees, protect the customers 
or individuals or students that are 
there that are around them, but they 
also want to be able to operate and 
function again, and they don’t feel like 
they can do that without basic liability 
protections and liability definitions. 
This bill provides that. 
Now, I have heard some in the media 
and some even in this building who 
have said this is a pared-down skinny 
bill. Only in Washington, DC, is a $300 
billion piece of legislation considered 
skinny—only here. Over and over again 
at home, when I talk to people across 
the State of Oklahoma and I would 
present what has already been done in 
the previous acts—the $3 trillion that 
have already been spent on COVID in 
the months before and the proposals 
that we have now—they would quietly 
pull me aside at the end of the meeting 
and they would say almost exactly the 
same thing: Where is this money com-
ing from? 
People are worried about the virus, 
but they are also worried about what is 
coming next. People are used to taking 
out a loan if there is a major storm or 
a major life event, knowing I have to 
take this loan out to get through it, 
but they also realize that for every 
loan they take out, they have to pay 
that back. The people in my State are 
saying the same thing: Where is this 
money coming from? How are we ever 
going to pay it back? And they are 
shocked that the House of Representa-
tives and many in this room are push-
ing a bill that is $3.5 trillion in spend-
ing on top of the $3 trillion that was al-
ready spent earlier this year, and they 
just gasp when they think about an ad-
ditional $6.5 trillion of deficit in a sin-
gle year. They wonder what happens 
with that, and I respond to them: So do 
I. That is why we are trying to be as 
tailored and as focused as we can pos-
sibly be to meet the needs that need to 
be done but to not just throw a big 
number out and to say we have to go 
big. We already have gone big earlier 
this year. 
Now, it is not just ‘‘can we throw 
money out the door from Washington, 
DC,’’ but it is ‘‘what do we have to do 
to get to the other side of this for our 
health, for our students, for the basic 
operations of our economy and survival 
to be able to get on the other side of 
this,’’ because on the other side of this 
is a bill that has to be paid. 
We, in this body, should pay atten-
tion to that because, certainly, the 
people in Oklahoma are paying atten-
tion to that and so should we. There 
are things that need to be done, and I 
look forward to bringing this up to be 
able to focus on the essential things 
that need to be done for our economy 
right now and be able to keep moving 
from there.

COVID–19 VACCINE 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
this morning, our Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee had a 
hearing, and one of the members came 
up to me on the floor and said: That 
was the most civil hearing I have at-
tended in the Senate in a while. The 
truth is that most of our hearings in 
the Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee are civil. We have 
Senators of widely different points of 
view. 
I thank Senator MURRAY, the Sen-
ator from Washington State, who is the 
ranking member of our committee and 
a member of the Democratic leader-
ship, for the way that she and the 
Democratic members of the committee 
worked with the Republican members 
so that we can have the Surgeon Gen-
eral of the United States, Dr. Adams, 
and Dr. Francis Collins, the head of the 
National Institutes of Health, who is 
one of our country’s most esteemed sci-
entists and the man who headed the 
human genome project, there for 3 
hours and we can ask questions. Vir-
tually every Senator participated, and 
we got some good answers. 
I would like to report to the other 
members of the Senate about that 
hearing. I began it by saying: I have 
been rereading the book ‘‘Guns, Germs, 
and Steel,’’ a book by Jared Diamond, 
written in 1997, which is as relevant 
today—maybe more relevant today— 
than it was when he wrote it. 
Mr. Diamond, who won the Pulitzer 
Prize and is a professor of geography in 
California, said: There is nothing new 
about mass epidemics that causes 
deaths and social upheaval that we are 
witnessing today, and there is nothing 
new 
about 
where 
most 
of 
those 
epidemics in history have come from. 
Diseases that caused those deaths for 
the last 10,000 years, he says, have 
come mostly from animals that trans-
mit them to humans, and during most 
of history, there were three ways to 
deal with these epidemics. 
One was to isolate the infected, as in, 
for example, leper colonies to deal with 
leprosy. One was, according to Mr. Dia-
mond, that over thousands of years, 
there have been genetic changes in the 
human population in response to the 
infectious diseases that have gone 
through those populations, and they 
have produced a resistance to the infec-
tious diseases, as in the case of small-
pox. Of course, that didn’t do much to 
help the Native Americans in this 
country when European settlers, who 
had some resistance to smallpox, ar-
rived here and gave blankets to the Na-
tive Americans that were infected with 
smallpox or contained smallpox and 
wiped out 90 percent of the tribes who 
received them because they didn’t have 
that resistance. 
There is a third way of dealing with 
epidemics. Throughout most of history, 
the most common way was to let the 
epidemic run through the population 
until everyone had been either killed 
or recovered and developed some resist-
ance to the disease. Diamond says that 
the Black Death killed about one-third 
of Europe’s population between 1347 
and 1351 as it ran through the popu-
lation killing people. 
Now, what is new about dealing with 
epidemics is modern medicine. Modern 
medicine has given us ways to diagnose 
these diseases and to create treatments 
to make it easier to recover from these 
diseases, but the true miracle of mod-
ern medicine is the vaccine—a vaccine 
that can prevent humans from acquir-
ing the disease at all. The Senator 
from Tennessee and I have actually 
worked together on that issue 2 or 3 
years ago to encourage people, and, in 
her words, talk to your doctor if you 
have a concern about a vaccine. That is 
what we want to talk about today. 
Today, in all 50 States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia, school children are 
required to take vaccinations for a se-
ries of diseases—diphtheria, tetanus, 
whooping cough, measles, rubella, and 
chicken pox—before entering school. 
That vaccination will protect the 
child from getting the disease, which in 
turn prevents the child from infecting 
someone else—a pattern that eventu-
ally causes these diseases to disappear. 
Americans of my generation remem-
ber how polio terrified our parents in 
the early 1940s and into the 1950s. Many 
saw their children die of polio. When I 
was very young, I can remember class-
mates who were strapped into iron 
lungs so they could breathe and were 
destined to stay there for the rest of 
their lives. The lucky ones were like 
Majority Leader MITCH
MCCONNELL, 
who was left only with a limp after 
having polio in the 1940s. 
The disease terrified Americans until 
Dr. Jonas Salk discovered the polio

vaccine in 1955. After the vaccine was 
developed, the United States undertook 
a large-scale vaccination campaign, 
and polio was declared eradicated from 
the United States by 1979. 
The purpose of the hearing we had 
this morning was to explore the re-
markable progression that science is 
making toward a COVID–19 vaccine and 
to remind parents to have their chil-
dren get their childhood vaccinations 
and to encourage as many Americans 
as possible to take the flu vaccine this 
fall. 
First, 
the 
progress 
toward 
the 
COVID–19 vaccination—Dr. Collins, the 
Director of the National Institutes of 
Health, talked about that. He talked 
about the vaccine research and devel-
opment, 
including 
Operation 
Warp 
Speed, which is working to develop, 
manufacture, and distribute safe and 
effective vaccines as rapidly as pos-
sible. 
He told us there are six vaccines cur-
rently under development. He reminded 
us that the Federal Government, using 
taxpayers’ money, has helped accel-
erate this by providing money to man-
ufacture these vaccines before they are 
deemed safe and effective and that he 
does not necessarily expect all of the 
vaccines to work. And if they don’t 
work or if they are not safe, they will 
be thrown in the dumpster. They will 
not be distributed to anyone to use. 
He pointed out that AstraZeneca an-
nounced today that 1 person in its clin-
ical trial—which probably has 30,000 
people in the UK—had developed an ill-
ness and they had paused the trial. In 
other words, they stopped giving shots 
to the volunteers in the clinical trial 
until they could see whether the illness 
is related to the vaccine. 
Some people believe that Operation 
Warp Speed means cutting corners, but 
it does not. It refers to the extraor-
dinary investment in research, devel-
opment, and manufacturing scale-up 
for the COVID–19 vaccine. 
Perhaps most significantly, the Bio-
medical Advanced Research and Devel-
opment 
Authority—we 
call 
it 
BARDA—has taken the unprecedented 
step, as I mentioned earlier, to speed 
up manufacturing for hundreds of mil-
lions of doses early in the process by 
buying those doses in advance so they 
can be ready to distribute as soon as 
the vaccines are approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration. 
Several of our Senators on both sides 
of the aisle asked Dr. Collins and Dr. 
Adams, the Surgeon General, whether 
they intended to let politics play a role 
in the decision about whether a vaccine 
is safe and effective and ready for dis-
tribution. They answered absolutely 
no, that they would be no part of such 
a decision. 
The same has been said by Dr. Ste-
phen Hahn, who is the Commissioner of 
the FDA charged with making that 
judgement. ‘‘This is going to be a 
science, medicine, data decision,’’ he 
said. It ‘‘is not going to be a political 
decision.’’ That means if it is not safe, 
it will not be distributed. 
At the same time, the Centers for 
Disease Control is working on a plan to 
distribute the vaccine as soon as they 
are authorized or approved, prioritizing 
vaccines for healthcare workers and 
vulnerable populations. The CDC says 
its plan will be a fair system informed 
by nonpartisan health experts from the 
National Academies of Sciences, Engi-
neering, and others. 
Some have suggested—of course, this 
is a political season; we have an elec-
tion in 2 months—that the reason we 
are rushing, as a government, to create 
the vaccine is so it will help President 
Trump before the election in Novem-
ber, or that the reason the Centers for 
Disease Control said to the States: Get 
ready now to distribute the vaccine 
when it is effective and safe—that that 
is a political move. 
Of course, I said that if Dr. Collins 
and Dr. Adams had come in and said it 
would be 5 years before we had a vac-
cine, we would probably ask the Presi-
dent to fire them, because people are 
dying, and we need vaccines. We don’t 
want the alternative, which is to run 
the disease through millions of Ameri-
cans until everybody either dies or is 
infected and recovers, and we don’t 
want to have happen again what hap-
pened before with the H1N1 virus, 
where the vaccine was ready, but the 
States weren’t ready to distribute it. 
So we were pleased to see what the re-
sponse was. 
Americans 
are 
saying 
that 
they 
might not take the vaccine. The first 
question people ask is, Are they safe? 
They are safe because they are re-
viewed by the FDA, which is the gold 
standard for safety. Vaccines are rou-
tinely given to children. They are spe-
cifically recommended by an advisory 
commission that looks at it carefully, 
consisting of doctors and physicians 
and scientists. 
In a 2015 article for the Scientific 
American, a distinguished scientist 
wrote: 
By age two, most children will receive al-
most 30 shots designed to boost a child’s nat-
ural defenses against disease. Yet at the 
same time, parents who take their children 
for those recommended vaccinations might 
be inundated with Web site and celebrity-es-
poused rumors making false claims that 
shots are not necessary or cause autism. 
This distinguished scientist wrote: 
At best, navigating this landscape can be 
confusing. But when weighing the risks of 
encountering 
life-threatening 
disease 
against the benefits of receiving a vaccine 
there’s no contest. The vast majority of chil-
dren do not experience anything worse than 
short-lived redness or itching at the spot of 
the injection. 
I asked Dr. Collins this question, 
which I think is confusing to some peo-
ple: When you take the COVID vaccine, 
you don’t get COVID? There was a time 
in the old days when to get a smallpox 
vaccine, you, in fact, got a little small-
pox. But that is not what happens. As 
Dr. Collins explained it, he said the 
vaccine creates a sort of machine with-
in your body and your immune system 
to fight the COVID. It doesn’t infect 
you with the disease. 
Then there is the question about 
whether the vaccines are effective. I 
talked about how polio is now eradi-
cated. The number of polio cases since 
the vaccines has fallen rapidly to less 
than 100 in the 1960s and less than 10 in 
the 1970s thanks to the successful vac-
cination program. According to the 
Centers for Disease Control, the United 
States has been polio-free since 1979. 
Diphtheria was a terrifying prospect 
for parents in the 1920s, but according 
to the scientific agencies and the gov-
ernment, there are only a few of those 
a year. 
Then there is the concern about 
whether the doctor’s office is safe. I 
have heard that from people, but the 
studies have shown that the pediatri-
cians—and we heard that testimony 
today—have made great efforts to try 
to make their offices the safest places 
that a parent can go with their child in 
order to get a vaccination. 
Finally, I started my comments this 
morning with comments from Jared 
Diamond, and I concluded with a warn-
ing he wrote for the Wall Street Jour-
nal. He said in effect that the main 
thing that is different about this dis-
ease, COVID–19, is not that it is more 
infectious; the main thing that is dif-
ferent is the jet plane—the plane that 
can carry people all over the world, all 
over our country, spreading whatever 
the infection is. He said that as a re-
sult of that, the next pandemic could 
be next year. 
That is why I have introduced in the 
Senate legislation that would help pre-
pare for the next pandemic. It has sup-
port on all sides. Senator Frist from 
Tennessee, the former majority leader; 
Senator Daschle, the former majority 
leader on the Democratic side; many 
experts—all say we have a problem in 
this country going from panic to ne-
glect to panic. While we have taken 
some important steps, as Senator BURR 
pointed out today, to create the au-
thority for the government to build 
manufacturing 
plants, 
to 
manage 
stockpiles better, to be prepared for 
pandemics, as soon as the epidemic is 
over, we move on to something else. So 
the time to deal with the next pan-
demic is now. 
There is specific legislation to make 
sure that we sustain funding for on-
shore manufacturing so we are not re-
lying on China, India, and other coun-
tries to make our vaccines for the next 
pandemic. There is money to make 
sure that the stockpiles are filled with 
protective equipment so we don’t have 
the kinds of delays that some people 
experienced in this pandemic. 
Former Governor Mike Leavitt said 
to our committee that we have under-
funded public health for the last 30 to 
40 years, and when we underfund public 
health and the next pandemic comes, 
we are not as ready for it as we should 
be. 
Fortunately, thanks to an unprece-
dented effort by scientists around the 
world, preparation by Republican and 
Democratic administrations over the

last 20 years and several Congresses, we 
have done a lot to be well prepared for 
this pandemic, and we are moving more 
rapidly than we ever have to create 
new diagnostic tests, new treatments, 
and new vaccines. Some of the chal-
lenges that remain are how to dis-
tribute them, to whom they should go 
first, and how to persuade Americans 
they are safe to take. 
But while we are in the midst of deal-
ing with all of this, it would be wise to 
remember that any legislation that we 
pass in Congress this year dealing with 
this pandemic should also take steps to 
make sure that our stockpiles are 
filled, that our manufacturing plants 
can stay functioning, and that public 
health State by State is well funded, 
because, as Jared Diamond said, the 
reason to do that now, while our eye is 
on the ball, is because the next pan-
demic could be next year. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
(The remarks of Mr. HAWLEY
per-
taining to the introduction of S. 4543 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. HAWLEY. I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Democratic leader. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 685 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am 
proud to support the resolution by the 
Senator from Illinois, and we will hear 
from her shortly. I very much appre-
ciate her work. 
Now, in his famous letter to Lydia 
Bixby, mother of five sons who all died 
in the Civil War, President Lincoln 
prayed that our Heavenly Father would 
assuage her grief, noting the ‘‘solemn 
pride that must be yours to have laid 
so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of 
Freedom.’’ 
According to a recent report in the 
Atlantic, President Trump complained 
about visiting a World War I military 
cemetery in France because Americans 
who died there were ‘‘suckers’’ and 
‘‘losers.’’ 
Over the past 4 years, President 
Trump has achieved some remarkable 
lows in the annals of Presidential con-
duct and character, but every so often 
we are jolted by the sheer depravity of 
his comments. This President’s insults 
about our fallen servicemembers and 
the nature of military service in gen-
eral fall into that category—the lowest 
of the low. 
There is no greater sacrifice an 
American can make than to lay down 
their life for our country, no greater 
sorrow than the sorrow felt by parents 
who bury their children wrapped in the 
American flag. Everyone who has the 
privilege of working in public office 
knows this deep truth in their bones 
but not the current President of the 
United States; not President Trump; 
not this man who dodged the Vietnam 
war with bone spurs; not this man who 
insulted 
Gold 
Star 
families, 
who 
looked at our former colleague John 
McCain, a man who was tortured in a 
POW camp for 5 years, and said, ‘‘I pre-
fer people who weren’t captured’’; not 
this President, who doesn’t understand 
one iota of the word ‘‘sacrifice’’ and 
cannot even comprehend why someone 
might give themselves for a larger 
cause. 
According to these reports, when 
President Trump went to Arlington 
National Cemetery, which included a 
visit to the grave of General Kelly’s 
son, he turned to him and said: I don’t 
get it. What was in it for them? 
Everyone—everyone—ought to be ap-
palled. What the Commander in Chief 
says about our servicemembers and our 
veterans matters a great deal. It af-
fects the morale of our military, our 
standing on the world stage, and it re-
veals the character of the man who has 
to make life-and-death decisions in-
volving our Armed Forces. 
We have heard the President and his 
team try to deny that the President 
ever made those comments. I mean, 
come on. The President is on video say-
ing nearly the same thing, out loud, on 
several occasions—about one of our 
former colleagues, no less. 
In a short time, Senator DUCKWORTH 
will ask this Chamber to condemn the 
President’s remarks and reaffirm our 
Nation’s 
steadfast 
and 
unwavering 
commitment to the individuals serving 
in the U.S. armed services. I want to 
thank the Senator from Illinois for 
leading this resolution. More impor-
tantly, I want to thank her for her 
service, both to the people of Illinois 
and to our country, as an Army avia-
tion officer. 
I hope, I pray, I plead with our Re-
publican friends not to block this reso-
lution. I am already disappointed at 
how few of them have spoken out to 
criticize President Trump for his re-
marks. Are they really so afraid to say 
anything against this President that 
they would give him a pass when he 
disparages our own military? Will they 
really block a resolution condemning 
the 
unequivocally 
disgusting 
com-
ments, a resolution that reaffirms our 
support for the military? 
I certainly hope not. If you can’t 
stand up and say the President was 
wrong to say these things, then what 
can you criticize this President or any 
President for? When comments like 
this are made about the sacrifices of 
our Armed Forces, every single elected 
official should understand instinctively 
that they are wrong, especially—espe-
cially—when they come from the Com-
mander in Chief. Let’s have the entire 
Senate—Democrats and Republicans— 
stand together and say so with this res-
olution. 
I yield to my colleague from Illinois. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today as a Senator, a 
veteran, and apparently, according to 
Donald Trump, a ‘‘sucker’’ and a 
‘‘loser.’’ Perhaps my presence here is 
uncomfortable for him. After all, ac-
cording to a number of reports, he 
thinks nobody wants to see wounded 
warriors like me who have lost limbs 
fighting to keep other Americans safe. 
Unfortunately for him, I am here, 
and I am here because the ethos of the 
U.S. military is the exact opposite of 
the selfish, craven, ‘‘me first’’ men-
tality that Trump has shown every 
hour of every day of his life. 
In the Army, part of our soldiers’ 
creed was to never leave a fallen com-
rade behind, and the only reason I am 
speaking today, the only reason I am 
breathing today—alive today—is that, 
on November 12, 2004, after Iraqi insur-
gents fired an RPG through the Black 
Hawk I was copiloting, my buddies em-
bodied that creed. 
They thought I was dead, yet they 
risked their own safety to bring my 
body back home to my family, only re-
alizing I was still breathing when they 
got me to the rescue aircraft. Then 
these heroes, wounded themselves, re-
fused care until the medic attended to 
me first. 
If it had been Donald Trump in that 
dusty field with me, or in any other 
battlefield, our wounded like me would 
have never made it home at all. But he 
never would have been in Iraq that day 
because Trump fundamentally cannot 
understand the notion of sacrificing for 
your Nation. He can’t comprehend the 
true meaning of courage, the idea of 
fighting for something greater than 
yourself, greater than your bank ac-
count or your poll numbers. 
He doesn’t understand service, so he 
doesn’t understand America’s service-
members, the heroes—most of them 
anonymous to all but those who love 
them, who have allowed him to sleep 
soundly in his gold-plated Fifth Avenue 
Tower throughout his privileged, gilded 
life. Instead, Trump has reportedly 
called those who have died or have 
been wounded in battle ‘‘suckers’’ and 
‘‘losers,’’ while just today it was re-
ported that he used the most demean-
ing of terms to refer to the military 
leaders he thinks of as his generals, 
echoing comments he has made pub-
licly time after time when he slandered 
war heroes like John McCain and Gold 
Star families like the Khans, acting, 
yet again, as if bleeding to defend your 
Nation is something to be ashamed of 
rather than a badge of honor, too igno-
rant to understand that he is the one 
who should be ashamed. 
I spent this weekend reflecting on 
the words of another Republican Presi-
dent, who in the midst of crisis re-
minded those sitting before him at Get-
tysburg the duty our Nation has to 
those killed serving our country. In 
that address we all know so well, he de-
clared that it is for us, the living, to 
dedicate ourselves to the unfinished 
work which they who fought here have 
thus far so nobly advanced; that cause 
for which they gave the last full meas-
ure of devotion. 
That cause was a new birth of free-
dom in this Nation, the bettering of 
our democracy, bringing our Union

September 9, 2020 
closer to perfection, even though we 
know we can never achieve it. 
What Lincoln understood—and what 
Trump never will—is that to be con-
temptuous of American warriors is to 
be disrespectful to the whole of the 
American people. When those lucky 
enough to serve in Congress—or in the 
White House—raise our right hands and 
swear to faithfully serve this Nation in 
these ornate hallowed halls, it is on us 
to keep faith with those who have 
raised their right hands and sworn to 
serve this Nation in the most dan-
gerous war zones imaginable. 
There is an implicit contract between 
our country’s leaders and our warriors: 
They and their families have entrusted 
us with their care, their training, and 
the decision to send them to war. That 
responsibility is a grave one. They will 
march to do our bidding on command. 
They will cross the line of departure 
and begin killing the enemy at our be-
hest, with no regard for their personal 
safety or the toll on their mental 
health. 
If our leaders regard our heroes as 
‘‘suckers’’ and ‘‘losers,’’ what damage 
will be done to America’s sons and 
daughters who comprise the terrible 
swift sword? I can tell you right now, it 
endangers every single one of them, 
and it endangers our Nation’s safety. 
If you care about nothing else, if you 
care nothing about basic decency or 
troop morale, it is bad for troop readi-
ness as well. When a warrior goes into 
combat, they need to know that their 
buddies to their left and their right 
will follow that creed to never leave a 
fallen comrade behind; that no matter 
what, no matter how, their buddies, 
their Nation, will get them out of 
there, even if it is just bringing their 
body home to rest at Arlington. 
It is because our servicemembers up-
hold the values of the military—in the 
Army, those are loyalty, duty, respect, 
selfless service, integrity and personal 
courage—that they are willing to sac-
rifice everything for this country and 
that we have the greatest fighting 
force on the face of the Earth. 
Donald Trump, by contrast, has 
shown active disdain for each of those 
values in his 4 years in office. He has 
shown the exact opposite of every one 
of those traits, displaying no sense of 
duty, a laughable sense of loyalty, in-
tegrity and courage—no, not to be 
seen. He has no respect for those in 
uniform, and selfishness is his trade-
mark rather than the selflessness of 
our troops. 
But if Trump’s toxicity starts to 
break down those values within the 
military, if we start to question why 
we care about those who have been 
wounded or killed for us, if we start 
leaving folks behind, then people will 
begin to think twice about signing up 
to serve. Families will reconsider sup-
porting their loved ones’ decisions to 
enlist. 
Those few, few Americans who were 
ready to take on that mission—that 
burden—will start to hesitate because 
they will not know if their own crew 
will risk their lives like mine did to 
carry their limp body back to safety, 
but this coward-in-chief in the White 
House today is too ignorant in matters 
of both common decency and national 
security to get that. He doesn’t deserve 
to be Commander in Chief of this mili-
tary for another 4 minutes, let alone 
another 4 years. 
So, yes, I am disappointed that my 
Republican colleagues will be objecting 
to passing my Senate resolution hon-
oring our troops, veterans, and Gold 
Star families and that they will not be 
condemning Trump’s disgraceful be-
havior that denigrates military service 
that has dishonored the office of the 
Presidency. 
Does any Senator actually oppose af-
firming the part of what makes Amer-
ica not only great but good is the serv-
ice of Americans who have always 
placed the mission first, never asking 
what is in it for them? Does any Mem-
ber actually object to the Senate re-
solving to always respect the sacrifices 
and bravery of those who became pris-
oners of war or went missing in action? 
I am confident that no one here actu-
ally opposes the Senate declaring that 
we will always care for service-disabled 
veterans who have borne the battle in 
defense of our Nation, recognizing that 
wounds of war are earned by patriots 
who put America’s interests before 
their own. 
So what is the problem? If Senate Re-
publicans actually agree with every-
thing I just listed, why would they op-
pose my resolution stating the same? I 
know some may dismiss the resolution 
out of hand, claiming it is nothing 
more than just a partisan jab at Don-
ald Trump. To those people, I would 
simply ask that they not rewrite re-
cent history and stop pretending that 
outrage over Trump’s disrespect of the 
military is something new or one that 
just originated with the Democrat 
Party. After all, some of the very first 
public officials to speak out against it 
were Republican Senators who con-
tinue to serve in this very Chamber 
today. 
When then-Candidate Trump claimed 
the late Senator John McCain was not 
a war hero because Trump ‘‘like[s] peo-
ple who weren’t captured,’’ it was the 
Senator’s friend from South Carolina 
who wrote: ‘‘If there was ever any 
doubt that [Trump] should not be our 
commander in chief, [this] should end 
all doubt.’’ Again, it was the senior 
Senator from Florida who said much of 
the same. 
I can only say that it is shameful 
that no one on the other side of the 
aisle has stood up to condemn this 
President for the comments he has 
made, for the fact that he did not make 
his way to that cemetery to honor 
those veterans of Belleau Wood laying 
at rest in that foreign soil, who were 
there not just for us but for our allies, 
for everyone that they may never even 
know. 
Today, I am here to ask, as if in leg-
islative session, unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of S. Res. 685, 
which was submitted earlier today. I 
further ask unanimous consent that 
the resolution be agreed to, the pre-
amble be agreed to, and the motions to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Thank you, Sen-
ator DUCKWORTH, for your service and 
your sacrifice. We share the goal of 
supporting our military and our vet-
erans. However, the left’s latest out-
rage against President Trump is, as 
usual, baseless. Here is the truth: The 
Atlantic article is just one in a long 
line 
of 
lies 
and 
political 
attacks 
against President Trump by unac-
countable, fake news outlets and the 
so-called anonymous sources. 
Here is another truth, one that will 
not be covered by the fake news: No 
one has done more to support our men 
and women in uniform, including our 
veterans, and more to restore peace 
and prosperity for all Americans than 
President Donald J. Trump. 
Let me share the facts with some of 
my colleagues and the media, which 
they refuse to acknowledge. This Presi-
dent has championed a historic invest-
ment of $2.2 trillion into our military, 
a 3 percent pay raise for troops—the 
largest in a decade. He has personally 
thanked our troops on the ground in 
Iraq, Afghanistan, South Korea, and 
Germany. He has spent countless hours 
honoring our wounded warriors at Wal-
ter Reed Medical Center and honoring 
our fallen servicemembers killed in ac-
tion at Dover Air Force Base. 
He confirmed plans to withdraw 
troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, hon-
oring his commitment to end endless 
wars. Finally, today, he was nominated 
for a Nobel Peace Prize for his leader-
ship in facilitating the Israel-UAE 
peace deal, a historic step toward a 
safer world for all. I am proud to de-
fend President Trump against another 
desperate political attack. I proudly 
stand with him in support of our mili-
tary and our veterans. 
This Atlantic hit piece is the antith-
esis of honest journalism. More than 
two dozen former and current adminis-
tration officials have rebutted these 
false claims on the record. In fact, the 
liberal activist author, who has a his-
tory of using sources that are shaky at 
best, admitted that his reliance on 
anonymous 
sources 
was 
not 
good 
enough. What is not good enough is the 
media’s treatment of this President 
and his clear track record of support of 
our military and their families. 
Last week, I was at Fort Gordon and 
Fort Stewart in Georgia, visiting our 
Active-Duty members. I saw firsthand 
the opportunities our military leaders

now have to grow our safety and secu-
rity on all fronts, from combating ter-
rorism to making sure our cyber do-
main is safer. There was a renewed 
sense of optimism that should bring all 
Americans comfort. This is a direct re-
sult of the President’s work that he is 
doing every single day for our men and 
women in uniform. They are fighting 
every single day to protect us, and he 
is fighting every single day to have 
their back. 
Here is the truth: President Trump 
has delivered on his promises to rebuild 
our military, to respect our veterans, 
and to keep our country safe. It is time 
to stop playing politics with our na-
tional security and those who provide 
it. 
For these reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Illinois has the 
floor. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, all 
I can do is to implore my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to reassert 
their independence, actually put prin-
ciple before party and support this res-
olution, which simply recognizes a 
basic reality. Trump’s denigration of 
military service is even more disgrace-
ful today than it was 5 years ago, as he 
is now at least supposed to be our 
troops’ Commander in Chief. 
Former chief of staff of the Army 
General Weyand once wrote that the 
American Army really is the people’s 
Army in the sense that it belongs to 
the American people. When the Army 
is committed, the American people are 
committed. 
The Army is not so much an arm of 
the executive branch as it is an arm of 
the American people. He may have 
been talking about the Army, but the 
sentiment holds true for every military 
branch, every one of which belongs to 
the American people. It is made up of 
their sons and daughters, mothers and 
fathers, sisters and brothers, all of 
whom have dedicated their lives to 
serve in the Nation they love on behalf 
of the people they love. When Donald 
Trump mocks our troops, he is mock-
ing every American in every part of 
this country. When he derides wounded 
warriors, he is just providing further 
proof that to him the word ‘‘sacrifice’’ 
is so foreign it might as well be in an-
other language. 
When he makes fun of those who 
have fallen in battle, he reveals not 
only his ignorance of national security 
but his own personal cowardice and in-
securities as well. To him, service will 
never mean anything other than some-
one else serving him. 
Trump may not want to see me here 
today. He may not like to see visible 
proof of my war wounds, but he will 
keep seeing me here because it is my 
duty to honor the heroes who saved me 
by using my second chance, using 
every extra minute, every extra mo-
ment that I have to look out for our 
troops and veterans from here in the 
Capitol. 
I will take advantage of every extra 
breath I get to breathe because, unlike 
Donald Trump, our men and women in 
uniform know what courage, sacrifice, 
and service truly mean. 
With that, I note how grateful I am 
for my Democratic colleagues who are 
here with me today to show support for 
our troops, veterans, and Gold Star 
families. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Mr. President, in-
stead of passing a resolution meant to 
politicize our military, I am offering 
my own resolution to honor the service 
and the sacrifice of the members of the 
U.S. Armed Forces, veterans, prisoners 
of war, and Gold Star families. 
My resolution also recognizes Presi-
dent Trump’s strong record of sup-
porting our troops, taking care of our 
veterans, defending the American peo-
ple from foreign threats. President 
Trump and I have and always will 
honor the service and sacrifice of our 
brave men and women in uniform. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that, as if in legislative session, 
the Senate proceed to the consider-
ation of my resolution at the desk. I 
further ask that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, 
and that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. I cannot support 
the incomplete Senate Republican res-
olution for a simple reason: We are not 
honoring the service and sacrifice of 
members of the U.S. Armed Forces, 
veterans, and Gold Star families in this 
Republican resolution. We cannot do 
that if we stay silent and meek when 
confronted with President Trump’s dis-
graceful denigration of military serv-
ice, prisoners of war, and military fam-
ilies continue. 
We can’t control the offensive com-
ments and actions of the President, but 
the Senate can make a clear statement 
that our Chamber rejects such dis-
graceful sentiments. 
Republicans’ 
refusal 
to 
criticize 
President Trump speaks volumes when 
you remember that the outrage over 
Donald Trump’s disrespect of our mili-
tary is not a new concern. It actually 
originates with Republican Senators 
who were among the very first public 
officials to speak out against his deni-
gration of military service and pris-
oners of war. I remind you that the 
senior Senator from Florida spared no 
outrage when, in responding to Can-
didate Trump’s claim that Senator 
McCain was not a war hero, he stated: 
‘‘It’s not just absurd, it’s offensive. It’s 
ridiculous. And I do think it’s a dis-
qualifier as Commander in Chief.’’ 
The Republican resolution is incom-
plete if it does not condemn this Presi-
dent’s 
comments 
denigrating 
our 
troops. That is why I am disappointed 
that Republicans won’t join me in pass-
ing my resolution that recognizes the 
sad truth that Donald Trump never 
changed and his denigration of mili-
tary service and sacrifice is as disquali-
fying today as it was years ago. 
I yield to the senior Senator from Il-
linois. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me 
say at the outset how proud I am to 
serve 
with 
my 
colleague, 
Senator 
TAMMY DUCKWORTH of Illinois. Her sac-
rifice for America is nothing short of 
amazing. Her life’s story, her commit-
ment to the men and women in uni-
form whom she served with and to the 
veterans and others, is now well estab-
lished, not just in my State but across 
this Nation. 
Only a small minority of Americans 
have had the privilege and honor of 
serving in the military. Many, like my-
self, count themselves as those who re-
spect the military and understand that 
they deserve that respect for their will-
ingness to volunteer to serve and even 
to die for this Nation. What Senator 
DUCKWORTH has done with her life is a 
clear indication of the spirit of the 
fighting women and men who keep this 
Nation democratic and safe. 
I am really disappointed. What a 
great moment it would have been in 
the history of the Senate if we had Re-
publican support, as well as Demo-
cratic support, for the Duckworth reso-
lution. I am sorry the Senator from 
Georgia objected. She took exception 
to The Atlantic magazine article, the 
one that said the President called 
those who died in war ‘‘losers’’ and 
‘‘suckers,’’ but even that article has 
been accepted by FOX News as being a 
valid comment made by the President 
and reported. 
Even if you take The Atlantic maga-
zine and set it aside, there is ample evi-
dence of this President’s attitude to-
ward our military. We all heard Donald 
Trump say publicly, when he was run-
ning for President in 2015, about our 
friend and colleague, the late John 
McCain: ‘‘He’s not a war hero. . . . I 
like people who weren’t captured.’’ 
John McCain spent more than 5 years 
in a prisoner-of-war camp in Vietnam, 
and this President, Donald Trump, dis-
misses him as no war hero. John 
McCain suffered for his Nation. He de-
serves the respect of everyone, let 
alone the President. 
We also saw Donald Trump publicly 
attack a Gold Star family in 2016, the 
parents of the late Humayun Khan, an 
Army captain killed in Iraq in 2004. 
We have heard President Trump dis-
miss traumatic brain injury faced by 
servicemembers and veterans as just 
‘‘headaches.’’ 
We have seen his silence in the face 
of reports that Russia offered bounties 
to kill American servicemembers in Af-
ghanistan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5495 
September 9, 2020 
We have witnessed his use of military 
officials for photo ops or as his own 
personal security forces. 
Recall the scene in ‘‘A Very Stable 
Genius’’ by Washington Post reporters 
Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig in 
which Trump called the service chiefs 
‘‘a bunch of dopes and babies’’ and 
barked: ‘‘You’re all losers. You don’t 
know how to win anymore.’’ President 
Trump repeated those claims again in a 
news conference just this week. 
These are just a few examples of not 
fake news but real news about this 
President’s attitude toward the Amer-
ican fighting men and women. It is no 
surprise that he would say vile things 
privately if he would say these things 
publicly. 
Instead of respecting our troops, 
President Trump ridicules them. In-
stead of bowing his head in humility, 
he barks insults and obscenities. No 
President in our history—none that I 
can even imagine—has been so juve-
nile, so abusive, and so cynical in 
speaking of our fallen heroes. What do 
we hear from Republican officeholders 
about these sickening comments? Very 
little, if anything, in objection. Their 
silence is deafening. 
I want to close by thanking my col-
league, Senator DUCKWORTH, for bring-
ing this matter to the floor of the Sen-
ate. Every Member of the Senate— 
man, woman, Democrat, Republican— 
we all carry the flag and proudly 
march in parades and give those inspi-
rational speeches on Memorial Day 
about the men and women who have 
served our Nation, but where are the 
voices in the Senate today to speak out 
against the outrages of this President? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am 
honored 
to 
join 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH
in supporting this pro-
posal. It gives me great pride to serve 
in the Senate with her. She is the liv-
ing embodiment of the kind of sacrifice 
that our President does not under-
stand. 
There are two things here, though, 
that are very wrong. One is a President 
who thinks that the soldiers, sailors, 
airmen, and marines who have laid 
down their lives for this country are 
‘‘suckers’’ and ‘‘losers’’ and that it is 
OK to say that about them. It is be-
yond disrespectful. It is beneath con-
tempt, and it is totally in character for 
this man. Those soldiers, sailors, air-
men, and marines can’t answer; they 
can’t speak for themselves any longer. 
So when something like that is said, it 
is very important that people in the 
highest offices of the country stand up 
and push back. 
In graves in France and Belgium and 
Manila and around the world lie the 
mortal remains of men, boys, women 
who gave their lives and who cannot 
speak for themselves. It is heart-
breaking for me to see that we cannot 
come together to agree on that in this 
body. 
I can promise you that if President 
Obama or President Clinton had said 
anything like this, the other side of 
this Chamber would have been in pan-
demonium. It would have been a scene 
of hysteria. Senators would have been 
lining up through the doors to come 
and condemn this foul and hateful 
speech. We would have been hearing a 
lot about the last full measure of devo-
tion. Instead, we are seeing the last 
measure of devolution of a great party 
into what now resembles, as much as 
anything, a cult. 
I will be interested to see what my 
colleagues have in mind as they go 
through next year’s Veterans Day and 
Memorial Day having been unable to 
say one word against this calumny of 
our troops today. It is, frankly, heart-
breaking. 
I traveled a lot with John McCain, 
and one of our trips took us to the 
Philippines. I got up very early in the 
morning to go and have basically a 
dawn visit to the Manila American 
Cemetery. The particular reason I went 
there is to see a name on the wall of 
the memorial: George Bruen White-
house. George was 21 when he was 
killed. He was flying fighter planes as a 
Navy pilot off an aircraft carrier called 
the USS Cowpens. His body was never 
recovered. His plane was shot down and 
crashed into the wilderness, and that 
was the end of it, but his name is still 
there, carved high up in the marble as 
a last memorial of his sacrifice. A 
President who doesn’t get that is a dis-
grace. 
I yield the floor. 
Particularly, I yield the floor to a 
colleague who is an American combat 
veteran from the Vietnam war, to 
which my father dedicated 5 years of 
his life. It is a remarkable honor for me 
to be able to speak in between Senator 
DUCKWORTH and Senator CARPER. I am 
cognizant of that honor. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CARPER. It is an honor to follow 
my friend Senator WHITEHOUSE. 
You could only turn out well, my 
friend, with the bloodlines you have. 
Mr. President, I rise today really for 
one reason: I rise today to make crys-
tal clear that we are profoundly grate-
ful to every American who has an-
swered our Nation’s call to serve in 
uniform, to risk their lives, and in too 
many instances to lay down their lives 
so that we might remain a free people. 
We are profoundly grateful to their 
families who have sacrificed so much 
while their loved ones were away fight-
ing to protect the rest of us and mak-
ing this a better and more just world. 
We are especially indebted to those 
families whose loved ones left for war 
and never came home. It is a sacrifice 
that many Americans can barely imag-
ine but one that has been all too real 
for millions of families since the found-
ing of our Nation. 
One of those families was my moth-
er’s family. I never got to meet my 
mom’s younger brother. His name was 
Bob Kidd Patton. My mom was a Pat-
ton. Bob was the youngest of five chil-
dren, born near the coal-mining town 
of Beckley, WV, to my grandparents, 
Ray and Effie Mae Patton, a Gold Star 
mother. Bobby was killed in action on 
October 26, 1944, during a kamikaze at-
tack in the Western Pacific on his air-
craft 
carrier, 
the 
USS 
Suwannee. 
Among the bodies of the ship’s crew 
who were never recovered was that of 
my Uncle Bob. On the day of that at-
tack, he was—get this—19 years, 6 
months, 23 days old. My grandparents 
were never able to see their son again 
or say goodbye. My sister and I, along 
with our cousins, would never meet 
him. 
Neither Bob Patton nor his Suwannee 
shipmates who also perished that day 
were ‘‘suckers’’ or ‘‘losers,’’ as Presi-
dent Trump has characterized others 
who answered our Nation’s call to uni-
form; they were and remain heroes. 
I was fortunate enough to make it 
home after serving three tours in 
Southeast Asia during the Vietnam 
war, but 58,000 of my brothers and sis-
ters never did. Their names are in-
scribed in a black granite wall not far 
from here so Americans will remember 
their sacrifice. Let me add that those 
58,000 Americans were not ‘‘suckers’’ or 
‘‘losers’’ either, as President Trump 
has described John McCain; they were 
patriots. Unlike Donald Trump, they 
answered the call of duty. 
My squadron and I were deployed to 
Southeast Asia as part of the Seventh 
Fleet for several of the years that John 
McCain was held as prisoner of war in 
the ‘‘Hanoi Hilton,’’ along with hun-
dreds of other POWs. His plane had 
been shot down in 1967 over Hanoi. 
Both his arms and one of his legs were 
broken during the ensuing crash, and 
he was taken prisoner of war. For 51⁄2 
years, John McCain was held captive, 
beaten, and tortured. Despite this, he 
refused the early release that was of-
fered to him by his captors. Far from 
being the loser that President Trump 
refers to him as, John McCain was the 
embodiment of courage, and my col-
leagues know it. He proved that again 
and again in uniform and right here in 
this Chamber, standing right over 
there. 
A number of us in this body have 
been blessed to serve alongside other 
true patriots both during our time in 
Congress and in uniform. 
The late Dan Inouye lost an arm and 
earned the Medal of Honor while serv-
ing in the 442nd—the most decorated 
American Army unit of World War II. 
They were all Japanese Americans who 
were despised by many Americans. 
They were heroes too. 
There is former Senator Bob Dole— 
another highly decorated World War II 
hero who was nearly paralyzed and lost 
the use of one arm after he had been 
hit by enemy fire while he helped to 
save the life of a fellow soldier. 
Then there is, of course, our amazing 
friend and our amazing colleague, 
TAMMY DUCKWORTH. God love her. 
TAMMY, thank you for bringing us to 
the floor today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5496 
September 9, 2020 
For any American to disparage he-
roes like them who gave their lives or 
limbs for a country would be des-
picable, but to hear that contempt 
from the man who is now our Com-
mander in Chief and who chose not to 
serve in the Vietnam war because of, 
allegedly, bone spurs in his foot is 
worse than despicable—it is abhorrent. 
What is most surprising and really 
disappointing to me, though, is not 
that Donald Trump would use words 
like ‘‘loser’’ and ‘‘sucker’’ to describe 
heroes like John McCain and others. 
What is most surprising and dis-
appointing is that there are only 
Democrats on this floor today who are 
condemning the utter contempt that 
Donald Trump has shown for our serv-
icemembers 
over 
too 
many 
years. 
There should be 100 Senators on this 
floor today—100—saying, in no uncer-
tain terms, that we have nothing but 
respect and admiration for those who 
have served and that we will not allow 
them to be mocked or ridiculed by any-
one, including by the President of the 
United States. 
Honoring those who have served this 
country and risked their lives for this 
country is among the most sacred of 
obligations any of us has. If we can’t 
stand up and defend those men and 
women, then we have no business being 
here. 
Let me close with this. 
To the millions of soldiers, sailors, 
air men and women, marines, and 
Coast Guard members who are risking 
their lives right now around the world 
and who have done so for generations, 
listen to this: We salute you. We thank 
you. We thank your families from the 
bottom of our hearts. God bless you. 
Stay safe. Come home. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
as I listen to my colleagues, I am hon-
ored every day to serve with them in 
the U.S. Senate. 
In 2018, in Minden, NV, I had the 
honor of commemorating the opening 
of the Moving Wall, which is a replica 
of the Vietnam war memorial that 
travels the country so the public can 
pay its respects to Vietnam veterans. I 
will always remember the stories that 
veterans and their families shared with 
me that day—stories of coming home 
from a divisive war to an equally di-
vided public. The pain of that reception 
was still fresh for many of them dec-
ades later. 
America’s servicemembers make an 
implicit pact with our country. They 
agree to put their lives on the line, and 
in exchange, they deserve our support, 
our care for them and their families, 
and our respect. 
Last week, The Atlantic magazine 
published a story in which anonymous 
sources claimed that Donald Trump 
doesn’t demonstrate that respect. The 
article described a Commander in Chief 
who calls his own country’s fallen sol-
diers ‘‘losers’’ and ‘‘suckers.’’ The story 
has fit a pattern from other anony-
mous sources over the years, some hav-
ing described the President as lashing 
out at generals and calling them 
‘‘dopes’’ and ‘‘babies.’’ 
Now, granted, these are from anony-
mous sources, so let’s set them aside 
for just a moment. As the saying goes, 
journalism is the rough draft of his-
tory, and sometimes that rough draft 
gets things wrong. 
What do we know? 
What we do know from the Presi-
dent’s public statements is that Donald 
Trump does not understand the sac-
rifice and heroism that America’s 
Armed Forces demonstrate on a daily 
basis, and that makes him unfit to lead 
them. How can a Commander in Chief 
make life and death decisions for our 
troops when he doesn’t understand the 
very nature of the sacrifice he is ask-
ing? 
I am not making up Donald Trump’s 
refusal to understand military sac-
rifice. You just have to look at the 
record, and you have heard some of it 
today. That record is part of the public 
record that, in 1968, showed that Don-
ald Trump avoided military service 
through a medical deferment. Although 
Donald Trump did not serve in the 
military, he has felt free to criticize 
others who have and their families. 
In 2015, we heard then-Candidate 
Donald Trump say that John McCain 
was ‘‘not a war hero. . . . I like people 
who weren’t captured.’’ He was talking 
about a man who endured torture dur-
ing the 5 years he spent as a prisoner, 
a man who upheld the highest stand-
ards of our military by turning down 
the release that his captors offered him 
in order to stay with his fellow POWs, 
a man who refused to denounce his 
country even when his captors in-
formed him it could earn him his free-
dom. 
Clearly, this President has no con-
ception of that integrity and that sac-
rifice. A President who refuses to 
honor men and women who were cap-
tured doesn’t understand what heroism 
is. 
In 2016, as the Republican nominee 
for President, Donald Trump attacked 
the family of CPT Humayan Khan, who 
was killed in Iraq while trying to stop 
a suicide bomber. For his brave and 
self-sacrificing actions that day, Cap-
tain Khan received a Bronze Star and a 
Purple Heart. 
Accompanied by his wife at the 
Democratic National Convention, Mr. 
Khan spoke about his son’s sacrifice. In 
response, after seeing Mr. Khan and his 
wife, Donald Trump said: 
If you look at his wife, she was standing 
there. She had nothing to say. She prob-
ably—maybe she wasn’t allowed to have any-
thing to say. 
Can you imagine criticizing a mother 
for not being able to articulate the 
pain of losing her son? A President who 
mocks a military family’s pain doesn’t 
understand what selflessness is. 
Just this Monday, we heard Donald 
Trump say that the top people in the 
Pentagon want to do nothing but fight 
wars so that all of those wonderful 
companies that make the bombs stay 
happy. 
A President who attacks America’s 
generals as valuing profits over the 
men and women they command doesn’t 
understand what leadership is, and be-
cause, even after 3 years as Commander 
in Chief Donald Trump can’t under-
stand or appreciate the commitment 
and sacrifice of America’s servicemem-
bers, he cannot effectively lead them. 
At the end of the day, Donald Trump 
does not understand the very purpose 
of our military. He seems to believe 
that the military is his personal police 
force. He doesn’t get that the alle-
giance to which our Armed Forces 
swear is to the American Nation, its 
people, and its Constitution. 
We saw this when, in June, President 
Trump threatened to use the Insurrec-
tion Act to send Active-Duty troops to 
police the streets of this country. I was 
in Washington on the day this adminis-
tration ordered police on horseback, 
armed with tear gas and concussion 
grenades, to disperse protesters who 
were peacefully protesting against po-
lice 
violence—all 
so 
that 
Donald 
Trump could stage a photo opportunity 
in front of a church while he held a 
Bible. On that same night, I could hear 
the noise overhead from the National 
Guard Black Hawk helicopters that en-
gaged in a show-of-force display on the 
streets of Washington. 
I come from a family of servicemem-
bers. My father was stationed in Korea 
after the war. My grandfathers both 
served in the U.S. Army, and I had a 
great uncle who was on the beach at 
Normandy. My father-in-law piloted 
LCM–3s in Korea for the Army, and I 
keep on the shelf in my Senate office a 
photo that he took of the Korean War 
Veterans Memorial, here in Wash-
ington, in winter. That stark image of 
troops in the snow, moving cautiously 
through danger, is a reminder to me of 
the humanity and sacrifice of our serv-
icemembers, including of my father 
and father-in-law. 
Each year, when I celebrate the in-
duction of new Nevadans to the service 
academies, I see the next generation 
devoting its idealism and its courage to 
our country, and I consider the weighty 
sacrifice of people who are so very 
young. 
After reading the stories in the news 
and reflecting on the history of com-
ments from our current Commander in 
Chief, I just want to say one simple 
thing to veterans, servicemembers, and 
their families in Nevada and through-
out this country: Thank you. I will al-
ways stand with American troops who 
put their lives and bodies on the line to 
protect our country, and the American 
people deserve a Commander in Chief 
who will do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am proud to follow my colleagues who

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5497 
September 9, 2020 
have spoken on the floor, particularly 
Senators CARPER and DUCKWORTH, and 
to join them today, for they are in the 
great tradition of this body—Bob Dole, 
Daniel Inouye, TAMMY
DUCKWORTH, 
TOM
CARPER, and John McCain. We 
have known our share of heroes, and I 
am here to say thank you to them and 
to the others among us who have 
served. 
I am proud to be here as a dad of two 
veterans—one a combat infantry offi-
cer in the Marine Corps, another a spe-
cial operator in the Navy. Both are de-
ployed. I myself served in the U.S. Ma-
rine Corps Reserve. I am here to say to 
the other moms and dads and loved 
ones that Donald Trump does not 
speak for me; that Donald Trump does 
not speak for us; and that Donald 
Trump does not speak for America. 
When he called those brave heroes 
who laid down their lives ‘‘suckers’’ or 
‘‘losers,’’ my first reaction was dis-
belief. Then, in an instant, it was to-
tally to believe that he had said it be-
cause it was so much in character for 
Donald Trump. For him, it is all about 
Donald Trump. If somebody else can 
serve and take his place without there 
being sacrifice on his part, so much the 
better. Donald Trump does not speak 
for the America I know and love or for 
those who have given of themselves or 
risked their lives, like my colleagues 
who have spoken today. 
When Donald Trump talked about 
the heroes of Belleau Wood, he could 
have used a history lesson because, 
clearly, the marines at Belleau Wood 
were not suckers. In fact, the relentless 
tenacity of their fighting earned them 
a nickname from the German soldiers 
who were their adversaries. The Ger-
mans 
called 
them 
‘‘Teufelshunde,’’ 
meaning ‘‘devil dog.’’ This proud mon-
iker has stuck with them all of these 
years, and they use it when addressing 
each other—‘‘devil dog.’’ That is what 
they were. 
One of their commanding officers, 
Maj. Thomas Holcomb, wrote a letter 
to his wife 2 days into battle, which 
reads: 
The regiment has carried itself with undy-
ing glory, but the price was heavy. . . . 
There never was such self-sacrifice, courage, 
and spirit shown. 
In the 3 weeks of fighting, the 4th 
Marine Expeditionary Brigade suffered 
a 55-percent casualty rate—55 percent. 
His battalion alone suffered 764 casual-
ties out of 900 men. He became the 17th 
Commandant of the Marine Corps and 
Belleau Wood became part of Marine 
Corps history. That battle was one of 
hundreds, even thousands of battles, 
where soldiers, sailors, airmen, and 
marines distinguished themselves with 
uncommon valor. For every Belleau 
Wood, there are other battles for each 
of those services. None of them fought 
like suckers or losers. 
The cost of war is unspeakably high, 
and we know that from our own work 
on the Armed Services Committee and 
on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I 
had just come from a hearing of the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee where we 
were discussing the problem of veteran 
suicide. Twenty of our heroes take 
their own lives every day. Yet we in 
this body have failed to provide effec-
tive solutions to those invisible wounds 
that caused those deaths. That is a na-
tional disgrace. 
So, to the loved ones of those who 
have risked and given their lives, we 
are here to make a point. This resolu-
tion makes that point eloquently and 
powerfully. Donald Trump speaks for 
no one in this body, as far as I know, 
and it is a shame that our Republican 
colleagues are literally absent. They 
are absent without leave. They are 
AWOL from this moment in history 
that calls upon them to stand up and 
be heard in the name of our Nation’s 
heroes. Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to express my 
support for the resolution introduced 
by my colleagues, Senators DUCKWORTH 
and REED. I thank both of them, not 
only for acting swiftly to defend the 
honor of our servicemen and service-
women but for their distinguished serv-
ice to our country, both of them vet-
erans themselves. 
By now, we are used to Donald 
Trump saying a lot of dishonorable, 
distasteful, and downright disgusting 
things, but there truly is no bottom 
when it come to this President, as is 
evident in the despicable comments he 
made about our fallen soldiers as re-
ported last week by The Atlantic, com-
ments that have since been confirmed 
by additional reporting from FOX 
News, which is normally very sup-
portive of the President, and the Asso-
ciated Press. He called these heroes, 
these fallen soldiers, ‘‘suckers’’ and 
‘‘losers’’—‘‘suckers’’ and ‘‘losers.’’ 
The Atlantic reports that, while 
traveling in Europe to commemorate 
the end of World War I back in Novem-
ber of 2018, President Trump canceled a 
scheduled visit to honor those buried 
at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery. 
He didn’t understand why he should 
bother visiting such a cemetery in the 
first place. ‘‘It’s filled with losers,’’ he 
said. Can you imagine? Can you imag-
ine? 
It was on that same trip that Presi-
dent Trump referred to our marines 
who died in battle at Belleau Wood as 
‘‘suckers’’ for getting killed—‘‘suck-
ers’’ for getting killed—‘‘losers’’ and 
‘‘suckers.’’ 
Those words are hurtful words. They 
are damaging words. They are words 
that should never be spoken by a Com-
mander in Chief. It is unthinkable, it is 
unforgivable, and I think it is un- 
American. 
The same story also recounts the 
President’s visit to Arlington Ceme-
tery with then-Secretary of Homeland 
Security John Kelly, himself a Gold 
Star father, who lost his son Robert in 
2010 in Afghanistan. Standing over 1st 
Lt. Robert Kelly’s grave, the President 
of the United States turned to his fa-
ther and said, ‘‘I don’t get it. What was 
in it for them?’’ 
‘‘What was in it for them?’’ This 
question captures the very essence of 
what is so deeply wrong with this 
President. In other words, why would 
any American give their life in service 
to our country? Why would anyone do 
anything if not for fame or fortune? 
You see, Donald Trump cannot fath-
om the idea of serving a cause greater 
than yourself because Donald Trump 
only serves himself. He cannot under-
stand why anyone would choose to live 
a life of service; why anyone would risk 
it all to carry our flag on the battle-
field; why anyone would put their own 
life on the line to defend our country, 
our people, and all that we as Ameri-
cans stand for. 
Since 
these 
despicable 
comments 
came to light, the White House has 
bent over backwards to deny them. 
Once again, too many of our Repub-
lican colleagues have stood silent, in-
stead of forcefully and unequivocally 
condemning 
the 
President’s 
words. 
They would rather cower to the cruelty 
of Donald Trump than stand up to 
those who have worn the uniform of 
the United States. 
The sad truth is that none of us have 
to stretch our imaginations to picture 
President Trump calling our fallen sol-
diers ‘‘suckers’’ and ‘‘losers’’ because 
he has repeatedly denigrated our men 
and women in uniform and the entire 
concept of military service. 
This is a man who, according to a 
New York Times investigation, had his 
wealthy father reportedly pay off a 
doctor in order to get a medical 
deferment from serving in Vietnam; a 
man who spoke out against disabled 
veterans selling goods on ritzy Fifth 
Avenue in New York City; a man who 
said that our late colleague, Senator 
John McCain, whom I was privileged to 
work with on so many national secu-
rity issues, was no war hero—he is not 
someone who should be praised because 
he was caught, a prisoner of war—and 
resisted lowering U.S. flags in his 
honor; a man who has publicly at-
tacked Gold Star families and failed to 
grasp the weight of their sacrifice; a 
man who, when asked about America’s 
soldiers injured in the Iranian missile 
attack last January on Al Asad Airbase 
in Iraq, shrugged off traumatic brain 
injuries as nothing more than a mere 
headache; and, most recently, a man 
who, as Commander in Chief, has done 
nothing—absolutely 
nothing—in 
re-
sponse to revelations that the Kremlin 
was awarding bounties to Taliban ter-
rorists for killing U.S. soldiers in Af-
ghanistan—the Kremlin, Russia, giving 
Taliban soldiers a bounty—a premium, 
a prize, a bonus—for killing U.S. sol-
diers in Afghanistan. 
What message does it send to the 
children of fallen soldiers when they 
read that the President called their 
parents ‘‘losers’’ and ‘‘suckers’’? What 
message does it send to the young peo-
ple I will speak with this weekend,

September 9, 2020 
whom I host an academy weekend 
with, who are considering applying to 
some of our Nation’s most prestigious 
military academies? 
What message does it send to adver-
saries like Vladimir Putin to learn 
that the President of the United States 
thinks that our service men and 
women on the ground in Afghanistan 
are suckers for being assassinated by 
Taliban terrorists? 
Article II of the Constitution does 
not give much instruction when it says 
that the President shall serve as Com-
mander in Chief; yet somehow, every 
President, until now, has carried out 
their responsibilities with a reverence 
for the men and women who serve our 
country and a sense of gratitude for 
those who give their lives in defense of 
our freedoms. 
Let me close with the words of a Gold 
Star mother from southern New Jer-
sey. 
Camden 
County 
Freeholder 
Melinda Kane’s son, Marine LCpl Jer-
emy Kane, died in Afghanistan more 
than a decade ago. She wrote: 
I am nauseated to think that the com-
mander in chief of our military would even 
think to disparage individuals, like my son, 
who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to 
every American. . . . For the parents raising 
children whose fathers and mothers have 
given everything to this country, how do 
they 
explain 
President 
Trump’s 
words? 
These brave Americans served with honor, 
integrity and heroism doing the things that 
civilians could not and would not do. That 
said, here we are today, in a place we never 
thought we would be—ensuring the world 
knows that those that serve our country are 
heroes. 
Today, I want to say to our service 
men and women—from the young re-
cruit who just enlisted, to the soldier 
patrolling distant lands, to those who 
wore the uniform, to the loved ones of 
those who lost a loved one at war—you 
deserve an apology from our Com-
mander in Chief. Because you are not 
likely to get one, I think it is impor-
tant to say it here on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate: You are not suckers. You 
are not losers. You are heroes. Your 
families deserve our admiration and 
support for their sacrifices. The Amer-
ican people will always value you for 
bravely bearing our country’s cause, 
even when the President of the United 
States will not. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
join my colleagues to honor the service 
and sacrifice of members of the U.S. 
Armed Forces, veterans, and Gold Star 
families, and to commemorate the men 
and women in uniform who made the 
ultimate sacrifice to protect our Na-
tion. 
Since the earliest days of this coun-
try, we have been blessed by selfless 
men and women who have run toward, 
not away from, mortal danger. Driven 
by a profound sense of patriotism, they 
laid down their own lives to defend the 
freedoms that define our Nation. 
That level of courage is difficult to 
comprehend and impossible to repay. 
Therefore, we show our gratitude by re-
membering these heroes—their brav-
ery, their strength, and their hope— 
and also the sacrifices of the loved ones 
who have lost family members in uni-
form. 
One such hero is SFC John David 
Randolph Hilty from Bowie, MD. Ser-
geant Hilty was serving in Iraq in sup-
port of Operation Inherent Resolve, 
helping to defeat ISIL, when he died 
this past March 30, 2020. This was after 
completing three previous tours to Af-
ghanistan and earning several awards 
for his valiant service, including the 
Bronze Star Medal, Army Commenda-
tion Medal, and Joint Service Achieve-
ment Medal. 
Those who knew Sergeant Hilty re-
member him as a devoted son, husband, 
father, a tremendous leader, and a dear 
friend. I am thankful for Sergeant 
Hilty’s service to our country and so 
sorry for the loss of such a wonderful 
member of our community. 
We are forever indebted to the brave 
men and women like Sergeant Hilty 
who gave their lives to keep the rest of 
us safe. As President John F. Kennedy 
once said, ‘‘We must never forget that 
the highest appreciation is not to utter 
words, but to live by them.’’ All Ameri-
cans should be reflecting on the values 
that these men and women defended, 
and we must redouble our efforts to up-
hold them. 
Values like the freedoms to speak, 
worship, think, and dissent, values like 
equality, justice, and tolerance, values 
like truth and fairness, these are the 
pillars of the democracy that so many 
have died to protect. We honor their 
sacrifices by working together to build 
and preserve the America they fought 
to defend and support. 
Our citizen soldiers never need to ask 
what is in it for them. They know they 
answer life’s highest and most honor-
able calling. We should all remember 
the sacrifices that so many servicemen 
and service women have made defend-
ing our freedoms. My thoughts and 
prayers are with all the families in 
Maryland and across the United States 
who have lost loved ones protecting 
our Nation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, in 2015, 
when I heard then-candidate Donald 
Trump denigrate the service of my 
friend, the late Senator John McCain, 
suggesting that he was a loser and that 
his status as a POW was somehow 
cause for shame or embarrassment, I 
was rock-solid certain that the Amer-
ica I knew and loved would never allow 
such a man to occupy the office of the 
President. I was wrong. 
The McCain attack began a slow re-
veal of the unsurprising moral bank-
ruptcy of a man and the surprising 
willingness of Republican leadership to 
tolerate that moral void. The reveal 
reached a new level last week with Jef-
frey 
Goldberg’s 
reporting—signifi-
cantly verified by other reporters— 
that President Trump as Commander 
in Chief still denigrates the service of 
military members, calling them ‘‘suck-
ers’’ and ‘‘losers.’’ 
The Trump campaign protested loud-
ly against the charge, but in the same 
instant put out a social media message 
ridiculing Joe Biden as he visited the 
grave of his son Beau, an Iraq war vet-
eran, after church last Sunday. 
As a Member of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee and the father of a 
U.S. marine, I find President Trump’s 
attack on our military infuriating. In 
an era when his countrymen were risk-
ing their lives in Southeast Asia, the 
President dodged service with a timely 
and miraculously short-lived diagnosis 
of bone spurs. He bragged that his own 
personal Vietnam was trying to avoid 
sexually transmitted diseases at home 
while others were trying to avoid bul-
lets, landmines, and torture in Viet-
nam. The selfish young man who avoid-
ed service and then equated the ulti-
mate sacrifices of others with his sex 
life has now ascended into the world’s 
most powerful office holding on to 
those same immature views. 
It is not just about the President’s 
words and attitude. Solid intelligence 
suggests that Russia has paid bounties 
for the killing of U.S. troops in Afghan-
istan. The President and his team have 
spent time trying to deny the news to 
the American public with ridiculous ef-
forts to pretend that the President was 
never even briefed about the matter. 
The President still refuses to acknowl-
edge the gravity of the threat or hold 
Russia to account, but, of course, he 
has described Vladimir Putin as ‘‘a bet-
ter leader than Obama’’ and as a 
‘‘friend.’’ He must think: Why risk that 
friendship for suckers? 
After watching this President for 
years, I conclude that the attack on 
the military is part of a broader hos-
tility to the notion of serving others. 
The President stiffs charities, dis-
respects Federal employees, denigrates 
teachers, and undercuts programs like 
public service loan forgiveness. He 
treats the office as a personal piggy 
bank, filling staff positions with family 
members and cronies, steering business 
toward his resorts, making his main 
domestic priority a tax bill that dra-
matically benefited his own pocket-
book. The death, economic depression, 
deficits and social division that he has 
caused through his chaos hardly trou-
ble his conscience because he has the 
satisfaction of knowing that he has 
used the office to enrich himself. 
Is this the exemplar that we want for 
our country? President Trump may be 
unique among American Presidents in 
that no one holds him up as an example 
for America’s children. No parent or 
teacher or minister or youth mentor 
who I know tells children to act like 
him or talk like him or treat people 
like he does. Even his supporters, pro-
fessing support for his nominees and 
tax plan, have an instinctive under-
standing that he is not an example we 
would want our young people to emu-
late.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5499 
September 9, 2020 
Of all the critical issues on the ballot 
for America in November, the most im-
portant is the most elemental. Is 
America a place where the commit-
ment to serving others matters? Are 
we our brother’s keeper? Do we want 
our young to join the military or enter 
the Peace Corps or teach in our public 
schools? Is service just for suckers or is 
it the essence of American patriotism? 
Growing up, I was certain that I 
knew the answer to that question. I am 
less certain today, but I am infinitely 
more determined. 
Mr. CARPER. Would the Senator 
yield? 
Mr. KAINE. I yield. 
Mr. CARPER. I spoke earlier of my 
Uncle Bob. I forgot that we had his 
photo, but this is what he looked like 
at the age of 19 years 6 months, and 
this picture was framed and could be 
seen in the dining room of my grand-
parents’ house until they died. Along-
side it was my picture. Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. May I ask the Senator 
from Delaware a question? 
Did that young man lose his life in 
battle? 
Mr. CARPER. He was one of a num-
ber of sailors on the USS Suwannee who 
was killed in a kamikaze attack, and 
none of the bodies were ever recovered. 
Mr. TESTER. I want to thank the 
Senator from Delaware. 
You know, this isn’t the first time— 
this isn’t the first time the President 
has denigrated our military. It is not 
the first time and will not be the last 
time because there is a total lack of 
appreciation by this President of the 
people who serve our country in our 
military. 
I don’t have to talk about the bone 
spurs 
that 
gave 
him 
how 
many 
deferments? Five deferments? He found 
a way to not fight in Vietnam. Thank 
God his daddy had enough money to 
allow him to do that. 
Then we think back to John McCain, 
the decorated war hero. Oh, no, no, no, 
not in President Trump’s mind. It 
didn’t matter that he was a prisoner of 
war. He was no war hero, the President 
said. 
I am going to tell you, everybody in 
this body knew John McCain. Every-
body in this body probably had a scrap 
with John McCain and everybody in 
this body had the highest amount of re-
spect for John McCain. He truly was a 
war hero. 
Then there are the veterans who 
served in Vietnam, which Agent Or-
ange got the best of them. They are 
now in their seventies, and they are 
dying because of their exposure to 
Agent Orange. Let me tell you, the 
President denied them their benefits— 
denied them the benefits. If it wasn’t 
for this body and the House, they still 
wouldn’t have those benefits. 
Then there is the time that Vladimir 
Putin put a contract out on our mili-
tary. Did the President speak up? No, 
not to his good buddy Vladimir. No, he 
wouldn’t do it. 
Then there was the privatization of 
the VA. It cost Secretary Shokin his 
job because he said no, and in a bipar-
tisan way we said no. Well, it is time to 
say no again in a bipartisan way. This 
President has crossed the line. ‘‘Suck-
ers’’ and ‘‘losers’’ in our military do 
not belong in the same sentence, espe-
cially when you are talking about the 
‘‘greatest generation’’ in Europe who 
gave their lives for this country. 
It is time. It is time not for resolu-
tions that are political games, but it is 
time to tell this President that he has 
screwed up in a big, big way. If we 
don’t, it will affect this country’s fu-
ture long after he steps down from the 
Presidency. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of my distinguished colleague 
Senator DUCKWORTH and her resolution 
to honor our veterans, military serv-
icemembers, and their families. 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH
knows 
more 
than anyone in this Chamber about 
what it means to serve and to sacrifice, 
and I am honored to serve alongside 
someone who has given so much to our 
country—and I might add, she got her 
training in Alabama, down in Fort 
Rucker, where we have the training for 
all Army helicopter pilots. So thank 
you for that, and I hope you enjoyed 
your time, and we are going to get you 
back. Senator DUCKWORTH is but just 
one representative here with her many 
brothers and sisters in uniform who 
have worn the uniform throughout. 
Many in this body have served, and 
we heard a lot today about Senator 
McCain. I think few stand out as a 
military veteran more than our late 
colleague John McCain, the Vietnam 
veteran war hero, someone whom I 
served with but never, unfortunately, 
had the chance to meet. He was still a 
Member of the Senate by the time I got 
back here in January of 2018. His ill-
ness prevented him from coming to the 
floor. It will always be one of my great 
regrets that I could not have had at 
least 1 day on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate with John McCain. 
He was a Vietnam veteran and a war 
hero, but he dared to speak out against 
a President. And this President, to this 
day, 
almost 
2 
years 
after 
John 
McCain’s death, John McCain is the 
target of the President’s wrath. Two 
years later, and he still has comments 
about a war hero. 
I will tell you, to stand on the same 
floor at a moment like this, the same 
Senate floor where a hero like Senator 
McCain of Arizona spoke so passion-
ately on behalf of our military and on 
which Senator DUCKWORTH speaks so 
passionately about our military and 
our veterans, it is truly an honor. 
Today, the loss of John McCain’s 
voice in this Chamber is magnified by 
the silence of too many who will not 
say what needs to be said. Our military 
families and veterans deserve our full 
support. They don’t deserve insults. 
They deserve our support every day, 
not just when it is politically conven-
ient. It is the duty of this body and 
every Member of this body to defend 
those who have sacrificed so much to 
defend and protect our Nation. It is the 
obligation of all patriots in this coun-
try to do the same. In fact, true patri-
ots would never think to do otherwise. 
It would never cross our minds as true 
patriots—it would never cross their 
mind to launch an insult to our mili-
tary and our veterans, much less those 
who gave the ultimate sacrifice. It is 
what I do today and every day, as a 
Senator from Alabama, to honor our 
military—to honor them because I 
come from a State of heroes: Alabama. 
I worked for one of those heroes. He 
was a military hero who later became a 
distinguished Member of this body 
from 1979 to 1997. Howell Heflin distin-
guished himself as a Marine officer in 
the brutal fighting of the Pacific the-
ater of World War II, where he was 
wounded twice, awarded the Purple 
Heart and the Silver Star for Valor, 
and retired at the rank of major. I am 
so honored to be in his seat today 
where I worked for him as a young 
staffer so many years ago. 
He, too, would rise in this Chamber 
in support and defense of our military. 
I know. I was here. I watched him. I 
saw him over the years. I was with him 
in every campaign. He was a tireless 
proponent of a strong military and un-
derstood Alabama’s tremendous con-
tributions to our Nation’s defense, 
something I try to carry on in his 
stead. 
As Alabama’s Senator, Howell Heflin 
may have been called many things in 
the heat of politics, but none would 
have ever called him a sucker or a 
loser. None would have ever questioned 
his patriotism. Even though Alabama 
has a strong private sector supporting 
our Nation’s military, no one would 
have ever accused him of simply pro-
moting the business of defense contrac-
tors with his strong and unwavering 
support of defense spending to make 
America safe and secure. 
You know, they are the less than 1 
percent of Americans who have volun-
teered to risk their lives, to be away 
from their families, their loved ones, 
for weeks and months at a time, to up-
root their families every few years and 
move, to put themselves in dangerous 
training, in physical and mental strain, 
and put themselves in harm’s way 
when they are deployed in combat. Yet 
they ask for so little in return. That, 
folks, is the definition of selflessness. 
While at one time I worked directly 
for a military hero in this body, today, 
as a U.S. Senator, I work for thousands 
of them—tens of thousands across 
America but, importantly, in the State 
of Alabama. I say Alabama is a State 
of heroes because it is true. Our sons 
and our daughters enlist and serve our 
Nation in numbers that far exceed our 
State’s population, and I am so proud 
of that. 
In Alabama alone, there are 27,000 
men and women who serve either on

Active Duty or in the Guard or Re-
serve. Alabama is home to 377,000 vet-
erans. That is a lot of folks in a State 
of my size. Not quite 10 percent of the 
population are veterans. 
The point here is that families in 
Alabama know what it means to see a 
loved one raise their hand and stand 
ready to make the ultimate sacrifice 
for their country. I have stood witness 
and nominated our best and our bright-
est to military academies in the 2 
years that I have been here. We have 
been able to get over 40 of Alabama’s 
best and brightest high school students 
into our military academies—40. And I 
watched with pride in how they became 
members of the military and how their 
families were so proud of them, not 
ever dreaming that one day, if they 
lost their life, the Commander in Chief 
of the United States might refer to 
them as a loser. I can assure every 
American that among the folks I know 
of, there are no suckers, and there are 
no losers. What every volunteer from 
Alabama, enlisted or officer, has in 
common is a deep and abiding love for 
our country. 
As a member of the Armed Services 
Committee, I have had the honor to 
meet some of these folks overseas. I 
have traveled with my friend and col-
league Senator REED. I have met with 
folks from Alabama. I have felt their 
pride in the job that they were doing in 
Afghanistan and Iraq. They feel it deep 
down because that is the core of a pa-
triot; that is the core of American val-
ues. 
We owe each of them not just our 
gratitude but our commitment to serve 
them as they are serving or have 
served us. We have a duty to uphold 
our promises to care for them and their 
families, to provide good healthcare, to 
help them get an education and transi-
tion to good jobs after service. We have 
a duty to honor them with action and 
with humble appreciation. We should 
have the decency and sense of patriot-
ism not to denigrate their service, es-
pecially if you have avoided making 
such a sacrifice yourself. 
Over the past 2 years, I was fortunate 
to know a little bit better what it real-
ly means to serve and to sacrifice while 
I was working on the elimination of 
the military widow’s tax. I got to know 
people like Cathy Milford from Mobile, 
AL, and so many others whose late 
spouses had served honorably. I was 
shocked to learn that for decades they 
had been denied full survivor benefits 
that their spouses had earned because 
the Federal Government wanted to 
save a few extra bucks. That our coun-
try could allow such an injustice to 
occur for nearly four decades is uncon-
scionable, and we set out to change it. 
Cathy used to talk about how she 
came up here every year, and she would 
say that every time she would argue 
for the elimination of the tax, it was 
like digging up her husband from the 
grave. 
Sadie McCormack’s husband passed 
away in a training accident in South 
Korea some 3 years ago. She has two 
kids at Auburn University, including a 
daughter who is the recent Miss Pea-
nut for the Dothan area, where Fort 
Rucker is located. Sadie is a Gold Star 
wife who became a strong advocate of 
the military widow’s tax issue. She had 
to go back to work teaching school to 
pay the bills because of that widow’s 
tax. 
Lois Thompson of Dothan is the 
widow of Army CW4 Richard Thomp-
son, who retired after 35 years and 1 
day of service. He retired in 1991 and 
died on March 18, 2013, having suffered 
from ALS for more than 6 years. He 
served two tours of duty where he 
waded into streams contaminated with 
Agent Orange. Senator TESTER spoke 
about the denial of benefits to those 
who have suffered because of their con-
tamination with Agent Orange. 
Mrs. Thompson is 85 years old, and 
she was his caretaker during his ex-
tended illness. She said: My husband 
served two tours in Vietnam, wading in 
streams of Agent Orange. The war was 
so unpopular he couldn’t wear his uni-
form home and was spit on upon ar-
rival back to the States. Our soldiers 
were often not treated right, even 
these days. 
I agree with Mrs. Thompson, and that 
is coming down from the Commander 
in Chief. So, let me make this clear. 
The sacrifice made by these women and 
men and their families is incalculable, 
and for far too many years we have 
failed to do our duty and keep our 
promise to those heroes. So I am so 
glad that with a bipartisan effort in 
this body and in the House—bipartisan, 
bicameral—we were able to correct 
that in last year’s defense budget. 
Unfortunately, I cannot say that I 
am surprised by reports that the Presi-
dent called Americans who died in the 
war losers and suckers. It seems to be 
just the latest in a series of comments 
he has made that demonstrate a lack of 
respect for those who serve. That re-
spect goes far beyond simply putting 
money into our defense and our mili-
tary. It goes to your patriotism. It goes 
to your heart. It is easy to put money 
into something. It is easy to do those 
kinds of things, especially when you 
have an Armed Services like we have 
here in the Senate that works in such 
a bipartisan fashion. It is a whole dif-
ferent thing to really talk in the pri-
vacy of only a few people about what 
you really believe. 
I can’t say I am surprised that com-
bat-wounded veterans make him so un-
comfortable that he would ban them 
from military events and parades. They 
are reminders of his own failure to 
serve when called upon. I am not sur-
prised, but I am deeply disappointed— 
deeply disappointed. Our troops deserve 
a Commander in Chief who understands 
or, at the very least, appreciates their 
service. 
As of yesterday, 52,143 Americans 
have been wounded in Operation Iraqi 
Freedom and Operation Enduring Free-
dom, and 6,784 Americans have given 
their lives for those two missions. 
Many more have been deployed, often 
repeatedly, bringing home experiences 
and memories that are going to impact 
them for the rest of their lives. Their 
dedicated families have served along-
side them through every step of the 
way. Few among us—few among us— 
can truly understand this kind of sac-
rifice for a cause greater than our-
selves. But what we should all be able 
to understand is that they deserve our 
respect, our gratitude, and our unwav-
ering efforts to uphold our promises to 
them and their families. 
So, as I conclude, I stand here today 
and think about those sacrifices, the 
pain that John McCain lived with, the 
pain that TAMMY
DUCKWORTH
lived 
with, the honor with which he and she 
and Howell Heflin served and all of 
those who have served and sacrificed 
over the years—all those families and 
all those who serve today—and it is 
stunning to me that the only sacrifice 
that we in this Chamber may suffer for 
our vote today is to suffer the wrath of 
a President because we stood in sup-
port of them and not him. After all 
they have done—say what needs to be 
said—we have to support them and not 
fear a baseless tweet from the Presi-
dent. A baseless tweet is simply not 
too high a price to pay for doing what 
is right by our military and our mili-
tary families. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to 
express my strong support for the Sen-
ate resolution sponsored by Senator 
DUCKWORTH, which condemns the deni-
gration by President Trump of our Na-
tion’s Armed Forces and veterans. I 
also 
want 
to 
commend 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH for her extraordinary and 
heroic service as an Army aviator. She 
inspired all of us with her courage and 
her sacrifice. 
In a September 3 article in The At-
lantic, Jeffrey Goldberg catalogued a 
list of disparaging comments President 
Trump has made about members of the 
U.S. military and wounded warriors. 
Such remarks are not unusual for this 
President, and most are public knowl-
edge. However, we should not become 
numb to such behavior, so some of the 
comments bear repeating. 
The Atlantic article states that the 
President refused to visit the Aisne- 
Marne American Cemetery in France, 
the final resting place of 2,289 Ameri-
cans who died in battle, ensuring our 
freedom and the freedom of our allies 
against the march of totalitarianism, 
authoritarianism, fascism, and com-
munism over the past century. He re-
fused to visit because he said the ceme-
tery was filled with ‘‘suckers and los-
ers.’’ 
Several years ago, in planning a mili-
tary parade to honor himself, he re-
fused to include wounded war veterans, 
stating ‘‘no one wants to see that.’’ 
When he visited the grave of Gen. John 
Kelly’s son who died in Afghanistan at

the age of 29 and is buried in Arlington 
National Cemetery, he wondered to 
General Kelly why his son joined the 
Marines: ‘‘What was in it for him?’’ 
When impressed by a presentation by 
Gen. Joe Dunford, then the Chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he asked 
his staff why such a talented person 
would join the military. 
Donald Trump is a man who cannot 
conceive of service to others before 
oneself. His view of the world is trans-
actional. The only thing of value to 
him is money—not ideals or principles 
or the lives of our fellow Americans. He 
simply doesn’t understand the words of 
one 
of 
his 
predecessors, 
President 
George Herbert Walker Bush, who said: 
On this day, we must tell the stories of 
those who fought and died in freedom’s 
cause. We must tell their stories because 
those who’ve lost loved ones need to know 
that a grateful Nation will always remem-
ber. We must tell their stories so that our 
children and grandchildren will understand 
what our lives might have been like had it 
not been for their sacrifice. 
Donald Trump does not think deeply 
about what it means to be in the mili-
tary; to be deployed in a battle zone, 
wondering if every day would be your 
last day; to be a family member wait-
ing anxiously at home; to be a young, 
healthy person suddenly disabled or a 
Gold Star family who wakes every day, 
mourning their lost son or daughter 
but understanding the great cause they 
died for. Donald Trump only cares 
about the next ‘‘win’’ for himself, his 
fortune, or his popularity. 
Donald Trump deferred service in 
Vietnam five times, including one 
deferment for a diagnosis of ‘‘bone 
spurs,’’ which is remarkable, given the 
propensity he has to play golf, given 
such a debilitating injury. He has said 
that those who served in Vietnam were 
‘‘suckers’’ for not finding a way out, 
never able to acknowledge that his 
privilege of birth and race were largely 
responsible for being able to avoid 
service in that war. 
Furthermore, President Trump, true 
to his character, has doubled down and 
denigrated the military service of past 
Presidents and military officers, in-
cluding, as has been referred to repeat-
edly, Senator John McCain, my close 
colleague on the Armed Services Com-
mittee and my chairman. 
He referred to Senator McCain as a 
‘‘loser’’ when he died and wondered 
why the Nation should honor him with 
flags lowered to half-staff. He said he 
prefers those who were never captured 
in war. He would prefer those who 
never served to a man like Senator 
McCain, who survived over 5 years in a 
Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp, who 
refused to leave his comrades behind 
when given the chance, and who en-
dured well-chronicled torture and hu-
miliation that made him an inspiration 
to so many. In fact, one of the most 
moving moments in my life was to be 
in the Hanoi Hilton with John McCain 
and to have Senator McCain talk about 
the torture, the humiliation, and the 
degradation that he endured each day 
but maintained his courage and his 
commitment to this Nation. 
The President also does not under-
stand the good order and discipline 
that are the hallmark of a military in 
a democracy, ensuring that our mili-
tary men and women remain firmly 
tethered to our Nation’s moral and eth-
ical principles in the most demanding 
wartime environments. That is why he 
saw nothing wrong with intervening in 
the legal process to pardon a service-
member accused of war crimes. That is 
why he was able to stand on the steps 
of the White House and make com-
ments intended to drive a wedge be-
tween the men and women in uniform— 
the junior officers who enlisted and 
their senior leaders—impugning the 
motives of senior military officers who 
have dedicated their lives to the serv-
ice of the country and who have bled, 
in some cases, for this country. 
Never in this Nation’s history has a 
President held the military and those 
who served in such disdain and dis-
regard—never. His support for the mili-
tary is hollow. He touts pay raises that 
were scheduled to happen anyway and 
congressional 
increases 
in 
defense 
spending for readiness which he then 
diverts to build an ill-advised and 
wasteful wall on the southern border. 
He falls short in caring for our men and 
women in uniform and their well-being 
and lives—and thinks instead of how 
they might be useful to him to further 
his own interests and image. 
Donald Trump cannot relate to those 
who serve in the Armed Forces or un-
derstand what would motivate them to 
choose the harder road of a life of serv-
ice, of discomfort, and the arduous ex-
perience to defend this Nation. 
While I know that every American, 
especially those in uniform, listens to 
the words of the President, it is my fer-
vent hope that our uniformed per-
sonnel do not take the President’s 
words on this issue to heart. As a per-
son who has had the privilege to have 
led paratroopers, I can tell you there is 
no greater honor to be among those 
who serve and protect our Nation, who 
sacrifice every day so that Americans 
can live in freedom and peace. 
As President Theodore Roosevelt fa-
mously said: 
The credit belongs to the man who is actu-
ally in the arena, whose face is marred by 
dust and sweat and blood, who knows the 
great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and 
spends himself in a worthy cause; who at 
best, if he wins, knows the thrills of high 
achievement, and, if he fails, at least fails 
daring greatly, so that his place shall never 
be with those cold and timid souls who know 
neither victory or defeat. 
I guess President Trump would say 
‘‘the losers.’’ 
Our men and women in uniform, who 
fight, die, and are wounded for our Na-
tion and its ideals, are in the arena, 
not President Trump. As all other pub-
lic servants who are trying to make 
our country a better place, they—par-
ticularly those in uniform—deserve all 
the credit. A President who is proud 
that he has always stood on the side-
lines and denigrates them does not de-
serve much credit. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor our veterans and 
servicemembers. 
I thank Senator REED for his beau-
tiful remarks and his service, as well as 
Senator CARPER. I also thank Senator 
DUCKWORTH, who is leading our efforts 
today, as she has led for so long. 
As I listened to my colleagues, I 
know 
that 
many 
of 
them 
were 
couching their remarks in the history 
of people. I literally could imagine 
John McCain right now walking up and 
down that aisle, crossing the aisle, 
coming over, working with people, 
slapping people on the back. That is 
how much he loved this place and how 
much he loved our country. 
I remember the silent, courageous 
fortitude of Danny Inouye, and I re-
member so many of those whom I 
crossed paths with, like Senator Dole. 
I think the reason we talk about that 
history is because we know that this 
argument and this cause is based in 
history. Our democracy is based in his-
tory. The idea that people serve is 
based in history. They don’t serve for 
themselves. They serve, in the words of 
Senator McCain, for a cause larger 
than themselves. That is why I picture 
those who served before us, just like 
our soldiers do when they sign up to 
serve. 
The brave men and women who have 
served in our Armed Forces represent 
the best among us. Whether you served 
decades ago or you still wear a uniform 
today, we owe you a debt of gratitude 
for your service and sacrifice on behalf 
of our great Nation. 
All 
servicemembers 
and 
veterans 
have something in common. Wherever 
they are politically, they have some-
thing in common. Regardless of when 
and where they served, they have 
something in common—a deep love of 
our country and a very real under-
standing of what it means to serve and 
sacrifice. They deserve a Commander- 
in-Chief who loves our country in the 
same way and for the same reasons and 
has that same deep understanding of 
why those soldiers signed up to serve. 
Unfortunately, as my colleagues have 
pointed out, the person currently en-
trusted to be the Commander in Chief 
of our brave service men and women, 
according to many, many recent re-
ports, including things he has actually 
said on TV, has made repeated com-
ments denigrating their service, ques-
tioning their judgment, and belittling 
those who were prisoners of war or who 
made the ultimate sacrifice in service 
to our country. 
Yes, I will never forget what he said 
about Senator McCain when he died, as 
Senator McCain’s friend, JACK REED, 
just recalled. I, too, stood in front of 
that 
cell 
in 
Vietnam 
with 
John 
McCain, where he had been held. When 
you stand there and you think about

the fact that he made the decision to 
allow others to be released before 
him—that is courage. 
What does it say to our servicemem-
bers when a Commander in Chief can-
cels a visit to an American cemetery in 
France because, according to one re-
port, he feared his hair would be ruined 
by the rain? What does it say, as re-
ported in The Atlantic, when he ques-
tions the value of paying his respects 
to fallen Americans by claiming serv-
icemembers killed in the service of this 
country are ‘‘losers’’ and ‘‘suckers’’? 
What does it say when he expressed his 
contempt for not just John McCain, 
who spent more than 5 years as a pris-
oner of war, but also accuses former 
President George H. W. Bush of being a 
‘‘loser’’ for being shot down by the Jap-
anese as a Navy pilot in World War II? 
Finally, what does it say to our troops 
when the President refuses to publicly 
condemn, warn, or even criticize Vladi-
mir Putin following news reports that 
Russia offered bounties for the killing 
of members of our Armed Forces and 
our coalition partners? 
Our servicemembers are always there 
for us, and we must be there for them. 
Even when our Nation is divided, we 
must still collectively reject any at-
tempt to diminish their service. 
We learned that in a big way after 
Vietnam. I remember standing at one 
of our Serving Our Troops events in 
Minnesota a few years ago. That is 
when our restaurants and the commu-
nity come together—sometimes thou-
sands of people—to serve the families 
of the troops who are serving overseas 
a steak dinner, all donated, and at the 
same time, the troops are somehow 
getting the same dinner. It is an ex-
traordinary event. Many of us volun-
teer to work on the lines. One day 
when I was there, there was a Vietnam 
vet, and he was serving up mashed po-
tatoes. He had a Vietnam hat on, and I 
said: Thank you for your service. 
He said: When I came home, I was 
greeted with tomatoes. I don’t want 
this to ever happen to another soldier 
again. That is why I come here every 
year to volunteer. 
We learned back then that you can 
have major disagreements about war 
and war policy, but you do not take it 
out on the warriors on the frontline. 
Sadly, right now, we have a Com-
mander in Chief who takes out every-
thing on everyone, including personal 
vendettas against people like Senator 
McCain. Rather than being silent as, 
sadly, too many have been in reaction 
to his comments, I think we must 
stand up. I think the way that we 
honor their service and sacrifice is 
being very clear that we condemn the 
remarks that the President has made. 
I will end with this. The last time I 
saw Senator McCain I was at the 
ranch. He was in his last months of 
life. My husband and I went there and 
sat with Cindy and with John. At the 
very end, he was getting tired, and he 
wasn’t talking much anymore. He was 
having trouble talking anyway. He 
pointed at one of his books. I picked it 
up, and that is when he pointed, with-
out saying the words, to that sentence: 
‘‘There is nothing more liberating in 
life than fighting for a cause larger 
than yourself.’’ That is what unites our 
troops when they sign up to serve. That 
is what should unite us in this Cham-
ber right now. 
I urge my colleagues to join in this 
effort so that our men and women in 
uniform, across the United States and 
around the world, know that we will 
not remain silent. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I want 
to start by thanking the Senator from 
Minnesota for her remarks just now. 
I rise with her and to join Senator 
DUCKWORTH and our colleagues in re-
sponding to the shameful comments 
that President Trump reportedly made 
about our servicemembers. 
I want to begin by thanking Senator 
DUCKWORTH for leading us in this effort 
and for her service to our country, as I 
thank all of the Members of the U.S. 
Senate and all of the staff of the U.S. 
Senate who have served their country 
and all of their families. 
One 
of 
our 
Nation’s 
greatest 
strengths is the countless Americans 
who, throughout our history, have been 
willing to sacrifice everything to keep 
us safe and preserve our freedom. 
In New Hampshire, we are proud to 
be home to a high percentage of serv-
icemembers, veterans, and their fami-
lies. In my experience, people in my 
State—and all across the country—re-
vere the bravery and sacrifices of those 
who serve and those who have served. 
We may disagree about policy mat-
ters, including those that impact when 
and where servicemembers are de-
ployed, but the respect that we have 
for servicemembers, veterans, and their 
families must be undisputed. 
It is the President’s duty to honor 
the sacrifices of our troops, to care for 
them, to support them and their fallen 
comrades. The role of the President of 
the United States of America is not 
just limited to being the Commander 
in Chief. Presidents should also lead by 
example and represent the values of 
the American people. 
Unfortunately, President Trump has, 
yet again, expressed his disdain and 
lack of understanding of why people 
sacrifice for our freedom and democ-
racy. This is a failure of leadership, 
and it is a failure of basic citizenship 
that is out of step with most Ameri-
cans. 
Last year, I joined a bipartisan group 
of Senators to travel to burial grounds 
in both France and Belgium, as we paid 
our respects to our World War II fallen 
servicemembers. It was the honor of a 
lifetime. It was also deeply personal, as 
my dad served in the Battle of the 
Bulge. 
Standing on those hallowed grounds 
was a powerful reminder of the loss of 
war, of those heroes who gave every-
thing to fight against fascism and to 
protect freedom. 
We owe these heroes our profound 
gratitude and our deepest respect. Yet, 
when speaking of servicemembers who 
were killed or captured, the President 
referred to these heroes as ‘‘suckers’’ 
and ‘‘losers.’’ For such words to come 
from the President of the United 
States is an affront to all that we stand 
for, and it is beneath the office that he 
holds. Unfortunately, these comments 
were not surprising given the Presi-
dent’s long line of denigrating com-
ments against those who have served, 
including 
the 
late 
Senator 
John 
McCain, Gold Star families, and other 
American heroes. 
The resolution that we are intro-
ducing 
today 
recognizes 
the 
unmeasurable debt that we owe to 
those who have valiantly served our 
country, as well as their families. This 
resolution condemns the repeated dis-
respect that this President has be-
stowed upon them. My colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle have seen the 
hurtful comments President Trump has 
made about members of our military. 
Every single one of us should condemn 
them. 
I will close with this: My father 
didn’t talk about his service in World 
War II very often, but he did talk about 
his unit, a group of men who came 
from as diverse backgrounds as our 
country is large. They had their dis-
agreements. They didn’t agree on poli-
tics. But they came together every day 
to win that war. 
Of course, they knew that their lives 
depended on their unity, their cohe-
sion, but they knew something else 
too, and this is what my dad always re-
minded us of. Sometimes, at the break-
fast table, he would look up at us and 
say: ‘‘What are you doing for freedom 
today?’’ It was a question he had the 
right to ask because he was remem-
bering his unit of men from all over the 
country, from all different life experi-
ences, who knew that freedom, their 
country—our 
country—the 
United 
States of America, is worth fighting 
for. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today, the day before 
we will be voting on a piece of legisla-
tion to deal with relief for people, for a 
country, dealing with coronavirus. I 
come to the floor today as Americans 
are looking to us, the U.S. Senate, to 
provide relief in this ongoing battle 
against this disease. 
Republicans, as you well know, are 
offering a path forward. That is what 
the American people want. They want 
a path forward. So tomorrow, the Sen-
ate Republicans will move a targeted 
bill, a bill to help people get back to 
work, to help kids get back to school, 
and to deal with and put the disease in 
the rearview mirror.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5503 
September 9, 2020 
It is interesting, in watching all of 
the things that unfold in the U.S. Sen-
ate and in the Chamber, that Demo-
crats continue to be playing political 
games. The Democratic leaders in the 
House, as well as the Senate, have held 
up this round of coronavirus relief just 
as they held up the last round of 
coronavirus relief. 
You say: Where is the roadblock? 
Well, I will tell you. Senator SCHUMER 
and Speaker PELOSI
have been the 
roadblocks to relief for the American 
public. The Speaker has demanded a 
multi-trillion-dollar blank check to 
pursue her liberal agenda. It is a liberal 
wish list, no strings attached. You can 
go through all of the things that she 
has asked for. Even the New York 
Times said it was a liberal wish list, 
and that is the New York Times real-
izing that it wasn’t a serious piece of 
legislation. 
Yet, just last week, when Speaker 
PELOSI was asked about it and all of 
the things that are in it, she said: 
‘‘We’re not budging.’’ Her statement: 
‘‘We’re not budging.’’ 
At the same time, as you look at 
what is happening in the country, Pres-
idential nominee Joe Biden seems to 
be, ever so slowly, coming out of his 
hiding place in the basement. His an-
swer to coronavirus, when the press 
asked him about this a week or so ago 
when he just edged out of the basement 
just a little bit, he said he would shut 
down the entire country again. 
That is not what they want in Wyo-
ming. That is not what they want in 
your State, Mr. Presiding Officer. That 
would be a recipe for disaster. But that 
is what the former Vice President, the 
nominee of the Democrat Party, has 
said he would do: shut down the coun-
try again. We have seen, time and time 
again, Democrat leaders shrink in the 
face of adversity. Republicans are fac-
ing challenges head-on. 
It was interesting that, a couple of 
weeks ago during the Democrat con-
vention, Joe Biden didn’t even mention 
the violence that was plaguing Demo-
crat-run cities all across the country. 
Not a single one of the Democrat 
speakers at their convention men-
tioned the destruction and the looting 
and the rioting and the violence. Dem-
ocrat mayors, Democrat Governors, 
through their words and their actions, 
are encouraging these riots that are de-
stroying our cities. They have surren-
dered to the leftwing mob, and, as a re-
sult, violent anarchists rule the streets 
in a number of the cities run by liberal 
mayors. 
In Portland, OR, police officers have 
been viciously attacked for 100 days. 
Innocent people have been murdered in 
cold blood. We have seen small busi-
nesses looted, torched—a lifetime of 
work up in flames. 
Democrat 
mayors 
are 
tying 
the 
hands of law enforcement, it appears to 
me, and liberal city officials are 
defunding the police, calling to defund 
the police, voting to defund the police. 
Clearly, they have refused to allow the 
police to do their job. It is an incred-
ibly dangerous situation, and it is a 
complete lack of leadership by Demo-
crats. 
Republicans 
would 
defend, 
not 
defund, the police. The burning, the 
looting, the rioting—this must stop. 
People are fleeing the liberal cities, 
and they want to move to States like 
ours. Even some Democrat mayors are 
fleeing their own homes. Portland’s 
mayor is moving out of his condo 
building to escape the riots. St. Louis’s 
mayor has temporarily relocated from 
her home, and the mayor of Chicago, 
interestingly enough, has banned pro-
tests on her block while doing nothing 
to protect the rest of the city, where 
the number of fatalities and where vio-
lence and murder are breaking records 
at an alltime high. 
People expect their elected leaders to 
keep them safe, but, really, the Demo-
crats need to get their priorities right. 
They don’t have them right. Americans 
need safety and security so they can 
get back to a normal routine in their 
lives. 
There really is some good news to re-
port, and that is both with regard to 
coronavirus and with regard to the 
economy. Last week, the Wall Street 
Journal reported that coronavirus is 
starting to retreat, that positivity 
rates fell 40 percent from July, that 
hospitalizations were down 60 percent, 
and the good news is that researchers 
are reporting that they are on track to 
produce a safe, effective vaccine in 
record time. 
As a doctor, I will tell you this truly 
is record time when I think of how long 
it took—years and years—for vaccines 
to be developed. Now, we are not out of 
the woods yet, but we are making sig-
nificant progress and moving ahead at 
warp speed. 
That is one of the things that is 
going to be on the floor tomorrow with 
this vote, as we work to get people 
back to work and kids back to school 
and the virus behind us, is more money 
and effort for testing and for treatment 
and for vaccine development and dis-
tribution. 
The economic news is good. Joe 
Biden says he would shut down the 
country again, and this country is 
opening up and doing remarkably well. 
The economy added nearly 1.4 million 
jobs in August alone, 10 million new 
jobs in the last 4 months. The unem-
ployment rate fell to below 9 percent— 
8.4 percent. That is down from a pan-
demic high of close to 15 percent. 
It is interesting. The experts had it 
all wrong. The experts said that, head-
ing into the fall, we would have an un-
employment rate at over 16 percent. It 
is now down to 8.4. I compare this to 
the economic recovery that took so 
long when President Obama and Vice 
President Biden were running the econ-
omy. We had an unemployment rate of 
over 9 percent for 30 months in a row— 
over 9 percent for over 30 months. This 
time, with the unemployment rate, we 
are already below 9 percent at 8.4. 
So the economy is rebounding, the 
virus is receding, but still there is 
hardship around the country, and that 
is why we will tomorrow vote on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate to deal with 
the needs of the American people; yet 
NANCY PELOSI and the Democrats in 
Congress remain focused on a different 
agenda, and I believe their misguided 
priorities will hurt, not help, Ameri-
cans. 
It is interesting, when I listen to the 
Speaker of the House, even over 100 
Democrats wrote her and openly com-
mented that they should be able to be 
allowed to vote on a targeted piece of 
legislation. She refused to listen to 
them. 
But we were home for the last period, 
listening to folks all around my State 
and your State, and what did we hear 
them say? They said: We still need help 
with paycheck protection for our small 
businesses so they can continue to 
make payroll. NANCY PELOSI says no. 
CHUCK SCHUMER says no. 
They said: We want to get our kids 
back to school so we can go back to 
work and our kids will not fall so far 
behind. NANCY PELOSI has said no. My 
concern is that, tomorrow, CHUCK 
SCHUMER will say no as well. 
People at home said: We need a vac-
cine. We need more testing. We need 
treatments. It sounds like, tomorrow, 
the Democrats may say no to that as 
well. 
I look at the list of the things that 
the Democrats are proposing: more 
money for sanctuary cities, direct pay-
ment checks to illegal immigrants, 
issues relating to immigration and cus-
toms enforcement. That is just the tip 
of the iceberg. At the same time, with 
their misplaced priorities, they are 
blocking justice reform. They did that 
to the TIM SCOTT justice reform bill 
that every one of the Republicans co-
sponsored. They blocked it and refused 
to even allow it to come to the floor for 
discussion. They are ignoring crime. 
Clearly, the leftwing of the Demo-
cratic Party has taken the wheel and 
has taken a sharp left turn and is head-
ed right off a cliff. 
The Democrats’ misguided priorities 
lie in stark contrast with Republicans’ 
forward-looking plan. We have targeted 
coronavirus relief. It is a bill that will 
help our students, will help our work-
ers, will help our families, will help 
people with the disease. 
The Senate legislation sensibly ex-
tends small business paycheck protec-
tion support to help keep people on the 
payroll. It ensures that we beat the dis-
ease with the money that we have 
talked about. It gives the schools the 
tools they need and continue to need to 
reopen smartly and safely so our kids 
will not be left behind. 
I come to the floor to say the con-
trast is clear. What we are hearing 
from the opposite side of the aisle are 
empty Democrat promises, and Repub-
licans are delivering on ours. Senate 
Republicans are going to stay focused 
on governing. We are going to do the

job the American people elected us to 
do. 
The choice could not be clearer: Re-
publicans on a path forward or Demo-
crats with their ongoing partisan ob-
struction. 
I appreciate your time and your at-
tention in this critical time as we 
move forward with the bill that the 
American public is asking us to pass, 
that we have Republicans supporting, 
that fills the needs and responds di-
rectly to the needs of the American 
people. At the same time tomorrow, we 
will see if the Democrats continue to 
obstruct or work with us on the solu-
tion and a path forward for our Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, over 
the past several weeks, I have had the 
opportunity to visit with Colorado 
families and businesses across the four 
corners of our great State, talking 
about the challenges that Colorado 
faces when it comes to our economy as 
a result of the pandemic, talking about 
the health challenges that have been 
created for our State and so many of us 
around the world when it comes to the 
pandemic and the work that needs to 
be done and the work that this Con-
gress needs to do to come together to 
stop the partisanship, to stop the fight-
ing, to stop the arguing, and actually 
develop real solutions for the people of 
this country. 
Congress has done that time and 
time again over the past several 
months. If you go back to March 6, the 
passage of the Coronavirus Prepared-
ness and Response Supplemental Act, 
that was signed into law that day. That 
is the first action that this Chamber 
took when it came to coronavirus re-
sponse. March 18, a couple of weeks 
later, Congress passed the Families 
First Coronavirus Response Act. That 
was signed into law March 18. These 
were unanimous consent bills—many 
times unanimous consent, but had the 
support of every Republican and every 
Democrat. The work we were doing was 
so evident, and we needed to do it im-
mediately. 
March 27, as economies were shutting 
down, as restaurants were closing, as 
hotels were closing, Congress passed 
the CARES Act—the Coronavirus Aid, 
Relief, and Economic Security Act. It 
was signed into law on March 27. This 
is when you started to see some of the 
partisanship that was developing as 
that bill’s passage was delayed in the 
Senate. Nonetheless, it passed, deliv-
ering trillions of dollars in support for 
the American people, support for un-
employment 
benefits—creating 
new 
categories of help for people who had 
seen their jobs eliminated, furloughed, 
or hours reduced—support for farmers 
and ranchers, support for a vaccine, 
support for education, mass transit, 
telemedicine, and beyond—trillions of 
dollars, almost a year’s worth of appro-
priations, a year’s worth of funding in 
one bill, to help make sure that we 
were meeting the needs of the Amer-
ican people. 
The actions that we take can be fo-
cused, at least the way I see it, through 
three primary lenses: No. 1, what we 
were doing to make sure we are stop-
ping the spread and flattening the 
curve of coronavirus; No. 2, making 
sure that we are helping individuals 
who are in need, who are worried about 
how they are going to meet their rent 
payments, how they are going to make 
their mortgage, making sure that they 
are going to be OK. 
The third filter, the third lens of ac-
tions that we need to takeis to go back 
to our businesses and making sure they 
are able to keep people employed, mak-
ing sure they keep their doors open, 
making sure that our economy can 
snap back to its full strength and even 
stronger than ever once the health pan-
demic is over. 
We passed the Paycheck Protection 
Program and Health Care Enhance-
ment Act on April 24 to provide addi-
tional dollars for the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program. We passed legislation 
that would extend the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program into August, which 
changed the way some of the payments 
are able to be made within that time 
and what expenses could be utilized 
within that timeframe. 
We passed the Great American Out-
doors Act, which will create thousands 
of jobs across the State of Colorado— 
100,000 jobs across this country. 
We continue to do more work. There 
is no alpha and omega legislation when 
it comes to a coronavirus. There is no 
one single package of legislation that 
we can walk away from, spike the foot-
ball and say: Our job is done here. 
We passed one bill, two bills, three 
bills, four bills—and we will continue 
to do more because the American peo-
ple need it, and the American people 
need that support. 
I met with a restaurant owner in 
Pueblo, CO, who talked about the re-
strictions they are facing at their res-
taurant. They can have only 50 people 
in their restaurant regardless of social 
distancing. They can have only 50 peo-
ple in their restaurant. They have a 
bar in their restaurant, but because 
they are a restaurant, they can have 
only 50 people. The bar down the road 
can have 100 people in it because they 
are a bar, but the restaurant can have 
only 50 people because they are a res-
taurant, even though they have a bar. 
They are trying to figure out and un-
derstand the regulations, the guidance 
they are under, making sure their cus-
tomers are safe, making sure their em-
ployees can be paid, making sure they 
survive this and get through this. 
This is what the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program represents. That is what 
the help we passed with unemployment 
benefits means. It is to help people get 
through this so that we can get back 
on our feet as a country. I met with 
farmers in Eastern Colorado who were 
struggling to find help, who couldn’t 
find the labor that they needed, who 
saw challenges to their prices before 
coronavirus. They saw challenges be-
cause of coronavirus to their supply 
chains and what was happening to the 
markets. The CARES Act provided aid 
and relief to many in agriculture 
across the State of Colorado, but there 
is more work to be done. 
I met with schools across the State 
of Colorado that are trying to open, 
that are trying to figure out the best 
way to keep their students safe and 
their teachers safe and make sure they 
can stay open. Some were doing online 
learning; some were doing in-person 
learning. All of them were trying to 
figure it out. 
The CARES Act and other pieces of 
legislation we passed provided billions 
of dollars for our educational institu-
tions from kindergarten to 12th grade 
on up through higher education—bil-
lions and billions of dollars—but more 
work needs to be done. 
My wife turned to me a couple of 
weeks ago before our three children 
started school and said: It is time for 
spring break to end. Our kids have been 
out since spring break in March. A 
week ago, they did start, but there are 
people and families across the State of 
Colorado who are unsure about wheth-
er their classes will continue in person. 
Maybe they never got that far. 
We have to make sure we are pro-
viding help with childcare, making 
sure families have a place where they 
can take their kids when they go to 
work. In a country where more and 
more families have both parents in the 
workplace, it is very difficult to con-
tinue that job and to do it effectively 
when you don’t have childcare. We 
have all this supply problem where we 
don’t have enough places for families 
to take their kids and we have a de-
mand challenge where you have people 
who need to take their kids to daycare 
because their schools aren’t open. The 
CARES Act and other legislation we 
passed addressed that need. There is 
more work yet to do. 
I have heard from my colleagues 
across the aisle that they support the 
Paycheck Protection Program and that 
they support funding for businesses so 
that they can keep people employed, so 
that businesses can hire people and get 
them to return to work because we 
made a decision that it is better to 
have people on the job at the work-
place than in the unemployment insur-
ance office. We passed the Paycheck 
Protection Program. Look at these 
numbers in Colorado. We have a total 
loan amount of over $10 billion that 
went to Colorado alone to help make 
sure that businesses were staying open, 
that they could keep people on the pay-
roll, that they could survive the orders 
to shut down that came from mayors 
and the States and the President. We 
did it out of love for our community to 
make sure that we could stop the 
spread, flatten the curve, and get 
through this together. As a result, we 
have an obligation to make sure that

our economy comes back and that we 
help those businesses and those indi-
viduals through this to make sure our 
Nation gets back on its feet. The legis-
lation that we passed has done part of 
that. 
If you look back to May 15, you think 
about an economy that lost 20.5 million 
jobs. The unemployment rate as of May 
15 was 14.7 percent. Today, just a week 
ago, it is 8.4 percent, with more work 
that needs to be done. 
I have heard from my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle that there is 
a need to support childcare and a need 
to support education, a need to support 
our efforts to get a vaccine, a need to 
support efforts to continue research, a 
need to support the post office. I have 
heard from our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle that there is a need to 
make sure we have unemployment ben-
efits that continue for the American 
people. 
I completely agree that we should 
make sure the Paycheck Protection 
Program continues. We should make 
improvements to the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program and make sure we im-
prove the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram so that it benefits more busi-
nesses so that unrepresented commu-
nities have better access to the Pay-
check Protection Program, that we get 
more people involved in unbanked and 
underbanked 
communities—nontradi-
tional lenders—so we can get the Pay-
check Protection Program out to them 
and save more jobs and get more people 
to work. I completely agree. Let’s work 
together, and let’s pass that. 
There are people who aren’t as fortu-
nate. There are people who have lost 
their jobs. There are people who have 
seen their hours reduced, and they are 
terrified about how they are going to 
make ends meet, about what they are 
going to do for their job and their fam-
ily. The bills don’t stop. They keep 
coming, and they have to be paid. We 
should help them. We should pass un-
employment insurance benefits. We 
should pass unemployment benefits to 
help the American people. Let’s vote 
on that. Let’s do that. Let’s make it 
happen. 
We should help people who need 
childcare. Let’s make sure we are fund-
ing childcare. Let’s pass it tomorrow. 
Let’s pass it tomorrow to provide bil-
lions of dollars for childcare services. 
We don’t have to wait; we can pass it 
now. 
We should provide additional assist-
ance to our farmers and ranchers. 
Thank goodness that we have the abil-
ity to produce our food in the United 
States. Imagine what would happen if 
we were reliant for 70 percent of our 
food on somebody else, like China. We 
have seen what happens in this country 
when we are reliant on China for our 
medications and for other personal pro-
tective equipment. Imagine if we relied 
on our food coming from somewhere 
else to the same extent. 
We are blessed that we have farmers 
and ranchers who wake up each and 
every day and work hard to put food on 
our table, but they are struggling right 
now. Let’s help them. We don’t have to 
wait. We don’t have to wait another 
week or another month. We can pass it 
and vote on it tomorrow—$20 billion 
for our farmers and ranchers. 
We should continue our work on vac-
cines. I had the chance to stop at the 
University of Colorado to visit with Dr. 
Tom Campbell to learn about the trial 
that is taking place at the University 
of Colorado School of Medicine on the 
Anschutz Campus. They are working 
with the Moderna vaccine there, mak-
ing sure that it goes to those who need 
it to get the best representative sample 
of how we can get the vaccine to suc-
ceed, to work, and get it into our com-
munity, but we need more help. We 
need more work. We need more re-
search and development dollars. Let’s 
vote on $31 billion on activities like 
vaccine development and distribution. 
Let’s make that happen now—$16 bil-
lion for testing and related contain-
ment efforts. 
Let’s build up a personal protective 
equipment stockpile once again. We 
know we need it. Let’s vote on it. Let’s 
vote on that tomorrow—$16 billion. 
Let’s pass it. 
This $105 billion is more money than 
the House of Representatives passed. 
There is $105 billion for education—for 
K–12 and for higher education. We have 
heard the need from our teachers. We 
have heard the need from our colleges. 
Let’s pass that tomorrow in the bill 
that we are going to be voting on to 
provide that help. We don’t have to de-
bate; we don’t have to delay. We can 
pass it tomorrow. 
The post office—I live in rural Colo-
rado, and my grandfather was a rural 
letter carrier. I remember as a child 
traveling with him on county roads out 
in Yuma County, delivering mail. Let’s 
provide $10 billion to the Postal Serv-
ice to make sure they have the re-
sources they need because it matters in 
rural Colorado. We can pass that to-
morrow. 
We are going to have a chance to 
vote on it tomorrow. Let’s pass it. 
Let’s make it happen. Let’s get it done 
now. 
Everything here that we are voting 
on tomorrow—$105 billion to support 
students’ 
safe 
return 
to 
in-person 
learning and educational opportunities, 
that is in the bill we are going to be 
voting on tomorrow. That $105 billion 
is more than the House of Representa-
tives asked for. 
There is $16 billion for testing and re-
lated containment efforts in the bill. 
Let’s vote on that tomorrow. 
There is $31 billion in vaccine and de-
velopment distribution, $20 billion in 
farm assistance, $15 billion to support 
childcare services, changes to the Pay-
check Protection Program that will 
allow for a second loan. 
I met with restauranteurs in Denver 
and across Colorado who said that the 
Paycheck Protection Program is what 
kept them in business. I met with 
Mother Pearl in Colorado Springs—a 
Cajun restaurant—where they said: 
This saved us. 
But they are still struggling. They 
are not up to full capacity yet. Let’s 
give them a chance to get a second 
loan through the Paycheck Protection 
Program so that they can bring their 
employees back, keep their employees 
employed and paid, and get their doors 
open and through this. 
Let’s simplify the loan forgiveness 
application process so that people who 
have $150,000 or less have certainty and 
clarity about what is going to happen 
to that loan. If you look at Colorado, 
the vast majority of the loans that rep-
resent $10.5 billion in Paycheck Protec-
tion Program loans—95,000 loans were 
below $150,000 in Colorado; 95,000 busi-
nesses could have certainty that their 
loan is forgiven. Let’s pass that. Let’s 
pass that tomorrow. That is in the bill. 
There are enhanced unemployment 
benefits of $300 a week. The State could 
contribute up to $400 a week, lasting 
through December at the end of this 
year. We can pass that tomorrow. It is 
in the bill. 
Ten billion dollars in assistance to 
the post office is in the bill. 
Every single point that we have made 
here is supported by my colleagues. 
They want money for education. We 
are giving more money to education 
than the House of Representatives 
passed. They want dollars for testing. 
They want dollars for vaccine and dis-
tribution. They want dollars and help 
and support for farm assistance. They 
want dollars for childcare. They want 
dollars for the Paycheck Protection 
Program. They want to keep businesses 
open and people employed and people 
hired. They want to help people and 
businesses have more certainty in how 
their loans are going to be handled. 
They want additional unemployment 
benefits for the American people, and 
they want help for the post office. 
There is not a single person who has 
come to the floor and said: I oppose 
money for higher education. They 
haven’t done that because they agree. 
They agree with us. They agree with 
the testing and the research for the 
vaccine. They agree with support for 
childcare. They agree that we need to 
do it. 
Maybe somebody wants more. We 
passed one, two, three, four, five, six— 
this could be the fifth, sixth, or sev-
enth bill, depending on how you count 
the various pieces of legislation that 
have gone toward coronavirus relief. 
We will do more, and we should do 
more. 
But why on Earth would you vote no 
tomorrow and tell the people of this 
country to go pound sand because you 
didn’t get everything you wanted? Why 
would you tell the people who are on 
unemployment benefits and need it 
now: I am sorry, but I didn’t get a tax 
deduction for wealthy people in Cali-
fornia or New York so you are not get-
ting yours. Why would you tell the peo-
ple who need the dollars in education

to support our kids and our teachers: I 
am sorry, but you are not getting 
yours because somebody has a nice 
house in Los Angeles who needs a tax 
cut. Why would you tell businesses 
that they may not be able to keep their 
doors open because that house in Man-
hattan is really nice and you want to 
make sure they keep their big house 
tax deduction? 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle would have you believe that 
the American people can wait for un-
employment benefits, that they can 
wait for more help for businesses. They 
would have you believe that they don’t 
need to vote yes on this, even though 
they agree with it. The American peo-
ple expect us to do our jobs. The Amer-
ican people have the chance to see this 
Congress work not in a bipartisan fash-
ion tomorrow but in a nonpartisan 
fashion—getting back to the very be-
ginning of the work we did together to 
pass legislation to benefit and help the 
American people, who acted out of love 
to stop their economies because they 
wanted to stop the spread of the 
coronavirus. They shut their busi-
nesses and their hotels emptied out all 
because they were complying with ef-
forts to socially distance in order to 
end this pandemic. 
We have a chance tomorrow to vote 
on a bill that will provide unemploy-
ment benefits that will help people in 
ranch communities—that will provide 
them with billions of dollars in aid— 
but they are saying no because they 
didn’t get everything. Their theory 
seems to be, if I can’t get everything I 
want, you don’t get anything, period. 
Is that the message the American 
people are going to get tomorrow, that 
it is their way or the highway? You are 
not going to get the help that every-
body agrees on because I just didn’t get 
everything that I thought I should. 
Look, our family business is a farm 
equipment 
dealership, 
and 
I 
have 
talked about it many times on this 
floor. I have never seen somebody come 
into that dealership and say, ‘‘My trac-
tor is broken. I would like a Repub-
lican to fix it,’’ or ‘‘My planter needs 
to be repaired. Can you please find a 
Democrat to fix it?’’ That is not the 
way people come into the store in our 
economy and do business. 
They 
don’t 
go 
into 
Target 
or 
Walmart that way. They don’t go to 
that restaurant in Pueblo, in Colorado 
Springs, or in Denver and ask, ‘‘Could 
you serve me the Republican meal 
today, please, made by a Democrat 
cook?’’ They expect us to get the job 
done. 
There are some in this Chamber who 
argue that, if we just delay a little bit 
longer, we will put a big, big package 
together. 
Vote 
tomorrow. 
Bring 
amendments. Have the debate. Don’t 
hide behind closed doors and argue 
that, if we just hold out a little bit 
longer, maybe my tax cuts will come 
for that mansion in Beverly Hills or for 
that place in the Hamptons. 
That is what they are doing. That is 
what they are doing to the American 
people. They are saying, even though 
we agree, because we didn’t get our 
way, no one gets their help, that no one 
gets the help they need because they 
didn’t get their way on everything. 
Tomorrow’s vote isn’t a final vote by 
any means, and even if it were, there is 
more work to be done. We will have ad-
ditional pieces of legislation that we 
will continue to provide relief for, but 
tomorrow is the beginning of the de-
bate. It is the first step in making sure 
that we have that for the American 
people; yet they are going to say no. 
They are going to vote no. They are 
afraid to debate. They won’t even bring 
amendments. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
has saved millions of jobs around the 
country. We have a chance to extend it, 
to make it work for more people. Un-
employment insurance has expired. 
Look, we worked over August to make 
sure we had an extension of unemploy-
ment insurance and unemployment 
benefits for the people of Colorado and 
this country, as well as payroll tax 
breaks and help with rent. This was 
over the last several weeks. We need to 
act to extend it, and we have a chance 
to vote on it tomorrow. 
Vote yes, and we can provide that re-
lief. Vote no, and you are telling the 
American people that politics is more 
important than policy, and that is 
wrong. If this body is interested in re-
sults and policy, they will vote yes to 
provide this relief that everybody 
agrees on. 
Some people find the politics of pan-
dering and partisanship way too in-
triguing, inviting, and alluring. The 
American people find it sickening. 
Vote yes. Get on this bill. Bring your 
amendments. Have the debate. Let the 
American people know that relief is on 
the way—or vote no and continue this 
shameless charade of people who pos-
ture about helping the American peo-
ple but who are simply interested in 
the electoral outcome. 
This vote is going to tell us a lot 
about people tomorrow. This vote is 
going to tell us about people who are 
interested in finding that way to relief 
for the American people—the oppor-
tunity is here—or is it going to simply 
be a chance to provide yet one more 
grandstand, yet one more finger-wag-
ging, tongue-wagging opportunity for 
the American people to see how embar-
rassing the debate has become? 
The people of Colorado are strong, re-
silient, and optimistic. They see opti-
mism in every vale and valley as they 
work to climb that next peak, but they 
need partners to help them, and we 
have a chance tomorrow to vote to pro-
vide that help. 
Do not be fooled by arguments that 
this doesn’t do enough. We can do 
more, and we will do more, but let’s 
start with the unemployment benefits 
now. Let’s start with the business help 
now to keep people employed. Let’s 
start with the vaccines and the re-
search now. Let’s start with the help 
for education now without delay. 
Tomorrow, I hope the outcome is a 
surprise, and I hope that we will see 
people come together in a way that we 
saw at the beginning of this debate. 
There is always more to be done. 
I ask unanimous consent to have a 
letter printed in the RECORD following 
my remarks that I wrote on April 16, 
with my colleague Senator BENNET and 
Governor Polis, that asks for more to 
be done. 
In this letter, we talk about the need 
for State and local funding—a half a 
billion dollars for State and local fund-
ing. We also talk about other pro-
grams, including additional benefits 
for food nutrition. I still support that. 
I am still fighting for that. I still want 
to do those things we listed in this let-
ter, but I am not going to let that stop 
me from voting yes tomorrow because 
the American people need it. 
I hope that my colleagues will stop 
the partisanship, stop the gamesman-
ship, stop the power hungry approach 
to politics. Put it aside for the Amer-
ican people. Do what is right for the 
American people. Vote yes. I am deliv-
ering this critically important relief to 
our country so that we can stand 
united, as our country has stood united 
for months, and get through this to-
gether. 
In the weeks before the economy 
shut down and we could no longer go to 
church in person, we were reviewing a 
passage in the Bible which read that 
out of our struggles and tribulations 
comes perseverance, that out of that 
perseverance is built character, and 
that out of that character comes hope. 
We can provide that hope tomorrow. 
The American people deserve nothing 
less. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
April 16, 2020. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
LEADER
MCCONNELL
AND
LEADER 
SCHUMER: As you work to extend and build 
upon the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco-
nomic Security (CARES) Act, we write to re-
quest certain modifications and improve-
ments to the programs that were included in 
the law. We kept these requests focused on 
the areas under negotiation as we under-
stand them including small business reforms, 
state and local funding, health care, and food 
assistance through the Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program (SNAP). 
Since the CARES Act became law, we have 
spoken with Coloradans across the state 
about the Paycheck Protection Program 
(PPP), including small business owners, 
farmers, and non-profit directors. It is clear 
that we should provide additional funding for 
the PPP, but we should also modify the pro-
gram to ensure it is providing support for as 
many small businesses and non-profits as the 
program was originally intended. 
Through our conversations, we believe the 
following modifications and additions to the 
PPP can help fix the very real-on-the-ground 
issues preventing many small businesses 
from participating in the program: 
Increase the program appropriations and 
the loan amount to 4 times average monthly 
payroll (permitting those that already have

loans to increase their loan amount to reach 
that level) for firms that have suffered sig-
nificant revenue losses as a result of the 
COVID–19 public health emergency; 
Increase the amount that can be spent on 
non-payroll expenses for firms that have suf-
fered significant revenue losses as a result of 
the COVID–19 public health emergency; 
Expand eligibility as follows: 
Expressly provide that health care enti-
ties, such as quasi-governmental Critical Ac-
cess Hospitals and other rural health care 
providers, are eligible to participate in the 
program; 
Include certain nonprofits who should not 
have been excluded in the first place, subject 
to the applicable affiliation rules; 
Expand the exception to the 500-employee 
limitation for franchises, which is contained 
in the Small Business Administration (SBA) 
guidance, to include franchised businesses 
beyond those listed in the SBA’s franchise 
listing; and 
Expand the affiliation rule exception to in-
clude more firms that, for all intents and 
purposes have fewer than 500 employees, 
such as fitness centers and retail trade es-
tablishments. 
Expressly provide that, following the re-
cently-issued SBA guidance regarding dis-
tributions from partnerships and LLCs (up to 
$100,000 annualized), existing PPP loans that 
excluded such payments may increase their 
loan amounts accordingly; 
Add the following to list of qualified ex-
penses: mortgage principal payments in ac-
cordance with previously-established amorti-
zation schedules (no pre-payments), inven-
tory expenses in advance of re-opening busi-
nesses, and past-due inventory invoices; 
Expressly provide that businesses can par-
ticipate in both the PPP and EIDL loans, 
provided that funds are not spent on the 
same expenses; 
Set aside PPP funding to support our 
smallest businesses; as well as minority-, 
veteran-, women-owned, and other under-
served businesses that may not have an ex-
isting business banking relationship; 
Expressly provide that Community Devel-
opment Financial Institutions (CDFIs) are 
authorized lenders under the program; 
Authorize the Treasury Department, the 
Federal Reserve, and/or the SBA to purchase 
program loans for borrowers with 50 or more 
employees from the originating banks two 
weeks after origination; and authorize the 
appropriate entity purchase program loans 
for businesses with less than 50 employees 
immediately after origination; and 
Ensure that small agricultural producers 
who employ individuals under the H–2A pro-
gram can have their payroll expenses count 
for loan forgiveness purposes. 
In addition to the PPP modifications, the 
Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Pro-
gram that was included in the CARES Act 
has been oversubscribed. The intended goal 
was to have these loans paired with the PPP 
in order to provide businesses a greater 
amount of liquidity. It has been clear in our 
communications across the state that the 
program is oversubscribed and EIDL needs 
significantly more funding and improved ef-
ficiency to get the funding more quickly into 
the economy. The CARES Act required EIDL 
advances of up to $10,000 per loan to be deliv-
ered immediately, but the oversubscription 
has caused the SBA to limit the amount of 
those advances and they have been slow in 
arriving. EIDL borrowers simply cannot wait 
for weeks for approval on minimal advances. 
We must make sure the program is fully 
funded so it can be useful for businesses. 
We must also work to provide health care 
providers, both those on the frontlines and 
those struggling with lost revenue, the sup-
port they need. We request additional fund-
ing through the Public Health and Social 
Services Emergency Fund (PHSSEF) to sup-
port hospitals and health care providers in 
the next phase of legislation. We must also 
ensure that there is a transparent and evi-
dence-based process in place to provide relief 
to rural hospitals and health clinics, Med-
icaid providers, including home and commu-
nity-based services providers, children’s hos-
pitals, nursing homes, providers treating un-
documented patients, and safety net hos-
pitals and clinics who provide critical, life- 
saving care to underserved populations and 
were not addressed in the Department of 
Health and Human Service’s initial $30 bil-
lion tranche of funding from the CARES Act. 
Further, state and local governments and 
tribes are on the front lines of responding to 
the crisis. The CARES Act included $150 bil-
lion for these entities from the Coronavirus 
Relief Fund and tens of billions of additional 
support for education and housing needs. In 
addition to direct federal support for edu-
cation, housing, and public health needs, it 
is critical that Congress provide an addi-
tional $500 billion in flexible fiscal relief to 
states and hundreds of billions of additional 
support directly to local governments with-
out population thresholds and with the flexi-
bility to fill major revenue shortfalls. We re-
quest robust funding to ensure further flexi-
ble relief in the next legislative response. In 
fact, any interim agreement between the 
leaders must include this critical state and 
local funding. 
Lastly, we are deeply disturbed by the se-
vere deprivation so many families are experi-
encing, manifested in scenes of hours-long 
lines at food banks across the country. To al-
leviate some of the pressure on the hardest- 
hit families, we support increasing overall 
SNAP benefits by 15% and continuing that 
increase until the public health crisis has 
ended and the economy has returned to pre- 
crisis conditions, along with other reforms 
to SNAP to cut red tape and expand access 
to nutritional assistance. 
Colorado is representative of America. We 
have remote rural communities and large 
urban areas. We depend on the agriculture 
industry, but we also have some of the most 
cutting-edge technology companies in the 
world. We are known for our restaurants, ho-
tels, and outdoor recreation. Those indus-
tries are supported by countless plumbers, 
electricians, 
and 
contractors. 
And 
like 
America, we have our differences, but above 
all, Coloradans are pragmatic—we do what 
works. The ideas laid out in this letter re-
flect what Coloradans have told us is needed 
to make these programs work. We should 
waste no time in adopting them. 
We thank you for your work on behalf of 
the American public. We believe that we 
share the common goals of keeping thou-
sands of small businesses across Colorado 
and the nation with the ability to retain as 
many workers as they can, our hospitals and 
health care providers equipped with what 
they need, and state and local governments 
and tribes with the ability to respond during 
this pandemic. Should you require additional 
information on these suggestions, our staffs 
are able to further discuss. As you negotiate 
the next federal response, we respectfully re-
quest you include these modifications to the 
CARES Act and additional requests in mind. 
Sincerely, 
CORY GARDNER, 
United States Senator.

REMEMBERING KATHY BROWN 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to remember one of Wyoming’s 
most accomplished and beloved jour-
nalists. On Wednesday, August 12, 2020, 
Kathleen 
‘‘Kathy’’ 
Suzanne 
Brown 
passed away at the age of 64. In her 
nearly 40 years as a reporter at the Gil-
lette News Record, Kathy had a pro-
found impact on communities across 
northeast Wyoming. 
Kathy spent more than 20 years of 
her time at the News Record as a 
sports reporter. She was notably the 
only female sports reporter in the 
State for most of that time. Kathy was 
known for being an extremely thor-
ough reporter. She went above and be-
yond to profile a majority of Campbell 
County’s student athletes, whether or 
not they were the star player. 
When Kathy transitioned to being an 
education reporter in 2012, I often had 
the privilege of speaking with her on 
my regular visits to classrooms around 
Gillette. Kathy was a true professional, 
and it was abundantly clear how much 
she cared for the students she wrote 
about. 
Her dedication to journalistic excel-
lence was recognized statewide on mul-
tiple occasions. One of the biggest 
highlights of her career came in 2016, 
when the Wyoming Press Association 
named her its Veteran Journalist of 
the Year. Kathy was also recognized by 
the Campbell County School District, 
the Energy Classic Committee, the Wy-
oming Education Association, and the 
Wyoming Historical Society for her ex-
cellent work. 
While her passing leaves a huge void 
in the Wyoming journalism commu-
nity, her legacy lives on through her 
more than four decades long record of 
compelling and insightful stories. 
Bobbi and I send our deepest condo-
lences to Kathy’s mother, Shirley

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5508 
September 9, 2020 
Brown; brothers, Tim, Ben, and John, 
as well as her newspaper family at the 
Gillette News Record. 
On August 14, 2020, Gillette News 
Record publisher and editor Ann Tur-
ner published a moving tribute to 
Kathy on behalf of the entire News 
Record staff who knew Kathy best. 
Ann’s sentiments are shared by so 
many in Gillette and Wyoming’s jour-
nalism community. I ask unanimous 
consent that this article be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Gillette News Record, August 14, 
2020] 
LONGTIME NR REPORTER KATHY BROWN DIES 
(By Ann Turner) 
Few people in a community have the privi-
lege of intersecting with so many lives as a 
reporter. 
No one in Gillette has done it recently as 
long and as well as Kathy Brown, who was a 
reporter for the News Record for 37 years. 
‘‘KB,’’ as we called her, died Wednesday 
night in Casper at the Central Wyoming Hos-
pice and Transitions of complications from 
cancer, a disease she had valiantly fought for 
the past 13 months. She was 64. 
She had retired from the News Record in 
March after working as a journalist for 41 
years. 
In a perfect world, there would have been a 
proper send-off, a party or an open house to 
properly acknowledge the decades that she 
devoted to this community. Instead, we 
faced a national shutdown aimed at pro-
tecting everyone from the COVID–19 pan-
demic, but particularly those like KB whose 
health was compromised by cancer and the 
chemotherapy she undertook to try to beat 
it. 
She restarted the chemo after a much-too- 
short remission and was bound and deter-
mined to beat it. 
In a perfect world, she would have beat it. 
In a perfect world, there would have been 
more stories that she could have written 
about all of you, her favorite people. In a 
perfect world, she would have enjoyed her re-
tirement. 
But the world is not perfect. 
Today, we honor her with a front-page 
obituary, not because she would have wanted 
it—indeed she would have been appalled at 
the attention. 
We do so because she deserves it. 
In Gillette, she spent more than 20 years as 
a sports reporter, and in those years covered 
thousands of young athletes in the school 
system as well as younger and older ones in 
different athletic pursuits. 
Kathy was the sole sports reporter at the 
News Record—and the only female sports re-
porter in the state—for most of that time. 
No one worked longer and harder than she 
did because she was committed not just to 
her job, but to the kids. 
She made an effort to talk to every single 
athlete on a team—not just the stars, but 
every single one. She tried to make sure that 
they appeared in a story over the course of a 
season because she believed that each one of 
them deserved attention as part of the team. 
Each athlete, competing alone or on a team, 
had a story that deserved to be told. 
A criticism that haunted her most would 
be those that came from some disgruntled 
parent who thought she was giving one play-
er too much attention. In sports coverage, 
it’s hard to ignore the stars. But her admira-
tion often was focused on those whose efforts 
were just as noteworthy, if not as splashy. 
‘‘Always talk to those involved in events, 
not just a coach or teacher,’’ she wrote in 
notes she handed out to younger journalists 
who wanted to listen to her advice. ‘‘You can 
use the coach or teacher’s comments to build 
on what you’re writing, but the athletes or 
the students are the ones who are involved in 
it. They have a lot to say, too, and shouldn’t 
be ignored.’’ 
In 2012, she moved from the sports beat to 
education and the community section. The 
move was made for health reasons, but she 
ended up working just as hard covering those 
beats as she did sports. 
She was a prolific writer and still holds the 
byline record at the News Record. There was 
never a topic too small, but there were some 
that she could write reams about, usually in-
volving her love of history, particularly 
local or Western history. 
She once decided to write about the Pump-
kin Buttes, a story that originally was sup-
posed to anchor the front page. 
She wrote so much that it ended up being 
a special section. 
That was true of the Recreation Center 
when it opened 10 years ago. The story was 
supposed to be a comprehensive look at what 
the new facility was like. 
It ended up being a 28-page special section 
with multiple stories, all written in a very 
short amount of time by KB. 
In both of those cases, just like with most 
stories she wrote, she approached them with 
an enthusiasm that is rare. 
‘‘I’m sucking the life out of this interview 
in three different ways,’’ she once said about 
an interview with one of the National High 
School Finals Rodeo contestants. 
She loved journalism because no two days 
are alike. ‘‘Every day is a new adventure,’’ 
she said in 2017. 
She also loved it because it put her smack- 
dab in the middle of people and their stories, 
which is where she liked to be. 
‘‘I really feel it’s a privilege to cover the 
stories of the people in Campbell County and 
to be able to tell about their lives,’’ she said. 
She has been honored many times for her 
reporting and her leadership. Three years 
ago, she was chosen as Veteran Journalist of 
the Year by the Wyoming Press Association, 
an occasion that made her reflect on her ca-
reer, as well as to find humor in the ‘‘vet-
eran’’ part of the name. 
‘‘Heck,’’ she said. ‘‘It’s just one for old 
farts.’’ 
‘‘I want to tell the stories we all want to 
read—the important ones that teach us 
about life, ourselves and our community at 
the same time,’’ she said at the time. ‘‘No 
one else can tell the story of a community as 
well as a newspaper, so it’s a service to a 
community and a calling to those of us on 
the job.’’ 
It was her humility that made her sum up 
the award by saying, ‘‘I guess it means I’m 
doing OK at the job.’’ 
That prompted a reply from frequent letter 
writer Brad Schofield. 
‘‘In my opinion, the ability to ‘write and 
relate’ is not only a gift she has shared and 
worked so hard to achieve, it is a dedication 
to a life of serving a people and a community 
she obviously loves and respects,’’ he wrote. 
A newspaper contest judge once called KB 
‘‘a consummate pro.’’ And she was. People in 
Gillette were lucky to have her on their side 
for 37 years. 
We were even luckier to be able to call her 
a colleague. Even more so a friend.

TRIBUTE TO KENDRA SMITH 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize Kendra Smith of 
Nashua as August’s Granite Stater of 
the Month. At a time when so many 
are 
facing 
financial 
uncertainty, 
Kendra is selflessly working to provide 
substantial and popular hot meals to 
community members in need amid this 
public health and economic crisis. 
Kendra has lived in Nashua for 29 
years and knows her community well. 
As a food service assistant in New 
Hampshire’s school system and an en-
trepreneur who founded a soul food cui-
sine catering business early last year, 
Kendra is exceedingly familiar with 
how food insecurity affects children 
and teenagers in Nashua. 
When schools began to shut down due 
to COVID–19, Kendra knew that many 
students in her community were at

risk of going hungry without school- 
provided meals. Kendra, whose back-
ground in catering and food service has 
given her plenty of practice serving a 
lot of food on a tight budget, started a 
program to help get hot meals to those 
in need. 
Feed the Children is a nonprofit orga-
nization that Kendra started through 
her catering company, Soel (Simply Of-
fering Edible Love) Sistas, LLC. Her 
organization is fueled by the gen-
erosity of people in her community, 
who support the effort by, among other 
things, making small donations and 
holding food drives. 
Twice a week, Kendra and her team 
drive to neighborhoods around Nashua 
and distribute hot meals to families in 
need, while following social distancing 
guidance. Menu items include burgers, 
chicken and rice bowls, chips, granola 
bars, and fruit. 
Food insecurity affects communities 
across our State and our country, and 
in times like these, it is especially im-
portant that we come together to sup-
port those in need. I am proud to recog-
nize Kendra’s initiative, generosity, 
and pragmatism in naming her August 
2020’s Granite Stater of the Month. She 
exemplifies the best of New Hampshire 
and shows what can be done when we 
come together as a community during 
challenging times.∑

TRIBUTE TO DAVID ABNEY 
∑ Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, one of 
America’s founding principles is the 
belief that anyone of any background 
can achieve anything with hard work, 
perseverance, and a positive attitude. 
This belief is the very foundation of 
the American dream. 
Mr. David Abney, who is retiring 
after over 40 years at Georgia’s own 
UPS, is the epitome of the American 
dream. 
David grew up in the Mississippi 
Delta, which is one of the most eco-
nomically challenged areas in the 
country. Yet David didn’t let his cir-
cumstances determine his fate. From 
an early age, David worked odd jobs to 
help support his family while making 
sure he kept his grades up at school. 
This dedication paid off when he got 
into Delta State University on scholar-
ship, where he met his future wife, 
Sherry. 
At the age of 19, while working as a 
package loader at UPS to pay for his 
education, a manager recognized Da-
vid’s talent and work ethic and encour-
aged him to join the company full 
time. Although he didn’t realize it at 
the time, this encouragement trans-
formed David’s life. It was then that 
David became, as they say, ‘‘brown- 
blooded,’’ devoting his career to UPS. 
Although he had found his profes-
sional home, the road ahead wasn’t al-
ways easy. The work could be grueling. 
He moved around a lot. He often put in 
difficult hours. However, just as he had 
diligently worked his way into college, 
David worked his way up the ladder. 
What has always made David an ex-
ceptional leader is his devotion to the 
people who work for him. Having done 
the work himself, David understood the 
needs and challenges of his employees, 
and he always put their needs over his 
own. In one case, when the center he 
managed experienced difficult times, 
David laid himself off so that his em-
ployees could keep their jobs. 
This selfless, employee-oriented lead-
ership style eventually propelled David 
to the highest levels of leadership at 
UPS. He became COO in 2007, CEO in 
2014, chairman of the board in 2016. 
Under David’s leadership, UPS has 
grown into one of the most exceptional 
logistics companies in the world. He 
guided UPS through major changes, 
adapting to the new needs of the dig-
ital world. He focused on strengthening 
the company’s diversity and inclusion 
practices, so that anyone, of any back-
ground, would always find a home at 
UPS just as he had. 
Today, UPS supports hundreds of 
thousands of jobs and helps our econ-
omy grow and thrive every day. 
The values of hard work, optimism, 
and service to others that have guided 
David’s life are infused into the com-
pany that he has led. For example, dur-
ing the COVID–19 crisis, UPS helped 
manage logistics to deliver critical aid 
to those who needed it. UPS workers 
put their own health and safety at risk 
to serve their communities. 
David’s devotion to serving others 
extends beyond UPS. He has helped 
support local businesses as the chair-
man of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of 
Commerce. He served on the board of 
Catalyst, which works to bring women, 
particularly women of color, into sen-
ior leadership positions. He frequently 
supports his alma mater, so that the 
next generation of bright young stu-
dents can find success no matter where 
they come from. 
As David Abney prepares to retire 
from UPS this year, he will be leaving 
an incredible legacy of excellence, 
growth, and selfless service. He has 
made UPS, the State of Georgia, and 
the entire country a better place. 
It is my pleasure to wish David, his 
wife Sherry, and their entire family 
the very best.∑

REMEMBERING RONNIE LOPEZ 
∑ Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor the I life of Ronnie 
Lopez, a beloved men to, and commu-
nity leader in Arizona. Lopez is inti-
mately known around the Valley by 
many for his efforts championing pub-
lic policies and civic engagement for 
Phoenix’s Latino community. 
Born in the small mining town of 
Miami, AZ, Ronnie was raised along-
side his two older brothers by his hard- 
working mother, who cleaned houses 
and worked in the area mines to pro-
vide for their family. Ronnie’s profes-
sional career in Phoenix began in them 
id 1960s as a field representative for the 
Arizona State Civil Rights Commis-
sion, where he investigated discrimina-
tion allegations. Shortly after, Ronnie 
extended his expertise to Chicanos Por 
La Causa, an organization dedicated to 
supporting 
underserved 
Latinos 
in 
Phoenix, and was elected justice of the 
peace in West Phoenix. In 1978, Ronnie 
accepted a position to serve on the 
staff of Arizona Governor Bruce Bab-
bitt, where he championed better hous-
ing and education for the Latino com-
munity. In the many years that fol-
lowed, Ronnie ran his own consulting 
firm—working with government lead-
ers, businesses, and public campaigns 
to facilitate change for Arizonans in 
need. In what free time he had left, 
Ronnie endeavored to mentor many of 
Arizona’s young public servants, some 
of whom serve as elected officials 
today. Above all else, those who had 
the pleasure of working with Ronnie 
will remember him for his selflessness. 
Please join me in honoring life of 
Ronnie Lopez, a devoted leader, men-
tor, and personal friend whose impact 
will not be forgotten.∑

REMEMBERING DR. GABRIEL 
LO´ PEZ-PLASCENCIA 
∑ Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor the life of Dr. Gabriel 
Lo´pez-Plascencia—Dr. Lo´pez—a well- 
known physician from metro-Phoenix 
who practiced medicine for over six 
decades. Dr. Lo´pez was the primary 
physician for many low-income fami-
lies living in Phoenix’s underserved 
communities. 
Born in Jalisco, Mexico, Dr. Lo´pez 
attended the University of Guadalajara 
before eventually moving to the United 
States and enlisting in the Arizona Na-
tional Guard as a medical officer. He 
served the Arizona Guard for 20 years, 
retiring as a lieutenant colonel. Even 
the he continued to support and col-
laborate with the Guard through addi-
tional activations until the mid 1990s. 
In addition to his military service, Dr. 
Lo´pez made a point to make his serv-
ices available to indigent populations 
in South Phoenix, where poverty has 
affected predominantly Latino commu-
nities for decades. As an active Mexi-
can American, he was also one of the 
founding members of the Mexican 
American Chamber of Commerce in 
Phoenix. Dr. Lo´pez’s community-ori-
ented spirit, expertise, and dedication 
to service contributed to the health of 
many Arizona working families and al-
lowed them to seek the American 
dream just as he did many years ago. 
Please join me in honoring the life of 
Dr. Gabriel Lo´pez-Plascencia, a pas-
sionate doctor, surgeon, and servant to 
Arizonans, who will be dearly missed. 
The impact Dr. Lo´pez has left in our 
hearts, his community, and our State 
will be felt eternally.∑

September 9, 2020 
the National Forests in North Caro-
lina. Mr. Nicholas has served for over 
30 years and has been a living embodi-
ment of the National Forest Service’s 
motto, ‘‘Caring for the Land and Serv-
ing People.’’ 
Mr. Nicholas was born in Magnolia, 
MS, and graduated from Mississippi 
State University with a bachelor’s de-
gree in forest resource management 
and then with a master’s degree in 
business administration. He began his 
career as a silvicultural technician in 
the Daniel Boone National Forest and 
went on to serve in numerous natural 
resource 
and 
leadership 
positions 
throughout the southern and eastern 
United States. 
When he arrived to his first forest su-
pervisor position on the Shawnee Na-
tional Forest, equestrian use across the 
forest was rampant. Mr. Nicholas led a 
multiyear effort to reduce the impact 
of trail use on natural resources while 
also supporting an equestrian-based 
tourism economy. 
As forest supervisor, Mr. Nicholas 
oversaw North Carolina’s four National 
Forests. The Croatan, the Nantahala, 
the Pisgah, and the Uwharrie National 
Forests contain more than 1.25 million 
acres of land that stretches from the 
Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic 
Coast. All together, the forests wel-
come more than 7 million visitors each 
year. Mr. Nicholas led a team to reduce 
the number of accidental visitor deaths 
in National Forests in the southern re-
gion. Under his leadership, the team 
recommended a set of actions that are 
now being implemented to track data, 
improve communication to visitors, 
and provide more official presence 
through volunteers and partners. Mr. 
Nicholas demonstrates an impressive 
talent for balancing the safety of visi-
tors with responsible stewardship of 
our Nation’s natural resources. 
All who interact with Allen Nich-
olas—and countless more past, present, 
and future visitors—benefit greatly 
from his service. His commitment to 
the betterment of others is reflected in 
his lasting relationships with Forest 
Service employees and the public. His 
words inspire and empower, and he 
leads by example with his actions. 
Quite simply, he is a natural mentor to 
others and a wonderful example of a 
public servant. 
Please join me in congratulating 
Allen Nicholas, his wife Debra, daugh-
ters and sons-in-law, Anna Lisa and 
Taylor Roberts, and Kelsey and Garrett 
Dismukes, 
and 
his 
grandchildren 
Gracie and Charlie on his distinguished 
public service career and retirement. I 
wish him and his family the best in his 
future endeavors.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. HAWLEY: 
S. 4543. A bill to subsidize the sala-
ries of State and local law enforcement 
officers and promote officer hiring and 
retention, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today to address the grow-
ing crisis in our country, in our cities 
and towns across our country: a crisis 
of law and order, yes, a crisis of the 
rule of law, a crisis of confidence, a cri-
sis of solidarity. As our cities and 
towns come under siege, as so many of 
them descend into violence and law-
lessness night after night, we witness 
before our eyes the fraying of the 
American fabric, the breaking of Amer-
ican bonds. 
The violence that we are witnessing 
is not just about the individual lives 
harmed or lost, neighborhoods de-
stroyed, businesses burned and looted, 
families living in fear, whole neighbor-
hoods cowering behind locked doors. 
No. The devastation that we are seeing, 
the crisis that we are facing is about 
the confidence in our society itself, in 
our ability to come together, to live to-
gether, to find common ground, to 
build this common community and 
pursue that more perfect union. All of 
that is under threat in this current cri-
sis of lawlessness, of lack of respect for 
the rule of law, of the decline of due 
process and law and order. 
Let’s just be clear. These are not 
peaceful protests that we are seeing 
across the country. They are violent 
and increasingly violent riots and at-
tacks and looting, and I am sorry to 
say that too many in the media and my 
colleagues across the aisle are appeas-
ing the mobs and the Marxists whose 
desire is to burn our cities down, to 
burn our neighborhoods to the ground. 
These attacks are occurring because 
they are increasingly enabled by the 
mainstream press and local and na-
tional politicians who are pushing a 
historically 
fraudulent 
version 
of 
American history, one where America 
is a fundamentally racist nation, one 
where America is systemically evil, 
one where police officers are cast as 
agents of oppression. 
What our leaders fail to recognize is 
that our police officers, the brave men

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5514 
September 9, 2020 
and women in blue, those who choose 
day in and day out, of their own voli-
tion, of their own accord, to go out to 
the streets, to put their lives on the 
line to serve and protect their neigh-
borhoods, their fellow citizens, and to 
stand for our values—those police offi-
cers are an example and exemplars of 
our deepest held and most cherished 
beliefs because, without those police 
officers—let’s just be clear—the Con-
stitution of the United States, the Bill 
of Rights, those things are just words 
on a page. 
Without law enforcement officers 
giving their lives, risking their lives to 
enforce and make available the fair 
and equal rule of law, well, our Con-
stitution is just a parchment barrier. It 
may as well not exist. 
Now, our police officers are the best 
among us. They are the guardians of 
our neighborhoods. They are the sen-
tries on the streets. But too often now, 
in the press, right here in this body, we 
hear attacks on police officers, we hear 
rushes to judgment. These voices of 
criticism don’t see police as human 
beings, as working men and women 
whose experience and lives mirror our 
own, and too often these critics don’t 
see the suffering, the suicides, the low 
morale that police officers across this 
Nation face. 
The consequences of this mistreat-
ment that law enforcement are facing 
in this country are becoming ever 
clearer. Police departments are facing 
increasing retirements. They are strug-
gling to retain the officers they have 
and struggling to hire new ones. Local 
law enforcement report plummeting 
morale as officers face increasing vio-
lence and police departments struggle 
to pay their officers a salary that is 
commensurate with the work that they 
do, work that is more challenging 
today with the riots and looting sweep-
ing across our cities. 
What our officers need is not less 
funding. 
What 
they 
need 
is 
not 
defunding. What they need is not dis-
respect. What they need is support. 
What they need is for the leaders of 
this country and the good men and 
women of this country to say: We are 
with you; we support you; we will stand 
with you in the important and vital job 
that you do. They need more funding, 
not less; more recognition, not less. 
Our Federal Government exists to 
provide for the general welfare. Well, I 
believe it is time that Congress lived 
up to that promise. So let’s make it 
simple. Let’s give our officers a pay 
raise. Let’s give a pay raise to every 
cop in America, and let’s do it right 
now. Let’s provide new funding for po-
lice departments across this Nation to 
hire more cops and to put them out on 
the beat. Let’s put our money where 
our mouth is and stand by our law en-
forcement in this vital time for them 
and this vital time for our Nation. 
That is why, today, I am introducing 
legislation to back our police. My bill 
would authorize new funding through 
the Department of Justice to permit 
State and local police to raise the sala-
ries of officers up to 110 percent of local 
median earnings. That is a real wage 
boost, and it would be available under 
my bill right now. It would provide 
funding to hire new officers to boost 
manpower, and it would withhold this 
funding from any city or jurisdiction 
that defunds their police and tries to 
cut officer pay. 
I can tell you, for law enforcement in 
States like mine, in Missouri, this 
could mean a raise of thousands of dol-
lars a year, and our law enforcement 
deserve it. Not only would this legisla-
tion help officers; it would help all 
Americans by working to build a safer 
nation for our families to thrive and 
our communities to grow as one people 
together. Through safety, we can have 
solidarity. 
This bill is named in honor of David 
Dorn, the retired St. Louis police cap-
tain who was killed in June trying to 
protect his neighbors and his friends 
and his own neighborhood from violent 
looters. It is dedicated to all of those 
officers who have been a victim of vio-
lence this year. 
It is time that we rejected the false 
narrative that the police are inher-
ently oppressive; that America is in-
herently evil; that structural racism 
and structural oppression define this 
country, its past, its present, and its 
future; and that the police are instru-
ments of this oppression, of this his-
tory, of this evil. 
It simply isn’t true. Instead, it is 
time to stand, again, with our law en-
forcement, to affirm the vital work 
that they do, to affirm the vital role 
that they play in making available the 
rule of law for every American, in mak-
ing available and protecting the vital 
rights of every American. And it is 
time—by recommitting ourselves to 
safe streets, to the rule of law, to due 
process—to work on reforging those 
bonds of community, of solidarity, and 
of togetherness that are being torn 
apart night after night after night with 
the burning and the rioting in our 
streets. 
It is a fundamental choice we face. 
No nation can long endure lawlessness. 
No nation can long endure the break-
down of the basic operation of law. 
That is why the job that our law en-
forcement officers do night after night 
on that thin blue line is so vital. It is 
time that we stood up and thanked 
them for it. It is time that we stood up 
and supported them in it. 
May God bless our men and women 
who go to stand on that line every 
night. 
By Mr. MCCONNELL (for himself, 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND, Ms. MCSALLY, 
and Mrs. FEINSTEIN): 
S. 4547. A bill to improve the integ-
rity and safety of horseracing by re-
quiring uniform safety and perform-
ance standards, including a horseracing 
anti-doping and medication control 
program and a racetrack safety pro-
gram to be developed and enforced by 
an independent Horseracing Integrity 
and Safety Authority, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
year’s Kentucky Derby showed that 
our great traditions can adapt to over-
come any challenge. But our sport 
must be protected. 
I have been proud to stand up for 
Kentucky horse racing throughout my 
career. I introduced a checkoff bill to 
promote the sport domestically. I as-
sembled a coalition to open new mar-
kets in Japan and Hong Kong. I worked 
to make sure internet regulations did 
not unduly restrict the racing indus-
try. I have secured tax provisions to 
promote equine equity and grow in-
vestment in Kentucky. It has been my 
privilege to deliver for this sport and 
Kentuckians who stand behind it. 
Today, I am introducing new legisla-
tion to keep it up because, unfortu-
nately, the coronavirus isn’t thorough-
bred racing’s only challenge. In recent 
years, tragedies on the track, medica-
tion scandals, and an inconsistent 
patchwork of regulations have cast 
clouds over the future. A national pub-
lication’s editorial board even called 
for this sport to be abolished alto-
gether. 
We needed action to protect the sport 
we love, to defend our history and the 
24,000 Kentuckians who work in the 
thoroughbred racing industry. So in 
Lexington, the horse capital of the 
world, I announced with my friend Con-
gressman ANDY
BARR
that we had 
found a way forward. 
Today I will introduce the Horse-
racing Integrity and Safety Act to rec-
ognize a uniform, national standard for 
thoroughbred racing. Baseball, foot-
ball, and other professional sports have 
a central regulatory authority. Thor-
oughbred racing should as well. 
Some of the biggest names in the 
sport—Churchill 
Downs, 
Keeneland, 
the Breeders’ Cup and the Jockey Club, 
just to name a few—are supporting our 
plan to provide Federal recognition and 
enforcement power to an independent 
Horseracing Integrity and Safety Au-
thority. 
The board will be made up of both in-
dustry-selected and independent mem-
bers. It will set national standards for 
track safety, anti-doping, and medica-
tion practices and lab protocols. This 
will make thoroughbred racing as fair 
and as safe as possible. 
I am proud to partner with Senator 
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND on this bipartisan 
legislation. New York is home to an-
other leg of the Triple Crown. Their 
junior Senator has previously intro-
duced similar legislation to protect our 
sport. I am also glad to have the senior 
Senator from California and the junior 
Senator from Arkansas as original co-
sponsors on this bill. 
Today, Congressman BARR and Con-
gressman TONKO will present this legis-
lation over in the House. I am grateful 
for Congressman BARR’s years of lead-
ership on this issue, and I am glad we

making 
bipartisan, 
bicameral 
progress with our bill. This way, when 
we can all return to the grandstands to 
watch the thoroughbreds round the 
final turn toward a thundering finish, 
we will be taking pride in a fair and

By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. 
LEE, and Mr. COONS): 
S. 4549. A bill to give Federal courts 
additional 
discretion 
to 
determine 
whether pretrial detention is appro-
priate for defendants charged with non-
violent drug offenses in Federal crimi-
nal cases; to the Committee on the Ju-
diciary. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4549 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Smarter 
Pretrial Detention for Drug Charges Act of 
2020’’. 
SEC. 2. RELEASE CONDITIONS AND DETENTION 
IN FEDERAL CRIMINAL CASES. 
Section 3142 of title 18, United States Code, 
is amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘(42 U.S.C. 14135a)’’ each 
place it appears and inserting ‘‘(34 U.S.C.

(2) in subsection (e)(3)— 
(A) by striking subparagraph (A); and 
(B) by redesignating subparagraphs (B), 
(C), (D), and (E) as subparagraphs (A), (B), 
(C), and (D), respectively. 
By Ms. COLLINS: 
S. 4554. A bill to provide compensa-
tion for United States victims of Liby-
an state sponsored terrorism, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Justice for the 
Living Victims of Lockerbie Act. This 
bill would create a process to seek jus-
tice for a group Pan American World 
Airways pilots who lost their careers 
and pensions following the bombing of 
Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, 
Scotland, and the subsequent bank-
ruptcy and closure of Pan Am. 
On December 21, 1988, the state of 
Libya committed an infamous act of 
terror by bombing Pan Am Flight 103 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 
innocent civilians. Despite Pan Am’s 
greatly improved financial position in 
1988, the media coverage of the ter-
rorist attack wreaked havoc on Pan 
Am sales leading to its bankruptcy in 
1991. 
In 2008, the United States entered 
into the U.S.-Libya Humanitarian Set-
tlement Agreement, in which Libya 
paid $1.5 billion to settle claims by U.S. 
citizens 
for 
Libyan-sponsored 
ter-
rorism. After payments by the State 
Department to families of death vic-
tims from Lockerbie and the La Belle 
Disco bombing in Germany, compensa-
tion to other victims was to be deter-
mined by the Foreign Claims Settle-
ment Commission. The Commission 
could only consider further claims re-
ferred to it by the State Department. 
One of these claimants was a group of 
senior Pan Am pilots, most of whom 
were veterans, who were over the age 
of 50 and lost their jobs, pensions, 
healthcare, and eventually their sav-
ings when Pan Am went bankrupt and 
closed. Due to the federally required 
retirement age of 60 at that time, and 
the airline industry’s seniority system, 
they were unable to get new pilot jobs 
with other airlines. Two of these pilots 
reside in Maine—Ron Fitch of Poland 
Spring and Schafer Bean of Diamond 
Cove—and I have heard their stories 
and their pleas for Justice on behalf of 
their own families and the others who 
suffered as a result of Libya’s acts of 
terrorism. 
This group’s initial lawsuit against 
Libya, which had been joined with the 
families 
of 
those 
who 
died 
at 
Lockerbie, was dismissed by the courts 
due to sovereign immunity. Following 
the 2008 settlement agreement with 
Libya, the group of pilots approached 
the State Department in 2009 seeking 
the necessary referral to have their 
claims heard by the Foreign Claims 
Settlement 
Commission. 
For 
more 
than 4 years the State Department 
failed to refer the group’s claims to the 
Commission, but following bipartisan 
letters to then-Secretaries Clinton and 
Kerry signed by myself and more than 
60 other Members of Congress, the 
State Department finally referred the 
claims in 2013. 
After an initial denial of claims in a 
preliminary ruling by the Commission 
in July 2016, the group of pilots was 
granted a hearing in December 2016. So 
many of the pilots and their families 
attended the hearing that it was moved 
to a U.S. District Court courtroom in 
Washington, DC. Three senior Pan Am 
executives testified at the hearing, in-
cluding the former Pan Am CEO, 
Thomas Plaskett; former Pan Am sen-
ior vice president for finance, Ramesh 
Punwani; and former Pan Am vice 
president of strategic planning, Peter 
Pappas. 
Each 
explained 
why 
the 
Lockerbie bombing and the subsequent 
media coverage directly caused the air-
line’s collapse. 
In January 2018, more than a year 
following that hearing, the Commis-
sion ruled against the pilots. Using an 
undefined standard of proof and apply-
ing international law, the Commission 
argued that Pan Am’s demise was not 
caused by the Lockerbie bombing, con-
trary to the testimony of the former 
Pan Am executives themselves. The pi-
lots’ referred claim was the very last of 
the Libyan claims adjudicated by the 
Commission, and the Libya settlement 
fund is now exhausted from the claims 
it approved prior to the final adjudica-
tion of the pilots’ claims.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5522 
September 9, 2020 
These terrorism victims were denied 
an opportunity to even make their case 
for 4 years by the Department of State, 
and when finally referred to the For-
eign Claims Settlement Commission, 
they were forced to wait another 3 
years for a preliminary ruling and an-
other 2 years for a final decision, by 
which point the Commission had al-
ready awarded claims that essentially 
exhausted the settlement funds pro-
vided by Libya. That simply is not fair, 
and I believe these Mainers and other 
Americans deserve a quick and fair 
process to compensate them for their 
losses. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
working toward justice for all of the 
victims of the Lockerbie bombing per-
petrated by Libya.

RIS) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Armed Services: 
S. RES. 685 
Whereas the Nation owes an unmeasurable 
debt to all those individuals who have served 
in the United States Armed Forces, often 
shouldering the burden of long periods away 
from home, difficult and frequently dan-
gerous training and deployments, and inher-
ent physical, mental, and emotional risks; 
Whereas the families, communities, and 
loved ones of members of the Armed Forces 
support them in countless ways, frequently 
making sacrifices of their own, especially 
Gold Star families; 
Whereas many who love this country have 
served in conflicts throughout the Nation’s 
history, whether volunteering so another 
would not have to go or answering the call 
when drafted, or out of a profound and self-
less sense of duty, some never returning 
home, some still missing, and some who suf-
fered immense hardship as prisoners of war; 
Whereas one of the highest honors and sol-
emn responsibilities of serving as President 
of the United States is to be Commander in 
Chief of the Armed Forces; 
Whereas faithful execution of this con-
stitutional duty requires, at a minimum, 
that the Commander in Chief forcefully de-
fend the safety of members of the Armed 
Forces against foreign adversaries, such as 
President of the Russian Federation, Vladi-
mir Putin; 
Whereas the Commander in Chief has a 
duty to uphold good order and discipline in 
the Armed Forces by refusing to issue uncon-
stitutional orders, refusing to pardon and ex-
cuse those in uniform who commit crimes, 
and refusing to use rhetoric that seeks to di-
vide military personnel from their senior 
leaders; 
Whereas the Nation honors the service and 
sacrifice of members of the Armed Forces 
and veterans who placed the mission first 
and refused to leave a fallen comrade, never 
asking what was in it for them, but, rather, 
setting aside selfish interests in defense of 
the Nation; 
Whereas a lack of respect for individuals 
who served in uniform is a disqualifying 
characteristic for service as President; 
Whereas 
President 
Trump 
repeatedly 
disrespected members of the Armed Forces, 
and demonstrated a fundamental ignorance 
of the ethos of military service— 
(1) when President Trump dehumanized 
members in saying of such members that 
‘‘[w]e train our boys to be killing machines, 
then prosecute them when they kill!’’; 
(2) when President Trump pardoned mem-
bers convicted of actions that violate the 
laws of war, thereby valorizing war crimes 
and contempt for the rule of law and uneth-
ical warfighting, and undermining good 
order and discipline; 
(3) when President Trump dismissed trau-
matic brain injury as ‘‘headaches’’ and de-
scribed an incident of members suffering 
traumatic brain injuries as a result of mis-
sile strikes as ‘‘not very serious’’; 
(4) when President Trump denigrated the 
military service of the late Senator John 
McCain by claiming that ‘‘[h]e’s not a war 
hero. He’s a war hero because he was cap-
tured. I like people who weren’t captured’’; 
(5) when President Trump failed to speak 
of Gold Star parents with honor and respect; 
(6) when President Trump sought to hu-
miliate a decorated military officer, who was 
awarded the Purple Heart, by forcing White 
House security to escort the officer off the 
property when removing him from the Na-
tional Security Council; and 
(7) when President Trump failed to honor 
the solemn responsibility of the Commander 
in Chief to offer comfort to the families of 
members killed in action on his watch; and 
Whereas President Trump has failed to 
publicly condemn, warn, or even criticize 
President of the Russian Federation, Vladi-
mir Putin, following public reports that Rus-
sia offered bounties for the killing of mem-
bers of the Armed Forces: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the denigration by President 
Donald Trump of members of the United 
States Armed Forces and veterans; 
(2) affirms that the service and sacrifice of 
individuals who serve the Nation in uniform, 
refuse to leave a fallen comrade behind and 
never retreat in the face of grave danger, as 
exemplified by the United States Marines 
who demonstrated bravery, grit, and valor in 
prevailing in the fierce Battle of Belleau 
Wood during World War I, reflect the true 
character of our country that makes Amer-
ica great; 
(3) will honor and never forget the sac-
rifices and bravery of members of the Armed 
Forces who became prisoners of war or went 
missing in action; 
(4) will respect, honor, and care for the 
service-disabled veterans who have borne the 
battle in defense of the Nation, recognizing 
that wounds of war are earned by those who 
set aside selfish interests; and 
(5) demands that President Donald Trump 
uphold his oath of office and constitutional 
duty as Commander in Chief of the Armed 
Forces to defend members of the Armed 
Forces against hostile actions by leaders and 
military forces of the Russian Federation.

created by a United States-led international

Whereas it is a constitutional duty of the

2018, against Russian military contractors in 
Syria that threatened the Armed Forces and 
aided and abetted the murderous regime of 
Bashar al-Assad; and 
Whereas the President was nominated for 
the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for his successful 
efforts to create peace between Israel and 
the United Arab Emirates: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) will always honor and venerate the 
service and sacrifice of members of the 
United States Armed Forces who put the se-
curity and safety of the American people 
ahead of their own self-interest, from those 
who served in World Wars I and II, Korea, to 
Vietnam, from the Gulf War and the Balkan 
conflicts to Iraq and Afghanistan, and from 
the frontlines of deterring China and Russia 
and 
combating 
terrorism 
to 
supporting 
American communities here at home when 
natural disasters strike; 
(2) continues to advocate for resources to 
ensure the Armed Forces will maintain its 
position as the dominant force for freedom 
and prosperity in the world; and 
(3) expresses the deepest gratitude to the 
Gold Star families who have suffered the loss 
of their loved ones in service to the Nation.
