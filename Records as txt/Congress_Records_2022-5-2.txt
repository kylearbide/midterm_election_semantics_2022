RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
inflation has hit a staggering 8.5 per-
cent on Democrats’ watch as a result of 
Democrats’ policies. 
Last week, the Commerce Depart-
ment announced that personal con-
sumption expenditures climbed at their 
fastest rate this past year since 1982— 
40 years ago. Americans are paying 10 
percent more on groceries than they 
were a year ago and about $1.25 more 
for a gallon of gas. In every aisle of the 
supermarket, in every big box store, 
the prices families pay for essentials 
have skyrocketed. 
As the owner of a coffeehouse in my 
hometown of Louisville put it, ‘‘We are 
trying not to pass on too much to the 
customers, but it comes to a time when 
you just have to.’’ 
The owner of a longstanding butcher 
shop nearby said: 
‘‘We’re all holding our breath.’’ That goes 
for small business owners and shoppers alike. 
One new poll found that 94 percent of 
Americans are upset or concerned 
about inflation, and they are over-
whelmingly not happy—not happy— 
with what the Biden administration is 
doing about it. Just 28 percent of the 
country approved of President Biden’s 
handling of inflation. 
The worst part is that this pain was 
certainly 
not 
inevitable. 
American 
families could have been spared all of 
this. 
Last spring, Democrats inherited an 
economy that was ready for a historic 
comeback. Even top liberal economists 
such as Larry Summers and Jason 
Furman—both senior advisers to the 
Obama 
White 
House—warned— 
warned—that Democrats’ $2 trillion 
spending binge was completely out of 
proportion to the remaining output 
gap. The country didn’t need anything 
like it. 
Summers warned of ‘‘inflationary 
pressures of a kind we have not seen in 
a generation.’’ 
Furman said: 
It’s definitely too big for the moment. 
But Democratic politicians didn’t lis-
ten. Here in the Senate, the Demo-
cratic leader said: 
I do not think the dangers of inflation, at 
least in the near-term, are very real. 
That 
was 
Leader 
SCHUMER
last 
March. 
So they spent all that money any-
way, and, sadly, for the American peo-
ple, the rest is now history. Democrats

May 2, 2022 
spent $2 trillion of the American peo-
ple’s money and purchased the worst 
inflation in more than 40 years. 
Well, actually, that is not all it pur-
chased. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
sure, the Democrats’ $2 trillion didn’t 
buy our country anything lasting like 
a Hoover Dam or an Interstate High-
way System—nothing like that—but 
the money had to go someplace—and, 
boy, did it ever. 
Democrats and lots of the media 
spent most of 2020 and 2021 shouting 
that Republicans were risking calam-
ity because we didn’t want to dump 
endless sums into slush funds for State 
and local governments. It turns out we 
were right, and they were wrong. State 
and local governments are now so 
awash in Democrat bailout money they 
can’t even figure out where to put it. 
One recent news report found this bo-
nanza has ‘‘provided a boon for local-
ities seeking to build or upgrade their 
pickleball amenities.’’ Yes, you heard 
that right. 
Dozens 
of 
municipalities 
are 
adding 
pickleball courts to their park and recre-
ation offerings—and many are using a slice 
of their coronavirus aid package to under-
write the construction boom. If the Hoover 
Dam and the Lincoln Tunnel are enduring 
monuments to the New Deal’s infrastructure 
spending, perhaps pickleball courts will be-
come a lasting legacy of the $1.9 trillion 
American Rescue Plan. 
In New York, one county set aside $12 
million in so-called relief funds to ren-
ovate a minor league baseball stadium. 
In Iowa, county officials put aside $2 
million—listen to this—to buy a pri-
vate ski area. In Colorado, two golf 
courses are getting their irrigation sys-
tems replaced, thank goodness. In Wis-
consin, a skate park is getting a mil-
lion-dollar makeover. 
The American Rescue Plan didn’t 
rescue working people from anything. 
It only rescued bureaucrats from any 
semblance—any semblance—of fiscal 
sanity. 
Remember, Democrats openly admit-
ted they viewed pandemic relief as an 
ideological Trojan horse. They called 
this terrible, deadly virus ‘‘a tremen-
dous opportunity to restructure things 
to fit our vision.’’ 
And so right on cue, their so-called 
rescue plan has funded environmental 
justice grants to address something 
called inequitable tree canopy cover in 
Massachusetts. Some public school sys-
tems, in the vice grip of Big Labor, are 
using their windfalls to advance bizarre 
indoctrination in things like critical 
race theory. 
The rescue plan dollars have funded 
staff trainings to make sure the edu-
cators paid to look after young kids 
are up on all of the latest ‘‘woke’’ 
buzzwords and causes. 
The American people wouldn’t want 
this junk if it were free. They defi-
nitely don’t want it for the pricetag of 
$2 trillion of their money and the worst 
inflation in a generation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
HEAL INITIATIVE AND GUN 
VIOLENCE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, over 
the past 2 years, our understanding of 
healthcare and good health practices 
has changed. The pandemic revealed we 
cannot limit the delivery of care to the 
hospital or the doctor’s office. We need 
to reach out, particularly to the most 
vulnerable members of our commu-
nities, directly, personally. That is ex-
actly what is underway in Chicago 
right now. 
Four years ago, I brought together 
the CEOs of the top 10 hospitals in Chi-
cago. They were located in areas 
around the city, I noticed, that were 
comparable to the areas of greatest 
gun violence, each one of those hos-
pitals. So I asked the 10 CEOs to come 
over for breakfast—I bought the bagels 
and coffee—and they sat down around 
the table and they looked at one an-
other and they told me: This is the 
first time we have ever sat in the same 
room together. 
They are competitors. They are try-
ing to get the same people to come to 
their hospitals. But this morning was a 
conversation about what they had in 
common. 
These hospitals are on the frontlines 
of treating victims with bullet wounds. 
When I met with those CEOs in 2018, we 
talked about how you not only treat 
this kind of violence but how you pre-
vent it. 
We launched something called the 
Chicago 
HEAL 
Initiative. 
‘‘HEAL’’ 
stands for Hospital Engagement, Ac-
tion, and Leadership. Despite being 
competitors, these 10 hospital CEOs sat 
down, and on their own—without my 
input, without my urging or any Fed-
eral mandates—wrote 16 things they 
thought they could achieve over a span 
of 3 years. I looked at the list and said 
that this sounds good to me. 
We knew we couldn’t solve every as-
pect of the complex problems facing us 
with gun violence, but it was a good 
start. They said to me: This is the first 
time we have ever gotten together, and 
we were able to come up with an agree-
ment. 
Well, last week, the 3 years were up, 
and we announced what happened at 
these hospitals over the last 3 years. 
The gunshot patient in the emergency 
room, hospitals are no longer just 
stitching up their wounds; they are 
also addressing the emotional scars to 
prevent retaliation. Last year, 3,000 
gunshot victims were paired with coun-
selors and caseworkers. 
Without 
these 
interventions, 
we 
know that nearly half—half—of the 
gunshot victims would be back in the 
hospital within 5 years. That is a fact. 
But the hospitals are also looking 
further upstream to try to put an end 
to violence in the city of Chicago. 
People say the best way to stop a 
bullet is with a job. Well, these 10 hos-
pitals took that to heart. Over the last 
3 years, these 10 hospitals increased 
new hires from neighborhoods of the 
highest gun violence, which face more 
poverty than other neighborhoods, ob-
viously, by a whopping 21 percent. 
Here is what they do. They go into 
the high schools and middle schools 
around the hospitals where they do 
business and sit down and talk to the 
kids and say: How would you like to 
shadow one of our nurses or one of our 
doctors, see what it is like in the hos-
pital here and maybe even have a sum-
mer internship? All of a sudden, young 
people have taken an interest in that 
hospital that they walk by every day 
and never ever related to. 
The hospitals also decided they have 
economic clout. Think of the money 
that is spent on goods and supplies at 
every hospital in America. Well, they 
decided to reach out to their suppliers 
and say to them: We are going to give 
you special consideration if you will lo-
cate part of your business in the neigh-
borhood around our hospital so that 
people in the neighborhoods can be 
working to provide the goods and ma-
terials that we need. 
They increased goods and services 
from local suppliers by nearly 30 per-
cent—$120 million last year—just the 
beginning, seed money to get these 
businesses in the neighborhood sup-
plying the hospital. 
Importantly, these 10 hospitals are 
going into the Chicago middle and high 
schools offering apprenticeship pro-
grams, and it is working. Last year, 
5,000 students went through these ap-
prenticeship and intern programs. 
This is especially important 2 years 
into the pandemic. Our hospitals have 
been hit with shortages of nurses, doc-
tors, and critical support staff—not 
just in the city of Chicago, I might add, 
but the entire State. I spoke to the 
Southern Illinois Health Clinic CEO, 
and he has talked to me about the 
same thing they are running into in 
Chicago. They just don’t have enough 
medical professionals. 
I met last week with members of the 
Illinois Hospital Association. They told 
me that the shortages and burnouts in 
our health workforce is their top con-
cern. They are working with local 
schools to recruit students. 
A few years ago, I kept hearing this 
nursing shortage, nursing shortage, 
and I decided I had to learn what was 
behind this. And it is a very simple fact 
of economics. Here is what it comes 
down to. If you are a registered nurse 
in my State of Illinois, it is not uncom-
mon for you to have an opportunity to 
make a six-figure salary, not uncom-
mon at all. And particularly if you are

in the big city, you are going to make 
that much money. That is a good sal-
ary, and I believe these nurses deserve 
it. 
But then you say, well, we need more 
nurses. We need to have more nurse 
training. Well, what do you need for 
nurse training? A teacher. A professor. 
How do you take a registered nurse 
and turn that registered nurse into a 
professor? Two years for a master’s de-
gree in nursing. 
The obvious question: What is that 
nurse going to do for 2 years while she 
is going to school or he is going to 
school to become a professor? They are 
not going to get the six-figure salary 
that they were earning as RNs. So 
there is an obvious economic disincen-
tive for them to go into teaching even 
if they want to do it. 
Now, let’s assume they get through 
the 2 years and the master’s degree, 
and now they are professors. The 
amount that they are being paid at the 
community college or at the nursing 
school is not comparable to the salary 
of an RN. So the economics of the situ-
ation come in as a great obstacle. 
So what happens—you know this, I 
am sure, very well, Madam President. 
What happens to the hospital that 
doesn’t have enough nurses? They have 
to go out for what they call contract 
nurses. I am not holding anything 
against these people. They make a liv-
ing and are pretty smart at it. They 
make themselves available. Some of 
them move all over the country to be 
in different hospitals, and they get paid 
dramatically more than the RNs who 
are on the regular staff. 
One hospital told me they pay three 
times the rate for a contract nurse as a 
regular nurse. Another said five times 
the rate. If you can think what that 
means, the budgets of these hospitals 
and clinics are going through the roof 
with these additional costs for a nurs-
ing shortage. 
So we have got to find a way to cre-
ate the economics of more nursing pro-
fessors from the RN pool that is over-
taxed, working hard, getting paid six 
figures, and move them into teaching 
ranks. 
The obvious beneficiaries are all of 
us in America, but directly it is hos-
pitals and clinics. So they have to join 
with us in a joint effort to try to solve 
this problem. 
We also know that trauma is the root 
of much of the pain and conflict in our 
neighborhoods. You have heard the 
phrase: ‘‘Hurt people hurt people.’’ 
Almost 30 years ago, the CDC did a 
study on adverse childhood experi-
ences, called ACEs. They found that 
witnessing violence or growing up 
without a stable home can really have 
an impact on the human mind, the 
mind of a child. Without the right help, 
that trauma can rewire a child’s brain 
and change the way they see the world. 
It is not hard to see how this fuels the 
cycle of violence. 
Under the HEAL Initiative, these 10 
Chicago hospitals are bringing their 
medical expertise into the community 
to help children cope with traumatic 
experiences. I have seen it in a class-
room, in one of the classrooms called 
Calm Classrooms Project, which teach-
es meditation in school. 
I was at a classroom of third graders, 
and the teacher said to the kids at 
their desks: Now we are going to be 
quiet for 5 minutes. So everybody just 
think about what we are going to do 
today. 
There was one kid who just couldn’t 
do it. He was fidgeting. He wanted to 
talk. She was telling him: No, no. Be 
quiet for a little while. 
I said to the teacher afterwards: 
What is going on? 
She said: That little boy is going 
through some real problems at home. 
I said: What are you going to do 
about it? 
She said: Senator, I am a teacher. I 
am not a psychologist. I am not a 
counselor. We need somebody to sit 
down and talk to him. He needs help 
right now. 
Well, imagine all these kids coming 
back from their Zoom educations, try-
ing to get back into the classroom and 
into the swing of things. For a lot of 
kids, there is an adjustment. They need 
a helping hand. 
So what we are trying to teach is 
that what is going on with mental 
health issues, wellness issues, trauma 
issues all relates to the outcomes we 
are looking for: kids who are successful 
in school and kids who avoid the gangs 
and violence on the street. 
Two weeks ago, I visited Drake Ele-
mentary School—the Drake Dragons— 
where I toured one of the school clinics 
and the mobile health van. Listen to 
this, Madam President. You are going 
to like this. They have a clinic in the 
school itself. They treat the kids with 
counseling and physical and health— 
whatever needs they have. They, of 
course, are there for the staff, but they 
also make it open to the families of the 
kids, no questions asked: Come on 
down to our clinic. When you drop your 
kid off at school, come on into the clin-
ic if you need a helping hand. And they 
have expanded that to the neighbor-
hood as well. It is a great idea, and it 
is based in the school—what I like 
about it. 
It has been years and years since I 
was there, in grade school. We had an 
occasional school nurse, but that was 
about it. What would you think about 
a real clinic in the school? And over 
half of the people who come in need 
mental health counseling. It is an im-
portant part of life, and they are re-
sponding to it. 
We were joined in our meeting just a 
week or so ago by Dr. Walensky from 
the CDC. She applauded these hospitals 
that are part of the Chicago HEAL Ini-
tiative, and she said this innovative 
partnership is exactly what CDC sees 
in the future. 
I hope President Biden agrees. I am 
sure he will. In his fiscal year 2023 
budget, the President called for a $250 
million investment in community vio-
lence interventions to support pro-
grams like the HEAL Initiative. Be-
lieve me, I am going to knock on his 
door. In March, in his State of the 
Union Address, the President urged 
lawmakers to come on a bipartisan 
basis to address mental health. 
DEBBIE
STABENOW, 
our 
colleague 
from Michigan, has been one of the 
strongest proponents of mental health. 
She 
was 
talking 
about 
this—and 
should. The President hears the mes-
sage, and he is delivering. 
I partnered also with Senator CAPITO, 
a Republican from West Virginia, on 
the RISE from Trauma Act, which will 
help more kids heal from trauma. Our 
bill would increase the resources for a 
trauma-informed workforce. Projects 
like HEAL and this legislation with 
Senator CAPITO can really change lives 
for the better. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let 
me say a word about gun violence be-
cause in the city of Chicago, which I 
am honored to represent, it breaks my 
heart what is happening in that city. 
Not last weekend but the weekend 
before, there were 37 shootings in the 
course of a weekend. Seven people died. 
This weekend, 9 people were killed and 
26 others wounded by gunfire. This is 
the beginning of the summer months. I 
am afraid that it tells us we still have 
a massive challenge ahead of us. We 
have to do more at every single level. 
Let’s start with what the HEAL Ini-
tiative is doing and bring some hope to 
the lives of folks, give them an oppor-
tunity for a decent-paying job, let 
them have an affordable place to live 
that is safe from gunshots and other 
threats to a family. 
We have to work on this together to 
deal with the criminal justice system. 
We learned the hard way that simply 
putting tougher sentences down for 
something like crack cocaine is not 
necessarily the answer. In fact, it can 
backfire, as it did, we learned, over the 
last 20 years. We have to have sensible 
criminal sentencing guidelines that 
punish wrongdoing, of course; keep 
dangerous people off the street, of 
course; but give people a chance to re-
build their lives. Many of them will be 
able to do it. Let me also say that we 
have to have effective prosecution. 
We lost one of our best Chicago po-
licewomen just last year. Her name 
was Ella French. Ella French was a 
lovely, young, respected police officer 
who was sitting in a car with her part-
ner. A fellow came up with a gun, shot 
her in the back of the head—unfortu-
nately, killed her—and then shot her 
partner in the head, too, and blinded 
him in one eye. His name is Officer 
Yanez. I met him at the South Side 
Irish Parade. 
Well, the tribute to Ella French, who 
lost her life in the line of duty, was 
like something I have never seen before 
in Chicago. They went to a high school

in the southern part of the city and 
took the chapel and set it aside for 
visitors to come pay their respects. 
The Presiding Officer wouldn’t believe 
the lines that went on for blocks, men 
and women in uniform and everybody 
else—myself, my wife, folks in the 
city—paying their respects to Ella 
French. She was an extraordinary per-
son. 
The gun that killed her was a straw 
purchase gun. What does that mean? 
Somebody went into a Federal gun 
dealer and said: I want to buy a gun. 
They looked and checked, and that per-
son had no criminal record. The person 
bought the gun, turned around, went 
outside, and handed it to a convicted 
felon, who then turned around and 
killed this policewoman. That is a 
straw purchase. 
Unfortunately, for too long, we have 
treated that as a bookkeeping crime, a 
misdemeanor, nothing serious. It is se-
rious. Straw purchases are a way to 
avoid the prohibition under the law of 
a person with a criminal record buying 
a gun. We ought to treat it as a serious 
matter. 
I have appealed to all the U.S. attor-
neys in my State, and I hope all Sen-
ators will talk to the U.S. attorneys 
across the Nation. Take straw pur-
chasing seriously. This is not a book-
keeping error; this is a deadly crime 
that can kill innocent, good people like 
Ella French and maimed the officer 
who was with her. So we ought to take 
that seriously. 
This weekend that I just referred to, 
the previous one, with 37 shootings, 1 of 
them was on Sunday night. Madam 
President, they went to the scene 
afterwards and found 68 cartridges—68. 
The people in the neighborhood said it 
sounded like a war zone. Two of the 
cartridges were from an AK–47, a mili-
tary assault type rifle, which has no 
place anywhere except in the military 
or maybe some police application, but 
in this case, it was being used in a 
shootout between two people in cars. 
I don’t understand what happened 
next. They ended up finding one of the 
people who were involved in the shoot-
ing. He had a gun. He had a gun ille-
gally. He doesn’t have a firearm identi-
fication card, required under Illinois 
law. After taking a look at the facts of 
the situation, they plan on charging 
him with a misdemeanor. What is 
going on here? A misdemeanor for a 
shootout on the streets of Chicago with 
68 cartridges on the ground afterwards? 
Whether it is a straw purchase treat-
ed as a bookkeeping error or a shoot-
out with an AK–47 treated as a mis-
demeanor, we have to send the word 
out that this is unacceptable—not just 
in Chicago but unacceptable across this 
country. 
If you want to legally own a gun, 
store it properly, use it properly and 
legally, I am all for it, and I think that 
is what the Second Amendment is all 
about. But what is going on on streets 
of Chicago, the streets of East St. 
Louis, Rockford, and so many other 
cities is a shootout with a massive 
amount of guns that are finding their 
way onto the streets. So we have to 
take that seriously. 
f 
CONFIRMATION OF LADON A. 
REYNOLDS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let 
me just close by saying that last week, 
the Senate did a great job filling an-
other critical law enforcement vacancy 
in Chicago. We confirmed Oak Park 
Police Chief LaDon Reynolds to be our 
Northern District’s next U.S. marshal. 
That seat has been vacant for almost 4 
years. It is a critical position for reduc-
ing crime, apprehending fugitives, and 
protecting our judges. 
Marshal Reynolds is the man for the 
job. Breaking the cycle of violence in 
Chicago and across America requires 
the best. All of us need to pull to-
gether: families, schools, community 
organizations, law enforcement, the 
public health community, faith lead-
ers, 
the 
business 
community, 
and 
more. I am glad that the HEAL Initia-
tive is a start in that direction. We 
have more work to do, and we cannot 
allow any petty Washington politics to 
get in the way. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
there has been a lot of noise about can-
celing student debt. That has been 
going on for quite a few months, but it 
seems to have taken on a new life here 
within the last week to 10 days. That 
whole talk is worse than closing the 
barn door after the horse has escaped; 
it is like buying a new horse but leav-
ing the barn door open. If all student 
debt was gone tomorrow, we would be 
right back where we started when this 
whole new crop of students graduate. 
Last month, the administration uni-
laterally extended all the pause on pay-
ing back student loans for all bor-
rowers until the end of August, regard-
less of need. It doesn’t matter that all 
Americans are back to work now, if 
they want to be back to work. It 
doesn’t matter if the borrower is mak-
ing six figures and can afford to pay off 
their loans. 
The latest extension will bring the 
cost of this student loan payment 
pause up to about $150 billion. Just to 
put that $150 billion in context, the en-
tire Department of Education budget 
for this year is about half of that 
amount at $80 billion. 
Higher 
education 
advocates 
have 
been calling for the doubling of the 
Pell grant. That is the program that 
targets aid to those with the most fi-
nancial need. It is a noble goal to dou-
ble the Pell grant; but, of course, Con-
gress needs to find the money some-
where to do just that. 
Now, instead, the Biden administra-
tion is spending billions of dollars to 
allow high earners with graduate de-
grees to not pay their loans with no 
say from the Congress of the United 
States. And you know the President of 
the United States has been debating for 
months—maybe starting at the begin-
ning of his term—did he really have the 
authority to do it. He has expressed the 
opinion, at least on the $50,000 figure, 
that he didn’t figure he had the author-
ity to do it. I question whether he has 
that authority at all. 
If you want to help those who owe 
more in student loans than they can af-
ford to pay, we need to fix the student 
loan program on the front end. In other 
words, we need to change the incen-
tives and give colleges a reason to 
bring down tuition. Right now, a high 
school student looking at college is 
often in the dark about what they will 
end up paying to attend college and to 
get that degree. It is no wonder that 
prices rise when students don’t know 
even what those prices are. And stu-
dents are encouraged, of course, to bor-
row the maximum even if they don’t 
need that maximum, because that is 
what the Federal law requires. 
So in response to this problem about 
a Federal policy encouraging students 
to go into more debt than they need to 
get their degree and also about the ris-
ing tuition costs because colleges think 
they can raise their tuition at will be-
cause the Federal Government is going 
to come in and help the student, I have 
introduced three bipartisan bills to 
give students the information they 
need to make the choice that works 
best for them. My bills would make it 
easier for students to see how much 
each college would cost, what aid they 
are going to be getting, and what their 
average salary versus student loan pay-
ments would be. The answer isn’t to 
cancel student debt only after students 
have gotten in well over their heads, it

is to stop them from getting into that 
situation in the very first place. And it 
certainly wouldn’t be done unilaterally 
from the White House with no say from 
this Congress on the $150 billion pro-
gram. 
Now, even worse, the benefits of just 
canceling or pausing student debt are 
mainly going to those at the top of the 
income range. Graduates with the most 
debt also tend to be those with the 
longest degrees and they are now doc-
tors or lawyers. These people, doctors 
and lawyers, might have plenty of debt 
now, but people with graduate degrees 
are also much more likely to have a 
higher salary and much higher lifetime 
earnings. 
Are the two-thirds of the Americans 
without college degrees somehow less 
deserving of a free $10,000 or $50,000 in 
canceled debt than doctors or lawyers? 
And what about those people that have 
already paid off their loans? Are they 
going to bear the costs of people that 
borrowed too much when this is for-
given at the $10,000 or $50,000 level? 
I am sure many Iowans would be 
happy to have their car loans or mort-
gages paid off. Is there any thought 
about what this can lead to? It is pret-
ty clear. Canceling debt is not a solu-
tion. Instead, I have been glad to see 
many of my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle join my bills to prevent excess 
student debt in the very first place. 
We need to help students by giving 
them the information they need to find 
the best college for their needs at a 
cost they can afford. Otherwise, for-
giving student debt is a slippery slope 
to a lot of other interests wanting debt 
forgiveness. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
want to begin by responding to a par-
ticularly disgusting comment made 
over the weekend by Russian Foreign 
Minister Sergey Lavrov. As the Rus-
sian Army continues slaughtering ci-
vilians, Foreign Minister Lavrov did 
what many others who now reside in 
the dustbin of history have done before 
him—resort to anti-Semitism to defend 
his nation’s action. 
As the highest ranking, Jewish elect-
ed official in the United States, I take 
particular umbrage at what Mr. Lavrov 
said. Asked on Italian television yes-
terday to defend his nation’s invasion 
of Ukraine, Mr. Lavrov repeated the 
deranged conspiracy that Ukraine is 
dominated by Neo-Nazis and dismissed 
President Zelenskyy’s own Jewish her-
itage by saying: 
I believe Hitler also had Jewish origins. 
He also added: 
We have been hearing the wise Jewish peo-
ple say that the biggest anti-Semites are the 
Jews themselves. 
I have only one word for this: ‘‘sick-
ening.’’ It is sickening. Mr. Lavrov’s 
comments are just sickening and de-
serve to be condemned by all who op-
pose the dangers of anti-Semitism. 
They tap into the very old and very 
poisonous notion that the Jewish peo-
ple themselves were the architects of 
the worst human atrocities in modern 
history even when they were aimed at 
Jews themselves. 
Mr. Foreign Minister, you are fooling 
no one. The war crimes committed by 
Russia are as plain as day for the world 
to see. And to justify Russia’s violence 
with appeals to anti-Semitism is sick-
ening; it is dangerous. It is chilling to 
see Russia’s top diplomat—he should 
not be called a diplomat after saying 
that. It is chilling to see Russia’s top 
foreign 
policy 
person 
so 
casually 
spread disinformation about the his-
tory of the Holocaust in order to ad-
vance Mr. Putin’s political and mili-
tary agenda. 
I condemn Mr. Lavrov’s comments in 
the strongest possible terms, and every 
individual who wishes to guard against 
the poisons of anti-Semitism should do 
the same. 
Now, Madam President, over the 
weekend, Speaker PELOSI led a delega-
tion of House Members to Ukraine and 
met 
with 
President 
Zelenskyy 
to 
pledge our country’s support for the 
Ukrainian people. 
We have the obligation to dem-
onstrate that support by approving an-
other round of Ukrainian emergency 
funding. Now that President Biden has 
made a formal request for $33 billion, 
our appropriators are hard at work 
turning the request into legislation. It 
is my hope that a bipartisan agreement 
can be reached very soon and that the 
Senate can begin processing this aid 
package on the floor as early as next 
week. 
Quickly approving this emergency 
funding for Ukraine is essential to 
helping the people of Ukraine in their 
fight against Russia. Again, I expect 
both sides to work quickly, decisively, 
and with bipartisan cooperation to get 
this aid out the door and onto the 
President’s desk, just as we did for the 
first round of aid back in March. 
I will also work to include a provi-
sion that arms the Federal Govern-
ment with the tools needed to liquidate 
assets the United States seized from 
Russian oligarchs, such as yachts, 
mansions, private jets, art collections, 
and the like. 
Specifically, the Senate should ex-
pand existing forfeiture laws that will 
turn up the heat on these corrupt indi-
viduals who made their own ill-gotten 
gains from the vicious, evil, dictatorial 
Vladimir Putin. We need to go after 
these crooked oligarchs. They have 
gotten rich off Putin’s regime. Their 
ill-gotten gains should have no safe ref-
uge within the United States, and it 
would be great if the proceeds from 
these assets would be used to support 
the Ukrainian people. I think that is 
the right way to go, and I will work to 
see that the Senate acts in this space. 
Two months into the war, it is clear 
that support from the United States 
and our allies has been essential in 
helping Ukraine resist Russia’s inva-
sion. But the bloodshed is very likely 
far from over, and the cost borne by 
the Ukrainian people has been im-
mense. According to the U.N., at least 
3,000 civilians have been killed since 
the start of the war, and the true num-
ber is unfortunately, sadly, far higher 
than that in all likelihood. 
The United States thus has a moral 
obligation to give the Ukrainian people 
the tools they need for as long as they 
need them, more money for Javelins, 
Stingers, howitzers, Switchblade un-
manned aerial munitions, and much 
more. And make no mistake, the Sen-
ate will move swiftly to get an emer-
gency funding package passed and sent 
to the President’s desk. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, on COVID, now, in 
addition to providing emergency fund-
ing to Ukraine, the Senate must also 
keep prioritizing another round of 
funds to fight COVID and keep our 
families safe. 
On Ukraine funding and COVID fund-
ing, Republican obstruction will not 
serve the American people. Instead of 
threatening political games, I urge 
Senate Republicans to work with us to 
get moving on COVID funding A-S-A-P. 
Over the past few months, the United 
States has made unmistakable progress 
in getting life closer to normal than at 
any other point since the spring of 2020. 
But as we all know, all it takes is an-
other nasty variant to force new clo-
sures of our schools, our businesses, 
our churches, our communities. 
Meanwhile, every day that we don’t 
act to pass new COVID funding is an-
other day that other nations place or-
ders on the remaining supply of vac-
cines, testing, and therapeutics—in 
particular, therapeutics. 
God forbid another variant begins 
spreading across the country, and we 
don’t have the tools, the medicines, the 
vaccines, the testing in place to re-
spond simply because our Republican 
friends have blocked our ability to fund 
now the ability to buy those materials, 
those vaccines, those therapeutics, and 
keep them on the ready if and when a 
new variant hits. 
If Republicans continue to obstruct 
more funding, then a few months from 
now we could be in the terrible situa-
tion of not having enough vaccines to 
save lives, enough tests or testing to 
monitor disease, and enough thera-
peutics to reduce the severity of cases 
of COVID when they come. 
Let me say that one more time. If 
Republicans continue to obstruct more 
funding now, then a few months from 
now, we could be in a terrible situation 
of not having vaccines to save lives,

testing to monitor the disease, and 
therapeutics to treat the disease. 
I don’t want to have to read that 
back in someone’s face 3 months later. 
I would rather have the funding now. 
That is what most Americans want. 
Please stop obstructing. We don’t need 
to go down that path, as I said. By now, 
we have tools and know-how to prevent 
closures of schools and of stores and of 
everything else in case another variant 
makes its unwelcome arrival. 
Now what we need is the funding to 
actually purchase the tools. They have 
been developed by American ingenuity, 
American companies; but other coun-
tries are buying them because we, ri-
diculously, stupidly, are not funding 
them because of obstruction across the 
aisle—political objectives getting in 
the way of the help, vitality, and re-
turn to normal of the American people. 
So we need to fund these—we need to 
actually purchase these tools now so 
that we are ready. 
Republicans should work with Demo-
crats to pass another COVID funding 
bill A-S-A-P. It is not really much 
harder than that. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
when it comes to addressing the many 
challenges facing America today, the 
Biden administration’s preferred strat-
egy is to blame someone else. 
President Biden has tried to blame 
the previous administration for the 
supply chain challenges, and he has 
also tried to blame the administration 
for his deadly and dangerous with-
drawal from Afghanistan in a precipi-
tous fashion, which our friends and al-
lies simply were left to read about it or 
hear about it in the newspaper and 
hustle to get their own people out of 
Afghanistan, as we were as well. 
And now we are seeing the blame 
game being played out again on the 
border. 
Last 
week, 
Secretary 
Mayorkas, the Secretary of Homeland 
Security, claimed the administration 
inherited, in his words, ‘‘a broken and 
dismantled system,’’ a defense we have 
heard before. 
Now, there is no question that our 
immigration system is in need of re-
form. As a matter of fact, we have been 
working on that the entire time I have 
been in the U.S. Senate. But as I have 
said before, we never fail to fail when it 
comes to fixing our broken immigra-
tion system. 
But the fact of the matter is the 
Biden administration is playing on the 
same field as previous administrations. 
Presidential 
authorities 
haven’t 
changed. Congress hasn’t passed sweep-
ing reforms that make it difficult to 
enforce our laws at the border. Yet, 
here we are, experiencing record levels 
of illegal immigration into the United 
States. 
Just to provide some historical con-
text for how bad President Biden’s first 
year in office stacks up against pre-
vious administrations, consider this: 
During the first year of the Obama ad-
ministration, an average of 44,000 mi-
grants were apprehended each month— 
that is each month—along the south-
western border. During the first year of 
the Trump administration, that num-
ber was cut in half because the Trump 
administration had different policies 
with regard to removing people who 
were illegally coming across the bor-
der, or if they were claiming asylum, 
making them wait until their claims 
were ruled on by an immigration judge 
in Mexico rather than being welcomed 
into the United States and never to be 
heard from again. 
So 44,000 a month for the Obama ad-
ministration; 20,000 a month for the 
Trump administration. But during the 
first year of the Biden administration, 
numbers took off like a rocket. 
An average of 176,000 migrants were 
apprehended at the southern border 
each month. One more time: 44,000 for 
President Obama; 20,000 for President 
Trump; 176,000 for President Biden. 
That is nearly nine times as many mi-
grants as we were seeing just 4 years 
ago. 
Again, Congress hasn’t passed any 
major laws that have caused this dra-
matic increase. President Biden has 
the same authorities as the previous 
administrations. He has been in office 
for more than a year and has had plen-
ty of opportunity to use the authori-
ties Congress has given him to address 
this humanitarian and national secu-
rity and public safety crisis. 
He has even had plenty of time to 
work with Congress to pass bipartisan 
bills, like my Bipartisan Border Solu-
tions Act, which I introduced with Sen-
ator SINEMA. And we now have a num-
ber of bipartisan cosponsors, and it was 
filed in the House with bipartisan sup-
port as well—HENRY CUELLAR, a Laredo 
Democrat, and TONY GONZALES from 
the largest contiguous border district 
in Texas and in the country—a Repub-
lican. 
So we introduced this bill. We laid it 
out for the administration, thinking 
that maybe, just maybe, if their poll 
numbers got bad enough, they would be 
looking for a lifeline, they would be 
looking for a way out. 
But the Biden administration has 
shown zero interest. The President has 
even threatened to end the use of title 
42, which is a public health law that 
gave the Border Patrol some tools to 
repel illegal immigration by single 
adult males. 
The Border Patrol told me a long 
time ago, even toward the end of the 
Trump administration, during the mid-
dle of the pandemic, that if they lost 
use of title 42 as a means to control im-
migration—admittedly not something 
that it was designed for but something 
they were able to use it for—they 
would lose control of the border com-
pletely. 
So far we have heard no suggestions 
by President Biden what he intends to 
do. We know title 42 won’t be there for-
ever. COVID won’t be a pandemic for-
ever. But what we would like to 
know—and I think what the American 
people deserve to know—is what they 
are going to do in terms of enforcing 
the law of the land once title 42 goes 
away. 
Well, last week, Secretary Mayorkas 
released what he called the ‘‘Depart-
ment of Homeland Security Plan for 
Southwest Border Security and Pre-
paredness.’’ 
Well, this plan is largely a recycled 
and repackaged version of the same 
vague promises that we have heard all 
along—bolstering resources, increasing 
efficiency, 
and 
administering 
con-
sequences for unlawful entry. 
Even the portion of this proposal 
that includes specifics, such as increas-
ing the use of expedited removal, are 
completely unrealistic. In order to use 
expedited removal—and that is the 
means by which the Border Patrol en-
counters someone and says: You can’t 
come into the United States and will 
be removed—you have to have enough 
manpower to process migrants and 
enough space to keep them in custody 
until that can happen. 
Without detention space, the promise 
of using expedited removal is a hollow 
one. Given the current pace of migra-
tion and the amount of beds that Cus-
toms and Border Protection has to de-
tain people who are subject to expe-
dited removal, given the current pace, 
the number of beds is a mathematical 
impossibility. 
Secretary Mayorkas said the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security has in-
creased the number of beds in Customs 
and Border Protection facilities and 
can now hold approximately 18,000 peo-
ple. 
Again, under the Biden administra-
tion, we have seen 176,000 people a 
month coming across the border. Sec-
retary Mayorkas is bragging about 
18,000 detention beds. Obviously, those 
beds would fill up quickly and be over-
whelmed. 
In March, an average of 7,000 mi-
grants crossed the border every day. 
The administration has predicted that 
if title 42 is lifted, which it has at-
tempted to do and still intends to do 
so, that number could reach 12,000 to 
18,000 migrants every day—12,000 to 
18,000 every day. And, obviously, all of 
those 18,000 beds for detention facilities 
would fill up in a single day. 
That is why I believe that this plan is 
not worth the paper it is written on un-
less the administration actually fol-
lows up to execute it; and, clearly, we 
are not seeing action, and, clearly, the 
arithmetic doesn’t work for Secretary 
Mayorkas’s plan. They are going to 
have to engage in the same sort of

catch-and-release 
game 
which 
the 
human smugglers and the drug cartels 
have been playing on for the foresee-
able past. And particularly now, they 
know that they can continue to over-
whelm the resources at the border, and 
then the drug cartels run drugs into 
the country. And those will then be 
distributed by criminal gangs in every 
major city in America. So this plan is 
not worth the paper it is written on. It 
clearly won’t solve the problem. 
Administration officials can blame 
someone else as long as they want, but 
it is clear the American people aren’t 
falling for it. 
We saw, in the last couple of days, 
President Biden’s own pollster said one 
of the reasons his poll numbers are so 
bad is because of the chaos and dangers 
associated with the border. 
What we are seeing—and what the 
American people plainly see—is a com-
plete and intentional policy breakdown 
that is the sole responsibility of the 
Biden administration. And these fail-
ures come with serious consequences 
for the American people. 
When thousands of migrants are com-
ing across the border every day, Border 
Patrol doesn’t have the time to deter 
illegal 
immigration 
and 
dangerous 
gang members and other criminals 
from coming across the border. 
Here is why. Several months ago, I 
visited Del Rio’s Border Patrol Sector 
and spoke with a group of about 30 Bor-
der Patrol agents at the muster. When 
they were asked to raise their hand if 
they would be working out in the 
field—that is, on the border—not a sin-
gle hand went up. These men and 
women who would normally be out on 
the 
frontlines 
stopping 
dangerous 
criminals and dangerous drugs from 
sneaking across the border are going to 
be tied up in paperwork with bogus 
asylum claims and administering these 
programs like this new program that 
Director Mayorkas is bragging about. 
Because of the huge surge of mi-
grants, we are going to continue to see 
the Border Patrol wrapped up in ad-
ministrative duties like paperwork, 
watching unaccompanied children, and 
transporting migrants, and they will 
not be on the frontlines in this war 
that we are seeing play out, particu-
larly the drug war playing out on our 
border. 
When the Border Patrol is taking 
care of an unaccompanied child, they 
can’t be on the frontlines. If they are 
knee-deep in paperwork, they can’t 
identify and stop dangerous individuals 
and drugs from coming across the bor-
der, and the drug cartels know it. As a 
matter of fact, this is part of their 
game plan. Flood the border with so 
many people that the Border Patrol 
can’t manage it, divert them from 
their law enforcement function and 
turn them into babysitters for unac-
companied children, and then the drug 
cartels will move their poison across as 
if they have established a four-lane 
highway. This is a dangerous situation 
that is putting our entire country at 
risk. 
Criminal gangs that are located in 
every major city in the United States, 
including Chicago and cities in Texas, 
are the distribution networks for the 
drugs that are brought across by the 
drug cartels. They see the gaps created 
by fewer officers on the frontline, and 
they are taking advantage. 
So we not only see foreign gang 
members, we also see a network of do-
mestic gang members who are engaged 
in violence, gun crimes, robberies, and 
other crimes that have threatened the 
safety of people in our cities across the 
country. But we also see dangerous 
criminals coming across the border 
itself. 
Last week, I spoke about a string of 
arrests that the Border Patrol in the 
Rio 
Grande 
Valley 
Sector 
accom-
plished. Border Patrol arrested half-a- 
dozen gang members in less than a 
week’s time. Some of these individuals 
were members of the notorious MS–13, 
a brutal criminal organization whose 
motto translates into, roughly, ‘‘kill, 
rape, control.’’ These are the types of 
individuals who are making their way 
across the border when the Border Pa-
trol is busy filling out paperwork or 
taking care of unaccompanied children 
and unable to perform their law en-
forcement functions. 
MS–13 is one of the most dangerous 
gangs on the planet. They have been 
known to kill their victims using 
knives, machetes, and baseball bats. In 
one murder in California, the victim’s 
heart was cut out. Five years ago, an 
MS–13 member had a dispute with a 
high school student. A group of gang 
members kidnapped the young man, 
cut off his hands, and then killed him. 
Stopping members of MS–13 and other 
international 
criminal 
gangs 
from 
reaching the United States should be a 
public safety imperative. 
American families are already deeply 
concerned about violent crime in our 
country, with the boneheaded idea of 
defunding the police and the blame 
game when it comes to law enforce-
ment, making it harder for police to be 
hired and retained by law enforcement 
agencies across the country. Criminals 
are having a heyday. Crime has spiked 
in virtually every major city across the 
country. I believe it is a combination 
of both the drugs that are trafficked by 
those criminal gangs as well as the im-
pression that we don’t respect and 
honor the public safety function per-
formed by our local police depart-
ments. But to my point here, we can’t 
allow the southern border to act as a 
corridor for more violent criminals to 
reach our communities. 
While overall border encounters sky-
rocketed in 2021, the number of gang 
members apprehended by Border Patrol 
actually decreased. Now, you might 
think that maybe that is a good thing, 
but you would be wrong, because last 
year alone, Border Patrol estimates 
that there were as many as 300,000 what 
they call getaways. In other words, if 
the Border Patrol is tied up with paper-
work or babysitting or transporting 
migrants and is no longer on the bor-
der, they don’t know who is coming 
across 
the 
border, 
but 
they 
guesstimated it was as many as 300,000 
getaways in the last fiscal year alone. 
So the fact that we haven’t been able 
to count more gang members this year 
is hardly an encouraging picture given 
the status quo. 
The Border Patrol has told us explic-
itly that gang members exploit migra-
tion surges in order to evade arrest. In 
other words, record levels of migration 
provide excellent cover for gang mem-
bers and other criminals. They can ei-
ther try to blend in with a larger group 
or they can identify and exploit the se-
curity gaps created by the Border Pa-
trol’s processing or caring for other mi-
grants. Sadly, both practices are com-
mon these days. 
When we look at all this data, there 
is one really important point that we 
need to remember. These are just the 
ones we know about. They don’t in-
clude the getaways. They don’t include 
the other dangerous criminals who 
have successfully snuck into our coun-
try or how many who were caught and 
then released because their gang affili-
ation was not yet known by law en-
forcement. We would much rather stop 
these criminals at the border than wait 
for them to reach our communities and 
endanger our families. 
In addition to the great work already 
being done by law enforcement gen-
erally, 
there 
are 
initiatives 
like 
Project Safe Neighborhoods at the De-
partment of Justice. This is one way 
that law enforcement is trying to wage 
war against these criminal gangs who 
use guns to commit acts of violence. It 
is 
a 
partnership 
between 
Federal, 
State, and local law enforcement that 
uses data-driven, evidence-based, and 
trauma-informed practices to reduce 
violent crime. But in order for them to 
be successful, we have to stem the flow 
of people coming across the border. 
Programs like Project Safe Neighbor-
hoods are exemplars of what law en-
forcement can do if we just give them 
a chance, if we just give them a level 
playing field to compete on rather than 
being overwhelmed by a tsunami of 
gang members, criminals, and illegal 
drugs. 
We have a responsibility to close the 
security gaps at the border to prevent 
even more dangerous individuals and 
drugs from reaching our communities, 
but again, based on the lack of interest 
expressed or actions taken, the Biden 
administration doesn’t seem to care. 
The Border Patrol has made no secret 
of the fact that it lacks the personnel, 
resources, and policies that only Con-
gress can provide to carry out their 
mission. Agents do not feel like the 
Biden administration has their back, 
and it is for good reason. 
Since President Biden took office, we 
have seen no meaningful action to ad-
dress the humanitarian and security 
crisis at the southern border. The 
Biden administration has ignored the 
needs of Federal law enforcement offi-
cers in order to appease, apparently,

part of its political base who doesn’t 
believe that there should be any border 
controls, who believes our borders 
should be open and are oblivious to the 
danger that poses. So, make no mis-
take about it, this is both a humani-
tarian and a security crisis, and the 
Biden administration’s refusal to act 
has only made things worse. 
We know the American people see 
crime as a big problem, and there are a 
lot of reasons for that, but the Biden 
administration needs to address the se-
curity breakdown at the border be-
cause what is happening there has 
made our communities even more dan-
gerous. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, well, I think, from the Presi-
dent’s comments at the Correspond-
ents’ Dinner the other night, it may 
have taken a year, but, finally, the 
President and the White House are 
starting to realize that they have lost 
the American people when it comes to 
their agenda. I think it is because you 
can only betray someone so many 
times before they stop giving you a 2nd 
chance, a 3rd chance, or even a 15th 
chance at doing something. 
After 16 months of alternating be-
tween anger, confusion, and fear, all 
Tennesseans can do is just have a laugh 
at what the White House is saying and 
how they are trying to spin what is ac-
tually happening and how they are try-
ing to tell you that what you are see-
ing is really not what you are seeing. 
They 
know—the 
American 
people 
know; Tennesseans know—that much 
of what you hear coming out of this ad-
ministration is coupled with a threat; 
it is coupled with a falsehood; some-
times it is even coupled with a man-
date. 
Joe Biden has lost what little control 
he had, but rather than reexamining 
his priorities, he has decided to cause 
as much pain as he can before the 
Democrats lose power. This is a pat-
tern. The Biden administration doesn’t 
lead; they mandate. They don’t come 
to Congress and say: Let’s do this or 
that; they throw out an Executive 
order. Then, when those mandates and 
orders that they are tossing out like 
they are candy backfire, they come 
about this by trying to inflict as much 
pain as they can. 
When business owners pushed back 
on pandemic mandates that made their 
survival impossible, this administra-
tion didn’t relent; they doubled down. 
They just accused everybody who dis-
agreed with them of being a danger to 
their communities. 
We all heard the stories: Oh, they are 
putting profit over people. Oh, they 
don’t care about their communities. 
They just want to keep the doors open. 
But no—what they wanted to do was 
serve their communities. 
When parents asked questions about 
what their kids were learning in 
school, the Justice Department threat-
ened to throw them in jail if they pro-
tested curriculum influenced by crit-
ical race theory and other radical 
ideologies. When the administration 
saw their climate panic message wasn’t 
resonating anymore, they came out 
with a plan to double down again and 
take away the few transportation and 
energy options people could still af-
ford. Their response to historic levels 
of inflation is to tax and spend the 
American people into submission. 
See, this is the way they do it: If you 
are a parent, you show up to ask ques-
tions about what you are seeing your 
child study. Then they want to report 
you and say: You are the one who is 
causing a problem. 
Isn’t it amazing how this administra-
tion has allowed cancel culture to infil-
trate everything that they do? 
It is their way or the highway, as we 
would say in Tennessee, because they 
plan to run over you; they plan to 
cause pain. This is not governing; it is 
punishment—punishment for your be-
liefs; punishment for your actions; pun-
ishment for standing up for the Con-
stitution, for democracy, for freedom 
of speech. They are going to punish 
you. 
Now, I thought that the administra-
tion had hit rock bottom with their re-
sponse to the recordbreaking inflation 
they created, but their plan to address 
Joe Biden’s border crisis has been what 
has taken the cake. It is foolish, and it 
is dangerous. 
The situation along our southern 
border is bad, and it is getting worse. 
Just this weekend, I spent some time 
out in West Tennessee. I was over in 
Benton County, which is the northwest 
corner of the State, and talked with 
Sheriff Kenny Christopher. He told me 
that his officers are finding fentanyl in 
about 80 percent of the drugs they 
seize. 
Everything 
is 
laced 
with 
fentanyl. This is marijuana, heroin, 
gummy bears—everything. Fentanyl is 
on the loose, running wild. Between 
2020 and 2021, 64,000 people in this coun-
try died from fentanyl overdoses, and 
2,014 of them were Tennesseans. Where 
is this coming from? It is coming right 
across that southern border. 
It is so important to note that this is 
a problem that escalated after Joe 
Biden became President. The cartels 
knew, with the Border Patrol, that 
Donald Trump had its back but that 
now, with Joe Biden, it is running wide 
open. Every town is a border town, 
every State a border State. We are los-
ing control over the flow of drugs. The 
cartels are in control of that southern 
border. You don’t come across without 
them. Nothing comes across without 
them. They are so emboldened that 
every law enforcement officer I meet 
with can tell you what cartel hub—that 
is right, cartel hub—here in this coun-
try, on U.S. soil, is setting up their 
drug trafficking, human trafficking, 
sex trafficking operations. Control is 
lost at that border. 
In March, CBP recorded more than 
220,000 encounters with people trying 
to illegally enter the country. Fortu-
nately, they were able to use title 42 
and expel about 100,000 of those 220,000 
individuals. 
Title 42 has been a lifesaver for the 
Border Patrol. Don’t believe me. Go 
ask them. They will tell you: That is a 
lifesaver. They have used it more than 
1 million times to deny entry and ease 
the strain on their limited resources. 
They need it. They need title 42, and 
they will tell you they need title 42. 
So, of course, the Biden administra-
tion is getting ready to take title 42 
away. Let’s just open that border up. It 
is endangering our sovereignty, endan-
gering our people. Every town is a bor-
der town, every State a border State; 
but let’s throw caution to the wind, 
open the border. Come one, come all. 
We had 160 different countries come 
across that border last year. Let’s see 
if we can break that record this year— 
that is what this White House is say-
ing, total disregard for the American 
people. Because if you take away title 
42, you are going to see not 6,000 illegal 
entries a day, you are going to see 
18,000 illegal entries a day. 
They know that this is what will hap-
pen. And do they have a plan? No, they 
don’t have a plan. They are expecting 
that 18,000 people a day. That works 
out to over a half million a month—a 
half million a month. 
Now, you know, Secretary Mayorkas 
admitted last week in his hearing that 
he just didn’t seem to have a plan, but 
he was expecting this to happen. 
In Tennessee, we have 345 cities, 
towns, and villages—345. Out of those 
345 cities and towns, 90 percent of those 
towns have a population of 20,000 or 
less; so it is the equivalent of the popu-
lation of a typical Tennessee town 
coming across the southern border 
every day. How long can we sustain 
that? 
Your State of Illinois, Madam Presi-
dent, you all have about 1,200 towns 
and cities that are incorporated. You 
have got 102 counties. Out of those 1,299 
incorporated towns and cities, 90 per-
cent of those, likewise, are 20,000 or 
less in population. Or if you had a half 
million a month, that is equal to a 
Naperville, Aurora, and Rockford to-
gether. How long could Illinois sustain 
that? 
See, this policy not only affects the 
border with the United States and Mex-
ico and those towns and communities 
and counties, it is every county in this 
country. 
When Mayorkas was speaking last 
week over in the House, what he didn’t 
do was confirm that the administration 
has a plan to reduce illegal immigra-
tion or, indeed, if they care at all about

securing the border. Imagine that: a 
Secretary of the Department of Home-
land Security who does not believe in a 
secure border. You cannot make this 
stuff up. You can’t make it up. 
For weeks now, a bipartisan group of 
Senators has pressed the Department 
of Homeland Security for their plan to 
secure the border, to secure this coun-
try. And for weeks, they have ignored 
our concerns. 
As of today, Chairman DURBIN has no 
plan to summon Secretary Mayorkas 
for a hearing so we can ask him di-
rectly. 
Last week, however, things escalated 
during a hearing at the House Appro-
priations Committee when the Sec-
retary confirmed that the administra-
tion is considering pulling staff and re-
sources out of the VA-run facilities and 
sending them to the border. 
This is crazy. It is not part of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs’ ‘‘Fourth 
Mission’’ to help the Biden administra-
tion save face. But even if it was, the 
VA is already struggling to serve vet-
erans. 
We are on the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. Our case backlog for benefits, 
for healthcare, is over 260,000 cases. 
And you are going to take resources 
and medical personnel and administra-
tive personnel and do what with them? 
Send them to the border. 
Getting basic care through the VA 
has become almost impossible. You 
hear it. I hear it. We all hear it from 
our veterans. And they know that 
these facilities are understaffed. This 
is why they are wanting to go to com-
munity care. And the Agency is experi-
encing a 15-year high in turnover for 
nurses. 
And what does this administration 
do? They say: We are going to take the 
people left working in VA healthcare 
and administration, we are going to 
shift them down to the border because 
the Border Patrol needs some help. 
Meanwhile, the people who have put on 
the uniform and have fought for this 
Nation can’t get healthcare. And this 
administration acts like they don’t 
give a ripping flip about any of it: the 
veterans, our Nation’s sovereignty, se-
curing the border, protecting our citi-
zens, eliminating the impact of drugs 
that are flooding our streets. To make 
our veterans suffer, that is unconscion-
able. 
The administration knows that bor-
der encounters have consistently in-
creased 
since 
the 
day 
they 
took 
power—they know this; they have 
watched it—and it appears that they 
have intentionally and purposefully al-
lowed it. 
They know that as long as the border 
is open, that people from all around the 
globe are going to come. As I said, 160 
different countries last year; of that, 42 
known terrorist watch list individ-
uals—42 of them. 
But rather than keeping title 42 in 
place or embracing ‘‘Remain in Mex-
ico’’ or building a wall or giving the 
Border Patrol the resources they have 
asked for years to defend this border, 
this administration has decided the 
way to go about this is to let the vet-
erans suffer. If they have waited 3 
months, 6 months, a year, they can 
wait a little longer. That is their 
thought: Take the resources out of VA 
and send it to the border. 
There 
is 
nothing 
compassionate 
about this narrative. There is nothing 
caring. There is nothing right about 
this narrative. 
You know, it is the reason that—as 
the President said, he knows his ap-
proval rating is low. He knows there is 
a reason for it. He is not doing any-
thing about it. He is choosing not to do 
anything about it. He is choosing not 
to shift his priorities. 
I will tell you, I have spent a lot of 
my adult life in the greatest creative 
community on the face of the Earth. 
We are surrounded by some writers and 
storytellers. And I would say that for 
some of the great authors and story-
tellers 
in 
the 
neighborhood, 
they 
couldn’t mash together a plotline as 
convoluted as this one, because people 
would say that would never happen in 
the United States. You would never see 
us purposefully running up inflation or 
running up the cost of energy or open-
ing our southern border and allowing 
terrorists and drug dealers and sex 
traffickers and human traffickers and 
gangs to run in. 
You would never knowingly allow 
cartels to set up shop on U.S. soil. You 
wouldn’t do that. But this administra-
tion has, and they did it because they 
know pain is the point. Suffering is the 
point. We are going to do this to you. 
It goes back to what I said many 
weeks ago. We, as conservatives, have a 
vision for better days, for hope, for op-
portunity for all, for preserving the 
freedom of this great Nation, for pre-
serving our rights, for protecting faith 
and freedom and families and hope and 
opportunity. And I fear that my Demo-
cratic colleagues, they have got an 
agenda. The agenda is what we are 
going to do to you in order to push a 
Marxist socialist agenda.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2240 
May 2, 2022 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). On this vote, the yeas are 54, the 
nays are 36. 
The motion is agreed to. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, for gen-
erations, manufacturing was the life-
blood of communities across Ohio and 
throughout the country. It was heavily 
unionized. The jobs paid well. It is not 
a coincidence that those two things go 
together. We know carrying a union 
card means better wages, better hope 
in retirement benefits, and more con-
trol over the workers’ schedule. 
These jobs allowed generations of 
Americans to build a middle-class life. 
But beginning in the seventies and 
eighties, we stopped making things in 
this country. Look at places like my 
hometown of Mansfield, OH. I went to 
Johnny Appleseed Junior High School, 
Mansfield Senior High School. I walked 
the halls with sons and daughters of 
autoworkers from GM and machinists 
of Ohio Brass and electrical workers 
from Westinghouse and rubber workers 
from Mansfield Tire and hundreds and 
hundreds of the sons and daughters of 
people in the building trades—laborers 
and pipe fitters and carpenters and 
millwrights and painters and one trade 
after another. Companies like Westing-
house and Tappan Stove all closed 
down one after another. Go to any 
town in Ohio and throughout the indus-
trial Midwest and people can name a 
similar list. 
We know what happened: Corpora-
tions in Ohio shut down production in 
Mansfield, my hometown, or Lorain, 
where I was today, or Youngstown or 
Cincinnati or Toledo, in search of 
cheaper labor, in search of right-to- 
work States, and in search of weaker 
workers’ compensation or unemploy-
ment benefit laws. They moved to Ala-
bama. They moved to Tennessee. They 
moved to Arkansas. 
And then, that wasn’t quite good 
enough. Then those same corporations 
lobbied Congress for trade agreements 
and tax treatments. So they then 
moved on to Mexico, and that labor 
wasn’t quite cheap enough, and they 
moved on to China. 
Ohio has paid the price for years in 
the form of lost jobs and lost opportu-
nities. Now—and I know what the Pre-
siding Officer has seen in the State of 
Maine. You understand this. The whole 
country pays the price—higher prices, 
supply chain delays, losing entire high- 
tech industries to competitors like 
China. 
Look where we’ve ended up. In Ohio, 
Thomas Edison invented the light bulb. 
Today, 99 percent of LED bulbs are 
made in China. 
America invented the semiconductor. 
Forty years ago, the U.S. produced half 
of the world’s semiconductors. Today it 
is 10 percent—about 75 percent made in 
East Asia. Look what happened. Dur-
ing the pandemic, companies across 
Ohio and the rest of the country shut 
down production lines not because 
there wasn’t demand, they shut down 
production lines and laid off workers 
because they couldn’t get enough semi-
conductors. 
Whether you are Ford in Lima, 
Whirlpool in Clyde, Kenworth in Chil-
licothe, OH, or Navistar in Springfield, 
you need these chips. 
It is why the Senate must fund the 
bipartisan CHIPS Act. We agreed to au-
thorize this program. Now it is time to 
move and to fund it. 
At the end of January, Senator 
PORTMAN and I flew to Columbus to 
join Intel to announce the largest ever 
domestic investment in semiconductor 
manufacturing. It will create 10,000 
good-paying jobs. Union tradespeople— 
5,000 union tradespeople—for 10 years 
will build this facility. Think of the 
magnitude of that. As we were flying in 
on the plane, I remember sitting with 
the Secretary of Commerce and Sen-
ator PORTMAN
and my friend Don 
Graves, from Cleveland—the No. 2 guy 
at Commerce. 
I looked out, and I said: 
Today, in Ohio, we are finally burying the 
term ‘‘Rust Belt.’’ 
It is possible because we are on the 
verge of passing this historic invest-
ment. The EU, China, Taiwan, and 
South Korea are all for providing in-
centives to make these chips domesti-
cally. None of them—none of them—re-
quire stock warrants as this motion 
would have us do. That is why I oppose 
this motion. Other countries are mim-
icking what we are doing. The EU, if 
Congress doesn’t move quickly on the 
CHIPS Act, is already trying to attract 
that business there. 
In the history of the United States, 
the only time we have ever required eq-
uity warrants from private companies 
is during times of war or in moments of 
financial and global crisis. It is not a 
bailout; it is an incentive. This motion 
to instruct conferees is well-inten-
tioned, but it won’t work. It will make 
the U.S. program less competitive. It is 
likely to cause these companies to 
make these chips overseas where they 
can get the same incentives without 
those strings. 
I understand Senator SANDERS’ goal. 
It is a goal I share. I just spoke with 
the Presiding Officer, and neither of us 
has a particularly favorable attitude 
toward what we have seen with stock 
buybacks and the damage that they 
have done to our economy and what it 
has meant in the undermining of com-
panies’ investments in their workers 
and in new product lines. I have had— 
I don’t know—6, 8, 10, 12 calls with the 
Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jay Pow-
ell, asking him—pleading with him— 
about restricting some of the stock 
buybacks at some of the largest Amer-
ican banks, especially during the pan-
demic. 
As I said, I understand Senator SAND-
ERS’ goal. We have got to make sure 
that the jobs that are created are good- 
paying ones where workers can build 
careers. That is why, in the CHIPS Act, 
we require the chips funding go to the 
construction or to the modernization 
of U.S. facilities to support American 
jobs, require chip applicants to make 
commitments to workers and commu-
nity investments, and require chips 
projects be sustainable without addi-
tional Federal funding. These are ini-
tial Federal investments that generate 
long-term, well-paying jobs. 
In both the Senate and House com-
petition bills, we also require chips re-
cipients to pay the prevailing wage to 
employees or contractors. That is why 
the United Auto Workers supports this 
position. They support chip funding. It 
is why the building trades support 
chips funding and oppose this SANDERS’ 
motion. 
I can tell you, from experience, if we 
drive these semiconductor jobs away, 
the alternative is not a replacement 
with other similarly high-quality jobs. 
Ohio has had that promise too often. 
Drive around Ohio, and you will see the 
alternative to low-wage, anti-union, 
big-box stores where workers have lit-
tle control over their schedules and lit-
tle power to build a better life. 
It is also important to remember 
that this investment isn’t just for 
semiconductors. It will affect smaller 
supply companies and their supply 
chains. It will affect all of the down-
stream industries that rely on these 
chips for all kinds of productions: ap-
pliances, auto, energy deployment. Our 
clean energy, independent future is 
going to rely on American-made semi-
conductor chips. 
Mr. President, I want to talk on one 
other motion that will be made in the 
next 48 hours, on this floor, to the 
CHIPS Act. 
We need to make more in this coun-
try. We shouldn’t be taking other ac-
tions that discourage domestic produc-
tion. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose a mo-
tion to instruct that supports a broad 
exclusion process for 301 tariffs for 
goods from China. Those tariffs are in 
place because of China’s unfair trade 
practices targeting our industrial base 
and Ohio jobs. The AFL–CIO opposes it. 
The U.S. Trade Rep’s office opposes it, 
and she was confirmed here in a unani-
mous vote. The Alliance for American 
Manufacturing opposes it. They know 
that any removal of these tariffs needs 
to be part of a broader, strategic ap-
proach to trade policy with China. 
We can’t let China undermine the in-
vestments that American manufactur-
ers make in workers and communities 
here in the United States. If we do this 
bill right, it will mean we will finally 
make more in America. We will begin 
bringing back the supply chains to our 
country. It will help us bury the term 
‘‘Rust Belt’’ once and for all. 
When you love this country, you 
fight for the people who make it work. 
That is what the CHIPS Act is about. 
It is about workers. It is about good- 
paying jobs. It is about increasing the 
unionization of workers in this coun-
try. It will lift all boats. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO KATHY O’NAN 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
when a tornado tore through the city 
of Mayfield, KY, last December, Amer-
ica’s eyes turned to the community. 
Volunteers, FEMA workers, and elect-
ed officials quickly rushed to the scene 
to offer our help. But in the aftermath 
of the devastating storm, amid all the 
commotion, one figure stood out above 
all the rest, rallying her town, coordi-
nating recovery efforts, and promising 
that Mayfield would bounce back, no 
matter how long it took to rebuild. 
That inspiring leader was Mayfield 
Mayor Kathy O’Nan, and today, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in honoring 
Mayor O’Nan for her leadership and for 
recently earning recognition as the 
Mayfield-Graves County Chamber of 
Commerce Woman of the Year. 
In the past few months, Mayor O’Nan 
has become a familiar figure to anyone 
tracking Western Kentucky’s recovery 
from last year’s tornados. To the resi-
dents of Mayfield, though, she has long 
served as a standalone advocate for 
their town and an exemplary commu-
nity leader. Mayor O’Nan got her start 
in Mayfield as a high school teacher 
and church choir director and still 
knows how to command a rowdy room, 
whether it is full of students or na-
tional reporters. She uses those skills 
to wear the many hats required of a 
mayor 
in 
a 
tight-knit 
town 
like 
Mayfield, 
from 
community 
cheer-
leader, to event coordinator, to busi-
ness developer. 
When I first arrived in Mayfield after 
last December’s storms, Mayor O’Nan 
came up to me immediately, rattling 
off all the Federal help her community 
needed to recover. On every subsequent 
visit, she has been there front and cen-
ter, ready to discuss storm relief. We 
have worked closely to provide Western 
Kentucky with the resources required 
to rebuild. I am incredibly grateful to 
have such a hard-working, knowledge-
able, and capable friend on the ground. 
Mayor O’Nan’s leadership has been 
noticed by figures around the country 
in the past few months. But, as always, 
her first priority is Mayfield, so I am 
confident her Woman of the Year 
Award from the Mayfield-Graves Coun-
ty Chamber of Commerce means more 
to her than any outside recognition 
ever could. After all, the residents of 
Mayfield aren’t just her constituents. 
They are also her neighbors, family, 
and friends. 
Mr. President, the Mayfield Mes-
senger highlighted Mayor O’Nan’s rec-
ognition as the Mayfield-Graves Coun-
ty Chamber of Commerce Woman of 
the Year in a recent article. I ask 
unanimous consent that the article be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Mayfield Messenger, Apr. 23, 2022] 
TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO VOLUNTEER: O’NAN 
NAMED AS MAYFIELD BUSINESS WOMAN OF 
THE YEAR 
The Mayfield-Graves County Chamber of 
Commerce held its annual Women in Busi-
ness luncheon at Trace Creek Baptist Church 
on Thursday. The event is held yearly to cel-
ebrate the accomplishments of females in 
the business industry within the community. 
The 2022 Kentucky Derby themed luncheon 
included lunch, a keynote speaker, and the 
announcement of the Woman of the Year 
award. This year’s recipient is Mayor Kathy 
O’Nan. 
‘‘Our award this year is named after Mary 
Propes, a woman who has served the commu-
nity for many years,’’ said Tanya Rose, vice- 
president of quality assurance research and 
development at Mayfield Consumer Prod-
ucts, presenting sponsor of the event. ‘‘Mary 
told me that she wants the recipient to be 
someone to have the commitment to this 
community as she does, someone who is an 
authentic role model. To lead by setting an 
example. We are looking for a female today 
to give this award to, that distributes that 
characteristic. She must have significant 
community involvement outside of what 
their job requires.’’ 
Ester Hubbard was brought onto the stage, 
along with the mayor’s daughters, Meg 
O’Nan-Holmes and Ellen O’Nan. 
When Hubbard first came to Mayfield in 
the 1980s, her husband had just had back sur-
gery and was hospitalized in Memphis. She 
had two young children at the time who were 
both in preschool. 
‘‘I thought woe is me. I’m here trying to 
take care of these children. Well, my friends 
told me about this woman in Mayfield who 
also had two preschool children, however, 
her husband has a brain tumor and he’s not 
expected to live,’’ said Hubbard. ‘‘I thought 
to myself—if she can do it. I can do it.’’ 
O’Nan quickly became Hubbard’s role 
model, before even knowing her. 
‘‘What a great role model she has been for 
me, for her girls, and for all of the people she 
has touched,’’ said Hubbard. 
O’Nan was a former teacher at Mayfield 
High School, and a choir director at her 
church prior to being elected mayor. 
‘‘She was such a good role model, and still 
is,’’ said Hubbard. ‘‘These young people that 
she was around—she was a social studies 
teacher, and part of that is citizenship. She 
didn’t talk about it, she acted on it.’’ 
Even though O’Nan was not born in 
Mayfield, Hubbard states that she was, and 
remains a wonderful part of this community. 
‘‘She gave to the school, going to every 
game or activity scheduled. She gave to the 
church, she gave to the community,’’ said 
Hubbard. ‘‘But she still had time for real 
emergencies, like when my Jake was in sec-
ond grade and they wouldn’t let him practice 
because he didn’t have all his gear. We 
hopped in the car and got him some, because 
to K.O. (O’Nan), that was an emergency.’’ 
O’Nan is known for her heart to help oth-
ers, and her want to ease pain and put hope 
into the universe. At 5 a.m. on Dec. 11, O’Nan 
told 
the 
nation 
about 
the 
devastation 
Mayfield had just gone through—but also 
that there’s always hope. 
‘‘I woke up the morning after the tornado, 
texts from people asking if we were okay of 
course,’’ said Hubbard. ‘‘But then the rest 
were saying that my mayor was awesome. I 
was absolutely overwhelmed with the num-
ber of calls telling me over and over that my 
mayor is fantastic.’’ 
Ellen O’Nan spoke out about her mother’s 
nickname—K.O. 
‘‘It originated when I was a senior in high 
school. I used to be grounded a lot, and when 
people would ask if I could do something— 
friends would say ‘she can’t, she’s grounded, 
K.O. says no,’ ’’ said Ellen. ‘‘I always thought 
it was fitting though, because, in the boxing 
world, K.O. means to knock out. That’s how 
she always approached challenges, anything 
hard in her life. She’d just knock them out.’’ 
As Ellen O’Nan thanked her mother for 
teaching her lessons about knocking out, 
O’Nans other daughter, Meg O’Nan-Holmes 
spoke about how she admired her mother 
throughout her life for so many things. 
‘‘For the entirety of my life, I’ve admired 
you,’’ said Meg O’Nan-Holmes. ‘‘But the big-
gest thing I admire is how strong you are. 
When I think about strong women, I think 
about her.’’ 
‘‘I’m not a businesswoman. I’m an old 
school teacher, and I’m very proud to be an 
old school teacher,’’ said O’Nan. ‘‘It’s an 
honor to stand in front of you today. When 
my daughters were three and six, my hus-
band did pass away.’’ 
O’Nan stated through all the pain and sor-
row, a friend of hers said that she had been 
given a gift. She would have a special rela-
tionship with both of her daughters. 
‘‘I’ve done some really fun things in life, 
received honors I probably only half deserve, 
but in no way ever can I ever dispute the fact 
that the greatest part of my life is these two 
girls,’’ said O’Nan. ‘‘They are my life. And 
life is to be fun.’’ 
O’Nan pointed out the women at her table, 
who work in Mayfield’s city government. 
‘‘There are ten women who work in our 
government—if you were my student, you 
should know how important women getting 
the right to vote is to me,’’ said O’Nan. ‘‘I al-
ways talked about my hero, Alice Hall. 
These ten women who sit with me at this 
table would not be here in this position 
today if it were not for our sisters who 
fought before us, to get us that way. To have 
a right to vote, to serve—to realize our im-
portance.’’ 
Keynote speaker Alyson Van Hooser, spoke 
on the true meaning of leadership. She noted 
that meeting a need, and seeing a need is the 
importance of a true leader. That leadership 
is not a title, however, it is a characteristic. 
Attendees were given a copy of Van 
Hooser’s book, ‘Accelerate Your Success,’ 
along with a goodie bag filled with items 
from this year’s sponsors. 
The following were sponsors of the event: 
Mayfield Consumer Products, FNB Bank, Re- 
Fabbed Boutique, Fox Wealth Management, 
US Bank, CFSB, WK&T, First Kentucky 
Bank, Regions Bank, Mayfield Water and 
Electric Systems, West Kentucky Rural 
Electric, AwardMasters, Centrifugal Tech-

REMEMBERING JAMES K. JACKSON 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to remember and honor James K. 
Jackson, specialist in International 
Trade and Finance in the Foreign Af-
fairs, Defense, and Trade Division of 
the Congressional Research Service, 
CRS. James passed away on February 
17, 2022, after a serious illness. He had 
a distinguished career of more than 35 
years at CRS, serving Congress on 
international trade and economic pol-
icy issues. 
James exemplified the very best of 
CRS during his decades of direct sup-
port for Congress. He achieved a re-
markable record of accomplishment 
through his work for Members and con-
gressional staff. James played a vital 
role in Congress’ consideration of im-
portant legislation and was well known 
for his authoritative analysis of crit-
ical international economic and policy 
issues before Congress, including on 
foreign investment and reform of the 
Committee on Foreign Investment in 
the 
United 
States—CFIUS—when 
I 
chaired the Senate Banking Com-
mittee. He also was intricately in-
volved in major trade policy legislation 
and debates before the Senate Finance 
Committee, including its work on un-
derstanding the economic effects of 
U.S. trade agreements before Congress. 
My senior staff used to tell me that 
they had James on speed dial during 
the major reform of the CFIUS process 
during 2017–2018, a testament to James’ 
expertise and assistance on this major 
legislation. 
There are many more examples of 
James’ authoritative, nonpartisan, and 
objective expertise and analysis for 
Congress. In addition to being an ex-
pert on foreign investment and related 
policies, James had deep knowledge of 
the United States’ role in the global 
economy and most recently was the 
lead CRS expert on the global effects of 
COVID–19, writing and consulting ex-
tensively for Congress on this issue. He 
had deep expertise in international ec-
onomics and trade and was gifted in ex-
plaining complicated economic issues 
in a way that those without an eco-
nomics background could understand. 
During the 2008–2009 global financial 
crisis, James played a key role in help-
ing Congress to understand the deep 
interconnected nature of the crisis and 
its 
financial 
and 
economic 
underpinnings at work in major econo-
mies. His work in explaining the eco-
nomics of trade and trade agreements 
was invaluable, especially during the 
Senate Finance Committee’s consider-
ation of major free trade agreements. 
The breadth and depth of James’ inter-
national economic policy expertise will 
be truly missed as Congress continues 
its work on these important issues. 
I offer my sincere condolences to 
James’ family, friends, and his col-
leagues at CRS during this difficult 
time and hope they may take comfort 
in the knowledge of his indelible con-
tribution to the work of Congress on 
international trade and economic pol-
icy. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I also 
rise today to remember and honor the 
distinguished service of James Jack-
son. 
For decades, James devoted his time 
and talent to helping Congress under-
stand complex international trade and 
economic policy issues. I am thankful 
to have been a beneficiary of James 
hard work. During the 115th Congress’ 
when Senator CRAPO and I served as 
chair and ranking member of the Sen-
ate committee on Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs, the Committee un-
dertook a substantial effort to con-
sider, and ultimately enact, legislation 
that reformed the process for screening 
foreign 
investment 
in 
the 
United 
States. As Senator Crapo noted, we re-
lied on James’ thoughtful analysis and 
expertise throughout the consideration 
of that important legislation. James 
briefed staff. evaluated proposed legis-
lative language. and provided com-
prehensive. detailed analysis and re-
ports during consideration of the bill. 
After it became law, the committee 
continued to rely on James to evaluate 
the executive branch’s implementation 
of it. 
I join Senator CRAPO in offering my 
sincere condolences to James’ friends 
and family and his colleagues at CRS. 
They are in our thoughts during this 
difficult time.

TRIBUTE TO RALPH WHITE 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
as a member of the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee, I would like to recog-
nize an outstanding public servant, Mr. 
Ralph White, who has dedicated his ca-
reer to providing bidders for govern-
ment contracts with an inexpensive 
and expeditious means to seek account-
ability within the government con-
tracting process. Mr. White will retire 
on May 29, 2022, after a distinguished, 
39–year career in public service, includ-
ing serving 33 years at the Government 
Accountability Office—GAO—where he 
is currently a managing associate gen-
eral counsel for the procurement law 
division. 
As a Senate staffer during the begin-
ning of his career, Mr. White was in-
strumental in the drafting of the Com-
petition in Contracting Act of 1984, 
which establishes statutory authority 
for GAO’s bid protest function, under 
which thousands of bid protests are 
filed each year. Since joining GAO in 
1989, Mr. White handled bid protests as 
a writing attorney/hearing officer, as 
an assistant general counsel leading a 
team of GAO attorneys, and since early 
2010, as a managing associate general 
counsel leading GAO’s bid protest 
forum. Since becoming a managing as-
sociate general counsel, Mr. White has 
successfully led GAO’s procurement 
law division through numerous large 
and complicated bid protests and has 
been recognized by the government 
contracting 
community 
as 
a 
pre-
eminent legal mind in this field. In rec-
ognition of this expertise and knowl-
edge, he is regularly sought out to 
speak and provide insights into the bid 
protest process throughout the govern-
ment, 
academia, 
and 
industry. 
Throughout his tenure, Mr. White has 
managed the resolution of protests 
that have touched upon nearly every 
aspect of federal procurement spend-
ing. In addition, Mr. White has received 
numerous awards during his GAO ca-
reer, including GAO’s Distinguished 
Service award in 2013 and the General 
Counsel’s Award in March 2010 for out-
standing leadership on several initia-
tives relating to GAO’s bid protest 
process, as well as contributions to 
many significant bid protest decisions. 
Thanks to the dedication and exper-
tise of Mr. White, our government con-
tracting process provides bidders with 
an inexpensive and expeditious means 
to report violations of procurement law 
and regulation, to the benefit of all 
that 
value 
transparency, 
account-
ability, and functionality in govern-
ment.

TRIBUTE TO COLONEL SCOTT 
WILKINSON 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
today I honor a superb leader, liaison, 
and soldier. After a year of service with 
the Army Office of the Chief, legisla-
tive liaison, as the chief, Army Senate 
Liaison Division, COL Scott Wilkinson 
was selected to serve as the deputy 
commanding officer for Support with 
the 101st Airborne Division at Fort 
Campbell. On this occasion, I believe it 
is 
fitting 
to 
recognize 
Colonel 
Wilkinson’s distinguished service and 
dedication to fostering the relationship 
between the U.S. Army and this Cham-
ber. 
Colonel Wilkinson grew up in an 
Army family. He received his commis-
sion in 1994 as the Distinguished Mili-
tary Graduate of the Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology ROTC program 
and his undergraduate degree from 
Harvard University. An aviation officer 
by designation, Colonel Wilkinson has 
led our Nation’s young men and women 
at home and abroad, most prominently 
as the chief of staff for the U.S. Army 
Special Operations Command, located 
at Fort Bragg, NC, and commander of 
the 160th Special Operations Aviation 
Regiment, located at Fort Campbell, 
KY. Colonel Wilkinson has also served 
in multiple command and staff posi-
tions within the 160th Special Oper-
ations Aviation Regiment. Known as 
the Night Stalkers, soldiers of the 
160th 
Special 
Operations 
Aviation 
Regiment are highly trained and have 
been actively and continuously en-
gaged in the combat operations since 
October 2001. 
The Army has consistently relied 
upon Colonel Wilkinson for his excep-
tional 
leadership 
and 
unparalleled

work ethic. He has deployed widely for 
training across Europe, the Middle 
East, and Africa; operationally in sup-
port of Operations JOINT ENDEAVOR 
and 
JOINT 
GUARD 
in 
Bosnia- 
Herzegovina; and to combat in support 
of multiple contingencies and named 
operations 
including 
ENDURING 
FREEDOM, 
FREEDOM 
SENTINEL, 
IRAQI 
FREEDOM, INHERENT RE-
SOLVE, and YUKON SCEPTER. 
Colonel Wilkinson has excelled in nu-
merous other leadership positions in 
the Army, most recently as the chief, 
Army Senate Liaison. In the Russell 
Senate Office Building and around the 
globe, Colonel Wilkinson continued the 
tradition of strengthening Army rela-
tionships with Members of Congress 
and their staffs. 
Over the course of the last year, 
Colonel Wilkinson provided support to 
multiple congressional delegations to 
locations within the United States and 
to various countries around the world. 
He became a trusted adviser and friend 
to many of us. He distinguished himself 
by going above and beyond the call of 
duty to facilitate and successfully exe-
cute each and every trip, despite any 
number of weather, aircraft, and diplo-
matic complications. 
This June, Colonel Wilkinson departs 
Washington, DC. This Chamber will 
feel his absence. I join many past and 
present Members of Congress in my 
gratitude and appreciation to Colonel 
Wilkinson for his outstanding leader-
ship and unwavering support of the 
missions of the U.S. Army. I especially 
recognize his patient and supportive 
family, Mrs. Mindy Wilkinson, and his 
two daughters, Blakely and Parker. I 
wish this Army family the best as they 
move to Fort Campbell.

TRIBUTE TO DAN AND JAN 
SMOOTS 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today during national small busi-
ness week to honor and recognize Dan 
and Jan Smoots of Emporia, KS. The 
Smoots were recently announced as the 
Small Business Administration’s Small 
Business Persons of the Year for Kan-
sas, and once you hear why, it is clear 
to see they are more than deserving of 
the award. 
The 
Smoots’ 
business, 
Fanestil 
Meats, was recognized in part for sur-
viving multiple flood disasters on the 
Cottonwood 
River. 
Their 
facility’s 
foundation is just south of Emporia in 
the flood plain, making it susceptible 
to 
flooding 
any 
given 
year. 
Yet, 
through the hurdles, the Smoots per-
severed to keep their business running. 
Of course, the COVID–19 pandemic 
brought on a whole new set of chal-
lenges for the Smoots, but once again, 
they trekked along. With 100 employ-
ees to take care of, along with unprece-
dented supply chain disruptions, they 
had to be resourceful through this new 
challenge. Thankfully, Fanestil Meats 
was able to secure a loan through the 
Paycheck Protection Program, which 
the Smoots say was instrumental in 
keeping the business afloat throughout 
the pandemic. 
Moving forward, Fanestil Meats is 
now constructing a new 40,000-square- 
foot meat-processing facility that will 
replace the original plant and help ex-
pand the worldwide reach of their be-
loved product, the Party Time Ham. 
The new facility is located adjacent to 
the cold storage warehouse, retail 
store, and administrative offices that 
were constructed in 2015 in Emporia, 
KS. 
This award is truly an honor that ev-
eryone at Fanestil should be proud of. 
The Smoots have worked long and hard 
to expand and improve this business 
since they took over in 1997, which is 
no small task. Yet, thanks in part to 
the Smoots’ ownership, Fanestil con-
tinues to rise to the occasion and pros-
per, even when faced with adversity. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing Dan and Jan Smoots for their 
dedication to their business and for 
representing Kansas greatly.

∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I rise to recognize Mr. John 
James Lenehan, Jr., a remarkable man 
and Korean war veteran who graduates 
from college on May 21, 2022, at the age 
of 88. 
The son of Irish immigrants, Mr. 
Lenehan was born on April 5, 1934. He 
was raised alongside his four siblings in 
a one-bedroom apartment in Queens. 
Upon graduating from high school, Mr. 
Lenehan was drafted into the U.S. 
Army, serving at Fort Dix. Thanks to 
the GI Bill, he was able to pursue his 
dream of higher education and enrolled 
at Fordham University. Mr. Lenehan 
took night classes while working at 
KLM Airlines, where he met his future 
wife, Lillian. When KLM transferred 
Mr. Lenehan to the Houston office, the 
couple moved to Texas the day after 
their wedding, and Mr. Lenehan had to 
pause his studies. 
The Lenehan family lived in Walling-
ford, CT, for 6 years. While there, Mr. 
Lenehan began working for Xerox, 
where he quickly gained recognition 
for his determination. During this 
time, he took several classes at Sacred 
Heart University and Yale University, 
but never had a sufficient chance to 
complete his degree. He eventually re-
tired in 1991, only to start a new com-
pany with his wife before long. Mr. 
Lenehan retired a second time, moving 
with Mrs. Lenehan to a cottage in the 
west of Ireland. 
Last spring, Mr. Lenehan decided he 
wanted to make the time to obtain his 
college degree, so he wrote to the presi-
dent of Fordham University, request-
ing the opportunity to finish his stud-
ies nearly 70 years after he began. The 
university 
accepted 
him, 
and 
this 
month, Mr. Lenehan will achieve his 
dream of completing his undergraduate 
education. He will be Fordham Univer-
sity’s oldest ever graduate when he re-
ceives his diploma on May 21, 2022. 
Mr. Lenehan’s lifelong commitment 
to pursuing his studies and supporting 
his family will be an enduring legacy. 
He and his wife instilled a love of 
learning in their children that they in 
turn have passed on to their own chil-
dren. I now join his 6 children and 13 
grandchildren in saluting Mr. Lenehan. 
I applaud his many accomplishments 
and hope my colleagues will join me in 
congratulating Mr. John Lenehan, Jr., 
on this milestone of his graduation.∑

REMEMBERING ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ 
EDGAR ROSE 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
today I recognize Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Edgar 
Rose, who passed away on February 14, 
2022. Bob served as Nevada’s 26th Lieu-
tenant Governor and as chief justice of 
the Nevada Supreme Court. He will be 
greatly missed and always remembered 
for his invaluable contributions to the 
State of Nevada. 
Bob grew up in Livingston, NJ. After 
law school, Bob moved to Nevada to 
clerk for the Nevada Supreme Court. 
He then went on to practice law in 
Reno before serving as chairman of the 
Nevada 
Democratic 
Party 
and 
as 
Washoe County district attorney. In 
1974, he was elected Lieutenant Gov-
ernor of Nevada. During his decades of 
service to the State of Nevada, Bob 
made a difference in every role in 
which he served. 
As Lieutenant Governor, Bob worked 
to safeguard the rights of all Nevadans. 
He strongly advocated for the Equal 
Rights Amendment to ensure equality 
under the law for women. Despite polit-
ical backlash at the time, Bob cast the 
deciding vote to send the amendment 
to the Nevada Assembly in 1977. Al-
though Nevada did not ratify the 
amendment until 2017, Bob was recog-
nized for his early leadership in this 
fight for equality. This important vote 
may have cost him the chance to be 
Governor, but Bob believed in doing 
what was right. Following Bob’s term 
as 
Lieutenant 
Governor, 
Governor 
Richard Bryan appointed him to the 
Eighth Judicial District Court in Las 
Vegas. 
In 1988, Bob achieved his lifelong 
dream of winning a seat on the Nevada 
Supreme Court. During his 18 years on 
the bench, he led efforts to modernize 
and improve Nevada’s judicial system. 
Bob helped establish the Nevada Judi-
cial Assessment Commission and the 
Jury Improvement Commission. Addi-
tionally, he pushed the court to man-
date a statewide seminar on standard-
ized practices for domestic violence 
cases. Nevada became the first State in 
the country to require such judicial 
training. In recognition of his many ac-
complishments and contributions, the 
Nevada Supreme Court awarded Bob 
the first Legacy of Justice Award in 
2009.

At every opportunity, Bob dem-
onstrated his strong commitment to 
justice. I know that his courage, integ-
rity, and dedication to the rule of law 
will not be forgotten. My thoughts are 
with Bob’s wife, Jolene, and with his 
family and friends during this time of 
loss.∑

REMEMBERING RABBI MENACHEM 
MENDEL SCHNEERSON 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, today, I 
want to honor Rabbi Menachem Mendel 
Schneerson, who led the Lubavitch 
movement and contributed greatly to 
education, 
morality, 
and 
charity 
worldwide. 
Menachem 
Mendel 
Schneerson, much like his father, was 
a rabbi and scholar who served his 
community immensely. April 12, 2022, 
marks the celebration of what would 
have been the Rebbe’s 100th birthday. 
In 
1941, 
Rabbi 
Schneerson, 
also 
known as the rebbe, fled war-torn Eu-
rope, and arrived in the United States. 
As a refugee who experienced the des-
potic rule of Stalinist Russia and the 
horrors of Nazi Germany, he under-
stood the importance of faith in times 
of hardship. Upon arriving in New 
York, 
Rabbi 
Schneerson 
led 
the 
Chabad-Lubavitch 
movement. 
This 
movement grew greatly under Rabbi 
Schneerson’s leadership and helped to 
guide the Jewish community after the 
atrocities of the Holocaust. 
By the time of Rabbi Schneerson’s 
death in 1994, the Chabad-Lubavitch 
movement consisted of over 2,000 insti-
tutions with centers in cities and uni-
versity 
campuses 
worldwide. 
These 
outreach 
organizations 
function 
to 
teach people about Judaism and foster 
the Jewish identity. 
Rabbi Schneerson also published re-
nowned works on the Torah and Juda-
ism. His work continues to lead many 
in spirituality, learning, and the proc-
ess of restrengthening the Jewish faith 
internationally. He understood that all 
were created equal and exemplified this 
in his inclusion of every man, woman, 
and child in his teachings. 
Rabbi 
Schneerson’s 
extraordinary 
life and work has long been recognized 
by the Congress and, in 1994, was post-
humously awarded the Congressional 
Gold Medal for his contributions. 
Today, we celebrate the life of Rabbi 
Menachem Mendel Schneerson. The 
rebbe was an individual who exempli-
fied channeling personal struggles into 
positive change internationally. His 
legacy lives on through the impacts he 
made, and the many Chabad centers 
worldwide, including those in Ken-
tucky. For Kentuckians, Americans, 
and all in the international commu-
nity, 
Rabbi 
Menachem 
Mendel 
Schneerson’s efforts will continue to 
make an impact well beyond the cen-
tury since his birth.∑

RECOGNIZING A PLACE TO 
BELONG HOME CARE 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, A Place To 
Belong Home Care of Radcliff, KY, as 
the Senate Small Business of the Week. 
It is not every week that I have the 
privilege of honoring a veteran-owned 
small business, but when I do, it is with 
profound gratitude and respect not 
only for this Kentucky entrepreneur, 
but for our men and women in uniform. 
A Place to Belong Home Care was 
founded by SFC Lolita R. Martin who, 
before opening her business, spent 24 
years in uniform, 3 and half of which 
spent on the battlefield in support of 
Iraq Freedom and Enduring Freedom. 
Even while serving her country over-
seas, Ms. Martin knew that entrepre-
neurship was her next calling. With 
that in mind, Ms. Martin remained 
steadfast in her desire to continue 
serving others in her career, which led 
her to the idea of senior care. Thus, 
after retiring from a lengthy career in 
our Nation’s uniform, Lolita Martin 
founded A Place to Belong Home Care 
in 2019. 
The mission behind A Place To Be-
long Home Care is to improve the qual-
ity of life for aging adults and to sup-
port their families in caring for loved 
ones. The business provides a wide va-
riety of services, not limited to elderly 
care. Whether the client is an adult or 
child with special needs, recovering 
from surgery or illness, or managing a 
disease or lifelong condition, A Place 
To Belong Home Care is there to help. 
And with services offered in Hardin, 
Bullitt, Meade, and Grayson County, as 
well as in other parts of Kentucky, Ms. 
Martin 
ensures 
that 
her 
business 
reaches the broad scope of needs for 
anyone requiring daily care. 
Upon her retirement from the U.S. 
Armed Forces, Ms. Martin was primed 
for her current career. During her third 
deployment to Iraq, Ms. Martin began 
pursuing her Bachelor of science in 
healthcare management. A require-
ment for the degree was a capstone 
project on senior care, thus the seed for 
A Place To Belong Home Care was 
planted. The idea grew and developed 
throughout her time protecting our 
Nation; hence there is no doubt as to 
why her business has seen such success 
and growth in Kentucky. In 2019, Ms. 
Martin was proud to receive the Best in 
Class Home Health Certification from 
the 21st Century Health Care Consult-
ants group. After caring for others 
throughout her life, Ms. Martin clearly 
is the right fit for the job. 
This entrepreneur also understands 
the importance of maintaining an ac-
tive presence in her local community. 
Ms. Martin preserves her dedication to 
national service by being an active 
member of the National Association of 
Black Veterans, the Kentucky Colonel, 
and the Veterans of Foreign Wars 
group. Though this patriot has moved 
on from her Active-Duty career, she 
stays true to her roots as she ventures 
into an equally honorable career of 
providing care for those who are not 
able to take full care of themselves. 
Congratulations to Lolita Martin and 
the entire team at A Place To Belong 
Home Care. I thank you for your brave 
service to this country and for your en-
during desire to serve others. I wish 
the whole team the best of luck and 
look forward to watching their contin-
ued growth and success in Kentucky.∑

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
KENTUCKY 
CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL AS-
SOCIATION OF WOMEN BUSINESS 
OWNERS 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the Ken-
tucky Chapter of the National Associa-
tion of Women Business 
Owners— 
NAWBO—provides dynamic opportuni-
ties for women to network with other 
business owners, mentor one another, 
develop partnerships, and incubate and 
foster that next big idea. It is com-
prised of women of all ages and levels 
of experience from all sectors of the 
marketplace. 
This year, as NAWBO Kentucky cele-
brates three decades of success stories 
that are as diverse as our Common-
wealth, its members have established a 
Legacy Award to recognize women 
business owners who have excelled for 
30 or more years. The first to be hon-
ored in such a way is Alice Houston, of 
Louisville. Alice is known as an entre-
preneur, the president and CEO of the 
largest minority-owned transportation 
company in North America; as a tire-
less and dedicated board member, of 
such organizations as the Federal Re-
serve Bank of St. Louis and the Na-
tional Urban League; as a philan-
thropist, leading with her own gen-
erosity to raise funds for worthy causes 
and institutions; and as a wife, mother, 
and grandmother. She embodies the 
true character of the Legacy Award. 
Every young woman who wants to be 
a trailblazer, who envisions a life of 
giving back while moving forward, or 
who is struggling to chart a bold new 
direction for her business is thankful 
that there are real-life phenomena like 
Alice Houston, whose business acumen, 
love of family and community, and 
generosity of spirit light a pathway to 
great possibilities. 
I am proud to salute the Kentucky 
Association of Women Business Owners 
on its 30th anniversary and to honor 
Alice Houston as the inaugural recipi-
ent of its Legacy Award.∑

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.A. 
SPRINKLERFITTERS LOCAL NO. 704 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the 100th anniver-
sary of U.A. Sprinklerfitters Local No. 
704 of metro Detroit. Functioning 
under different names and charters 
over the past century, the Local has 
supported the employment of its mem-
bers, while simultaneously bargaining 
for higher wages and better benefits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2245 
May 2, 2022 
In 
May 
of 
1907, 
Sprinklerfitting 
tradesmen in the Detroit area came to-
gether in their first effort to organize. 
They were rewarded for their efforts 
with a charter by the United Associa-
tion 
of 
Plumbers, 
Gasfitters, 
and 
Steamfitters of the U.S. and Canada— 
U.A.—as Local No. 358. Initial opti-
mism quickly dimmed, as the Local 
faced 
opposition 
from 
surrounding 
contactors and companies. Disbanding 
and reorganizing twice, the Local re-
emerged as Local No. 669 in 1915 and 
was granted a new charter by the U.A. 
It would operate under this charter for 
another 32 years. 
Within its first 7 years of formation, 
leaders from Local No. 669 had success-
fully argued for 2 consecutive years of 
wage increases and the addition of a 
local U.A. auxiliary office location to 
better serve the craftsmen of the re-
gion. This sense of unity was in no 
small part responsible for helping the 
local weather the economic devasta-
tion of America’s Great Depression, 
which stifled progress across the coun-
try’s economy for nearly a decade. 
Membership in Local No.669 protected 
the wages and working conditions of 
sprinklerfitters in Detroit throughout 
the economic crisis. 
Passage of the New Deal legislation 
by President Franklin Delano Roo-
sevelt provided work opportunities in 
the form of public projects, supporting 
the sprinklerfitters of Local No. 669. In 
1941, as the United States formally an-
nounced their entrance into the Second 
World War, factories in Detroit quickly 
pivoted to join the efforts turning the 
city into the ‘‘biggest war boomtown of 
them all.’’ Among the projects under-
taken by Local No. 669 in this time was 
the outfitting of the Ford Willow Run 
Bomber Plant in Ypsilanti. In 1947, 
Local No. 669 once again reorganized, 
taking on the charter of Local No. 704 
with jurisdiction over sprinklerfitting 
work in Wayne, Macomb, and Oakland 
Counties, with nearby Washtenaw join-
ing a decade later. Local No. 704 con-
tinued 
to 
enjoy 
positive 
growth 
throughout the 1950s and 1960s, increas-
ing their number of journeymen and 
apprentices, along with increased bene-
fits and wages. 
This progress would begin to falter as 
the local headed into the 1970s and 
companies began moving factories to 
‘‘right to work states,’’ decreasing one 
of their core contract bases. Despite 
the auto flight, members of Local No. 
704 
remained 
well 
employed 
and 
worked on a variety of local projects, 
including the Pontiac Silverdome and 
Detroit’s Joe Louis Arena and Renais-
sance Center. Although they faced low 
employment in the first half of the dec-
ade, by the end of the 1980s, Local No. 
704 had helped build, along with many 
other projects, the Detroit Hamtramck 
Assembly Plant, the Patrick V. McNa-
mara Federal Building, the Chrysler 
World Head Quarters and Techno-
logical Center, the Palace of Auburn 
Hills and would close out the decade 
with a newly negotiated contract with 
the National Fire and Sprinkler Asso-
ciation, formerly known as the U.A. 
Demand for work remained strong 
throughout the 1990s, and Local No. 704 
entered the new millennium with a ro-
bust membership able to meet the de-
mands of the growth of local auto-
makers and universities. Between 2000 
and 2007, Local No. 704 assisted in the 
construction of the General Motors As-
sembly Center, the north terminal of 
the Detroit airport, Detroit’s MGM 
Grand and Greektown Casinos, and the 
Henry Ford Hospital in West Bloom-
field. The Great Recession of 2008 
stalled much employment in the area 
for a number of years, bringing mem-
bership in Local No. 704 down by nearly 
half. However, as work slowly started 
to resume in 2011 and 2012, Local No. 
704 was able to rely on its history of 
strong organization skills to success-
fully secure jobs using the Local’s tar-
geted fund. In 2012 alone, the Local saw 
a return of nearly $6 for every $1 spent 
by the fund. 
By 2015, Local No. 704 had emerged 
into a period of success carrying them 
easily to their 100th year anniversary 
in 2021. In these 6 years, members of 
the Local had a hand in many major 
projects in the area, including the con-
struction of a new Amazon facility and 
the renovation of the historic David 
Whitney Building in Detroit. The open-
ing of a new state-of-the-art training 
center 
and 
headquarters 
for 
the 
sprinklerfitters of Local No. 704 helped 
close out the decade. 
U.A. Sprinklerfitters Local No. 704 
has weathered many obstacles but has 
remained strong and enters their 101st 
year well positioned for continued suc-
cess. I ask all of my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing their longevity, their 
skilled 
membership, 
and 
the 
im-
mensely positive impact they have 
made on the communities of southeast 
Michigan.∑

THE 
GOALS

IDEALS 
OF 
‘‘NATIONAL 
HIGH 
SCHOOL SENIORS VOTER REG-
ISTRATION DAY’’ 
Mr. CASSIDY (for himself and Mr. 
KING) submitted the following resolu-
tion; whom was referred to the Com-
mittee on Rul and Administration: 
S. RES. 606 
Whereas in order for the Federal Govern-
ment to remain of the people, by the people, 
and for the people, individuals must take ad-
vantage of their right to vote; 
Whereas the right to vote is one of the 
most important rights of a citizen, and every 
effort should be made to promote voter reg-
istration at school so that students may 
begin participating in the foundation of the 
representative democracy of the United 
States; 
Whereas the legislature of Louisiana voted 
in 2002 to annually recognize the first Tues-
day in May as Louisiana High School Seniors 
Voter Registration Day; and 
Whereas the purpose of National High 
School Seniors Voter Registration Day is to 
allow students to register to vote at school 
to encourage their participation in making 
democracy work: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the first Tuesday in May as 
‘‘National High School Seniors Voter Reg-
istration Day’’; and 
(2) encourages school districts to— 
(A) register high school seniors of voting 
age on the first Tuesday in May; and 
(B) encourage students to make a lifelong 
commitment to civic participation in all 
areas of society by educating them on the 
importance of voting.

‘‘CHILDREN’S 
MENTAL 
HEALTH 
AWARENESS WEEK’’ AND MAY 5, 
2022, AS ‘‘CHILDREN’S MENTAL 
HEALTH AWARENESS DAY’’ 
Mr. KING (for himself and Mr. COR-
NYN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 607 
Whereas children in the United States were 
already experiencing a public health crisis of 
mental and behavioral health before the ad-
ditional challenges of the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas a 2013 report from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention estimated 
that mental disorders affect between 13 and 
20 percent of children each year and cost 
$247,000,000,000 annually; 
Whereas the National Institute of Mental 
Health estimates that nearly 1⁄2 of adoles-
cents (49.5 percent of the population aged 13 
to 18) will experience a mental disorder; 
Whereas, in 2019, according to the Census 
Bureau, over 11 percent of children aged 3 to 
17 received treatment or counseling from a 
mental health professional; 
Whereas suicide is the third leading cause 
of death for youth aged 10 to 24, and 90 per-
cent of youth suicide deaths involve an un-
derlying mental illness; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
increased isolation and collective trauma 
has led to an increase in demand for mental 
health services for children; 
Whereas, compared with 2019, the propor-
tion of visits of children to emergency rooms 
for concerns relating to mental health in-
creased between approximately 24 and 31 per-
cent; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has laid 
bare the inequities in the mental health de-
livery system for all populations in the 
United States, specifically impacting chil-
dren and adults who have been exposed to ad-
verse childhood experiences; and 
Whereas the stigma surrounding mental 
and behavioral health persists, and acknowl-
edging this public health crisis and creating 
awareness as early as possible is as impor-
tant as ever: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of con-
necting children with appropriate mental 
and behavioral health services and supports; 
(2) seeks to create awareness for the addi-
tional challenges children and their families 
have faced during the COVID–19 pandemic 
due to isolation from family and peers, bar-
riers to services, and exposure to traumas; 
(3) supports programs and services aimed 
at expanding access to care, building resil-
iency, and addressing trauma; and 
(4) shows appreciation and gratitude for 
family members, friends, educators, mental 
and behavioral health service providers, and 
others in their support for the mental health 
and well-being of children.

S2248 
May 2, 2022 
VAN
HOLLEN, and Mr. BLUMENTHAL) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources: 
S. RES. 608 
Whereas the war in Ukraine has once again 
highlighted that the dependence of the 
United States and our allies on fossil fuels 
threatens the national security of the United 
States and our allies; 
Whereas according to Pulitzer Prize-win-
ning author Daniel Yergin, clean energy first 
emerged in the 1970s for energy security pur-
poses; 
Whereas authoritarian regimes across the 
world are using fossil fuel revenue to support 
their regimes and to undermine freedom; 
Whereas, according to Dr. Jeff Colgan, 
countries that rely on oil and gas revenue 
are more likely to instigate military con-
flict; 
Whereas the Russian Federation’s Ministry 
of Finance has reported that 40 percent of 
the Russian Federation’s budget is derived 
from oil and gas production; 
Whereas Americans are suffering from high 
gasoline and energy prices that, according to 
the 
Energy 
Information 
Administration, 
have been exacerbated 
by 
the 
war 
in 
Ukraine; 
Whereas oil and gas companies are profit-
eering off of Russia’s war in Ukraine by in-
flating gas prices at the expense of their con-
sumers; 
Whereas oil and gas companies were re-
porting record profits even before raising 
gasoline prices in the wake of the war in 
Ukraine; 
Whereas the Energy Information Adminis-
tration has reported that gasoline prices 
have remained high even after the price of 
oil has dropped; 
Whereas the biggest oil and gas companies 
have indicated that much of their record 
profits will be diverted to executives and 
shareholders; 
Whereas the Department of Defense has 
found that increasing temperatures, chang-
ing precipitation patterns, and more fre-
quent, intense, and unpredictable extreme 
weather conditions caused by climate change 
are exacerbating existing risks and creating 
new security challenges for United States’ 
interests; and 
Whereas energy efficiency and renewable 
energy from domestic manufacturers can 
come online more quickly and reliably than 
oil and gas production, which will ensure 
United States energy independence and help 
us maintain a safe and healthy climate: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) Congress and the Biden Administration 
must— 
(A) stop price gouging and excessive price 
increases by oil and gas companies; and 
(B) help consumers and small businesses 
that are being harmed by rising energy 
prices; and 
(2) the United States must transition to a 
clean energy economy as quickly as possible 
to protect our national security.

37—DECLARING 
A 
STATE 
OF 
EMERGENCY 
DUE 
TO 
THE 
RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE, 
IN 
ORDER 
TO 
ESTABLISH 
A 
WAIVER OF THE MINIMUM TON-
NAGE REQUIREMENTS OF SEC-
TION 55305 OF TITLE 46, UNITED 
STATES CODE 
Ms. ERNST submitted the following 
concurrent resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation: 
S. CON. RES. 37 
Whereas, in March and April 2014, the Rus-
sian military invaded and annexed the 
Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, and the Rus-
sian Federation took action to establish pro- 
Russian separatist states in the Donbas re-
gion of Ukraine; 
Whereas, the Russian Federation has failed 
to follow the cease-fire agreements estab-
lished by the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 accords, 
and conflict has been present in Ukraine 
since such invasion and annexation; 
Whereas, throughout 2021, Russia amassed 
troops, weapon systems, and hardware on the 
border of Russia and Ukraine; 
Whereas, on December 17, 2021, the Russian 
Federation presented the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (referred to in this pre-
amble as ‘‘NATO’’) with a list of security de-
mands, including that NATO would never 
allow Ukraine, or other former Soviet states, 
into the alliance; 
Whereas such demands are non-starters for 
NATO and its ‘‘open door policy’’, which 
dates to the alliance’s founding and gives no 
third party a say in such deliberations, and 
such demands were only offered as a jus-
tification for a Russian invasion; 
Whereas, on February 21, 2022, President 
Vladimir Putin officially recognized the re-
gions of Donetsk and Luhansk as inde-
pendent states despite international con-
sensus that those regions remain part of the 
sovereign territory of Ukraine; 
Whereas, on February 22, 2022, President 
Putin ordered Russian troops to enter 
Donetsk and Luhansk on a ‘‘peacekeeping 
mission’’ while setting the stage for a larger 
invasion; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, President 
Putin ordered Russian forces to conduct a 
full-scale invasion, moving beyond the re-
gions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and initi-
ating attacks throughout broader Ukrainian 
territory; 
Whereas Russian forces continue to dev-
astate Ukraine’s hospitals, schools, homes, 
and other civilian infrastructure, and threat-
en nuclear power plants with heavy artillery, 
multi-launch rocket systems, and munitions 
systems, with no regard for civilian casual-
ties; 
Whereas, an October 19, 2017, Government 
Accountability Office Report stated that a 
‘‘2015 analysis of agency data found that the 
application of CPFA requirements increased 
United States Agency for International De-
velopment’s and United States Department 
of Agriculture’s costs for shipping food aid 
by about 23 percent, or $107 million, com-
pared with the estimated shipping costs 
without application of CPFA requirements, 
from April 2011 through fiscal year 2014.’’; 
Whereas, in a United States Agency for 
International Development fact sheet titled: 
‘‘Food Aid Reform: Behind the Numbers’’, 
the United States Agency for International 
Development stated that eliminating the 
mandatory cargo preference reimbursements 
will reduce the deficit by an estimated 
$50,000,000 per year; 
Whereas, in March 2020, the American En-
terprise Institute published a report titled 
‘‘The Cost of Cargo Preferences for Inter-
national Food Aid Programs’’, which— 
(1) found ‘‘that removing cargo preference 
requirements would allow for between $36 
and $64 million of already appropriated funds 
to go to feeding the hungry and would ben-
efit U.S. soft power globally’’; 
(2) stated that ‘‘Owners of U.S.-flagged ves-
sels do not just charge higher freight rates 
for emergency aid shipments. They also use 
older, slower, and less efficient ships that 
take more time to complete their journeys, 
adding significantly to delays in the delivery 
of urgently needed resources to populations 
at risk of malnutrition.’’; and 
(3) concluded that ‘‘cargo preference for 
food 
aid 
imposes 
substantial 
costs 
of 
USAID’s Title II program budget. . . The im-
pacts are substantial, reducing the funds 
available for additional food aid programs by 
$52.83 million a year.’’; 
Whereas, in a March 25, 2022 information 
note titled ‘‘The importance of Ukraine and 
the Russian Federation for global agricul-
tural markets and the risks associated with 
the current conflict’’, the Food and Agri-
culture Organization (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘FAO’’) of the United Nations 
stated that— 
(1) the invasion of Ukraine could raise food 
prices ‘‘by 8 to 22 percent above their already 
elevated baseline levels’’; 
(2) ‘‘current indications are that, as a re-
sult of the conflict, between 20 and 30 per-
cent of areas sown to winter crops in 
Ukraine will remain unharvested during the 
2022/23 season, with the yields of these crops 
also likely to be adversely affected’’; and 
(3) ‘‘FAO’s simulations suggest that under 
such a scenario, the global number of under-
nourished people could increase by 8 to 13 
million people in 2022/23, with the most pro-
nounced increases taking place in Asia-Pa-
cific, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, and 
the Near East and North Africa.’’; 
Whereas, on April 8, 2022, the Associated 
Press published that ‘‘The U.N. Food and Ag-
riculture Organization said its Food Price 
Index, which tracks monthly changes in 
international prices for a basket of commod-
ities, averaged 159.3 points last month, up 
12.6% from February’’, and that ‘‘As it is, the 
February index was the highest level since 
its inception in 1990.’’; 
Whereas, on April 27, 2022, the United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment said in a press release that ‘‘The world 
is suffering from historic levels of global 
food insecurity, which is being exacerbated 
by the impact Russia’s war on Ukraine is 
having on global food supplies. Available es-
timates suggest that an additional 40 million 
people could be pushed into poverty and food 
insecurity as a result of Russia’s aggres-
sion.’’; 
Whereas, on April 27, 2022, the Adminis-
trator of the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development, Samantha Power, 
said that ‘‘In Ukraine, which provides 10 per-
cent of the world’s wheat, farmers are strug-
gling to plant and harvest their crops for 
fear of shelling and Russian landmines, and 
their path to exporting these vital commod-
ities is severely restricted by Russia’s inva-
sion, which caused the closure of Ukraine’s 
ports.’’; and 
Whereas, on April 27, 2022, Secretary of Ag-
riculture Tom Vilsack, said that ‘‘Russia’s 
unprovoked war on Ukraine, a fellow major 
agricultural export country, is driving food 
and energy costs higher for people around 
the world.’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That— 
(1) a state of emergency exists due to the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine; 
(2) such state of emergency justifies a 
waiver of the minimum tonnage require-
ments that apply to cargoes procured, fur-
nished, or financed by the United States 
Government, in accordance with section 
55305(c) of title 46, United States Code; and 
(3) the heads of the appropriate agencies 
shall be notified of such waiver.
