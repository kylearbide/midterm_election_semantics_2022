DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy and omnipresent God, You have 
promised that blessed are the merciful, 
for they shall receive mercy. Lord, we 
ask that though time and again we 
have failed to be merciful to our fellow 
humans, grant us Your mercy that we 
would be moved to tolerate, to respect, 
and to accept those whom we have 
wronged. 
Blessed are the pure in heart, You as-
sure, for they shall see You. Lord, 
though day after day we are too often 
indifferent witnesses to the atrocities 
in Ukraine, Iran, and around the globe, 
we pray that You would allow us to see 
You in the stranger and minister to 
them in their distress. Purify us and 
call us to defend the goodness You de-
sire in our world. 
Blessed are those who are persecuted 
for righteousness’ sake, for You have 
established for them Your own king-
dom. Lord, we pray Your protection for 
those in Iran who are not only per-
secuted, but like Masha Amini and the 
martyred Sharif University students, 
have sacrificed their lives for basic 
freedoms, preservation of human dig-
nity, and protection against violence 
and cruelty. Establish for all those who 
endure the vitriol of hatred the protec-
tion of Your sovereignty. 
We pray Your blessings on the pure 
of heart, the persecuted and reviled, 
and dare ask that the reward for their 
suffering would not be confined to 
heaven but may the peace and security 
of Your kingdom be granted to those 
who contend with the enemies of 
human flourishing and stand against 
the adversaries of human life. 
Sure of the protection of Your name, 
we pray. 
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H8376 
October 4, 2022 
printing in the Congressional Record a revi-
sion to the aggregates and allocations set 
forth in the Statement of Aggregates, Allo-
cations, and Other Budgetary Levels for Fis-
cal Year 2023 published in the Congressional 
Record on June 21, 2022, as revised. 
This adjustment responds to House consid-
eration of the bill, Continuing Appropria-
tions and Ukraine Supplemental Appropria-
tions Act, 2023 (Senate Amendment to H.R. 
6833), as provided for consideration in the 
House pursuant to H. Res. 1404 (117th Con-
gress). This adjustment is allowable under 
sections 1 and 2 of H. Res. 1151 (117th Con-
gress). It shall apply while that legislation is 
under consideration and take effect upon the 
enactment of that legislation. 
Accordingly, I am revising the aggregate 
spending level for fiscal years 2023 and the 
allocations for the House Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Veterans Affairs, and 
Ways and Means for fiscal year 2023 and fis-
cal years 2023–2032. For purposes of enforcing 
titles III and IV of the CBA and other budg-
etary enforcement provisions, the revised ag-
gregates and allocation are to be considered 
as aggregates and allocations included in the 
budget resolution, pursuant to the State-
ment published in the Congressional Record 
on June 21, 2022, as revised. 
Questions may be directed to Jennifer 
Wheelock or Kellie Larkin of the Budget 
Committee staff. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chairman.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
WILLIAM 
EMMONS AND HIS SERVICE TO 
THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE 
JUDICIARY 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise, along 
with Representative STEVE COHEN, Chair of 
the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil 
Rights, and Civil Liberties, to thank William 
Emmons for his service to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Will received his bachelor’s degree from 
The College of William and Mary and began 
his career in public policy as a Legislative In-
tern for Representative SUZANNE BONAMICI. 
Will first joined the Judiciary Committee as an 
intern in 2018 and he returned in 2019 as Pro-
fessional Staff Member for the Subcommittee 
on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Lib-
erties. 
Will’s work was essential to the success of 
much of the Constitution subcommittee’s ac-
tivities, including its 13 hearings on voting 
rights, two field hearings where he handled al-
most all of the logistical matters regarding 
transporting equipment and setting up hearing 
locations, and a number of other high-profile 
hearings like the one marking the 100th anni-
versary of the Tulsa race riots. 
Will assisted considerably with respect to 
helping various counsels involved in the first 
impeachment of Donald Trump and he also 
contributed substantive work product on im-
portant and politically sensitive matters, most 
notably with respect to researching the back-
ground on our hearing on Congressional au-
thority over member conduct and discipline. 
Through it all, in demanding and stressful 
situations, he proved to be a smart, dedicated 
staffer who worked very hard on many critical 
but often unseen tasks with conscientious-
ness, grace, and good humor. 
For nearly four years, I have been fortunate 
to count Will among my staff. I, and the Amer-
ican people, have greatly benefited from his 
passion for public policy, his dedication to 
service, and his commitment to excellence. No 
doubt he will be successful in his future en-
deavors and an asset to his future colleagues. 
While we are sad to see Will go and he will 
certainly be missed, we are happy that he will 
continue to serve the public interest in his new 
non-profit role in New York. 
We thank William Emmons for his service to 
the Committee and wish him the best of luck 
with this new chapter. 
SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
75TH ANNIVERSARY OF 4–H CAMP 
PALMER 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and celebrate the 75th anniversary 
of 4–H Camp Palmer. Camp Palmer has a re-
markable history within Northwest Ohio. Over 
the last 75 years, Camp Palmer has been 
committed to its mission of engaging with 
youth and adults to build life skills in a com-
munity living environment. Camp Palmer has 
been an extension of Ohio 4–H and has pro-
vided an opportunity for tens of thousands of 
Ohio’s youth to develop the skills to help them 
succeed. 
Located in Fayette, Ohio, 4–H Camp Palmer 
was founded in 1946, by 4–H leadership in 
seven Northwest Ohio counties, Defiance, Ful-
ton, Henry, Lucas, Paulding, Van Wert, and 
Williams. Each 4–H program shared in the 
purchase of the land and development of the 
camp. On July 20, 1947, the camp was offi-
cially dedicated and named after W.H. Palmer, 
the state 4–H leader from 1916 to 1951. The 
first building was the dining hall which was 
built out of split-logs due to the lumber short-
age after World War II. 
The next three decades saw significant ex-
pansion for Camp Palmer. In the 1950s, new 
buildings, cabins, and a swimming pool were 
added to improve the time campers spent 
while attending camp. Allen, Putnam, and 
Auglaize counties joined the corporation and 
began sending their 4–H members to camp 
there. The camp added more land in the 
1960s, totaling 149 acres. Toilets and warm 
showers were installed for the campers who 
originally had to use a bucket and wash basin. 
In 1973, Wood County became the eleventh 
member and final member to join the corpora-
tion. 
In the 1990s, Camp Palmer received ac-
creditation by the American Camp Association 
and began to develop a close relationship with 
The Ohio State University. The board hired an 
extension agent/executive director to manage 
the overall responsibilities and maintenance of 
the camp. Camp Palmer has continued to 
grow, adding new buildings, cabins, and activ-
ity areas to better serve campers. Although 
the COVID–19 pandemic kept campers away 
in 2020, Camp Palmer campers were still able 
to stay connected through their innovated 
camp-in-a-box and Facebook Live videos. 
Loyal and public support allowed campers to 
flood back to Camp Palmer in 2021, while still 
maintaining health safety. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to 4–H Camp 
Palmer and its staff, past and present, on this 
remarkable occasion. By celebrating the 75th 
anniversary, Ohio residents recognize the con-
tribution of Camp Palmer to our region and the 
Northwest Ohio 4–H community. Congratula-
tions to Camp Palmer on this significant mile-
stone.

CONGRATULATING MR. BARTLEY 
P. 
DURST 
FOR 
EARNING 
THE 
LABORATORY DIRECTOR OF THE 
YEAR AWARD 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, it is my privi-
lege to congratulate Mr. Bartley P. Durst for 
earning the Laboratory Director of the Year 
Award from the Federal Labs Consortium. 
Throughout a long and distinguished career, 
Mr. Durst has dedicated himself to the service 
of his fellow citizen. I rise today to recognize 
him as a community, state, and national lead-
er whose example will continue to motivate 
and encourage individuals who share the 
same passion of making a better and safer 
place for their neighbors, statesmen, and 
countrymen. 
In his five years as director of the 
Geotechnical 
and 
Structures 
Laboratory 
(GSL), Mr. Durst has led the way for the de-
velopment of technologies that emphasize 
structural resilience. GSL continues to take on 
some of the greatest civil and military engi-
neering challenges around the world, in which 
Mr. Durst has successfully integrated his dec-
ades of experience and personal knowledge. 
The Modular Protective System, which em-
ploys technological advancements to safe-
guard American servicemembers overseas 
and citizens at home, is the clearest illustra-
tion of Mr. Durst’s character and dedication. 
The MPS technology has led to a number of 
significant advancements that protect Amer-
ican troops and private citizens from weapons, 
projectiles, and explosions. These advance-
ments have also been made possible by 
strong federal and private partnerships with 
the U.S. Department of State, often cham-
pioned by Mr. Durst himself. 
It is my honor to recognize Mr. Bartley P. 
Durst for the many contributions he has made 
to create a brighter future for our state and na-
tion, and I ask my colleagues in the House to 
join me in thanking Mr. Durst for his service 
and commitment to Mississippi and to the 
United States of America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1020 
October 4, 2022 
celebrate his impressive career fighting for 
fairness and equity in the criminal justice sys-
tem. 
Mr. Stevenson was born in the town of Mil-
ton, a rural community in southern Delaware. 
It was in the First State and at the Prospect 
African Methodist Episcopal Church where Mr. 
Stevenson started to nurture his belief in re-
demption that ‘‘each person in our society is 
more than the worst thing they’ve ever done.’’ 
Raised by a strong Sussex County family, Mr. 
Stevenson began to show the leadership and 
passion for public service that would propel 
him in life. At Cape Henlopen High School, he 
excelled academically and served as the stu-
dent body president. He won several public 
speaking contests, demonstrating rhetorical 
prowess that would soon lead him to argue 
landmark cases before the U.S. Supreme 
Court. Mr. Stevenson would go on to earn a 
J.D. and M.P.P. from Harvard University and 
the position of Professor of Law at the New 
York University School of Law. 
In 1989, Mr. Stevenson founded the Equal 
Justice Initiative (EJI), a non-profit based in 
Montgomery, Alabama, that provides legal 
representation to wrongly convicted prisoners, 
especially Alabama prisoners on death row. 
One of EJI’s first clients was Walter McMillian, 
a Black man convicted and sentenced to 
death for the murder of a young white woman. 
Due to Mr. Stevenson’s systematic dismantling 
of the prosecution’s case, the Alabama Court 
of Criminal Appeals ruled that Mr. McMillian’s 
conviction was unconstitutional. The State of 
Alabama finally dropped charges after mount-
ing evidence proved Mr. McMillian’s inno-
cence. On March 3, 1993, Mr. McMillian was 
released from death row and walked out of a 
courtroom a free man. At the time, Mr. 
McMillian was one of the first to be exoner-
ated from death row since the end of the civil 
rights movement. Since Mr. McMillian was ex-
onerated, Mr. Stevenson and EJI prevented 
more than 130 people from receiving the 
death penalty. 
Mr. Stevenson personally argued several 
cases before the Supreme Court and won 
major landmark decisions reshaping American 
jurisprudence. In the 2012 case, Miller v Ala-
bama, Mr. Stevenson successfully argued that 
the imposition of a mandatory life-sentence- 
without-parole for a juvenile violates the 8th 
Amendment prohibition against cruel and un-
usual punishment. In the 2019 case, Madison 
v. Alabama, Mr. Stevenson successfully se-
cured a ruling that would protect prisoners 
who suffer from dementia from execution. 
These cases before the Supreme Court dem-
onstrate Mr. Stevenson’s commitment to eq-
uity in the criminal justice system and prove 
that Mr. Stevenson is one of America’s best 
public interest attorneys. 
Yet the good works of Mr. Stevenson were 
not confined to his successes in the court-
room. In 2018, Mr. Stevenson and EJI opened 
two new museums in Montgomery to chronicle 
the legacy of slavery and racial segregation. 
The Legacy Museum chronicled the post-slav-
ery 
evolution 
of 
racial 
violence 
in 
sharecropping, Jim Crow, and mass incarcer-
ation. The National Memorial for Peace and 
Justice records the names of 4,400 victims of 
lynchings from 1877 through 1950. Through 
EJI, he launched major efforts to address the 
legacy of slavery in America. EJI has pub-
lished several studies on racial violence and 
inequities in the law and state constitutions, in-
cluding the highly influential Lynching in Amer-
ica: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror. 
He also brought public attention to the racial 
injustices of the U.S. legal system as the au-
thor of the bestselling 2015 memoir Just 
Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption and 
adapted into the 2019 film, Just Mercy. Both 
the memoir and film received significant 
awards and nominations, including NAACP 
Image Awards, the Andrew Carnegie Medal 
for Excellence in Nonfiction, and the nomina-
tion for Outstanding Performance by a Male 
Actor in a Supporting Role at the 2020 Screen 
Actors Guild Awards. 
On October 8, 2022, I will have the privilege 
to join the Town of Milton and the Milton Com-
munity Foundation to honor the selfless dedi-
cation of Mr. Stevenson. Our country is so 
blessed to have him as a steward of justice. 
As he has so eloquently said—we all have a 
responsibility to create a just society. How for-
tunate we are to have Bryan Stevenson as our 
leader of that movement.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
DAN 
VAN 
BOXTEL RECEIVING THE PRIZE 
FOR TEACHING EXCELLENCE 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in recognition of Mr. Dan Van Boxtel for 
winning the Harbor Freight Tools for Schools 
Prize for Teaching Excellence award. 
Mr. Van Boxtel, an automotive technology 
teacher 
at 
Kaukauna 
High 
School 
in 
Kaukauna, Wisconsin, has been recognized 
for his excellence in teaching by receiving the 
award and a $50,000 prize. The Harbor 
Freight Tools for Schools Prize for Teaching 
Excellence award was created to recognize 
high school trades teachers throughout the 
United States for their knowledge and excel-
lence in education. Since 2017, the program 
has awarded more than 100 public high 
school teachers and their schools with the re-
sources to support and expand skilled trades 
education. By winning this award, it is evident 
that Mr. Van Boxtel has dedicated his time to 
ensuring our future generations have the skills 
needed to be successful and contribute to 
their communities. I commend Mr. Van Boxtel 
for his expertise in automotive technology and 
his unwavering commitment to the students of 
Kaukauna High School. 
The 2022 Harbor Freight Tools for Schools 
Prize for Teaching Excellence award received 
over 750 applications from all 50 states. The 
process of receiving the award included three 
rounds of judging, responses to questions, 
and a series of video learning modules de-
signed to draw from a teacher’s personal ex-
perience in achieving excellence in the class-
room. I applaud Mr. Van Boxtel for highlighting 
the importance and dignity of the skilled trades 
that will lead his students to numerous oppor-
tunities in the workforce and beyond. 
In Mr. Van Boxtel’s career at Kaukauna he 
has consistently provided students with the 
highest quality education in skilled trades. In 
his nearly two decades of service to Kaukauna 
he has truly left a lasting impact on the com-
munity. Through his critical automotive tech-
nology classes, he has generated career 
ready students prepared to enter a skilled 
trade shortly after graduation. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Mr. Van Boxtel for receiving the 
Harbor Freight Tools for Schools Prize for 
Teaching Excellence award. Mr. Van Boxtel 
has been a wonderful advocate for the trades 
and is a true credit to Kaukauna High School 
and Northeast Wisconsin.

HONORING SEPTEMBER 2022 AS 
NATIONAL RICE MONTH 
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of National Rice Month, estab-
lished by an act of Congress and signed into 
law by President Bush in 1989. Each Sep-
tember during the rice harvest season, we cel-
ebrate this important industry which is near 
and dear to me. 
I have the distinct privilege to represent the 
number one rice-producing district in the num-
ber one producing rice state in the United 
States. Rice farmers in Arkansas contribute 
$2.3 billion to my home state’s economic out-
put, supporting nearly 15,000 jobs up and 
down the supply chain. 
As a whole, the rice industry in the United 
States supports more than 125,000 jobs and 
generates $34 billion in economic impact. In 
fact, each rice farmer in the U.S. contributes 
$1 million to his or her local economy. 
To expand on rice’s impact beyond the 
economy, rice is the most popular grain glob-
ally and the primary dietary staple for more 
than half the world’s population. U.S. rice 
farmers and millers not only supply over 80 
percent of the rice we consume here at home, 
but they also ship it globally to more than 120 
countries. 
Rice farmers are also conservation minded, 
creating surrogate wetlands by flooding their 
fields during the winter that provide habitat to 
waterfowl and other wildlife. 
While I’m here to celebrate this important 
crop, I would be remiss to not mention that 
U.S. rice farmers are facing very difficult situa-
tions this year. In the southern rice-producing 
states, stagnant prices coupled with input 
costs are financially squeezing those farmers, 
while in California, drought has cut acreage in 
half. With rampant inflation, rice-dependent 
rural communities across the country are 
being adversely impacted by the ongoing re-
cession within the industry. This situation 
could result in devastating impacts on rice 
mills, elevators, trucking companies, and other 
businesses dependent on rice production, 
which once lost, will not return, further wors-
ening the economic stability in these commu-
nities. 
I believe that protecting our domestic rice in-
dustry is a priority and worthy endeavor, and 
that rice farmers need assistance to help them 
weather this storm, and I hope we can accom-
plish that.

50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF TULSA’S LITTLE LIGHT 
HOUSE 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to 
honor a very special anniversary in my com-
munity. 
In 1972, frustrated and overwhelmed by the 
lack of early childhood care options for their 
visually impaired daughters, Marcia Mitchell 
and Sheryl Poole decided to take a leap of 
faith and founded the Little Light House. In the 
50 years since, their organization has proved 
invaluable to countless families in the Tulsa 
area. 
Their mission is simple: serving the whole 
family by offering free, unparalleled services to 
help every child reach their unlimited potential 
by providing tools to assist them in commu-
nicating, walking, and learning, all while serv-
ing and glorifying God. 
The Little Light House has grown into a

RECOGNIZING TEMPE SISTER 
CITIES ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize and congratulate Tempe Sister Cit-
ies on its 50th anniversary. For five decades, 
this organization has empowered students and 
teachers through diplomacy, cultural aware-
ness, and education. It has enriched the lives 
of hundreds of local families who have hosted 
international exchange partners. 
Tempe Sister Cities serves as an enduring 
bridge that connects our people to 11 cities 
and countries throughout the world, including 
nine communities where high school students 
participate in exchanges with fellow students. 
Many of these exchanges create lasting life-
long friendships that transcend borders and 
transform how people in our community see 
and connect to the world. 
It is no secret that Tempe Sister Cities is 
one of the leading sister cities organizations in 
the world—distinguished by an unyielding 
commitment to make sure that each genera-
tion of Tempe students can learn and grow. 
So many lives have also been improved 
through its humanitarian programs, which 
range from medical support for individuals with 
disabilities to empowering women and children 
through resources that elevate their status. 
I want to recognize and thank every person 
who has dedicated their time and talents to 
make Tempe Sister Cities the tremendous 
change-maker that it is today. I join our com-
munity in celebration of 50 incredible years 
and wishes for many more.

HONORING RENEE LUCILLE 
SMOLEY 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to 
honor the life of my dear friend Renee Lucille 
Smoley. 
Renee Smoley grew up in Long Island, New 
York, graduating from Hunter College in 1943. 
Renee and her husband, Dr. Melvin Smoley, 
moved to my hometown of Weston, Florida in 
1989 where Renee became the longtime 
President of the Tequesta Homeowners Asso-
ciation. 
The City of Weston soon became Renee’s 
love and passion. She chaired the Peace 
Mound Park Committee to restore the archeo-
logical and historical significance to the city. 
She served on the Committee for Weston’s 
4th of July parade, and in 1996, Renee was 
tapped to serve as the co-chair of the Steering 
Committee to determine the feasibility of Wes-
ton incorporating and becoming its own city. 
For her contributions to the city, Renee was 
fondly referred as the Mother of Weston. She 
served on the Board of the Weston Music So-
ciety, was a charter member of AAUW Weston 
and Chair of AW Foundation and was in-
ducted to the Broward County Senior Hall of 
Fame. 
Of all her accomplishments in Weston 
Renee was most proud of her assistance to 
27 Kosovo refugees in 1999. She enlisted the 
help of Weston residents and businesses to 
provide them with housing and utilities for two 
years. 
Renee may have been tiny, but her broad 
shoulders carried me throughout my career in 
public service. I am grateful to Renee for her 
encouragement, wisdom, and love. She was 
not just the Mother of Weston but a mother to 
many in so many ways. 
My heart is with her family in mourning the 
loss of this kind, generous, and compas-
sionate soul. 
We were forever privileged to have shared 
this time with Renee. May her memory be a 
blessing.

HONORING 
THE 
MEMORY 
OF 
FORMER INDIANA CONGRESSMAN 
MARK SOUDER 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, Mark Souder, 
72, went to be with the Lord on Monday, Sep-
tember 26, 2022. He was born July 18, 1950 
in Fort Wayne, Ind. to Edward and Irma 
(Fahling) Souder. Mark grew up in Grabill, the 
area where his great-great-grandfather settled 
in 1848. He graduated from Leo HS (1968), 
Indiana University at Fort Wayne (1972), and 
the Graduate School of Business at Notre 
Dame (1974). He also received honorary doc-
torates from Tri-State University, the Indiana 
Institute of Technology and the University of 
St. Francis. Mark married Diane Zimmer of 
South Bend at the Bremen Apostolic Christian 
Church on July 28, 1974. Their first home was 
in Edina, Minn. where Mark had taken a job 
as the marketing manager for Gabberts Fur-
niture. In 1976, he returned to his family busi-
ness. Upon his return he was recruited by Dan 
Quayle and played a key role in his upset vic-
tory for Congress that year. In 1980, he as-
sisted Dan Coats in succeeding Quayle in 
Congress. After Mark’s father died in 1981 
and the furniture store closed in 1983, the 
Souder family moved to Washington D.C. for 
him to serve as the Republican Staff Director 
on the House Committee on Children, Youth 
and Families. In 1988, Souder switched to the 
Senate with Coats, serving as his legislative 
director until mid-1993 when he moved back 
to Indiana. Souder was hired by Thom Blake 
as Vice-President of Manufacturing of Our 
Country Home of Grabill. Emmanuel Commu-
nity Church has been their family church since 
1993. In the fall of 1994, Souder was elected 
to Congress. He was elected to seven more 
terms, becoming the second-longest serving 
congressman in history representing the Fort 
Wayne region. Souder focused heavily on 
fighting for the core industrial jobs of the re-
gion as well as local interests such as saving 
the Veteran’s Hospital and the Air Base. He 
served on three committees and seven sub-
committees each term. He was the point per-
son in the House on illegal narcotics, and co- 
founded the bi-partisan National Parks Cau-
cus. A major accomplishment was introducing 
and passing the National Lighthouse Preser-
vation Program, which had the National Park 
Service manage the transfer of hundreds of 
lighthouses from the Coast Guard to non-profit 
organizations to preserve access to the public. 
After Congress, he wrote regularly for Howey 
Politics Indiana, as well as in national books 
and publications on baseball and politics. His 
last book project was co-authoring Television 
in Fort Wayne, 1953–2018. Mark was pas-
sionate about his Lord, family, and country. He 
was a voracious reader of the Bible, history, 
politics, and sports. He adored his grand-
children and spent countless hours sharing ex-
periences with them while teaching valuable 
life lessons. For being such a strong and cou-
rageous leader, he had a very kind and gen-
erous heart. When he crossed the state line, 
every time he would sing the song, ‘‘Back 
Home Again in Indiana’’. Souder is survived 
by his wife and best friend of 48 years, Diane; 
and children, Brooke (Jeff) Lyons of Fort 
Wayne, Nathan (Sarah) Souder of Grand 
Junction, Colo., and Zach Souder of Albu-
querque, N.M.; as well as grandchildren, Grant 
Lyons, Reagan Lyons, Elias Souder and 
Ethan Souder.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1022 
October 4, 2022 
Kostas Bakoyannis for his long career of pub-
lic service to the citizens of the Hellenic Re-
public, notably, as the current Mayor of Ath-
ens. He previously served as the Governor of 
Central Greece, worked at the Greek Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, and held positions in the 
European Parliament in Brussels and the 
World Bank in Kosovo. He has served as the 
vice president of the Hellenic Agency for Local 
Development and Local Government. In his 
2019 mayoral campaign, he visited 129 neigh-
borhoods across Athens to become the cap-
ital’s youngest mayor with the widest margin 
of victory ever. His commitment to his con-
stituents is inspiring. 
Born in Athens on 16 March 1978 to New 
Democracy politicians Dora, who was the first 
woman to serve as Mayor of Athens, and 
Pavlas Bakoyanniss. He studied history and 
international relations at Brown University, 
graduated from Harvard University with a Mas-
ter of Public Administration, and received his 
Ph.D. from St Antony’s College, Oxford focus-
ing on disruptions, identity politics, and foreign 
policy in post-Cold War Greece. 
His love for his hometown of Karpenis in-
spired him to run for local office. His deep em-
pathy aided him in the first mayoral election, 
winning overwhelmingly. He served as the 
mayor of his hometown for three years. His 
positive impact on Karpenis were critical to his 
subsequent elections as regional governor and 
Mayor of Athens. His dedication to his citizens 
continues to this day in solving the pressing 
issues facing Athenians. 
As Mayor of Athens, the first thing he did 
early in the morning was go where the sanita-
tion workers gathered and started their rounds 
to show the importance and the value they 
have on the community. As he described it, 
‘‘Being in local government means having to 
work from the bottom up. At the end of the 
day, it’s about solving the problem, not talking 
about or to the problem.’’ 
Mayor Bakoyannis is striving to make Ath-
ens greener and more sustainable by closing 
parts of city centers for cars to reclaim public 
spaces, creating more parks for the residents. 
In doing this, he is also protecting the archae-
ological sites of Athens, which makes up 
some of the richest cultural heritage of the 
Greek people and indeed humanity. To reduce 
emissions in the city, he initiated a project to 
narrow the car lanes in one of the largest ave-
nues. He is dedicated to protecting Athenians 
from extreme heat and addressing the causes 
of climate change. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mayor Kostas Bakoyannis 
for his dedication and service to the great peo-
ple and especially the residents of Athens.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
GLORIA ‘‘GLO’’ DONNELLY 
HON. MIKE GARCIA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember the life and contribu-
tions of Gloria ‘‘Glo’’ Donnelly. Alongside her 
husband, Art, Glo was instrumental in the 
founding of the City of Santa Clarita in the 
1980s. After a lifetime of activism and commu-
nity involvement, Glo passed away this sum-
mer, but we continue to honor her legacy as 
one of Santa Clarita’s founders. 
A long-time resident of Santa Clarita before 
it was incorporated as a city, and a prominent 
Valencia realtor, Glo Donnelly played a crucial 
role in the formation of a city now home to 
more than 200,000 people. When the area 
that would become Santa Clarita grew from a 
farming community to a burgeoning suburb in 
the second half of the 20th century, Gloria 
was a leading voice among many like-minded 
community members who advocated for self- 
governance. Her and her husband Art, as co- 
chairs of the Santa Clarita Formation Com-
mittee, worked hard to win support for the for-
mation of the city by spreading awareness and 
raising funds to make the dream of Santa 
Clarita come true. When Santa Clarita won 
cityhood and the first city council was elected, 
Glo and Art worked hand-in-hand with the 
newly elected city leaders to ensure that 
Santa Clarita got off to a smooth start. 
Glo’s community leadership and involve-
ment did not end with Santa Clarita’s incorpo-
ration as a city. She was also the spokes-
woman for the Santa Clarita Valley Associa-
tion of Realtors, as well as the Chair of the 
Whittaker-Bermite Citizens Advisory Group. In 
both roles she prioritized giving community 
members a voice and always put the interests 
of Santa Clarita first. In her retirement from 
real estate, she remained active in Santa 
Clarita civics and the charitable community. 
Glo leaves behind a monumental legacy, 
and in many ways every single resident of 
Santa Clarita owes her a debt of gratitude for 
her tireless work to make Santa Clarita what 
it is today. We will continue to honor her serv-
ice as one of Santa Clarita’s founders, and we 
offer our condolences to her loved ones.

RECOGNIZING THE I’M JUST ME 
MOVEMENT’S MONTH OF OCTO-
BER AS I’M JUST ME BECAUSE 
MONTH 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the I’m Just Me Movement’s 
month of October as, I’m Just Me Because 
Month. 
Councilwoman Tina Stevens of Stephens 
City, Virginia began the I’m Just Me Move-
ment in 2013 to assist and support a college 
opportunity for a young man whose family was 
going through hard times. This movement im-
pacted their family and their community in un-
expected ways. As their outreach of inclusion 
grew, the movement became a nation-wide 
non-profit organization in 2015, with a mission 
of spreading positive acceptance of others and 
breaking down stereotypes. The organization 
works to encourage a celebration of the rich 
scopes of diversity contained within each indi-
vidual through acceptance and respect for one 
another. 
As the I’m Just Me Movement expanded its 
efforts to spread understanding of others and 
healing, the organization began an initiative 
known as Live Life Forward with a goal of 
breaking down stereotypes. 
Through the Live life forward initiative and 
related workshops, mentoring programs, and 
presentations at schools and businesses, the 
I’m Just Me Movement speaks out to advocate 
for inclusion and diversity and to raise aware-
ness about bullying and self-esteem issues in 
order to positively impact youth, families, and 
communities to guide, teach, train, and mentor 
them for a better future. 
The movement works to remind everyone 
that the concept of diversity encompasses ci-
vility, acceptance, mutual respect, and under-
standing that each individual is unique. 
Throughout the month of October, the I’m 
Just Me Because movement is focusing on 
promoting individual development, creating en-
vironments that break down stereotypes, and 
embracing individuality by recognizing the di-
versity around us and moving beyond simple 
tolerance to celebrating all of humanity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and our col-
leagues join me in recognizing the contribu-
tions of Ms. Tina Stevens and the I’m Just Me 
Movement has made in our community and 
the Nation.

CONGRATULATING RON HERRERA 
ON 
HIS 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
TEAMSTERS LOCAL 396 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate and thank Ron Her-
rera on his retirement earlier this summer from 
Teamsters Local 396 following nearly two dec-
ades leading his local union. 
Ron Herrera grew up in a working-class 
neighborhood in Wilmington, CA as part of a 
proud union family. For generations, the Her-
rera family has fought to improve the lives of 
workers. Ron’s grandfather was a veteran of 
the copper mines of Arizona, fighting the kinds 
of abuses and discrimination portrayed in the 
classic strike film Salt of the Earth. His father 
was a committed union man who worked the 
Ports of Long Beach, Los Angeles, and Oak-
land as a member of the Longshoremen’s 
Union. He instilled in Ron a profound respect 
for worker rights, social justice, and the invalu-
able role the labor movement plays in advanc-
ing the interests of working people. Ron Her-
rera began his own union career in 1975 as a 
package car driver for United Parcel Service. 
At the time, he was one of a handful of Latino 
drivers employed by UPS. He first distin-
guished himself as a leader in the labor move-
ment during the 1997 UPS Teamsters strike— 
the largest strike in U.S. history. 
Teamsters champion freight drivers and 
warehouse workers but organize for numerous 
occupations. Teamsters Local 396 represents 
UPS and Sanitation workers in Southern Cali-
fornia. The local union also serves members 
in other industries such as logistics, recycling, 
and feed delivery services. During his 24 
years as a rank-and-file Teamster member, 
Ron Herrera represented his fellow members 
as a United Parcel Service Shop Steward. In 
2000, he was hired as Business Representa-
tive for Teamsters Local 396 and in 2001 he 
became the President of his local union. In 
2003, he was elected to the Local 396 Prin-
cipal Officer position. 
Ron Herrera has led many successful orga-
nizing 
campaigns

groundbreaking legislation at the municipal 
and state levels. These campaigns have 
helped workers become Teamsters Union 
members, allowing them to provide a better- 
quality life for their families. 
In 2011, Ron Herrera was elected as a 
Trustee of the International Brotherhood of 
Teamsters Executive Board and he later 
served as Western Region Vice President 
from 2015 to 2022. 
On September 16, 2019, Ron Herrera was 
nominated and elected President of the LA 
County Federation. The LA County Federation 
is the second largest labor council in the 
United States with over 300 affiliated union 
and labor organizations that represents more 
than 800,000 members in the Los Angeles 
County area. 
In 2020, Ron Herrera cast his vote as one 
of California’s fifty-five Electoral College Elec-
tors for now President Joe Biden and Vice 
President Kamala Harris. 
Ron’s efforts over two decades included 
raising the standard of living for sanitation 
workers. He fought for higher wages, better 
benefits, and secured contract language to 
protect immigrant workers from unjust termi-
nation. He and Teamsters across the country 
mobilized to support Temporary Protective 
Status holders and immigrants. In 2019, the 
Teamsters supported my introduction of The 
Dream and Promise Act (H.R. 6), crucial legis-
lation that will ensure the future of Dreamers 
and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) hold-
ers. 
Ron, along with Teamsters Local 396, is 
part of the Don’t Waste LA coalition of com-
munity, environmental, and labor organizations 
working to eliminate dependance on landfills 
and dangerous jobs in Los Angeles. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in thanking and congratulating Ron 
Herrera for his many years of exemplary lead-
ership and outstanding service to labor unions. 
Let us wish him many happy years of retire-
ment.

RECOGNITION OF AMI SHAH AND 
HER SERVICE TO THE HOUSE JU-
DICIARY COMMITTEE 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise, along 
with Representative ZOE LOFGREN, Chair of 
the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizen-
ship, to thank Ami Shah for her service to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ami came to the Committee after spending 
six years as Associate Counsel with the 
United States Citizenship and Immigration 
Services and serving as a Peace Corps Vol-
unteer. Before starting her career in public 
service, Ami received her B.A. from the Uni-
versity of Virginia and her J.D. from The 
George Washington University Law School. 
Ami joined the Committee in 2019 as Coun-
sel to our Subcommittee on Immigration and 
Citizenship. For over three years she played 
an indispensable role in working to reform our 
Immigration system and conduct meaningful 
oversight of the executive branch’s policies. 
Ami’s service was defined by her commitment 
to advancing the rights of immigrants and their 
families, her tireless advocacy for refugees, 
and her efforts to help America fix its broken 
immigration system and live up to its aspira-
tional creed. 
Ami engaged in critical advocacy to push for 
evacuations of vulnerable Afghans and over-
sight to ensure their stable resettlement here 
in the United States. She was an instrumental 
part of the House’s work to provide benefits 
for Afghan parolees and relief for Afghan stu-
dents. Despite our polarized political climate, 
Ami helped pass several bills into law, includ-
ing the HOPE (Honoring Our Promises 
through Expedition) for Afghan SIVs Act of 
2021, and the America’s Children Act and the 
Virgin Islands Visa Waiver Act through the 
NDAA for Fiscal Year 2022. Ami was also 
heavily involved in the Committee markup of 
the American Families United Act and the 
House’s passage of five private immigration 
bills in 2022 and the Access to Counsel Act of 
2021. As part of the annual Refugee Consulta-
tion and the Committee’s oversight work, Ami 
pressed the executive branch to raise our ref-
ugee admissions goal and increase proc-
essing and helped achieve an extension of 
Temporary Protected Status for Cameroon. 
Throughout all of her work, Ami brought her 
commitment to compassion, justice and equity 
and her unyielding work ethic. Our Committee, 
Congress, and the American people greatly 
benefited from her service. 
While we will miss Ami greatly, we are glad 
she is not going far, and is continuing her ca-
reer in public service as Chief Immigration 
Counsel to Senator DURBIN and the Senate 
Judiciary Committee. 
We thank Ami for her years of service to the 
Committee and wish her the best of luck with 
this new chapter.

HONORING TRICIA NICESWANGER 
AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Trisha Niceswanger, a teacher 
and Speech & Debate coach at Atlantic High 
School, as our Iowan of the Week. 
Speech & Debate teams provide high 
school students with incredible skills that can 
be applied everywhere in the real world, like 
public speaking, speech writing, performance, 
and self-confidence. It also teaches students 
how to build perspective, prepare formal re-
marks, and think critically about how they por-
tray themselves and their message. These life 
skills and abilities have never been more cru-
cial than they are today, and it takes someone 
truly special to be able to successfully show 
our students what they are capable of. That is 
why, today, I am so proud to be honoring 
Trisha Niceswanger for her work and dedica-
tion as the Speech & Debate coach for Atlan-
tic High School. 
Trisha has been at Atlantic High School for 
8 years. She not only serves as the Speech 
& Debate coach, but she also serves Atlantic 
High School as a Spanish teacher. No matter 
the capacity she is working in, she is always 
finding ways to teach and inspire our future 
generations to realize their own potential. 
Trisha co-coaches the Speech & Debate 
team, with her primary focus being on coach-
ing the Individual and Large Group Speech 
teams. This year, during the Individual Speech 
season, 28 of Trisha’s students received Divi-
sion 1 ratings at the District Speech competi-
tion. This rating automatically advanced those 
students to the State Speech competition. Of 
those 28 students, 8 were freshmen. Ulti-
mately, this year Trisha coached 3 students, I 
freshman and 2 juniors, who were nominated 
for the All-State Speech competition taking

place on March 28th at the University of 
Northern Iowa. 
Trisha’s clear leadership in her role as the 
Speech & Debate coach has not only pro-
duced outstanding results, but she’s also nota-
ble because of the impact she makes on her 
students. Trisha participated in Speech & De-
bate when she was in high school, and it 
showed her that these competitions are much 
more than standing up and talking. She 
coaches her students through the performance 
of speech, and how every category within the 
competition caters to unique strengths we all 
have within us. Review or Spontaneous 
Speaking can be for students who thrive in an-
alytical or argumentative settings, while Poetry 
or Prose allows students to tap into illustra-
tions and emotions through words. Trisha 
helps guide these students to find the 
strengths they carry as people, and when stu-
dents realize these strengths, she sees the 
impact it has on every one of them. 
Trisha says the most fulfilling aspect of the 
work she does is seeing students try some-
thing new and come out of their shell. Speech 
& Debate can be a daunting activity for stu-
dents to try out. It puts the student in the spot-
light, especially for Individual Speech, where 
students perform solo. But as Trisha helps her 
students find their voice in an area that sparks 
their passion, she sees them gain more and 
more confidence in themselves as she coach-
es them through a particular piece. 
The work Trisha does is not just about per-
forming well at a competition. She genuinely 
cares about her students as people and wants 
to see them thrive after they graduate high 
school. Trisha teaches her students so much 
about themselves and the impact they can 
have on people using Speech & Debate. Her 
dedication to the students of her community is 
truly inspiring, and it is why I am honored to 
name Trisha Niceswanger as this week’s 
Iowan of the Week.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE ELK RAPIDS GOLF 
CLUB 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the 100th Anniversary of 
the Elk Rapids Golf Club. Nestled on the 
banks of the beautiful Elk Lake, the course 
has provided a century of Michiganders with 
an excellent venue to enjoy the game of golf. 
Designed and built by legendary architect 
Donald J. Ross from 1922 to 1923, Elk Rapids 
Golf Club opened for play on July 15, 1924. 
The course’s long history is reflected in one of 
its key attributes—its unique design. Like 
many of Ross’s courses, Elk Rapids was in-
spired by the small, local courses he learned 
to play on in his hometown of Dornoch, Scot-
land. Playing a round at Elk Rapids truly takes 
one back to the way the game was meant to 
be played. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
the Elk Rapids Golf Club for a century of busi-
ness. It should take immense pride in the 
great economic impact it has had on Antrim 
County and the indelible memory it has left on 
so many Michigan golfers. On behalf of Michi-
gan’s First District, I wish it all the best in its 
future endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
ELIZABETH SAWIN-BURKY 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of Elizabeth Sawin-Burky. 
Liz was born on October 24, 1942, in Mineral 
Wells, Texas, to the union of Reverend Dr. 
and Mrs. R.M. English. She was the second of 
nine children. 
Liz moved to Fort Worth after her father ac-
cepted a preaching appointment. She at-
tended Como High School and bravely served 
her country in the U.S. Air Force after gradua-
tion. 
Liz then went on to work as a senior sec-
retary in the Humanities division at Tarrant 
County College for over 25 years. She also 
served as the Sunday School superintendent 
and Youth Department leader in the Women’s 
Ministry and Vacation Bible School at West 
Mount Moriah, where she was a faithful mem-
ber and sat in the same row and seat at serv-
ices for many years. Liz had an incredible 
sense of humor that was always used well 
through her storytelling abilities and gatherings 
with family and friends. Liz is best remem-
bered as a pillar in her family, where she was 
a loving mother, sister, grandmother, aunt, 
and so much more. 
Liz is survived by her son and daughter-in- 
law, Terrence Michael Butler and Juli Lynn 
Butler, and her siblings, Doris Theresa ‘‘San 
Dei’’ English, Eva Carolyn English-Clay, Con-
stance Grace English Cash, Rubye DeiGratia 
‘‘Charlie’’ English-Carter and John Moses 
English; four grandchildren, eight great-grand-
children, a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, 
and friends. Liz was preceded in death by her 
daughter, Michelle Butler Thomas; her par-
ents, Rev. R.M. and Ressie English; and three 
siblings, Robert James English, Joseph Hart 
Davis English, and Mary LlaBetta English 
Sowels. May she Rest in Peace.

INTRODUCTION OF THE MARITIME 
FUEL TAX PARITY ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Maritime Fuel Tax Parity Act,’’ 
with Congressman JOHN H. RUTHERFORD (R– 
FL). 
Under current law, maritime diesel fuel for 
commercial shipping or ocean-going pas-
senger vessels is exempt from the federal fuel 
excise tax that supports the Highway Trust 
Fund. This same tax exemption applies to die-
sel fuel for other non-road vehicles such as 
train locomotives and off-highway vehicles like 
construction equipment or farm vehicles. Such 
ocean-going vessels are also exempt from the 
federal excise tax that supports the Inland Wa-
terways Trust Fund. 
Under current law, non-diesel fuels for 
ocean-going vessels and aircraft are also ex-
empt from federal excise taxes on fuel. How-
ever, non-diesel maritime fuels are only ex-
empt for ocean-going vessel engaged in com-
mercial fishing, foreign trade, or interstate 
commerce between the Atlantic and Pacific 
ports of the United States and its territories or 
possessions. For vessel operators with sched-
uled service between two Pacific ports or two 
Atlantic ports, the current tax treatment of non- 
diesel maritime fuels could disincentivize them 
from choosing cleaner alternative fuels. 
As the ranking member of Subcommittee on 
Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation from 
2013 to 2018, I strongly support vessel opera-
tors’ efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emis-
sions from ocean-going vessels. Many opera-
tors are working to retrofit their vessels to re-
duce emissions or investing in new vessels 
powered by alternative fuels. Congress must 
support these critical investments to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions from the maritime 
sector and minimize particulate pollution from 
vessels at our ports, which contribute to smog 
and is a major public health concern for com-
munities near the waterfront. 
Our ‘‘Maritime Fuel Tax Parity Act’’ would 
amend the Internal Revenue Code to ensure 
that alternative fuels are afforded the same tax 
exemption as maritime diesel, even when 
used for voyages within a single ocean. I am 
encouraged by the investments underway by 
many ferry operators, the cruise industry, and 
other vessel operators in transitioning to 
cleaner fuels, particularly hydrogen, biofuels, 
and renewable natural gas. Our legislation 
would provide tax parity with maritime diesel 
to incentivize continued investment by indus-
try. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all members 
of the House to join us in cosponsoring the bi-
partisan ‘‘Maritime Fuel Tax Parity Act.’’

RECOGNIZING TINA BUNETA 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize 
the 
accomplishments 
of 
Tina 
Buneta and congratulate her on receiving the 
Association of Public-Safety Communications 
Officials (APCO) International 2022 Director of 
the Year award for her life saving work as a 
9–1–1 professional with the Aurora Depart-
ment of Public Safety Communications. 
A life-long dedicated public servant, Tina 
applied to become a front line telecommuni-
cator for the Colorado State Patrol in 1999— 
not fully understanding what the career en-
tailed. She soon realized she excelled at solv-
ing problems and puzzles, creating order out 
of chaos, and most importantly—helping peo-
ple. 
Over her 23-year career in emergency com-
munications, Tina has gone from directly help-
ing people, to helping and molding the people 
who help people. She previously served as a 
Communications Training Officer, Communica-
tions Supervisor, and Regional Center Man-
ager for the Colorado State Patrol until 2019 
when she became Director of Aurora911. 
Under her leadership style, Tina aims to em-
power new leaders and develop new ideas 
and strategies to ensure Aurora911 is oper-
ating at its best.

October 4, 2022 
In recognition of her leadership and tireless 
dedication to service, Tina received the 2022 
Director of the Year Award from APCO. The 
nationwide award is given annually to a leader 
who exemplifies high levels of personal and 
professional conduct in the line of duty. I can-
not think of a leader more deserving of this 
award than Tina, who has dedicated her life to 
an instrumental career in public safety. 
I am honored to recognize Tina for her dedi-
cation and commitment to making our commu-
nity a better place to call home. I congratulate 
her for receiving the APCO International 2022 
Director of the Year Award, as well as an in-
credible career in emergency communications.

RECOGNITION OF INTERNATIONAL 
PLASMA AWARENESS WEEK 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of patients across the United States 
and worldwide who rely upon medicines made 
from donated plasma. October 3–7 is Inter-
national Plasma Awareness Week (IPAW), 
and this year, 2022 marks the 10th annual 
IPAW. The need for plasma donation remains 
ongoing coming out of the decline in donations 
seen during the COVID–19 pandemic and 
helps create lifesaving therapies to treat indi-
viduals living with rare diseases. This week, 
patients, plasma donors, and plasma collec-
tion centers will join together to observe IPAW 
via a range of events seeking to raise global 
awareness of the crucial need for plasma to 
create lifesaving therapies, recognize that 
plasma donors contribute greatly in saving and 
improving lives, and increase the under-
standing of the many rare diseases and plas-
ma protein therapies that help to treat them. 
Plasma-derived therapies and recombinant 
blood clotting factors, collectively known as 
plasma protein therapies, are unique biologic 
medicines that are either infused or injected to 
treat a variety of rare, life-threatening, chronic, 
and genetic diseases, including bleeding dis-
orders, hereditary angioedema, immune defi-
ciencies, pulmonary disorders, neurological 
disorders, and infectious diseases such as tet-
anus, hepatitis, and rabies. Hundreds of thou-
sands people in the U.S. who live with these 
rare diseases, and countless others facing 
trauma and emergency medical needs every 
day, rely on plasma protein therapies that are 
only available because of the commitment of 
dedicated plasma donors. 
Plasma protein therapies have significantly 
improved the quality of life, markedly improved 
patient outcomes, and extended the life ex-
pectancy of men, women, and children in 
every community across the country. Healthy, 
committed donors provide the plasma essen-
tial to manufacture these lifesaving therapies. 
There are now over 1,000 plasma collection 
centers in the U.S. that have demonstrated 
their commitment to plasma donor and patient 
safety and quality by earning International 
Quality Plasma Program (IQPP) certification. I 
ask that my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives join me and rise in commemora-
tion of International Plasma Awareness Week, 
honoring those committed donors and collec-
tion centers who make and collect needed and 
lifesaving contributions.

RECOGNIZING COOPER BURDEN 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Cooper Burden. 
Cooper joined Pac 7 Cub Scouts in 2016 
and immediately set his eyes on earning 
Scouting’s highest rank that of Eagle Scout. At 
first it was playing in the woods with friends 
that he enjoyed but as Cooper advanced to 
Webelos camping, fishing and BB guns be-
came more the attraction. Cooper earned 
countless service and volunteer hours over the 
years. Summer Camps at Camp Soule, 
Bourne and Sand Hill fostered friendships he 
will carry for a lifetime. As Cooper advanced 
to Arrow of Light and self-discipline leadership 
became a focus and a skill he embraced. This 
Leadership became evident in his schoolwork 
in Junior National Honor Society, in Scouting 
as he held leadership roles as Assistant Quar-
ter Master, Quarter Master, and Patrol Leader. 
During his time in Troop 77 Cooper set goals 
for himself that included earning over 70 indi-
vidual merit badges, spending over 120 nights 
Camping, completing BSA’s First ever Virtual 
Camp-in during COVID lockdown and fund-
raising to earn his way to each summer camp 
he has attended. Cooper identified and com-
pleted his Eagle project in March 2022. The 
project came about during a conversation with 
his lifelong Pastor. The project consisted of 
pressure washing, prepping, and painting the 
day school at the Burden family’s church; 
Good Shepard Lutheran Church located in 
Tampa, FL. Cooper organized over 25 volun-
teers, exceeded his fundraising goal, and 
completed the project days before his 14th 
birthday. Cooper did all this while maintaining 
academically all A’s and the occasional B 
through his entire Scouting journey Elemen-
tary, Middle and High School. Cooper also has 
been active in intramural flag football, spent 
the last 11 years as a Karate Student and vol-
unteer teaching the 3- to 6-year-old classes at 
Ingrams Okinawan Karate where he has stud-
ied Isshinryu karate and holds a 2nd Degree 
Black Belt. Cooper as a freshman at Mitchell 
High School is a member of the U.S. Navy 
JROTC, a member of the Wrestling Team. 
Cooper hopes to attend a Military Academy or 
State University, join the Armed Forces, and 
pursue a career in mechanical engineering fo-
cusing on automotive industries.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE HONOR-
ABLE JAMES J. FLORIO: LIFE 
AND LEGACY 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to my late friend and 
former governor, Jim Florio—a dedicated pub-
lic servant who cared deeply for those in New 
Jersey and the Nation. 
Governor James J. Florio was born in 
Brooklyn, New York on August 29, 1937. He 
was raised by his mother, a homemaker, and 
his father, an Italian American shipyard paint-
er. Before completing high school, James 
Florio enlisted in the United States Navy and 
served for three years before his discharge in 
1958. He continued to serve as a naval re-
servist for eighteen years, achieving the rank 
of Lieutenant Commander. Following his serv-
ice, Governor Florio earned his high school 
equivalency degree from the State of New Jer-
sey. He went on to complete an under-
graduate degree from Trenton State College 
before earning a J.D. from Rutgers University 
in 1967. Prior to being elected to the New Jer-
sey General Assembly in 1969, Governor 
Florio was the Assistant City Attorney for the 
City of Camden, New Jersey. He would serve 
in the General Assembly for four years, and in 
1974 was elected to the House of Representa-
tives for fifteen years before being elected 
Governor of New Jersey in 1989. 
Governor Florio was an environmentalist 
long before it was popular. In Congress, Gov-
ernor Florio was the prime sponsor of the 
Comprehensive 
Environmental 
Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act, known as the 
Superfund Act, which was one of the most re-
markable pieces of legislation which cleaned 
up hazardous sites across the country. It was 
an initiative that aimed to reduce the number 
of toxic dumping sites across the United 
States and especially in the State of New Jer-
sey. 
On January 16, 1990, Governor James 
Florio was inaugurated as the 49th Governor 
of New Jersey, becoming the first Italian 
American to hold the position. Governor Florio 
helped to craft legislation that led to the cre-
ation of the Pinelands National Reserve and 
signed the Clean Water Act, one of the strict-
est in the Nation at the time. He also oversaw 
legislation restricting semi-automatic assault 
weapons in the State of New Jersey and re-
ceived the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Cour-
age Award for his efforts in championing gun 
control. 
After his term as Governor, he was ap-
pointed as a Professor of Public Policy and 
Administration at the Edward J. Blaustein 
School at Rutgers University, and was also a 
founding 
partner 
of 
Florio, 
Perrucci, 
Steinhardt, Cappelli, Tipton & Taylor, LLC. In 
2002, he was appointed Chair of the New Jer-
sey Pinelands Commission by former Gov-
ernor James McGreevey, a role he proudly 
held for three years before serving as Chair-
man of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New 
York’s Board of Directors. 
Governor James J. Florio was the beloved 
husband of 42 years to Lucinda (Coleman) 
and loving father of Christopher, Gregory, 
Catherine (Pipas) as well as stepfather to 
Mark Rowe. He also was a brother, grand-
father of ten and great grandfather of two. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of myself, the 
State of New Jersey, and the Nation, we are 
grateful for his service to our state. We lost 
one of our greatest champions, and he will be 
missed by all who had the honor of knowing 
him. My deepest sympathies to his family and 
his loved ones.

SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO’S 150TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and celebrate the 150th anniversary 
of the University of Toledo (UT). The Univer-
sity of Toledo has a remarkable history within 
the City of Toledo and the surrounding region. 
Over the last one hundred and fifty years, UT 
has been committed to its mission of providing 
a world-class education to their students and 
preparing them to become part of a diverse 
community of leaders in the world. 
The University of Toledo was made possible 
in 1872, when Jesup Wakeman Scott donated 
160 acres of land as an endowment for a uni-
versity to train Toledo’s young people. Scott 
was a newspaper editor in Toledo who felt 
that the center of world commerce was mov-
ing west. He believed that the focus of that 
move would center on Toledo by 1900. On 
October 12, 1872, the Toledo University of 
Arts and Trades was incorporated. The origi-
nal 160 acres donated by Scott became 
known as the Scott Park Campus. 
Since UT’s inception, the University has 
grown into an exceptional university providing 
a multitude of degree and major options as 
well as research opportunities in wide range of 
studies. UT offers its 12,000 undergraduate 
students and 3,000 graduate students aca-
demic options in over 250 degree programs 
ranging from law and business to engineering 
and natural sciences. To provide a cutting- 
edge education for nursing and medical stu-
dents, the University merged with the Medical 
University of Ohio in 2006. This merger made 
the University of Toledo one of the few univer-
sities nationwide to offer degrees in medicine, 
law, engineering, business, nursing, phar-
macy, and education. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to the University 
of Toledo on this remarkable occasion. By 
celebrating the 150th anniversary, community 
members, staff, students, and alumni recog-
nize the contribution of the University to higher 
education and the development of their stu-
dents. Congratulations to the University of To-
ledo on this significant milestone.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
NORTHWEST 
RANKIN HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL 
TEAM’S 
6A 
STATE 
CHAMPION-
SHIP 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 4, 2022 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, it is my privi-
lege to recognize the Northwest Rankin High 
School baseball team players and coaches for 
their outstanding championship season. The 
Northwest Rankin Cougars displayed admi-
rable attributes including integrity, sportsman-
ship, and perseverance throughout a lengthy 
and successful season. I would like to honor 
this group of committed young men, coaches, 
and their families who worked diligently to 
bring the Mississippi 6A state championship to 
Rankin County, Mississippi. 
At Trustmark Park in Pearl, the third and 
final game of the 6A state championship se-
ries featured the Northwest Rankin Cougars 
defeating Desoto Central by a score of 3–2. 
This is Northwest Rankin’s second state base-
ball championship in program history. The 
Cougars won 34 games with only three losses 
this season. 
The resilience and leadership displayed by 
the players are characteristics of Northwest 
Rankin’s head coach, KK Aldridge, who was 
named the Priority One Bank/Mississippi 
Scoreboard Metro Jackson Coach of the Year 
last season. 
It is my honor to recognize the Northwest 
Rankin High School baseball team for inspir-
ing countless young men and citizens across 
our community, and I ask my colleagues in the 
House to join me in congratulating the North-
west Rankin Cougars for their dedication and 
commitment to excellence in our nation’s past 
time, the great sport of baseball.
