Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 2021 
No. 17 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O Lord, our God, how majestic is 
Your name in all the Earth. When we 
look at Your heavens, the work of Your 
fingers, the moon and the stars that 
You have established; what are human 
beings that You are mindful of them, 
mortals that You care for them? 
Standing before Your magnificence, 
we repent of our dependence on our 
own power and wisdom. Who are we, O 
Lord, but politicians and patriots, 
mere mortals attempting to manage 
the bounty of this Earth? And even so, 
despite our feeble efforts, our bouts of 
pride and prejudice, You yet charge us 
with dominion over Your handiwork, 
and entrust us with the governance of 
this Nation. 
In response to Your mercy on us, we 
pray that our deliberations would re-
flect Your mindfulness, that our deci-
sions would share Your eternal vision, 
and that our decrees would be worthy 
of Your faith in us. In all that we do, 
may we magnify Your name and de-
clare Your majesty over all the Earth. 
We offer ourselves to You and pray in 
the strength of Your holy name. 
Amen.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 28, 2021 
No. 17 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable JACKY 
ROSEN, a Senator from the State of Ne-
vada. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Lord, we look to You for refuge. You 
are master of ocean, Earth, and sky. 
Every good thing we have comes from 
You. Your wisdom is worth much more 
than silver or gold. Though troubles 
multiply in our Nation and world, You 
simply need to speak to bring order 
from chaos and harmony from discord. 
Lord, use our lawmakers and instruct 
them in Your precepts. Inspire them to 
live for Your glory. Use them to hasten 
the day when Your will will be done on 
Earth, even as it is done in Heaven. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE

indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, January 28, 2021. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, para-
graph 3, of the Standing Rules of the 
Senate, I hereby appoint the Honorable 
JACKY ROSEN, a Senator from the State 
of Nevada, to perform the duties of the 
Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Ms. ROSEN thereupon assumed the 
Chair as Acting President pro tempore. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-

f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
over the past week, the Senate has 
been confirming President Biden’s Cab-
inet nominees with significant co-
operation between both parties. Today, 
however, the Republican minority has 
forced the Senate to jump through a 
series of procedural hoops that will fur-
ther delay the confirmation of one of 
our country’s chief national security 
officials, the Secretary of Homeland 
Security. 
It has now been 8 days since Presi-
dent Biden was sworn into office, and 
as a result of an objection from one 
Member—just one Member from the 
Republican minority—it will be an-
other 4 days until we can complete the 
confirmation of Mr. Mayorkas to be 
our next Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity. What could have been the tidy 
work of a few hours on President 
Biden’s first day will drag on for a 
week and a half. Make no mistake 
about it—he will be confirmed. This 
dilatory action will not succeed, but it 
will prevent the Senate from doing 
other important business. 
It has become a point of pride for the 
Republican leadership to say that they 
are treating President Biden’s nomi-
nees more fairly than Mr. Trump’s, but 
I remind my colleagues that former 
President Trump had his first DHS 
Secretary, Secretary Kelly, confirmed 
on his Inauguration Day. 
There is a reason that there has been 
bipartisan cooperation in the past to 
confirm the Homeland Security Sec-
retary. Whatever our differences on 
policy, both parties have agreed that 
the prolonged delay of these nomina-
tions is no good—no good—for our na-
tional security. 
That is particularly the case right 
now. Our government recently suffered 
an unprecedented cyber attack. In the 
wake of January 6, the threat of vio-
lence and domestic terrorism remains 
a great concern. But because of the 
tactics of some Republican Members— 
particularly the junior Senator from 
Missouri—Mr. Mayorkas’s nomination 
is being needlessly stalled. 
My friends on the other side don’t 
have to agree with Mr. Mayorkas on 
the final points of every policy. I am 
sure they don’t share the exact views 
of every appointment to a Democratic 
President’s Cabinet. But that is not a 
sufficient reason to oppose a nomina-
tion, especially one as important as 
Homeland Security. 
You don’t have to take my word for 
it; listen to Michael Chertoff, Presi-
dent Bush’s former DHS Secretary. He 
said: 
If members of Congress want to contest 
elements of [Biden’s] proposal[s], they are 
free to do so. . . . But hostage taking is not 
an appropriate way to do this, particularly if 
a result of that is to put the lives of [the 
American people] in jeopardy. 
Chertoff went on to say that actions 
to thwart Mayorkas’s nomination were 
‘‘irresponsible 
and 
unconscionable.’’ 
‘‘Irresponsible and unconscionable’’—

that is President Bush’s former Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, not a 
Democrat. 
Well, the Senate is not going to tol-
erate this irresponsible and uncon-
scionable delay. Despite the tactics 
from the Republican side, the Senate 
will begin work on this crucial nomina-
tion today, and he will be confirmed. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
SCHUMER. 
Now 
on 
COVID, 
Madam President, quickly, this Cham-
ber must also consider additional relief 
for the American economy and the 
American people suffering from the 
prolonged effects of COVID–19. Con-
gress must pursue a bold and robust 
course of action to defeat the disease, 
recover our economy, and get our coun-
try back to normal. Again, our country 
requires bold and robust action. 
A trio of economic news items this 
week has underlined the glaring needs 
in the country. 
First, the Federal Reserve issued a 
sobering warning yesterday that the 
pace of economic recovery is weak-
ening, and as a result, they decided to 
leave interest rates low. 
Second, the unemployment report 
this morning reminded us that jobless 
claims are still extremely high—at or 
near 1 million per week. That is a lot 
larger than usual. 
Third and maybe most astoundingly, 
most striking, the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis this morning revealed that 
last year, the economy shrank by 3.5 
percent—the worst year for economic 
growth since World War II and the first 
time our economy has contracted since 
the great recession. 
Given these economic numbers, the 
need to act big and bold is urgent. 
Given the fact that the GDP sunk by 
3.5 percent last year, we need recovery 
and rescue quickly. Everywhere you 
look, alarm bells are ringing—mort-
gage deferrals are increasing, busi-
nesses are still closing, schools are 
closed in many States, restaurants and 
bars and travel are in crisis. 
Our 
new 
Secretary 
of 
Treasury, 
Janet Yellen, who was days ago con-
firmed with the support of 84 Members 
of this body and a large majority of our 
Republican colleagues, just told us 
that ‘‘with interest rates at historic 
lows, the smartest thing we can do is 
act big.’’ That is what Yellen said. 
‘‘[T]he smartest thing we can do is act 
big.’’ 
Given 
these 
numbers, 
given 
the 
weakening state of the economy, only 
big, bold action is called for. To cut 
things dramatically at a time when the 
economy needs a boost would be irre-
sponsible and hurt millions of people. 
We are in the midst of a once-in-a- 
century crisis. It requires a once-in-a- 
century effort to overcome it. The dan-
gers of undershooting our response are 
far greater than overshooting. We 
should learn the lesson from 2008 and 
2009, when Congress was too timid and 
constrained in its response to the glob-
al financial crisis and it took years— 
years—for the economy to get out of 
recession. We must not repeat that 
mistake today. 
So the Senate, as early as next week, 
will begin the process of considering a 
very strong COVID-relief bill. Our pref-
erence is to make this important work 
bipartisan, to include input, ideas, and 
revisions from our Republican col-
leagues or bipartisan efforts to do the 
same. But if our Republican colleagues 
decide to oppose this urgent and nec-
essary legislation, we will have to 
move forward without it. We have a re-
sponsibility to help the American peo-
ple fast, particularly given these new 
economic numbers. The Senate will 
begin that work next week. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
MARCH FOR LIFE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
normally, today and tomorrow, we 
would be welcoming many thousands of 
Americans to the Capitol for the an-
nual March for Life. Every year, the 
march is one of the most important 
things that happens here in Wash-
ington. Americans of all ages, diverse 
backgrounds, and many faiths speak up 
peacefully and powerfully for the most 
fundamental human right. They make 
our Nation confront the fact that even 
the most modest protections for inno-
cent life are still not secure. 
The pandemic has taken this year’s 
march online. That is a particular pity, 
given signs that the new administra-
tion may be poised to steamroll even 
the most limited—limited—safeguards 
for conscience, let alone for life itself. 
The new Washington needs to hear 
the marchers more than ever. A case in 
point, the word is out our new adminis-
tration is planning to rescind the Mex-
ico City policy this very day, run over 
the consciences of American taxpayers, 
and put them back on the hook for 
funding abortions overseas. An admin-
istration that wanted to pursue unity 
might observe that 77 percent of Amer-
icans—including a majority of Demo-
crats—and 85 percent of Independents 
don’t want taxpayer dollars to fund 
foreign abortions. 
This and many other commonsense 
pro-life policies enjoy broad support 
from the American people, but the 
radicalism of the modern Democratic 
Party seems dug in. Fortunately, polit-
ical dynamics change, but the moral 
truth does not. Executive orders can’t 
alter the basic science of human life. 
So I thank my fellow Kentuckians and 
all Americans who are participating. 
We will see you in person next year. 
f 
BUDGET 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, on a totally different matter, the 
country has waited to see whether the 
new administration would follow a pro- 
job, pro-worker, pro-working family 
approach or give in to the far left and 
put ideological concerns before kitchen 
table ones. Unfortunately, we didn’t 
have to wait long. 
As recently as October, now-Presi-
dent Biden said: ‘‘You can’t [legislate] 
by executive action unless you’re a dic-
tator.’’ Well, in 1 week, he signed more 
than 30 unilateral actions, and working 
Americans are getting short shrift. 
The President abruptly canceled the 
Keystone Pipeline, a massive setback 
for energy security in North America. 
The Canadian leader called it ‘‘a gut 
punch.’’ I imagine the 11,000 American 
workers, including 8,000 union workers 
who were counting on that work, feel 
the same way. 
We have headed back into an inter-
national pact that would have us self- 
inflict serious pain on working fami-
lies, has failed to curb China’s emis-
sions, and without which our own emis-
sions have been dropping anyway. And 
yesterday, the administration slammed 
the brakes on further domestic energy 
development on the huge swaths of 
land owned by the Federal Govern-
ment: no new oil, gas, or coal leases on 
Federal land. 
Our responsible use of these lands ac-
counts for more than a fifth—one- 
fifth—of 
our 
domestic 
production, 
about 2.8 million barrels per day. That 
is almost the equivalent of Kuwait’s 
daily oil production from our Federal 
lands alone; plus, more than 10 percent 
of domestic natural gas. 
And 2019 marked the first time in 
nearly 70 years when U.S. energy ex-
ports outpaced imports. For the first 
time since the 1950s, our Nation ran an 
energy surplus, not a deficit. That has 
been great news, but some leftwing 
elites are not happy. The sources of 
this affordable domestic energy are not 
sufficiently trendy. 
As John Kerry explained yesterday 
on behalf of the administration, he 
wants the large numbers of American 
workers in those sectors to find ‘‘better 
choices’’—better choices than their 
good jobs that feed their families and 
strengthen our independence. Remem-
ber, with the pipeline cancellation, the 
President effectively closed the door on 
thousands of American jobs with the 
stroke of a pen. 
According to one news report, one 
welder from Pipeliners Local 798, who 
had been working in Nebraska, says he 
has already had to lay off his whole

team before losing his job himself. He 
said he sat down in his truck and sim-
ply cried. 
This latest new prohibition will rep-
licate that heartbreak many times 
over. According to one study, the deci-
sion on Federal lands will leave us 
down nearly 1 million American jobs 
by next year alone—1 million lost jobs 
by next year alone. 
It is a heck of a way to kick off a 
Presidency: mass layoffs of our own 
citizens, and working Americans in 
other sectors will pay as well. One 
analysis found this decision could in-
crease household energy costs by al-
most $20 billion over the next decade, 
and President Biden, John Kerry, and 
the whole gang appear to be just get-
ting warmed up. 
Mr. Kerry admitted yesterday that 
even if the United States somehow 
brought our carbon emissions to zero, 
it wouldn’t make much difference in 
the global picture. That is because our 
competitors, including China, have al-
ready gone roaring past us. 
But there is one kind of cooling these 
policies will achieve. They will ice the 
job market in communities all across 
America. In the State of New Mexico, 
65 percent of oil and gas production is 
tied to Federal lands. By one estimate, 
16,000 jobs will be on the chopping 
block in that State alone—that State 
alone—next year if President Biden’s 
ban holds up. 
In Colorado, it would cost another 
3,000 jobs and more than 40 percent of 
the State’s natural gas production. 
As a Kentuckian, I am all too famil-
iar with the way these Democratic 
policies can hurt communities. Ken-
tucky paid dearly for the first round of 
these liberal policies under President 
Obama. We have no desire to be sub-
jected to a sequel, especially when 
John Kerry says we should take the 
rate at which coal is already declining 
and quintuple it. 
In her confirmation hearing yester-
day, the President’s nominee to be En-
ergy Secretary referenced ‘‘jobs that 
might be sacrificed.’’ Yeah, that is ab-
solutely right. Well, she gets some 
points for honesty. That is what hap-
pened the last time these folks called 
the shots. Jobs were sacrificed, includ-
ing, ultimately, some of the jobs of the 
Democratic politicians who backed 
these policies. 
There is a concept in sports that a 
coach or a manager should never make 
a decision that will make the opposing 
team happy. If they are torn about a 
risky play call or if they are over-
thinking 
a 
pitching 
change, 
they 
should ask themselves which decision 
their opponents would rather see and 
do the opposite. Our new administra-
tion is failing that test on domestic en-
ergy. 
China, Russia, and our other com-
petitors must be thrilled, absolutely 
thrilled that our new government is es-
sentially declaring war on some of our 
own economic foundations to satisfy a 
craving for symbolic gestures—will-
fully throwing our own people out of 
work, reducing our domestic energy se-
curity, raising costs and prices for 
working families—all for no meaning-
ful impact on global temperatures, just 
to buy applause at those international 
conferences, where the participants all 
assemble by private jet. 
It shouldn’t be this way, not with a 
President who campaigned on pro-
tecting the lunch-pail union jobs that 
his left flank wants to eliminate. The 
President was not elected to enact poli-
cies that prompt a certain young Con-
gresswoman from New York City to 
boast online that her radical ideas are 
shaping his energy policies. The last 4 
years proved that growing our pros-
perity, reducing emissions, and expand-
ing domestic energy are actually not in 
tension. We can achieve all three. 
There is nothing green about a tsu-
nami of pink slips for American work-
ers or carting Canadian crude around 
in trucks and trains instead of a pipe-
line. This piecemeal Green New Deal is 
the wrong prescription, wrong for the 
environment, wrong for national secu-
rity, and most of all for the working 
Americans who will soon be formerly 
working Americans if this keeps up.

IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
morning as I came to work in the Cap-
itol, I saw our National Guard troops 
outside. I wanted to thank them, 
again, on behalf of the Senate and the 
people of America for coming to our as-
sistance during the inauguration cere-
monies. Some are still on the job, mak-
ing sure that we maintain order in the 
streets of Washington, DC, and that we 
conduct the business of the American 
people here in the Capitol Building. 
I want to thank them again, particu-
larly the 270 National Guard forces 
from my State of Illinois—I had a 
chance to meet many of them—sacri-
ficing time away from their families to 
serve their Nation. It was a job well 
done. 
For those who continue to do the 
work, we stand by you, and we thank 
you again. 
Heather Cox Richardson does a col-
umn each day that is really a source of 
information that is important. She re-
minded us in her column this morning 
about what happened here in this Cap-
itol Building just 3 weeks ago on Janu-
ary 6. Let me read what she said: 
In testimony yesterday, the acting chief of 
the 
Metropolitan 
Police 
Department 
in 
Washington told the House Appropriations 
Committee that at least 65 officers filed re-
ports of injury after the January 6 attack. 
The chair of the Capitol Police officers’ 
union . . . put the number closer to 140. ‘‘I 
have officers who were not issued helmets 
prior to the attack [and] who have sustained 
brain injuries. One officer has two cracked 
ribs and two smashed spinal discs. One offi-
cer is going to lose his eye, and another was 
stabbed with a metal fence stake,’’ he said. 
One officer died of injuries sustained on Jan-
uary 6. Two officers have since taken their 
own lives. 
I want to put that in the RECORD be-
cause in a week, beginning with the 
impeachment trial, we are going to re-
flect, again, on what happened January 
6. 
Some of my colleagues, and many 
people on their side, are saying we 
shouldn’t spend time talking about 
what happened on January 6. In the 
words of the former Governor of South 
Carolina, Nikki Haley, we ought to 
‘‘get over it’’—‘‘get over it.’’ It is hard 
to get over it when you consider the 
facts that I just read into the RECORD. 
For the families of those officers who 
lost their lives and those who were se-
riously injured, they won’t get over it 
for a long, long time. 
I don’t know what the impeachment 
trial will find in terms of the role of 
the former President of the United 
States, but I believe it is an important 
milestone in America’s history for us 
to stop and recount what actually hap-
pened in this building on January 6, 
where a mob, incited by the President, 
stormed this Capitol, broke through, 
smashing windows and doors, and lit-
erally took control of this Capitol 
Building for several hours. Here in the 
Senate Chamber, we were evacuated. 
Thank goodness, we returned that 
same evening to complete our business 
and complete our work. 
There is ample evidence of what hap-
pened that day by video, photographs, 
and testimony. I hope it is part of the 
record in this impeachment hearing so 
that this generation and future genera-
tions will have no doubt what happened 
that day. 
Already, we have those who are in de-
nial, who are arguing that this was 
really some far-left group that was 
taking over the demonstration—a ludi-
crous argument on its face. And we 
have many who are in complete denial 
that it happened or that it had any-
thing to do with rightwing politics. 
They are wrong. We saw it. We re-
corded it. We are going to put it, in 
part, as part of the record so that 
America knows what happened on that 
day. 
Yesterday, we got a warning that 
this may not be the end of it, that 
there may be more activity. Let me 
say at the outset that I condemn extre-
mism and violence on any part of the 
political spectrum. But yesterday, the

warning was to the right, who appar-
ently are going to continue in their ef-
forts to disrupt life in America and en-
danger the lives of fellow Americans 
and law enforcement officers. 
We need to stand up as a nation and 
say, ‘‘Enough.’’ Whatever your polit-
ical strife, there is no room for extre-
mism and violence in the exercise of a 
constitutional responsibility or right. 
I wanted to make that as part of the 
RECORD as an opening statement. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, now, 
on another issue, this morning, I went 
on a radio show in Bloomington-Nor-
mal, IL, WJBC, Scott Miller. The topic 
de jour—no surprise—was the vaccines, 
the COVID–19 vaccines, and why so 
many people in that part of Central Il-
linois can’t get access to vaccinations. 
I listened to the frustration of people 
who called in to the announcer about 
waiting on the phone for hours, trying 
to get through, unable to make an ap-
pointment, and I called the Governor of 
Illinois, JB Pritzker, to ask him what 
was happening. He gave me some num-
bers in our part of the world, which 
probably reflect our country’s status at 
the moment. 
He said that we were receiving 120,000 
first doses of COVID–19 vaccine each 
week—120,000 a week. We have approxi-
mately 10 million people eligible to be 
vaccinated in Illinois. Those under the 
age of 16 are excluded for reasons deter-
mined by medical professionals, so we 
start with 10 million. We anticipate 
that at least 50 percent are currently 
hoping to get a vaccine as quickly as a 
possible. So we have to get 5 million 
people vaccinated in our State with 
two doses. There are 10 million doses, 
and we are receiving 120,000 a week. Is 
it any wonder that the new President, 
Joe Biden, has spoken up that we need 
to obtain as quickly as possible new 
sources of COVID–19 vaccine in large 
numbers? I support that completely. 
As part of his request for the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, which has come be-
fore the U.S. Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives, in that request he spells 
out what he thinks are the priorities in 
this country, and I believe he is cor-
rect. 
We talk about $160 billion to provide 
the supplies, emergency response, test-
ing, and workforce for our country to 
stop the spread of COVID–19. Could 
there be any higher priority? 
There is $170 billion for schools and 
higher education so they can safely re-
open and operate. Any parent or grand-
parent knows how urgent that need is. 
There is $80 billion for paid leave. It 
includes 14 weeks of paid family med-
ical leave through the end of Sep-
tember. Certainly, people need to have 
that option available either because of 
their own illness or an illness in the 
family. 
Direct payments—already $600 has 
gone out to many families in direct 
payments. Another $1,400 per person 
has been promised. That is included in 
the Biden proposal. 
Unemployment insurance—we still 
are finding record numbers of people 
who are filing for unemployment; $290 
billion extends the current benefits and 
eligibility and a $400 supplement per 
week until the end of September. Rent-
al assistance, SNAP benefits, childcare, 
relief to families, such as the child tax 
credit—the list is lengthy, and I have 
read through it carefully. 
Should we do it? There are some who 
argue: No, we don’t need more stim-
ulus. We have done all we need to do. 
I have to disagree with that conclu-
sion. The news this morning that was 
alluded to by the Democratic leader 
suggests that we are not out of the 
woods by a long shot when it comes to 
the state of the economy. 
CNN reported this morning that the 
Donald Trump final economic report 
card could be very underwhelming. 
[For example,] the U.S. gross domestic 
product, the broadest measure of economic 
activity, is forecast to have grown at an 
annualized rate of 4% between October and 
December [of last year]. 
In a normal year, that would be [cause for 
celebration]—an A+. . . . But 2020 was no 
normal year. 
America is still recovering from the worst 
economic shock in living memory. [Our gross 
domestic product] shrank [by] a record 31.4% 
on an annualized basis in the second quarter. 
. . . [I]t came screaming back at a 33.4% 
annualized pace in the third quarter, [but] 
that wasn’t . . . enough to make up for the 
damage [that was] already done. 
I ask unanimous consent that this ar-
ticle be printed in the RECORD with my 
statement. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From CNN, Jan. 27, 2021] 
DONALD TRUMP’S FINAL ECONOMIC REPORT 
CARD COULD BE VERY UNDERWHELMING 
(By Anneken Tappe) 
NEW YORK—Economists are grading on a 
curve. That’s not a good thing if you’re 
former President Donald Trump. 
US gross domestic product, the broadest 
measure of economic activity, is forecast to 
have grown at an annualized rate of 4% be-
tween October and December. 
In a normal year, that would be something 
to celebrate—an A+ for Trump’s final eco-
nomic report card. But 2020 was no normal 
year. 
America is still recovering from the worst 
economic shock in living memory. GDP 
shrank a record 31.4% on an annualized basis 
in the second quarter. Though it came 
screaming back at a record 33.4% annualized 
pace in the third quarter, that wasn’t nearly 
enough to make up for the damage already 
done. 
So if 33.4% isn’t good enough, 4% sure ain’t 
gonna cut it, either. It would get the nation 
only a small part of the way back to its pre- 
pandemic strength—underscoring just how 
far we still have to go. 
It also doesn’t bode well for the recovery in 
2021. The US economy’s recovery took a hit 
in the last quarter of 2020 as Covid–19 infec-
tions spiked and various states reintroduced 
lockdown measures. 
A BAD SIGN FOR 2021 
President Joe Biden inherited an ailing re-
covery and a broken jobs market. The new 
administration will need an all-hands-on- 
deck approach to get the economy back on 
track this year after the pandemic slammed 
on the breaks. 
Rising infections and renewed restrictions 
on people and businesses put a damper on 
hopes for the recovery in the winter months. 
The first quarter of 2021 ‘‘is likely to be 
even weaker with little reason to expect a 
sudden upswing in activity until Covid re-
strictions are meaningfully eased,’’ said 
James Knightley, chief international econo-
mist at ING, even with more help for the un-
employed in place. 
Biden will need to bring the pandemic 
under control first to get the recovery on the 
right path. 
WHAT’S HOLDING THE ECONOMY BACK? 
Economists have been concerned about the 
state of the recovery for a while. Rising in-
fections in the fall and a renewed increase in 
weekly claims for jobless benefits pointed to 
another rough patch for the economy in the 
winter. 
On the consumer and spending front, retail 
sales logged three straight months without 
any growth between October and December 
as big shopping events like Black Friday and 
Christmas failed to provide an adequate 
boost. And the University of Michigan’s sur-
vey-based consumer sentiment index re-
mained still far below its pre-pandemic level 
and declined again after its most recent peak 
in October. 
Millions of Americans remain unemployed 
because of the crisis, and in December, the 
economy shed 140,000 jobs—a major setback 
for the recovery. It was the first net job loss 
since April. 
The US economy runs on consumer spend-
ing and for as long as Americans don’t spend 
the way they used to—be it because of unem-
ployment, lockdowns or plain caution—it 
will keep the recovery pace slow. 
The rollout of vaccines and ultimate con-
trol of the virus is what will truly transport 
the economy back to its pre-pandemic 
strength, economists believe. But only about 
23.5 million vaccine doses have been adminis-
tered in the United States so far. 
Meanwhile, those who lost their jobs or 
had their hours or pay reduced because of 
the pandemic still require help from the gov-
ernment. 
Trump signed a second stimulus package 
into law in December, which extended var-
ious programs to continue helping the job-
less. But many economists believe the delay 
in getting more measures passed hurt the 
pace of the recovery. 
President Biden’s economic agenda in-
cludes more stimulus still, but whether his 
$1.9 trillion plan will get passed in its origi-
nal form remains to be seen. 
Mr. DURBIN. The statistics are dev-
astating, as well, when it comes to the 
number of people filing for unemploy-
ment—recordbreaking 
numbers—and 
those are included in this article as 
well. 
So we are counseled by the new 
Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, ap-
proved by this body, that we shouldn’t 
take our foot off the accelerator for 
fear that this economy will bog down 
again. Businesses will find it difficult 
to survive—even open—and their em-
ployees, of course, will be without 
work. We need to get this economy 
roaring back, and that means making 
the investment that President Biden is 
asking for. 
Similarly, we need to get our kids 
back in school. I know most parents 
would feel that is true, grandparents as

well. And the sooner we do it, the bet-
ter, but do it safely—safely for the 
teachers, administrators, and everyone 
involved in that decision. 
It is hard to imagine what we have 
been through in the last calendar year, 
the year 2020. I am glad it is behind us. 
We will still have many challenges 
ahead, but it is hard to believe that 
just 1 year ago this week, in the State 
of Illinois, we confirmed our first case 
of coronavirus—1 year ago. A patient 
had returned from China to suburban 
Chicago and transmitted the virus to 
her husband. She was treated success-
fully, as was her husband. 
But in the 365 days since then that 
transpired, 1.1 million COVID–19 cases 
occurred in my State of Illinois—from 
one person a year ago, 1.1 million 
cases—and almost 19,000 Illinoisans 
have died. The story is repeated in 
every State and every community. 
What started as a worry ended up be-
coming a pandemic and one of the 
deadliest in American history. 
Last year, I came to the floor to ask 
unanimous consent for a resolution 
with a simple message, that the United 
States should work with other nations 
around 
the 
world 
to 
address 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. It seemed like a 
commonsense proposition. To think 
that one case in Wuhan, China, has led 
us to where we are today tells us that 
this is a shrinking world. 
We need to tackle that deadly com-
municable disease because it knows no 
boundaries. No nation is safe from 
COVID–19 if it is raging in any part of 
the world. Equally, no nation’s econ-
omy is immune from the impacts of the 
pandemic raging elsewhere. 
I am glad the Senate eventually 
passed the resolution that I introduced, 
affirming the need to join with others 
in fighting the pandemic. 
Now, the first priority is obvious: 
Take care of the American people and 
American families and everyone who 
lives in our Nation. That is the first 
and highest priority for our elected of-
ficials at every single level. 
We are now debating a measure to 
help the American people gain access 
to vaccines—the Biden rescue plan— 
and the harsh economic impact it has 
had on America. President Biden un-
derstands 
the 
immediacy 
of 
these 
needs, and I hope that we in Congress 
do as well. 
As we respond to the COVID–19 crisis 
in America, though, we cannot ignore 
the need for a global response. This 
isn’t a matter of being charitable. It is 
in our national interest and a reflec-
tion of our values to ensure that poorer 
nations have access to vaccines and 
tools to manage their impact. 
The New York Times columnist Nick 
Kristof chronicled this problem in a 
powerful piece earlier this month, enti-
tled ‘‘Starving Children Don’t Cry.’’ He 
noted that while some developing coun-
tries may have avoided high COVID 
death tolls, the pandemic has led, in 
many 
places, 
to 
what 
he 
calls 
‘‘pandemics of hunger, disease and il-
literacy.’’ 
Day 
laborers 
can’t 
find 
work. Campaigns to address malaria, 
polio, AIDS, and malnutrition have 
been disrupted. It is estimated that 
hundreds of thousands of children in 
the developing world will die from mal-
nutrition. Many who survive will face 
lifetimes of disabilities. 
A study by the International Cham-
ber of Commerce found that the global 
cost of unequal global vaccine distribu-
tion will hit affluent countries almost 
as hard as developing countries. 
The study showed what would happen 
if wealthy nations were fully vac-
cinated by the middle of the year but 
poor countries shut out, a likely sce-
nario. 
This week, the World Health Organi-
zation noted that only 1 of 29 low-in-
come countries has begun vaccination, 
and in that particular country of Guin-
ea, only 55 out of 12 million people have 
been reached. 
The study concluded that the global 
economy could lose more than $9 tril-
lion, with nearly half of those costs ab-
sorbed by the United States and other 
wealthy countries. 
We are already seeing how illness in 
poor nations affects us. U.S. exports 
have plunged by nearly 28 percent in 
the last 6 months, resulting in lost jobs 
here, lower profits, and lower wages. 
So that is why I am reintroducing 
legislation to direct the U.S. Treasury 
to use its vote at the International 
Monetary Fund to release what are 
known as special drawing rights. These 
are foreign exchange reserve assets 
maintained by the IMF that can be 
used by developing nations during se-
vere economic downturns, as done dur-
ing the 2008 global financial crisis. 
A release of these special drawing 
rights would not cost American tax-
payers a single dollar, but they would 
help developing nations purchase and 
distribute COVID vaccines and stem 
the pandemic’s economic impact over-
seas. 
This proposal is supported by a broad 
coalition, including American farm 
leaders, business leaders, and trade as-
sociations, leading economists, faith 
groups, labor unions, and humanitarian 
groups. 
I want to thank my cosponsors in 
this effort: Senators SANDERS, CARDIN, 
REED, MERKLEY, and LEAHY. We are 
joined in the House by my colleague 
from 
Illinois, 
Congressman 
CHUY 
GARCI´A. 
Three-quarters of a century ago, 
much of the world lay in ruins as a re-
sult of a global war. The United States 
made an unprecedented commitment 
to help the nations of the world rise 
from the ashes of World War II and re-
build. We did so because it was in keep-
ing with our moral beliefs and it served 
our political and economic interests. 
The Marshall Plan and other inter-
national aid efforts by the United 
States helped make America the most 
powerful Nation on Earth, politically 
and economically. This global crisis, 
COVID–19, gives us another oppor-
tunity to strengthen America as we 
help repair a damaged world. 
Of course, our first priority is Amer-
ican families, and this effort would not 
take a single dollar away from buying 
the vaccines that are necessary to keep 
our Nation safe. But by using these 
special drawing rights, we provide re-
sources to some of the poorest nations 
around the world so that they, too, can 
start vaccinating their population. 
This world got sick, we believe, be-
cause of one person in China, and it 
spread around the world. That is, at 
least, the theory that has been backed 
up by evidence so far. So let’s make 
certain that, as we address this issue, 
we do it on a global basis. 
I urge the Senate to support this 
measure as a way to not only do the 
right thing for our less fortunate 
brothers and sisters around the world 
but as a way to help our own pandemic 
and economic recovery. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
NOMINATION OF PETER PAUL 
MONTGOMERY BUTTIGIEG 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, yes-
terday I voted to advance out of com-
mittee President Biden’s nomination of 
Pete Buttigieg as head of the Depart-
ment of Transportation, and the full 
Senate will soon vote to confirm him. 
I had a good meeting and discussion 
with Mr. Buttigieg last week. We 
talked about a number of South Da-
kota transportation priorities. 
Our Nation is due for another major 
infrastructure bill, and I asked Mr. 
Buttigieg to commit to maintaining 
strong investments in rural highway 
funding and other rural transportation 
priorities as part of any infrastructure 
legislation. A strong rural transpor-
tation infrastructure benefits the en-
tire national transportation system by 
connecting major highways and rail-
ways to the regions that produce so 
many of the agricultural and industrial 
products that we rely on. It is key to 
helping South Dakota farmers and 
ranchers and farmers and ranchers 
around the country get their products 
to market. 
I also asked Mr. Buttigieg to work 
with me to improve Tribal transpor-
tation infrastructure. Right now, pros-
perous Tribes in populous areas receive 
a disproportionate amount of Tribal 
transportation funding, even though 
their needs are often less pressing than 
those facing large rural Tribes, like 
those in South Dakota. I am com-
mitted to ensuring that rural Tribes 
get their fair share of Tribal transpor-
tation funding, and I was pleased that

Mr. Buttigieg agreed to work with me 
on this issue. 
I also enjoyed discussing autonomous 
vehicle legislation with him. He shares 
my interest in the technological, envi-
ronmental, and safety benefits self- 
driving vehicles can offer, and I look 
forward to working with him on this 
issue. 
Highway bills have always been a 
place for bipartisan cooperation, and 
the bill released last Congress by Sen-
ators BARRASSO and CARPER was no ex-
ception. I hope that bipartisan tradi-
tion will continue in this Congress and 
that Democrats and Republicans can 
work together to deliver a significant 
infrastructure package in the near fu-
ture. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, on 
the subject of bipartisanship, I am dis-
turbed by the rumors that Democrats 
plan to use reconciliation to force an-
other COVID bill through Congress on 
partisan lines before even giving good- 
faith effort to bipartisan negotiations. 
Republicans are more than willing to 
work with Democrats on additional 
targeted COVID relief legislation. 
Now, I won’t pretend that we don’t 
have reservations about some of the 
measures that Democrats have pro-
posed. For instance, I don’t think an 
emergency COVID relief bill is the 
place to push through a change that 
would more than double the Federal 
minimum wage and directly increase 
expenses on businesses that have been 
decimated by the pandemic. That is a 
policy with a lot of economic con-
sequences, and it shouldn’t be pushed 
through Congress in a hasty fashion. 
Republicans are also concerned about 
the enormous amount of money that 
Democrats want to spend. We have al-
ready spent more than $4 trillion to ad-
dress this pandemic, and we need to be 
very careful—very careful—about addi-
tional spending and appropriate only 
what is necessary to respond to this 
pandemic and with an eye to the bur-
den that we are putting on the econ-
omy and on young Americans as we in-
crease our national debt. 
The higher our national debt, the 
greater the drag on economic growth 
and the more likely it is that young 
Americans will face increasingly bur-
densome tax bills in the future to meet 
our debt obligations. 
But let me be very clear. While Re-
publicans 
certainly 
have 
concerns 
about some of the Democrats’ pro-
posals, we are committed to defeating 
this pandemic and to getting Ameri-
cans vaccinated, and we are ready to 
work with Democrats on any necessary 
COVID relief legislation that would 
achieve that objective. 
It would be very disappointing if 
Democrats decided to shove a partisan 
bill through Congress without even at-
tempting to work with Republicans. 
MARCH FOR LIFE 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, be-
fore I close, I want to take a moment 
to recognize those South Dakotans par-
ticipating in the virtual March for Life 
tomorrow. 
We have gotten used to saying ‘‘it is 
going to be a little different this year’’ 
during the pandemic, and that applies 
to the March for Life as well. Usually, 
tens of thousands of Americans travel 
to Washington, DC, every January to 
participate in the march—Americans 
from every State in the union, of every 
political persuasion, of every religion 
or none at all—all united by their com-
mitment to defending the dignity and 
value and humanity of the unborn 
child. 
This year the march will be virtual, 
but pro-life Americans will still be 
united in spirit. To all of those South 
Dakotans virtually marching tomor-
row and to all those Americans every-
where united in the pro-life cause, 
thank you. Thank you for standing— 
standing up every year on the anniver-
sary of the Roe v. Wade decision. 
Most of all, thank you for everything 
that you do throughout the year, be-
cause the biggest work of the pro-life 
movement 
happens 
outside 
of 
the 
March for Life. It happens in churches 
around America, where congregations 
collect money to support prenatal care 
for pregnant women in need or gather 
diapers and baby supplies to give to 
struggling mothers. It happens on col-
lege campuses, where pro-life students 
educate their peers about the reality of 
abortion. It happens in crisis preg-
nancy centers, where moms and dads 
facing unplanned pregnancies are met 
with resources and love and support. It 
happens at maternity homes, where 
single moms get the support they need 
to have their babies and to build job 
skills or get an education. 
Every day, you are building a culture 
of life in this country with your work 
and your political action and your 
prayers. I know that is not always 
easy, but the race is not to the swift 
nor the strong. It is to those who en-
dure, and I am confident that, sooner 
or later, right and justice will prevail 
because we have the truth on our side— 
the truth that every human being, no 
matter how old or how young, no mat-
ter the race or the color of their skin, 
no matter their religion or political 
persuasion, is created in the image and 
likeness of God and has infinite dignity 
and worth. 
So keep standing up for the babies, 
and tomorrow I will be joining my 
prayers with yours that one day soon 
the right to life of unborn human 
beings will be protected in law. 
May God bless you all. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
MARCH FOR LIFE 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, our Na-
tion was founded on an incredibly pow-
erful and truly audacious idea. The 
idea was that every single human being 
was created equal, with rights that 
come from your Creator, from God— 
not from the government, not from the 
laws, not even from the Constitution or 
your leaders. You are born with those 
rights. Inherent in that is our powerful 
national commitment that I think re-
mains to this day, the belief that ev-
eryone should have freedom and that 
everyone—because freedom comes with 
those rights—and that everyone be 
treated fairly. 
For 244 years, our story has been that 
of a nation on a continuous and a 
steady march to live up to those ideals. 
Tomorrow, thousands will come to 
Washington once again for a different 
march but one that I believe is tied di-
rectly to this Nation’s ongoing quest to 
fulfill the promise of its founding. 
Almost half a century ago, the Su-
preme Court of the United States de-
cided that within our Constitution, 
there was the implicit right to end the 
life of an unborn child. Since then, 
every single day in this country, un-
born human beings have had their life 
ended before they even drew their first 
breath. They are, in essence, denied the 
freedom to live, not because they did 
anything wrong; they are denied this 
most basic of rights unfairly because of 
circumstances they have nothing to do 
with and do not control. 
That this occurs here is shameful 
enough, and I believe that is how his-
tory will regard it; that we use tax-
payer money to promote it and export 
it abroad is outrageous. 
Before we even passed a bill to deal 
with the pandemic or to bring back 
good jobs to the United States or any 
of the other major issues confronting 
our country, in one of his first acts as 
President, President Biden decided to 
prioritize tearing up the so-called Mex-
ico City policy—a policy that right-
fully bans our taxpayer dollars from 
being sent to organizations that use 
them to perform or promote abortions 
overseas. 
Abortion is a very difficult and un-
comfortable topic. No one can pretend 
that if some 15-year-old girl is preg-
nant and afraid—afraid of her parents, 
afraid of what others might think, 
afraid for her future—that she faces an 
easy choice. It is not. 
It doesn’t feel fair, it doesn’t feel like 
freedom to have laws that tell people 
what they can or cannot do with their 
body, but in this case, the challenge we 
have is that it is a case that puts the 
fundamental rights of two people into 
direct conflict—the right, as most defi-
nitely exists, of a mother to choose 
what to do with her body versus the 
right of an unborn child to live. It

January 28, 2021 
forces us to decide which one of these 
two rights wins out in those cir-
cumstances. 
I personally, for one, and those who 
march tomorrow have chosen life—not 
because it is an easy choice but be-
cause, to me, it is a clear one because 
the right to live is the one right upon 
which all the other rights we claim de-
pend. Without life, there is no speech 
to protect, and there is no religion to 
practice. Without life, frankly, nothing 
else matters. 
I would point out that being pro-life 
is not just about the right to be born; 
it also means the right to live and to 
thrive. Once a child is born, that child 
depends on their parents or whoever 
their guardians are who are raising 
them, and they have a moral and legal 
duty to care for them—not just to feed 
them, not just to clothe them, not just 
to house them, but also to promote a 
safe and stable home and the chance at 
a good education and a better future. 
That is why I deeply believe that pro- 
life must also mean being pro-parent. 
Being a parent is the most influential 
role anyone will ever have. It is the 
most important job any of us will ever 
have. That is why I worked to and we 
were successful in expanding the child 
tax credit 2 years ago. That is why I 
stand ready now to work with Presi-
dent Biden to expand it even further. 
I am concerned about some of the de-
tails of the policies he has outlined. 
For example, his proposal appears to 
unfairly benefit parents who send their 
children to commercial childcare over 
stay-at-home parents or grandparents 
or other caregivers. But this is an area 
where we have a common goal and one 
where I believe we can find a way to 
work together. 
It is also why I support creating the 
opportunity for every parent in Amer-
ica to have access to paid family leave, 
because no one should be thrown into 
welfare or debt or bankruptcy because 
they got pregnant, because they had a 
child. 
It is also, by the way, why I support 
school choice. In America, rich parents 
can afford to send their kids to any 
school they want, and they do. Upper 
middle class parents can move to 
neighborhoods 
with 
good 
public 
schools. But it is unfair that the only 
parents in America who are forced to 
send their children to the school the 
government tells them—even if that 
school is failing their children—are the 
parents who don’t make enough money 
to have another option. 
For 21st-century America to move 
closer to fulfilling our founding prin-
ciple of equality, of freedom, of fair-
ness, every child deserves the right not 
just to be born but also the right to 
live and to thrive, the right not just to 
exist but the right to pursue and fulfill 
their potential. 
I believe that what is at stake is 
nothing less than our identity as a na-
tion. If we become a place where your 
right to be born and your ability to 
succeed is determined by who your par-
ents are or by the circumstances of 
your conception, then we may remain, 
indeed, a rich and a powerful and an 
important country, but we will no 
longer be a special one. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, it is 
nice to see you in the Chair, Mr. Presi-
dent. I haven’t seen that for a while. 
Congratulations to you. 
I feel like yesterday I was in the 
movie ‘‘Back to the Future.’’ I rise 
today to voice my deep concern with 
the lengthy Executive order that Presi-
dent Biden issued yesterday pertaining 
to climate, and my larger concerns 
about where the Biden administration 
is moving with regard to their energy 
and environment agenda. 
President Biden, very passionately, 
as we sat out on the steps, called for 
unity in his January 20 inauguration 
speech. But as his first actions, Presi-
dent Biden managed to kill thousands 
of jobs and paralyze America’s indus-
try—the energy industry. 
His order yesterday put a morato-
rium on new oil and gas leases on Fed-
eral lands. This is an economic, energy, 
and national security disaster, in my 
view. This order moves America from 
energy independence back to relying on 
foreign sources for fuel—and a lot of 
times these are the countries that have 
much more lax environmental policies 
than we have right here in the United 
States. 
The order also usurps our States’ 
rights—the States’ rights which are to 
manage their own energy industries. 
As you know, I come from an energy- 
producing State. We have a proud her-
itage of that. So what about the States 
that rely on tax revenues from the en-
ergy industry to fund education? We 
see what has happened with education 
now 
under 
the 
pandemic. 
More 
headwinds into how do we deliver a 
great education product is a question 
we are going to be answering over the 
next several months and years. So any 
ideas? 
I wonder if President Biden actually 
talked to any of the Governors of these 
States to see what the impact of what 
he was doing might have. 
But what we saw yesterday in the 
press conference was President Biden 
and Gina McCarthy and John Kerry’s 
ultimate goal, which is to ban fossil 
fuels. They were pretty upfront about 
that. 
So my skepticism, when I hear that 
the administration is going to give in-
dustry time to transition and give 
workers a clean energy job—that is 
where I found myself thinking: I am in 
‘‘Back to the Future.’’ I have heard 
this before because I vividly remember 
the empty promises of the past. 
This is a deeply personal issue for me 
because I have lived through this. I 
have seen this playbook before. So we 
are back to the future. 
The Obama administration said the 
very same things to West Virginians. 
In fact, I remember the same people 
saying the same things, and I remem-
ber the utterly unachievable regu-
latory requirements that Gina McCar-
thy created in her position as head of 
the EPA that decimated my State. 
I remember the thousands of jobs 
lost—and still lost—and the hopeless-
ness and then the succeeding opioid 
epidemic that followed. 
I remember begging the Obama EPA 
to come to West Virginia to see how 
the regulations, with no time to transi-
tion, were destroying more of our 
State’s economy. They were destroying 
our families. They really didn’t seem 
to care. The only response I got in one 
of my hearings was, well, they will 
come to Pittsburgh. Well, that is not 
coming to West Virginia. 
Look, I am not here to just put down 
the Biden administration. I want to 
work with the administration, and I 
am going to be in a position to do that 
as ranking member on EPW. I want to 
be a part of the solution. I am not a cli-
mate denier. We all need to take care 
of our planet. We must be good stew-
ards of our Earth, of our water. We 
know it is the right thing to do. 
The free market is already moving in 
that direction, which was part of the 
presentation yesterday. Private compa-
nies are cutting their emissions. That 
is awesome. And as we see the emission 
figures, they have gone way down over 
the last 15 years. 
Consumers moving toward greener 
products? That is great. I find myself 
doing that in my everyday living, and 
it is great. I feel like, in some ways, I 
am doing my small part at home. 
But a national energy transition 
really needs time, and the Biden ad-
ministration needs to be very clear 
about what their timetables really are. 
They also need to be very clear about 
who is really in charge here. This is an-
other one of my concerns. President 
Biden’s nominees—Michael Regan; Jen-
nifer Granholm; Brenda Mallory, at 
CEQ, Janet McCabe; and even Pete 
Buttigieg—have all been tasked with 
addressing climate. They are going to 
be tripping all over each other, before 
you even consider those avoiding Sen-
ate confirmation, process all of this to-
gether—McCarthy, Kerry, and a whole 
host of other czars who aren’t account-
able to Congress. So who is really 
going to be making the decisions? I 
think, from yesterday’s press con-
ference, it is pretty clear what the an-
swer to that question could probably 
be. 
Will this Cabinet actually wield any 
power or will the decisions be made in 
the White House in an effort to avoid 
public and congressional scrutiny?

S188 
January 28, 2021 
The American people really need to 
know. West Virginians need to know. 
New Jerseyans need to know. I will 
definitely be asking those questions in 
the upcoming hearing. 
In closing, I would just like to say 
that America is a great and very proud 
energy producer. West Virginia has 
powered the country for decades, and 
we are incredibly proud of that fact. 
Coal, natural gas, oil, solar, wind, nu-
clear, biomass—our country has been 
incredibly blessed with energy re-
sources, and using all of them keeps 
Americans safe and keeps our country 
running. 
Eliminating fossil fuels from our en-
ergy mix will lead to higher utility 
costs and less reliability. So whom 
does that really hurt? It hurts those in 
the lower and mid-income category— 
the ones that are hurting right now be-
cause of this pandemic. And you can 
just ask California about the rising 
cost and the rise in unreliability of the 
grid. 
Renewables can’t power our country 
at 100 percent all the time right now. 
Maybe in the future, but right now 
they can’t, and battery technology 
hasn’t been able to fill that gap. 
But we can address climate change 
together through innovation and tech-
nology. We already have new markets 
for coal and carbon products. We know 
investing in carbon capture and utiliza-
tion and storage is critical. For a lot of 
reasons it is a win-win on both sides. 
We know new technologies are pro-
gressing every single day, and we have 
been working on this issue in a bipar-
tisan way. Senator WHITEHOUSE and I 
were the main proponents of the 45Q 
credit for capturing carbon and reusing 
it. 
But I am very concerned that Presi-
dent Biden’s Executive order yesterday 
really alienated some of the key play-
ers in the conversation, and I don’t 
think that is the way to build unity. 
Here we go—back to the future, pick-
ing winners and losers. That is pitting 
American jobs against one and the 
other, and that can create and will cre-
ate resentment across the country. 
So I urge the President—let’s tackle 
these climate challenges together, not 
through overreaching Presidential or-
ders and Federal regulations. This 
country has risen to every single chal-
lenge that we have had. This climate 
challenge is no different. I understand 
the urgency. I understand the issue. 
But with our American ingenuity, we 
can find these solutions together. 
So let’s make our future one that we 
build together. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, it 
has been more than a year now since 
the first COVID–19 case was confirmed 
here in the United States. As the war 
against this virus has been fought, it 
has evolved over the last 12 months, 
and our country has been challenged 
like never before in my memory. 
Healthcare workers across the coun-
try have heroically battled this cruel 
virus, often with insufficient equip-
ment and personnel. Frontline workers 
in delivery trucks, grocery stores, and 
other essential businesses have kept 
the cogs of society running. 
As a whole, we have hunkered down 
and tried to stop the spread of the 
virus until enough Americans could get 
vaccinated. We all have come to realize 
that is really the gold standard in de-
feating this virus. The Trump adminis-
tration launched Operation Warp Speed 
to accelerate the research and develop-
ment of therapeutics and vaccines to 
move us toward that goal as soon as 
possible. 
Just last summer, when President 
Trump predicted we would have an ef-
fective vaccine by the end of the year, 
there was some serious skepticism— 
and you might even call it blowback— 
from some of the critics. One media 
outlet published a fact check saying it 
would require nothing short of a ‘‘med-
ical miracle’’ to have a vaccine by the 
end of last year. 
Thanks to the leadership on a bipar-
tisan basis here and the marvels of 
science and human ingenuity, that so- 
called miracle came true not once but 
twice, and we are expecting more vac-
cines to eventually be approved in the 
near term. The world’s brightest sci-
entific minds used the foundation built 
by decades of vaccine research to craft 
lifesaving and, in fact, world-changing 
vaccines. 
Less than 11 months after the first 
COVID–19 case was discovered in the 
United States, the very first vaccine 
was administered after it was ap-
proved—11 months. The number of 
Americans who have been vaccinated 
against COVID–19 is growing every day, 
and so far, more than 24.5 million doses 
have been administered nationwide. 
Nearly 2 million of those doses have 
gone into the arms of my fellow Tex-
ans. Texas became the first State to 
administer 1 million doses—an accom-
plishment that underscores the hard 
work of our State and local leaders and 
our public health officials, our private 
partners and healthcare workers. 
Every day, our public health experts 
are evaluating the current distribution 
process to make improvements and 
speed up the vaccination process. The 
State has now set up mass vaccination 
hubs to expedite distribution and ad-
minister as many doses as they can as 
quickly as they can. 
While these sites are an efficient way 
to administer vaccines to Texans, we 
need to do more in rural parts of the 
country. I was glad to see in my State 
Governor Abbott’s announcement that 
the State is launching a mobile vaccine 
pilot program to ramp up vaccination 
efforts in rural parts of the State. 
Those vaccinations kick off today, and 
with the support of our incredible 
Texas National Guardsmen, more at- 
risk Texans will be vaccinated against 
this virus. 
With currently two approved vac-
cines and potentially more on the way, 
we are beginning to see the light at the 
end of the tunnel, and it is getting big-
ger and brighter every day. But we 
can’t take our foot off the gas—we all 
know that. Just as we led an aggressive 
effort to develop vaccines, it is time to 
redouble our efforts to distribute those 
vaccines. 
I worry we are not starting off on a 
strong footing. In December, President- 
Elect Biden announced his administra-
tion’s goals to get 100 million shots in 
the arms of Americans within the first 
100 days of his Presidency. That an-
nouncement came about a week before 
the first doses of the vaccine were dis-
tributed—before we had a real-world 
test of the processes that had been in 
planning for months. 
We are now several weeks into this 
nationwide vaccination campaign, and 
the Biden administration has stuck by 
this initial benchmark. The President 
has repeatedly described this as an 
‘‘ambitious goal’’—a statement that 
has led to a fair amount of head- 
scratching, not because it is too ag-
gressive, as some people thought Presi-
dent Trump’s proposed vaccine deliv-
ery date was, but because it is too mod-
est. 
One physician and public health ex-
pert described this as ‘‘a disappoint-
ingly low bar.’’ An Associated Press 
headline evaluated the situation pretty 
well when it said: ‘‘Biden’s early ap-
proach to virus: Underpromise, over-
deliver.’’ 
The truth is, we were largely on 
track to meet President Biden’s ambi-
tious goal even before he took the oath 
of office. On Inauguration Day, more 
than 1.6 million doses had been admin-
istered, and over the last week, the av-
erage number of vaccinations has ex-
ceeded 1.5 million a day. It is hard to 
really frame this as a goal when in re-
ality you could throw the entire oper-
ation on cruise control and surpass it. 
On Monday evening, President Biden 
appeared to up the target to 150 million 
doses in the first 100 days, which would 
track with the 1.5 million doses we are 
currently seeing administered. But the 
White House Press Secretary walked 
back that claim the following day. 
One hundred million doses in 100 days 
is certainly catchy, and I have no 
doubt the administration has tried to 
underpromise so it can be seen as over-
delivering. That is not altogether a bad 
strategy. But the goal here is not to set 
a target you are almost certain to 
meet. After all, we didn’t see the pre-
vious administration set a target of a 
successful vaccine by the summer of 
2021, which is what many experts be-
lieved to be the most feasible. So I

would urge the administration and all 
of us to accede to a truly ambitious 
vaccination schedule and motivate the 
newly assembled team at the White 
House to achieve it and to provide the 
resources that they may need from 
Congress in order for them to execute 
that plan. There is no reason to stick 
to a goal we were on track to meet be-
fore President Biden was even sworn 
in. 
President Biden, of course, ran a 
campaign criticizing the previous ad-
ministration’s handling of the COVID– 
19 virus, and he campaigned on the 
promise to lead us out of that crisis. 
But this modest goal is not going to 
get us there fast enough. 
Researchers at Baylor College of 
Medicine in Houston say we need to be 
vaccinating 3 million people a day. 
That is double the pace we are seeing 
right now and triple the Biden adminis-
tration’s self-described ambitious plan. 
The past year has been full of sci-
entific developments and bold action 
by Congress and the administration to 
develop and distribute vaccines to the 
American people. We simply can’t af-

YEMEN 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, this 
is a screen shot from a video taken dur-
ing a school field trip on August 9, 2018. 
These are Yemeni schoolchildren going 
to school in a northern governorate in-
side the country, and they are on their 
way either to or back from a picnic 
that they were having with their class-
mates. 
As you can see, they are school-
children of elementary age—around 8, 
9, 10 years old. They don’t look any dif-
ferent than what school children here 
in the United States would look like on 
their way to a fun-filled school field 
trip. There is a little boy catching a 
little nap somehow amidst all of the 
den of the rest of his classmates so ex-
cited. 
They are excited because there isn’t 
and there wasn’t a lot of fun to be had 
for schoolchildren in Yemen today or 
in 2018. A civil war still plagues that 
country and plagues Yemeni children 
who are too often facing starvation and 
disease, but on this day, there was fun 
to be had. 
This is that schoolbus hours later. 
Forty children died when a U.S.-made 
bomb dropped from the sky and hit this 
schoolbus. Not every child on that bus 
died, miraculously, but 40 children on 
the bus and around the bus did. It was 
a war crime. 
The Saudis, in the aftermath of the 
incident, defended it saying that it was 
a legal action. They were targeting 
enemy leaders who were responsible for 
recruiting and training young children. 
They hit a schoolbus in the middle of 
the day, right next to a crowded mar-
ketplace. It wasn’t on a lonely road. It 
was in a crowded area. It is why not 
only people on the bus died, but chil-
dren and families surrounding the bus 
died as well. 
This was a military strike done, in 
part, as part of a coalition campaign of 
which the United States is a member. 
It is not just that we sold the bomb 
that hit this bus. We participated and 
still do participate in this military 
campaign in a myriad of ways. 
For years, we flew planes in the sky 
that put fuel into the Saudi and 
Emirati jets that dropped these bombs. 
We embedded U.S. personnel in the op-
erations center that planned these 
bombing campaigns, and maybe, most 
importantly of all, we lent moral au-
thority to the Saudi-led campaign in-
side Yemen. 
But over the course of our time as a 
coalition partner with Saudi Arabia, 
the war in Yemen has been a national 
security apocalypse for the United 
States. Our bombs and our planes have 
been used to kill thousands of civilians; 
17,000 civilians have died inside Yemen 
since the beginning of this war. 
The war has caused the world’s worst 
humanitarian 
catastrophe 
on 
the 
ground inside Yemen. Over 100,000 chil-
dren have died of starvation and dis-
ease. Yemen, since 2015, has been the 
site of the world’s worst cholera out-
break anywhere in the world during all 
of our lifetimes—likely caused by the 
targeting of water treatment facilities 
by the coalition, of which the United 
States is a member. 
And inside this country, Yemenis 
rightfully blame the United States for 
this cataclysm. They know that it is 
our equipment, they know that it is 
our bombs, and they know that it is 
that moral authority that the United 
States gives to this war through our 
decision to continue to take part in it, 
human rights crime after human rights 
crime. 
It has radicalized a generation of 
Yemenis against the United States. It 
has made us part and parcel of repeated 
human rights violations, and it has 
created a chaotic environment on the 
ground in Yemen that has allowed for 
AQAP, the wing of al-Qaida with the 
clearest designs to hit the United 
States, again, room to govern and 
room to grow. AQAP and ISIS are able 
to operate and control territory inside 
Yemen because of the chaos created by 
this civil war. 
Iran has grown stronger. At the be-
ginning, Iran and the Houthis, who are 
on the other side of this civil war, had 
a slightly tenuous connection, but as 
the war has dragged on, the Houthis 
have had to become more and more re-
liant on Iranian assistance and Iranian 
expertise. Iran has grown stronger and 
stronger inside Yemen and inside the 
region as this war persists. In every 
way, it has been a nightmare, from a 
security perspective, for the United 
States. 
But with the election and inaugura-
tion of President Biden, our participa-
tion in this national security cata-
clysm is coming to an end. I come to 
the floor today to thank the Biden ad-
ministration and to thank the incom-
ing Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, 
for their recognition that it is no 
longer in our security interest to be a 
part of this. 
The Biden administration has made 
several very important decisions that 
they have announced at the outset of 
their term in office: one, the plan to 
withdraw from the military coalition; 
second, a decision to suspend arm sales 
to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who are 
the primary participants in this coali-
tion. UAE has dramatically scaled 
back their involvement—to their cred-
it. The Saudis continue to fight this 
war on the ground and in the air. 
And lastly—and, perhaps, most im-
mediately importantly—the Trump ad-
ministration announced that they were 
reserving an eleventh-hour decision by 
the Trump administration naming the 
Houthis a terrorist group. 
Now, the Houthis are incredibly bad 
actors. The Houthis are also guilty of 
war crimes in and around this conflict. 
They recruit child soldiers. They delib-
erately hold up aid and don’t allow it 
to get to the citizens in areas under 
which they control. The Houthis have a 
lot to answer for as well. But by nam-
ing them a terrorist group, what the 
Trump administration effectively did 
was to stop the international aid com-
munity from being able to deliver any 
aid into Yemen because the Houthis 
control some of the most important 
ports, and 80 percent of the aid is com-
mercial food. That would have all 
stopped if you couldn’t run aid through 
ports controlled by an organization 
named at the eleventh hour by the 
Trump administration as a terrorist 
organization. 
The Biden administration has made a 
decision to suspend that designation to 
make sure that we are not going to end 
up with millions of people starving in-
side Yemen because the United States 
makes the decision to eliminate the 
ability of humanitarian groups to get 
food on the ground in Yemen. They are 
all incredibly important decisions that 
the administration has made—deci-
sions supported by a majority of this 
body. 
We have voted here in the Senate, on 
a bipartisan basis, to end the U.S. par-
ticipation in the war in Yemen. We 
didn’t have a veto-proof majority. So 
we couldn’t overcome the President’s 
veto. But there is a bipartisan coali-
tion that believes the United States

shouldn’t have anything to do with 
this, and President Biden is now effec-
tuating that bipartisan consensus in 
policy. 
Lastly, let me say this. Saudi Arabia 
is an important security partner for 
the United States. The UAE is an im-
portant security partner for the United 
States. We have an important counter-
terrorism relationship. The Saudis and 
the Emirates have been part of this 
groundbreaking detente with Israel, re-
sulting in several recognition agree-
ments. That is great for U.S. security 
interests in the region. But it is time 
for us to reset those relationships to 
make clear that if our Gulf partners 
are going to participate in actions in-
side the region that are terrible for our 
security interests, then we can’t join 
them in those actions—a reset that in-
cludes an expectation that the Saudis 
and the Emirates address what is a 
very disturbing downward trend in the 
ability 
of 
individuals 
inside 
those 
countries to have political space with 
which to contest grievances with the 
regimes. 
It is time for us to make sure that 
our relationships with our Gulf allies 
are always consistent with U.S. na-
tional security endeavors, and the 
Biden administration is off to a very 
good start in resetting those relation-
ships by pulling ourselves out of a war 
inside Yemen that has killed 17,000 ci-
vilians, caused 100,000 kids to die of 
starvation and disease, and ends up 
with our bombs doing this to a school 
bus full of 8-, 9-, and 10-year-olds. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Iowa. 
f 
NOMINATION OF ALEJANDRO 
NICHOLAS MAYORKAS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
the Senate is considering the nomina-
tion of Mr. Mayorkas to serve as Sec-
retary of Homeland Security. I come to 
the floor at this point, before we vote 
on that motion today, to raise ques-
tions about whether or not he should 
be in that position as Secretary of 
Homeland Security and the fact that I 
will be voting negative. 
I am familiar with Mr. Mayorkas 
from my past oversight of the EB–5 in-
vestment visa program. From 2009 
until 2013, Mr. Mayorkas served as Di-
rector of the U.S. Citizenship and Im-
migration Services, which administers 
that EB–5 visa program. 
During that time, more than 15 whis-
tleblowers approached my office to 
raise questions about Mr. Mayorkas 
and his management of the EB–5 pro-
gram. The whistleblowers allege that 
Mr. Mayorkas was intervening in rou-
tine and technical matters that were 
not typically handled by the Director 
of that Division. They also alleged that 
he was doing so at the request of well- 
connected Democratic politicians and 
other 
politically 
connected 
stake-
holders. 
As my colleagues are aware, I have 
long criticized the fraud and abuse that 
are rampant in the EB–5 program, and 
I have continually reintroduced bipar-
tisan legislation with Senator LEAHY 
to reform the program. So it shouldn’t 
be a surprise to any of my colleagues 
that when I hear from 15 different 
whistleblowers anything about the EB– 
5 program, I would further investigate 
it. 
I have also conducted consistent 
oversight of the EB–5 program across 
Presidential administrations, whether 
they were Democrat or Republican. So 
when whistleblowers approach my of-
fice with these serious allegations, as I 
said before, I am determined to get to 
the bottom of these matters. 
One of the cases in which whistle-
blowers said Mr. Mayorkas had inter-
vened involved a company with ties to 
former Secretary Clinton’s brother, 
Anthony Rodham. 
Mr. Rodham’s company wasn’t happy 
with the speed with which its applica-
tions were being conducted by the Cus-
toms and Immigration Service, so com-
pany representatives made repeated in-
quiries to the Department of Homeland 
Security and Mr. Mayorkas. And they 
did this in an effort to get Mr. 
Mayorkas to speed things up. 
My investigation found that between 
2010 and 2013, Mr. Mayorkas had nearly 
a dozen contacts with that company, 
including direct communications with 
its attorneys. Mr. Mayorkas forwarded 
requests from the company along to his 
team, marking at least one of those 
forwarded messages as ‘‘high priority.’’ 
He became heavily involved in the 
process of revising a draft of a tech-
nical decision from his Division’s Ad-
ministrative Appeals Office that was 
initially unfavorable to the company. 
So, because of his involvement, in the 
end, the opinion was rewritten in a 
manner that was much more favorable 
to Mr. Rodham’s company. 
In 2013, I wrote Mr. Mayorkas five 
letters about his management of the 
EB–5 program. In those letters, I asked 
him detailed questions in order to get 
his side of the story, and when he 
didn’t answer my initial questions, I 
wrote him repeatedly to follow up. 
At this point, it has been more than 
7 years, and I still have not received 
answers to more than 25 specific ques-
tions that I asked during that 2013 in-
vestigation. 
Following his nomination to serve as 
Department of Homeland Security Sec-
retary, I wrote to Mr. Mayorkas again 
on January 15 to raise my concerns and 
to provide him yet another opportunity 
to answer my questions. He sent me a 
very short response on January 19 
that—can you believe this?—still failed 
to answer most of the questions that I 
was trying to get answers for. 
It is very important for nominees 
confirmed by this body to be responsive 
to congressional oversight requests. 
Mr. Mayorkas consistently refused to 
respond to my questions, and that 
should concern all of us in the U.S. 
Senate because no Senator should be 
denied answers to his questions doing 
proper 
oversight 
of 
the 
executive 
branch. 
Furthermore, we now know that 
many of the whistleblower allegations 
made to my office were accurate. Many 
whistleblowers who approached my of-
fice raised similar concerns with John 
Roth, the Obama-appointed inspector 
general at the Department of Home-
land Security at that time, who re-
leased his office’s report detailing its 
investigation into these matters way 
back in 2015. 
In that 2015 report, Inspector General 
Roth found that ‘‘employees’ belief 
that Mr. Mayorkas favored certain po-
litically powerful EB–5 stakeholders 
was reasonable.’’ That is the end of 
quote of the inspector general’s report. 
The IG also said that the number and 
variety of witnesses who came forward 
in his investigation was ‘‘highly un-
usual.’’ Allegations didn’t come from 
one or two disgruntled employees, ac-
cording to the inspector general; they 
came from current and retired career 
and noncareer members of the Senior 
Executive Service, as well as all levels 
of supervisors, immigration officers, 
attorneys, and employees involved in 
fraud detection and in national secu-
rity. 
According to Inspector General Roth, 
the fact ‘‘[t]hat so many individuals 
were willing to step forward and tell 
. . . what happened [was] evidence of 
deep resentment about Mr. Mayorkas’s 
actions related to the EB–5 program.’’ 
That is the end of quote from the IG re-
port. 
The 
IG 
also 
found 
that 
Mr. 
Mayorkas’s actions ‘‘created an ap-
pearance of favoritism and special ac-
cess’’ in some EB–5 adjudication mat-
ters and that he ‘‘created specific proc-
esses and revised existing policies in 
the EB–5 program to accommodate spe-
cific parties.’’ 
In addition to the case involving Mr. 
Rodham’s company, other cases re-
viewed by the inspector general in-
volved well-connected Democrats, in-
cluding former Pennsylvania Governor 
Ed Rendell and then-Senate Majority 
Leader Harry Reid. 
In each of the cases reviewed by the 
inspector general where Mr. Mayorkas 
had intervened, the IG found that ‘‘but 
for Mr. Mayorkas’s intervention, the 
matter would have been decided dif-
ferently.’’ 
Witnesses were also fearful, and some 
only spoke to the IG after being as-
sured of anonymity. One whistleblower 
told my office they were extremely un-
comfortable in meetings with Mr. 
Mayorkas. 
Mr. Mayorkas’s actions raised seri-
ous concerns in 2013 when he was nomi-
nated to serve as Deputy Secretary of 
Homeland Security during President 
Obama’s second term. It is why he 
couldn’t be confirmed to that role until 
after then-Majority Leader Harry Reid 
invoked the nuclear option on nomina-
tions. Not a single Republican Senator 
was willing to support his confirmation 
then, and no Senator should support it 
at this time.

January 28, 2021 
Finally, I am concerned that Mr. 
Mayorkas did not seem to express any 
regret whatsoever for his previous ac-
tions during his recent confirmation 
hearing before the Homeland Security 
Committee. Instead, he appeared to 
take the view that interfering in EB–5 
cases on behalf of well-connected poli-
ticians and stakeholders was somehow 
the same as casework help offered to 
Americans who experienced problems 
with the international adoption sys-
tems. It was a baffling comparison. 
Now, every one of us Senators knows 
that when a nominee for the Cabinet or 
Subcabinet comes before our com-
mittee, they are always asked ques-
tions by Senators—for sure, I do it: 
Will you respond to our oversight let-
ters, phone calls, or appearing before 
our committee? And every one of them 
says yes, but not every one of them— 
how would you say it? Not every one of 
them keeps their word, I guess is what 
I should say. So I suggest to them, if 
you really want to be honest to take 
that oath to answer in an honest fash-
ion, maybe when you have that ques-
tion asked, ‘‘Will you respond to re-
quests from committee members in our 
oversight work?’’ you ought to say 
‘‘maybe’’ instead of saying ‘‘yes.’’ 
Anyway, I think it is very clear that 
I strongly oppose Mr. Mayorkas’s con-
firmation, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to reject it as well. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

f 
ABORTION 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, tomor-
row is the 48th annual March for Life. 
Although this year’s march will pri-
marily be virtual, the importance of 
standing together to protect the un-
born, the most vulnerable, and all life, 
is as important now as it has ever been. 
Forty-eight years ago, our country 
started down a dark path. Forty-eight 
years ago, the Supreme Court trag-
ically ruled in Roe v. Wade, and since 
then, we have lost the lives of 62 mil-
lion people—62 million and counting— 
unborn babies, precious lives, by abor-
tion. 
I believe every human being is born 
with God-given dignity and potential. 
No court, no legislature, no law can 
take that away. Nevertheless, today, 
babies with Down syndrome are the 
most endangered on Earth. 
For me, this is very personal. Just 
under 3 years ago, our world was 
blessed with a sweet baby boy named 
Andrew. He has Down’s. His parents are 
very close friends. Andrew is a true 
joy, and his family celebrates his life 
every single day. Our world truly 
would not be the same without him. 
But in the United States, 67 percent— 
67 percent—of babies diagnosed with 
Down syndrome are aborted, two out of 
three. For every person with Down syn-
drome alive today that you know or 
you meet—our friends, our family 
members, loved ones—two more are 
gone from this world because of abor-
tion. This is chilling. 
In Europe, the numbers are even 
worse. In fact, in Iceland, because of 
abortion, the population of individuals 
with Down syndrome is virtually being 
eradicated. As prenatal screenings in-
crease in availability, mothers fre-
quently learn before birth if their baby 
has Down syndrome. Rather than giv-
ing supportive resources, these vulner-
able moms are often pressured to abort 
the baby. We all too often hear of a 
false compassion that it would be bet-
ter for unborn babies with Down Syn-
drome or other disabilities to not be 
brought into this world rather than 
live a life that might be different from 
other children. But that is not who we 
are as Americans. 
I am deeply concerned that for babies 
born with Down syndrome, abortion 
has become ‘‘a tool of modern day eu-
genics,’’ as Supreme Court Justice 
Clarence Thomas has said. It pains me 
to think about it. 
But we can’t just think about this 
pain and the pain that it causes. We 
have to do something. We have to pro-
tect those precious lives at all costs. It 
is the duty of this body to end this in-
justice. That is why I am joining my 
colleague 
from 
Oklahoma, 
Senator 
INHOFE, in introducing the Protecting 
Individuals with Down Syndrome Act, 
which will prohibit abortions that are 
sought because of a diagnosis that an 
unborn child has or may have Down 
syndrome. 
This effort has the overwhelming 
support of the American public. In fact, 
just yesterday, a new Knights of Co-
lumbus-Marist poll found that 70 per-
cent of Americans oppose aborting a 
child on the basis that the child will be 
born with Down syndrome—70 percent. 
In fact, that includes over half of those 
who identify as pro-choice. 
This issue also sadly exposes a ter-
rible hypocrisy we are seeing among 
supporters of abortion on demand. In 
fact, today, most Republicans and 
Democrats here in Congress are unified 
in their support for the Special Olym-
pics and for protecting individuals with 
disabilities. Yet many of my colleagues 
across the aisle will oppose this com-
monsense legislation to stop the most 
lethal kind of discrimination imag-
inable, and that is being singled out 
and brutally killed because of a Down 
syndrome diagnosis. It is shameful. 
As Henry Hyde famously said: ‘‘The 
promise of America is not just for the 
privileged, the planned and the per-
fect.’’ 
It is our duty to protect every inno-
cent life, no matter how small, no mat-
ter how many chromosomes they may 
have.

f 
NOMINATION OF ALEJANDRO 
NICHOLAS MAYORKAS 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I stand 
before you and my colleagues today to 
speak in support of the nomination of 
Alejandro Mayorkas to serve as Sec-
retary of the Department of Homeland 
Security. 
There 
is 
no 
question 
that 
Ali 
Mayorkas is qualified for this position. 
He previously served as the Director of 
U.S. Customs and Immigration Serv-
ices, then as Deputy Secretary at DHS. 
Today, I want to tell you about Ali 
Mayorkas’s story. I want to tell you 
why he is the right pick for this posi-
tion. And I want to tell you why we can 
achieve what we need to with Mr. 
Mayorkas leading the Department of 
Homeland Security. 
During his hearing before the Senate 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs Committee, my fellow com-
mittee members and I had a chance to 
hear from Mr. Mayorkas and hear his 
family history. 
He told us the harrowing story of his 
family fleeing persecution, traveling to 
a new country in search of freedom, ac-
ceptance, and a safe place to call home. 
During 
the 
Holocaust, 
Mr. 
Mayorkas’s mother lost her paternal 
grandparents and seven of her uncles 
simply for being Jewish—simply be-
cause of the faith they practiced. His 
mother and his maternal grandparents 
fled, but they fled in order to survive. 
But the story of Mr. Mayorkas’s fam-
ily was far from over. His parents fled 
Cuba during Castro’s revolution, bring-
ing Mr. Mayorkas and his sister here to 
the United States in 1960. They came 
here as refugees searching for freedom, 
searching for acceptance, searching for 
safety. 
Ali Mayorkas is an American success 
story. He came here as a child. His 
family made a life here. He pursued an 
education. He dedicated his life to pub-
lic service. He worked hard to give 
back to the Nation that gave his fam-
ily so much. 
And now, Mr. Mayorkas has volun-
teered to serve his country once again.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S192 
January 28, 2021 
In this new role, he will work to keep 
our Nation safe and secure while ensur-
ing that we treat all human beings 
with dignity and respect. 
Under the last Presidential adminis-
tration, we saw unimaginable cruelty— 
family members separated from each 
other, children taken from their moth-
ers’ arms. We saw a total disregard of 
the struggles of refugees facing perse-
cution in their home countries and 
making the heartbreaking choice to 
leave and make the dangerous journey 
to the United States. 
I know that under the leadership of 
Secretary Mayorkas, our Department 
of Homeland Security will strive to up-
hold the values of our Nation. He will 
also bring much needed stability to the 
Department. He will work to reverse 
the cruel and heartless policies of the 
previous administration. He will work 
to protect Dreamers and TPS holders. 
He will work on smart solutions to se-
cure our border. And he will work with 
Congress to finally pass comprehensive 
immigration reform. That is not all he 
will do at the DHS. 
Under Mr. Mayorkas’s leadership, he 
will work to ensure the safety and se-
curity of our homeland—the homeland 
he was brought to as a child, the home-
land that he and his family have made 
their own. I spoke of the persecution 
that Ali Mayorkas’s family faced dur-
ing the Holocaust—a threat of anti- 
Semitism and White supremacy. Well, 
it still persists today, and it is growing 
right here in the United States and ev-
erywhere across the globe. 
Last year, a DHS assessment con-
cluded that ‘‘racially and ethnically 
motivated violent extremists—specifi-
cally white supremacist extremists— 
will remain the most persistent and le-
thal threat in the Homeland.’’ 
We have seen that violent extremism 
in action. We saw it on January 6 in 
this very city against this legislative 
body and in this very Chamber. When I 
asked Ali Mayorkas about this issue 
during our committee hearing, he made 
clear that he understands the threat 
that White supremacy, anti-Semitism, 
and extremism pose to the health of 
our Nation and to the health of our de-
mocracy. 
If we are going to fight hatred and 
violent extremism, we need someone 
leading the charge who understands 
and takes seriously the threat to all 
Americans—the threats to our chil-
dren, to our schools, to our workplaces, 
and to our places of worship. He is 
committed 
to 
addressing 
online 
radicalization and strengthening the 
Nonprofit Security Grant Program to 
ensure that houses of worship and 
other nonprofit organizations are kept 
safe from potential terror attacks. 
So whether it is combating extre-
mism, foreign or domestic terrorism, 
cyber attacks, or adversaries from 
abroad, Mr. Mayorkas expressed a clear 
commitment to keeping our Nation 
safe and is fully prepared and qualified 
to serve as the head of DHS. 
Ali Mayorkas is the right pick to 
lead this Department, and I urge swift 
confirmation so that he can get to 
work immediately for us and our coun-
try. I will vote for Ali Mayorkas, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan.

NOMINATION OF ALEJANDRO 
NICHOLAS MAYORKAS 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of Alejandro Mayorkas’s nomi-
nation to be Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. 
As recent events have shown, our 
country is facing dangerous threats to 
our security and to our national secu-
rity. Violence and domestic terrorism, 
spurred on by White supremacist ide-
ology, anti-government sentiment, and 
conspiracy theories, continue to rise. 
We saw the tragic and deadly result of 
that growing threat right here in the 
Capitol just 3 weeks ago, and just yes-
terday the Department of Homeland 
Security issued a counterterrorism bul-
letin, warning of possible further vio-
lence in the coming weeks. 
Earlier this year, we learned that 
hackers—likely backed by a foreign ad-
versary—carried out the largest cyber 
security breach of our Federal Govern-
ment. We still do not have all of the 
answers on how they were able to infil-
trate our networks or what informa-
tion they have access to. 
All this is happening while we are 
struggling to control a once-in-a-cen-
tury pandemic that has, tragically, 
taken over 425,000 American lives so 
far. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity should be leading a forceful re-
sponse to these complex and significant 
threats and protecting Americans, but 
the Department and its more than 
240,000 employees need a qualified, ex-
perienced, and Senate-confirmed leader 
at the helm—a leader like Alejandro 
Mayorkas. 
Mr. Mayorkas has built an extensive 
national security record throughout 
his career in public service. He has 
been confirmed by the Senate three 
times, including twice for senior roles 
at the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity. Not only did he help lead the 
Obama administration’s successful re-
sponses 
to 
the 
Ebola 
and 
Zika 
epidemics, he also played a critical role 
in protecting the homeland from for-
eign and domestic terrorism, strength-
ened our national cyber security, and 
increased cooperation between the Fed-
eral Government and local law enforce-
ment agencies. 
Not only does he stand ready to lead 
the Department as it tackles serious 
and 
challenging 
national 
security 
threats, Mr. Mayorkas also under-
stands that the Department and its 
mission have a real effect on people 
and their families. His own family’s 
journey to the United States—first 
fleeing Nazi occupation in Eastern Eu-
rope and later immigrating to the 
United States from Cuba—has given 
him a unique perspective on the very 
heart of the Department’s mission— 
something that was certainly lost dur-
ing the previous administration. Mr. 
Mayorkas is uniquely qualified to 
make sure the Department of Home-
land Security is working to protect 
people from all backgrounds, all com-
munities, and all walks of life. 
Mr. Mayorkas has the qualifications, 
the experience, and the record of ac-
complishments to provide steady lead-
ership, to help restore trust in the De-
partment, and to safeguard our na-
tional security. That is why it is no 
surprise that his nomination has been 
endorsed by four former Homeland Se-
curity Secretaries and a former Acting 
Secretary from both Democratic and 
Republican administrations. He also 
has the support of a group of more than 
30 cyber security experts, 34 former 
Homeland Security officials, and mul-
tiple law enforcement organizations, 
including the Fraternal Order of Po-
lice. 
Within this body, there are certainly 
very different views of the role of the 
Federal Government, but one thing I 
think we can all agree on as a top pri-
ority is keeping Americans safe. It is 
our No. 1 job, and that is why I am ask-
ing my colleagues to join me today in 
supporting the confirmation of Mr. 
Mayorkas as Secretary of Homeland 
Security so that he can quickly begin 
the important and essential task of 
working to strengthen our national se-
curity and safeguarding all Americans. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
cloture vote begin immediately. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered.

TRIBUTE TO GARY MUDD 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
American Printing House for the Blind, 
APH, has held a special place in Gary 
Mudd’s life since he was in the sixth 
grade. Over the last three decades, he 
has become one of the leading voices 
and most successful advocates for the 
world’s largest nonprofit creating edu-
cational products for people who are 
blind and visually impaired. Now, Gary 
is closing that book and beginning a 
well-deserved retirement. As he does, I 
would like to offer my congratulations 
and recognize his many contributions 
to APH’s mission and its future. 
As a student, Gary took classes next 
door to APH at the Kentucky School 
for the Blind in Louisville. His text-
books prominently displayed APH’s 
name. His teachers spoke of the organi-
zation with the highest esteem. And at 
night in his dorm room, he could hear 
the churn of the braille printing press-
es. At this early age, Gary was sur-
rounded by the positive difference APH 
could make in a person’s life. 
Of course, his path to APH wasn’t as 
easy as walking next door. Gary got his 
start working in radio. After 4 years, 
he decided he wanted to join the print-
ing house. Anyone who knows Gary 
could tell you that once he set his 
mind on the job, it was only a matter 
of time before a new opportunity be-
came available. To hear him tell it, 
Gary badgered APH’s then-president 
until he got the chance to put his skills 
to work as a marketing associate in 
1986. 
Decades of Gary’s characteristic per-
sistence brought more opportunities 
and new responsibilities. At last, he 
got the chance to steer the organiza-
tion as its vice president of govern-
ment and community affairs. Through 
books, tactile educational products, 
and ever improving technologies, Gary 
helped APH drive inclusion and help 
students and adults achieve success. 
At every step, Gary has continued 
learning 
and 
adapting 
to 
advance 
APH’s mission. He has built strong re-
lationships with educational experts 
and community leaders. In 2011, he 
even had the chance to join Dolly 
Parton on stage as they announced a 
partnership with the music icon’s 
Imagination Library. 
I have had the pleasure of working 
closely with Gary to deliver hundreds 
of millions of Federal dollars to help 
APH serve people throughout the coun-
try. On Capitol Hill, Gary’s loyal guide 
dogs, Heathcliff and Denver, are prob-
ably as well-known and admired as he 
is. With a gentle nature and a passion 
for his work, Gary has made friends 
and allies throughout Washington who 
are eager to support APH’s inspiring 
work. 
Gary has a lot of plans for his retire-
ment, but they don’t include slowing 
down. He looks forward to pursuing 
passions like biking around Louisville, 
reading the books on his shelf, and 
maybe even going back to school. His 
first goal is to spend more time with 
his wife, Susan, their daughters and 
their grandchildren. He has earned 
every minute of it. I encourage my 
Senate colleagues to join me in thank-
ing Gary for his leadership in Ken-
tucky and to send him into retirement 
with our best wishes.

REMEMBERING BARBARA A. 
O’MALLEY 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to a beloved 
figure in the Senate community, the 
late Barbara A. O’Malley, who passed 
away on January 6. 
For three decades, Mrs. O worked in 
the office of our former colleague, Sen-
ator Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. 
She ran the front desk, which means I 
had the pleasure of seeing her regularly 
on the way to and from my nearby of-
fice. Especially in the mornings, she 
and I would chat about the news, the 
Senate, our families, and whatever 
else. She always greeted me with tre-
mendous affection and kindness and 
baked some of the most delicious cook-
ies I and my staff have ever had. We 
will miss her greatly. 
Mrs. O deeply loved her family. She 
was married to her husband, Thomas 
Martin, for 52 years until his death in 
2006. Together, they had six children: 
Peter, Paul, Patrick, Martin, Eileen, 
and Bridgett; 15 grandchildren; and 8 
great-grandchildren. 
She also loved airplanes. While still 
in high school, she was among the first 
women to volunteer for the Civil Air 
Patrol during World War II, earning 
her pilot’s license and taking to the 
skies. Later in life, she volunteered at 
the Smithsonian Air and Space Mu-
seum to bring her love for aircraft and 
flight to all those who visited. 
The saying goes, if you want a friend 
in Washington, get a dog. Mrs. O 
proved that wrong. She treated every-
one with good will and offered an im-
portant example of friendship to Sen-
ators and staff alike. Mrs. O lived her 
life in service to her Catholic faith, to 
her beloved State of Maryland, and to 
the Senate. I am proud to have called 
her a friend.

REMEMBERING SHIRLEY

Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today

Justice Shirley Abrahamson, who died

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S194 
January 28, 2021 
on December 19, 2020, at the age of 87. 
Justice Abrahamson was a consum-
mate public servant who was passion-
ately driven by the principle of fairness 
when applying the law and serving the 
people of Wisconsin. Her unparalleled 
commitment to judicial independence 
and justice had an immeasurable im-
pact on Wisconsin’s judicial system 
and the countless women and men who 
have been inspired to work in public 
service by her leadership. She was the 
first woman to serve on the Wisconsin 
Supreme Court and the first woman to 
serve as chief justice, but her legacy is 
even richer than those exceptional ac-
complishments. 
Justice Abrahamson’s life had mod-
est beginnings in New York City in 
1933, as the child of Polish immigrants. 
Her passion for the law started at the 
tender age of 6, when she decided she 
wanted to become a lawyer. Those who 
knew her at all stages of life—from 
childhood to retirement—consistently 
commented on her thirst for learning. 
She was a voracious reader even at a 
very young age and a dedicated stu-
dent, earning honors in high school and 
college. 
Justice 
Abrahamson 
graduated 
magna cum laude with a bachelor’s de-
gree from New York University in 1953. 
She earned a law degree with high dis-
tinction from Indiana University in 
1956 and a doctor of law in American 
Legal History from the University of 
Wisconsin Law School in 1962. Justice 
Abrahamson began her career as a 
practicing attorney and distinguished 
professor at the University of Wis-
consin Law School. 
Justice Abrahamson’s career is an in-
spiration to all women who are fight-
ing forces that tell them they don’t be-
long because of their gender. She faced 
significant discrimination when she en-
tered the legal profession in the 1950s. 
From being denied employment at a 
law firm after graduating first in her 
class at Indiana University, to the de-
nial of jobs, clients, and even social 
club memberships because of her gen-
der, Justice Abrahamson remained un-
daunted by prejudice. She refused to 
back down from those who stood in the 
way of a woman’s path to success in 
the legal profession. She carried that 
steadfast commitment to fairness and 
equality in her work on the court. 
In 1976, Justice Abrahamson broke 
the glass ceiling in Wisconsin’s judicial 
system by becoming the first female 
justice on the Wisconsin Supreme 
Court. She again changed the judicial 
landscape in 1996 when she became the 
first woman to serve as chief justice. 
For the chief, serving on the supreme 
court meant serving the people of Wis-
consin as an independent, fair, and im-
partial justice because, after all, the 
court and our court system belong to 
the people, not powerful special inter-
ests. That is why she spent a lot of her 
time traveling the State, meeting with 
people. Whether it was meeting with 
local judges, riding along with local 
law enforcement, or meeting with ad-
vocates for victims of sexual assault 
and domestic violence, she always un-
derstood that you can’t serve the peo-
ple if you don’t walk in their shoes. 
That is why the people of Wisconsin 
elected her to the supreme court four 
times and she served 43 years on the 
court—serving the people. 
The late Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg said Justice Abrahamson was 
‘‘most courageous and sage, and ever 
mindful of the people—all the people— 
that the law exists or should exist to 
serve.’’ 
Justice Abrahamson was cherished 
and respected as a mentor, teacher, ad-
vocate, wife, mother, grandmother and 
friend. She was known for her strong 
work ethic, often the last person work-
ing at night at the State capitol pre-
paring for a case. Even as she faced 
pancreatic cancer at the end of her last 
term on the State supreme court, Jus-
tice Abrahamson fearlessly continued 
working, noting, ‘‘On any day in this 
state, more than a quarter-million peo-
ple are facing a cancer diagnosis.’’ She 
tried to make the law more accessible 
and understandable to clients and the 
general public and brought a caring 
perspective to her professional and per-
sonal interactions. Her passion was 
also seen outside of the courtroom in 
her travels and treasured relationships 
with family and friends. 
Justice 
Abrahamson 
was 
a 
true 
American hero. From her incomparable 
tenure 
on 
the 
Wisconsin 
Supreme 
Court to her efforts as a pioneer for 
gender equality, Justice Abrahamson 
lived a life devoted to service and jus-
tice for all. Her greatest legacy is the 
trail she blazed for countless young 
women, who can see themselves in a 
courtroom or on a judicial bench be-
cause of the barriers she fearlessly 
broke through. She will shine in Wis-
consin’s history as one of the most in-
fluential women who shaped not only 
our judicial institutions but the State 
as a whole.

TRIBUTE TO NEIL HEINEN 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today 
I rise to honor Neil Heinen, editorial 
director for WISC-TV and Madison 
Magazine, on his retirement. Through-
out his remarkable career, Neil has 
been steadfast in his commitment to 
fair and honest reporting, clear-headed 
editorials and fascinating stories about 
the community he loves. 
Born in Milwaukee, WI as the oldest 
of 11 children, Neil first attended St. 
Norbert College in Green Bay in 1969. 
He dropped out to spend 4 years work-
ing in a mental hospital, where he said 
he received his real education. He 
worked as a bartender and actor in 
Madison before deciding to study jour-
nalism at the University of Wisconsin- 
Madison. He began his career at WIBA 
radio station, spending 10 years on the 
air before joining the team at WISC-TV 
News as a news assignment editor. 
It was there that Neil worked with 
longtime station manager Tom Bier to 
create an editorial director job just as 
most stations were eliminating their 
editorial departments. Neil delivered 
more than 7,400 on-air editorials since 
he first conveyed the station’s views in 
April of 1992. He also hosted a Sunday 
morning public affairs program, ‘‘For 
the Record,’’ that ran 1,500 episodes 
over 30 years. 
Perhaps Neil’s greatest legacy is his 
leadership in guiding the growth and 
creativity of Madison Magazine, which 
won countless awards for providing its 
nearly 170,000 readers with interesting 
coverage of local people, entertain-
ment, and issues. Neil’s contributions 
included monthly columns on issues of 
importance 
to 
Madisonians 
and 
a 
monthly food column he coauthored 
with his wife, Nancy Christy. Madison 
readers particularly enjoyed his cover 
stories focused on leadership and vi-
sions for Madison’s future. 
Neil has been a familiar and trusted 
voice in many of Madison’s most im-
portant events and controversial issues 
for the past 30 years. He is known for 
his 
support 
of 
major 
community 
projects such as the Monona Terrace 
Convention Center, the UW-Madison 
Kohl Center and Overture Center for 
the Arts. He helped launch We the Peo-
ple/Wisconsin, one of the most success-
ful civic journalism projects in the 
country in the 1990s, and worked to 
start Schools of Hope, an initiative to 
help close the achievement gap in 
Madison schools. 
While Neil’s last day of work was this 
past September 15, I know he will re-
main active in the community for 
many years to come, lending his voice 
to complex community conversations 
and championing causes that bring us 
together. I will be forever grateful for 
Neil’s commitment to the Madison 
community and for offering his wise 
perspective in critical times.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DALE HANKINS 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Dale Hankins of Chouteau County for 
volunteering countless hours to sup-
port his fellow veterans. 
When Dale was 10 years old, a friend 
of his father, a WWII vet, carried a dia-
mond willow cane. Dale was so in-
trigued by the way the diamonds stood 
out, he couldn’t take his eyes off of it. 
At the age of 17, he made his first at-
tempt at carving a cane, and soon real-
ized and appreciated the effort it took 
to create such beautiful craftsmanship. 
By the time he finished, his hands were 
so full of blisters he decided to pursue 
other hobbies. 
Dale later joined the U.S. Army and 
served in Charlie Company, 160th Spe-
cial Operations Aviation Regiment, as 
an airborne infantry soldier. After re-
ceiving his honorable discharge, he re-
turned to Montana and joined the Mon-
tana Army National Guard. Having a

renewed appreciation for the sacrifices 
veterans give, he picked up his hobby 
again in 2007 and began making dia-
mond willow canes for disabled vet-
erans. Each one is unique and personal-
ized for the veteran, and an American 
flag is included on the handle of each 
cane. 
Dale hasn’t stopped since. He invests 
80 hours or more to make each cane 
beautiful and durable, all at no cost to 
the veteran. Veterans across the Na-
tion from Florida to Washington are 
proudly using his gift which has aided 
in their quality of life. 
It is my honor to recognize Dale for 
his efforts to support and appreciate 
our heroes for the sacrifices they have 
made for our great Nation. The com-
passion and commitment of these ex-
traordinary veterans are an inspiration 
to us all.∑

S. 96. A bill to provide for the long- 
term improvement of public school fa-
cilities, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, among the 
many barriers to safely bringing stu-
dents, teachers, and staff back to 
school for in-person instruction is the 
condition of school facilities. A recent 
Government 
Accountability 
Office 
(GAO) report found that over half (54 
percent) of school districts nationwide 
need to update or replace multiple sys-
tems in their schools, such as heating, 
ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), 
or plumbing. These systems are espe-
cially critical to safeguarding public 
health as we combat COVID–19. 
Now is the time to invest in school 
infrastructure. Doing so will improve 
the resilience of our schools, improve 
student learning, reduce carbon emis-
sions, and create jobs. That is why I am 
proud to partner with Chairman SCOTT 
in the House of Representatives in in-
troducing the Reopen and Rebuild 
America’s Schools Act to fix our 
schools. I would like to thank my Sen-
ate colleagues who are joining in this 
effort, 
including 
Senators 
BROWN, 
BOOKER, 
CARDIN, 
CORTEZ
MASTO, 
WHITEHOUSE, MERKLEY, HIRONO, GILLI-
BRAND, VAN
HOLLEN, ROSEN, SMITH, 
MURPHY, SHAHEEN, KLOBUCHAR, LUJA´ N, 
CASEY, DURBIN, WARREN, BLUMENTHAL, 
HASSAN, HEINRICH, DUCKWORTH, COONS, 
LEAHY, and STABENOW. 
Public schools play a vital role in 
every community across the Nation. 
They play a central role in our democ-
racy—educating the next generation, 
serving as polling places for our elec-
tions, hosting community meetings 
and events, and so much more. When 
there is a natural disaster or an emer-
gency, people often gather at their pub-
lic schools for shelter, information, and 
resources. They are essential facilities 
and must be included in any new major 
federal investment in infrastructure. 
Safe, healthy, modern, well-equipped 
schools are also essential for advancing 
student achievement and ensuring that 
the next generation is prepared to meet 
the economic, social, environmental, 
and global challenges our Nation faces. 
Yet, too many of the over 50 million 
students and six million staff who 
learn and work in our public schools 
spend their days in facilities that fail 
to make the grade. In fact, the Amer-
ican Society of Civil Engineers gave 
public school buildings across the 
country an overall grade of D+ in its 
latest report card. The 2016 State of 
Our Schools report found that state 
and local governments spend $46 billion 
less than what is required to update 
and maintain their school facilities. 
States and local communities cannot 
bridge this gap alone, especially when 
many struggle to simply keep teachers 
and staff on the payroll. We know the 
budget shortfalls will hit low-income 
and minority communities the hardest. 
The GAO report found high poverty 
schools were more likely to rely on 
state funding to cover the cost of build-
ing repairs compared to wealthier 
schools, which were more likely to 
fund projects through local property 
taxes. The Federal government can and 
should be a partner in upgrading our 
public school facilities. 
Addressing this need is not only the 
right thing to do for our students; it 
will also give a needed boost to our 
economy, putting people to work in 
family sustaining jobs. According to an 
analysis by the Economic Policy Insti-
tute, every $1 billion spent on con-
struction generates 17,785 jobs. 
The Reopen and Rebuild America’s 
Schools Act of 2021 will create a Fed-
eral-State partnership for school infra-
structure. It will provide, over ten 
years, a total of $130 billion in direct 
grants and school construction bonds 
to help fill the annual gap in school fa-
cility capital needs, while creating 
nearly two million jobs. 
Specifically, the Reopen and Rebuild 
America’s Schools Act will provide $100 
billion in formula funds to states for 
local competitive grants for school re-
pair, 
renovation, 
and 
construction. 
States will focus assistance on commu-
nities with the greatest financial need, 
encourage green construction prac-
tices, and expand access to high-speed 
broadband to ensure that all students 
have access to digital learning. Our 
legislation would also provide $30 bil-
lion for qualified school infrastructure 
bonds (QSIBs), $10 billion each year 
from FY 2022 through FY 2024, and re-
store the Qualified Zone Academy 
Bonds (QZABs) that were eliminated in 
the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
The legislation also eases the matching 
requirements and expands the author-
ity and eligible purposes of QZABs to 
allow local education agencies to con-
struct, rehabilitate, retrofit, or repair 
school facilities. The Reopen and Re-
build America’s Schools Act also sup-
ports American workers by ensuring 
that projects use American-made iron, 
steel, and manufactured products and 
meet labor standards. 
I would like to thank the broad coali-
tion of educators, community organiza-
tions, unions, civil rights advocates, 
and employers that have provided feed-
back and support for this legislation,

and improve our school buildings. I 
urge all of our colleagues to support 
the Reopen and Rebuild America’s 
Schools Act and press for its passage. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN: 
S. 102. A bill to amend the West Los 
Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 to author-
ize the use of certain funds received 
pursuant to leases entered into under 
such Act, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of the ‘‘West 
Los Angeles VA Campus Improvement 
Act,’’ which I introduced today. Rep-
resentative TED LIEU (D–CA) is intro-
ducing companion legislation in the 
House. 
BACKGROUND ON THE WEST LOS ANGELES VA 
CAMPUS 
In 1888, the 388–acre campus that is 
now home to the West Los Angeles VA 
Medical Center was deeded to the fed-
eral government by Arcadia Bandini de 
Stearns Baker and Senator John P. 
Jones in order to establish a home for 
disabled Civil War Veterans. 
Until the 1970s, the land served pri-
marily to house Veterans, and the cam-
pus long represented the largest Vet-
eran housing development in the na-
tion. 
Unfortunately, in 1972, 2,800 Veterans 
living on the West LA VA campus were 
displaced after the Sylmar Earthquake 
caused major damage on campus. Rath-
er than repair the housing units, the 
VA eventually leased portions of the 
property to non-VA tenants. 
Forty years later, homeless Veterans 
and advocates sued the VA for illegally 
leasing facilities on campus and for 
failing to use the property to support 
Veterans, as required by the original 
deed. 
A U.S. District Court subsequently 
ruled that many leases on campus were 
illegal under the terms of the original 
deed, and in 2015, the VA agreed to fa-
cilitate the development of 1,200 hous-
ing units for homeless Veterans on 
campus. 
In 2016, Congress enacted legislation 
that I introduced with Senator Barbara 
Boxer and Congressman TED LIEU, enti-
tled the ‘‘West Los Angeles Leasing 
Act of 2016,’’ to set up an oversight 
framework for the housing develop-
ment and to ensure that lease revenues 
from ongoing leases stayed on campus. 
NEED FOR LEGISLATION 
In 2018, the VA selected a ‘‘Principal 
Developer’’ to complete housing ren-
ovation and construction projects on 
campus, allowing for a more stream-
lined and efficient building process. 
However, the VA has determined that 
current law restricts it from using on- 
campus lease revenues for housing con-
struction, maintenance, or services. 
The VA has determined that clarifying 
language is needed to ensure that funds 
generated on campus can be used for 
these purposes. 
Giving VA the flexibility to use lo-
cally-generated revenue in this way 
could significantly reduce the time it 
takes to get homeless Veterans into 
housing. 
BILL SUMMARY 
The ‘‘West LA VA Campus Improve-
ment Act’’ would explicitly authorize 
the VA to use any funds collected pur-
suant to leases, easements or other use 
agreements at the West LA VA for the 
development of supportive housing and 
services on campus. 
The bill would also increase the time 
period for enhanced use leases on the 
campus from 75 to 99 years. Increasing 
the length of the leases would align 
with other leasing terms the VA has, 
and help reduce the financing costs for 
new housing. 
CONCLUSION 
Last year, the regional homelessness 
count reported that more than 3,900 
Veterans are experiencing homeless-
ness in Los Angeles. It is long past 
time for this land to be returned to its 
intended purpose: to serve as a home 
where Veterans can receive the care 
and treatment they deserve. 
This bill will help move us closer to 
that reality. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. Thank you, Mr. 
President, and I yield the floor. 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, Mr. WYDEN, and 
Mr. SANDERS): 
S. 127. A bill to support library infra-
structure; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
introducing legislation to address the 
decades of underinvestment in our Na-
tion’s libraries by reinstating Federal 
support for library construction. 
Libraries are essential community 
institutions that give the public access 
to information and services that ex-
pand learning and promote economic 
opportunity. When we invest in our li-
braries, we are offering a helping hand 
and hope for the future. During natural 
disasters and economic upheaval, li-
braries offer the resources and informa-
tion that help people get back on their 
feet. As the Rolling Stones’ Keith 
Richards reportedly said, ‘‘The public 
library is the great equalizer.’’ 
Over the last year, COVID–19 and the 
heightened attention to racial and eco-
nomic inequality have made clear that 
investment in our communities should 
be a national priority as we work to 
lift people up and bring the country 
closer together. And that our invest-
ment in infrastructure must encompass 
vital community assets like schools 
and 
libraries 
and 
not 
just 
roads, 
bridges, and highways. 
And while we know libraries are 
more than buildings with books and 
computers, they are still buildings. For 
thirty years, the Federal government 
invested in the physical infrastructure 
of our libraries, but abandoned that 
program in the early 1990s. The inter-
vening years have taken their toll on 
library facilities. Indeed, the average 
library building is now more than 40 
years old and many need large-scale 
improvements and modernization. 
On top of this longstanding under-
investment, the pandemic has forced li-
braries to adapt and innovate to meet 
the evolving needs of their commu-
nities despite limited financial re-
sources. The American Library Asso-
ciation projects billions of dollars in 
losses to libraries over the course of 
the pandemic, at a time when reliance 
on libraries from low-income, under-
served, and Tribal communities is in-
creasing. The pandemic’s outsized im-
pact on vulnerable communities only 
heightens the urgency of investing in 
libraries. 
The Build America’s Libraries Act 
would make $5 billion available over 
three years to support improvements 
to library facilities and invest in new 
library infrastructure to expand the 
reach of library services and programs. 
Priority is given to libraries that dem-
onstrate the greatest need and pre-
dominantly serve underserved or dis-
tressed communities. The legislation 
also places emphasis on projects that 
seek to enhance facility safety, high- 
speed broadband access, accessibility 
for those with disabilities, or energy ef-
ficiency. Library construction funded 
by this legislation will directly boost 
our struggling economy by putting 
Americans to work and strengthening 
the facilities that connect patrons with 
educational and workforce training re-
sources and local economic opportuni-
ties. 
Libraries have always anchored our 
communities, and as such, we should 
ensure their ability to provide critical 
services for years to come. I am pleased 
to be joined by Senators WHITEHOUSE, 
WYDEN, and SANDERS
in introducing 
this bill, which has the support of 
many 
organizations, 
including 
the 
American Library Association; Amer-
ican Indian Library Association; Amer-
ican Institute of Architects; American 
Society of Interior Designers; Associa-
tion of Tribal Archives, Libraries, and 
Museums; Association for Rural & 
Small Libraries; Chief Officers of State 
Library Agencies; Council of State Ar-
chivists; Education Market Associa-
tion; International WELL Building In-
stitute; National Coalition for History; 
National Coalition for Literacy; Na-
tional Digital Inclusion Alliance; Na-
tional Summer Learning Association; 
Schools, Health & Libraries Broadband 
Coalition; and Urban Libraries Council. 
I hope that our colleagues will join us 
in cosponsoring the Build America’s 
Libraries Act and work for its inclu-
sion in any infrastructure package.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S202 
January 28, 2021 
BACKGROUND 
Fueled by climate change, the annual 
Western wildfire season has grown 
longer and more intense. Where the 
threat used to peak between August 
and November, we are now seeing mas-
sive wildfire events earlier in the Sum-
mer and continuing through the end of 
the year. 
Last year alone, California experi-
enced more than 9,600 fires which 
burned more than 4.1 million acres, 
consumed more than 10,000 structures, 
and claimed 33 lives. 
It is imperative that we commit 
enough manpower and resources to 
combat the threat that such dev-
astating wildfire seasons pose to life 
and property. 
Unfortunately, some of our most ex-
perienced Federal firefighters work so 
many overtime hours each year that 
they reach an overtime pay cap and be-
come ineligible for additional overtime 
compensation. Others are forced to pay 
back 
money 
they 
have 
rightfully 
earned fighting wildfires. 
NEED FOR LEGISLATION 
Federal firefighters from the Depart-
ments of Agriculture and the Interior 
are paid on the General Schedule (GS) 
pay scale based on their seniority and 
performance. They make a base salary 
and are paid overtime when they ex-
ceed eight hours a day. 
However, there is an annual premium 
pay cap that limits how many overtime 
hours for which these firefighters can 
be compensated. 
This arbitrary pay cap places an un-
fair expectation on federal fire per-
sonnel to work long hours for less or 
even no pay, and serves as a dangerous 
disincentive to respond to more fire in-
cidents, especially later in the fire sea-
son. California’s worst wildfires often 
occur late in the fire season, further il-
lustrating the problem we face. 
The Forest Service estimates that up 
to 500 senior-level firefighters either 
stop participating or do not request 
pay for hours worked once they reach 
the pay cap. This has a significant neg-
ative impact on federal wildfire re-
sponse capabilities. 
WHAT THE LEGISLATION WOULD DO 
Our bill would create a statutory 
waiver for Federal firefighters respond-
ing to wildfire emergencies to ensure 
they receive fair compensation for all 
overtime hours they work. 
This waiver would apply to Forest 
Service and Department of the Interior 
personnel 
engaged 
in 
emergency 
wildland fire suppression activities. 
CONCLUSION 
For wildland firefighters, working 
long hours in dangerous conditions is 
often considered a necessary part of 
the job. It is crucial that this demand-
ing work be recognized, and that these 
heroes be appropriately compensated 
for the critical service that they per-
form. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. Thank you, Mr. 
President, and I yield the floor.

RESOLUTION 
19—RECOG-
NIZING JANUARY 2021 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL MENTORING MONTH’’ 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. 
BLUNT, Mr. DURBIN, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, 
Mr. MURPHY, Mr. BOOKER, Ms. SMITH, 
Mr. REED, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Mr. BROWN, 
Mr. VAN
HOLLEN, Mr. PETERS, Mr. 
SANDERS, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. INHOFE, Mr. 
BRAUN, Mr. BARRASSO, Mr. LANKFORD, 
and Mrs. CAPITO) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 19 
Whereas the goals of National Mentoring 
Month are to raise awareness of mentoring, 
recruit individuals to mentor, celebrate the 
powerful impact of caring adults who volun-
teer time for the benefit of young people, and 
encourage organizations to engage and inte-
grate quality in mentoring into the efforts of 
the organizations; 
Whereas there are young people across the 
United States who make everyday choices 
that lead to the big decisions in life without 
the guidance and support on which many 
other young people rely; 
Whereas a mentor is a caring, consistent 
presence who devotes time to a young person 
to help that young person discover personal 
strength and achieve the potential of that 
young person; 
Whereas quality mentoring encourages 
positive life and social skills, promotes self- 
esteem, bolsters academic achievement and 
college access, supports career exploration, 
and nurtures youth leadership development; 
Whereas mentoring happens in various set-
tings, including community-based programs, 
elementary and secondary schools, colleges, 
government agencies, religious institutions, 
and the workplace, and in various ways, in-
cluding formal mentoring matches and infor-
mal relationships with teachers, coaches, 
neighbors, faith leaders, and others; 
Whereas mentoring programs have been 
shown to be effective in helping young people 
make positive choices; 
Whereas studies have shown that incor-
porating culture and heritage into men-
toring programs can improve academic out-
comes and increases community engage-
ment, especially for Alaskan Native and 
American Indian youth; 
Whereas young people who meet regularly 
with mentors are 46 percent less likely than 
peers to start using illegal drugs; 
Whereas research shows that young people 
who were at risk for not completing high 
school but who had a mentor were, as com-
pared with similarly situated young people 
without a mentor— 
(1) 55 percent more likely to be enrolled in 
college; 
(2) 81 percent more likely to report partici-
pating regularly in sports or extracurricular 
activities; 
(3) more than twice as likely to say they 
held a leadership position in a club or sports 
team; and 
(4) 78 percent more likely to pay it forward 
by volunteering regularly in the commu-
nities of young people; 
Whereas students who are chronically ab-
sent are more likely to fall behind academi-
cally, and mentoring can play a role in help-
ing young people attend school regularly, as 
research shows that students who meet regu-
larly with a mentor are, as compared with 
the peers of those students— 
(1) 52 percent less likely to skip a full day 
of school; and 
(2) 37 percent less likely to skip a class; 
Whereas youth development experts agree 
that mentoring encourages positive youth 
development and smart daily behaviors, such 
as finishing homework and having healthy 
social interactions, and has a positive im-
pact on the growth and success of a young 
person; 
Whereas mentors help young people set ca-
reer goals and use the personal contacts of 
the mentors to help young people meet in-
dustry professionals and train for and find 
jobs; 
Whereas each of the benefits of mentors de-
scribed in this preamble serves to link youth 
to economic and social opportunity while 
also 
strengthening 
communities 
in 
the 
United States; and 
Whereas, despite those described benefits, 
an estimated 9,000,000 young people in the 
United States feel isolated from meaningful 
connections with adults outside the home, 
constituting a ‘‘mentoring gap’’ that dem-
onstrates a need for collaboration and re-
sources: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes January 2021 as ‘‘National 
Mentoring Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the caring adults who serve 
as staff and volunteers at quality mentoring 
programs and help the young people of the 
United States find inner strength and reach 
their full potential; 
(3) acknowledges that mentoring is bene-
ficial 
because 
mentoring 
supports 
edu-
cational achievement and self-confidence, 
supports young people in setting career goals 
and expanding social capital, reduces juve-
nile delinquency, improves positive personal, 
professional, and academic outcomes, and 
strengthens communities; 
(4) promotes the establishment and expan-
sion of quality mentoring programs across 
the United States to equip young people with 
the tools needed to lead healthy and produc-
tive lives; and 
(5) supports initiatives to close the ‘‘men-
toring gap’’ that exists for the many young 
people in the United States who do not have 
meaningful connections with adults outside 
the home.

SENATE RESOLUTION 21—RAISING 
AWARENESS AND ENCOURAGING 
THE PREVENTION OF STALKING 
BY DESIGNATING JANUARY 2021 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
STALKING 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mr. 
GRASSLEY, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Ms. ERNST, 
Ms. 
HIRONO, 
Mrs. 
BLACKBURN, 
Mr. 
TILLIS, and Mr. CRAPO) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 21 
Whereas approximately 1 in 6 women in the 
United States, at some point during their 
lifetimes, have experienced stalking victim-
ization, during which the women felt very 
fearful or believed that they or someone 
close to them would be harmed or killed; 
Whereas it is estimated that each year be-
tween 6,000,000 and 7,500,000 individuals in the 
United States report that they have been 
victims of stalking; 
Whereas more than 85 percent of victims of 
stalking reported that they had been stalked 
by someone they knew; 
Whereas nearly 70 percent of intimate 
partner stalking victims were threatened 
with physical harm by stalkers; 
Whereas 11 percent of victims of stalking 
reported having been stalked for more than 5 
years; 
Whereas two-thirds of stalkers pursue 
their victims at least once a week; 
Whereas many victims of stalking are 
forced to take drastic measures to protect 
themselves, including relocating, changing 
jobs, or obtaining protection orders; 
Whereas the prevalence of anxiety, insom-
nia, social dysfunction, and severe depres-
sion is much higher among victims of stalk-
ing than the general population; 
Whereas many victims of stalking do not 
report stalking to the police or contact a 
victim service provider, shelter, or hotline; 
Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal 
law and the laws of all 50 States, the District 
of Columbia, and the territories of the 
United States; 
Whereas stalking affects victims of every 
race, age, culture, gender, sexual orienta-
tion, physical and mental ability, and eco-
nomic status; 
Whereas national organizations, local vic-
tim service organizations, campuses, pros-
ecutor’s offices, and police departments 
stand ready to assist victims of stalking and 
are working diligently to develop effective 
and innovative responses to stalking, includ-
ing online stalking; 
Whereas there is a need to improve the re-
sponse of the criminal justice system to 
stalking through more aggressive investiga-
tion and prosecution; 
Whereas there is a need for an increase in 
the availability of victim services across the 
United States, and the services must include 
programs tailored to meet the needs of vic-
tims of stalking; 
Whereas individuals 18 to 24 years old expe-
rience the highest rates of stalking victim-
ization, and a majority of stalking victims 
report their victimization first occurred be-
fore the age of 25; 
Whereas up to 75 percent of women in col-
lege who experience behavior relating to 
stalking experience other forms of victimiza-
tion, including sexual or physical victimiza-
tion; 
Whereas there is a need for an effective re-
sponse to stalking on each campus; 
Whereas 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
has 
heightened the risk of online stalking and 
harassment, particularly among school-aged 
individuals; 
Whereas victim service organizations and 
law enforcement entities have swiftly adapt-
ed to the COVID–19 pandemic in order to 
continue to serve victims of stalking; and 
Whereas the Senate finds that ‘‘National 
Stalking Awareness Month’’ provides an op-
portunity to educate the people of the 
United States about stalking: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates January 2021 as ‘‘National 
Stalking Awareness Month’’; 
(2) applauds the efforts of service providers 
for victims of stalking, police, prosecutors, 
national and community organizations, cam-
puses, and private sector supporters to pro-
mote awareness of stalking; 
(3) encourages policymakers, criminal jus-
tice officials, victim service and human serv-
ice agencies, institutions of higher edu-
cation, and nonprofit organizations to in-
crease awareness of stalking and continue to 
support the availability of services for vic-
tims of stalking; and 
(4) urges national and community organi-
zations, businesses in the private sector, and 
the media to promote awareness of the crime 
of stalking through ‘‘National Stalking 
Awareness Month’’.

Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
RISCH, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. 
KAINE, and Mr. CRUZ) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 22 
Whereas the United States and Ecuador 
have enjoyed a history of bilateral partner-
ship and cooperation, and share the aims of 
promoting 
democratic 
values, 
economic 
prosperity, and the security of both nations; 
Whereas the United States and Ecuador 
have taken important steps to restore the bi-
lateral relationship between the United 
States and Ecuador, including by signing 
various agreements to strengthen economic 
ties, security cooperation, and development 
opportunities; 
Whereas President Moreno has signaled Ec-
uador’s commitment to promoting demo-
cratic values and has advocated for greater 
government transparency; 
Whereas in February 2018, more than 64 
percent of Ecuadorians voted, in a constitu-
tional referendum, to reinstate a 2-term 
presidential limit, an effort that was carried 
out by President Moreno’s administration 
and which is indicative of the Ecuadorian 
people’s support for presidential term limits 
as a reasonable check against a history of 
corruption and abuse of power; 
Whereas the United States-Ecuador bilat-
eral relationship has been historically char-
acterized by strong commercial and invest-
ment ties through the Generalized System of 
Preferences, 
the 
United 
States-Ecuador 
Trade and Investment Council, and the Trea-
ty between the United States of America and 
the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the En-
couragement and Reciprocal Protection of 
Investment, done at Washington August 27, 
1993, which was terminated by Ecuador’s pre-
vious government, effective May 18, 2018; 
Whereas President Moreno’s administra-
tion has committed to implement economic 
policies that will lay the groundwork for sus-
tainable economic growth, while protecting 
the poorest and most vulnerable people; 
Whereas, under President Moreno’s leader-
ship, there have been significant advances in 
areas related to freedom of expression, in-
cluding through the reform of the controver-
sial Ecuadorian Communications Law; 
Whereas the Government of Ecuador has 
called for the peaceful restoration of democ-
racy and the rule of law in Venezuela and Ec-
uador has been a generous host of approxi-
mately 385,000 Venezuelan refugees; 
Whereas on May 15, 2019, the United States 
Agency 
for 
International 
Development 
(USAID) and Ecuador’s Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Human Mobility signed a Memo-
randum of Understanding agreeing to the re-
turn of the USAID Mission to Ecuador after 
the 53-year program was forced to close in 
2014 due to tensions in the bilateral relation-
ship; 
Whereas Ecuador has been one of the coun-
tries most affected by the COVID–19 pan-
demic in Latin America, which has over-
whelmed the country’s health care system 
and aggravated the country’s already chal-
lenging economic situation; 
Whereas in response to the COVID–19 pan-
demic, USAID is providing Ecuador with 
technical 
support 
and 
training 
in 
diagnostics, and technical assistance in clin-
ical management, risk communication, and 
community engagement; and 
Whereas the United States and Ecuador 
have agreed to advance security cooperation 
on 
law 
enforcement, 
counternarcotics, 
anticorruption, and bilateral military train-
ing and assistance: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms its commitment— 
(A) to the historic partnership between the 
United States and Ecuador; and 
(B) to continue working to strengthen the 
relationship between the United States and 
Ecuador based on mutual respect and shared 
democratic values and principles; 
(2) recognizes President Lenin Moreno and 
his administration for recommitting Ecua-
dor to democratic values, anti-corruption ef-
forts, and the adoption of economic policies 
that will benefit the people of Ecuador; 
(3) commends the important steps that 
President Moreno and his administration 
have taken to protect freedom of expression 
and freedom of the press in his country; 
(4) encourages the Republic of Ecuador to 
ensure that the rights of refugees and asy-

(5) supports actions to strengthen the his-
toric bilateral relationship between the 
United States and Ecuador, including— 
(A) by strengthening economic relation-
ships with Ecuador to build mutual pros-
perity through greater transparency, adher-
ence to the rule of law, and support for 
human rights; 
(B) stronger law enforcement and security

young age, including from the stands while 
playing in the South as a minor league base-
ball player early in his baseball career;

reer as a teenager in the Negro leagues, first 
playing for the Prichard Athletics, then the 
Mobile Black Bears, before being signed by 
the Indianapolis Clowns of the Negro Amer-
ican League; 
Whereas, in 1952, Mr. Aaron was signed by

Star team and was unanimously named 
Rookie of the Year; 
Whereas, in 1953, Mr. Aaron was promoted 
to play for the South Atlantic League affil-
iate of the Braves, the Jacksonville Braves,

the league championship and won the South 
Atlantic League’s Most Valuable Player 
Award; 
Whereas, in 1954, Mr. Aaron was invited to 
attend spring training with the Milwaukee 
Braves and signed his first Major League 
Baseball contract on the final day of Braves 
spring training, making his Major League 
Baseball debut against the Cincinnati Reds 
and hitting his first Major League Baseball 
home run on April 23, 1954; 
Whereas Mr. Aaron won his first batting 
title in 1956 and was voted the National 
League’s Most Valuable Player in 1957, help-
ing the Braves win their first pennant in Mil-
waukee and leading the Braves to a 1957 
World Series victory against the New York 
Yankees; 
Whereas, in 1966, Mr. Aaron moved with

Babe Ruth’s home run record by hitting 
home run number 714 in a game against the 
Cincinnati Reds on his first swing of the sea-

Whereas, on the evening of April 8, 1974, 
Mr. Aaron made history by breaking Babe 
Ruth’s record when he hit home run number 
715 against the Los Angeles Dodgers at At-
lanta-Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, 
Georgia, cementing his place in history as 
the Nation’s home run king; 
Whereas, during the historic moment, vet-
eran baseball broadcaster Vin Scully an-
nounced, ‘‘What a marvelous moment for 
baseball. What a marvelous moment for At-
lanta and the State of Georgia. What a mar-
velous moment for the country and the 
world. A Black man is getting a standing 
ovation in the Deep South for breaking a 
record of an all-time baseball idol.’’; 
Whereas Mr. Aaron went on to hit 755 home 
runs in his career, a home run record that 
went unbroken for more than 30 years, with

(5) being voted an All-Star in all but his 
first and last seasons; and 
(6) winning 3 Gold Glove awards for his 
play as a right fielder; 
Whereas Mr. Aaron achieved these mile-
stones while bravely facing racism at every 
stage of his historic career, including being 
barred from hotels where his minor league 
white teammates stayed, receiving many 
racist letters and threats, and even needing 
protection from law enforcement at games 
to protect against racist violence or harass-
ment; 
Whereas during his career Mr. Aaron be-
came a national symbol for perseverance by 
demonstrating

Whereas, on the 25th anniversary of Mr. 
Aaron’s 715th home run, Major League Base-
ball created the Hank Aaron Award, given 
annually to the players with the best overall

Whereas the democracy of the United

that all people are created equal, endowed by 
the Creator with certain inalienable rights, 
including life, liberty, and the pursuit of

Whereas the freedom of conscience was

Church at New London, Connecticut, dated 
February 4, 1809, that ‘‘[n]o provision in our 
Constitution ought to be dearer to man than 
that which protects the rights of conscience 
against the enterprizes of the civil author-
ity’’; 
Whereas the Virginia Statute for Religious 
Freedom was— 
(1) drafted by Thomas Jefferson, who con-
sidered the Virginia Statute for Religious 
Freedom to be one of his greatest achieve-
ments; 
(2) enacted on January 16, 1786; and 
(3) the forerunner to the Free Exercise 
Clause of the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States; 
Whereas section 2(a) of the International 
Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 
6401(a)) states that— 
(1) ‘‘[t]he right to freedom of religion 
undergirds the very origin and existence of 
the United States’’; and 
(2) religious freedom was established by 
the founders of the United States ‘‘in law, as 
a fundamental right and as a pillar of our 
Nation’’; 
Whereas the role of religion in society and 
public life in the United States has a long 
and robust tradition; 
Whereas individuals who have studied the 
democracy of the United States from an 
international perspective, such as Alexis de 
Tocqueville, have noted that religion plays a 
central role in preserving the Government of 
the United States because religion provides 
the moral base required for democracy to 
succeed; 
Whereas, in Town of Greece v. Galloway, 
134 S. Ct. 1811 (2014), the Supreme Court of 
the United States affirmed that ‘‘people of 
many faiths may be united in a community 
of tolerance and devotion’’; 
Whereas the principle of religious freedom 
‘‘has guided our Nation forward’’, as ex-
pressed by the 44th President of the United 
States in a Presidential proclamation on Re-
ligious Freedom Day in 2011, and freedom of 
religion ‘‘is a universal human right to be 
protected here at home and across the 
globe’’, as expressed by that President of the 
United States on Religious Freedom Day in 
2013; 
Whereas ‘‘[f]reedom of religion is a funda-
mental human right that must be upheld by 
every nation and guaranteed by every gov-
ernment’’, as expressed by the 42nd President 
of the United States in a Presidential procla-
mation on Religious Freedom Day in 1999; 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States protects— 
(1) the right of individuals to freely express 
and act on the religious beliefs of those indi-
viduals; and 
(2) individuals from coercion to profess or 
act on a religious belief to which those indi-
viduals do not adhere; 
Whereas ‘‘our laws and institutions should 
not impede or hinder but rather should pro-
tect and preserve fundamental religious lib-
erties’’, as expressed by the 42nd President of 
the United States in remarks accompanying 
the signing of the Religious Freedom Res-
toration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.); 
Whereas, for countless people of the United 
States, faith is an integral part of every as-
pect of daily life and is not limited to the 
homes, houses of worship, or doctrinal creeds 
of those individuals; 
Whereas ‘‘religious faith has inspired many 
of our fellow citizens to help build a better 
Nation’’ in which ‘‘people of faith continue 
to wage a determined campaign to meet 
needs and fight suffering’’, as expressed by 
the 43rd President of the United States in a 
Presidential proclamation on Religious Free-
dom Day in 2003; 
Whereas, ‘‘[f]rom its birth to this day, the 
United States has prized this legacy of reli-
gious freedom and honored this heritage by 
standing for religious freedom and offering 
refuge to those suffering religious persecu-
tion’’, as noted in section 2(a) of the Inter-
national Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 
U.S.C. 6401(a)); 
Whereas Thomas Jefferson wrote— 
(1) in 1798 that each right encompassed in 
the First Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States is dependent on the other 
rights described in that Amendment, ‘‘there-
by guarding in the same sentence, and under 
the same words, the freedom of religion, of 
speech, and of the press: insomuch, that 
whatever violated either, throws down the 
sanctuary which covers the others’’; and 
(2) in 1822 that the constitutional freedom 
of religion is ‘‘the most inalienable and sa-
cred of all human rights’’; 
Whereas religious freedom ‘‘has been inte-
gral to the preservation and development of 
the United States’’, and ‘‘the free exercise of 
religion goes hand in hand with the preserva-
tion of our other rights’’, as expressed by the 
41st President of the United States in a Pres-
idential proclamation on Religious Freedom 
Day in 1993; and 
Whereas we ‘‘continue to proclaim the fun-
damental right of all peoples to believe and 
worship according to their own conscience, 
to affirm their beliefs openly and freely, and 
to practice their faith without fear or in-
timidation’’, as expressed by the 42nd Presi-
dent of the United States in a Presidential 
proclamation on Religious Freedom Day in 
1998: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) on Religious Freedom Day on January 
16, 2021, honors the 235th anniversary of the 
enactment of the Virginia Statute for Reli-

SAFE FROM THE START ACT OF 
2021 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the reintroduction of the Safe from 
the Start Act of 2021. This bill will reduce 
incidences of gender-based violence (GBV); 
ensure quality services for survivors from the 
very onset of emergencies through timely and 
effective humanitarian action; and promote 
standards for prevention, mitigation and re-
sponse to such crises. 
The largest flow of refugees in recorded his-
tory are being forced from their home coun-
tries and their time spent displaced has in-
creased from years to generations. Climate 
change continues to spur temporary and per-
manent displacement, as floods and fires de-
stroy homes and livelihoods. 
During times of crisis, GBV increases as 
chaos and tensions within households and 
communities grow. An estimated 1 in 5 
women in conflict settings have experienced 
sexual violence, although numbers are likely 
higher given the barriers associated with dis-
closure. GBV is often used by armed actors 
as an intimidation tactic to exert power and 
control over the opposing side. 
Since the onset of COVID, the impact of the 
virus has increased exposure of women and 
girls to domestic violence, lack of access to 
medicine and telehealth, and disruptions in in-
come. Crises like COVID exacerbate risks for 
GBV, which is exactly what Safe from the 
Start is set up to mitigate. In this moment, 
people around the world are living through 
multiple kinds of emergencies, in some cases 
simultaneously. Gaps in services and humani-
tarian protection frameworks have made it dif-
ficult to adequately prevent GBV in humani-
tarian contexts and mitigate its impact. Hu-
manitarian agencies are often underequipped 
to address GBV specifically or close gaps be-
tween services and accountability that have 
led directly to GBV, such as the exploitation of 
women in exchange for supplies by aid work-
ers. To address this, the humanitarian donor 
community has begun investing in the building 
standards, guidelines, and capacities of hu-
manitarian actors to better respond to the 
needs of women and girls in emergencies. 
The Safe from the Start Act would support 
the State Department and USAID’s ongoing 
work to protect and prevent violence against 
women and girls in humanitarian emergencies 
by codifying it, and providing Congressional 
oversight over its implementation. 
I want to thank my colleagues, Representa-
tives CHRIS STEWART, LOIS FRANKEL, MARIO 
DIAZ-BALART, and CHRISSY HOULAHAN for once 
again leading this bill with me. I urge the rest 
of my colleagues to support this bill and look 
forward to its enactment. 
HONORING BOB LOCKE ON THE 
OCCASION OF HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor my constituent Bob Locke on the oc-
casion of his 90th birthday on January 30, 
2021. This is a momentous occasion. 
Mr. Locke has witnessed so many great 
milestones in American history in his 90 years 
of life, and it is my pleasure to now add his 
name to our country’s history. Bob has served 
his country as a National Guardsmen where 
he eventually earned the rank of Sergeant. 
After his years in the Guard, Bob continued to 
serve his community tirelessly, his hard work 
enabling countless public servants the ability 
to support our fellow citizens. The work Mr. 
Locke has displayed over the past many years 
has not gone unnoticed and in these trying 
times I hope this document begins to thank 
and recognize him. 
On behalf of Indiana’s 5th Congressional 
District, I wish Mr. Locke a happy 90th birth-
day and continued health.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF ANTOINETTE D. PERRY 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
celebration of the 100th birthday of Mrs. Antoi-
nette Delores Perry, of Youngstown, Ohio, 
who was born on February 4, 1921. 
Mrs. Perry was born in Matrice, Italy and 
came to the United States at the age of six. 
She is an alumna of Campbell Memorial High 
School and graduated from the Cleveland 
Metro Hospital School of Nursing. 
On June 26, 1948, Antoinette married the 
love of her life, Mr. Anthony Perry. They 
shared a strong bond, spanning just short of 
69 years of marriage. Mr. Perry passed away 
on June 8, 2017. 
Mrs. Perry is the loving mother of three 
sons, Domenic, John, and Anthony. She is 
also blessed with nine grandchildren, and six 
great grandchildren. 
Antoinette has four siblings, three of which 
have passed, that she dearly misses. She is 
blessed to have her sister, Mrs. Jane 
DeSanto, with her today to celebrate this mile-
stone. 
A proud woman of faith, Mrs. Perry is a 
member of St. Dominic Church in Youngs-
town. With this in mind, it is no wonder why 
Antoinette was called to serve as a nurse for 
many years. 
I send my best wishes and warmest regards 
to Antoinette and her entire family on this mo-
mentous occasion. Mrs. Perry is the mother- 
in-law 
to 
Massillon, 
Ohio 
Mayor 
Kathy 
Catazaro-Perry, whom I am proud to call a 
friend. I ask that my colleagues please join me 
in wishing Antoinette a very happy birthday.

HONORING DICK THORNBURGH 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor an influential and dedicated gentleman 
from Pittsburgh, Richard ‘‘Dick’’ Thornburgh, a 
devoted public official, former U.S. Attorney 
General and the 41st governor of Pennsyl-
vania who died on December 31, 2020 at age 
88. 
Dick Thornburgh dedicated his life and ca-
reer to improving the lives of others through 
public service. Prior to being elected to public 
office, 
Thornburgh 
attended 
Mercersburg 
Academy then Yale University from which he 
obtained an engineering degree in 1954. He 
later received a law degree from the University 
of Pittsburgh School of Law in 1957, where he 
served as an editor of the Law Review. He be-
came a member of the Pittsburgh-based law 
firm Kirkpatrick & Lockhart in 1959. Addition-
ally, Dick was awarded 32 honorary degrees 
from 32 other colleges and universities. 
Dick Thornburgh stands out as an honest, 
reform-minded public leader. He is universally 
regarded as an intelligent and empathetic 
leader. He built his reputation as a crime-bust-
ing federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh and as a 
moderate Republican governor. He is also well 
known for being a champion to those with in-
tellectual disabilities. Both he and his wife 
were active in programs for the disabled. In 
1985, the Thornburgh’s were named ‘‘Family 
of the Year’’ by the Pennsylvania Association 
for Retarded Citizens. As Attorney General, 
Dick was instrumental in the passing of the 
Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990. 
Dick Thornburgh was the first Republican to 
serve two successive terms as governor. He 
was recognized by fellow governors in a 1986 
Newsweek poll as one of the most effective 
big-state governors in the nation. As governor, 
he oversaw the response to the Three Mile Is-
land nuclear power plant accident. His calm 
and steady leadership helped with efforts to 
the partial meltdown at the nuclear power 
plant and played a major role in facilitating 
funding for the cleanup operation. Dick was 
responsible for consolidating all of Pennsylva-
nia’s state-owned colleges and universities 
into the Pennsylvania State System of Higher 
Education. Furthermore, he is credited for cre-
ating the Governor’s Schools, which were pro-
grams for talented and gifted high school stu-
dents. 
In 1988, President Ronald Reagan ap-
pointed Dick Thornburgh as the United States 
Attorney General and held on to that position 
after President George H.W. Bush was inau-
gurated. Thornburgh was sworn into office

after being unanimously confirmed by the 
United States Senate and served three years 
as Attorney General. He was steadfast in his 
pursuit against white-collar crime as the De-
partment of Justice obtained a record number 
of convictions of savings and loan crisis and 
other securities officials, defense contractors 
and corrupt public officials. Dick also estab-
lished strong relations with law enforcement 
agencies around the world to help combat 
drug trafficking, money laundering, terrorism 
and international white-collar crime. 
As an accomplished public leader Dick 
Thornburgh also worked at the international 
level, serving as a consultant to the United 
Nations, the World Bank and the Inter-Amer-
ican Development Bank to combat against 
corruption and fraud. He penned the book 
‘‘Puerto Rico’s Future: A Time to Decide’’ in 
2007, where he argued for a change in the is-
land’s territorial/commonwealth status, and 
concluded it was a relic of colonialism. 
Throughout his career, Dick traveled widely, 
visiting over 40 countries and meeting with 
leaders from Africa, Australia, Canada, China, 
Cambodia, Europe, the Middle East, Japan, 
Ukraine, Taiwan, New Zealand and Central 
and South America. He was a former member 
of the Council on Foreign Relations. 
As evidenced by his historic career Dick 
Thornburgh, dedicated his life to advocating 
and improving the lives of others. He was a 
model public servant. The 3rd Congressional 
District of Pennsylvania extends gratitude to 
Dick Thornburgh for his dedicated support and 
service to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
and mourns with his family and loved ones.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
NA-
TIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFE-
TY BOARD’S WORK TO IMPLE-
MENT POSITIVE TRAIN CONTROL 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I am proud 
to recognize the National Transportation Safe-
ty Board (NTSB) for their work, which spans 
five decades, to implement positive train con-
trol, also known as PTC. 
December 31, 2020, was a significant day 
for railroad safety as all 41 freight and pas-
senger railroads required to meet the deadline 
set by Congress to implement PTC met the 
mandate. This life-saving technology will pre-
vent 
train-to-train 
collisions, 
overspeed 
derailments, incursions into established work 
zones, and the movement of a train through a 
switch left in the wrong position. 
The path to full implementation of PTC was 
long and challenging, and had it not been for 
the NTSB’s persistence and partnership with 
Congress, in particular the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure, PTC may 
never have happened. 
The NTSB’s work on PTC began on August 
20, 1969, when two Penn Central commuter 
trains collided head-on near Darien, Con-
necticut, killing three crewmembers and a pas-
senger and injuring roughly 43 others. After 
conducting an extensive investigation, the 
NTSB 
issued 
its 
first 
PTC-related 
rec-
ommendation. 
Over the next five decades, the NTSB in-
vestigated 154 more PTC-preventable acci-
dents that tragically took the lives of 305 peo-
ple and injured 6,885 others. Several of those 
tragedies gained the public’s attention and 
changed the conversation around PTC, includ-
ing collisions in Chase, Maryland, in 1987, 
Boston, Massachusetts, in 1990, Silver Spring, 
Maryland, in 1996, Placentia, California, in 
2002, Macdona, Texas, in 2005, Graniteville, 
South Carolina, in 2005, and Chatsworth, Cali-
fornia, in 2008. 
In 2007 and 2008, the House and Senate 
were negotiating legislation that would require 
PTC implementation, the Rail Safety Improve-
ment Act of 2008 (RSIA). The tragedy in 
Chatsworth pushed Congress to act and 
brought about final passage of RSIA. But as 
railroads worked to implement PTC after the 
mandate, the NTSB continued to investigate 
accidents that could have been prevented had 
the technology been in place. These include 
the derailment of Amtrak 188 in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania, in 2015, which killed 8 pas-
sengers and injured 185 others, and the over-
speed derailment in DuPont, Washington, in 
2017, which killed 3 passengers and injured 
57 passengers and crewmembers. 
Throughout these tragedies, the NTSB 
pressed on for PTC. The agency believed 
PTC was so important that it included the 
issue on its very first Most Wanted List of 
transportation safety improvements in 1990, 
and it has remained a key focus in their advo-
cacy efforts. 
On December 18, 2020—12 years after 
PTC was mandated—the last railroad required 
to implement PTC, New Jersey Transit, an-
nounced that it had fully implemented the 
safety technology, which meant that all 41 rail-
roads had fully implemented PTC two weeks 
short of the deadline: a tremendous accom-
plishment. 
Without the tireless advocacy of the NTSB 
over the last 50 years, we may not have seen 
the day PTC was fully implemented. I com-
mend all those from the NTSB who fought tire-
lessly to finally achieve fully implemented posi-
tive train control. Their work will save lives.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF DR. GODFREY FONDINKA 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Godfrey 
Fondinka. A beloved member of our commu-
nity, Dr. Fondinka’s life was marked by an un-
wavering commitment to medicine and service 
to others. 
Dr. Fondinka was born in Cameroon, Africa 
where he began a life of distinction. After com-
pleting his medical education in Cameroon, he 
studied hospital management at Technion— 
Israel Institute of Technology. Dr. Fondinka 
then moved to the United States, where he re-
ceived a Master of Public Health from Tulane 
University before completing a residency in 
family medicine at LSU Shreveport in 2003. 
Dr. Fondinka worked tirelessly on behalf of 
his patients and our community. He served as 
an emergency room physician at the Fayette-
ville VA Medical Center until 2010, when he 
founded an urgent care practice in Fayette-
ville, North Carolina. On the frontlines of our 
community’s battle against COVID–19, Dr. 
Fondinka saved countless lives and, to him, 
our nation owes an immeasurable debt. 
Dr. Fondinka passed away on December 
18, 2020, and my thoughts and prayers are 
with his wife, Florence; his children, Tuma, 
Ghinna, Babilla, and Khamali; and all who 
knew and loved him. I join our entire commu-
nity in gratitude as we honor his extraordinary 
life. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring the life and legacy of Dr. Godfrey 
Fondinka.

REMEMBERING COACH JERRY 
JOHNSON 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to Coach Jerry C. Johnson, the 
basketball coach and athletic director at the 
historically Black Lemoyne-Owen College, who 
coached the Magicians to Memphis’ only 
NCAA Championship title in 1975 and died 
Sunday at the age of 102. Coach Johnson 
won 821 games over 46 seasons at LeMoyne- 
Owen, where he also coached swimming and 
track and field, and taught health and physical 
education courses. Many of the students he 
coached and mentored went on to illustrious 
national recognition, including eight who be-
came NBA players. Coach Johnson, who 
came to the college in 1958, was the first 
Black basketball coach to win a Division III na-
tional title and LeMoyne-Owen was the first 
Historically Black College and University to 
win that recognition. The LeMoyne-Owen Ma-
gicians remain the only men’s college basket-
ball program in Tennessee, and the only 
sports program in the city of Memphis, to win 
an NCAA championship. In my own inter-
actions with Coach Johnson, I was always im-
pressed with his quiet demeanor and self-ef-
facing attitude, even though he was as much 
a star in the Memphis basketball world as any-
one. Off the court, he was just a good man, 
caring about people in a quiet and compas-
sionate manner, reaching out to help players, 
former players, and students without regard to 
their athletic ability or gender. He offered a 
helping hand and his heart reached so many. 
Known as strict but fair, Coach Johnson, an 
Oklahoma native, had an unusual connection 
to the game of basketball: he learned it from 
Hall of Famer John McClendon, the former 
Cleveland State coach who served as the first 
Black coach of a professional sports team, 
and McClendon learned the game from James 
Naismith, the inventor of the modem game of 
basketball. Coach Johnson was the focus of a

newly released independent documentary, 
‘‘1st Forgotten Champions,’’ which was di-
rected by Memphian Morreco Coleman and 
covered the 1975 Division III NCAA champion-
ship. The documentary recently premiered in 
California, Nashville and Memphis. Johnson 
was a member of the Memphis Sports Hall of 
Fame, the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, 
the Fayetteville State University Athletics Hall 
of Fame and the Southern Intercollegiate Ath-
letic Conference Hall of Fame. I extend my 
profound condolences to his son, Jerry Jr.; his 
daughter, Wandra Haywood and her husband, 
Samuel, of Gainesville, Florida; his six grand-
children; and his seven great-grandchildren. 
Coach Johnson will be remembered as a 
gentle giant and a gentleman. He led an ex-
emplary life.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MS. 
LISBETH 
(LIZ) 
MCBRIDE-CHAM-
BERS 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge and thank Ms. Lisbeth 
(Liz) McBride-Chambers for thirty years of 
dedicated and compassionate service as a 
member of the Office of Employee Assistance 
(OEA) at the United States House of Rep-
resentatives. 
In an institution where Members are Con-
stitutionally bound to serve terms in two-year 
increments, it is remarkable to note that Liz is 
only the second individual to serve as the 
OEA Director in the organization’s thirty-year 
history. 
Liz joined the OEA team in May 1991 when 
the office was in the early stages of develop-
ment. She was one of the first OEA employ-
ees hired by the beloved first Director, Bern 
Seidel. Through love, passion, and commit-
ment to their profession, Bern and Liz skillfully 
developed the OEA into a preeminent em-
ployee assistance program. 
After Bern’s passing in February 2017, Liz 
was promoted to serve as the Director of our 
OEA team. Through her skillful guidance and 
direction, Liz’s office delivers comprehensive 
confidential services covering an array of per-
sonal and work-related issues to positively im-
pact employee performance, productivity, and 
well-being. 
The OEA team also facilitates staff retreats 
for Member offices and conducts seminars on 
a variety of topics, including employee well- 
being, understanding stress and trauma, en-
hancing communication skills, and managing 
career transitions. 
In 2018, the OEA’s scope expanded when 
Liz was entrusted to launch the House 
Wellness Center. Through her tireless efforts 
and close partnership with key stakeholders, 
the House community now has a comprehen-
sive wellness program that provides assist-
ance, information, and training on all aspects 
of well-being. 
While each of the OEA’s program areas are 
important to the office’s overall success, none 
can surpass the impact that Liz and her team 
have had in response to critical incidents in-
volving the House community. Whether it was 
the aftermath of September 11, 2001, the trag-
ic Congressional baseball shooting on June 
14, 2017, the horrific siege on the Capitol on 
January 6, 2021, or any other critical incident, 
Liz’s commitment and care provided comfort 
to those experiencing profound grief and dis-
tress. In addition to her outstanding contribu-
tions to the House community, Liz’s impact 
has inspired countless waves of professionals 
in the field of employee assistance, As a 
member of the Employee Assistance Profes-
sionals Association (EAPA) for well over thirty 
years, Liz regularly attends and contributes to 
the organization’s world conference, which in-
cludes serving as a chair and member of the 
annual conference program planning com-
mittee. 
Liz also served as Commissioner and Chair 
of the Employee Assistance Certification Com-
mission. In this role, she established, main-
tained, and oversaw the development and 
stewardship of the Certified Employee Assist-
ance Professional (CEAP) examination and 
credentialing processes. 
After completing her tenure in these vital 
roles, Liz continued serving as a volunteer 
trainer for EAPA’s CEAP Exam Preparation 
Course. While it would be impossible to count 
all the lives Liz influenced and touched during 
this process, it goes without saying that her 
impact stretches beyond the counselors she 
helped through these endeavors. 
Every counselor who passed the rigorous 
credentialing and examination process with 
Liz’s guidance and tutelage was granted the 
greatest gift of all; her knowledge and insights, 
which they in turn could pass along to the em-
ployees, organizations, and communities they 
serve across the globe. 
Based on these outstanding contributions, it 
should come as no surprise that Liz has been 
recognized by her peers both inside and out-
side of the House community. In 2007, Liz 
was the recipient of the CAO’s Achieving Ex-
cellence Award. She was recognized as the 
EAPA Member of the Year in 2015. One year 
later, Liz received the Employee Excellence 
Award from the House Officers and Inspector 
General. Finally, in 2020, Liz had the high 
honor of receiving a Lifetime Achievement 
Award from the Congressional Management 
Foundation. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to join those 
who have recognized Liz for her outstanding 
contributions and overall impact to the House 
of Representatives and to the greater em-
ployee assistance community. I also want to 
acknowledge Liz’s entire team: Tiara Ander-
son, Breanna Becker, Daniel Coleman, Briana 
Cragwell, Georgeanna Goldstein, Margot Haw-
kins-Green, Rhonda Kaalund, Malia Klee, Jon 
Murphy, Paul Tewksbury, Emily Swartz, and 
Brian Weiss. This is a very special group of 
employees and they are all commended for 
their commitment, dedication, and profes-
sionalism. 
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to 
recognize and thank Liz McBride for her un-
paralleled service to this great institution.

IN HONOR OF DR. JILL JENSEN 
HON. MIKIE SHERRILL 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my deep gratitude to a de-
parting member of my staff, Jill Jensen. Dr. 
Jill, as she is known in our office, came to 
Capitol Hill as a Brookings Legislative fellow 
from the Department of Defense. We were all 
excited to have someone with her deep exper-
tise and experience as a part of our team, and 
we were looking forward to her contributions 
to my work on the Armed Services Committee. 
As with so many things this year, the pan-
demic upended our plans. In late February 
and early March, as COVID–19 picked up 
speed and congressional offices started to re-
spond, Dr. Jill quickly became an indispen-
sable member of our team. Not only is she an 
expert in defense policy, but Dr. Jill has a doc-
torate in public health. She quickly stepped up 
to the plate to lead our office’s response to the 
pandemic, coordinating weekly calls with local 
health care providers and public health ex-
perts, spearheading the Regional Recovery 
Task Force, and providing invaluable insight 
and advice to me and the other members of 
my team. 
While leading our response efforts during 
the COVID–19 crisis, Dr. Jill still managed to 
be a critical member of our defense team. Her 
ideas and hard work led to several provisions’ 
successful inclusion in the National Defense 
Authorization Act, and now, even as her fel-
lowship in our office winds up, she is still com-
ing up with creative ideas for new and impor-
tant legislation. 
Beyond her expertise, excitement to learn 
about the Hill, and creativity, Dr. Jill is simply 
a joy to work with. She is always positive, at-
tacking new challenges with a smile on her 
face. She is always willing to put her shoulder 
to any task, whether it is drafting new legisla-
tion that will impact the lives of thousands of 
service members or organizing our office suite 
after a move. Her optimism and insight kept 
many of us on track in those first days of the 
pandemic, and her excitement about arcane 
congressional processes was always a breath 
of fresh air. 
Our office’s loss is the Defense Depart-
ment’s gain, and as she ends her fellowship 
and returns to the Department, I wish her the 
very best of luck. I am confident we will be 
saying ‘‘I knew her when . . .’’ very soon.

NATIONAL OFFICE OF NEW 
AMERICANS ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, immigrants 
make up the fabric of our nation. America has 
always been stronger when we embrace and 
assist immigrants in their transition as they 
contribute to our communities, economy, and 
culture. 
In order to ensure a welcoming and inclu-
sive system for new Americans, I am intro-
ducing the National Office of New Americans 
Act. This bill would create an office within the 
Executive Office of the President to assist and 
support new immigrants and refugees in em-
ployment attainment, language access, and 
civic engagement. Furthermore, it would also 
oversee the coordination of efforts by federal, 
state, and local governments to support inte-
gration efforts, such as helping to attain citi-
zenship.

January 28, 2021 
Madam Speaker, this issue is also of per-
sonal importance because when I was a mem-
ber of the New York State Assembly, I had 
envisioned a statewide office to assist new im-
migrants with overcoming these challenges. 
Now, I am expanding that vision to a national 
office and seeking to fix the systemic chal-
lenges immigrants and refugees must face. 
Immigrants make indelible contributions to 
our nation, and it is long past time that we cre-
ate an entity in the Executive Office of the 
President that ensures our country is wel-
coming and helpful toward those who come to 
our shores. While we aspire to be a beacon of 
hope and opportunity, we must match word 
with deed. 
Madam Speaker, we cannot allow immi-
grants to be treated as an afterthought; we 
must ensure their path to becoming ‘‘New 
Americans’’ is clear and well resourced. After 
the atrocious last four years of an administra-
tion that demonized, criminalized, and dehu-
manized immigrants and refugees at every 
turn, my bill would ensure a welcoming and in-
clusive system for all new Americans. I urge 
my colleagues to support this legislation as we 
look to building a more prosperous country 
that recognizes the humanity and dignity of all 
immigrants and refugees.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF PHILADELPHIA INTER-
NATIONAL RECORD 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and celebrate the 50th anniversary of 
the 
legendary 
Philadelphia 
International 
Record (PIR). One of music’s most historic 
record labels. 
Visionary song-writing producers Kenneth 
Gamble and Leon Huff co-founded PIR in 
1971. Together they engineered one of the 
most significant chapters in music history. The 
groundbreaking label gave birth to the sophis-
ticated Philly Soul sound also known as ‘‘The 
Sound of Philadelphia.’’ Patti LaBelle, Teddy 
Pendergrass, The O’Jays, Harold Melvin & the 
Blue Notes, Billy Paul, Lou Rawls and McFad-
den & Whitehead are just some of the stars 
who took the duo’s distinguishing sound to the 
top of the charts. 
The Gamble and Huff partnership began in 
1963, when the two hardworking musicians 
from West Philly and Camden met in the ele-
vator of the Shubert Building, which now 
houses the Merriam Theater. They were both 
toiling as writers for separate music production 
firms. They joined forces and became a potent 
songwriting/production team. The ‘‘Philly Soul’’ 
sound featured a mix of doo-wop, gospel, 
R&B, and sound known for its orchestral 
sounds. 
Philadelphia Soul music is known for its in-
corporation of lush string arrangements along 
with penetrating brass, and often conveys very 
personal and emotional stories. The world-re-
nowned Philadelphia Orchestra’s string section 
was often employed to play on many of Phila-
delphia International Record’s tracks. Philly 
Soul is widely considered a producer’s genre. 
Everyone from the Jacksons to B.B King to 
David Bowie came to Philadelphia seeking 
Philly soul magic. Philadelphia was a center 
for pop music. 
50 years since its inception, Philadelphia 
and the world are poised to celebrate the 
golden anniversary of the label. The anniver-
sary will highlight the extraordinary musical 
output of the storied label and spotlight mile-
stone musical moments, artists and songs 
from the remarkable Philadelphia International 
Records family that have defined the landmark 
label and its incredible impact over the past 50 
years. 
In 2014, Sony Music Entertainment an-
nounced their historic deal with Philadelphia 
International Records, securing global owner-
ship of all recordings made for PIR. The land-
mark deal added all post-1975 PIR recordings 
to the PIR titles already owned by Sony Music 
Entertainment, reuniting the entirety of the 
Philadelphia International Recordings catalog 
under a single global licensing and reissue en-
tity. 
For nearly 30 years, Warner Chappell Music 
has had the privilege of representing Gamble 
and Huff and their legendary music catalog, 
which includes nearly 3000 songs. Their im-
pact on the music industry is immeasurable. 
To celebrate this milestone a flurry of 
projects will showcase the Philadelphia Inter-
national brand and accord Gamble and Huff 
along with key collaborators like their ‘‘Mighty 
Three’’ partner Thom Bell—increased appre-
ciation and respect as 20th century Black 
music pioneers on a par with giants like 
Motown’s Berry Gordy. According to Kenny 
Gamble co-founder of Philadelphia Inter-
national Records ‘‘It’s a blessing to celebrate 
all the writers, musicians, engineers, disc jock-
ey, and all the people that were on our team. 
When I listen to this music now. I can close 
my eyes and the music brings us all back to-
gether again. Hearing this music reminds me 
of all the hard work and dedication our team 
went through to make such a long-lasting 
catalog, that has been embraced by the world 
and I’m thankful.’’ 
I am honored to extend my sincere con-
gratulations to such an outstanding duo and 
celebrate the legacy that is Philadelphia Inter-
national Records and The Sound of Philadel-
phia.

HARRY T. LEWIS, JR. 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Harry T. Lewis, Jr., a long-time 
Denver business and civic leader, who passed 
away on November 11, 2020. 
Harry was born in Cincinnati, Ohio to 
Margretta (Borrmann) and Harry T. Lewis. The 
family moved to Denver when Harry was two 
years old. Harry attended East High School 
and earned his A.B. in Art History from Dart-
mouth College and his M.B.A from the Amos 
Tuck School of Business in 1956. He was 
commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy 
and spent most of his service stationed in 
Honolulu, HI. 
Harry began his career in Denver in 1959 
as a C.P.A and spent the bulk of his career as 
an 
Investment 
Banker 
in 
Denver 
with 
Boettcher & Co. and Dain Bosworth. In 1990, 
he established his own firm, Lewis Invest-
ments. Throughout his life and career, he held 
strong beliefs in the importance of giving back 
to the city and state he loved. He invested 
substantial time and expertise to multiple non- 
profit and civic organizations, guided by his 
viewpoint we should all strive to improve our 
quality of life and better the City of Denver. 
Harry served on numerous community boards 
including the Boettcher Foundation, Colorado 
Outward Bound School, C.S.U. Research 
Foundation, Colorado Forum, Dartmouth As-
sociation of the Great Divide, Denver Museum 
of Nature and Science, Denver Metro Cham-
ber of Commerce, Downtown Denver, Inc. and 
The Stapleton Foundation. In his personal life, 
he was an avid skier and fly fisherman, loved 
fine art, good wine and opera, and was a pas-
sionate gardener. 
Harry Lewis was predeceased by his be-
loved wife, Tanya (deLuise) Lewis (2001) and 
a son, Colin M. Lewis (2016), and is survived 
by his son, Kevin H. Lewis, his daughter Val-
erie Lewis Savoie, and grandchildren Derek 
and Connor Lewis, Isabelle and Duncan Lewis 
and Julia and Cael McCarthy. I appreciate his 
lifetime service to our community.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND PUB-
LIC SERVICE OF BOOTSIE NEAL 
HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to the life of Bootsie Neal, a remarkable 
woman and public servant from my hometown 
of Dayton, Ohio, who passed away on Janu-
ary 24, 2021. 
Bootsie Neal was one of my dearest friends 
for over 25 years. Bootsie was born on Sep-
tember 9, 1952 in Newbern, Alabama and 
grew up in Buffalo, New York. She earned her 
bachelor’s degree from Howard University in 
Washington, D.C. She moved to Dayton in 
1974, where she spent the rest of her life, and 
earned a master’s degree in postgraduate 
education at the University of Dayton. 
In 1991, Bootsie became the first African 
American woman to be elected to the Dayton 
City Commission, on which she served until 
2004. Later in life, she inspired and became a 
role model for other women committed to pub-
lic service and looking to run for office. 
I had the privilege of working with Bootsie 
while I was Mayor of Dayton. Together, we 
worked to turn the city around. We shared a 
mutual interest in urban revitalization and re-
development. We implemented a comprehen-
sive strategic plan that laid the foundation for 
the economic revival of the urban core of our 
region. Our focus was rebuilding the business 
district with jobs, housing, and amenities, and 
restoring and revitalizing our neighborhoods. 
Without Bootsie’s leadership and partner-
ship, we would not have balanced the city’s 
budget for eight consecutive years, built the 
Dayton 
Dragons 
baseball 
stadium, 
the 
Schuster Center, and RiverScape MetroPark, 
All of these projects helped contribute to the 
revitalization and improvement of our city. 
Today, there are more people living, working, 
and enjoying downtown Dayton than there 
were twenty years ago. 
Bootsie will be deeply missed by all of us 
who knew and loved her. I valued her wisdom 
and treasured her friendship. Bootsie’s legacy 
of service through her sorority Delta Sigma 
Theta, as well as to the entire Dayton commu-
nity, will forever be cherished. On behalf of all 
those whose lives were touched by Bootsie’s 
friendship and community service, I offer her 
family and friends my heartfelt condolences.

SPECIAL DISTRICTS PROVIDE 
ESSENTIAL SERVICES ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
reintroduce the ‘‘Special Districts Provide Es-
sential Services Act,’’ at the request of the 
California Special Districts Association and the 
237 special districts within California’s third 
Congressional district. I want to thank my 
original cosponsors for their support of this 
much-needed legislation. I also want to thank 
U.S. Senator KYRSTEN
SINEMA
(D–AZ) for 
sponsoring the companion legislation. 
Special districts are independent units of 
local government that provide public services 
cities and counties do not provide for resi-
dents. Those services include first responders, 
policing, firefighting, public health, and more, 
making special districts critical to the commu-
nities they serve. 
To date, Congress has inadvertently ex-
cluded special districts from the direct federal 
financial assistance provided to state, county, 
and municipal governments during this pan-
demic for essential services. For example, 
special districts are currently ineligible for di-
rect federal financial assistance under the 
‘‘Coronavirus Relief Fund’’ established by the 
CARES Act (Public Law 116–136). 
Our bicameral legislation would ensure that 
the 2,700 special districts in California and 
30,000 special districts nationwide are eligible 
for any additional assistance provided by Con-
gress to state, county, and local governments 
to aid in the fight against COVID–19. 
The ‘‘Special Districts Provide Essential 
Services Act’’ would also allow special districts 
access to the Federal Reserve’s Municipal Li-
quidity Facility, which provides states, coun-
ties, and municipalities federally guaranteed 
bridge financing to offset unexpected short- 
term revenue shortfalls. Like states, counties, 
and cities, many special districts serve large 
populations and have the legal authority to 
issue short-term tax and revenue anticipation 
notes. However, special districts are not cur-
rently guaranteed access to the Municipal Li-
quidity Facility, even to offset revenue short-
falls caused by this ongoing pandemic 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join 
us in cosponsoring the ‘‘Special Districts Pro-
vide Essential Services Act.’’ Congress must 
ensure that all local governments have the 
federal support needed to deliver crucial qual-
ity-of-life services for our communities during 
this global pandemic, including special districts 
nationwide.

HONORING LYLE L. GREEN ON HIS 
RETIREMENT FROM GPO 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, over the 
last few months, we have all come to appre-
ciate the quiet competence of our dedicated 
public servants, without whom none of our 
democratic institutions would work. One such 
public servant, Lyle Green, will be retiring at 
the end of January from his position as the 
managing director of the Official Journals of 
Government (OJG) at the Government Pub-
lishing Office (GPO). In that role, Lyle has 
been responsible for publication of the Federal 
Register, along with every publication from 
Congress, 
including 
the 
Congressional 
Record, the House and Senate calendars, 
bills, hearings, reports, and even the phone di-
rectory. 
Lyle began his career at GPO in 1991 as a 
proofreader, where his colleagues soon recog-
nized his talent and work ethic. Throughout his 
career, he was at the center of GPO’s transi-
tion from a print-centric institution to one that 
leads on the digitization of public information, 
a transformation that has dramatically ex-
panded the accessibility of key public docu-
ments to the American people. When GPO 
talks about its mission of ‘‘Keeping America 
Informed,’’ they are talking about many of the 
products produced by Lyle’s team. 
Lyle has served as Managing Director since 
January of 2012 and prior to that he headed 
OJG’s Congressional Publishing Services for 
five years. In those capacities, he spear-
headed the production of the official materials 
for presidential inaugurations in 2009, 2013, 
and 2017, and led GPO’s team through sev-
eral blizzards, an earthquake, a pandemic, 
and now, regrettably, an attack by insurrec-
tionists. Throughout it all, Lyle and his team 
got it done. Ensuring the timely production of 
the Federal Register and the Congressional 
Record is like having to produce two big-city 
newspapers every day. In addition, Lyle led 
his team through the production of thousand- 
page bills for immediate floor consideration, or 
the production of last-minute credentials for 
important, historic public events. In each case, 
Congress got what it needed—on time and ac-
curate. 
There are generations of staff who always 
knew that if they ran into a problem, they 
could call Lyle at the Congressional Desk at 
GPO and he’d get it straightened out. And he 
always did it with grace and humility. As Lyle 
wraps up work on his fourth presidential inau-
guration, he deserves to be proud of his 30 
years of service to GPO, Congress, and 
American 
democracy. 
As 
chairperson 
of 
GPO’s oversight committee, the Joint Com-
mittee on Printing, I want to express Con-
gress’ gratitude for Lyle’s tireless work on be-
half of our constituents, most of whom will 
never know Lyle’s continuing contributions. 
I wish Lyle lots of time with his family and 
his beloved Washington Nationals secure in 
the knowledge that he made a great and last-
ing contribution to his country. With his retire-
ment at the end of this month, he will leave 
the agency he loves stronger than when he 
found it.

LEE KUTNER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Lee Moss Kutner who 
passed away surrounded by family on Decem-
ber 18, 2020. 
Lee was born in Niagara Falls, New York in 
1955. When he was nine, his family moved to 
Oak Park, Michigan. When in college, Lee’s 
parents later moved to Denver, Colorado. Lee 
graduated from the University of Michigan in 
1976 and then went on to graduate from the 
National Law Center of George Washington 
University in Washington, D.C. in 1980. 
Following his graduation, Lee moved to 
Denver and began as an associate in a law 
practice in 1981, in short time becoming a 
partner. He later became the primary share-
holder in Kutner Brinen, PC where he enjoyed 
37 years practicing corporate reorganization 
and bankruptcy law with his partner and 
friend, Jeff Brinen. Lee pushed the practice of 
bankruptcy law forward, setting precedent, 
speaking at conferences, and publishing chap-
ters in respected legal texts. 
Lee was a beloved and devoted husband of 
38 years and was a loving, father, and grand-
father.

RECOGNITION OF THE 
PENNSYLVANIA NATIONAL GUARD 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the House 
of Representatives to join me in recognizing 
the Pennsylvania National Guard for their tre-
mendous work in Operation Protect D.C. 
Following the horrifying events at the Capitol 
on January 6, 2021, I am thankful for the 
Pennsylvania National Guard activating to 
Washington, D.C. quickly to ensure the presi-
dential inauguration and transfer of power 
could be carried out peacefully. 
Leaving their families and careers in Penn-
sylvania, these men and women stood in the 
cold and rain and slept on floors to selflessly 
protect their fellow Americans. During this 
challenging time, it is inspiring to witness so 
many National Guard Service men and 
women choose to help their fellow Americans. 
Governor Tom Wolf activated an extraor-
dinary 2,400 Soldiers and Airmen in support of 
the District of Columbia’s preparation for the 
59th Presidential Inauguration. Pennsylvania 
has the third largest National Guard in the 
country with approximately 19,000 members 
located in more than 80 armories and readi-
ness centers statewide. We cannot thank 
them enough for their service. 
God Bless our Troops.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
ANTHONY GALLOPO 
HON. JOSH GOTTHEIMER 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of one of the finest North 
Jersey residents I have come to know. An-
thony Gallopo was a dear friend, a leader and 
a role model in Sussex County, and a tireless 
fighter for his brothers and sisters in arms— 
his fellow veterans. 
As we mourn Tony’s loss, our hearts go out 
to his wife, Betsy, and his daughters, Sarah, 
Alexandra, and Ashley Gallopo. He always 
spoke to me about them, how much he loved 
them, and how proud he was of their accom-
plishments. We are all thinking of them as we 
extend our deepest condolences for their ter-
rible loss. At this time, we are also praying for 
the recovery of Tony’s beloved wife, Betsy, 
who remains in the hospital. 
Madam Speaker, getting to know Tony was 
one of the great joys and true honors of my 
career in Congress. I remember when we first 
met, when I visited Sussex County Community 
College for a roundtable with local student vet-
erans. There was no one who knew more 
about what veterans in Sussex and Warren 
needed, or who cared more about how they 
were going to get the attention and care and 
services that they deserved. 
For more than five years, Tony and I 
worked shoulder-to-shoulder to deliver on that 
promise. Tony was instrumental in securing 
the long-awaited goal of the first VA commu-
nity outpatient clinic to serve veterans in Sus-
sex and Warren Counties, so that those who 
fought for our country could access care close 
to home. I was so proud to stand with him and 
others who helped make it happen on the day 
the clinic finally opened in 2017. Tony contin-
ued the fight for lifesaving in-person psy-
chiatric care for veterans at the clinic in New-
ton, hosted roundtables for better jobs and op-
portunities for students and returning veterans, 
and was always there to commemorate and 
remember the sacrifice of generations of his 
fellow servicemembers throughout the Fifth 
District. 
As a leader on our District’s Service Acad-
emy Nomination Selection Committee, he 
helped evaluate young student applicants so 
that I could nominate the very best of the next 
generation to represent North Jersey at our 
nation’s great Service Academies. 
Tony served as a Seaman in the United 
States Navy, and as a former New Jersey De-
partment of the American Legion Vice Com-
mander, member of the Legion’s Department 
Executive Committee, and as Commander of 
Post 86 in Newton. He was also a retired sen-
ior officer with the New Jersey Department of 
Corrections. 
Madam Speaker, we owe our nation’s vet-
erans a deep debt of gratitude; they do not 
owe us anything. And yet, every day, I am in-
spired by veterans like Tony, who always 
wanted to help more people, to give back to 
his community, and to look after other vet-
erans young and old who could use a hand. 
And in doing so, he provided a profound ex-
ample of how to lead a life of service. 
Like so many in North Jersey, I was 
crushed when I heard that tragic news that 
Tony was in the hospital. In New Jersey, we 
have lost so many friends, neighbors, parents, 
and grandparents during the coronavirus pan-
demic. But it is difficult to capture just how 
painful the tragic news of Tony’s passing was 
for all who knew him, but especially for his fel-
low Legionnaires and veterans. 
While Tony is sadly no longer with us, he 
lived a lifetime of service that will never be for-
gotten. North Jersey is deeply indebted to this 
selfless patriot who touched so many lives, 
and a true hometown hero who walked among 
us. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in remembering my friend, Tony Gallopo. 
IN SUPPORT OF THE GABRIELLA 
MILLER KIDS FIRST RESEARCH 
ACT 2.0 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Gabriella Miller Kids First 
Research Act 2.0, which I introduced today. If 
enacted, this bipartisan bill would make great 
strides to fund the fight against childhood can-
cer, birth defects, and other rare childhood 
diseases. 
Cancer is the number one cause of disease- 
related death in children age 14 and younger. 
This year alone, it’s estimated that more than 
10,000 children in the U.S. under the age of 
15 will be diagnosed with cancer. In addition, 
one in 33 babies born in the U.S. are affected 
by a birth defect and birth defects are the 
leading cause of death among infants. Unfor-
tunately, these childhood diseases are still 
poorly understood, and additional funding is 
greatly needed to augment existing research 
to promote new discoveries for children af-
fected by them. 
Congress passed the Gabriella Miller Kids 
First Research Act in 2014 to uncover new in-
sights into the biology of childhood disease. 
The law established a Ten-Year Pediatric Re-
search Initiative Fund within the National Insti-
tutes of Health’s (NIH) Common Fund and au-
thorized $12.6 million in funds annually for pe-
diatric disease research through the Gabriella 
Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program, 
commonly known as Kids First. Since the 
original law was enacted, Kids First has made 
progress towards understanding childhood 
cancer and disease. It has initiated the 
Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Cen-
ter—a comprehensive data resource for re-
search and patient communities meant to ad-
vance discoveries. 
The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 
2.0 builds off the important progress made by 
the 2014 Gabriella Miller Kids First Research 
Act by providing a new source of funding for 
the Kids First Research Fund. Specifically, the 
bill would redirect civil monetary sanctions lev-
ied against pharmaceutical, medical device, 
supplement and cosmetic manufacturers by 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
for violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act. By diverting penalties going into the Gen-
eral Treasury from these companies that 
break the law, the bill would sustain Kids 
First’s critical childhood disease research for 
generations to come. 
The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 
2.0 is named to honor 10–year-old Gabriella 
Miller who passed away from an inoperable 
brain tumor. She was a fierce advocate for 
childhood cancer research and her efforts to 
boost awareness of childhood cancer helped 
raise funds for children’s cancer charities. Jan-
uary 13, 2021 would’ve been Gabriella’s eight-
eenth birthday. I can’t think of a better way to 
celebrate her birthday than introducing this bill 
to honor her memory. I would like to thank 
Gabriella’s mother and my constituent, Ellyn 
Miller, for her tireless advocacy on behalf of 
children with cancer through Smashing Wal-
nuts. I am honored to have worked closely 
with Ellyn on the Gabriella Miller Kids First Re-
search Act 2.0.

Although we are experiencing tough times 
on Capitol Hill, this bipartisan bill dem-
onstrates that we can all come together for 
this great cause. I’m proud to introduce this 
bill to help find treatments and cures so that 
our nation’s children will have a fighting 
chance to survive cancer and other rare dis-
ease. The Gabriella Miller Kids First Research 
Act 2.0 will reaffirm our strong commitment to 
finding cures for childhood diseases.

IN RECOGNITION OF BOB 
FRANKLIN 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker I rise 
today to honor the centennial birthday of Bob 
Franklin. He was born on January 25, 1921, in 
Dallas County, Missouri to John and Iva 
Franklin. 
Bob graduated from Halfway High School in 
Polk County and served his country in World 
War II with the U.S. Army, which took him to 
the Middle East and Asia. From 1953 through 
1957 he served as the sheriff of Dallas Coun-
ty. 
Bob was also an auctioneer and owner of 
the Buffalo Sale Barn. He is the proud father 
of state Senator Sandy Crawford, Dr. Tama 
Franklin, and his son Randy who preceded 
him in death. Throughout his life, Bob has 
dedicated himself to his family and helping his 
community. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in wishing 
Bob Franklin and his family a happy birthday 
as they celebrate a century of life and service 
to the Dallas County community.

HONORING KEVEN PARKER 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor an influential and dedicated gentleman 
from Philadelphia, Keven Parker, a well-known 
restaurant owner and community advocate 
whose recent passing on January 15, 2021 
has left a void in the minds and hearts of the 
citizens of Philadelphia. 
Keven Parker was an incredible restaurateur 
and entrepreneur and his loss will be felt in 
the city of Philadelphia for years to come. He 
followed his mother’s mission of feeding peo-
ple delicious meals with restaurants on South 
Street, in Reading Terminal Market and oper-
ating a catering business. 
Ms. Tootsie’s Soul Food Cafe is a house-
hold name dedicated for his mother and her 
famous penchant for Tootsie’s Rolls. Keven as 
a young child would observe and help his 
mother Joyce, as she would teach him the de-
tails and nuances of producing extraordinary 
satisfying Soul Food. 
Keven was a hard working and self-made 
shining star entrepreneur and was one of con-
temporary Philadelphia’s great personalities 
and a true visionary. He came from humble 
origins but strong roots. Parker grew up in 
West Philadelphia and became a successful 
businessman, overseeing six distinct entities. 
Keven Parker’s restaurants were well re-
garded and were frequented by such people 
as President Bill Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Patti 
LaBelle, Will Smith and a host of others. His 
groundbreaking establishment Ms. Tootsie’s 
on South Street was named the best South-
ern-Style restaurant for three years running in 
Black Enterprise magazine and was featured 
on food TV shows. The Food Network’s Rob-
ert Irvine raved about his fried chicken on The 
Best Thing I Ever Ate. 
Furthermore, Parker was committed to giv-
ing back to his community exemplified by hir-
ing 55 individuals in his employ. The Keven 
Parker Company community outreach includes 
the Youth Adult Division, giving young men 
and women the opportunity to work for a pro-
gressive and upwardly mobile company while 
gaining valuable skills in an entrepreneurial 
and success-driven environment. 
Keven Parker dedicated his life to uplifting 
and improving the lives of others. He was a 
model citizen. The 3rd Congressional District 
of Pennsylvania extends gratitude to Keven 
Parker for his dedicated support and service 
to the City of Philadelphia and we mourn with 
his family and friends.

IN HONOR OF ED ‘‘BUTCH’’ AND 
JEAN SHIFFLETT OF SOUTH BOS-
TON 
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Ed ‘‘Butch’’ and Jean Shifflett, two 
wonderful and generous Americans from my 
home neighborhood of South Boston. 
Butch and Jean have been model citizens 
and engaged members of our South Boston 
community for decades. Butch, a Vietnam vet-
eran, together with his wife Jean, have been 
loving caretakers of St. Monica’s Church, 
where they have welcomed those seeking a 
sacred place of beauty and peace. Their hos-
pitality has made it possible for St. Monica’s 
Church to serve as a home for the recovery 
community, providing a safe gathering space 
for those seeking freedom from addiction as 
well as anchoring the food pantry, where they 
have provided a safety net for those struggling 
with hunger during these difficult times. 
Day or night, Butch and Jean have never 
failed to answer the call when a family in need 
has reached out for help. And they have of-
fered more than just practical help and assist-
ance: they have offered respect and warm 
goodwill, affirming the dignity of all. 
Butch and Jean have never sought recogni-
tion for their service to others. But on January 
24, 2021, we expressed our love and gratitude 
for the hope and healing they have brought to 
our community by naming the lower hall of the 
church where they have carried out their min-
istry in their honor. 
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to 
take the floor of the House today to thank Ed 
‘‘Butch’’ and Jean Shifflett for their decades of 
service to St. Monica’s Church and to the fam-
ilies of South Boston.

COMMENDING 
4EVER 
METAL 
ROOFING FOR ITS SUPPORT OF 
HOOSIER VETERANS 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commend 4Ever Metal Roofing for its invalu-
able support of Hoosier Veterans, especially 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Since its founding in 2016, the company has 
grown to employ several Hoosier veterans, 
contributed $7 million to northeast Indiana’s 
economy, and has expanded its reach to serv-
ing the tri-state area of Indiana, Michigan, and 
Ohio. 
However, the company’s commitment to our 
region stretches beyond providing jobs to Hoo-
sier veterans and services to consumers. Dur-
ing the pandemic, 4Ever Metal Roofing do-
nated $30,000 to FW22, a local non-profit fo-
cused on suicide prevention and supporting 
veterans suffering from PTSD and TBI. This 
donation went a long way to ensuring a Hoo-
sier veteran and his family had Christmas pre-
sents this year, and the remainder of the do-
nation will be used to support the work of 
FW22 as it assists many more struggling vet-
erans in the region. 
Going above and beyond to assist those in 
the community, especially those who fought to 
protect it, will always be something worth rec-
ognizing, and I commend 4Ever Metal Roofing 
for this selfless act of kindness. These are the 
kinds of partnerships that make our country 
great. I wish 4Ever Metal Roofing nothing but 
the best as they continue to grow in the years 
to come.

RECOGNIZING SYNDEE WOOD AS 
CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN

Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize Encinitas local, 
Syndee Wood, as my January Constituent of 
the Month. The COVID–19 pandemic con-
tinues to impact our hospitals, small busi-
nesses, and communities in the 49th District 
at a devastating rate. After a friend presented 
Ms. Wood with an opportunity to deliver pizzas 
to strained ICU workers and ten different de-
partments at Scripps hospital in Encinitas, 
Syndee felt gratitude and inspiration from their 
reaction.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E78 
January 28, 2021 
Our hospitals and ICU’s continue to hit 
devasting capacity numbers, leaving our med-
ical staff with longer hours and hectic shifts 
with not much time to sit down for a refueling 
meal. Additionally, our small businesses have 
been particularly hard hit with less opportuni-
ties for patronship. In an effort to combine 
both of these prevalent issues, Syndee gath-
ered funds from neighbors and friends, and so 
far, with the help of nearly 250 donations 
equaling more than $13,000, her volunteers 
have helped support 23 San Diego and North 
County locally-owned and franchised res-
taurants. 
The pandemic has shown us how valuable 
and vital community is for getting through this 
trying time in our country. I am incredibly 
thankful for residents like Syndee who have 
the heart and drive to rise to the occasion on 
the behalf of CA–49. As we continue working 
through this unprecedented time, it’s critical 
that we find inspiration in our friends and 
neighbors all around us. I am deeply grateful 
for Syndee bringing that hope to our cherished 
entrepreneurs, small businesses and health 
care staff, and I am honored to recognize her 
as my Constituent of the Month.

WILLIAM (PETER) W. GRANT, III 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 28, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize William (Peter) W. Grant, 
III, who passed away surrounded by family on 
December 12, 2020. 
Peter was born in New York to W.W. Grant 
III (Bill) and Katherine (Kocie) O’Connor in 
1932. He attended Phillips Academy, Andover 
MA and Yale University, graduating with a de-
gree in English. While at Yale, he met 
Rhondda Lowery and they were married in 
1955. They moved to New York City where he 
had started his career at Bankers Trust Com-
pany in 1954. Together they moved to his par-
ents’ hometown of Denver in 1958. He at-
tended Harvard University’s two summers-long 
Advanced Management Program in the mid 
’70s, widening his ever-growing circle of 
friends and associates worldwide. 
A nearly lifelong Colorado resident, he re-
tired in 1993 from his position as Chairman of 
the Colorado National Bank of Denver and 
Colorado National Bancshares after a 35-year 
career there. He rose from bond trader to 
President and Chairman, over years that 
brought a multitude of changes in banking 
from a single branch to holding companies; 
the addition of a credit card issuer (Rocky 
Mountain BankCard); interstate banking and fi-
nally a sale to First Bank Systems (now 
USBank) in 1993. 
His second career as a devoted philan-
thropist and advisor spanned over many 
years. He was a Director of Plains Petroleum 
and Barrett Resources. He served on, often 
chairing, the Boards of The Gates (rubber) 
Family Foundation, The Denver Museum of 
Nature and Science (formerly the Denver Mu-
seum of Natural History), The Nature Conser-
vancy of Colorado, the National Trust for His-
toric Preservation, The Episcopal Church 
Foundation, Four Mile Historic Park, the Rocky 
Mountain Conservancy (formerly the Rocky 
Mountain Nature Association), the Illif School 
of Theology, the Midwest Research institute, 
Colorado Energy Science Center, KRMA–TV, 
Channel Six, as well as an active vestryman 
and Senior Warden for St. Barnabas Epis-
copal Church (of Denver). He was active in 
the Andover Alumni Association and funded a 
scholarship. 
With his wife of 65 years, Rhondda, they 
supported the Smithsonian American History 
Museum providing lead funding on the Jeffer-
son Bible conservation and printing and the 
Abraham Lincoln exhibit at the Smithsonian 
National Portrait Gallery. They have been sig-
nificantly involved in the Gates Center for Re-
generative Medicine, supporting the Gates 
Summer Internship Program as well as other 
initiatives in stem cell research there. Most re-
cently, they were one of three sponsors of the 
Denver presentation of American Democracy: 
a Great Leap of Faith developed by the Na-
tional Museum of American History and cur-
rently on exhibit at the History of Colorado 
Center. He stood with integrity, honesty, intel-
ligence and admirable devotion to his large 
Grant family and his friends with a great sense 
of humor. 
Peter was a long-time steward of Grant fam-
ily interests in Colorado properties. His father 
Bill initiated development of their parents farm 
property southwest of Denver in the early ’80s. 
Peter and two other family branch representa-
tives entered into a partnership with Jordan 
Perlmutter to develop a number of shopping 
centers at the sites. One family branch resides 
in England; Peter was instrumental in per-
suading British Airways to open daily direct 
service to Denver. The Grant Family man-
aging ‘‘Senior Committee’’ which he devel-
oped, survives today as a model of family in-
vestment and stewardship now serving and 
benefiting the 4th, 5th and 6th generations. 
Peter was a devoted fan of the Colorado 
Rockies, both the hockey team (now the New 
Jersey Devils) and his beloved baseball team. 
He is survived by his wife Rhondda, their 
three daughters: Hallidie Haid (Don), Deirdre 
Mercurio (Jim) and Liza Grant, as well as six 
grandchildren: Relly, Wes, Marielle, Mac-
Kenzie, Patrick and Caleigh. I appreciate his 
lifetime service to our community.
