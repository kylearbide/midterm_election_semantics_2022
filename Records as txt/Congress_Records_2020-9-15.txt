Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2020 
No. 159 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. MCGOVERN).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
September 15, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable JAMES P. 
MCGOVERN to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 9:50 
a.m.

CASEY COUNTY FLOODING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to encourage this body to keep 
Casey 
County, 
Kentucky, 
in 
your 
thoughts and prayers. 
On Sunday, the community experi-
enced flooding that impacted multiple 
businesses, roads and homes in the 
area. 
This is not the first time the commu-
nity has experienced flood waters, with 
the ‘‘great flood’’ that occurred in 2010. 
The community came together during 
that flood, and I know they will once 
again unite to tackle this tremendous 
challenge. 
Casey County is a resilient commu-
nity where people look out for each 
other and help their neighbors in times 
of need. As they continue to weather 
this challenge, I would like to encour-
age anyone in or around Casey County 
to reach out to my office for any as-
sistance they may need moving for-
ward. 
HONORING TOMMY WILLETT 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize my dear friend, political 
teacher, community leader, and states-
man, Tommy Willett, who passed away 
on September 8. 
Tommy served as my Monroe County 
Judge/Executive from 2011 to 2018. 
Under his steady leadership, Monroe 
County saw unique and unprecedented 
cooperation among various elected offi-
cials, which was clearly reflected in his 
running unopposed for reelection on 
2014. 
I knew Tommy Willett my entire 
life. He owned Pure Drug Pharmacy in 
Tompkinsville and was always active 
in the world-famous Monroe County 
political scene. As a young, aspiring 
candidate for public office, Tommy 
took me under his wing and taught me 
so much about grass-roots organiza-
tion, political strategy, and get-out-to- 
vote techniques. 
Tommy’s 
beloved 
wife, 
Elizabeth 
Young Willett, preceded him in death. 
Ms. Willett was my high school English 
teacher, and one of the best ever at 
Monroe County High School. Tommy is 
survived by his two, fine sons, James 
and Scott Willett. 
Judge Willett lived a life of public 
service and professional achievement. 
He was a true Monroe County success 
story who will be deeply missed. 
HONORING DR. LEANN DALTON COOPER 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Leann Dalton Coo-
per, who has been selected by the Ken-
tucky Family Medicine as the State’s 
top, young doctor. She is a native of 
Russell County and a graduate of the 
University of Kentucky College of Med-
icine. For the past 3 years, she has 
practiced medicine in Russell County. 
Dr. Cooper will receive the award at a 
ceremony in Louisville on September 
25. 
Mr. Speaker, I join with everyone in 
Russell County and throughout the 
Commonwealth in honoring her on this 
outstanding statewide achievement. 
HONORING SENIOR CENTERS 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the valuable services 
that our senior centers in Kentucky 
are 
providing 
for 
senior 
citizens 
throughout the First Congressional 
District. 
Along with essential workers, senior 
centers have provided crucial services 
to our elderly populations during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
As the country has learned to adapt 
to different times, senior centers have 
also modified their services. For in-
stance, the Union County Senior Serv-
ices 
organization 
had 
to 
cancel 
potlucks, exercise classes, and bingo 
sessions. While those in-person activi-
ties were unfortunately suspended, the 
dedicated servants who make up this 
organization 
dramatically 
increased 
options for home delivery and meal 
pickup for area residents. 
In addition to providing meals, the 
Union County Senior Services also dis-
tributes food grocery items for the sen-
ior citizens. Just recently, they even 
hit a tremendous milestone of 15,000 
meals prepared since the beginning of 
the pandemic. Their tremendous con-
tributions have been replicated in the 
entire region, showing that Kentuck-
ians truly have each other’s backs dur-
ing times of need. 
As a lead Republican cosponsor of the 
Supporting Older Americans Act of 
2020, I understand the critical services

stand today to recognize all the hard 
work and dedications these centers 
provide throughout the First District 
of Kentucky.

JUSTICE FOR ALL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, as a liberated Democrat 
to say that the moral movement for 
justice everywhere cannot condone in-
justice anywhere. We cannot allow our-
selves to be induced to believe that 
there is a binary choice, that we must 
choose either peace officers or peaceful 
protesters. 
No, there is a righteous choice. And 
the righteous choice will cause us to 
conclude that we must choose justice 
for the police just as we choose justice 
for the protestors. Crimes committed 
against the police must be punished 
and crimes committed by the police 
must be punished. 
We are a Nation of laws, and if the 
law is to prevail, all criminals must be 
punished. But not only must they be 
punished; they must be punished expe-
ditiously against those who commit 
crimes against people just as we would 
have them be punished expeditiously 
against those who commit crimes 
against the police. ‘‘Injustice any-
where,’’ as Dr. King put it, ‘‘is a threat 
to justice everywhere.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I stand and I rise as a 
liberated Democrat to say we cannot 
condone crimes against the police nor 
can we condone crimes committed by 
the police. 
f 
SOLIDARITY WITH BELARUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong solidarity with the 
citizens and the political dissidents of 
Belarus. 
On August 9, 2020, Belarus held its 
presidential election with its incum-
bent President, Alexander Lukashenko, 
claiming victory with over 80 percent 
of the vote. Both the United States and 
the European Union have called the 
elections ‘‘neither fair or free,’’ as the 
Lukashenko regime restricted ballot 
access for candidates, prohibited local 
independent observers, and employed 
intimidation tactics against opposition 
candidates. 
Mass protests erupted following the 
election. 
Tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
protestors took to the street to express 
their disapproval of Lukashenko and 
his administration. His regime re-
sponded with excessive force to quell 
the protests, including the use of live 
and rubber ballots, leading to thou-
sands of Belarusian citizens being ei-
ther detained or arrested. It appears 
likely that violent crackdowns will 
continue. 
Mr. Speaker, included in these ar-
rests are several opposition leaders, in-
cluding former presidential candidates 
Sergei Tikhanovsky, Viktar Babaryka, 
Coordination Council members Liliya 
Vlasova, 
Sergei 
Dylevsky, 
Maria 
Kalesnikava, and Maxim Znak, as well 
as several of their staff and volunteers, 
Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the opposi-
tion presidential nominee, was forced 
to flee the country, as was opposition 
leader Veronika Tsepkalo and her hus-
band, 
former 
presidential 
nominee, 
Valery Tsepkalo. 
None of the dissidents have been 
given a fair trial, and all of them have 
had their human rights denied. As I 
think about the current situation in 
Belarus, I am reminded of President 
Ronald Reagan’s speech to Soviet dis-
sidents at Spaso House in 1988. Presi-
dent Reagan made two things clear 
that day: The United States’ commit-
ment to human rights are, and will 
continue to be, fundamental and un-
wavering, and that through strength, 
determination, and prayer, there is 
nothing you cannot conquer. 
Reagan also said in that speech, 
‘‘While we press for human rights 
through diplomatic channels, you press 
with your very lives, day in, day out, 
year after year, risking your jobs, your 
homes, your all.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, while the people of 
Belarus continue their tireless fight for 
human rights, the United States should 
be working with our European partners 
and allies to impose new sanctions on 
those responsible not only for voter re-
pression, but also for the violent crack-
downs that follow the election. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a list of 28 individuals.

law. We stand behind them.

IN HONOR OF PATRICK HENRY 
BEAUREGARD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
GREEN of Texas). The Chair recognizes 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to honor the 
life and service of a truly exceptional 
young man whom I had the great for-
tune of meeting and working with, Pat-
rick Henry Beauregard, who was taken 
from us far too soon on September 6, 
2020, after a courageous and awe-inspir-
ing battle with colorectal cancer. 
Many of you know that my own faith 
has been greatly influenced by the 
teachings of the Jesuits, and in par-
ticular, the idea that we ought to live 
our lives as men and women for others. 
Mr. Speaker, Patrick Beauregard em-
bodied this idea in every way. Patrick 
was born in Portland, Maine, and grew 
up in Medfield, Massachusetts. He at-
tended Thayer Academy in Braintree, 
Massachusetts, and Providence College 
in Providence, Rhode Island, where he 
met the love of his life, Amanda. 
After graduating from college, Pat-
rick decided to serve our country by 
enlisting in the United States Marine 
Corps where he was an intelligence an-
alyst. And during his service, Patrick 
received 
commendations 
for 
excep-
tional leadership, initiative, loyalty, 
and dedication to duty. 
Patrick’s stage 4 colorectal cancer 
diagnosis in September 2017 at the age 
of 29—a month after marrying his be-
loved wife, Amanda—changed every-
thing. I think some of us would be 
tempted to give in to the uncertainty 
and doubt. But Patrick remained posi-
tive 
through 
surgeries, 
immunotherapy, and over 40 rounds of 
chemotherapy. 
But what inspires me most about 
Patrick is that in the midst of this 
awful situation, he saw an opportunity 
to do good. Even as he fought his own 
disease with incredible grace and resil-
ience, he used his voice to speak out 
and to bring the issue of colorectal 
cancer to the attention of researchers, 
donors, elected officials, and other 
young people at risk for the disease. He 
appeared on the news, advocated for 
patients, and worked with groups like 
the Prevent Cancer Foundation, to 
educate the public about the alarming 
increase of young onset colorectal can-
cer. 
Mr. Speaker, Patrick Beauregard 
truly lived his life in service to others. 
From serving on the Alumni Associa-
tion Board at Thayer Academy, to 
serving in the United States Marine 
Corps, to serving as an advocate so 
that we can prevent this terrible dis-
ease, Patrick is an inspiration to all of 
us, and he embodies the ideas of service 
and self-sacrifice this Nation was built 
on. 
His incredible strength and tenacity 
allowed him to accomplish his final 
goal of meeting his son, Noah Patrick, 
on July 10, 2020. Noah, your dad was a 
great man, but more importantly, he 
was a very good man, who did his very 
best to serve those around him and 
made our world a better place. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people 
of Massachusetts, cancer patients and 
survivors around the world, and the en-
tire United States Congress, please join 
me in honoring the life and service of 
Patrick Henry Beauregard and praying 
for his family and friends and all those 
who hold him in their heart.

REMEMBERING LEROY JORDAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to remember 
Leroy Jordan. He was a beloved educa-
tor and community leader who passed 
away on September 5, 2020. 
Leroy was a native of Murphysboro, 
Illinois, and a graduate of Southern Il-
linois University at Carbondale. Leroy 
was hired by Iles Elementary School in 
Springfield, becoming the first Black 
male teacher in the district. He later 
served on that district’s school board, 
including two terms as school board 
president. He also went on to become 
the vice president of academic affairs 
at Sangamon State University, which 
is now known as the University of Illi-
nois at Springfield. 
He was a dedicated servant and lead-
er to his community. He advocated for 
freedom and justice, perhaps most no-
tably in his involvement in a 1974 de-
segregation lawsuit that created a bus-
ing system that helped balance the 
White and Black populations in Spring-
field’s public schools and encouraged 
the hiring of more minority teachers. 
Leroy was a legend in the city of 
Springfield, both in and out of the 
classroom. He was active in the Spring-
field Diocese, serving as the director of 
Black Catholic Ministries and instru-
mental with the Springfield Dominican 
Anti-Racism Team. He was also a 
member of Prince Hall Freemasons and 
Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. 
For so many, including our mutual 
good friend Irv Smith, Leroy was a 
friend, a role model, and a mentor. He 
will truly be missed. 
My 
prayers 
are 
with 
his 
wife, 
Johnetta; four daughters; and grand-
children. 
CONGRATULATING DOVE, INC. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Dove, Inc., on celebrating 50 years of 
dedicated service to their community. 
Formed in July of 1970, Dove has seen 
considerable growth in both their orga-
nization and the impact they have 
made on their community. 
Dove is a coalition of religious orga-
nizations that has excelled in their 
mission to address unmet human needs 
and social injustices. Their ministry, 
shared through a network of volunteers 
and advocates, aims to empower indi-
viduals to become self-reliant by en-
couraging clients’ freedom to make re-
sponsible decisions and determine their 
future based on informed opinions. 
For half a century, community lead-
ers at Dove have provided some of the 
most vulnerable in their community a 
place where they are cared for with 
dignity and compassion while on their 
path toward healing and self-suffi-
ciency. 
Dove provides services on important 
issues, 
such 
as 
domestic 
violence, 
homelessness, emergency financial as-
sistance, and prevention education pro-
gramming to K through third grade 
students. They currently impact thou-
sands of citizens every year through 
their various community service pro-
grams. 
Again, congratulations to Dove, Inc., 
on their 50th anniversary. I wish them 
and those they serve nothing but the 
best in the years to come. 
CONGRATULATING THOMAS J. WICKHAM 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I would be remiss not to offer 
heartfelt congratulations to somebody 
who, over the last 8 years, has not just 
been a colleague but has become a 
friend while standing up at that same 
Speaker’s rostrum when we were in the 
majority. The gentleman is none other 
than the House Parliamentarian, Tom 
Wickham. 
Tom has helped so many people on 
our side of the aisle. Now, as the other 
side has taken the majority, you have 
gotten to witness firsthand what I 
learned from Tom and the great people 
who work in the House Parliamentar-
ian’s Office during my 6 years in the 
majority and being able to be up in 
that chair working directly with him. 
Tom is somebody who I think every-
body got to know very well as someone 
who is actually very fair at admin-
istering the rules of this House. But I

An institution like the House of Rep-

f 
PROTECTING MILKWEED MILE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the incredible ef-
forts of the Thelander and Zarate fami-
lies, who have spearheaded a conserva-
tion and awareness program for thou-
sands of beautiful monarch butterflies 
that began their lives as caterpillars in 
Michigan’s 11th District before at-
tempting the 2,000-mile migration to 
central Mexico every year. 
A couple of years ago, Maecy Zarate, 
who was then just 8 years old, peti-
tioned the Highland Township board to 
establish the Milkweed Mile, a beau-
tiful stretch of land along highway M– 
59 in Highland Township that provides 
a sanctuary for monarchs. 
Along this stretch of road, which is 
designated as a no-mow zone, milkweed 
is left to grow and thrive freely, cre-
ating an ideal environment for mon-
arch caterpillars to complete their 
lifecycle. 
Each summer, these conservation ef-
forts culminate in the Highland Mon-
arch Butterfly Festival, an annual 
celebration of these amazing butter-
flies, in an effort to raise awareness of 
this species that has seen their global 
populations plummet in recent years. 
I was honored to visit the Highland 
Monarch Butterfly Festival in August 
of 2019, and it was so inspiring to meet 
young Michiganders passionate about 
conservation and biodiversity in our 
great State. 
This is also part of the work that we 
are doing on the House Science, Space, 
and Technology Committee, to protect 
and to promote biodiversity through-
out the world. 
The Thelander family also tags and 
releases hundreds of monarchs every 
year. One butterfly, named Jeronimo, 
was tracked all the way from Michi-
gan’s 11th District to central Mexico 
last year, beating the odds and com-
pleting a grueling 1,900-mile journey 
over 3 months. 
This is significant and symbolic. It is 
symbolic because of the journey that 
we are on as a Nation right now in 
somewhat 
uncertain 
and 
troubling 
times but with an end goal to reach the 
other side. 
The monarch sanctuary along Milk-
weed Mile provides a special oppor-
tunity for young people to get involved 
in real conservation efforts right in 
their backyard. As Maecy says, ‘‘If 
there’s no milkweed, there’s no mon-
archs.’’ 
I look forward to working with mon-
arch lovers all over Michigan to pro-
tect Milkweed Mile as a sanctuary for 
years to come. 
I ask this Chamber to join me in rec-
ognizing the inspiring efforts of the 
next generation of conservationists 
who are making a difference in our 
community through their passion and 
dedication for these beautiful butter-
flies. I could not be more proud of their 
efforts, and I look forward to learning 
more about their progress in next 
year’s Highland Township Monarch 
Festival.

REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT 
GENERAL BRENT SCOWCROFT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I rise in final salute to the serv-
ice of a man who loved the United 
States and devoted his life to her serv-
ice, Lieutenant General Brent Scow-
croft. 
General Scowcroft died August 6, 
2020, and leaves behind his loving 
daughter, Karen, and her family. His 
devoted friends, colleagues, and loyal 
longtime staff members are left with 
terrific memories of a man who served 
two Presidents and had delivered his 
wise counsel to them. 
General Scowcroft was the only 
American to serve two Presidents, 
President Gerald Ford and President 
George H.W. Bush, as their National 
Security Advisor. 
In September 1991, President Bush 
asked me to leave the Treasury Depart-
ment and join the White House staff, 
directing his Economic Policy Council. 
General Scowcroft was a member of 
that group and always made signifi-
cant, substantive, and humorous con-
tributions to our meetings when he was 
awake. 
Brent was renowned among his col-
leagues for his long hours, dedicated 
work, and daily care for his long-ailing, 
beloved wife, Jackie. That made late 
afternoon meetings a bit of a struggle. 
President Bush initiated the Scow-
croft Award to that Cabinet Secretary 
or senior staffer that nodded off in a 
meeting, as former staffer and now 
President of the Council on Foreign 
Relations Richard Haass described, in 
the most ostentatious manner. One of 
those nod-offs occurred in the Roo-
sevelt Room, with his head resting on 
my shoulder. 
During those White House years, my 
wife, Martha, served General Scowcroft 
as his deputy legal adviser. Our family 
extends our heartfelt condolences to 
Brent’s family and his scores of friends 
around the world. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF RICHARD COLBURN 
BUTLER, III 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of one of Arkansas’s great historic 
preservationists, 
and 
my 
lifelong 
friend, Richard Butler, III, who re-
cently passed away at the age of 82. 
Richard was born in 1937 in Little 
Rock, where his father, Dick, was a 
philanthropist for whom the Butler 
Center for Arkansas Studies is named. 
After receiving his law degree from 
the University of Arkansas, Richard 
practiced law for a few years before be-
coming a trust officer at the Commer-
cial National Bank of Little Rock. 
His attention to detail and historic 
architecture led to wonderful projects 
in Old Washington, Arkansas. For his 
devoted work, Richard was known in 
our State as Mr. Preservationist. 
Richard had a passion for teaching 
people about the history of Arkansas 
and was a steadfast supporter of 
churches and the arts. 
He was an inspiration and friend to 
many across our State, and I extend 
my respect, affection, and prayers to 
his friends, family, and loved ones. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DICKSON FLAKE 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I rise to honor the life and leg-
acy 
of 
one 
of 
Arkansas’s 
great 
businesspeople 
and 
civic 
leaders, 
Dickson Flake, who passed away peace-
fully on Tuesday, June 30, at the age of 
81. 
Throughout his life, Dickson’s ac-
complishments knew no bounds, as he 
played major roles in crucial Little 
Rock developments, including the Ar-
kansas 
BlueCross 
BlueShield 
head-
quarters and the Arkansas Department 
of Human Services. 
Dickson started his career in 1965 
after finishing at the University of 
Michigan with a master’s degree in 
business with high distinction. Because 
of his dedication, he was awarded the 
Arkansas Real Estate Association Re-
altor of the Year in 1971 and was in-
ducted into the Arkansas Real Estate 
Hall of Fame in 2011. He was named the 
2020 Business and Professional Leader 
of the Year by the Rotary Club of Lit-
tle Rock. 
With the passing of Dickson Flake, 
Martha and I lost a good friend. Like 
many in central Arkansas, I lost a wise 
counselor. 
In this time of thanks and reflection, 
Martha and I extend our condolences 
and prayers to his family.

LOS ANGELES OFFICERS 
AMBUSHED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, just last weekend, a 31-year- 
old mother and a 24-year-old man in 
Los Angeles were ambushed. They were 
shot at pointblank range by a coward 
who targeted them for no reason except 
for the uniform that they wear. 
These two police officers were at-
tacked in the very community where 
they serve, the community that they 
have sworn to protect.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4389 
September 15, 2020 
It is hard to believe, but this story 
gets worse. As these two police officers 
were in the hospital fighting for their 
lives, protestors stood outside, block-
ing ambulance entrances and chanting: 
‘‘We hope they die.’’ 
What has become of American cities? 
When did this behavior become accept-
able or even fathomable? 
This ambush demonstrates total dis-
regard for human life. It is an affront 
to American values. 
Thankfully, by the grace of God and 
the skill of first responders and trauma 
medical teams, these brave police offi-
cers are expected to recover from their 
injuries. We are fortunate that they 
are on the mend, and my prayers are 
with them on their road to recovery. 
Frankly, this time, we truly were 
fortunate. This time, we expect that a 
mother will return home to her family. 
We expect that a young police officer 
will return to his normal life. 
Indeed, this time, we are fortunate. 
But what about the next time? Will we 
let this happen again? 
Mr. Speaker, as a Nation, we cannot 
allow this malicious and wicked behav-
ior to continue. We cannot stand by as 
police officers are shot at pointblank 
range. We cannot stand by while 
protestors scream ‘‘We hope they die’’ 
at critically injured public servants. 
We must restore law and order to all 
American cities. 
In this Chamber, we should dispense 
with the Democrats’ political games 
and enact commonsense, bipartisan so-
lutions such as the JUSTICE Act, 
which was introduced by Senator TIM 
SCOTT and Congressman PETE STAUBER, 
to increase police transparency and ac-
countability while supporting our law 
enforcement community and equipping 
them with the resources that they need 
to safely protect our communities. 
We cannot stand on the sidelines and 
leave our law enforcement officers vul-
nerable to attacks. This is not the time 
to turn our backs on the police; this is 
not the time to dismantle the police; 
and this is definitely not the time to 
defund the police. We must protect the 
American people; we must restore law 
and order; and we must back the blue.

LAW AND ORDER IN OUR 
COMMUNITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to express my wholehearted support for 
our Nation’s law enforcement commu-
nity. Members of this very Congress 
have called to defund the police, and 
when they say ‘‘defund police,’’ they 
mean it literally. They want to strip 
away support for the officers who keep 
our communities safe. 
Our men and women in blue deserve 
the utmost respect as they put their 
lives on the line every day to protect 
and serve their communities. We wit-
ness now, more than ever, just how 
dangerous this job is. 
We are a nation of law and order, and 
that is why I will always back the blue. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SUPPORTS OUR VETERANS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
as a veteran of the United States Ma-
rine Corps to thank President Trump 
and his administration for all the out-
standing work he has done for our vet-
erans and the members of the military. 
During a time when our country has 
needed it most, President Trump has 
shown robust support for our brave 
men and women in uniform. 
Our Armed Forces serve our Nation 
with honor, and it is our duty to pro-
vide them with the resources they need 
to keep Americans safe. We are build-
ing our military and making sure it 
comes to be the strongest force in the 
world. 
TRUCK DRIVERS APPRECIATION WEEK 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Truck Drivers Apprecia-
tion Week. 
As a Representative from the ‘‘Cross-
roads of America,’’ I know firsthand 
just how important truck drivers are 
to our community and to our Indiana 
economy. Over 80 percent of Hoosiers 
depend on the trucking industry to 
keep their businesses moving. 
As a businessman, I understand the 
important role trucking plays in the 
American economy, and it is my hope 
that Truck Drivers Appreciation Week 
brings attention to driver safety and fi-
nancial support for this working com-
munity. 
RICHARD G. LUGAR POST OFFICE 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of S. 3105, a bill to designate 
the facility of the U.S. Postal Service 
located in Indianapolis as the Richard 
G. Lugar Post Office. 
Senator Lugar was a true statesman 
who led a life of honor and service to 
Indiana and this country. As mayor of 
Indianapolis, 
Dick 
Lugar’s 
vision 
transformed our State’s capital city. 
As an Indiana Senator, he left a lasting 
legacy on domestic and global affairs. 
The Hoosier State is greater and our 
Nation is stronger because of Richard 
G. Lugar. I am proud and humbled to 
stand with my colleagues to honor the 
life of this great Hoosier. 
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS TO I–70 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to bring attention to important and 
positive news regarding infrastructure 
in the Hoosier State. 
The U.S. Department of Transpor-
tation is awarding a grant of $22.5 mil-
lion to the Indiana Department of 
Transportation to improve the infra-
structure on I–70. 
Hoosiers deserve the best infrastruc-
ture, and that means making sure our 
interstates are as safe and efficient as 
possible. I hear from constituents fre-
quently about I–70, and I am glad to 
announce a huge improvement is head-
ing toward the Sixth District. 
Thank you to the Trump administra-
tion for continuing to be committed to 
improving the infrastructure of our Na-
tion. 
RECOGNIZING HOOSIER FARMERS 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the amazing Hoosier agri-
cultural community. 
Farmers across our Nation work hard 
each day ensuring our friends, family, 
and neighbors can put food on the 
table. This devoted community has re-
cently been put to the test with 
COVID–19, and they have stood up to 
the challenge to keep America fed. 
I recently had the privilege of hold-
ing a farmers roundtable in my district 
to hear directly from this community 
how I can better represent them in 
Congress. As Indiana’s Sixth District 
Representative, I will always support 
Hoosier farmers and our ag and ethanol 
communities. 
CONGRESS MUST GET BACK TO WORK 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to urge Congress to get back to sub-
stantive work in our Nation’s Capital. 
The definition of Congress is ‘‘a na-
tional legislative body, especially that 
of the United States, which meets at 
the Capitol in Washington, D.C.’’ 
Last week, I was the only one to 
physically attend a Transportation 
Committee hearing on rail workers af-
fected by COVID–19. 
I believe the proper way for Congress 
to represent our constituents is in per-
son in our Nation’s Capital. It is imper-
ative we simply get back to work for 
our constituents.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord, God of the universe, we give 
You thanks for giving us another day. 
As the morning temperatures cool 
here 
at 
the 
Capitol, 
and 
schools 
throughout the country open to var-
ious configurations, we know the sea-
son is changing, yet the challenges 
confronting our Nation remain. The 
weather in the West especially belies 
the normal and further gives notice 
that much needs to be done. 
Bless the Members of the people’s 
House with wisdom and goodwill, that 
they might address these many chal-
lenges with due care and diligence, and 
the stress confronting so many of our 
families and businesses might be eased.

HONORING MAYOR MICHAEL 
COPELAND 
(Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and serv-
ice of Mayor Michael Copeland, who 
passed away on August 19, 2020. 
Mayor Copeland was a devoted father 
and husband. He is survived by his 
wife, Maria, and three children, Olivia, 
Abigail, and Joshua. 
As Olathe’s longest serving mayor, 
he was elected in 2001 and held the of-
fice until his passing. 
Mayor Copeland leaves behind a leg-
acy that has touched the lives of many 
in the Olathe community. 
Personally, 
I 
will 
miss 
Mayor 
Copeland’s counsel. I very much appre-
ciated each one of our many conversa-
tions since I took office. He was always 
generous with his time and knowledge, 
willing and eager to represent the peo-
ple of Olathe. 
Mr. Speaker, I offer my deepest con-
dolences to Mayor Copeland’s family 
and friends and to all of those who will 
miss his kindness and leadership. This 
truly is a loss for Kansas and our com-
munity. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MARY KAY CSANYI 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today 
and recognize Mary Kay Csanyi from 
Kernersville, North Carolina. 
Since 2004, Mary Kay has served as an 
administrative 
assistant 
with 
the 
Kernersville Chamber of Commerce. 
The title she holds does not do justice 
to the impact she has at the chamber 
or in Kernersville. To me, she was the 
sunshine in the room, no matter where 
she is. Her ray of sunshine will be sore-
ly missed. 
In her capacity, she has coordinated 
numerous craft shows, festivals, and 
events within the Kernersville commu-
nity. After 15 wonderful years at the 
Kernersville Chamber, Mary Kay re-
tired on August 26 and celebrated 
alongside her colleagues and friends 
with a drive-in celebration. 
Mary Kay, as you enter this new 
stage of your life, I know that you will 
continue to serve your community, im-
pact the lives of your friends and 
neighbors, and be a ray of sunshine 
wherever you are. 
May God continue to bless you; Bob, 
your husband of 40 years; and your 
family. 
f 
RECOGNIZING BUFFALO BLACK 
ACHIEVERS 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to recognize the Buffalo 
Black Achievers, who will soon cele-
brate virtually its 48th annual Black 
Achievers Awards ceremony. 
I have been honored to speak at sev-
eral past ceremonies, and I am certain 
this year’s event will be very memo-
rable. 
The Buffalo Black Achievers honor 
the character and accomplishments of 
outstanding citizens of Buffalo and 
western New York and the substantial 
contributions they make every day. 
In 2020, 36 Black Achievers Awards 
will be bestowed upon recipients in a 
variety of walks of life. A particular 
emphasis is placed upon community 
service, a fact underscored by the ex-
istence of the Black Achievers Scholar-
ship, which has funded awards to local 
high school students for more than 15 
years. 
My congratulations go out to all of 
those 
earning 
the 
Buffalo 
Black 
Achievers Awards for 2020, and I offer 
my best wishes to my friend, Chief Ex-
ecutive Officer Herb Bellamy, Jr., and 
in the memory of his great father, Herb 
Bellamy, Sr., and to the other members 
of his board of directors for a success-
ful virtual ceremony in 2020. 
We look forward to celebrating to-
gether once again in 2021.

TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION 
NEGO-
TIATES PEACE IN MIDDLE EAST 
(Mr. BOST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, we are wit-
nessing history at this time: historic 
peace agreements between Israel and 
its Arab neighbors, the UAE and Bah-
rain, both negotiated with the help of 
the Trump administration. 
But judging from the media coverage, 
you would hardly know it. In fact, I 
wouldn’t be surprised if we actually 
saw a banner headline like this: Extra! 
Trump kills U.S. defense jobs! Presi-
dent brokers Middle East peace deals. 
I made this front-page parody, but it 
is trying to make a point. 
When President Jimmy Carter bro-
kered the Camp David Accords between 
Egypt and Israel, the achievement was 
celebrated. He was awarded the Nobel 
Peace Prize. It was a defining moment 
in history. 
There have been just four peace 
agreements negotiated between Israel 
and 
its 
Arab 
neighbors. 
President 
Trump played an important role in two 
of these, as well as his administration. 
Let’s give credit where credit is due, 
and let’s work together for even more 
peace in the region.

COMMENDING 
OREGON’S 
FIRST 
RESPONDERS ON FRONT LINES 
OF HISTORIC WILDFIRES 
(Mr. SCHRADER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, over 
the last week, historic wildfires have 
ravaged my home State of Oregon. I 
have three major fires in my congres-
sional district alone. 
These fires continue to burn at an 
alarming rate. The extent of loss of life 
and property is still unknown. 
However, without the heroic life-
saving work of our firefighters, police, 
and sheriffs’ offices, the sheer mag-
nitude of that loss would have been far 
greater. 
First responders from Lincoln, Mar-
ion, Polk, Clackamas, and Tillamook 
Counties have been working around the 
clock to evacuate families while the 
winds have changed most rapidly and 
dangerously, putting their own lives in 
peril. 
Currently, Oregon experiences the 
worst air quality in the world and has 
been 
enveloped 
in 
absolute 
dense 
smoke for 1 week. 
Many of those battling these fires 
live in impacted communities and have 
continued their work as their families 
evacuate and their homes are lost. 
There are not enough words of 
thanks to give to these heroes, but I 
know that I speak on behalf of all Or-
egonians when I say that we are for-
ever grateful to you. 
f 
HONORING SERGEANT MAJOR 
THOMAS PAYNE 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-

Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, all of America was grateful on 
Friday, the 19th anniversary of the 
September 11 attacks, to witness Presi-
dent Donald Trump present Sergeant 
Major Thomas Patrick Payne the mili-
tary’s highest honor for valor, the 
Medal of Honor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4391 
September 15, 2020 
A native of South Carolina towns 
Batesburg-Leesville and Lugoff, Payne 
and Master Sergeant Joshua L. Wheel-
er with fellow Army Rangers in 2015 
helped rescue about 70 hostages set to 
be executed by the Islamic State ter-
rorists in Iraq. The terrorists had dug 
mass graves to prepare for mass mur-
der. 
Sadly, Sergeant Wheeler lost his life, 
but Payne, with Kurdish commandos, 
continued their multiple courageous 
assaults to cut the locks, free the hos-
tages, and helicopter the hostages to 
freedom. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

HONORING LEVESTER THOMPSON 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in memory of my con-
stituent Levester Thompson, who was 
taken from us far too soon after bat-
tling COVID–19. 
Growing up in a small Virginia town 
of 300, LT aspired to move to the big 
city, inspired to work as a banker in 
Manhattan. He commuted 21⁄2
hours 
every day from Staten Island to pursue 
that dream. 
As he got older, he realized there is 
so much more to life, so he returned to 
his true passion, his true passion for 
sports, working as an equipment man-
ager for NYU’s athletics department 
and spending more time helping his 
children, Jade and Chase, realize their 
own passions. 
LT was a larger-than-life character, a 
coach, a mentor, someone with a great 
sense of humor, and a smile that will 
be so dearly missed. 
LT, you will forever live in our mem-
ory.

EXPAND 
MILK 
OPTIONS 
AVAIL-
ABLE THROUGH WIC PROGRAM 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor 
the GIVE MILK Act with my Pennsyl-
vania colleague FRED KELLER. 
The GIVE MILK Act is an important 
piece of legislation that gives families 
who use the WIC program more control 
over the nutrition of their children. 
The bill would make 2 percent and 
whole milk available through the WIC 
program to any child over the age of 2, 
reversing an Obama-era rule limiting 
WIC participants to low-fat or non-fat 
milk. 
This legislation will give families 
who depend on WIC more options when 
considering 
nutritional 
options 
for 
their children. It will also help in-
crease milk consumption, which is a 
win for our dairy farmers. 
Whole milk has been wrongfully tar-
geted as unhealthy in recent years, but 
in reality, it provides a wealth of vital 
nutrients that are particularly impor-
tant for growing children. 
Including whole milk in the WIC pro-
gram will provide a healthy option for 
those families who find themselves de-
pending upon these benefits for essen-
tial nutrition.

DEFENDING AMERICAN VALUES 
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the timeless American prin-
ciples of freedom, equality, and oppor-
tunity. These principles are the foun-
dation on which our Nation was built. 
Unlike the nations and the empires 
that came before, the United States 
was founded on an idea, an idea that 
men are created equal and have certain 
inalienable rights given by our Creator. 
This idea turned into a dream, a dream 
that, no matter what circumstances 
you come from, you can come to Amer-
ica and be free to pursue your dreams 
and be equal to your peers in the eyes 
of the law. 
There are some among us who think 
this system of self-government has 
failed. There are some who believe so-
cialism is a better tool to achieve the 
American Dream, and they think, by 
tearing down our institutions, by toss-
ing aside the Constitution, and by giv-
ing the government more control that 
they will somehow achieve utopia. 
Using history as a guide, we know this 
to be wrong. 
Our Constitution is special because it 
limits the power of government while 
safeguarding our freedoms and our civil 
rights. I will do my best to follow their 
example and keep our America as the 
shining city on the hill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LEVIN of Michigan). The gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania is recognized for 1 
hour. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. WOODALL), my dis-
tinguished colleague from the Rules 
Committee, pending which I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. Dur-
ing consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, yester-
day, the Rules Committee met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 1107, 
providing for consideration of H.R. 
2574, the Equity and Inclusion Enforce-
ment Act, and H.R. 2694, the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act, under closed 
rules. 
The rule provides for 1 hour of debate 
for each of the two bills, equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. The rule also 
self-executes a manager’s amendment 
to H.R. 2574. 
Additionally, the rule provides for 
consideration of H.R. 2639, the Strength 
in Diversity Act, under a structured 
rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor and 
makes in order 12 amendments. The 
rule provides that the chair of the 
Committee on Education and Labor 
may offer amendments en bloc, debat-
able for 20 minutes. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H. Res. 908, Condemning All 
Forms of Anti-Asian Sentiment As Re-
lated to COVID–19, under a closed rule. 
Finally, the rule extends recess in-
structions, suspension and same-day 
authority through November 20, 2020. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to begin de-
bate on four bills today that will pro-
tect workers, encourage diversity and 
inclusion in the workforce, and dem-
onstrate Congress’ support for our 
Asian-American communities in the 
face of anti-Asian rhetoric by the ad-
ministration and right with respect to 
COVID–19. 
COVID–19 has infected over 27 million 
people worldwide and claimed the lives 
of over 900,000, including almost 200,000 
of our fellow Americans. This pan-
demic brought the world to a standstill 
economically and socially. Virtually 
everything in our daily lives has been 
affected in some form. 
There 
was 
no 
coherent 
national 
strategy to deal with this deadly pan-
demic when it started, and now, 6-plus 
months in, Americans are still being 
left behind by an executive branch 
more focused on downplaying the virus’ 
severity than getting it under control 
and our economy and way of life back 
on track. 
In Congress, we find ourselves having 
to deal with a Senate majority that 
has even less interest in controlling 
the virus and helping American fami-
lies than the President. The House has 
passed numerous pieces of legislation 
that would directly help American 
workers, small businesses, families, 
and children; but, in the midst of a 
pandemic, Leader MCCONNELL is more 
interested in packing the judiciary 
than he is in passing legislation to help 
the American people. The HEROES Act 
has sat on Leader MCCONNELL’s desk 
collecting dust for exactly 4 months to 
the day. 
In the absence of leadership by the 
White House and Senate, our cities and 
States are desperate for resources to 
combat the pandemic. The American 
people are calling out for relief, but 
Republicans 
are 
willfully 
ignoring 
them. Instead, they are trying to di-
vert attention from their abject failure 
to take prompt or effective action ear-
lier this year when tens of thousands of 
lives could have been saved. Instead, 
this administration is using the play-
book 
of 
fear-mongering 
autocrats 
through the ages by demonizing a 
marginalized group. 
In recent months, we have seen a 
marked rise in anti-Asian sentiment 
and rhetoric. Racist and xenophobic 
names for COVID–19 have been spouted 
by elected officials, and these terms 
have had damaging, far-reaching im-
pact on Asians and Asian Americans. 
As we have seen over the past 4 
years, the endorsement of racist lan-
guage by national leaders has led to 
well-documented increases in racist 
speech and hate crimes across the 
country. This harmful rhetoric has re-
sulted in physical attacks, verbal as-
saults, workplace discrimination, and 
online harassment against our fellow 
citizens. These are our friends and 
neighbors, essential workers, nurses, 
law enforcement officers, and teachers. 
The vitriol against our fellow Ameri-
cans must be forcefully and over-
whelmingly condemned, Mr. Speaker. 
In the midst of this pandemic, re-
affirming American values is more nec-
essary than ever, whether it is con-
demning hate speech or making sure 
that our government is working for all 
Americans and not just Wall Street ty-
coons or real estate developers. There-
fore, I would recommend to my col-
leagues that they encourage Senator 
MCCONNELL to quickly take up the HE-
ROES Act or come to the table with 
good-faith 
negotiations 
to 
address 
COVID–19 in a thoughtful and people- 
focused way. 
I thank my colleague, Congress-
woman GRACE MENG from New York, 
for introducing this necessary resolu-
tion and the House Judiciary Com-
mittee for quickly getting this before 
the Rules Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been more than 
65 years since the Supreme Court made 
racial segregation in public education 
illegal, but over the past several dec-
ades, racial and socioeconomic segrega-
tion in our schools has dramatically in-
creased. This didn’t happen by acci-
dent. 
In many counties across the U.S., 
children are assigned to schools based 
on where their home is located. If your 
parents can afford to live in a more af-
fluent area and pay higher property 
taxes, the school you attend will re-
flect this. 
b 1030 
The opposite, of course, is true for 
students in poorer areas, and centuries 
of systemic racism have relegated far 
too many students of color to poorer 
neighborhoods and school districts. 
School districts that predominantly 
serve students of color receive $23 bil-
lion less in funding than predomi-
nantly White school districts. The re-
sult of this undeniable gap in edu-
cational funding is that students of 
color have fewer resources, older equip-
ment, and aging—if not crumbling—fa-
cilities that make learning more chal-
lenging compared to their peers in 
higher-income areas. 
In a 2001 Supreme Court decision, 
Alexander v. Sandoval, a conservative 
majority stripped away four decades of

statutory protection against discrimi-
nation by disallowing victims of these 
unjust policies from bringing disparate 
impact claims under title VI of the 
Civil Rights Act. Fortunately, the bill 
we are considering this week will re-
store the rights of students, parents, 
and communities to address this sys-
temic harm by allowing those im-
pacted to seek enforcement in our 
courts. 
The Equity and Inclusion Enforce-
ment Act is critical to reforming how 
education is accessed in the United 
States. It is long past time for Con-
gress to step in and ensure that the law 
can address discriminatory policies and 
practices, and that is exactly what this 
bill will do. 
Similar to the Equity and Inclusion 
Enforcement Act, the Strength in Di-
versity Act addresses the importance 
of increasing diversity in education 
and eliminating socioeconomic and ra-
cial segregation. Once again, edu-
cational opportunities for our children 
largely depend on their home ZIP code. 
Unsurprisingly, segregation has a 
detrimental impact on learning and 
educational outcomes. Research shows 
that students educated in integrated 
schools have higher test scores, are 
more likely to enroll in college and are 
less likely to drop out. Moreover, inte-
grated classrooms have been found to 
encourage critical thinking, problem 
solving, and creativity. 
Consistent with the primacy of local 
control of education, many school dis-
tricts around the country have imple-
mented innovative strategies to ad-
dress school segregation. Strategies to 
support more diverse and inclusive 
learning include the development of 
state-of-the-art magnet schools, open 
enrollment policies, and changes in 
feeder patterns to promote diversity. 
Research suggests that diverse settings 
reduce stereotypes and promote cross- 
racial understanding which is espe-
cially important as our country moves 
towards a more ethnically and cul-
turally diverse society. 
The Strength in Diversity Act sup-
ports communities in developing, im-
plementing, and expanding diversity 
initiatives to promote higher levels of 
social cohesion and reduce racial preju-
dice. There is no one solution to make 
education more equitable for our stu-
dents, but different data clearly shows 
that increased diversity in classrooms 
is one of the best ways for all students 
to receive a quality education. This 
bill will promote those solutions. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, we have the 
Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. 
COVID–19 has exposed and exacer-
bated the hurdles women continue to 
face in the workplace, so let’s start out 
by stating one obvious fact: women 
shouldn’t be forced to choose between 
financial security and a healthy preg-
nancy. 
It has been illegal to discriminate 
against pregnant women for decades, 
but we know that this damaging prac-
tice remains widespread. 
Women make up nearly half of the 
labor force in this country, yet preg-
nancy discrimination persists, includ-
ing losing a job, being denied reason-
able accommodation, or not being 
hired in the first place. In fact, the 
number of pregnancy discrimination 
claims filed with the Equal Employ-
ment 
Opportunity 
Commission 
has 
been steadily rising for two decades 
and is hovering near an all-time high. 
These practices aren’t new, and they 
must end. 
This is an issue that spans the polit-
ical spectrum and affects women in 
every corner of this country. Estimates 
indicate that over 20 percent of preg-
nant workers are employed in jobs that 
are both low wage and physically de-
manding. Women of color are heavily 
overrepresented in these estimates, 
with nearly one in three employed 
Black and Latina women working in 
low-wage jobs. 
Though the Pregnancy Discrimina-
tion Act has been law since the seven-
ties and despite a 2015 Supreme Court 
decision allowing for reasonable ac-
commodation claims, an unreasonably 
high standard of proof is still allowing 
discrimination against many pregnant 
workers. 
The bipartisan Pregnant Workers 
Fairness Act helps change this practice 
by strengthening Federal workplace 
protections and promoting the health 
and well-being of pregnant women and 
their families. This important legisla-
tion requires public-sector employers 
and 
private-sector 
employers 
with 
more than 15 employees to make rea-
sonable accommodations for pregnant 
employees and individuals with known 
limitations 
related 
to 
pregnancy, 
childbirth, or related medical condi-
tions. 
It is 2020. We should not have to have 
this debate or lay out an entire argu-
ment as to why we should protect preg-
nant workers. But here we are. It is 
past time that pregnant workers have 
fair and equal opportunity in employ-
ment. It is past time that the protec-
tions of the Pregnant Workers Fairness 
Act become law. 
When more women work, the better 
the economy performs. Women are not 
asking for special treatment or hand-
outs, just the workplace protections 
they deserve so that they can do the 
jobs they need to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my col-
leagues who helped craft these superb 
pieces of legislation. I look forward to 
supporting this rule, I urge my col-
leagues to do the same, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I want to thank my colleague from 
Pennsylvania for yielding me the time. 
She and I have the pleasure of serv-
ing on the Congressional Moderniza-
tion Committee together—a bipartisan 
committee—and it is not infrequent 
that we will have identified a problem 
and she will have identified a solution, 
and I will think: Why haven’t we come 
up with that before. And we will move 
forward in partnership together. 
I think that is the way the American 
people expect this House to run, and 
doggone it, we are close to getting 
there today, Mr. Speaker. 
But I listened to my colleague as she 
laid the mantle of blame at the feet of 
our friends in the Senate and our 
friends in the White House, for why 
can’t they get more things done? 
The truth is we have opportunities 
here to get things done, and I will tell 
you, Mr. Speaker, the mantle of re-
sponsibility sits with us, and we are 
missing some of those opportunities 
today to come together and do things 
in a partnership way. 
Over the weekend, Mr. Speaker, I was 
with our colleague, DENNY HECK from 
Washington State. We were in a forum 
on polarization in Congress, and we 
were talking about what that has 
meant, how that has come to be, and 
how legislation is affected by that. Mr. 
HECK said something that I thought 
was very profound and not really un-
derstood outside of the Halls of Con-
gress. Folks often talk about their par-
tisan achievements, but, he said that— 
and I will paraphrase him—there is 
really a special sense of pride that 
Members take in sorting out those 
really thorny issues, those issues that 
you had to come together and work on, 
those issues where you had to give a 
little to get a little, and those issues 
that not just anybody could have 
solved but that we came together with 
a unique mix of people at a unique time 
and that Members take special pride in 
cracking those hardest of nuts. 
I think that is exactly right. The 
media doesn’t cover those successes, I 
think, with the same glee that partisan 
bickering is covered, but, absolutely, 
men and women of conscience in this 
body take special pride in solving par-
ticularly hard problems. 
We have an opportunity today, Mr. 
Speaker, to solve some problems, and I 
am not sure that we are taking full ad-
vantage 
of 
that. 
Principled 
com-
promise, Mr. Speaker, does not mean 
finding the lowest common denomi-
nator. It means finding those things 
that all of our constituents are asking 
us to do and figuring out how in 435 dif-
ferent districts and different sets of 
ideas we can meld those things to-
gether. 
We have in this rule today, Mr. 
Speaker, a whole host of bills. I miss 
the days where we did one rule and one 
bill. I recognize the pandemic has 
caused some time crunch problems, but 
I hope that when these masks come 
off—as I am absolutely certain one day 
they will—we will return to being a 
body that can handle one idea at a 
time and have a full-throated debate on 
each idea, but this bill makes in order 
a number of bills. 
I will start with H.R. 2639, the 
Strength in Diversity Act, Mr. Speak-
er. It must have been said by every 
Member who spoke yesterday that dis-
crimination is wrong, that it is im-
moral, that it is unlawful, and that we

September 15, 2020 
have to do absolutely everything we 
can to ensure that American school 
children are treated equally in our 
schools. H.R. 2639 purports to do that. 
Again, this is an idea that has great 
bipartisan support. It has moral right 
on its side. Separate is not equal, and 
learning from diversity is part of the 
strength that our Nation provides. I am 
glad, even though we offered a motion 
for an open rule so that all Members 
could have their voices heard, my 
friends in the majority on the Rules 
Committee saw fit to make 12 separate 
amendments in order, including one 
from my colleague from Georgia (Mr. 
ALLEN) that I believe will make this 
bill better. 
The Allen amendment is an oppor-
tunity for us to work together and 
move forward, not just on something 
that goes to the Senate, Mr. Speaker, 
but something that goes to the Senate 
and moves beyond. I have been there, 
and so I understand the need to say: I 
have sent my idea to the Senate and 
the Senate isn’t moving it, and shame 
on the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, if you talk to your 
friends in this Senate, whether it is a 
Democratic-led Senate or a Repub-
lican-led Senate, they will tell you 
that if you send them bad ideas they 
are not going to move them. 
We can send good ideas to the United 
States Senate, Mr. Speaker, good ideas 
that will move across the floor, ideas 
that will move to the President’s desk 
and thus ideas that will make a dif-
ference. We all grow weary on this 
floor of talking about things we would 
like to do, and we often mistake pass-
ing something using a very partisan 
majority in the House as getting some-
thing done. It is not. It is absolutely 
making a statement, but it is getting 
absolutely nothing done. Only when 
the Senate acts and only when the 
President acts are we able to get some-
thing done. We have that opportunity 
with the Allen amendment today, Mr. 
Speaker, and I hope folks will take ad-
vantage of that. 
Mr. Speaker, another bill that the 
rule makes in order is the Pregnant 
Workers Fairness Act, H.R. 2694. 
Again, there is not a single Member 
in this body who believes that discrimi-
nation is appropriate. This is another 
opportunity that we had to work in a 
partnership way to move a bill forward. 
We all believe it is important for em-
ployers to provide reasonable accom-
modations to pregnant workers. We all 
want what is best for these workers; 
and, in fact, we heard from the ranking 
member of the Education and Labor 
Committee yesterday, Mr. Speaker, 
that Chairman SCOTT, the chairman of 
that committee, had worked to try to 
make this bill better. The bill is dif-
ferent today than it was when it was 
introduced because of that partnership 
effort. Again, any good thing that 
comes out of this institution comes out 
in a partnership way. 
One more step that, of course, the 
minority was hoping we could make 
would be one to protect religious free-
doms in this bill, the rights of religious 
institutions, Mr. Speaker. This is not a 
radical idea. This is something we have 
been doing for 50 years when we have 
talked about nondiscrimination stat-
utes. It is my hope that Chairman 
SCOTT, having heard the arguments 
yesterday in the Rules Committee and 
having heard from our ranking mem-
ber, the gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina, Dr. FOXX, that he will take yes for 
an answer. There is still time to come 
back and improve this bill and get it 
across the floor in a very bipartisan, 
again, partnership way that not just 
makes it to the Senate but makes it 
through the Senate on to the Presi-
dent’s desk to effect the law as we all 
desire. I think the American people 
will thank us if we seize this oppor-
tunity to find common ground. 
Mr. Speaker, we see this, again, in H. 
Res. 908 that this rule makes in order 
today. It condemns all forms of anti- 
Asian sentiment and bias as it relates 
to COVID–19. Mr. Speaker, I would en-
courage you to go and read this resolu-
tion. As you know from House resolu-
tions, you have a series of ‘‘and 
whereases’’, and then you have what it 
is that we want to do. 
If you read this series of whereases, 
you will find it to be as stridently par-
tisan as you often find House resolu-
tions to be, and it is not necessary that 
it be that way. We all condemn and de-
nounce 
anti-Asian 
sentiment, 
Mr. 
Speaker, all manifestations of racism, 
of xenophobia, of scapegoating, and of 
intolerance. We all condemn those 
ideas, and we all want Federal law en-
forcement to play a strong role in en-
suring that Asian-American commu-
nities across this country are protected 
and that crimes against them are in-
vestigated and properly prosecuted. 
In fact, Mr. Speaker, in July of this 
year I joined, again, in a partnership, 
bipartisan way Mr. LIEU and Ms. CHU 
on the Democratic side of the aisle and 
Mr. OLSON and myself on the Repub-
lican side of the aisle. We led a letter 
to Attorney General Barr that included 
signatories like my friend from Penn-
sylvania (Ms. SCANLON) asking that the 
Justice Department bolster its work in 
this area and to send an unambiguous 
message to the American people that 
anti-Asian bias and discrimination will 
not be tolerated at any level of our 
government. 
In fact, Mr. Speaker, because I do 
want to highlight those things that we 
do together not in a partisan way but 
in 
a 
‘‘let’s-get-something-done-to-
gether way’’, I include in the RECORD 
the letter. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, July 20, 2020. 
Hon. WILLIAM P. BARR, 
Attorney General, Department of Justice, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR: Thank you 
for featuring the quote ‘‘Coronavirus is no 
excuse for hate’’ on the Department of Jus-
tice’s hate crimes website. The COVID–19 
pandemic affects all Americans and has 
wrought enormous pain in the United States. 
Some Americans are facing increased dis-
crimination as a result of the pandemic. We 
write to draw particular attention to an in-
crease in verbal and physical attacks as well 
as discrimination towards Asian Americans 
who have been wrongly blamed for the virus’ 
spread. We respectfully request that you 
publicly condemn acts of anti-Asian bias, 
and provide us with regular status updates 
regarding the steps the Department of Jus-
tice is taking and will take going forward to 
combat this behavior. 
Asian Americans are not responsible for 
the spread of coronavirus in the United 
States; yet, since the start of the pandemic 
they have experienced continued harass-
ment, violence, and discrimination. As of 
June 3, the Asian Pacific Policy and Plan-
ning Council reported 2,066 incidents of 
coronavirus-related 
discrimination. 
These 
and numerous news reports have documented 
cases ranging from the denial of services at 
stores to verbal harassment on the subway 
to physical assaults. 
In one particularly egregious instance, an 
individual in Texas stabbed three Asian 
Americans, two of whom were children, be-
cause he thought they were infecting others 
with COVID–19. In March, the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation’s Houston field office 
acknowledged the likelihood of a surge in 
hate crime incidents against Asian Ameri-
cans. And most recently, a new Ipsos survey 
conducted for the Center for Public Integrity 
found that more than 30 percent of Ameri-
cans have witnessed someone blaming Asian 
people for the coronavirus pandemic. 
We appreciate the op-ed the Department 
placed in the Washington Examiner gen-
erally stating that hate crimes will be inves-
tigated and prosecuted. However, the dan-
gers faced by the Asian American commu-
nity today are very real and deserve a strong 
and specific response by our government. In 
fact, on May 8, the U.S. Commission on Civil 
Rights acknowledged its concerns ‘‘over the 
increase in xenophobic animosity toward 
Asian Americans (and perceived Asian Amer-
icans) as a result of the COVID–19 pandemic’’ 
and unanimously issued recommendations 
urging federal agencies reduce this senti-
ment. 
We note that in the early 2000s during the 
severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, 
the Bush Administration immediately took 
steps to prevent discrimination against 
Asian Americans by creating a community 
outreach team to monitor and document 
acts of anti-Asian bias and engage with the 
community. 
Two years earlier following the September 
11 terrorist attacks, the Administration had 
similarly sought to prevent attacks against 
Arab, Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian Amer-
ican communities by engaging with commu-
nity leaders, conducting coordinated civil 
rights enforcement, and speaking out force-
fully. While these prior responses were not 
perfect, they represented an important effort 
to acknowledge and address the specific dis-
crimination. 
Despite the fear present within the com-
munity, each and every day Asian Americans 
help to combat COVID–19. While Asian 
Americans comprise 7 percent of the U.S. 
population, 17.1 percent of active medical 
physicians are Asian American. Similarly, 
Asian Americans are serving our country by 
working as nurses, health aides, and in many 
other essential occupations. Asian Ameri-
cans are just as American as any other group 
of people in our country. 
We respectfully request that you, as head 
of the Department of Justice, forcefully con-
demn anti-Asian bias to send an unambig-
uous message to all Americans that discrimi-
nation against this community is un-Amer-
ican and will not be tolerated. Further, we

Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, the At-
torney General, I have no doubt, feels 
exactly the same way about this as Ms. 
SCANLON and I do, as Mr. LIEU and Ms. 
CHU do. And that is why I am saddened 
that we have a resolution before us 
today that includes these ‘‘whereases’’ 
that make it difficult to take ‘‘yes’’ for 
an answer. 
Mr. Speaker, I want you to remember 
that we had a very similar conversa-
tion with H. Res. 576 last year. That 
was the resolution asking that the 
whistleblower’s complaint be provided 
to Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I went up to the Rules 
Committee on that afternoon last 
spring, and the conversation was the 
Trump administration is derelict, it is 
full of scoundrels, all of these bad 
things are going on, and we demand the 
whistleblower’s report. 
Mr. Speaker, well, what are we sup-
posed to do with that? As Article I 
says, we are entitled to the whistle-
blower’s report, and we made a rec-
ommendation to the chairman of the 
Rules Committee at that time and to 
the House leadership to give us an op-
portunity to speak with one Article I 
voice on whether or not the House is 
entitled to see a whistleblower’s re-
port. 
We said, ‘‘Please, take out these par-
tisan jabs and let’s just get to the 
heart of the matter and get access to 
those documents that we want. In the 
chairman’s wisdom, and in the Speak-
er’s wisdom, they took that advice. A 
resolution that had been on its way to 
being whipped ‘‘no’’ from the Repub-
lican side of the aisle, came back and 
passed with absolutely no dissent when 
we decided to spend less time poking 
one another and more time trying to 
make progress together. 
Mr. Speaker, we have that oppor-
tunity again today, and I hope we will 
take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer. This is obvi-
ously an election year, an opportunity 
to get off the rails on partisan rhetoric 
from time to time, but we all know 
that we speak with a stronger voice 
when we speak with one voice here in 
this institution, and we have that op-
portunity to find that space in H. Res. 
908. 
Mr. Speaker, finally, the last bill in 
this very long rule, is H.R. 2574, a 
measure that purports to strengthen 
Federal civil rights laws in educational 
settings, creating a private right of ac-
tion on the theory of disparate impact. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I hope it surprises 
you, as it surprises me, that we are 
talking about a fundamental change in 
American civil jurisprudence, and this 
bill didn’t go through the Committee 
on the Judiciary at all. Now, again, it 
purports to change the laws it relates 
to educational settings, but, of course, 
in fact, changes the law across the en-
tire spectrum of civil litigation and not 
one opportunity for the Committee on 
the Judiciary to be heard. 
Now, I talked about principle com-
promise and not seeking the lowest 
common denominator. I don’t want to 
pretend that it will be an easy thing to 
find that common ground on disparate 
impact litigation. Litigation is some-
thing that divides this House time and 
time again, and it takes serious people, 
which is why serious men and women, 
like my friend from Pennsylvania, find 
themselves on the Committee on the 
Judiciary. It is not an easy path to 
find. But for not one opportunity—and 
we asked the Judiciary chairman about 
that yesterday, Mr. Speaker—and he 
said he looked at the Committee on 
Education’s 
work 
product 
and 
he 
thought it was appropriate. Well, I am 
glad that he does not feel undermined 
by being completely left out of changes 
in judicial procedure in the United 
States of America. I would feel that 
way if I were chairman of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. But even if he 
doesn’t feel left out, even if he thinks 
that is good enough, I have got dozens 
and dozens of Members who are on the 
Committee on the Judiciary who were 
placed on that committee because of 
their expertise in that area, who have 
been placed on the Committee on the 
Judiciary because of their thoughtful-
ness in this area. And I think America 
would benefit, not be burdened, by hav-
ing an opportunity for those voices to 
be heard. 
Again, if your position is ‘‘let’s pass 
bills in the House and thank ourselves, 
congratulate 
ourselves 
for 
passing 
something in the House,’’ we have got 
exactly the right bill before us today. 
If our position is, we want to make a 
difference for the men and women that 
we serve—and I say, ‘‘if our position 
is’’—Mr. Speaker, I take that back. I 
shouldn’t have even said that, because 
I am certain, knowing each one of my 
colleagues as I do, that it is their posi-
tion that they didn’t come here to 
make a statement, that they did come 
here to make a difference. I want it to 
come to fruition that we can make 
that partnership progress together. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat this rule, 
we are going to have that opportunity. 
I am not talking about an opportunity 
to quash any of these bills. I am talk-
ing about an opportunity to perfect 
these bills in those ways that I have 
mentioned, not so that they go to the 
Senate and die, not so that they re-
ceive a veto threat from the White 
House, but so that they go to the Sen-
ate and pass, so that they receive the 
President’s signature, and so that they 
make the difference that each one of 
the men and women in this Chamber 
were sent here to do. 
Mr. Speaker, we are close to that 
today, and I believe if we defeat the 
rule, we can get that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my learned colleague for his input. It 
certainly would be refreshing to see 
anything pass the Senate these days. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 31⁄2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MCGOVERN), 
the 
distinguished 
chairman of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished member of the 
Rules Committee, Ms. SCANLON, for 
yielding me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of good 
things included in this rule. I want to 
discuss one in particular today: H. Res. 
908—condemning all forms of anti- 
Asian sentiment as related to COVID– 
19.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4396 
September 15, 2020 
This resolution is about our values; 
not our Democratic values, not our Re-
publican values, it is about our Amer-
ican values. 
Look, I understand that politics can 
be contentious. The rhetoric can get 
heated. But what we are talking about 
here is something else altogether. 
Anti-Asian rhetoric crosses a line that 
should never be crossed. 
The Asian-American community is 
an integral part of our society. It is an 
important part of my community in 
Massachusetts. These are our neigh-
bors, our friends, and our family. And 
the hateful rhetoric that we are hear-
ing directed towards them during this 
pandemic is unacceptable. It has led to 
an uptick in physical attacks, verbal 
assaults, and online harassment. Hate 
crimes against Asian Americans are on 
the rise. 
Mr. Speaker, this is the antithesis of 
what the United States of America 
stands for. During difficult times, our 
Nation comes together. We don’t allow 
offensive rhetoric to tear us apart, no 
matter who says it. We are nearing 
200,000 lives lost in this country be-
cause of the coronavirus. Countless 
more are sick. Businesses have closed, 
our economy is struggling. 
Mr. Speaker, the world has changed. 
But one thing that is not and will not 
change is our obligation to be there for 
each other, to treat others as we would 
want to be treated. To show those 
around us the dignity and respect and 
the basic human decency that we 
would want them to show us—pan-
demic or no pandemic. 
To pretend that these hateful words 
about Asian Americans don’t matter is 
to kid yourself. Just ask those who 
have been on the receiving end. Or ask 
the groups that monitor hate-inspired 
discrimination. They tell us that there 
were more than 2,100 anti-Asian-Amer-
ican hate incidents in this country re-
lated to this pandemic between March 
and June. I shudder to think what the 
number has grown to today. 
No one should be forced to endure 
such hate and violence. Asian Ameri-
cans are struggling under the weight of 
this pandemic, just like everyone else. 
They are doctors and nurses and first 
responders—just like everyone else. I 
know that in politics our values don’t 
always align, but on this, Democrats 
and Republicans should agree. Some 
things go beyond partisanship. They 
speak to who we are as a Nation and 
what we are willing to tolerate. 
Mr. Speaker, I am hoping for a strong 
bipartisan vote on this resolution be-
cause this country should always stand 
as an inclusive and just society. And as 
elected officials, that starts with us. 
We must lead by example. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
on both sides to support this rule and 
the underlying measures. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t disagree with a 
word my friend from Massachusetts 
had to say, and, in fact, I want to 
thank him for joining the letter that 
we led on this very topic in a bipar-
tisan way earlier this year. And I do 
not believe I am speaking out of turn. 
If the gentleman will partner with me 
for 
stripping 
out 
the 
political 
‘‘whereases’’ in this resolution, I am 
certain not only will we get a bipar-
tisan vote, we will get a huge bipar-
tisan vote in the same way that we did 
when you followed that same good ad-
vice that I gave about this time last 
year. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will amend the rule to 
make in order H.R. 1325, the Protect 
and Serve Act, and H.R. 8251. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD 
immediately prior to the vote on the 
previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, these 
measures before us today are critically 
important. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHER-
FORD), a gentleman who can speak to 
these critically important issues with 
not just his words, but with a lifetime 
of service. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my good friend and neighbor 
from Georgia for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand up 
for the lives of our Nation’s law en-
forcement officers. I spent over 40 
years of my life in law enforcement, in-
cluding 12 as sheriff. I dedicated my 
life to protecting minorities in Florida 
communities and doing my absolute 
best to ensure that all of my officers 
went home safely to their families. 
Sadly, we still lost good men and 
women in the line of duty. And there is 
no doubt that law enforcement is a 
dangerous profession, and every officer 
that puts on that badge knows the risk 
that they take. But one thing is cer-
tain, these risks are growing signifi-
cantly—increased, thanks to the grow-
ing anti-police rhetoric we are seeing 
across the country, making their jobs 
more dangerous now than ever before. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the pre-
vious question so that we can consider 
H.R. 1325, the Protect and Serve Act. 
The lead cosponsor of my legislation is 
Congresswoman VAL DEMINGS, a career 
police officer and former Orlando po-
lice chief. It is not a controversial bill, 
and it is one that many, many, of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
support. In fact, last Congress, this bill 
overwhelming passed the House by a 
vote of 382–35. 
Like 
Congresswoman 
DEMINGS, 
I 
know what officers go through every 
day when they put on their uniform, 
say goodbye to their families, and head 
out to do the important work of pro-
tecting our communities. 
Recently, we have seen an undeniable 
increase in violent attacks against po-
lice officers, especially using ambush- 
style attacks. Just this weekend, we 
saw two Los Angeles police officers 
shot in cold blood while simply sitting 
in their vehicle. But then, when being 
transported to the hospital for life-
saving treatment, the doors to that 
hospital were blocked—blocked by pro-
testers chanting, ‘‘We hope they die. 
We hope they die.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, in Gilchrist 
County, Florida, two deputies were as-
sassinated while simply eating lunch. 
This year, 24 police officers have been 
ambushed, and 7 of them died because 
of the attacks. 
This is why we must defeat the pre-
vious question and consider the Pro-
tect and Serve Act. This is bipartisan 
legislation that will enact the strong-
est penalties for anyone who decides to 
target and harm not only Federal offi-
cers, but also, in some cases, State and 
local officers. 
Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle have ex-
pressed shock over the recent police 
shootings. I now ask that you translate 
those statements of shock into action 
and show America that attacks on law 
enforcement will not be tolerated. 
Please stand with Congresswoman 
DEMINGS and I in supporting the Pro-
tect and Serve Act. 
b 1100 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we have been talking 
about shared American values. Cer-
tainly, one of our strongest shared 
American values is that we condemn 
violence, particularly violence against 
our law enforcement officers. That is 
not open to question. What happened in 
California this past week is horrific, 
and we all condemn that. 
But that is not what we are talking 
about here. What we are talking about 
is an attempt to hijack the rule that 
we are here to debate. 
I mean, I have just listened to a very 
eloquent argument by the gentleman 
from Georgia about the need for bills 
to go through regular order and to fol-
low the process. If these are the non-
controversial items, as warranted by 
my colleagues, then they can go 
through the suspension process. 
We just voted on two suspension bills 
last night. We can do more. We can be 
here longer than anticipated if the 
news I am reading is correct. So, let 
them go through the suspension proc-
ess. Let them be marked up. 
Let’s get back to the business of why 
we are here today and the four bills 
that are under consideration as part of 
this rule. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
MATSUI), another distinguished mem-
ber of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of a rule providing for 
consideration of several bills that will 
support pregnant women in the work-
place and reaffirm our shared commit-
ment to equity and diversity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4397 
September 15, 2020 
Of these important bills, one stands 
out as personal to me: the resolution 
condemning all forms of anti-Asian 
sentiment related to COVID–19. 
For many Asian Americans across 
this country, the harmful rhetoric 
from the highest officials of our land is 
a painful reminder of our yet unreal-
ized potential as a Nation. This pain is 
informed by our lived experiences. 
For me, having been born in a Japa-
nese-American 
internment 
camp, 
I 
learned from my parents and grand-
parents the dangers of governing with 
fear and hatred, not acceptance and 
unity. 
If our country is to successfully con-
tain the spread of this deadly virus, the 
Federal Government must demonstrate 
that every single American is valued 
and that their stories and lives matter. 
Americans of all backgrounds deserve 
to know that their government holds a 
fundamental dedication to their well- 
being. 
However, when our leaders use lan-
guage that undermines our collective 
resolve, it diminishes public trust, un-
dercuts public health, and harms fami-
lies. This rhetoric does not align with 
the values we work to instill in our 
children, and it has no place in Amer-
ica today. 
This is an important statement for 
this Chamber to make, and I look for-
ward to a vote on the House floor soon. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the words 
of my friend from California. What 
makes this institution strong is so 
many of those experiences that each 
one of us brings from our lives. 
Again, we have an opportunity to 
speak with exactly the one voice that 
my friend asks us to if we can simply 
remove the partisanship from this reso-
lution and make it the condemning res-
olution that it should absolutely be. 
Along those lines, Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to yield 4 minutes to my 
friend from Missouri to talk about, 
again, not hijacking the rule by defeat-
ing the previous question, but simply 
adding to what is already a very long 
rule, two additional bipartisan meas-
ures that won’t just be statements, Mr. 
Speaker. They will be opportunities to 
move through the Senate and on to the 
President’s desk. 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER). 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend, a ranking member of 
the Rules Committee, for his support 
and his friendship for so very many 
years and for his fight for this cause in 
this Chamber and for his constituents 
in Georgia. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on 
my colleagues to defeat the previous 
question and bring up my legislation, 
H.R. 8251, which would ensure that all 
Americans can access hospitals and ur-
gent medical care without fear of life- 
threatening delays due to violence and 
extremism. 
My legislation would prohibit inten-
tionally blocking hospital entries or 
exits by force, threat of force, or phys-
ical obstruction in order to injure, in-
timidate, or interfere with any person 
who is trying to obtain and provide 
lifesaving medical procedures or treat-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I am outraged that the 
irrational and unconscionable hatred 
directed at the brave men and women 
of our Nation’s law enforcement re-
sulted in the attempted assassination 
of two innocent deputies and the reck-
less endangerment of those in need of 
urgent medical care. 
On September 12, a gunman at-
tempted to execute two Los Angeles 
Sheriff’s deputies, Claudia Apolinar, a 
31-year-old single mother, and her 24- 
year-old partner, simply because they 
wore the uniform, simply because they 
were called to serve and to protect 
American neighborhoods. 
This was a chilling and senseless act 
of brutality that we are seeing all over 
our country. Instead of turning to heal-
ing, protestors chose to endanger the 
lives of those in need of immediate 
medical care by actually blocking the 
entrance to the hospital where the dep-
uties were receiving critical care and 
chanting, ‘‘We hope they die,’’ and, 
‘‘Death to police.’’ 
‘‘We hope they die,’’ and, ‘‘Death to 
police.’’ 
The courageous men and women of 
our law enforcement are selfless public 
servants, Mr. Speaker. Every day, they 
choose to risk their lives to protect us. 
It is unconscionable that their sac-
rifices are being repaid with targeted 
violence and hatred. It is equally un-
conscionable that protestors would pre-
vent innocent Americans from receiv-
ing lifesaving care by blocking hospital 
entrances. 
I call on my colleagues—I implore 
my colleagues—for us to come together 
to defeat the previous question. Stand 
with our men and women in blue. 
Stand for what is right and just in our 
country. Stand for humanity and sup-
port my legislation. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, we are 
prepared to close if the gentleman from 
Georgia has no further speakers. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, we have 
no further speakers. I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
I can’t say it any better than my 
friends from Missouri and Florida have 
just said it. 
My colleague from Pennsylvania is 
absolutely right, Mr. Speaker. We have 
a regular order process. Here we are, 
halfway through September. We are 
back for our first day of session this 
month. I wish we were here more. I 
wish there was more work going on. I 
wish there was less campaigning and 
more working together, but there sim-
ply isn’t. 
The previous question is an oppor-
tunity, Mr. Speaker, to add things to 
the rule. You can use it to hijack the 
rule. You can use it to take down the 
rule. That is not what we are doing 
today. What we are asking, Mr. Speak-
er, is to add two commonsense, bipar-
tisan bills. 
Mr. Speaker, you heard the argu-
ments from the gentleman from Flor-
ida and the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri. Did you object to a single word 
that they had to say? Did you find one 
bit of partisanship or disagreement in 
their words? You did not. 
The question isn’t are we going to 
get some Democratic votes to defeat 
the previous question and add these 
two bills. We are. We absolutely are be-
cause these are bipartisan ideas. The 
question isn’t if we are going to get 
them. The question is: Are we going to 
get enough? 
The truth is, Mr. Speaker, the ques-
tion isn’t if their words ring true with 
you. The question is, knowing that 
their words rang true with you, will 
you add your vote to theirs? I am ask-
ing you to do that. I am asking my 
friend from Pennsylvania to do that. I 
am asking my friends from Massachu-
setts and California to do that. 
I opened the debate today, Mr. 
Speaker, telling you we were so close 
to what I believe every man and 
woman in this Chamber come here to 
do, and that is work together, not to 
pick a fight, not to make an argument, 
but to make a difference. With some 
minor, minor tweaks, we can do that 
with every single piece of legislation 
that my friends in the majority want 
to bring forward today. 
With just one vote to defeat the pre-
vious question, Mr. Speaker, and no 
tweaks at all, we can do that with the 
two measures that the gentlewoman 
from Missouri and the gentleman from 
Florida have put before us here today. 
Mr. Speaker, vote with me. Defeat 
the previous question. Let’s move for-
ward to speak with one voice, not just 
to condemn anti-American sentiment, 
not just to protect pregnant women in 
the workplace, but to stand behind the 
public safety officers, the men and 
women in this country who show up 
every day of the week for us. 
I ask my colleagues to defeat the pre-
vious question. In the absence of that, 
let’s defeat the rule and follow exactly 
the advice my friend from Pennsyl-
vania suggested, take all of these bills 
back to committee and bring them 
back out one more time. It doesn’t 
have to be that way. We can move for-
ward today. 
Mr. Speaker, I do encourage my col-
leagues to defeat the previous question, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
We are in the midst of some of our 
country’s most challenging times. Mil-
lions of Americans are facing eviction. 
They are food insecure. They don’t 
know where their next paycheck is 
going to come from. 200,000 Americans 
have died, and that number is likely to 
double by the end of this year. We have 
a President wholly indifferent to the 
pandemic, other than its impact on his

political future, and Senate leaders 
aiding him every step of the way. 
Months ago, the House passed the 
HEROES Act, which would be a lifeline 
to the people we serve. However, that 
bill remains untouched on Senator 
MCCONNELL’s desk, with hundreds of 
others. 
Included in that bill are lifelines for 
small business and working Americans, 
critical aid to State and local govern-
ments just trying to keep the lights on 
and to defend our citizens against the 
pandemic when national leadership is 
so lacking, and much-needed money 
that would go a long way to developing 
a vaccine for COVID–19. 
The HEROES Act is money for our 
healthcare providers, our schools, our 
caretakers, and essential workers. It is 
a dereliction of duty for the Senate to 
refuse to engage in good faith on this 
critical legislation, and the American 
people will remember. 
But while this bill remains in Sen-
ator MCCONNELL’s legislative grave-
yard, we will continue to push for the 
protections that Americans need, de-
serve, and are calling out for. Each of 
the four pieces of legislation in our 
rule today will help our country and 
Americans all over. 
From the beginning of the 116th Con-
gress, this House has shown that it is 
up to the task of legislating for the 
people while exercising oversight and 
other critical constitutional duties. 
While we have passed critical COVID– 
19-related legislation, we will not stop 
passing the legislation necessary to 
make this country a more equitable 
place for all Americans. We won’t stop 
working for the American people, de-
spite attacks by those who would pre-
fer to posture. 
There is no place for violence against 
law enforcement. There is no place for 
violence against our fellow citizens, 
whether that violence comes from the 
left or the right. There is no place for 
discrimination. Most of all, there is no 
place for stoking division between 
Americans, and we will beat that back 
at every opportunity. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1107 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 9. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 1325) to amend title 18, United States 
Code, to punish criminal offenses targeting 
law enforcement officers, and for other pur-
poses. The first reading of the bill shall be 
dispensed with. All points of order against 
consideration of the bill are waived. General 
debate shall be confined to the bill and shall 
not exceed one hour equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on the Judiciary. 
After general debate the bill shall be consid-
ered for amendment under the five-minute 
rule. All points of order against provisions in 
the bill are waived. When the committee 
rises and reports the bill back to the House 
with a recommendation that the bill do pass, 
the previous question shall be considered as 
ordered on the bill and amendments thereto 
to final passage without intervening motion 
except one motion to recommit with or with-
out instructions. If the Committee of the 
Whole rises and reports that it has come to 
no resolution on the bill, then on the next 
legislative day the House shall, immediately 
after the third daily order of business under 
clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Com-
mittee of the Whole for further consideration 
of the bill. 
SEC. 10. Immediately after disposition of 
H.R. 1325, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 8251) to amend title 18, United States 
Code, to prohibit preventing access to life-
saving medical procedures and treatments, 
and for other purposes. The first reading of 
the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. General debate shall be confined to 
the bill and shall not exceed one hour equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Committee 
on the Judiciary. After general debate the 
bill shall be considered for amendment under 
the five-minute rule. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill are waived. 
When the committee rises and reports the 
bill back to the House with a recommenda-
tion that the bill do pass, the previous ques-
tion shall be considered as ordered on the 
bill and amendments thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except one mo-
tion to recommit with or without instruc-
tions. If the Committee of the Whole rises 
and reports that it has come to no resolution 
on the bill, then on the next legislative day 
the House shall, immediately after the third 
daily order of business under clause 1 of rule 
XIV, resolve into the Committee of the 
Whole for further consideration of the bill. 
SEC. 11. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 1325 and 
H.R. 8251. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 219, nays

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 2639,

SEC. 11. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) COVERED
SCHOOL.—The term ‘‘covered 
school’’ means— 
(A) a publicly-funded early childhood edu-
cation program; 
(B) a public elementary school; or 
(C) a public secondary school. 
(2) ELIGIBLE ENTITY.—The term ‘‘eligible enti-
ty’’ means a local educational agency, a consor-
tium of such agencies, an educational service 
agency, or regional educational agency that at 
the time of the application of such eligible entity 
has significant achievement gaps and socio-
economic or racial segregation within or be-
tween the school districts served by such entity. 
(3) ESEA TERMS.—The terms ‘‘educational 
service agency’’, ‘‘elementary school’’, ‘‘local 
educational agency’’, ‘‘secondary school’’, and 
‘‘Secretary’’ have the meanings given such terms 
in section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801). 
(4) PUBLICLY-FUNDED EARLY CHILDHOOD EDU-
CATION
PROGRAM.—The term ‘‘publicly-funded 
early childhood education program’’ means an 
early childhood education program (as defined 
in section 103(8) of the Higher Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 1003(8)) that receives State or 
Federal funds. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, is debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
Labor. 
The gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. 
FUDGE) and the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Ohio. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, racial segregation in 
public education has been illegal for 
more than 66 years in the United 
States. Still, American public schools 
are more segregated today than at any 
time since the 1960s. The average Afri-
can-American or Latino student at-
tends schools with a majority of chil-
dren of their own race. 
Most of these schools serve a high 
number of low-income students forced 
to learn in old, broken-down buildings 
with fewer resources and disproportion-
ately high rates of discipline. 
Segregated schools are inherently 
unequal, creating barriers for the stu-
dents who reside in underserved com-
munities. It has been 66 years since the 
landmark decision in Brown v. Board of 
Education, and the promise of equal ac-
cess to education has yet to be real-
ized. 
Today, public schools are not seg-
regated because the law requires it, 
they are segregated by their ZIP Codes. 
Segregation exists due to the erosion 
of a middle-class tax base. An erosion 
that has caused communities of color 
to become systemically poor. Essential 
services and public education are con-
tinuously underfunded. 
These communities have been denied 
access to the intergenerational wealth 
that comes from homeownership due to 
discriminatory housing patterns and 
mortgage lending policies. This is par-
ticularly true for Black communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4402 
September 15, 2020 
When districts split schools between af-
fluent 
and 
poor 
neighborhoods, 
it 
draws a bright line between the haves 
and the have-nots. This type of separa-
tion inflicts the same harm on students 
today as legalized segregation did prior 
to 1954. 
That is why I introduced H.R. 2639, 
the Strength in Diversity Act. It di-
rectly addresses inequities in public 
education by authorizing funding to 
support local education leaders in their 
efforts to lessen racial and socio-
economic isolation in public schools. 
The Strength in Diversity Act will 
ensure every student has equitable ac-
cess to a quality education. This is one 
step toward remedying the issue of seg-
regated schools. 
The bill provides support for school 
districts that are developing, expand-
ing, or implementing school diversity 
initiatives. 
Eligible school districts can devote 
funding to study the adverse effects of 
segregation, provide equitable access 
to transportation, create programs to 
attract children from neighboring com-
munities, and recruit new specialized 
teachers. 
Studies show school integration ben-
efits students of all races. Even the 
conservative think tank, the Hoover 
Institution, agrees that diverse learn-
ing 
environments 
help 
close 
the 
achievement gap and lead to numerous 
academic, social and cognitive bene-
fits. Research tells us school integra-
tion results in cross-racial friendships 
and a decline in stereotyping, allowing 
students to better navigate an increas-
ingly diverse society and preparing 
them for real world experiences. 
Mr. Speaker, the Strength in Diver-
sity Act is not new policy. It is prac-
tically the same policy the Obama ad-
ministration sought to pursue in its 
2016 Opening Doors, Expanding Oppor-
tunities program, which provided $12 
million to help school districts in-
crease diversity. 
Nearly 30 school districts from 22 
States and the District of Columbia ap-
plied for the Obama-era integration 
grant, but the program was eliminated 
by the current administration in 2017 
without explanation. That decision 
came at a time when research clearly 
showed a resurgence in segregated 
schools. 
Totally ignoring this increase in sep-
arate educational facilities, Education 
Secretary Betsy DeVos moved to re-
scind Federal guidance to assist school 
districts in pursuit of racial diversity. 
When my Education and Labor Com-
mittee colleague Representative TRONE 
asked the Secretary about this rescis-
sion, she said she was ‘‘unfamiliar with 
the guidance.’’ That was 2 years ago. 
Since then, things have gotten worse, 
not better. 
Mr. Speaker, we are experiencing a 
racial reckoning in this country. De-
spite efforts from 1600 Pennsylvania 
Avenue to sow racial division, I remain 
hopeful. 
Now 
is 
the 
time 
to 
enact 
the 
Strength in Diversity Act and provide 
school districts with the support they 
need to tackle the task of true integra-
tion. 
This is hard work, but necessary 
work, and it is past time the Federal 
Government support local leaders to 
fulfill the promise of Brown. 
Today, I urge my colleagues to make 
a commitment to put an end to racial 
and socioeconomic isolation and seg-
regation in our Nation’s public schools 
by voting in favor of the Strength in 
Diversity Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 
2639, the Strength in Diversity Act. 
Republicans and Democrats agree 
that discrimination and State-sanc-
tioned segregation are repugnant, ille-
gal, and blatantly immoral. Studies 
have shown that integrated schools 
promote greater understanding, toler-
ance, and improved educational out-
comes. 
I don’t disagree with the intentions 
behind this bill but have major reserva-
tions about its efficacy. Will this bill 
stand the test of time? Will these ideas 
have helped the ongoing effort to 
achieve greater equality for children? 
Sadly, the answer is no. 
The Education and Labor Committee 
has a long history of reaching across 
the aisle and finding common ground 
to effect meaningful reform for our Na-
tion’s schools and students. 
The legislation before us today was 
another opportunity for committee Re-
publicans and Democrats to find bipar-
tisan compromise. Unfortunately, com-
mittee Democrats ignored common-
sense approaches to this problem to 
impose a top-down, Big Government 
mandate that would have the Federal 
Government decide how best to address 
the issues of racial and socioeconomic 
isolation in America’s schools. 
As we have seen many times before, 
additional government mandates and 
burdensome red tape are not the an-
swer. Congress has already set up the 
Student Support and Academic Enrich-
ment Grants, a block grant created to 
give school districts flexibility to pur-
sue local solutions to their commu-
nities’ educational challenges. Local 
and State leaders and those with their 
feet on the ground know how best to 
combat these challenges, not the Fed-
eral Government. 
That is why Representative ALLEN 
will offer a Republican alternative 
later today that will provide this 
House a bipartisan solution that could 
easily garner an overwhelming major-
ity of support in this Chamber if every 
Member chose to focus on the impor-
tance of actually addressing racial and 
socioeconomic isolation in schools. His 
amendment would ensure that nearly 
every school district in the country 
would have the flexibility with Federal 
funds they may need to tackle this 
problem. This is how legislating for so-
lutions, rather than legislating for 
headlines can work. 
Republicans want nothing more than 
to see all American children prosper. 
That means expanding opportunities 
for marginalized students to gain ac-
cess to an education that prepares 
them for lifelong success. It also means 
school districts taking action to reduce 
racial and socioeconomic isolation in 
schools. 
A bipartisan path forward to make 
that possible is achievable, but Demo-
crats 
would 
rather 
score 
political 
points than work with Republicans on 
solutions that will make a significant 
difference in the lives of our Nation’s 
children. 
Instead of building upon a program 
that has bipartisan, bicameral support, 
Democrats’ H.R. 2639 sets up a new 
grant program within the Department 
of Education that will inevitably be 
underfunded, if it is funded at all. 
Creating more government programs 
that have to scramble for funding in 
order to operate successfully is the last 
thing we need to foster the best envi-
ronment for all students to learn. 
H.R. 2639 also ignores the biggest 
problem facing low-income students 
and students of color—a lack of high- 
quality 
educational 
options. 
Com-
mittee Republicans stand ready to 
work with our colleagues in the major-
ity to expand educational opportuni-
ties to all families. But rather than 
bring a bill to the floor that would ex-
pand the availability of charter schools 
or offer marginalized families the kind 
of 
educational 
freedom 
that 
the 
wealthy exercise for themselves, Demo-
crats decided teachers unions are more 
important to them than real families 
who are desperate for access to a better 
education for their children. 
My Republican colleagues and I be-
lieve that expanding opportunities for 
students should be a priority. We know 
school choice gives families the oppor-
tunity to break the cycle of poverty 
and enroll their children in challenging 
environments that better develop their 
skills and intellect, encouraging them 
to reach higher. In fact, studies show 
that when students are given the free-
dom to attend school in a learning en-
vironment best suited to their abili-
ties, they pursue and complete postsec-
ondary opportunities at higher rates. 
Access to opportunities, freedom to 
climb, these are aspects of a student’s 
education that must be equal for all 
children nationwide. No one-size-fits- 
all structure can deliver on those es-
sentials. Separate was never equal, but 
equality cannot simply mean uni-
formity if that uniformity doesn’t pre-
pare students for lifelong success. 
Equality is affirming that all children 
are fundamentally the same in dignity, 
importance, and worth but also under-
standing that not all children’s needs 
are the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I think 
that we all want commonsense solu-
tions, but as proven by Secretary

September 15, 2020 
DeVos, common sense is not always 
common, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 41⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT), the chair of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of the Strength in Di-
versity Act. 
It has been 66 years since the Su-
preme Court unanimously struck down 
public school segregation in the land-
mark case of Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation. In that case, the Court declared 
that public education where the State 
has undertaken to provide it, is a right 
which must be made available to all on 
equal terms. 
The Court went on to say that, ‘‘in 
the field of public education, the doc-
trine of ‘separate but equal’ has no 
place. Separate educational facilities 
are inherently unequal.’’ 
More than six decades later, we have 
failed to fulfill that promise. According 
to the Government Accountability Of-
fice, our public schools are more seg-
regated today by race and class than at 
any time since the 1960s, and segrega-
tion is actually getting worse accord-
ing to the Government Accountability 
Office. 
b 1330 
School segregation has profound con-
sequences for students. Today, low-in-
come students of color are more likely 
to attend schools with fewer experi-
enced teachers and resources. In fact, 
schools 
serving 
predominantly 
stu-
dents of color face a $23 billion funding 
gap compared to schools serving pre-
dominantly White students. 
Now, 
we 
know 
that 
integration 
works. Black students who attend inte-
grated schools have higher test scores 
and are more likely to graduate from 
high school, complete college, and even 
earn higher wages throughout their 
lives. 
Communities 
across 
the 
country 
have recognized the importance of 
school diversity for student success 
and have developed integrative strate-
gies to promote diversity in education. 
In 2016, dozens of school districts ap-
plied for funding under the Opening 
Doors, Expanding Opportunities grant 
program, which was designed to help 
schools to pursue voluntary, commu-
nity-driven school integration strate-
gies. Regrettably, one of Secretary 
Betsy DeVos’ first actions in office was 
to terminate that program before any 
money was disbursed. 
The Strength in Diversity Act cor-
rects this action by providing Federal 
support to help school districts de-
velop, implement, or expand efforts to 
integrate their local schools. 
The legislation will also shield these 
resources from the whims of changing 
administrations 
and 
allow 
commu-
nities to compile best practices for 
tackling segregation. 
This expertise is critical because of a 
series of Supreme Court rulings that 
have been hostile to integration. Most 
recently, in the Parents Involved case, 
the Court struck down two voluntary 
integration plans, one in Louisville, 
Kentucky, and the other in Seattle, 
Washington. The Court held that using 
race in desegregation plans is constitu-
tional, but only if the plan is narrowly 
tailored to address the compelling in-
terest of integrating the public schools. 
Unfortunately, they ruled in those 
cases that the plans were not narrowly 
tailored. 
The Strength in Diversity Act will 
provide resources so that the localities 
will be able to design plans that will be 
not only effective, but also be able to 
withstand constitutional challenge. 
Addressing America’s legacy of racial 
discrimination is often uncomfortable 
and complicated. However, we must 
confront, not ignore, inequities in edu-
cation if we are to reckon with this 
legacy and overcome a global pandemic 
that threatens to worsen the achieve-
ment gaps. 
Our former colleague, Congressman 
John Lewis, once stated: ‘‘When you 
see something that is not right, not 
fair, not just, you have to speak up. 
You have to say something. You have 
to do something.’’ 
Let’s follow his guidance and vote for 
the first time in more than three dec-
ades to provide new resources that will 
help integrate our public schools and 
fulfill the promise of equity in edu-
cation. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support the Strength in Di-
versity Act. I thank the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. FUDGE) for her distin-
guished leadership in this legislation. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE), my good friend. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
first, let me just thank the gentle-
woman from Ohio (Ms. FUDGE) for 
yielding and for her tremendous leader-
ship on behalf of our children, but also 
for demonstrating what strength in di-
versity means throughout her life’s 
work. I thank her for bringing this 
Strength in Diversity bill to the floor, 
H.R. 2639. 
Let me just say a couple of things. 
First of all, this bill takes action where 
Secretary DeVos and the administra-
tion have failed to act to make sure 
that all of our children, no matter 
what color they are, get the same op-
portunities to get an education and 
pursue their dreams. We have had this 
discussion over and over and over again 
in the Appropriations Committee with 
the Secretary. 
Sixty years ago, Ruby Bridges was 
the first African-American student to 
attend an integrated school in the 
South. Yes, as has been said by our 
chair and also the gentlewoman au-
thoring this bill, this is 66 years after 
Brown v. Board of Education. 
We still have segregation in our 
school districts, and it is leading to 
measurably unjust outcomes for Black 
and Brown students, robbing them of 
their future. 
Now, when I started school, mind 
you, schools were segregated. My fam-
ily in El Paso, Texas, fought to deseg-
regate schools, especially my beloved 
mother, Mildred Parish Massey, who 
was one of the first students to inte-
grate the University of Texas at El 
Paso. 
In addition to the GAO report, a 2019 
report out of Stanford University also 
reviewed hundreds of millions of test 
scores from students across the Nation. 
Their findings show that racial seg-
regation leaves Black and Brown stu-
dents concentrated in high-poverty 
schools, leading to a huge opportunity 
deficit even for high-performing stu-
dents. 
In fact, they found large achievement 
gaps in every single school district 
with just moderately high segregation. 
This fact remains. This data is the 
same. Also, these schools have fewer 
resources, and the students experience 
more disciplinary actions than in more 
diverse schools. 
The Strength in Diversity Act would 
help reverse this segregation by pro-
moting diversity, increasing student 
achievement and readiness, and invest-
ing in our children. 
The bill would authorize Federal 
funding to provide grants to support 
new and existing local efforts to in-
crease racial and socioeconomic diver-
sity in our schools. 
It would further document segrega-
tion in our public schools, implement 
programs to recruit and hire diverse 
teachers, and work to ensure our stu-
dents have equitable access to re-
sources. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman FUDGE for yield-
ing the additional time. 
Let me conclude by saying, in doing 
this, Congresswoman FUDGE and Chair-
man SCOTT have documented this, that 
by having equitable access to re-
sources, we actually found that racial 
prejudice is reduced by making sure 
that our children are in diverse schools 
and classrooms. 
All of our students should receive the 
best education regardless of their race 
and ethnicity. That is what this bill is 
about. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman 
FUDGE, the gentlewoman from Ohio, for 
putting forth this bill, because she 
more than most knows the importance 
of diversity. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman, Ms. FUDGE,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4404 
September 15, 2020 
for allowing me the time. I acknowl-
edge Mr. SCOTT
for the outstanding 
work that he has done on this legisla-
tion, among many other pieces of legis-
lation. 
I have an amendment that speaks for 
itself. This amendment deals with the 
entry exams that fail the diversity test 
at many elite schools—elite schools, by 
the way, that are funded with tax dol-
lars that come from poor communities, 
elite schools that can accept tax dol-
lars but cannot accept the students 
who are from communities that are af-
fording the schools the tax dollars. 
The amendment reads: If applicable— 
meaning if you haven’t done it al-
ready—develop 
an 
implementation 
plan to replace entrance exams or 
other competitive application proce-
dures with methods of student assign-
ments to promote racial and socio-
economic diversity. 
This amendment does deal with mi-
norities, but it also deals with other 
persons who happen to be disadvan-
taged. Mr. Speaker, that is another 
way of saying poor White people. They, 
too, suffer from disadvantages associ-
ated with the elite tests that can fail 
even some of the best that come from 
schools that have little resources. 
I believe that if this amendment is 
passed, this amendment is going to en-
courage schools to do what John Lewis 
would call the right thing, the just 
thing, the fair thing. 
Mr. Speaker, I support the amend-
ment and beg that my colleagues would 
support it as well. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congresswoman FOXX
for yielding. I 
appreciate the opportunity to address 
this issue today. 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 2639, and 
I oppose it because I believe every child 
should have access to a good education. 
I have long advocated for the need to 
expand choice to each student so that 
they have the opportunity to live out 
the American Dream regardless of 
their ZIP Code or family resources. In 
fact, we talked about this very thing 
on the steps of the Capitol this morn-
ing. 
H.R. 2639 is a partisan proposal that 
would impose a top-down, Big Govern-
ment solution—that is the problem— 
allowing the Federal Government to 
decide how best to address the issues of 
racial and socioeconomic isolation in 
America’s schools. 
Unfortunately, this debate is not 
about equality for all children. If it 
were, we would have ensured no State 
had the ability to trap students in low- 
performing schools. 
Rather than bring a bill to the House 
floor that would expand the avail-
ability of charter schools or offer fami-
lies educational freedom, Democrats 
have decided the teachers unions are 
more important to them than real fam-
ilies who are desperate for access to a 
better education for their children. 
Additionally, this partisan proposal 
would create another Federal program 
while ignoring existing priorities. 
During committee markup, I offered 
a substitute amendment to the bill 
that would have expanded the Student 
Support and Academic Enrichment 
Grants, or SSAEG, in the Every Stu-
dent Succeeds Act to allow school dis-
tricts to use funds to reduce or elimi-
nate racial or socioeconomic isolation 
in schools. 
The SSAEG were authorized on a bi-
partisan basis to give school districts 
flexible funding to address local needs 
and receive $1.21 billion in fiscal year 
2020 appropriated funds. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentleman. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, unfortu-
nately, committee Democrats rejected 
my amendment and chose to push for-
ward a partisan bill that would only re-
sult in another broken promise from 
the Federal Government. 
Instead of working in a bipartisan, 
bicameral fashion to implement a com-
monsense solution, Democrats are once 
again choosing partisan political mes-
saging over sound policy. 
It has been a tough year, especially 
on families who have had to adapt to 
learning in the age of coronavirus. So, 
let’s have a real conversation on how 
we can best serve our students and 
families by working to expand choice. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this partisan bill before it is too 
late. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
idea what bill my colleagues are read-
ing. There is nothing in this bill about 
teachers unions or anything else that 
they are talking about. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ADAMS), my colleague, who is also a 
member of the Education and Labor 
Committee. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Ohio 
(Ms. 
FUDGE) for yielding and for her incred-
ible leadership on this issue. 
It has been 66 years since the Brown 
v. Board of Education decision when 
this country took a step toward mak-
ing amends for its legacy of oppression 
and discrimination against African 
Americans. But policymakers haven’t 
always done the work necessary to 
make the promises of Brown a reality. 
After years of gains, the last three 
decades have been marked by increased 
racial isolation for Black and Brown 
students. 
Since 1988, the percentage of schools 
where less than 10 percent of the stu-
dent body is White has increased from 
6 to 18 percent. More than half of our 
Nation’s schoolchildren are in districts 
where over 75 percent of students look 
just like them. 
So, I am happy that today, after 30 
years of backsliding, the House will 
take a vote to live up to the legacy of 
Brown. 
The Strength in Diversity Act is as 
good as its name. It will restore the 
government’s commitment to school 
desegregation and to ensuring that 
every child receives equal opportunity 
because as Brown told us, separate is 
inherently unequal. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
help this Nation live up to those ideals 
by voting in support of the Strength in 
Diversity Act. I thank my colleague 
from Ohio for bringing this bill for-
ward. 
b 1345 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 2639, the 
Strength in Diversity Act. I thank this 
bill’s sponsor, Congresswoman FUDGE, 
and Chairman SCOTT for shepherding 
this bill through the Education and 
Labor Committee. 
Nearly 20 years after Brown v. Board 
of Education, lesser-known Supreme 
Court cases like Milliken v. Bradley 
determined that segregation was al-
lowed, if not considered an explicit pol-
icy, of each school district. 
This meant schools and communities 
were not held responsible for desegre-
gation. Busing policies meant to inte-
grate city and suburban schools were 
abandoned and the inequality created 
by racist redlining and exclusionary 
housing policies continued, keeping 
Black Americans out of the suburbs 
and trapped in underfunded schools to 
this day. Today, the school system at 
the center of Milliken v. Bradley, De-
troit’s, is more segregated than it was 
in 1974. 
This bill will provide grants to im-
prove racial and socioeconomic diver-
sity in public schools, an essential step 
toward fulfilling the promise of Brown 
v. Board, ending the segregation that 
continues to plague school districts 
across this country, including in my 
own district, Michigan’s Ninth. 
Thurgood 
Marshall, 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s first Black Justice, warned in 
his dissent in Milliken v. Bradley, ‘‘un-
less our children begin to learn to-
gether, there is little hope that our 
people will ever learn to live together 
and understand each other.’’ 
As we reckon with our Nation’s past 
and work to dismantle racist institu-
tions that have stood for far too long, 
let us not forget our children. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this 
bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Democrats’ approach in 
H.R. 2639 is wrong for our Nation’s 
schools and students if we hope to 
achieve greater equality for children 
nationwide. Not only does this bill 
push another Democrat-led, top-down, 
Big Government mandate, but it has

also been crafted to mirror a failed 
Obama administration program. 
At the Rules Committee yesterday, 
and also referenced today, Chairman 
SCOTT touted the fact that 30 school 
districts applied under the Opening 
Doors, Expanding Opportunities pro-
gram created during the Obama admin-
istration. For the sake of debate, let’s 
say that half of those school districts 
had been awarded funding. That is only 
15 school districts nationwide that 
would have received Federal funding 
under President Obama’s program that 
this bill is modeled after. 
In contrast to this failed approach, 
Representative ALLEN
will offer an 
amendment that would allow school 
districts to use funds from an existing 
Federal grant program to accomplish 
the same goals as the Democrats’ bill. 
About 12,000 school districts receive 
ESEA block grant funding every year. 
By supporting Representative ALLEN’s 
amendment, we can ensure that nearly 
every school district in the country has 
the flexibility to tackle this problem 
using taxpayer funds at the Federal 
level. This is how legislating for solu-
tions, rather than legislating for head-
lines, can work. 
A high-quality education is an indis-
pensable tool, and America’s children 
deserve nothing less than an education 
that empowers them to reach their 
greatest potential. This bill doesn’t 
move us in that direction. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. SHALALA). 
Ms. SHALALA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2639 and con-
gratulate my fellow Clevelander, Rep-
resentative 
FUDGE, 
and 
Chairman 
SCOTT for their leadership, and all the 
members of the committee on Edu-
cation and Labor who have worked 
tirelessly to get us here today. 
We know that modern school seg-
regation is largely related to housing 
and income segregation, with the worst 
cases concentrated in urban and subur-
ban areas. 
Research shows that schools with a 
large proportion of middle-class White 
students tend to have access to more 
resources. They benefit from chal-
lenging, college-level courses, teachers 
and guidance counselors who can help 
plan for college, and from wide-ranging 
extracurricular activities in sports, the 
arts, and music, all of which greatly 
contribute to a student’s academic 
achievement. 
The impact, however, goes well be-
yond academic opportunities. Children 
who aren’t regularly exposed to people 
from other backgrounds are less likely 
to see racial and economic disparities 
as a problem. 
Diversity, almost everyone agrees, is 
good; inclusion is good; exposure to dif-
ferent cultures and ideas is good. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent 
Miami, a city that values diversity and 
multiculturalism as the backbone of 
our society. 
Miami is the second largest minor-
ity-majority school district in the Na-
tion, where more than 92 percent of the 
students are Black or Hispanic, stu-
dents whose families often escaped po-
litical persecution and extreme pov-
erty. Yet the typical Black or Hispanic 
student 
attends 
an 
underresourced 
school where more than 60 percent of 
other students come from low-income 
families. 
Similarly, schools with large Black 
enrollment don’t excel in State rat-
ings, and Black students are woefully 
underrepresented in the district’s stel-
lar magnet program. 
The grants in H.R. 2639 would fund ef-
forts to explore different approaches to 
integration, recruit or train staff to 
better serve minority students, and en-
gage local communities on specialized 
academic programs. 
If we as policymakers say we have an 
interest in increasing the academic 
success rate for Black and Hispanic 
youth, then we support H.R. 2639. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 2639, the 
Strength in Diversity Act. 
I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
MARCIA 
FUDGE and Chairman BOBBY SCOTT for 
their leadership and for affording me 
the opportunity to speak today, and I 
am proud to support this important 
step toward addressing the legacy of 
segregation in America’s schools. 
‘‘Segregation distorts the soul,’’ Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. wrote in 1936 from 
a Birmingham jail. Yet 66 years after 
the Supreme Court unanimously held 
in Brown v. Board of Education that 
racial segregation of children in public 
schools is unconstitutional, segrega-
tion remains a reality for many of 
America’s children. It is a persistent 
stain on the soul of our country. 
The 
Strength 
in 
Diversity 
Act 
incentivizes inclusive educational envi-
ronments and promotes racial and so-
cioeconomic diversity in schools as in-
strumental to the education and devel-
opment of every single child. This act 
encourages school districts to study 
the effects of segregation, evaluate 
their current policies, and implement 
evidence-based solutions to deepen di-
versity in their schools through inclu-
sive policies. 
We all wish that racism was a thing 
of the past. It is not. We must actively 
confront our Nation’s sins, past and 
present. We must confront the fear and 
the hatred embedded in our institu-
tions, embracing, once and for all, the 
strength of our diversity. 
America can do better for our chil-
dren, and we must. And it is important 
to remember, discrimination robs the 
victim of the ability to become all that 
they can, of their full potential. But it 
also robs the entire community of what 
that person could contribute and do, 
free of the pernicious discrimination 
that is at the heart of this legislation. 
So I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
in support of H.R. 2639. 
I thank Congresswoman FUDGE and 
Chairman SCOTT
for their extraor-
dinary leadership. 
I am really proud that this bill is on 
the floor today, and I hope my Repub-
lican colleagues will embrace their re-
sponsibility to help end racism in this 
country and in our schools and be sure 
that every child in America has the 
same opportunity to realize their full 
potential. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Mrs. BEATTY), my good friend. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my 
good 
friend, 
Congresswoman 
MARCIA FUDGE, for bringing this bill to 
this Chamber. 
I stand here as the chair of the Sub-
committee on Diversity and Inclusion. 
I have probably spent more hours and 
time looking into the difference diver-
sity makes, whether it is a small busi-
ness, whether it is an educational sys-
tem, whether it is a child. 
I remind us to history. In 1960, a lit-
tle Black girl by the name of Ruby 
Bridges was denied the right to enter a 
school—against the Supreme Court of 
this land—by a Governor. 
I stand here on this floor and hear in-
dictments about President Obama. Mr. 
Speaker, let me say to my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle, anything 
that his educational Secretaries did 
was better than what we have now with 
Secretary Betsy DeVos. 
Let me just say that it is so impor-
tant when we think about diversity and 
inclusion and we think about those lit-
tle 
children, 
Black 
children, 
marginalized White children. 
When I look at the votes for what my 
colleagues on the other side have said 
about us—and they don’t vote for budg-
ets; they don’t vote for funding that 
can save lives—their arguments are 
weak. Their arguments are unfounded. 
This bill is about equal opportunity. 
This bill is about removing systemic 
racism. 
We already know that racism is a na-
tional crisis. So when I think of hous-
ing, when I think about feeding a child, 
what kind of Member of Congress 
would stand here against Congress-
woman FUDGE, Congressman BOBBY 
SCOTT, who is the chair of this com-
mittee and has done more in his life-
time on education than anyone who 
has been to this microphone on the 
other side? 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, we all want to create the 
maximum amount of opportunity for 
our children, regardless of their back-
ground. That is why it is unfortunate

that this legislation fails to fix the 
most tragic inequity in our education 
system: the absence of choice. 
The right to a high-quality education 
is fundamental to the promise of Amer-
ica, and no child should be denied that 
right because of income or background. 
Thankfully, President Trump and Re-
publicans in Congress are working to 
provide that opportunity to all fami-
lies. 
I am proud to have introduced the 
CHOICE Act, which creates oppor-
tunity grants that families can use for 
private school tuition, microschools, 
learning 
pods, 
and 
homeschooling 
costs. 
My bill ensures that all families—not 
just those with the means or those 
lucky enough to live in a wealthy 
school district—have access to the best 
possible education for their child. Giv-
ing families this choice is the only way 
to furnish equal access to the Amer-
ican Dream. Republicans are ready to 
take this step. If Democrats join us, we 
can make it a reality.

Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Ohio has 61⁄4 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
North Carolina has 171⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, this legis-
lation, this bill, this movement, and 
this purpose that we are debating 
today really found its genesis long ago 
with a Supreme Court decision in 
Brown v. Board of Education of To-
peka, Kansas, when, on May 17, 1954, 
nine men robed in black assembled not 
far from here to announce on the steps 
their unanimous decision to end seg-
regation in public education. On that 
day, among the Nation’s Black citi-
zens, there was, indeed, a celebration, 
and it was a celebration, indeed, by 
many of its Whites. 
Many of us thought that this decision 
was the launching of the threshold of a 
new era in life when education all 
across this Nation would be treated the 
way it should be for all of its citizens. 
Many people felt in the bowels of their 
being and in their very existence that 
this Nation again at long last would 
find a way to launch itself into a new 
era. 
So this is the manifestation of that 
new era. This legislation extends the 
guarantees, the protections, and the 
expectations of that decision; and it is 
the expectations that we are talking 
about today: to be able to provide the 
kind of education and the kind of 
treatment of education that would ex-
tend to all people, to increase diver-
sity, and to do away with those things 
that have held us back for so many, 
many years. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the spon-
sor of this bill. I urge my colleagues to 
understand her intent and the expecta-
tions that it brings with it so that we 
might do the right thing and pass it. I 
urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote, Mr. Speaker. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, Republicans and Demo-
crats agree that discrimination and 
State-sanctioned segregation are re-
pugnant, illegal, and blatantly im-
moral. 
Action 
must 
be 
taken 
to 
achieve greater equality for our Na-
tion’s students and in our schools. 
We continue to strive toward a future 
where all students, regardless of race 
or color, have the chance to succeed. 
Education and hard work are the paths 
out of poverty for millions, and edu-
cation provides students with the tools 
and skills they need to build a success-
ful life. 
It is disappointing that a bipartisan 
path forward to address these issues 
was possible but not attained because 
of political posturing from Democrats. 
Apparently, political wins are more 
important than building upon bipar-
tisan, bicameral legislative solutions 
that will help our Nation’s children 
prosper. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
H.R. 2639 so that we can have the op-
portunity to work on a bipartisan solu-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, we started this out with 
the ranking member saying we just 
wanted headlines. I absolutely want 
headlines to bring to the attention of 
this 
country 
the 
poverty 
in 
our 
schools. I want headlines about the 
crumbling schools my children go to 
school in. I do want headlines about 
the disinvestment in public education 
that my colleagues continue to do. 
I want the headlines. So I admit it. 
We also talked this afternoon about 
how equality cannot mean uniformity, 
but it can also not mean doing nothing 
but giving lip service to a problem, 
which is what my colleagues do. They 
talk and do nothing. Not one solution 
comes from the other side of the aisle— 
not one. I didn’t hear one today. 
Then we talk about this amendment 
that is coming to use another fund to 
help us do some of these things. They 
don’t tell you, Mr. Speaker, that that 
fund is a fund that is used for mental 
health for children. So they want us to 
choose between integrating schools and 
the mental health of our children. 
I think if that is the best they have 
got then I am so very, very dis-
appointed, Mr. Speaker, because at 
some point we have to reckon with 
what is going on in this country today 
and deal with the racial segregation of 
my children—and they are all my chil-
dren. 
Mr. Speaker, if we fail to begin to ad-
dress this issue—and this is only a be-
ginning—then we can no longer say we 
agree that every child should have ac-
cess to a quality education, that every 
child should go to a school that has the 
kind of equipment that they should 
have, that every child has internet and 
broadband access, and that every child 
has an opportunity to succeed. If we 
don’t do this, we don’t mean it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 2639, the Strength in 
Diversity Act. This landmark legislation would 
allow our students to learn in an environment 
that is representative of America, rather than 
being in a bubble with other students who look 
like them or share the same backgrounds and 
experiences. 
66 years ago, the Supreme Court opened 
the door to school integration with their ruling 
in Brown vs. Board of Education. Soon after, 
schools in my home state of Texas and other 
states across the south started the process of 
integrating Black and White students so that 
one day there would be a level playing field 
for students in the classroom. 
However, since that period, we have slowly 
seen a creeping effect where students have 
been divided into bubbles based strictly on the 
neighborhoods where they live. Opposition to 
bussing, white flight to the suburbs, and lin-
gering systematic racism have all contributed 
to the alarming situation we find ourselves in 
today as a country. 
A GAO report published in 2016 found that 
61 percent of all high-poverty schools served 
majority Black and Hispanic students. This 
separation by racial and socioeconomic lines 
prevents students in our poorest neighbor-
hoods from getting the same educational out-
comes as those in wealthier ones. Studies 
have shown that more diverse schools lead to 
better grades and test results, higher rates of 
college attendance, and lower dropout rates 
for students. 
This bill helps to stem the tide and reverse 
the wrongs of the past few decades by author-
izing federal funding to provide grants to 
school districts across the country to promote 
racial and socioeconomic diversity. Specifi-
cally, this additional funding could be used by 
school districts to study the impact of segrega-
tion in their schools, create innovative pro-
grams like magnet schools to attract students 
from outside the local community, and to train, 
hire, and retain high quality teachers to sup-
port these diversified schools. 
Mr. Speaker, North Texas is blessed to 
have such a diversified community; however, I 
have seen how some neighborhoods in my 
district have had better educational outcomes 
for students than others. It’s time that we level 
the playing field and give every student an op-
portunity at success. I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 2639, the ‘‘Strength in Diver-
sity Act.’’ H.R. 2639, directs the Department of 
Education (ED) to award grants to specified 
educational agencies, that may include local 
educational agencies, to develop or implement 
plans to improve diversity and reduce or elimi-
nate racial or socioeconomic isolation in pub-
licly funded early childhood education pro-
grams, public elementary schools, or public 
secondary schools. Specifically, ED may 
award planning and implementation grants to 
specified educational agencies. 
A recipient of a planning grant must use the 
grant to support students through certain ac-
tivities, such as developing options to improve

diversity in schools that might include weight-
ed lotteries or school boundary redesign. In 
addition, a recipient of an implementation 
grant must implement a high-quality plan to 
support students. This plan must, among other 
things, include a comprehensive set of strate-
gies that are designed to improve academic 
outcomes for all students, particularly students 
of color and low-income students. A grant re-
cipient may also use the grant for certain ac-
tivities such as recruiting additional teachers 
and staff, investing in specialized academic 
programs, and developing innovative and eq-
uitable school assignment plans. 
This legislation will also allow ED to carry 
out national activities under the grant program, 
such as developing best practices for grant re-
cipients and other experts in school diversity. 
The bill also requires ED to establish perform-
ance measures for the program and its related 
activities. 
H.R. 2639 is needed because for far too 
often, for reasons of legacy or policy, students 
of color or in low-income communities are shut 
out of the opportunity to get a good education. 
Just as intolerance and discrimination are 
learned behaviors, so are tolerance and inclu-
sion learned behaviors. As years of research 
have shown us, school integration benefits 
students and communities. Research shows 
that racial and socioeconomic diversity in the 
classroom can provide students with a range 
of cognitive and social benefits. And school 
policies around the country are beginning to 
catch up. 
Today, over 4 million students in America 
are enrolled in school districts or charter 
schools with socioeconomic integration poli-
cies—a number that has more than doubled 
since 2007. Students in integrated schools 
have higher average test scores. On the 2011 
National Assessment of Educational Progress 
(NAEP) given to fourth graders in math, for 
example, low-income students attending more 
affluent schools scored roughly two years of 
learning ahead of low-income students in high- 
poverty schools. 
Students in integrated schools are more 
likely to enroll in college, when comparing stu-
dents 
with 
similar 
socioeconomic 
back-
grounds, those students at more affluent 
schools are 68 percent more likely to enroll at 
a four-year college than their peers at high- 
poverty 
schools. 
Students 
in 
integrated 
schools are less likely to dropout, with dropout 
rates that are significantly higher for students 
in segregated, high-poverty schools than for 
students in integrated schools. Education pol-
icy is contributing to systemic racism that ex-
ists in how education is provided in the United 
States, which resists efforts to remove barriers 
that would allow all children to succeed. 
It has been well documented that integrated 
schools help to reduce racial achievement 
gaps. In fact, the racial achievement gap in K 
through 12 education closed more rapidly dur-
ing the peak years of school desegregation in 
the 1970s and 1980s than it has overall in the 
decades that followed—when many desegre-
gation policies were dismantled through fed-
eral court decisions allowing discriminatory 
segregated education to continue. Benefits are 
not limited to minority students, but also ex-
tend to white students. 
Integrated classrooms encourage critical 
thinking, problem solving, and creativity. We 
know that diverse classrooms, in which stu-
dents learn cooperatively alongside those 
whose perspectives and backgrounds are dif-
ferent from their own, are beneficial to all stu-
dents—including 
middle-class 
white 
stu-
dents—because these environments promote 
creativity, motivation, deeper learning, critical 
thinking, and problem-solving skills. 
This bill will help in this effort by providing 
grants to school districts that want to increase 
diversity in schools. As many of you know the 
school-age population in the United States is 
becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. 
A National Center for Education Statistics 
(NCES) report released in February 2019, on 
‘‘Status and Trends in the Education of Racial 
and Ethnic Groups 2018,’’ examined how edu-
cation experiences and outcomes vary among 
racial/ethnic groups. The report contains 36 in-
dicators that cover preprimary to postsec-
ondary education, as well as family back-
ground characteristics and labor force out-
comes. 
Prior research shows that living in poverty 
during early childhood is associated with 
lower-than-average 
academic 
performance 
that begins in kindergarten and extends 
through high school, leading to lower-than-av-
erage rates of school completion. In 2016, the 
percentages of children living in poverty were 
highest for Black and American Indian/ Alaska 
Native children and lowest for White and 
Asian children. 
One of the casualties of COVID–19 are the 
millions of children and young people who 
have lost out on opportunities to learn and 
grow in diverse school settings during the 
spring and fall of this year. Between 2000 and 
2017, the percentage of 5- to 17-year-olds 
who were White decreased from 62 to 51 per-
cent, while the percentage who were Hispanic 
increased from 16 to 25 percent. The chal-
lenge of diversity in education is not just lim-
ited to racial diversity in schools. Questions of 
socioeconomic diversity combined with those 
of racial diversity are important to consider in 
determining how far we have come in school 
equality. This bill builds on the work already 
underway by schools and school districts who 
are pursuing diversity to have additional re-
sources. 
In 2019, approximately 56.6 million students 
attended elementary and secondary school in 
the United States: 50.8 million students were 
in public schools; 5.8 million students were in 
private schools. Among the 50.8 million stu-
dents enrolled in elementary and secondary 
public schools: 1.4 million were in prekinder-
garten; 3.7 million were in kindergarten; 35.5 
million attended elementary through middle 
school (K–8th grade); 15.3 million attended 
high school (9–12th grade). Through 2028, en-
rollment is projected to increase to 51.4 mil-
lion. 
In 2018, 3.3 million students graduated from 
high school, marking nearly a 1 percent in-
crease from 2017: 3.7 million were expected 
to graduate in 2020; 3.3 million from public 
high schools; 0.4 million from private schools. 
The average per-student expenditure in public 
schools is $13,440. 
In 2019, there are approximately 16,800 
school districts in the United States. Thirteen 
percent of all public school students were 
served by the Individuals with Disabilities Act 
for the 2015–2016 school year. 
Between 2000 and 2016, total public school 
enrollment increased for 32 states. The fol-
lowing saw increases of 15 percent or more: 
Florida, Delaware, North Carolina, Idaho, 
Georgia, Colorado, Arizona, Texas, Utah, and 
Nevada. The following states saw decreases 
of 10 percent or more: Michigan, Maine, New 
Hampshire, and Vermont. In 2018, 7 million or 
13.7 percent of public school students re-
ceived special education services. In 2017, 9.6 
percent of public school students were learn-
ing English as a second language. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting 
H.R. 2639, Strength in Diversity Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4408 
September 15, 2020 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, in 1954, Brown v. Board of 
Education unequivocally asserted that 
segregated schools are inherently un-
equal. When Thurgood Marshall argued 
this landmark case before the Supreme 
Court, he thought it would take just 5 
years to integrate schools nationwide. 
Sadly, 60 years later, schools are more 
segregated now than any time since 
the early 1970s, and school segregation 
is occurring at alarming rates nation-
wide. 
In order to address increased school 
segregation, we must address one of 
the root causes of the problem: residen-
tial segregation. Housing segregation 
leads to school segregation. That is 
why I am taking an initial step to ad-
dress the link between housing and 
school 
segregation 
by 
offering 
an 
amendment to the Strength in Diver-
sity Act to prioritize grant recipients 
that coordinate with local housing 
agencies to integrate schools. 
My amendment will make sure that 
all grants have a meaningful reduction 
in racial and economic isolation for 
children in schools. Segregation in 
schools is propagated by housing seg-
regation, and my amendment will work 
to address this underlying issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment, although I am not opposed 
to the amendment and have great af-
fection for the introducer. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, unfortunately, this amend-
ment does nothing to correct the flaws 
of the underlying bill, but it doesn’t 
make the bill any worse either. The 
amendment includes language that 
would ensure applicants are judged on 
their ability to meet the fundamental 
purposes of the bill, which should be 
done with all grant applications and by 
anyone receiving taxpayer funding, and 
that makes sense. 
However, 
the 
amendment 
doesn’t 
change the fundamentally flawed ap-
proach this bill takes to tackle a prob-
lem we all agree that school districts 
should address. But nothing in the 
amendment itself is objectionable—in 
fact, it may be helpful—so I will sup-
port the amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, no child should receive a less-
er education because of the color of 
their skin or the neighborhood where 
they live, and I am proud that my 
amendment will address school seg-
regation holistically by supporting co-

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Strength in 
Diversity Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this Act is to support the 
development, implementation, and evalua-
tion of comprehensive strategies to address 
the effects of racial isolation or con-
centrated poverty by increasing diversity, 
including racial diversity and socioeconomic 
diversity, in covered schools. 
SEC. 3. ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE DIVERSITY AND

cational agency, or consortium of such agen-
cies, that receives an allocation under sec-
tion 4105(a) of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7115(a)) for a 
fiscal year may use such funds to develop or 
implement comprehensive strategies to im-
prove diversity and reduce or eliminate ra-
cial or socioeconomic isolation in covered 
schools. 
(b) LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY APPLICA-
TIONS.—A local educational agency, or con-

of Indian Tribes or Tribal organizations ap-
proved by the Tribes located in the area 
served by such agency or consortium; 
(B) consultation with other community en-
tities, which may include local housing or 
transportation authorities; 
(C) public hearings or other open forums to 
inform the development of such comprehen-
sive strategies; and 
(D) outreach to parents and students, in a 
language that parents and students can un-
derstand, and consultation with students and 
families within such agency or consortium

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1107, the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I have got 
to be frank for a minute. I find it a 
shame that this amendment is even 
necessary. 
When we replaced the No Child Left 
Behind Act with the Every Student 
Succeeds Act, we created the Student 
Support and Academic Enrichment 
Grants program on a bipartisan, bi-
cameral basis. We did this to provide 
school districts the flexibility they 
need to use Federal funds as they see 
fit to meet local needs. 
It is disappointing that my Demo-
cratic colleagues didn’t invite Repub-
licans to the table to negotiate in good 
faith to build on that consensus. In-
stead, Democrats once again ignored 
commonsense approaches and impose a 
top-down, Big Government solution 
that will have the Federal Government 
decide how best to address the issues of 
racial and socioeconomic isolation in 
American schools. 
b 1415 
You know, we have heard story after 
story of the history of our schools and 
how we got to this point. The question 
is, will we continue with this top-down 
government approach or allow the

schools the flexibility to fix this prob-
lem. 
My amendment, on the other hand, 
offers a commonsense solution that 
could easily garner an overwhelming 
majority of votes in this body if every 
Member chose to focus on the impor-
tance of actually addressing racial and 
socioeconomic isolation in schools and 
not on scoring political points. 
This amendment would explicitly 
allow school districts to use funds they 
receive from the Student Support and 
Academic Enrichment Grants program 
under the Every Student Succeeds Act 
to develop or implement comprehen-
sive strategies to improve diversity 
and reduce or eliminate racial or socio-
economic isolation in public early 
childhood programs and public schools. 
This is a real solution. The SSAEG 
block grant is currently receiving just 
over $1 billion. The proposal before us 
today would have to fight for funding 
with the multitude of other Federal 
programs that currently exist. 
This amendment also ensures that 
school districts are engaging with their 
communities to design programs that 
comply with Federal law and have the 
support of parents and other constitu-
ents. It also alters requirements to dis-
tribute funds across multiple spending 
categories so that districts will have 
sufficient funding to design effective 
integration programs. 
The amendment uses the same lan-
guage as the Magnet Schools Assist-
ance Program under the Every School 
Succeeds Act to ensure that school dis-
tricts choosing to use funds for improv-
ing diversity can fund transportation 
activities, if they see fit. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I claim the 
time in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), 
the chairman. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
While I appreciate that the gen-
tleman from Georgia acknowledges the 
importance of providing resources to 
support school diversity, encouraging 
the use of IV-A funds for this purpose 
is not a reasonable solution. 
Schools already rely on a very lim-
ited amount of IV-A funding for a wide 
range of activities and programs, in-
cluding mental health resources, edu-
cational technology, STEM education, 
extracurricular activities, and other 
critical needs. 
This amendment would effectively 
force schools to choose between ad-
dressing school segregation and pro-
viding mental health services. Devel-
oping, implementing, and expanding 
school diversity initiatives is costly 
and should not come at the expense of 
important programs already being sup-
ported by title IV. We will not improve 
services for students, parents, and com-
munities by cutting the same size pie 
into even smaller slices. 
The purpose of the Strength in Diver-
sity Act is to provide direct and addi-
tional investments in education that 
helps 
communities 
integrate 
their 
schools without undermining existing 
school programs and services. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendment. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. FOXX). 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
gentleman’s amendment and urge my 
colleagues to support it. 
I applaud the gentleman from Geor-
gia for offering such an alternative. As 
has been said, it builds on bipartisan, 
bicameral agreements to ensure nearly 
every school district in the country has 
Federal funds to pursue the goals of 
the underlying bill rather than afford-
ing this opportunity to a select few 
school districts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the amendment. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that we 
even have to offer this amendment. We 
have got a problem, but I can tell you, 
my community solved this problem, 
which is the reason I ran for Congress. 
The faith-based community created a 
school for kids who are branded as los-
ers in the public education system, and 
these moms don’t have but one choice, 
and that is to send these children to 
this school. And it is amazing how kids 
who are branded as losers have become 
the most outstanding students in Rich-
mond County. 
We keep talking about fixing these 
things and, like I said earlier, we con-
tinue to offer solutions, but we con-
tinue with the same problem. There is 
a way to fix this. This is a start. Rath-
er than create a new program we know 
will be underfunded that will benefit, 
at best, a small handful of school dis-
tricts, my amendment would ensure 
that nearly every school district in 
this country would have Federal funds 
available to improve diversity and re-
duce or eliminate racial or socio-
economic isolation in schools. 
I urge the majority to put the stu-
dents and families and educators my 
amendment would benefit before their 
political interest and take ‘‘yes’’ for an 
answer. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I just have 
to say that, once again, my colleagues 
have put forth an amendment that does 
nothing to stop or to help with inte-
grating schools. Absolutely nothing. 
They have had time after time after 
time to address this issue, even as re-
cently as 2017 when Betsy DeVos de-
cided to eliminate the program, as well 
as to start to roll back the Civil Rights 
Division of the Department of Edu-
cation. 
So it is not like this just came up. I 
think part of the problem is when you 
have never experienced this kind of 
racism, it is hard to deal with it, but I 
am giving you an opportunity now to 
deal with it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1107, the pre-
vious 
question

amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the

Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1107, the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Ms. FUDGE) and 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. FOXX) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Ohio. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. BROWN). 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Speak-
er, I first want to recognize not just 
the hard work of my colleague from 
Ohio, Representative MARCIA
FUDGE, 
but really a lifelong commitment to 
improving the quality of education for 
all of our children across this country, 
regardless of your background and ex-
perience, regardless of your ZIP Code, 
and that is what the Strength in Diver-
sity Act does. 
I thank Representative FUDGE for her 
leadership and for giving me an oppor-
tunity to present a portion of this en 
bloc amendment, the two amendments 
that I sponsored and that are part of 
the en bloc. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise, of course, in sup-
port of the Strength in Diversity Act 
and my amendments to this legisla-
tion, which will ensure that our re-
forms continue to have an impact well 
into the future. We still have work to 
do to address persistent racial and so-
cioeconomic disparities that exist in 
our schools. 
According to the 2016 GAO report, 61 
percent of all high-poverty schools 
were serving majority Black and His-
panic student populations. The COVID– 
19 pandemic has further exasperated 
the racial and socioeconomic isolation 
throughout our country and our school 
systems. 
Without proper support, the learning 
loss will be greatest among low-income 
Black and Hispanic students during the 
period 
of 
remote 
learning. 
The 
Strength in Diversity Act will help cre-
ate a level playing field by authorizing 
grants to localities that have signifi-
cant achievement gaps and segregation 
in their schools. 
These grants will allow school dis-
tricts to recruit, hire, and train addi-
tional teachers, administrators, and 
other instructional and support staff, 
knowing that our educators are essen-
tial to creating the world-class edu-
cation that our children deserve. 
My first amendment would allow 
education systems to use grant funds 
to also recruit, hire, and train school 
counselors. School counselors serve a 
vital role in maximizing students’ suc-
cess, working with students individ-
ually and collectively to create an ex-
clusive school climate. 
Numerous studies have shown the 
value of school counseling for students 
in academic and social-emotional de-
velopment, as well as college and ca-
reer readiness. Having the additional 
support of a school counselor helps de-
velop well-rounded and prepared stu-
dents. 
But hiring our best talent cannot be 
the end of our efforts. We need ac-
countability now and into the future. 
The underlying bill requires grantees 
to submit an annual report to the De-
partment of Education on their efforts 
to increase diversity and meet certain 
performance measures. 
My second amendment requires the 
annual report to include a description 
of how grantees will continue this im-
portant work following the grant pe-
riod to ensure schools are thinking 
ahead to the future and creating sus-
tainable strategies and programs to 
continue fostering diversity, inclusion, 
and achievement. 
We cannot task our schools to only 
address diversity and inclusion for the 
duration of a grant. Longstanding 
issues require long-term, community- 
driven solutions. School systems must 
readjust their frameworks so that in-
creasing diversity and inclusion is al-
ways part of the conversation and cur-
riculum. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to support the en bloc 
amendment and the underlying bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the majority of the amend-
ments 
are 
unobjectionable, 
though 
none of them address the underlying 
problems with the bill. 
However, I highlight two problematic 
amendments: 
The amendment offered by Rep-
resentative COOPER would give school 
districts priority in this program if 
those districts had previously sub-
mitted an application under an Obama- 
era predecessor to the program in the 
underlying bill. This amendment is 
flawed for two reasons: 
An application filed 4 years ago, may 
or may not still be adequate. Auto-
matically giving those districts pri-
ority would disadvantage school dis-
tricts who might have new and better 
ideas to propose. 
Submitting an application 4 years 
ago is not the same as being funded 4 
years ago. Applicants that never dem-
onstrated their merit then should start 
on equal footing with new applicants 
now. 
Another amendment concealed with-
in the en bloc is offered by Representa-
tive GREEN
of Texas, which forces 
grantees’ hands on a dilemma many 
are still considering for themselves. 
The amendment requires that partici-
pating school districts that utilize en-
trance exams and competitive applica-
tion procedures must replace these 
processes with other methods. 
Republicans recognize that many 
school districts, as well as colleges and 
universities, are wrestling with the 
role entrance exams and other com-
petitive application procedures have 
played in the admissions decisions and 
should play in the future. Democrats 
would, apparently, like to short-circuit 
that debate and make those determina-
tions for school districts themselves. 
Ironically, entrance exams began as 
an earnest effort to combat discrimina-
tion and prejudice by creating objec-
tive criteria that weren’t as easily ma-
nipulated by admissions personnel who 
were 
biased 
against 
certain 
popu-
lations. Objective enrollment criteria 
can decrease the potential for schools— 
especially highly competitive schools— 
to be able to justify discrimination 
against students based on their back-
grounds or racial identities. 
Today, there are legitimate argu-
ments to be made on both sides of the 
debate for keeping or eliminating this 
practice. But this amendment would 
proclaim that the House of Representa-
tives has decided against the use of en-
trance exams, a conversation this body 
has never had. 
These two amendments—one under-
mining the quality of the application 
process, and the other unfairly decid-
ing an outcome of an ongoing debate— 
cause me great concern and I oppose 
them. 
Ultimately, though, on balance, this 
en bloc consideration is worthy of sup-
port, even if it doesn’t ultimately re-
deem the underlying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COOPER). 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for her terrific lead-
ership in the Strength in Diversity 
Act. 
I am afraid the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina completely misunder-
stood my amendment. My amendment

were prevented from applying for the

ties grant—it would just give them the

first shot at reapplying. It does not 
guarantee 
acceptance 
for 
these 
30 
school districts but, rather, gives them 
a first shot at correcting the racial in-
justices in their districts. 
It is very sad that Secretary DeVos’ 
first action in office was to cut this 
critical program, so this offers an op-
portunity to right that wrong. 
I want to commend, again, the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio for her terrific 
leadership on this bill. I would like to 
thank Chairman SCOTT, BOBBY SCOTT, 
the head of the whole committee. I 
would also like to thank BARBARA LEE 
for her critical support of this amend-
ment. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL). 
Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
amendment to the Strength in Diver-
sity Act, and I am very grateful to 
Representative FUDGE for allowing me 
to introduce this amendment, a critical 
piece of legislation to begin reversing 
decades of resegregation in our schools. 
In Florida, nearly 63 percent of stu-
dents are from minority communities, 
compared to only 30 percent of teach-
ers. This disparity is exacerbating ra-
cial and socioeconomic achievement 
gaps. 
A teacher in my district, Sharon Riv-
ers, emphasized the importance of di-
versity in the classroom, saying: ‘‘Cul-
ture diversity in the classroom is es-
sential in helping us recognize, respect, 
and welcome the many differences 
across the district. It is imperative 
that we allow our understanding of our 
differences to build a bridge of respect 
for one another.’’ 
I 
couldn’t 
agree 
more, 
and 
my 
amendment would build upon that ef-
fort by increasing the diversity of our 
teaching workforce. Teachers of color 
can provide more culturally relevant 
education and better understand the 
situations their students of color are 
facing, helping develop stronger stu-
dent-teacher relationships. 
Our teachers should reflect our com-
munities and our schools. Recent stud-
ies show that increased teacher diver-
sity results in better achievement 
scores, lower levels of disciplinary ac-
tion, and reduced dropout rates. In 
fact, a Florida study showed that 
Black students had higher reading and 
math scores when taught by Black 
teachers. 
Unfortunately, in most States, as the 
proportion of students of color grows, 
the number of minority teachers is not 
keeping pace. We must do more to en-
sure that all students, regardless of 
their race or background, are set up for 
success. 
I urge everyone to vote to pass my 
amendment. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment to the 
Strength in Diversity Act, which re-
quires grantees to report on their 
progress in reducing racial and socio-
economic segregation in our schools. 
In the year 2020, our schools are still 
separate and unequal. My home dis-
trict has some of the most racially seg-
regated schools in the country, and 
this is no coincidence. This was by de-
sign. 
Forty-five years ago, rich White sub-
urbs around my district decided they 
didn’t want to bus their children to de-
segregate schools, and the highest 
court in our land agreed with them. 
The Supreme Court case of Milliken v. 
Bradley made racial integration of 
schools nearly impossible, and we are 
still seeing the negative impact of that 
decision today. 
We see it in our Detroit Public 
Schools, where students had to sue the 
State of Michigan for the right to lit-
eracy. We see it in the lead that poi-
sons our school drinking fountains 
throughout my district. We see it in 
having just $7,000 per pupil while the 
neighboring the Grosse Pointe commu-
nity, a largely White, affluent suburb, 
has nearly $14,000 per pupil. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
FUDGE for her tireless efforts in leading 
this legislation, which is a critically 
important step toward racial desegre-
gation of our schools. 
I also want to thank Chairman SCOTT 
and his incredible staff for working 
with me on this amendment and for 
their leadership. 
I urge strong support for this amend-
ment and for this bill. 
Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1107, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. FUDGE). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1107, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
DEAN) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of my amendment No. 6 to H.R. 
2639, the Strength in Diversity Act. 
This amendment would allow State 
education agencies to apply for the 
grants provided under this bill and 
would require these agencies to have 
procedures in place to assess and to 
prevent the redrawing of school dis-
trict lines in a manner that increases 
racial or socioeconomic isolation. 
Specifically, agencies applying for 
grants will have to demonstrate proce-
dures to, number one, assess and pre-
vent redrawing of school district lines 
that increase isolation; number two, 
assess segregation impacts of new 
school 
construction 
proposals 
and 
prioritize construction funding that 
will increase integration; and, number 
three, identify progress toward reduc-
tion of racial and economic isolation in 
their State plans. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
diversity 
is 
our 
strength, and ensuring equity in our 
education systems will benefit all stu-
dents and school districts across this 
Nation. 
I am a parent, a grandparent, and a 
former teacher. I know that access to a 
good education is the key to deter-
mining one’s future, and each child de-
serves equal opportunity to that prom-
ise. Yet, we are reminded every day 
that we have a racial and economic di-
vide in this country that leaves too 
many children behind. 
This amendment is about good gov-
ernment and about equitable edu-
cation, giving all children the opportu-
nities they deserve while also ensuring 
the prevention of school secessions, 
which usually create wealthy White en-
claves separated from more diverse 
communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I claim the time in opposition 
to the gentlewoman’s amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4412 
September 15, 2020 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, while I support the goals of 
this amendment, I must reluctantly 
urge my colleagues to oppose it. 
Hidden within this amendment is po-
tentially a sweeping change to how 
States evaluate their schools under the 
Elementary and Secondary Education 
Act. The amendment requires States to 
include progress on reducing racial and 
economic 
isolation 
in 
evaluating 
schools as a factor under State’s title I 
State plans. 
I say this is a potentially sweeping 
change because the language is un-
clear. However, I read it as intending 
to require States to consider racial and 
economic isolation as a factor in the 
State-driven 
accountability 
systems 
required under title I. 
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if such a 
change to how States evaluate schools 
is a good or bad idea. But I am sure 
that such a significant change should 
be debated as part of a proper reevalua-
tion of title I, not in the context of a 
standalone competitive grant program. 
If this is not the gentlewoman’s in-
tent with this amendment, then this 
just highlights the flaws in legislating 
without bipartisan discussions. Per-
haps there are steps we could agree 
States should take in the context of 
title I to reduce racial and economic 
isolation, 
but 
let’s 
debate 
those 
changes in the proper context. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I am a little 
puzzled by those remarks. After all, the 
Allen amendment sought some rather 
drastic changes to ESEA, but that 
didn’t seem to generate that same com-
ment. 
We all know that equal educational 
opportunities enrich us all, and they 
are the right of all and lead to better 
financial outcomes later in life. 
Though we need to collectively do 
better across this Nation in increasing 
diversity in our educational systems, 
my home State of Pennsylvania, in 
particular, demonstrates the need for 
greater action. 
According to a 2015 report by the 
UCLA Civil Rights Project, the amount 
of majority-minority and intensely 
segregated 
schools 
statewide 
more 
than doubled, 21 percent and 11 per-
cent, respectively, over two decades. 
In fact, 17 percent of Philadelphia 
schools have a student body that is 99 
percent to 100 percent minority stu-
dents. Also, in the Philadelphia metro 
area, a typical Black and Latino stu-
dent attended a school with, respec-
tively, 71 percent or 68 percent low-in-
come students, while a typical White 
student attended a school with only 21 
percent low-income students. 
This is a problem. These inequities 
isolate and segregate students, which 
in turn separate our communities, 
limit student growth, and hurt the edu-
cational resources in highly segregated 
schools. 
Our schools are meant to serve all 
students equally, no matter their race, 
ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. 
Without 
adequate 
educational 
re-
sources, students do not have the nec-
essary tools to perform to the best of 
their abilities and to further their edu-
cation. This not only hurts students 
who are racially or socioeconomically 
isolated; it hurts us all because Amer-
ica works best when we all succeed. 
Despite Pennsylvania’s need for fur-
ther action to combat these problems, 
there is promise and hope in the fact 
that my State has shown real change 
can happen. From the early sixties to 
the late nineties, there were inten-
tional desegregation efforts that re-
sulted in evidence-based decreases in 
segregation. New, competitive grants 
to State agencies would direct re-
sources to States looking to advance 
and support these efforts moving for-
ward. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to close by say-
ing that I thank Chairman SCOTT and 
Representative FUDGE for their leader-
ship. 
I urge Members to support this 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to repeat something I 
said earlier. Republicans and Demo-
crats agree that discrimination and 
State-sanctioned segregation are re-
pugnant, illegal, and blatantly im-
moral. Action should be taken to 
achieve greater equality for our Na-
tion’s students and in our schools. 
We believe we should strive toward a 
future where all students, regardless of 
race or color, have the chance to suc-
ceed. Education and hard work are the 
paths out of poverty for millions, and 
education provides students with the 
tools and skills they need to build a 
successful life. 
My colleague mentioned that she 
didn’t see the difference between her 
amendment 
and 
Representative 
ALLEN’s amendment. Well, Representa-
tive ALLEN’s amendment provides a 
way for all schools to achieve worthy 
goals through grant programs. This 
goes to the fundamental way schools 
are evaluated and would be a major 
change in policy. 
I, again, urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on this amendment. We should be 
debating this issue when we are debat-
ing the issues related to title I. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1107, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered

the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN).

The amendment was agreed to.

AMENDMENT NO. 9 OFFERED BY MR. MOULTON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 9 
printed in part B of House Report 116– 
502. 
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 11, after line 7, insert the following: 
(F) Creating or improving systems and 
partnerships to create a one-stop enrollment 
process for students with multiple public 
school options, including making school in-
formation and data more accessible and easy 
to understand, in order to ensure access to 
low poverty or high-performing schools for 
low-income children and to promote racial 
and socioeconomic diversity. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1107, the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MOULTON) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, school 
segregation is inseparable from hous-
ing and the persistence of segregated 
communities, communities segregated 
by race largely due to decades of pur-
poseful law and policy that supported 
White homeownership while denying 
people of color the same subsidies, 
things like the ways that Black World 
War II veterans were denied the use of 
GI Bill-guaranteed mortgages in subur-
ban neighborhoods; purposeful policies 
and 
restrictive 
covenants 
allowing 
open and rampant discrimination in 
lending and homeownership; and poli-
cies like redlining that robbed Black 
and Brown Americans of access to pub-
lic resources to grow wealth and oppor-
tunity—all of these things embodied, I 
think most clearly, by the under-
funding of neighborhood schools serv-
ing communities of color that were on 
the wrong side of the red line. These 
purposeful policies, housing policies, 
created tremendous inequities in edu-
cation. 
Now, some of my colleagues across 
the aisle claim that the underlying bill 
ignores the opportunity, the issue, of 
school choice. Well, my amendment 
brings these two things together. This 
amendment makes it clear that, where 
school choice supports diversity, it 
should be encouraged. And, indeed, 
there are great examples of this across 
the country. 
Public school choice is the most ef-
fective means of achieving racial and 
socioeconomic integration in K–12 edu-
cation in diverse schools across the 
country today, supporting parents to 
enroll their children beyond their 
neighborhood schools. 
Public school choice did not exist in 
1954. It did not exist in 1968. It did not 
exist at scale in the 1990s, but it does 
today. The problem is just that, all too 
often, school choice policies ignore the 
pressing issue of segregation by hous-
ing. 
When school choice is not inten-
tional, it can serve to exacerbate in-
equity instead of remedying it. This 
has been confirmed by decades of re-
search here in the U.S. and across the 
world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4413 
September 15, 2020 
Many school choice systems are over-
ly complex, parents aren’t supported, 
and, too often, only the wealthy and 
well-connected take advantage of open 
enrollment policies. 
My amendment would support school 
districts in using public school choice 
to improve school diversity and, in 
turn, equity of opportunity. This com-
monsense amendment would ensure 
that districts receiving grants can use 
the funds to design or improve public 
school 
choice 
systems, 
while 
prioritizing diversity in school assign-
ment, and make them easier for par-
ents to navigate. These all should be 
bipartisan priorities. 
We have more public school choice 
now than we ever had before, yet our 
schools are more segregated by race 
and class than at any time since the 
1960s. But it doesn’t have to be this 
way. 
My amendment, a relatively small 
change, would make a big difference 
because it would say that the use of 
public school choice policies, like open 
enrollment across and between dis-
tricts, that match parent choice with 
purposeful diversity planning can be 
used successfully to accomplish all of 
these goals. 
It is time we support school districts 
in 
using 
responsible 
public 
school 
choice as a tool to achieve equity of op-
portunity, a fundamental right in our 
Constitution. 
When public school choice controls 
for diversity in school assignment, we 
see not only improved diversity of the 
student body, but also resource equity 
among 
schools, 
higher parent and 
teacher 
satisfaction, 
and 
increased 
achievement for all students. 
I urge my colleagues to stand with 
me in supporting the use of public 
school choice to decrease racial and so-
cioeconomic school segregation, and I 
urge a bipartisan ‘‘yes’’ vote on my 
amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I claim the time in opposition 
to the amendment, although I am not 
opposed to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I mentioned in my opening re-
marks that the underlying bill fails, in 
part, because it doesn’t address the big-
gest challenge facing low-income fami-
lies and families of color, namely, the 
lack of access to high-quality edu-
cation options that will prepare their 
children for lifelong success. Unfortu-
nately, this amendment doesn’t di-
rectly address that problem either, but 
at least it takes a small step in that di-
rection. 
As more and more communities em-
brace charter schools and other public 
school options, one-stop enrollment 
processes are one way some commu-
nities have made it easier for parents 
to understand and navigate their op-
tions. 
As charter school enrollment grew in 
Washington, D.C., to include nearly 
half of the city’s students, the city im-
plemented an open lottery system to 
provide parents a one-stop portal to 
apply to multiple schools. 
The system isn’t perfect, but that is 
mostly because the open lottery sys-
tem doesn’t address the fact that there 
are an insufficient number of seats in 
high-performing schools to meet de-
mand. I wish we were here debating so-
lutions to that problem today, Mr. 
Speaker. 
But in the absence of a real effort to 
increase the availability of the high- 
quality education options, I will settle 
for an effort to facilitate easier selec-
tions of these options where they exist. 
I applaud the gentleman for bucking 
the trend in his party of opposing edu-
cational freedom for low-income fami-
lies and families of color, and I urge 
my colleagues to support the amend-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina for her support and for under-
standing that, yes, this is not perhaps 
the sweeping change that we would all 
like to see to fix these truly historic 
inequities in our education system, but 
it is an important step in the right di-
rection. 
And there are great examples across 
the county of school systems that have 
been able to use public school choice in 
positive ways to improve educational 
opportunities for all. It is simple com-
mon sense that access to these pro-
grams should be simple, it should be 
easy to navigate, and these programs 
should 
not 
effectively 
discriminate 
against certain families that do not 
have access to all the information or 
wealth or other opportunities to navi-
gate them successfully. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my Republican 
colleagues for their support on this 
amendment, and I particularly want to 
thank the leaders of this committee, 
Chairman SCOTT
and Representative 
FUDGE, for continuing to push to recog-
nize the fundamental values of our 
country and our education system. 
That opportunity should be equal for 
all, that education should be the great 
equalizer because, if we can do that, we 
will live up to our Founders’ ideals. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate my colleague’s 
comments, and, as I said, this is a very 
small step in the right direction. I wish 
that there were more people in the gen-
tleman’s party who wanted to see this. 
We have tremendous evidence that 
school choice is the tide that lifts all 
boats in education. It does everywhere. 
It breaks my heart when I see places 
like New York City where people 
there—particularly, the mayor there, 
has done everything he can to snuff out 
choice and to snuff out the opportuni-
ties that exist there, such as Success 
Academy, which not only has provided 
extraordinarily high-quality education 
to the students, but has really helped 
raise the level in a very minor way in 
the other public schools there. 
We have way too many situations in 
this country where the teachers unions 
want to stop all opportunities for 
choice. And I will take a tiny, tiny step 
as a good faith movement in the direc-
tion of providing all students, particu-
larly low-income students, with the op-
portunity for choice, because we know 
where there is choice, the quality in-
creases. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

‘‘nay’’ on rollcall No. 187, and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall 
No. 188.

BACK TO SCHOOL 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, this is a 
back-to-school September like we have 
never seen before. Over the last few 
weeks, students, parents, teachers, and 
administrators have faced great uncer-
tainty as students return to the class-
room. 
In many parts of our country, schools 
are struggling to reopen safely because 
of the Trump administration’s failed 
response to the ongoing pandemic. Our 
States are in dire need of more Federal 
funding for education, and Republicans 
must come to the table to help provide 
the support and protection our stu-
dents and workers need to learn and 
teach safely. 
Secretary DeVos and the Trump ad-
ministration 
must 
embrace 
virtual 
learning opportunities, including re-
mote learning, and encourage limited 
in-person options rather than threat-
ening students’ safety and school fund-
ing, especially in the areas of science 
and public health guidance. 
It is self-evident that COVID–19 is 
still a serious health and safety con-
cern for our Nation and neither chil-
dren nor teachers are immune from 
this deadly disease. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the public to dou-
ble down on precautions to prevent in-
fection, and I urge Congress to strike a 
bipartisan agreement on a COVID–19 
relief package that ensures all schools 
have the resources they need to carry 
out their duties and to protect the 
lives of teachers and students as well. 
f 
RESTORE, REBUILD, AND RENEW 
THE AMERICAN DREAM 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, the Com-
mitment to America introduced by 
House Republicans is a plan which can 
be accomplished in the next Congress 
with the right leadership in place. It is 
our commitment to the American pub-
lic that we have clear objectives and 
we will deliver results for the people. 
The plan calls for us to restore our 
way of life, rebuild our economy, and 
renew the American Dream. 
As we restore our way of life, we will 
defeat the coronavirus by expanding 
rapid testing capabilities and devel-
oping a vaccine that is safe and effec-
tive sooner rather than later. 
We will rebuild our economy with un-
precedented growth, including, once 
again, regaining historically low unem-
ployment for all, including women, Af-
rican Americans, and Hispanic Ameri-
cans. 
We will rebuild by continuing to sup-
port employees and employers, upgrad-
ing and modernizing our infrastruc-
ture, and implementing free and recip-
rocal trade agreements that give made- 
in-USA products and farmers a com-
petitive edge on the world stage. 
We will renew the American Dream 
by providing every child the oppor-
tunity to attend an excellent school, 
every veteran a choice in healthcare 
and job opportunities, every citizen a 
pathway to pursue a meaningful ca-
reer, and every senior an assurance 
that Social Security and Medicare will 
be protected. 
This 
Republican 
Commitment 
to 
America plan is the framework to com-
plete a great American comeback and 
ensure a great future for our country.

HONORING EDWARD CARVELL, 
WORLD WAR II HERO 
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a World War II veteran 
and hero from my district, Mr. Edward 
Carvell. 
Born in November 1926 in Caernarvon 
Township in eastern Lancaster County 
as the 10th of 16 children, Mr. Carvell 
served as a sergeant in the United 
States Army, serving in the 24th Divi-
sion in both the Philippines and Japan. 
He was the second member of his fam-
ily drafted into service. He followed 
the path of an older brother. 
I learned of Mr. Carvell’s exemplary 
service when my office assisted with 
submitting his story to the Library of 
Congress Veterans History Project. I 
am so thankful that we could be in-
volved in making sure his experience 
serving in the United States Armed 
Forces and the stories of many other 
brave servicemen and -women are pre-
served. 
As we mark the 75th anniversary of 
the end of World War II this year, I am 
deeply appreciative of Mr. Carvell’s 
sharing his story, and I am thankful 
for the service of so many uniformed 
men and women from Lancaster and 
Southern York Counties. 
I would encourage all of my col-
leagues to participate in the Veterans 
History Project so our brave veterans’ 
experiences can be preserved and hon-
ored in the Library of Congress. 
f 
EXPANDING RURAL BROADBAND 
(Mr. BUDD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, during the 
pandemic, much of our lives has been 
forced online. Our children are learning 
remotely. Our businesses are conducted 
through webcams. Even Sunday church 
services are now live-streamed on 
Facebook. 
For the estimated 500,000 North Caro-
linians who lack dependable internet 
access, these temporary changes have 
been debilitating. 
Making sure rural families have 
quality internet access is a top priority 
for me, Mr. Speaker. That is why I 
sponsored the RURAL Act, which is 
now the law of the land. It helps ensure 
that rural telephone and electric co-ops 
have more dollars for broadband in-
vestment. 
No one in our district should have 
their level of internet access deter-
mined by their ZIP Code, and I am 
going to keep fighting for broadband 
access across all of our rural commu-
nities.

RECOGNIZING SISKIYOU COUNTY 
SHERIFF JON LOPEY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Sheriff Jon Lopey, 
who has served as Siskiyou County 
sheriff for many years.

September 15, 2020 
He served the people there well. He 
has been a friend in his 10 years of serv-
ice as sheriff-coroner of Siskiyou Coun-
ty. He will be, indeed, retiring later 
this week. 
He has been an excellent leader in 
the north State, leading the other sher-
iffs; keeping the peace in the area; 
eradicating illegal marijuana growth 
on public lands, something that is a 
widespread problem up that way; and 
staying tough on crime. 
Most recently, Sheriff Lopey has 
been tasked with evacuating Happy 
Camp, California, with the tragic fire 
that has occurred there very recently. 
It just partly destroyed the whole town 
by what is known as the Slater fire 
currently burning in Siskiyou County. 
Although never an easy task, I sin-
cerely appreciate his dedication to pro-
viding the very best safety and service 
to his citizens. As a constitutional 
sheriff, he is always looking out for all 
of our rights. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish Sheriff Lopey 
and his wife, Maxine, the best during 
his retirement and happy trails. 
f 
MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
(Mr. YOHO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, in this time 
of great chaos, uncertainty, and fear, 
today’s Abraham Accords provide us 
with a clear path to the normalization 
of relations between the State of Israel 
and her regional neighbors, Bahrain 
and the UAE. 
Not only was this peace achieved 
without abandoning or weakening our 
Israeli ally, but it is a peace that rec-
ognizes the ever-present and growing 
threat posed by militant extremists, 
including the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
to all regional neighbors. No longer 
will Iran take advantage of a region di-
vided against itself. Instead, an in-
creasing number of Arab nations are 
choosing to join a united front against 
terror led by the United States and 
Israel. 
I was honored to be present for this 
historic signing ceremony at the White 
House, and I pray that we can use this 
unifying moment to recognize that no 
matter the danger before us, peace will 
prevail. It is a good illustration of why 
President Trump is being recognized 
and considered for the Nobel Peace 
Prize.

TRAGEDY IN COFFEE COUNTY, 
TENNESSEE 
(Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise tonight deeply saddened 
by the tragedy that took place this 
past weekend in Coffee County, Ten-
nessee, where two innocent lives were 
taken and others injured in a heinous 
kidnapping and carjacking. 
Our prayers are with the victims and 
their families, including Tennessean 
Philip Jordan Stevens, who are now 
reeling from this tragedy. 
As Tennesseans, we have not and will 
not accept this kind of disgusting vio-
lence in our communities. 
I would like to thank our State and 
local law enforcement for swiftly and 
dutifully responding to this appalling 
attack. At a time when police forces 
around the Nation are themselves 
under attack, I want our law enforce-
ment officers to know that I will con-
tinue to support the thin blue line. 
As our community pushes forward, I 
believe now more than ever that we 
must stand together as Americans uni-
fied in prayer for our State and Nation.

RECOGNIZING CALEB 
SCHUMACHER 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would 
like 
to 
recognize 
Caleb 
Schumacher on the enormous feat of 
making Eagle Scout. I was proud to 
join Caleb and his family this past 
weekend in Ocean City. 
Caleb’s Eagle Scout project was a 
flag drop box so that flags can be dis-
posed of properly. Caleb’s grandfather, 
who served as a sergeant in the Army 
in the Korean war, was the inspiration 
for this project. Caleb plans to become 
a computer engineer, and I know his 
intelligence and his drive will push him 
to accomplish anything he puts to his 
mind. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so very proud of 
Caleb. I know his mom, dad, and sisters 
are proud of him as well. His leadership 
skills and work ethic will serve him 
well, and I know he is destined for 
great things in life. 
Some folks look to movie stars or, 
heaven forbid, politicians as their 
idols. I always look to people like 
Caleb. He inspires me. 
Caleb, God bless you and your family, 
and God bless America.

CONGRATULATING DOTSON LEWIS 
OF CORPUS CHRISTI, TEXAS 
(Mr. CLOUD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Mr. Dotson 
Lewis of Corpus Christi, Texas, on 
being given the Sam Brown Award by 
the Texas Association of Sports Offi-
cials. This is the most prestigious 
award from the TASO Football Divi-
sion, and Mr. Lewis is only the third 
recipient. 
The award honors him for his many 
years of service, and I can think of no 
one more deserving than Mr. Lewis. 
Before retiring 2 years ago, Dotson 
Lewis served our community as a ref-
eree in both football and basketball for 
71 years. In 1977, he was the first execu-
tive director of the newly created 
Southwest Officials Association, now 
known as the TASO. He has also facili-
tated numerous exchanges between of-
ficials in Texas and in Japan, earning 
him the title Ambassador of American 
Football Officiating to Japan. 
Even after retirement, he continues 
to devote himself to service by teach-
ing a class on sports officiating, but his 
heart of service extends beyond the 
athletic arena. 
For 21 years, he served with our U.S. 
Army. Following his service, he dedi-
cated himself to serving our veterans. 
He started and facilitates a weekly cof-
fee group for veterans to connect with 
each other and share their experiences 
and also to connect them with vital re-
sources in the area. 
His guidance and leadership have 
benefited many in Texas, the United 
States, and others around the world. It 
is my privilege to recognize him and 
his outstanding achievements today.

PROTECTING ACCESS TO COVID–19 
HEALTHCARE TELEMEDICINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CASE). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
wanted to do something this evening in 
light of the angst which is election 
time. You hear somewhat sort of the 
hyperbolic language. I am actually 
hearing many of our friends on the left 
almost sound like it was 5 years ago, 
talking about preexisting conditions, 
ObamaCare. We have all come to a con-
sensus, I believe, as a political body 
and as a Nation, we are covering pre-
existing conditions. 
So one of the things I want to share 
and I am going to tie this in to what we 
are going through in the pandemic and 
an opportunity to go beyond what is 
the debate of the Republican alter-
native from a couple years ago on 
healthcare or the ACA and how I be-
lieve we have changed it. 
Remember, the ACA was a financing 
mechanism. It functionally said who 
got subsidized, who had to pay. Our Re-
publican alternative, functionally, was 
a financing mechanism. It was who had 
to pay and who got subsidized. 
What I am begging us all around here 
to think about is what we pay. Why 
isn’t this body coming together and 
moving 
creative, 
technology-driven 
ideas to change the price of healthcare? 
Because when we are doing the financ-
ing mechanisms, we are not saving our 
country. 
Remember, the single greatest driver 
of U.S. debt over the next 30 years—and 
it is really difficult politically to talk 
about—is Medicare. 
Well, if you are like I am, where you 
believe we have a moral obligation to

September 15, 2020 
protect Medicare and Social Security, 
we have a moral, ethical obligation, we 
also need to be honest about the debt. 
And I have spent the previous couple of 
years coming here and showing the 
charts of what was going on. And it 
was like silence from my brothers and 
sisters here because it is so uncomfort-
able to talk about. 
So what I am coming to the floor to-
night to do is, I just want to start the 
inkling of there are solutions. They are 
not perfect. They are going to have 
glitches, but they start to head us in a 
direction where we can change the 
price of healthcare and by doing that, 
you save Medicare. But you also save 
the country from the crushing debt 
that is coming. So this is a moment of 
optimism. 
I am going to grab this board, and 
this is just part of the thought experi-
ment I want to engage with. This one 
we picked up today. This is brand new. 
We understand the next generation of 
Apple Watch is coming with an oxygen 
sensor. 
Why is that part of the disruption 
that helps save the country? I need you 
to think creatively with me. 
It turns out that there is a study 
going on that basically looks at the 
concept of if we can know your oxygen, 
your blood oxygen calculations, we can 
see your heart rhythm, and those 
things. But also, your body tempera-
ture, we can calculate if you have a 
virus, if you are getting sick. 
Now, obviously, the statisticians— 
the experts—need to build the model 
and prove it, but what would happen if 
the thing you have on your wrist is 
functionally a traveling medical lab 
with you, monitoring your health all 
the time, producing the data, using the 
algorithm and telling you, Hey, guess 
what? We believe you have this because 
we are monitoring these things. 
Is that hopeful? 
Is that futuristic? 
Is it here? 
Because this watch, I guess, is out in 
the next few months. 
But it turns out that type of data 
coming off the technology we are able 
to have on our bodies, this body has 
not stepped up and gotten laws, the 
rules, the regulations, the reimburse-
ments to the point where technology 
can help us change the price of 
healthcare. 
So can we stop having just the darn 
stupid debates around here where we 
debate for hours on who is going to get 
subsidized and who has to pay? Can we 
start having honest conversations of 
what to pay? What can we as a body do 
to promote the technology, to promote 
optionality, to promote convenience? 
So part of my argument here is, we 
are actually living part of the disrup-
tion right now. A handful of Demo-
crats, and a number of us on the Re-
publican side, I have had—we have 
had—some telemedicine bills around 
here for years. And no one would hear 
them. We would do lip service. We 
would talk about, well, we are going to 
allow some telemedicine, maybe with 
the VA, but the concept that we were 
going to have CMS for Medicare/Med-
icaid patients—particularly Medicare— 
allowed the use of telemedicine. We 
know we have an army of lobbyists 
around here that were very uncomfort-
able. 
If I had one more staffer, lobbyist, 
even brothers and sisters who are Mem-
bers of Congress look at me and say, 
‘‘David, we need to do this slowly. We 
need to do it incrementally.’’ Well, 
what happened a few months ago? The 
pandemic. 
And we grabbed some of the language 
that we have had now for years and put 
it into one of the first coronavirus 
packages. And now telemedicine is re-
imbursable to our seniors. 
And what’s happened? 
We have had—and this one goes back 
to April—it’s my understanding the 
numbers 
have 
gotten 
dramatically 
more, but we haven’t been able to vet 
it—the use of telemedicine with seniors 
has skyrocketed. Satisfaction is off the 
charts. They are happy. The doctors we 
have been meeting with and talking to 
are actually happy and actually will 
tell you they are spending more time 
with their patients, being able to have 
a conversation, that patients are will-
ing to share more. We have the living 
example of the disruption happening 
right now. And all those who kept say-
ing, ‘‘David, let’s go slow, let’s do it in-
crementally,’’ it didn’t happen that 
way. 
We dove in, and it is working. We 
need to make it better. We need to 
make it permanent. Because a lot of 
folks don’t understand, when the pan-
demic is declared over, so does this 
telemedicine. It’s over. The reimburse-
ments, the access, the availability we 
have given to our seniors—who we are 
telling to stay home, to stay healthy— 
to rural America, so you don’t have to 
drive, it goes away. We need to make it 
permanent. 
But I am asking us to now think even 
broader. Instead of just doing what I 
am hoping—we have legislation to do 
this—to extend telemedicine, as we 
have made it available during this time 
of the pandemic. Why don’t we do that? 
Let’s extend it but let’s actually think 
broader. What can we do to make 
healthcare more accessible? 
I mean, how many speeches have hap-
pened on this floor talking about acces-
sibility for healthcare, for our poor, for 
those trapped in certain urban islands, 
those trapped in rural America, those 
trapped at home. 
I want us to get comfortable with the 
fact that the disruption is here, the 
technology is here. There are items 
like this where it is functionally a doc-
tor’s visit in your medicine cabinet. 
And it has the potential for changing 
the cost of healthcare. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s go through some of 
these. We want to protect the access to 
telemedicine, so our first piece of legis-
lation is—I am asking every Member of 
Congress to think this through. Talk to 
your constituents, talk to your med-
ical experts. What has their experience 
been like? And are you prepared to 
take this away from every senior and 
American 
who 
has 
had 
this 
optionality? Are you ready to take this 
away the day the pandemic is declared 
over? 
And then when you have the discus-
sion, the debate with people like me 
that actually believe in that tech-
nology, we can actually expand the def-
inition of telemedicine. So it is more 
than just talking to a doctor on your 
phone or doing FaceTime with that 
medical professional, but it is also the 
sensors and the data. 
You saw the very first board where 
we talked about a future watch that is 
actually coming in a few months that 
will be an oxygen sensor, a pulse rate 
sensor, a temperature sensor that you 
will have on your wrist that can actu-
ally do linear conversions because it 
will have multiple samples from you. 
And the algorithm can help tell you if 
something is happening to your body. 
But also, we need to move pieces of 
legislation so we can keep this, keep 
the reimbursement, keep it legal, keep 
it with us. 
Let’s actually take this to what we 
are experiencing right now. 
How many Americans are seniors? 
We have asked them to stay home. We 
have asked them to limit their con-
tacts. We have asked them to be care-
ful. We have given them telemedicine, 
but we need to take it to the next 
level. 
There are now products that are on 
the market, that are out there today— 
we need to start reimbursing them and 
taking care of them—where you can ac-
tually do your COVID test at home. 
You can get on that telemedicine, that 
phone call, talk to the medical profes-
sional, do the COVID test right there 
with him on the phone—there are mul-
tiple providers of this—and get your re-
sults in a couple of days. This is in-
stead of asking my father, who is in his 
mid-eighties, to get in the car and go 
wait in line at one of the drive-through 
testing sites, or someone else to go 
wait at a doctor’s office or an urgent 
care office, or wherever they’re doing 
this; this exists today. 
Why aren’t we reimbursing them? 
Why aren’t we making this available 
today? 
If we say we love and care for our 
most 
vulnerable 
populations, 
why 
aren’t we thinking of the future? 
Why aren’t we thinking of the con-
venience? 
Why aren’t we thinking of the tech-
nology? 
We need to do things like this and 
not be afraid of it. 
Yes, it is a disruption for a lot of 
business models out there that wants 
the person coming in to test, to come 
into their center. But this is the fu-
ture. And if we do this right, we can ex-
pand access. We can expand avail-
ability, and we can actually change the 
price curve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4419 
September 15, 2020 
We can make access to healthcare 
less expensive. And is this a Republican 
goal or Democrat goal? I think it just 
needs to be an American goal. 
So as we move forward, the impact— 
and there is a lot of—it is hard to read 
this slide, but I guess what I am trying 
to say here is: As you look at this, we 
went from basically only about—oh, 
excuse me. I had it wrong. 
In 2019, only about 11 percent used 
any type of telemedicine option. You 
called the medical professional, you 
told them your symptoms, you got 
some sort of diagnosis. We have had an 
explosion since then. 
In 2020, now, our numbers, we think, 
are already old because we wrote this 
slide about a month-and-a-half ago on 
the data we had then. It went from 11 
percent to 46 percent. We are hearing 
stories that it is substantially higher 
than that today. 
For those that were arguing for the 
incremental adoption of the tech-
nology, we hit a pandemic, we got to 
bathe in the fire, and it worked. Yeah, 
there are glitches, but it has worked. 
Asking people not to get in their car, 
not to actually go wait in the waiting 
room, not sit—it is here. 
How do we expand it? 
How do we make it even more acces-
sible? 
And how do we broaden the definition 
of what is telemedicine? 
And my argument in many ways here 
is more than just the simple adoption 
of technology. Moving away from the 
skepticism that, Oh, seniors aren’t 
going to know how to use it or like to 
use it. We have already removed that. 
We have demonstrated seniors figured 
it out very quickly. That sort of cyni-
cism that was out there. 
But can we, as a Congress—when we 
get beyond this election cycle, where 
we are busy knifing each other for 
things that we know are just rhetori-
cally stale—start giving a damn about 
the future of this country, about the 
availability of healthcare and what we 
are going to do to actually do some-
thing elegant, where we change the 
cost curve and we raise the accessi-
bility? I would think this would make 
both sides giddy. We just have to make 
it legal. 
And why I explained that is, a few 
months ago I was on the floor—and I 
have done this multiple times—we were 
showing some of the technology that is 
coming. And one was something that 
looked like a big kazoo. You blow into 
it and it would almost instantly tell 
you you had the flu. And the professor 
who had been working on this, in some 
of her writings, she talked about it 
saying, Then the algorithm could bang 
off your medical records, right off your 
phone, encrypted so it is nice and safe, 
and order your antivirals. 
Would that make society healthier? 
Would it increase accessibility? 
Would 
it 
lower 
the 
price 
of 
healthcare? 
Of course, it would. 
b 1800 
Anyone else know the problem with 
this technology? It is functionally ille-
gal today. 
The way we reimburse, the way we 
allow prescriptions to be written, it is 
a tough discussion because there are 
lots of special interest groups that we 
need to work with and respect their 
talents. 
But if we know the greatest fragility 
of future debt in our society is actually 
healthcare costs, why wouldn’t we em-
brace something that at least we 
haven’t completely made partisan yet? 
That is healthcare technology and the 
access and availability it brings to us. 
So, my discussion tonight is a very 
simple one. We have just lived the ex-
perience of COVID, of having so much 
of our population trapped at home, 
fearful to go out. As part of our legisla-
tion, we allowed access and reimburse-
ment to telemedicine. It has been 
adopted broadly. 
Is this one of those moments we are 
going to take the success we have had 
and keep it permanent by not forcing it 
to expire when the pandemic is de-
clared over? Are we going to actually 
be a little bit of futurists in saying we 
saw this experiment work for our soci-
ety—for our country, for our commu-
nities, for our seniors? Could we take 
the positive part of this experience and 
go further? 
That going further, what would hap-
pen if we do it the right way where it 
actually starts to help lower the cost 
of healthcare and increase accessi-
bility? It is before us. 
So many of us have been heartbroken 
with what we have gone through the 
last few months. We have ached when 
we have seen people lose their jobs, 
hearing of family members who have 
lost their lives. Are we going to find 
some things positive that we have 
learned over these last few very dif-
ficult months and carry those things 
forward? 
I am going to beg of the body to 
think this through, that is, the adop-
tion of technology as part of individual 
access to healthcare. Maybe we have to 
change the name because when we say 
telemedicine, we instantly think of 
looking 
at 
my 
phone 
and 
doing 
FaceTime and not realizing it also can 
be the data coming off your watch, the 
oxygen patch. Well, now we are about 
to have an oxygen sensor in the phone. 
But how do we make it that tele-
medicine is the use of technology to 
keep us healthy and also to find a fi-
nancial benefit of lowering the cost and 
increasing the accessibility? 
This is going to be one of my pas-
sions over the next few months and, if 
I am blessed to be reelected, over the 
coming couple of years. We need to 
make it permanent. We need to open up 
the definition. 
Things like the home testing, I really 
am begging the body to think about 
that if we do move another COVID bill, 
that we turn this into being reimburs-
able because this is a combination of 
home COVID tests that you tie into 
your telemedicine appointment, and 
you can get a result in, I think, one of 
them, within 48 hours. 
This is good stuff. They are out there 
today. There is a debate about whether 
they can be reimbursed. We need to fix 
this because we all get behind these 
microphones, and we wax eloquently of 
what we think, but it turns out there 
are actual solutions around us. 
So, that is my pitch. It is not a par-
ticularly complicated one. But with a 
couple of pieces of legislation that I am 
blessed to be sponsoring, and with 
some of our friends here—and I have 
some Democrats who are sponsoring 
with us, too—I think we are seeing a 
vision. We can actually deliver solu-
tions instead of just political rhetoric. 
Mr. Speaker, I think I was supposed 
to have a friend from Louisiana coming 
in. We were going to talk a little bit 
about the environment of what was 
about to just happen in Louisiana. 
Until he gets here, I did want to do one 
story, and let’s see if I can tell this 
without setting too many people on 
fire. 
I am blessed to be the dad of a little 
girl that is not even 5 years old yet. 
She will be in a couple of weeks. She 
started kindergarten, but the starting 
of her kindergarten was sitting behind 
a Chromebook laptop completely iso-
lated, whether it be at home for the 
first week or two, and then the second 
week or two sitting in an empty gym 
separated from anyone. 
I mean, the picture will rip your 
heart out. She is sitting behind a 
laptop with cardboard walls on the side 
of her. She would come home and say: 
Daddy, please don’t make me go. 
Daddy, I don’t like this. Daddy, please 
let me go with you. 
It was ripping my little girl apart. 
Then, this last week, my school dis-
trict allowed children to be in the 
classroom with their teacher. They 
have taken lots of safety precautions. I 
am blessed that, in my area, the statis-
tics have all fallen within the proto-
cols, the numbers, that it was safe. We 
only want schools to open if it is safe. 
Overnight, it was as if I have a dif-
ferent little girl. She was happy. She 
was joyful. ‘‘Daddy, I have friends.’’ 
The second day, I am a little disturbed. 
‘‘Daddy, I have a boyfriend.’’ As the fa-
ther of a soon-to-be 5-year-old, that 
was stressing. 
I am wondering how many other 
Americans have seen this with their 
kids, 
their 
grandkids? 
How 
many 
young people have we done such vio-
lence to not only their education but 
their emotional well-being, their abil-
ity to get services? 
I desperately ask everyone—because I 
know in so many school districts and 
the country, and even in my commu-
nity, the issue of opening schools has 
become political. It is not science. It is 
political. 
We see some of the protests from our 
teachers unions in some spots. Now, we 
have protests from our parents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4420 
September 15, 2020 
We all said we were going to try to 
address this using math, using science. 
But beyond that math and science— 
that is your benchmark—please, we 
need part of the consideration to be the 
emotional well-being of our kids. It 
also needs to be the well-being of their 
scholastics. 
Another project we are doing in the 
Joint Economic Committee—and I am 
going to geek out for a second— we are 
starting to do some math that says we 
may be damaging millions of Ameri-
cans in their future earning power. We 
are setting them back. We may be dam-
aging millions of Americans in their 
retirement. 
Because if you come to the tables, 
these actuarial tables that we have, 
and say: What happens if I lost earning 
power or I lost growth in my Social Se-
curity, in my pension, and even my ca-
reer path for several months, for a 
year? Have we taken a step backward 
and understood what other things are 
happening in our communities? 
It turns out one of the linchpins for 
the next part of the spiking of employ-
ment coming back, people getting back 
into society and our communities, is a 
barrier called daycare and schools. How 
many parents are doing their darndest 
to work from home, but the difficulty 
is doing it when your child is in the 
next room sitting behind a laptop com-
pletely depressed, trying to do tele-
school. 
We really need to have a tough con-
versation and be honest with the num-
bers and strip the crazy partisan de-
bate over: Is opening schools partisan? 
It is insanity. We have loved and 
cared for our kids. Let’s love on them. 
Let’s do the right thing. 
I am sorry to personalize the story, 
but I saw it through the lens of a 5- 
year-old. I can only imagine what so 
many others have gone through with 
their children. 
I mean, I am hearing stories of ado-
lescents—we had another one in my 
community just last week—who have 
taken their lives. Now, I don’t know if 
that is tied to not being able to social-
ize or not being able to get counseling 
services or just the human relations of 
being at school. I don’t know. But you 
do have to take a step backward and 
think about it. 
Are we willing to engage in this type 
of cruelty to our children, to those who 
are trying to build their careers so 
they can have a healthy retirement, 
take care of their family for future in-
vestments, for just the ability to be 
part of the American Dream? Because 
we have some well-organized groups 
out there that see a political advan-
tage. That is the definition of cruelty. 
Let’s take a step backward, go back 
to our earlier promises that we were 
going to do this through science. It is 
as much as the COVID statistics in 
your community and your school dis-
trict as the human element of let’s 
take care of our kids, let’s actually 
also take care of those parents. Let’s 
do the right thing here. 
I am so disappointed in so many of 
my brothers and sisters who are in the 
world of politics who are just blinded 
with a level of rage, that the need to 
win the election—well, I have sort of 
said it. 
Let’s move away from this sort of 
cruelty and move back to solutions. 
Whether it be my hope that we found a 
way to make healthcare more acces-
sible and more affordable to what we 
are going to do for our families to 
allow them to safely go back to school. 
My friend from Louisiana is here. I 
want to share my time with him, but I 
also want to understand what is about 
to happen with the hurricane. 
Didn’t you get blasted just a couple 
of weeks ago with very, very heavy 
rains? 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Incred-
ibly powerful winds, good sir. Yes, sir. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Look, I have a 
soft spot. My mother was from Baton 
Rouge. It is one of the reasons I love 
the food. And every time I hear your 
accent, I think of my extended family. 
But I wanted to give you some time. 
Tell us what is happening in your com-
munity, and let us know, beyond 
thoughts and prayers, what is needed. 
I yield to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. I thank 
my friend, the gentleman, for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today simply to 
remind America of southwest Louisi-
ana’s plight in the wake of Hurricane 
Laura. While the national media and 
much of America has moved on, I will 
not allow the people of Louisiana to be 
forgotten here in Congress. 
Just 2 weeks ago, my district wit-
nessed the most powerful hurricane in 
our State’s modern history, sustained 
winds 
above 
150-miles-per-hour, 
a 
storm surge over 10 feet, a catastrophic 
loss across much of the State. 
Thousands of families have been dis-
placed. Many are still without power, 
without water, without access to the 
internet, without sanitation. Virtually 
all infrastructure, public and private, 
was heavily damaged. 
Behind me are images from my dis-
trict. These are not isolated examples. 
This is every street, every neighbor-
hood, and every business across two en-
tire parishes of southwest Louisiana 
and beyond. 
I am grateful to President Trump for 
his quick response. He was on the 
ground just as soon as we could safely 
land Air Force One. I am grateful for 
his response and his strong commit-
ment. 
I am so thankful for the outpouring 
of support from faith-based and chari-
table 
organizations 
and 
from 
the 
countless first responders and volun-
teers who are working tirelessly to 
help Louisiana recover. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time.

HURRICANE LAURA RECOVERY IN 
LOUISIANA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. HIGGINS) is recognized for 
the remainder of the hour as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. 
HIGGINS 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, my colleagues in Congress 
should provide, as I was saying, every 
necessary Federal resource. We must 
do everything in our power to ensure 
that southwest Louisiana is not forgot-
ten as we work through the long and 
difficult recovery. 
I have seen firsthand the best of Lou-
isiana, neighbors helping neighbors, 
communities coming together to re-
build and recover. 
It is what Louisiana does. We stand 
back up. Our people are resilient. We 
will rebuild. 
Louisiana, stand strong. You are not 
alone. You are loved. You are re-
spected. You will never be forgotten. 
We stand with you as one through this 
recovery. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

DEFENDING 
AMERICA’S 
VALUES 
AND 
PROTECTING 
AMERICA’S 
COMMUNITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) 
for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the 
topic of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, to-
day’s Special Order, which I am proud 
to host, is about defending America’s 
values and protecting America’s com-
munities. 
I have no doubt that the greatness of 
our beloved country can be found in 
‘‘We the People,’’ and I would say that 
America is great because of the people 
and the values which they hold so dear: 
the things that we believe collectively, 
the ideals that we hold out and strive 
for as a nation, imperfect people striv-
ing for a more perfect Union. And those 
values distinguish this experiment in 
liberty and democracy. 
There is a reason that people from all 
over the world literally risk their lives 
to come here to be a part of this experi-
ment in self-government, and I would 
say those ideals consist, first and fore-
most, in the belief that the American 
people run the affairs of this country, 
and we believe in that doctrine of pop-
ular sovereignty. 
We believe that strong and healthy 
nations are nothing more than the cu-
mulative effect of strong and healthy 
families; that is, the family is the cor-
nerstone, at the cellular level it is the

strength of the fabric of this country, 
and we should not make any apologies 
for policies that strengthen that core 
fabric. 
We believe in the rule of law. We be-
lieve in the Constitution. We believe 
that we are a nation of laws, not of 
men. And we in this Chamber, in this 
great body of the people’s House, 
should uphold, should promote, should 
defend these values; and when they are 
under assault and when they are not 
being lived up to, we should call that 
out. We should make sure that we are 
keepers of these values. 
I have a lot to say about one element 
that is a cornerstone of our democracy, 
and, quite frankly, it is a cornerstone 
of civil society anywhere, and that is 
law and order. That is justice. 
These are words, Mr. Speaker, that 
are easily found in the mission state-
ment of our Federal Government, ar-
ticulated, framed in the Constitution’s 
preamble. 
Domestic 
tranquillity—nobody, 
I 
would submit, knows more about the 
importance of rule of law, justice, and 
domestic tranquillity than my col-
league, Mr. CLAY HIGGINS from Lou-
isiana. He has been a decorated law en-
forcement officer. 
Like all of our men and women in 
uniform, he has put everything on the 
line to keep the bad guys away from 
our law-abiding citizens and their fam-
ilies and to make sure that we restrain 
evil and chaos so that we can continue 
the persistence of this great constitu-
tional democratic Republic. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS), my dear 
friend. 
Mr. 
HIGGINS 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I 
thank you, Mr. Speaker, for recog-
nizing me. 
My friend and colleague is discussing 
the deterioration of traditional Amer-
ican values in our Nation this evening, 
and I think it is appropriate that we as 
a nation take pause and reflect upon 
our own lives, our own families and our 
histories, the traditions and cultures 
which we represent, the men and 
women we strive to be as we seek, from 
bended knee, the very deepest part of 
ourselves, the whisper of our Lord Him-
self within us, His spirit that dwells 
there, to seek perhaps the best part of 
us, the undiscovered and sometimes 
difficult-to-recognize truth that He has 
placed within our breast. 
During the course of my life—I am 59 
years old. I was born in 1961, the sev-
enth of eight children. I have witnessed 
the deterioration of traditional Amer-
ican values. 
As a failed and fallen man, arisen 
myself, redeemed by the blood of our 
Lord and savior, I have contributed to 
the demise and deterioration of our so-
ciety in my small part. I struggle as a 
man. 
Our journey, if you will, is to recog-
nize that we are imperfect and to seek 
that perfection, for our Nation itself 
was founded by imperfect men who 
were driven by perfect intent. 
The founding words of our original 
documents include, ‘‘in order to form a 
more perfect Union.’’ This is a very 
humble statement by men of wisdom 
and great stature of spirit. ‘‘In order to 
form a more perfect Union’’ are words 
that recognize that we are imperfect 
men. 
Therefore, during this time, this era 
of turmoil and tribulation and violence 
and mob rule, great division—included 
amongst that division is this Cham-
ber—I think it is appropriate that my 
friend, that my brother brings this to 
the focus of the Nation today. 
Growing up in high school in the sev-
enties, attended high school in the sev-
enties, every vehicle in the parking lot, 
a country school, had a rifle or a shot-
gun in the back glass, maybe a pistol 
under the seat, maybe all three. We 
didn’t have school shootings. 
When I began college in 1979 at LSU, 
I began to work my way through col-
lege as a carpenter. The company I 
worked for, we did historical renova-
tions. In order to qualify, Mr. Speaker 
and my friend, for the historical plaque 
for that renovation, a certain process 
had to be followed. We had to deter-
mine the original structure of that res-
idence. You could tell by the nature of 
the cut, whether it was a power cut or 
hand cut, how old it was; and with 
careful review and knowledgeable eyes, 
you knew exactly how that home was 
originally built. This is what fas-
cinated me as a young man beginning 
college and working hard with my 
hands with the skills my father had 
taught me. 
Do you know what these houses built 
100 years ago in the middle of a large 
city, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, do you 
know what they didn’t have, Mr. 
Speaker and my friend? 
I will answer that question to ob-
serve the rules of the House. 
Do you know what those houses did 
not have 100 years ago? Locks. They 
had no locks. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I ask us all to re-
flect on what happened to that coun-
try. What happened to the country that 
was bequeathed unto us, a country 
where the parking lots of high schools 
were filled with vehicles with weapons 
and we had no school shootings, a 
country where homes were built in cit-
ies with no locks? What happened to 
that country? 
I am prayerful that the answer to 
what happened to that country lies, as 
it always has, deep within us as men 
and women, as children of God. And we 
must seek, as a nation and within this 
Chamber, by this body, we must seek 
the guidance of our savior, His whisper 
deep to guide us through these trou-
bling times. 
I am thankful for men and leaders 
like 
my 
friend 
Representative 
ARRINGTON, who has, by the grace of 
God, brought this topic to the floor 
today, and I am humbled that he would 
allow me to rise unscripted and address 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
and the American people, whom I love. 
Let us return to the civility, love, 
and respect that founded our Nation, 
for therein is born courage and the will 
to move forward through any chal-
lenge. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I am 
so grateful that my colleague and dear 
friend, Representative HIGGINS, joined 
this important conversation. 
It is clear, Mr. Speaker, my friend 
was not prepared or scripted formally, 
but he carries this great American 
story and the love and passion for pub-
lic service and for a better, stronger, 
safer, freer America in his heart. If you 
cut this man, he bleeds red, white, and 
blue, and I feel blessed to serve along-
side of him. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his re-
marks. 
Mr. Speaker, as we talk about those 
values that have made America great 
and as we look out on the near horizon, 
we see a tremendous contrast and a 
distinct, maybe as definitive and dis-
tinct as we have ever had before the 
electorate of the vision, plans, and 
policies of one party versus another: 
One with vast greater authority and 
power in the government; one that 
would continue to treasure, defend, and 
promote free people in a free country. 
One would want to plan the economy 
from Washington, D.C.; the other vi-
sion and plan and policies would trust 
the ingenuity and the God-given gifts 
of the American people to create value 
for their fellow Americans and the free 
exchange of ideas of services and prod-
ucts, the free enterprise system, which 
has made this country the most pros-
perous country on the face of the plan-
et and in the history of the world. 
b 1830 
Yes, Mr. Speaker, it is freedom. And 
it is our core values of in God we trust 
and out of many one that we have ele-
vated the human spirit like no other 
system of self-governance. 
And I have friends here who are 
friends of freedom. They are champions 
of the Constitution. And they are keep-
ers of the flame of these precious val-
ues that every day they take to the 
floor of the House to defend. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to CHIP ROY, a 
fellow Texan, so he may come and 
share his heart. He was so eloquent in 
our first series on defending America’s 
values. Today we have added to that 
defending and protecting our commu-
nities and respecting rule of law. 
Mr. CHIP ROY from the Lone Star 
State. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Texas for yielding. 
I would note, my friend, I think we 
have got another little bit of time re-
served on the back end that I will take 
and see my time, and I am happy to let 
others use that time as well, if we go 
over and blend that time together, and 
I would be happy to turn it over to my 
colleagues, as well. 
I just want to thank you for doing 
this. 
Again, this institution, we ought to 
be meeting here together with 435

Members present. It is our obligation 
and our solemn duty to do so, but in-
stead, we continue to play political 
games, political theater. And we are 
seeing the carnage on our streets in 
terms of businesses and in terms of real 
lives, in terms of law enforcement. 
Two deputies in Los Angeles shot 
point blank just this last week, and 
people egging it on, cheering it on and 
encouraging them to die. What kind of 
cultural rot do we have in our commu-
nities while this body sits here empty, 
putting on a show because that is what 
this body has become, putting on a 
show? 
So I would say to the Speaker of the 
House: Where are you? Why is the 
Speaker not here right now? Why is the 
majority leader not right here right 
now? 
We come back in to finally meet in 
September. We have had 19 days so far 
of voting on the floor of this body over 
the last 6 months. Think about that. It 
is absolutely irresponsible. 
I say: Where is the Speaker? Why 
aren’t we here doing the hard work for 
the American people so that we can get 
our small businesses working again, 
get our economy back again? 
And why aren’t we right here stand-
ing up unified, saying that we stand 
alongside the law enforcement commu-
nity of the United States? Why aren’t 
we standing up with the cops: Federal, 
State, and local? Why aren’t we saying 
we stand with them, this body, the peo-
ple’s House? 
And that is what this is about, Amer-
ican greatness and standing up and 
protecting 
our 
communities, 
pro-
tecting those values, securing the 
blessings of liberty as articulated in 
the Constitution of the United States 
which reflects the Declaration of Inde-
pendence which articulated the rights 
of mankind for the first time in human 
history. 
That is what this Nation is about, 
and I am glad to stand up, and I will 
join you in a little bit more. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague, and I 
would just pose the question to the 
American people who are watching us 
in the people’s House: Should we be fo-
cused on what our Speaker and Demo-
cratic colleagues suggest is an impera-
tive in this time of unprecedented cri-
sis, unprecedented lawlessness, to have 
a sense of Congress, or a House Resolu-
tion that condemns the use of the place 
of origin of this virus? Or should we 
have a sense of Congress uniting all 
Americans in condemning the lawless-
ness and the violence that is burning 
through the great American cities 
without nigh even a word. 
I would suggest my colleagues who 
remain silent are complicit as much as 
the local leaders who have abandoned 
their law-abiding citizens at such a 
time as this. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
ROY for his love of country and his pas-
sion for public service. 
Mr. Speaker, I will pass the mike, if 
you will, to my colleague from the 
Peach State, who is—I think he would 
be okay with me saying that he works 
for the people of the 10th District of 
Georgia, but he serves the King of 
Kings. He was a minister of the gospel 
and will always be first and foremost a 
proud representative and ambassador 
of our Lord Jesus. Again, honored to 
serve with him. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to Georgia’s 10th 
District Representative JODY HICE. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I ap-
preciate those kind words, and it is an 
honor, indeed, in every way to serve 
with you both here in the Congress and 
for the kingdom of our Lord. 
I go back, and I think of some of the 
words of our very first President. He 
said that there were two indispensable 
supports, indispensable supports, upon 
which this entire Nation rests. They 
were religion and morality. 
And about those things he said: In 
vain would that person claim the trib-
ute of patriotism, who would labor to 
subvert these two pillars of human 
happiness. In fact, he said, you could 
not claim to be a patriot if you did not 
understand the role of religion and mo-
rality as indispensable supports of this 
great country. 
And the reason for that is because 
this concept of limited government can 
only work when the people are able to 
self-govern their own lives with an au-
thentic understanding of right and 
wrong. 
It is when people are able to govern 
their lives properly that we are able to 
enjoy the blessings of liberty in a coun-
try with limited government over-
seeing and bearing down on our lives. 
And so these are indispensable sup-
ports, supports these days that we are 
chipping away at, chipping away at on 
a regular basis. We see the results of it 
as now night after night on television 
we are watching radical left groups hi-
jacking our cities and turning them 
into war zones. 
We are watching the horror, the spec-
tacle of the violence and the burning 
and the looting, the destruction of 
human lives and businesses, of dreams, 
of what America consists of. And here 
we sit in this place doing virtually 
nothing about it. The silence is not 
only deafening, it is frightful, as we sit 
here doing nothing. 
In fact, the chants continue. From 
the other side of the aisle it seems as 
though there is an embracing of these 
types of chants that all cops are bad, to 
defund the police. It is as though we 
don’t realize that it is impossible to 
have law and order if in the mix of it 
somewhere we don’t have law enforce-
ment. These types of chants are not 
only idiotic, they are dangerous, and 
they have consequences. This type of 
rhetoric in and of itself lights a fire for 
more of it. And we are watching the 
consequences, as my friend just talked 
about a few moments ago, as police of-
ficers are killed and shot and cities de-
stroyed. 
Is this the kind of country we want 
to leave to our children and our grand-
children? Do we want to pass this prob-
lem on to them and say: Tag, you’re it; 
you go fix it? 
This is our country, both sides of the 
aisle. This is our country. These are 
our dreams. These are our values of life 
and liberty and the pursuit of happi-
ness, and we are watching them burn 
down right in front of us while we do 
nothing about it. 
Now is the time for this Chamber to 
stand up and to be vocal that we as 
Americans, from both sides of the aisle, 
love those things that unite us as a Na-
tion, as we continue down this path of 
opposition to the Judeo-Christian prin-
ciples upon which our Nation was 
founded on. The truth is Marxism and 
anarchy have no place in America, and 
it is our responsibility to defend those 
rights, to defend those blessings. Now 
is the time to stand up and discontinue 
this assault on our country and the 
values that bring us together and bring 
people from all over the world to this 
great Nation, rather than for us to con-
tinue burning them down. 
I want to thank my friend. The re-
ality is if we do not stand up for Amer-
ican values and these great principles, 
no one else will. It is our task in this 
Chamber to do the right thing. And I 
deeply appreciate my friend for leading 
the way on this issue and for allowing 
me a few moments to speak. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I am 
honored to have Representative JODY 
HICE, a warrior for America’s tradi-
tional values, for our Constitution, for 
our rule of law join in this important 
conversation with the American people 
in the people’s House. I am honored to 
have you and grateful for your words. 
Who would have thought that we 
would be here while once great Amer-
ican cities are being terrorized by vio-
lent, mob thugs who kill law enforce-
ment officers in cold blood and then go 
to the hospital for those who have sur-
vived and to cry death to the cops. 
These are men and women who risk 
their life and limb to make sure we 
have civil order, justice, and domestic 
tranquility at the heart of this great 
Nation, defense, safety, security for 
our fellow Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, VICKY HARTZLER is an-
other champion for the people of the 
Fourth District of Missouri. She is the 
chairwoman of the Value Action Team, 
so she is the lead keeper of that flame, 
and we are honored that she is here 
from the Show Me State. 
And after all is said and done in 
Washington—more is said than done— 
she is a show-me leader. She is a doer, 
and she is fighting every day for these 
American values and for the next gen-
eration of Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mrs. VICKY 
HARTZLER. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Representative ARRINGTON
for 
yielding and for hosting this event and 
focusing on our need to protect Amer-
ica’s communities. With what is hap-
pening right now this topic is foremost 
in everyone’s minds, and the need 
could not be greater.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4423 
September 15, 2020 
Daily we are shown footage of yet an-
other riot in one of America’s great 
cities. Mobs are destroying property, 
defacing buildings, breaking out win-
dows of family-owned businesses, and 
looting the merchandise. Cars are 
being set on fire, and people are getting 
hurt. 
We need safe and secure neighbor-
hoods again. We need law and order to 
be restored. We need peace to prevail in 
our hearts, in our families, and in our 
communities. 
That is where our peace officers come 
in. They are the ones who keep the 
peace. They are the ones who allow our 
families to live in safety, security, 
peace and quiet. We need that now. We 
need them now. 
They sometimes are called law en-
forcement officers. That is accurate, 
but I like another term, peace officers. 
Because that is what they are. 
Every year during Police Week, May 
15 is designated as Peace Officers Me-
morial Day to pay tribute to the local, 
State, and Federal peace officers who 
have died or who have been disabled in 
the line of duty. 
Sadly, I have had a police officer 
from my district, whose name was 
added to this memorial. And sadly, 
many more names are going to be 
added to the memorial next year, in-
cluding a selfless peace officer from 
Missouri named David Dorn. 
David had served his fellow man pre-
serving the peace for over 38 years. He 
was a loyal friend, a devoted husband, 
and a beloved member of the St. Louis 
community. And on the night of June 
2nd he volunteered to help a friend in 
need who owned a small business, 
which was in danger of being destroyed 
by looters and rioters. He didn’t want 
his friend’s life’s work to be turned 
into rubble, so he went down to help by 
sitting in front of the business and, 
hopefully, discouraging any harm from 
being done to his friend’s business. 
Tragically, David was fatally shot by 
violent protestors, and left to die on 
the sidewalk. His execution was broad-
cast live on Facebook while his son 
watched at home. No arrests were 
made. His killer got away in the thick-
et of violence and riots. 
Nothing 
about 
this 
protest 
was 
peaceful. There are peaceful protests, 
and I commend them. There is a na-
tional conversation that is worth hav-
ing to ensure everyone feels safe in our 
communities, but what we are seeing 
night after night in many of our cities 
is not a peaceful protest. It is thugs hi-
jacking a legitimate cause to advance 
their agenda of personal gain, anarchy, 
and destruction. And it must end. 
We must work to bring peace back 
into our communities by restoring law 
and order, by valuing our selfless peace 
officers, and by establishing clear puni-
tive consequences for those who incite 
violence. 
b 1845 
We must deter and stop those who in-
cite riots in any capacity, from orga-
nizing and promoting a riot to partici-
pating or assisting those who do. Those 
who loot and destroy must be held to 
account. 
That is why I am proud to support 
H.R. 8031, the David Dorn Act of 2020. 
This bill increases the maximum im-
prisonment penalty for rioting to 10 
years and sets the minimum fine to 
$1,000. 
It sends a clear message to rioters 
that their reckless actions are rep-
rehensible and that we are committed 
to making sure not a single peace offi-
cer faces the same fate as David Dorn. 
The answer to this mayhem is not to 
defund our peace officers; it is to de-
fend them and to give them the tools 
that they need to keep the peace. 
In 
the 
Commitment 
to 
America 
House Republicans announced today, 
we propose to increase funding by $1.75 
billion for better police training, com-
munity policing, and more equipment, 
including 500,000 more body cameras. 
This is the right way to secure the 
peace, not by destroying our neighbor-
hoods. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on all Americans 
to work together to be peacemakers 
and restore peace and quiet and secu-
rity to our neighborhoods and to em-
brace and defend the values that made 
America great. 
Now is our time of decision; now is 
when we will choose which road we will 
go on; and now is the time to stand up 
and to defend what we know is best and 
true and right and will truly bring se-
curity and peace to our neighborhoods. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman and dear friend 
from the Show Me State for showing us 
the right path to condemn this vio-
lence, to support our men and women 
in uniform who are risking life and 
limb to keep us safe and to keep the 
bad guys away. 
Mr. Speaker, how much time is re-
maining on our Special Order? I fear 
my time is running short, as you stand 
from your chair. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 15 seconds re-
maining. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
know we have 30 more minutes that 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) 
was kind enough to share in the con-
text of Defending America’s Values. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
CHIP ROY for joining me tonight on the 
Special Order, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
PROTECTING AMERICA’S VALUES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) 
for organizing this Special Order to 
talk about such an important topic. 
Mr. Speaker, I have some things that 
I am going to talk about as well, but I 
yield to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BAIRD). 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the time, and I thank my friend 
from Texas for giving me this oppor-
tunity. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the timeless American principles of 
freedom, equality, and opportunity. 
These principles are the foundation on 
which our Nation was built, an idea 
that all men are created equal and 
have certain unalienable rights given 
by our creator. 
You can come to America and be free 
to pursue your dreams and be equal to 
your peers in the eyes of the law. 
There are some people who believe 
that socialism is a better tool to 
achieve the American Dream. Using 
history as a guide, we know that this is 
wrong. 
Our Constitution is special because it 
limits the power of government while 
safeguarding our freedoms and our civil 
rights. 
As we strive to make this country 
better, let us remember the selfless 
Americans who throughout our history 
have struggled, fought, and died in the 
hopes of creating a more perfect union. 
I will fight to keep America as the 
shining light on the hill. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, we 
have one more defender of America’s 
values, and he is a constitutional 
scholar and attorney, but he also is the 
leader of the largest conservative cau-
cus in the Republican Conference and a 
dear friend of us all. We are grateful for 
his time, Mr. MIKE JOHNSON from the 
great State of Louisiana. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I give thanks to both the gen-
tlemen from Texas for organizing this 
Special Order tonight, to all of our col-
leagues who have spoken tonight, and 
to my dear friend Congressman BAIRD 
for all that he has given for his coun-
try. The words that he shared he means 
from his heart, and he has shown and 
proven that. 
We organized this Special Order to 
talk about protecting America’s values 
and protecting our communities. 
There is a lot of outrage. There is a 
lot of alarm in the country today. And 
it is justified. 
It was just a couple of days ago, of 
course, in Los Angeles where two sher-
iff’s deputies, a 24-year-old man and a 
31-year-old young mother, were bru-
tally attacked as they just sat in their 
police cruiser. 
As they were rushed to the hospital, 
protesters were blocking the entrances 
and exits to the emergency room, 
chanting: ‘‘We hope they die. Kill the 
police.’’ 
It is outrageous. It is alarming. 
This is just the latest example, of 
course, of the violence and vitriol

September 15, 2020 
going largely ignored by the Democrat 
majority in the House. Unfortunately, 
it is the predictable result of what hap-
pens when leaders make radical calls 
to defund the police. 
We have widespread unrest in major 
cities across this country right now. 
We have violent riots and businesses 
being destroyed and law enforcement 
officers 
being 
targets 
of 
heinous 
crimes, things that would have been 
unthinkable even a couple of years ago. 
In Portland, we have leftwing groups 
that set a police station on fire, be-
sieged a Federal courthouse for weeks 
on end. 
In Seattle, leftwing activists created 
an autonomous zone, they said. They 
evicted police and occupied the aban-
doned precinct. 
In Chicago, 31 police officers were in-
jured in riots that occurred in July and 
August. 
In Minnesota and Wisconsin, rioters 
exploited peaceful protests as a vehicle 
to incite violence and create chaos. 
Here in the Nation’s Capital just up 
the street, leftwing groups staged a 
mock execution of the President of the 
United States and then harassed people 
as they left the White House. 
The economic fallout from all this, of 
course, will be disastrous. The human 
toll will take generations to recover. 
We have seen reports from minority- 
owned small businesses, for example, in 
these communities where a person has 
worked their entire life just to build a 
business, to build a legacy to pass 
along to their children and grand-
children, all to have it go up in flames 
because their city leadership refused to 
preserve law and order. 
We have seen the President’s actions, 
and we know that he is doing all that 
he possibly can to restore order in 
these cities. But, of course, he is being 
rebuffed by these leftwing mayors at 
every turn. 
I mean, the Portland mayor has re-
jected offers of Federal assistance mul-
tiple times. The rioters who are actu-
ally arrested by local police are simply 
released by the district attorney so 
they can just return again to create 
chaos the next evening. 
Despite this stonewalling, Attorney 
General Barr is doing his job. Sec-
retary Wolf is doing his job. They have 
been able to secure the arrest of dozens 
of bad actors, but we all know this is 
just the tip of the iceberg. 
The question remains, what do we in 
Congress begin to do to tackle this 
issue? 
I would suggest that my friends on 
the other side can start right here in 
this building by at least first acknowl-
edging that there is a problem. I mean, 
it doesn’t seem too much to ask to de-
nounce the violence that is plaguing so 
many parts of the country. 
Mr. Speaker, you could imagine our 
dismay in the House Judiciary Com-
mittee when we heard our chairman 
call the Antifa violence in Portland a 
‘‘myth.’’ 
I mean, he contends that all this 
chaos and destruction is merely a fig-
ment of our imagination. One month 
after the chairman made those re-
marks, a self-proclaimed Antifa mem-
ber murdered a Trump rally partici-
pant in Portland in cold blood. 
We have been calling for weeks for 
the chairman to hold hearings in the 
Judiciary Committee to look into this 
widespread violence. We in the Judici-
ary Committee are uniquely situated, 
because of our jurisdiction, to dive into 
this crisis of leftwing violence and for-
mulate policy solutions that will pro-
tect the life and property of all Ameri-
cans. But the chairman would rather 
sweep things under the rug and brush it 
off as a mere myth. 
The 
Democrat 
silence 
and 
dismissiveness have turned into a real 
life-or-death situation for millions of 
Americans now. 
I know our side is ready and willing 
to act. This is not just idle discussion 
tonight. We are not just standing up 
here talking about America’s values 
and the need to protect our commu-
nities. We are ready to act. 
It is time to call out these leftwing 
groups for what they are, to denounce 
specifically the violence and the chaos 
they create, and to restore law and 
order for the American people. This ac-
tion is our responsibility, and it is long 
overdue. We will keep pushing on this 
side of the aisle to make this happen. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for the time, and I appreciate what my 
friend stands for. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON) for his heartfelt remarks about 
something that is such an important 
topic. I thank him for his steadfast 
commitment to the Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for ar-
ranging this earlier gathering where we 
could all join together in this impor-
tant moment to talk about this. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like for those 
sitting at home to focus in on this 
number 43. This number 43, you want 
to know what this number represents? 
This number represents the number of 
law enforcement officers who have 
been killed thus far in 2020—43 law en-
forcement 
officers 
who 
have 
been 
killed thus far in 2020, over 40 percent 
more than in the same period in 2019. 
Eight were categorized as premedi-
tated murder. Two were a victim of 
unprovoked attacks. Eight fatal shots 
were fired at pointblank range, zero to 
5 feet from the officer; eight shot in the 
front of the head, two from the back of 
the head, six in the neck, nine in the 
chest. 
These are 43 law enforcement officers 
who have lost their lives in 2020. 
Where is the NBA? Where is the 
NBA? 
Where is the Speaker of the House? 
That is what I want to know. Where is 
the Speaker of the House? Condemning 
43 law enforcement officers who have 
been murdered. 
Are their names on the back of any 
jerseys, or is that just for preening and 
posturing by the true privileged who 
play sports for a living? 
These are real people. 
David Dorn died June 2 at 2:30 a.m. in 
the middle of the street after he was 
shot in the torso while attempting to 
protect a friend’s pawnshop from sus-
pected looters. Mr. Dorn had served 38 
years in the St. Louis Police Depart-
ment before retiring. 
David Patrick Underwood died from 
gunshot wounds after he was shot from 
a vehicle on May 29 in Oakland, Cali-
fornia. He was working as a contract 
security officer for Federal Protective 
Services. 
According to authorities, the man 
charged in the murder of Mr. Under-
wood had specifically traveled to Oak-
land with the intent to kill police. He 
thought he could get away with it due 
to the large protest gatherings. 
Sergeant Damon Gutzwiller was in-
vestigating a suspect vehicle linked to 
this case when he, too, was killed after 
being ambushed with explosive devices 
and an assault rifle. He had served the 
Santa Cruz County community since 
2006. 
Shay Mikalonis, a Las Vegas Metro-
politan Police officer, was seriously in-
jured after being shot in the head while 
attempting to disperse protesters in 
June. 
This week—we have already alluded 
to it—two L.A. County sheriff’s depu-
ties were sitting in their vehicle when 
they were ambushed and shot, am-
bushed and shot in the streets of Los 
Angeles. The deputies, a 31-year-old 
mother and a 24-year-old man, were 
transported to a local hospital. While 
fighting for their lives, a group of 
protestors arrived at the hospital and 
shouted: ‘‘We hope they die.’’ 
This is what is happening on the 
streets of America right now, and it is 
being fomented by our so-called na-
tional leaders. 
Again, I would like to say, where is 
the people’s House? Going out for a 
fundraiser? Having a nice dinner here 
in Washington, D.C., right now? Get-
ting a steak dinner with somebody, 
patting each other on the back? Where 
are they? 
Mr. Speaker, do you hear the echo of 
my voice? It is echoing for a reason. 
This Chamber is empty, with the ex-
ception of one or two colleagues. 
Where is the Speaker? It is almost 
like that book, ‘‘Where’s Waldo?’’ 
Where is the Speaker? Let’s walk 
around Washington, D.C. Let’s go try 
to find the Speaker because she sure as 
heck is not here right now on the floor 
of the House of Representatives leading 
this body. We are sure not having any 
votes right now. We are not having 
amendments. We are not having any 
debate. 
Forty-three. Forty-three dead law 
enforcement officers.

government shutdown in the face of a 
virus. 
As we talked about all these riots, I 
read with interest the story of 93 per-
cent 
peaceful, 
leaving 
7 
percent 
unpeaceful. All the headlines said 93 
percent peaceful. 
Well, how about that 7 percent, in-
cluding roughly 550 violent demonstra-
tions across the county since June? 
Minneapolis Star Tribune: More than 
360 businesses across Twin Cities van-
dalized, 
looted; 
66 
destroyed 
com-
pletely by fire. Property damage to 
more than 1,500 locations. Set fire to 
nearly 150 buildings. 
Insurance experts estimate the cost 
to be $500 million. 
Portland: $20 million in damage. 
How about some of these headlines? 
‘‘Riots, Arson Leave Minnesota Com-
munities of Color Devastated.’’ 
Philadelphia, ‘‘Philadelphia Black- 
Owned 
Businesses 
Damaged 
and 
Looted.’’ 
New York Times said: ‘‘ . . . busi-
nesses, already ailing from an outbreak 
of the coronavirus that has been par-
ticularly devastating to small and mi-
nority-owned business, may not re-
cover.’’ 
FOX Milwaukee: ‘‘Many Milwaukee 
businesses damaged by vandals during 
violent protests are minority owned.’’ 
Between May 25 and June 8, in the 
heat of a lot of these protests, at least 
17 people were killed. 
What is the carnage in the Black 
community? I read a stat recently that 
upwards of 45 percent of Black-owned 
businesses have closed down since the 
beginning of the pandemic as we know 
it and during this time of civil unrest. 
Is the NBA wearing anybody’s names 
who lost a business on their jersey? Are 
they painting any of their names on 
the floor while they make $20 million 
to play basketball, or $50 million? No, 
I don’t see that. 
Why aren’t we having a resolution 
here with 435 Members saying we stand 
up for law enforcement? That is not to 
say we can’t have a vigorous debate 
about court-created qualified immu-
nity. 
I am a conservative. I don’t like 
courts creating law. I don’t like that 
the court created qualified immunity 
and that is not as perfect as we could 
make it. But I believe there should be 
some level of immunity, so let’s have 
that conversation. Let’s debate it. 
Let’s discuss it. 
Or I can just sit here and speak to an 
empty Chamber and have a speech that 
is on C–SPAN and then tweet it out, 
and then there will be some speeches 
and people will go out and then there 
will be an election in November. 
Let’s be honest. We know that is 
what all this is about: posturing for a 
November election. 
Well, you know what? I could be out 
doing one of these dinners. We could be 
doing something. We are all in races. 
Or we could be right here doing our 
darn job, because that is what we 
should be doing. We should actually be 
having a debate in this Chamber. We 
never do that. 
We haven’t had a vote on an open 
amendment on the floor of the House 
since May of 2016. That is both parties 
in control of this Chamber, by the way. 
That is absurd. It is facially absurd. 
We are a nation governed by a Rules 
Committee that throws bills on the 
floor and then says: Hey, you are going 
to vote on this with a gun to your 
head, and we are going to put whatever 
we can in there to make it a tough vote 
so that we can then run ads against 
you and then have a campaign in No-
vember. 
That is no way for a representative 
government to work. 
We make policy based on Twitter. We 
don’t have legitimate hearings where 
we go through all of the information 
and make tough additions, roll our 
sleeves up. That is the way this body is 
supposed to work. It hasn’t worked 
that way in a long time—either party 
in control, by the way. 
One day we might aspire for this 
body’s approval rating to jump above 
20 percent. Wouldn’t that be some-
thing? But why would you approve of 
this body? What do we ever do? 
Rhetorical question. 
I would actually like to ask the ques-
tion: What do we actually do? 
We sure as heck don’t pass appropria-
tions bills that have any chance of 
being reasonable or financially pru-
dent. $27 trillion of debt later, we are 
barreling toward $30 trillion. Every-
body knows it. Our dollar is going to be 
devalued. Our economy is going to be 
weaker. Our kids are inheriting $30 
trillion-plus of debt. 
What are we doing? 
The Speaker, leader in the Senate, 
Treasury Secretary, they are all meet-
ing in rooms—I don’t ever see any of 
this stuff till I read about it in the 
press—figuring out which number they 
are going to put in front of trillion for 
some deal. 
Why don’t we start with a bill on the 
floor of this Chamber? For example, 
why don’t we just start with a PPP ex-
tension bill? Why not? 
We managed to pass a bill in June, 
DEAN
PHILLIPS, freshman Democrat 
from Minnesota, and myself, seven 
pages, because we ignored the normal 
process. And we went out and we got a 
bunch of support for it and we, basi-
cally, forced the issue. We got a vote 
and it extended the PPP, granting true 
reprieve and help to small businesses in 
Texas and throughout this country. 
The PPP is at 5.2 million loans and 
$525 billion since the spring. In Texas, 
over 400,000 loans of $41 billion. Eighty- 
six percent of the total count were less 
than $150,000. The average loan is 
$101,000. 
We have $130 billion left. Why don’t 
we extend it? Why don’t we add to it? 
Why don’t we make this work for small 
businesses that, I am told, in Texas are 
going to run out of money in Sep-
tember, run out of money in October: 
live music venues closing, small res-
taurants closing, family-owned estab-
lishments that have been there for dec-
ades closing. 
Now we are playing Russian roulette 
with other people’s lives. You have got 
local politicians and Governors who 
have shut down people’s livelihoods: 
wineries, breweries, distilleries, live 
music venues, restaurants unable to 
stay in business in significant part be-
cause of government action, in part be-
cause of the virus and people’s con-
cerns. 
Why aren’t we doing something right 
now? 
What is more important at 7 tonight 
than us, this body, meeting and coming 
up with solutions? A dinner? A fund-
raiser? An interview on MSNBC, CNN, 
or FOX? Some meeting with some 
higher-ups and the Speaker and the 
leader and some folks in the adminis-
tration telling us what to do when we 
are every bit as duly elected as they 
are? But that is what is happening, be-
cause there sure as heck isn’t anybody 
on the floor of the House Chamber here 
at 7. 
Over the last 180 days, since mid- 
March when we all left, around spring 
break time for a lot of our kids, over 
this 6 months, 180 days, we have met 
and voted, I think, 19 of those days. 
Today might be the 20th. That is ab-
surd. And none of those votes, by the 
way, were us actually sitting down 
here and debating. 
My friend agrees. He knows. 
Have we been down here debating? 
Have there been any grand debates 
here on the floor of the people’s House? 
There have not. 
I can’t tell you how many Members 
on the other side of the aisle and this 
side of the aisle I talk to about want-
ing to restore regular order. It is the 
fundamental problem we have among 
our so-called leaders in this town is we 
don’t do that. 
Right now, we have H.R. 7894 that I 
did with my friends Congressman CUR-
TIS, Congressmen WILD, MEUSER, VAN 
DREW, a number of folks, bipartisan, 
that would extend the PPP. 
You know what? I don’t care. Don’t 
use that bill. There is the RESTART 
Act. There are others. But why don’t 
we just pull up a bill, debate it, and 
vote on it? It is a novel idea. 
Or no, why don’t we just wait for the 
powers that be to put together a $3 tril-
lion bill that has virtually no chance of 
getting any kind of unified support be-
cause it has got 50 different moving 
parts and then wonder why the Amer-
ican people look at us and say: What is 
wrong with you? 
Just put a bill on the floor and let’s 
debate it and vote on it. What are we 
afraid of? I am happy to vote, and my 
constituents can choose what to do in 
November. But let’s debate and vote. 
That bill I just mentioned, it has 35 
significant organizations and entities 
that support it: National Restaurant 
Association, a bunch of the business 
community that supports it. 
Fine. Again, I don’t care, that bill, 
another bill. Let’s just have a bill and

September 15, 2020 
a vote on a bill that will help our small 
business community. 
But again, where is the Speaker? 
Why are we playing politics with small 
businesses? I don’t get it. 
Where is the Speaker? Where is this 
body on 43, 43 dead law enforcement of-
ficers, up a significant amount, almost 
50 percent since last year? 
I would say, as I said before, that bill 
that we got passed in June on a bipar-
tisan basis, the PPP bill we passed in 
the spring, this is just my district 
alone, the district I represent, Texas 
21: businesses supported, 18,400; non-
profits supported, 511; total jobs sup-
ported, 90,900; funding distributed, over 
$600 million. That is one congressional 
district. 
Let’s do our job. Let’s pass an exten-
sion of that. 
Mr. Speaker, how much time do I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 7 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to use the time that I have remaining 
not lamenting some of my frustrations 
about the floor of the House but talk-
ing about why it matters. I would like 
to talk about this magnificent young 
lady, Rebekah Wendt. 
I rise here tonight to remember Re-
bekah, who loved her country, a mar-
tyr who lost her life striving to do 
what we all came here to do: to make 
America better. 
Rebekah is the granddaughter of 
Chuck and Judy Wendt, daughter of 
Tim and Erika Wendt, and sister of two 
of my staffers, one current and one 
former, Jonah and Manfred Haden 
Wendt. 
On July 10, a little bit before mid-
night, I received a phone call from my 
aide, Jonah. He informed me that his 
sister, Rebekah, had just passed away 
in a car accident while working on a 
campaign in west Texas for a candidate 
she believed in to make a little extra 
money to buy textbooks for school. 
Rebekah Susanna Wendt was born on 
May 12, 2000, to Tim and Erika Wendt. 
She was baptized on August 13 of 2000 
and confirmed on May 17 of 2015 at St. 
Paul Lutheran in Fort Worth, Texas. 
She was a rising sophomore at Trinity 
University, which I am proud to rep-
resent. 
On July 10, 2020, she was embraced at 
the pearly gates of heaven by our Lord 
and Savior Jesus Christ. She was greet-
ed by those who had gone before her: 
Oma, Opa, Anita, Willard, and Jeff. 
Rebekah’s story is nothing of inspira-
tional. 
As a child, Rebekah struggled with 
language. Speaking, reading, and writ-
ing—putting her thoughts into written 
language—were difficult for Rebekah. 
Many thought she would never be able 
to read, but she overcame and flour-
ished. 
As a child, she was able to do what 
most adults today cannot even do: ask 
for help. 
Rebekah had a wonderful gift for the 
fine arts. She danced and sang choir 
with poise and self-confidence. Re-
bekah learned to work through her dif-
ficulties and blossomed into an aspir-
ing architect and historian. She would 
eventually follow her big brothers to 
Trinity University. 
Rebekah was a student of history and 
a lover of architecture. She loved to 
read about World War II, particularly 
the Battle of the Bulge. 
I thank my friend, a veteran, for 
coming in and holding this for me just 
as I am talking about the sacrifices of 
our wonderful World War II generation. 
As a self-described architecture geek, 
she worked hand in hand with her fa-
ther to design their new home. 
Having just finished her freshman 
year at Trinity University, Rebekah 
was just beginning to come into her 
own. 
Her classmates at Trinity University 
remember her as a devoted Christian 
who lived out her faith every day: 
warm and enthusiastic, charmingly 
silly and unsure of herself, but brave 
and willing to ask for help. They will 
also remember her as a keenly aware 
friend. 
Her family will forever remember her 
as the introvert who just needed a 
stage to perform on; the sister who was 
already planning out who would host 
Christmas, Easter, and Thanksgiving; 
an apologetic history buff who would 
blurt out a fact only to excuse herself 
for being a self-described nerd; an old 
soul who found comfort in ‘‘MASH,’’ 
‘‘Golden Girls,’’ and anything vintage; 
a fighter who overcame the odds and 
never gave up on her dreams, with a 
smile that lit up rooms and a roaring 
laugh that the whole neighborhood 
knew. 
Her mother, Erika, will fondly recall 
her daughter as her best friend, kitch-
en partner, an ally in all things gluten- 
free, and caretaker of her two brothers. 
They need some caretaking. 
Her father, Tim, will never forget de-
signing the family’s new house with his 
beloved daughter. While Rebekah may 
have gone to Heaven, the family house 
will remain here on Earth as a testa-
ment to her love and devotion for her 
family. 
Following Rebekah’s service, a friend 
of the Wendt family noted that the fu-
neral had reminded her of Matthew 
25:21: ‘‘Well done, my good and faithful 
servant.’’ 
Well done, Rebekah. You have run 
the race. You have kept the faith. 
Rebekah’s story has touched the 
lives of many people who she didn’t 
even know. 
She 
passed 
away 
doing 
what 
I 
pledged to do when running for Con-
gress: preserve the promise of America 
for our children and our grandchildren. 
She didn’t have to be out on a cam-
paign knocking on doors during a virus 
and all the chaos of 2020, but she did. In 
fact, Rebekah was not particularly po-
litical, but she loved her country, and 
she was proud of our history and all 
who had come before her in the name 
of life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness. 
b 1915 
She loved America; she loved her 
God; she loved Jesus Christ; and she 
loved her German Lutheran heritage. 
She will be remembered as a very good 
German who loved her God, her family, 
and her country. 
She served as an inspiration to me 
and someone that I have honored, am 
honoring now, and will continue to 
honor as I serve not just in the United 
States Congress but the rest of my life. 
Thank you, Rebekah. While your 
time on Earth has come to an end 
sooner than we all would have liked, 
your legacy will remain long after. You 
are an inspiration for many and will 
not soon be forgotten. 
I thank my friend for his assistance. 
I thank Rebekah for her service. I 
thank her family for their love and 
support that they are offering to each 
other and everybody in the commu-
nity. 
I will just say this in closing. We all 
have these stories. We all have people 
we lose. I went through a battle with 
cancer. We are here to make this coun-
try better. We are here to represent the 
people of the United States. I would 
just ask that we come together and 
let’s solve those problems. Let’s roll up 
our sleeves and do our job. That is 
what we were elected to do. And let’s 
stand up for America together. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, we are grateful that 
You continue to rule the universe. We 
acknowledge that though wrong seems 
so strong, Your purposes will be ful-
filled. 
Lord, we praise You for Your promise 
that, in everything, You continue to 
work for the good of those who love 
You. 
Mighty God, let Your will be done. 
Bless our lawmakers, listen to their 
prayers, and guide them with Your 
truth. Quench their thirst for Your 
presence with Your abiding love. May 
they not forget the many times You 
have helped them in the past. We pray 
in Your gracious Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
THE MIDDLE EAST 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
the signing of the Abraham Accords 
today at the White House represents a 
very historic breakthrough for peace in 
the Middle East. I am not saying that 
this accord alone will bring peace to 
that troubled region, but this is the 
first tangible progress toward peace in 
that area in a quarter century. 
I met Anwar Sadat at the time of the 
Camp David Accords in 1978, when he 
was present in the Ways and Means 
Committee room over in the House of 
Representatives, and I had an oppor-
tunity also to witness, at the White 
House, the handshake between Rabin 
and Arafat in 1993. Both events seemed 
to herald a new peace in the Middle 
East that, quite frankly, never mate-
rialized, and yet we still have peace be-
tween Israel and Egypt and between 
Israel and Jordan. 
Israel has been a country for over 72 
years. It is the only democracy in the 
region. It is a major economic, mili-
tary, and political power, and, of 
course, it is our greatest ally in the 
Middle East. It is overdue for other 
states, then, and those states that are 
in that area especially to recognize 
Israel and pursue normal relations. 
The outdated notion that recognition 
of Israel’s existence should be withheld 
until somehow Israelis and Palestin-
ians agree on the details of a two-state 
solution has not worked. The two-state 
solution hasn’t made an agreement 
more likely, but it has prevented diplo-
matic interactions that could be a sta-
bilizing force in an unstable region. 
In a polarized time, today’s historic 
accord between Israel and the UAE and 
Israel and Bahrain is good news that 
anyone can celebrate. We ought to give 
President Trump great credit for his 
leadership in this area. He has deliv-
ered in a lot of areas where both Re-
publican and Democratic Presidents 
could not deliver in the past. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
THE MIDDLE EAST 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday, I discussed a tide of good 
news flowing out of the Middle East. 
Peace agreements between Israel and 
the UAE and Israel and Bahrain will be 
documented at the White House later 
today. Even more Arab countries are 
reportedly considering following suit. 
The winds of change are blowing across 
the Middle East. Thanks, in large part, 
to the hard work of the Trump admin-
istration, they are blowing toward 
peace. 
I also mentioned yesterday that not 
everyone is happy. Not everyone in the 
Middle East is living in the 21st cen-
tury. Some are too vested in the old 
fights and enmities and are afraid to 
let them go. President Abbas, who is 
now in the 16th year of a 4-year term at 
the head of the Palestinian Authority, 
predictably, tried to dismiss the com-
promise as nonsense. But, as the 
Obama administration’s Middle East 
expert Dennis Ross wrote a few days 
ago, continuing this failed approach 
would just guarantee Palestinians will 
be left behind while the rest of the 
Arab world builds a better future. 
And then there is the theocratic bas-
ket case that is Iran. Last weekend, as 
if perfectly scripted to contrast with 
the hopeful news of optimism and 
peace coming from the Arab world, the 
mullahs reminded the whole world of 
their flagrant disdain for human dig-
nity and basic human rights. They car-
ried out a hurried execution in the face 
of international condemnation. 
Navid Afkari, a 27-year-old Iranian 
wrestler arrested during a government 
protest in 2018, was tortured into 
confessing to the murder of a security 
guard. He was hanged on Saturday. Ac-
cording to his mother, who was barred 
from visiting her son before his execu-
tion, Navid and his two brothers ar-
rested alongside him were forced to 
testify against one another. As they 
mourn their brother, these two young 
men themselves face decades in prison

S5578 
September 15, 2020 
for standing up to the brutal injustices 
of the Iranian regime. 
Stories like this are tragic, but they 
aren’t shocking—not in a country 
where dissent and free expression are 
denied and not from rulers who regu-
larly use both domestic and inter-
national terrorism. This regime has its 
fingerprints 
on 
destabilizing 
cam-
paigns, assassinations, and violence 
against civilians in every single corner 
of the Middle East—from the shores of 
the Mediterranean to the Gulf of Aden. 
The Obama-Biden administration’s 
Iran deal, the JCPOA, did not improve 
any of this bad behavior. It ignored 
Iran’s nonnuclear aggression. It let 
Tehran continue R&D on enriched ura-
nium. If anything, Iran’s behavior has 
only gotten worse, and that bad deal is 
still doing damage. 
This year, it will sunset a prudent 
U.N. Security Council resolution that 
had kept Iran from buying conven-
tional weapons. This summer, the U.N. 
Security Council, with the votes of 
Russia and China, refused to extend 
this 13-year-old embargo. 
Returning to the JCPOA has become 
a sort of mantra for our political left 
here in the United States. But really, 
the reflex to oppose everything Presi-
dent Trump does can be a gift to our 
adversaries. Former Vice President 
Biden promises to rush back into a bad 
deal without securing any improve-
ments. He proposes we would be able to 
renegotiate the bad deal from the in-
side of it after tossing away any lever-
age in advance. 
There is one right way to deal with 
regimes like Iran—toughness and re-
solve. That is why President Trump 
successfully 
restored 
an 
important 
measure of deterrence when he re-
moved Iran’s top terrorist, Soleimani, 
from the battlefield forever. 
Even though Tehran is weakened by 
sanctions, political unrest, and eco-
nomic 
unease, 
they 
are 
also 
emboldened by our internal divisions 
and eager to exploit rifts among our al-
lies. We know from publicly released 
intelligence that Iran seeks to inter-
fere in our own politics. We know that 
Iranian-backed 
groups 
continue 
to 
threaten our forces in Iraq and Syria. 
We know that Iranian proxies like 
Hezbollah pose a growing threat to our 
ally Israel. 
Unity, strength and resolve are the 
way to defend our security and our in-
terests—not capitulation. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Madam President, now, one final 
matter. For months now, it has been 
clear to basically every reasonable 
American that our country can and 
must hold two sets of true statements 
in our minds at the same time. 
No. 1, our country has unfinished 
work to ensure that policing is fair to 
everyone and that Black Americans do 
not feel unfairly treated or targeted by 
law enforcement. And, No. 2, the vast 
majority of law enforcement officers 
are heroes, and the toxicity, anger, and 
actual violence that far-left mobs have 
inflicted on police men and women 
across our country is simply beyond 
the pale. 
The American people want racial jus-
tice, and we want good, strong policing 
to ensure equal protection of the laws. 
We understand there is no contradic-
tion here—none whatsoever. Most peo-
ple are outraged by the killings of 
Black Americans that have shocked 
our country. 
Sunday marked 6 months since the 
death of Breonna Taylor in my home-
town of Louisville, KY. Our people 
want answers. Our Nation wants an-
swers. Most Americans also feel sick 
when they hear about events like what 
happened last weekend in Los Angeles. 
Two sheriff’s deputies were ambushed 
and shot while they sat in their patrol 
car in Compton. And then far-left pro-
testers tried to literally block—block— 
an entrance to the hospital chanting 
things like ‘‘kill the police’’ and ‘‘I 
hope they [effing] die.’’ 
Fortunately, both deputies are out of 
surgery, but the hateful climate that 
creates these acts is still with us. One 
of our two political parties should do 
more to repudiate the underlying cli-
mate on their side. 
To be clear, Democratic leaders, in-
cluding Vice President Biden and our 
colleague like the junior Senator from 
California, spoke up quickly to con-
demn the actual shootings of these offi-
cers themselves. That was absolutely 
the right thing to do—no question. But 
what about the underlying climate? 
For months, the political left in this 
country has put all its might behind a 
false narrative that says disorder is ac-
ceptable, riots are free speech, and law 
enforcement is the real enemy of cer-
tain communities. 
One prominent national newspaper, 
which found a straightforward op-ed 
from our colleague, Senator COTTON, to 
be more than they could bear, had no 
problem publishing a submission enti-
tled, ‘‘Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish 
the Police.’’ No problem publishing 
that—‘‘Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish 
the Police.’’ 
When the Speaker of the House was 
asked to respond to rioters illegally 
toppling statues across the country, 
she blithely responded: ‘‘People will do 
what they will do.’’ That was about the 
topic of statues. From one liberal big 
city to another, we have seen mayors 
and local leaders who apparently find 
it easier to propose cutting police fund-
ing and criticize their men and women 
in uniform than to denounce out-of- 
control riots in their very own cities. 
Just yesterday, with this Los Angeles 
story making headlines nationwide, 
the junior Senator from Massachusetts 
decided to criticize police officers on 
his Twitter feed and proposed a nation-
wide ban on nonlethal measures like 
tear gas and rubber bullets—a nation-
wide ban on nonlethal measures like 
tear gas and rubber bullets. 
We are now at a point where some of 
our Democratic colleagues survey the 
Nation, survey the way law enforce-
ment officers are being treated, and de-
cide the answer is to keep rhetorically 
throwing cops under the bus—throwing 
them under the bus—and try to ban 
their nonlethal means of self-defense 
while they are at it. 
The American people don’t have any 
trouble rejecting terrible racism and 
discrimination and rejecting lawless-
ness, violence, and anti-police preju-
dice with equal clarity and equal force. 
They deserve leaders who can do like-
wise.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
after the Senate Republicans spent 4 
months dithering and delaying, last 
week, Leader MCCONNELL pushed a par-
tisan, emaciated COVID bill. It was so 
paltry and ladened with poison pills 
that it was clearly designed to fail. 
And fail it did. 
It is time for the Senate Republicans 
to wake up to the gravity of the crisis 
in our country and work with Demo-
crats on a comprehensive bill that de-
livers real help to Americans.

request. Leader MCCONNELL and Senate 
Republicans must drop the cynical and 
political games and instead work with 
Democrats to find common ground and 
reach a compromise. 
If Republican leadership lets the 20 
Members of their caucus who barely 
want to provide any more relief and al-
lows them to dictate their party’s 
agenda, it will block the path to a com-
promise, and Republicans will have to 
answer to the American people. 
Our country still does not have a 
strong grasp on COVID–19. America 
continues to lead the world in the num-
ber of confirmed cases by far—over 6.5 
million. Nearly 200,000 Americans have 
died. Yet, unthinkably, it was reported 
that in one of his interviews with Bob 
Woodward, President Trump said that 
‘‘nothing more could have been done’’ 
to combat the coronavirus. ‘‘Nothing 
more could have been done’’—that is 
what President Trump said. Of the 
many lies the President has told about 
COVID–19, this is one of the most mon-
umental and one of the most galling. 
There were so many vital things the 
President could have done to fight 
COVID–19 and protect our country. In 
the early days of the virus, hospitals, 
medical centers, and essential workers 
were short on PPE, ventilators, swabs, 
masks, and gloves. President Trump 
never mobilized the resources of the 
Federal Government, never fully in-
voked the Defense Production Act, and 
never set up a national clearing house 
to get resources where they needed to 
go. 
It has been 7 months and President 
Trump still doesn’t have a national 
testing strategy. There has never been 
a national plan for contact tracing. 
The President took months before he 
even encouraged Americans to wear a 
mask. This is an entire universe of ac-
tions that President Trump could have 
taken to help slow the spread of the 
virus and save American lives and 
American jobs, but he didn’t. He never 
took strong action, never took respon-
sibility. It is what it is. 
In many cases, it would have been 
better, actually, if the President did 
nothing instead of what he did. It 
would have been better if the President 
never downplayed the virus, never 
called it a hoax, never pushed quack 
medicines, never speculated about in-
jecting bleach, and never held rallies. 
Every week—every week—brings new 
evidence that his administration is to-
tally unequipped to right the ship, es-
pecially the Department of Health and 
Human Services. Over the weekend, 
there were numerous reports that po-
litical appointees at HHS have been 
interfering 
with 
CDC’s 
report 
on 
COVID–19, trying to delay, edit out, or 
halt the release of facts that would 
have been politically embarrassing to 
the President. This is not the first time 
the administration has tried to hide re-
ports and facts that would better in-
form the American people. 
Meanwhile, as that is happening, 
President Trump has pressured HHS to 
‘‘slow the testing down.’’ He has over-
stated the benefits of certain treat-
ments and pressured the FDA to ap-
prove them and accused FDA officials 
of holding back a vaccine, and too 
many people within HHS are trying to 
suppress the science. 
The Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, Alex Azar, has not only failed 
to push back against these outrageous 
moves by President Trump, but he has 
been almost entirely silent about the 
chaos and mismanagement in his own 
agency. 
In Trump’s administration, the most 
important skill is the ability to stand 
up to the President and resist political 
influence—more so in an agency like 
HHS than others, where the health of 
Americans is at stake. 
It has become abundantly clear that 
the leadership of the Department of 
Health and Human Services has al-
lowed perhaps the most important Fed-
eral agency right now to become sub-
servient 
to 
the 
President’s 
daily 
whims. 
So, today, I am calling on Secretary 
Azar to resign immediately. We need a 
Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices who will look out for the American 
people, not President Trump’s political 
interests. 
WILDFIRES 
Madam President, now on another 
topic, wildfires: For the last several 
weeks, much of the American West has 
been ravaged by a historic wave of 
wildfires. At least 35 people have been 
killed. Thousands of homes have been 
destroyed. Over 5 million acres of land 
have been incinerated, roughly the size 
of Rhode Island and Connecticut com-
bined. The sky glows with ghastly 
shades of red and orange. 
It is impossible to have a serious con-
versation about these wildfires without 
talking about climate change. We 
know that climate change contributes 
to the frequency of these fires. We 
know it accelerates their destructive 
power. Six of the 20 largest fires in 
California history have happened this 
year alone. Heat waves and dry air 
make these disasters more likely. 
These past few years have been some 
of the hottest and driest on record, but 
at a press conference yesterday with 
FEMA and California State officials, 
President Trump brushed aside any 
possibility that climate change had an 
effect, suggesting idiotically that the 
planet will ‘‘start getting cooler; you 
just watch.’’ 
This is just like what he did with 
COVID. He tries to deny it, and he 
makes it worse. He encourages people 
to ignore it, and the problem grows. 
When the head of the California Nat-
ural Resources Agency told the Presi-
dent that science disagreed with him, 
the President said: ‘‘I don’t think 
science knows.’’ This exchange where 
the President said ‘‘It’ll start getting 
cooler; you just watch,’’ when he was 
upbraided by a scientific expert and 
says ‘‘I don’t think science knows’’ 
captures everything you need to know 
about President Trump’s grasp of basic 
scientific 
facts—and 
especially 
the 
science of climate change. 
Without a shred of evidence or 
knowledge, President Trump said that 
our planet will just ‘‘start getting cool-
er.’’ It is just like his attitude toward 
this pandemic, which he promised 
would magically disappear. 
You would think the situation would 
be better here in Congress, but, regret-
tably, the Republican Senate doesn’t 
seem to take the threat of climate 
change seriously either. The Repub-
lican majority has had 6 years in 
charge of the Senate to show that they 
want to make progress on climate 
change but have done next to nothing— 
next to nothing—to curb emissions or 
protect our environment from the dam-
aging effects of a warming planet. 
The only time Republicans even 
brought up climate change legislation 
was when Leader MCCONNELL scheduled 
a sham vote on a climate bill so his 
own Members could vote against it. 
That is right. The only climate bill 
Leader MCCONNELL has brought to the 
floor is a bill he wanted his Members to 
vote against. 
Democrats, on the other hand, be-
lieve protecting our planet is a moral 
obligation. Senate Democrats created 
the first-ever Senate special committee 
to study the climate crisis. We have 
committed to creating clean energy 
jobs and building resiliency in any in-
frastructure bill. 
I have introduced legislation called 
Clean Cars for America that would 
make all vehicles on the road carbon- 
neutral by 2040, and we have com-
mitted to creating at least 10 million 
new clean energy jobs and dedicating 40 
percent of climate funding to environ-
mental justice and the disadvantaged 
and communities of color. 
Just last week, I joined with Senator 
MARKEY and many grassroots organiza-
tions to introduce the THRIVE resolu-
tion, calling for millions of new jobs in 
renewable energy and making new in-
vestments in Black, Hispanic, and in-
digenous communities so that clean 
air, clean water, and clean energy are 
not privileges for the wealthy few but 
abundant for all. 
This is about protecting our planet 
so that our kids and grandkids can live 
in a world with clean air, clean water, 
and the same kinds of opportunities we 
grew up with. 
Republicans have had 6 years in the 
Senate to show they are serious about 
the defining crisis of our time, some-
thing that, over the years, will be even 
worse than COVID—much worse—and 
they have failed to take any action, 
just like they did on COVID: no action. 
Democrats would not make the same 
mistake again. We will not delay on 
climate the way Republicans have de-
layed on COVID and not done what is 
needed. 
I yield the floor.

FILIBUSTER 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, last 
week, Leader MCCONNELL called up a 
bill to the floor of the U.S. Senate. It 
was a coronavirus relief bill, which in-
cluded a number of components that 
both sides had agreed needed to be in 
any coronavirus relief bill. It was a tar-
geted bill. It was a fiscally responsible 
bill, and it was a bill that was rooted in 
reality. In other words, there was a be-
lief that it could be signed into law if, 
in fact, it was passed by the Congress. 
So, when it was called up, obviously, 
we talked about the features in the 
bill, many of which are things, as I 
said, enjoyed bipartisan support. When 
I said it was fiscally responsible, it ac-
tually repurposed funds from the pre-
vious coronavirus relief bill, from the 
CARES Act, that had not yet been 
spent. So it took some of those dollars, 
repurposed them, used them in another 
way, which I think would be a fiscally 
responsible way in which to approach 
the whole issue of how we spend tax-
payer dollars on any issue, including a 
crisis. So there was a repurposing that 
I think, again, represents a fiscally re-
sponsible approach to doing this. 
It also addressed the issue of people 
who were unemployed. It had a provi-
sion in there that allowed people to 
continue to receive unemployment in-
surance above and beyond what their 
States offered in terms of the bene-
fits—$300 above that on a per-week 
basis, which, on average, represents 
about an 85-percent wage replacement. 
So it was about an 85-percent wage re-
placement in terms of an unemploy-
ment benefit. It also included bipar-
tisan 
improvements 
and 
bipartisan 
amendments and modifications to the 
PPP program, things which both sides 
had agreed upon. That program has 
been very successful but needed to be 
expanded and reauthorized, so it in-
cluded those changes—again, bipar-
tisan changes. 
It included significant funding for 
both elementary and secondary edu-
cation—about $70 billion there to help 
our schools open safely and another $30 
billion to $35 billion for colleges and 
universities for the same purpose: to 
help them be able to open safely— 
again, a bipartisan priority. 
Those are just a few of the things 
that were included. It also included, of 
course, additional funding for vaccines, 
therapies, testing, all things that we 
think are vitally important if we are 
going to defeat the virus. 
Those were all components that were 
included in the bill last week that was 
brought up to the floor by the majority

September 15, 2020 
leader, Senator MCCONNELL, and it was 
blocked. It was filibustered by the 
Democrats. Now, when I say blocked, I 
am not talking about blocking the end 
bill. I am talking about blocking even 
getting on the bill. It was a motion to 
proceed under the Senate rules, some-
thing that is necessary to get on a bill. 
It is important, I think, to point out 
that there are several ways in which a 
bill can be stopped, and they require a 
supermajority—60 votes in the Senate. 
Once you are on a bill and it is subject 
to an amendment process, you can, at 
the end of that, if you don’t like the 
bill, you can still block it with 41 
votes. In other words, it takes 60 votes 
to get on a bill, to proceed to a bill, 
and 60 votes to get off the bill, to re-
port it out. So there are several places 
where if you are opposed to something 
and you think that you haven’t been 
treated fairly, you can block it. 
But blocking the motion to proceed 
means you are blocking a bill—even 
just the idea of getting on the bill and 
opening it up to an amendment process 
and debating it on the floor of the Sen-
ate. That is not, obviously, the first 
time that has happened. It happened in 
the police reform bill. It happened ear-
lier this year in the original CARES 
package. 
But on the police reform bill, you 
had, again, a bill that had many bipar-
tisan provisions in it. In fact, about 75 
to 80 percent of the bill were things 
that both sides agreed upon, and, there 
again, the motion to proceed just to 
get on the bill was blocked. It was by 
the use of the filibuster. It was by the 
use of the 60-vote threshold in the Sen-
ate to prevent the Senate from even 
proceeding to the bill—even after, I 
would add, the manager of that bill and 
the author of that bill, Senator TIM 
SCOTT from South Carolina, had indi-
cated through the leadership that they 
would be willing to accept up to 10 
amendments or up to 20 amendments. 
They were offered unanimous consent 
to get 10 or 20 amendments offered in 
the police reform bill, but it was still 
blocked even on the motion to proceed 
by the Democrats in the Senate. 
So, when they blocked the bill last 
week, it was pointed out, I think, accu-
rately by the media reporting on the 
bill. These were a few of the headlines 
to give you a sense of the reaction. 
The Hill: ‘‘Senate Democrats block 
GOP relief bill.’’ The Washington Post 
said: ‘‘Democrats block slimmed-down 
GOP coronavirus relief bill. . . .’’ ABC 
News said: ‘‘Democrats block Senate 
GOP COVID 19 relief proposal.’’ Na-
tional 
Public 
Radio 
said: 
‘‘Senate 
Democrats Block GOP’s $300 Billion 
Pandemic Relief Bill.’’ 
So those were some of the headlines. 
Maybe this doesn’t mean anything to 
anybody but Congress watchers, but I 
am sure the irony is not lost on any-
body who follows this process. The 
Democrats used the legislative fili-
buster. When I say blocking a motion 
to proceed, it was the use of a legisla-
tive filibuster to block a bill last 
week—as I mentioned, several times 
earlier this year—at the same time 
that they are calling for an end to the 
legislative filibuster. 
Imagine that. Think about the irony 
of that. On Friday, NBC News reported: 
‘‘Democratic insiders are assembling a 
coalition behind the scenes to wage an 
all-out war on the Senate filibuster in 
bullish anticipation of sweeping the 
2020 election. . . .’’ 
So the very mechanism that they 
used repeatedly here just in the last 
year—but, frankly, for the last 6 years 
that they have been in the minority— 
to block or, in some cases, even to im-
prove a bill that comes to the floor of 
the U.S. Senate, they are now talking 
about getting rid of that very rule. I 
mean, think about that. The irony of 
that is pretty rich. 
It was a disturbing confirmation that 
the campaign by some Democrats to 
eliminate the Senate’s nearly 200-year- 
old practice for considering legislation 
has become official. It used to be sort 
of whispered around here and talked 
about, but now they are talking openly 
about getting rid of the filibuster. It 
puts into stark contrast the choice the 
voters are going to face in November. 
So what is the legislative filibuster? 
Well, it is the product of the Senate’s 
tradition of unlimited debate. The leg-
islative filibuster is essentially the re-
quirement that 60 Senators agree be-
fore the Senate can end debate and 
vote on a contentious bill. In other 
words, you need 60 percent of the Sen-
ate to agree before you can pass a bill. 
Now, what this means in practice is 
that unlike the House of Representa-
tives, where legislation can easily pass 
with the support of just one party, in 
the Senate, you generally need the sup-
port of at least some Members of the 
other party before you can pass legisla-
tion. Nowadays, the Senate’s filibuster 
rule could be said to be the primary 
thing that distinguishes the Senate 
from the House of Representatives. 
That matters because the Senate is 
supposed to be different from the House 
of Representatives. The Framers of the 
Constitution designed the Senate to be, 
as the minority leader once said—al-
luding to the legendary exchange be-
tween Washington and Jefferson—the 
cooling saucer of democracy. 
Wary of—to quote Federalist 62— 
‘‘the propensity of all single and nu-
merous assemblies, to yield to the im-
pulse of sudden and violent passions,’’ 
the Founders created the Senate as a 
check on the House of Representatives. 
They made the Senate smaller and 
Senators’ terms of office longer with 
the intention of creating a more stable, 
more thoughtful, and more deliberative 
legislative body to check ill-considered 
or intemperate legislation. 
As time has gone on, the legislative 
filibuster is the Senate rule that has 
had perhaps the greatest impact in pre-
serving the Founders’ vision of the 
Senate. Thanks to the filibuster, it is 
often harder to get legislation through 
the Senate than through the House. It 
requires more thought, more debate, 
and greater consensus. 
Those are good things. Historically, 
Senators of both parties have recog-
nized this. They have seen beyond the 
narrow partisan advantage of the mo-
ment and fought for the preservation of 
the filibuster. 
In 2005, when there was talk of abol-
ishing the judicial filibuster, Demo-
cratic Senators, some of whom still 
serve in this body today, fought fierce-
ly to safeguard it. At a rally in March 
of that year, the current Democratic 
leader said: 
They believe if you get 51% of the vote, 
there should be one party rule. We will stand 
in their way! Because an America of checks 
and balances is the America we love. It’s the 
America the Founding Fathers created. It’s 
been the America that has kept us successful 
for 200 years and we’re not going to let them 
change it! . . . We will fight, and we will pre-
serve the Constitution. 
That is from the current Democratic 
leader back in 2005, speaking about pro-
posals to eliminate the filibuster. Well, 
unfortunately, the Democrats changed 
their tune a few years later when they 
thought abolishing the judicial fili-
buster would serve their advantage. 
But even then, Democrats—and later 
Republicans—sought to distinguish be-
tween confirming nominees and the 
importance of preserving debate on leg-
islation. Now they are talking about 
abolishing the fundamental practice of 
the Senate, the legislative filibuster, 
for the same prospect of temporary 
partisan gaming. 
‘‘Nothing’s off the table,’’ the minor-
ity leader said when asked about 
Democrats’ intentions for the legisla-
tive filibuster if they win back the Sen-
ate. It is a far cry from what he said 
just a few years ago. 
Eliminating the legislative filibuster 
would permanently change the nature 
of the Senate. The cooling saucer that 
the Founders envisioned would essen-
tially be gone, and the one-party rule 
the Democratic leader decried back in 
2005 would become a reality. 
Some might ask why one-party rule 
is a problem. After all, sometimes one 
party wins the Senate, the House, and 
the Presidency. Shouldn’t that party 
be able to pass whatever legislation it 
wants? Well, the answer is no. Our 
country is relatively evenly split down 
the middle, with the advantage some-
times moving to the Republicans and 
sometimes to the Democrats, but even 
if one party were a permanent minor-
ity in this country, one-party rule still 
wouldn’t be acceptable. 
Let me go back to the Federalist pa-
pers for just a minute. Federalist 10 
and 51 discuss two issues that the 
Founders were concerned about: minor-
ity rights and the tyranny of the ma-
jority. While we tend to think of ty-
rants as single individuals, the Found-
ers recognized that a majority could be 
tyrannical as well. So the Founders 
created a system of government de-
signed to prevent tyrannical majority 
from 
running 
roughshod 
over 
the 
rights of the minority, and one of those 
checks was the Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5582 
September 15, 2020 
Today, the legislative filibuster may 
be the single most important thing pre-
serving the Senate’s constitutional 
role as a check on majority tyranny. 
By requiring 60 votes, the filibuster en-
sures that any legislation has to take 
into account the views of a broad group 
of Senators. With a 60-vote threshold, 
you are unlikely to get your legislation 
passed unless you bring some Senators 
of the opposite party on board, and 
that means the minority party has a 
real role in shaping legislation in the 
Senate, something the minority party 
in the House lacks. 
Democrats have repeatedly, as I 
pointed out earlier, used the legislative 
filibuster to their advantage during 
this Congress. In March, Democrats 
filibustered our largest coronavirus re-
lief bill, the CARES Act, until Repub-
licans agreed to add some Democratic 
priorities, and Democrats quickly took 
credit for making the bill better. You 
would think that Democrats would 
want to preserve this influence, espe-
cially—especially—now 
that 
Demo-
crats 
have 
experienced 
the 
con-
sequences of their decision to abolish 
the judicial filibuster. 
Of course, when they say they want 
to abolish the legislative filibuster, 
Democrats mean that they want to 
abolish the legislative filibuster if they 
win a majority in November. They 
have a lot of legislation they want to 
pass, and they don’t want to have to 
moderate that legislation to address 
Republicans’ or Americans’ concerns. 
But I would remind my colleagues 
that no one is in power forever. If 
Democrats do win in November and 
abolish the legislative filibuster, they 
may quickly come to regret that deci-
sion once they are in the minority 
again, because no matter how perma-
nent a majority thinks it will be, soon-
er or later every majority party re-
turns to minority status. 
In addition to doing away with the 
bipartisan nature of the Senate, ending 
the legislative filibuster would also 
erode the stability of government. Leg-
islation would become more partisan 
because the majority would not have to 
take into account the opinions of the 
minority party. That would make leg-
islation likely to be reversed as soon as 
the opposite party gains the majority 
in a future Congress. 
Without the legislative filibuster, it 
is not hard to see a future in which na-
tional policy on a host of issues could 
fluctuate wildly every few years. Taxes 
could go up and down on a regular 
basis. Government programs could be 
stopped and started every few years. 
The consequences for individuals, busi-
nesses, and our economy would not just 
be unpleasant but potentially dev-
astating. 
I understand the frustration of my 
Democratic colleagues. I have been in 
the minority of the Senate. I was in 
the minority my first 8 years here. 
I also know what it is like when you 
get into the majority and can’t pass ev-
erything you want because the minor-
ity party will filibuster your bills. I 
have certainly had moments when I 
wished we could just pass legislation 
with a simple majority, especially 
coming from the House of Representa-
tives. 
Democrats have stood in the way of a 
lot of legislation I would like to have 
passed this year, from Senator SCOTT’s 
police reform bill, which I mentioned 
earlier, to additional coronavirus re-
lief, to pro-life legislation. 
It is also important to note that not 
every filibuster has been undertaken 
for noble purposes. Like every tool, it 
can be misused. But I know that no 
matter how frustrating the filibuster 
may be in the moment, preserving it is 
essential to preserving the institution 
of the Senate and the purpose for 
which it was created. It is essential to 
protecting minority rights, and it is an 
essential check on tyrannical majori-
ties that would seek to curtail our free-
doms. 
Legend has it that when Benjamin 
Franklin was leaving the Constitu-
tional Convention, someone asked him 
what form of government the conven-
tion had instituted. ‘‘A republic,’’ 
Franklin said, ‘‘if you can keep it’’—‘‘if 
you can keep it.’’ 
Today, the legislative filibuster is 
the key rule preserving the Senate’s 
constitutional role as a check on par-
tisan passion. I pray that no future 
Senate will destroy the Senate’s essen-
tial role in our system of government 
for temporary partisan gain. 
I yield the floor. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
will the Senator from South Dakota 
yield for a question? 
Mr. THUNE. I will be happy to yield 
to the Senator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
want to just start by saying amen to 
everything the Senator has said. 
I listened to his words carefully, and 
I hear a great deal of caution in his 
words about actions that the Senate 
may take as a body that would be in 
response to perhaps short-term gain or 
immediate political gain—but a gain 
that could be finite. 
Over the course of the years that I 
have been in the Senate, I, too, have 
shared the same frustration about leg-
islation that I cared deeply about that 
I believe had been blocked. Our parlia-
mentarian rules have actually worked 
to delay things unnecessarily or often-
times delayed things to the point 
where they never came to fruition. I 
have seen the frustration. I also see the 
benefit of being more methodical, of 
being that cooling saucer in the proc-
ess of governance and particularly good 
governance. 
But the words that you used are very, 
very cautionary. It is as if you are sug-
gesting that if we change the filibuster 
rules, we will, in effect, have changed 
the institution of the Senate going for-
ward and have changed the institution 
so that it is, perhaps, just a smaller 
body than the House but subject to the 
same rules, where those who have the 
most votes on one side win. 
My question to the Senator from 
South Dakota is, Do you believe that a 
change in the filibuster rules here in 
the U.S. Senate would be permanently 
detrimental to the institution of the 
Senate going forward? 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would 
say, through the Chair, to my col-
league from Alaska that that is abso-
lutely the case. I don’t think there is 
any question but that, if the legislative 
filibuster is done away with in a future 
Senate—and, again, Members on the 
Democratic side are talking openly 
about doing that if they gain the ma-
jority after the election in November— 
it will transform the institution of the 
Senate and, by extension, transform 
our country. 
The institution that was designed to 
protect minority rights and to put a 
check on a majority will no longer be a 
functioning institution in the way the 
Founders intended. In fact, it will es-
sentially become, as the Senator from 
Alaska pointed out, the House of Rep-
resentatives with longer terms. 
I think that would be unfortunate for 
a country that was based upon a sys-
tem of checks and balances and that 
recognized very early on how critical it 
was that minority rights be a part of 
our public debate and discussion and 
that those voices not be muffled or 
that those voices not be completely put 
out of the public debate. 
I would simply say to my colleague 
from Alaska that I think this is a mon-
umental issue in terms of what this in-
stitution has meant to this country 
and what it will continue to mean in 
the future if these rules are changed 
and this constitutional protection, as 
we have pointed out, is done away 
with. It will transform the Senate, and 
it will transform the country in ways 
that would be very detrimental to what 
the Founders intended. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
I would hope that on a matter as sig-
nificant as what we are talking about, 
which is effectively the operational in-
tegrity of this institution, there would 
be good, thorough open discussion and 
debate on this floor and amongst floor 
Members. 
But the concerns we are hearing that 
there are efforts on the outside of this 
body that would push us to change our 
rules and do so in a way that could per-
manently erode and undercut the abil-
ity of the U.S. Senate to operate as in-
tended would be, I believe, a travesty. 
Thank you.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I lis-
tened to this debate very carefully be-
cause I have great respect for both of 
the Senators—the Senator from Alaska 
and the Senator from South Dakota. 
I have seen both of them operate as 
effective legislators on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate. I have seen both of them 
entertain amendments, both friendly 
and not so friendly, on the floor of the

Senate and deal with them in a fair 
fashion. I have seen both of them use 
the U.S. Senate to achieve legislative 
goals, some that I shared and some 
that I didn’t share. 
But I have to ask them, in all candor, 
as I listened to the speech about pre-
serving the Senate as we know it, if 
they are really taking a look around at 
the Senate as we know it. Do you know 
how many amendments were debated 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate in the 
year 2019—in the entire year? Amer-
ica’s greatest deliberative body consid-
ered 22 amendments in that year. Six 
of them were offered by one Senator— 
Senator RAND PAUL, the junior Senator 
from Kentucky. You remember them, 
as I do. He basically said: Here is a gun 
to your head. If you want to go home, 
I get a vote. He got his vote. And as he 
reminded me, he lost every one of those 
amendments. So 6 of the 22 amend-
ments were, frankly, one Senator’s ef-
fort to have a recorded vote, and that 
is all it was. 
Sixteen substantive amendments in a 
year, and you are arguing that we can-
not change the Senate, we cannot 
transform the Senate, we cannot con-
sider changes to the rules of the Sen-
ate. I know better. 
I know that you are a good legis-
lator, and you are as well, Senator. I 
know that you can take a bill through 
a committee, bring it to the floor, de-
fend it on the floor, and go through the 
amendment process. We all know that 
that is how the Senate was designed to 
work. 
What happened? What happened to 
the Senate? Well, if you take a look at 
the number of cloture motions to end a 
filibuster that were filed some 13 years 
ago, they averaged about 68 a year. Do 
you know how many we now have? 
Over 250 a year. 
This is out of control. It is so much 
out of control that when you take a 
look at the ordinary business of the 
U.S. Senate and you take a look at the 
memories you may have of passing a 
budget resolution, we don’t do that 
anymore, do we? You take a look at 
passing appropriation bills. You re-
member sitting on the Appropriations 
Committee and proud to be there, as I 
am too. I loved that committee. It was 
a great committee to serve on. We ac-
tually took agencies and went through 
hearings and drew up budgets and took 
them to Appropriations subcommittees 
and actually considered amendments in 
the committee and then brought them 
to the floor and had amendments on 
the floor. Yes, that happened in your 
political lifetime and in mine. It no 
longer occurs. Do you understand the 
Senate which you are defending is a 
Senate which no longer engages in that 
kind of debate? 
What does it boil down to? There 
were meetings of the Big 4 or the Big 8, 
or whatever number there happens to 
be. They decide all 12 appropriations 
bills, and we sit on the outside of the 
room holding our hands patiently, hop-
ing that something we wanted is in-
cluded. Is that the Senate that you ran 
for? Is that the Senate you do not want 
to change? Tell me seriously. It can’t 
be. 
Those of us on this side of the aisle 
say to younger Members: You would 
have loved the Senate if you just could 
have seen it, but you have only been 
here 6 years. So you missed it. 
There was a time when we did debate 
on the floor. Do you remember when 
Dodd-Frank came to the floor? Senator 
Dodd and Senator SHELBY were man-
aging that bill. This was the most dra-
matic change in Wall Street policy in a 
generation or more. I remember it be-
cause I offered what I believe was the 
25th 
amendment 
on 
the 
floor—25 
amendments on this bill that had al-
ready come out of the Banking Com-
mittee. I offered the 25th amendment 
on debit cards, and they announced 
that it would be a 60-vote margin. All 
the others had been a simple majority 
to that point. I surprised everybody, 
including 
myself, 
and 
passed 
that 
amendment. And then more were of-
fered. 
Do you remember the immigration 
reform bill? Do you recall what hap-
pened there? I can tell you because I 
was on the Gang of 8 that wrote the 
bill. We went through the Judiciary 
Committee, and Senator Jeff Sessions 
of Alabama was determined to derail 
the bill. He said: I have dozens of 
amendments, and I am going to offer 
them all. Well, he stopped at about 20 
because he wasn’t passing most of his 
amendments. Then it came to the 
floor, and we faced the same amend-
ment process, amendment after amend-
ment, and the bill was passed on the 
floor of the Senate. 
That was within my political life-
time and yours as well. It worked. Why 
is it not working now? Why is this such 
an empty Chamber? Why are there all 
of these empty desks when there are so 
many things that need to be done in 
America? Because we have stopped leg-
islating. We have stopped debating. We 
have stopped amending. 
You say: Boy, we have to preserve 
this. We have to do everything we can 
to preserve this. 
We know better than that. This is 
not the Senate that we are witnessing. 
This is some aberration, some use of 
the filibuster. 
In the first 3 years, with Senator 
MCCONNELL in charge, we had more 
filibusters and cloture votes than in 
the entire history of the U.S. Senate. It 
is out of control, my friends, my col-
leagues, fellow Senators. 
It is out of control, my friends, my 
colleagues, my fellow Senators. I don’t 
know what the answer is in terms of 
rule changes, but I will tell you this. 
Mr. THUNE. Would the Senator yield 
for a question? 
Mr. DURBIN. In just one moment. 
I will tell you this: To argue that we 
need to preserve this is to really dis-
courage anyone from becoming a Mem-
ber of this body if we are not going to 
legislate, if we are not going to tackle 
the real issues of our time. 
I look at the Presiding Officer. He 
stepped up on the last immigration de-
bate that we had on a bipartisan meas-
ure. I thank him for doing it. It wasn’t 
easy, politically. That was what the 
Senate once was not that long ago. 
I do yield for a question. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, would the 
Senator from Illinois agree, however— 
because I think it is important to point 
out that this is not something that 
happened in the last few years. The 
Senator from Alaska had a colleague 
elected in 2008 who, when he ran again 
for election in 2014, the argument could 
be made against him that he had never 
gotten a vote on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate on a single amendment in a 6- 
year term in the Senate. 
I came here in 2005. In the first 8 
years that I was here as a Senator, I 
witnessed time and again the very 
thing you are talking about, where 
amendments were shut down, the tree 
was filled, in the parliamentary lan-
guage that we use here in the Senate. 
So I would ask the Senator: Is this 
not a—this is not an issue that has 
cropped up in the last few years. Is this 
not a problem that originated some 
time ago and, as the Senator is sug-
gesting, that we need to do away with 
the supermajority requirement that re-
quires us here as Senators to work to-
gether in a bipartisan way to find com-
mon ground to fix what ails the Sen-
ate? 
I would argue and a lot would argue 
that what ails the Senate right now re-
quires nothing more than behavioral 
change. We have to agree that when 
somebody offers an amendment on one 
side, that it is not going to be blocked 
immediately and we get into this 
lockdown. That is what happened in re-
cent years and in the last couple of ex-
amples we have had, as recently as last 
week, blocking the motion to proceed 
to the bill. 
I mean, if you want to have an 
amendment process, you have to get on 
the bill in the first place. That has 
been, now, the routine that has been 
executed by the minority, is to prevent 
even a motion to proceed, which would 
enable us to get to an amendment proc-
ess. 
So this is not something that hap-
pened when Senator MCCONNELL came; 
this was happening well before that. As 
I pointed out, the Senator from Alas-
ka’s colleague went through an entire 
6-year term without getting a vote—a 
Democratic colleague—when he was in 
the majority here in the Senate. 
Mr. DURBIN. I would say to the Sen-
ator from South Dakota, thank you. I 
said earlier, and I meant it—I think 
you are a good legislator, as are the 
Senator from Alaska and many others, 
and given a chance, you prove it. We 
just don’t get the chance anymore. No 
budget resolution. No appropriations 
bills. One bill, really, of any substance 
comes to the floor of the Senate each 
year now. It is the Defense authoriza-
tion bill, by tradition. Come hell or 
high water, we are going to bring up

that bill. And I am glad we do, but that 
is it. End of story. The rest of the time, 
what do we spend our days doing? 
Watching the clock go by for 30 hours 
so we can have a vote on the next nom-
ination. Is that the Senate you ran for? 
Is that why you went through the sac-
rifice and asked your family to join 
you in that sacrifice to be in public 
life? No. Not for me, it isn’t. I am here 
to do something. I think we can do 
something. We have proven it in the 
past. 
The Affordable Care Act. Books will 
be written—they have already been 
written about what it took to finally 
pass it, but eventually it was enacted 
into law and signed by the President 
and changed the lives of millions of 
Americans. I am glad I voted for it. It 
was not a bipartisan effort at any 
stage. I wish it were. 
The point I am getting to is this: I 
don’t know what the answer is in terms 
of changing the rules, but I am not 
going to stand in defense of the status 
quo. I do not believe the notion that we 
cannot touch the Senate and its tradi-
tions really is defensible in light of 
what we have seen on the Senate floor 
for the last several years—years. 
I just have to tell you, I am surprised 
now that the Republican position ar-
ticulated by your leader and by the 
whip is status quo: Leave it as is. It is 
fine. It is just great. Don’t you change 
the Senate. 
Well, I think the Senate needs to 
change. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I have 
one last question for the Senator from 
Illinois. 
I don’t disagree that, again, we can 
do a better job—both sides—of making 
the Senate a more open place where we 
have an opportunity to debate, which I 
think is the history and tradition of 
the Senate, but I don’t think blowing 
up the Senate rules accomplishes that. 
I just want to read for you from this 
morning—I was on the floor here, but 
in an interview on NPR, the junior 
Senator from Massachusetts was asked 
if there are parts of the Green New 
Deal that might attract bipartisan sup-
port. How did he reply? He replied that 
we need to enact the whole thing, and 
if Republicans disagree, Democrats 
should eliminate the filibuster. 
Now, wanting to preserve the fili-
buster doesn’t mean we can’t reform 
the Senate, but it does mean that we 
shouldn’t allow a majority to steamroll 
a minority. That is what the filibuster 
and the rules of the Senate were de-
signed to protect. 
What your Members are talking 
openly about doing—including your 
leader—is nuking the filibuster, blow-
ing up the Senate, and changing and 
transforming it in a way that will 
transform not only the Senate and the 
way the government, I think, was de-
signed to work by our Founders but 
also transform the country. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
love the junior Senator from Massa-
chusetts to address that question him-
self when he gets his chance on the 
floor. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
will the Senator yield for one last ques-
tion? 
Mr. DURBIN. Happy to yield. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, to 
follow the Senator from South Dako-
ta’s comments about using the tool 
that would effectively blow up the Sen-
ate, if you will—these are not words 
that we use freely, but I think it is fair 
to suggest that utilizing this tool that 
would eliminate the filibuster, that 
would eliminate, really, the strongest 
tool for a minority party, is akin to 
the nuclear option. We use that term 
around here in legislative prose. 
I would agree with much of what you 
have said. You and I have served on the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
now 
for 
years. We have had an opportunity to 
be engaged in good, substantive de-
bates that have yielded good, sub-
stantive, enduring laws. 
As I think about our role around 
here, it is not just to engage in the par-
tisan message of the day; it is actually 
to enact laws. But when we enact laws 
that are good for just one party, that 
are wholly partisan, you can kind of 
predict the direction that will be taken 
when that minority party that voted 
against that particular policy then re-
gains power and takes the majority 
and then attempts to overturn what-
ever that policy may be. 
When we think about ways that we 
can help an economy that is struggling 
right now, one of the things that I am 
hearing from businesses is this: The 
one thing we would really like out of 
Washington, DC, the one thing we 
would really like is some level of cer-
tainty with policies, that it is not kind 
of this whiplash, back and forth from 
one administration to the next. 
Well, the way you do that is through 
a level of consensus. As we know, on 
this floor right now, where it is still 
pretty quiet, consensus has been harder 
and harder to achieve on a bipartisan 
basis. Maybe this is a place in time 
where we are, and it is just dark. As 
our friend John McCain would say: It is 
always darkest before it goes pitch- 
black. Well, maybe we are getting close 
to the pitch-black. One can only hope. 
But I do hear your words that the 
status quo is not acceptable. I agree 
with you, my friend. It is not accept-
able. It is not acceptable that we are in 
that place where we can’t get votes on 
amendments that are legitimate and 
pertinent to the legislation that we 
have. 
I am trying to advance an energy bill 
right now, to get to final passage, and 
we are going through the procedural 
hurdles. I will work through those. But 
we are at a point where, as an institu-
tion, I believe we are failing. We are 
failing the American public. We are 
failing our constituents. We are failing 
in our role in governing. 
I do think that when people look to 
the anxiety that is at play right now 
with our national elections, with a 
Presidential election that is as volatile 
as we have seen, if there is some level 
of comfort and security that they 
might have, they might think that just 
maybe the Congress, maybe the Sen-
ate, can get its act together and be 
working together. 
So I hear you. The status quo is not 
acceptable. I am not one who is going 
to say we can’t change any of the rules, 
but we have to do better. Whether it is 
behavioral 
attitudes 
that 
need 
to 
change or whether we need to work to-
gether to change the rules, that is 
where we should be, not unilaterally 
bomb-throwing, not unilaterally mak-
ing the decision that is going to benefit 
our party today, and then when we lose 
the majority, we will deal with it later. 
We owe it to the Senate and we owe it 
to the country to do better. 
I 
appreciate 
this 
back-and-forth 
today. I would welcome other col-
leagues to join us. I would hope that we 
look very, very closely at where we are 
right now because we are using our own 
rules to do damage to the institution of 
the Senate. 
So let’s not take the last tool that 
holds us in check—this filibuster—and 
throw it away as well because we will 
regret it. In the meantime, let’s figure 
out what we can be doing as Democrats 
and Republicans to do better for the in-
stitution of the Senate and do better 
for the American people. 
I apologize. That wasn’t by way of a 
question; it was occupying the time of 
the Senator from Illinois. But I think 
we have a lot of work to do here, and I 
hope we are able to do it together. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, with her 
permission, I will add a question mark 
to the end of that statement to the 
Senator from Alaska, to thank her and 
warn her that we are coming dan-
gerously close to debating on the floor 
of the Senate. It almost never happens, 
and we are coming close to it. 
We are actually asking one another: 
Do we have to change the rules to fi-
nally make the Senate work, or is 
there another way? I am open to other 
ways. I am open to demonstrations of 
that. But I will tell you, it is a frustra-
tion. It is the determination to make 
certain that, for the people of Illinois 
who returned me to the Senate, we ac-
tually do something, achieve some-
thing; that we go home, win or lose, 
with the feeling that we have been en-
gaged in a process that respected our 
rights as individual Senators and ended 
in a vote up or down and a measure 
passed or failed. That, to me, is why I 
ran for this job, and I think probably 
for yourself as well. We are not there, 
and we are not close to being there. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, to date, we have lost 
nearly 
200,000 
Americans 
to 
the 
coronavirus, and we are quickly ap-
proaching 7 million cases in the United 
States. 
This virus has changed life as we 
know it, and Americans are in need of 
help from Congress. However, despite

September 15, 2020 
the urgent needs of families, busi-
nesses, 
workers, 
and 
unemployed 
Americans across the country, Senate 
Republicans have dragged their feet 
and offered up only a few weak meas-
ures that barely address the needs of 
the Nation. 
The majority leader knows what 
needs to be done. The playbook is right 
in front of us. We did it back in March 
with the CARES Act, which passed 96– 
0. 
To negotiate a real package with real 
solutions for the American people, he 
needs to show up at the negotiating 
table and give up these rogue attempts 
to pass empty, half-hearted measures. 
In the meantime, more data is com-
ing in every day, giving us a clearer 
picture of just how devastating this 
pandemic has been to so many Ameri-
cans. A new report from the Robert 
John Wood Foundation found some 
troubling outcomes that COVID has 
had on Chicago residents. Half of Chi-
cago households reported facing serious 
financial problems during the pan-
demic and troubles caring for children, 
with 35 percent reporting that they 
used up all or most of their savings. 
As we know, the pandemic has dis-
proportionately affected our minority 
communities, with nearly 70 percent of 
Black and 63 percent of Latinx house-
holds in Chicago reported having seri-
ous financial problems. And I am sad to 
say that this study found half of Chi-
cago households report having lost 
their jobs, been furloughed, or seen re-
ductions in wages or work hours since 
the start of the pandemic. 
We all know how important an inter-
net connection is during this pandemic. 
According to the report, 40 percent of 
Chicago households are either strug-
gling with their internet connection or 
lack access to high-speed internet in 
their home needed to complete school-
work or their jobs. 
While these statistics reflect the re-
ality of many in Chicago, there is little 
doubt that this is also the story in so 
many cities and States across the Na-
tion. This is why we need a substantial 
federal response. We need to do what is 
necessary to help struggling families, 
businesses, cities, and States get back 
on their feet. 
Last week, Senate Republicans pro-
posed 
another 
inadequate, 
partisan 
coronavirus response bill that failed to 
prioritize 
the 
needs 
of 
struggling 
Americans. The bill failed to provide 
another round of economic impact pay-
ments for families or hazard pay for es-
sential workers. 
It failed to provide relief to States 
and local governments so they can con-
tinue to pay teachers, EMTs, and fire-
fighters. And it failed to provide any 
housing assistance or nutrition assist-
ance so struggling families can keep a 
roof over their heads and food on the 
table. 
It has been 4 months since the House 
passed the HEROES Act, and week 
after week Senate Republicans refuse 
to make a good faith, bipartisan effort 
to pass a relief measure that meets the 
severity of this crisis. History will 
judge us on how we responded to the 
worst pandemic in a century and the 
deepest recession in 75 years. In re-
sponse to this crisis, did we help pre-
vent millions from slipping into pov-
erty through another round of eco-
nomic impact payments and extending 
enhanced unemployment benefits? Did 
we give schools and teachers the appro-
priate resources so they can help our 
children learn in a safe environment? 
What steps did we take to preserve 
one of our country’s greatest assets: 
the health and safety of our workforce? 
Did we throw caution to the wind by 
prematurely reopening simply because 
it’s an election year? 
Our country needs help, and the pro-
posal that we voted on last week of-
fered little help to struggling Ameri-
cans. 
Our Nation is suffering right now, 
and there is a long road to recovery 
ahead of us. Unfortunately, Leader 
MCCONNELL wasted precious time by 
pitching a half-baked proposal that 
prioritized the needs of corporations 
over the needs of American families. 
Let’s pass a bill that matches the 
gravity of this crisis, and let’s pass it 
now. 
I will close with a brief comment on 
substance. On March 26 we shocked 
America in the Senate. I know it. I 
went home, and they told me so. Do 
you know how we shocked them? By a 
vote of 96 to 0, we passed the CARES 
Act—96 to 0—with not a single dis-
senting vote in the Senate—$3 trillion 
to address our economic problems and 
the coronavirus epidemic we were fac-
ing. We did it on March 26—yes, in this 
calendar year—and we did it knowing 
that the measures we were taking had 
a life expectancy of just a few months 
because we thought that would be the 
end of our challenge. It is not. 
The challenges that we faced in pass-
ing the CARES Act in March still are 
challenges America faces. When it 
comes to COVID–19, the numbers are 
sobering. The infection rate of COVID– 
19 in the United States is double the in-
fection rate of the same virus in Can-
ada—Canada. 
How 
can 
the 
United 
States be in a position where twice as 
many Americans are getting sick as 
those living just on the other side of 
the border? 
When you look at the overall num-
bers, you have to shake your head. We 
have 41⁄2 percent of the world’s popu-
lation living in the United States—41⁄2 
percent—and over 20 percent of the 
COVID–19 deaths in the world—41⁄2 per-
cent and 20 percent. What is going on 
here? 
In this Nation, this great Nation, 
with all of its wealth and all of its re-
sources and all of its talent and all of 
its great hospitals and doctors and 
pharmaceutical companies, we have a 
rate of COVID–19 deaths that is just in-
defensible. 
So I would say to my colleagues: 
When Senator MCCONNELL came to the 
floor and said ‘‘Here is our package; 
take it or leave it,’’ that is not how 
this can possibly end. That is not the 
way the debate ended on March 26. It 
ended when Senator MCCONNELL and 
his 
House 
Republican 
counterpart, 
Congressman 
MCCARTHY, 
met 
with 
Speaker PELOSI, Leader SCHUMER, and 
Treasury Secretary Mnuchin in a room 
and worked it out. That is what it 
takes. 
We need to return to that now and 
get it done before we leave for any rea-
son—election or whatever it may be. 
There is no excuse. There are too many 
unemployed people desperate to get by. 
There are too many businesses des-
perate to survive. There are too many 
tests that we cannot take in America 
because we haven’t invested in the re-
sources. There are too many school dis-
tricts telling me: Senator, reopening 
safely for these kids and teachers is 
going to take some money. Can you 
help? 
There is an election coming up No-
vember 3, where election authorities— 
because people want to vote in the 
safety of their homes—will receive a 
dramatic increase in paper ballots cast, 
and they need a helping hand in proc-
essing them in an orderly, honest way. 
The demands are out there. State and 
local 
governments 
are 
in 
trouble. 
Small towns in Southern Illinois—I 
speak to their mayors, and I hear the 
same things that I hear from the 
mayor of Chicago: We have had a down-
turn in revenues; we are going to have 
to lay off policemen and firefighters 
and healthcare workers if you don’t 
give us a helping hand. 
We cannot walk away from this. Sen-
ator MCCONNELL can’t take the posi-
tion of ‘‘my way or the highway.’’ We 
have to work on a bipartisan basis to 
negotiate an answer to this, and I hope 
we do soon. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to be able to ad-
dress the Senate for 10 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, we are 
fast approaching nearly 200,000 deaths 
from the coronavirus. But the moral 
and physical injury done to our coun-
try during the pandemic will never be 
contained in just one number. As that 
number continues to climb, so too do 
the frustration and the pain and the 
outrage of the American people. 
We know that Donald Trump recog-
nized the threat of the coronavirus and 
deliberately downplayed it for his own 
political gain. He is in large part re-
sponsible for these deaths. 
We now have 31 million workers who 
have either received or applied for un-
employment benefits. Since March 15, 
Massachusetts alone has seen more 
than 2 million claims to our unemploy-
ment programs. In Massachusetts, we 
have the highest unemployment rate in 
the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5586 
September 15, 2020 
Families across the country are fac-
ing devastating choices. Cities and 
towns are struggling to keep programs 
running and employees at work. We 
know the Republicans recognize these 
threats, and they are choosing to ig-
nore them. They are, in part, respon-
sible for the suffering. 
After 4 months of callous calcula-
tions, when they chose to respond, the 
Republicans put out on the floor a 
coronavirus package that was insulting 
to Americans who have been awaiting 
relief. The extent of the misery facing 
our families is unimaginable. Yet Re-
publicans and Leader MCCONNELL re-
sponded by designing a bill so inten-
tionally weak and insufficient that it 
was destined to fail. 
It is all just a game to the Repub-
lican Party, but for Americans, this 
economic and public health crisis is a 
matter of life and death. We need a ro-
bust, comprehensive response right 
now that matches the scale of this cri-
sis, and we have an opportunity to de-
liver some real justice to working 
Americans and their families. 
First, we need to give Americans a 
monthly cash payment of $2,000 so that 
they have the funding to able to pay 
their bills. A single check is not suffi-
cient for households. Families need 
more than just one payment. 
Providing recurring monthly pay-
ments is the most direct and efficient 
mechanism for delivering economic re-
lief to those most vulnerable, for lower 
income families, immigrant families, 
and our gig and service workers. 
I see these families suffering today. 
They are the same kinds of working 
families I grew up with in Malden. I 
know that $2,000 each month would 
mean the world to them—so that they 
can sleep at night; they can pay the 
rent; they can pay the electricity bill; 
they can buy the medications they 
need. 
A monthly payment is the kind of big 
policy that provides relief on the scale 
that is needed. Our government needs 
to tell our families: We are here for 
you. We will not let you down during 
this crisis. 
Second, we need at least $4 billion for 
my E-rate Program to connect every 
student to the internet at home. The 
pandemic has shown a bright light on 
the homework gap being experienced 
by the 16 million students in this coun-
try who do not have internet access at 
home and are unable to complete their 
homework. This is unconscionable and 
a threat to our country’s future. 
We cannot allow this homework gap 
to become a larger learning gap, which 
ultimately is going to become an op-
portunity gap for these young people. 
Research shows that the homework gap 
affects students in both rural and 
urban areas and disproportionately af-
fects lower income students and stu-
dents of color. Trump and the Repub-
licans are blocking this investment in 
education, but we can’t let them. We 
will not leave these students behind. 
Third, we need to extend unemploy-
ment insurance, the weekly $600 ben-
efit, through January of 2021. This is 
not just a line in the budget; it is a 
lifeline for workers who cannot go to 
work through no fault of their own. 
This crisis will be solved only by in-
vesting in workers. We cannot simply 
cut them off when we know harder 
days lie ahead for those workers in our 
country. 
Fourth, we must continue a national 
evictions moratorium and provide $100 
billion in emergency rental assistance. 
No one should have to suffer the indig-
nity of being escorted out of their 
home by the police. A country that al-
lows evictions during a pandemic—be-
cause of a pandemic—has failed its peo-
ple. 
The same goes for electricity and en-
ergy shutoffs. We need a national mor-
atorium that keeps the lights on, en-
sures drinking water, ensures that 
wastewater 
services 
aren’t 
discon-
nected or interrupted during the emer-
gency period due to nonpayment. We 
cannot cast families into the dark as 
they are struggling to stay afloat. 
It is wrong to allow a pandemic that 
has not been created by these families 
to result in catastrophic conditions 
that will look like the Great Depres-
sion in terms of their impact on fami-
lies in the same way that it impacted 
my family during the Great Depres-
sion. We owe these people more. They 
have worked hard. They have worked 
constantly 
throughout 
their 
lives. 
Now, through no fault of their own, the 
pandemic has hit them, and they are 
unemployed. 
Finally, we need $1 trillion in funding 
for State and local governments so 
that our teachers, nurses, postal work-
ers, and other dedicated public serv-
ants are not laid off—the essential 
workers who drive the buses, pick up 
the garbage, fight the deadliest of fires, 
educate our young people. Despite pro-
viding the services we rely upon every 
day—including every single one of us in 
this Chamber—our municipalities are 
aren’t getting any money because Re-
publicans refuse to provide it. State 
and 
local 
governments 
have 
been 
pushed to the brink to support their 
residents and are in desperate need of 
relief. 
To my Republican colleagues I say 
that this funding isn’t blue or red; it is 
green. And all of our mayors and Gov-
ernors and city councilors—whether 
Republican or Democrat—need that 
money right now. 
I have been traveling around my 
home State of Massachusetts talking 
to families. They tell me the same 
thing: They want a livable future for 
their children. That means they need 
the government to do its job effec-
tively in managing this COVID–19 pan-
demic. Instead of making excuses, they 
need a government that works on solu-
tions, even if the problems are unprece-
dented, and they want that govern-
ment to recognize the rights and dig-
nity of everyone. 
Our families want something so basic 
and so simple, they almost shouldn’t 
have to say it: They want their chil-
dren to dream about the future instead 
of fearing about the future. 
They need political leadership from 
us right now—not political games, not 
the political calculation of just 20 
Members of the Senate Republican cau-
cus. 
To my colleagues I say that the grav-
ity of this crisis requires us to respond 
right now. We know we have a Presi-
dent in the White House who is irre-
sponsible. The President knew. It turns 
out he knew the virus was deadly. He 
knew it as well as we knew it, but he 
lied to us. He told us it would magi-
cally disappear. He said it was no worse 
than the flu while on tape we hear him 
say that it is lethal. On February 10, he 
said: You know, a lot of people think it 
goes away in April with the heat, when 
the heat comes in. That is what the 
President said in February about the 
coronavirus. 
He also tells us that climate change 
is a myth. He tells us that our planet is 
not in grave danger. He makes fun of 
the science of climate change the way 
he makes fun of wearing a mask. 
Now the ‘‘Denier in Chief’’ says when 
it gets cooler it will go away, that the 
fires in the west coast will just go 
away. His answer to coronavirus is that 
when it gets warmer, it will go away. 
When he deals with the science of cli-
mate change, he says: When it gets 
cooler, the fires will go away. 
The west coast of the United States 
is on fire, and 10 percent of Oregon is 
under evacuation order. A warning— 
that is half a million people. We have 
dozens of wildfires burning right now 
in California, including the largest in 
the history of that State. It has blotted 
out the sun for hundreds and hundreds 
of miles. The Southwest is shrouded in 
a horrifying, constant twilight. 
We can keep looking at these things 
in isolation, as if somehow or other 
they are not connected. Each fiery con-
flagration, each hurricane, each dev-
astating flood, each ungodly windstorm 
that wipes out a whole year of crops— 
we can say they have nothing to do 
with each other or we can look at the 
truth and listen to the science and say 
enough is enough. 
We can lie to ourselves and say, as 
Trump does, that one day these things 
will just ‘‘magically disappear,’’ de-
pending upon whether the heat or cool-
ing will solve the problem. But we all 
know better. We know that unless we 
act now, the fires will happen annually 
and burn hotter and larger each sum-
mer, each fall in our country. We know 
that the hurricanes will get worse and 
more frequent. Two made landfall at 
once this year. We know that they will 
disrupt and destroy the economies of 
the gulf and the eastern seaboard. 
How many times can we ask our peo-
ple to rebuild? We know that mid-
western floods will grow each year, 
drowning out a whole way of life and 
making refugees of our farmers. We 
know that the windstorms like those 
this year will continue to destroy

crops. Iowa lost 43 percent of its corn 
and soybeans this year. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator has used his 10 minutes. 
Mr. MARKEY. No, it will not magi-
cally disappear. We need a Green New 
Deal. We need a solution that matches 
the magnitude of the problem. 
I yield back to the Presiding Officer. 
I appreciate his indulgence. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
complete my remarks before the lunch 
recess. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, let me 
say that I join my friend from Massa-
chusetts in a desire to see us take up 
and pass another COVID–19 relief bill. I 
would say that so far, the House of 
Representatives has taken a com-
pletely unrealistic approach, including 
many non-COVID–19 relief provisions 
in the bill, including tax cuts for mil-
lionaires and billionaires. They lit-
erally include, in the COVID–19 bill 
they call the Heroes Act, a tax cut by 
removing the cap on deductibility on 
State and local taxes on your Federal 
income tax. 
When we did that in the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act, we felt it was improper to 
force States like the Presiding Officer’s 
and mine to subsidize the irresponsible 
spending practices in major cities like 
New York and San Francisco. 
If our Democratic friends are indeed 
serious about wanting to get a deal, we 
are open, certainly, to negotiating a 
deal, just as we did the first four bills 
that we passed, especially by unani-
mous vote. 
It seems the closer we get to the elec-
tion, which is now 49 days out, that the 
old partisan dysfunction begins to 
creep back in and you hear speeches 
like the Senator from Massachusetts 
just gave, advocating things like the 
Green New Deal as a solution to all the 
world’s problems. It is just completely 
pie in the sky and a pipedream that is 
obviously not going anywhere. 
That doesn’t stop our friends across 
the aisle blaming this side of the aisle 
or the President for everything that 
happens in the world, including hurri-
canes and forest fires, which are large-
ly as a result of failing to undertake 
proper forest management that we 
know can prevent fires. They blame it 
on climate change. It is an easy argu-
ment claiming science is on their side. 
We need to be good stewards about 
our environment, no doubt about it. I 
have no doubt the climate is changing 
and humans contribute to that, but 
there are smarter and better ways for 
us to approach it other than elimi-
nating jobs and burdening people on 
fixed incomes with higher electricity 
and energy costs and just embracing an 
ideological solution, which is no solu-
tion at all and will create more prob-
lems than it solves. 
I would just say, finally, on this 
point, that we know that the guidance 
from the Centers for Disease Control 
has evolved over time. I went back and 
checked. My friend in Massachusetts 
says the President did this; he did that; 
he said this; he didn’t do this. I remem-
ber going back and looking at the Cen-
ters for Disease Control guidance be-
fore April. They said masks were inef-
fective; they didn’t do anything. They 
came back after some additional inves-
tigation and research and said: Well, 
they can help. That is why we are all 
wearing masks, especially when we 
can’t socially distance. 
Looking at this pandemic now in 
September as opposed to the way it 
looked in March, we have learned a lot, 
thank goodness. Our medical profes-
sionals have saved a lot of lives. We 
learned how to mitigate the risks. We 
learned how to live with the virus at 
the same time we are investing heavily 
in therapies and a vaccine, which can’t 
come soon enough. 
Senate Republicans have made at-
tempt after attempt to deliver another 
round of coronavirus relief to the 
American people. In July, we proposed 
the HEALS Act, which was a starting 
point for negotiations. We realized this 
wasn’t the end-all and be-all any more 
than the Democrats’ Heroes Act, this 
$3 trillion hodgepodge of an ideological 
wish list that we knew wasn’t going to 
pass, but we knew we needed to start 
somewhere. 
Speaker PELOSI didn’t help when she 
quickly disparaged our starting pro-
posal as ‘‘pathetic.’’ And, of course, 
Senator SCHUMER, the minority leader 
in the Senate, called it ‘‘unworkable.’’ 
I guess they thought they finished 
their job, and they dismissed it out-
right and did nothing to negotiate in 
good faith toward a resolution. They 
simply have no interest in amending 
the bill or trying to find a common 
ground. They just stiff-armed it. 
This August, when we attempted to 
narrow the scope of the negotiation to 
the most urgent matters—things like 
continuing Federal unemployment ben-
efits, which expired at the end of 
July—this time our Democratic col-
leagues rejected what they called a 
‘‘piecemeal’’ approach. Never mind the 
fact that the House returned to Wash-
ington to pass a bill only to help the 
Postal Service, which was actually bi-
partisan. Apparently, that kind of 
piecemeal is acceptable as long as it is 
a Democratic-sponsored and authored 
bill. 
That brings us to September. Last 
week, we gave it another shot. The ma-
jority leader brought the bill to the 
floor to address some of the most press-
ing challenges facing the American 
people: funding schools, vaccine re-
search, more testing, unemployment 
benefits, 
helping 
small 
businesses, 
again, through the extension of the 
Paycheck Protection Program—all of 
which should be and I believe, in truth, 
are bipartisan goals. 
Unfortunately, our Democratic col-
leagues couldn’t resist that old tempta-
tion of partisan dysfunction this close 
to the election. They pulled out the 
same playbook they used all summer. 
Once again, they refused to engage in 
any meaningful negotiations. They re-
sorted to name-calling and blocked the 
bill from even being debated. You can’t 
pass a bill unless you are willing to 
start considering it, but they weren’t 
willing to even do that. 
Here we are battling a pandemic, 
which has claimed more than 190,000 
Americans, and Democrats blocked 
every attempt to pass a piece of legis-
lation since March. Rather than trying 
to negotiate or amend these bills or 
reach a bipartisan compromise, they 
seem to be content with airing their 
grievances at press conferences. 
I agree with one thing the Senator 
from Massachusetts said: There are 
people who are hurting and need help. 
We should not take some perverse de-
light in exacerbating that pain or not-
ing that pain and being unwilling to do 
anything to relieve it. 
This may be a political game for 
some of our colleagues. It may be a 
way to try to score points against the 
President or try to gain advantage in 
the runup to the election on November 
3, but I assure you, it is not an honest 
attempt to try to solve a problem; it is 
not a genuine attempt to try to provide 
relief to the American people who are 
hurting; and it is not moving us any 
closer to defeating this virus once and 
for all. 
In the bills we passed so far—again, 
on a bipartisan basis, largely unani-
mously—we 
provided 
unprecedented 
support for American families, includ-
ing direct payments, bolstered unem-
ployment benefits, and provided the 
ability to defer student loan payments. 
We sent help to farmers, ranchers, and 
producers. We helped our schools pre-
pare for the new school year and gave 
small businesses and their employees 
the resources to stay afloat. We have 
provided stability for families and 
communities across Texas and across 
the Nation. 
More help is needed, especially to 
bolster our response to the virus itself. 
We know we are in a global race to de-
velop a vaccine and treatment. Our 
brightest scientific minds are working 
24/7 to deliver those lifesaving drugs to 
the world as quickly as we can, safely 
and effectively, but they need more 
money to succeed. 
At the same time, our communities 
are trying to test as many people as 
they can, whether it is people attend-
ing college football games or surveil-
lance testing in communities or at col-
leges or grade schools. Our constitu-
ents don’t care about our partisan dis-
agreements. They just want us to do 
everything we can to help them and to 
help us defeat this virus. 
During the month of August, I was 
able to travel around the State and to 
listen to feedback from my constitu-
ents on how the funding we provided so 
far has aided in the fight against 
COVID–19. Congress has provided more 
than 
$234 
billion 
to 
support

healthcare response. That includes $10 
billion for research and development of 
a vaccine through Operation Warp 
Speed, $16 billion for personal protec-
tive equipment, $26 billion for testing, 
and, of course, the $173 billion Provider 
Relief Fund to help our hospitals. 
More 
than 
23,000 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare providers in my State alone 
have received more than $5.1 billion in 
Federal funding, allowing them to pro-
cure critical resources like masks and 
gloves and to cover mounting costs due 
to the deferral of elective procedures. 
In August, I had a chance to person-
ally thank some of the healthcare 
workers in Abilene, Waco, Wichita 
Falls, Amarillo, Lubbock, and Corpus 
Christi. I also had lunch and visited 
with the children of healthcare work-
ers in the Rio Grande Valley who, even 
at such a young age, are amazed by the 
heroic work of their parents. 
As our war against this virus carries 
on, we need to ensure that our front-
line workers and healthcare providers 
have the resources they need to sustain 
this fight. 
I also visited with the Family Health 
Center in Waco, which is 1 of 73 feder-
ally qualified health centers in Texas 
operating more than 500 sites. This is 
really a critical part of our healthcare 
safety net in my State and across the 
Nation. 
I have always been a strong sup-
porter of our community health cen-
ters and cofounded the Senate Commu-
nity Health Centers Caucus several 
years ago. As I said, these facilities 
make quality healthcare a reality for 
so many Texans, whether they have 
Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, 
or no insurance. Texans can go to these 
health centers and receive the care 
they need when they need it. 
The particular Family Health Center 
I visited in Waco was founded more 
than 50 years ago to address a shortage 
of doctors and primary care access for 
low-income patients and has since 
grown to 15 clinics across McLennan 
County, which provide not only pri-
mary and preventive care but dental 
and behavioral healthcare too. 
As Family Health Center CEO, Dr. 
Jackson Griggs, said community-ori-
ented primary care is difficult in any 
era, and it has been uniquely chal-
lenging during COVID–19. Unexpected 
operating costs and lost revenue cre-
ated serious financial hardship, but be-
cause of the $3 million in the CARES 
Act and other Federal funding they 
got, they have continued to provide 
quality healthcare during this time of 
critical need. Because of Federal fund-
ing, they have been able to test every 
person who comes in with symptoms. 
They received the equipment, the kits, 
the mobile computer systems, tents, 
and the air-conditioning units that al-
lows staff to test patients outdoors, 
even during a hot Texas summer. 
During our visit, Dr. Griggs told me 
they conducted more than 7,400 tests, 
with over 1,500 patients testing posi-
tive. Of those, 53 percent were unin-
sured. Without legislation passed by 
Congress, who knows what these pa-
tients would have been able to afford or 
even get access to a COVID–19 test. 
This funding has also provided more 
than 187,000 pieces of PPE to the Fam-
ily Health Center’s doctors, nurses, 
dentists, social workers, and staff who 
are trying to stay safe and healthy 
while they continue to care for their 
patients. 
On top of that, the funds have pro-
vided the information technology in-
frastructure to get telehealth services 
started in record time and nearly 11,000 
hours of paid leave for healthcare 
workers and other staff members who 
become ill or need to quarantine be-
cause of the virus. 
The legislation we passed has also 
helped community health centers, hos-
pitals, clinics, nursing homes, and 
healthcare facilities throughout the 
State continue to serve their commu-
nities. 
As we keep working to deliver the as-
sistance for the American people, we 
need 
to 
continue 
to 
support 
our 
healthcare response. This means ensur-
ing that the providers continue to have 
the 
resources 
needed 
to 
operate 
throughout this crisis. It means more 
resources for testing and contact trac-
ing to stop the spread. It means an 
even greater investment in the race to 
discover a vaccine and treatment so we 
can finally bring this crisis to an end. 
It 
means 
continuing 
to 
provide 
healthcare coverage for those who are 
laid off or furloughed or lost employer 
coverage. 
I recently introduced a bill with my 
friend Senator MCSALLY from Arizona 
to provide some degree of certainty for 
folks who found themselves without a 
job or health coverage through no fault 
of their own. It is called the Contin-
uous Health Coverage for Workers Act, 
which would provide premium assist-
ance for COBRA coverage during the 
rest of the year. As the coronavirus has 
wreaked havoc on our job market, it 
has filled countless Texans’ lives with 
uncertainty. By passing this legisla-
tion as part of the next relief bill, we 
can ensure that those who previously 
maintained 
their 
health 
coverage 
through their employer can continue 
to do so through the end of the year. 
Let me just say in conclusion that 
COVID–19 is not a partisan issue. It 
hasn’t been up until this point. Unfor-
tunately, the wheels came off, at least 
for the time being. We need to put 
those wheels back on the car. We are 
all on the same team fighting a com-
mon enemy. I hope we can rediscover 
the sense of bipartisanship and com-
mon purpose that helped us pass four 
bills up through and including March. 
During August, I was able to spend 
time speaking with countless of my 
constituents about the bills we had 
passed and discussing what more was 
needed. In addition to hearing from the 
healthcare workers and providers who 
had been on the frontlines, I also joined 
students and teachers for socially 
distanced 
conversations 
about 
the 
challenges that had been brought on by 
the start of the new school year. I held 
a video call with restaurant owners 
about the ongoing impact of the pan-
demic on their businesses. On tele-
phone townhalls, I heard from con-
stituents about their struggles to make 
ends meet after they lost their jobs and 
then lost the extra $600 a week in Fed-
eral unemployment benefits, which 
lapsed because our colleagues wouldn’t 
allow us to take up and consider, at 
some level, a continuation of those en-
hanced benefits. 
As our Democratic colleagues have 
continued to play games, these are the 
folks who have been hurt, and I am 
sure there are similar situations in 
each of their States. For these Texans 
whom I have described, COVID–19 isn’t 
about political points or sound bites— 
it is about their health, their families’ 
safety, and their livelihoods. 
While it seems like some have yield-
ed to the temptation of using this pan-
demic for political gain, I am com-
mitted to continuing to work with all 
of our colleagues who are willing to en-
sure that we don’t lose any of the 
ground we have gained in the war 
against COVID–19. We are literally up 
against the clock, and enough time has 
been wasted on name-calling, finger- 
pointing, and political posturing. It is 
time for the games to end so that we 
can finally provide our constituents, 
including our frontline heroes, with the 
resources they need in order to sustain 
and win this fight. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5590 
September 15, 2020 
to be United States District Judge for 
the Southern District of California. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1508 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I have a 
unanimous consent request. 
‘‘We hope they die.’’ ‘‘We hope they 
die.’’ ‘‘We hope they die.’’ 
These are the vile words that anti-po-
lice protesters yelled on Saturday 
night, outside St. Francis Medical Cen-
ter, in Los Angeles County, CA. They 
were yelling that about two deputy 
sheriffs, 
who, 
at 
the 
time, 
were 
clinging to life inside the hospital. 
They were clinging to life, just barely, 
because, earlier that night, those two 
deputy sheriffs were brutally ambushed 
by a gunman, who shot them multiple 
times as they sat in their patrol car 
while they were simply doing their jobs 
of patrolling the local train station. 
One of the deputies is a 31-year-old 
mother of a 6-year-old boy. The other 
deputy is a 24-year-old man. Both 
joined the force about 14 months ago. 
The female deputy was shot through 
the jaw, but, heroically, she still man-
aged to radio for help and apply a tour-
niquet to her partner’s wounds. 
What happened to these deputies in 
Los Angeles was horrific and dan-
gerous. It is a reminder that, every sin-
gle day, law enforcement officers put 
on a badge and then risk their lives to 
protect all of us—and I mean every sin-
gle day. 
Just this past Sunday, a police offi-
cer in Lancaster, PA, responded to a 
domestic violence call. It came from a 
home in the city. His body cam video 
captured what happened next. When 
the officer arrived, a full-grown man, 
wielding a huge carving knife and wav-
ing it over his head, came charging out 
of the house and charged straight at 
the officer. The man who did this, as it 
happens, is scheduled to go on trial in 
October on charges of stabbing four 
people last year. 
What happened to the deputies in Los 
Angeles is not only horrific but is part 
of 
a 
disturbing trend of violence 
against police. According to the FBI, 37 
law enforcement officials have been in-
tentionally killed in the line of duty so 
far this year. That is a 23-percent in-
crease from the same period last year. 
Rioters have attacked law enforce-
ment. We have seen them hurling 
bricks and rocks and other dangerous 
objects. We have seen them ram them 
with their vehicles and set police cars 
on fire. 
This violence against police is not 
happening in a vacuum. It is not. In re-
cent months, the Nation has been en-
gaged in an important, substantive de-
bate about the relationship between 
law enforcement and the communities 
they serve and protect. I happen to 
think the debate is important. It is one 
of the reasons I supported Senator TIM 
SCOTT’s bill—to provide more account-
ability and transparency with respect 
to law enforcement. 
Unfortunately, our Democratic col-
leagues blocked us from even being 
able to hold a debate on that bill. Sen-
ator SCOTT and the Republicans were 
willing to allow votes on any Demo-
cratic amendments. They could have 
changed the bill in any way they had 
seen fit if they could have made the 
case with their amendments, but they 
refused to even have a process—they 
refused to even allow anyone, including 
themselves, to offer amendments. They 
refused to let us even consider the bill. 
The police reform debate has exposed 
some radical voices. Unfortunately, 
that sometimes includes government 
officials who spew anti-police rhetoric. 
They call for defunding—sometimes 
even for abolishing—the police, and 
they want to bail out rioters in Min-
neapolis. 
For example, after the two Los Ange-
les deputy sheriffs were shot on Satur-
day, not only did anti-police protesters 
yell ‘‘We hope they die’’ and other vile 
things outside the hospital, but the 
city manager of Lynwood, CA—the 
very city where the deputies were 
clinging to their lives in the hospital— 
the city manager responded to the 
shooting by posting on social media a 
message saying ‘‘Chickens come home 
to roost.’’ Can you imagine? 
Well, protesters feed off the failure of 
elected officials to support and defend 
the police. In Lancaster, after that 
knife-wielding man was shot by an offi-
cer who was just protecting his own 
life, which was obviously under serious 
risk, protesters came out and started 
rioting—throwing bricks, rocks, and 
bottles at police, smashing windows at 
a police station and a post office, set-
ting a dumpster on fire—despite the 
fact that the video clearly shows that 
the officer was being attacked. He was 
simply defending his life. I have no 
idea why anyone would protest a police 
officer defending his own life. 
In my own State of Pennsylvania, a 
local Democratic elected official in 
Delaware County recently posted an 
image—unbelievable—on social media 
of two Black men holding guns to the 
head of a White police officer with a 
caption that said ‘‘Does it have to 
come to this to make them stop mur-
dering and terrorizing us?’’ What kind 
of message is that? 
As the Los Angeles County sheriff 
noted on Saturday—after his officers 
were shot, he said: ‘‘Words have con-
sequences.’’ They do. 
You know, instead of defunding the 
police, we should be defending the po-
lice—defending them against this kind 
of violence both in word and especially 
in deed. That is why I am here today, 
calling on the Senate to pass my Thin 
Blue Line Act today. 
My bill sends a very simple and clear 
message: Anyone who murders a law 
enforcement official should be prepared 
to pay the ultimate price. Under Fed-
eral law, killing a Federal law enforce-
ment official is an aggravating factor 
for the Federal jury to weigh when con-
sidering whether to impose the death 
penalty on a cop killer, but that con-
sideration does not apply when a State 
or local law enforcement officer is 
killed. So the Thin Blue Line Act pro-
vides that same level of justice to 
State and local law enforcement offi-
cers that we already apply to Federal 
law enforcement officers by also mak-
ing the killing of a local law enforce-
ment officer an aggravating factor in 
determining whether to impose the 
death penalty in a Federal case. 
In 2017, the House passed this bill 
with bipartisan support, including sup-
port of liberals like ADAM SCHIFF and 
Beto O’Rourke. The bill has very broad 
support from law enforcement groups, 
as you might imagine, including from 
the Fraternal Order of Police, the Na-
tional Sheriffs’ Association, the Na-
tional Association of Police Organiza-
tions, and others. 
The Thin Blue Line Act is common-
sense, bipartisan legislation that the 
Senate should pass now. Our law en-
forcement officers put themselves in 
harm’s way every day, and we are re-
minded of that every day. They are out 
there protecting us, and I am not sure 
that has ever been more dangerous for 
law enforcement than it is today. We 
need to do our part to support them, to 
send a message to them that we sup-
port them but to send a message to 
criminals and potential assassins that 
they will pay the ultimate price. 
In the tragic event that a police offi-
cer is killed in the line of duty, we owe 
that officer justice, and I am going to 
keep fighting for them to receive it. 
So, as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Judiciary 
Committee be discharged from further 
consideration of S. 1508 and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; further, that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, thank 
you for the recognition. 
As a former New Mexico attorney 
general and assistant U.S. attorney, I 
have worked hard to prosecute violent 
crimes. I have been privileged to work 
with law enforcement, and we are all 
thankful for the tremendous work the 
Capitol Police do here in our Nation’s 
Capital. 
The recent shootings of two sheriff’s 
deputies in California was heinous. Our 
prayers go out to the officers and their 
families. The perpetrator must be 
brought to justice. But I do not support 
rushing through this bill in response to 
the California shootings. 
Under California law, murder of a law 
enforcement 
officer 
already 
makes 
someone eligible for the death penalty. 
This bill needlessly expands the Fed-
eral death penalty. 
As I understand this bill, for someone 
to be eligible for the death penalty, he

or she would have to first be convicted 
of Federal murder, and then it would 
need to be proven beyond a reasonable 
doubt that the victim was killed or tar-
geted because he or she was a law en-
forcement officer. 
I also want to point out that the 
death penalty itself has widespread 
issues 
and 
many 
instances 
of 
misapplication. DNA testing and other 
science have proven that innocent peo-
ple have been executed. The Innocence 
Project has found that 21 of 375 individ-
uals who were falsely convicted and ex-
onerated by DNA testing since 1989 had 
served time on death row. 
The death penalty has also been ap-
plied in a racially discriminatory way. 
A 1990 GAO report on capital sen-
tencing noted that 82 percent of studies 
conducted between 1972 and 1990 found 
that the race of the victim influenced 
whether a capital murder charge was 
brought or a death sentence imposed. 
As Justice Breyer has noted, ‘‘The 
factors that most clearly ought to af-
fect application of the death penalty, 
namely, comparative egregiousness of 
the crime, often do not. Instead, cir-
cumstances that ought not to affect 
application of the death penalty, such 
as race, gender or geography, often 
do.’’ That is in a recent Supreme Court 
case here in 2015. 
I also understand that this bill has 
not been through the regular order in 
the Judiciary Committee. It is impor-
tant that legislation that would have 
serious consequences is fully examined 
by the Judiciary Committee, the com-
mittee of jurisdiction here. 
I would also like to take this oppor-
tunity to call attention to key legisla-
tion that addresses violence and should 
come to the floor, and that is the Vio-
lence Against Women Reauthorization 
Act. 
VAWA authorization expired over a 
year and a half ago, on February 15, 
2019. Funding continues, but key im-
provements are being delayed by lack 
of reauthorization. 
The Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act of 2019 is supported by 
all 47 Democratic Senators. The House 
passed the bill 263 to 158. Thirty-three 
House Republicans voted yes on that 
bill. This bill would extend VAWA for 5 
years, through 2024. 
As the vice chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs, I know 
how critical this bill is to Indian Coun-
try. Data from the U.S. Department of 
Justice indicates that Native women 
face murder rates that are more than 
10 times the national average murder 
rate. There are more than 5,000 cases of 
missing American Indian and Alaska 
Native women, and 55 percent of Native 
women have experienced domestic vio-
lence. More than four in five American 
Indian and Alaska Native women expe-
rience violence in their lifetimes. With-
out enactment of a VAWA reauthoriza-
tion, these Tribes will lack the juris-
dictional tools they need to keep their 
communities safe. 
The VAWA bill also explicitly states 
that grant recipients can train staff to 
prevent LGBT discrimination, and it 
adds dating partners convicted of do-
mestic violence and stalking to the 
category of persons barred from having 
handguns. 
This bill would make a real dif-
ference in preventing violent crimes 
against women and has passed the 
House and has been pending before us 
here in the Senate for many months. 
For these reasons, I respectfully ob-
ject to the Senator’s request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, first of 
all, let me just say that bringing up 
VAWA can’t be anything other than an 
attempt to obfuscate from the case 
that is in front of us. I would be happy 
to talk about VAWA. I happen to agree 
that violence against women is a seri-
ous issue. It is a serious problem. All 
the programs in VAWA are still fully 
funded. They continue. 
I don’t think anybody in this body or 
the other body has done as much as I 
have done to make sure that the re-
sources in the Crime Victims Fund go 
to the victims of crime—very much in-
cluding women who are victims of vio-
lent crime and children and the groups 
who serve those victims. 
As a matter of fact, I have supported 
previous versions of VAWA. There has 
been a bipartisan effort to get a new re-
authorization of VAWA. Senator ERNST 
and Senator FEINSTEIN
have spent 
months developing that. But that is 
not the version that has been under 
consideration here. 
No, there is nothing incompatible 
about passing my legislation, the Thin 
Blue Line Act, standing up to protect 
local law enforcement, and having a 
separate consideration on VAWA. They 
are not mutually exclusive. They are 
not in any way related to each other. 
But, unfortunately, our Democratic 
colleagues are not willing to simply ex-
tend the same protection we extend to 
Federal law enforcement officials to 
the local law enforcement officials who 
are at risk every single day. 
I am very disappointed that my col-
league from New Mexico would object 
to a very simple and sensible bill that 
has bipartisan support. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2843 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, as if in 
legislation session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Judiciary Committee 
be discharged from further consider-
ation of S. 2843, the Violence Against 
Women Reauthorization Act, and that 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration; further, that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and the motion to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, for the 
reasons that I mentioned earlier in my 
comments, I object to this version of 
VAWA. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, thank 
you for the recognition today. 
We rise—a number of Senators who 
will be speaking today in this hour—we 
rise today to demand that the White 
House immediately remove William 
Perry Pendley from exercising the au-
thority of the Director of the Bureau of 
Land Management and nominate a 
qualified person to be Director, subject 
to Senate confirmation. 
William Perry Pendley embodies the 
Trump administration’s approach to 
conservation—they don’t believe in it. 
He embodies the Trump administra-
tion’s approach to Tribal sovereignty— 
they don’t respect it. His continued 
employment at BLM embodies the 
Trump administration’s approach to 
the law and the separation of powers— 
they will trample all over it every 
chance they get. 
Mr. Pendley has been exercising the 
authority of the Director since July 
2019. Let’s get one thing straight: This 
title has no basis in law. He is serving 
as Acting BLM Director under tem-
porary appointments that the Sec-
retary keeps renewing in a cynical ploy 
to evade the Constitution, the Federal 
Vacancies Reform Act, and the judg-
ment of the Senate. 
Mr. Pendley’s record on conservation 
is so bad, so antithetical to the agency 
he oversees, that the Trump adminis-
tration knew he wouldn’t survive a 
Senate confirmation. So, instead, they 
have concocted this shell game. 
The Director of BLM is subject to 
Senate confirmation. This administra-
tion did not bother to nominate anyone 
for 4 years until June of this year when 
Mr. Pendley was formally nominated. 
However, the ink had barely dried on 
his nomination papers before the Presi-
dent was forced to withdraw the nomi-
nation. 
From the beginning, the conserva-
tion outdoor recreation sports men and 
women communities have been uni-
formly opposed to Mr. Pendley’s ap-
pointment, but that is not why the 
President withdrew his nomination. He 
withdrew the nomination because Mr. 
Pendley’s extreme anti-public lands po-
sitions made him too toxic for Repub-
lican Senators from Western States 
facing tough reelections. 
If Mr. Pendley can’t be confirmed as 
BLM Director, he should not remain 
the de facto leader of the agency. He 
should be immediately removed. No 
more shell games. There are many rea-
sons Mr. Pendley is unfit to serve, 
more than I have time to discuss, but 
let me discuss three with you now. 
First, over the course of his 40-year 
career, he has established himself as 
one of the premier anti-public lands 
crusaders in the Nation. He has repeat-
edly advocated that the Federal Gov-
ernment sell off public lands, arguing 
that was the Nation’s Founders’ intent. 
As recently as 2016, he penned an op- 
ed entitled—and I quote here from his

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5592 
September 15, 2020 
op-ed—‘‘The 
Federal 
Government 
Should Follow the Constitution and 
Sell Its Western Lands.’’ This is from 
the man who is now charged with run-
ning the agency that oversees our pub-
lic lands. It is appalling. 
BLM manages 245 million acres on 
behalf of the American people. Man-
aging these public lands is the central 
mission of the job, and he doesn’t think 
there should be any. It is no wonder he 
is trouble for western Republican can-
didates. Poll after poll of westerners 
show overwhelming support for public 
lands among Republicans, Democrats, 
and Independents. Selling off our na-
tional heritage to the highest bidder is 
extreme and extremely unpopular. 
Mr. Pendley has been singularly fo-
cused on renting out our public lands 
to extraction industries to the exclu-
sion of other purposes, such as con-
servation, 
outdoor 
recreation, 
and 
preservation of cultural and historic 
values. 
As Deputy Assistant Secretary of En-
ergy and Minerals for the Department 
of the Interior in the 1980s, Pendley 
was a tireless advocate for opening up 
public lands, from the Outer Conti-
nental Shelf to wilderness areas, to 
drilling and mining. When he was in 
charge of coal leasing in the interior in 
the 1980s, he helped coal companies get 
a sweetheart deal—leasing 1.6 million 
tons of coal in the Powder River Basin 
at bargain basement prices. The Gen-
eral Accounting Office concluded that 
Federal taxpayers received about $100 
million below fair market value for 
that sale, or about $286 million in to-
day’s dollars. 
Mr. Pendley was removed from his 
position after that GAO report, and he 
hasn’t changed one bit over the years. 
As executive director of the Mountain 
States Legal Foundation for 30 years, 
Pendley fought tooth and nail for drill-
ing and mining on our public lands. If 
left unchecked, I have no doubt Mr. 
Pendley will continue to turn back the 
clock on 60 years of our Nation reck-
oning 
with 
the 
devastating 
con-
sequences of recklessly extracting from 
the Earth. 
Second, 
Mr. 
Pendley’s 
well-docu-
mented racist attitudes make him 
unfit for his role. He has disdain for 
Native Americans—their Tribal sov-
ereignty and their religious practices. 
He is very anti-immigrant. He smears 
the Black Lives Matter movement. He 
called Native religious views: ‘‘pan-
theism, 
paganism, 
and 
cultural 
myths.’’ He has fought against pro-
tecting their sacred sites on Federal 
lands. 
It is Pendley’s BLM that wanted to 
hold virtual meetings to determine the 
future of the greater Chaco Canyon 
landscape at the same time that the 
Navajo Nation was facing one of the 
worst COVID–19 outbreaks in the coun-
try. And in that area that has some of 
the lowest broadband rates in the Na-
tion—now talk about tone-deaf—as the 
vice chair of the Senate Committee on 
Indian Affairs, I am here to say that 
Mr. Pendley has no business managing 
lands that are home to sacred Native 
sites. He has questioned the basis of 
Tribal sovereignty and even Tribal rec-
ognition. He wrote: ‘‘The day may 
come sooner than many expect given 
that, with ever-declining blood quan-
tum per tribal member, recognized 
tribes may soon be little more than as-
sociations of financial convenience.’’ 
Let’s call Mr. Pendley’s offensive 
statement what it is: overt racism. But 
his disdain for people of color is not 
limited to Native Americans. He has 
called undocumented immigrants ‘‘a 
cancer.’’ He has claimed immigration 
will lead to: ‘‘You and I permanently 
losing the country we love.’’ He has 
claimed 
undocumented 
immigrants 
create violent crime, crowded schools, 
and spread disease. Mr. Pendley’s rac-
ism has no place in today’s America. 
He is unqualified to manage public 
lands at a time when we all should be 
working to make them more accessible 
to all America. 
People of color who have business be-
fore the Bureau of Land Management, 
as many do every day, have every right 
to wonder: Is the deck stacked against 
them? It shouldn’t be that way. 
And, finally, a third reason that all 
of us should demand Mr. Pendley be re-
moved from his position: He is a cli-
mate change denier. The science of cli-
mate change that is happening and 
that is human-caused is well estab-
lished. We are years and years beyond 
any 
scientific 
argument 
on 
these 
points. Just open your eyes and look at 
the wildfires that are raging through-
out the West, forcing people to evac-
uate their homes and making wide 
swaths of the West look like an apoca-
lyptic scene out over a Hollywood 
movie. Yet Pendley has claimed that 
climate change is like unicorns—nei-
ther exist. 
Pendley’s hostility to science comes 
as no surprise. He is working for a 
President who claimed just yesterday, 
as he made a belated visit to Cali-
fornia, that ‘‘I don’t think science 
knows,’’ referring to climate change. 
The President is saying: ‘‘I don’t think 
science knows.’’ 
The President claims he knows, in-
sisting, ‘‘It will start getting cooler.’’ 
This President tries to undermine any 
institution that challenges his world 
view—whether it is science, the press, 
our national intelligence agencies, or 
the courts. 
But while Mr. Pendley and the Presi-
dent 
deny 
the 
reality 
of 
climate 
change, right now, today, in California 
and Oregon, BLM and other public 
lands are burning. While they put their 
heads in the sand on climate change, 
the families who have lost loved ones 
in this unprecedented fire season in 
that part of the country and the thou-
sands who have lost homes don’t have 
that luxury. In the view of William 
Pendley, the President, and his admin-
istration, the West is a place to be 
plundered for natural resources and 
then left to burn. And while Pendley 
and the Trump administration don’t 
think the Interior Department has any 
role to play combating climate change, 
in fact, one-quarter—25 percent—of all 
U.S. carbon emissions come from fossil 
fuels extracted from public lands. 
Our public lands are a big part of the 
climate change problem. Instead of 
being a source of pollution, public 
lands must be an integral part of the 
climate solution. William Pendley’s vi-
sion for public lands is some terrible 
caricature that should be consigned to 
the history books, where our public 
lands are to be exploited, not con-
served, 
where 
Native 
people 
are 
scorned and people of color are not 
seen, and where climate change does 
not exist. 
William Pendley is an extremist, and 
he was never going to be confirmed by 
the U.S. Senate. It is time he is shown 
the door. 
I now turn to my colleagues who are 
with me on the floor. I am very proud 
to introduce my good friend and col-
league, New Mexico’s junior—soon-to- 
be senior Senator—Senator MARTIN 
HEINRICH. Martin led the entire Senate 
Democratic caucus in a letter to the 
President opposing Mr. Pendley’s nom-
ination as BLM Director, and once the 
nomination was withdrawn, he led the 
caucus urging the Secretary to remove 
Mr. Pendley from his Acting position. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
HURRICANE LAURA 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, at the 
forbearance of my colleagues, if I can 
interpolate, if you will, and I will yield 
back. Thank you very much. 
As I speak, Hurricane Sally threatens 
the gulf coast, including parts of Lou-
isiana. Our prayers are with those in 
the path of Sally. I just spoke with the 
Coast Guard admiral in charge, and the 
Coast Guard is ready should there be a 
need. 
But in the concern over Sally and 
other issues, we must remember the 
aftermath of Hurricane Laura, which 
made landfall August 27 in Cameron, 
LA, as a category 4–5 hurricane. In 
terms of wind speed, this is 150 miles 
an hour. A more powerful storm in that 
regard is Katrina, Rita, Gustav, Ike, 
and others. 
As you might imagine, a storm of 
such magnitude left death, destruction, 
and pain from Southwest Louisiana 
into Texas to North Louisiana, Arkan-
sas, and Mississippi. 
There were 25 people who died di-
rectly or indirectly because of Hurri-
cane Laura, and hundreds of thousands 
of lives have been upended. As one ex-
ample—one measure—as of yesterday, 
145,000 people in Louisiana have filed 
for assistance with FEMA. That is ex-
pected to grow to roughly 2,800 people 
a day applying for assistance. 
Now, the sentiment at home is if you 
are without electricity, as 97 percent of 
Cameron Parish goes without elec-
tricity, and you are without internet, 
as most people are, the fear is that

September 15, 2020 
folks have forgotten about Hurricane 
Laura, that recovery efforts will be 
stalled, and things will be ignored as 
attention 
turns 
to 
other 
issues— 
COVID–19, Presidential race, et cetera. 
And, anecdotally, there is, of course, 
evidence 
that 
public 
opinion 
has 
slipped. 
Last week, I spoke with Gail McGov-
ern, the president of the American Red 
Cross, who told me that donations are 
lagging well below that which the Red 
Cross had hoped to receive to cover the 
cost of their response. She assured me, 
though, that the Red Cross would still 
do everything needed. I saw testimony 
of that, by the way. I flew from Lou-
isiana to Washington, DC, yesterday, 
and the jet was full of Red Cross volun-
teers. We are so appreciative. 
I assure folks back home, just to say, 
that I did get a call from President 
Trump just as the hurricane hit. He as-
sured me that whatever resources were 
needed, he would make sure they were 
there. As I told folks in Louisiana, 
there was an audience of one paying at-
tention, a very important audience, 
and that is the President. 
In this speech, I hope to continue to 
bring this hurricane and its aftermath 
to the attention of other fellow Ameri-
cans because fellow Americans take 
care of ourselves and take care of each 
other. So I am here to be a voice for 
the people of Louisiana and share a 
story so that you may know what we 
are facing at home. 
Again, I am appreciative of the 
United Way, American Red Cross, 
President Trump, and others for swift-
ly doing all they can do to help us 
through this recovery, but let’s tell the 
story. 
Here is a wonderful story from Lake 
Arthur, LA. She probably doesn’t like 
the fact that I am showing this. She 
didn’t like how she looked. I think she 
looks 
fantastic. 
This 
is 
Bethel 
Boudreaux, a great American patriot 
and a great Louisiana name. If you 
look at this picture, there is a tree 
that has fallen over the guy’s house. 
There is a fellow in the tree cutting 
down limbs that is on top of his house. 
Here she is with a tree behind her and 
all the debris associated with it hold-
ing up an American flag. Now, her con-
cern was that if we showed this pic-
ture, we recognize that her husband, a 
veteran, is familiar with how damaged 
flags should be destroyed, but this had 
been fluttering during the hurricane, 
and she just wanted to show it. 
She has got a smile. This is 1 or 2 
days after this devastating hurricane. 
With all this, in the spirit of Ameri-
cans, she is holding that flag, and she 
is smiling. She is a great American pa-
triot, but it also shows the attitude of 
Americans and the attitudes of people 
in Louisiana. We are resilient in the 
face of adversity. 
There is more than enough adversity 
to go around. Let me just give you a 
couple of stories that are on our 
Facebook page. Mike Williams from 
Lake Charles gave our office a tour of 
his home. His metal roof was com-
pletely ripped off. Water came all 
through his house. The ceiling is fall-
ing in, and every single room has ex-
tensive water damage. 
There is 20-year-old Hannah Vinson, 
who shared that her childhood home 
was gone. The roof collapsed, flooded, 
and a tree fell in her mother’s bedroom 
and all across their yard. She has this 
semester off from school because of 
lack of access and expenses she cannot 
cover, even though she works. 
She told us: 
It’s overwhelming. People say why even go 
back when your school is destroyed? I start 
a new career, and that has to come to an end 
because where I work is gone now. 
There are thousands more stories 
like theirs. But amid the devastation, 
there is hope. I am inspired by those 
who rushed to help however they could. 
The Cajun Navy is an organization of 
volunteers who respond to disasters. 
They deployed immediately and con-
tinue to help today, delivering thou-
sands of meals, clearing debris, helping 
people meet energy needs, and assist-
ing where they can. 
I recently went to Central Louisiana 
to hand out supplies and meet with 
storm victims and volunteers. I met a 
woman named Mandy in Hineston. 
Mandy has been loading up trailers of 
donated groceries. She takes them to 
the rural parts of the State, where 
folks can’t access critical supplies in 
Central and Western Louisiana. This is 
a critical service because folks on the 
back roads couldn’t get out, and there 
was a gas shortage in some storm-af-
fected areas. 
While I do believe Hurricane Laura 
recovery needs more attention nation-
ally, I am so thankful for the thou-
sands of workers who came to rebuild 
the electrical grid, as well as individ-
uals and churches and nonprofits who 
came to help. There is a Facebook 
video from YAIPaks—a nonprofit orga-
nization in Clarksville, TN—who came 
down to Lake Charles with portable 
showers and trailers of supplies. The 
lady in the video said they handed out 
so many meals that they lost count. 
I cannot say thank you enough to our 
fellow Americans and those from Lou-
isiana who saw a need and answered 
the call to serve. Now I ask my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Local governments’ resources have 
been stretched to the limit because of 
COVID–19—tax base destroyed. Damage 
assessments are still underway, but we 
will likely need a disaster supple-
mental from Congress to continue the 
recovery. I ask my fellow Senators to 
consider the plight of Hurricane Laura 
victims and support such a bill, which 
should include California due to the 
terrible wildfires and perhaps those af-
fected by Sally. Our prayers are with 
all of those as well. 
Local government resources have 
been stretched to the limit because of 
COVID–19 in Louisiana, but I suspect in 
California and Alabama and Mississippi 
as well. 
In June, I introduced legislation to 
do away with the FEMA cost share for 
local governments for 2020—for this 
year—given the strain on their budgets 
caused by COVID. I urge my colleagues 
to pass this bill. 
Lastly, let’s just reassure my con-
stituents in Louisiana that they are 
not forgotten. The largest storm in our 
State’s history made news for about 2 
days with hardly a mention after. 
Don’t forget about Hannah, who lost 
her childhood home and her job, or 
about Mike, who lost his house to the 
rain and wind, and about the nearly 
150,000 people asking for help. 
Americans are at our best when we 
help those in need. The time is now to 
extend that support once more. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT ACTING 
DIRECTOR WILLIAM PENDLEY 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I want 
to start by thanking my colleague Sen-
ator UDALL for organizing us to talk 
about the current Acting Director of 
the Bureau of Land Management. I say 
‘‘acting’’ because this is an individual 
who would not be able to be confirmed 
by this body. But I want to take a step 
back and walk through a little bit 
about why this is important. 
There was once a strong young man 
who rose up through New York City so-
ciety. He led American soldiers in bat-
tle and went west to learn what it 
meant to truly to work hard on Amer-
ica’s western landscapes. 
This man took all of his hard-driving 
spirit with him to the White House and 
put it to work delivering for the Amer-
ican people. He took on big trusts and 
gigantic corporations that had monop-
olized the American economy and put a 
stranglehold on American workers. De-
spite coming from a wealthy New York 
family, this man focused on delivering 
a ‘‘Square Deal’’ to working-class 
Americans. But perhaps his most im-
portant and lasting legacy was this: 
After our country’s previous century of 
explosive growth across the North 
American continent, he saw clearly 
that we needed to rein in the pillaging 
of our forests, the draining of our wet-
lands, the destruction of America’s 
wildlife, and the loss of irreplaceable 
cultural resources. He saw that we had 
only one chance left to protect the 
splendors of our uniquely American 
landscapes for future generations. 
When Donald Trump looks up every 
once in a while from his television 
screen or from yet another tweetstorm 
portrait on his phone to the portrait of 
that great American President, I am 
sure he sometimes tells himself that he 
could be just like Teddy Roosevelt. 
I am sure he imagines that he is 
equally deserving of a place on Mount 
Rushmore and that if it weren’t for his 
bone spurs, he could have been just as 
tough as Teddy, charging up San Juan 
Hill or riding on horseback through the 
Dakota Badlands rather than jumping

September 15, 2020 
into a golf cart. These delusions of 
grandeur reached a new height last 
week, when the President told a crowd 
in Florida that he has been ‘‘the num-
ber one environmental president since 
Teddy Roosevelt.’’ 
I don’t really need to tell you that 
this claim is just about as absurd as 
saying that he has done a great job 
protecting 
Americans 
from 
the 
coronavirus that has now led to the 
deaths of nearly 200,000 of our country-
men or his claims, frankly, that he de-
serves a Nobel Peace Prize for sending 
love letters to a nuclear-armed despot 
in North Korea or making long-term 
peace in the Middle East even more out 
of reach. 
Let’s pause and take a look at what 
President Trump’s record has actually 
been on the environment. Yes, I will 
acknowledge that President Trump has 
signed some great pieces of conserva-
tion legislation that many of us here in 
the Senate worked hard to pass with 
veto-proof majorities. But since taking 
office, President Trump has also em-
powered an Army of former oil, coal, 
and timber industry lobbyists to roll 
back nearly every protection of wild-
life habitat, clean air, and clean water 
that they could get their hands on. 
He has systematically attacked cli-
mate science, setting us up for worse 
and worse natural disasters like the 
fires that we are now experiencing 
across the West. 
Just 1 year into his Presidency, Don-
ald Trump did something no President 
in the last 100 years would have ever 
thought to do. He completely erased 
national monument designation for 
treasured 
red 
rock 
landscapes 
in 
Southern Utah’s Bears Ears. By doing 
so, he also gutted key protections for 
cultural 
sites 
that 
Tribal 
nations 
across the American Southwest hold to 
be sacred. 
That egregious and, I believe, illegal 
action cut against the very heart of the 
Antiquities Act. This is the law that 
many Presidents over the last century 
used to protect so many of our national 
monuments and national parks. The 
Antiquities Act was truly Teddy Roo-
sevelt’s 
landmark 
conservation 
achievement during his Presidency. 
Rather than carry on Roosevelt’s leg-
acy, President Trump used the Antiq-
uities Act in a novel, new way. He used 
it to unprotect two national monu-
ments—Bears Ears and Grand Stair-
case-Escalante. Now over 2 million 
acres of the most paleontologically im-
portant and culturally significant sites 
in the entire Southwest are open for 
uranium mining, ATV abuse, and fossil 
fuel extraction. 
Just a few weeks ago, in a similarly 
destructive 
act, 
President 
Trump 
opened up our Nation’s marquee na-
tional wildlife refuge in the Arctic to 
industrial oil and gas drilling. It seems 
there are no landscapes that are too sa-
cred to make a quick buck in this 
White House. Not even the calving 
grounds of the porcupine caribou herd 
will have been spared. He is also now 
threatening to allow previously un-
thinkable proposals, like uranium min-
ing in the Grand Canyon. 
I don’t think anyone in their right 
mind could call that a great record of 
conservation or environmentalism, not 
by any measure. 
That takes us to why we are here 
today—President Trump’s decision to 
put William Perry Pendley in charge of 
the public lands that are the birthright 
of every American. 
We have a saying in New Mexico: 
‘‘Dime con quien andas y te dire quien 
eres.’’ Loosely translated, it means: 
‘‘Tell me who you hang around with, 
and I will tell you who you are.’’ I 
think it says a great deal that Presi-
dent Trump has chosen to hang around 
with William Perry Pendley. 
For the last 30 years, Mr. Pendley has 
been a driving force in a campaign 
fueled 
by 
anti-government 
propa-
ganda—and propped up by special in-
terests and extractive industry dol-
lars—to seize and sell off the American 
people’s public lands. 
As an industry-paid lawyer and lob-
byist, Mr. Pendley has fought against 
hunting and fishing access laws and 
supported the elimination of protec-
tions for our national monuments. In 
fact, he has championed the repeal of 
the very law that Teddy Roosevelt used 
to protect our Grand Canyon. 
He has filed numerous lawsuits in 
State and Federal courts, seeking to 
deny access to public lands for sports-
men and attacking key protections for 
wildlife, clean air, and clean water. 
Now President Trump has placed him 
in charge of the Federal agency that 
manages so many of our public lands 
across the West. This is the man who is 
on record saying that we should ‘‘sell 
all BLM lands’’ east of the Mississippi. 
President Trump handpicked this zeal-
ot to lead the agency responsible for 
stewarding those very same public 
lands. What would Teddy Roosevelt 
think? 
William 
Perry 
Pendley’s 
beliefs 
hearken back to the era right before 
Teddy Roosevelt’s Presidency, when 
railroad barons, hard rock mining oper-
ators, and timber companies were 
given free rein over our landscapes and 
our natural resources. By putting Mr. 
Pendley in charge of the Bureau of 
Land Management, President Trump is 
saying loud and clear that he wants to 
take us backward to those same failed 
and destructive policies of the past. 
I am proud that the entire Senate 
Democratic caucus joined a broad coa-
lition of hunters, fishermen, wildlife 
advocates, and outdoor recreation en-
thusiasts, all of whom called on Presi-
dent Trump to withdraw Mr. Pendley’s 
nomination. Thanks to that widespread 
outcry from those of us who love our 
public lands, President Trump was 
forced to withdraw Mr. Pendley’s nomi-
nation last month. But forcing the 
Trump administration to withdraw the 
Pendley nomination was only half the 
battle. 
In fact, William Perry Pendley is 
still sitting in his office today, leading 
the Bureau of Land Management in his 
previous ‘‘acting’’ role. 
President Trump has shown that he 
is willing to circumvent Congress and 
skip the constitutionally required con-
firmation process for other key Federal 
leadership posts by illegally placing 
people into unofficial and indefinite 
‘‘acting’’ roles. Mr. Pendley has now 
been serving in one of these ‘‘color out-
side the lines’’ acting posts for well 
over a year. 
As long as the Republican Senate 
majority refuses to act on its constitu-
tional duty to hold this administration 
accountable on nominations like this, 
Mr. Pendley and other Trump officials 
in ‘‘acting’’ roles can and will continue 
to operate with impunity. That is not 
right, and in this case, we are talking 
about someone whose whole career has 
been built on opposition to the very 
idea that public lands should remain in 
public hands. 
Mr. Pendley’s role in the Trump ad-
ministration represents a direct attack 
on Teddy Roosevelt’s legacy for our en-
vironment. The mission of public land 
management should be focused on serv-
ing the American public and safe-
guarding the values that deliver bene-
fits to the American people. 
In these times, that means that work 
by the leaders of our land management 
agency should be rooted in the con-
servation of our wildlife, our water, 
and our landscapes. Their mission 
should include expanding access to out-
door recreation, preserving biodiver-
sity, restoring healthy carbon seques-
tering forests and productive water-
sheds. They should work alongside 
Tribal nations and rural communities 
to protect cultural landscapes and pro-
mote sustainable economic develop-
ment—or as Teddy Roosevelt put it 
more simply and much more artfully 
than I could all those years ago: 
Here is your country. Cherish these nat-
ural wonders, cherish the natural resources, 
cherish the history and romance as a sacred 
heritage. . . . Do not let selfish men or 
greedy interests skin your country of its 
beauty, it is riches or its romance. 
The question before us here in the 
Senate is whether we will stand by as 
those greedy interests take what is our 
American birthright or whether we will 
stand up for our sacred heritage. 
I choose to stand up. I hope the Pre-
siding Officer and my colleagues will 
join us.

just another Presidential appointment. 
It is a sacred public trust. The Director 
of the BLM is one of the principal stew-
ards of our public lands, as we are hear-
ing from our colleagues today. 
The Bureau of Land Management 
manages 245 million acres of public 
land, more land than any other Federal 
agency. The Bureau is required by law 
to manage the lands committed to its 
care not only for the benefit of our own 
generation but for many generations to 
come. It must carefully balance the use 
of the land for grazing, timber produc-
tion, mineral development, recreation, 
fish and wildlife, and the protection of 
scenic, scientific, and historic values of 
the lands. 
In addition to the 245 million acres of 
surface land the Bureau manages, it 
also manages another 700 million acres 
of subsurface mineral rights. It man-
ages over 63,000 oil and gas wells and 
over 300 coal leases, covering nearly 
half a million acres of coal lands, 
which together contribute about $4 bil-
lion a year to the Federal Treasury. 
It manages another 55 million acres 
of timberlands and 155 million acres of 
grazing lands. It issues permits for 
wind, solar, and geothermal energy de-
velopment. In addition, more than 10 
years ago, Congress designated about 
36 million acres of the lands by the Bu-
reau as National Conservation Lands 
because of their outstanding cultural, 
ecological, and scientific value. 
National Conservation Lands include 
28 national monuments covering nearly 
8 million acres, over 260 wilderness 
areas covering nearly 10 million acres, 
nearly 3,000 miles of wild and scenic 
rivers, and nearly 6,000 miles of his-
toric and scenic trails. 
Nearly 50 years ago, Congress de-
clared that the public lands managed 
by the Bureau of Land Management 
should be retained in Federal owner-
ship and managed to preserve and to 
protect them without permanent im-
pairment of the productivity of the 
land and the quality of the environ-
ment. 
That, in a nutshell, is the job of the 
Director of the Bureau of Land Man-
agement: to be a good and faithful 
steward of the people’s lands so that we 
might pass them on to our children and 
our children’s children in at least as 
good condition as we inherited them, if 
not better. 
Mr. Pendley is not the right person 
for this job. He spent most of his adult 
life arguing against the principles upon 
which our Federal land management 
policy is based. He has called for the 
sale of the public lands that the BLM is 
responsible for retaining and man-
aging. He has called for the repeal of 
the Antiquities Act, upon which our 
national monuments were founded. 
He has denigrated the National Envi-
ronmental Policy Act, the Endangered 
Species Act, and the Clean Water Act— 
the bedrock of environmental laws that 
the Bureau must operate under. He 
cannot be a good steward of the public 
domain if he does not believe the pub-
lic should have a domain and he rejects 
the laws designed to preserve and pro-
tect it. 
His extreme views and inflammatory 
rhetoric do not stop with the public 
lands. He has denied the existence of 
climate change, comparing it to a uni-
corn, and those who acknowledge it as 
‘‘kooks.’’ He said that the Black Lives 
Matter movement is based on a lie. He 
has said that undocumented immi-
grants are ‘‘like a cancer.’’ 
Mr. Pendley was nominated for office 
once before. People might not realize 
that. President Reagan nominated him 
to be the Assistant Secretary for En-
ergy and Minerals in 1983. While his 
nomination was pending, he was being 
investigated by the Department of the 
Interior’s inspector general and the De-
partment of Justice for possibly vio-
lating conflict of interest rules. 
The Senate returned his nomination 
to the President, and he was not con-
firmed. The General Accounting Office 
later found that the Interior Depart-
ment sold the coal leases in the Powder 
River Basin at roughly $100 million less 
than their estimated fair market value. 
The below-market sales were made pos-
sible by a change in bidding procedures 
approved by Mr. Pendley on the same 
day that he had dinner with the coal 
industry lawyers. 
The inspector general referred the 
matter to the Justice Department for 
possible criminal prosecution. The Jus-
tice Department ultimately declined to 
prosecute Mr. Pendley, but he left the 
Department shortly afterward. 
For all of these reasons, I think Mr. 
Pendley is the wrong person to lead the 
Bureau of Land Management. Today, 
he is still there in the position and 
having the authority to run the BLM. 
He should not be there a minute 
longer. 
The President was right to withdraw 
his nomination. Now it would be right 
for the President to remove him from 
that position. Withdrawing his nomina-
tion doesn’t solve the problem. We 
know that. It is outrageous that he 
continues to exercise the authority of 
the Director, despite having been nomi-
nated and withdrawn for cause. 
Although the legality of his role is a 
matter of opinion in the courts right 
now, Mr. Pendley is still, in effect, run-
ning the Bureau of Land Management 
and continuing to make decisions nega-
tively impacting millions of acres of 
public lands of significant importance 
to millions of Americans, all without 
the proper vetting and approval of the 
Senate. That is simply wrong, and I be-
lieve on both sides of the aisle we know 
wrong when we see it. 
He should resign, Secretary Bern-
hardt should remove him, or the Presi-
dent should step in and remove him. 
Withdrawing his nomination was a step 
in the right direction, but for all the 
reasons I have outlined today, William 
Pendley is not qualified to be man-
aging—to be managing—our Nation’s 
treasured public lands in any capacity. 
So I would ask President Trump to 
kindly and respectfully step in and re-
move a person who does not justify the 
office that he is holding right now and 
the decisions he is making for all of us 
in our generation and in generations to 
come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, Nevada’s 
public lands are a source of pride and 
natural beauty, but they are also so 
much more. They are a source of eco-
nomic strength for our outdoor indus-
tries, and they help support our com-
munities and our State’s economy. 
Each year, tens of thousands of visi-
tors come to Nevada to see and experi-
ence our majestic public lands and our 
monuments firsthand. We must keep 
our State’s public lands open and ac-
cessible for Nevadans, for visitors to 
our State, and for future generations. 
That is why we are passionate about 
protecting and preserving our State’s 
natural wonders. 
Public lands make up a big part of 
our State. In fact, over 80 percent of 
our land is managed by the Federal 
Government, and well over 60 percent 
of Nevada—close to 48 million acres—is 
managed by the Bureau of Land Man-
agement. 
I stand here today before you because 
our Nation’s public lands are in danger, 
not just from the threat of climate 
change or from deadly wildfires, which 
are raging across our Nation’s Western 
States as we speak, but also from an 
unconfirmed and unaccountable acting 
head of the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, Mr. William Perry Pendley. It is 
well past time for him to go. Allow me 
to explain just how dangerous Mr. 
Pendley is for our public lands and for 
Nevada. 
In the past, Nevada has been able to 
strike a balance between the protec-
tion of our public lands and the need 
for development. That is how things 
should be. But Mr. Pendley does not re-
spect this balance. When it comes to 
our public lands, Mr. Pendley has a 
longtime and documented history of 
working to destroy our national treas-
ures. 
Some 
of 
the 
highlights 
of 
Mr. 
Pendley’s disturbing anti-public-land 
actions and sentiments include this: 
working on behalf of private interests 
to roll back critical public land protec-
tions during his tenure at a law firm; 
advocating for the repeal of the Antiq-
uities Act, a landmark law signed by 
President Teddy Roosevelt that pro-
tects our public lands and gives the 
President the power to designate na-
tional monuments; and fighting to drill 
on sacred Native American lands while 
mocking these same Native Americans’ 
religious beliefs. 
This is a man put in charge of one- 
third of our Nation’s public lands who 
has referred to the National Environ-
mental Policy Act, our Nation’s bed-
rock environmental law, as ‘‘a terrible 
burden,’’ who has written that ‘‘the 
Founding Fathers intended all lands

owned by the Federal Government to 
be sold,’’ who has aggressively pushed 
oil and gas leasing on our public lands, 
and who views climate change as ‘‘junk 
science.’’ 
Mr. Pendley holds shocking and ex-
tremist views and has consistently 
worked to dismantle the very lands he 
is in charge of protecting. The adminis-
tration 
knows 
just 
how 
bad 
Mr. 
Pendley is, which is why it has with-
drawn his nomination to serve as Di-
rector of the BLM. 
His nomination would never pass the 
Senate. However, it is unacceptable 
that Mr. Pendley continues to run the 
Bureau of Land Management as Acting 
BLM Director. This bureaucratic loop-
hole allows Mr. Pendley to indefinitely 
serve as the de facto head of the BLM 
without a confirmation hearing before 
the American people and in direct defi-
ance of the Senate’s constitutional re-
sponsibility to advise and consent to 
executive nominations. 
My office has heard from thousands 
of Nevadans about the importance of 
our public lands or to raise their con-
cerns about Mr. Pendley—and with 
good reason. As I said before, the Bu-
reau of Land Management oversees 67 
percent of Nevada, and if Mr. Pendley 
sells off our State’s public lands, Ne-
vadans will be the ones paying the 
price. 
I share the concerns of my constitu-
ents. Mr. Pendley was unfit to be con-
firmed as Director, and he is unfit to 
exercise the authority of the Director 
without being confirmed. For these 
reasons, this summer I joined my Sen-
ate colleagues in asking Secretary 
Bernhardt to remove Mr. Pendley from 
his unconfirmed position immediately. 
I stand here today to reiterate: Mr. 
Pendley must step down or be removed. 
I call on the President to nominate a 
qualified Director through the stand-
ard confirmation process, one who un-
derstands the balance of conservation 
and development and who has respect 
for the job that they would hold, be-
cause Nevadans can’t afford to find out 
if Mr. Pendley will put two-thirds of 
our State on the chopping block. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Colorado, Senator MICHAEL BENNET. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate very much my colleague from Ne-
vada. 
Let me start by welcoming the Pre-
siding Officer back to the Senate. We 
are glad that you are here and that you 
are feeling better. 
I thank my colleague from New Mex-
ico, my neighbor, the senior Senator 
from New Mexico, Senator UDALL, for 
organizing this today. This is, I know, 
a matter that is very close to his heart. 
Thanks 
in 
large 
part 
to 
Senator 
UDALL’s leadership and the leadership 
of the Senator from Arizona and oth-
ers, we have worked really hard to not 
have public lands be a partisan issue in 
the Senate, and I think that reflects 
the way it is out West, where our pub-
lic lands really are the foundation of 
our economy and who we are. They 
make us who we are. They are a cul-
tural touchstone for all of us in the 
West. 
Instead of comprehending this, Presi-
dent Trump, as he has done in so many 
other areas, has pursued a public lands 
agenda that is way outside the main-
stream 
of 
conventional 
American 
thought. Few decisions better capture 
how extreme that position is and how 
frenzied his agenda is than his decision 
to hire William Perry Pendley to lead 
the Bureau of Land Management. 
As we have heard today, Mr. Pendley 
doesn’t even believe in the idea of pub-
lic lands. He has argued that the 
Founding Fathers intended for all Fed-
eral lands to be sold. Think about what 
that would have meant if we had sold 
off the public lands of the United 
States. 
They are the envy of the world. They 
are the envy of the world, and all of the 
work that Teddy Roosevelt and others 
had done to make sure that our genera-
tion would be able to benefit would 
have been lost if Pendley’s constitu-
tional interpretation had controlled. 
Asking someone like that to manage 
our public lands, including 8.3 million 
acres in Colorado, is like asking some-
body to be Secretary of Education who 
doesn’t believe in public education. 
Given the track record of this adminis-
tration, I guess it is not that surprising 
that he would put somebody in charge 
of public lands who believed that they 
are actually illegal or unconstitu-
tional. 
Mr. Pendley is by far the most ex-
treme anti-public lands nominee in my 
lifetime. You have heard the Senator 
from New Mexico talk about his at-
tacks on people of color. You have 
heard about the fact that he doesn’t be-
lieve in climate change. Pendley’s ide-
ology on public lands, on climate, and 
on so many other issues doesn’t look 
anything like the consensus we have 
worked so hard to try to establish in 
Colorado. 
I think fundamental to this is that 
his extreme ideology does not perceive 
or conceive the economic reality in 
Colorado or New Mexico or Nevada or 
Arizona or Montana, where public 
lands sustain local businesses and cli-
mate change is undermining our farm-
ers and ranchers. 
Since the BLM moved to Colorado, 
sort of, we have had a front row seat to 
this extremist agenda. This spring, 
Pendley signed off on a resource man-
agement plan that opened up the North 
Fork Valley of the Gunnison—one of 
our most beautiful agricultural valleys 
in Colorado—to more oil and gas devel-
opment. 
Local leaders worried that his plan 
failed to protect the region’s watershed 
and will threaten the area’s agricul-
tural and outdoor economy. Instead of 
listening to Colorado, Mr. Pendley 
signed off on a plan, as he so often 
does, written in Washington by a bunch 
of special interests here who want to 
plunder our land out there. 
As Senators, we have a constitu-
tional responsibility to ensure that the 
people entrusted with leading our Fed-
eral agencies are, at a minimum, quali-
fied for the positions they hold and I 
would hope are within the mainstream 
of conventional American political ide-
ology, but we have not been allowed to 
do that in this case. 
Mr. Pendley was nominated by the 
President to lead the BLM. The re-
sponse was so negative that I have to 
imagine there were Senators on the 
other side of the aisle who said: Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, please don’t make us 
take this vote. Please. I have a tough 
election coming up. 
Don’t make me take this vote, Mr. 
President. I am scared to take this 
vote. 
As a result, they withdrew his nomi-
nation because it couldn’t pass the 
Senate. That is how the system is sup-
posed to work. You can always put it 
on the floor and see whether we will 
support it. In this case, the response 
was so negative, they withdrew the 
nomination. That happens regularly. 
What is incredibly unusual in this case 
is they left him in his job. Having dem-
onstrated that there was no public sup-
port in the Senate—the Senate unwill-
ing to take a vote for fear of how un-
popular it would be in the Western 
United States—they said: Well, you can 
be the Acting BLM Director. 
That is a disgrace. I don’t know how 
anybody in this Chamber could call 
themselves committed to the U.S. Con-
stitution if a President can nominate 
somebody, see the votes aren’t there, 
withdraw it, and make them the Act-
ing Director of the agency. That is the 
work of a dictator, not the President of 
the United States. 
Every now and then, you would ex-
pect the leader of this body to stand up 
for the prerogatives of this body, to 
stand up for the separation of powers 
and for the rule of law—particularly if 
you call yourself a constitutional con-
servative. 
We have a choice to make: to do 
nothing or to do our jobs. The Amer-
ican people want us to do our jobs. 
They are sick of the dysfunction here. 
From the perspective of Colorado, 
the decision on Mr. Pendley is simple: 
Someone who spent his entire career 
opposed to the very idea of public lands 
is unfit to lead a land management 
agency, period. 
He should do the right thing if the 
President won’t: Step down imme-
diately and allow somebody to take on 
the responsibility who actually under-
stands how important it is to preserve 
the legacy our parents and grand-
parents created for us so we can pre-
serve it for the next generation of 
Americans and the generation after 
that. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. UDALL. Mr. President, I very 
much appreciate the eloquent words of 
Senator BENNET of Colorado. Not only

does Senator BENNET speak with elo-
quence, but he matches it with deeds 
and with action. He has a major piece 
of legislation before the Senate to try 
to protect public lands in his State of 
Colorado. We very much appreciate 
Senator 
BENNET
and 
his 
activism 
there. 
I would also like to thank Senators 
HEINRICH, MANCHIN, and ROSEN for so 
eloquently talking about why William 
Pendley is unfit to continue as the de 
facto BLM Director. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, if I 
could just ask— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. 
Mr. UDALL. Yes, please. 
Mr. BENNET. The Senator from New 
Mexico was so kind to refer to the 
CORE 
Act, 
the 
Colorado 
Outdoor 
Recreation Economy Act. Just a re-
minder: At the heart of that bill, which 
is 400,000 acres of public lands in Colo-
rado—70,000 of which is wilderness area 
to protect our critical watershed—is 
the Camp Hale National Historic Land-
scape, which is the first such national 
historic landscape designation in the 
history of the United States. It memo-
rializes the incredible work of our vet-
erans who came to Camp Hale to train, 
to fight in the mountains of Northern 
Italy, pushed the Nazis out of Northern 
Italy. And that wasn’t even enough for 
them. Then they came back, and they 
started our entire outdoor recreation 
industry, our ski resort. It was the 
same generation of people. That is an 
exact, perfect example—I am so glad 
Senator UDALL brought it up—a perfect 
example of why we need to treasure our 
public lands. 
With that, I will yield the floor and 
turn it back over to Senator UDALL. 
Mr. UDALL. I thank Senator BENNET 
once again for the good work he is 
doing there. 
Just a couple of other words in clos-
ing, talking about the career employee 
scientists, the people who work at the 
BLM. The men and women who work at 
the BLM are public servants dedicated 
to the mission of the agency. They de-
serve a leader who values them and re-
spects them and carries out that mis-
sion, not an extremist who doesn’t 
even believe that public lands should 
exist. 
Mr. Pendley’s hostility toward our 
public lands resulted in his nomination 
as BLM Director being pulled by the 
President. If he is not fit to be con-
firmed as BLM Director by the Senate, 
he is not fit to exercise the authority 
of Director and should be immediately 
relieved of that authority. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

tion is, Will the Senate advise and con-
sent to the Holcomb nomination?

Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that, not-
withstanding the provisions of rule 
XXII, the postcloture time with respect 
to the Robinson nomination expire at 
11:30 a.m. tomorrow and that following 
the disposition of the Robinson nomi-
nation, the Senate vote on the motions 
to invoke cloture on the Dugan and 
McGlynn nominations in that order; 
further, that if cloture is invoked on 
the Dugan and McGlynn nominations, 
the postcloture time expire at 3:30 p.m. 
tomorrow and the Senate vote on con-
firmation of the nominations in that 
order; finally, that if any of the nomi-
nations are confirmed, the motions to 
reconsider be made and laid upon the 
table and the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
this morning in the Education Com-
mittee, we had a really interesting dis-
cussion on intercollegiate athletics— 
specifically on the proposals that are 
appearing in various States to pay stu-
dent athletes for their name, image, 
and likeness. 
This is the jurisdiction of the Com-
merce Committee, and Senator WICKER 
and his committee are considering 
whether there should be any congres-
sional action, but we were looking at 
the impact of the proposal to pay stu-
dent athletes on the tradition of the 
intercollegiate student athlete in our 
country, and here is my own view. 
If student athletes are paid by com-
mercial 
interests 
for 
their 
name, 
image, and likeness, that money ought 
to go to benefit all of the student ath-
letes at that institution. In other 
words, if the quarterback at the Uni-
versity of Tennessee is paid $500,000 by 
the local auto dealer to advertise the 
auto dealer, that money ought not go 
to him; it ought to go for the benefit of 
all the student athletes at the Univer-
sity of Tennessee, including the wom-
en’s sports, the men’s sports, the minor 
sports, the major sports. 
Student athletes shouldn’t be on the 
payroll and be treated as hired hands, 
in my opinion. I don’t see a good end-
ing to allowing a few student athletes 
to be paid by commercial interests 
while most of their teammates are not. 
If young athletes want to be part of a 
team, enjoy the undergraduate experi-
ence, learn from coaches who are 
among the best teachers in the coun-
try, and be paid a full scholarship that 
helps them earn a degree worth $1 mil-
lion during their lifetime—that is ac-
cording to the college boards esti-
mates—those earnings of that student 
should benefit all student athletes at 
the institution. If a student athlete 
prefers to keep the money, then that 
student athlete should become a pro-
fessional athlete. 
We had a bipartisan discussion this 
morning. I want to thank Senator 
MURRAY, the Senator from Washington 
State, who is the ranking Democrat on 
our committee. Our committee always 
has diverse views, but we always have 
good, civil discussions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5598 
September 15, 2020 
We had excellent witnesses from the 
University of Wisconsin and from Utah 
State University. We had a representa-
tive of the players association as well, 
and we had a track and field coach 
from Ohio State University who has 
been Coach of the Year in the Big 10 for 
4 years, and they all had a point of 
view on this question. 
The question is whether the tradition 
of an intercollegiate student athlete is 
worth preserving, and if so, how do you 
do it? Specifically, what would the im-
pact be on that tradition if States pass 
laws allowing commercial interests to 
pay student athletes for the use of 
their name, image, or likeness? 
Now, I have had two experiences that 
help me form my own opinion on this. 
Here is the first one. 
In 1960, during my sophomore year in 
college, I was exercising at Vanderbilt 
University on the university’s cinder 
track, and a man watching me had in 
his right hand a big stopwatch. He in-
troduced himself as Track Coach Herc 
Alley, and he asked my name. 
‘‘Did you run track in high school?’’ 
he asked me. 
‘‘No,’’ I said, ‘‘we didn’t have track in 
high school.’’ 
‘‘Why don’t you run 100 yards for 
me,’’ he said. 
So I did. 
He examined his stopwatch and said: 
‘‘10.1 seconds. That is very good. I have 
three really fast boys on my 440-yard 
relay team. Why don’t you come be the 
fourth one?’’ 
So I joined the Vanderbilt track 
team running the mile relay, the 440- 
yard relay, and the 440-yard dash. My 
job was to carry the baton from the 
first fast boy to the third fast boy. 
The next year, our team set a school 
record in the 440-yard relay. That 
record will never be broken for one rea-
son—because they now measure the 
race in meters. So they don’t run the 
440-yard relay anymore. 
We sometimes practiced with some 
really speedy athletes. They were stu-
dents from what we called then Ten-
nessee A&I across town. This is before 
desegregation. These were Olympians. 
They included Ralph Boston, Wilma 
Rudolph, and Wyomia Tyus. Coach 
Alley, our coach, had no scholarships 
to offer. His teams rode buses to meets. 
Our cinder track made it hard to estab-
lish fast times. Scraping together 
teams of nonscholarship athletes, he 
produced several Southeastern Con-
ference track champions. 
Coach Alley’s enthusiasm that day 
gave me an experience that millions of 
young Americans have had—that of 
being an intercollegiate student ath-
lete. Some of those athletes were good 
enough to win scholarships. Senator 
RICHARD BURR is one. He is on our com-
mittee and was at the hearing this 
morning. He had a football scholarship 
at Wake Forest University. 
My experience at Vanderbilt taught 
me a number of lessons, including this 
one: When running on a relay team, be 
sure to choose two teammates who can 
run faster than you can. That is not a 
bad recipe for being an effective U.S. 
Senator either. 
Now, as the college football season 
gets underway, even amidst COVID–19, 
we are reminded of how important 
these games are to student athletes, to 
their institutions, and to millions of 
spectators. The fascination with sport-
ing competition is nothing new, ac-
cording to the Knight Commission, 
which said in its 1991 report the fol-
lowing: 
The appeal of competitive games is bound-
less. In ancient times, men at war laid down 
their weapons to compete in the Olympic 
games. Today, people around the globe put 
aside their daily cares to follow the fortunes 
of their teams in the World Cup. In the 
United States, the Super Bowl, the World Se-
ries, college football and the NCAA basket-
ball tournament command the attention of 
millions. Sports have helped break down big-
otry and prejudice in American life. On the 
international scene, they have helped inte-
grate East and West, socialist and capitalist. 
The passion for sport is universally shared 
across time and continents. 
So said the Knight Commission 30 
years ago. 
But concerns with problems in sports 
are also nothing new. The Knight Com-
mission was established in 1989 to ad-
dress scandals in college sports that 
were ‘‘shaking public confidence,’’ not 
just of big-time collegiate athletics but 
the whole institution of higher edu-
cation. 
Well before that, in 1929, the Carnegie 
Foundation put out a report that said 
recruiting had become corrupt, profes-
sionals had replaced amateurs, edu-
cation was being neglected, and com-
mercialism reigned. Before that, in 
1906, partially in response to President 
Teddy Roosevelt’s criticism, the NCAA 
had been formed to protect the safety 
of players and deal with corruption. 
My second experience forming my 
opinion on today’s hearing was my par-
ticipation and membership in that 
Knight Commission at the time I was 
president of the University of Ten-
nessee. Our commission recommenda-
tion was that university presidents 
take charge of college athletics and the 
huge amount of television money it at-
tracted and restore the academic and 
financial integrity of the program. As a 
result, over the next several years, aca-
demic standards became more strin-
gent, financial support for student ath-
letes increased, and college presidents 
asserted more responsibility for finan-
cial integrity. 
What is especially relevant to today’s 
hearing was that despite today’s prob-
lems surrounding intercollegiate ath-
letics and the problems then, the 
Knight Commission strongly endorsed 
keeping the student athlete tradition. 
What it said is worth repeating also: 
We reject the argument [the Knight Com-
mission said] that the only realistic solution 
to the problem is to drop the student athlete 
concept, put athletes on the payroll, and re-
duce or even eliminate their responsibilities 
as students. 
Such a scheme has nothing to do with edu-
cation, [said the Knight Commission] the 
purpose for which colleges and universities 
exist. Scholarship athletes are already paid 
in the most meaningful way possible: with a 
free education. The idea of intercollegiate 
athletics is that teams represent their insti-
tutions as true members of the student body, 
not as hired hands. Surely American higher 
education has the ability to devise a better 
solution to the problems of intercollegiate 
athletics than making professionals out of 
the players, which is no solution at all but 
rather an unacceptable surrender to despair. 
Well, I hope those words from the 
Knight Commission 30 years ago will 
guide how Congress deals with the new-
est issue threatening the concept of 
student athletes, and that is allowing 
commercial interests to pay athletes 
for use of their name, likeness, and 
image. 
Already four States have enacted 
laws sanctioning such payments in var-
ious forms. More than 30 other States 
are considering legislation. 
Senator WICKER, as I mentioned, 
chairman of the Commerce Committee, 
is considering whether there ought to 
be congressional action. Our purpose 
was to look at the impact on the stu-
dent athlete. 
Who are the student athletes today? 
Well, it wouldn’t make much sense to 
talk about this if we didn’t say who 
and what we are talking about, so here 
it is. There are 20 million undergradu-
ates in about 6,000 colleges and univer-
sities that exist in the United States 
today. Nearly 1,100 of those 6,000 col-
leges and universities belong to the 
NCAA. More than 460,000 young men 
and women participate in 24 different 
sports each year in about one-quarter 
of 1 million contests. About 300 of 
those institutions play football and 
basketball at the highest level. Fewer 
than 2 percent of athletes, student ath-
letes, go on to play professional sports, 
according to the NCAA. This means we 
are talking about approximately 9,000 
college student athletes who compete 
in a few sports out of the more than 
460,000 college athletes across 24 sports. 
So the current controversy is about 
an even smaller percentage of those 
9,000 students who play football, base-
ball, or men or women’s basketball and 
whose skills—or the institutions for 
which they play—make them attrac-
tive targets for recruiting offers that 
will combine their scholarship dollars 
with endorsement money. For example, 
an exceptional quarterback, pitcher, or 
running 
back 
might 
be 
offered 
a 
$500,000-a-year endorsement by a car 
dealer in the same town as a college 
with a big-time football, basketball, or 
even baseball program. 
As the Knight Commission report 
said, student athletes are already paid 
in the most meaningful way, with a 
free education. Athletic scholarships 
are limited to tuition and fees, room 
and board, and required course-related 
books, but this can add up to a lot of 
money. It is $115,000 a year, estimates 
the University of Tennessee, per stu-
dent athlete, including room, board, 
student stipends, academic support, 
meals, sports medicine, training, trav-
el, and expenses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5599 
September 15, 2020 
Student athletes may also combine 
other sources of financial aid, includ-
ing Federal or State need-based aid, to 
help pay for the full cost of attendance. 
These include Pell grants, for example, 
which could be $6,300 a year, supple-
mental education community grants, 
work-study, State grants based on need 
using Federal calculations, such as the 
Tennessee HOPE Scholarship or the GI 
bill. About 92,000—or 20 percent—of the 
student athletes receive Pell grants 
also. 
According to the College Board, the 
value of a 4-year undergraduate degree 
is $1 million over a lifetime, and ac-
cording to the NCAA, 88 percent of Di-
vision I student athletes will earn a 4- 
year degree. 
So the question at hand is, Should 
Congress act, or should varying State 
laws govern payments for name, image, 
and likeness to student athletes? Is a 
patchwork set of regulations worth the 
confusion it will cause with unre-
strained boosters, creative agents, the 
impact on title IX on men’s and wom-
en’s programs, on a coach’s effort, and 
most of all on the tradition of the stu-
dent athlete? That is the Commerce 
Committee’s job. We heard some inter-
esting testimony this morning. 
Based on my experience as a student 
athlete, as a member of the Knight 
Commission, and as a university presi-
dent, I offered these suggestions: 
The Knight Commission is correct to 
say that student athletes shouldn’t be 
on the payroll. They shouldn’t be 
treated as hired hands. 
Two, Congress should act but in a 
limited way—as limited as possible—to 
authorize an independent entity, safe 
from litigation, to write rules gov-
erning payments for the use of name, 
image, and likeness. Congress should 
provide aggressive oversight of that en-
tity rather than try to write the rules 
ourselves. 
Three, that governing entity ought 
to be the NCAA. I know, I know—the 
NCAA is controversial, but if it is not 
doing its job, the presidents who are 
supposed to be in charge of it should 
reform it. Giving the job to a new enti-
ty would take forever. Giving it to an 
existing entity like the Federal Trade 
Commission, without expertise and 
without any responsibility for higher 
education, would make no sense. 
Now, as to the rules that I would 
hope the NCAA would write, here is 
what I believe should be the overriding 
principle: Money paid to student ath-
letes for their name, image, and like-
ness should benefit all student athletes 
in that institution. Following this 
principle would allow the earnings to 
be used for additional academic sup-
port, further study or degrees, more in-
surance options, and more support for 
injured players and other needs. It 
would avoid the awkwardness of a cen-
ter who earns nothing snapping the 
ball 
to 
a 
quarterback 
who 
earns 
$500,000 from the local auto dealer. It 
avoids the inevitable abuses that would 
occur with agents and boosters becom-
ing involved with outstanding high 
school athletes. It would avoid the un-
expected consequences to other teams 
in an institution because of the impact 
on title IX or the impact on existing 
student aid available to athletes. 
Such a principle would preserve the 
right of any athlete to earn money for 
the use of his or her image, name, or 
likeness. It simply says: If you elect to 
be a student athlete, your earnings 
should benefit all student athletes at 
your institution. If you want to keep 
the money and be someone’s employee, 
go become a professional. 
This system would create the same 
kinds of choices that today’s NCAA 
rules for college baseball require. A 
high school student must stay 3 years 
if he chooses to participate in a college 
baseball program. Take Vanderbilt’s 
baseball program. David Price, Sonny 
Gray, 
and 
Dansby 
Swanson—Major 
League fans know they are all very 
successful 
professional 
athletes—all 
were drafted by Major League baseball 
teams while they were in high school. 
They could have earned a lot of money 
going directly into professional base-
ball. Instead, they chose a Vanderbilt 
education, 3 years of college experi-
ence, and the opportunity to be taught 
by Coach Tim Corbin, a great teacher. 
If Price, Gray, and Swanson had been 
permitted to sell their name, image, 
and likeness while at Vanderbilt, under 
the principle I am suggesting, their 
earnings would have been used for the 
benefit of all of Vanderbilt’s sports 
teams, men and women. 
Applying such a principle to all 
intercollegiate athletics might cause a 
few talented athletes to join profes-
sional leagues immediately after high 
school. That is their right. But if that 
young athlete prefers the college expe-
rience, the expert coaching and teach-
ing, the free education, the other aca-
demic support, and the undergraduate 
degree that can earn $1 million over a 
lifetime, then their earnings ought to 
benefit all the student athletes at the 
institution. 
While the NCAA is making new rules, 
I suggest it ought to assign most of the 
new television revenue that comes to 
institutions—let it go to institutions 
and be used for academic support for 
student athletes rather than continue 
to encourage inordinately high salaries 
for some coaches. 
As I said at the beginning, I don’t see 
a good ending to allowing a few student 
athletes to be paid by commercial in-
terests while most of their teammates 
are not. If they want to be part of the 
team, enjoy the undergraduate experi-
ence, learn from coaches who are great 
teachers, and be paid a full scholarship 
that could help them earn $1 million 
during their lifetimes, their earnings 
should benefit all the student athletes. 
If they prefer to keep the money for 
themselves, let them become profes-
sionals. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I begin by asking that the 
RECORD reflect how much I am going to 
miss the Senator from Tennessee when 
he is gone at the end of this year. It is 
nice to be on the floor with him. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Madam President, I am here for the 
271st time to call this Chamber’s atten-
tion to climate change and to two of 
the reports on this defining issue of our 
generation. 
As I speak, wildfires are devouring 
the American West and consuming 
American lives: east of Salem, OR, two 
people dead in a scorched vehicle; in 
Butte County, CA, three dead, overrun 
by a fast-moving fire; in Ashland, a 1- 
year-old boy; in Malden, WA, almost 
the entire town burned down; half a 
million Oregonians evacuated due to 
fire. That is 1 out of 10 people in the 
entire State. 
Over the weekend, Oregon’s emer-
gency management director said they 
are preparing for a ‘‘mass fatality 
event.’’ 
Paradise, CA, suffered apocalyptic 
destruction in the 2018 Camp Fire. It is, 
once again, under fire warnings, this 
time the North Complex fire, which has 
stunned firefighters with its rapid 
growth and ferocity. 
We cannot avoid it. Climate change 
is here. Plenty of factors contribute to 
individual 
wildfires, 
but 
climate 
change is now always among them. 
Last fall, I went out to the National 
Center for Atmospheric Research in 
Colorado and met leading wildfire re-
searcher Daniel Swain. As Dr. Swain 
puts it: 
Climate change has not just made the ex-
treme heat waves that coincide with fires 
worse. The bigger effect is the more subtle, 
long-term warming. That couple of degrees 
of (average) warming over decades . . . it’s 
lurking in the background, sucking extra 
moisture out of the vegetation and the soil. 
The new normal is smoke, ash, or-
ange skies, and constant nerve-fraying 
vigilance. 
Climate change’s impacts through 
the 
West 
land 
crushing 
economic 
blows. The 2018 Camp Fire that burned 
Paradise cost $16.7 billion. NOAA says 
natural disasters—mostly hurricanes 
and wildfires, both highly climate-re-
lated—inflicted $91 billion worth of 
damage that year, 2018; and over the 
past 40 years, 241 climate- and weather- 
related disasters have cost Americans 
$1.6 trillion. 
The first report I want to talk about 
warns that it is not just what is lost in 
floods and flames. As climate risk 
worsens, the harder it is for commu-
nities to rebuild, for bankers to write 
mortgages, for owners to find insurers 
willing to continue to write policies 
and pay out claims. That risk spreads 
beyond burned or flooded land and runs 
through the rest of the economy. 
Climate risk becomes what econo-
mists call systemic risk. So one of our 
leading regulatory agencies, the Com-
modity Futures Trading Commission, 
has done a report on risk.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5600 
September 15, 2020 
Think of the 2008 financial crisis. 
That home mortgage problem spread 
far beyond mortgage lenders into a 
brutal global recession. Millions of peo-
ple who had no connection to a bad 
mortgage lost their jobs, lost their 
homes, or lost their retirement sav-
ings. Many are still recovering from 
that collapse. 
Now think even worse. The Stanford 
Business School’s Corporations and So-
ciety Initiative believes ‘‘the financial 
risks from climate change are sys-
temic’’—there is that economic word 
again—that these risks are ‘‘singular 
in nature’’; and that ‘‘[g]lobal eco-
nomic losses from climate change 
could reach $23 trillion—three or four 
times the scale of the 2008 Financial 
Crisis.’’ 
Those of us who were here for the 
2008 financial crisis don’t want to see 
that happen again, and we certainly 
don’t want to see it happen at a three- 
or four-times scale. 
Senator SCHATZ and I have been call-
ing for financial regulators to do a bet-
ter job accounting for these risks. In 
May, we wrote to the Commodity Fu-
tures 
Trading 
Commission 
Sub-
committee on Climate-Related Market 
Risk. We had two simple requests: One, 
recommend a carbon price, and, two, 
urge our financial regulators to include 
climate risks in their core market risk 
assessments and supervisory practices. 
The CFTC Subcommittee report is 
out, and I am happy to report that they 
did both. They write: ‘‘Financial mar-
kets will only be able to channel re-
sources efficiently to activities that re-
duce greenhouse gas emissions if an 
economy-wide price on carbon is in 
place at a level that reflects the true 
social cost of those emissions.’’ That is 
actually kind of economics 101, but it 
is good to hear them say it. 
They went on to say: 
Climate change poses a major risk to the 
stability of the U.S. financial system and to 
its ability to sustain the American economy. 
. . . U.S. financial regulators must recognize 
that climate change poses serious emerging 
risks to the U.S. financial system, and they 
should move urgently and decisively to 
measure, understand, and address these 
risks. 
And what if we don’t? Well, the CFTC 
report goes on: Failing to act would 
lead to what they called ‘‘disorderly re-
pricing of assets’’—that is commonly 
known as a crash—‘‘with cascading ef-
fects’’ through the economy. Put sim-
ply, do nothing and trigger financial 
chaos far and wide, just like 2008, ex-
cept probably worse. 
The CFTC report calls for corporate 
America to tell the truth about cli-
mate-related risks to their business 
models. Investors need to know the 
truth for the free market to operate. 
The subcommittee writes that we must 
require ‘‘disclosure by corporations of 
information on material, climate-re-
lated financial risks . . . to ensure that 
climate risks are measured and man-
aged effectively.’’ 
That is a key point. We have seen 
Exxon, for instance, downplay climate 
risks to investors, shareholders, and 
the general public. That mischief will 
stop if financial regulators require an 
honest accounting of climate-related 
risks. 
The CFTC report is a big deal, but it 
requires Congress to act. America is 
among the few industrialized nations 
worst prepared for wide-ranging reduc-
tions in greenhouse gas emissions. Reg-
ulators will not be enough; Congress 
must act. 
That is where another report comes 
in, the Senate Democrats’ Special Re-
port on the Climate Crisis. Under 
Chairman SCHATZ’s leadership, we re-
cently released a roadmap for fixing 
that problem. We propose a plan to cut 
emissions across our economy, to get 
on course to limit warming to 1.5 de-
grees Celsius, to create a host of well- 
paying jobs in clean energy and other 
emerging technologies, and to remedy 
the burdens of pollution across all sec-
tors of the economy, including those 
usually overlooked. 
We know we have a battle ahead. The 
fossil fuel industry runs a covert oper-
ation that has blocked progress in Con-
gress. This covert op is extremely well 
funded and has reached its roots deeply 
into our politics. We need to tear up 
those roots. This is how. 
First, our report tells the dark story 
of that covert op: the story of the fossil 
fuel industry apparatus built to ob-
scure 
the 
industry’s 
hands 
behind 
phony front groups, the story of cap-
ture and control of corporate trade as-
sociations, the story of lives marketed 
by flashy PR firms, and the story of 
brute-force 
political 
spending 
and 
threats to blockade climate progress. 
Those tactics were a test run for the 
fossil fuel industry by Big Tobacco: 
Manufacture false doubt in science and 
flex your political muscle against any-
one who dares to challenge you. That 
bullying worked pretty well, and then 
when the Supreme Court handed down 
Citizens United, the fossil fuel industry 
supercharged its covert campaign with 
dark money, almost immediately turn-
ing the ability to spend unlimited 
money in politics into spending unlim-
ited dark money in politics. Then the 
bullying worked really well. 
Citizens United was a climate water-
shed. After that decision unleashed its 
fearful weaponry, not one Republican 
in this body joined any comprehensive 
bill to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. 
The Senate heartbeat of bipartisan cli-
mate activity before Citizens United, 
which I remember and experienced in 
2007, 2008, and 2009, all flat-lined under 
the supercharged political pressure un-
leashed by fossil fuel interests with 
Citizens United behind them. 
Our Senate report tells the full rot-
ten story because that is step 1 in 
fighting covert influence. Follow the 
money. Show the American people how 
corporate 
interests 
pay 
to 
block 
progress on climate. Show the co-opted 
trade associations and the phony front 
groups. Let the American people see 
the scheme, and they are less likely to 
fall for it. 
Second is cleaning it up. Fully expos-
ing and ending Citizens United dark 
money and the fossil fuel scheme will 
take reform. Bold transparency meas-
ures like the DISCLOSE Act are need-
ed, and our report calls for that. 
Then, we need to wake up the so- 
called good guys in corporate America. 
They need to see the mischief a few bad 
actors have perpetrated right under 
their noses. They need to see how the 
fossil 
fuel 
industry 
commandeered 
their corporate trade associations, like 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which 
is one of the two most obstructive or-
ganizations against climate action. 
Why would the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, with its wide corporate mem-
bership, be one of the two most ob-
structive organizations against climate 
action unless the fossil fuel industry 
had co-opted it right under their noses? 
The so-called good guys need to ex-
amine how their own lobbyists and 
their own trade associations and their 
own political operatives are doing on 
climate because with very few and very 
rare exceptions, the answer is that 
they are doing nothing on climate, not 
lifting a finger in Congress. 
Just last week, the giant tech compa-
nies came in through their trade group 
TechNet, with a 13-page list of all of 
their lobbying priorities—13 pages and 
not a mention of climate. Google, 
Apple, Microsoft, Facebook—the Big 
Tech barons—a lot of big talk, and 
they never even mentioned climate in 
their shopping list for Congress. 
Everyone needs to understand the 
two faces of corporate America and to 
imagine how quickly Congress would 
act if powerful trade associations like 
the chamber became actual advocates 
for serious climate policies or if the big 
interests in Congress, like Big Ag, or 
Big Tech, or Wall Street, or the insur-
ance industry actually took an interest 
in something more than their own spe-
cial interest programs and tax benefits. 
What if climate had been on Big 
Tech’s list of priorities, perhaps even 
on page 1 of 13? That would change the 
game. 
A 16th century alchemist by the 
name of Paracelsus is credited with the 
phrase ‘‘sola dosis facit venenum,’’ 
Latin for ‘‘the dose makes the poison.’’ 
The dose makes the poison. The idea is 
that everything from a nerve agent to 
the water we need to drink to survive 
can be lethal if delivered in sufficient 
dosage. 
Right now, in the American West, 
toxins in the climate wildfire smoke 
waft in such high concentrations that 
our typical measurement systems fail. 
The dosage is literally off the charts. 
In our Earth’s atmosphere, the dosage 
of carbon dioxide is way outside the 
range of human experience, putting all 
of mankind into uncharted territory, 
to face unprecedented dangers. 
Citizens United unleashed toxic doses 
of money, unprecedented doses of viru-
lent dark money, into our American

political atmosphere. So our democ-
racy is poisoned, stunned by secret fos-
sil fuel money and threats, and, con-
sequently, failing to listen to plain 
warnings like those of the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission. 
We had better act before the poison 
has overpowered us, and we had better 
get the dosages back to safe and nor-
mal levels. One good start would be to 
wake up to the reality of climate 
change. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
TRIBUTE TO COLONEL SCOTT GRANT 
Mr. JONES. Madam President, one of 
the great privileges that I have enjoyed 
as a U.S. Senator and a member of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee has 
been the opportunity to get to know 
and support our men and women in 
uniform. I have been proud to represent 
the people of the great State of Ala-
bama, a State where patriotism runs 
deep and for whom service is a way of 
life. 
Col. Scott Grant, U.S. Air Force, is a 
perfect example. Colonel Grant retired 
this summer, and since I was not able 
to attend his retirement ceremony this 
past Saturday, I decided I would say 
here what I wanted to say there, in the 
hangar in Birmingham, AL, where he 
had spent the last few years of his ca-
reer. 
Colonel Grant retired as the com-
mander of the 117th Air Refueling 
Wing, Alabama Air National Guard, 
Sumpter Smith Joint National Guard 
Base in Birmingham, AL. 
The 117th was the first military in-
stallation that I visited after my elec-
tion in 2017 and swearing-in, in Janu-
ary of 2018. I can tell you, at that first 
visit, Colonel Grant set a pretty high 
bar for the future visits I would have to 
the many other military installations 
in Alabama, and we have quite a few. 
He set a high bar for those I would 
meet later because of his dedication to 
his unit, to his mission, and to the men 
and women he commanded. 
It was immediately apparent—his 
dedication and professionalism—and it 
has guided his every decision in all our 
interactions over the next 21⁄2 years. 
Scott’s unwavering commitment to ex-
cellence earned him the respect of all 
those who served with him, but his 
genuine love for the men and women 
who served under his command earned 
him their affection. In other words, 
Col. Scott Grant had and has his prior-
ities in order, and everyone who knew 
him and met him could see that imme-
diately. 
In 2019, the 117th won STRATCOM’s 
Omaha Trophy. The Omaha Trophy is 
one of the most prestigious awards in 
the military. It was the first time that 
an Air National Guard unit had re-
ceived this prestigious award. Then 
STRATCOM Commander Gen. John 
Hyten said: ‘‘The Omaha Trophy rep-
resents the best of the best in units 
executing strategic deterrence.’’ 
The 117th won in the area of strategic 
aircraft 
for 
their 
many 
missions 
around the world protecting America. 
It was an award that the unit and Colo-
nel Grant richly deserved. I was really 
honored to be present at that awards 
ceremony, and I can remember, as 
Brigadier General Stevenson said: ‘‘To 
put it simply, the 117th Air Refueling 
Wing was the most outstanding in 
their Nuclear Operational Readiness 
Inspection and their dedication to the 
mission itself. As a traditional guard 
unit, but with a total force, they have 
accomplished unique tasks and in an 
innovative way that we absolutely 
need to meet future challenges that 
STRATCOM faces.’’ True to form, in 
his acceptance speech, Scott gave the 
credit to the men and women in his 
command. 
With 7,000 military flight hours, 
Scott’s deployments have spanned the 
globe, and his awards and decorations 
are almost too numerous to list. Here 
are just a few: the Defense Meritorious 
Service Medal, the Meritorious Service 
Medal with two oakleaf clusters, Air 
Medal with seven oakleaf clusters, Aer-
ial 
Achievement 
Medal 
with 
two 
oakleaf 
clusters, 
Air 
Force 
Out-
standing Unit Award with Valor and 
two oakleaf clusters, Combat Readi-
ness Medal with 10 oakleaf clusters, 
National Defense Service Medal with 
one Bronze Star, the Southwest Asia 
Service Medal with three Bronze Stars, 
the Kosovo Campaign Medal with one 
Bronze Star, the Afghanistan Cam-
paign Medal with one Bronze Star, the 
Iraq Campaign Medal with one Bronze 
Star, the Humanitarian Service Medal, 
the 
Alabama 
National

Service Medal and Service Medal with

We could be here all night, but I will 
stop there and just say that, rated as a 
command pilot and an instructor, Colo-
nel Grant has been described as a pi-
lot’s pilot, one from whom you learn 
something every time you fly with 
him. 
So it is good news for the Air Force. 
The good-news-bad-news story: The bad 
news is the retirement from the 117th, 
but the good news is, in his retirement, 
Colonel Grant is going to continue 
training airmen on the KC–135 simula-
tors in Oklahoma. 
Scott, you have served your country 
with honor and distinction, and you are 
a credit to the State of Alabama and 
the United States of America. It is my 
great honor to call you a friend. Thank 
you. 
Congratulations on an outstanding 
career. Best wishes for clear skies in 
retirement, and although I did not 
serve in the military, I salute you, sir. 
REMEMBERING ROBERT EDINGTON 
Madam President, just a few weeks 
ago Alabama lost one of its most dis-
tinguished and dedicated citizens, and I 
lost a great friend. Robert Edington, of 
Mobile, AL, died peacefully on July 26 
with his beloved wife of 58 years, Patri-
cia, at his side. I rise today to honor 
the life and legacy of this patriot; this 
public servant; this devoted husband, 
father, grandfather, and friend. 
Robert was born in Mobile on Novem-
ber 18, 1929, and Mobile remained in his 
blood until the day he died. The son of 
a local judge, Robert earned his under-
graduate degree at Rhodes College but 
came back home for his law degree at 
the University of Alabama. 
He served our Nation in the military 
while on Active Duty with the U.S. 
Navy from 1951 to 1955. During his ac-
tive military career as a Navy oper-
ations officer, Robert was awarded the 
Korean Service Medal with two battle 
stars, the China Service Medal, the 
United Nations Service Medal, and the 
Korean Presidential Unit Citation. 
Robert truly loved his service to this 
country and the U.S. Navy, prompting 
him to remain with the Navy Active 
Reserve until 1980, when he retired as 
commander. 
Robert Edington was one of Mobile’s 
most prominent lawyers and commu-
nity leaders for over 60 years. He 
served three terms in the Alabama 
Legislature, first as a State representa-
tive from 1962 to 1970 and then in the 
State senate from 1970 to 1974. 
As a member of the Alabama Legisla-
ture, he played a pivotal role in estab-
lishing the University of South Ala-
bama and the university’s college of 
medicine. He actively furthered the de-
velopment of Bishop State Community 
College, one of Alabama’s great his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities, of which I am so proud. 
The National Trust for Historic Pres-
ervation in Washington, DC, presented 
him with their national award for his 
role in establishing the Alabama His-
torical Commission. 
But his love for the Navy continued 
on prominent display even as a legis-
lator, authoring the legislation that 
created the USS Alabama Battleship 
Commission, bringing the USS Alabama 
home to Mobile following her retire-
ment from Active Duty. He served on 
that commission from 1963 to 1972 and 
served as its chairman, but his passion 
for the battleship and all it stands for 
never wavered, and he was once again 
appointed to the battleship commission 
in the year 2000. 
In addition, Robert served as the Ala-
bama President and National Director 
of the Navy League of the United 
States, where he supported port visits 
of Navy vessels for important occasions 
that included some just fun occasions 
like the Mardi Gras in Mobile. 
Back in his hometown of Mobile, 
Robert was an active member of the 
Mobile Bar Association, where at one 
time he served as the director of the 
bar’s Volunteer Lawyers Program. He 
was a member of the Mobile Kiwanis 
Club and the Mobile American Legion. 
As Mobile’s Consul to Guatemala for 
20 years, Robert organized Mobile’s 
first trade mission to Central America, 
earning him the U.S. Department of 
Commerce’s Achievement Award. 
In 2007, Robert’s dedication to the 
community and the city of Mobile was

recognized 
when 
he 
received 
the 
Mobilian of the Year Award. In 2008, 
the following year, he was named the 
Rhodes College Alumnus of the Year, 
and in 2012, he received the distin-
guished honor of being named the Mo-
bile Area Veteran of the Year. 
When I think of Robert’s great ac-
complishments, of all of those that we 
have talked about and listed, he will 
tell you that his greatest honor was 
marrying the love of his life, Patricia, 
in 1962 and having son Sherard, daugh-
ter Virginia, and a granddaughter, 
Courtney. With all that Robert was in-
volved in, he was first and foremost a 
family man. 
I have been blessed to have Robert 
and Pat Edington as great and dear 
friends for many, many years. To-
gether, we have toiled in the vineyards 
of Alabama politics for longer than we 
can all remember. Robert, at one time, 
even had his eyes on the U.S. Senate 
seat. But as devoted as Robert was to 
the Democratic Party, he was also a 
man committed to the greater good, to 
working with anyone to make Mobile, 
AL, make the State of Alabama, and 
make America a better place for every-
one, leaving a legacy of dedication and 
commitment to love of God, love of 
country, love of community, and love 
of family that is an extraordinary ex-
ample for others to follow. 
Our world, especially in today’s cli-
mate, needs more Robert Edingtons. 
RACISM 
Madam President, 57 years ago today, 
a bomb exploded outside a church in 
Birmingham, AL. A bomb was placed 
underneath the steps that led to the 
sanctuary of the 16th Street Baptist 
Church. 
Four young girls were killed in that 
blast: Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wes-
ley, Denise McNair, and Carole Robert-
son—killed senselessly simply because 
of the color of their skin. It was a 
tough time in America; it was a tough 
time in Alabama. 
I am not going to recount all of what 
happened at that time. Many of you 
have heard me speak on it before be-
cause it was in 2001 and 2002 that we 
put the final two perpetrators into 
prison. 
What I have spoken about this sum-
mer, though, is how 1963 and 2020 seem 
to align. The year 1963 in Birmingham 
started off with police brutality, where 
peaceful demonstrators who were sim-
ply trying to get civil rights for Afri-
can-American people in this country 
were accosted with fire hoses and dogs 
set upon them by the police commis-
sioner ‘‘Bull’’ Connor. 
People took notice. People took no-
tice when George Wallace stood at the 
schoolhouse door in June of 1963. Peo-
ple took notice when Medgar Evers was 
killed that same night. People took no-
tice when Martin Luther King stood on 
the Mall in Washington, DC, and said 
he had a dream—he had a dream that 
one day we would all live in peace and 
harmony together. It was a dream of 
hope at that time. It was about a 
month later when that bomb exploded 
and destroyed the dream for so many 
people, but at the same time, that 
bomb woke the conscience of America. 
The horrors of Jim Crow and segrega-
tion came home to roost, came down to 
television sets across this country, and 
people stood up and made their voices 
known and said enough is enough—not 
just for Birmingham in the South, but 
enough is enough in this country. 
We have to make the changes. It 
woke that conscience of this country, 
but it also woke a conscience of a 
President who began to work on the 
Civil Rights Act. It woke the con-
science of a Congress that later passed 
the Civil Rights Act in 1964. The con-
science was aroused again in 1965 when 
our friend John Lewis was beaten at 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
The similarities between that and 
today are striking. We cannot overlook 
the historic moment we are in today, 
when once again our conscience is get-
ting the best of us, and we see the im-
ages of George Floyd and Breonna Tay-
lor and Ahmaud Arbery and Jacob 
Blake. 
We also see something else. We see 
the images of violence. We see looting. 
We see the images of two police officers 
in Los Angeles who were brutally—bru-
tally—attacked while just sitting in 
their car. 
What we are seeing is really some-
thing that America is not about. It is 
incumbent upon us all to do something 
about it—to stand together, to have 
the discussion, to have the dialogue, to 
have the frank discussions about what 
we know is going on in law enforce-
ment but also the violence we see in 
the streets. It has to stop. We have to 
make sure that we talk to each other, 
to have these dialogues. 
I have talked about this before, and I 
will not go on and on tonight, but it is 
weighing heavily on everyone in this 
country. I know it. You know it. It is 
weighing on everyone. For everyone in 
this country, as we approach the elec-
tion, it weighs heavier and heavier. Un-
fortunately, it gets into political dis-
cussions and partisan divides on both 
sides of the aisle. We cannot let that 
happen. 
We have to come together. We have 
to do what John Lewis talked about 
and make sure that love conquers hate, 
however we can do it. 
In that regard, I want to display this 
photograph. It was taken on the morn-
ing of the bombing in Birmingham. It 
is of an incredible stained glass window 
in the church. If you look closely, you 
will see that the most significant dam-
age is the face of Christ that was blown 
out. 
That picture had such an emotional 
impact on people in Birmingham and 
around the world. To this day, when 
people see it, it has an emotional im-
pact because it is as if God simply can-
not look at what his children are doing 
to his children. 
We need to remember our faith. We 
need to remember who we are as a 
country. We need to remember an 
image like this. No matter what faith 
you might believe or even if you don’t 
have a faith, you need to remember 
this photograph where this stained 
glass window—the image of Christ— 
cannot bear to see what is going on. I 
suspect that in today’s world, that 
image may be replicated somewhere 
beyond what we can touch. 
I yield the floor.

ABRAHAM ACCORDS 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, ear-
lier today at the White House, Presi-
dent Trump hosted Israeli Prime Min-
ister Benjamin Netanyahu and the For-
eign Ministers from the United Arab 
Emirates and Bahrain to sign the Abra-
ham Accords. 
These historic agreements began the 
process of normalizing relationships 
between the two Gulf countries and the 
Jewish state. After seven decades of 
isolation in the region, the Abraham 
Accords signify Israel’s existence is fi-
nally being accepted by Arab countries, 
opening new prospects for greater eco-
nomic, security, and cultural coopera-
tion that will benefit all—those in the 
region and all of us around the world. 
I commend President Trump, Sec-
retary Pompeo, and many others in 
this administration for facilitating this 
historic agreement and advancing the 
cause of peace and prosperity in the re-
gion. This came to many of us as a sur-
prise, but it is a welcome surprise. I am 
very pleased at this development. 
Over the past several years, the 
President and Secretary have cul-
tivated relationships in Jerusalem, 
Abu Dhabi, and Manama. And for 
longer than that, Israel and Arab coun-
tries have cooperated on important 
matters but behind closed doors. Cap-
italizing on a changing Middle East, 
President Trump and his administra-
tion helped shepherd these relation-
ships into the open. 
Today’s signing is just a beginning 
for the three countries and the region 
as a whole. More work, obviously, is to 
be done, and no agreement can be eas-
ily accomplished. But my hope is that 
more Arab countries will follow the 
path of publicly recognizing Israel. 
Eighteen Arab states have yet to make 
this move, preventing relationships 
that can benefit the entire region. 
Israel’s right to exist is unquestion-
able, and to refuse to recognize this is 
to deny reality. I, along with so many 
other Members of this Chamber, have 
worked to ensure Israel’s security and 
prosperity. With more days like today, 
we can hope for a region that is secure 
and prosperous as well for all. 
I use this opportunity to commend 
this accomplishment, and I hope that 
we are able to bring more peace and 
stability to this region and to the rest 
of the world. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR 
THOMAS P. PAYNE 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
South 
Carolina. 
Madam President, today I would like 
to take a moment to recognize and 
honor 
SGM 
Thomas 
P. 
Payne 
of 
Batesburg-Leesville and Lugoff. Just 
last week, on September 11, the 19th 
anniversary of the painful attacks on 
American soil, Sergeant Major Payne 
received the Medal of Honor, the coun-
try’s highest recognition of military 
bravery for his outstanding efforts to 
liberate dozens of hostages from ISIS 
captors during a rescue mission in Iraq. 
In his 18-year career in the Army, 
Sergeant Major Payne has deployed 17 
times in support of Operation Enduring 
Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Op-
eration New Dawn, and Operation In-
herent Resolve and to the U.S. Africa 
Command area of responsibility. 
Thomas ‘‘Patrick’’ Payne enlisted in 
the U.S. Army shortly after graduating 
from Batesburg-Leesville High School 
in 2002, and 13 years later, his efforts 
have saved the lives of many. He holds 
several awards and decorations includ-
ing the Medal of Honor, Bronze Star 
Medal with bronze ‘‘V’’ device, and 
three bronze oakleaf clusters, the Pur-
ple Heart, and many, many more. 
Sergeant Major Payne is currently 
serving as an instructor assigned to the 
U.S. Army Special Operations Com-
mand and is stationed at Fort Bragg, 
NC. I want to thank Sergeant Major 
Payne for his service; South Carolina is 
very proud to have such a brave hero. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT CHASEN 
BROWN 
Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I 
rise to recognize Sergeant Chasen 
Brown for his selfless demonstration of 
bravery while providing lifesaving first 
aid to victims of senseless violence on 
the evening of October 1, 2017, in Las 
Vegas, NV. 
On that day, Sergeant Brown was 
suddenly and unexpectedly thrust into 
a massacre of his fellow citizens. As 
bullets rained down indiscriminately 
from above on innocent concert-goers, 
Sergeantt Brown immediately began 
delivering critical aid to dozens of 
wounded 
victims, 
saving 
countless 
lives while placing his own life in ex-
traordinary danger. 
Bravery, sacrifice, and service to oth-
ers are not, however, novel concepts to 
Sergeant Brown. As a gunner for Char-
lie Battery, 2nd Battalion, 222nd Field 
Artillery, Sergeant Brown has dedi-
cated his career to serving our country. 
Today, we are lucky to have his service 
in the Utah National Guard, and our 
State is safer as a result. For his her-
oism, Governor Herbert awarded Ser-
geant Brown with the Utah Medal of 
Valor, the highest level of recognition 
for distinguished service. This honor is 
well-deserved, but the greatest reward 
is the gift of life that Sergeant Brown 
protected for the many civilians he 
saved that night amid terror and evil. 
The great people of the State of Utah 
and our fellow Americans owe Sergeant 
Chasen Brown a debt of gratitude for 
his extraordinary courage under un-
imaginable circumstances. Thank you, 
Chasen.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
HEALY FOUNDATION 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, today I rise to recognize the 
Healy Foundation as it celebrates 10 
years of supporting and facilitating the 
quality education of remarkable stu-
dents across the country. 
The James P. and Debra Fitzgerald 
Healy Foundation was created in 2010 
by Jim and Debra’s 10 children in 
honor of their parents’ lifelong devo-
tion to education. The couple dedicated 
their lives to ensuring their children 
received 
an 
outstanding 
education. 
Both Jim, who passed away last year, 
and Debra unfailingly demonstrated 
the importance of a strong work ethic 
through their tireless efforts on behalf 
of their family at work and at home. 
Based in Naugatuck, CT, the founda-
tion provides assistance to high-achiev-
ing college students who encounter un-
expected hardships and subsequently 
need financial help to continue their 
education. This support has been essen-
tial for countless students who deserve 
to finish their degrees, regardless of 
any obstacles they have encountered. 
Now, as COVID–19 poses unprece-
dented health and financial challenges 
in Connecticut and across the globe, 
the Healy Foundation’s work is more 
necessary than ever. It is critical that 
education remains equitable and acces-
sible to everyone, and the foundation 
continues to uphold that mission, 
awarding scholarships to 11 new stu-
dents this year. 
Committed to furthering a family 
legacy by bolstering bright, deserving 
young scholars, the Healy Foundation 
sets a positive example of encouraging 
and advancing well-earned education. I 
applaud their accomplishments and 
hope my colleagues will join me in con-
gratulating the Healy Foundation on 10 
years of helping others achieve their 
academic dreams.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING FRESCO FOODS, INC. 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize a small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit at the heart of our 
country. Today, I am delighted to rec-
ognize a small business that provides 
healthy prepackaged meals and fosters 
community development. This week, it 
is my privilege to honor Fresco Foods, 
Inc., of Tampa, FL, as the Senate 
Small Business of the Week. 
In 2014, Rob and Tracy Povolny 
founded Fresco Foods in Tampa, FL. 
When Rob was laid off by a corporate 
food seller, he chose to pursue his goal 
of establishing a high-quality packaged 
food company. Using their savings, re-
tirement, and some loans from friends 
and family, they rented space in an in-
dustrial kitchen to create their recipes. 
That December, they began selling 
their ‘‘Eat Fresco’’ meals at local 
mom-and-pop grocery stores. Their 
healthy, satisfying meals were an in-
stant hit. 
Six years later, Fresco Foods has 
grown into a thriving company with 
more than 120 employees. In 2017, a 
U.S. Small Business Administration 
7(a) loan enabled Rob and Tracy to es-
tablish their own 12,000 square foot pro-
duction facility, creating more than 100 
jobs. Their ingredients are sourced 
from a local distributor, and their 
product packaging is eco-friendly. In 
2018, Fresco Foods reached a major 
milestone when they began selling 
their products in a handful of Publix 
stores. Today, Fresco Foods stock their 
‘‘Eat Fresco’’ prepared meals in all 
1,252 Publix locations across seven 
States. Additionally, they are working 
to launch a prepackaged breakfast line 
later this year. 
Together, 
Rob 
and 
Tracy 
have 
prioritized business mentorship and en-
sures Fresco Foods supports the com-
munity. Through podcasts and by con-
ducting workshops, Rob and Tracy 
have shared their experiences, teaching 
entrepreneurship to future small busi-
ness owners. Fresco Foods regularly 
donates to local organizations like 
Feeding Tampa Bay. They also work 
with Metropolitan Ministries to em-
ploy graduates of its culinary technical 
training program. For its success and 
innovation, Fresco Foods has been rec-
ognized by local media and business 
outlets, including the Tampa Bay Busi-
ness Journal. 
Like many Floridian small business, 
Fresco Foods jumped in to help their 
community 
during 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
As 
Florida 
went 
into 
lockdown, philanthropic organizations 
experienced a drop in donations as de-
mand for their resources surged. Rob 
and Tracy donated hundreds of ‘‘Eat 
Fresco’’ meals to homeless shelters and 
domestic 
violence 
shelters 
in 
the 
Tampa area. 
In April 2020, the U.S. Small Business 
Administration launched the Paycheck 
Protection Program, a small business 
relief program that I was proud to au-
thor. The PPP provides forgivable 
loans to impacted small businesses and

nonprofits who maintain their payroll 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. Rob 
and Tracy used their PPP loan, which 
Fresco Foods received in April, to keep 
all of their employees on payroll until 
Florida reopened. 
Fresco Foods, Inc., is a notable exam-
ple of how small businesses can achieve 
commercial success, and remain com-
mitted to investing in their commu-
nities. Congratulations to Rob, Tracy, 
and the entire team at Fresco Foods. I 
look forward to watching your contin-

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 692—DESIG-
NATING 
SEPTEMBER 
2020 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL PROSTATE CANCER 
AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
CRAPO, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. 
CARDIN, Mr. KING, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mr. COONS, Mr. BOOK-
ER, and Mr. HAWLEY) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 692 
Whereas more than 3,100,000 men in the 
United States are living with prostate can-
cer; 
Whereas 1 in 9 men in the United States 
will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 
their lifetimes and 1 in 41 men in the United 
States will die from prostate cancer; 
Whereas prostate cancer is the most com-
monly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the 
second-leading 
cause 
of 
cancer-related 
deaths among men in the United States; 
Whereas the American Cancer Society esti-
mates that, in 2020, 191,930 men will be diag-
nosed with, and more than 33,330 men will 
die of, prostate cancer; 
Whereas 40.9 percent of newly diagnosed 
prostate cancer cases occur in men under the 
age of 65; 
Whereas the odds of developing prostate 
cancer rise rapidly after age 50; 
Whereas 
African-American 
men 
suffer 
from a prostate cancer incidence rate that is 
significantly higher than that of White men 
and have more than double the prostate can-
cer mortality rate than that of White men; 
Whereas having a father or brother with 
prostate cancer more than doubles the risk 
of a man developing prostate cancer, with a 
higher risk for men who have a brother with 
the disease and the highest risk for men with 
several affected relatives; 
Whereas screening by a digital rectal ex-
amination and a prostate-specific antigen 
blood test can detect the disease at the ear-
lier, more treatable stages, which could in-
crease the chances of survival for more than 
5 years to nearly 100 percent; 
Whereas only 31 percent of men survive 
more than 5 years if diagnosed with prostate 
cancer after the cancer has metastasized; 
Whereas there are typically no noticeable 
symptoms of prostate cancer in the early 
stages, making appropriate screening crit-
ical; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2020, the Director of 
the National Institutes of Health will sup-
port approximately $287,000,000 in research 
projects focused specifically on prostate can-
cer; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2020, Congress ap-
propriated $110,000,000 for the Prostate Can-
cer Research Program of the Department of 
Defense; 
Whereas ongoing research promises further 
improvements in prostate cancer prevention, 
early detection, and treatment; and 
Whereas educating people in the United 
States, including health care providers, 
about prostate cancer and early detection 
strategies is crucial to saving the lives of 
men and preserving and protecting families: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2020 as ‘‘National 
Prostate Cancer Awareness Month’’; 
(2) declares that steps should be taken— 
(A) to raise awareness about the impor-
tance of screening methods for, and treat-
ment of, prostate cancer; 
(B) to encourage research— 
(i) to improve screening and treatment for 
prostate cancer; 
(ii) to discover the causes of prostate can-
cer; and 
(iii) to develop a cure for prostate cancer; 
and 
(C) to continue to consider ways to im-
prove access to, and the quality of, health 
care services for detecting and treating pros-
tate cancer; and 
(3) calls on the people of the United States, 
interest groups, and affected persons— 
(A) to promote awareness of prostate can-
cer; 
(B) to take an active role in the fight to 
end the devastating effects of prostate can-
cer on individuals, families, and the econ-
omy; and 
(C) to observe National Prostate Cancer 
Awareness Month with appropriate cere-
monies and activities.

SENATE RESOLUTION 693—RECOG-
NIZING THE DUTY OF THE FED-
ERAL GOVERNMENT TO IMPLE-
MENT AN AGENDA TO TRANS-
FORM, HEAL, AND RENEW BY IN-
VESTING IN A VIBRANT ECON-
OMY (‘‘THRIVE’’) 
Mr. MARKEY (for himself, Mr. BOOK-
ER, Mr. SCHUMER, Ms. WARREN, Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND, Mr. UDALL, Mr. SANDERS, 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. 
MERKLEY, and Mr. HEINRICH) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 693 
Whereas 
families 
and 
communities 
throughout the United States share similar 
hopes and dreams of a good life that is free 
from worry about meeting basic needs, with 
reliable and fulfilling work, a dignified and 
healthy standard of living, and the ability to 
enjoy time with loved ones; 
Whereas the United States faces the stress 
of multiple, overlapping crises—old and 
new—that prevent the achievement of these 
fundamental human rights and needs, in 
which the COVID–19 pandemic has killed 
over 180,000 United States residents; tens of 
millions of United States workers remain 
unemployed; rising economic inequality has 
made working families vulnerable; tens of 
millions of individuals do not get the health 
care they need; and intensifying climate 
change increases the threats to our health, 
economy, and livelihoods; 
Whereas these health, economic, and cli-
mate crises have magnified centuries-old in-
justices, causing high rates of death and 
hardship among Black, Brown, and Indige-
nous communities due to long-standing sys-
temic racism—a fact spotlighted by an 
emerging, multiracial movement to end vio-
lence against Black people; 
Whereas these crises are causing the in-
equitable workloads of women—particularly 
women of color—to grow, especially as 
women of color overwhelmingly make up the 
essential workforce, bearing the weight of 
the increased care needs of children, the el-
derly, and the sick; 
Whereas, even before the COVID–19 crisis, 
many rural communities and independent 
family farmers suffered from poverty, declin-
ing economic opportunity, and alarming 
rates of farm bankruptcy, including loss of 
land from Black farmers and the exploi-
tation of Black, Brown, and Indigenous farm-
ers caused by predatory and racist public, 
private, and governmental institutions and 
policies; 
Whereas the root of our interlocking eco-
nomic and environmental crises is society’s 
historical willingness to treat some commu-
nities and workers as disposable; 
Whereas it is necessary to counteract sys-
temic injustice and value the dignity of all 
individuals in order to address unemploy-
ment, pandemics, or climate change and en-
sure the survival of the Nation and the plan-
et; 
Whereas the choices made in response to 
these crises will shape the United States’ di-
rection for the 21st century and beyond, of-
fering an opportunity to reshape our society 
to provide a good life for each of us and for 
our children and grandchildren; and 
Whereas the United States has the means 
to support fulfilling livelihoods for millions 
of people—Black, Indigenous, Brown, Latinx, 
Asian/Pacific Islander, White, immigrant, 
urban and rural, old and young, of many 
faiths, genders, abilities, and talents—while 
working to heal harms, protect commu-
nities, and invest in a future that fosters jus-
tice, not crisis: Now therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) it is the duty of the Federal Govern-
ment to respond to the crises of racial injus-
tice, mass unemployment, a pandemic, and 
climate change with a bold and holistic na-
tional mobilization, an Agenda to Trans-
form, Heal, and Renew by Investing in a Vi-
brant Economy (‘‘THRIVE’’) (referred to in 
this resolving clause as the ‘‘Agenda’’), to 
build a society that enables— 
(A) greater racial, economic, and gender 
justice; 
(B) dignified work; 
(C) healthy communities; and 
(D) a stable climate; and 
(2) such Agenda shall be assessed upon its 
ability to uphold its foundational pillars, in-
cluding— 
(A) creating millions of good, safe jobs 
with access to unions by— 
(i) investing in projects including— 
(I) upgrading our broken infrastructure to 
expand access to clean and affordable en-
ergy, transportation, high-speed broadband, 
and water, particularly for public systems; 
(II) modernizing and retrofitting millions 
of homes, schools, offices, and industrial 
buildings to cut pollution and costs; 
(III) investing in public health and care 
work, including by increasing jobs, protec-
tions, wages, and benefits for the historically 
unpaid and undervalued work of caring for 
children, the elderly, and the sick; 
(IV) protecting and restoring wetlands, for-
ests, and public lands, and cleaning up pollu-
tion in our communities; 
(V) creating opportunities for family farm-
ers and rural communities, including by un-
tangling the hyper-consolidated food supply 
chain, bolstering regenerative agriculture, 
and investing in local and regional food sys-
tems that support farmers, agricultural 
workers, healthy soil, and climate resilience; 
and 
(VI) developing and transforming the in-
dustrial base of the United States, while cre-
ating high-skill, high-wage manufacturing 
jobs across the country, including by expand-
ing manufacturing of clean technologies, re-
ducing industrial pollution, and prioritizing 
clean, domestic manufacturing for the afore-
mentioned investments; 
(ii) prioritizing the mobilization of direct 
public investments, while excluding false so-
lutions that— 
(I) increase inequality; 
(II) privatize public lands, water, or na-
ture; 
(III) violate human rights; 
(IV) expedite the destruction of eco-
systems; or 
(V) decrease union density or membership; 
(iii) driving investment toward real full 
employment, where every individual who

meaningful and dignified job with the right 
to form a union, including by establishing

Agenda to high-road labor standards that— 
(I) require family-sustaining wages and 
benefits, including child care support; 
(II) ensure safe workplaces; 
(III) protect the rights of workers to orga-
nize; and 
(IV) prioritize the hiring of local workers 
to ensure wages stay within communities to 
stimulate economic activity; 
(B) building the power of workers to fight 
inequality by— 
(i) reversing the corporate erosion of work-
ers’ organizing rights and bargaining power 
so that millions of new clean energy jobs, as 
well as millions of existing low-wage jobs 
across the economy, become the family-sup-
porting union jobs that everyone deserves, 
including by— 
(I) passing the bipartisan Protecting the 
Right to Organize Act; 
(II) repealing the ban on secondary boy-
cotts; 
(III) requiring employer neutrality with re-
gard to union organizing; 
(IV) ensuring that ‘‘franchising’’ and other 
corporate structures may not be used to 
hinder collective bargaining on a company-

tain economic sectors; and 
(VI) 
ensuring 
that 
no 
workers 
are

workers; and 
(iii) creating ladders of opportunity, par-
ticularly for women and people of color, to 
access registered apprenticeship and pre-ap-
prenticeship programs in communities of all 
sizes across the country; 
(C) investing in Black, Brown, and Indige-
nous communities to build power and coun-
teract racial and gender injustice by— 
(i) directing at least 40 percent of invest-
ments to communities that have been ex-
cluded, oppressed, and harmed by racist and 
unjust practices, including— 
(I) communities of color; 
(II) low-income communities; 
(III) deindustrialized communities; and 
(IV) communities facing environmental in-
justice; 
(ii) ensuring that investments in these 
communities enable— 
(I) the creation of good jobs with family- 
sustaining wages; 
(II) economic ownership opportunities that 
close the racial wealth gap; 
(III) pollution reduction; 
(IV) climate resilience; 
(V) small business support; 
(VI) 
economic 
opportunities 
for 
inde-
pendent family farmers and ranchers; and

have the power to democratically plan, im-
plement, and administer these projects; 
(iv) prioritizing local and equitable hiring 
and contracting that creates opportunities 
for— 
(I) people of color; 
(II) immigrants, regardless of immigration

(V) LGBTQIAP+ individuals; 
(VI) disabled and chronically ill individ-

MENENDEZ, Ms. HIRONO, Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN, Ms. CORTEZ MASTO, Mr. BOOKER, 
Mr. UDALL, Mr. REED, Mr. KING, and 
Ms. DUCKWORTH) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 695 
Whereas voting is one of the single most 
important rights that can be exercised in a 
democracy; 
Whereas, over the course of history, var-
ious voter suppression laws in the United 
States have hindered, and even prohibited, 
certain individuals and groups from exer-
cising the right to vote; 
Whereas, during the 19th and early 20th 
centuries, Native Americans and people who 
were born to United States citizens abroad, 
people who spoke a language other than 
English, and people who were formerly sub-
jected to slavery were denied full citizenship 
and prevented from voting by English lit-
eracy tests; 
Whereas, since the 1870s, minority groups 
such as African Americans in the South have 
suffered from the oppressive effects of Jim 
Crow laws that were designed to prevent po-
litical, economic, and social mobility; 
Whereas 
African 
Americans, 
Latinos, 
Asian Americans, Native Americans, and 
other underrepresented voters were subject 
to violence, poll taxes, literacy tests, all- 
White primaries, property ownership tests, 
and grandfather clauses that were designed 
to suppress the right of those individuals to 
vote; 
Whereas members of the aforementioned 
groups and others are currently, in some 
cases, subject to intimidation, voter roll 
purges, bans on former prisoners from vot-
ing, and financial barriers that act effec-
tively as modern-day poll taxes; 
Whereas, in 1965, Congress passed the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) 
to protect the right of African Americans 
and 
other 
traditionally 
disenfranchised 
groups to vote, among other reasons; 
Whereas, in 2013, in the landmark case of 
Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013), 
the Supreme Court of the United States in-
validated section 4 of the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965, dismantling the preclearance for-
mula provision in that Act that protected 
voters in States and localities that histori-
cally have suppressed the right of minorities 
to vote; 
Whereas, since the invalidation of the 
preclearance formula provision of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, gerrymandered districts 
in many States have gone unchallenged and 
have become less likely to be invalidated by 
the courts; 
Whereas these gerrymandered districts 
have been found to have discriminatory im-
pacts on traditionally disenfranchised mi-
norities through tactics that include ‘‘crack-
ing’’, diluting the voting power of minorities 
across many districts, and ‘‘packing’’ or con-
centrating minority voters’ power in one dis-
trict to reduce their voting power in other 
districts; 
Whereas the courts have found the con-
gressional and, in some cases, State legisla-
tive district maps, in Texas, North Carolina, 
Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin 
to be gerrymandered districts that were cre-
ated to favor some groups over others; 
Whereas the decision of the Supreme Court 
in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 
(2013), calls on Congress to update the for-
mula in the Voting Rights Act of 1965; 
Whereas some form of a restrictive voting 
law has been instituted in at least 23 States 
since 2013; 
Whereas these restrictive voting laws en-
compass cutbacks in early voting, voter roll 
purges, placement of faulty equipment in mi-
nority communities, requirement of photo 
identification, and the elimination of same- 
day registration; 
Whereas these policies could outright dis-
enfranchise or make voting much more dif-
ficult for more than 80,000,000 minority, el-
derly, poor, and disabled voters, among other 
groups; 
Whereas, in 2016, discriminatory laws in 
North Carolina, Wisconsin, North Dakota, 
and Texas were ruled to violate voters’ 
rights and overturned by the courts; 
Whereas the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘COVID–19’’) 
public health emergency has only exacer-
bated the state of elections and the difficul-
ties voters face in obtaining access to the 
ballot; 
Whereas a lack of fair and safe election 
policies threatens minority communities, 
which have been disproportionately im-
pacted 
and 
disenfranchised 
due 
to 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and their access to the 
ballot; 
Whereas addressing the challenges of ad-
ministering upcoming elections in 2020 and 
beyond requires increasing the accessibility 
of vote-by-mail and other limited-contact 
options to ensure the protection of voters’ 
health and safety amid a global pandemic; 
Whereas, as voting by mail becomes a safer 
and more accessible option for voters to ex-
ercise their constitutional right to vote dur-
ing the unprecedented times caused by the 
COVID–19 pandemic, the work of the United 
States Postal Service will be of paramount 
importance in successfully conducting elec-
tions; 
Whereas Congress must work to combat 
any attempts to dismantle or underfund the 
United States Postal Service or obstruct the 
passage of the mail as blatant tactics of 
voter suppression and election interference; 
Whereas there is much more work to be 
done to ensure all citizens of the United 
States have the right to vote through free, 
fair, and accessible elections; 
Whereas National Voter Registration Day 
is September 22; and 
Whereas September 2020 would be an appro-
priate month to designate as ‘‘National Vot-
ing Rights Month’’ and to ensure that, 
through the registration of voters and 
awareness of elections, the democracy of the 
United States includes all citizens of the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2020 as ‘‘National 
Voting Rights Month’’; 
(2) encourages all people in the United 
States to uphold the right of every citizen to 
exercise the sacred and fundamental right to 
vote; 
(3) commemorates— 
(A) the 100th anniversary of Senate passage 
of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution 
of the United States, which guarantees 
women the right to vote; and 
(B) the legacy of generations of suffragists 
who fought to protect women’s rights at the 
ballot; 
(4) encourages Congress to pass— 
(A) the For the People Act of 2019 (S. 949 
and H.R. 1 of the 116th Congress), to increase 
voters’ access to the ballot, prohibit the use 
of deceptive practices to intimidate voters, 
end gerrymandering, create automatic voter 
registration, limit the power of restrictive 
voter identification laws, make critical in-
vestments in election infrastructure and 
technology, and address corruption in cam-
paign finance and ethics; 
(B) the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act of 2020 (H.R. 4 of the 116th 
Congress) (introduced in the Senate as the 
Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019 (S. 
561 of the 116th Congress)), to restore the 
protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
(52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.) that prohibit dis-
criminatory voting practices, remove bar-
riers to voting, and provide protections for 
minority voters in States with a history of 
voting discrimination; 
(C) the Natural Disaster and Emergency 
Ballot Act of 2020 (S. 4033 of the 116th Con-
gress), to ensure that every eligible voter in 
the United States is able to exercise the 
right to vote safely and securely during a de-
clared state of emergency by, among other 
things— 
(i) guaranteeing no-excuse absentee voting; 
(ii) expanding early voting; 
(iii) providing self-sealing return envelopes 
with prepaid postage for— 
(I) voter registration applications; 
(II) absentee-ballot applications; and 
(III) absentee ballots; and 
(iv) providing accommodations for voters 
on Indian lands; 
(D) the Delivering for America Act (S. 4527 
and H.R. 8015 in the 116th Congress), to pro-
hibit the United States Postal Service from 
making changes to operations or levels of 
service that would reduce those operations 
or levels of service relative to those that 
were in effect on January 1, 2020, establish 
requirements for the processing of election 
mail, and provide additional funding for the

SENATE RESOLUTION 696—DESIG-
NATING SEPTEMBER 4, 2020, AS 
‘‘NATIONAL POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY 
DISEASE AWARENESS DAY’’, AND 
RAISING AWARENESS AND UN-
DERSTANDING 
OF 
POLYCYSTIC 
KIDNEY DISEASE 
Mr. BLUNT (for himself and Mr. 
CARDIN) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 696 
Whereas designating September 4, 2020, as 
‘‘National Polycystic Kidney Disease Aware-
ness Day’’ will raise public awareness and 
understanding of polycystic kidney disease, 
one of the most prevalent genetic kidney dis-
orders, which affects approximately 500,000 
people in the United States; 
Whereas National Polycystic Kidney Dis-
ease Awareness Day will help to foster an 
understanding of the impact polycystic kid-
ney disease has on individuals and their fam-
ilies; 
Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a pro-
gressive, genetic disorder of the kidneys that 
causes damage to the kidneys and the car-
diovascular, endocrine, hepatic, and gastro-
intestinal organ systems; 
Whereas polycystic kidney disease affects 
the health and finances of individuals, and 
equally affects individuals of all ages, races, 
ethnicities, and sexes; 
Whereas, of the individuals diagnosed with 
polycystic kidney disease, approximately 10 
percent have no family history of the dis-
ease, with the disease developing as a spon-
taneous mutation; 
Whereas there are very few treatments and 
no cure for polycystic kidney disease, which 
is 1 of the 4 leading causes of kidney failure 
in the United States; 
Whereas almost 50 percent of individuals 
with polycystic kidney disease experience 
kidney failure by age 60; 
Whereas friends, loved ones, spouses, and 
caregivers of individuals with polycystic kid-
ney disease can assist with the challenges 
created by polycystic kidney disease, includ-
ing by helping such individuals maintain a 
healthy lifestyle and make regular visits to 
their health care providers; 
Whereas the severity of the symptoms of 
polycystic kidney disease and limited public 
awareness of the disease may cause individ-
uals to forego regular visits to their physi-
cians or avoid following the health rec-
ommendations of their doctors, which ex-
perts suggest could help prevent further 
complications should kidney failure occur; 
Whereas individuals who have chronic, life- 
threatening diseases like polycystic kidney 
disease may experience depression; 
Whereas the PKD Foundation and its more 
than 35,000 patient and family advocates 
around the United States are dedicated to— 
(1) conducting research to find treatments 
and a cure for polycystic kidney disease; 
(2) fostering public awareness and under-
standing of polycystic kidney disease; 
(3) educating individuals and their families 
about the disease to improve their treatment 
and care; and 
(4) providing support, including by spon-
soring the annual ‘‘Walk for PKD’’, to raise 
funds for polycystic kidney disease research, 
education, advocacy, and awareness; and 
Whereas, on September 4, 2020, the PKD 
Foundation is partnering with sister organi-
zations in Canada, Australia, and other 
countries to increase international aware-
ness of polycystic kidney disease: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 4, 2020, as ‘‘Na-
tional Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness 
Day’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness 
Day to raise public awareness and under-
standing of polycystic kidney disease; 
(3) recognizes the need for additional re-
search to find a cure for polycystic kidney 
disease; and 
(4) encourages all people in the United 
States and interested groups to support Na-
tional Polycystic Kidney Awareness Day 
through appropriate ceremonies and activi-
ties to promote public awareness of poly-
cystic kidney disease and to foster an under-
standing of the impact of the disease on indi-
viduals and their families.

and Mrs. MURRAY)) submitted the fol-
lowing concurrent resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. CON. RES. 44 
Whereas, on September 11, 2001, the United 
States endured violent terrorist attacks and 
events (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘attacks’’) in New York City, Washington, 
DC, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, leading 
to the tragic deaths and injuries of thou-
sands of innocent United States citizens and 
others from more than 90 different countries 
and territories; 
Whereas, in response to the attacks, fire-
fighters, uniformed officers, emergency med-
ical technicians, physicians, nurses, military 
personnel, and other first responders imme-
diately rose to service in the heroic attempt 
to save the lives of the individuals in danger; 
Whereas, in the immediate aftermath of 
the attacks, thousands of recovery workers, 
including trades personnel, iron workers, 
equipment operators, and many others, 
joined with uniformed officers and military 
personnel to help search for and recover vic-
tims lost in the attacks; 
Whereas, in the days, weeks, and months 
following the attacks, thousands of individ-
uals in the United States spontaneously vol-
unteered to help support rescue and recovery 
efforts, braving both physical and emotional 
hardship; 
Whereas many first responders, rescue and 
recovery workers, volunteers, and survivors 
of the attacks continue to suffer from seri-
ous medical illnesses and emotional distress 
related to the physical and mental trauma of 
the attacks; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of brave in-
dividuals continue to serve every day, an-
swering the call to duty as members of the 
Armed Forces, with some having given their 
lives or suffered injury— 
(1) to defend the security of the United 
States; and 
(2) to prevent further terrorist attacks; 
Whereas people of the United States wit-
nessed and endured the tragedy of September 
11, 2001, and, in the immediate aftermath of 
the attacks, became unified under a remark-
able spirit of service and compassion that in-
spired the people of the United States; 
Whereas, in the years immediately fol-
lowing the attacks, there was a marked in-
crease in volunteerism and national service 
among the people of the United States, 
which continues to this day; 
Whereas, in 2009, Congress passed, and 
President Barack Obama signed, the bipar-
tisan Serve America Act (Public Law 111–13; 
123 Stat. 1460), which— 
(1) established, at the request of the 9/11 
community, Federal recognition of Sep-
tember 11 as a ‘‘National Day of Service and 
Remembrance’’ (commonly referred to as ‘‘9/ 
11 Day’’); and 
(2) charged the Corporation for National 
and Community Service with leading that 
annual day of service; 
Whereas, during the period beginning on 
the date of establishment of September 11 as 
a National Day of Service and Remembrance, 
millions of individuals in the United States 
observe that date by engaging in a wide 
range of service activities and private forms 
of prayer and remembrance; 
Whereas, during the Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID–19) national emergency— 
(1) Americans have once again rallied to-
gether to rise to the challenge by caring for 
the sick, providing essential services, and 
volunteering in their communities; and 
(2) 
there 
have 
been 
robust 
calls 
to 
strengthen, expand, and participate in all 
forms of national and community service; 
and

ceding clause are the continuation of an

American tradition of individuals and com-
munities coming together to serve each 
other in times of need: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) recognizes, commends, and honors the 
selfless dedication to fellow citizens dis-
played through the heroic actions of first re-
sponders and other citizens in New York 
City, Washington, DC, and Shanksville, 
Pennsylvania; 
(2) calls on the Members of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives, and all people 
of the United States, to observe September 
11, 2020, as a ‘‘National Day of Service and 
Remembrance’’, with appropriate and per-
sonal expressions of service and reflection, 
which may include performing good deeds, 
displaying the United States flag, partici-
pating in memorial and remembrance serv-
ices, and safely engaging in volunteer service 
or other charitable activities— 
(A) in honor of the individuals who lost 
their lives or were injured in the attacks of 
September 11, 2001; and 
(B) in tribute to the individuals who rose 
to service— 
(i) to come to the aid of those individuals 
in need; and 
(ii) in defense of the United States; and 
(3) urges all people of the United States to 
continue to live their lives throughout the 
year with the same spirit of unity, service, 
and compassion that was exhibited through-
out the United States following the terrorist 
attacks of September 11, 2001.

RECOGNIZING NANCY W. SCHULZE 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to pay a heart-felt tribute to 
speaker, singer, activist, servant leader, for-
ward thinker, and prayer warrior Nancy 
Schulze. Mrs. Schulze is an incredibly gifted 
individual who has spent her life using those 
gifts in service to others. Nancy’s achieve-
ments and accomplishments are too numer-
ous to catalog, but among them are per-
forming in the Capitol Rotunda, as well as at 
Galas honoring First Ladies Barbara Bush, 
and Laura Bush. In 2008, she founded the Re-
publican Congressional Wives Speakers in 
Washington and holds annual seminars for 
this group featuring top experts in the fields of 
speaking, media, training and thought leader-
ship. She is cofounder of the American Prayer 
Initiative. She has spoken at the Global Pas-
tors Wives Conference, the National Repub-
lican Women’s Summit in Washington, the 
Christian Women in Media Association and 
the Inaugural Prayer Breakfast for the Gov-
ernor of New York. She is a Colson Center 
Centurion, having completed a year-long in-
tensive master’s level course on world view in 
2010. Nancy has spoken at the National Pray-
er Breakfast as well as events for Members of 
the U.S. Senate, House and Presidency. She 
is currently involved in many endeavors in-
cluding Physicians for Reform to repair our 
broken healthcare system. 
Given her list of accomplishments, the most 
astounding thing about Nancy Schulze is her 
seemingly unending energy and passion to 
work for the good of this nation. Her efforts 
would not be possible without her compassion 
and extraordinary commitment to excellence. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
this patriot, public servant, faithful Christian, 
and my friend, Nancy Schulze.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
ONE 
HUN-
DREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF KNX 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor KNX News Radio (KNX) upon its 
one-hundredth anniversary. 
KNX began humbly in the back bedroom of 
the home of founder Fred Christian, a former 
wireless operator and manager at one of the 
first radio supply stores in Los Angeles. On 
September 10, 1920, with parts from his store, 
Mr. Christian set up an amateur radio station 
with the call letters 6ADZ. At the time, the sta-
tion was one of only two stations broadcasting 
music in Southern California. In 1922, Mr. 
Christian built a new 100-watt transmitter and 
was given the call letters KNX, still used 
today. That year, the radio station started 
broadcasting a nightly newscast, one of the 
first heard in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles 
Times called the broadcast ‘‘one of the best in 
the land.’’ 
KNX quickly became known as ‘‘The Voice 
of Hollywood,’’ an invaluable news resource 
for the community and the nation. KNX has a 
long and illustrious history in Southern Cali-
fornia, predating the Hollywood Sign and the 
Rose Bowl stadium. In 1925, KNX provided 
what is thought to be the first accurate news 
coverage of the Santa Barbara earthquake. 
Five years later, in 1930, KNX became the 
first station to broadcast the Academy Awards. 
That timely, accurate reporting became its 
hallmark. 
Over the last century, KNX has provided un-
wavering coverage of local and national news 
stories. In 1938, the station aired Orson 
Welles’ infamous adaptation of ‘‘The War of 
the Worlds’’ from its new Columbia Square 
studio complex. That studio went on to host 
and record precedent-setting broadcasts, in-
cluding performances by Lucille Ball, Frank Si-
natra, and Bing Crosby. In 1968, a landmark 
year for KNX, the station provided comprehen-
sive coverage of the Vietnam War protests 
and the assassination of Martin Luther King. 
The same year, KNX provided critical breaking 
news coverage of the assassination of Robert 
F. Kennedy, with live on-the-ground coverage 
from the Ambassador Hotel and Central Re-
ceiving Hospital. 
Today, KNX, a national Edward R. Murrow 
award-winner for ‘‘Breaking News,’’ continues 
its steadfast commitment to the community by

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE-
SAVING 
SERVICE 
OF 
DR. 
LAURENT 
DUVERNAY-TARDIF, 
C.Q. 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the lifesaving service of Dr. 
Laurent Duvernay-Tardif. From his youth in 
Montreal to his football career in Kansas City, 
Dr. Duvernay-Tardif has proven himself to be 
a hero in more ways than one. His story is 
timely; it is instructive; and it is extraordinary. 
When Dr. Duvernay-Tardif helped bring the 
Lombardi Trophy back home to Kansas City 
after fifty long years, I did not think I could 
gain a deeper sense of admiration or gratitude 
for the Chiefs. Since then, however, that same 
sense of gratitude has grown even more pro-
found. Today, it is my honor to join his team-
mates, Coach Andy Reid, and our great city in 
saying Merci, Docteur Duvernay-Tardif, for 
your vital and noble work fighting the deadly 
coronavirus pandemic on the frontlines. 
From watching college lectures at half- 
speed with an English dictionary in hand, to 
working as an NFL lineman while earning a 
medical degree, Dr. Duvernay-Tardif has 
spent his whole life defying expectations. 
When he graduated from McGill University 
Faculty of Medicine in May 2018 with a doc-
torate in medicine and master’s in surgery, it 
had already been four years since he was 
drafted into the NFL just after assisting an 
emergency C-section. Since joining the NFL, 
he has worked overnights at the hospital, slept 
in the locker room wearing his scrubs, and 
never stopped putting forth the utmost effort 
for his team—whether under stadium lights or 
fluorescent medical lamps. Moreover, he has 
stepped up to make football a safer sport with 
his presence on the NFL’s Health and Safety 
Committee and given back to his community 
through the LDT Foundation. And, of course, 
he also helped deliver a historic win to a 
grateful city. As I consider Dr. Duvernay- 
Tardif’s remarkable story, I see an athlete in 
the O.R. and a surgeon on the field. In both, 
I see an indomitable spirit. 
And when the world called upon a new 
breed of soldier to fight an invisible threat, Dr. 
Duvernay-Tardif answered that call without 
hesitation. Even before securing a position at 
a healthcare facility, he was using his platform 
and expertise to inform and educate. Now, as 
an orderly at a long-term care facility, he is 
doing the unglamorous, lifesaving work of car-
ing for and protecting those most vulnerable to 
this virus. Recently, in order to continue this 
critical work, he became the first professional 
football player to opt-out of the upcoming sea-
son. Like him, I support every player’s per-
sonal decision on the matter. However, l must 
say that I see in his decision the same young 
man who, on a year-long sailing expedition, 
used to be summoned at midnight to take the 
helm while his family slept. He knows what it 
means to sail in the darkness of night, when 
there is nothing to guide you but your own 
radar. 
As a Chiefs super-fan, as a citizen, as one 
of millions across the globe staring down this 
specter, it is my honor to express in this forum 
how proud Dr. Duvernay-Tardif continues to 
make all of us in Kansas City. He guarded 
Patrick Mahomes, and now, he is guarding all 
of us. Madam Speaker, please join me and 
my constituents in Missouri’s 5th District in 
wishing Dr. Duvernay-Tardif safety, health, 
and good fortune as he serves his community 
during this pandemic. I also want to assure

him and his colleagues across the country that 
I will do everything I can to be a voice for the 
urgent needs of the medical community in the 
halls of Congress. In fact, let us all join in that 
pledge. Heroes like Dr. Duvernay-Tardif are 
on the line, helmet-to-helmet with this threat, 
standing between us and total catastrophe. 
They are guarding us so that we can do our 
jobs. It is the end of the fourth quarter, we 
have no more time-outs, and our team has 
come to a standstill. We have had a play on 
the books since May, and it is time to put it 
in the field because time is running out. Dr. 
Duvernay-Tardif is fighting for our lives. It is 
time we had his back.

HONORING MR. ROBERT REILLY 
HON. MAX ROSE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to acknowledge today the efforts of 
Robert Reilly, who throughout this turbulent 
year has gone out of his way to support his 
workforce at RTR Financial on Staten Island. 
It is well known within RTR Financial that 
when you work for Mr. Reilly you become part 
of the family; he often says that ‘‘family comes 
first.’’ 
During the early months of pandemic, Mr. 
Reilly exemplified these values by ensuring 
that every single employee had their needs 
met. He became an early adopter of remote- 
work to keep his employees safe, and in-
vested in his employees to make sure they 
were properly equipped for this new environ-
ment. Mr. Reilly’s kindness did not stop there, 
for he continues to support his workplace fam-
ily through the transition back to the office. 
Robert has consistently reassured his employ-
ees as well as keeping them informed about 
local testing initiatives. 
Packages of sanitizer and other safety 
equipment are given to employees weekly, 
and Mr. Reilly has allowed many to continue 
their remote-work indefinitely. I want to thank 
him for setting a positive example and for 
proving that the best way for businesses to 
navigate these tough times is by investing in 
the safety and well-being of their employees. 
HONORING THE SERVICE AND SAC-
RIFICE 
OF 
SOUTH 
FLORIDA’S 
FIRST RESPONDERS 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to honor South Florida’s first responders, as 
they continue to serve our communities 
through these unprecedented times. 
As we all know too well, the World Health 
Organization declared COVID–19 a global 
pandemic on March 11, 2020. In response, 
many states and municipalities imposed re-
strictions and closures on business and indi-
vidual activities to reduce the spread of the 
virus. Despite taking these drastic, yet nec-
essary, steps, the virus struck South Florida 
much harder than other areas of the state. 
Putting themselves at great personal risk, 
our first responders have been the first line of 
defense for our communities during the 
COVID health crisis; even as they continued 
to fight fires, handle emergency health situa-
tions, and keep our communities safe. 
That is why I ask my colleagues to join me 
in honoring our first responders, and their 
service and sacrifice to our communities. We 
owe them all a great debt of gratitude.

CELEBRATING MR. ARLIN 
PATTERSON’S 95TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. MO BROOKS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Arlin Patterson on the 
occasion of his 95th birthday. 
Arlin Patterson, or Pat, as he is lovingly 
called, was born on November 28, 1925 in 
Memphis, Tennessee. At eighteen, he grad-
uated from Messick High School and enrolled 
at Memphis State College. Shortly after, World 
War II interrupted his education and on Janu-
ary 7, 1944, Pat was drafted into the U.S. 
Navy. 
Pat began his training as a signalman in 
Samson, New York. He went on to serve as 
the personal signalman to two Commodores 
on the USS Flint and served on the maiden 
voyage of the USS Amsterdam. While serving 
on the USS Amsterdam, he participated in the 
shelling of Tokyo, Honshu, Muroran, and 
Hokkaido. Finally, on September 2, 1945, the 
USS Amsterdam arrived in Tokyo Bay and 
was moored next to the USS Missouri, where 
the surrender of Japan took place just the day 
before. 
After the war, Pat returned to Memphis 
State College and, in 1950, graduated with 
honors in Business Administration. While 
there, Pat also served as the President to the 
Phi Kappa Alpha Fraternity and was nomi-
nated to Who’s Who in American Colleges 
and Universities—the highest honor that can 
be bestowed on a Memphis State College stu-
dent. 
After college, Pat worked as a salesman 
and actively served in The Exchange Club, 
Memphis Sales Managers Club, and the Chil-
dren’s Health Center. He went on to receive 
the Distinguished Service Award in 1951 and 
1953. Later in his life, Pat opened his own 
business, Business Products, Incorporated, 
and in 2011, the Memphis City Council pro-
claimed April 16th the Mr. Pat Patterson Day 
in honor of his exemplary service during World 
War II. 
Pat and his wife, Joyce, have always been 
active in their local church, where Pat served 
as an usher, Sunday School teacher, and fi-
nancial leader of the church. In 2018, Pat and 
Joyce, moved to Huntsville, Alabama and be-
came involved with Honored Legacies for Vet-
erans. As a result, the Madison, Alabama Ro-
tary Club presented Pat with the Veteran of 
the Week honor in the newspaper. 
Madam Speaker, Pat Patterson’s work ethic, 
mental and physical stamina, and passion for 
service embody the ‘‘greatest generation.’’ 
I wish Pat and his entire family the very best 
as they celebrate Pat’s 95th birthday.

IN RECOGNITION OF GEORGE 
CATHEY 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and commend George 
Cathey for his distinguishing and exemplar 
service during the Revolutionary War. George 
Cathey was a volunteer soldier that, like many 
of our soldiers today, embodied the courage 
and bravery that is reflected in our American 
spirit. 
George Cathey served three times in the 
Revolutionary War; first as a Private, and later 
as both a Lieutenant and Captain. He fought 
in the skirmishes at Big Bear Town, Silver 
Creek and Ransoms Ford, and later in the 
battle of Cowpens. 
When this Nation’s freedom was secure, 
George Cathey was later granted a pension in 
1833 while living in Cooper County, Missouri, 
with his wife Margaret and their ten children. 
George Cathey later died on December 14, 
1840, at age 85. However, his legacy lives on 
through our enduring freedoms that we still 
maintain today. 
As we approach our Nation’s 250th Birth-
day, it is only fitting that we honor those who 
fought for our freedom. George Cathey is one 
of those soldiers and today, we honor his leg-
acy of freedom we all enjoy.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
BEN JONES 
HON. BILL HUIZENGA 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the life of Ben Jones, 
a beloved high school football coach at 
Cranbrook Kingswood High School, who re-
cently passed away at the age of 30 in a traf-
fic accident. 
Ben went to Muskegon Catholic Central 
High School, where he played football, basket-
ball, baseball and track. He led his football 
team to a state championship as a senior in 
2008. While at Central Catholic, Ben found his 
favorite motto, ‘‘Get To.’’ Every day, Ben 
would tell his teammates how they ‘get to’ play 
football today. Ben went on to play football at 
Hillsdale College. His teammates remember 
him as the hardest worker on the field, a great 
teammate and an even better friend. 
Not surprisingly, Ben was also a great foot-
ball coach. His players knew him as not only 
someone who understood the game, but 
someone who knew how to lead and loved his 
players. The players know that Coach Jones 
cared about their lives at home, how they 
were doing in school, and how they were de-
veloping as men. 
‘‘Get To’’ wasn’t just a motto to Ben. It was 
how he lived his life. He attacked each day 
with enthusiasm, hope and excitement. The 
Muskegon Catholic Central, Hillsdale College, 
and Cranbrook communities have lost a dear 
friend and mentor. He will be greatly missed. 
My Prayers go out to Ben’s parents, The-
resa and Bruce Jones, his sister Alissa, his 
brother Nate, his extended family, his friends, 
and the countless others who will mourn for 
him. 
Madam Speaker, I join with those through-
out Michigan in remembering the extraordinary 
life and legacy that Coach Jones has left be-
hind.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
OF 
MRS. 
BERNICE 
TODD 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with profound joy, deep admiration, and 
endless blessings to recognize the 100th birth-
day of Mrs. Bernice Todd. One cannot tell the 
story of America without telling the story of 
Kansas City Jazz, and one cannot tell the 
story of Kansas City Jazz without telling the 
story of Bernice Todd. 
Mrs. Bernice Todd was born September 8, 
1920, and has made significant contributions 
to the Jazz music and culture of the 18th and 
Vine District of Kansas City. She performed 
with many of the big bands and Jazz greats of 
her day, both as a stellar singer and as a 
skilled dancer. However, Jazz was not only a 
career for Mrs. Todd. It was also a family af-
fair. Her husband, Oliver Todd, was a trumpet 
player and bandleader who would go on to be-
come a fixture of the burgeoning Jazz scene 
in Kansas City, playing with everyone from 
Count Basie to Duke Ellington. And when a 
certain young virtuoso named Charlie Parker 
still carried his makeshift horn in a cloth sack, 
he would often come over to the Todds’ home 
to eat lunch and play some music. Mrs. Todd 
was actually just one week younger than the 
Bird, and the three of them became close 
friends. Often, Parker would leave his horn in 
their living room and ask them to bring it to his 
performance the next night. Needless to say, 
the horn bought them free admission. 
Mrs. Todd is a mother, a grandmother, and 
a friend to many. She has also been a loyal 
member of the St. James United Methodist 
Church, where I was a pastor for thirty-seven 
years. From personal experience, I can attest 
that Mrs. Todd keeps us all laughing. Mrs. 
Todd is also a caretaker of our Jazz history, 
as well as our Jazz musicians, through her in-
volvement with the Coda Jazz Fund, which 
pays funeral and burial expenses for area 
Jazz musicians whose families cannot afford 
them. As I have said before, a gift is never 
truly received until you acknowledge the giver. 
Mrs. Todd has honored so many determined 
artists with that sacred acknowledgement as 
they enter the coda of their life. It is an honor 
to be able to acknowledge Mrs. Todd’s legacy 
while her chorus is in full swing. 
Since I began thinking about this momen-
tous occasion, there’s a song that’s been 
stuck in my head. It is from an old compilation 
of Jazz standards released December of 
1945, just a little over a year after I was born. 
The album sleeve must have weighed ten tons 
with heft of the names which graced it: Jay 
McShann, Nat ‘‘King’’ Cole, and of course, Oli-
ver Todd. The song, by McShann, with Mrs. 
Todd’s late husband on trumpet, is an instru-
mental version of an old standard. Neverthe-
less, I remember the lyrics well: ‘‘I used to 
walk in the shade,’’ it went, ‘‘With those blues 
on parade / But I’m not afraid / This rover 
crossed over / If I never have a cent / I’d be 
rich as Rockefeller / Gold dust at my feet / On 
the sunny side of the street.’’ 
Now, as we stand not only at Mrs. Todd’s 
centennial, but Charlie Parker’s as well, I can-
not help but reflect on our collective good for-
tune. We lost the Bird in ’55, but God has 
generously allowed us a full century of Ber-
nice. For that, I am immensely grateful. 
Madam Speaker, please join me, the world of 
Jazz, and everyone in Missouri’s Fifth Con-
gressional District in wishing Mrs. Bernice 
Todd a happy 100th birthday. Here’s to many 
more years, Mrs. Todd, ‘‘on the sunny side of 
the street.’’

PEG FITZGERALD 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
provide my warmest congratulations and 
thanks to Peg Fitzgerald, a long-time resident 
and public servant in the State of Connecticut, 
who is retiring on October 1st after more than 
42 years of service to our state. Like so many 
other citizens of our great state, I had the 
privilege to interact with Peg in government 
and had a front-row seat to watch her skillful 
use of shrewd intelligence, empathy and 
humor to advance the public interest in what-
ever role she took on. I first met Peg when I 
was an intern at the State Capitol for then- 
State Representative Sam Gejdenson in 1978 
when Peg first went to work at the State 
Budget Office under Governors Ella Grasso 
and William O’Neill. Despite being a young 
woman given the weighty task of securing leg-
islative support for the Governor’s budget, she 
did not back down and could go toe-to-toe 
with the crustiest older male legislators and 
yet still make them laugh at her sharp Irish 
wit. When she would walk into Sam’s com-
mittee room, he would yell, ‘‘Hey Irish, what’s 
going on?’’ and the two of them would start 
busting each other, leaving all of us in stitch-
es. It was like watching a sitcom. 
Seriously though, during her twelve years at 
the State Capitol, Peg worked with legislative 
leaders on both sides of the aisle, crafting 
compromises and ultimately promoting bills 
that would advance the health and welfare of 
citizens of the State of Connecticut. She pro-
vided training, guidance, and supervision to 
dozens of state agencies and their staff at the 
state Capitol in their own advocacy efforts for 
the Executive Branch. 
In 1990, Peg joined the Connecticut Hous-
ing Finance Authority, bringing with her out-
standing expertise in the legislative process 
and a passion for affordable housing. In her 
thirty years at CHFA, Peg has continuously 
fought for the underserved, and taught dozens 
of employees what it means to be a true pub-
lic servant. 
For Peg, service to others never stopped at 
the office. When Peg wasn’t at the Capitol, 
she often dedicated her time to organizing 
food drives or donations for local hunger relief 
organizations or finding homes for animals in 
need of adoption, including her own, many 
times over. 
Peg Fitzgerald—through four decades—has 
been the embodiment of public service, show-
ing a uncompromising commitment to the pub-
lic good, a passion for the democratic process 
and a dogged determination to help those 
most in need. 
I thank Peg for her service to the State of 
Connecticut and offer best wishes to her on 
her well-deserved retirement.

Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today

well-earned retirement after an extraordinary

Karole grew up in Gooding, Idaho and grad-

gree in radio-TV, communications. Shortly 
after graduation she married her husband, 
Ken. They have been happily married for forty 
years. 
Karole started her career at KPVI in Poca-
tello. After seven years, she left KPVI to raise 
her three sons. In 1990 Jay Hildebrandt called 
and asked her to fill in as an anchor for 6 
weeks while another anchor was on maternity 
leave. Those 6 weeks turned into thirty years 
of co-anchoring with Jay Hildebrandt. Together

they were an iconic news team that the com-
munity trusted. 
In addition to her role at KIFI with Jay, 
Karole mentored new journalists who were 
getting started in the industry. She also spent 
fourteen years as an adjunct instructor at 
Idaho State University. She has served as a 
member of the advisory board for the School 
of Journalism and Mass Media in the College 
of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences at the 
University of Idaho. She continues to reach 
out to students interested in television news, 
informing them of internship opportunities and 
job openings at her station and elsewhere. 
Karole has served on several community 
boards and committees. As an active member 
of her community, Karole is committed to leav-
ing this area better than she found it. 
It has been my privilege to be interviewed 
by Karole throughout my political career. Even 
though we were friends she didn’t hold back 
the tough questions. I have always appre-
ciated her honesty and fairness. 
Madam Speaker, Karole Honas has pro-
vided an immeasurable service to Eastern 
Idaho for the last thirty years. I want to thank 
her for that service and wish her well in a well- 
earned retirement.

IN APPRECIATION OF MAJOR AN-
DREW CROWE FOR HIS SERVICE 
TO THE UNITED STATES HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
HON. MICHAEL WALTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, today I recog-
nize Major Andrew Joseph Crowe of the 
United States Army for his extraordinary dedi-
cation to duty and service to our Nation. Major 
Crowe recently transitioned from his assign-
ment as an Army Congressional Liaison in the 
House of Representatives to attend Army 
Command and General Staff College with fol-
low on assignment at Fort Belvoir. 
MAJ Crowe, having grown up in a non-mili-
tary family, joined the Reserve Officers Train-
ing Corps through Western Michigan Univer-
sity and commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in 
2006. He has held numerous leadership posi-
tions in a variety of units, highlighted by com-
bat service in Iraq and Afghanistan with the 
25th Infantry Division and the 75th Ranger 
Regiment. During his time in Washington, MAJ 
Crowe attended The George Washington Uni-
versity earning his Masters Degree in Legisla-
tive Affairs and served as a Congressional 
Fellow for Congressman JOE WILSON of South 
Carolina. 
In the winter of 2017, MAJ Crowe was se-
lected to serve as a Congressional Liaison in 
the United States Army House Liaison Divi-
sion. As the primary liaison between Members 
of the House of Representatives, their Staffs, 
Committees, and the Army, he provided in-
sight and understanding of Army policies, ac-
tions, operations, and requirements. His first- 
hand knowledge of the military, its culture, and 
traditions has been a tremendous benefit to 
Congressional offices. His wit and humor kept 
everyone around him in good spirits and kept 
me on my toes. As a busy freshman office 
with great ambition, our legislative successes 
would not have been possible without him. 
In 2019, I had traveled with MAJ Crowe to 
Normandy France for the 75th Anniversary of 
D-Day. It was a historically significant event in 
which MAJ Crowe planned and executed the 
largest overseas CODEL in history. 
Madam Speaker, it has been a pleasure to 
work with MAJ Crowe during his time as an 
Army Congressional Liaison Officer in the 
House of Representatives. On behalf of a 
grateful Nation, it is my honor to recognize the 
selfless service and sacrifice of Major Andrew 
Crowe, his wife, Michelle, and their children, 
Charlie and Samantha. I wish them the very 
best as they continue their journey in the 
United States Army. They have dedicated their 
lives to the service of our Nation.

REMEMBERING JACK L. LOVEALL 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of Jack L. Loveall. 
Affectionately known as ‘‘Captain Jack’’, he 
led a life best defined as that of a loving family 
man, mentor, humanitarian, and labor leader 
of over 60 years. Jack embodied the American 
dream and will be remembered as a legendary 
figure in the cause of justice and fairness for 
working people and their families. 
Born on Leap Day, February 29, 1936, Jack 
earned his first job at the age of 13 when he 
was hired by Wrigley Markets in Detroit as a 
grocery clerk. In 1958 Jack became a Union 
Representative for Local 876, beginning his 
storied work as an advocate for the American 
worker. His dedication to that mission led his 
colleagues to repeatedly select him as their 
representative in the upper echelons of the 
International Union. As an international vice 
president of the United Food and Commercial 
Workers, he served working families through-
out the United States, Canada, Asia, and Eu-
rope. 
In 1984, Jack was elected president of 
UFCW 588-Northern California, where he con-
tinued his passionate and highly effective ad-
vocacy for the members of his Union, includ-
ing those who work in supermarkets, drug 
stores, pharmacies, food processing plants, 
wineries, distilleries, medical offices, and 
more. Jack lived in the spirit of ‘‘Solidarity 
Works,’’ which he established as the motto of 
his Union and continues as the motto of 
UFCW 8–Golden State, now led by his son, 
Jacques Loveall. 
Captain Jack was married to his first mate, 
Patricia, whom he adored for 67 years. He 
was the father of seven, a grandfather, a 
great-grandfather, and a beloved mentor and 
teacher to countless others. His memory and 
legacy will be kept alive by those who use his 
lessons and beliefs as guideposts to building 
better families, better communities, and a bet-
ter world while always being kind to one an-
other.

CELEBRATING MR. WILLIAM 
BOSHART’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. MO BROOKS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Mr. William Harvey 
Boshart on the occasion of his 100th birthday. 
Mr. Boshart was born in Marshall County, 
Alabama on September 24, 1920. As a child 
during the Great Depression, Harvey is thank-
ful he was able to finish his 1933 academic 
year. The local school system lacked funding 
to keep schools open but Harvey’s teacher, 
Dr. Collins, finished the school year without 
pay. Later, in 1934, Harvey worked to support 
his family at only 14 years old. 
In 1941, Harvey married Nina Hodges, 
which he considers to be ‘‘the best thing that 
ever happened to him.’’ As newlyweds, Mr. 
and Mrs. Boshart lived on a family member’s 
farm in Woodville. Alabama. Then in 1944, 
Harvey received notice he was drafted to 
serve in World War II. Thankfully, Harvey was 
able to spend Christmas with his family, but in 
January of 1945, Mr. Boshart was officially 
sworn into the U.S. Navy and began training 
in California. 
Harvey was first assigned to the USS Men-
ard (APA–201), a Haskell-class attack trans-
port, on which he sailed to Pearl Harbor to 
train for the invasion of Okinawa, Japan. After 
months of training and active evasion of Japa-
nese submarine screens, on March 16, Sea-
man First Class Boshart and the crew reached 
the Leyte Gulf in the Philippines to begin the 
campaign to retake Okinawa. 
Later in his career, Harvey was assigned to 
the second USS San Jacinto (CVLS–30), on 
which President George H.W. Bush served. 
Once the war and his service were over, Har-
vey came home to Nina, and in 1947, they 
bought a farm in Rainsville, Alabama. From 
1951 to 1980, Harvey served in a different ca-
pacity on Redstone Arsenal. Today, Harvey 
still lives in the same home he and Nina pur-
chased in 1955, where he takes great pride in 
cooking and tending to his garden. 
Madam Speaker, the Tennessee valley is 
fortunate to have such an exemplary citizen 
for 100 years. Harvey Boshart’s bright spirit 
and servants’ heart are a blessing to us all. 
I wish Harvey and his entire family the very 
best as they celebrate Harvey’s centennial 
birthday.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DANIEL C. 
HOLLOWAY 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
with great sorrow to honor the life and long 
career of public service of City Council Mem-
ber Daniel C. Holloway of La Puente, CA. 
Dan was an outstanding leader for his com-
munity of La Puente, where he served in 
many capacities over the years. He was a 
local activist fighting to keep Workman High 
School open and was a writer of community 
news with his column in the Highlander News-
paper called, ‘‘The La Puente Lookout.’’ Dan 
was on the planning commission, where he 
served as Chairman twice, and he had been 
on the City Council for the past 13 years re-
ceiving the highest vote total of any council 
member multiple times. He served as Mayor 
three times and Mayor Pro Tern four times. 
Dan was a staunch advocate for his city serv-
ing on many regional boards and commis-
sions, including the San Gabriel Valley Council 
of Governments and the National League of 
Cities. 
Dan was a hero to our country having 
served in the Navy. He would later join the 
American Legion, and he designed the La 
Puente Veterans Memorial at La Puente City 
Hall. 
Dan was a mentor to many and a great 
champion of our students. Most recently, Dan 
participated in the Life Experiences About De-
mocracy (LEAD) program which teaches com-
munity and civic engagement by giving stu-
dents real life experiences participating in gov-
ernment meetings, interacting with public offi-
cials, and working on volunteer projects in La 
Puente. 
Dan was a great friend to me and so many 
who knew and respected him. I met Dan be-
fore he ran for office when he was a con-
stituent advocating for improvements to our 
schools, healthcare system, and public serv-
ices on behalf of his children, including his late 
daughter Kimberly, and all of our children. He 
was known for his kindness, honesty, and in-
tegrity, and that is why he was beloved by so 
many. 
Madam Speaker, I extend my deepest sym-
pathies to Dan’s wife of over 50 years Hilda, 
his children Jennifer, Christopher, and Shan-
non, his family and friends, and his col-
leagues. The City of La Puente has lost one 
of its greatest leaders and champions. And we 
have all lost a great friend. 
IN RECOGNITION OF KAREN 
HARBIN 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 15, 2020 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Karen Harbin on her recent 
election to the Board of Directors of the Na-
tional Association of Federally-Insured Credit 
Unions (NAFCU). 
Karen is the President/CEO of Common-
wealth Credit Union, which has branches in 
Kentucky’s Second District. A Certified Public 
Accountant, Karen is a past chair of the Ken-
tucky Credit Union League’s Board of Direc-
tors and is the current Treasurer. She is cur-
rently serving a 3rd term as the Governor’s 
appointee to the Kentucky Department of Fi-
nancial Institutions Board. Karen has served 
on the Federal Reserve Bank’s Community 
Depository Institutions Advisory Council and 
VolCorp’s Asset Liability Management Com-
mittee. Passionate about health, Karen chairs 
her local American Heart Association’s Heart 
Walk and is a member of the Corporate Coun-
cil of the Shriners Hospital Lexington. 
Karen’s vision and decision-making skills 
will be a valuable addition to the NAFCU 
Board and credit unions for years to come. I 
wish her the best of luck in her new role on 
the NAFCU Board of Directors, and I look for-
ward to working with her.

cludes, in the annual report, a description of how el-
igible entities will continue to make improvements 
toward increasing diversity and decreasing racial or 
socioeconomic isolation in covered schools and sus-
tain inclusion; Cooper (No. 5) that gives school dis-
tricts that had previously submitted an application 
under the Obama-era program before it was termi-
nated priority to reapply to this new program; 
Escobar (No. 7) that modifies the application section 
to require information on how eligible entities pro-
pose to use grant funds to support interventions to

required to establish the lead applicant and how 
grant funds will be divided among school districts 
to address racial and socioeconomic segregation in 
schools; Green (TX) (No. 8) that recommends re-
placing entrance exams and competitive application 
procedures with other methods to promote racial and 
socioeconomic diversity; Moulton (No. 10) that adds

learning as a performance measure for the grant pro-
gram; students attending racially isolated, high-pov-
erty schools have less access to resources, and school 
integration will help foster equitable access to re-
sources; Mucarsel-Powell (No. 11) that ensures that 
planning grants to address racial and socioeconomic 
isolation in schools can be used to increase teacher 
diversity; and Tlaib (No. 12) that includes a require-

must include in its annual report information on the
