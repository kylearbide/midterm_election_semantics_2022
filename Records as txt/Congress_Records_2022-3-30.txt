RECOGNIZING JIM TUMAN AND 
JIMMY’S KIDS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the outstanding 
work of Jim Tuman and the volunteers 
behind Jimmy’s Kids, an organization 
that serves the families of Wayne 
County, including the community and 
neighborhood I grew up in, southwest 
Detroit. 
In 1988, Jim Tuman, a youth advo-
cate and motivational speaker, was 
simply trying to make the Christmas 
holiday special for 22 special-needs 
children. He coordinated an ad hoc pro-
gram to provide the children with holi-
day gifts. 
The Jimmy’s Kids organization now 
serves thousands of children all across 
metro Detroit. Jimmy’s Kids proudly 
partners with local groups and church-
es to set up gift-giving, not just during 
the holiday, but year-round, for chil-
dren in need. 
Countless families can count on their 
Christmas Day gift distribution pro-
gram, an event I happily volunteer for 
during the holidays. 
Please join me in recognizing Jim 
Tuman and the volunteers at Jimmy’s 
Kids for their outstanding work on be-
half of the families of metro Detroit 
and Michigan’s 13th District Strong. 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF PATRICIA HARRIS 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of commu-
nity advocate Patricia Harris, a resi-
dent of Westland in Michigan’s 13th 
District Strong who suddenly passed 
away earlier this year, shocking our 
close community. 
Pat was engaged on a number of 
issues but was mostly known for her 
big heart and infectious smile. She was 
a loving daughter, sister, aunt, and 
friend. 
Pat stood up for the values she be-
lieved in and always met challenges 
with positivity and a can-do attitude. 
She cared deeply for our community 
and fought relentlessly for justice and 
a better quality of life for all. 
The loss of our Pat left an impact on 
all who knew her. Please join me in re-
membering Patricia Harris for the love 
of her community as we mourn her 
loss. 
LAUNCHING THE BIPARTISAN GET THE LEAD OUT 
CAUCUS 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to officially announce the launch 
of the bipartisan Get the Lead Out 
Caucus, which I started along with my 
colleagues Congressman MEIJER, Con-
gresswoman DINGELL, and Congress-
woman BLUNT ROCHESTER. 
Water contaminated by lead service 
lines can be found in every single con-
gressional district around the Nation. 
From rural areas to densely populated 
cities, lead service lines are widespread 
and pose serious health risks to us all, 
but particularly our children. 
Lead in water is a public health cri-
sis, and the only solution is to fully 
eliminate lead service lines altogether. 
Clean, affordable drinking water is a 
human right. 
While communities in Michigan like 
Flint, Wayne, Hamtramck, and Benton 
Harbor have made headlines for their 
lead-related crises, lead-contaminated 
drinking water affects every part of 
our Nation. 
I commend the Biden administration 
for taking steps to get the lead out of 
our water, but we must continue to 
fight until lead is fully removed from 
water 
systems 
across 
the 
United 
States. 
TIME TO DECRIMINALIZE MARIJUANA 
Ms. 
TLAIB. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
as 
someone who grew up in a community 
on the front line of the racist so-called 
war on drugs, I am proud to stand here 
today in support of the MORE Act to 
finally decriminalize marijuana and ex-
punge marijuana-related convictions. 
The war on drugs was designed as a 
racist project to target our Black and 
Brown communities. The obvious ra-
cial disparities in enforcement show us 
that it still is, at its core, an effort tar-
geting communities of color through 
overpolicing, criminalization, and mass 
incarceration. 
The MORE Act will increase access 
to Federal benefits and establish a fund 
to redirect resources into communities 
harmed by the war on drugs. This is a 
good start on the road to repairing the 
damage, but we still have work to do. 
We must be bold. Our goal must be to 
end this country’s militarized ‘‘jail

addiction and to stop trying to solve 
social problems with more criminaliza-
tion. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues 
to support the MORE Act. This is a 
commonsense bill. 
FUNDING COMMUNITY PROJECTS 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of the recent pas-
sage of the omnibus bill, which in-
cluded over $15 million in funding for 
local community projects in 13 District 
Strong. 
From funding for work-based learn-
ing programs in Wayne-Westland Com-
munity Schools to a senior wellness 
center in Inkster, Michigan, I know 
that these direct dollars will have an 
enormous impact on the lives of my 
residents. 
The 
13th 
Congressional 
District, 
Madam Speaker, is the third-poorest 
congressional district in the Nation, 
and these are important efforts to help 
the most vulnerable among us. 
The Boys and Girls Club of South-
eastern Michigan, which is the oldest 
in the Nation, will be funded for im-
provements to the Fauver-Martin Club 
in Highland Park. It will empower so 
many of our young people. 
The Urban Neighborhood Initiative 
for the Southwest Detroit Creative 
Connections Collaborative will also be 
able to employ high-speed broadband 
and build community space for our 
young people. 
Enterprise Community Partners will 
also fund the Detroit Energy Efficiency 
and Home Improvement Program to 
provide energy-efficient home repairs 
and so much more. 
f 
TAXING OUR FARMERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, since the founding of our Na-
tion, American farms have been at the 
bedrock of our economy. 
Our farmers, growers, and ranchers 
produce the dairy, wheat, corn, apples, 
and peaches that we have relied on for 
generations to feed our families, our 
neighbors, and the world. 
There are over 52,000 farms across the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and 
the struggles that affect them affect 
each and every one of us. 
Right now, our farmers are facing so 
many difficult challenges. The cost to 
run a farm is estimated to grow by 
nearly 7 percent next year. To make 
matters even worse, the cost of fer-
tilizer has already risen by over 50 per-
cent in the past 12 months. Now, the 
Biden administration is preparing to 
implement new taxes on fertilizer im-
ports from overseas. 
Now is not the time to tax our farm-
ers even more. President Biden cannot 
use our growers and producers to pay 
for his out-of-control budget. 
We need to ensure that our farmers 
have the resources that they need to 
continue producing the food that each 
of us relies on every day. We need to 
make sure that they have the fer-
tilizer, the grain, and the seeds that it 
takes to work a farm or to tend an or-
chard. 
American farmers feed the world. It 
is time to stop imposing new and crip-
pling taxes on our hardworking farm-
ers. It is time to let them get back to 
work on feeding all of us. 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S FAR-LEFT SPENDING 
PROPOSAL 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, on Monday, President Biden 
laid out his budget for the coming 
year, a budget that contains $73 tril-
lion in spending, $58 trillion in taxes, 
and over $16 trillion in debt. 
When he unveiled this far-left spend-
ing proposal, President Biden said that 
a budget is a statement of values. How-
ever, by failing to mention our border 
security, by tacking on billions of dol-
lars for environmental justice, and by 
stripping out the Hyde amendment, 
President Biden has delivered to the 
American people a budget that does 
not share our values. 
We need a budget that protects the 
border. We need a budget that stops the 
flow of illegal drugs, like fentanyl, into 
our communities. We need a budget 
that promotes American energy in the 
face of egregious Russian aggression. 
We need a budget that defends all 
human life. 
We don’t need this socialist spending 
spree; we don’t need $58 trillion in 
taxes; and we certainly do not need $16 
trillion in new debt that mortgages the 
future of our children. 
f 
CONSERVATIVES HELPING PUTIN 
IN WAR AGAINST UKRAINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, as 
we stand here on the House floor, 
Ukrainians are bravely defending their 
country against an illegal invasion by 
Russian forces ordered by Vladimir 
Putin. 
We have seen hospitals attacked and 
mothers and children crushed by the 
rubble. We have seen civilians fleeing 
this tragic conflict via humanitarian 
corridors, agreed to by the Russian 
Government, 
attacked 
by 
Russian 
troops. We have seen a theater-turned- 
shelter, 
with 
the 
word 
‘‘children’’ 
clearly displayed, reduced to rubble. 
The blood of all of these innocents 
lost in this senseless war is on the 
hands of one man: Vladimir Putin. 
Ukrainians are standing up to this 
tyrant. They are fighting to stop the 
advance of an autocratic leader who 
has launched an illegal, premeditated 
invasion. 
Yet, if you listen to certain promi-
nent voices, you will hear some con-
servative 
leaders 
not 
condemning 
Vladimir Putin’s war, not praising the 
heroism 
of 
Ukrainian 
President 
Zelenskyy, 
Ukrainian 
troops, 
and 
Ukrainian citizens. No, they are in-
stead lauding the so-called genius of a 
violent, power-hungry dictator. 
There is a term we use in politics for 
people who propagandize for a cause 
whose goals they don’t understand and 
who are then used by the cause’s lead-
ers: useful idiots. 
I will not purport to know if the indi-
viduals who are praising Putin and 
spreading 
misinformation 
genuinely 
believe their own words, but I do know 
that Putin finds them useful. 
There is a concerningly long list of 
American 
conservatives 
who 
have 
turned themselves into Putin’s useful 
idiots. When the invasion first began, 
one host claimed on his news show that 
Ukraine was not a democracy. This is 
the very same lie that Putin himself 
has used in the effort to justify his in-
vasion of Ukraine. In fact, these com-
ments were aired on Russian state tele-
vision, and a member of the Russian 
Defense Ministry’s public council said 
these remarks were excellent. 
Another conservative voice has used 
her platform to criticize Zelenskyy and 
echo Russian propaganda, including a 
Kremlin talking point that Russians 
created Ukraine, which has been used 
to justify this invasion. Her social 
media posts have been amplified and 
shared by other Russian accounts. 
Even our own former President has 
praised Putin, calling the horrific inva-
sion of Ukraine ‘‘genius.’’ A Member of 
this 
very 
body 
called 
President 
Zelenskyy a ‘‘thug’’ and the Ukrainian 
Government ‘‘incredibly evil.’’ 
Exactly 2 weeks ago, every Member 
of this body had an opportunity to hear 
from President Zelenskyy directly as 
he joined us virtually from Ukraine’s 
capital. His bravery and courage were 
on full display. He is a hero. 
Vladimir Putin is a thug, and the re-
peating of these lies by American 
voices is playing into his hands. Aiding 
Putin in this way is not just disturbing 
because of the role it plays in enabling 
his messaging of this premeditated in-
vasion; it also speaks to a broader 
trend among some American conserv-
atives toward sympathizing with auto-
crats that should worry us all. 
Last year, I spoke before this body to 
condemn conservative American pun-
dits 
who 
were 
praising 
Hungarian 
Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Like 
Putin, Orban is an autocratic leader 
who wields strict control of the media, 
restricts LGBTQ rights, and suppresses 
free speech. At that time, I expressed 
my concern at what this may indicate 
about the growing sympathy for auto-
crats in our own country. Unfortu-
nately, this latest trend of praising 
Putin and condemning Zelenskyy tells 
me the slide toward autocracy con-
tinues. 
Praise for autocratic leaders and 
what they represent is dangerous. At a 
time when political polarization has 
reached new heights and American vul-
nerability to misinformation is in-
creasing, we cannot afford to watch 
anyone of influence, whether they be a

Member, or a member of the media, 
peddle in propaganda. 
Conservatives should shake off the 
role of useful idiots and present Putin, 
this war, and all demagogic leaders as 
what they truly are. 
Vladimir Putin has poisoned journal-
ists and jailed his opposition. He has 
bombed hospitals and schools. He has 
slaughtered innocents in Syria. Today, 
he is murdering civilians in Ukraine. 
If this has not been enough for these 
useful idiots and their ilk, I urge them 
to find the red line Putin would have to 
cross. 
To the puppets that are on our 
screens, our social media, and in the 
Halls of Congress perpetrating his lies, 
I say: Enough. You are helping Putin in 
this war. You are helping him strip 
Ukrainians of their freedom. You are 
helping our own country slide further 
from democracy. 
Lincoln reminded us that we cannot 
escape history, that we will be remem-
bered in spite of ourselves. In the end, 
history will remember those who stood 
up for the truth and the cowards who 
did not.

b 1015 
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, it is un-
deniable that religious freedom is 
America’s keystone. This great coun-
try was founded by men and women 
who fled religious persecution and 
sought to govern themselves according 
to their religious beliefs. 
Despite 
religious 
freedom 
having 
been woven into our constitutional sys-
tem for well over two centuries, and 
the 
precedents 
it 
has 
established, 
Democrats are choosing to play judge, 
jury, and executioner in its trial. 
Today, religious organizations are 
under attack by the woke agenda of 
Democrats. Those on the left claim 
that faith-based organizations must 
abandon their conscience and amend 
their employment practices, or they 
should not have access to Federal con-
tracts or funds. 
It is a damning ultimatum. Imagine 
how many faith-based organizations 
would be forced to close their doors be-
cause of this. 
Madam Speaker, this coordinated 
campaign is being carried out by the 
left, and it is guided by the assumption 
that a radical, progressive dogma is 
more legitimate than religious beliefs. 
That assumption is pure insanity. 
In this country, faith is not sub-
jugated or left at the door. It is carried 
with us no matter where we may go. 
I applaud every man and woman who 
is standing up to this egregious assault 
from the left and is fighting for the 
right to live by religious convictions at 
work and in business. 
President 
Biden’s 
so-called 
Build 
Back Better framework is riddled with 
discriminatory provisions. One clause 
would 
have 
required 
faith-based 
childcare providers to abandon their 
faith during program hours if they 
wanted to participate in the Federal 
program. 
And in the Community Services 
Block Grant program, the Democrats 
want to strip a provision that protects 
faith-based providers’ right to remain 
strong in their faith as they serve indi-
viduals in need. 
This protection has been in place 
without controversy or harm to any in-
dividual seeking assistance for decades. 
Why change it now? I think we know. 
This isn’t just religious persecution; 
it is textbook coercion. Unfortunately, 
there is more. 
Democrats have also sought to re-
move protections for religious non-
profit organizations and Federal con-
tractors. Like their secular counter-
parts, 
faith-based 
charities 
in 
the 
United States simply want to serve the 
less fortunate, but discriminatory leg-
islation could keep them from being 
able to do that. 
Faith-based charities and religious 
Federal contractors alike deserve the 
chance to practice their religion freely 
without government interference. 
It appears Democrats need a re-
fresher on the First Amendment. 
The government does not bestow the 
freedom of religion upon us; it is a free-
dom we have possessed since birth. 
Whenever we see protections for reli-
gious freedom being chipped away in 
this country, it is our solemn duty as 
Americans and people of faith to take a 
stand. 
f 
BUILDING A BETTER AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the impact 
the COMPETES Act will have on our 
Nation. 
We are seeing the best economy for 
American workers in decades, with 
people earning higher wages, better 
benefits, and better jobs, thanks to 
President Biden’s leadership. 
With that said, when I visited with 
the leadership from the Port of Hous-
ton in my district a while back, they 
expressed their gratitude for Congress’ 
strong investment in the maritime in-
frastructure needed to keep America’s 
economy moving in the right direction. 
They also expressed concern, how-
ever, that more workers will need tech-
nical training than our current system 
will be able to provide. 
The America COMPETES Act will be 
that critical next step in providing 
vital maritime workforce training. 
My home district, Texas-29, will ben-
efit greatly from the large grant pro-
gram for domestic maritime worker 
training and education included in the 
America COMPETES Act. 
I was proud to see this maritime 
grant program language included, as it 
was originally part of my bill, H.R. 987, 
which was one that was introduced to 
strengthen our maritime workforce. 
This investment will provide more 
Houston area workers the technical 
training, 
education, 
and 
resources 
needed to become qualified for good- 
paying maritime jobs. 
For example, the San Jacinto College 
Maritime Center in my district helps 
thousands of students learn new skills 
so they can earn good paychecks, pay-
checks that hold families together. 
Located just outside of Houston, the 
San Jacinto College Maritime Program 
offers maritime training and deck-level 
coursework for all professional mari-
ners. 
They 
cover 
everything 
from 
entry-level deckhands on an inland 
towboat to unlimited tonnage masters 
on the world’s largest ships. 
The COMPETES Act will empower 
the maritime grant program that will 
directly benefit this community col-
lege; more workers for maritime work. 
But like the San Jacinto Community 
College in my district, there are also 
similar training centers across the Na-
tion that will benefit. The COMPETES 
Act will help thousands of students 
learn new skills so they can provide 
comfortably for their families and live 
a good life with good benefits. 
This is another way the America 
COMPETES Act will strengthen our 
supply chains. While there will be plen-
ty of large-scale improvements across 
the Nation, there will also be many 
local governments like this in our 
hometowns that will benefit. 
I look forward to President Biden 
signing this bill into law. And this is 
yet, Madam Speaker, another example 
of how we are building a better Amer-
ica for generations to come. 
f 
RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT 
SPENDING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, this 
morning, I wish to address the Amer-
ican people and thank them for their 
hard work and their outstanding effort 
that funds our government and our Ac-
tive Duty military personnel and vet-
erans who have kept us safe, our law 
enforcement, our first responders, and 
all those who go to work every day 
making sure we are safe in our commu-
nities, safe in our Nation, and safe 
around the world. 
I also want to thank all the people 
that go to work every day to earn a liv-
ing and support their families. And, 
yes, those are the people, all of them, 
that provide the revenue by which 
America can operate, something I 
think President Biden has forgotten. 
He has been in Washington, D.C., for 
half a century, and he proposed a budg-
et earlier this week that spends $73 
trillion over the next 10 years and in-
creases our national debt by 50 percent 
by the year 2032. Under that budget, 
the debt will be $45 trillion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3976 
March 30, 2022 
And to say what the President said, a 
budget will show you your values. Well, 
evidently, he doesn’t value our next 
generation. 
We all want our children to do better 
than we did and have it better than we 
did. How can they do that when he pro-
poses to saddle them with so much 
debt? 
When you look at the national debt 
that we have, it is held by the public, 
it is held by foreign governments, and 
some of it is called intragovernmental 
debt, which means it is debt that is 
held by other government agencies. 
The Social Security Administration 
holds about 13 percent of our debt cur-
rently. I think this budget puts our 
seniors at risk and their ability to live 
a good life in retirement on a program 
which they funded for so many years 
from their paychecks. 
So, we look at the budget. I have 
read through it. All these items should 
be a red flag for anybody that wants to 
support this. 
It is not supporting America’s values. 
It is not supporting our next genera-
tion. It is not helping our seniors. It is 
helping priorities laid forth by a man 
who has been in Washington, D.C., for 
50 years. 
Evidently, he has gotten used to 
spending more than what the revenue 
brings in in our country. 
I remember President Reagan. This 
is, I believe, the 41st anniversary of the 
assassination attempt. I think Presi-
dent Reagan, when someone would say, 
He is spending like a drunken sailor. 
Then the President would say, Well, at 
least the sailor is spending his own 
money. 
We are entrusted with the money 
that the government takes from the 
citizens of the United States. We need 
to use it responsibly. We need to invest 
it in their priorities and not in the pri-
orities of the people inside the beltway. 
I think he is too far out of touch, and 
quite frankly, there are a lot of things 
that we can’t afford. 
What we should be looking at is pro-
tecting life. We should be looking at 
being responsible so that our kids are 
not saddled with so much debt and that 
our seniors can retire and count on a 
program they funded their entire lives. 
We have already seen the real cost of 
President Biden’s tax-and-spend poli-
cies at the pump, in the grocery store, 
on the farm, and on Main Street Amer-
ica. 
It is time we stopped leaving a finan-
cial disaster for the next generation 
and put together a budget that meets 
the needs of the American people, not 
the needs of President Biden and 
Speaker PELOSI. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO FORMER 
CONGRESSMAN ESTEBAN TORRES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today as chair of the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus to pay tribute to a 
champion for Latinos and Latinas and 
a leader for all, the late CHC chair, 
Congressman Esteban Torres. 
He did everything in his power to in-
crease Hispanic representation in Con-
gress, dedicated himself to disenfran-
chised communities, and had an un-
wavering commitment to equity. 
Esteban Torres was born in Arizona 
in 1930 to a proud Mexican family of 
migrant and copper mine workers. 
After the deportation of his father 
through the disastrous Mexican Repa-
triation program, his family moved to 
east Los Angeles. Torres never saw his 
father again. 
As a self-proclaimed barrio kid, he 
grew up navigating the difficulties of a 
young Latino male without a father in 
Los Angeles, but that did not stop him 
from achieving excellence. 
From a young age, Torres was con-
sistently recognized as a peacemaker, 
consensus builder, and leader in his 
community. 
He knew that leadership meant serv-
ing. And when he turned 19, he enlisted 
in the U.S. Army and fought in the Ko-
rean war. 
Later in life, the necessities of rais-
ing a family pushed Torres to work as 
a welder on the assembly line at an 
auto plant. There, he became involved 
with the labor movement and assumed 
the role of chief steward in the United 
Auto Workers union’s local branch. 
His ability to lead, inspire, and de-
fend workers’ rights drove him to be-
come the Nation’s director of the Inter- 
American Bureau for Caribbean and 
Latin American Affairs, and so he 
began his political career. 
After serving under President Carter 
as U.S. Ambassador to the United Na-
tions Educational, Scientific, and Cul-
tural Organization, and as White House 
Special Assistant for Hispanic Affairs, 
Torres represented California’s 34th 
District, the City of Norwalk in the 
County of Los Angeles, from 1983 until 
1999. 
From his first year in Congress, he 
defended workers’ rights, protected 
consumers, 
advanced 
environmental 
justice, and secured veterans’ services. 
Through it all, he never forgot his 
community. As chair of the Congres-
sional Hispanic Caucus, he pushed for-
ward transformative legislation for im-
migrants in our country, such as the 
1986 Immigration Reform and Control 
Act. 
This historic legislation gave legal 
status to more than 3 million immi-
grants, ultimately protecting other 
families from the same horror his fam-
ily experienced many years back. 
Torres also led the CHC at a time 
when our communities did not have the 
representation we do today. After eight 
terms, he expressed: ‘‘I have reached 
the pinnacle of success in my own eyes. 
It is time to let the younger generation 
succeed.’’ 
b 1030 
Today, I succeed him as chair of the 
Congressional Hispanic Caucus, a role I 
take with much responsibility because 
I know I have big shoes to fill. 
Thanks to his efforts, our commu-
nities can feel seen in the 38 members 
of the CHC that, inspired by Congress-
man Torres, serve with determination 
and compassion. I know that we, in-
spired 
by 
the 
late 
Congressman 
Esteban Torres, carry the torch to ex-
pand Hispanic representation in Con-
gress and create a House and a Senate 
that is more representative of our Na-
tion. 
Esteban 
Torres, 
mentor, 
leader, 
amigo, after 91 years of touching lives 
and changing this Nation, in January 
2022 you passed away. You lived a long 
and impactful life of service, and you 
left this Nation better than how you 
found 
it 
for 
future 
generations. 
Gracias.

FARM KILLER TAX 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, in prep-
aration for reauthorizing the farm bill 
in 2023, I rise today to deliver the sixth 
installment of my farm bill impact se-
ries, where I am highlighting various 
aspects of the farm bill that deserve 
Congress’ awareness and support. For 
this legislation to be effective, it must 
support the efforts of both today’s 
farmers, ranchers, and agricultural 
producers, as well as those of the next 
generation. 
I had planned to get up on the floor 
today to talk about how America’s 
hope for food security in the future lies 
on the shoulders of young Americans 
who are voluntarily bearing the burden 
of feeding, fueling, and clothing the 
world. I was going to talk about all the 
great programs and organizations that 
we have in this country for young peo-
ple who are interested in agriculture. I 
was going to talk about the new Begin-
ning Farmer and Rancher Development 
Program through USDA, and the im-
portance of preserving the stepped-up 
basis in the Tax Code to ensure that 
family farms in America don’t get 
taxed out of existence. 
Then President Biden’s disastrous 
budget came out earlier this week. 
President Biden threatens the stepped- 
up basis yet again as we know it in the 
budget that he just released. If it be-
comes law, the food security and, 
therefore, national security of America 
hangs in the balance. 
Here is why the stepped-up basis ex-
ists and why it is so important. Let’s 
say you are a young person working on 
your family’s farm, and you are slowly 
taking on responsibility and risk. You 
work for your parents in the operation 
until the time comes for you to inherit 
the land, equipment, and livestock. 
When that happens, the Federal Gov-
ernment should not jump in and im-
pose taxes on the unrealized gain of 
your inherited land and assets. This 
principle is called the stepped-up basis, 
which has long been precedent in the 
Tax Code.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3977 
March 30, 2022 
The President’s budget imposes new 
capital gains taxes at death, which will 
kill family farms. This is appalling. 
America is trying to recover from a 
pandemic, and farmers, ranchers, and 
agricultural producers are struggling 
to survive as they cope with crises that 
this administration has caused, like 
the broken supply chain and rampant 
inflation. And now this administration 
wants to impose new taxes on these 
people? 
And the President didn’t stop there. 
His budget also includes a new capital 
gains tax that I am going to call the 
farm killer tax. In Biden’s budget, un-
believably, there is a proposal to im-
pose capital gains taxes on farms that 
have been in families for over 90 years. 
Think about that. In 1940, the average 
cost of Kansas farmland was $50 per 
acre. Now, irrigated land is over $4,000 
per acre. Imagine the capital gains tax 
implications in that history of owner-
ship. This proposal would impose hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars in new 
capital gains taxes on farmers, killing 
their businesses overnight. 
Again, I was going to stand here 
today and talk about how important it 
is for Congress to support farmers, par-
ticularly the men and women who op-
erate 
family-owned-and-operated 
multi-generational family farms. I was 
going to talk about how, in the name 
of supporting America’s incredible pro-
ducers, Congress needs to think care-
fully and critically about the programs 
we reauthorize in the 2023 farm bill. 
I didn’t expect that I would see the 
farm killer tax in the budget this week. 
This new tax is not a game-changer, it 
is a game-ender for thousands of family 
farms. I am, frankly, in disbelief. 
Farming is a multi-generational call-
ing. Farmers, ranchers, and ag pro-
ducers are my family and friends. They 
are America’s heroes, and the ideas in 
this budget, threatening the stepped-up 
basis and imposing the new farm killer 
tax, are going to destroy the liveli-
hoods of many in agriculture and make 
our country less secure. The President 
needs to wake up to reality. Farmers, 
ranchers, and agriculture producers 
have earned our support, and his budg-
et ideas are the opposite of that. They 
are a gut punch to the people who feed, 
fuel, and clothe this Nation. 
This week, I am introducing a bipar-
tisan resolution, along with 66 of my 
colleagues, that supports the preserva-
tion of the stepped-up basis, opposes 
any efforts to impose new taxes on 
family farms and small businesses, and 
recognizes the importance of genera-
tional transfers of farm and small busi-
ness operations. Again, this is some-
thing I was going to do anyway because 
of 
how 
important 
preserving 
the 
stepped-up 
basis 
is. 
Today, 
given 
Biden’s disastrous budget, this message 
is more important. 
If we want to invest in the future of 
our country, which I think we can all 
agree that we do, we need to invest in 
the next generation of America’s farm-
ers, ranchers, and ag producers. I will 
be back on the floor soon to deliver an-
other installment of my farm bill im-
pact series and highlight more pro-
grams and titles within the bill that 
Congress must understand and support 
to ensure that agriculture thrives in 
America. Hopefully, when I am stand-
ing here to speak next time, I won’t 
have to address any more ideas that 
this administration may have had for 
destroying the livelihoods of America’s 
farmers, ranchers, and ag producers. 
We must kill Biden’s farm killer tax. 
f 
STRENGTHENING OUR ECONOMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PORTER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, infla-
tion is a challenge for families. I feel it 
myself as a single mom raising three 
kids. Historically, the standard ap-
proaches to reduce inflation are to 
raise interest rates and to lower wages. 
Some people are calling for these same 
misguided approaches today. This is 
wrongheaded. 
Families 
need 
lower 
costs, not less money in their pockets. 
We can bring prices down by increas-
ing supply, for example, by expanding 
energy capacity with more green en-
ergy. The America COMPETES Act, 
which I supported, will strengthen our 
supply chains and increase our domes-
tic manufacturing of technology. 
We can also bring prices down by 
cracking down on corporate abuse. We 
can reduce healthcare costs by allow-
ing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, 
lower grocery costs by increasing com-
petition in the meatpacking industry, 
and stop Big Oil from price gouging. 
These policies will lower costs with-
out lowering wages. We can strengthen 
our capitalist economy and rein in in-
flation. Families need us to address in-
flation. They need lower costs, not 
lower wages. 
BUDGET CUTS LIMIT IRS 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, the 
IRS backlog is over 7 million tax re-
turns. That is unacceptable. On the 
Oversight and Reform Committee, I am 
holding the IRS accountable to elimi-
nate this backlog quickly. 
Families need their tax refunds to 
pay rent and buy food. Small business 
owners need their refunds to keep their 
doors open. It is their money, and the 
government should promptly return it. 
My office has helped Orange County 
residents cut through red tape and get 
answers from the IRS. We have helped 
nearly 500 taxpayers collectively re-
cover over half a million dollars. I am 
proud of these wins, but the solution 
here cannot be individual intervention. 
Years of budget cuts have limited the 
IRS’ ability to operate effectively and 
efficiently. 
IRS employees are working hard. I 
thank them. But the IRS needs re-
sources, and the taxpayers need assist-
ance. Every Congress Member should 
vote to fully fund the IRS. As a tax-
payer advocate, I will keep pushing to 
save taxpayers time and money. 
CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, Or-
ange County is leading the way on 
clean energy solutions. Businesses in 
our community are spearheading inno-
vative 
technologies 
to 
reduce 
our 
greenhouse gas emissions. These busi-
nesses represent the best of our capi-
talist economy. They create jobs and 
lead in innovation. I am proud to rep-
resent a district that ranks among the 
top five in the most clean energy jobs 
in the country. 
However, as Earth Day approaches, 
we must also recognize that these cut-
ting-edge businesses face an uneven 
playing field. Big Oil and gas compa-
nies have unfair tax breaks and other 
advantages that inhibit competition 
that we need for healthy capitalism. 
Long term, this will make it harder for 
our economy to stand up against our 
global competitors. 
The hard work of Orange County 
businesses that they are putting in to 
develop new and efficient methods of 
producing clean energy represents the 
best of our capitalist economy. To re-
main competitive, we have to lift up 
new and innovative technologies. 
CONGRATULATING NEAL KELLEY ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, free 
and fair elections are the bedrock of 
our democracy. Regardless of their ide-
ology, their identity, or where they 
live, all eligible voters should be able 
to cast their ballots freely and safely. 
In Orange County, the registrar of 
voters facilitates elections for more 
than 1.8 million registered voters. As 
chief election official in Orange Coun-
ty, Neal Kelley safeguarded equal ac-
cess to the ballot box and protected the 
integrity of our elections. He innovated 
to improve efficiency and reliability of 
voting, adopting technology that in-
creased transparency and voter turn-
out. 
He retired on March 10 after 17 years 
of remarkable service. Neal Kelley is a 
model public servant we can all learn 
from. On behalf of Orange County vot-
ers, I congratulate Mr. Kelley on his 
retirement and thank him for his serv-
ice to our democracy.

IOWA BUSINESSES INNOVATE 
DURING PANDEMIC 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak on an 
issue that has directly impacted busi-
nesses and farmers across Iowa’s Sec-
ond Congressional District. 
The last few years have been chal-
lenging for all of us. Manufacturing has 
been hit hard, with rising costs and 
supply chain disruptions impacting nu-
merous sectors of our economy. 
Although much of life has returned 
to normal since the pandemic began, 
the slow movement of goods through 
our economy is creating major head-
aches for American families. Empty

March 30, 2022 
shelves are becoming all too common 
at stores, goods from overseas are 
being 
delayed 
by 
weeks 
or 
even 
months, contributing to higher shelf 
prices, and we are facing an unprece-
dented supply chain crisis. 
Even though the administration and 
the Transportation Secretary don’t 
seem to know what to do about supply 
chain problems, our companies in Iowa 
do. In Iowa, agricultural producers are 
also feeling the crunch with their ca-
pacity for goods being hampered by a 
combination of surging demand for 
containerized shipping and a massive 
backlog at our Nation’s ports. This in-
efficiency has downstream effects on 
commodity prices, hurting farmers and 
ranchers across the country. 
As global competition has increased, 
control over our supply chain has fall-
en into the hands of fewer and fewer 
countries, most notably China. Such 
geographic concentration of supply 
chains has left many U.S. companies 
vulnerable to disruption, something we 
are now acutely experiencing. 
Vermeer Corporation in Pella has 
been working overtime to produce 
their famous yellow iron at a record 
pace 
despite 
supply 
chain 
issues. 
Vermeer has even gone above and be-
yond during this difficult time, work-
ing to help out their customers and 
partners. Last fall, a group of Vermeer 
team members, working at a supplier 
in Minnesota, worked for 6 weeks at 
their own cost away from their fami-
lies to make the harnesses necessary to 
keep that beautiful yellow iron moving 
out the doors. Vermeer did whatever 
was necessary to keep their job done 
despite the supply chain challenges 
they were facing. 
Kent Corporation, headquartered in 
Muscatine, is a family-owned corpora-
tion that manufactures several food 
and beverage products. They have faced 
supply chain issues similar to all com-
panies, but working mainly with agri-
cultural products, impairment in their 
industry adds on to the difficulties our 
agriculture producers and farmers face 
every day. All the while, our farmers 
continue to deal with increased input 
costs. 
CNH 
Industrial, 
located 
in 
Bur-
lington, their biggest facility by square 
footage in the United States, also faced 
supply chain issues. 
During our visit, we heard firsthand 
about their difficulty getting essential 
parts for their equipment, but their 
employees innovated and started pro-
ducing the much-needed stabilizer bar 
on their backhoes. It was not felt that 
this little part could be produced in the 
United States. It was being imported 
from Brazil. They designed, cut, and 
welded in 2 weeks in order to meet 
their customers’ needs. The industry 
did not think it could be done here in 
the United States. It was inspiring to 
see what the people of Iowa are capable 
of doing during these difficult times, 
but these visits showed me how much 
of an impact the supply chain disrup-
tions have on everyone throughout 
southeastern Iowa. 
Lomont Molding in Mt. Pleasant does 
custom plastic design and molding for 
HVAC and agriculture businesses, con-
crete accessories for roads and build-
ings, and chemicals with a market that 
reaches every corner of the world. Plas-
tic shortages have led them to use 
cast-off plastic, and now 99 percent of 
their 
regrind 
is 
reformulated 
and 
placed in their products. They also pur-
chased a corrugator machine to make 
their own cardboard boxes and dividers 
for shipping. By reducing imports from 
foreign companies, their customers 
have more reliability and depend-
ability. 
Delays in deliveries have forced man-
ufacturers across the country to resort 
to unorthodox and expedited methods 
of getting critical supplies. All these 
companies have adapted and impro-
vised and demonstrate the critical need 
for reliance on home-grown products 
and solutions by in-house innovation 
or on-shoring. Pretending the supply 
chain crisis doesn’t exist isn’t going to 
make it magically go away. It isn’t 
just a high-class problem. This should 
not be a partisan issue. Let’s get to 
work and deliver real results that sup-
port businesses and farmers across the 
country. 
I would also like to wish a happy 
birthday to my good friend, Ashlee.

CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, dur-
ing this Women’s History Month, let us 
celebrate the women who truly make 
our Nation and world run. 
This month, we honor remarkable 
women who build families and commu-
nities; who lead governments; who 
serve and protect their fellow citizens; 
and who break new ground in industry, 
science, technology, literature, medi-
cine, and so much more. 
Their work often goes unrecognized, 
but their work anchors, guides, and up-
lifts our society and the world. 
Let me pay special tribute to historic 
women from the five counties of Ohio’s 
Ninth District that I am privileged to 
represent: Congresswoman Stephanie 
Tubbs Jones, the first African-Amer-
ican woman elected to Congress from 
Ohio, and poetess Toni Morrison from 
Lorain County, Ohio. 
In Erie County, it is probably impor-
tant for us to remember that the first 
all-female jury was seated on August 
26, 1920. Can you imagine that? From 
Erie County, we remember the able and 
totally dedicated United Way director, 
Christine Galvin. 
From Lucas County, we remember 
two public servants, Eleanor Kahle, 
who was elected to city council after 
she went on Social Security, and Sen-
ator Edna Brown, who sadly just passed 
and was a comet—as was Shirley Chis-
holm at the national level—in Ohio as 
an African-American woman senator 
seated in Columbus but from northwest 
Ohio. 
The lives of these women inspire us 
all, and the legacies they leave are an 
inspiration to those who follow in their 
footsteps. 
During this Women’s History Month, 
we give thanks to them for the barriers 
that each of them broke and also for 
their solid accomplishments that they 
left behind. 
We all look forward with anticipation 
to the accomplishments of the next 
generations of American women to 
come because, indeed, they lead the 
world. 
f 
CONDEMNING VLADIMIR PUTIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in the strongest possible terms 
to condemn Russian President Vladi-
mir Putin and his ongoing war crimes 
against the people of Ukraine. 
In the last month, the world has wit-
nessed Putin’s brutality and capacity 
for evil against the innocent people of 
Ukraine. 
In the lead-up to the invasion of a 
sovereign, democratic Ukraine, Putin 
lied to the world, asserting that he did 
not want war, that he did not want to 
invade Ukraine, and that the troops 
amassed on the Ukrainian border were 
only conducting training exercises. 
Putin claims that any effort to ex-
pand NATO is a mission aimed only to 
destabilize Russia; however, it is ex-
actly the opposite. NATO is solely a de-
fensive alliance that has never sought 
to destabilize or challenge Russia but, 
rather, to support the maintenance and 
respect for sovereignty and peace. 
At no time during the lead-up to Rus-
sia’s criminal invasion did Ukraine or 
NATO provoke Vladimir Putin to act. 
Despite this, Putin launched a full- 
scale, illegal, and unjustified invasion 
of Ukraine under the false pretense of 
ethnic solidarity and denazification. 
The bottom line is: Putin is a liar 
and cannot be trusted. 
The world has witnessed Putin’s in-
discriminate bombing of residential 
areas and civilian infrastructure across 
Ukraine. Putin’s authoritarian bru-
tality has included the horrific bomb-
ing and destruction of a maternity hos-
pital in Mariupol, where he murdered 
women and children. He also ordered 
the bombing of a community theater 
where hundreds of innocent civilians 
were sheltering. 
Fears remain that Russian forces, at 
the sole discretion of Putin, will use 
chemical weapons against innocent 
Ukrainians, as they did in Syria in 
2015.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3979 
March 30, 2022 
In the face of Putin’s criminal war, 
the Ukrainian people and their Presi-
dent, President Zelenskyy, have shown 
immense courage, resilience, and deter-
mination as they defend their country. 
The world stands united with them. 
As a member of the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence, I be-
lieve it is vital that the United States 
continue to maximize available intel-
ligence-sharing with our Ukrainian and 
international allies and also maintain 
robust military and humanitarian as-
sistance. 
The United States must also work to 
declassify intelligence that reveals evi-
dence of Vladimir Putin’s malign in-
tentions and actions, including war 
crimes committed. 
Putin is a thug, a dictator, and an 
authoritarian 
war 
criminal 
whose 
crimes—past, 
present, 
and 
future— 
should be known and exposed across 
the world. Pulling back the veil on his 
actions will ensure that we hold Putin 
accountable and prosecute him for the 
war criminal he is. 
America and its people will continue 
to show solidarity with the Ukrainian 
people.

CONGRESS MUST ACT ON 
WILDFIRE RESILIENCY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on behalf of the people 
of Colorado who are experiencing his-
toric, 
destructive, 
and 
devastating 
wildfires. Four of the largest wildfires 
in our State’s history have happened in 
just the last 18 months. 
For my community, we are no longer 
witnessing wildfire seasons but, in-
stead, wildfire years. Fires are burning 
in August, December, and March. Our 
communities are under threat by wors-
ening, more dangerous, unrelenting 
wildfires 365 days a year. 
I would like to explain, Madam 
Speaker, to the American people what 
this encroaching threat will mean for 
families, for firefighters, for commu-
nities, and for our neighborhoods. 
On December 30, as the Speaker may 
be aware, a rangeland fire, fueled by 
hurricane-force 
winds, 
ran 
through 
suburban neighborhoods in my district 
of Louisville and Superior, Colorado, 
forcing over 30,000 people to evacuate 
and destroying 1,084 homes and busi-
nesses in less than 18 hours—1,084 
homes and businesses in 18 hours. 
Over 1,000 families left with nothing 
but the clothes on their backs and the 
items that they carried. Their lives 
will forever be changed as they begin 
the long, challenging, complex recov-
ery process. 
The Marshall fire, now the most de-
structive fire in Colorado history, was 
not the first, and it will not be the last. 
The Cameron Peak fire in Larimer 
County, Colorado, burned over 400,000 
acres from August 2020 through Decem-
ber of that year. The East Troublesome 
fire in Grand County grew more than 
100,000 acres in 1 day. Collectively, 
those fires have destroyed countless 
structures and left millions in damages 
for our communities to take on. 
Madam Speaker, these disasters war-
rant a response from the Federal Gov-
ernment, a bold, decisive response. We 
have proposed some of the potential so-
lutions. 
First, we have to start paying our 
firefighters a living wage. I was look-
ing at job postings this morning, 
Madam Speaker, in my district. In 
Boulder, there are customer service 
representative positions at copy stores, 
shops, and retail establishments with a 
starting pay of $20 an hour, $23 an hour. 
Yet, we have Federal wildland fire-
fighters making today $19 an hour, $18 
an hour, $16 an hour as they are lit-
erally sacrificing so much and putting 
their own lives on the line to protect 
our communities. It is unconscionable, 
and it should be unacceptable to every 
Member of this body. 
That is why we introduced Tim’s Act 
to 
honor 
Tim 
Hart, 
a 
brave 
smokejumper who tragically lost his 
life last year working on a wildfire in 
New Mexico. 
Our bill with Representative LIZ CHE-
NEY is the first bipartisan, comprehen-
sive legislation of its kind to signifi-
cantly raise pay for Federal wildland 
firefighters and ensure access to men-
tal health services, healthcare, hous-
ing, retirement benefits, and so much 
more. 
These firefighters are risking their 
lives every day, Madam Speaker. They 
deserve just compensation. We have to 
change it, and I am committed to doing 
everything in my power to get this bill 
to the floor of this House. 
We also have to support our commu-
nities in recovery. Rebuilding takes 
time, and it takes a lot of money. It is 
emotionally exhausting and complex. 
Last week, families in my district in 
Boulder who are in the process of lit-
erally rebuilding their homes lost in 
the Marshall fire were evacuated from 
their new temporary homes, rental 
properties in Boulder, as the NCAR fire 
burned as close as 1,000 yards from 
homes in the area. Firefighters are lit-
erally working as we speak to contain 
that fire. 
My bill, the Wildfire Recovery Act, 
which recently passed out of the Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Com-
mittee last year, would help local com-
munities like Boulder, Fort Collins, 
and communities across my State, 
from the Western Slope to the Eastern 
Plains, recover. It would invest money 
in mitigation, in resiliency. 
It is time for us to get this done, 
Madam Speaker. I am committed to

RECOGNIZING THE MONTH OF THE 
MILITARY CHILD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the month of April as the Month 
of the Military Child. 
I have always said that when some-
one joins the military, it is not just a 
job; it is a family commitment to our 
country. This is especially true for the 
more than 1.6 million children who 
have a parent on Active Duty serving 
our Nation, including nearly 2,000 who 
call Fairchild Air Force Base in east-
ern Washington home. 
Over the next few weeks, I urge my 
colleagues to join me in honoring the 
thousands of brave men and women 
who demonstrate their courage and 
commitment 
to 
freedom, 
selflessly 
serving our country around the world. 
Let us take this time to say thank you 
to those in uniform keeping us safe and 
remind them that while they are tak-
ing care of us, we are taking care of 
their children. 
To all the children of Active-Duty 
servicemembers, we salute you. We rec-
ognize your commitment to our coun-
try. We share in your struggles of not 
seeing your mom and dad. We support 
you unconditionally. Just like your 
parents, you are a hero in your own 
way, and in April, we celebrate you. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing the incredible 
sacrifices of military children across 
the country and invite my fellow 
Americans to help us honor them with 
unwavering support and appreciation 
today and every day.

HONORING VIVIAN PIERESCHI 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the dedicated public service and con-
gressional career of a phenomenal 
woman, Vivian Piereschi. 
In August 2001, the people of south 
Florida’s 20th Congressional District, 
which later became the 23rd District 
that I proudly represent today, re-
ceived a precious gift in the dedicated 
service of Vivian. 
After more than 20 years, this daugh-
ter of Cuban refugees, who emigrated 
to Florida in search of a better life, 
ended her career making the lives of so 
many others better. 
Vivian became a trusted adviser, ad-
vocate, and community leader. 
Through four administrations and 
two Members of Congress, Vivian navi-
gated the Federal Government, in all 
the ways it serves the American peo-
ple, with a nurturing spirit and patient 
persistence. 
When we passed the Affordable Care 
Act, a jubilant Vivian Piereschi said: 
‘‘Now, we can help so many more peo-
ple.’’ 
Whether it was passing life-changing 
legislation, going door-to-door to give

hurricane relief and assistance, pro-
viding immigration help, or just hug-
ging the families that lost loved ones 
in the Surfside condo tragedy, Vivian 
has always been there for our people. 
Vivian sought out a career in public 
service to be a voice for the voiceless, 
to speak for those who don’t have a 
seat at the table. Every day of her 20- 
plus years of service, she has done just 
that. 
I know that Vivian will continue to 
do this self-sacrificing work as she 
moves on to serve seniors in our com-
munity in her new role. 
The constituents of Florida’s 23rd 
Congressional District and the State as 
a whole benefited from Vivian’s dedi-
cated, diligent work ethic and her com-
passion. 
I know that Vivian’s husband, Alex, 
and sons, Eric and Nicholas, are so 
proud of her and all the work that she 
has done, and so am I. I thank Alex, 
Eric, and Nicholas for sacrificing their 
precious family time with Vivian so 
she could serve the people of south 
Florida for all these years. 
I will miss my friend, but I know 
that we will end up spending many 
more hours of personal time together. 
On behalf of my constituents, current 
and former staff, and all its stake-
holders, we proudly thank Vivian and 
congratulate her as she begins the next 
chapter of her service. 
Te quiero, mi amiga. I love you, my 
friend.

BIDEN’S ECONOMIC FAILURES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
the inflation rate in the United States 
currently stands at 7.9 percent. That is 
the highest it has been since January 
1982. 
As prices continue to rise, thanks to 
the unfavorable financial conditions 
created by President Biden’s agenda, 
these companies should rebrand them-
selves to reflect the state of our econ-
omy. 
Whole Foods Market will need to 
change its name to Piece of Food Mar-
ket. Pretty soon, that is all shoppers 
will be able to afford. 
When Americans take their next fam-
ily vacation, they might need to rent a 
car from the airport. Hertz Your Wallet 
has vacationers covered. 
Then there are the big box stores, 
long cherished for bulk purchases at 
low prices. Those days, of course, are 
gone in President Biden’s economy. 
Enjoy a trip to Costgoing Up Wholesale 
or Targetting More Expensive. 
When we have an administration that 
is putting forward $5.8 trillion—that is 
trillion with a t—budget requests, that 
says everything you need to know 
about their attitude towards inflation. 
Madam Speaker, this group is simply 
out of touch with the financial pain 
felt by American families because of 
rising prices. I hope the next inflation 
report on April 12 contains some good 
news from consumers. Of course, if it 
doesn’t, I have no doubt that the Biden 
administration will deny responsibility 
and shift blame to Big Oil, big agri-
culture, or big something. One thing is 
for sure. President Biden will never 
blame Big Government for his adminis-
tration’s economic failures. 
CELEBRATING FORMER TENNESSEE SUPREME 
COURT CHIEF JUSTICE GARY WADE 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate former Tennessee Su-
preme Court Chief Justice, my good 
friend, Gary Wade, and recognize his 
long and distinguished career in Ten-
nessee law. 
Born and raised in east Tennessee, 
Chief Justice Wade made the indis-
putably wise decision to attend the 
University of Tennessee, my alma 
mater, and graduated with his law de-
gree in 1973. I would like to note that I 
was in the third grade at that time. A 
couple years later, Chief Justice Wade 
decided to pursue public service and be-
came 
the 
youngest-ever 
mayor 
of 
Sevierville, where he served for five 
consecutive 
terms 
while 
simulta-
neously practicing law. 
In 1987, Chief Justice Wade joined the 
Court of Criminal Appeals where he 
served for 19 years and was presiding 
judge for 8 of those years. In 2006, he 
was appointed by then-Governor Phil 
Bredesen to the Tennessee Supreme 
Court, and he served as the court’s 
chief justice for 2 years. 
Following his retirement from the 
court in 2015, Chief Justice Wade be-
came vice president and dean of Lin-
coln Memorial University’s Duncan 
School of Law, who is named after my 
predecessor. The school achieved full 
accreditation from the American Bar 
Association thanks to Chief Justice 
Wade’s leadership. In 2020, he retired 
from that position and joined the Lon-
don Amburn law firm in Knoxville. 
Outside of his legal activities, Chief 
Justice Wade leads several charitable 
initiatives in east Tennessee. He start-
ed the Tennessee Judicial Conference 
Foundation, a program that awards 
need-based scholarships to students at-
tending any of Tennessee’s six law 
schools. He is also a cofounder of 
Friends of the Great Smoky Mountains 
National Park, which contributes funds 
to protect the park, and a cofounder of 
Leadership Sevier, a leadership train-
ing program for young Sevier County 
residents. 
Congratulations on an impressive ca-
reer, Chief Justice Wade. 
And on a personal note, I will always 
remember when Mama and I were going 
to the hospital when Daddy had just 
had his stroke. We were in a little bit 
of a state of panic. He saw us and 
passed us and called me on my car 
phone to check on us and check how 
Daddy was doing. He is a dear friend. 
HONORING SPECIALIST 4 VICTOR HODGE 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor Specialist 4 Class Victor 
Hodge, an American hero who served 
his country as Tennessee’s Second Dis-
trict’s March 2022 Veteran of the 
Month. 
Specialist 4 Hodge has battled health 
issues his entire life, but he never let 
that break his spirit. One day when he 
was 17 years old, he was out driving 
with his mother and saw an Uncle Sam 
poster on a building in Maryville, Ten-
nessee. He told her to stop the car be-
cause he was joining the Army. She 
told him that they wouldn’t take him, 
but Specialist 4 Hodge got out of the 
car anyway. And on July 28, 1978, he of-
ficially became a member of the United 
States Army, despite the obstacles cre-
ated by his health. 
He received his initial military train-
ing at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, and 
then was assigned to a Nike Hercules 
as a missile crewman. Upon completing 
his training, Specialist 4 Hodge was 
stationed at Homestead Air Force Base 
in Florida. His duty location was in the 
Florida Everglades, and he went on to 
become the leader of his squad. He 
served in Florida for a year and a half 
before health issues forced him to re-
turn to Fort Bliss. 
Due to his health, Specialist 4 Hodge 
received a medical discharge from the 
Army. One of his favorite memories 
from his service in Florida was when he 
had the privilege of meeting General 
Bradley, the first chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Since retiring from the military, 
Specialist 4 Hodge has been blessed 
with three children, two stepchildren, 
and three he helps raise. Specialist 4 
Hodge is a man of strong faith and 
thanks God every day for all the bless-
ings in his life. 
Despite persistent health struggles, 
Specialist 4 Hodge did not let that stop 
him from serving his country. It is my 
honor to recognize him as Tennessee’s 
Second District’s March 2022 Veteran 
of the Month.

DON YOUNG REMEMBRANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. O’HALLERAN) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in honor of my friend, Con-
gressman Don Young. Don passed away 
last week while traveling home to 
Alaska. 
At the age of 88, he was still tra-
versing this Nation to serve his con-
stituents. He stood up for the needs, 
concerns, and families, both here on 
the House floor, and out in the 
wildlands of his beloved State. 
Don was a fierce fighter for Alaska. 
But he was also a genuine man who 
worked on both sides of the aisle with 
Members, advocates, and people of all 
ideologies and backgrounds to improve 
the lives of the families he represented, 
never letting Washington politics get 
in his way. 
During his decades in Congress, Don 
advocated for Alaska Native tribes,

rural communities, and the success of 
all of Alaska—from its economy, to its 
lands, and the issues everyday families 
talked 
about 
over 
dinner. 
Rough 
around the edges at times, that is the 
way he wanted to be. That is just who 
he was. Like the vast and wild State he 
represented, Don was never one to back 
down from what he believed. Again and 
again, he put in the work to get things 
done. 
Beyond his words, his accomplish-
ments, his work, Don was genuine. All 
you had to do was to sit down with him 
in his office and understand how he had 
a story for almost everything, from his 
time in the Yukon River on tugboats, 
to hunting, to just enjoying life and his 
family. He was genuine. He was real. 
And more than anything else, he was 
my friend. I will miss him deeply. We 
always miss good people like that, peo-
ple that really have an impact on our 
lives personally and the lives of people 
that he represented and the lives of his 
family. He was a good, real person. 
Last fall, I shook hands on a friendly 
wager with Don for Alaska’s Katmai 
National Park’s Fat Bear Week. I never 
had that type of a bet with Don before, 
and I didn’t know much about bears. 
We agreed with each other that which-
ever Congressman chose the bear that 
went further in the annual competition 
he would win a district product from 
the other’s home district. And when 
my bear won—well, obviously, I was 
surprised. Don told me that I would 
never have a chance of winning at all 
because I knew nothing about bears, 
but I got lucky. And he smiled, as only 
Don could do. Don was true to his 
word. He brought me back a jar of 
smoked salmon from Alaska. 
Yesterday, I joined Members on both 
sides of the aisle as we paid our re-
spects to his life and legacy in the Cap-
itol. I could tell a lot of stories about 
Don, but when I was a freshman here, I 
went to him—he had this unique abil-
ity 
to 
work 
on 
Native 
American 
issues—and I said to him, I have a lit-
tle bit of a problem here with some 
issue in trying to find some votes. We 
sat and talked for a while. He said, give 
me a few minutes. And the next thing 
you knew, about 5 minutes later, he 
came back, and he said, Well, you have 
got your votes. Let’s get this thing 
passed. 
As the dean of the House, Don set an 
example for all of us to follow: Re-
specting one another; honoring one an-
other; working with one another. I was 
honored to work across the aisle from 
him to uplift the Tribal communities, 
our rural communities, and often-over-
looked States. He was so passionate 
about rural America. He was so pas-
sionate about the quality of life that 
he had up in Alaska. He went back 
there each and every time, back and 
forth because of his love for his State. 
Madam Speaker, today, my thoughts 
are with his wife Anne, his children, 
and with the State of Alaska, who have 
lost an advocate and a giant. 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S BUDGET 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, on Mon-
day, President Biden released a budget 
proposal calling for the highest sus-
tained level of government spending in 
American history. 
Unfortunately, despite record-high 
inflation caused by his administra-
tion’s 
reckless 
and 
out-of-control 
spending, President Biden’s budget re-
quest fails to fight inflation and leaves 
our military woefully unprepared if en-
acted as is. Instead, it uses budget 
tricks and misguided projections, com-
bined with already-expiring spending 
programs, to forecast an unrealistic de-
crease in the deficit, all while raising 
taxes. 
In fact, the White House assumed in-
flation would only be 2.3 percent for 
this year when, in reality, the actual 
inflation rate is running at 7.9 percent. 
Furthermore, they used an extremely 
low interest rate forecast, even though 
the Federal Reserve recently raised in-
terest rates and signaled more rate in-
creases would be on the way. Worst of 
all, they take credit for the temporary 
spending programs used to combat the 
pandemic that are already set to expire 
and are calling it a spending cut. 
The only explanation for such drastic 
errors and misguided messaging is that 
the Biden administration intentionally 
wanted to mislead the American people 
and save face for a failed first year of 
one-party Democratic control. It is ab-
surd that President Biden thinks he 
can pull the wool over the American 
people’s eyes and fool them into think-
ing he has taken the issues of inflation, 
the debt, and the deficit seriously. 
But we know that is not the case be-
cause President Biden and Congres-
sional Democrats spent trillions of tax 
dollars during the first year of com-
plete Democratic control to enact their 
ultra-leftwing agenda and satisfy their 
so-called progressive base, resulting in 
an increase in inflation every month 
President Biden has been in office. 
Even after a year of record spending 
on unnecessary social programs and 
burdensome environmental regulations 
that terminate American jobs and 
make us reliant on foreign energy, the 
President did not learn his lesson. His 
budget proposal spends billions of dol-
lars on Green New Deal initiatives 
while doing everything possible to 
eliminate the American oil and gas in-
dustry. 
The worst part of President Biden’s 
bloated budget is what it means for 
America’s Armed Services. If we want 
the future of our military to be as 
strong as our current military then, at 
the very least, it would need to be 
funded at the same level of inflation. 
Instead, military spending only in-
creases by 4 percent, well below the 
current level of 7.9 percent and future 
projections. 
b 1115 
Amid an active land war in Europe, 
President Biden’s budget would shrink 
the Active-Duty Army to just 473,000 
troops. That would leave the service at 
its smallest size since 1940. 
Before releasing his budget, Defense 
Secretary Lloyd Austin told the Presi-
dent that inflation would make it dif-
ficult to buy the ships that the Navy 
needs to continue to develop new weap-
ons and to pay our troops at a fair 
wage. Apparently, the President didn’t 
listen. 
How can we expect to compete with 
China and other adversaries if we are 
decreasing the size and strength of our 
military and are unable to fund the re-
search for new weapons? We simply 
cannot. 
It has become apparent that Presi-
dent Biden’s White House has adopted 
a uniform policy when combating infla-
tion. If you close your eyes, cover your 
ears, plug your nose, and bite your 
tongue, inflation ceases to exist. We 
know that is not the case. 
Madam Speaker, I have repeatedly 
called on the President to unleash 
America’s energy independence, reign 
in government spending, eliminate the 
burdensome taxes and regulations on 
job-creating industries and families, 
and return to the policies that put 
America first. 
Thankfully, 
Congress 
will 
decide 
what to spend for the sake of our con-
stituents, for our children, and those 
that follow after them. Let’s hope we 
can come together and pass a budget 
that puts the brakes on inflation and 
prevents our country from driving off a 
fiscal cliff.

NC STATE WOMEN’S BASKETBALL 
CHAMPIONS 
(Ms. ROSS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the extraordinary 
achievements of the NC State women’s 
basketball team, who won their third 
straight ACC championship this year. 
On Monday night, the entire Wolf-
pack community watched an incredible 
game as the women played their hearts 
out against UConn. 
Our players fought until the very 
end, coming back in the second half 
after trailing by double digits, scoring 
a 3 pointer that sent them into double 
overtime. 
It was no easy feat, playing UConn in 
their own territory, and NC State 
never gave up. 
Too often, women athletes don’t get 
the attention they deserve. The team 
was an example to all female athletes 
and all boys and girls seeking to play 
at the collegiate level. 
Congratulations to the Wolfpack on a 
fantastic season.

HONORING IRENE BURNETT 
(Mr. POSEY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize the most competent, re-
spected, and effective advocate for chil-
dren and families that I have ever 
known, someone who has made a dif-
ference in the lives of countless Space 
Coast families, Irene Burnett. 
When the space center was developed 
in the early 1960s, there were almost no 
social services, so Irene was brought in 
to lead the Human Planning Council. 
Irene devoted herself to serving the 
health, mental health, and social needs 
of our communities, establishing cir-
cles of care, the first dental clinic, and 
the first legal aid society. 
Irene’s philosophy was: ‘‘We don’t 
work with blind or disabled, we work 
with people,’’ always stressing the im-
portance of not only helping individ-
uals but families as well. 
Irene exemplifies servant heart lead-
ership. Thus, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in saluting Irene Burnett’s life-
time of service.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF CESAR E. CHAVEZ 
(Mr. CA´ RDENAS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of labor and civil rights leader, Cesar 
E. Chavez. 
Born in Yuma, Arizona, Cesar worked 
with his family in the fields of Amer-
ica’s southwest. 
After serving in the United States 
Navy, Cesar began organizing for the 
human dignity and respect of all farm-
workers, farmworkers like my father 
and grandfather, who did backbreaking 
working in the fields of California. 
Cesar’s powerful message of hope and 
opportunity motivated a generation to 
stand up and demand the respect and 
dignity their work deserves. 
He taught us the importance of non-
violent activism to fight for fair wages 
and fair treatment that helped put the 
American Dream within reach for hard-
working immigrant families, but his 
legacy extends beyond agriculture. 
He spent his life making sure our Na-
tion lived up to its core values of free-
dom, justice, and equality for all. His 
timeless vision of hope for a better 
world continues to inspire us every sin-
gle day. 
Today, on what would have been his 
95th birthday, let us reflect on Cesar’s 
life’s work and carry forward the leg-
acy he set forth. ‘‘Si, se puede.’’ ‘‘Yes, 
we can.’’

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RE-
SERVE ORGANIZATION OF AMER-
ICA 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, happy 100th anniver-
sary to the Reserve Organization of 
America, formerly known as the Re-
serve Officers Association of the United 
States. 
As the only organization solely dedi-
cated to supporting the Reserve compo-
nents at all ranks of all services, the 
ROA is a professional association that 
supports the rights and benefits of its 
members and their families, promoting 
national security. 
I know firsthand the effectiveness of 
ROA, having served with Colonel Leon-
ard Metz as Midland’s chapter presi-
dent. 
Shortly after World War I, in 1922, 
General John J. Pershing helped estab-
lish the ROA to ensure that America 
had a strong Reserve force to reinforce 
peace through strength. 
ROA membership is open to all Fed-
erally commissioned officers, warrant 
officers, noncommissioned officers, en-
listed, and their families of all serv-
ices, along with the Public Health 
Service and the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th and the global war on terrorism 
which comes to America, sadly, from a 
safe haven in Afghanistan.

CAPPING THE COST OF INSULIN 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, over 34 million people in the 
United States have diabetes. 
Nearly a quarter require insulin to 
stay alive, but the cost of insulin is 
bankrupting American families, and 
that must change. 
According to research conducted by 
RAND, Americans pay an average of 
$99 for a unit of insulin while Cana-
dians spend just $12. 
This study looked at insulin prices in 
32 other countries. It found that the 
cost of insulin was always higher, often 
5 and 10 times more expensive for peo-
ple living in the United States versus 
that of people living in other countries. 
That is why I rise today in support of 
legislation that would cap the max-
imum cost of insulin at $35 a month. 
Insulin is necessary and lifesaving. It 
shouldn’t be costing families their life 
savings.

ADDRESSING THE SUPPLY CHAIN 
CRISIS 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, pass-
ing the Don Young Coast Guard Au-
thorization Act of 2022 was an impor-
tant step in addressing the ongoing 
economic crisis facing our country. 
This legislation includes my bipar-
tisan proposal to establish a task force 
to address the ongoing port backlog at 
the Ports of Long Beach and Los Ange-
les. 
These ports move 40 percent of all 
shipping containers entering the U.S. 
and are major ports of entry for Cali-
fornia’s oil supply. 
The combination of the ports’ back-
log, inflation, and the administration’s 
crippling energy policies are making 
everything unaffordable for Califor-
nians, especially gas. 
We must address the supply chain 
crisis, unleash domestic energy produc-
tion, and stop the reckless government 
spending driving inflation. 
I urge the Senate to pass this bill im-
mediately so we can tackle this crisis 
and help California families.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
SIGNIFICANT MALICIOUS CYBER- 
ENABLED ACTIVITIES—MESSAGE 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117– 
103) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13694 of April 1, 2015, with respect 
to significant malicious cyber-enabled 
activities, is to continue in effect be-
yond April 1, 2022. 
Significant malicious cyber-enabled 
activities originating from, or directed 
by persons located, in whole or in sub-
stantial part, outside the United States 
continue to pose an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity, foreign policy, and economy of 
the United States. Therefore, I have de-
termined that it is necessary to con-
tinue the national emergency declared 
in Executive Order 13694 with respect 
to significant malicious cyber-enabled 
activities.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
SOUTH SUDAN—MESSAGE FROM 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–104) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act, (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13664 of April 3, 2014, with respect 
to South Sudan is to continue in effect 
beyond April 3, 2022. 
The situation in and in relation to 
South Sudan, which has been marked 
by activities that threaten the peace, 
security, or stability of South Sudan 
and the surrounding region, including 
widespread 
violence 
and 
atrocities, 
human rights abuses, recruitment and 
use of child soldiers, attacks on peace-
keepers, and obstruction of humani-
tarian operations, continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign pol-
icy of the United States. Therefore, I 
have determined that it is necessary to 
continue the national emergency de-
clared in Executive Order 13664 with re-
spect to South Sudan.

SEC. 14. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5706. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5706, the Stop Sexual Assault and 
Harassment in Transportation Act. 
The number one goal in the transpor-
tation of people, whether it is across 
town or across an ocean, must be safe-
ty. No matter how much progress we 
have made in increasing the safety of 
our transportation system, we must al-
ways strive to do better. 
But as we have seen over the course 
of the last several years, much more 
work remains to be done. And unfortu-
nately, the pandemic has only served 
to exacerbate the problem. For in-
stance, there were more than 5,700 re-
ports of air rage incidents on U.S. air-
lines in 2021 compared to a typical year 
of 100 to 150 cases. Many of these inci-
dents included sexual assault and har-
assment. 
In fact, last August, a passenger was 
arrested for punching a Frontier Air-
lines flight attendant and groping two 
others on a flight from Philadelphia to 
Miami. On another flight from New 
York to San Francisco last year, a 
plane was diverted when a passenger 
engaged in erratic behavior, including 
sexually harassing another passenger. 
The risk of an unwelcome and even 
threatening environment has never 
been more real for both passengers and 
transportation workers alike. 
This risk existed long before the pan-
demic. According to a 2018 study, 68 
percent of flight attendants on U.S. 
airlines say they experienced sexual 
harassment, and 18 percent experienced 
some type of physical sexual abuse 
from passengers during their careers; 
68 percent sexual harassment, 18 per-
cent physical sexual abuse. 
Moreover, this type of misconduct is 
not just limited to aviation. For exam-
ple, sexual assault is by far the most 
frequently reported crime on cruise 
ships, with 101 incidents reported in 
2019, the last full year before the pan-
demic shut down much of the indus-
try’s operations. While we don’t have a 
comprehensive set of data for public 
transit, a March 2020 survey of students 
at San Jose State University found 
that 63 percent of respondents had ex-
perienced some form of harassment 
while using transit. 
In recent years, there may be no 
other industry this issue has plagued 
more 
than 
transportation 
network 
companies. In 2019, Uber released its 
first-ever report documenting sexual 
assaults among users of its ride sharing 
app. The company documented over 
6,000 reports of sexual assault incidents 
in a 2-year span. That is an average of 
almost 10 sexual assaults in an Uber 
per day. Just last October, Lyft re-
leased 
its 
first-ever 
report 
docu-
menting 4,158 sexual assault incidents 
over a span of 3 years. These results 
highlight the need for the Federal Gov-
ernment to do much more to root out 
the scourge of sexual assault in our 
transportation system. 
But we can’t effectively respond to 
these incidents until we fully under-
stand the scope of the problem. Unfor-
tunately, there is no Federal clearing-
house for transportation-related sexual 
assault and harassment incidents. The 
data that the Department of Justice 
and the Department of Transportation 
collect on sexual assault and harass-
ment in transportation are largely of 
incidents that were directly reported 
to them, not from transportation pro-
viders. This information gap leaves 
lawmakers, policymakers, and trans-
portation 
providers 
themselves 
un-
aware of areas where laws and policies 
should be improved. 
That is why the Committee on Trans-
portation and Infrastructure passed my 
bill, H.R. 5706, the Stop Sexual Assault 
and Harassment in Transportation Act. 
This bill will require transportation 
providers to establish formal policies 
addressing sexual assault and harass-
ment; direct employees to receive spe-
cific training for not just how to han-
dle sexual assault or harassment inci-
dents, but also how to recognize and re-
spond to potential human trafficking 
activities; and direct the Department 
of Transportation to establish the 
first-ever Federal clearinghouse for 
transportation-related sexual assaults 
and harassment data to allow us and 
the traveling public to fully under-
stand the scope of this problem. 
We can no longer allow sexual vio-
lence and abuse to persist on our roads, 
our waters, or in our skies. We must 
ensure our transportation system is 
safe for those who work in it and those 
who wish to use it. This bill, which will 
allow us to finally track, respond to, 
and ultimately prevent sexual assault 
and harassment within all areas of our 
transportation system, brings us one 
step closer to attaining that goal. 
I want to acknowledge and express 
my appreciation for the many sup-
porters of this bill. In particular, the 
bill has been strongly endorsed by the 
Air Line Pilots Association, American 
Association for Justice, Association of 
Flight Attendants, Association of Pro-
fessional Flight Attendants, National 
Center 
on 
Sexual 
Exploitation, 
Rights4Girls, Survivors for Solutions, 
Transportation 
Communications 
Union, Transportation Trades Depart-
ment, AFL–CIO, and Transport Work-
ers Union of America. I would also like 
to thank my Republican colleagues for 
their help in strengthening this bill by 
expanding its requirements to State- 
regulated for-profit vehicles. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
COMMITIEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, March 18, 2022. 
Hon. PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chairman, Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DEFAZIO: This letter is to 
advise you that the Committee on the Judi-
ciary has now had an opportunity to review 
the provisions in H.R. 5706, the ‘‘Stop Sexual 
Assault and Harassment in Transportation 
Act,’’ that fall within our Rule X jurisdic-
tion. I appreciate your consulting with us on 
those provisions. The Judiciary Committee 
has no objection to your including them in 
the bill for consideration on the House floor, 
and to expedite that consideration is willing 
to forgo action on H.R. 5706, with the under-
standing that we do not thereby waive any 
future jurisdictional claim over those provi-
sions or their subject matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman.

COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE, HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, March 21, 2022. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 5706, the Stop Sex-
ual Assault and Harassment in Transpor-
tation Act. I appreciate your willingness to 
review the legislation. 
I acknowledge that by foregoing formal 
consideration on H.R. 5706, the Committee 
on the Judiciary does not waive any future 
jurisdictional claims to provisions in this or 
similar legislation, and that your Committee 
will be consulted and involved on any mat-
ters in your Committee’s jurisdiction should 
this legislation move forward. In addition, 
should a conference on the bill be necessary, 
I would support your effort to seek appoint-
ment of an appropriate number of conferees 
to any House-Senate conference involving 
provisions within this legislation on which 
the Committee on the Judiciary has a valid 
jurisdictional claim. 
I appreciate your cooperation regarding 
this legislation, and I will ensure that our 
exchange of letters is included in the Con-
gressional Record during floor consideration 
of H.R. 5706. 
Sincerely, 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in support of the goal of H.R. 
5706 to prevent incidents of sexual as-
sault and harassment in transpor-
tation. Passengers should feel safe 
when they are traveling, and transpor-
tation workers should feel safe in their 
workplace. 
No one condones sexual misconduct. 
That is why the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee and Congress 
took such a strong bipartisan stance 
against this type of behavior in air 
transportation in the FAA Reauthor-
ization Act of 2018. 
Last Congress, this legislation passed 
the House by voice vote, after Chair-
man DEFAZIO worked with the other 
side of the aisle to address technical 
concerns with the bill to avoid unin-
tended implementation issues. 
Again, I want to thank Chairman 
DEFAZIO for working with us on this 
bill. I urge support of this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, in closing, we want to help 
ensure 
that 
sexual 
misconduct 
in 
transportation is eliminated, and this 
bill is a step in the right direction. I 
urge support of this legislation and 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, as I 
said earlier, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. Hopefully, we can 
move it out of the House unanimously 
and get the Senate to act in the near 
future. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 5706. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘William T. 
Coleman, Jr. and Norman Y. Mineta Depart-
ment of Transportation Headquarters Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DESIGNATION. 
The headquarters building of the Depart-
ment of Transportation located at 1200 New

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 400, as 
amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 400, as amended, a bill to name the 
headquarters building of the Depart-
ment of Transportation located at 1200 
New Jersey Avenue, SE, in Wash-
ington, D.C. as the William T. Cole-
man, Jr. and Norman Y. Mineta Fed-
eral Building. 
The text we are considering today 
represents an agreement reached with 
the Senate and reconciles the dif-
ferences between S. 400 and my bill, 
H.R. 4679, which passed the House last 
November. This compromise language 
pays tribute to two American patriots, 
William T. Coleman, Jr. and Norman 
Yishio Mineta. 
William T. Coleman, Jr. led a life of 
extraordinary 
achievement. 
He 
at-
tended a segregated elementary school, 
graduated summa cum laude from the 
University of Pennsylvania, and was 
accepted into Harvard School of Law. 
He left in 1943 to enlist in the Army Air 
Forces, trained with the Tuskegee Air-
men, after which he returned to Har-
vard Law School and graduated first in 
his class. 
He was the first African-American 
clerk on the Supreme Court. He also 
worked with Thurgood Marshall on the 
legal team preparing the briefs in 
Brown v. Board of Education, served as 
president and chairman of the NAACP 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund, 
and argued 19 cases before the Supreme 
Court. Mr. Coleman was the second Af-
rican American to serve in a White 
House Cabinet, after being appointed 
Transportation Secretary by President 
Gerald R. Ford in March 1975. 
Norman Y. Mineta also has an ex-
traordinary life story. He, along with 
his family, suffered the grave injustice 
of being forcibly relocated and interned 
during World War II, but he was not 
bitter toward his government. Instead, 
he spent his career serving his country 
by participating in and improving gov-
ernment. 
For almost 30 years, Norm rep-
resented San Jose, California, on the 
city council, then as mayor, and from 
1975 to 1995 as a Member of Congress. 
He served on the Committee on Public 
Works and Transportation during his 
entire time in Congress. He chaired the 
Subcommittee on Aviation, the Sub-
committee on Surface Transportation, 
and he chaired the full committee for 
one full term. 
Norm’s skills and accomplishments 
were widely recognized. He was Presi-
dent Bill Clinton’s Secretary of Com-
merce and President George W. Bush’s 
Secretary of Transportation, where he 
was the longest-serving Secretary of 
Transportation in U.S. history. 
Following the terrorist acts of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, Secretary Mineta guid-
ed the creation of the Transportation 
Security Administration, an agency 
with more than 65,000 employees, the 
largest mobilization of a new Federal 
agency since World War II. 
For their contributions to this insti-
tution, to our government, and to the 
field of transportation, Secretary Wil-
liam T. Coleman, Jr. and Secretary Mi-
neta deserve this recognition. I strong-
ly support this legislation and urge my 
colleagues to join me. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3989 
March 30, 2022 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, S. 400, as amended, 
designates the United States Depart-
ment of Transportation headquarters 
as the William T. Coleman, Jr. and 
Norman Y. Mineta Federal Building. 
William Coleman had a long history 
of public service, including serving as 
the fourth Secretary of Transpor-
tation, as a civil rights leader and, 
early in his career, by serving the Na-
tion during World War II. 
Norman Mineta served as chair and 
ranking member of the Committee on 
Public Works and Transportation. He 
was later appointed as the 14th Sec-
retary of Transportation under Presi-
dent George W. Bush and is the long-
est-serving 
Secretary 
of 
Transpor-
tation to date. 
I think it is fitting to recognize the 
work and commitment of both Secre-
taries 
by 
naming 
the 
DOT 
head-
quarters after them. I urge support of 
the bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
In closing, I am proud to be a cospon-
sor of S. 400. This bill appropriately 
recognizes both Norm Mineta and Wil-
liam Coleman for their service to our 
country and the United States Depart-
ment of Transportation. 
I urge Members to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to close. 
I have already spoken strongly for 
this bill, for the Department of Trans-
portation building to be named in 
honor of William T. Coleman and Norm 
Mineta. 
I just want to add a personal note. I 
served with Norm Mineta for 8 years, 
and he was a great chairman and men-
tor. Between him and Jim Oberstar, I 
owe them a lot for my success in Con-
gress and for the leadership in this 
committee, so I am really pleased that 
we can do this today. I would expect it 
will pass the House unanimously, but 
there are inane people on the other side 
of the aisle who insist on voting on ev-
erything for no apparent reason, so I 
expect we will end up with a recorded 
vote, but I expect that will be unani-
mous. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 400, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days within which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on H.R. 5673. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5673. This bill will make technical 
corrections to the STORM Act, which 
was enacted in the 116th Congress. 
The STORM Act is bipartisan and bi-
cameral legislation that created a haz-
ard mitigation revolving loan fund that 
helped States and Tribal governments 
finance mitigation projects. This bill 
corrects clerical errors in the enacted 
language of the STORM Act. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides to 
join with me and support this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to be a 
cosponsor 
of 
H.R. 
5673, 
the 
Safe-
guarding Tomorrow through Ongoing 
Risk 
Mitigation—STORM—Technical 
Corrections Act, which makes nec-
essary corrections to the STORM Act 
passed late last Congress. 
This bill recognizes and implements 
the latest two installments of the 
building code and makes additional 
corrections, including those related to 
definitions for insular areas, to the 
mitigation revolving loan fund created 
in the STORM Act last Congress to en-
sure parity. 
This language reflects previously 
agreed-upon bipartisan language in the 
116th House version of the STORM Act. 
I thank Chair TITUS for her work and 
leadership on this bill, and I appreciate 
the bipartisanship found in this legisla-
tion. 
I urge support of this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, I urge that these 
corrections be added to the law and 
previously agreed-to corrections to the 
STORM Act as passed last Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the legislation, and I yield back

FEMA CASEWORKER 
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 5343) to direct 
the 
Administrator 
of 
the 
Federal 
Emergency Management Agency to 
submit a report to Congress on case 
management personnel turnover, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5343 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘FEMA Case-
worker Accountability Act’’. 
SEC. 2. REPORT ON STAFF TURNOVER. 
Not later than 90 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the 
United States shall submit to Congress a report 
containing— 
(1) the turnover rate for case management per-
sonnel of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency; 
(2) the average and median length of employ-
ment for the personnel described in paragraph 
(1); 
(3) the steps that the Agency is taking, or 
plans to take, to lower the rate of turnover for 
the personnel described in paragraph (1); 
(4) the number of personnel of the Agency 
that is detailed to work disaster recovery and 
then return to such personnel’s full time assign-
ment after a disaster, disaggregated by full-time, 
part-time, temporary, and contract personnel; 
and 
(5) the average time and median length of the 
rotations of personnel described in paragraph 
(4) and how often rotations and reassignment of 
personnel occur for each disaster recovery posi-
tion and function, disaggregated by full-time, 
part-time, temporary, and contract personnel.

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER) 
each will control 20 minutes.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days within which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on H.R. 5343, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5343. This bill addresses the high 
rate of turnover for disaster case man-
agement personnel at FEMA. 
FEMA’s case management personnel 
are critical to the disaster recovery 
process. They help survivors access 
basic needs such as housing, childcare, 
and transportation assistance. 
This legislation requires FEMA to 
provide a report to Congress with data 
on case management personnel turn-
over and any Agency plans to reduce 
turnover. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides to 
join with me and support this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 5343, the FEMA 
Caseworker Accountability Act, re-
quires the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency to examine their case 
management turnover rates and the 
average length of employment for em-
ployees detailed to disaster response 
cases. 
The goal of H.R. 5343 is to reduce the 
turnover rates for FEMA employees 
who have been detailed to disaster re-
covery. 
Consistent turnover only hurts dis-
aster victims as it can prolong the re-
covery process, especially for small 
rural communities. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. RICE). 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
bill, H.R. 5343, the FEMA Caseworker 
Accountability Act. 
South Carolina’s Seventh District is 
still recuperating from disaster after 
disaster. We experienced four flooding 
events in 8 years. 
Over the years, I have learned some 
tough lessons. We have continuously 
heard and seen how case management 
staff turnover rates at FEMA have ex-
tended the process for our communities 
to receive the assistance they need 
after a disaster. 
Sometimes it takes 4 or 5 years for 
FEMA to get people back in their 
homes, and it is far too long because, 
unfortunately, the people who are dis-
proportionately affected by these disas-
ters are people of low income and mi-
norities. They lose everything that 
they had, what little they had, and 
they can’t wait for 5 years for the gov-
ernment to respond. 
I have heard complaints from dis-
aster victims to local officials about 
the lack of coordination due to the 
high turnover rates at FEMA. This dis-
organization causes significant delays 
in processing claims and reimburse-
ment of essential funds. 
This bill will increase the trans-
parency at FEMA following a disaster 
by requiring a report on their employ-
ees’ turnover rate. It also requires a re-
port to include the average length of 
employment for staff who are assigned 
to work on disaster recoveries. 
FEMA must be held accountable to 
our communities and our taxpayers 
who rely on them following a disaster. 
I thank Representative MACE
and 
Resident Commissioner Gonzalez-Colon 
for their support on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of this bill. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, this bill will assist 
FEMA by providing data to reduce 
turnover and provide more consistency 
for communities recovering from disas-
ters. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation, and I urge others to do the 
same. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. 
WILLIAMS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5343, as 
amended.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days within which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on H.R. 5547, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-

There was no objection. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge 
my colleagues to support the Care is an 
Economic Development Strategy Act. 
I would like to start by honoring my 
coauthor of this bill, who recently 
passed away unexpectedly, Congress-
man Don Young, the longest-serving 
Member of this body, the dean of the 
House. As my partner on this bill, I got 
to see his dedication to serving the 
people up close. 
Even though he is no longer with us 
in this Chamber, I know that Congress-
man Young would be proud that the 
full House is considering the bill we 
worked so hard on together to help our 
kids and our communities. 
We authored this legislation with a 
simple idea in mind: Investing in care 
will help get people back to work, cre-
ate good-paying jobs, and create a 
stronger economy for everyone. 
I know this firsthand as the working 
mom of my 6-year-old son, my Carter 
Cakes. My ability to be standing before 
you today is dependent on making sure 
that my Carter Cakes is safe and cared 
for. Let me tell you all, it can even be 
difficult for families like mine. 
When I was pregnant with Carter, we 
struggled to find childcare that was af-
fordable and accessible. Today, it is up 
to my husband, Leslie, and me to make 
sure that Carter continues to be cared 
for so I can serve the people. 
Just this month, my husband had to 
take a day off from his job so that I 
could make a last-minute trip to D.C. 
when school was closed for a teacher 
workday. Later that same week, it was 
my turn. It became ‘‘Bring Carter to 
Work Day.’’ So, in Atlanta, Leslie trav-
eled to do his job, and I was home with 
Carter as he attended many Zoom ses-
sions in Congress. 
We have made it work, but unfortu-
nately, during this pandemic, not ev-
eryone has been as lucky as my family. 
Earlier this week, I visited Our 
House, a childcare center in my dis-
trict that serves some of the most 
marginalized families, families experi-
encing homelessness and housing inse-
curity. One of the providers told me 
that, during the height of the pan-
demic, a parent told her that she had 
to reopen because: ‘‘Corona may kill 
me, but poverty definitely will if I 
can’t go to work and provide for my 
family.’’ 
b 1245 
Care is not a luxury; it is a lifeline. 
Women, especially women of color, 
have been forced to drop out of the 
labor market at record rates during the 
COVID pandemic. This impacts the 
prosperity of our families and our econ-
omy at large. 
Care is an economic development 
strategy, and it is time that we treated 
it like one. My CEDS Act will ensure 
care accessibility is prioritized for all 
communities and all constituents. 
Currently, 
economic 
development 
districts must consider transportation 
access, workforce development, tech-
nology use, and environmental protec-
tion when creating their comprehen-
sive economic development strategies. 
Right now, there is no mention of con-
sidering quality, affordable care-based 
services. The CEDS Act would simply 
add this as a consideration. 
This bill will treat childcare, early 
childhood education, disability, long- 
term care, and eldercare as essential to 
communities’ economic development. 
When we do this, we can help folks re-
turn to work, provide for their fami-
lies, and invigorate our economy while 
knowing that their loved ones are in 
good hands. 
I bring this bill before you today for 
every caregiver who has been forced to 
leave the workforce, for every working 
parent who has given up on finding a 
solution that works, for every person 
who feels forced to choose between 
their loved ones and their livelihoods. 
It doesn’t have to be this way, y’all. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to support this legislation, for our chil-
dren, our seniors, and our families na-
tionwide. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

involving provisions within this legislation 
on which the Committee on Financial Serv-
ices has a valid jurisdictional claim. 
I appreciate your cooperation regarding 
this legislation, and I will ensure that our

PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 5547, the Care 
is an Economic Development Strategy 
Act, will ensure that recipients of Eco-
nomic 
Development 
Administration 
grants consider the availability of 
childcare, early childhood education, 
disability, and eldercare in their com-
prehensive 
economic 
development 
strategy. 
This helps ensure that the children, 
the elderly, and those with disabilities 
who live in rural and distressed com-
munities are rightfully included in eco-
nomic development planning. 
Our friend and colleague from Alas-
ka, the late Don Young, cosponsored 
this legislation as the Republican 
champion for this bill. It is an example 
of the commitment he had to biparti-
sanship and to supporting efforts to 
help distressed communities not only 
in Alaska, but throughout the Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, H.R. 5547 
ensures childcare and early childhood 
education, as well as disability and 
eldercare are components of local com-
prehensive 
economic 
development 
strategies. 
I thank the gentleman from Alaska 
(Mr. Young) for championing this issue 
on our side of the aisle and note our 
deepest appreciation for his work. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this important legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation as care is an eco-
nomic development strategy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

CHU). The question is on the motion of-
fered by the gentlewoman from Georgia 
(Ms. WILLIAMS) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5547, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

JOSEPH 
WOODROW 
HATCHETT 
UNITED 
STATES 
COURTHOUSE 
AND FEDERAL BUILDING 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (S. 2938) to designate 
the United States Courthouse and Fed-
eral Building located at 111 North 
Adams Street in Tallahassee, Florida, 
as the ‘‘Joseph Woodrow Hatchett 
United States Courthouse and Federal 
Building’’, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2938 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 
1. 
JOSEPH 
WOODROW 
HATCHETT 
UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE AND 
FEDERAL BUILDING. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
United 
States 
Courthouse and Federal Building located at 
111 North Adams Street in Tallahassee, Flor-
ida, shall be known and designated as the 
‘‘Joseph Woodrow Hatchett United States 
Courthouse and Federal Building’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the United 
States Courthouse and Federal Building re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘Joseph Woodrow 
Hatchett United States Courthouse and Fed-
eral Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Georgia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days within which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on S. 2938. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 2938, which designates the Federal 
Building at 111 North Adams Street in 
Tallahassee, Florida, as the Joseph 
Woodrow 
Hatchett 
United 
States 
Courthouse and Federal Building. 
Born during the days of segregation, 
Judge Hatchett grew up in Clearwater, 
Florida. He graduated from Florida 
A&M University in 1954 and was com-
missioned as a second lieutenant in the 
United States Army. He entered How-
ard University School of Law in 1956, 
and when he took the Florida Bar 
Exam in 1959, Jim Crow regulations 
prevented him from staying in the 
hotel where the test was administered. 
After admission to the Florida Bar, 
Judge Hatchett entered private prac-
tice in Daytona Beach, practicing 
criminal, civil, administrative, and 
civil rights law in State and Federal 
courts. 
A series of judicial appointments 
that began in 1971 ultimately led to his 
placement on the United States Fifth 
Circuit Court of Appeals by President 
Jimmy Carter in 1979, making Judge 
Hatchett the first Black man appointed 
to a Federal appeals court in the Deep 
South. Judge Hatchett retired from the 
bench in 1999 and passed away in April 
of 2021 at the age of 88. 
A House companion to this bill, H.R. 
4771, was introduced by Congressman 
LAWSON and had the support of the en-
tire Florida Congressional delegation. 
The Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure passed H.R. 4771 in 2021. 
Madam Speaker, I support S. 2938, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
bill, S. 2938, which designates the Fed-
eral Building and U.S. Courthouse in 
Tallahassee, Florida, as the Joseph 
Woodrow 
Hatchett 
United 
States 
Courthouse and Federal Building. 
I am an original cosponsor of the 
companion bill, H.R. 4771, as well as 
the entire Florida delegation. Judge 
Hatchett served as the first African- 
American Justice on the Florida Su-
preme Court. Later, he was appointed 
by President Jimmy Carter to the 
United States Fifth District Court of 
Appeals where he served as Chief Judge 
from 1996 to 1999 when he retired. 
He was a good man, a good friend, 
and someone I knew very, very well. 
This is a well-deserved appointment 
and naming. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, in closing, I again recognize 
Joseph Woodrow Hatchett and his serv-
ice to our country. He was a great man, 
and it will be a great honor for the 
Federal building and U.S. courthouse 
to be named after him. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. 
WILLIAMS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 2938. 
The question was taken.

SYLVIA H. RAMBO UNITED STATES 
COURTHOUSE 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (S. 1226) to designate 
the United States courthouse located 
at 1501 North 6th Street in Harrisburg, 
Pennsylvania, as the ‘‘Sylvia H. Rambo 
United States Courthouse’’, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1226 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SYLVIA H. RAMBO UNITED STATES 
COURTHOUSE. 
(a) DESIGNATION.—The United States court-
house located at 1501 North 6th Street in 
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, shall be known 
and designated as the ‘‘Sylvia H. Rambo 
United States Courthouse’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law,

house’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Georgia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days within which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on S. 1226. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this bill, S. 1226, which names the 
United States courthouse in Harris-
burg, Pennsylvania, after Judge Sylvia 
H. Rambo. 
S. 1226 was introduced by Pennsyl-
vania Senators CASEY and TOOMEY, and 
a House companion was introduced by 
Committee on Transportation and In-
frastructure member, Representative 
SCOTT PERRY, and cosponsored by sev-
eral members of the Pennsylvania dele-
gation. 
Upon introduction of the bill, Sen-
ator CASEY said: ‘‘Judge Rambo’s trail-
blazing career serves as an ongoing in-
spiration to countless young women 
across the Commonwealth, the Third 
Circuit, and the entire Nation. Her 
dedication to the judiciary is unparal-
leled, and there is no better way to 
honor her service to our Nation than 
by naming the new Federal courthouse 
in Harrisburg after her.’’ 
Senator TOOMEY said: ‘‘As the first 
woman to serve on both the Pennsyl-
vania Court of Common Pleas for Cum-
berland County and on the bench of the 
Middle District of Pennsylvania, Judge 
Rambo is a trailblazer. During her time 
on the bench, Judge Rambo has served 
Pennsylvania with great integrity and 
distinction. I am proud to introduce 
this legislation honoring a Pennsyl-
vania public servant with Senator 
CASEY.’’ 
The courthouse is currently under 
construction. Upon completion, it will 
contain a total of 8 courtrooms and 11 
chambers. Tenants for this new court-
house are the U.S. Courts, U.S. Mar-
shals Service, U.S. Attorneys, U.S. 
Trustees, Homeland Security, and Fed-
eral Public Defender. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in advancing this 
legislation naming the United States 
Courthouse in Harrisburg, Pennsyl-
vania, after Judge Sylvia H. Rambo. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 1226, which designates the United 
States courthouse located in Harris-
burg, Pennsylvania, as the Sylvia H. 
Rambo United States Courthouse. 
Judge Rambo was appointed to the 
United States District Court for the 
Middle District of Pennsylvania in 1979 
by President Jimmy Carter and as-
sumed senior status in 2001. 
I thank Judge Rambo for her many 
years of service. 
Madam Speaker, I support this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY). 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Florida for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I certainly rise in 
support of this bill to name the new 
Federal 
courthouse 
in 
Harrisburg, 
Pennsylvania, as the Sylvia H. Rambo 
United States Courthouse and Federal 
Building. 
As the sponsor of the House com-
panion to this bill, I am absolutely 
proud of our bicameral, bipartisan 
work with Senator CASEY to bring this 
bill to the floor. 
Judge Rambo’s trailblazing career is 
filled with historic moments—to in-
clude opening the door for women to 
participate fully in our Nation’s judi-
cial system. Her legacy of service to 
the citizens of Pennsylvania is indeed 
exceptional. 
b 1300 
Shortly after earning her Juris Doc-
torate from the Dickinson School of 
Law—also a place I am proud to rep-
resent—Judge Rambo served as a pub-
lic defender for Cumberland County, 
rising to the position of chief public de-
fender in 1976, at which time she be-
came the first woman judge to serve on 
the Pennsylvania Court of Common 
Pleas for Cumberland County. 
In 1979, President Jimmy Carter ap-
pointed Judge Rambo to the Middle 
District Court of Pennsylvania, where 
she became the first woman judge to 
serve on this court. She also became 
the first woman to serve as the chief 
judge of the court from 1992 to 1999. 
As chief judge, Judge Rambo has 
been a tireless advocate of the decades- 
long pursuit of a new courthouse in 
Harrisburg. Since the attack on 9/11, 
we have been seeking this new court-
house because the current one didn’t 
fit the parameters for security. But as 
you all know around this place, it is 
tough to get these things done. These 
are big projects and there are a lot of 
these projects to do around the coun-
try, and the resources aren’t always 
available. 
Judge Rambo never quit. Quite hon-
estly, our delegation never quit either. 
It is a long time in coming, and it cul-
minated in the groundbreaking on the 
building in 2018 where she was there. As 
her efforts on this initiative near com-
pletion, the building is almost done, it 
is absolutely fitting that the building 
be named in her honor. 
As a reflection and a testament of 
Judge Rambo’s historic legacy, her col-
leagues at the Middle District Court of 
Pennsylvania 
unanimously 
support 
this legislation to name the Federal 
Courthouse after her. 
Madam Speaker, I certainly urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
It is one of the few times that both 
sides finally can get together, both 
Chambers can get together to get 
something done and do something 
great for our community, and we 
should all be happy about that. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I again 
want to commend Judge Rambo for the 
many years of service to her commu-
nity and her distinguished legal career. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. 
WILLIAMS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 1226. 
The question was taken.

Donna Doss was a U.S. Border Patrol 
agent who served for 16 years on the 
Del Rio Border Patrol. On February 2, 
2019, while working, Agent Doss was 
struck and killed by a vehicle. 
Agent Doss was a wife, a daughter, a 
sister, a stepmother, and a colleague 
who was mourned by her community. 
S. 233 will recognize Agent Doss’ tragic 
passing and sacrifice, and I ask for the 
bill’s adoption. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 233, which designates the United 
States Border Patrol Station located in 
Rocksprings, Texas, as the Donna M. 
Doss Border Patrol Station after the 
late Agent Doss. After serving the 
United States Border Patrol for over 15 
years, 
Agent 
Doss 
was 
tragically 
struck and killed by a vehicle while 
serving in the line of duty. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleague from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) 
for his leadership in sponsoring the 
House companion bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to urge my colleagues to 
support the Donna M. Doss Memorial 
Act. It is bipartisan and bicameral leg-
islation that I introduced alongside my 
friends, Senator JOHN CORNYN and Con-
gressman CUELLAR. 
Donna Doss was a constituent of 
mine from the Big Country, Abilene, 
Texas. She valiantly served our coun-
try as a Border Patrol agent for nearly 
16 years before she was tragically 
killed in the line of duty in 2019. In ad-
dition to serving our country as a law 
enforcement officer—and I would add, a 
hero—she was a daughter, a sister, a 
mother, and a loving wife to Michael, 
her husband for over 20 years. 
Like many in her profession, she 
made the greatest sacrifice for the 
good of this great country, for the love 
of her fellow countrymen. The Bible 
says: No greater love than this that a 
man or women lay down their lives for 
their friends. She did that. She is a pa-
triot and we will miss her. 
This legislation is going to designate 
the Rocksprings, Texas, Border Patrol 
station as the Donna M. Doss Border 
Patrol Station to honor her and her 
legacy and her family, and, quite 
frankly, every law enforcement officer 
and their families that take on the 
same risks, and many of whom who 
make the ultimate sacrifice. 
It is the right thing to do. It is a good 
thing to do. I pray that the family is 
comforted by this gesture, and I pray 
that God would bless her legacy, as we 
pray that he blesses our entire country. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, it is ap-
propriate to recognize Agent Doss’ 
service to the Nation by naming this 
Border Patrol station after her. I urge 
support of this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. 
WILLIAMS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 233. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

LOUISA SWAIN FEDERAL OFFICE

Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (S. 2126) to designate 
the Federal Office Building located at 
308 W. 21st Street in Cheyenne, Wyo-
ming, as the ‘‘Louisa Swain Federal Of-
fice Building’’, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2126 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. LOUISA SWAIN FEDERAL OFFICE 
BUILDING. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
Federal 
Office 
Building located at 308 W. 21st Street in 
Cheyenne, Wyoming, shall be known and des-
ignated as the ‘‘Louisa Swain Federal Office 
Building’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the Federal 
Office Building referred to in subsection (a) 
shall be deemed to be a reference to the 
‘‘Louisa Swain Federal Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. WEBSTER)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3995 
March 30, 2022 
all Members have 5 legislative days 
within which to revise and extend their 
remarks and include extraneous mate-
rial on S. 2126. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 2126, which names the Federal office 
building located at 308 West 21st Street 
in Cheyenne, Wyoming, as the Louisa 
Swain Federal Office Building. 
In 1869, Wyoming became the first 
State or territory in the U.S. to con-
tinuously recognize women’s voting 
rights as equal to the voting rights of 
men. Louisa Swain was the first 
woman to vote under that law. When 
she cast her vote in the general elec-
tion of 1870, she was 70 years old. It 
would be another 50 years before wom-
en’s voting rights were recognized in 
the rest of the country. 
Swain, born in Norfolk, Virginia, was 
orphaned by the age of 10. She married 
and moved to Baltimore, where she and 
her husband raised four children before 
moving to Wyoming. Shortly after vot-
ing in the 1870 election, Swain and her 
husband returned to Baltimore, where 
Swain died in 1878. 
S. 2126 was sponsored by Wyoming 
Senator CYNTHIA LUMMIS and Maryland 
Senator CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, and co-
sponsored by Maryland Senator BEN 
CARDIN
and Wyoming Senator JOHN 
BARRASSO. In October 2008, Congress 
passed a resolution making September 
6, 2008 ‘‘Louisa Swain Day.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to sup-
port and highlight the history of vot-
ing rights in this country. I support 
this legislation and I encourage my 
colleagues to join me. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 2126, which designates the Federal 
office building in Cheyenne, Wyoming, 
as the Louisa Swain Federal Office 
Building. 
Louisa Swain was the first woman to 
cast a ballot legally, on September 6, 
1870, paving the way for all women 
after her and for greater equality. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I recog-
nize the work of Louisa Swain and her 
historic vote in 1870. I urge support of 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation in the spirit of 
voting rights in this country, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of S. 2126 which will rename our 
federal building in Cheyenne, Wyoming, to 
honor one of our state’s most distinguished 
heroines: Louisa Swain. 
On September 6, 1870, Louisa Swain be-
came the first woman to cast a ballot in a gen-
eral election in the United States. She cast her 
historic vote just a few blocks from the federal 
building that will now bear her name. Louisa’s 
action that day represented the very best of 
what Wyoming represents: independence, 
leadership, grit, integrity, and equality. 
In 1869, Wyoming became the first place in 
America where women had the right to vote. 
Our state constitution included suffrage for 
women. When we applied for statehood in 
1890, Congress responded that we would not 
be admitted to the union so long as we pro-
vided women with the right to vote. In re-
sponse, Wyoming’s state legislators said, ‘‘If 
we can’t come in with our women, we aren’t 
coming in.’’ 
Wyoming became a state in 1890, the first 
state in the union where women could vote. 
The track record of female leaders in Wyo-
ming is long and extensive. It runs through 
who we are as a state, whether that’s Esther 
Hobart Morris service as the first female jus-
tice of the peace in Sweetwater County in 
1870, Susan Johnson serving as a postmaster 
in Cheyenne in 1880, Mary Bellamy being 
elected to the Wyoming House of Representa-
tives in 1911, or my own grandmother, Edna 
Vincent, who was the first female Deputy 
Sheriff in Natrona County. 
It’s appropriate that we acknowledge Wyo-
ming’s historic leadership when it comes to 
advancing rights and opportunities for women. 
Renaming our Cheyenne federal building after 
Louisa Swain will serve as an important re-
minder and honor for all the trailblazing 
women who have come before us, and will put 
Wyoming’s proud history and heritage on dis-
play as an example for the entire Nation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. 
WILLIAMS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 2126. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
A further message in writing from 
the President of the United States was 
communicated to the House by Mr. 
Adrian Swann, one of his secretaries. 
f 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 3630 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent to remove the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY) as cosponsor of H.R. 3630. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
f 
AMERICAN MANUFACTURING 
COMEBACK 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, last year, we achieved the best year 
of job creation in history. 
The bipartisan infrastructure law 
will build on this historic growth, put-
ting Americans to work, rebuilding our 
roads, bridges, water systems, and 
more. And the COMPETES Act, which 
invests in American research, innova-
tion, and manufacturing will capitalize 
on this investment in our infrastruc-
ture and ensure the technologies of the 
future are made right here in America. 
The COMPETES Act will accelerate 
the production of semiconductors. It 
will strengthen our supply chain. It 
will boost our scientific leadership. 
And it will support good-paying domes-
tic manufacturing jobs. Intel’s recent 
$20 billion investment in a new com-
puter chip plant in Ohio shows the path 
to the future. 
As President Biden said in his State 
of the Union, it is time to bury the 
term ‘‘Rust Belt.’’ With the COM-
PETES Act, we can make more in 
America. And I know Ohio workers 
stand ready to lead the American man-
ufacturing comeback. 
f 
REMEMBERING DON YOUNG 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to re-
member the life and legacy of the gen-
tleman from Alaska, Representative 
Don Young, the dean of the House. 
Don was a dear colleague, friend, and 
brother in the Lord. He loved Alaska 
and respected the institution of the 
House, where he represented his con-
stituents for five decades. As dean of 
the House, he was the longest-serving 
Republican in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives’ history. 
He was a tireless fighter for Alaska 
and an unparalleled public servant. It 
has been a privilege to serve with such 
a strong longstanding Member, who 
was truly a force of nature. My closest 
moments with Don were shared on the 
House floor at our weekly Bible study 
where we discussed the promises of 
God’s Word. 
While we mourn his passing and lift 
his family in prayer, I will be cele-
brating a life well-lived. 
Madam Speaker, Scriptures in 1 
Thessalonians 4:13–18 instructs us with 
these words: ‘‘Brothers and sisters, we 
do not want you to be uninformed 
about those who sleep in death, so that 
you do not grieve like the rest of man-
kind, who have no hope.’’ 
Don Young had hope. 
Well done, good and faithful servant. 
f 
SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE 
(Ms. BOURDEAUX asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the bipartisan supply 
chain resilience subtitle in the Amer-
ica COMPETES Act. 
The COVID pandemic exposed vulner-
abilities in the United States’ supply 
chains. When disruptions occur in our 
supply chains, it leads to higher prices 
for families and businesses. 
The America COMPETES Act in-
cludes my bill to map and monitor our 
supply chains and other important pro-
visions that would create good-paying 
manufacturing jobs here in the United 
States. 
Studies have found that Georgia lost 
25 percent of its manufacturing jobs 
since 1999. Not only is this bad for 
workers, it is harmful to our national 
security when we are dependent on 
other nations to manufacture critical 
goods and services. 
The America COMPETES Act would 
address this vulnerability by making a 
historic investment in our Nation’s 
manufacturing capabilities and would 
equip us to prevent and mitigate future 
supply chain disruptions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues in the House and Senate to re-
tain this critical subtitle as we work to 
pass a final competitiveness bill. 
f 
RECOGNIZING ALEX GOGLIA 
(Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize an amazing 
young man and Scout in my commu-
nity in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 
Alex Goglia. After completing his 
Arrow of Light Award in Pack 1 of the 
Scouts, Alex crossed over into Scouts 
BSA Troop 1 in Sellersville. 
Since then, Alex has moved up 
through the ranks of Scouting and re-
cently became a Life Scout. As a mem-
ber of Troop 1, Alex has held several 
leadership positions, including assist-
ant patrol leader, patrol leader, and 
now senior patrol leader. His leadership 
through the ranks sets an excellent ex-
ample for the younger Scouts to follow. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to recog-
nize Alex Goglia before this Congress 
as an individual who lives the words of 
the Scout Oath and Law in his every-
day life and is steadfast in his commit-
ment to better our community back 
home in Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, recently, in the 
midst of an emergency medical situa-
tion, Alex used his lifesaving skills he 
learned in Scouting to save the life of 
a young child who was choking on a 
piece of food in a restaurant where 
Alex was employed. 
Alex’s calm, quick, and heroic re-
sponse was recognized by the National 
Boy Scouts of America, which awarded 
him the BSA Medal of Merit, a rare 
award offered by the Scouts. 
We are incredibly grateful for Alex 
Goglia’s meritorious acts and for the 
positive impact that he has had within 
Scout Troop 1 and our entire commu-
nity. 
Madam Speaker, we wish Alex much 
success as he pursues the rank of Eagle 
Scout, and for all his other future en-
deavors. 
Well done, Alex. 
f 
HONORING MATT KREUTZ, CEO OF 
FIREBRAND ARTISAN BREADS 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the in-
credible contributions of one of my 
constituents, Matt Kreutz. He is the 
CEO of Firebrand Artisan 
Breads, 
which is a fixture in our East Bay com-
munity. 
Earlier this month, I had the pleas-
ure of Matt virtually joining me at 
President Biden’s State of the Union 
address. Matt founded Firebrand in 2007 
as a socially conscious organization fo-
cused on making opportunities avail-
able for the unhoused, formerly incar-
cerated people, and others who may be 
experiencing difficulties getting hired. 
In recent years, he expanded Firebrand 
into a business that employs 85 people 
at its cafe in uptown Oakland and at 
its production facility in Alameda. 
Firebrand has become a beating heart 
in my community. 
As the pandemic raged on, Matt man-
aged to keep Firebrand open by secur-
ing a loan from the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, which was made possible 
by the American Rescue Plan. Since re-
ceiving the PPP loan, Firebrand con-
tinued expanding operations and grow-
ing into a major source of employment 
for many.

(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given

Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
with Americans facing higher prices 
everywhere—at the gas pump, the gro-
cery store, car dealership, clothing 
stores, and even at hotels—Americans 
are paying more everywhere, thanks to 
incredible inflation brought on by 
President Biden’s plan for spending. 
Well, with the new budget now com-
ing out, we are going to see an even 
bigger amount of deficit. American 
families are facing a $3,500 yearly infla-
tion tax, the Biden administration 
wants to spend $73 trillion over the 
next 10 years—just in the budget year, 
not new spending, not COVID spending. 
This is what normal budgets will start 
to look like, which was $8 trillion more 
than what the CBO is predicting for the 
same period of time. 
Under this budget, Biden can easily 
add $15 trillion more to the national 
debt, which would make it $45-$46 tril-
lion by the year 2032. We can’t manage 
this. If the price of interest goes up 
much more, it will completely evis-
cerate our ability to do anything be-
sides mandatory spending in our budg-
et. 
More families are going to suffer and 
the things we care about in the budget 
that we can’t control will suffer as 
well. 
f 
AFFORDABLE INSULIN NOW 
(Ms. BARRAGA´ N asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, 
the high cost of insulin is a crisis grip-
ping my district and our Nation. Time 
and again, my constituents have told 
me they can no longer afford their in-
sulin. The prices are so high that many 
are resorting to desperate measures, 
like using expired insulin, rationing 
their doses, or not taking it at all. 
Communities of color disproportion-
ately suffer complications of diabetes 
when they can’t afford insulin. I know, 
because my district, which is nearly 90 
percent Latino and African American, 
has a high rate of diabetes. Diabetes is 
one of the leading causes of death in 
L.A. County. 
Tomorrow, we will have an oppor-
tunity to act. The Affordable Insulin 
Now Act will ensure lifesaving insulin 
is affordable for millions of Americans 
on private health insurance and Medi-
care. It will put money back in the 
hands of American families. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
voting for its passage tomorrow. 
ENDING TITLE 42 AT THE 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
(Mr. ROY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, as we sit 
here in the Chamber of the United 
States House of Representatives today, 
the Secretary of Homeland Security 
has announced that he is ready to end 
the use of Title 42 at our southern bor-
der. This is as we speak, while in 
March, we have had 100,000 apprehen-
sions in the first half of the month, 
barreling towards 200,000, of which half 
have been able to be turned away under 
Title 42. 
When the Secretary ends Title 42, 
there will be a deluge at our southern 
border. This is known, which is evi-
denced by the fact that the Secretary 
is already working with FEMA behind 
the scenes and quietly to deal with the 
emergency that is no doubt about to 
occur at our southern border. This is 
going to cause massive injury to mi-
grants, cartels empowered, Americans 
endangered, fentanyl pouring across 
our border, all because the Secretary 
refuses to do his job. 
This is an inexcusable dereliction of 
duty by the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity. It is an impeachable act to not 
carry out his constitutional duty to de-
fend the border of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join together to condemn 
the Secretary, condemn the adminis-
tration, and demand that the Secretary 
actually do his job to secure the border 
and not end Title 42, even as Americans 
continue to wear masks on airplanes 
during a public health emergency. 
f 
b 1630 
WAR IN UKRAINE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
in 
a 
building 
that 
conspicuously 
marked its exterior with the word 
‘‘children,’’ the brutal Putin bombed 
without stopping this safe house in 
Mariupol. Obviously, it was completely 
destroyed. There were 300 people dead 
and little children sitting around the 
dead bodies of their parents. 
The whole city has been leveled. The 
whole country has been attacked by a 
brutal dictator. Of course, we know the 
peace talks are going on, I encourage 
that. As well, I believe that the allies 
should continue to give weapons and 
there should be some process for giving 
them fighter jets. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
Secretary of Homeland Security for 
recognizing that we will have to re-
ceive Ukrainian refugees, Haitian refu-
gees, and, yes, refugees from the bor-
der. We are, in fact, a humane country. 
We have the ability to be able to assure 
the world that we will be a refuge and, 
as well, protect the American people. 
That is what we do: we protect the 
American people, provide them jobs, 
give them safety, but, as well, we are a 
refuge for the world. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the Sec-
retary for his work. Let’s let Ukraine 
win this, either in peace or in war. 
f 
FIGHTING CORRUPTION AND 
KLEPTOCRACY 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, cor-
ruption abroad makes our country less 
safe. 
President Biden has said that the 
fight against corruption is a core na-
tional security interest for the United 
States. In the last month, we have 
sanctioned 
hundreds 
of 
Russian 
oligarchs and political figures over the 
war in Ukraine. These sanctions show 
the 
importance 
of 
alliances, 
the 
strength of diplomatic values, and the 
power of the economic tools at our dis-
posal. 
But it should not take a war to crack 
down on people who become wealthy 
through bribery and theft. We should 
not need to go person-by-person, busi-
ness-by-business, 
country-by-country 
to strike down corruption. 
We need legislation that will identify 
kelptocrats and proactively limit their 
ability to wield influence and exploit 
power to enrich themselves, at the ex-
pense of the people and land they gov-
ern.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
SOMALIA—MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–105) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13536 of April 12, 2010, with re-
spect to Somalia is to continue in ef-
fect beyond April 12, 2022. 
The situation with respect to Soma-
lia continues to pose an unusual and 
extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the 
United States. Therefore, I have deter-
mined that it is necessary to continue 
the national emergency declared in Ex-
ecutive Order 13536 with respect to So-
malia.

Let us pray. 
Eternal God, today show our law-

tours that prevent them from doing 
Your will. Lord, lead them to Your de-
sired destination. Instruct them with 
Your precepts so that they will live for 
the honor of Your Name. 
Eternal God, we keep our eyes on

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
ISRAEL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Last night, five 
people were killed by a Palestinian 
gunman outside Tel Aviv. It was the 
fifth 
time 
in 
just 
2 
weeks 
that 
unprovoked 
violence 
has 
shattered 
lives on Israel’s streets. Eleven inno-
cent victims are now dead. They in-
clude people of different faiths. Several 
were Arab Israelis. 
As Jews, Christians, and Muslims 
prepare for some of the holiest days of 
the year, families in Israel are in 
mourning. I know I speak for all of our 
colleagues in offering them the Sen-
ate’s deepest sympathies. 
America, like our Arab and Israeli 
friends, must remain clear-eyed. The 
war against terrorism will not fight 
itself. We cannot afford to be compla-
cent; we must continue to invest in the 
common mission of security and peace; 
and we must always stand firmly with 
our ally Israel. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. President, now on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, I oppose Judge Jack-
son’s Supreme Court confirmation for 
three main reasons. First, Judge Jack-
son has refused to follow the Ginsburg- 
Breyer model and denounce partisan 
Court-packing. She testified she would 
be ‘‘thrilled to be one of however 
many.’’ 
Second, Judge Jackson was not suffi-
ciently forthcoming on judicial philos-
ophy to dispel President Biden’s public 
litmus test that he would only nomi-
nate a judicial activist. 
And, third, Judge Jackson’s personal 
policy views on criminal sentencing 
have clearly slanted her jurisprudence. 
The average violent criminal who was 
convicted in Judge Jackson’s court-
room got a sentence nearly 2 years 
lower than the Federal guidelines. The 
average drug criminal, gun criminal, 
sex criminal, and financial criminal be-
fore Judge Jackson all came in under-
neath the guidelines as well. 
In the specific area of child exploi-
tation crimes, the nominee was lenient 
to the extreme. The average Federal 
judge sentences one out of every three 
child pornography possessors to a sen-
tence within the stiff guidelines. 
Judge Jackson never did it once. The 
national average is 1 out of 3, and 
Judge Jackson went 0 for 11. As she 
told Senators repeatedly, this was not 
some 
case-by-case 
coincidence 
but 
rather her consistent policy bias. 
I was making policy determinations. 
I have policy disagreements with certain 
aspects of the operation of the guidelines.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1842 
March 30, 2022 
The Washington Post just inter-
viewed a convicted possessor of child 
pornography who was supposed to get 8 
to 10 years under the guidelines. The 
prosecutor wanted 2 years; Judge Jack-
son gave him 3 months—her ‘‘policy 
disagreements’’ in action. 
This criminal realizes he was lucky 
to end up in Judge Jackson’s court-
room. Here is what he told the Post: 
I wasn’t very happy that she gave me three 
months, though, after reflection when I was 
in jail, I was hearing from other people who 
said it was their first time arrested and they 
got five years, six years. 
This is not a few cherry-picked cases. 
This is a consistent thread that runs 
through Judge Jackson’s accomplished 
legal career. 
In 2011, as vice chair of the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission, Judge Jackson re-
portedly made the jaw-dropping argu-
ment that if criminals were going to 
recidivate no matter what, it doesn’t 
matter whether we lock them up for a 
long time or let them out early. 
If we keep them in jail for the extra 36 
months, or whatever, they’re going to 
recidivate at the same rate. 
A U.S. attorney replied with the ob-
vious point that criminals can only re-
offend if they are back on the streets. 
In 2020, Judge Jackson rewrote the 
FIRST STEP Act on the bench to let a 
fentanyl trafficker out of jail early. In 
2018, while initially sentencing this de-
fendant, she apologized to him and 
voiced frustration that the law forced 
her to apply a tough sentence. Two 
years later, she twisted the law to let 
him out. 
Last year, Judge Jackson granted 
compassionate release to someone who 
shot and killed a U.S. marshal. The Pa-
role Commission had repeatedly denied 
this release, but Judge Jackson let him 
out. 
These are not personal criticisms of 
Judge Jackson. They are what the 
nominee herself calls these decisions 
‘‘policy 
differences.’’ 
And 
policy-
making is supposed to happen here in 
this Chamber, not in the courthouse 
across the street. 
This isn’t just about this nomina-
tion. The Biden administration has a 
sweeping project to make the whole 
Federal judiciary softer on crime. 
Even as this violent crimewave we 
are experiencing sweeps across Amer-
ica, the Biden administration is pur-
suing an ideological mission to make 
the Federal bench kinder and gentler 
to criminals. 
Judge Jackson’s record suggests she 
stretches the judicial role to advance 
that project. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. President, now on a related mat-
ter, judicial independence is essential 
to our Republic. It is integral to the 
rule of law. And for the most part, 
since the Democratic Party’s last run 
at partisan Court-packing in the 1930s, 
both parties have respected it. Ah, but 
lately, Washington Democrats have 
gone off the rails. 
In 2019, Democratic Senators tried to 
openly bully the Supreme Court into a 
certain outcome. They wrote a threat-
ening amicus brief saying the Court 
had better ‘‘heal itself.’’ 
In 2020, the Democratic leader him-
self stood on the steps of the Supreme 
Court and threatened multiple sitting 
Justices, by name, if they didn’t reach 
the policy outcome the liberals wanted. 
In 2021, President Biden assisted the 
delegitimizing 
campaign 
by 
con-
structing a pseudoacademic commis-
sion to ponder ideas like partisan 
Court-packing 
and 
unconstitutional 
term limits. 
Far-left activist groups mounted a 
public pressure campaign to push Jus-
tice Breyer to retire. Just last week, 
the No. 2 Senate Democrat, our col-
league from Illinois, claimed that the 
primary safeguard against partisan 
Court-packing is the Senate’s 60-vote 
threshold. This was a very revealing 
comment, considering that Senator 
DURBIN and the vast majority of his fel-
low Democrats just tried to destroy 
that very threshold a couple of months 
back. 
And now, in the last few days, the 
latest 
chapter, 
the 
quest 
to 
delegitimize the Supreme Court found 
its latest outlet. This time it is a co-
ordinated effort to nullify the presence 
of Justice Clarence Thomas on the 
Court. The far left wants another crack 
at what they tried and failed to do way 
back in 1991. 
Washington Democrats are now try-
ing to bully this exemplary judge of 30- 
plus years out of an entire legal subject 
or off the Court altogether. Far-left 
House Members are talking about dust-
ing off their party’s impeachment ad-
diction for a third consecutive year. 
They are boasting about how they 
successfully bullied their senior leader-
ship into impeachment in the past. 
Make no mistake, this performative 
outrage is not in earnest. This is a po-
litical hit, part of liberals’ yearslong 
quest to delegitimize the Court, all be-
cause our laws and Constitution occa-
sionally inconvenience the Democrats’ 
radical agenda. 
This isn’t new. It is a tired old topic. 
In recent years, the far left has issued 
near-constant—constant—demands for 
the late Justice Scalia, Justice Alito, 
Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, 
and Justice Barrett to recuse them-
selves from various issues where the 
far left feared they might not like a 
certain ruling, all based on spurious ac-
cusations about faith, ethical prob-
lems, or partiality. This new public 
pressure campaign is just a continu-
ation of this well-worn pattern. 
It has no basis in Justice Thomas’s 
decades of impeccable service on the 
Court. The Justice and the entire 
Court should feel free to completely ig-
nore all of this. Justice Clarence 
Thomas is a great American, an out-
standing Justice. He is faithful to the 
text of our laws and Constitution. His 
writing is clear. His reasoning is rig-
orous and transparent. 
I have total confidence in Justice 
Thomas’s impartiality in every aspect 
of the work of the Court. 
Each of the nine Justices should feel 
free to make every single judicial deci-
sion they make with total independ-
ence and complete freedom. What cases 
they hear, how they hear them, how 
they rule, whether and when they 
recuse themselves, and whether and 
when they retire, these are all judicial 
decisions. 
All nine Justices deserve total inde-
pendence as they approach every judi-
cial decision they make. This clumsy 
bullying from the political branches is 
really beyond the pale. Justice Thomas 
is an exemplary jurist who has modeled 
fidelity to the rule of law for more 
than 30 years and counting. 
I hope none of these Justices give 
any of the radical left’s various pres-
sure campaigns a minute’s thought. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, so 
today is going to be a very busy day on 
the Senate floor, as we continue ad-
vancing even more of President Biden’s 
well-qualified nominees. 
Later this morning, we hold an espe-
cially important vote to proceed on the 
nomination of Alvaro Bedoya, tapped 
by President Biden to sit as a Commis-
sioner of the Federal Trade Commis-
sion. 
The FTC right now is one of the best 
Agencies 
for 
protecting 
Americans 
from price gougers, manipulators, and 
those trying to rip off American con-
sumers, or at least it would be if it had 
full membership. Instead, the FTC has 
remained deadlocked for just about the 
entirety of the Biden administration 
because of Republican obstruction, and 
the consequences for American con-
sumers have cascaded one after the 
other. 
We all know that prices have been 
going way up and hurting a lot of 
Americans. There are serious reasons 
to fear a lot is due to some gouging and 
manipulation. The FTC is about the 
best Agency to look for this. But as 
long as its membership is deadlocked, 
it cannot act. 
This is especially urgent when it 
comes to energy prices. Americans are 
seeing higher prices at the pump, de-
spite massive profits for oil companies. 
So we need a fully operational FTC to 
investigate and take action if war-
ranted. 
That is why moving forward on Mr. 
Bedoya is so urgently needed. And, 
frankly, 
the 
obstruction 
over 
Mr. 
Bedoya is truly unacceptable, given the 
FTC is so important for fighting poten-
tial price manipulations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1843 
March 30, 2022 
Republicans know this. Yet his nomi-
nation has been deadlocked not once 
but twice at the committee level. For 
all the howling our Republican friends 
are doing about rising costs, they are 
truly content with dragging their feet 
on public servants who could actually 
help solve the problem. So shame on 
those who are blocking that. 
Without Mr. Bedoya, the FTC and 
members are left handicapped and in-
capable of moving forward. So today’s 
motion to discharge is a matter of im-
mense importance, and I hope all my 
colleagues who care about fighting in-
flation and price manipulation and col-
lusion 
vote 
to 
proceed 
with 
Mr. 
Bedoya’s nomination. 
And on one other point I wanted to 
make, I read that stock buybacks by 
the oil companies have dramatically 
increased this year. Why is that money 
going into stock buybacks instead of 
into other much more productive uses? 
This is another thing the FTC could 
take a look at. 
Now, as the day progresses, I also 
want my colleagues to realize the pos-
sibility of additional votes later today. 
On Monday, I filed cloture on five indi-
viduals to fill other important roles 
across the administration. Today, we 
will move on the first of these nomi-
nees, but we are working to move for-
ward with the rest as soon as we can. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, now on COVID, nego-
tiations on COVID public health re-
sponse funding continue. Yesterday, I 
met again with my Republican col-
league Senator ROMNEY, as we work to 
an agreement, and, today, these nego-
tiations will keep going. 
To keep the process moving forward 
in the Senate, last night I took the 
first procedural step on a legislative 
vehicle through which the Senate could 
pass COVID public health funding, 
when the time comes that both sides 
reach an agreement. 
We are not yet at the finish line, but 
we will keep working throughout the 
day, and I am committed to working 
with the other side reasonably and in 
good faith. The consequences of not 
getting COVID funding are really seri-
ous—scary, almost. 
Additional public health funding is 
crucial for making sure every Amer-
ican can get a vaccine if needed, in-
cluding booster doses and potentially 
new, more effective vaccines down the 
line. New funding would help make 
sure we have enough testing supplies 
throughout the country, which we 
know is perhaps the most effective way 
to keep track of the spread of the 
virus. 
Of course, more funding would ensure 
the Federal Government can continue 
providing treatments like monoclonal 
antibody treatments, which are invalu-
able for preventing severe COVID infec-
tions. The lack of therapeutics is prob-
ably the greatest need of all, and we 
need money so we can have a supply so 
when, God forbid, the next variant hits, 
we will immediately be able to counter 
it with the kind of medicines that are 
needed that limit the severity of the 
infection. The rest of the world is rac-
ing to buy up the supply of these treat-
ments and these therapeutics, and if 
the United States falls behind because 
of a lack of funding, vulnerable Ameri-
cans and our whole country will pay 
the price. 
The bottom line is this: Both sides 
should come to an agreement for more 
funding as quickly as possible because 
that would mean more vaccines, more 
therapeutics, and more testing so we 
can keep schools and communities 
open, and when and if another new var-
iant hits, we can stay as ‘‘normal’’ as 
possible. 
If a new COVID variant extends its 
nasty tentacles across the country and 
we don’t have the tools to respond, 
then woe is us. We don’t want to see 
that. Americans don’t want to endure 
that. So let’s keep working to try to 
reach an agreement soon. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The Senator from South Dakota. 
OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, American 
families are currently struggling with 
the worst inflation in 40 years—40 
years. Food prices, gas prices, used car 
prices—everywhere 
Americans 
look, 
they are paying more. Wages increased 
on average last year, but inflation out-
stripped wage growth, which means 
that, instead of a wage increase, a lot 
of Americans got a de facto pay cut. 
And there is no clear end in sight. 
It is no wonder that nearly two- 
thirds of the American people dis-
approve of President Biden’s handling 
of the economy, and they are right to 
do so because Democrats bear a sub-
stantial part of the responsibility for 
this inflation crisis. While it is true 
that supply chain issues and the re-
opening of economies after COVID 
shutdowns contributed somewhat to in-
flationary pressures, a big part of the 
reason for our current inflation crisis 
is the Democrats’ decision to pass the 
American Rescue Plan last March. 
The very definition of ‘‘inflation’’ is 
too many dollars chasing too few goods 
and services, and that is exactly the 
situation that Democrats helped create 
with their so-called American Rescue 
Plan. Democrats took control mere 
weeks after Congress had passed a 
fifth—fifth—bipartisan 
COVID 
relief 
bill totaling more than $900 billion and 
meeting essentially all current, press-
ing COVID needs. 
It was abundantly clear that we were 
not in immediate need of trillions more 
in 
government 
spending, 
but 
that 
didn’t stop Democrats. Now that they 
were in charge, they were eager to take 
advantage of the COVID crisis to begin 
implementing their Big Government 
vision. 
So, in the name of COVID relief, they 
pushed through a massive, partisan, 
$1.9 trillion piece of legislation filled 
with unnecessary spending and hand-
outs to Democrat interest groups, and 
the outcome was entirely predictable. 
Democrats flooded the economy with 
unnecessary government money, and 
the economy overheated as a result. 
Unfortunately, there is no going back 
and undoing the American Rescue Plan 
Act; although, given the inflation cri-
sis it helped create, I wonder if some 
Democrats wish they could go back and 
undo it. 
There is no easy fix for Democrats’ 
self-inflicted inflation crisis, but there 
are things that we can do to at least 
lessen its effects, starting with legisla-
tion to help ease supply chain woes. 
Last week, the Senate Commerce 
Committee 
reported 
my 
bipartisan 
shipping legislation out of committee 
by voice vote. The Ocean Shipping Re-
form Act, which I introduced with Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR, would help ease sup-
ply chain pressures by improving the 
fluidity of the supply chain. 
For some time now, I have been hear-
ing reports of ocean carriers refusing 
to transport certain goods, often Amer-
ican agricultural products. This would 
be a difficult situation at any time, as 
export markets around the world are 
critically important to American pro-
ducers, but it is particularly painful at 
a time when inflation is soaring and 
the supply chain is under significant 
strain. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act is 
designed to address these kinds of ship-
ping problems and create a more level 
playing field for American producers. 
Our legislation would give the Federal 
Maritime Commission increased au-
thority to respond to unfair ocean car-
rier practices whether that involves a 
refusal to carry certain cargo, like ag-
ricultural commodities, or discrimi-
nating against certain commodities for 
export. 
Our bill would also provide the FMC 
with tools to more quickly resolve de-
tention and demurrage disputes, which 
would bring greater efficiency and 
transparency to a process that leaves 
many shippers frustrated, especially 
agricultural producers and other small 
businesses; and our legislation would 
take steps to improve the movement of 
goods at our Nation’s ports, which 
would help ease supply chain bottle-
necks and improve the speed at which 
goods reach consumers. 
The Ocean Shipping Reform Act 
would bring long-term positive changes 
to the maritime supply chain, which I 
hope would benefit exporters, import-
ers, and consumers alike. 
I was very pleased that our legisla-
tion received strong bipartisan support 
in the Commerce Committee, and I 
hope it can swiftly pass here in the

March 30, 2022 
Senate. This is the kind of bill that we 
should be working on if we want to 
help alleviate our inflation situation 
and improve the economy. 
I was dismayed to see that the Presi-
dent’s budget, which was released this 
week, would double down on the kind 
of excessive government spending that 
helped get us into this inflation crisis 
in the first place. After a year of pro-
gressively 
worsening inflation, you 
would think Democrats would have 
learned their lesson, but, clearly, the 
President is still intent on more reck-
less spending, coupled, I might add, 
with job-killing tax hikes—and not just 
any 
tax 
hikes. 
According 
to 
Bloomberg, 
the 
President’s 
budget 
would add up to being the largest tax 
hike in American history in dollar 
terms. 
I hope that my Democratic col-
leagues here in Congress will decide to 
skip the President’s irresponsible tax- 
and-spending proposals and focus on 
measures that would actually help al-
leviate this inflation crisis, not make 
it worse. 
While there is no easy fix for our in-
flation situation, we can start to make 
things better for Americans with bipar-
tisan legislation like the Ocean Ship-
ping Reform Act. I hope my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle will support 
the legislation Senator KLOBUCHAR and 
I have produced. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RESTAURANT REVITALIZATION FUND 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I met 
with restaurant owners from all over 
my State last month—from Seattle to 
Yakima, to Spokane—and we talked 
about the American Rescue Plan and 
how important that was and how that 
bill made recovery possible for so many 
restaurants in our State—but not for 
everyone, and that is why I am on the 
Senate floor today. 
The American Rescue Plan was abso-
lutely a lifeline. It designated more 
than $28 billion to establish a Res-
taurant Revitalization Fund that gave 
restaurant owners the financial sup-
port they needed to keep their doors 
open, to rehire workers, and to deal 
with the continued effects of COVID–19. 
More than 3,500 Washington State 
businesses have received over $9 billion 
in Federal loans and grants and debt 
relief since the start of the pandemic. 
That is not even considering the flexi-
ble dollars that we provided local gov-
ernments to help local small busi-
nesses. Now, that really made a dif-
ference and helped a lot of folks keep 
their doors open and their employees 
on the payroll, but for many restaurant 
owners, the funds were gone before 
they were able to get the same relief 
their neighbors got. 
I don’t think it is right that a busi-
ness on one side of the street in Seattle 
got Federal dollars from the Res-
taurant Revitalization Fund but an-
other mom-and-pop shop just next-door 
and just as qualified—that also got ap-
proved—didn’t get the money because 
the funds ran dry. 
Now, I know this is true for commu-
nities in red States and in blue 
States—that our restaurants are often 
the heart of a community. They serve 
their local favorites that remind us of 
home. They sponsor our sports teams 
and community causes. They allow us 
to get together and share a meal and 
celebrate with family and friends and 
make memories. Making these busi-
nesses whole is critical for our econ-
omy, but it is essential to preserving 
what makes Seattle ‘‘Seattle’’ or Spo-
kane ‘‘Spokane.’’ 
I know many of my Republican col-
leagues feel the same way. So I want us 
to look at every possible option to re-
plenish the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund and get help to every restaurant 
that applied and got approved but 
didn’t get the same help as everyone 
else. 
We have got good bipartisan bills to 
get this done. Our legislation would 
help hard-to-reach businesses and com-
munities apply for the assistance be-
cause I really want to make sure we 
are helping actual small businesses, 
not giant corporations that don’t need 
it. 
Any Senator who has spoken to local 
restaurant owners knows they are deal-
ing, still, with really tough challenges 
right now: increased costs from infla-
tion and shortages of everything from 
straws to chicken wings, and it is not 
easy to find wait staff and cooks and a 
lot more. That is why it is so urgent 
that we get a bipartisan small business 
relief package—that makes our res-
taurants whole—over the finish line as 
soon as possible. So let’s do whatever 
we need to do to get this done and keep 
our restaurants open. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Now, Mr. President, everyone here 
knows how strongly I feel that we get 
a COVID supplemental passed as soon 
as possible. We do not know when the 
next variant might come or how bad it 
could be. We don’t want to end up in 
the same position as before, when we 
did not have enough tests or vaccines 
or therapeutics. We all know we have 
to get funding for a COVID supple-
mental passed and soon. 
So let’s get both of these passed to-
gether to make sure we are doing ev-
erything to keep every part of our 
economy up and running and so that 
this administration has what it needs 
to fund every other tool that we know 
will keep restaurants open, keep our 
schools open, and every other part of 
our communities. 
I feel strongly that we need to pass 
both of those bills. So let’s get them 
done together, and let’s get it done as 
soon as possible. Let’s keep America 
healthy and our restaurants open for 
business. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have 
some rare good news on the public 
health front. COVID cases are down at 
the lowest level since July. Crucially, 
hospitalizations and deaths are also 
down dramatically, more than 70 per-
cent lower than they were in January 
during the Omicron wave. Compared to 
just a few months ago, our Nation is 
experiencing far less suffering and 
death, thank goodness. 
But despite the progress we have 
made, COVID continues to be a threat. 
Every day, 800 American families lose a 
loved one to COVID—800 a day—and 
catch new infections, which present an 
opportunity for the virus to mutate. 
We are at a turning point in this 
fight against COVID. Now, we need to 
strengthen our healthcare system. We 
need to stay a step ahead of this deadly 
virus. That is especially true since the 
subvariant of Omicron—BA.2, as it is 
known—has become dominant in Amer-
ica. 
Remember the frenzy last holiday 
season when we were running from 
pharmacy to pharmacy trying to find 
rapid tests for our families or waiting 
in the freezing cold for hours on end to 
get a PCR test? Why would we ever 
want to be caught flatfooted again? We 
need to sustain our public health fund-
ing 
so 
that 
our 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare 
professionals 
have 
the 
equipment and tools they need to keep 
us safe. 
The one thing dramatically worse 
than returning to the dark days of 
COVID–19 and the deadly variants 
would be to return unprepared. If we 
want to keep our masks off—and I do— 
if we want to keep our kids in school— 
and I do—and our businesses open, we 
need to make smart investments in 
America’s capacity to confront future 
strains of these variants. We can’t con-
tinue this cycle of neglect and panic. 
These 
pendulum 
swings 
harm 
our 
health system and contribute to unnec-
essary costs and suffering. 
Congress must come together on a bi-
partisan basis. And shouldn’t we all 
agree on this: that we move as a nation 
in the same direction? That means pro-
viding funding to purchase new booster 
doses, including those which the FDA 
authorized this week for adults over 
the age of 50. I got mine yesterday 
morning. If we don’t purchase these 
vaccines now ahead of time, then we

will be sleepwalking into the next 
deadly wave. 
We also need to ensure that as soon 
as the FDA authorizes a vaccine for 
kids under the age of 5, parents can get 
their kids protected as soon as pos-
sible. 
Funding also is needed for oral 
antivirals and other therapeutics to 
treat patients who contract a serious 
case of COVID. These treatments will 
keep our hospitals from being over-
whelmed. 
And we need funding to maintain the 
testing infrastructure we have built up 
over the last several months, like 
President Biden’s successful program 
to put up to 1 billion—billion—rapid 
tests right at the doors of every Amer-
ican who wants one. 
The fact is, Congress should have al-
ready provided funding for these life-
saving resources, but we still haven’t 
done it. This lack of funding has al-
ready hit my home State of Illinois. 
Last week, shipments of monoclonal 
antibody treatments to our State were 
scaled back 35 percent to preserve the 
supply. Also last week, thanks to a 
lack of funds, the Department of 
Health and Human Services announced 
they would no longer pay hospitals and 
health clinics for testing they have 
provided to 30 million uninsured Amer-
icans. 
Several free community-based test-
ing sites and pharmacies in Illinois are 
now closing up. The money is running 
dry. At one community health center 
in Illinois, one-third of the patients are 
uninsured. That clinic has received 
more than $150,000 to test, treat, and 
vaccinate the patients—money well 
spent not just to protect these patients 
but 
every 
Illinoisan. 
If 
Congress 
doesn’t 
provide 
new 
funding, 
that 
health center may be forced to close 
for good. 
All of us want to keep the masks off 
for 
good 
and 
move 
past 
this 
coronavirus, but to think we can just 
wish away COVID forever would be 
naive, irresponsible, and fiscally un-
wise. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
join in a bipartisan effort to provide 
new funding for our COVID preparation 
response efforts. Let’s be ready for 
whatever this virus might bring. 
TRIBUTE TO DR. JASMINE HUNT DIMITRIOU 
Mr. President, finally, I want to take 
a special moment to thank a member 
of my staff who is leaving on a new as-
signment. 
History tells us there have been some 
extraordinary 
African-American 
women in the field of science. Dr. Alice 
Ball was a chemist who developed the 
first successful treatment for leprosy. 
Dr. Patricia Bath was an ophthalmol-
ogist who invented something called 
the laserphaco probe, a tool used in 
cataract surgery. Dr. Shirley Jackson 
was a theoretical physicist and former 
Chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission. 
What did they all have in common? 
They were African-American women 
who broke barriers and improved the 
lives of countless others, and they 
didn’t get the public recognition they 
deserved. 
Well, let me add another name to 
that list. Her name is Dr. Jasmine 
Hunt Dimitriou. Dr. Hunt—known as 
Jasmine in our office—joined my staff 
in 2010 on an American Association for 
the Advancement of Science fellow-
ship. She was a newly minted Ph.D. in 
chemistry who had just graduated from 
the University of California at Santa 
Barbara. 
The fellowship in my office lasted a 
year, but thank goodness she liked it 
so she stayed. We persuaded her to stay 
longer and devote more than 10 years 
of her life to public service. 
Over the years, Jasmine climbed the 
office ranks from fellow to lead policy 
adviser for science, energy, and envi-
ronment, to legislative director. 
Today is her last day in the Senate. 
She is leaving to take on a new chal-
lenge as Deputy Chief of Staff to En-
ergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. 
I know I speak for my entire staff 
when I say that we are thrilled for her. 
This is a well-deserved recognition and 
opportunity. I hate to lose her, but I 
never want to stand in the path of my 
staff if they have got a chance to pro-
mote themselves and to use their tal-
ents more effectively. We are going to 
miss her. 
Jasmine grew up in Normal, IL, 
which is perfect because she is about as 
normal and stable a person as you will 
ever find. No matter how long the 
hours or how tumultuous the mood, she 
is always clear-headed and calm. 
Her mother loved libraries and passed 
that love along to Jasmine and her 
brother Joseph. Thankfully, Jasmine 
remains a voracious reader and learner. 
I don’t know which is more com-
plicated, understanding how to split an 
atom or how a bill becomes a law, but 
Jasmine has mastered both. During her 
years in the Senate, Jasmine and her 
husband Mike became parents to two of 
the cutest little girls. She also has 
been something of a mother figure to 
countless young members of my staff 
whose careers she nurtured. 
Now she will bring her leadership for 
the Nation to the Department of En-
ergy. I have no doubt that, in little 
time, she will manage to stop climate 
change with a Thanos snap. She is a re-
markable scientist and public servant. 
I want to thank her for devoting so 
much of her time and talent to help 
me, to help the State of Illinois, and to 
serve this Nation. 
Jasmine, best of luck. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
NOMINATION OF JUDITH DELZOPPO PRYOR 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss the nomination of Ju-
dith Pryor to serve as First Vice Presi-
dent of the Ex-Im Bank of the United 
States. Now, the Ex-Im Bank was es-
tablished to help U.S. exporters by pro-
viding financing to foreign buyers of 
U.S. products. 
I have always been very skeptical 
about the merits of this mission, and I 
remain skeptical to this day. Ex-Im 
claims that it only takes risks that 
private lenders are unable or unwilling 
to take. That is a central message of 
the Ex-Im Bank. 
We should stop ourselves right there 
and ask ourselves a question: If private 
lenders are unwilling or unable to take 
a particular risk, why should taxpayers 
be forced to take that risk? 
And, at the same time, Ex-Im also 
claims it only makes safe bets. Mr. 
President, that is a complete con-
tradiction. It is impossible to do both. 
Ex-Im can’t only take transactions so 
risky that no one else will do them 
and, at the same time, only be doing 
safe transactions. It doesn’t make any 
sense at all. 
The fact is, Ex-Im wins business by 
systematically underpricing risk. That 
is why borrowers go to Ex-Im instead 
of any number of private institutions 
that wouldn’t offer deals on the same 
terms that Ex-Im offers. That is why 
our largest banks go to Ex-Im for loan 
guarantees. The Ex-Im terms are too 
good to be true—at least too good to be 
true in the private sector. And that is 
evident by the kinds of transactions 
that Ex-Im approves. 
Consider just last year: Ex-Im fi-
nanced a deal guaranteeing an $82 mil-
lion loan from JPMorgan to Qantas 
airline for the purpose of buying jets 
made by General Electric. Now, let’s 
think about this. JPMorgan is the larg-
est bank in America, one of the largest 
banks in the world. Qantas is the larg-
est airline in Australia. And General 
Electric is one of the largest industrial 
companies in the world. 
Why did these companies need the 
American taxpayer to subsidize a deal 
among the three of them? The obvious 
answer is they don’t. These are some of 
the biggest, most sophisticated compa-
nies in the world, and they have com-
plete access to global capital markets 
every day of the week. They didn’t 
turn to Ex-Im because they were un-
able to secure private financing. They 
turned to Ex-Im because they got a 
better deal than they would get in a 
strictly private transaction. 
Now, as if that isn’t galling enough, 
Ex-Im has now decided that American 
markets can’t meet our domestic fi-
nancing needs—purely domestic. I re-
mind you, the U.S. capital markets are 
the largest, deepest, most sophisticated 
capital markets in the world by far. 
Anyone with a bright idea and a busi-
ness plan can raise capital in the 
United States. They do it every day. 
According to the Securities and Ex-
change Commission’s Office of Small 
Business Capital Formation report for 
fiscal year 2021—last year—there were 
$2.2 trillion in private offerings of debt 
and equity and $1.7 trillion in initial 
public offerings and other registered 
securities. So that is almost $4 trillion 
of capital markets activities in the 
United States. That is how big our cap-
ital markets are.

S1846 
March 30, 2022 
And then, separate from that are the 
banks. According to the Fed, there are 
about $21⁄2 trillion in outstanding com-
mercial and industrial loans as of 
March 16. 
My point is, the United States is not 
an economy that is starved of capital. 
It is awash with cash. Nevertheless, de-
spite that, the Biden administration 
has instructed Ex-Im to develop a new 
Domestic Financing Program to ex-
pand the reach of the Bank into a 
whole new direction. 
This proposed Domestic Financing 
Program would support creating or ex-
panding domestic manufacturing busi-
nesses and infrastructure projects as 
long as there is some expectation that 
some arbitrary portion of the goods 
produced will be exported. And this can 
even include indirect exports. So, in 
other words, an Ex-Im finance manu-
facturer won’t have to export a thing if 
he can claim that his customers will. 
This is unbelievable. This is well be-
yond mission creep. As George Will ob-
served in the Washington Post today, 
this is ‘‘mission gallop.’’ And a pro-
gram like this clearly subverts con-
gressional 
intent 
and 
strains—and 
‘‘strains’’ is a polite way to put the in-
terpretation of Ex-Im’s charter. And it 
does so to such an extent, really, I 
think, to make the charter basically 
meaningless. 
There is no need—there is no rea-
son—for Ex-Im to be providing domes-
tic financing, none. As I said, we live in 
a highly developed market economy, 
like the most developed market econ-
omy in the world, and promising busi-
nesses have access to capital on com-
petitive terms. 
And just like all of Ex-Im’s other 
programs—maybe even more so—the 
only way Ex-Im is going to win busi-
ness in the domestic financing is if it 
either finances bad deals that the pri-
vate sector wouldn’t touch or it under-
prices the risks so that it is more at-
tractive than the private financing. 
So, earlier this month, I sent a letter 
to Ex-Im’s President and Board Chair 
Reta Jo Lewis, and I requested that 
Ex-Im respond to a series of questions 
I have about this unprecedented new 
direction the administration wants to 
send the Ex-Im Bank. I also asked to 
withhold Board consideration of this 
Domestic Financing Program at least 
until there is a comprehensive frame-
work that is published for notice and 
comment. 
Before the Board votes to launch this 
whole new category of business at Ex- 
Im, shouldn’t we all see: How is this 
program actually going to work? How 
expansive will it be? How expensive 
will it be? How many private lenders 
will be elbowed aside so that Ex-Im 
could be doing loans private banks 
would otherwise be doing? 
And none of this has been spelled out. 
We don’t have any answers to these im-
portant structural questions about this 
program. Yet my understanding is they 
are going to go ahead and launch this. 
So I sent this letter. Ex-Im responded 
to my questions, but they remained 
completely silent on my request to 
withhold Board consideration until 
there has been public discussion and 
debate about the specifics of this 
framework. 
Only 3 days after I got the Ex-Im re-
sponse to my questions, they noticed a 
Board of Directors meeting for April 14, 
at which they intend to consider and 
probably approve this Domestic Fi-
nancing Program. 
Now, this leads me to the reason that 
our Democratic colleagues want to 
push Ms. Pryor’s nomination through 
urgently. See, it is my understanding 
that the Ex-Im Board needs at least 
three Senate-confirmed nominees in 
order to change its existing policies— 
certainly a policy as big as this one. 
Ex-Im only has two Senate-confirmed 
Board members now. So without Ms. 
Pryor, they couldn’t launch this whole 
new program, which is a terrible idea 
in the first place. 
So that brings me to Ms. Pryor. My 
concern with her is that she will con-
tinue to support, first, what I think is 
the unacceptable practice of Ex-Im 
providing taxpayer-funded subsidies to 
some of the world’s largest and most 
well-capitalized companies, and I fear 
that she will move Ex-Im in the direc-
tion of supporting this whole new Do-
mestic Financing Program. 
Ms. Pryor has previously served on 
Ex-Im’s Board, and during that time 
the JPMorgan-Qantas-General Electric 
deal that I mentioned earlier was a 
deal that she supported. 
I asked Ms. Pryor a simple question 
during her nomination hearing, by the 
way. I said: Do these large, sophisti-
cated American companies have access 
to private capital? She acknowledged 
that that is a simple question, and she 
refused to answer it. Now, why would 
she refuse to answer such a simple 
question for which the answer is obvi-
ous? It is because she didn’t want to 
admit that these giant multinational 
firms obviously do have access to pri-
vate capital, to alternative financing, 
and she didn’t want to acknowledge 
that, despite that, Ex-Im still did the 
deal. 
I am also concerned about another 
issue, which is the weakening of one of 
the very few taxpayer protections that 
is built into Ex-Im’s charter. The char-
ter includes a 2-percent cap on the per-
missible default rate. So no more than 
2 percent of the assets on the books of 
Ex-Im can be in default at any point in 
time without precluding future lend-
ing. It puts a brake on Ex-Im expansion 
if they hit that 2-percent threshold. 
Well, guess what? Ex-Im’s’s default 
rate has trended toward that 2-percent 
cap. It is not quite there yet, but it is 
getting very close. That is why the 
President’s budget requests that Con-
gress temporarily waive the cap. Rath-
er than address the problems with Ex- 
Im’s deteriorating book of business, 
Ms. Pryor and the administration sup-
port this deeply flawed request to just 
double the statutory permissible de-
fault rate from 2 percent to 4 percent. 
How is that good for taxpayers? It 
doesn’t sound good to me. 
Congress laid out a clear corrective 
measure in the event the default rate 
cap is breached. That is, you freeze the 
book of business. You acknowledge 
something is not going right. We have 
to fix that problem. Is Ex-Im or the 
Biden administration proposing to fix 
the problem? No. They just want to ig-
nore it and just raise the cap, pretend 
it is not there. 
I will be the first to acknowledge Ms. 
Pryor is clearly a competent person 
and well-qualified. She has a lot of ex-
perience. That is not my concern about 
her candidacy. My concern is that 
nothing in the entire nomination proc-
ess—nothing in my discussions with 
her—has alleviated my concern that 
she would advance this badly flawed 
agenda, which is badly flawed in mul-
tiple ways, as I have laid out. It is also 
the case that the Biden administration 
and its supporters need Ms. Pryor now 
in order to advance this Domestic Fi-
nancing Program. 
For all of these reasons, I cannot sup-
port her candidacy, and I encourage my 
colleagues to vote against Ms. Pryor. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I will be 
very brief. I know we have an 11:45 vote 
scheduled. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
advancing the nomination of Judith 
Pryor as Vice President of the Ex-Im 
Bank. I appreciate the ranking member 
of the committee’s comments about 
her qualifications. She is clearly quali-
fied. 
What we need to always remember is 
our foreign competitors operate more 
than 100 export credit agencies and 
credit programs supporting our manu-
facturers. As if our policy has not been 
stupid enough as a country—PNTR 
with 
China, 
which 
caused 
the 
hollowing out of community after com-
munity in southwest Virginia and in 
my State and much of the area 
throughout the Midwest—China’s ex-
port finance activity is larger than all 
of the export credit that G7 countries 
collectively provide. China will con-
tinue to use export credit to win manu-
facturing businesses in critical sectors. 
In Ohio, we just lost two more light 
bulb manufactures, LED manufactur-
ers. The light bulb was invented by an 
Ohioan, Thomas Edison, in a New Jer-
sey lab. We used to lead the world. 
Now, 99 percent of LED light bulbs are 
made in China. Does that not teach us 
something? 
How about semiconductors? We in-
vented semiconductors. We only make 
about 10 percent of them in the coun-
try right now. 
As First Vice President of Ex-Im, Ms. 
Pryor will help lead the Nation’s offi-
cial export credit agency as it supports 
workers and manufacturers throughout 
our country.

dent of the United States in my life-

our economic agenda, our manufac-
turing agenda. We know what that 
means for building middle-class lives. 
More to the issue, the Senate pre-
viously confirmed Ms. Pryor to be a 
Board member of Ex-Im in July 2019, 77 
to 19. More recently, she was advanced 
out of the Banking and Housing Com-
mittee, which I chair, by a voice vote— 
12 Republicans, 12 Democrats—a voice 
vote. There was no objection, no dis-
sension. The Chamber of Commerce— 
not always an ally of the Biden admin-
istration—the Chamber of Commerce 
supports Ms. Pryor. She worked with 
former president Kimberly Reed, a Re-
publican appointee; and current mem-
ber Spencer Bachus, a former Repub-
lican Congressman, to reopen Ex-Im to 
full operations. 
My interest in her is a national inter-
est. My interest is also that she is a na-
tive Ohioan. She hails from Richmond 
Heights, a Cleveland suburb, with 25 
years of international business, fi-
nance, and public policy experience. 
Don’t be misled by attacks on Ex- 
Im’s creation of a new financing facil-
ity for U.S. exporters. They already 
have a quorum. She is not essential for 
that quorum. She is essential because 
she is so darn good in her job. Ex-Im 
President Reta Jo Lewis is doing ex-
actly what Congress—a majority of 
Congress, not unanimous, but a major-
ity of Congress—told the Bank to do 
when we reauthorized this charter in 
2019: Help American exporters compete 
with China. 
Our economy—this is almost hard to 
believe—I mean, it is hard to believe— 
for the first time in 20 years, our econ-
omy is growing faster than China’s 
economy. That is because we are fi-
nally stepping up with a real manufac-
turing policy. We are not asking Con-
gress to waive any rules. The Bank is 
required to show that its financing 
does not crowd out financing from the 
private sector. It is essential that our 
manufacturers have every tool at their 
disposal so they can compete globally. 
That is why we need Judith Pryor at 
Ex-Im. I urge my colleagues to join me 
in supporting Ms. Pryor’s nomination. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
earlier this week, I gave some exam-
ples of how the media is covering for 
Judge Jackson’s lackluster perform-
ance in her Supreme Court confirma-
tion hearing. I am not sure who they 
think they will persuade with these un-
hinged attacks, but what I do know is 
that the subtext has come through 
loud and clear for Tennesseans. It is: 
Sit down, shut up, stop questioning au-
thority; and if you don’t, we are going 
to come and get you. 
That is what these headlines are ba-
sically saying. 
Last night, I hosted a telephone 
townhall with more than 30,000 people 
across middle and east Tennessee, and 
they have rejected the message that 
they are seeing in these headlines. It is 
really pretty simple for them. The 
harder the media pushes and tries to 
shut them up, the more they are push-
ing for accountability, especially when 
it comes to protecting the future for 
their children and their grandchildren. 
As I am sure many people will recall, 
during a line of questioning in Judge 
Jackson’s 
confirmation 
hearing, 
I 
asked her a very simple question. All I 
wanted her to do was define the word 
‘‘woman.’’ She told me she couldn’t an-
swer the question because she wasn’t a 
biologist. If we had not been in the 
middle of a committee hearing, I would 
have thought that this was a joke. But 
we were in the middle of this com-
mittee hearing, and it wasn’t. It was a 
very deliberate signal to a very specific 
group of individuals. 
Of course, our friends in the media 
sensed this was going to backfire, as it 
did, so they flew into damage control 
mode. But I think it is safe to say they 
overplayed their hand on this one. Ac-
cording 
to 
this 
particular 
outlet, 
science says there is no simple answer 
to what a woman is. Don’t question the 
science. That sounds familiar, doesn’t 
it? We have heard that a lot lately. 
They went to great lengths to refute a 
simple fact that every single American 
learned in their grade school science 
class. Judge Jackson’s answer and the 
media’s panicked defense of it were 
both completely divorced from reality. 
I have spoken at length about how 
Judge Jackson’s total lack of a judicial 
philosophy causes these kinds of prob-
lems. But my Democratic colleagues 
and their activist friends still seem to 
be under the impression it is unreason-
able to ask a Supreme Court nominee 
about her approach to interpreting the 
law. This makes no sense. Without that 
philosophy—without that basic stand-
ard—you cannot achieve stability or 
predictability, which are two things 
Judge Jackson repeatedly told us are 
important for a functioning judicial 
system. 
I have serious questions about the 
nominee’s refusal to engage us on this 
question. But what worries me more is 
her refusal to acknowledge that when 
it comes to law, not everything can or 
should be up for debate because polit-
ical activists demand it. Our legal sys-
tem is built on a foundation of defini-
tions and rules, which are two equally 
important components. 
In this case, if we concede that the 
definition of ‘‘woman’’ is too con-
troversial to nail down, how can we de-
mand equal justice under the law for 
victims of sex discrimination? Further-
more, how could the Supreme Court de-
termine standing for any case regard-
ing a gender-based rule? To take it 
even further, if words no longer mat-
ter, are the definitions of other pro-
tected classes up for debate? If so, 
which ones? And if not, then why not? 
Whose standard are we using here? 
Think about that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1849 
March 30, 2022 
I hear from Tennesseans every single 
day who feel like they are fighting a 
losing battle against the erosion of our 
basic values. Their government is 
drowning in debt. The crime rate has 
gone from bad to absolutely terrifying. 
And classrooms have become battle-
grounds in the culture war between 
woke bureaucrats and parents who just 
want to rear their children as they see 
fit. 
Slowly but surely, activists are forc-
ing themselves between parents and 
their children, stripping words and in-
stitutions of their meaning and using 
their power to eliminate dissent. It is 
no way to run a classroom, and it is no 
way to run a country either. But right 
now, these parents I am talking to are 
looking at Washington and seeing the 
left use these same tactics to convince 
whoever gives credence to these un-
hinged headlines that reality is some-
how up for debate. 
They are not going to tolerate it any-
more, not from Congress, not from the 
White House, and certainly not from 
the Supreme Court. 
I think it bears repeating that the 
purpose of the Supreme Court is to in-
terpret the law, not to take up arms in 
a culture war. I cannot in good con-
science give my endorsement to a Su-
preme Court nominee whose first in-
stinct was to chip away at the very 
foundation of the law rather than chal-
lenge the expectations of radical polit-
ical activists. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we are 
at a critical point in our battle against 
COVID–19. While we are still losing 
Americans to the virus, we have 
reached a stage where most of us are 
able to resume many of the daily ac-
tivities we used to regard as normal. 
But our sustained effort to improve 
health outcomes and keep our economy 
on track is running out of funding. Now 
is the time to act. 
Over the last 2 years, our commu-
nities have taken necessary mitigation 
measures. Healthcare and frontline 
workers have given everything they 
have to care for our loved ones. The 
Biden administration, with funding 
provided through the American Rescue 
Plan, has worked hard to ensure we had 
the resources necessary to continue to 
adapt our response to COVID–19. 
After the peak of the Omicron vari-
ant, 
the 
reduced 
COVID–19 
trans-
missions has made it safer to reconnect 
with friends and family and resume 
some of the activities we have all 
missed during the past 2 years. Due to 
the tireless work of the Biden adminis-
tration, testing capacity and thera-
peutics are more available than they 
have been at any time during the pan-
demic. Over 81 percent of Americans 
who are 5 years or older have had at 
least one COVID–19 vaccination, and 
nearly 50 percent of Americans who are 
eligible are fully vaccinated and have 
had a booster. In Maryland, 91 percent 
of Marylanders 5 and older have had at 
least one COVID–19 vaccination shot. 
Overall, we have made significant 
strides in fighting the COVID–19 pan-
demic, but the threat is not over. Many 
Americans have children who are too 
young 
to 
be 
vaccinated 
and 
are 
immunocompromised or otherwise at 
high risk, so they may not be able to 
resume normal activities. While posi-
tivity rates and hospitalizations are 
decreasing, almost 700 Americans still 
are dying, on average, each day. 
Additionally, new variants continue 
to emerge. Countries across Europe and 
Asia have seen new spikes in cases due 
to a more contagious version of Omi-
cron known as BA.2. We could soon see 
a renewed surge as we are oftentimes 
only weeks behind rising cases in Eu-
rope. This latest subvariant already 
makes up 35 percent of the cases here 
in the United States. 
Fortunately, at this stage, BA.2 ap-
pears no more severe than the original 
Omicron variant. In the United King-
dom, however, as BA.2 increased, chil-
dren 2 to 11 years old had the highest 
rate of infections of any group in the 
country, the younger children. 
To 
respond 
rapidly 
to 
emerging 
variants, we must keep financing pan-
demic prevention and response needs. 
The White House and the Department 
of Health and Human Services have 
made it clear that at least $22.5 billion 
of additional funding is necessary to 
replenish pandemic prevention pro-
grams that are nearing completion or 
have already been depleted. Without 
these funds, we will have to cut back 
on critical aspects of the pandemic re-
sponse. 
Here are some examples. Our na-
tional testing capacity will decline, 
leaving us vulnerable and less able to 
detect emerging variants. It will be-
come harder to diagnose infections 
early enough to take effective treat-
ments. Also, uninsured individuals may 
no longer be able to access vaccines, 
tests, and treatments for free. This will 
cut off a critical support for uninsured 
individuals and health providers who 
care for them if they become ill with 
COVID–19. 
In addition to testing and acute care, 
vital COVID–19 research will suffer if 
we do not provide sufficient funding. 
Continued development of new medica-
tions and vaccines is critical, but with-
out additional funding, research will 
stop, leaving us potentially vulnerable 
to a variant resistant to our current 
arsenal. Specifically, the National In-
stitutes of Health may shut down some 
of its COVID–19 research. 
Further, the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration recently granted an emergency 
use authorization for a new monoclonal 
antibody treatment that is effective 
against the Omicron variant. Without 
additional funding, however, the Fed-
eral Government won’t be able to con-
tinue ordering the monoclonal anti-
body treatments, vital therapies for 
immunocompromised 
patients, 
and 
antiviral pills, all of which are already 
in short supply. 
Additional funding is critically im-
portant if we want to see the United 
States continue its leadership role in 
distributing vaccinations across the 
world to prevent more and worse 
variants from taking off and arriving 
on our shores. 
I will continue to fight to ensure that 
we get additional COVID–19 funding. 
The American Rescue Plan Act dem-
onstrated our ability to pass legisla-
tion that quickly ramped up pandemic 
response efforts and effectively miti-
gated the negative economic impact of 
the pandemic. This legislation has been 
critical in helping individuals and com-
munities respond to the challenges 
brought on by the pandemic. Local 
governments have had to provide es-
sential services at an unprecedented 
level, and they have risen to the occa-
sion without falling into financial ruin. 
Now is not the time to take the foot off 
the gas. 
Restaurants, for example, still need 
help. The American Rescue Plan cre-
ated 
the 
Restaurant 
Revitalization 
Fund, but the $28.6 billion provided to 
the program was not enough to meet 
demand. I remain gravely disappointed 
that the fiscal year 2022 omnibus 
spending package Congress passed ear-
lier this month did not include addi-
tional assistance for restaurants and 
other hard-hit small businesses. For 
the last 2 years of the pandemic, nearly 
all restaurants have been under great 
strain as they have struggled to keep 
staff and adapt to the new variants, 
while facing increased pricing due to 
supply chain disruptions and inflation. 
And those have been the restaurants 
fortunate enough to survive the pan-
demic. Thousands have closed their 
doors for good. 
More than 100,000 restaurants re-
ceived grants from the Restaurant Re-
vitalization Fund that have helped 
them keep their doors open, but more 
than 180,000 restaurants that submitted 
their applications on time to receive 
funds—their applications were there— 
have received no funds at all. That is 
not fair, and they desperately need our 
help. 
If Congress had not acted quickly to 
replenish 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program when it ran out of money 
weeks after it opened in April 2020—and 
we did that, by the way, with strong, 
almost unanimous support, and it was 
hundreds of billions of dollars that we 
were short—the program would have 
been a half-measure, necessary but not 
sufficient. Instead, we extended the 
emergency aid needed to meet the cri-
sis we faced, and that is exactly what 
we need to do again with the Res-
taurant Revitalization Fund. 
For the past 2 years plus, I have 
worked hard to secure vital resources 
to fight the COVID–19 pandemic and 
ensure that those who are struggling 
from the economic effects or emotional 
toll have the necessary support going 
forward. I will continue that fight.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1850 
March 30, 2022 
The novel virus continues to chal-
lenge our Nation and the world, so we 
must be prepared. I urge the Senate to 
pass necessary additional funding for 
COVID–19 relief so Americans can con-
tinue to face this challenge head-on 
and prevail. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO STEVE A. SCOTT 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, this 
evening, I want to take just a few mo-
ments to recognize Pittsburg State 
University President Steve Scott. His 
long tenure at PSU—over three decades 
in total—has shepherded the university 
through various challenges and a pe-
riod of growth. 
Since taking the helm as president in 
2009, he has led through a recession, en-
rollment and recruitment challenges in 
a global pandemic. 
Early on during the pandemic, as our 
world was shutting down, I hosted a 
Crawford County virtual check-in with 
area leaders. President Scott was on 
that Zoom call. It was one of the many 
Zoom calls we have made over the last 
several years. During that conversa-
tion, President Scott said that there 
were three things to do when leading 
during difficult times: One, tell the 
truth; two, give people hope; and three, 
tell people how they can help. That ad-
vice has stuck with me and has helped 
guide my work and my conversations 
with Kansans ever since, and it is good 
advice that we can follow yet today. 
But President Scott’s legacy is not 
only marked by challenges. Pittsburg 
State has seen tremendous growth and 
opportunity over the past decades: the 
Bicknell Family Center for the Arts, 
Block22, the expansion of the Overman 
Student Center, the Plaster Center, 
and many other positive developments. 
These encouraging things highlight 
his emphasis on being a good commu-
nity partner and his success in further 
integrating the university with the 
city of Pittsburg, Crawford County, 
and the region. 
If you have ever been to Pittsburg on 
game day to cheer on the Gorilla’s 
football team, it is clear how well the 
university pulls the community to-
gether. 
I 
have 
always 
enjoyed 
walking 
through Gorilla Village with President 
Scott to visit with students and com-
munity members—with ‘‘Welcome to 
the Jungle,’’ of course, playing in the 
background. 
It is during these events that it is 
clear how well he relates to students, 
how much he cares for them and enjoys 
hearing their goals and their dreams 
or, for graduates, what they have ac-
complished since leaving campus. 
I am of the view that we change the 
world one soul, one student, one person 
at a time. Education is one of the most 
impactful ways we can do that, and I 
appreciate President Scott’s dedication 
to serving students for the past 30 
years. 
I also appreciate how closely he has 
worked with me and my staff to advo-
cate for Kansas higher education and 
identify ways the Federal Government 
can invest in the campus to move both 
Kansans and Kansas forward. 
President Steve Scott will be cele-
brated this Friday in Pittsburg and 
step down from his position as presi-
dent in June, but before he does so, I 
want him to know how grateful I am 
and Kansans are for his service. 
He is a public servant through and 
through, and I look forward to seeing 
what he does next. Whatever it may be, 
I wish him and Cathy the very best. 
President Scott, thank you for your 
friendship. Thank you for making a dif-
ference in so many lives. We are grate-
ful for what you have done at Pittsburg 
State University. Best to you and your 
family. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KELLY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. PORTMAN. I am here on the 
floor today to talk about border secu-
rity, an issue that is intertwined with 
our national security and, certainly, 
with the drug epidemic that we see in 
our communities around the country. 
We are in the middle right now of the 
worst border crisis in the history of our 
country. 
This chart tells the story. 
Monthly border crossings are at an 
unprecedented level. Customs and Bor-
der Protection reports that there were 
164,973 encounters at the border in Feb-
ruary. By the way, that is equal to the 
population of Dayton, OH. Actually, it 
is far greater than the population of 
Dayton, OH. 
So we have never had this kind of il-
legal migration into the country—this 
many people being apprehended. They 
told us last week that they are seeing 
over 7,000 migrants per day in this 
month, in March, and this is while 
something called title 42 is in effect. 
What is title 42? 
Well, despite these really big num-
bers you see here in terms of the num-
ber of people being apprehended at the 
border, under what is called title 42, 
which is a public health authority—it 
has nothing to do with immigration, 
really. It is about public health, and it 
is in place because of COVID–19. It al-
lows the Customs and Border Protec-
tion folks to say: Sorry, you can’t 
come into the United States for public 
health reasons. And, therefore, they 
can be turned away. 
So that order is in place right now. 
Here is how that has worked. If you 
look at this chart, you will see the peo-
ple who have been turned away because 
of title 42, in orange. Those are the 
numbers in orange. Those who have 
been allowed to come into the country 
are in blue. 
You will see here, at the end of the 
last administration, in the Trump 
years, when we had for the most part a 
secure border, we had very few illegal 
entries. We had about 75 percent of the 
people who were coming in who were 
turned away by title 42. 
In this administration, it is closer to 
about 50 percent. About 50 percent of 
the people are being turned away by 
title 42. 
Why is this important? Well, obvi-
ously, we are making progress on 
COVID. COVID–19, we all hope, is not 
going to be here forever. There may be 
another variant out there, but as we 
are relaxing mask mandates and tell-
ing people that they don’t have a vac-
cination mandate anymore to be able 
to come to work or travel across our 
borders, we are hearing reports that 
the Biden administration may rescind 
title 42, so get rid of this authority 
within the next several weeks. 
And do you know what? Unless we 
have a new variant, God forbid, that 
comes in and causes a new health cri-
sis, they are probably right. Title 42 
shouldn’t be used in this way because 
it is a public health authority, not an 
immigration law. The problem is that 
if that happens—remember, we already 
have an unprecedented number of peo-
ple coming into the country. Look at 
this chart. If that happens, then all 
these folks who are being turned 
away—the orange bars here—are going 
to be coming across the border also 
without title 42 in place to have them 
be turned away. This is why the Border 
Patrol tells me—and I know the Pre-
siding Officer hears the same thing all 
the time—that they are already over-
whelmed. But they say it will be out of 
control. 
Now, some may argue it is already 
out of control. But it is going to get a 
whole lot worse. So they are worried on 
the border, and rightly so, that the cur-
rent crisis is going to become far 
worse. 
My two colleagues from Arizona, 
both Democrats, to my understanding, 
have just asked President Biden to 
keep title 42 in place. And I think that 
makes sense to keep it in place right 
now because we are not ready for a 
huge increase of migrants coming 
across the border. We can’t handle the 
current wave. The information we re-
ceived from the Department of Home-
land Security is that they are planning 
for a massive increase of migrants 
when this happens. 
I am the ranking Republican—the 
top Republican—on the Department of 
Homeland 
Security 
oversight 
com-
mittee, called the HSGAC Committee, 
or Homeland Security and Government 
Affairs Committee. We are talking to

the Department of Homeland Security, 
and they are preparing for a huge in-
crease. But their plan seems to be more 
about more buses, more planes, and 
more tents to help expedite the flow of 
these migrants into the country rather 
than figuring out a way that an immi-
gration system should work better to 
be able to say to people: Come legally. 
Come legally. Please don’t come ille-
gally—which is what these numbers 
represent. 
By the way, I am for legal immigra-
tion. I think it has enriched our coun-
try. I think it is a very important part 
of the fabric in our Nation. It makes us 
special. We brought people in from all 
over the world, including, pretty much, 
all of our parents and grandparents 
and, 
certainly, 
great-grandparents. 
Anybody who is in the Chamber, unless 
you are Native American, you came 
here or your family came here as im-
migrants. 
But 
legal 
immigration, 
while 
it 
should be encouraged, is not the same 
thing as what we are talking about 
here. We are talking about illegal 
entry, people who don’t qualify under 
the legal system. And in all of these 
countries where people are coming 
from, others are waiting in line pa-
tiently under the legal immigration 
system. 
So America, typically, is the most 
generous country in the world, year 
after year, in accepting legal immi-
grants. Sometimes, that changes based 
on the refugee flows, and we are seeing 
the refugee flows today in Poland, as 
an example. Poland is going to be the 
most generous country in the world, 
thanks to the brutal and murderous 
and cowardly attacks by Putin on that 
country. But America is a generous 
country in terms of immigrants, and 
we should be. 
But with regard to legal immigra-
tion, we are not just a country of im-
migrants—that has enriched us—we are 
also a country of laws, right? So we 
have to have some laws in place to deal 
with this illegal immigration. And, of 
course, it is not just about people com-
ing illegally. It is about all the other 
contraband that comes across the bor-
der, particularly illegal drugs. 
So I believe we have to keep title 42 
in place for now, but I also agree this 
is not a long-term solution to the crisis 
we have at the southern border. To use 
a healthcare authority to effectively 
take care of about half the illegal im-
migration coming across the border 
doesn’t make sense. 
By the way, when you see the dif-
ference here in the use of title 42, it is 
because, during the Trump years, they 
used title 42 for families and for single 
adults coming over; whereas, here, the 
Biden administration chose not to 
apply it to families for the most part. 
The vast majority of families do not 
get stopped because of title 42. It is 
just single adults, which is the vast 
majority of people coming across the 
border illegally. So that is the dif-
ference in terms of the percentage of 
use of title 42. 
So we have a real problem on our 
hands. It is already overwhelming, and 
it is about to get a lot worse. What is 
the solution? 
Well, the solution is to fix our immi-
gration laws. The foundation under-
neath all this and the problem that has 
resulted in these numbers is because 
our immigration law doesn’t work. It is 
broken, and everybody acknowledges 
that. I don’t know a Member in this 
Chamber who wouldn’t acknowledge, at 
least privately, that our immigration 
system is broken. How can you look at 
these numbers and not realize that? 
And yet we haven’t been able to find 
a bipartisan way forward. It is very 
frustrating. What we have to do is we 
have to look at the underlying laws 
and why they don’t work. 
Well, there is one reason, and it is by 
far the biggest reason. It may not be 
the only one. You can argue that we 
should put in more Border Patrol. We 
should do that. We should have more 
fencing. We should do that. But the 
biggest problem is our asylum policy in 
this country. The administration has 
implemented the asylum policy in a 
way that makes getting control of the 
border impossible. 
Now, what is asylum? Well, it is 
something to help people who really 
need relief. And it should be used for 
that, for people who have a credible 
fear of persecution. So back in their 
home country, they are being per-
secuted. They come to America, and 
they apply for asylum. We have a tradi-
tion in America of accepting those peo-
ple as we accept refugees. It is basi-
cally the same standard. But the prob-
lem is that people are coming into our 
country and claiming asylum, going 
through a long system, which we will 
talk about in a minute, not qualifying 
for asylum, and yet staying in our 
country. And this has caused a huge 
pull factor where people from all over 
the world are coming to America be-
cause they are told: Gosh, all you have 
to do is apply for asylum, and they will 
let you in, and it is unlikely that you 
will ever have to leave. 
That is how the system works now. I 
mean, that is just the honest truth, 
and I think if you talk to anybody who 
is objective about this, they will admit 
it. 
Now, some people think: We should 
not have the asylum policy act as our 
immigration 
policy. 
These 
people 
should just be allowed to come in. 
There are some people who believe 
that. My belief is we ought to stick 
with the legal immigration system— 
again, the most generous in the world 
in most years—and say that, for asy-
lum, let’s limit it to people who actu-
ally qualify for asylum. Let’s not let 
people misuse the system to gain entry 
into the United States. 
By the way, the people who are mis-
using it are the smugglers because it is 
the smugglers who go to the family, 
let’s say, in a country like Ecuador or 
Guatemala, and they say: Give me a 
bunch of money—like 10,000 bucks, 
which is a lot of money for a poor fam-
ily in one of these countries—and I will 
get your kids or you and your kids into 
the United States and get them in 
school, get you a job, because America 
has this crazy asylum policy where you 
can just do that. 
And we will talk about how that 
works in a second, but that is a pull 
factor. 
I recently went to Latin America and 
met with the Presidents of Mexico and 
Guatemala and Ecuador and Colombia. 
They all said the same thing, which is 
this: Please change your policies be-
cause it is a pull factor. You are taking 
some of our best and brightest people, 
and they all want to come to the Amer-
ican border and go across because they 
know this is how they can get into 
your country. You have a legal immi-
gration system where people stay here 
and apply and go through the process. 
That is fine. But change your asylum 
policy. 
Now, that may surprise some people. 
People may think: Well, the Presidents 
of those countries might like when peo-
ple leave and send money back to their 
family. 
But, no, they don’t want to lose all 
these people, and that is what is hap-
pening. Look at these numbers. That is 
what is happening. 
By the way, it is not just people who 
are from Central America and Mexico. 
So here is an interesting chart that I 
asked my team to put together. These 
are encounters at the southwest bor-
der—so when somebody gets stopped, 
apprehended by the Border Patrol—of 
people who are not from either Mexico 
or the Northern Triangle. 
So look at how this has increased. 
Back in 2018, there were very few peo-
ple coming across the border illegally 
who weren’t from Mexico or Central 
America, the so-called Northern Tri-
angle countries. Look at what happens 
here. You have a huge increase of peo-
ple coming over the border who are 
from other countries. 
So I was told today that there were 
people coming over the border this 
year from 150 countries. You probably 
heard 
the 
stories 
of 
people 
from 
Ukraine, a country that is under siege 
by Russia. You can’t blame the people 
for leaving that country. And I have 
been to Poland, on the border, re-
cently, and I have seen the refugees 
there. But some of these refugees are 
actually coming to Mexico and then 
finding their way to the southern bor-
der and coming across the southern 
border, from Ukraine and also from 
Russia. And the Border Patrol has con-
firmed that for me. 
So this has ticked up as this conflict 
continues. Why? Because they know 
the easiest way to get into America is 
to walk across the southern border and 
you claim asylum and you get in. 
Now, we have just decided to bring 
100,000 refugees in from Ukraine be-
cause of this crisis. So maybe that will 
be a way that more people can come. 
They don’t have to come through the

southern border. But now, they know 
this is the easy way to come in. And 
look at these numbers. 
So it is not just people, again, from 
Mexico and Central America. Now, it is 
people from all over the world. And for 
some of these people, the Border Patrol 
is nervous because they come from 
countries where there are a lot of peo-
ple who want to do us harm. So people 
are coming in from countries in the 
Middle East, as an example. They are 
concerned and for good reason. 
So what happens when you come to 
the border and you claim asylum? 
So, after you tell the Border Patrol 
that you would like to claim asylum, 
you then are permitted to come into 
the country, assuming you meet a 
basic standard where you say the right 
things about having a credible fear of 
persecution, and you get in line for an 
asylum determination. So you come to 
Washington, DC, or my hometown of 
Cincinnati or Tucson, AZ—wherever it 
is—and your wait is between 4 and 6 
years. Others say it is 4 to 8 years be-
cause of the appeals process, but let’s 
say it is 4 to 6 years—so an average of 
5 years that you are in the United 
States, waiting for your asylum re-
quest to be adjudicated. 
What happens during that time pe-
riod? Well, you are able to work. Your 
kids are able to go to school. You get 
embedded into the community, as you 
might imagine. Some people show up 
for their court cases; some people 
don’t. They are in the community. 
They probably feel it is unlikely they 
will be deported. So it is not a system 
that works well to have that kind of a 
lag time. 
By the way, there are 1.5 million peo-
ple in this category—1.5 million people 
in this backlog. Does this make any 
sense? 
Here is what is most unusual about 
this process, I will say: At the end of 
the process, when the asylum adjudica-
tion is made, do you know what hap-
pens? Most people are told: I am sorry. 
You don’t qualify. 
In fact, the latest information that 
we have from the Department of Home-
land Security is that immigration 
judges granted asylum to roughly 2,400 
migrants in fiscal year 2021. These, 
again, all originated with a credible 
fear claim, a credible fear of persecu-
tion in their home countries—2,400. 
That is just 14 percent of such cases 
completed. That would mean, in terms 
of these cases, these numbers we have 
here, that roughly 85 percent or 86 per-
cent of the people who applied, who 
went through the process, were not 
granted asylum. 
Now, I have heard different numbers 
here, but I have never heard somebody 
tell me a number that is close to 50 
percent. So, the majority of people who 
go through this whole process wait 4 to 
6 years and finally have their court 
cases heard. Again, in fiscal year 2021, 
it would appear it was 2,400 in removal. 
That would be just 14 percent of such 
cases completed. The vast majority 
don’t meet our standard. 
So who are these people? They are 
economic refugees. Who can blame 
them for wanting to come to the 
United States of America? If I lived in 
one of these countries and wanted to 
look out for my kids and my family, as 
we all do, I might do the same thing. 
I don’t agree with people who say: 
Oh, these folks are coming over here to 
use our welfare and to commit crimes. 
Some of them do—we know that—both 
of those things, but I think the vast 
majority of them come here—and I 
have talked to a lot of them, as has the 
Presiding Officer. If you go to the bor-
der, you meet these people. These are 
families who are poor and who are 
looking for a better life, a higher sal-
ary, better healthcare, a future for 
their kids, but they are not coming le-
gally, and that is the issue. Economic 
refugees don’t qualify as asylees. They 
don’t meet the standard to come in 
under the asylum process. They have 
to come in under the legal immigration 
system. 
Look, it is a complicated issue, but 
in some respects, it is really very sim-
ple, isn’t it? We have a process here in 
our country now whereby, if you show 
up to the border and you claim asylum 
and you get in, there is a very good 
chance, although you will not have 
your claim adjudicated favorably, that 
you will end up being able to just stay 
in the United States. 
There is discussion about how many 
people are actually deported once they 
are put into removal. In other words, if 
they are told they don’t meet the 
standards and are put into removal, are 
they deported? Well, the priority of 
Homeland Security—and, again, we are 
the oversight committee for this—is 
people who have criminal records and 
people who are terrorists, who pose 
some threat to the country. That 
means, for the vast majority of the 
people, they are not going to be 
prioritized in terms of removal. There 
is also an opportunity to appeal. That 
is why some people say it is not 4 to 6 
years but that it is 4 to 8 years. But 
let’s say it is even 4 years. That is a 
long time to wait—1.5 million people. 
Now, I am told that the administra-
tion is coming up with a new rule to 
help deal with this issue, and I was ini-
tially very encouraged when I heard 
about this. 
What I have been asking for, for some 
time, is a system where we adjudicate 
these cases at the border as soon as 
people come across, yes or no. Let peo-
ple know. If it is no, go back home, and 
apply legally. If it is yes, come on into 
the United States. You then are a legal 
immigrant. Eventually, you qualify for 
a green card, and eventually you qual-
ify for citizenship because you are an 
asylee, like a refugee. But let’s do that 
adjudication at the border when people 
come. That is what the law says. It 
says people should be detained until 
they are adjudicated, but it is not what 
we do. 
I have been pushing for Congress to 
actually fund this effort—it is going to 
be expensive—of places where people 
can be humanely detained during a 
short period of time while they actu-
ally go before an immigration official 
who can determine, yes, you are in or, 
no, you don’t qualify, rather than wait-
ing years and years, as we do now. 
Again, 1.5 million people are in limbo 
who are in the United States. 
So I was sort of excited when I heard 
that the administration was coming up 
with a new rule for quicker decisions. I 
think that makes sense. However, I am 
learning more about this proposed rule. 
It appears to be another asylum appeal 
on top of an already backlogged asy-
lum system. This is why I say that: It 
adds an asylum officer to the process— 
who is on the border—and when a per-
son comes forward and says ‘‘I have a 
credible fear of persecution, and I want 
to claim asylum,’’ this individual, who 
is not a judge but who is an asylum of-
ficer and is trained, is able to either 
approve or deny the case. 
The problem is, if you approve the 
person, the person comes in and, again, 
eventually gets a green card and be-
comes a legal immigrant, but if the 
person is denied, apparently the indi-
vidual then goes into the regular proc-
ess and can immediately appeal to an 
immigration judge. It just adds an-
other layer that can be appealed. So I 
am concerned about that. 
Now, I am told that there will be an 
effort to speed up an immigration 
judge’s decision under this process. So, 
if there is an officer at the border who 
makes the initial determination and if 
the initial determination is no, then 
the judge would have to act more 
quickly than the 4 to 6 years that are 
currently in place. So that would be an 
improvement. That would be an im-
provement if it could be faster, but I 
am not sure how that is going to hap-
pen because the reason it is 4 to 6 years 
is that there is a 1.5 million-person 
backlog. 
My view would be, as people are com-
ing in, they ought to be adjudicated 
quickly, yes or no. If it is yes, come on 
in. If it is no, go back home. That 
would send a message to the next group 
who is being told by these smugglers 
we talked about: You know, just pay 
me this money, and I will get you into 
America. Your kids can go to school, 
and you can go to work. 
I fear that, unless we fix this system, 
it is going to give those human smug-
glers even more opportunities to en-
courage unlawful migration. 
By the way, this comes at a time 
when the DHS recently reported to 
Congress that several million migrants 
in the Western Hemisphere are getting 
ready to start their journey to the 
United States. Why? Because they 
know title 42, which we talked about 
earlier, is going to disappear. It is in 
the orange here. So this is a time 
when, apparently, there are more peo-
ple who are thinking about coming. We 
know as we have seen the caravans and 
so on. That is not something that we 
want to go through again. It is a pull

factor, as I said earlier. It is pulling 
people to the border. It is giving the 
coyotes, the traffickers, the smugglers 
the ability to make lots of money and 
to bring people, again, not just from 
Mexico and Central America but from 
all over the world. 
By the way, the journey north is a 
dangerous one. I know everybody has 
heard about that and has seen that. We 
saw recently that there was a tractor- 
trailer full of migrants that crashed, 
and dozens of people were killed. We 
know about the sexual assaults of 
women, girls, boys. We know about the 
human trafficking that occurs in con-
nection with this. We know about the 
cartels that are involved with this 
smuggling and how much they charge 
people. 
By the way, just last year, there were 
10,000 requests for Border Patrol help 
from people who were in distress be-
cause they were left in the desert to 
their own devices. They needed water 
or they needed food. They needed to be 
rescued. There have been over 10,000 
cases wherein the Border Patrol has 
gone and rescued migrants who were 
left by these smugglers in the middle of 
the desert. 
So this is not a system that we 
should hold up as a good system. This 
is a system that is broken and corrupt, 
and the people making money, again, 
are the cartels. 
Drug cartels, by the way, are very in-
volved in this. So it is about people, 
but it is also about drugs, and we all 
know this. They know when the Border 
Patrol agents are being taken offline to 
process people who are coming into the 
country, which leaves wide-open gaps 
for them to transport drugs into Amer-
ica. I saw it when I was down there last 
year. 
I was down more recently also. What 
I saw was—we were out at night, and a 
group of migrants was coming, and the 
Border Patrol was going to that loca-
tion to stop them and to question 
them. Meanwhile, the drug smugglers 
came across. We all heard it on the 
radio, and you could see it, but what 
could they do? They were distracted. 
Fentanyl is the deadliest of the 
drugs. This is the synthetic opioid that 
is killing more people than is any other 
drug. About two-thirds of the people 
who die of overdoses in my home State 
of Ohio and probably in the Presiding 
Officer’s State are dying from fentanyl 
or from a variant of fentanyl. 
It used to come from China—through 
the mail, for the most part. We did a 
pretty good job of stopping that, in-
cluding with legislation called the 
STOP Act, which I was proud to be a 
part of. Yet it is like Whac-A-Mole, 
wherein you stop it here, and it starts 
somewhere else, and now it is coming 
in from Mexico. A lot of the analogs 
and a lot of the precursors are coming 
from China, still, into Mexico. It is 
then being made into either a pill or 
into some other substance that comes 
into the United States. 
I do a lot of work in this area in 
terms of the prevention and the treat-
ment and the longer term recovery, 
and I think that that is really the most 
important part—to stop the demand. 
But I have got to tell you that it is 
really hard right now for people who 
are interested in helping on the treat-
ment side or in law enforcement back 
home because this stuff is flooding 
across the border. It means that the 
supply has gone up, and it means it is 
so cheap. Law enforcement in Ohio told 
me that it is cheaper than marijuana 
on the street—fentanyl—and that it is 
being pressed into pills that say things 
like ‘‘Xanax’’ or ‘‘Percocet.’’ Unfortu-
nately, people are taking those pills, 
not knowing it has fentanyl, and some 
are dying of overdoses immediately. 
Last year in Ohio, we had, unfortu-
nately, a record level of overdose 
deaths again. In America, the same was 
true—100,000 people died of overdoses 
from these drugs. Again, probably 60 
percent—two-thirds—in 
Ohio 
were 
dying of fentanyl. 
Last year, we had a 40-percent in-
crease in fentanyl coming over the 
southern border, which is based on ap-
prehensions. By the way, Border Patrol 
will tell you, when you go and talk to 
them, that they are not stopping a lot 
of it because they don’t have the abil-
ity; they don’t have the resources. But 
it is a true crisis—four times as much 
as in 2019. According to the CDC, 
fentanyl and these other synthetic 
opioids are the biggest dangers. 
A few months ago, I was in Nogales, 
which is south of Tucson, where the 
Presiding Officer lives. I was there to 
ride with the Border Patrol and to go 
to the port of entry and meet with the 
Border Patrol and customs officials. 
They are doing an awesome job with 
what they have—a 24/7 job—to try to 
protect our Nation from these nar-
cotics and these bad actors, who come 
from around the world now and try to 
enter through this vulnerable southern 
border, and just to deal with the mi-
grant flow that we talked about. It was 
pretty alarming. They need better 
equipment. They need help. They need 
more resources. They need better tech-
nology to be able to scan the cars and 
trucks that are coming in, particularly 
for the drugs we talked about. 
Fentanyl, by the way—a relatively 
small package—can kill thousands of 
people, so you can hide this stuff in a 
car or in a truck much more easily. 
Some of the ports of entry have more 
technology than others, but here is the 
average: Less than 2 percent of the pas-
senger vehicles and less than 20 percent 
of the commercial vehicles coming into 
the United States are scanned for ille-
gal drugs, like fentanyl. Those are the 
numbers. It is unacceptable. A smug-
gler with multiple pounds of fentanyl 
concealed in a hidden compartment, 
who is going to make hundreds of thou-
sands or millions of dollars on that, 
has a very good chance of getting 
across the border without a search. It 
is not a gap in our security; it is a gap-
ing hole, and it helps lead to this flood 
of cheap fentanyl and other dangerous 
drugs. Last year, Customs and Border 
Protection seized nearly 10,000 pounds 
of deadly fentanyl—again, a 40-percent 
increase from 2020. 
We also face challenges between the 
ports of entry. In Nogales, the Border 
Patrol Agent in Charge I rode with 
showed me huge gaps in the fencing 
and described an overwhelming, record-
breaking number of unlawful migrants 
and drugs coming into the United 
States and of the urgent need, as he 
told me, for more agents, more trucks, 
and more technology, including cam-
eras and sensors. These gaps and bro-
ken areas of fencing that need repairs, 
it is just inexcusable. We should fix 
them. 
By the way, the smugglers know 
where these gaps are. The human 
smugglers know well. The gap I saw, 
there were all kinds of bottles and old 
backpacks and stuff where people had 
discarded things as they come across 
the border. And you could see the 
trails. You could see the tracks where 
people had come across because they 
know where the breaks are in the fenc-
ing. So this is a system that is broken. 
The difference between what was 
happening here at the end of the last 
administration and this system is 
there were changes in policy that were 
put in place right away. One widely re-
ported one was the one to stop the in-
stallation of the fencing on day one via 
Executive order. 
By the way, fencing alone is not 
enough. You have to have technology 
that goes with it. But, unfortunately, 
they stopped the technology too. 
I was in El Paso probably a year and 
a half ago, and they showed me the 
gaps in the wall, and maybe 80 percent 
of the fencing was done; and then 20 
percent was openings where, unfortu-
nately, 24/7, the Border Patrol had to 
be there or else people would just come 
across. So it wasn’t slowing anybody 
down. 
But I focused on the technology be-
cause you want the sensors and the 
cameras and all that. The fence itself is 
not as effective. In fact, it is not very 
effective at all if it doesn’t have the 
technology. 
They said 90 percent of the tech-
nology had yet to be installed because 
of that decision on day one of the Exec-
utive order because it stopped all the 
technology, too. 
And I know my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle and I talk about 
this a lot. They are for the technology 
because they understand this is an 
issue. But somehow, I don’t know, this 
issue just is one where there is a dis-
connect between the clearly broken 
system and what we were able to get 
together and do on a bipartisan basis. 
Since the President’s inauguration, 
the southern border has faced the 
worst unlawful migration crisis we 
have had. The men and women of the 
Border Patrol—Customs and Border 
Protection—I have met over the years 
are doing the best they can. We need to 
help them more. They have got really 
difficult jobs right now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1854 
March 30, 2022 
For the Border Patrol, I am working 
on bipartisan legislation to increase 
the number of agents, address reten-
tion challenges of the existing work-
force—they are losing people—and let 
them respond faster to humanitarian 
crises, including having a Border Pa-
trol reserve they can call on where peo-
ple are qualified and ready to help. 
The ongoing crisis at our southern 
border is clear, and it is persistent. It 
is not seasonal anymore, if you look at 
these numbers. 
Again, we welcome legal immigrants. 
We always should. They enrich our 
country. But we are both a nation of 
laws and immigrants. 
I urge the Biden administration to 
change course, to fix this broken sys-
tem, to fix and reform this asylum 
process that acts as a pool factor to 
America, to stop these policies that 
send a green light to the human smug-
glers and the drug traffickers that 
leads to so much human suffering and 
a border that is not secure. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF JANUARY CONTRERAS 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate will soon vote on an important 
nomination 
to 
the 
Department 
of 
Health and Human Services. January 
Contreras is President Biden’s choice 
to serve as Assistant Secretary for 
children and families. 
The Senate Finance Committee is 
taking a special interest in kids, fami-
lies, and fresh approaches to strength-
en opportunities for them and for 
America’s future. 
Now, people have been a little bit 
surprised that the Finance Committee 
is taking this big interest because, nor-
mally, they think that the Finance 
Committee deals primarily with big 
money issues. Taxes and trade would 
be two examples. 
Those are certainly very, very impor-
tant, and we spend plenty of time 
working on those. But the committee 
also feels very strongly that we can’t 
afford to write off the hopes and 
dreams of our future, which are our 
kids and our families. We can’t afford, 
as a country, to lose these young minds 
and these young families, to take away 
the kinds of opportunities they could 
have with just a few well-targeted, sen-
sible investments in their future. And 
when January Contreras is confirmed, 
that is exactly the kind of work that 
she is going to be doing: caring for 
some of the most vulnerable young 
people in our Nation, those young peo-
ple who are in the child welfare sys-
tem. 
One of the big challenges in the last 
few years of the Administration for 
Children and Families has been the im-
plementation of our bipartisan Family 
First Prevention Services Act. This 
was an extraordinarily important law, 
particularly for kids who are in foster 
care. 
We had, until this law came along, 
essentially two choices for these kids. 
We could send them off to a foster 
home. Some of them might be good; 
some of them we know aren’t so good. 
Or we could leave them in a family sit-
uation at home that wasn’t too desir-
able. You might have a parent who had 
been caught up in drugs or alcohol or 
something else. 
What the Finance Committee did in 
enacting the Family First Prevention 
Services Act is it said: We have got 
these two choices over here, neither of 
them are ideal. What we will do is cre-
ate a third path, which is the Family 
First Prevention Services Act. 
So, for example, for a family in Ari-
zona—the 
Presiding 
Officer’s 
home 
State—that family would be in a posi-
tion to stay together but also to re-
ceive some of the services—the anti- 
drug services, the efforts to get people 
off alcohol and addiction—and keep the 
family together. Very often, a grand-
parent would help out. 
Family First is, in my view, the fu-
ture of much of our domestic policy in 
this country because it means we 
aren’t going to write off our kids and 
families caught up in the child welfare 
system. 
The bill was bipartisan. Chairman 
Hatch was then the chairman. I was 
the ranking member. I think this bill is 
a once-in-a-generation overhaul of how 
child welfare works in America. 
As I described to the Presiding Offi-
cer, before Family First, families, in 
effect in Arizona and elsewhere, were 
broken apart by default. In other 
words, you had the two choices, neither 
of them very good. Family First—put 
together on a bipartisan basis in the 
Finance Committee—recognized that 
young people grow up better at home, 
and families have an incredible capac-
ity to deal with the proper support. So 
we signed Family First to help families 
stay together whenever it is safe and 
possible. 
As I mentioned, maybe the parent 
needs a little help with substance 
abuse or mental health treatment; get-
ting clean will make the home safe and 
the community often safer. 
And, as I have mentioned, I was par-
ticularly thrilled that we could look to 
grandparents once again to step in as a 
caretaker for their grandkids, because 
when I was a young member of the 
other body, I wrote the Kinship Care 
bill, which was something that really 
came out of America’s churches, where 
grandparents could step in and provide 
a compassionate role model and care-
taker for the grandkids. The new ap-
proach builds that smart flexibility 
into the system so the kids and fami-
lies could get the support they need. 
In my view, it is especially important 
right now to help address mental 
health. The Finance Committee had a 
hearing today on that. Senator CRAPO 
and I have vowed to have a bipartisan 
bill on that. And it is particularly im-
portant to have Family First right now 
because it allows us to address mental 
health 
and 
substance 
abuse 
and 
strengthen families at the same time. 
This is what families are all about. 
Now, implementing the law takes a 
lot of close collaboration between the 
Federal Government and the States. It 
has not been easy. The previous admin-
istration made it pretty challenging. 
But because this is a bipartisan pri-
ority for the Finance Committee, we 
just pushed ahead. And I am especially 
looking forward to working with Ms. 
Contreras on that task. 
Ms. Contreras and I have some work 
experience that might be of interest to 
the Presiding Officer. Ms. Contreras led 
the Arizona Legal Women and Youth 
Services, a legal aid organization for 
children and young adults who have ex-
perienced abuse, neglect, family sepa-
ration, homelessness, and human traf-
ficking. 
Before my time in the Congress, I ran 
the Oregon legal services for the elder-
ly program, a legal aid program spe-
cially for seniors. And then the rest of 
the time I was codirector of the Oregon 
Gray Panthers helping, again, families 
and seniors and others. Back then, sen-
iors were constantly getting clobbered 
by insurance scams and bill collectors, 
and somebody needed to be there for 
them. So Ms. Contreras is very, very 
qualified for this job—qualified to steer 
Family First into a period of excep-
tional progress because States are real-
ly hungry for this option, the option 
that makes a big difference because it 
ensures that we are not writing off our 
families; we are not giving up on them. 
That is something that I think is 
particularly important to hear from 
our Finance Committee members be-
cause everybody thinks that the com-
mittee just focuses on all these things 
with Big Money, but we are especially 
interested in seeing nominees like Ms. 
Contreras come forward. 
I think she will do a terrific job as 
the head of the Administration for 
Children and Families. She is going to 
do a terrific job of moving Family 
First ahead. She had bipartisan sup-
port in the Senate Finance Committee. 
I urge all Members of the Senate to 
vote for January Contreras when she 
comes up later this evening. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTE ON CONTRERAS NOMINATION 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I know 
of no further debate on the nomina-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the question is, 
Will the Senate advise and consent to 
the Contreras nomination? 
Mr. JOHNSON. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The nomination was confirmed. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the mo-
tion to reconsider is considered made 
and laid upon the table, and the Presi-
dent will be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s actions. 
NOMINATION OF DAVID WEIL 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, right 
now, we are in the midst of a strong 
economic 
recovery 
and 
record 
job 
growth. 
But despite the progress we have 
made, the fact remains that during this 
pandemic, corporations and rich CEOs 
made huge profits, while workers still 
struggle to make ends meet and put 
food on the table. 
If we want to build back an economy 
that works for everyone, not just those 
at the very top, then we need be taking 
action to lower costs, like Democrats 
have been pushing for, and we need 
leaders at the Department of Labor 
who are committed to ensuring work-
ers get every cent of the paychecks 
they earn and holding corporations ac-
countable when they try to take ad-
vantage of workers and commit wage 
theft. 
Dr. David Weil has a long history as 
a champion for workers, and I come to 
the floor today to make clear: He is the 
exact right person to lead the Wage 
and Hour Division of the DOL. 
Dr. Weil is an exceptional choice for 
this role with just the right experience 
for the job; in fact, he has already 
served in this position under the 
Obama administration. During his past 
tenure, he proved himself a capable 
leader, with a steadfast commitment to 
a simple goal: ensuring workers across 
the country are paid the wages they 
earn. 
It was under his leadership that the 
Wage and Hour Division boosted its ef-
forts to enforce the critical set of laws 
that protect workers against employ-
ers undercutting the minimum wage, 
failing to pay overtime, forcing work-
ers to work ‘‘off the clock,’’ and so 
much more. 
These are protections that workers 
depend on, especially workers who earn 
low wages, women, and people of color 
who most often face wage theft. 
So we have got to make sure corpora-
tions are following them—and that is 
exactly 
what 
David 
Weil 
did. 
He 
cracked down on corporations who vio-
lated the law and denied workers the 
pay they were owed, and at one point, 
the division even uncovered an inves-
tigation into garment factories that se-
cured $1.3 million in back pay for 
cheated workers. 
While leading the Agency, he also 
worked to expand overtime pay for 12 
million more workers, close loopholes 
to 
help 
stop 
employers 
from 
misclassifying workers in order to pay 
them less, and crack down on Federal 
contractors who weren’t following the 
law and paying fair wages. It has been 
frustrating to see the previous admin-
istration undermine these efforts and 
reverse this progress, but confirming 
David Weil to return to the Wage and 
Hour Division is an important step to 
put workers first and get us back on 
the right track. A vote for Dr. Weil is 
a vote to put wages back in workers’ 
pockets and a vote to hold corporations 
accountable for wage theft. 
So I urge all my colleagues to join 
me today in sending Dr. Weil back to 
the DOL.

f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. OSSOFF. Madam President, in 
just a moment—in just a moment—I 
am going to ask that the Senate do 
something that we should have done 
months ago. 
In just a moment, I am going to ask 
that 
this 
body 
confirm 
Deborah 
Lipstadt to serve as the Special Envoy 
to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism 
on behalf of the United States. 
My great-grandparents, Israel and 
Annie, arrived in this country in 1911 
and 1913, fleeing anti-Semitism in East-
ern Europe. Their story is like the 
story of so many Jewish immigrants 
and refugees who came to the United 
States because the free exercise of reli-
gion is guaranteed by the First Amend-
ment of the U.S. Constitution. And 
when I stood just there and was sworn 
into the U.S. Senate, I held in my 
breast pocket copies of the ships’ mani-
fests logging their arrivals at Ellis Is-
land. 
We had a confirmation hearing for 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson in the 
Judiciary Committee last week, and I 
had a discussion with Judge Jackson 
about what that means, the free exer-
cise of religion. 
This country has drawn immigrants 
and refugees from around the world be-
cause it is a place where you are pro-
tected from persecution, no matter 
how you worship. That is what Amer-
ica stands for. 
It is time for the Senate, at long last, 
to confirm this nominee to fight anti- 
Semitism around the world on behalf of 
the United States, standing up for 
those values. 
It was U.S. forces who liberated Da-
chau and Buchenwald. And Annie and 
Israel, my great-grandparents, they got 
out of Europe. Many of my family did 
not, and they perished in the Holo-
caust. 
This isn’t ancient history. This is re-
cent history. And, right now, as we 
speak, the scourge of anti-Semitism is 
rising again in this country and around 
the world. 
If we mean the words ‘‘never again,’’ 
then, at long last, let’s confirm Debo-
rah Lipstadt to fight anti-Semitism on 
behalf of the United States. 
Deborah Lipstadt comes from my 
home State of Georgia. She is the pro-
fessor of modern Jewish history and 
Holocaust studies at Emory Univer-
sity—a leading scholar of anti-Semi-
tism and the Holocaust. 
It is time for the United States to 
stand up against anti-Semitism. It is 
time, finally, for the Senate to confirm 
this nominee. 
So at this time, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate consider the fol-
lowing nomination: Calendar No. 845, 
Deborah E. Lipstadt, of Georgia, to be 
Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat 
Anti-Semitism, with the rank of Am-
bassador (New Position); that the Sen-
ate vote on the nomination without in-
tervening action or debate; that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table; that any 
statements related to the nomination 
be printed in the RECORD; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the nomination. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Deborah E. 
Lipstadt, of Georgia, to be Special 
Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti- 
Semitism, with the rank of Ambas-
sador (New Position). 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the nomination. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Lipstadt nomination? 
The nomination was confirmed. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Wisconsin. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of Jerry Kang, Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee to serve on the 
National Foundation on the Arts and 
Humanities. 
As you know, the foundation serves 
sectors of our economy that continue 
to face tremendous need and uncer-
tainty in the wake of the pandemic. 
During this trying time, it is criti-
cally important that we confirm quali-
fied individuals who are eager to serve 
and support. 
This nomination has been reviewed 
by the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions on a bipar-
tisan basis, and we are waiting on the 
Senate to confirm him so he can get to 
work. 
It is past time that we confirm quali-
fied nominees so that the Federal Gov-
ernment has a team in place—the team 
that it needs to operate and support 
our constituents. 
As an ex-officio member of the Na-
tional Council on the Arts, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate consider 
the following nomination: Calendar No. 
729, Jerry Kang, of California, to be a 
Member of the National Council on the 
Humanities for a term expiring Janu-
ary 26, 2026; that the Senate vote on 
the nomination without intervening 
action or debate; that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table; and that any state-
ments related to the nomination be 
printed in the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, I guess 
this is a crazy idea, but I believe that 
Americans should not be judged by the 
color of their skin but, rather, by the 
content of their character. I believe 
that every person is made in the image 
of God, and that to judge a person sim-
ply based on the color of their skin is 
wrong. 
Unfortunately, across the country, 
politicians and universities are trying 
to divide people by race, skin color, 
ethnicity, or country of origin. It is 
immoral and a corrosive habit of the 
woke crowd. 
Unfortunately, the professional ca-
reer 
of 
this 
nominee 
is 
entirely 
wrapped up in promoting critical race 
theory and dividing people along color 
lines. His focus at the university where 
he works is to teach kids about how to 
divide one another into what Karl 
Marx referred to as the oppressed and 
the oppressors. 
I am sick of this disgusting ideology, 
and Americans are sick of it too. Just 
look at all the Americans who are re-
jecting it through local elections and 
protests at school boards. 
We shouldn’t be elevating people who 
divide Americans. We should be work-
ing with those who want to unite us 
around our founding principles that 
made our Nation the greatest country 
on Earth. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, not 
only did Jerry Kang get recommended 
by the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions on a bipar-
tisan basis, but he is a scholar and has 
a very important reputation.

S1858 
March 30, 2022 
Half of his work deals with commu-
nication and the internet on matters 
such as privacy and pervasive com-
puting and virtual communities. The 
other half, by his own description, 
deals with civil rights and race. And he 
is probably best known for his works 
on implicit bias. 
These are critical topics, and we 
should be eager to have somebody of 
Professor Kang’s caliber and commit-
ment on the Foundation on the Arts 
and Humanities, and so I am certainly 
disappointed to hear the objection from 
the Republican side.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
United Kingdom—Tomahawk Weapon 
System (TWS) Follow-On Support 
The Government of the United Kingdom 
(UK) has requested to buy follow-on support 
for all three segments of the United King-
dom’s Tomahawk Weapon System (TWS). 
This includes the All Up Round (AUR), Tac-
tical Tomahawk Weapon Control System 
(TTWCS) and Theater Mission Planning Cen-
ter (TMPC). The support includes recertifi-
cation of the UK’s missiles; unscheduled mis-
sile 
maintenance; 
spares; 
procurement; 
training; in-service support; software; hard-
ware; 
communication 
equipment; 
oper-
ational flight test; engineering and technical 
expertise to maintain the TWS capability; 
and other related elements of logistical and 
program support. The total estimated pro-
gram cost is $368.53 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy goals and national security objectives 
of the United States by improving the secu-
rity of a NATO Ally that is a force for polit-
ical stability and economic progress in Eu-
rope. 
The proposed sale will sustain the oper-
ating capability of the United Kingdom, en-
suring 
maritime 
forces’ 
interoperability 
with United States and other allied forces as 
well as their ability to contribute to mis-
sions of mutual interest by delivering follow- 
on support and sustainment. By deploying 
the Tomahawk Weapon system, the United 
Kingdom contributes to global readiness and 
enhances the capability for the U.S. forces 
operating 
globally 
alongside 
them. 
The 
United Kingdom already operates this capa-
bility, and will have no difficulty absorbing 
this equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractor will be Raytheon 
Missiles and Defense, Tucson, AZ. There are 
no known offset agreements proposed in con-
nection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require multiple trips by U.S. Government 
representatives and the assignment of con-
tractor representatives to United Kingdom 
on an intermittent basis over the life of the 
case to support delivery and integration of 
items and to provide supply support manage-
ment, inventory control and equipment fa-
miliarization. There will be one (1) U.S. Gov-
ernment representative and three (3) U.S. 
contractor representatives in the UK full- 
time for the duration of the case. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

NATIONAL COLORECTAL CANCER 
AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this 
March, as we mark National Colorectal 
Cancer Awareness Month, we must re-
member 
those 
we 
have 
lost 
to 
colorectal cancer, acknowledge the 
progress we have made to date to re-
duce colorectal cancer cases, and renew 
our commitment to fighting this dev-
astating illness. Since its inception in 
2000, 
National 
Colorectal 
Cancer 
Awareness Month has given us the op-
portunity to raise awareness and re-
mind people of the importance of can-
cer screening in the early detection 
and prevention of colorectal cancer. 
While cases of colorectal cancer have 
declined, it is still the second leading 
cause of cancer death among men and 
women combined in the U.S. This year 
alone, more than 150,000 Americans will 
be diagnosed with colorectal cancer. 
Over 52,000 people will die from the dis-
ease. In 2018, 2,597 Marylanders were di-
agnosed with colorectal cancer, and 982 
patients died from it. 
Colorectal cancer has a dispropor-
tionate impact among racial and eth-
nic 
minorities, 
particularly 
Black 
Americans, Jews of Eastern European 
descent, and Indigenous communities. 
Black men are 22 percent more likely 
than non-Hispanic White men are, and 
Black women are 18 percent more like-
ly than non-Hispanic White women to 
be diagnosed with colorectal cancer. 
American Indians and Alaska Natives 
are 10 percent more likely than non- 
Hispanic White Americans to die of 
colorectal cancer. Jews of Eastern Eu-
ropean decent are two to three times 
more likely to get colorectal cancer 
than the greater population. 
Fortunately, because of early detec-
tion and prevention tools, colorectal 
cancer is among the most preventable 
of 
all 
cancers. 
Colorectal 
cancer 
screenings not only detect the disease 
in its early stages, but can catch 
precancerous growths, or polyps, too. 
When these polyps are found, they can 
be removed and prevent cancer from 
occurring. 
Regular 
screening 
saves 
lives. Over 60 percent of deaths from 
colorectal cancer could have been pre-
vented with screening, but one in three 
adults in the U.S. aged 45 to 75 years 
old is still not getting screened as rec-
ommended. Colonoscopies are one of 
the most effective screening methods 
for colorectal cancer. 
That is why I have long worked to in-
crease access to colonoscopies. The Af-
fordable Care Act ensured that Medi-
care would cover the cost of screening 
colonoscopies without cost-sharing for 
most seniors, but the work was not 
done. Since 2013, I led the Removing 
Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screen-
ing Act with Senators Brown, Wicker, 
and Collins to ensure Medicare bene-
ficiaries would not be charged for a 
colonoscopy, regardless of whether a 
polyp or tissue is removed. This legis-
lation was included in the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act of 2021. The law de-
creases barriers to screening by ensur-
ing that seniors do not have to worry 
about unexpected medical costs if a 
polyp is detected and removed during a 
screening colonoscopy. 
I am also proud of the work Mary-
land is doing to decrease rates of 
colorectal cancer. Through the Mary-
land Colorectal Cancer Control Pro-
gram, Maryland has used funding from 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention—CDC—and the State’s CRF 
Cancer Prevention Education, Screen-
ing, and Treatment Program to pro-
mote screening. The program partners 
with local health departments, commu-
nity health centers, and various health 
systems, among other entities. Because 
of these and other initiatives, 72.5 per-
cent of adults 50 years and older in 
Maryland 
were 
up-to-date 
with 
colorectal cancer screenings in 2018, 
slightly above the Healthy People 2020 
target of 70.5 percent. 
Still, we must do more to ensure 
younger Americans are aware of their 
risks of colorectal cancer and its symp-
toms 
and 
get 
the 
appropriate

screenings to prevent and detect the 
disease. This year, Fight Colorectal 
Cancer placed 27,400 blue flags on the 
National Mall to represent the number 
of people under 50 expected to be diag-
nosed with colorectal cancer in 2030. 
The installation not only raises aware-
ness of the increase in colorectal can-
cer in this younger population but also 
serves as a tribute to all those touched 
by the disease. By 2030, colorectal can-
cer is projected to be the leading can-
cer killer for those aged 20 to 49. 
This is why continued investments in 
awareness and screening programs and 
research into effective treatments are 
so essential. Colorectal cancer research 
is one of the least funded among dif-
ferent cancers. I am proud of the work 
that the National Institutes of Health’s 
National Cancer Institute and other 
Maryland-based research institutions 
and healthcare providers have done to 
reduce colorectal cancer rates, but 
they all need more resources. 
We have made progress in combat-
ting colorectal cancer, but there is 
more work for us to do. This is why I 
will continue to work my colleagues to 
fight this terrible disease.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO TODD SCHNUCK 
∑ Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a St. Louis, MO, resi-
dent whose name and family are syn-
onymous with supermarkets across the 
Midwest. Todd Schnuck, a dedicated 
community and business leader, is 
being honored with the Glen Woodard 
Award for Outstanding Leadership in 
Public Affairs by the Food Industry As-
sociation. 
Todd Schnuck is the third family 
member of the third generation of 
Schnucks to be CEO and chairman of 
Schnucks Markets, Inc., and has been a 
community 
and 
industry 
advocate 
since entering the family business in 
the late 1980s. During the next 30 years, 
his leadership built Schnucks into the 
food industry leader it is today. 
Todd joined the family business after 
college in 1987 to help facilitate new 
acquisitions for the company. Over the 
next 
two 
decades, 
he 
would 
help 
Schnucks build its footprint through-
out the Midwest through acquisitions 
and expansion. Schnucks has over 100 
stores today and employs 15,000 associ-
ates spanning five States. In 2014, Todd 
was named CEO and chairman of 
Schnuck Markets, Inc., holding the 
same position his grandfather did when 
he started the company in 1939. 
Along with the terrific work Todd 
has done for the business of Schnucks, 
he has been an even greater commu-
nity leader. Todd has not only made 
Schnucks an employer of choice in the 
State of Missouri, but has worked 
closely with the United Way of Greater 
St. Louis. He is also currently chair-
man of the Donald Danforth Plant 
Science Center and holds board seats 
with the Opportunity Trust and the 
Arch to Park Equity Fund. 
I know firsthand what a strong advo-
cate Todd is for the food industry. He 
is in a unique position to be a credible 
voice for the supermarket industry, 
spending his career leading and grow-
ing the family business. I congratulate 
Todd on the Glen Woodard Award for 
Outstanding Leadership in Public Af-
fairs.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DONALD B. TOBIN 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
rise to recognize the outstanding lead-
ership of Donald B. Tobin, Esquire, as 
dean of the University of Maryland 
Francis Carey King School of Law, fol-
lowing his announcement that he will 
step down at the end of the 2021–2022 
academic year and return to full-time 
teaching as a member of the Maryland 
Carey Law faculty. This decision con-
cludes an 8-year chapter in service to 
the school’s 645 students, 176 faculty 
members, and thousands of alumni. 
Dean Tobin has been a tireless advo-
cate and instructor who truly treasures 
the law school community. 
Donald Tobin has been dean and pro-
fessor of law at my alma mater, the 
University of Maryland Francis King 
Carey School of Law located in Balti-
more City, since 2014. Under his leader-
ship, the law school has built upon two 
centuries of distinguished history to 
deliver its core academic mission of in-
tegrating legal theory and practice, 
serving as a resource and partner to 
neighboring communities and training 
the next generation of excellent law-
yers and leaders. As dean, he has risen 
to meet the unprecedented challenges 
of the last decade. 
Donald Tobin grew up in Columbia, 
MD, and began his career on Capitol 
Hill, as a professional staff member for 
my predecessor, the inimitable U.S. 
Senator Paul Sarbanes. Donald also 
staffed the Senate Committee on the 
Budget and the Joint Economic Com-
mittee. He worked on the Hill before, 
during, and after the time he was at-
tending law school at Georgetown Uni-
versity, where he earned his J.D. in 
1996. It was here in this Chamber that 
Donald first contributed to policy at 
the national level. He went on to serve 
as a law clerk for the Honorable 
Francis Murnaghan, Jr., of the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit 
and as an appellate attorney in the Tax 
Division of the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice. Donald remains a leading expert 
on the intersection of tax and cam-
paign finance laws, an area of law more 
critical to our democracy today than 
ever before. 
Donald was professor of law and asso-
ciate dean for academic affairs and as-
sociate dean for faculty at the Ohio 
State University Moritz College of Law 
before he decided to come back home 
to Maryland. Given his wealth of exper-
tise, I am particularly excited for him 
to rejoin the faculty as a professor in 
this next phase of his career. Donald 
has demonstrated an abiding passion 
for education, scholarship, and the pub-
lic service mission of the law school. 
He has wisely invested his time in un-
derstanding the needs of the Maryland 
legal and nonprofit community. And he 
has fostered a supportive community 
that provides personalized learning ex-
periences, which empower the school’s 
students to realize countless possible 
career pathways. 
Donald has always provided a wel-
coming presence around the school. He 
has taught the popular ‘‘Lawyers as 
Leaders’’ class, and he has put his tax 
law knowledge and Maryland Bar mem-
bership to use by working with stu-
dents in the Low-Income Taxpayer 
Clinic. 
The Clinical Law Program makes ex-
periential education a core component 
of the law school’s curriculum, and it 
makes advancing access to justice a 
prerequisite for graduation. This pro-
gram is unique among law schools na-
tionally. 
The law school requires every stu-
dent who initially enrolls as a first 
year, full-time day student to provide 
legal services to people who are poor or 
otherwise lack access to justice in 
order to graduate—a provision known 
as the ‘‘Cardin Requirement,’’ which I 
championed. It attracts students who 
care deeply about their clients and 
their communities. 
It is no surprise that students at-
tracted to a law school for its spirit of 
excellence in public service would 
choose someone of Donald’s character 
for its leader. He brings that same per-
sonal attention to the law school’s re-
lationships among its many constitu-
ents, the bar, and the surrounding com-
munity. 
Donald’s positivity and kind nature 
were critical to his success throughout 
a deanship ‘‘book-ended’’ by unthink-
able events. In the aftermath of the 
killing of Freddie Gray in the spring of 
2015, Donald led efforts to expand the 
law school’s positive impact in the 
community, 
bolstering 
channels 
to 
local volunteer opportunities and pro-
viding forums for students and faculty 
to explore the systemic causes that led 
to Baltimore’s unrest and to possible 
solutions. 
Donald 
redoubled 
the 
school’s efforts to recruit and retain 
highly qualified and diverse students, 
while keeping legal education acces-
sible and affordable. Our law firms, ju-
dicial benches, and nonprofit leader-
ship should all equitably reflect Mary-
land’s population. Donald’s commit-
ment to facilitating an inclusive law 
school community has brought us clos-
er to this imperative. 
As a member of the Law School 
Board of Visitors, I greatly appreciate 
Donald’s support for establishing the 
Honorable Elijah E. Cummings ‘76 
Scholarship Endowment at the law 
school in 2019. The scholarship pays apt 
tribute to our former colleague—an-
other luminary of the Maryland con-
gressional delegation—and to his many 
contributions to his District and to our

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1864 
March 30, 2022 
Nation as one of our most distin-
guished alumni. Board of visitors mem-
ber and former chair Bob Kim—class of 
1983—has spearheaded establishing the 
scholarship, which will support law 
school students who have an interest in 
public service, a record of academic ex-
cellence, and demonstrated financial 
need. 
Toward what would be the end of his 
time as dean, Donald maintained a co-
hesive law school community despite 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Sustained 
high turnout at virtual versions of be-
loved events such as the alumni honors 
banquet and Morris Brown Myerowitz 
Moot Court Competition evinced this 
resilience and unity, with alumni vol-
unteers serving as mock judges or 
interviewers, during a time of social 
distancing. 
Even before the global pandemic, 
Donald took an active role in pro-
tecting student health and well-being, 
instituting Kindness Week to promote 
student resources and self-care in part-
nership with the board of visitors. 
William Butler Yeats wrote, ‘‘Edu-
cation is not the filling of a pot but the 
lighting of a fire.’’ For over 20 years 
now, Donald Tobin has been lighting 
fires among his students, and their 
glow has brought light to the law 
school community, the city, our State, 
and the Nation. I thank him for his tre-
mendous service to the law school’s 
students, faculty, staff and alumni, and 
I wish him well on this exciting new 
chapter in his exemplary career.∑

TRIBUTE TO KATERYNA RIDLEY 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
honored to recognize Kateryna Ridley 
of Dover as March’s Granite Stater of 
the Month. Kateryna, who is originally 
from Ukraine, is spearheading efforts 
in Dover to support her home country 
after Putin’s unconscionable invasion 
of Ukraine. 
As Kateryna watched Russia’s at-
tack, she agonized over whether her 
friends and family in Ukraine were safe 
or had access to essential goods. As she 
continued to receive worrying calls 
from friends and family, she decided 
that she needed to take action to help 
her Ukrainian community. 
Kateryna’s effort started with a trip 
to the store to buy blue and yellow 
paint, along with wood and other sup-
plies that she used to create small 
Ukrainian flags. She went on to share 
her creations over social media, and 
within 4 days, she received 100 orders 
from people who were eager to show 
their support for Ukraine. Today, the 
total number of orders is well over 300, 
and Kateryna is donating her profits to 
help get Ukrainians everyday neces-
sities. 
Kateryna also spearheaded efforts to 
collect donations such as medical sup-
plies, first aid, personal hygiene sup-
plies, and baby items to send to 
Ukraine. She coordinated with Dover 
community leaders to organize a dona-
tion drive for Ukraine at a recent rally, 
and she was overjoyed with the re-
sponse from her community as count-
less neighbors donated goods and came 
up to her to express their support and 
sympathy for the people of Ukraine. 
During a time of immense duress— 
worrying for the safety of her family 
and friends back at home—Kateryna 
has found a way to make a real dif-
ference. From working in her woodshop 
for hours, to organizing donations of 
essential goods to Ukraine, Kateryna is 
working hard from the Granite State 
to reach her Ukrainian community 
during their time of need. I commend 
her for her efforts and for her spirit, 
which reflects the best of our State. 
Kateryna is one of many Granite 
Staters, representing our Live Free or 
Die State, who is stepping up to sup-
port Ukrainians amid Putin’s horrific 
war. As the U.S. and our allies con-
tinue to impose crippling sanctions on 
Russia and send military and humani-
tarian aid to Ukraine, individual ef-
forts from people like Kateryna are 
making 
a 
tangible 
difference 
in 
Ukrainians’ lives. They are showing 
Ukrainians and the world that New 
Hampshire—and the United States— 
stands with them, for their freedom 
and democracy.∑

TRIBUTE TO OFFICER MARANDA 
GRAYSON 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, everyone 
sworn law enforcement officer knows 
full well that he or she is never truly 
off-duty. On February 27, 2022, Louis-
ville Metro Department of Corrections 
officer, Maranda Grayson, was relaxing 
at home when she heard gunshots. She 
immediately retrieved her duty weap-
on, called for emergency services, and 
ran toward the gunfire outside, where 
she discovered a badly injured neighbor 
and saw a bleeding child being carried 
inside. Unable to locate the source of 
the gunfire, Officer Grayson focused 
her initial actions on the wounded 
child. A trained first responder, she ap-
plied a dressing to his hand and then 
returned outside, where she performed 
CPR on the adult victim until addi-
tional emergency services arrived. 
These were moments of true heroism, 
which probably seemed like hours to 
Officer Grayson and the victims. For 
these actions, she has been recognized 
with her department’s Award of Valor 
for ‘‘bravery above and beyond the call 
of duty when facing grave and immi-
nent danger to her own life.’’ 
Louisville Metro Department of Cor-
rections director Dwayne Clark said 
that ‘‘she represents the neighbor we 
all want.’’ I couldn’t agree more, and I 
am proud to honor Officer Grayson for 
her professionalism and tremendous 
bravery.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO GILDA JACOBS 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor an accomplished and 
highly regarded leader in Michigan’s 
field of public service, Gilda Jacobs 
who recently retired from serving as 
president and CEO of the Michigan 
League for Public Policy. Gilda has 
made an immeasurable impact on the 
Detroit metropolitan area and the 
State of Michigan over the past 30 
years, and it is a privilege to recognize 
her here today and celebrate her retire-
ment. 
Gilda began her career as an educa-
tor, graduating from the University of 
Michigan in 1971 with a masters in be-
havioral science in education. Fol-
lowing her graduation, Gilda began 
working as a special education teacher 
in the Madison School District in Oak-
land County, MI. Gilda taught one of 
the Detroit region’s first classes for 
children with emotional disabilities. It 
was her role as a leader in the rapidly 
developing field of special education 
services that led her to begin engaging 
in local activism, community organiza-
tions, and politics. 
In 1978, she was asked to work first as 
the campaign manager and then as a 
district office manager for newly-elect-
ed State Senator Doug Ross. In helping 
Senator Ross launch his political ca-
reer, Jacobs set in motion the begin-
ning of her own. In 1981, after a conten-
tious election, Gilda was elected to the 
Huntington Woods City Commission, 
the first woman to do so. In 1994, she 
ran for and was elected to serve her 
community as an Oakland County 
Commissioner. Four years after this, 
she was elected to serve two terms in 
Michigan’s House of Representatives. 
At this time, I represented a portion of 
her district in the State senate and had 
the pleasure of collaborating with her 
on many initiatives on behalf of our 
constituents. I knew the senate district 
was in capable hands when she suc-
ceeded me, winning the seat in 2002. 
Her strong reputation as an effective 
leader in championing issues and get-
ting things done were immediately rec-
ognized by her colleagues who elected 
her chair of the senate’s Democratic 
caucus, making Gilda the first woman 
to serve as floor leader in either cham-
ber of Michigan’s Legislature. 
As a State-elected official, Gilda was 
a tireless advocate for the rights of 
women, children, and people with dis-
abilities. In the State legislature, she 
served as the vice chair of the eco-
nomic development, small business and 
regulatory reform committee, the fam-
ilies and human services committee, 
and government operations and health 
policy committees. Among her many 
successes were the establishment of a 
bipartisan bicameral talent caucus to 
develop strategies to encourage Michi-
gan entrepreneurship and discourage 
college graduate flight. 
In 2011, following the conclusion of 
her leadership and service in the Michi-
gan Senate, Gilda joined the Michigan 
League for Public Policy as president 
and CEO. At the Michigan League for 
Public Policy, Gilda focused on the 
promotion of racial equality, economic 
security, and the overall health and 
well-being of Michiganders. During her

tenure she helped the organization 
move major policy victories, including, 
among others, successfully defending 
the Michigan Earned Income Tax Cred-
it; raising the age at which Michigan’s 
juveniles can be tried as adults, and 
changing the asset test on food and 
cash assistance in the State, allowing 
more residents to be eligible for assist-
ance. As a result of her leadership and 
tireless devotion, the State of Michi-
gan has seen progress in policy for 
Michigan’s youth, women, and fami-
lies. 
During a time of great personal loss, 
Gilda—and her late husband John— 
worked on developing policy efforts to 
better ensure railroad safety after 
their daughter, Rachel, was tragically 
killed in the Philadelphia Amtrak 
crash of May 2015. Although confronted 
with unimaginable grief, they felt it 
essential to address the issue head on, 
advocating for enhanced safety meas-
ures so no other family would experi-
ence what they did during that horrific 
time. 
Gilda’s contributions go well beyond 
her professional endeavors. In addition 
to serving as a public representative 
and policy maker, she has been a life-
long volunteer for numerous causes 
and organizations, including the Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, 
the 
United 
Way 
for 
Southeastern 
Michigan and New Detroit, and the 
JARC—a 
Michigan-based 
nonprofit 
dedicated to enriching the lives of 
those with disabilities. She was further 
recognized as one of Crain’s Detroit 
Business 100 most influential women 
and awarded the Michigan Food Bank 
Council Hunger-Free Award in 2015. 
I cannot understate the impact that 
Gilda Jacobs has had on the people of 
Michigan. She has spearheaded initia-
tives to eliminate hunger and support 
Michigan’s families, promoted positive 
changes in our communities, and cre-
ated a model for public service that is 
unmatched. I ask all of my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing Gilda’s many 
years of work on behalf of others, and 
congratulating her on a well-earned re-
tirement from the Michigan League for 
Public Policy. Though her leadership 
there will be sorely missed, her legacy 
will most certainly endure.∑

To the Congress of the United States:

the Congress a notice stating that the

enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13664 of April 3, 2014, with respect 
to South Sudan is to continue in effect

The situation in and in relation to 
South Sudan, which has been marked 
by activities that threaten the peace, 
security, or stability of South Sudan 
and the surrounding region, including 
widespread 
violence 
and 
atrocities, 
human rights abuses, recruitment and 
use of child soldiers, attacks on peace-
keepers, and obstruction of humani-
tarian operations, continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign pol-

have determined that it is necessary to 
continue the national emergency de-
clared in Executive Order 13664 with re-
spect to South Sudan.

Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Ms.

lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 567 
Whereas since its founding more than a 
century ago, the social work profession has 
been dedicated to improving human well- 
being and enhancing the basic needs of all 
people, 
especially 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
among us; 
Whereas the theme of Social Work Month 
2022, ‘‘The Time is Right for Social Work’’, 
embodies how social workers have been an 
essential workforce in responding to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, even as the Nation con-
tinues to grapple with systemic racism, gen-
der-based 
violence, 
homophobia, 
transphobia, economic inequality, climate 
change, and other challenges; 
Whereas social workers are a large, ra-
cially and socioeconomically diverse mental 
and behavioral health workforce in the 
United States, and social workers provide 
culturally competent, evidence-based serv-
ices in the community in a broad range of 
settings, including healthcare, schools, com-
munity clinics, private practice, child wel-
fare agencies, and correctional facilities; 
Whereas social workers continue to advo-
cate for social justice and equal rights for 
all, especially for vulnerable, underserved, 
and marginalized people; 
Whereas social work is one of the fastest 
growing professions in the United States, 
with more than 700,000 social workers today 
and a projected increase to 800,000 by 2028; 
Whereas social workers are leaders in cre-
ating and implementing public policies that 
improve health and well-being, strengthen 
the social fabric, and ensure a more just so-
ciety. 
Whereas social workers serve in all levels 
of government, including Congress, where 
there are 5 social workers currently in office;

March 30, 2022 
Whereas social workers develop evidence- 
based interventions that address a number of 
the most vexing problems facing society, and 
social workers conduct cutting-edge research 
that informs both policy and practice; 
Whereas there is a need— 
(1) to ensure accuracy of workforce data 
surrounding the social work profession so 
that data projections adequately reflect the 
depth and breadth of social work practice 
across settings, as well as the needs of the 
clients and communities served by the pro-
fession; and 
(2) to make meaningful investments in the 
social work profession to address challenges 
associated with recruitment and retention in 
recognition of the pressing need for such pro-
fessionals and the crucial services they pro-
vide; and 
Whereas social workers meet individuals 
no matter where those individuals are in 
their life circumstances and empower those 
individuals to fulfill their potential: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Social 
Work Month and World Social Work Day on 
March 15, 2022; 
(2) acknowledges the diligent efforts of in-
dividuals and groups who promote the impor-
tance of social work and observe Social Work 
Month and World Social Work Day; 
(3) encourages individuals to engage in ap-
propriate ceremonies and activities to pro-
mote further awareness of the life-changing 
role that social workers play; and 
(4) recognizes with gratitude the contribu-
tions of the millions of social workers who 
have advanced individual, family, and com-
munity well-being since the founding of the 
social work profession more than a century

Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. CRAPO, 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. TUBERVILLE, 
Ms. ERNST, and Mr. CORNYN) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 568 
Whereas thousands of children have been 
abducted from the United States by parents, 
separating those children from their parents 
who remain in the United States; 
Whereas it is illegal under section 1204 of 
title 18, United States Code, to remove, or 
attempt to remove, a child from the United 
States or to retain a child (who has been in 
the United States) outside of the United 
States with the intent to obstruct the lawful 
exercise of parental rights; 
Whereas 9,816 children were reported ab-
ducted from the United States between 2010 
and 2020; 
Whereas, during 2020, 1 or more cases of 
international parental child abduction in-
volving children who are citizens of the 
United States were identified in 106 coun-
tries around the world; 
Whereas the United States is a party to the 
Convention on the Civil Aspects of Inter-
national Child Abduction, done at The 
Hague, October 25, 1980 (TIAS 11670) (referred 
to in this preamble as the ‘‘Hague Conven-
tion on Abduction’’), which— 
(1) supports the prompt return of wrongly 
removed or retained children; and 
(2) calls for all participating parties to re-
spect parental custody rights; 
Whereas the majority of children who were 
abducted from the United States have yet to 
be reunited with their custodial parents; 
Whereas, between 2015 and 2021, Argentina, 
the Bahamas, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa 
Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, 
Egypt, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Japan, 
Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Nicaragua, Peru, 
Romania, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, and 
the United Arab Emirates were identified 
under the Sean and David Goldman Inter-
national Child Abduction Prevention and Re-
turn Act of 2014 (22 U.S.C. 9101 et seq.) as en-
gaging in a pattern of noncompliance (as de-
fined in section 3 of such Act (22 U.S.C. 
9101)); 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United 
States has recognized that family abduc-
tion— 
(1) is a form of child abuse with potentially 
‘‘devastating consequences for a child’’, 
which may include negative impacts on the 
physical and mental well-being of the child; 
and 
(2) may cause a child to ‘‘experience a loss 
of community and stability, leading to lone-
liness, anger, and fear of abandonment’’; 
Whereas, according to the 2010 Report on 
Compliance with the Hague Convention on 
the Civil Aspects of International Child Ab-
duction by the Department of State, an ab-
ducted child is at risk of significant short- 
and long-term problems, including ‘‘anxiety, 
eating problems, nightmares, mood swings, 
sleep disturbances, [and] aggressive behav-
ior’’; 
Whereas international parental child ab-
duction has devastating emotional con-
sequences for the child and for the parent 
from whom the child is separated; 
Whereas the United States has a history of 
promoting child welfare through institutions 
including— 
(1) the Children’s Bureau of the Adminis-
tration for Children and Families of the De-
partment of Health and Human Services; and 
(2) the Office of Children’s Issues of the Bu-
reau of Consular Affairs of the Department 
of State; 
Whereas 
the 
Coalition 
to 
End 
Inter-
national Parental Child Abduction, through 
dedicated advocacy and regular testimony, 
has highlighted the importance of this issue 
to Congress and called on successive admin-
istrations to take concerted action to stop 
international parental child abduction and 
repatriate kidnapped United States children; 
Whereas Congress has signaled a commit-
ment to ending international parental child 
abduction by enacting—

19, 2018, to raise awareness of, and opposition 
to, international parental child abduction; 
Whereas the Senate adopted Senate Reso-
lution 23, 116th Congress, agreed to on April

International Child Abduction Prevention 
and Return Act of 2014 (22 U.S.C. 9101 et seq.) 
to negotiate, and make publicly available, 
bilateral agreements or memorandums of un-
derstanding— 
(1) with countries not parties to the Hague 
Convention on Abduction to resolve abduc-
tion and access cases; and 
(2) regarding open abduction and access 
cases predating the Hague Convention on Ab-
duction with countries that have thereafter 
become parties to the Hague Convention on 
Abduction; 
Whereas all 50 States and the District of 
Columbia have enacted laws criminalizing 
parental kidnapping; 
Whereas, in 2020, the Prevention Branch of 
the Office of Children’s Issues of the Depart-
ment of State— 
(1) fielded more than 4,200 inquiries from 
the general public relating to preventing a 
child from being removed from the United 
States; and 
(2) enrolled more than 3,000 children in the 
Children’s Passport Issuance Alert Program, 
which— 
(A) is one of the most important tools of 
the Department of State for preventing 
international parental child abduction; and 
(B) allows the Office of Children’s Issues 
to contact the enrolling parent or legal 
guardian to verify whether the parental 
consent requirement has been met when a 
passport application has been submitted 
for an enrolled child; 
Whereas the Department of State cannot 
track the ultimate destination of a child 
through the use of the passport issued by the 
Department of State if the child is trans-
ported to a third country after departing 
from the United States; 
Whereas a child who is a citizen of the 
United States may have another nationality 
and may travel using a passport issued by 
another country, which— 
(1) increases the difficulty of determining 
the whereabouts of the child; and 
(2) makes efforts to prevent abduction 
more critical; 
Whereas, during 2020, 185 children were re-
turned to the United States, and an addi-
tional 72 cases were resolved in other ways; 
and 
Whereas, in 2020, the Department of Home-
land Security, in coordination with the Pre-
vention Branch of the Office of Children’s 
Issues of the Department of State, enrolled 
200 children in the Prevent Abduction Pro-
gram, which is aimed at preventing inter-
national parental child abduction through 
coordination with the U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Patrol officers at the airport, seaport, or 
land border ports of entry by intercepting 
the child before departure: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes and observes ‘‘Countering 
International 
Parental 
Child 
Abduction 
Month’’ during the period beginning on April 
1, 2022, and ending on April 30, 2022, to raise 
awareness of, and opposition to, inter-
national parental child abduction; and 
(2) urges the United States to continue 
playing a leadership role in raising aware-
ness about the devastating impacts of inter-
national parental child abduction by edu-
cating the public about the negative emo-
tional, psychological, and physical con-
sequences to children and parents victimized 
by international parental child abduction.

S1870 
March 30, 2022 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
569—SUP-
PORTING THE GOALS OF WORLD 
TUBERCULOSIS DAY TO RAISE 
AWARENESS 
ABOUT 
TUBER-
CULOSIS 
Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. 
SULLIVAN) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations.: 
S. RES. 569 
Whereas, in 2020, nearly 1⁄4 of the global 
population was infected with the tuber-
culosis bacterium (referred to in this pre-
amble as ‘‘TB’’); 
Whereas the World Health Organization 
(referred to in this preamble as the ‘‘WHO’’) 
estimates that 9,900,000 people developed TB 
in 2020, 8 percent of whom were also infected 
with the human immunodeficiency virus (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘HIV’’); 
Whereas, in 2020, TB killed an estimated 
1,514,000 people, second only to coronavirus 
disease 2019 (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘COVID–19’’) as a leading cause of death 
from a single infectious agent; 
Whereas, globally in 2020, an estimated 
1,100,000 children developed TB, and in 2020, 
228,972 children died of TB; 
Whereas 2⁄3 of new TB infections in 2020 oc-
curred in 8 countries: India, Indonesia, 
China, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, 
Bangladesh, and South Africa; 
Whereas TB is a leading killer of people in-
fected with HIV, and 214,000 people with HIV 
died of TB in 2020; 
Whereas vulnerable populations also at 
high risk for developing TB include individ-
uals who are pregnant and newborns; 
Whereas, in 2020, TB was the 13th leading 
cause of death; 
Whereas, in some settings, women with TB 
can 
face 
stigma, 
discrimination, 
and 
ostracization by their families and commu-
nities; 
Whereas the global TB epidemic and the 
spread of drug-resistant TB present a per-
sistent public health threat to the United 
States because the disease does not recognize 
borders; 
Whereas antibiotic-resistant pathogens are 
a growing problem worldwide, and drug-re-
sistant TB can occur when the drugs used to 
treat TB are mismanaged or not made con-
sistently accessible; 
Whereas studies have demonstrated direct 
person-to-person transmission of drug-resist-
ant TB; 
Whereas multi-drug resistant TB (referred 
to in this preamble as ‘‘MDR–TB’’) is caused 
by bacteria with resistance to rifampin and 
isoniazid, the 2 most potent treatments for 
TB infection; 
Whereas, in 2020, according to the 2021 
WHO Global Tuberculosis Report, an esti-
mated 3 to 4 percent of all new TB cases and 
18 to 21 percent of previously treated cases 
were MDR–TB or rifampin-resistant TB; 
Whereas, in 2020, an estimated 297,000 peo-
ple around the world developed MDR–TB or 
rifampin-resistant TB, yet only approxi-
mately 1 in 3 of those individuals were iden-
tified and treated; 
Whereas extensively drug-resistant TB (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘XDR–TB’’) is 
a rare type of TB that is resistant to nearly 
all medicines, and therefore can be very dif-
ficult and expensive to treat, especially 
among patients with HIV; 
Whereas, in 2020, 25,681 cases of XDR–TB 
were reported; 
Whereas, in 2020, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘CDC’’) estimated that the aver-
age cost of treating a single patient with 
MDR–TB in the United States was $182,186, 
and the average cost of treating a patient 
with XDR–TB was even higher at $567,708, 
compared with $20,211 to treat a patient with 
drug-susceptible TB; 
Whereas, between 2005 and 2007, according 
to an analysis by the CDC, MDR–TB and 
XDR–TB cases in the United States collec-
tively cost the health care system an esti-
mated $53,000,000; 
Whereas the CDC estimates that costs re-
sulting from all forms of TB in the United 
States totaled more than $503,000,000 in 2020; 
Whereas, in a 2000 report, the Institute of 
Medicine found that a decrease in TB control 
funding and the spread of HIV and acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome (commonly re-
ferred to as ‘‘AIDS’’) caused a resurgence of 
TB in the late 1980s and early 1990s; 
Whereas a total of 7,174 TB cases were re-
ported in the United States in 2020, rep-
resenting all 50 States and the District of Co-
lumbia, and up to 13,000,000 people in the 
United States are estimated to be living with 
latent TB infection; 
Whereas the rate of TB disease in African 
Americans is 8.5 times higher than the rate 
of disease in White, non-Hispanic Americans, 
and significant disparities exist among other 
minorities in the United States, including 
Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, and 
Native Americans and Alaska Natives, with 
approximately 89 percent of all reported TB 
cases in the United States in 2020 occurring 
in racial or ethnic minorities; 
Whereas smoking— 
(1) greatly increases the risks of con-
tracting TB and infection recurrence; and 
(2) impairs therapeutic efficacy; 
Whereas diabetes is a major risk factor for 
TB, and people with diabetes are more likely 
to develop and succumb to TB; 
Whereas bedaquiline is an antibiotic that 
boosts the chance of survival for an MDR–TB 
patient from approximately 50 percent to as 
much as 80 percent, and through a public-pri-
vate partnership, the United States Agency 
for International Development (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘USAID’’) provided ap-
proximately 105,000 treatments in 110 eligible 
countries from 2015 through 2019; 
Whereas Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, a TB 
vaccine that is known as BCG, provides some 
protection to infants and young children 
against serious forms of childhood TB but 
has had little epidemiologic impact on con-
trolling TB worldwide; 
Whereas there is a critical need for new 
drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines for control-
ling the global TB epidemic; 
Whereas, in September 2018, the United Na-
tions held the first high-level meeting on TB 
at which 120 countries, including the United 
States, signed a political declaration com-
mitting to accelerating the TB response, in-
cluding by increasing funding for TB control 
programs and research and development ef-
forts, with the goal of reaching all affected 
people with TB prevention and care; 
Whereas the enactment of the Tom Lantos 
and Henry J. Hyde United States Global 
Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, 
and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 
(Public Law 110–293; 122 Stat. 2918) and the 
Comprehensive 
Tuberculosis 
Elimination 
Act of 2008 (Public Law 110–392; 122 Stat. 4195) 
led to a historic United States commitment 
to support the global eradication of TB, in-
cluding a commitment to treat 4,500,000 TB 
patients and 90,000 MDR–TB patients be-
tween 2009 and 2013 and to provide additional 
treatment through coordinated multilateral 
efforts; 
Whereas USAID— 
(1) provides technical assistance to 55 
countries and implements bilateral programs 
in 23 high-burden TB countries that— 
(A) build capacity; and 
(B) support the adoption of state-of-the- 
art TB-related technologies; 
(2) supports the development of new diag-
nostic and treatment tools; and 
(3) supports research to develop new vac-
cines and other new methods to combat TB; 
Whereas, in 2018, USAID launched— 
(1) a new business model entitled ‘‘Global 
Accelerator to End Tuberculosis’’ to accel-
erate progress and build capacity with re-
spect to TB prevention and treatment; and 
(2) a new mechanism to directly support 
local organizations in priority countries; 
Whereas TB incidence in the countries that 
receive bilateral TB funding from the United 
States through USAID has decreased by 
more than 29 percent since 2000; 
Whereas, according to the Copenhagen 
Consensus Center, TB prevention programs 
return $56 for each dollar invested, which is 
one of the highest returns on investment of 
any health intervention; 
Whereas the CDC, in partnership with 
other entities of the United States and indi-
vidual States and territories— 
(1) directs the national TB elimination pro-
gram; 
(2) coordinates TB surveillance, technical 
assistance, and prevention activities; and 
(3) helps to support the development of new 
diagnostic, treatment, and prevention tools 
to combat TB; 
Whereas the National Institutes of Health, 
through its many institutes and centers, 
plays the leading role in basic and clinical 
research on the identification, treatment, 
and prevention of TB; 
Whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘Global Fund’’), to which 
the United States is a top financial donor, 
provides more than 77 percent of all inter-
national financing for TB programs; 
Whereas, in 2020, programs supported by 
the Global Fund detected and treated more 
than 4,700,000 cases of TB; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic and miti-
gation efforts put in place as a result of the 
pandemic have taken a devastating toll on 
countries with the highest burden of TB dis-
ease and on the global TB response, threat-
ening to reverse up to 8 years of progress 
fighting the disease; 
Whereas, in 2020, in the 23 high-burden TB 
countries in which USAID implements bilat-
eral programs, 1,000,000 fewer people with TB 
had access to diagnosis and treatment, a 23 
percent decline from 2019; 
Whereas, between 2020 and 2025, global pro-
jections estimate that the impact of the 
COVID–19 pandemic will lead to an addi-
tional 6,300,000 cases of TB and an additional 
1,400,000 TB deaths; and 
Whereas March 24, 2022, is World Tuber-
culosis Day, a day that commemorates the 
date in 1882 on which Dr. Robert Koch an-
nounced his discovery of mycobacterium tu-
berculosis, the bacterium that causes TB: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of World Tuber-
culosis Day to raise awareness about tuber-
culosis; 
(2) commends the progress of tuberculosis 
elimination efforts by entities that include 
the United States Agency for International 
Development, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, the National Institutes 
of Health, the World Health Organization, 
and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuber-
culosis and Malaria; and 
(3) reaffirms the commitment to strength-
en the leadership role of the United States 
in, and the effectiveness of the global re-
sponse to, the fight to end the tuberculosis 
epidemic.

March 30, 2022 
SENATE RESOLUTION 570—DESIG-
NATING 
APRIL 
2022 
AS 
‘‘NA-
TIONAL NATIVE PLANT MONTH’’ 
Mr. PORTMAN (for himself and Ms. 
HIRONO) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to.: 
S. RES. 570 
Whereas there are more than 17,000 native 
plant species in the United States, which in-
clude trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, and 
wildflowers; 
Whereas native plants help prevent flood-
ing, drought, and erosion and can help re-
store damaged ecosystems; 
Whereas native plants provide shelter as 
well as nectar, pollen, and seeds that serve 
as food for native butterflies, insects, birds, 
and other wildlife in ways that non-native 
plants cannot; 
Whereas more than 200 of the native plant 
species in the United States are estimated to 
have been lost since the early 19th century; 
Whereas habitat loss and degradation, ex-
treme weather events, and invasive species 
have contributed to the decline of native 
plants in the United States; and 
Whereas native plants are essential compo-
nents of resilient ecosystems and our natural 
heritage: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates April 2022 as ‘‘National Na-
tive Plant Month’’; and 
(2) recognizes the benefits of native plants 
to the environment and economy of the 
United States.

RESOLUTION 
571—SUP-
PORTING 
THE 
GOALS 
AND 
IDEALS OF DEEP VEIN THROM-
BOSIS AND PULMONARY EMBO-
LISM AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. 
LUJA´ N) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 571 
Whereas deep vein thrombosis (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘DVT’’) is a condition 
that occurs when a blood clot forms in the 
deep veins of the body, such as in the arm, 
abdomen, around the brain, and most com-
monly in the leg; 
Whereas 
a 
potentially 
life-threatening 
complication of DVT is pulmonary embolism 
(referred to in this preamble as ‘‘PE’’), where 
a blood clot breaks off, travels through the 
blood stream, and lodges in the lung; 
Whereas DVT and PE are serious but often 
preventable medical conditions; 
Whereas DVT and PE affect as many as 
900,000 individuals in the United States each 
year; 
Whereas DVT and PE kill an estimated 
60,000 to 100,000 individuals in the United 
States each year, and 1 out of 4 individuals 
who have a PE die without warning; 
Whereas DVT and PE deaths are often pre-
ventable; 
Whereas DVT and PE are the leading 
causes of preventable hospital death in the 
United States; 
Whereas DVT and PE are a common com-
plication faced by cancer patients, and sur-
vival rates are lower for individuals with 
cancer who also have blood clots; 
Whereas pregnancy increases the risk of 
DVT and PE, and that risk remains elevated 
for up to 3 months after giving birth; 
Whereas immobility, surgery, older age, 
and 
a 
family 
history 
of 
clotting 
and 
thrombophilia increase the risk of DVT and 
PE; 
Whereas DVT and PE contributes to up to 
$10,000,000,000 in incremental medical costs 
each year in the United States; and 
Whereas the establishment of March as 
Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Em-
bolism Awareness Month would raise aware-
ness about this life-threatening but prevent-
able condition: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Deep 
Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism 
Awareness Month; and 
(2) recognizes the importance of raising 
awareness of deep vein thrombosis and pul-
monary embolism.

CELEBRATING THE SERVICE OF 
BILL CLERK PEGGY FIELDS 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the outstanding service of the Bill Clerk 
of the United States House of Representa-
tives, Peggy Fields. For more than three dec-
ades, Peggy has devoted her career to the 
people’s work here in the People’s House. In 
doing so, she has earned the respect of Mem-
bers and staff on both sides of the aisle and 
ensured the Congress could deliver for the 
Country. 
A daughter of Huntsville, Alabama, Peggy 
began her career in public service by joining 
the office of former Congressman Bud Cramer 
when he was the District Attorney of Madison 
County, Alabama. After Congressman Cramer 
was elected to the House in 1990, she came 
with him to Washington so that she could con-
tinue to serve her beloved hometown commu-
nity. For eighteen years, she was an integral 
member of his team as Grants and Special 
Projects Coordinator, an essential link be-
tween the Congress and her constituents. 
In 2008, Peggy brought her talents, relent-
less work ethic and dedication to public serv-
ice to the Office of the Clerk of the House. As 
an Assistant Bill Clerk, she helped process the 
many bills, amendments and cosponsor forms 
filed in the House: essential work to keep 
Congress functioning. Peggy embodies the ex-
traordinary meticulousness, teamwork and 
professionalism that this essential responsi-
bility demands. Her excellence was on full dis-
play during her exemplary performance as Bill 
Clerk on duty during the opening day of the 
114th Congress, when she managed the intro-
duction of 161 bills with remarkable diligence 
and efficiency. 
In July 2021, Peggy’s hard work and valu-
able contributions were recognized when she 
was promoted to serve as Bill Clerk of the 
House. In this role, she has demonstrated out-
standing leadership of her team: bringing en-
ergy, camaraderie and humor to the long 
hours and late nights to ensure the business 
of the House could get done. Her mastery of 
the mechanics of the legislative process, ex-
tensive institutional knowledge and refusal to 
shy away from a challenge were especially 
valuable last year—helping facilitate an histori-
cally productive legislative session despite the 
many challenges posed by the lingering pan-
demic. 
Peggy’s work has been central to the health 
of our Democracy and to the benefit of our 
Country: ensuring that the business of legis-
lating is both efficient and accessible for the 
American people. She takes immense pride in 
always placing the duties of her office above 
all else, never allowing partisanship or politics 
to infiltrate the sacred trust bestowed upon the 
Office of the Clerk. 
While she will be missed, Congress and the 
Country are grateful to Peggy Fields for her 
longtime and patriotic service. When she re-
turns to her beloved Huntsville after she grad-
uates with her Doctorate of Ministry from Wes-
ley Theological Seminary this May, she will 
continue her leadership by helping local 
churches serve their congregations and their 
communities. On behalf of the House, we wish 
her all the best as she prepares for a deeply 
deserved retirement.

WOMEN OF THE REPRODUCTIVE 
RIGHTS MOVEMENT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 29, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, Homeland Security, and the Budget, it is 
my pleasure to join Congresswoman LIZZIE 
FLETCHER and the Pro-Choice Caucus for this 
Special Order with my colleagues, to com-
memorate the women who have been promi-
nent figures in achieving reproductive rights. 
One of my greatest joys as a member of 
Congress is the opportunity to work on behalf 
of women to ensure that every voice is heard 
when discussing equality and women’s rights. 
I was inspired by many of the women who 
led the movement for women’s equality and 
reproductive rights. When I was a young 
woman, their passion and purpose were in-
stilled within me, and their indomitable spirit 
continues to light the way. 
Before I share a few thoughts about two of 
the women who led the movement and were 
role models for me, I must emphasize how 
vital their lessons and their work continue to 
be. 
This is a critical time to discuss women’s re-
productive rights because they are under at-
tack in many states. Women in my home state 
of Texas have been stripped of their reproduc-
tive rights due to the revolting abortion ban 
that was enacted last September. 
Restrictions on abortion disproportionately 
harm low-income women and women of color. 
Low-income individuals and people of color 
face a range of worse health outcomes than 
higher income individuals and white people. 
These worse outcomes are the result of 
higher barriers to accessing quality health 
care, higher rates of stress, poorer living and 
working conditions, and, for people of color, 
racial discrimination. 
People of color and low-income individuals 
experience the highest rates of unintended 
pregnancy, partially because of barriers to ac-
cessing quality family planning services and 
contraception, lack of insurance coverage, 
and, for racial minorities, discrimination in 
health care. 
Because of this, low-income people and 
people of color have higher rates of abortion, 
as abortion rates mirror rates of unintended 
pregnancy. 
But the erosion of our rights in Texas and 
elsewhere makes clear how important the 
movement was in the 1970s. We owe a great 
debt to the women who paved the way for the 
reproductive rights that many women in this 
country enjoy today. 
Shirley Anita Chisholm was a trailblazer 
throughout her career. In 1968, Shirley Chis-
holm ran for Congress in New York’s 12th dis-
trict. With her victory, she became the first Af-
rican American woman ever elected to the 
United States House of Representatives. 
Congresswoman Chisholm was a pioneer in 
the fight for reproductive rights. In a one- 
minute speech to the House, Congresswoman 
Chisholm explained that ‘‘by forcing a young 
girl to have an unwanted child, we are assign-
ing her to society’s trash heap. She will be cut 
off from avenues of opportunity.’’ 
In her 1970 book Unbought and Unbossed, 
Chisholm argued that ‘‘access to legal abor-
tion was an issue of economic and racial in-
justice, as poor African-American and Hispanic 
women were the most likely to be victims of 
unsafe ‘‘back alley’’ abortions while wealthy 
white women were much more likely to re-
ceive abortions from licensed doctors, even 
when the procedure was still illegal.’’ 
Her efforts and advocacy led her to be 
named the honorary co-president of the Na-
tional Association for the Repeal of Abortion 
Laws in 1969. Chisholm also co-founded the 
National Organization for Women, an organi-
zation that I hold dear to my heart. 
I believe all women must be recognized for 
their achievements, but today I would like to 
pay special tribute to the strength and resil-
ience of my hero and mentor, Barbara Jordan. 
She was resolute and fearless in her pursuit 
of justice and equality. 
Barbara Jordan was a prominent public fig-
ure, civil rights advocate, woman’s rights ad-
vocate, and leading presence in Democratic 
Party politics for four decades. 
Barbara Jordan was a ground-breaking ‘‘na-
tional icon’’: the first African American woman 
elected to the Texas Senate (1966); the first 
woman to represent Texas in the U.S. Con-
gress (1972); and the first African American 
woman to deliver the keynote address at a 
Democratic National Convention (1976). 
I was very fortunate to have known Con-
gresswoman Jordan, and I had the honor and 
pleasure of thanking her for laying a path for 
me to follow when I decided to seek a career 
in public service. 
Barbara Jordan grew up in Houston’s Fifth 
Ward, graduated from Wheatley High School, 
and attended Texas Southern University.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E320 
March 30, 2022 
Through the grace of God, a personal com-
mitment to excellence, and hard work, she be-
came someone who we all take pride in call-
ing a Houstonian, and who is beloved nation-
wide. 
Congresswoman Jordan’s nonstop advo-
cacy for women’s rights and equality helped 
propagate the idea that women deserve to be 
given equal rights to men, and that women 
need to stand up to the male-dominated world, 
and assert our own leadership. 
In a speech titled A Fundamental Right, by 
Congresswoman Jordan at the Planned Par-
enthood Federation of America’s conference in 
1990, she exclaimed that a ‘‘fundamental right 
must not be subjected to a callous calculation 
of political winners and losers.’’ 
She explained that many politicians were 
deliberately politicizing the debate about the 
fundamental right to privacy and reproductive 
health. 
We still need leaders like Barbara Jordan 
and Shirley Chisholm to stand up and fight on 
behalf of women for reproductive rights and 
the full range of reforms that would create 
gender equity. It is because of women like 
them that we have made it this far, but the 
fight is not over yet. 
The politicization surrounding abortion con-
tinues today and has led to new extremes that 
have eroded the progress that has been made 
up to now. 
Just this year, Oklahoma, Idaho, and South 
Carolina have effectively banned the proce-
dure, putting thousands of women’s lives at 
risk. 
It is a central part of our job as Members of 
Congress to advocate and fight for women. I 
am so honored and proud to be here today 
surrounded by so many outstanding and dedi-
cated women who are dedicated to this cause. 
I will continue to fight for reproductive rights 
for all women and gender equity for women 
everywhere.

RECOGNIZING MAJOR GENERAL 
BRAD OWENS 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to recognize Major Gen-
eral Brad Owens for his more than 37 years 
of distinguished service to the United States 
Army and South Carolina Army National 
Guard (SCARNG). 
Major General Owens served as the Assist-
ant Adjutant General for Joint Force Head-
quarters, South Carolina where he worked to 
increase the readiness and capabilities of our 
military. Major General Owens was the driving 
force behind the modernization of SCARNG 
facilities by partnering with academic institu-
tions such as The Citadel, USC-Upstate, and 
Greenville Tech. His tremendous efforts have 
also set the conditions for an Aiken Readiness 
Center located on campus of the University of 
South Carolina-Aiken. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic struck, 
Major General Owens served as the des-
ignated Dual-Status Commander for Defense 
Support of Civil Authorities where he led the 
effort to establish a Unified Command Group 
with multiple State Agencies that successfully 
responded to the needs of South Carolina. His 
service to the community and the guard will 
have an everlasting, positive effect far into the 
future. 
His tireless work has led to strong relation-
ships with combatant commands worldwide 
that increased the SCARNG support to over 
sixteen different countries. More notably, 
Major General Owens was instrumental in the 
SCARNG’s fruitful partnership with Colombia, 
which resulted in his receiving of two decora-
tions, the Faith in the Cause and the Torre de 
Castilla medal. His outstanding career is fur-
ther highlighted with his many decorations and 
badges such as Combat Action Badge, the 
Parachutist Badge, the Air Assault Badge, the 
Salvage Diver Badge, the Sapper identification 
tab, the Bronze Star Medal, six Meritorious 
Service Medals, seven Army Commendation 
Medals, and the Engineer Regiment’s Silver 
de Fleury. 
Major General Owens is known throughout 
the Aiken community and the state for his 
steady leadership and integrity. His notable 
service to both his country and community has 
made him beloved by those who worked with 
him and know him. We cannot thank him 
enough for his many decades of service to 
both his country and community.

RECOGNIZING 
JAMES 
SOLOMON 
RUSSELL DAY IN THE COMMON-
WEALTH OF VIRGINIA 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to celebrate James 
Solomon Russell Day in the Commonwealth of 
Virginia. 
James Solomon Russell was an enormously 
important figure in the history of southern Vir-
ginia. He was born into slavery in 1857 and 
began his career as a teacher in 1874. By 
1879, he began transitioning to ministry, build-
ing his first church and being ordained a dea-
con in 1882. His work included building new 
schools and senior housing in addition to in-
creasing the number of African-American 
churches in his diocese from none to thirty- 
seven. Perhaps his most well-known accom-
plishment is his founding in 1888 and subse-
quent leadership of Saint Paul’s College. As a 
result of his work, thousands of young African 
Americans obtained a higher education de-
gree. Particularly important among the alumni 
of Saint Paul’s College are the many teachers 
who went on to educate young people across 
the Commonwealth. 
James Solomon Russell Day in the Com-
monwealth was first established on March 28, 
2020 through a bill in the Virginia State Legis-
lative Session. By introducing this bill, Dele-
gate Roslyn Tyler and Senator Louise Lucas 
ensured that James Solomon Russell Day is 
celebrated on March 28th in the Common-
wealth for years to come. Through this annual 
recognition, we will keep his memory alive and 
celebrate his work to better our Common-
wealth. 
This year, I want to particularly commend 
the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum 
of African American History and Culture Rob-
ert F. Smith Center for the Digitization and 
Curation of African American History for their 
work with the James Solomon Russell—Saint 
Paul’s College Museum and Archives. Rep-
resentatives from the Center have already 
travelled to Lawrenceville twice to lend their 
expertise on archiving and digitizing the muse-
um’s collection and are planning another trip 
this spring. With the experience of the Center, 
financial support from the state and federal 
government, and the passion of the staff at 
the museum, residents of southern Virginia will 
be able to access and learn from the history 
of James Solomon Russell and Saint Paul’s 
College.

IN MEMORY OF JOHN HOLLOWAY 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
honor the memory of John Holloway, long-time 
resident and the City of Highland Park, Michi-
gan’s first African-American police officer. 
Born in 1932 in Camp Hill, Alabama, John 
Holloway spent his formative years in the 
south. He later moved to Michigan at the invi-
tation of his family, where he attended High-
land Park Junior College. In November of 
1953, he was drafted into the United States 
Army. After leaving the Army in 1955, John re-
turned to Highland Park and was employed by 
the United States Postal Service. In 1961, he 
enlisted in the Air Force Reserves, stationed 
at Selfridge Air Force Base. He was honorably 
discharged in June of 1965. 
In 1956, John Holloway was hired as a pa-
trolman with the Highland Park Police Depart-
ment as the first African American officer in 
the city’s history. During his thirty-eight-year 
tenure, Officer Holloway faced many obsta-
cles, including blatant racism. He was one of 
the few officers who earned each rank by 
passing the civil service exams required for 
promotion, rising through the ranks as patrol-
man, corporal, detective, sergeant, lieutenant, 
and captain. In 1979, John was appointed as 
the city’s first African American Chief of Police 
by Mayor Jesse Miller. He continued to serve 
until he retired from the department in 1994, 
holding the rank of Executive Captain. 
John Holloway was an active member of the 
Highland Park community. Outside of his pub-
lic service as a police officer, he served on 
many civic organizations including as the first 
African American president of the Highland 
Park Goodfellows, the Highland Park Board of 
Education and the Highland Park Community 
College Board of Trustees for over 30 years. 
He was an active member of the Highland 
Park Lions Club and the Association of Re-
tired Highland Park Police and Firemen, where 
he served as president until his death. John 
Holloway loved spending time with his family 
and traveling. He was especially proud of 
earning his bachelor’s degree from Mercy Col-
lege of Detroit at the age of 44. 
Please join me in in recognizing his many 
contributions to Michigan 13th District Strong 
as we mourn his loss.

CONGRATULATING ILLINOIS BAS-
KETBALL COACHES ASSOCIATION 
COACH 
OF 
THE 
YEAR 
CALEB 
BATSON 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Caleb Batson, the seventh and 
eighth 
grade 
girls’ 
basketball 
coach 
at 
Abingdon-Avon Middle School, who was 
named a Coach of the Year by the Illinois 
Basketball Coaches Association. 
The 2021–2022 season was Caleb’s second 
as a coach at Abingdon-Avon Middle School. 
Both the seventh and eighth grade teams 
went 19–3 overall, with the 7th grade team 
winning the Class 3A sectional championship, 
and the 8th grade team winning the Class 3A 
regional title. Caleb is no stranger to devel-
oping young talent. In 2016 Caleb joined Mon-
mouth College’s men’s basketball coaching 
staff, where, in 2018, he helped the Fighting 
Scots win the Midwest Conference regular 
season championship and the Midwest Con-
ference tournament, giving Monmouth its first 
NCAA Division III Tournament berth since 
1990. As a former athlete, I commend Caleb 
for his determination and hard work. Caleb 
has shown us all the importance of dedication 
and a strong work ethic. I am proud to see 
him represent our community so well through-
out the state and the country with his talent 
and passion. 
It is because of leaders such as Caleb that 
I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th 
Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally congratulate Caleb 
Batson on being named a Coach of the Year 
by the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association.

HONORING DIANE PORTER COOLEY 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the vibrant life of Diane Porter 
Cooley, a pillar of the Pajaro Valley and Santa 
Cruz County community, who passed away on 
March 10, 2022. 
Born to a family that settled in Santa Cruz 
County in the 1850s, and raised on Las 
Lomas Ranch in Watsonville, Diane had a 
deep connection to the land and people of the 
central coast of California. Her father Tom was 
one of the four founders of Driscoll Berries, 
and Diane continued her involvement with ag-
riculture until her death. Diane and her hus-
band, Don, were active members of the com-
munity, constantly engaged in the issues they 
cared about. 
A deeply passionate civic leader, Diane 
worked tirelessly to protect and preserve the 
environment, and was an outspoken advocate 
for the people of the Pajaro Valley. She once 
said, ‘‘I care for the trees but for humans, too. 
People should have the chance to thrive just 
like the Sequoia should stand tall.’’ 
She was a dynamic agent of change who 
championed the creation of the Elkhorn 
Slough Foundation, the Pajaro Valley Arts 
Council, the Community Foundation of Santa 
Cruz County, and the Land Trust of Santa 
Cruz County. She was involved with the Na-
ture Conservancy, served on the Pajaro Valley 
Water Management Agency board, and was a 
supporter of many other causes, including 
Pajaro Valley Shelter Services, Salud Para la 
Genre, the University of California, Santa 
Cruz, Cabrillo College, and Second Harvest 
Food Bank in Watsonville. We may never 
know just how many lives she touched, or how 
many people received an education, braces, 
medical care, a home, or love when they 
needed it most thanks to her. 
Madam Speaker, Diane Porter Cooley’s out-
reach and philanthropy extended far and wide 
throughout our community. As Santa Cruz 
County bids farewell to its beloved daughter of 
95 years, may her legacy of giving continue to 
inspire us for generations to come.

HONORING AIDAN SAMUEL 
HAMILTON 
HON. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Aidan Samuel Hamilton for earning the rank of 
Eagle Scout in Troop 89 of Brandon, FL. 
Only four percent of Boy Scouts reach the 
highest honor of Eagle Scout. This special 
recognition requires years of effort to develop 
leadership, outdoor, and service skills. To earn 
it, Aidan led his Troop to construct a large 
landscape planter at a local high school. Aidan 
has also volunteered at a local ministry to feed 
the homeless in the Tampa area and worked 
to raise funds for ZooTampa at Lowry Park. 
Friends and fellow Scouts have described 
Aidan as a hard-working and dedicated mem-
ber of his local community. On behalf of the 
Fifteenth Congressional District of Florida, 
congratulations again to Aidan Samuel Ham-
ilton on earning the rank of Eagle Scout. We 
are proud of his continued success and appre-
ciate his dedication to making our community 
a better place.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
CELESTE ‘‘CLETE’’ BOYKIN 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Celeste ‘‘Clete’’ Boykin for her 
outstanding service to our state. 
A native of Lancaster, Clete has selflessly 
served the state of South Carolina and 
Clemson University for decades. Throughout 
her time as an undergraduate student, she 
proudly played in the Tiger Band and grad-
uated from Clemson University with a degree 
in horticulture in 1979. Since then, she has 
dedicated much of her life to Clemson Univer-
sity and its students. She currently serves on 
the Clemson Regional Board of Directors for 
the Baltimore/DC Clemson Club to ensure the 
Club is one of the best in the nation. Clete 
also serves as the Chairperson of the Board 
of Advisors for the Clemson Institute for Parks, 
which provides research, education, training, 
and outreach to enhance parks and protected 
areas. 
In addition to her involvement with Clemson 
University, Clete has educated the South 
Carolina Delegation on numerous federal 
issues, including cybersecurity, trade, agri-
culture, industry, and transportation. Clete is a 
respected, dependable, and humble commu-
nity leader. She has exceeded expectations in 
service to our nation, highlighted by her re-
ceipt of numerous honors and accolades. In 
2014, Clete received the Lifetime Achievement 
Award at the Tin Cup Awards for her work in 
the Washington Government Relations Group 
(WGRG), one of the nation’s oldest volunteer 
organizations for Black government employ-
ees. 
More 
recently, 
Clete 
received 
the 
Clemson Alumni Association’s Distinguished 
Service Award, the highest honor the Associa-
tion can bestow upon an alumnus or alumna. 
The Distinguished Service Award is given to 
alumni who have not only dedicated their life 
to professionalism and public service, but who 
have also continued a lifelong dedication to 
Clemson University. 
On behalf of the 5th District of South Caro-
lina, it is my most sincere pleasure to recog-
nize Clete for her outstanding leadership and 
public service. I wish her the best of luck 
throughout her future endeavors, as I am con-
fident she will continue to serve and find great 
success in all that she does.

CONGRATULATING HEDY 
WEINBERG 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Hedy Weinberg, who is retiring 
in June as the executive director of the Amer-
ican Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee after 
38 years advancing and protecting civil rights. 
Ms. Weinberg, a native of Chicago, has been 
at the forefront of legal battles to protect the 
rights of LGBT people, prison inmates, immi-
grants and those seeking access to legal 
abortions. She has stood up for voting rights 
and religious freedom, while challenging laws 
restricting the teaching of evolution. She has 
worked to end racial profiling by law enforce-
ment. Ms. Weinberg’s tenure at the ACLU has 
run concurrent with my service in the state 
Senate and in Congress. It has always been 
gratifying and comforting to know that the 
ACLU and Hedy were there supporting the 
issues that needed support to protect our Con-
stitution and our fundamental rights. Ms. 
Weinberg has been recognized for her advo-
cacy work and is the recipient of the Human 
Relations Award from the National Conference 
on Community and Justice—Nashville Chap-
ter; the Tennessee Library Association’s Free-

CELEBRATING 
THE 
ACHIEVE-
MENTS 
OF 
MAYOR 
BOBBIE 
SINGH-ALLEN 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
during Women’s History Month to recognize 
the contributions and achievements of Mayor 
Bobbie Singh-Allen of Elk Grove, California. 
Mayor Singh-Allen has been a great friend 
and partner in public service for years, when 
we began working together when she joined 
the Elk Grove School Board. She has been an 
exemplary citizen of Elk Grove, a city I have 
had the honor of representing throughout my 
time in Congress. She has lived in Elk Grove 
for over 30 years and been a strong leader in 
strengthening our public schools. 
She was appointed to the Elk Grove Unified 
School District Board of Trustees in 2012 and 
went on to serve as Board President for 2 
years. Her work involved maintaining strong fi-
nancial reserves, supporting robust career and 
technical education programs, increasing grad-
uation rates, creating a more inclusive cur-
riculum, and enhancing visual and performing 
arts, 
Mayor Singh-Allen is also an accomplished 
attorney, a graduate of Lincoln Law School of 
Sacramento, and represented the private sec-
tor for over twenty years. She has worked with 
associations representing the hospitality indus-
try, special educators, and affordable housing 
issues. 
Her election made her the first directly-elect-
ed Sikh-American woman mayor in the coun-
try, Mayor Singh-Allen is not only a dedicated 
servant of Elk Grove and Sacramento County, 
but she is also a wonderful wife and mother. 
In 2015, she was selected as ‘‘Woman of the 
Year’’ for California State Assembly District 9 
and was recognized for her achievements in 
front of the California State Legislature. I am 
honored to call her a friend and ask that my 
colleagues join me in recognizing her today in 
front of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
GERARD ‘‘GERRY’’ M. THIERS 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the retirement of Gerard 
‘‘Gerry’’ M. Thiers, a non-profit leader and 
champion for private special education in New 
Jersey for over three decades. 
Gerry has dedicated his life and career to 
champion policies that benefit children in New 
Jersey. He began his career researching for 
the United Way in Philadelphia while also rep-
resenting Catholic Charities agencies for the 
New Jersey Catholic Conference and assisting 
with the management of a large social serv-
ices agency. After developing a robust advo-
cacy background, Gerry proudly served as the 
Executive Director of the Association of 
Schools and Agencies for the Handicapped 
(ASAH) for 38 years. Under his leadership, 
ASAH’s membership increased from 25 to 95 
schools at more than 140 locations across our 
state. Through his work, he not only supported 
thousands 
of 
educational 
professionals 
through development conferences and pro-
gramming opportunities, but also ensured that 
children in New Jersey had the resources they 
needed in quality education to reach their full-
est potential. 
Gerry led a successful effort to implement a 
new funding system for private special edu-
cation schools. With more than 232,500 stu-
dents receiving special education instruction in 
the state during the year 2020, this has bene-
fited New Jersey’s special needs students’ ac-
cessibility to a meaningful, accommodating 
education. He also helped start ‘‘Special Edu-
cation Week’’ in New Jersey, which com-
mends school board members, educators, and 
parents for their dedication to ensuring quality 
education for students with disabilities and 
most importantly, to recognize the hard work 
of the students themselves. 
In addition to his work with ASAH, Gerry 
also served as Chairperson of the New York 
Society of Association Executives, Chair of the 
Advocates for Children of New Jersey in New-
ark, and was a Board member for the National 
Association of Private Special Education Cen-
ters in Washington, D.C. Through these nu-
merous volunteer roles, Gerry earned respect 
and a prominent reputation as a non-profit 
leader on both state and national levels. 
I know I speak for the 3rd District in wishing 
Gerry a happy retirement filled with days of 
doing what he loves—biking, golfing and read-
ing. He can retire knowing that his life’s work 
will not go unnoticed by our community, filled 
with the students, teachers, and parents of 
those impacted by a disability. It is because of 
Gerry that New Jersey can continue to pride 
itself on providing one of the highest quality 
educations through destigmatizing best prac-
tices that continue normalizing special edu-
cation programs students deserve. New Jer-
sey is grateful for the work that he has done, 
and I hope that he can inspire others to carry 
on his legacy as a champion for special edu-
cation students across the country. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND PATRI-
OTIC SERVICE OF THOMAS E. 
COPPINGER 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and commemorate the life and serv-
ice of Thomas Edwin Coppinger. Thomas hon-
orably served in the United States Marine 
Corps during the Second World War and the 
United States Army during the Korean War. 
Today, he is survived by his brother Don 
Coppinger, his sisters Sandra Tate and Shar-
on Reilly, and many more nieces, nephews, 
and cousins. All of whom carry on the memory 
of this great American hero. 
Thomas was born on March 22, 1922, in 
Greenville, TX to Thomas ‘Tom’ Richard and 
Eula Belle Coppinger. He attended high 
school in Greenville and worked on his grand-
parents’ farm and as a delivery man. Ulti-
mately, in April of 1941 at the young age of 
nineteen, Thomas decided to enlist in the Ma-
rine Corps to serve his country in the Second 
World War. He saw combat during his mis-
sions in the Pacific theatre from early 1942 to 
1944. Moreover, he served in Samoa, Hawaii, 
and the Gilbert Islands and was honorably dis-
charged in December 1945. After returning 
home to Texas, Thomas again heeded the call 
for duty and reenlisted into the United States 
Army in 1948, where he valiantly served in the 
Second Armored Division to defend our Nation 
and allies. On September 1, 1950, Thomas 
tragically lost his life on a combat mission in 
Korea, and he posthumously received the Pur-
ple Heart for his service and bravery. 
On July 27, 1951, Thomas Edwin Coppinger 
was laid to rest with full military honors in 
Wieland Cemetery, Greenville, TX. At the time 
of his death, Thomas was survived by his par-
ents and 12 siblings. On March 22, 2022, we 
celebrate what would have been Thomas’ 
100th Birthday. I pray that the memory of this 
patriot will live on for yet another hundred 
years and beyond. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capital to recognize 
Thomas Coppinger’s patriotism and devotion 
to God, Family, and Country. Furthermore, 
Madam Speaker, I extend my personal condo-
lences to the Coppinger family for the loss of 
such an extraordinary man of service and 
duty. May God rest the soul of this great 
American.

March 30, 2022 
Clete Boykin, is a native of Manning, in 
South Carolina’s 6th Congressional District. 
She is a member of the distinguished De 
Laine family, who initiated the activities in 
Clarendon County, South Carolina that led to 
the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Su-
preme Court case that desegregated public 
schools. She continues to uphold that legacy 
with her work today. 
Clete grew up in Lancaster, South Carolina, 
and graduated summa cum laude from Lan-
caster High School. She matriculated at 
Clemson University, which shaped the future 
trajectory of her life. Clete lived on the fourth 
floor of Benet Hall, and made lifelong friends 
known as the ‘‘Benet Babes,’’ who won the 
1978 
Women’s 
Intramural 
Flag 
Football 
Championship. She still sees the group every 
summer, and, in 2015, the Benet Babes es-
tablished a scholarship fund to give deserving 
students the opportunity to attend Clemson. 
At Clemson, Clete distinguished herself as 
one of the first African American members of 
the Tiger Band, and still proudly wears her 
Tiger Band jacket in cold Washington winters. 
She graduated from Clemson with honors and 
received a Bachelor of Science degree in 
plant sciences. 
Clete continued to break ground by joining 
E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company as the 
first African American woman to work as a 
sales and marketing representative in the 
company’s Agricultural Chemicals business. 
Clete rose to manage du Pont’s $ 1.5 million 
plant nursery business in Florida. The com-
pany then tapped her to join the company’s 
government affairs office in Washington, D.C. 
There she managed a variety of policy issues 
including agriculture, transportation, environ-
mental, trade secrets and defense matters re-
lated to the Kevlar® paraaramid synthetic fiber 
used in protective vests and helmets. 
In 1989, Clete earned a Master of Arts in 
International Relations from American Univer-
sity in Washington. She attended the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation’s Citizens Academy as 
a member of its Class of 2011, and received 
the 
Washington 
Government 
Relations 
Group’s Reginald ‘‘Reg’’ Gilliam Lifetime 
Achievement Award in 2014 for her excellence 
as a government relations professional. 
She retired from DuPont in 2015 after 29 
years of service, and started her own govern-
ment consulting firm, CDB ProjX. She is often 
seen on Capitol Hill as part of Clemson’s gov-
ernmental affairs organization working to build 
relationships with federal officials and pro-
moting her beloved alma mater. 
Her work with Clemson also extends to vol-
unteer roles. Clete has held many voluntary- 
leadership positions, including serving as a 
former member of both the University’s Board 
of Visitors and the Clemson University Foun-
dation Board of Directors. Currently, she 
chairs the Clemson Institute for Parks Board 
of Advisors. She is a member of the Clemson 
University Tiger Band Association and a long-
time board member of the Baltimore/Wash-
ington, D.C. Clemson Club. 
She has helped organize various Clemson 
events in the Washington area, including 
2017’s Clemson Day at the White House hon-
oring the University’s national championship 
football team. She also helps students of color 
in the D.C. area who are interested in attend-
ing Clemson by connecting them with campus 
contacts or facilitating campus tours. 
In addition to her work with Clemson, Clete 
serves on the boards of the Washington Gov-
ernment Relations Group Foundation and the 
Potomac Riverkeeper Network Leadership 
Council. 
She 
volunteers 
for 
McKenna’s 
Wagon, a mobile food service that feeds peo-
ple in need throughout the D.C. area, and she 
has bicycled hundreds of miles to raise money 
for AIDS charities and to support the fight 
against multiple sclerosis. 
She is a member of the board of the South 
Carolina Business Council and is vice chair-
man of the board of directors of the Briggs, De 
Laine, Pearson Foundation, which focuses on 
providing free after-school and summer tutor-
ing for individuals from low-income back-
grounds in Clarendon County, South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in congratulating Clete 
Boykin on her well-deserved recognition by 
the Clemson Alumni Association. I can think of 
no greater champion of their alma mater, and 
no one more effective or dedicated to her 
work than Clete. She makes Clemson Univer-
sity and her home state of South Carolina very 
proud.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF J. 
ALLEN MARTIN 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize J. Allen Martin for his outstanding 
service to our state. 
Allen has selflessly served the state of 
South Carolina and Clemson University for 
decades. He graduated from Clemson in 1969 
and has since served on several University 
Boards and Committees. For example, Allen 
has served on the Baltimore/DC Clemson 
Club Board of Directors as a leader, host, and 
volunteer for many years and currently serves 
on the Clemson University Foundation Board. 
In addition to his community involvement, 
Allen is the Managing Partner of The Living-
ston Group. Allen was previously the Chief of 
Staff to Congressman Bob Livingston (R–LA) 
throughout Mr. Livingston’s congressional ca-
reer. In 1999, he co-founded The Livingston 
Group, together with the Congressman and 
other former staff members. Allen is well re-
spected for his in-depth knowledge of the gov-
ernment decision-making process and has 
been involved with numerous successful polit-
ical activities and elections throughout the 
United States. 
Allen is a valued, dependable, and humble 
community leader. He has exceeded expecta-
tions in public service, highlighted by his re-
ceipt of numerous honors and accolades. For 
example, Allen recently received the Clemson 
Alumni Association’s Distinguished Service 
Award, the highest honor the Association can 
bestow upon an alumnus or alumna. The Dis-
tinguished Service Award is given to alumni 
who have not only dedicated their life to pro-
fessionalism and public service, but who have 
also 
continued 
a 
lifelong 
dedication 
to 
Clemson University. 
On behalf of the 5th District of South Caro-
lina, it is my most sincere pleasure to recog-
nize Allen for his outstanding leadership and 
public service. I wish him the best of luck 
throughout his future endeavors, as I am con-
fident he will continue to serve and find great 
success in all that he does. 
RECOGNIZING BILL BURTON FOR 
HIS SERVICE 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize Bill Burton for his many 
years of service as a community advocate and 
for his role as the Area Director for the Rainier 
Vista Boys & Girls Club. 
A Rainier Vista native, Bill is an experienced 
and accomplished community leader. He has 
served as the Area Director of the Boys & 
Girls Club since 1980, working tirelessly 
throughout his life to empower local youth. As 
Area Director, Bill was a driving force behind 
fundraising efforts that galvanized the Rainer 
Vista Boys & Girls Club. He turned what was 
once an underdeveloped club into a thriving 
community center that provides Rainier Vista 
children a safe place to grow and learn. 
Today, the Rainier Vista Club serves over 
100 of the neighborhood’s youth through pro-
grams and mentorship to create positive 
change in their community. These achieve-
ments would not have been possible without 
Bill’s passion and dedication for giving young 
people opportunities to become outstanding 
members of their community. 
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege and 
honor to recognize Bill for his outstanding 
achievements and contributions to our com-
munity throughout his career.

EXPRESSING CONCERN WITH U.S. 
FOREIGN POLICY FAILURE TO-
WARDS THE SOLOMON ISLANDS 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to address the massive U.S. failure under the 
Biden Administration in allowing the Solomon 
Islands to align with China. The Solomon Is-
lands’ shift towards Beijing was not out of the 
blue as it is the product of a several year ef-
fort. Further, the Solomon Islands contains the 
blood of over 10,000 U.S. Marines who died 
retaking it from the Japanese, including the in-
famous battle at Guadalcanal. Thousands of 
others were maimed and wounded. What our 
grandfathers paid for in blood, the Chinese 
have bought with money. This is a national 
disgrace and we were entirely unprepared for 
such a significant development in the Pacific 
Ocean. 
This strategic shift truly began in September 
of 2019 when Prime Minister Sogavare an-
nounced the Solomon Islands was switching 
its 36 year diplomatic ties from Taiwan to 
China. With no embassy in the country, the 
U.S. response was limited however the then 
Trump Administration offered an aid package 
to the island of Malaita, the nation’s largest 
province, which is openly out spoken against 
the diplomatic change. 
Shortly after the cessation of the failed Af-
ghanistan withdrawal, China increased its 
meddling in the Solomon Islands. When the 
people of Malaita were refused an audience 
before Prime Minister Sogavare violent riots 
broke out across the capital. While U.S. allies 
responded at first, the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) soon filled the gap with their own 
police and police gear. 
To any international observer the CCP strat-
egy is clear. Shift allegiances, make the Sol-
omon Islands politically and economically de-
pendent on Beijing through Belt and Road Ini-
tiative investment and projects, and make the 
Solomon Islands’ government security based 
on CCP personnel and equipment. Yet there 
is no action from the Biden Administration. Fi-
nally, in February 2020, three years after the 
Solomon Island’s shift from Taiwan, the Biden 
Administration 
announced 
its 
Indo-Pacific 
Strategy and Secretary Blinken states that the 
U.S. will reopen an embassy. This is much too 
late. 
Just last week, Solomon Island officials con-
firm that a police deal has been signed with 
China and that a larger security deal is in the 
finalization phase. The deal grants Chinese 
police and security the right to assist the secu-
rity of the island and to protect Chinese per-
sonnel and projects there. It would, most 
concerningly, allow People’s Liberation Army 
(PLA) Navy ships to carry out logistical stops 
at the island, which likely opens the door to a 
PLA naval base on the Solomon Island, 1,400 
miles from our ally Australia and extending the 
CCP’s military reach and influence towards 
the U.S. and its allies. 
We are watching the CCP’s soft and hard 
power operate in real time, blending its grow-
ing economic, political, and military might to 
slowly take control of a country, creeping clos-
er to becoming a regional hegemon in an 
ocean the U.S. shares a border with and did 
$1.75 trillion in two way trade and whose 
economy accounts for 60 percent of the global 
GDP. 
The reality is that Biden Administration has 
been wrong or too slow on every major foreign 
policy issue since taking office. The failure of 
this Administration with the Solomon Islands 
proves it cannot walk and chew gum at the 
same time, distracted by its failed withdrawal 
operation in Afghanistan, paralyzed by the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine, distracted with 
re-entering into a diplomatic deal which makes 
concessions with the world’s state sponsor of 
terrorism, or too focused on entering into ab-
stract climate and tax deals with foreign na-
tions and international organizations. 
For decades, the American people were told 
by our governing and economic elites that the 
People’s Republic of China under the CCP 
was not a threat. That it would develop and 
align with the West. Yet, we have watched 
China pursue hegemonic dominance in the 
Indo-Pacific, using this regional security to 
project power globally in a manner which 
threatens American economic, political, and 
national security. But all we get from the Biden 
Administration is strategy documents and dip-
lomatic action which is far too late as Beijing 
eyes 2049 and the end of its 100 year mara-
thon. 
Madam Speaker, I recount this series of 
concerning events not to advocate for U.S. 
intervention. I highlight these developments to 
show how the Biden Administration has been 
completely unable or unwilling to use the wide 
range of America’s tools of statecraft to ad-
dress a real security threat, growing Chinese 
power and influence. Instead it is off pursuing 
highly political and abstract foreign policy 
goals which do much less for the security of 
the American people, homeland, and way of 
life. The ease at which the CCP has obtained 
complete influence over another nation in a 
strategically important region of the world 
highlights its growing power and how this Con-
gress and Administration needs to get serious 
about its foreign policy responsibilities.

HONORING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE 
NEW YORK STATE MILITARY MU-
SEUM’S 
VIETNAM 
WAR 
VET-
ERANS COMMEMORATION 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 50th anniversary of the 
Friends of the New York State Military Muse-
um’s Vietnam War Veterans Commemoration, 
honoring all the men and women who served 
our Nation during the Vietnam War. 
The Friends of the New York State Military 
Museum is a nonprofit organization that as-
sists the museum in telling the story of Amer-
ica’s military. For fifty years, this organization 
has held commemoration ceremonies to honor 
the Vietnam War veterans who served be-
tween November 1, 1955 and May 15, 1975. 
They graciously award lapel pins that cele-
brate the brave sacrifices of the servicemen 
and women who spent time on active duty in 
both training and combat. For far too long, our 
Vietnam veterans have gone unheralded for 
their immense bravery during this crucial time 
in our nation’s history. They returned home in-
jured and scarred by the horrors of war yet did 
not receive the gratitude of their fellow citi-
zens. 
The New York State Military Museum began 
their mission to preserve and interpret history 
in 1863. With the help of the Friends of the 
New York State Military Museum, they have 
been able to tell countless stories of our brave 
men and women in uniform. Acting as 
docents, retail associates, and research library 
volunteers, the Friends of the New York State 
Military Museum finds numerous ways to sup-
port museum operations daily. The museum 
holds over ten thousand artifacts and boasts 
impressive research and education programs. 
With their assistance, this museum has been 
able to effectively honor all those that sac-
rificed their lives to protect democracy both at 
home and abroad. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want 
to congratulate the Friends of the New York 
State Military Museum on their fifty years of 
loyal service to our veterans of the Vietnam 
War. And I want to thank the many North 
Country residents that selflessly dedicated 
their lives to our Nation’s armed services.

IN RECOGNITION OF JORDAN WIL-
SON’S SERVICE TO VIRGINIA’S 
FIRST DISTRICT 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 30, 2022 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Jordan Wilson and his 
service to my office, Virginia’s First District, 
and the Nation. 
Jordan joined my office in September 2016 
and has diligently worked his way up from an 
intern to Director of Operations, striving for ex-
cellence in every task along the way. As Staff 
Assistant, Jordan improved our constituent 
services 
program; 
as 
Legislative 
Cor-
respondent, he reformed our letter writing 
process; and finally, as Director of Operations, 
he developed processes to streamline my of-
fice’s operations and worked to pursue my pri-
orities coordinating and creating a schedule to 
maximize my time. 
Jordan has gone above and beyond to con-
tribute to additional duties outside of my office 
as well. He has taught over 330 Hill staff 
through the Congressional Staff Academy’s 
Superior Scheduling training and has become 
a singular hub for questions, concerns, and 
assistance for schedulers across the House 
and Senate. Further, Jordan served on the 
Congressional Committee on Inaugural Cere-
monies in 2020–2021, where he served a cru-
cial role in setting up COVID testing oper-
ations to ensure our Nation’s leaders were 
safe, ultimately contributing to the success of 
Inauguration Day. 
I would like to thank Jordan for his contribu-
tions over the last 6.5 years. He has been a 
key member of my staff in every role he has 
taken up and contributed to the positive office 
culture that my office strives for. I wish Jordan 
the best as he continues his journey in public 
service as the Director of Member Services for 
the Committee on House Administration. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
recognizing Jordan Wilson for his dedication to
