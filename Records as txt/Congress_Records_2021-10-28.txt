DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
October 28, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable ANNA G.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Amazing God, Your love surprises us. 
Regardless of who we are or where we 
have come from, what we have thought 
or how we have lived, You reach into 
our lives, into our very souls and draw 
us into Your loving embrace. How can 
we thank You? 
And then You send us forth to dem-
onstrate what love, joy, peace, pa-
tience, kindness, generosity, and faith-
fulness should look like in this broken 
world. How can we best do that? 
In a time that thrives on superfi-
ciality, may we practice honesty. When 
it is too easy to capitalize on weak-
nesses, 
may 
we 
share 
our 
com-
petencies. Rather than hide our vulner-
ability, may we dare to trust. 
Then may we hear Your encourage-
ment to erase the dividing lines of dif-
ferences that all may be enfolded in 
Your everlasting arms. 
May we rely on Your strength to care 
for those hardened by hurt, that all 
would discover Your tender love. 
Surprise us again and again, O Lord, 
by Your mercy, that we would be in-
spired anew to serve You this day in 
our service to Your world. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Iowa (Mr. FEENSTRA) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. FEENSTRA led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to five requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF ALEX 
ODEH 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of Alex 
Odeh, a peace activist who worked to 
promote civil liberties for Arab Ameri-
cans in the United States and civil and 
human rights around the world. 
A Palestinian immigrant, a published 
poet, lecturer of Arabic language and 
Middle East history at Coastline Col-
lege, Alex was someone who embodied 
the best America has to offer. 
Through his work with the Amer-
ican-Arab Anti-Discrimination Com-
mittee, he dedicated his life to achiev-
ing true equality and equity for all. 
And for daring to push for a better 
tomorrow, Alex was murdered on Octo-
ber 11, 1985, when a pipe bomb exploded 
as he entered his ADC office in Santa 
Ana, California. 
This horrific act of domestic ter-
rorism targeting Arab Americans was 
not new, and I am proud to say it has 
failed to achieve its objectives. 
Arab 
Americans 
and 
Palestinian 
Americans are still here, loud and 
proud, speaking truth to power, and 
carrying on Alex’s fight in his memory. 
Our politics of love are the only re-
sponse. Those who support oppressive 
policies in Palestine that murdered 
Alex 
and 
those 
who 
continue 
to 
fearmonger and whip up hate against 
us to this day will not win. 
We will never give up, Alex. I am 
proud to be here because of you. 
f 
RECOGNIZING WORLD PSORIASIS 
DAY 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, tomorrow we will recognize 
World Psoriasis Day. Psoriasis and pso-
riatic arthritis are diseases that affect 
over 125 million people worldwide. 
As a practicing dermatologist for 25 
years, I have seen firsthand the toll 
that this condition can have on pa-
tients. This disease can often have seri-
ous and long-lasting consequences, in-
cluding anxiety, depression, diabetes, 
and even cardiac issues. 
In the past, we were often, unfortu-
nately, unsuccessful in treating the 
symptoms that the men and women 
battling psoriasis face each and every 
day. 
Recently, however, we are seeing new 
treatments and therapies that have 
dramatically 
improved 
our 
fight 
against psoriasis.

October 28, 2021 
Finding 
new 
and 
more 
effective 
treatments or finding a cure to this 
disease will take all of us. It will take 
doctors, it will take legislators, re-
searchers, 
patients, 
and 
advocates 
working together to find solutions. 
It is my promise that I will continue 
working to address the disease of psori-
asis. 
f 
TEACHER SHORTAGE MUST BE 
RESOLVED 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, as 
the daughter of a public school teacher, 
an essential and prized profession, I 
never expected to see a shortage of 
100,000 teachers. It is catastrophic, es-
pecially now when children are being 
vaccinated and returning to in-person 
learning. The teacher shortage adds ur-
gency to President Biden’s Build Back 
Better agenda, which features teacher 
residences 
and 
grow-your-own 
pro-
grams to improve outcomes and de-
velop more teachers of color. 
As a ranking member who helped 
write the pending infrastructure bill, I 
particularly applaud the Build Back 
Better agenda’s investments in upgrad-
ing school infrastructure with resil-
ient, 
energy-efficient 
buildings 
en-
riched with technology and the labs 
students need for the jobs of the future. 
f 
AMERICANS ARE FEELING THE 
PAIN 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, America is in the midst of an 
energy and supply chain crisis, and 
President Biden is nowhere to be found. 
Instead, this week he will be jetting 
off to Europe for a climate conference 
to brag to our European allies about 
how much he is destroying America’s 
energy economy. 
In the past few months in office, 
President Biden canceled the Keystone 
pipeline, which killed over 11,000 Amer-
ican jobs and paused oil and gas leasing 
on U.S. lands and waters. The con-
sequences of his policy decisions have 
been dire for hardworking American 
families. 
The numbers don’t lie. Home heating 
costs are projected to rise by as much 
as 54 percent. The national average for 
a gallon of gasoline reached $3.38, and 
U.S. households are on track to spend 
$19 billion more on energy by 2030. 
Instead of working on bipartisan cli-
mate solutions, Democrats are more fo-
cused on implementing their radical 
Green New Deal policies and making us 
less energy independent. 
From increased costs at the pump to 
heating bills, Americans are feeling the 
pain of President Biden’s anti-energy 
policy in their wallets. The bottom line 
is socialism just does not work. 
In God we trust. 
f 
OTTUMWA, IOWA, STEPS UP TO 
END ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
group of people from my hometown of 
Ottumwa for taking part in a great 
event for an even greater cause. 
On October 23, 37 teams, comprised of 
170 participants, took part in the 2021 
Walk to End Alzheimer’s in my home-
town of Ottumwa. 
The annual walk, led by the Alz-
heimer’s Association, is held in over 
600 communities across the United 
States to raise funds for research and 
to raise awareness for the disease that 
over 5.8 million Americans currently 
live with, as did my mother prior to 
her death. 
This year, I am proud to announce 
that the Walk to End Alzheimer’s in 
Ottumwa has raised $27,636 thus far, 
with donations still coming in, exceed-
ing their initial goal of $26,000. 
Thank 
you 
to 
the 
residents 
of 
Ottumwa and the over 600 communities 
across the United States who have 
stepped up and stepped forward to put 
an end to this debilitating disease. 
f 
AMERICANS ARE SEETHING OVER 
PUMP PRICES 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, Ameri-
cans are seething over the price of gas 
every time they visit the pump. 
Yesterday the national average for a 
gallon of gas reached $3.39. That is 
more than a $1.24 jump since last year. 
Americans have not seen gas prices 
this high since the Obama-Biden ad-
ministration. Do we see a pattern here? 
Not to mention that in some parts of 
the country, the price for regular gas is 
over $7.50 a gallon. 
Madam Speaker, this is yet another 
crisis that President Biden can tack on 
to his growing list. 
Since his first day in office, Presi-
dent Biden’s actions, and especially his 
policies, have brought America a first- 
class ticket to economic ruin. 
f 
PLEASE DONATE BLOOD IN 
MEMORY OF LOUDEN LOFGREN 
(Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in remembrance of Louden 
Lofgren, the son of my friend and my 
former colleague, Iowa State Senator 
Mark Lofgren. 
Louden sadly passed away at 2 years 
of age after complications from sur-
gery, where he needed multiple blood 
transfusions. 
After he passed away, his family 
launched a blood drive, known as Love 
Like Louden, to encourage folks to do-
nate blood and draw attention to hos-
pital shortages of blood. 
Every 2 seconds, someone in America 
needs blood, and over 38,000 pints are 
needed daily. 
If you can, please consider donating 
blood in Louden’s memory. 
May God bless the Lofgren family.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair

FURTHER

move to suspend the rules and pass the

If H.R. 3684 (117th Congress) is enacted be-
fore the date of enactment of this Act, this 
Act shall not take effect and the provisions 
of this Act shall not be executed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. GRAVES) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5763. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5763, the Further Surface Trans-
portation Extension Act of 2021. 
Here we are again, calling up yet an-
other short-term extension of Federal 
highway, 
transit, 
highway 
safety, 
motor carrier, research, and transpor-
tation financing programs. 
As I stated when the House took up 
the first extension on October 1, the 
House of Representatives did its work 
last summer, which included a 5-year 
authorization of surface programs, well 
in advance of the need for any exten-
sions. And the Senate did later pass a 
5-year authorization. 
We haven’t yet found a path forward 
for both Chambers to pass the same 
version of the bill, but we need to act 
immediately to be certain we don’t 
have a lapse in authorization. There 
are adequate funds in the highway 
trust fund to cover this extension. No 
additional funds will be necessary. 
If we don’t, on October 31, 3,700 em-
ployees will again receive furlough no-
tices that they cannot report to work 
on November 1, or have to work with-
out pay, with a temporary shutdown of 
those programs. 
The Federal Highway Administration 
won’t be able to provide any new fund-
ing to States, the District, or terri-
tories. They will be able to continue re-
imbursing, but a lot of States are be-
ginning—they have initiatives and ap-
plications pending for new programs, 
and all those would be set aside and de-
layed. 
The Federal Transit Administration 
won’t be able to issue new funding to 
1,300 transit grantees that rely on Fed-
eral grants to fund construction; buy 
vehicles and equipment, an ongoing 
process; and, in some cases, pay for op-
erating costs. The FTA can continue to 
make payments for grants issued be-
fore October 1—again, not adequate 
looking at future needs. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration 
cannot 
award 
new 
grants, and the Federal Motor Carrier 
Safety 
Administration 
must 
stop 
issuing 
new 
motor 
carrier 
safety 
grants. 
And the Office of the Secretary will 
not be able to make any further TIFIA 
loans. 
The Further Surface Transportation 
Extension Act of 2021 will allow the De-
partment of Transportation to restart 
operations of programs funded by the 
highway trust fund through December 
3, 2021, which will be a momentous day 
around here. It also authorizes DOT to 
provide backpay for employees in the 
event of a temporary shutdown. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
extension which will help provide addi-
tional time to work through the final 
resolution of a long-term surface trans-
portation bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, reluctantly, I am 
going to support yet another short- 
term extension of the highway pro-
gram. Unfortunately, this simply con-
tinues to put our State departments of 
transportation 
and 
transportation 
stakeholders in a very tough position, 
and they really deserve more than this. 
Let me be clear: The Speaker’s par-
tisan process is what has led us to this 
point, and this predicament highlights 
more than ever the need for us to be 
working across the aisle—and across 
the building, for that matter. 
Nearly a month ago, we were here in 
virtually the same position, having the 
same conversations about the need for 
a 
highway 
extension 
because 
the 
Speaker is holding the infrastructure 
bill hostage for her real priority. And 
we all know what that is. It is a mas-
sive, multitrillion-dollar tax-and-spend 
wish list. 
This should not be how it is, tying 
the hands of an entire Congress to pass 
a socialist agenda that folks in Amer-
ica just simply don’t support. Infra-
structure has never been this way. Bi-
partisanship has always been the for-
mula for success on infrastructure, and 
that hasn’t changed. It hasn’t changed 
any at all. 
While this process may have started 
out as a bipartisan piece of legislation 
in the Senate, the Speaker made darn 
sure that as soon as the bill was sent 
across the Capitol, it immediately was 
tainted with her ultraliberal, partisan 
agenda. 
In my 20 years in Congress, I have 
supported all three highway bills that 
have been signed into law. All of them 
were bipartisan, all of them under Re-
publican chairmen, all of them signed 
into law by both Democrat and Repub-
lican Presidents. 
House Republicans have stood ready 
and committed to participate in a 
truly bipartisan process that involves 
input from both the House and the Sen-
ate, not just one Chamber, and both 
parties. We were ready to come to the 
negotiation table. 
Earlier this year, House Republicans 
warned that a partisan path would put 
us in a position like this, and here we 
are. 
The chairman is absolutely right. 
Passing this extension is the right 
thing to do. The last thing we need, 
though, is a series of short-term exten-
sions. A longer extension is a much- 
preferred path because it allows our 
States to plan with certainty. 
Multiple short-term extensions are 
extremely detrimental to the States. 
They are detrimental to the stake-
holders and the jobs that support these 
critical projects and programs. 
Extensions mean leaving the States 
with uncertainty to fix, to maintain, to 
upgrade roads and bridges. And you 
can’t plan multiyear infrastructure 
and highway projects with the guar-
antee of only a few weeks of funding at 
any one time. 
So it is time to get back to what 
works, and that is bipartisanship on 
both sides of this building. That is the 
key to success when it comes to infra-
structure. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
short-term extension and support our

States’ transportation programs. How-
ever, next time around, we really need 
to consider a longer term extension. It 
is what is best for the States. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, and if the 
gentleman is prepared to close, I would 
be prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Again, it is unfortunate that we are 
here today as Democrats continue ne-
gotiating their partisan reconciliation 
proposal while an infrastructure bill 
sits. It sits idly and serves nothing 
more than those partisan programs. 
This is nothing more than a Trojan 
horse, Madam Speaker, and it is being 
used for its popularity to get votes for 
the progressive wish list. I believe our 
State DOTs and our State transpor-
tation stakeholders, every one of them 
deserve better. 
I hardly think that this short-term 
extension gives certainty to those 
folks, and I recognize that what is even 
worse is the fact that there is no cer-
tainty whatsoever. 
Given that, reluctantly, I do urge 
support of this short-term extension 
with the expectation that a longer 
term extension will be needed the next 
time that we are here doing this once 
again. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, just to reiterate for 
colleagues that may be listening, this 
extension goes till December 3. There 
are adequate funds in the highway 
trust fund to fund all the regular pro-
grams. This will be at current author-
ization levels. 
It will allow States to move forward 
and propose new highway and bridge 
projects. It will allow transit agencies 
to go ahead and acquire new equipment 
and make other necessary repairs or 
improvements to their systems. 
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration and the National High-
way Traffic Safety Administration will 
be at full operating and full funding, so 
there will be no lapse should we pass 
this now. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFA-
ZIO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 5763. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas

Proiect Summary 
FACTSHEET 
NEW U.S. COURTHOUSE 
HUNTSVILLE, AL 
PBS 
Public Law (P.L.) No. 115-141, the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, enacted on 
March 24, 2018, appropriated $110,000,000 for the construction of a new United States 
Courthouse in Huntsville, Alabama. Of that amount, the General Services Administration 
(GSA) determined that $86,463,000 would be needed to construct the new courthouse, and 
the balance of the appropriation would be used to renovate and backfill the existing U.S. 
Courthouse and Post Office. 
On September 24, 2018, GSA submitted a prospectus (PAL-CTC-HU18) to the House 
Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on 
Environment and Public Works for the courthouse construction project in Huntsville at an 
estimated cost of $86,463,000. The prospectus proposed the design and construction of a 
new courthouse of approximately 123,100 gross square feet, including 26 parking spaces, 
to meet the 10-year space needs of the court and court-related agencies. The site could 
accommodate the anticipated 30-year needs of the court. 
The House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public 
Works approved the prospectus on December 12, 2018, and February 5, 2019, respectively. 
Following the Committees' approvals of the prospectus, GSA issued a design-build 
solicitation and received offers for the base construction contract and alternatives that 
exceed $86,463,000. The increase in cost between the construction cost estimate in the 
approved prospectus and the receipt of offers is the result of several factors. The increase 
in labor costs and supply chain disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic are believed to 
be the primary drivers in the escalation. Additionally, a cost increase is associated with a 
contract alternative, not included in the base contract, to clad the exterior facade fully in 
limestone, a construction material not originally assumed in the project budget. 
The 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, P.L. No. 115-141 authorizes GSA to exceed 
the cost of new construction and acquisition projects by not more than 10% of amounts 
included in the prospectus. This escalation authority will allow GSA to make a base 
construction award with no modifications to either the submitted prospectus or the 
Committees' approvals. 
Modifying the contract to clad the exterior facade fully in 
limestone would cause the total project cost to exceed 110% of the approved estimated 
total project cost. 
GSA proceeded with the base construction contract award prior to the expiration of offers 
to avoid further increases in costs. The contract alternative for the limestone facade is still 
available, but the original bid pricing has expired. The contractor's original bid to add the 
limestone was $5,767,650. However, if GSA were to exercise this contract alternative, the 
cost to incorporate full limestone would be subject to current market conditions, necessary 
redesign and an additional time extension. For GSA to modify the contract to add a full

limestone facade, the Senate Committee on Environmental and Public Works and the 
House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure would need to modify the existing 
resolutions to approve the use of the entire $110,000,000 appropriation. The approvals 
would need to occur no later than December 1, 2021, to make funds available to award the 
alternative to the contractor. Without the necessary approvals from the Committees by this 
date, the additional cost and schedule impact of the full limestone fa<;ade alternative will 
preclude GSA from further consideration of this alternative.

Proposed Proiect 
The project proposes to relocate existing first and second floor tenants to absorb SSA from 
a leased location, remove industrial space inefficiencies in the former postal workroom, 
and reconfigure space to maximize its utility and ability to house more efficiently future 
Federal agencies. The project wilJ optimize the design layout to increase the marketability 
of the building.

$11,514,000 
The Federal Building at 801 I Street has sufl'tm:d chronic space vacancy due to its industrial 
space layout that was built lo accommodate the fonuer U.S. Postal Service tenant. This 
project will address the building's vacancy, increase efficiency, and revitalize one of GSA's 
historic assets. 
ln addition, the Government will realize a lease cost avoidance of 
approximately $600,000 annually, vvirh relocation of SSA from its current leased location 
to the Federal Building. 
Summa 
This project will be designed to confonn to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the Pubiic Buildings Service. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and 
water efficiency (including renewable energy and fossil free measures), adherence to 
sustainable design principles, and minimizing climate risk liabilities above the minimum 
perfonnance criteria in a manner that is life cycle cost-effective.

FEDERAL BUILDING -11000 WILSHIRE BOULEVARD 
LOS ANGELES, CA 
PBS

Congressional District: 
PCA-0168-LA22 
CA-33 
Justification 
In May 2017. the East Annex was badly damaged in a fire that started in the U.S. Postal 
Service space and quickly spread throughout the annex building. Emergency remediation 
and encapsulation efforts were completed to prevent further damage to the annex, but it 
remains unsuitable for occupancy, leaving the complex without 19,000 usable square feet 
of critical office and joint-use space. Temporary space on the 7th floor of the tower now 
houses some of the agencies, but there is no longer a cafeteria or post oflice. Renovating 
the East Annex will allow the agencies to vacate the 7th floor of the tower. 
The Federal Building (main tower) provides secure. long-term housing for Federal 
agencies with a mission-critical need to be located in west Los Angeles. The building was 
constructed in 1969 and has never been modernized. with many building systems beyond 
their useful service, including the HVAC and electrical systems. In addition, hazardous 
material abatement from the underside of floor decking will mitigate a life-safety liability. 
Exterior construction will correct widespread glazing gasket failure and deteriorating 
sealant and caulking. GSA's Seismic Rating System Report, released on March 31, 2016, 
lists the main tower of the Federal Building complex as a high seismic priority in the GSA 
portfolio. Plumbing upgrades will mitigate antiquated fixtures, equipment and piping. 
Summar 
Water Sustainabilit and Clim e Risk Com liance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the Public Buildings Service. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and 
water efficiency (including renewable energy and fossil free measures), adherence to 
sustainable design principles, and minimizing climate risk liabilities above the minimum 
performance criteria in a manner that is life cycle cost-effective.

PROSPECTUS-ALTERATION 
RONALD REAGAN BUILDING COMPLEX 
WASHINGTON, DC 
PBS 
Prospectus Number: 
PDC-0000AF-DC22 
Justification 
The RRB Complex's main fire alarm system requires replacement. The system has reached 
the end of its useful life, and the manufacturer has issued notice that the panel will no 
longer be supported with parts and service. Presently, when failures arise, GSA has to send 
existing parts out to second-party electronics refurbishers to be fixed and repaired. 
In addition to replacement of the fire alarm system, numerous life-safety improvements 
need to be undertaken, including relocating/expanding/providing sprinkler replacement in 
accordance with applicable nationally recognized codes and standards as well as Federal 
laws and regulations, installing firestopping where mi ssinglinadequate, providing 
additional signaling and notification device coverage, correcting inadequate exit signage, 
and directing egress to outdoor pathways. 
The repairs or replacement of the fire and life safety systems will provide reliable, efficient 
service and ensure that current building codes, fire, life safety, and accessibility 
requirements are met. If the existing system fails, GSA will be required to implement a 
fire watch. Depending on the type and extent of the impairment, the cost of the fire watch 
could amount to approximately $150,000 per day. 
Summary of Energy, Water, Sustainability, and Climate Risk Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the Public Buildings Service. 
GSA 
encourages 
(a) design opportunities to 
increase energy and water efficiency (including renewable energy and fossil fuel free 
measures), (b) adherence to sustainable design principles and ( c) minimizing climate risk 
liabilities above the minimum performance criteria in a manner that is life cycle cost-
effective.

The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes the second of a two-phase repair and 
alteration project for the Regional Office Building (ROB) located at 301 7th Street SW in 
downtown Washington, DC. This project will renovate and modernize the building in two 
phases (with Phase I previously approved and funded) in preparation for a permanent 
Government-owned location for several Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
components, including Science and Technology (S&T), the Office of Biometric Identity 
Management (OBIM), Undersecretary for Management subgroups, and Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement Office of Professional Responsibility (ICE-OPR). Major building 
systems will be upgraded to accommodate a current housing plan of 4,374 personnel, 
resulting in a maximum, all-in DHS utilization rate (UR) of 159 square feet per person. 
The completion of both phases reduces the DHS real estate footprint by more than l 09,000 
usable square feet (USF) and provides an annual lease cost avoidance of approximately 
$20,800,000 and an annual agency rent savings of approximately $11,700,000. 
This prospectus amends Prospectus No. PDC-0031-WA20 to account for the two-phase 
approach and request for additional funding. GSA is requesting approval of an additional 
estimated design cost of $4,941,000, additional estimated construction cost of $82,529,000, 
and additional estimated management and inspection costs of $1,702,000, for a total 
additional cost of $89,172,000 to account for a more comprehensive building 
modernization that addresses the long-term housing needs of DHS and a phased 
construction approach that allows for swing space during the full building modernization. 
FY 2022 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested 
(Design, Construction, Management & Inspection) ..................................... $89,172,000 
Maior Work Items 
Interior alterations; plumbing, HV AC (heating ventilation, and air conditioning), electrical,

Building 
The ROB is located near the L'Enfant Plaza Metro Station at 301 7t1
1 Street SW in 
Washington, DC. As constructed, it contains approximately 941,463 gross square feet, 
including approximately 845,169 rentable square feet or 612,593 USF. The building was 
originally built as a warehouse in two phases between 1929 and 1932; it was later adapted 
for office use in a haphazard fashion, resulting in poor circulation and office layout. The 
building contains seven above-grade floors and a basement. Its electrical system has both 
capacity and distribution issues that make it difficult and costly to perform even minor 
space alterations. Building elevators are far beyond their useful life, resulting in frequent 
outages of one or more elevators, and often only custom or rebuilt parts can be used to 
repair them. The building's HV AC system is also well past its useful life. There are 
distribution issues that create hot and cold areas throughout the building, regardless of the

Proposed Proiect 
The proposed project will be completed in two phases and will allow DHS to reduce the 
UR of their current housing from 205 square feet per person to 159 while reducing their 
real estate footprint by more than 190,000 USF under the current housing plan. Phase I 
includes the renovation of the major building systems across the eastern half of the 
building, which includes opening the interior floor plates and replacing the conveyance, 
plumbing, HV AC, electrical, and fire protection systems. Phase II of the project will 
include completion of the upgrades of the major systems across the western half of the 
building. 
This includes opening the interior floor plates and replacement of the 
conveyance, plumbing, HV AC, electrical, and fire protection systems. Completing the 
redesign of the building's circulation pattern will recapture usable office space and increase 
the space efficiency by utilizing an open plan office concept to the greatest extent possible. 
Furthermore, the project will aim to provide an open architecture systems approach to the 
infrastructure to allow for a high-performance workspace which focuses on the health, 
safety, and comfort of personnel and to provide flexibility and ease of accommodation for 
the operators of the building.

property resides on a highly valuable location in downtown Washington, DC, adjacent to 
five Metrorail lines and one block from the National Mall. The proposed accommodation 
of additional DHS personnel into the ROB requires an open office environment to 
maximize the building space, yet currently, only a small portion of the building, primarily 
on the second and seventh floors, is built out as open office space. Additionally, the 
location of mechanical rooms, electrical and telecommunication closets, and restrooms 
varies from floor to floor, resulting in inefficient distribution of electrical and plumbing 
systems and consequent energy waste. 
A majority of the building's major systems are outdated, have reached the end of their 
useful lives and result in poor indoor air quality and pronounced tenant discomfort in the 
winter and summer months. Approximately one-fifth of the air handling units (AHUs) are 
more than three decades old, and the steam piping and condensate return lines are greater 
than 50 years old. The HVAC system consists of a central chilled water plant in the 
basement and rooftop cooling towers, with heating provided by steam supplied by GSA's 
central heating plant. In accordance with Facilities Standards jbr the Public Buildings 
Service (GSA P-100), steam heating systems should be converted to hot water upon 
entrance to the building. Six cooling towers located on the roof are in fair to poor condition 
and require replacement. Several AHUs on each floor distribute tempered air by low 
pressure ductwork to constant volume devices in the occupied spaces. Corridors typically 
provide the path for return air, a violation of current code that requires correction. 
The existing sub power and lighting distribution panels throughout the building are in fair 
to poor condition. Multiple electrical panels are more than 40 years old, and the associated 
feeders are well beyond the end of their expected useful life. 
The building's vertical transportation systems include 10 passenger elevators and 2 freight 
elevators, 1 of which has not been operational for several years. Periodic entrapments 
occur that have lasted up to 20 minutes per incident. Such incidents are the result of high 
use of aging elevators that run on pulley systems rather than hydraulic systems. Many 
replacement parts needed are obsolete and can be difficult to obtain. 
The existing fire protection system is outdated and will be replaced. The sprinkler system 
will be expanded to provide protection across the whole building since the current sprinkler 
system only covers approximately 60 percent of the building. 
Summary of Energy, Water, Sustainability, and Climate Risk Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standard,;; jbr

Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best interest of 
the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy.

The Bean Center is a three-story, concrete-framed structure with brick and stone exterior 
walls located at 8899 East 56th Street in Indianapolis, IN. The building measures 
approximately 1,660,000 gross square feet and is situated on a 72-acre site. It was 
constructed in 1953 as a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) records storage facility. 
Ownership of the building was transferred to GSA in 1996, at which time the facility was 
renovated for its current office use.

The building is experiencing a serious structural failure that poses life safety hazard to its 
occupants and visitors. The roof parapet is separating from the roof and moving outwardly 
over the building's perimeter facades. There is a significant risk of large portions of the 
roof parapet falling off the building, and the risk grows greater as the parapet continues to 
move further. The movement is also causing delamination of the building's exterior 
coating, which continues to fall off the building. Access to portions of the exterior has been 
restricted, and temporary protective netting and scaffolding have been installed to protect 
tenants from any falling debris.

The major tenant of this facility is the USDA DISC data center. DISC's critical mission 
provides payments to farmers, food-stamp recipients, and U.S. Forest Service firefighting 
logistics costs and payments. among other functions. Its functionality requires it to be a 
Tier 4 data center. Upgrades to site security, as well as to both the pedestrian and vehicular 
traffic circulation, is critical due to the proximity of traffic to the building. 
The single-pane windows are original to the building and have reached the end of their 
useful lives. Upgrading to double-pane windows with blast protection will meet security 
requirements. save energy. and improve the tenant work environment. 
The building's HVAC equipment and switchgear equipment are at or near the end of their 
useful lives. The addition of a generator is to address redundancy requirements and 
identified dcftcicncics related to the tenant's Continuity of Operations Plan for building 
operation emergency loads. 
Summa 
Sustainabili 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the Public B11ildi11gs Sen,fce. ( iSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and 
water efficiency (including renewable energy and fossil frt:e measures), adherence to 
sustainable design principles, and minimizing climate risk liabilities above the minimum

Justification 
The MRC requires significant modifications and alterations resulting from, but not limited 
to, code deficiencies, deteriorated envelope condition, and components and building 
systems at the end of their useful life cycle. 
The MRC building needs significant repair to maintain the integrity of this historic asset 
and to provide long-te1m use of the building. This project is needed to address failing 
building systems at the end of their useful life cycle. This project will address notable code 
violations and deficiencies related to the building systems. life-safety, and accessibility. 
The most critical and time-sensitive elements of repair are the building's envelope and 
historic windows. The building envelope is the major contributing factor to moisture 
intrusion and potentially unhealthy conditions for the: occupants. The state of the envelope 
and windows also creates increased energy consumption. 
Water Sustainabili 
liance 
This project will desi1:,rn to contemn to requirements of the Facilities Standard,· for the 
Public Buildings Se11 1ice. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and 
water efficiency (including renewable energy and fossil free measures), adherence to 
sustainable design principles, and minimizing climate risk liabilities above the minimum

The project proposes replacing 13 air handler units and the associated steam, hot water 
heating, and chilled water system components in the building. In addition, all new and 
portions of existing equipment. including electrical systems, will be tied into a recently 
installed building automation system. Before the new rooftop equipment (cooling towers) 
is installed. the roof over the affected areas of the sixth floor will be replaced. Lightning 
protection and a fall arrest system \1.till also be provided.

The Weis Com1house supports the operations of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third 
Circuit and the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Most of the 
HVA.C system is more than 50 years old and has surpassed its expected useful life. with 
older units still utilizing antiquated pneumatic and communication controls. With multiple 
system components exceeding their expected service lives ,md in a deteriorated condition, 
the risk is increasing for a system failun: and outage to portions of floors. Failures would 
lead to a significant disruption to the judiciary's ability to meet caseload requirements. In 
addition, GSA has been working to improve space utilization within the building and 
building systems need to be upgraded to continue to support tenants. Overall vacancy is 
expected to decrease from l 7~/o to 5% with several planned backfills. including a large U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court backfill recently approved as part of the FY 2020 Capital Investment 
and Leasing Program. 
The scope also includes replacement of the plumbing and electrical systems associated with 
the HVAC infrastructure. as these are more than 50 years old and past their expected useful 
lives. Interior alterations are expected where work has impacted walls and ceilings. As a 
result of past projects in the building. asbestos and lead-based paint have been discovered. 
so hazardous material abatement is required.

The sixth-floor roof is proposed as part of this project due to the placement of the cooling 
towers. Both cooling towers are located on the sixth-floor roof~ and the roof will be 
impacted by the replacement of both towers. Lightning protection and a fall arrest system 
are not present on the affected roof and need to be addressed.

FY 2022 Proiect Summary 
PPR-0017-SJ22 
NIA 
The General Services Administration (GSA) requests approval and funding for the design 
of the first phase of a multi-phase project for design and construction of a new U.S. 
Courthouse Annex (Annex), along with alteration of the Federico Degetau Federal 
Building (Degetau) and Clemente Ruiz Nazario (Nazario) U.S. Courthouse Complex 
(Complex) in the Hato Rey section of San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
The proposed Annex, consisting of approximately 153,000 gross square feet (GSF), 
including 35 inside parking spaces, will be constructed directly adjacent to the Complex 
and be linked physically, functionally, and systematically with the existing buildings. The 
Complex will meet the 10-year space needs of the court and court-related agencies, and the 
Complex will accommodate the anticipated 30-year needs of the court. 
The Judiciary's Courthouse Project Priorities (CPP) list (approved by the Judicial 
Conference of the United States in September 2020) includes a courthouse project in San 
Juan. The Judicial Conference designated Hato Rey as a judicial space emergency, 
prioritizing it above all new courthouse construction projects. 
FY 2022 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested 
(Design) .................................................................................. $22,476,000 
Buildings 
Degetau and Nazario, constructed in 1974, and comprising 435,000 GSF, are situated on a 
27-acre campus (Campus) in the Hato Rey section of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Campus 
also includes a standalone childcare center, independent parking structure, and the newly 
constructed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) building. The Campus represents the 
largest facility under GSA's jurisdiction, custody, and control in the Caribbean. 
Overview of Proiect 
The proposed Annex will be located on the southwest corner of the Campus, adjoining both 
Degetau and Nazario. 
Construction of this Annex will provide 6 new courtrooms and 10 new chambers. Upon 
completion, the Annex and Nazario, in total, will provide 12 courtrooms and 17 chambers, 
consistent with the application of courtroom sharing policies and limitation on the 
provision of space for projected judgeships.

Justification 
PPR-0017-SJ22 
NIA 
The existing Complex does not meet the 2007 U.S. Courts Design Guide Standards (as 
partially revised in 2016) and lacks adequate security. The existing building configuration 
does not allow for distinct separation between restricted, secured, and public areas. The 
current Complex has significant space, security, and operational deficiencies necessitating 
the construction of the Annex. The Judicial Conference designated this location as a space 
emergency, prioritizing it above all new courthouse construction projects. The judicial 
Complex will provide separate circulation for public, judges, and prisoners, thereby 
improving security as well as efficiency of court operations. 
GS A's Seismic Rating System Report lists Degetau as being exceptionally high risk (EHR). 
The report proposed a series of both structural and nonstructural retrofits to ensure the 
buildings meet established performance criteria for seismic safety. 
As Degetau needs to be entirely vacated before the seismic and mechanical upgrades can 
take place, the Annex will be constructed first. The swing space needs will be met in 
portions of the new Annex and elsewhere on the Campus. The Magistrate Court and jury 
assembly will relocate from Degetau to their permanent location in Nazario. 
Degetau has approximately 90,000 USF of vacant space, predominantly from the relocation 
of the FBI to its new facility on the Campus. Once the seismic and alteration work in 
Degetau is complete, the building will be backfilled with the tenants temporarily relocated 
into swing space, as well as tenants currently located in leased space, and final tenant 
improvements of the Annex will be completed. 
This project as proposed simultaneously addresses the long-term needs of the courts, 
provides the necessary security and circulation requirements, and addresses seismic and 
systems needs at the Degetau Building. Furthermore, the backfill of vacant space in 
Degetau allows for improved utilization of federally owned space. 
Design Guide Exception 
There are no exceptions to the 2007 U.S. Courts Design Guide (as partially revised in 
2016).

mortar joints. Materials on the building's exterior. such as exterior stone and pieces of 
mortar, are falling off the building and posing a risk to pedestrians. In anticipation of further 
degradation, the building facade has been netted to protect pedestrians below. The

require replacement to prevent further water intrusion. The HVAC system has had multiple 
modifications since original constrnction and needs complete replacement for code 
compliance and energy efficiency. 1be electrical system throughout the building is dated 
and no longer serviceable. Public corridors, elevator lobbies. cou1trooms, and public 
restrooms require maintenance and repair as identified in the historic building preservation 
plan. The aging elevators require parts that are no longer available. Plumbing systems are 
a combination of original and retrofit piping and are unsafe to test due to extensive 
co1Tosion. Site work will address poor drainage conditions, trip hazards. and deteriorated 
parking areas. Life-safety work will correct fire rating of doors and walls in mechanical 
spaces, emergency lighting, the aging fire alarm and sprinkler system, and exit signage. 
Summa 
Water Sustainabili 
and Climate Risk Com liance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities St(mdards for 
the Public Buildings Service. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and 
water etliciency (including renewable energy and fossil free measures), adherence to 
sustainable design principles, and minimizing climate risk liabilities above the minimum 
perfonnancc criteria in a manner that is life cycle cost-effective.

The building's fhca<le is in disrepair and failing. The pn:cast concrete panels are mounted 
to a steel support system and, due to the nature of the finish and improper drainage, the 
panels are cracking, spalling, and presenting a safety hazard. 
A seismic evaluation found major structural deficiencies, including inadequate shear walls, 
discontinuous walls terminating at the first suspended level (northwest stair tower), and 
inadequate diaphragm connections to shear walls, and existing facade precast panels and 
connections cannot accommodate building drift.

Secmity equipment and queuing layout in the entry lobby frequently result in delays and

October 28, 2021 
WHERE IS THE SENATE? 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, as the 
United States reasserts itself on the 
world’s stage, it is time for robust en-
gagement. We must reengage with our 
allies and regain our footing as a global 
leader. But we are standing in our own 
way. 
Mr. Speaker, 100 ambassadorial posi-
tions are currently unfilled, with 60 
awaiting Senate action. Where is the 
Senate? 
Mr. Speaker, more than 300 national 
security professionals asked this same 
question this morning in a letter to 
Senate leadership. 
We do not have representatives to 
NATO, the European Union, ASEAN, or 
the Organization of American States. 
Despite our significant interests in the 
Middle East, we lack an Assistant Sec-
retary of State for Near East Affairs 
and an ambassador to Israel. 
Mr. Speaker, we are sending a dan-
gerous message of neglect and indiffer-
ence to our allies and adversaries. The 
Senate must act. 
I join the hundreds of esteemed 
former ambassadors and Pentagon offi-
cials in urging the Senate to begin 
hearings and to schedule votes for all 
pending State Department and USAID 
nominees. 
I include in the RECORD a letter from 
Foreign Policy for America. 
FOREIGN POLICY FOR AMERICA, 
Washington, DC, October 28, 2021. 
Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Senator BOB MENENDEZ, 
Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations, Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Senator JAMES E. RISCH, 
Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations, Washington, DC. 
We write as senior national security pro-
fessionals to express our alarm over the dan-
gerously slow pace of Senate confirmations 
of State Department and USAID officials 
over the past ten months. The resulting va-
cancies have damaged U.S. national security 
and our ability to address international 
threats. We ask for your urgent attention to 
resolving this situation. 
The United States cannot afford to be ab-
sent at this time of strategic competition 
with China. Yet, at this moment, 100 Ambas-
sadorial positions are unfilled with 60 await-
ing Senate action. As President Biden pre-
pares to meet with world leaders at the G20 
summit, the Senate has confirmed just two 
of the president’s Ambassadorial nomina-
tions to G20 member states. As the world 
works to fight the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
United States lacks both an Assistant Sec-
retary for International Organization Affairs 
and a USAID Assistant Administrator for 
Global Health. Of the 17 world leaders known 
to be attending the COP26 climate summit in 
Glasgow in November, only one has had the 
opportunity to coordinate in advance with a 
confirmed U.S. Ambassador. Nearly half of 
Ambassadorial posts on the African con-
tinent have nominees stalled in the Senate. 
The sum total of missed opportunities is 
staggering. 
In addition to placing the United States at 
a strategic disadvantage, Washington has 
sent an unfortunate message of neglect and 
indifference. We currently lack Representa-
tives to both NATO and the European Union, 
to ASEAN, and to the Organization of Amer-
ican States. In Canada, France, Germany, 
and the United Kingdom, the lack of con-
firmed U.S. Ambassadors neglects historic 
allies. Despite our significant interests in 
the Middle East and the threats posed by 
Iran, the United States currently has neither 
an Assistant Secretary of State for Near 
East Affairs nor an Ambassador to Israel. As 
we call for a free and open Indo-Pacific, the 
United States lacks an Ambassador not only 
to China, but to Australia, Bangladesh, 
India, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, 
Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thai-
land, and Vietnam. 
In Washington, widespread leadership va-
cancies and stopgap appointments have re-
sulted in an overstretched workforce and un-
acceptable risks. As conflicts and natural 
disasters spur population displacement un-
seen since World War II, the United States 
has neither an Assistant Secretary of State 
for Population, Refugees, and Migration nor 
an Assistant Secretary of State for Conflict 
and Stability Operations. President Biden’s 
nominee for Assistant Secretary of State for 
South and Central Asian Affairs, whose nom-
ination was announced on April 23rd, was not 
confirmed until September 13th, well after 
the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. The 
State Department is planning to host a glob-
al Summit for Democracy in December, but 
does so without an Assistant Secretary for 
Democracy, 
Human 
Rights, 
and 
Labor. 
Countless other vacancies have resulted in 
unsustainable workloads, undermining mo-
rale and retention. 
As you are aware, the Senate has thus far 
confirmed only two of President Biden’s am-
bassadorial nominees, and just eleven Assist-
ant Secretaries of State. At USAID, only two 
appointees requiring Senate confirmation 
have been approved. Of the 235 Senate-con-
firmed State Department positions, only 24 
have confirmed occupants, while 83 are at 
the Senate awaiting confirmation. This is 
well below the number of nominees con-
firmed at similar points in the first terms of 
Presidents Trump, Obama, and George W. 
Bush. 
We note with particular regret that indi-
vidual Senators have blocked the confirma-
tions of exceptionally qualified nominees for 
reasons completely unrelated to their cre-
dentials. There is no question that this prac-
tice, which has been employed by members 
of both parties, has eroded America’s global 
leadership and contributed to a perception 
among our friends as well as our adversaries 
that the United States is in decline. 
The steady atrophying of our diplomatic 
capacity poses an unacceptable risk to U.S. 
national security. We urge you to exercise 
decisive leadership to swiftly facilitate com-
mittee hearings and votes for all pending 
State Department and USAID nominees. If 
unanimous consent agreements cannot be 
obtained to expedite votes, we ask that you 
once again dedicate the floor time necessary 
to approve these nominations by regular 
order. 
Sincerely,

f 
FURTHER INCREASES IN ENERGY 
COSTS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, as 
Congress leaves for the weekend, we 
have to alert the American public over 
the potential results of the Build Back 
Better bill as well as the American 
Rescue Plan that was already passed. 
Soon we will be getting our winter 
heat bills in the Midwest. If you are 
from Wisconsin, if you are from Michi-
gan, if you are from Minnesota, look 
out, because we have a big increase in 
energy costs, and you ought to be cut-
ting back on your spending right now. 
In any event, this bill looks like it is 
stoked up for more spending, which 
means more inflation. We have new 
Pell grants for people who are here ille-
gally, and the idea of getting free col-
lege for people here illegally and pay-
ing for it by inflating the dollar still 
more is just plain irresponsible. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the American 
people to pay attention because if this 
bill passes, it will be further increases 
in your heat bill. 
f 
IRS SURVEILLANCE 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, today I come 
to the House floor with bad news for 
American workers and small busi-
nesses. Democrats are pushing a mis-
guided provision within their massive 
tax-and-spend boondoggle that will 
allow the Internal Revenue Service to 
spy on practically every financial ac-
count in the United States. 
Included in their $5.5 trillion social-
ist, tax-and-spend package is a pro-
posal to create an IRS surveillance pro-
gram that would require all financial 
institutions to monitor, track, and re-
port accounts that have more than 
$10,000 worth of inflow or outflow in a 
given year without limit. 
This is nothing short of widespread, 
indiscriminate government spying that 
lays bare a direct threat to our Amer-
ican way of life. The Democrats’ plan 
to give the IRS unfettered access to 
the personal and private finances of 
American citizens is a gross abuse of 
power and should be deeply concerning 
to anyone who values privacy and eco-
nomic inclusion. 
Given the IRS’ past reputation, there 
is little reason to believe in the agen-
cy’s capacity to protect this unprece-
dented access to our personal financial 
information from cyberattacks and 
other security breaches. 
As the concept of a surveillance state 
becomes more of a reality, we must op-
pose Democrats’ far-left, socialist poli-
cies. 
f 
BUDGET RECONCILIATION AND 
THE HYDE AMENDMENT 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, as with 
any massive spending package, the 
Democrats’ $3.5 trillion—it may be get-
ting smaller—reconciliation bill does 
have some good items in it that we 
could agree on in a better package, 
such as critically important disaster 
relief funds for fires, flood, and other 
recovery efforts. 
Unfortunately, tucked amongst this 
are some necessary programs but also 
attempts by the Democrats to once 
again circumvent the Hyde amend-
ment, originally passed in the House in 
1976, and which would force American 
taxpayers to fund elective abortions. 
In the reconciliation bill, there are 
millions of dollars worth of public 
health grants not Hyde-protected. This 
bill also mandates abortion coverage in 
the Affordable Care Act for plans cov-
ering individuals above the poverty 
line. 
Additionally, it sets aside $1.75 bil-
lion for public health activities that 
would allow the CDC to construct fa-
cilities that perform elective abortion 
and trains others to do so. 
If this bill is adopted as currently 
written, violating the Hyde amend-
ment, all Americans will have to pay 
for abortions regardless of their State’s 
policies or their own moral or religious 
convictions. 
f 
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ON THE 
MOVE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this morning President Joseph Biden 
was brilliant. He gathered together the 
members of the Democratic Caucus, 
and he spoke to the American people 
about the brilliance of a seismic, mon-
umental effort to change the lives of 
generations of Americans. 
We as Democrats stood united behind 
the framework of Build Back Better, 
realizing that we will change the lives 
of kindergartners and children across 
the land and change the world. With 
universal preschool for 3- and 4-year- 
olds; affordable, high-quality childcare; 
affordable, high-quality care for hun-
dreds of thousands of those older Amer-
icans in the latter part of their lives, 
allowing them to live at home in dig-
nity—expanded child tax cut, is what I 
would like to call it—we stood unified. 
For all the chattering about friends 
on the other side of the aisle, name one 
good deed that they have done to 
change generations of Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand 
with Joe Biden, the President of the 
United States. When he leaves and goes 
to the G20, he will be able to say that 
he has a united Caucus that believes in 
climate change, that believes in hu-
manity and the human infrastructure 
that Build Back Better is. 
We are on the move. We are on the 
road. We are going to pass both bills. 
And we are going to change Americans’ 
lives forever and ever and ever. I am 
proud to be a Democrat and to stand in 
this monumental era of our time. 
Mr. Speaker, tell the American peo-
ple we are on the move.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

ATTORNEY GENERAL GARLAND 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday 
brought 
reports 
that 
carjackings in my hometown of Louis-
ville were up 150 percent since 2019, and 
the city’s 2021 murder total is rapidly 
closing in on an alltime record that 
was set just last year. 
These aren’t just local problems; 
they are national trends. Twenty-twen-
ty saw the homicide rate jump more 
than at any point in over a century— 
the worst spike in the murder rate in 
more than 100 years. 
The law enforcement crises don’t 
stop there. Our southern border saw 
more illegal crossings last year than in 
any year on record. Yet ICE has made 
its fewest interior arrests in a decade. 
A crime epidemic and a border cri-
sis—these are the sorts of problems you 
might expect the Nation’s top law en-
forcement officer to face head-on. 
These are the sorts of issues that 
should keep the Department of Justice 
up all night long. But, alas, Attorney 
General Garland has other priorities. 
The AG made waves this month with 
a bizarre memo that directed the FBI, 
along with DOJ’s Criminal, National 
Security, and Civil Rights Divisions, to 
focus—now listen to this—special at-
tention and security on parents—par-
ents—who have opinions about their 
local school boards. 
Yesterday, under questioning from 
the Judiciary Committee, the Attorney 
General seemed absolutely incapable of 
giving a satisfactory explanation as to 
why the parents of America are his 
A–1 priority; nor could he explain why 
this bizarre guidance came just days— 
days—after a powerful interest group 
sent a letter demanding this action. 
Actually—listen to this—the interest 
group has already apologized for the 
letter. They say they regret sending it. 
But the Attorney General won’t budge 
from his shocking guidance even after 
the special interests that asked for it 
have backed away. Apparently, the in-
stant that special interests ask the 
Biden administration to jump, the At-
torney General responds: How high? 
The Attorney General insisted that 
all his Department is concerned about 
is ‘‘violence and threats of violence.’’ 
Well, of course violence and threats are 
always wrong. They are also already il-
legal and already the purview of local 
law enforcement. 
There is no evidence that America’s 
concerned parents needed to be singled 
out as targets of this J. Edgar Hoover

act from the Feds. If Democrats at the 
local, State, and Federal levels want 
fewer 
parents—concerned 
parents— 
showing up at school board meetings, 
the solution is to stop indoctrinating 
the kids with crazy messages on the 
taxpayers’ dime, not trying to use Fed-
eral law enforcement to frighten fami-
lies out of their First Amendment 
rights. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Madam President, now on a totally 
different 
matter, 
in 
recent 
years, 
Washington Democrats have shown an 
alarming willingness to invent crises 
to justify radical ideas. They have 
tried to vilify our independent judici-
ary and exhume the concept of court- 
packing from the ash heap of history. 
They have tried to sell a 50–State Fed-
eral takeover of election laws by 
fearmongering about mainstream and 
reasonable State decisions. When it 
came to an actual crisis, a once-in-a- 
century pandemic, Democrats didn’t 
even try to conceal their intentions. As 
the House majority whip put it back in 
March of 2020, it was all ‘‘a tremendous 
opportunity to restructure things to fit 
our vision.’’ 
With unified control of government, 
they bragged this spring about passing 
the most progressive legislation in 
American history. This first spending 
spree expanded Federal supplements to 
unemployment insurance so massively 
that the best choice for huge numbers 
of skilled American workers was sim-
ply to stay home—stay home. The 
whole thing was an avalanche of cash 
that stunted our economic recovery 
and, of course, accelerated inflation. 
Now Washington Democrats are be-
hind closed doors again, assembling an 
even bigger reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree. It is meant to be a Trojan 
horse for permanent socialism—conclu-
sive proof that the radical left is call-
ing the shots in today’s Democratic 
Party. I have talked about the laundry 
list of leftwing boondoggles that our 
colleagues are packing into this plan. 
At the heart of it all is one simple and 
dangerous assumption: that American 
families ought to be more reliant on 
the Federal Government. 
Democrats’ plans would chase more 
Americans off of the private health in-
surance plans they chose and onto gov-
ernment rolls. They would shred a dec-
ades-old consensus about the impor-
tance of work and massively expand 
cash grants to families without any 
employment 
requirements—without 
any employment requirements. They 
want to reinvent welfare without wel-
fare reform. There is giveaway after 
giveaway that isn’t even means tested. 
Their plans have literally proposed to 
have taxpayers fund free school lunch 
for the kids of millionaires and billion-
aires—no means testing whatsoever. 
None. 
In addition, Washington Democrats 
want to insert themselves into the 
middle of the most personal family de-
cisions about childcare and family 
structure, redistributing huge amounts 
of money only to households that ar-
range their lives the way Democrats 
want. 
In area after area, Democrats want 
to implement far-left policies that 
would make the economy worse for 
working families and then clumsily try 
to make it up to citizens with social-
ism that is disconnected from work. 
This is a frontal assault on the nature 
of employment and work itself in 
American life. 
They are out to, as one economist 
put it, ‘‘fundamentally change the rela-
tionship between the state and its citi-
zens.’’ Even the New York Times last 
month called what Democrats are ham-
mering 
out 
‘‘a 
cradle-to-grave 
re-
weaving’’ of the government’s role. 
Lower wages. Fewer jobs. At least 
American workers will have cradle-to- 
grave socialism. 
It is one vision for the future, all 
right, but it is not one that Americans 
want, and it is one that Senate Repub-
licans will fight every step of the way. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, $28 
trillion, $9,700 per person. It is common 
for Members of this Senate to stand on 
the 
Senate 
floor 
and 
debate 
the 
pricetag of spending bills and legisla-
tion that costs millions, billions, and 
even trillions of dollars. These numbers 
are so large that for many people—per-
haps even for us—it is incomprehen-
sible and unrelatable. 
Today, I would like to take a mo-
ment to talk about dollars and cents. 
In Kansas, the current average price 
for a gallon of gas is $3.09. Last year, 
the average cost per gallon of gas in 
Kansas was $1.93. This means filling up 
a 15-gallon tank will cost you an extra 
$17 every time you fill up your car at 
the pump. If you fill up your vehicle 
once a week, that is an additional $904 
you spent on gas this year as opposed 
to just last year. 
Electricity prices are up 5.2 percent 
this year. The average monthly elec-
tric bill for a residence in Kansas last 
year was $113.52. A 5-percent increase is 
an additional $68 per family. 
This winter is going to be expensive 
for American families, particularly in 
the Midwest, as households are ex-
pected to see their heating bills jump 
as much as 54 percent compared to last 
winter, making it the most expensive 
winter since 2008. 
Thanks to inflation, the price of eggs 
is up 9.9 percent. A used car is going to 
be about 24 percent more expensive. 
Chicken has a 7.2-percent increase in 
cost, in price. 
In fact, these realities are being re-
flected by media across the country. 
Newsweek’s headline: ‘‘Your Thanks-
giving Turkey Could Be the Most Ex-
pensive Ever.’’ 
MSNBC: ‘‘Thanksgiving is now less 
than a month away and it’s shaping up 
to be the most expensive meal in the 
history of the holiday.’’ 
CBS News: ‘‘On the table for Thanks-
giving this year? Higher food prices.’’ 
NBC News: ‘‘This Thanksgiving, be 
prepared to fork over more dough for 
your feast.’’ 
And The New York Times: ‘‘This 
Year’s Thanksgiving Feast Will Wallop 
the Wallet.’’ 
This is horrible news for almost 
every Kansan and for every American, 
and it is especially damaging to those 
who are already struggling to pay the 
bills because their hard-earned dollars 
just don’t go far enough now. 
An extra $17 at the gas pump or $68 
on an electric bill and an extra 50 cents 
here or there is quickly adding up, for 
middle-class and low-income families, 
to be a major challenge. 
These dollars add up to tough deci-
sions, like: Will we be able to make our 
mortgage payment this month? Do we 
forgo a Thanksgiving meal this year so 
we can keep the heat on? Can we afford 
to make the drive across the country 
to see the grandparents for the holi-
days? 
The current trajectory for inflation 
doesn’t look good either. Treasury Sec-
retary Janet Yellen said on Sunday 
that the United States hasn’t experi-
enced the recent inflation levels in a 
‘‘long time’’ and expects higher infla-
tion to continue into 2022. 
Part of inflation—a significant por-
tion of inflation is caused by govern-
ment spending, and the Democrats’ 
out-of-control spending and policies 
have sped up the rate of inflation, cre-
ating these higher prices for families. 
In particular, President Biden’s ef-
fort to restrain American oil and gas 
production—this 
one 
is 
not 
about 
spending, but it is about policy. Presi-
dent Biden’s efforts to restrain Amer-
ican oil and gas production while, 
oddly, hypocritically, strangely, ap-
pealing to OPEC to increase the global 
oil supply in the face of high gas prices 
at home has resulted in higher energy 
prices, which could drive inflation even 
higher in the months to come. 
It is time for Congress to turn off the 
spending spigot. The Democrats’ nearly 
$2 
trillion 
spending 
package 
that 
passed at the beginning of this session, 
in January, did nothing to help with 
our labor shortage or to improve the 
supply chain. It, instead, accelerated 
inflation around the country. We have 
been slow to turn that spigot off, and 
we have exacerbated it since the ar-
rival of a Democrat majority and 
President Biden in the White House. 
The Democrats are awfully busy try-
ing to fill their campaign promises by 
passing their tax-and-spending spree, 
and they are too busy to worry about 
the damage they are causing American 
families. More spending will only exac-
erbate our current inflationary cir-
cumstances, and the path that the

Democrats have charted involves mas-
sive amounts of spending that will lead 
to higher prices for everyone. 
As Americans face higher prices at 
the gas station and grocery store, we 
must work at fixing our supply chain 
issues, returning to being energy inde-
pendent, helping Americans return to 
work, and reining in our spending to 
slow down the rate of inflation. This 
out-of-control spending is jeopardizing 
our economy and hurting Americans. 
To my colleagues—to my Democrat 
colleagues, in particular—rather than 
assuming a mandate by the voters and 
pushing the tax-and-spend spree legis-
lation with 51 votes, let’s work to-
gether. Let’s work together to get gov-
ernment spending and borrowing in 
check. If this is done, it will be done 
for the well-being of all Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, work 
continues 
on 
Democrats’ 
socialist 
spending spree, and the Senate seems 
to be on track to vote on their bill in 
the near future. Well, maybe. It de-
pends on who you ask at any given 
time around here these days. 
Just to highlight the high level of 
uncertainty surrounding this process, 
President Biden was on Capitol Hill 
just this morning—his second visit this 
month—to twist the arms of still-unde-
cided Democrats. 
As they continue to see what sticks 
to the wall, it is good to know that pri-
orities like government jobs for cli-
mate activists, tax credits for environ-
mental justice programs at colleges 
and universities, and a $200 million 
park in Speaker PELOSI’s district may 
soon come up for a vote in the Senate. 
It is just too bad that Democrats have 
been so focused on expanding govern-
ment that they haven’t actually taken 
time to do some of the essential busi-
ness of government. 
Fiscal year 2021 ended a month ago. 
We are into fiscal year 2022. Yet, so far, 
the Senate has not taken up a single 
appropriations bill for the 2022 fiscal 
year. 
On the other hand, perhaps it is not 
surprising, since the 2022 appropria-
tions bills recently introduced by the 
committee chair are rabidly partisan 
productions packed with poison pills, 
that one can only assume are designed 
to make the bills fail: the taxpayer 
funding of abortion, a measure that 
would allow Democrats to use the IRS 
for partisan purposes, policies that 
would allow certain criminal illegal 
aliens to be released into the United 
States. 
Well, we may be better off without 
these bills. 
One bill—of which there is no ques-
tion we should have taken up months 
ago, however—is the National Defense 
Authorization Act. The NDAA is one of 
the most important bills we consider 
each year. It authorizes funding for na-
tional defense priorities, like critical 
upgrades to our defense capabilities, as 
well as funding for our military men 
and women—from pay increases to pro-
tective equipment, to investments in 
Impact Aid. 
It is not a bill we can afford to ig-
nore, but under Senate Democrats, the 
bill has taken a back seat to Demo-
crats’ pet priority, and that is this 
massive, partisan tax-and-spending leg-
islation. So, while Democrats focus on 
expanding the size of government, crit-
ical military priorities are going unau-
thorized and unfunded. 
Without the National Defense Au-
thorization Act, and then the Defense 
appropriations bill that falls from it, 
the military can’t sign off on contracts 
for 
critical 
new 
equipment. 
Ship-
building projects, military infrastruc-
ture projects, the development of new 
combat systems—they are all having to 
wait while Democrats negotiate over 
their socialist spending spree. 
In my home State of South Dakota, 
Ellsworth Air Force Base is currently 
preparing to be the first home of the B– 
21 bomber, where we will host both the 
Formal Training Unit and first oper-
ational squadron. 
The B–21 bomber will eventually re-
place the Air Force’s aging B–1 fleet 
and ensure that we have a long-range 
strike asset and leg of the nuclear triad 
capable of meeting the threats of the 
21st century, wherever in the world 
they are found. 
This year’s NDAA authorizes critical 
funding for developing the B–21 and 
starting to transform Ellsworth to pre-
pare for the mission, plus a require-
ment to maintain the remaining B–1 
fleet until the bombers can be replaced 
by the B–21. 
This is just one of the many critical 
national security investments we can-
not afford to delay, but I guess our 
military men and women will just have 
to understand that Democrats’ social-
ist spending spree takes priority. 
It is not just our military men and 
women or appropriations bills that 
have had to take a back seat to the 
Democrats’ burning desire to expand 
the size of government and its reach 
into Americans’ lives. With their sin-
gle-minded focus on their tax-and- 
spending spree and, of course, on fed-
eralizing election law to give them-
selves a permanent advantage in future 
elections, real crises facing our Nation 
seem to barely register on Democrats’ 
radar. 
We are in the midst of a serious, in-
creasingly long-term inflation prob-
lem—a problem Democrats helped to 
trigger by dumping a lot of unneces-
sary government money into the econ-
omy earlier this year; yet Democrats 
are not only ignoring this crisis, they 
are preparing to make things worse by 
dumping even more government money 
into our economy. 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
Mr. President, then there is the crisis 
at the southern border. U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection encountered 
192,000 individuals attempting to cross 
our southern border in September, a 
233-percent increase from the previous 
September—233 percent. Customs and 
Border Protection apprehended more 
than 1.7 million individuals attempting 
to cross our southern border in fiscal 
year 2021—the highest number ever. 
We have a security, enforcement, and 
humanitarian crisis at our southern 
border, and there is no sign that things 
are getting any better. Yet you could 
be forgiven for wondering if Democrats 
have even noticed. 
I am pretty sure the President and 
his administration spent more time 
earlier this year fighting against the 
use of the word ‘‘crisis’’ to describe the 
situation at the border than they did 
actually thinking about how they 
might deal with the influx. The Presi-
dent’s main response to the situation 
seems to be ignoring it in hopes that it 
will go away. He is happy to travel all 
over the place, whether to a campaign 
rally in Virginia or a climate change 
summit overseas, but he can’t seem to 
find a minute to visit the southern bor-
der. 
The border crisis is not the only cri-
sis the President is ignoring. The 
President’s 
disastrous 
Afghanistan 
withdrawal was a real low point for 
this country. Thirteen of our military 
men and women died in the terrorist 
attack. We abandoned thousands of in-
dividuals who had worked with us in 
Afghanistan and whom we had prom-
ised to protect, not to mention hun-
dreds of Americans still working to 
find a way home. The President, who 
was supposed to restore our standing 
on the world stage, left our allies won-
dering if our word can be relied upon. 
Most of all, the disastrous with-
drawal has left our country in a much 
more precarious national security posi-
tion. Afghanistan is ripe to once again 
become a terrorist haven. Just this 
week, a Pentagon official testified that 
ISIS-K, the ISIS Afghanistan affiliate, 
could be ready to launch terrorist at-
tacks on our homeland in as little as 6 
months—6 months. Al-Qaida, which 
looks set to once again find a safe 
haven in Afghanistan, could be ready 
to launch attacks in a year. 
Yet, once again, this barely seems to 
register on the Biden administration’s 
radar. We still have no agreements 
with neighboring countries to establish 
or make use of bases to launch coun-
terterrorism operations in Afghani-
stan. The administration is apparently

working on the situation. Well, quite 
frankly, this is something the adminis-
tration should have figured out be-
fore—before—withdrawing our troops 
from Afghanistan and destroying our 
ability to conduct counterterrorism op-
erations within the country. Unfortu-
nately, the President was more focused 
on meeting his predetermined, arbi-
trary deadline than on dealing with the 
actual situation on the ground, with 
predictably catastrophic consequences. 
A lot of priorities have had to take a 
back seat to Democrats’ tax-and-spend-
ing spree. I only wish the bill were 
worth it. Unfortunately, Democrats’ 
massive spending bill is likely to wors-
en our inflation crisis, weaken our 
economy, and increase government in-
trusion into Americans’ lives. Mean-
while, I guess our border crisis and na-
tional security priorities will have to 
continue to wait until Democrats find 
the time to address them. I am not 
holding my breath.

S7441 
October 28, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2851 
Mr. 
LEE. 
Mr. 
President, 
earlier 
today, President Biden announced his 
new, revised, supposedly curtailed, so-
cial spending plan for America. It 
seems that the depressing economic 
numbers, the soaring costs of goods, 
mounting data that government spend-
ing is to blame, or perhaps some more 
moderate voices within the Democratic 
conference forced him to walk this lat-
est monstrosity back. 
Democrats, who won control with the 
slimmest of majorities, feel that they 
have a mandate to change more about 
American society and spend more 
money than any group of elected offi-
cials in American history. 
The White House Chief of Staff 
tweeted today, bragging that this deal 
is still twice as big as the New Deal in 
real dollars. 
Be it at $3.5 trillion or a little less, 
we have lost almost all sense of what 
money means, at least when it comes 
to money being spent by Washington— 
by public officials who congratulate 
themselves, each other, and, in return, 
are congratulated by many in the 
media 
for 
spending 
other 
people’s 
money or spending money we don’t 
have, money that ends up, effectively, 
being printed. 
Our Founding Fathers entrusted Con-
gress with the power of the purse be-
cause they expected Congress, which is 
the branch of government most ac-
countable to the people at the most 
regular intervals, to be most likely to 
jealously guard the funds of those who 
sent us here. 
Understanding that as every Member 
of the House is required to stand for 
election every 2 years, and one-third of 
the Members of this body are required 
to stand for election every 2 years, that 
ought to have an effect. It ought to 
have precisely the effect that we re-
member: that it is not our money; it is 
the people’s money, and that when we 
run out of it, we can’t just pretend that 
we have more. When you do that, it 
causes problems—especially for the 
poor and the middle class. 
The Framers assumed that Congress 
would be the most responsible branch 
in managing our Nation’s finances— 
again, because we are the branch most 
accountable to the people. But in this 
respect we failed. We failed in every 
sense. We failed dismally, miserably. 
Americans work for months out of 
every single year just to pay their Fed-
eral taxes. Yet our Nation is still bar-
reling toward $30 trillion of national 
debt. We are now reaching devastating 
debt-to-GDP ratios that we have never 
contemplated 
during 
peacetime 
in 
America. And Americans are feeling 
the pain—real Americans, everyday 
Americans. 
Inflation is at its highest rate in dec-
ades. Everything from gas to groceries, 
from housing to healthcare—it is all 
more expensive and getting more ex-
pensive every single day. We know 
from sad experience that this isn’t 
going to go away anytime soon. Prices, 
once they go up, tend to stick. 
Meanwhile, President Biden, appar-
ently, is not satisfied with only mak-
ing things more expensive, but he is 
also making it harder and in some 
cases impossible for many Americans 
to work. His still-unpublished vaccine 
mandate is causing millions of Ameri-
cans to be at risk of losing their em-
ployment or, alternatively, acquiescing 
to Federal medical extortion. These 
are everyday Americans, all too often 
struggling just to get by. They are not 
bad people. They are not people whom 
we should shun. No. These are mothers 
and fathers. Some are first responders, 
and others are military heroes. They 
are our neighbors, friends, and fellow 
citizens. They deserve the respect and 
autonomy to make this decision for 
themselves. 
And the Constitution, when properly 
followed, protects Americans from pre-
cisely this type of Federal intrusion, 
especially this type of Federal intru-
sion wielded by one man, one person, in 
one office. 
I have heard now from over 300 Utah-
ans just in the last few weeks who are 
at risk of losing their livelihoods due 
to the President’s mandate. These are 
just the ones I have heard from. For 
every one I have heard from, there are 
many, many others who are being af-
fected. Their stories are moving, and 
they are as moving as they are tragic. 
And we must do something to help. 
Allow me to be very clear. While I am 
very much against the mandate, I am 
for the vaccine. I have been vaccinated. 
My entire family has been vaccinated. 
I have encouraged other people to get 
vaccinated. These vaccines are helping 
to protect many, many millions of 
Americans against the harmful effects 
of COVID–19. 
That does not, however, excuse the 
heavy-handed, nanny state approach of 
forcing this decision on Americans, of 
threatening Americans, coercing them, 
extorting them into doing the will of 
the President of the United States. 
This is not only an action not backed 
up by law or consistent with the con-
stitutional separation of powers, but it 
is immoral. And it is mean to tell a 
mom or a dad you are not going to be 
able to put food on the table for your 
children if you don’t get a medical pro-
cedure that we want you to get but 
that you don’t want to get, for what-
ever reason: a religious reason, a par-
ticular medical condition that you 
have been warned about from your doc-
tor, or whatever else it may be. People 
shouldn’t have to choose between the 
ability to make a living and the co-
erced receipt of an unwanted medical 
procedure. 
This is why I have come to the Sen-
ate floor 11 times now to fight against 
the mandate and why I am going to 
keep coming. Today, I am offering 
what 
should 
be 
an 
incredibly 
uncontroversial bill. My Transparency 
in COVID–19 Expenditures Act, which 
is cosponsored by Senators BRAUN, 
LUMMIS, SULLIVAN, and TUBERVILLE, 
would simply require an audit of 
COVID–19 relief funding. It would allow 
Congress to determine what spending 
in this pandemic worked and what 
spending did not. It would help us re-
turn a little bit of financial oversight 
and sanity and responsibility and ac-
countability to Congress and to our 
government. 
This information would also allow 
taxpayers to see how their dollars are 
being spent and whether they are being 
spent wisely. It is that simple. And I 
encourage my colleagues to support 
the bill. 
I would like now to yield time to my 
friend and distinguished colleague, the 
Senator from Wyoming. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, I thank 
the gentleman from Utah. 
I wish to address the subject of the 
President’s overreaching vaccine man-
dates. First, we all recognize the devas-
tation caused by the COVID–19 pan-
demic 
spread 
from 
Wuhan, 
China, 
throughout the world. This virus has 
taken too many lives: more than 4.7 
million around the globe and over 
686,000 here in the United States. Each 
death is a tragedy. My heart goes out 
to the families who have lost loved 
ones and suffered from this terrible dis-
ease. 
Many of those families in Wyoming 
have reached out to me. I have heard 
from thousands of constituents con-
cerned about the vaccine, pro and con, 
but mostly about confusing guidance 
and particularly about masking—most 
notably in our schools. 
Our response to this pandemic should 
have been unifying, but, instead, it has 
sown discord and distrust across our 
country, and that discord is exacer-
bated by the Federal Government’s ex-
treme overreach. 
I want to be clear. I support individ-
uals getting the COVID vaccine. I am 
vaccinated. I got vaccinated to protect 
myself because I have no natural im-
munity. I haven’t had COVID. I have no 
underlying health concerns. I was not 
advised by a physician not to get it. It 
made sense for me making that deci-
sion for myself. 
Scientists have been researching and 
working for decades to make the emer-
gency treatments that we have all had 
access to in 2021 available to us. How-
ever, I do not support the government 
mandating—mandating—matters 
that 
come between a patient and their con-
science, a patient and their healthcare 
provider, a patient and their own care 
decisions. 
And the recent mandates from the 
Biden administration do just that. I be-
lieve they are far-reaching and burden-
some, as do my constituents, including 
those who have been vaccinated. They 
will not achieve the desired result. 
They will not convince millions of 
Americans on the fence about the vac-
cine to suddenly get it. They cause peo-
ple to dig in. They further politicize

our healthcare system. They compound 
our unemployment problems. 
Don’t take my word for it. Look at 
the Federal Government itself. Even 
unions are opposed to a vaccine man-
date, with the American Postal Work-
ers Union, the Federal Law Enforce-
ment Officers Association, and the 
American Federation of Teachers com-
ing out in opposition not to the vaccine 
but to the mandate. 
The pandemic does not make the 
Constitution irrelevant or put our 
rights as private citizens up for discus-
sion. We are a nation of liberties, not 
mandates. We respect individuals. 
That is why I am cosponsoring sev-
eral different bills that would protect 
our citizens from this overreach. One 
bill, S. 2849, clarifies that Federal 
Agencies do not have the power to 
mandate COVID–19 vaccines. While this 
should be self-evident, sadly, many in 
Washington, DC, have forgotten about 
America’s founding principles. 
Another bill, S. 2843, blocks Federal 
Agencies from fining anyone who vio-
lates the COVID–19 mandates. 
Further, the bill that Senator LEE is 
offering today, S. 2851, audits COVID 
funding so the American people know 
where their tax dollars went over the 
past year and a half, so we can evalu-
ate what has worked and what has not, 
as Senator LEE has said. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
should 
work to bring us together, not drive us 
further apart through politicized Exec-
utive actions. No matter what Presi-
dent Biden decides to do, an individ-
ual’s right to be in charge of their own 
healthcare is sacrosanct, and I believe 
Senator LEE’s bills are a step in the 
right direction. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, as if in legis-
lative session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs Committee be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 2851 and that the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration. I further 
ask that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I re-
serve the right to object. I certainly 
welcome the Senator from Utah’s in-
terest 
in 
oversight 
of 
coronavirus 
emergency relief funds. There is no 
question Americans deserve to know 
where their hard-earned tax dollars are 
going and how these critical relief 
funds are being used to help commu-
nities all across our country in the 
wake of this public health crisis, espe-
cially for those who need it the most. 
I am also thankful that my colleague 
agreed with the importance of con-
ducting thorough oversight of these 
programs and supported the creation of 
the Pandemic Response Accountability 
Committee when we passed the CARES 
Act. These oversight requirements, 
based 
on 
the 
successful 
oversight 
model of the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act, ensure that we have 
strong oversight of all coronavirus re-
lief dollars through regular, detailed 
reports and recommendations from the 
PRAC, the GAO, and the inspector gen-
eral. 
Following guidance from the Office 
of Management and Budget, all COVID– 
19 relief funding from the legislation 
that the Senator has identified is al-
ready 
being 
tracked 
on 
USASpending.gov. 
Anyone—anyone— 
can go to the website right now and see 
the figures. 
As of August 31, Congress has pro-
vided $4.7 trillion in relief spending. 
The administration has committed $3.9 
trillion of those funds to helping com-
munities, and $3.4 trillion in assistance 
has already reached those who need 
help through this crisis. 
I would also urge the Senator to con-
sult the more than 1,300 oversight re-
ports that the PRAC has already com-
pleted related to the pandemic re-
sponse, in addition to the more than 
100 reports that the GAO has also 
issued on this topic, rather than cre-
ating additional and redundant work 
for the GAO at taxpayer expense. 
The Senator’s proposal is duplicative 
and unnecessary, and for that reason I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
the insight from my friend, colleague, 
and distinguished Senator from Michi-
gan. I appreciate his willingness to 
look out for making sure that there 
isn’t duplication in government. 
I also think it is important that at a 
time when we are spending an unprece-
dented amount of money, that we are 
on the side of redoubling efforts to 
audit, to oversee. 
There has never been a time in Amer-
ican history when we have brought in 
more money than we have brought in 
in the year 2020. We brought in over $3 
trillion. But there has never been a 
time when we have spent nearly as 
much money in total dollars or as far 
as a number of dollars relative to what 
we brought in. 
I mean, we spent $6.6 trillion last 
year. This is an enormous amount of 
money. We are spending a comparable 
amount again this year—again, tril-
lions of dollars more than we are bring-
ing in. We are doing it ostensibly be-
cause of the COVID pandemic. And for 
that reason, it is good that we make 
sure that we know where we are spend-
ing that money, where it is going. If it 
can make our efforts more effective 
and more efficient, if this is about pro-
tecting and sustaining life, then why 
wouldn’t we want to make sure that it 
is being done in the most effective, effi-
cient way possible? 
We work for the people. They deserve 
to know where the money is being 
spent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today in support of 
our men and women in uniform who 
put their lives on the line each day to 
defend our freedoms and our American 
way of life. 
Unfortunately, thousands of our he-
roes are about to lose those very free-
doms that they have fought so hard to 
defend, as Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate 
is threatening them with a dishonor-
able discharge should they choose not 
to get the COVID vaccine. 
Now, let me be clear, as a physician 
and a veteran, I am confident the vac-
cine has saved countless lives, and I en-
courage every veteran, every American 
to consider and to discuss with their 
physician getting that vaccine. I be-
lieve vaccinating our servicemembers, 
though, against COVID–19 is such a 
very, very important effort. But deep 
down inside, I am still this real doctor 
from Great Bend, KS, and I believe in 
the sanctity of the physician-patient 
relationship and that every one of our 
situations is unique. 
A soldier’s clinical history is unique. 
There are pros and cons; there are risks 
and benefits of taking this vaccine. 
And each of our soldiers all are using 
common sense—the common sense that 
God has given them, and I respect their 
decisions. This administration should 
too. 
Right now, thousands of our service-
members are not vaccinated. When it 
comes to our guardsmen and -women in 
Kansas, only 58 percent are fully or 
partially vaccinated—a number I am 
confident would hold true across the 
remainder of the country. 
Unfortunately, the policy out of the 
White House says that one size has to 
fit all; that there is no exception, even 
though we know that natural immu-
nity to COVID is the same as, if not 
more powerful than, the vaccine. 
We have never asked people—espe-
cially military folks—to get a vaccine 
for a virus they are already immune to 
or a virus that doesn’t affect them. It 
just doesn’t make sense. 
Because of Joe Biden’s vaccine man-
date, thousands of American heroes are 
going to be separated from the service, 
and they are going to, perhaps, be 
given a dishonorable discharge. 
I want to make sure this body and 
the American people understand ex-
actly what the significance of a dishon-
orable discharge is. Soldiers will lose 
access to medical benefits from the 
VA. They will lose access to home 
loans from the VA. They will lose ac-
cess to the GI bill for further edu-
cation. They will potentially lose their 
right to vote in some States. They will 
lose their Second Amendment rights 
and access to ammunition. They will 
lose military funeral honors. They will 
lose the ability to reenlist in another 
branch of military. And they will have 
an extremely difficult time finding em-
ployment.

S7443 
October 28, 2021 
Getting 
a 
dishonorable 
discharge 
may be the worst checkmark you can 
get in your life—truly, a scarlet letter. 
These sort of repercussions sound like 
they should be reserved for felons. But, 
no, this is what Joe Biden wants to 
hand down to our servicemembers. This 
is insulting, and we must put a stop to 
it. 
For these reasons, I introduced legis-
lation—the COVID–19 Vaccine Dishon-
orable Discharge Prevention Act—to 
prohibit the Department of Defense 
from dishonorably discharging Amer-
ican heroes who choose to not receive a 
COVID–19 vaccine. 
There is no question about it: Amer-
ican heroes should not be treated as 
felons because of their personal med-
ical choices. 
This is one of a number of highly im-
portant issues for our national security 
that Leader SCHUMER
and our col-
leagues across the aisle have to put on 
hold while they go back and forth on 
how to spend taxpayers’ money on 
their radical agenda instead of final-
izing the NDAA. 
The annual defense bill is the only 
authorizing legislation that Congress 
passes every year—60 years in a row, as 
a matter of fact—but this now is the 
fourth latest in history that it has been 
initially brought up for consideration 
on the Senate floor. 
Considering the foreign policy disas-
ters this White House has created, one 
would think delivering a paycheck to 
our servicemembers and funding to in-
crease our military’s lethality would 
be top of mind. 
Our troops deserve better, and I am 
calling on Leader SCHUMER to bring the 
NDAA to the floor. Our American he-
roes deserve better than this, and we 
need to get to my amendment as soon 
as possible. 
I want to thank Senators CRUZ, 
LANKFORD, TUBERVILLE, CRAMER, JOHN-
SON, Senators RICK SCOTT, KENNEDY, 
and Senator WICKER for joining me in 
this important legislation. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with them once we submit it as an 
amendment to the NDAA. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, American 
families are hurting, and there is no re-
lief in sight. We are facing sky-
rocketing inflation, and families are 
feeling it every time they go to the 
grocery store. 
We are facing a supply chain crisis 
that threatens to deny families the 
food and goods that they need. We are 
facing a surging energy crisis that is 
literally burning holes in the wallets of 
hard-working Americans. 
Just this week, I drove up from Char-
lotte and I was amazed at how much 
more it took me to refuel my truck 
about halfway up from Charlotte to 
DC. 
This has gotten so bad that some 
families 
are 
really 
beginning 
to 
rethink their travel plans as we ap-
proach the holidays. We are facing a 
labor shortage crisis, with small busi-
nesses and farms across the country 
struggling to fill jobs. Even as they 
raise the potential salaries, the people 
are simply not coming. 
President Biden and his allies in Con-
gress have chosen some interesting 
ways to respond to these crises. In 
some cases, they have just ignored 
them. They have been making excuses 
for others, and they have been making 
a case that everything will be fine if we 
just have more government, more 
spending, and more taxes. 
That is why, for months, President 
Biden and congressional Democrats 
have put all their time and energy into 
crafting a completely partisan $3.5 tril-
lion tax-and-spending spree. They are 
spending on leftwing priorities that 
will result in more debt, more infla-
tion, more dependency government, 
and more government intrusion into 
the lives of all Americans. 
Equally concerning is how the Demo-
crats want to pay for some of their out- 
of-control spending. They plan to take 
$400 billion from taxpayers by moni-
toring and auditing their bank ac-
counts. 
Democrats want to turn your bank or 
your credit union—that small bank 
around the corner in some rural com-
munity across America—into a branch 
of the IRS, making them monitor and 
report your financial activity and di-
rectly report to it the IRS. 
To make matters worse, the Demo-
crats want to hire 80,000 new IRS 
agents so they can go through your 
personal financial information—what 
you spend your money on and what in-
come you take in. And using that in-
formation, the IRS will then try to 
squeeze out any additional money that 
they can from you. 
The Democrats originally proposed 
making the threshold of the IRS re-
porting at a $600 transaction. Ameri-
cans who heard about the scheme were 
outraged. 
Most Americans aren’t too fond of 
the IRS. I dare say, if you were to do a 
poll of the 10 most favorite government 
agencies, the IRS wouldn’t make the 
list. And they certainly don’t trust the 
IRS with having more power and more 
of your personal financial information. 
My office alone has received over 
15,000 emails opposing this overreach. I 
imagine many of my Democratic col-
leagues have heard from their constitu-
ents as well, so it is not surprising they 
went back to the drawing board. Since 
the $600 transaction wasn’t selling, 
they came up with a new proposal, and 
it was a total of $10,000 in transactions 
that would trigger an IRS reporting re-
quirement. 
But you can’t be fooled by this 
sleight of hand. It will subject nearly 
every American with a job to the same 
IRS scheme. Consider that the average 
American makes a little bit more than 
$60,000 in annual expenditures, yet 
Democrats have the audacity to claim 
that this plan is really just targeted to 
the wealthy. 
I don’t know many hairdressers and 
plumbers and painters or Uber drivers 
who are billionaires, but I do know 
that they make over $10,000 a year and 
they will be subject to the same 
scheme because of the way they make 
their income. 
Now, these hard-working Americans, 
who have done nothing wrong, could 
have their personal information sent 
directly to the IRS. 
And let’s be clear, this additional in-
formation won’t even provide the IRS 
with direct evidence of tax noncompli-
ance. Instead, it would give the IRS— 
and keep in mind, 80,000 more IRS em-
ployees; roughly twice, doubling the 
number of people working in the IRS— 
to go on a taxpayer-funded fishing in-
vestigation 
designed 
to 
rummage 
through individual Americans’ finances 
in the hope of finding noncompliance. 
We don’t let police enter someone’s 
house without a warrant in the hopes 
they can find something illegal, and we 
certainly should not provide this kind 
of power to the IRS. 
And what will happen when a hard- 
working hairdresser or plumber or car-
penter, who is already struggling to 
make ends meet, gets a letter from the 
IRS alleging that they owe more taxes? 
They don’t have an army of tax law-
yers and accountants like billionaires 
do. They will have to try and take on 
the IRS themselves, and that is a los-
ing proposition. 
The IRS reporting plan is not about 
catching tax cheats and making sure 
billionaires are paying their taxes. It is 
about 
shaking 
down 
middle-class 
Americans to pay for the Democrats’ 
tax-and-spending spree, plain and sim-
ple, burning them with more bureauc-
racy and giving them yet another thing 
they have to worry about, in addition 
to rising inflation, energy prices, and 
supply chain shortages. 
I was talking with one of my staff 
this week about my own personal situ-
ation and what I think happens every 
day in this country. You have some-
body who is struggling to pay their 
bills. I had a family member many 
years ago who came to me and said 
they needed—if I would give them a 
loan so that they could make ends 
meet. They worked in construction and 
they had a project coming due, but 
they had a cash-flow problem. So I 
made them a loan, like so many people 
do for their friends and family mem-
bers. Well, depending upon the size of 
that gesture, it could suddenly be a re-
portable transaction to the IRS. 
What is an IRS compliance agent 
going to do? 
They are going to call you up and 
say: Well, you didn’t report that as in-
come. 
And then the person is going to say: 
Well, it was a loan. 
And then the IRS agent is going to 
say: Well, where was the document? 
And so: It was with a brother or an 
uncle or a cousin. We shook hands, and 
I promised to pay him back.

Those are the kinds of things that 
are going to happen if this IRS tax 
transaction reporting goes into place. 
That is why I recently joined with Sen-
ator TIM SCOTT and dozens of my Re-
publican colleagues to introduce legis-
lation that will prevent the Biden ad-
ministration and the IRS from imple-
menting their surveillance plan. It is 
wrong. It is an overreach, and it is not 
going to work. 
But the easiest solution is for my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
to simply drop this misguided IRS re-
porting scheme. 
Tax-and-spend policies have already 
made 
life 
harder 
for 
middle-class 
Americans. Americans are struggling 
from the impact of COVID, from the 
impact of inflation, from energy short-
ages, and so many uncertainties that 
we have experienced over the past cou-
ple of years. The last thing they need is 
to have the IRS, with an army of tens 
of thousands IRS agents, prying into 
their bank accounts and causing more 
confusion, more frustration, and more 
heartache at the worst possible time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor this afternoon to talk 
about the affordable housing crisis in 
the USA. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have this letter printed in the 
RECORD. It is from 44 different mayors 
representing 20 different States and the 
District of Columbia, talking about 
those housing priorities that we need 
to see in legislation that we will be 
voting on, including, No. 1, strength-
ening and expanding the low-income 
housing tax credit. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
October 23, 2021. 
Hon. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., 
President of the United States of America, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. CHARLES SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
MR. PRESIDENT, LEADER
SCHUMER 
AND
SPEAKER
PELOSI: As 44 mayors rep-
resenting communities across 20 states and 
the District of Columbia, we are writing to 
urge you to include our top housing prior-
ities in any infrastructure investment. Dur-
ing this time of uncertainty and financial in-
stability, the need to ensure all Americans 
can access safe, affordable housing is greater 
than ever. Housing investments are critical 
to the recovery of our cities and a top pri-
ority for our residents. We respectfully re-
quest that you prioritize them in the Build 
Back Better package, specifically: 
1. Strengthen and Expand the Low-Income 
Housing Tax Credit (Housing Credit). The 
Housing Credit is our nation’s primary tool 
for creating and preserving affordable hous-
ing and a critical building block to achieve 
multiple goals from the Build Back Better 
agenda—stabilizing families, climate resil-
iency, better physical and mental health 
outcomes, child development, and racial jus-
tice and economic opportunity. Further, 
Congress must act to increase Housing Cred-
it authority this year or we will see a cut to 
production with the expiration of the tem-
porary volume cap increase implemented in 
2018, which will happen at the end of this 
year. States are also increasingly becoming 
bond-cap constrained and lowering the 50 
percent bond-financing test would result in 
immediate production for those commu-
nities. In all, the production provisions pro-
posed by the House would create an addi-
tional 1.4 million homes for 3.2 million peo-
ple and generate 2 million jobs. 
2. Include Robust Funding for the HOME 
Investment Partnerships (HOME) and Com-
munity Development Block Grant (CDBG) 
Programs. HOME and CDBG are proven tools 
in helping states and communities address 
their most pressing housing challenges, pro-
viding states and localities with the nec-
essary flexibility and resources. Currently, 
Build Back Better includes $34.77 billion for 
HOME—which estimates predict could help 
state and local governments develop nearly 
107,000 new affordable housing units, while 
also providing tenant-based rental assistance 
to over 300,000 low-income families—and $8.5 
billion for CDBG. HOME and CDBG are 
smart investments that leverage billions 
more in public and private dollars and 
jumpstart the economy. In fact, HOME 
leverages more than $4.50 in public and pri-
vate funds for every dollar of HOME funding 
and has supported roughly 1.9 million jobs 
and generated $123.6 billion in local income, 
according to the HOME Coalition’s most re-
cent analysis. Likewise, every dollar of 
CDBG leverages $4.09 in public and private 
sources and has benefited 51.5 million per-
sons through infrastructure improvements 
and another 1.6 million households through 
housing investments. Investment in these 
critical programs would mean better infra-
structure, more jobs, increased access to key 
services, and additional units of affordable 
housing. 
3. Provide Housing Stability for Families 
by Investing in Housing Choice Vouchers 
(HCV) and Project-Based Rental Assistance 
(PBRA). We strongly support the $90 billion 
housing investment in HCVs and PBRA 
passed by the House Financial Services Com-
mittee in recognition of the critical impor-
tance of investing in decent, accessible af-
fordable housing for those with the greatest 
needs—people experiencing homelessness and 
people with the lowest incomes. Taken to-
gether, transformative investments in HCVs 
and PBRA would mark the beginning of the 
elimination of homelessness once and for all. 
It would also provide a level of housing resil-
ience that would enable renters to weather 
the next recession, pandemic, or disaster. 
Our country cannot address poverty with-
out also addressing our homelessness and 
housing crisis, and the investments in this 
bill to support families and build back our 
infrastructure will be diminished if families 
cannot afford a place to call home. 
With a bold investment in housing, the fed-
eral government can effectively end housing 
instability in our country. The federal gov-
ernment has the opportunity to make that 
aspiration a reality. 
Thank you for your time and leadership.

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor because many of my 
colleagues—29 have joined a bill that 
myself and Senator YOUNG sponsored, 
and, I think, 132 Members in the House 
of Representatives joined, all saying we 
need to incent more affordable housing. 
Why do we need to incent more af-
fordable housing? 
If you don’t incent it with the tax 
credit, people won’t build it, particu-
larly in a place like Seattle, where you 
can build other things and get a whole 
lot more money. 
We need a workforce and we need the 
workforce to be in Seattle. We don’t 
need them to be four counties away 
and drive in every day and clog our 
roads with added traffic that didn’t 
need to be there. We need to build peo-
ple close to their homes and need the 
flexibility of the affordable housing tax 
credit, which has been, in my mind, 
very helpful in being very specific in 
every community. 
You can build affordable housing just 
for returning veterans. You can build 
affordable housing for workforce needs. 
You can build affordable housing just 
to house previously homeless people. 
You can build affordable housing to 
take students who are still going to 
school and don’t have a place to live, 
making them have affordable opportu-
nities. 
The affordable housing tax credit is 
the primary tool with which we build 
housing. Let me say, 90 percent of the 
affordable housing that gets built in 
the USA gets built with the tax credit. 
That is right. Ninety percent of the af-
fordable housing that gets built in the 
United States with the tax credit is 
built with—90 percent of affordable 
housing gets built with the tax credit. 
That means even if we have other 
programs in the legislation that we 
have been talking about between the 
House and the Senate—like the home 
grant program or vouchers or things of 
that nature—if you don’t use this as-
pect of the program, you are not going

to be able to build that housing, so it 
has been incredibly popular. 
That is why we have to increase the 
amount of capital we are going to put 
towards the tax incentive. The reason 
why we have to do that is that the 
United States has a supply shortage. 
You can ask: Why did we get to this 
supply shortage? 
If you ask me, it was really accen-
tuated in the downturn of 2008, when so 
many more individuals fell out of the 
job market, creating more demand for 
affordable housing at that price point. 
We also, at that point, had a lot of re-
turning veterans, and we had really 
some very big changes in the diver-
sification of our economy. We had a lot 
of mental health that had been dein-
stitutionalized and pushed in a dif-
ferent direction. And we had changes in 
policy as we saw the challenges of an 
aging population, really, living a lot 
longer than people anticipated and 
they are also needing housing. 
We had all these issues combined to 
this dramatic effect of 6.8 million af-
fordable 
housing 
shortage 
in 
the 
United States of America. That is the 
amount of units that we actually have 
to build. 
I wish I could say these problems go 
away if you just don’t—if you say: 
Well, if they don’t build the housing, it 
will just take care of itself. 
No, it doesn’t take care of itself. If 
these people end up being homeless, it 
costs 30 percent more to deal with 
them in our hospitals and in jails. In 
various places, the people who are 
truly homeless and living on the 
streets are extra costs. 
We actually had hospitals support 
building affordable housing just so peo-
ple wouldn’t be in their emergency 
room every day. That is how much it 
was worth to hospitals to have afford-
able housing. 
So the crisis, as we know in America, 
is that there are now 10.5 million 
Americans who pay more than 50 per-
cent of their income in rent. That 
means they are rent-burdened. This 
number has just continued to go up in 
the charts for years in growth and, ba-
sically, continued to exacerbate the 
problem. Why? Because people will tell 
you, you can’t spend 50 percent of your 
income in rent. 
These dynamics are what is plaguing 
us in the United States; and it is a 
problem that, until we increase the af-
fordable housing tax credit, you are 
not going to get the relief that you 
think you can get out of this situation. 
Our legislation—myself and Senator 
YOUNG’s legislation—would have in-
creased the tax credit by 50 percent 
over a 10-year period of time. That 
would have helped us build a million 
more units of affordable housing and 
try to address this problem in the near 
term. 
I hope our colleagues will—as we 
work through both the proposals that 
have been part of our infrastructure 
bill and the reconciliation act—will 
look and see that we need to include 
the low-income housing tax credit as 
part of that proposal. If we don’t have 
the affordable housing tax credit as 
part of that proposal, we are not going 
to have the robust solutions that we 
need. 
While I understand there are very ge-
ographic differences across the United 
States—the East Coast may have some 
particular aspects that will be very 
benefited, and the West Coast has other 
aspects that would benefit—we all can 
benefit from the low-income housing 
tax program. That is what is so unique 
about it. 
Every State has used it with great 
flexibility. Every State has used it to 
solve their problems, and the incen-
tives have helped us stimulate the 
economy. It is literally worth billions 
of dollars of economic activity, and 
that is why we also should be making 
this investment. 
Many times when our country has 
faced a downturn in the sixties or sev-
enties or eighties, you would hear a 
shout-out for housing. People would 
say: Let’s build housing. 
Well, you haven’t heard that shout- 
out in the last decade or so. You lit-
erally haven’t for a bunch of different 
reasons. No one has been trumpeting: 
We need more housing. 
I tell you, Mr. President, we need 
more affordable housing for those indi-
viduals. And I have met so many in my 
State whose lives have been changed— 
literally changed. 
A woman basically got out of an abu-
sive relationship and moved in with her 
father in Walla Walla, but knew it 
wasn’t sustainable. She lived in Bill-
ingham. Basically, the affordable hous-
ing program in Walla Walla got her and 
her son into a home. She started 
school. She got a job, changed her life. 
I have seen it recently in Spokane. 
Take a couple who basically had be-
come homeless. They separated. They 
had children that couldn’t all live to-
gether. They brought them back to-
gether under one roof. And in this par-
ticular housing project, the promise 
was made by the partners that every-
body in that particular housing would 
get access not only to help them get a 
high school education, but a college 
education as well. 
That is what you can do with these 
projects. You can tailor-make them 
with community partners to address 
the needs of your specific community. 
So this tax credit is bipartisan. It 
worked successfully. I would say it is 
one of the most successful programs 
that we had in the United States for 
getting affordable housing. Let’s not 
leave it off the table. Let’s put it in 
this legislation and make sure it gets 
to the goal line of the President’s desk 
and is signed into law.

many years of public service to her 
State and country. 
And, in deference to this nice occa-
sion, I would ask we all stay in the 
Chamber and vote quickly so we can 
leave. I know that is a passion for Sen-
ator COLLINS. 
Seriously, we should all try to stay 
in the Chamber and get this done fast. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
January 22, 1997, Senator COLLINS cast 
her first rollcall vote for Madeleine 
Albright to be Secretary of State. 
From that moment on, she has not 
missed one single, solitary vote; zero 
sick days, zero scheduling conflicts. 
Whether we were voting on war or 
peace, historic legislation, or the most 
routine and uncontroversial bills and 
nominations, the Senator has made 
sure that Maine got its say every sin-
gle time. 
So here is some perspective. The 
longest consecutive games streak in 
Major League Baseball famously be-
longed to Cal Ripken, Jr. Well, our col-
league from Caribou has lapped him 
three times and counting. And, by the 
way, the Iron Horse didn’t have to plan 
around weekly air travel in and out of 
New England, all winter, every winter. 
Anybody who knows Senator COLLINS 
knows this moment is not really about 
a round number; it is about the ap-
proach which the number happens to 
reflect. Our colleague is diligent. She is 
devoted. Her level of preparation is un-
paralleled. She holds herself to the 
highest standards, and she delivers. 
It is in her blood. Both of our col-
league’s parents served separate terms 
as mayor of Caribou. But the Senator 
also draws inspiration from outside the 
gene pool. She rightly idolizes her 
predecessor from Maine, the legendary 
Margaret Chase Smith, but even Sen-
ator Smith’s own impressive voting 
streak topped out just shy of 3,000. 
I am just sorry that today’s mile-
stone moment couldn’t present our col-
league with a challenge worthy of her 
skills. Lucky number 8,000 didn’t even 
require a sprained ankle or a hasty exit 
from a departing airplane. 
So congratulations to our colleague 
on this moment and all that it rep-
resents. 
Ms. COLLINS. Thank you. Thank 
you very much. Thank you. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in 
just a few minutes, we are going to 
take another vote here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. It is just an ordinary vote for most 
of us, unless you are SUSAN COLLINS be-
cause this next vote we are going to 
take in the Senate will be SUSAN COL-
LINS’ 8,000th consecutive vote. That is 
right. The leader described it, she is 
the Cal Ripken of the U.S. Senate. He 
played 2,632 consecutive games, and 
SUSAN COLLINS has been showing up 
every day for work and bringing her A 
game, literally, since January of 1997. 
It is an extraordinary number. But 
what it represents is what really mat-
ters, and that is SUSAN’s work ethic, 
her tenacity, and her unshakable com-
mitment to the people of Maine. If 
there is one thing that the people of 
Maine can depend on, it is that SUSAN 
COLLINS
will be there to represent 
them, not just on the big days or for 
the big votes but every day on every 
single vote. 
I am also proud to stand up today 
and to recognize SUSAN. 
SUSAN, congratulations on this in-
credible milestone. You truly are the 
workhorse of the U.S. Senate. Here is 
to the next 8,000. 
(Applause.) 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
would just say to Senator COLLINS: You 
are my colleague and my friend. If they 
write the history of this place, they 
might make a footnote that we had a 
book club—a little one—between us. 
We exchanged a lot of books over the 
years. I thank you for your friendship 
and kindness, all the way through, and 
congratulations on this milestone.

f 
TRIBUTE TO JIM SCHMIDT 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
Thursday afternoon, and it is one of 
my favorite times in the Senate be-
cause it is the time I have the oppor-
tunity to come down on the Senate 
floor to talk about an Alaskan who is 
making a difference in their commu-
nity or the State or maybe the coun-
try, you know, sometimes maybe the 
world. And I think we have one today. 
This is an individual we call our Alas-
kan of the Week. 
I really enjoy doing this. It is just 
really a good opportunity to recognize 
people who often don’t get a lot of rec-
ognition. 
You know, Alaska is known through-
out the world for many things: our 
physical beauty, the size of our State, 
giant mountains, great fishing, great 
place to take a vacation. By the way, if 
you are watching at home, come on up 
to Alaska. We would love to have you— 
summer, winter, it doesn’t matter. 
All of these things, of course, about 
the State are true, but there are so 
many other great things about our 
State. The No. 1 thing is our people: 
strong, resilient, kind, tough American 
citizens—great people. 
Nowhere is this spirit of the people of 
Alaska and their patriotism more ap-
parent than in our veterans across the 
State. 
In Alaska, we have the highest num-
ber of veterans per capita of any State 
in America, veterans and their families 
everywhere. Everyday heroes, I like to 
call them. 
It is amazing. In every city, village, 
community—it doesn’t matter how big, 
how small—you will find proud Amer-
ican veterans, many of them working 
tirelessly together to make sure they 
help other veterans get the support 
that they have earned, the care that 
they have earned, and to support their 
families. 
Today, as our Veterans Day ap-
proaches, I want to highlight one of 
these heroes, one of these Alaska vet-
erans whose service is so inspiring that 
for those who are watching, I think you 
are going to have a hard time actually 
believing it is true. This person, our 
Alaskan of the Week, is 94-year-old Jim 
Schmidt—husband, grandfather, great- 
grandfather, combat veteran, Alaskan, 
American hero. 
Let me tell you about this incredible, 
remarkable story, for which somebody 
should buy the movie rights right now. 
While you are watching, you better 
go 
buy 
the 
movie 
rights 
of 
Mr. 
Schmidt. 
Jim was 14 years old in 1942. Of 
course, the United States had already 
entered and was fighting in World War 
II. It wasn’t going well in 1942, by the 
way. He was living with his parents in 
the San Francisco Bay area. Jim 
slipped out one day to see a movie. It 
was called the ‘‘Parachute Battalion.’’ 
That was the name of the movie, star-
ring the beautiful Nancy Kelly. It was 
then, watching this movie, right then 
and there, he said: I am going to enlist. 
I am going to enlist in the Airborne. 
Now, he was a big guy, a big young 
man—actually, he was a young kid—200 
pounds, 6 feet tall. A big kid, as I men-
tioned, but just think, he was 14 years 
old. He went to the recruiter and said 
he was 18. He looked it. 
The Army didn’t ask for IDs back 
then, so off he went, assigned to the 
504th Infantry Regiment of the world- 
famous 82nd Airborne at the tender age 
of 14. 
His father was also in the Army, sta-
tioned at Fort Campbell, KY. And when 
there was a little confusion about 
where Jim was, when he didn’t come 
home for days and weeks, his mother 
assumed he had gone to stay with his 
dad. His dad assumed he was still with 
his mother. Wires got crossed, and 
later his mom got a letter from Cor-
poral Schmidt, CPL Jim Schmidt, who 
was now 15. He wrote: 
From somewhere in North Africa. 
Actually, it was near Tunis, which 
had just fallen to the British and Gen-
eral Patton, the American general, in

October 28, 2021 
the battle against the Germans in 
North Africa. 
He wrote his mom: 
How are you [mom] and the girls? 
He was referring to his sisters. He 
talked about the hot weather. He sent 
her $30. 
Fast forward a few months later. It is 
now July 9, 1943. Jim is jumping out of 
an airplane onto the island of Sicily, a 
combat jump. In Sicily, it was the larg-
est airborne offensive in U.S. history— 
a military airborne operation pro-
viding support for what was called Op-
eration Husky, more than 170,000 Allied 
troops that would descend onto the is-
land, drive the Axis powers—mostly 
the Germans—from the island and open 
up the Mediterranean front of the Eu-
ropean theater. Combat operations, 
airborne operations, and Jim is 15. 
Now, mistakes were made in this 
very big operation. Communications 
were sporadic. Friendly fire happened, 
no doubt killing American service-
members—ferocious combat. 
Some of these brave paratroopers— 
many were killed, many missed the 
landing spot—were scattered all over 
the island. 
When Corporal Schmidt, 15 years old, 
landed, he came under attack by the 
Germans. He lost one of his best friends 
and mentors, fighting together in a 
foxhole, hand-to-hand fighting. He en-
gaged in combat, killing the enemy. He 
remembers one young German, a mes-
senger about his age. He actually found 
the boy’s wallet because he wanted to 
get in touch with his family after the 
war to tell them how brave the young 
German soldier was—tough stuff. 
During the battle, he was wounded, 
but he continued to fight. But because 
he was wounded, a telegraph was sent 
home by the Army to his mom. And at 
that point, he and his battalion, which 
was part of the 504th Infantry Regi-
ment, Airborne Regiment in Salerno, 
Italy, were fighting to hold off a major 
German counterattack. 
You can imagine Jim’s mother was 
beside herself. Her 15-year-old son was 
wounded in combat in Italy. So guess 
what she did. You can tell what kind of 
stock Jim comes from. His mom wrote 
the President of the United States di-
rectly, President Roosevelt. 
She said to the President she was 
glad to have her husband serve in the 
Army, but it was a bit much that her 
15-year-old son was fighting in Europe 
and ‘‘lying wounded and unattended in 
a Sicily field.’’ 
That is Jim’s mom to President Roo-
sevelt. 
Remarkably, she received a response. 
The letter has since been lost, but 
those who saw it said that President 
Roosevelt himself wrote Jim’s mom 
and said: I am sorry the military didn’t 
know that Jim was only 15—14 when he 
joined—and that he would make sure 
he was located as soon as possible and 
sent back to the United States. Sounds 
a little bit like ‘‘Saving Private Ryan,’’ 
the movie. 
So that happened. Shortly before he 
turned 16, Corporal Schmidt was put on 
a ship, pretty much at the direction of 
the President of the United States, and 
sent back to the United States. 
Jim later recalled that when his 
mom saw him, of course, she was 
happy, but she ‘‘chewed me out. What 
would any other mother say to their 
son’’ for enlisting at the age of 14 and 
not telling the mom? 
A local newspaper heard about Jim 
and wrote a story. Here is what it said: 
Fifteen year old [then] Pfc James O. 
Schmidt . . . left his desk in the Eighth 
Grade at Ross Grammar School . . . to enter 
the Army, [he] has retired from active duty 
[at the age of 15] after seeing action with the 
[Airborne unit and] Paratroopers in [North] 
Africa and being wounded in the Battle of 
Sicily. 
He was 15. 
The newspaper wrote about how Jim 
had received an invitation to his own 
grammar school graduation when he 
was in Sicily. 
He wrote back to his grammar school 
and said: 
It will be impossible [for me to attend 
eighth grade graduation] as I am rather busy 
with the job of hunting Germans and 
Italians. 
This alone makes a great story. 
Grade school graduation was missed 
because he was fighting in Europe and 
North Africa and Italy. But there is 
more to this story. 
Shortly 
after 
being 
home, 
you 
guessed it, Jim walked into a Navy re-
cruiting office. Again, nobody in the 
Navy asked how old he was. 
The recruiter said: 
Congratulations. You’re now in the U.S. 
Navy. 
So off to boot camp he went at the 
age of 16, already a veteran, a serious 
combat 
veteran—16 
years 
old, 
unstoppable, American patriot, want-
ing to fight for his country in World 
War II. 
Six months later, Jim is on a Navy 
destroyer deployed. But his age finally 
caught up with him. The Navy found 
out, figured out he was 16, and sent him 
back home. Here is an Airborne combat 
veteran of World War II, he is 16, and 
he has already been kicked out of the 
Army and the Navy because he is too 
young. 
Obviously, this young man was hell- 
bent on serving his country so he found 
another organization where age didn’t 
matter. He joined the Merchant Ma-
rines, where he remained for the re-
mainder of World War II, serving on an 
ammo resupply ship in the Atlantic, 
participating in the war until the war 
was won and wound down. 
So the war is over. He is a little 
older. What do you think he does? 
Eight months after he turned 18, he re-
enlisted in the U.S. Army. 
Now, the Army was gracious and rec-
ognized: Hey, we got a combat vet. 
Yeah, he was only 14. So they brought 
him in as a sergeant, a D5. And guess 
what. By luck, he was assigned to occu-
pation duty in Germany with the 508th 
Infantry Airborne Regiment that he 
had fought with in North Africa and 
Sicily. 
So he did that duty; then he went to 
Japan for occupation duty. And then 
what happened in 1950? The Korean war 
breaks out. So he is sent to Korea. 
As if his service in World War II 
wasn’t enough, this remarkable story 
of James Schmidt continues. 
He went alongside the U.S. Marines 
to fight in one of the most brutal, fero-
cious battles of the 20th century—the 
Battle of the Chosin Reservoir. It was 
30 below zero, 120 communists, People’s 
Liberation 
Chinese 
soldiers, 
sur-
rounding 20,000 marines and the Army, 
soldiers and marines. 
It was incredible, horrible odds. And 
yet the Marines and the Army per-
severed, despite brutal combat situa-
tions, relentless Chinese communist 
troops attacking, attacking, attacking. 
He was wounded, broke his shoulder 
again, led his men in many counter-
attacks, and got the rest of his men 
out of the Chosin Reservoir. 
So, Mr. President, you are seeing 
that this is remarkable, but we are not 
done. 
He survived Chosin Reservoir. He sur-
vived the rest of the Korean war. He 
survived World War II. 
Fast-forward another decade, another 
American conflict in Southeast Asia, 
and now Jim Schmidt is a master ser-
geant, Special Forces, in Laos, charged 
with raising local forces to fight the 
communist Lao guerillas. 
Now he has been in combat in three 
wars, presented his third award, a Com-
bat Infantry Badge, for his actions in 
Laos. And, then, it was on to Vietnam, 
where Jim was the sergeant major in 
charge of the 7th Special Forces A- 
Teams and then the 5th Special Forces 
Group, one of the most famous units of 
all of the Vietnam war—5th Special 
Forces, an airborne unit—until he re-
turned to Fort Bragg in 1965. 
So here is what he has done so far for 
his country: two Silver Stars for her-
oism, three Bronze Stars for heroism, 
two Purple Hearts. 
He wanted back in the action, but 
the Army said: Nope. You are going to 
go into recruiting. 
According to one of his daughters, he 
was never much of a handshaker and 
did not like the idea of riding a desk. 
So, despite the heroism, despite the 
service, he opted to retire from the 
military, and then he joined Air Amer-
ica, which was doing covert operations 
in Vietnam, until 1967, when he finally 
decided to settle down with his wife 
Peggy and focus on another critically 
important task for our country: raising 
three 
strong, 
wonderful, 
beautiful 
daughters. 
Mr. President, that is something I 
can certainly relate to. 
Now, I want to say that this is an 
amazing story. Unfortunately, Jim was 
not always treated like the hero he 
was. During his Vietnam service, his 
father died—the World War II veteran I 
mentioned earlier—and so he rushed 
home through the San Francisco air-
port to attend his father’s funeral. 
And, unfortunately, he was in uniform

and, unfortunately, was jeered and 
booed by many in the airport. 
Can you imagine that, America? 
Think about that. What a shameful pe-
riod for our Nation that so many failed 
to honor obvious American heroes like 
Jim. But, fortunately, that didn’t last 
long for our country. But we should 
never forget that. 
But I am digressing because he 
wasn’t just an American hero in uni-
form but, according to his daughters, a 
great father. He was engaged in their 
activities—his three daughters—taught 
them to be determined, independent, 
hard-working young women where the 
sky was the limit. He didn’t let them 
sleep in. That was the military dad, I 
am sure. 
He and his wife Peggy, a registered 
nurse, came to Alaska in 1993 to be 
close to one of their daughters, who is 
now a renowned chef—actually, one of 
the best chefs in all of Alaska, and a 
lodge owner in Alaska, Kirsten Dixon. 
His other daughter Katherine is now a 
successful real estate broker, and his 
other daughter Jami lives in the DC 
area, who is also working in the intel-
ligence field, kind of like her old man 
did. What a great legacy for Jim and 
Peggy and the whole family. 
So Jim loves Alaska, the freedom in 
Alaska, the frontier spirit, the fact 
that he is in a State with more vet-
erans per capita than any State. And 
he is certainly one of the great ones 
that we have in our State. 
At 94 years old, he is surrounded by 
his children, his grandchildren, his 
great-grandchildren. According to his 
family, like most heroes in our coun-
try, he doesn’t talk much about the 
war—still really doesn’t—and his full 
story was only fully revealed when one 
of his grandchildren, Henry, began to 
get interested and did a podcast about 
his grandfather and shared it on social 
media—his amazing grandfather. Since 
then, the letters have flooded in, people 
wanting to know about this incredible 
American hero who missed his grade 
school graduation because he was doing 
airborne operations in Sicily. 
Just the other night he was on a 
Zoom with a 15-year-old because he al-
ways has time for veterans, and he 
gives advice to young people who are 
interested in serving in the military 
and hearing his story and getting ad-
vice. Jim says that he doesn’t believe 
the military is for everybody, but if 
you have the calling, then you should 
follow the calling, even if you are 
young—but, I would caution, not 14. 
But Jim should know. 
Mr. President, this is a remarkable 
American story, one for the history 
books, and it is one of the reasons, 
many reasons, that so many people in 
my State have served and sacrificed for 
their country—everyday heroes we call 
them—in Alaska. There are heroes all 
around us, and certainly Jim is one of 
the most important, one of the most 
prominent, one of the most humble. We 
are proud to have him in our State. 
We thank him and his wife Peggy and 
his wonderful three daughters and 
their whole family for sharing Jim 
with us, and we want to thank Jim for 
his incredible tenacity, patriotism, re-
markable service, and example. 
And, Jim, we want to thank you once 
again for being our Alaskan of the 
Week. Happy Veterans Day to you and 
all the veterans back home in Alaska. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, well, 
first, I just got to hear the story of Jim 
Schmidt of Alaska—what an amazing 
American hero. I thank the Senator 
from Alaska, Senator SULLIVAN, for 
sharing that with all of us. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor tonight to talk about 
the growing epidemic of drug addiction 
and the issue that is occurring in my 
home State of Ohio and, really, all the 
States represented here in this Cham-
ber and how we need to redouble our ef-
forts. 
It is a heartbreaking story because 
we were making so much progress prior 
to the COVID–19 pandemic, but, now, 
underneath the pandemic, we have this 
epidemic that is growing. 
But before I get into that, I must 
talk first about what is going on this 
evening in the U.S. House of Represent-
atives. Almost 3 months ago, at the be-
ginning of August, we passed in this 
Chamber bipartisan legislation to fi-
nally address our infrastructure short-
falls in this country. Presidents of both 
parties had been proposing it for many 
years. Congress had talked about it a 
lot, but we had never been able to fig-
ure out a way forward. 
So a group of 10 Republicans and 10 
Democrats got together and said: We 
are going to grow this from the middle 
out and figure out how to address our 
infrastructure challenges and do so in a 
bipartisan way. 
We did that. The President of the 
United States, President Biden, sup-
ported our effort, and we were able to 
get that legislation across the floor 
here in the U.S. Senate—not without 
some challenges and some changes and 
modifications. But we were able to do 
it because it was great for America, 
great for every State represented here, 
because it was repairing roads and 
bridges but also our ports, our water-
ways, our water infrastructure, our in-
frastructure that is considered digital, 
which would be high-speed internet, to 
make sure it is available to all of our 
citizens. 
So there are a lot of things that peo-
ple had talked about for a long time 
and said they were for, but finally we 
were able to actually put it into writ-
ing and get it done. And it passed this 
Chamber with a big vote: 69 votes. 
Rarely does something so significant 
pass this Chamber with that kind of bi-
partisan support. 
Unfortunately, it has languished in 
the House of Representatives for al-
most 3 months, since early August. 
And the reason it has languished over 
there isn’t because it doesn’t have the 
votes. It is really more because people 
would like to use it as a hostage for 
something they want even more, and 
that is just wrong. 
So, tonight, I urge my House col-
leagues, 
Democrat 
and 
Republican 
alike, to put aside the partisanship and 
focus on the substance of the bill and 
pass it. It has been held political hos-
tage to something that House Demo-
crats, particularly progressives in the 
House, want even more. It is not that 
they are opposed to infrastructure. 
They know this is needed. They know 
it is good for their constituents and it 
is good for our country. It is because 
they want even more to pass a massive, 
new spending bill called sometimes the 
Build Back Better bill, sometimes the 
reconciliation bill, sometimes the $3.5 
trillion tax-and-spend bill. That is to-
tally separate from infrastructure, but 
that is really what they want to pass. 
So they know that a lot of moderate 
Democrats support the infrastructure 
bill. They need those moderate Demo-
crats to support the massive tax-and- 
spend bill. So, in effect, they have held 
it hostage. They have not allowed the 
infrastructure bill to move unless they 
get commitments on the bill they real-
ly want, which is the tax-and-spend 
bill. I think that is just wrong. 
So I urge the Speaker of the House 
and my colleagues in the House to go 
ahead and vote on that legislation this 
evening. I know there has been back- 
and-forth all day about what will hap-
pen. All I can say is it is the right 
thing to do for our country. 
When you think about it, the infra-
structure bill is exactly what we need 
right now. Not only do we have a long- 
term challenge that everybody knows 
about and that we have been talking 
about for literally decades, but for the 
problems we face right now in our 
economy, it is very effective. 
Inflation: Everybody is concerned 
about it, and they should be. The cost 
of gasoline at the pump is up about 42 
percent this year compared to last 
year. It is really tough on middle-class 
families because, although paychecks 
may have gone up a little bit, inflation 
has gone up higher. So it is essentially 
a tax on so many of our working fami-
lies in this country. But everything is 
up: food, clothing, furniture, every-
thing. 
So inflation is driven, in part, by the 
stimulus spending. You remember that, 
back in March, there was a big bill, $1.9 
trillion. And many of us said, including 
some Democrats and including, fa-
mously, Larry Summers, who is the 
former Democratic Secretary of the 
Treasury for President Obama and in 
the Clinton administration: If you do 
this massive amount of spending, an 
unprecedented 
amount 
of 
stimulus 
spending, you will drive up inflation 
because you are putting many more 
dollars into people’s pockets, into the 
economy, at a time when the economy

October 28, 2021 
is already beginning to improve, and it 
will be chasing fewer and fewer goods, 
and that will raise inflation. 
And that is exactly what has hap-
pened, which is bad for everybody, par-
ticularly, again, lower and middle-in-
come families who are seeing this hid-
den tax, really, on everything they buy 
and, again, taking away the power of 
their slight increase in wages that we 
have seen. In fact, when you look at 
the data, it looks like wages have actu-
ally gone down in the past year. They 
have gone down because, after infla-
tion, wages are worth less. 
So that is where we are right now. 
And the infrastructure bill is actually 
counterinflationary. Why do I say 
that? Because it doesn’t invest in the 
way that the tax-and-spend bill in-
vests. It is not about stimulus. It is 
about longer term investments in hard 
capital assets. 
So the economists look at that—in-
cluding conservative economists at the 
American Enterprise Institute, includ-
ing Doug Holtz-Eakin, who is a former 
CBO Director here and a more conserv-
ative economist—and they say: Now, 
this actually will be counterinfla-
tionary because you are investing long 
term in these capital assets, creating 
jobs, making our economy more effi-
cient, making it more productive; and, 
therefore, in this instance now where 
we have this high inflation, it is a good 
thing to do. 
No. 2, we have had a lot of natural 
disasters in this country, particularly 
in the last year. About one out of every 
three Americans, apparently, lives in 
an area that has been subject to one of 
these natural disasters. It is the hurri-
canes. It is the floods. It is the 
wildfires. It is something that is affect-
ing our country in a major way right 
now, and we hear about it virtually 
every week. 
This legislation, the infrastructure 
bill, actually has provisions for resil-
iency to mitigate the damage from 
these natural disasters. So it is a well- 
timed bill in that sense as well. 
There is an historic commitment to 
ensuring that we are not just talking 
about climate change and natural dis-
asters but actually putting in place 
things that will protect communities 
from these natural disasters—whether 
it is forest fires, whether it is hurri-
canes, whether it is tornadoes, or other 
natural disasters. That is in this legis-
lation, the infrastructure bill. 
And, finally, what is one of the big-
gest issues we face right now in terms 
of our economy? The supply chain cri-
sis. Go to a store in your community, 
as many of you have, and you will see 
that the shelves are a lot more bare 
than they used to be. And there is not 
much on the shelves because we have 
this supply chain problem, kind of a 
bottleneck. 
Well, this legislation helps in that re-
gard because it provides funding for in-
frastructure, including our ports: our 
ports of entry, our land ports, but also 
our seaports that are now in a situa-
tion where they are jammed with more 
and more container ships, and, yet, 
they 
can’t 
process 
them 
quickly 
enough. 
So what the experts tell me is that 
the $2 billion in the infrastructure bill 
will help to improve those facilities, 
improve their operation, improve the 
intermodal 
connections—in 
other 
words, the truck connections, the train 
connections—to our ports and help 
move along this supply chain issue 
that we are currently facing. 
The legislation helps with regard to 
freight, rail. It helps with regard to our 
waterways, which carry a lot of freight 
in our country. 
So it is something that would be 
helpful in all three of these areas: in-
flation, natural disasters, and also our 
supply chain issues. 
At the same time, again, it is just 
needed because our infrastructure has 
fallen behind, particularly fallen be-
hind other countries. And, therefore, 
making our economy more efficient 
and more productive is a good thing. 
Again, that is why it got 69 votes here 
in the U.S. Senate and why we need to 
pass it. 
It is totally different from the tax- 
and-spend reconciliation bill, which, 
again, is massive new spending, mas-
sive tax increases, which will add to in-
flation; and at a time when we have 
such high debts and deficits, it will add 
to our record level of debt and deficit. 
Its large tax increases will hurt our 
economy at a time when we cannot af-
ford it. 
We just got the numbers in from the 
economic growth in the last quarter. 
They just came in today: 0.5-percent 
growth. Very disappointing. Well below 
expectations. 
So we know economic growth is slow-
ing. We know inflation is rising. We 
know that this is not the time for us to 
put forward this kind of legislation be-
cause it will aggravate the inflationary 
pressures, but it also causes us, at a 
time of debt and deficits, to see big in-
creases in spending. 
And, finally, again, at a time when 
our economy is, unfortunately, not per-
forming the way we would like to see 
it—it is slowing down; it has been the 
worst economic quarter we have seen 
since 2000—we need to make sure we 
were not adding new taxes to our econ-
omy at this time. So the timing is bad. 
By the way, the infrastructure bill 
has no new tax increases. The infra-
structure bill is not about immediate 
spending. It is about long-term spend-
ing over 5, 10, 15 years for capital as-
sets—again, counterinflationary. 
So they are very different proposals, 
aren’t they? 
I call on my colleagues in the House 
tonight to pass this legislation, get the 
infrastructure bill done. Don’t hold it 
hostage with something else. That is 
not how we operate. Do the right thing 
for your constituents and for our coun-
try. 
The other focus that I had tonight 
was on our opioid and, more broadly, 
drug addiction crisis we face in this 
country and, unfortunately, at a time 
with 
the 
pandemic, 
causing 
huge 
healthcare 
problems 
that 
has 
dis-
tracted a lot of our attention, under-
standably. But underneath that pan-
demic there has been this epidemic 
that has been growing, and that is, 
again, this addiction issue. 
Back in 2018, we saw a reduction in 
addiction and, specifically, in the way 
it is typically measured, which is the 
number of overdose deaths that occur 
in our States. It was great news: a 22- 
percent decrease in overdose deaths in 
my home State of Ohio, after decades 
of increases every single year—22 per-
cent in 1 year. 
2019 was also a good year, where we 
saw significant success in getting peo-
ple into treatment, getting people into 
recovery, reducing the use of drugs 
through 
prevention—all 
the 
things 
that we have been wanting to do. 
So much of that came from work 
that was done in this Chamber because 
we did enact new legislation and pro-
vided billions of more dollars for pre-
vention, for treatment, for recovery. 
And we had a lot of great activity 
going on at the State level, at our local 
levels as well, building on that. 
We had more Narcan being provided 
to our communities, which is this mir-
acle drug that reverses the effects of an 
overdose. We had very good success in 
getting more people not just into treat-
ment but into longer-term recovery, 
where there is a greater chance of them 
succeeding and not relapsing. 
We did that through some legislation 
called the Comprehensive Addiction 
and Recovery Act, bipartisan legisla-
tion passed here in this Chamber. Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE joined with me on 
that as a coauthor. And then we also 
passed additional legislation to get 
more money directly to the States. 
And we found that we were, again, 
making progress, and then the pan-
demic hit. 
Unfortunately, we now know from 
the latest data from the Centers for 
Disease Control—the CDC—that under 
the cover of this pandemic, the drug 
epidemic has not only not gone away, 
it has actually gotten much worse. 
Overdose deaths rose by nearly 30 
percent between March 2020 and March 
2021—the latest year for which we have 
data; 30-percent increase in overdose 
deaths. 
This is very discouraging and heart-
breaking really because that means 
much more devastation for our commu-
nities, families being broken apart, 
people not being able to achieve their 
God-given ability in life. Thousands 
more being lost—96,779 more individ-
uals—moms and dads, sons and daugh-
ters, friends and loved ones—lost their 
lives to overdose deaths during that 
yearlong period, the most recent year 
that we have data for. It is the worst 
year we have had in the history of our 
country in terms of overdose deaths. 
Again, we have been rightfully fo-
cused on COVID–19. But, particularly,

October 28, 2021 
as the COVID pandemic is beginning to 
get better, the Delta variant finally be-
ginning to affect our communities less, 
we have got to refocus ourselves on 
this addiction issue. If we don’t do it, 
we are going to continue to see this 
tragic epidemic take away more lives. 
In 47 States and the District of Co-
lumbia, the overdose rate went up dur-
ing this last year, including a 26-per-
cent increase in my home State of 
Ohio. In some States, by the way, the 
increase was as high as 85 percent. And 
I know the Members of the Senate who 
represent those States are well aware 
of that and would join me in saying we 
have to figure out a way; we have got 
to figure out a way. 
So what is the way forward? 
Well, part of it is to getting back to 
what we know works. The Comprehen-
sive Addiction and Recovery Act and 
the bill called the 21st Century Cures 
Act—both signed into law in 2016— 
again, provided billions of new dollars 
for 
prevention, 
for 
treatment, 
for 
longer-term recovery, for Narcan to 
help our first responders. And that 
worked, and we made progress. So let’s 
get back to that and redouble our ef-
forts there. 
But we need to do more. And we have 
new legislation we have introduced we 
think will do that. It is called the Com-
prehensive Addiction and Recovery Act 
2.0—I am sorry, 3.0. We have already 
done the first bill and 2.0. Now, we are 
at 3.0. And it provides additional help 
but also has some new provisions in ad-
dition to funding those that we know 
work, and that is extremely important 
as well. 
By the way, in these overdose deaths, 
we know that, increasingly, it is syn-
thetic opioids that is causing the dead-
ly outcome. Fentanyl, in particular, 
which is a synthetic form of heroin or 
other opioids that, for a long time, was 
being produced in China and then sent 
to our shores, and this poison was com-
ing into our communities by our own 
U.S. Postal Service. 
So several years ago, we wrote legis-
lation to deal with that called the 
STOP Act, and it actually has been 
quite effective to keep these drugs 
from coming in through the United 
States mail system. At that time, our 
mail system didn’t provide the kind of 
screening that the private carriers did, 
like FedEx or UPS or DHL, and so peo-
ple who were traffickers chose to use 
our own Postal Service. Maddening. 
And they were doing it successfully. 
But it is kind of like whack-a-mole. 
Once we dealt with the STOP Act and 
dealt with the fentanyl coming in from 
China directly through the mail sys-
tem, it started to show up where? 
Through our southern border. 
So, today, what the experts will tell 
you is this deadly fentanyl is coming in 
primarily through the U.S.-Mexico bor-
der; it is cheaper than ever, very inex-
pensive. Sometimes it is produced in 
Mexico using precursors that come 
from China. It is being pressed into 
pills, often, so people don’t know it is 
fentanyl. The pill may be Xanax. The 
pill may be Percocet. People think 
they are getting pain relief or anxiety 
relief when, in fact, they are getting 
fentanyl; and the tragic result of that 
is, again, more and more overdose 
deaths. 
We had a roundtable discussion re-
cently where we talked about the issue 
of the border and what was happening 
and the fact that so many people now 
are coming across the border, but also 
so much contraband, including these 
drugs. And we had a witness whose 
name was Virginia Krieger. This was 
last week: Virginia told us her very 
tragic story about her daughter, who 
thought she was taking a Percocet for 
pain because that is what the pill said. 
And she died of an overdose. And it was 
determined after the fact that, in fact, 
she had died of fentanyl because some 
evil scientist—perhaps in Mexico—had 
pressed these pills, made these pills, 
probably to try to get her addicted to 
this powerful drug fentanyl, and, in 
fact, she had ingested it, taken it, and 
it had caused her to overdose and die. 
Virginia—God bless her—has taken 
the death of her daughter, Tiffany 
Leigh Robertson, and channeled that 
grief into something positive. She is 
going out to the schools now and talk-
ing to young people—I see our pages 
are here tonight—and saying: Every 
drug, every pill that is not from a phar-
macy that you might find on the 
streets is potentially deadly. It can kill 
you. So be cautious. Don’t ever take a 
pill if you don’t know that it is coming 
from a pharmacy, that it is what it 
says it is. 
My heart goes out to Virginia, her 
family, and all those who have lost 
loved ones to these deadly substances. 
We need to be sure that we reduce the 
supply of these drugs, and we also do 
much more in terms of the demand re-
duction. 
One way we can start to address the 
supply of fentanyl and other synthetic 
opioids is to make sure that they are 
illegal. That might seem obvious to 
you, but we have had a hard time here 
in this country dealing with this issue 
because—think about it—if the syn-
thetic form of an opioid, which can be 
changed by one of these evil scientists 
fairly easily—maybe just one molecule 
changes—and suddenly it is not on the 
list of controlled substances and not il-
legal. 
So in order to avoid this problem and 
be sure that people are properly pros-
ecuted for illegal drugs, we are putting 
together legislation and trying to pass 
it, that ensures that there is a perma-
nent classification of these drugs as 
being illegal. 
The Drug Enforcement Agency, back 
in 2018, used its authority to tempo-
rarily 
classify 
all 
fentanyl-related 
drugs—all of them—as schedule I sub-
stances, meaning illegal at the highest 
level, which allows law enforcement to 
aggressively 
intercept 
and 
destroy 
those substances. Unfortunately, that 
was only temporary. So that designa-
tion needs to be made permanent. 
We have successfully extended the 
temporary extension a few times here, 
but it is going to expire again at the 
end of January. So in just a couple of 
months, once again, we will have an ex-
piration of that designation. 
Until we make these fentanyl-related 
drugs permanently illegal, law enforce-
ment will not have the certainty they 
need to go after the criminals moving 
these deadly substances, and fewer 
lives will be lost. 
The legislation is called the FIGHT 
Fentanyl Act. It is bipartisan. I intro-
duced it with Senator MANCHIN. Again, 
it fixes this problem by permanently 
classifying 
these 
drugs 
that 
are 
fentanyl-related as schedule I. It also 
gives our law enforcement the cer-
tainty they need to go after synthetic 
opioids in all forms and show we are 
committed to addressing the threat 
posed by this particularly dangerous 
class of drugs. 
So my hope is my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle will work with us to 
get this done before the end of Janu-
ary. There is no reason we should do it 
at the last minute. We should provide 
that certainty and predictability. 
At the same time, I continue to be-
lieve that the most progress can be 
made on the demand side. So, yes, we 
need to do a better job at the southern 
border. It is outrageous what is hap-
pening now. So many drugs are coming 
across at record levels. The apprehen-
sions of fentanyl are at record levels. 
In fact, enough fentanyl has been ap-
prehended this year alone to kill every 
man, woman, and child in America. 
That is how deadly the drug is. 
But, ultimately, we have to deal with 
the demand for that drug in this coun-
try. As long as we have this insatiable 
demand, it is going to be difficult to 
stop it through the supply side or even 
making these drugs illegal. 
So that is why I think we need new 
legislation to build on the Comprehen-
sive Addiction and Recovery Act, to 
build on what we have done previously, 
and this CARA 3.0 that we have intro-
duced with Senator WHITEHOUSE can 
help on that. It does so by addressing 
three important areas: research and 
education, treatment and recovery, and 
criminal justice reform. 
First, it will bolster our work to pre-
vent drug abuse before it happens, 
through funding, through research and 
education. To me, it is time for a na-
tional awareness campaign. It would be 
money well spent. And I believe we 
could use the money that we would ap-
propriate here to leverage a lot more 
private interest in this, to get the pri-
vate 
companies—like 
the 
pharma-
ceutical companies—to step forward 
and to help us in a true national drug 
awareness campaign. 
Second, research and development. 
We need to have better pain relief 
drugs in this country. We are still rely-
ing on things like Percocet, as I men-
tioned, and other opioids, prescription 
forms, that we have been relying on for 
decades. It is time to actually move

forward with the research and develop-
ment of alternative pain treatments 
that don’t lead to addiction as opioids 
do. There has been some progress 
there, but not nearly enough, and it 
needs more help. 
Third, in terms of treating substance 
abuse, our bill builds on what works by 
doubling down on proven evidence- 
based addiction treatment methods 
while expanding treatment options for 
groups particularly vulnerable to ad-
diction, including young people, new 
and expecting moms, rural commu-
nities, communities of color. And it 
will make permanent the expanded 
telehealth options for addiction treat-
ment that were temporarily created in 
response to the social distancing re-
quired by COVID–19. This is an exciting 
opportunity because it turns out, dur-
ing COVID–19, when we had to rely 
more on telehealth, there was actually 
a lot of success in getting people into 
treatment. 
Now, it wasn’t as good as having your 
recovery coach there with you and 
your, perhaps, other recovering addicts 
with you to give you the support you 
need, but for some people who couldn’t 
travel because of the COVID–19 restric-
tions and, now, perhaps can’t travel for 
other reasons, telehealth is something 
that was determined to be quite suc-
cessful in many cases. We should con-
tinue that. We have to change laws to 
do that because it is about whether 
that would be reimbursed, particularly 
under Medicaid and Medicare. 
CARA 3.0 will also bolster the recov-
ery options for individuals working to 
put addiction behind them through 
funding to support recovery support 
networks. It will enable physicians to 
provide medication-assisted treatment, 
like Methadone, to a greater number of 
patients and change the law to allow 
those drugs to be prescribed via tele-
health for greater use of access. 
Part of the telehealth we are looking 
for is if you have a medication-assisted 
treatment plan, then you can use tele-
health—in other words, over the inter-
net—to be able to get your prescrip-
tion. There needs to be safeguards in 
that. We need to be sure the first time 
a prescription is given, there is a face- 
to-face contact and make sure that it 
is not being abused, but this can be 
quite helpful. 
Finally, CARA 3.0 reforms our crimi-
nal justice system to ensure that those 
struggling with addiction, including 
our veterans, are treated with fairness 
and compassion by the law, putting 
them on a path to recovery instead of 
a downward spiral of substance abuse. 
When someone comes out of one of 
our prisons or jails and comes out as an 
addict and there is not treatment pro-
vided, way too often that person, of 
course, relapses and begins to use 
again, gets back into criminal activity, 
and gets right back in the criminal jus-
tice system. That doesn’t help any-
body. It certainly doesn’t help the tax-
payer because the cost is $30 to 
$35,000—probably more at the Federal 
level—to incarcerate someone. 
And when they get out, they are just 
creating more crimes in the commu-
nity. It is worth putting some empha-
sis on treatment while someone is in 
prison if they are suffering from addic-
tion and, certainly, when they get out, 
getting them into treatment and recov-
ery programs to get them back on their 
feet. 
By the way, we need these people in 
our workforce right now. We have al-
ways needed them, but we particularly 
do now. This is a win-win for our econ-
omy and certainly for the addict. 
CARA and CARA 2.0 have given 
States and local communities new re-
sources and authorities to make a real 
difference in our States. CARA 3.0, this 
new bill, renews and strengthens those 
programs and, given the recent spike in 
addiction, provides a significant boost 
in funding as well. 
When added with existing CARA pro-
grams authorized through 2023, we 
would be investing over $1 billion a 
year to address the epidemic, putting 
us on a path toward brighter future 
free from addiction. It is money well 
spent, in my view. It is necessary. 
Again, it is going to help to bring our 
families back together, get people back 
to work, and ensure that our commu-
nities are not being devastated by 
crime that is committed in relation to 
these drug issues. 
I believe these two bills—the FIGHT 
Fentanyl Act we talked about and 
CARA 3.0—will make a difference in ad-
dressing this crisis of addiction our 
country now faces that has been made 
even worse during the time of the pan-
demic. A lot of our victims of this ad-
diction crisis are suffering in silence. 
I urge my colleagues: Let’s act now. 
Let’s bring this to the light. Let’s 
allow mere people to get into treat-
ment, longer-term recovery. Let’s be 
sure we are making fentanyl illegal in 
all of its forms. Let’s, without delay, 
go to work to once again do what we 
know works because we turned the tide 
on addiction. 
We began to turn it in 2018, 2019. 
Let’s get back to that. We will save 
lives and give so many more Americans 
the ability to achieve their God-given 
potential.

PROTECTING STUDENT ATHLETES 
FROM CONCUSSIONS ACT OF 2021 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as our 
students return to in-person instruc-
tion, they also will return to school 
sports. We encourage our students to 
be active and play schools sports to 
promote healthy habits, team-building 
skills, and socialization, which are es-
pecially important after a year of re-
mote learning due to the COVID–19 
pandemic. Yet every year, more than 
140,000 estimated student athletes sus-
tain a concussion, and that is just the 
reported count. We can be sure that 
many more go unreported and un-
treated. 
The health benefits of competing in 
school sports are undermined if stu-
dents are staying out on the field after 
an injury, especially concussions. Un-
fortunately, many student athletes re-
turn to play prematurely, and there is 
growing evidence that untreated con-
cussions can have detrimental, long 
term effects on their health and aca-
demic performance. 
That is why last week I reintroduced 
the Protecting Student Athletes from 
Concussions Act. My bill would direct 
states to develop concussion safety 
plans for public schools that include a 
concussion safety awareness compo-
nent. Certain States, like Illinois, al-
ready have such procedures in place, 
but it is high time we make this true 
for all States. By equipping our schools 
and communities with evidence-based 
guidance for responding to concussions, 
we can keep our students and their fu-
tures safe. 
The bill also would require States to 
adopt a ‘‘when in doubt, sit it out’’ pol-
icy. If there is even the possibility that 
a student athlete has suffered a concus-
sion, their health and safety ought to 
be the No. 1 priority. That means, if an 
athlete is suspected of having sus-
tained a concussion, they should sit 
out and not be allowed to return to 
play the same day. They should return 
to play only once evaluated and cleared 
by a qualified healthcare professional. 
Let’s be clear: A concussion is a trau-
matic brain injury that affects brain 
function. It is, by no means, something 
we can simply shake or walk off. Get-
ting your ‘‘bell rung,’’ like they used to 
say in my day, is a serious threat to a 
young 
person. 
The 
still-developing 
brains of students make them more 
susceptible to injury, making concus-
sions all the more dangerous. 
A ‘‘when in doubt, sit it out’’ policy, 
endorsed by the American College of 
Sports Medicine and the American 
Academy of Neurology, will put the de-
cision to return to the game in the 
hands of qualified healthcare profes-
sionals. It will prevent student athletes 
from experiencing successive injuries 
by staying in the game when they are 
not fit. It will give student athletes 
time to heal and help ensure that 
short-term symptoms do not become 
long-term effects. 
As we return to in-person instruc-
tion, we must use common-sense and 
evidence-based approaches to ensure 
student safety. For school sports, this 
means we have to put the necessary 
procedures for preventing, detecting, 
responding to, and treating concus-
sions in place. This bill would help do 
that. 
It is why my bill is endorsed by the 
American College of Sports Medicine; 
American Academy of Neurology; Na-
tional Football League (NFL); National 
Basketball Association (NBA); Major 
League 
Baseball 
(MLB); 
National 
Hockey League (NHL); National Colle-
giate Athletic Association (NCAA); 
American Academy of Sports Physical 
Therapy; Academy of Neurologic Phys-
ical Therapy; American Physical Ther-
apy Association; Easterseals; Illinois 
High School Association; National As-
sociation of School Psychologists; Na-
tional Association of Secondary School

letic Administrators Association; Na-
tional Parent Teacher Association; Pop 
Warner Little Scholars; U.S. Soccer 
Federation; USA Cheer; USA Football; 
Safe Kids World Wide; and Sports & 
Fitness Industry Association. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
this common-sense, evidence-based ap-
proach to protecting student athletes. 
Thank you.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yes-
terday, in a hearing in the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee, Ranking 
Member RISCH, called out the State De-
partment for its apparent lack of ac-
tion in helping those Americans and 
Afghan allies who are still stuck in Af-
ghanistan. 
It has been 2 months since the with-
drawal of all American military and 
diplomatic presence in the country in 
the wake of the Talban’s total take-
over of that country. 
In the past week or so, the number of 
Americans reportedly still in the coun-
try has grown, not shrunk. 
We have gone from around 100 to over 
400. 
Now, I know Americans are not 
flocking to Taliban controlled Afghani-
stan, so why does this number keep 
going up? 
I understand that Americans are not 
required to register with the State De-
partment so it is understandable that 
they would not have a reliable, fixed 
list of Americans at the start of this 
crisis. 
But I find it hard to believe that 
Americans waited 2 months after being 
abandoned in Afghanistan by their gov-
ernment to reach out and then, in the 
space of a week, suddenly found a way 
to get in touch. 
The State Department set up special 
e-mail addresses and issued guidance 
on how to report Americans and Af-
ghan allies who need to be evacuated. 
My office heard from many Iowans 
concerned about those they knew in 
Afghanistan, and my staff followed the 
directions from the State Department, 
forwarding the contact information. 
For the most part, all I ever heard 
back was a confirmation that the mes-
sage was received. 
I am starting to wonder if these went 
into a black hole? 
I did not expect that the State De-
partment would devote time and effort 
to keeping me informed given that pre-
sumably it was all hands on deck to 
contact those in the country and make 
arrangements for them. 
However, 2 months later, I don’t see 
much progress. 
Then there are reports that efforts by 
brave former special forces and other 
Americans who picked up where their 
government left off to evacuate Ameri-
cans and Afghan allies have not re-
ceived the support they needed from 
the State Department. Is the State De-
partment just washing their hands of 
this mess? 
I shared with Senator RISCH informa-
tion I passed on to the State Depart-
ment about 98 Afghan allies known to 
Iowans to need help as their lives were 
in danger after the Taliban takeover. 
I am only aware of one that has been 
evacuated. 
I know that many have not even been 
contacted by the State Department. 
I am glad that Ranking Member 
RISCH entered this information into the 
RECORD along with information from 24 
other Senators, totaling 16,688 cases. 
That is just one quarter of the Sen-
ate, so I know there are many more 
cases out there. 
It is time to hear what the State De-
partment is doing to get the remaining 
Americans home and to process the 
cases of Afghan allies so those who 
helped us and whose lives are at risk 
can get to safety.

had I been present, I would have voted

30TH ANNIVERSARY OF OSCE’S OF-
FICE OF DEMOCRATIC INSTITU-
TIONS AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to 
commemorate the 30th anniversary of 
the creation of the Organization for Se-
curity and Cooperation in Europe’s— 
OSCE—Office of Democratic Institu-
tions and Human Rights—ODIHR—one 
of the world’s most preeminent and 
comprehensive human rights protec-
tion bodies. 
In 1990–1991, during the signing of the 
Charter of Paris for a New Europe that 
created ODIHR, a spirit of ‘‘profound 
change and historic expectations’’ pre-
vailed among the United States, na-
tions of Europe, and the Soviet Union.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7457 
October 28, 2021 
Revolutionary for their time, heads of 
state and governments resolved to 
‘‘build, consolidate and strengthen de-
mocracy as the only system of govern-
ment of our nations.’’ Further, by af-
firming that government’s first respon-
sibility is to ensure the ‘‘protection 
and promotion of human rights,’’ they 
explicitly linked the full attainment of 
those rights with ‘‘the foundation of 
freedom, justice and peace’’ and set the 
standard for relations and security 
within and among nations. 
Now, 30 years later, I am deeply con-
cerned that the fundamental freedoms 
that ODIHR was founded to safeguard 
are in peril. 
Authoritarianism is on the rise in 
Europe. Credible reports allege there 
are more than 750 political prisoners in 
Belarus, many detained for partici-
pating peacefully in protest of the 
fraudulent elections of August 2020 and 
the brutal government crackdown that 
followed. In Hungary, Viktor Orban’s 
administration continues its unprece-
dented 
consolidation 
of 
Hungary’s 
media, even as opposition figures orga-
nize to resist him. In many countries 
across the OSCE area, we have wit-
nessed an alarming rise in anti-Semi-
tism, racism, religious and other intol-
erance, and violence against women. 
These scourges have worsened the con-
ditions imposed by the COVID–19 pan-
demic that disproportionately affect 
the most vulnerable in our commu-
nities. 
With these and other challenges in 
mind, ODIHR’s valuable work to assist 
nations to live up to their commit-
ments is more relevant and more need-
ed than ever. 
ODIHR is empowered by states to en-
sure respect for human rights, funda-
mental freedoms and the rule of law, 
and to promote and strengthen demo-
cratic 
institutions 
and 
tolerance. 
ODIHR actively partners with OSCE’s 
57 participating states, civil society, 
and international organizations to sup-
port human rights defenders, enhance 
the independence of judiciaries, and 
promote human-rights-based policing. 
It offers legislative reviews and devel-
ops tools to support local government 
officials, including the Words into Ac-
tion project, which enhances social in-
clusion within local communities and 
for which I proudly help secure fund-
ing. 
The most visible demonstration of 
ODIHR’s collaboration with the United 
States is perhaps in the field of elec-
tion observation, where its method-
ology is rightly seen as the gold stand-
ard in international election observa-
tion. Since its founding, ODIHR, the 
Department of State, and the U.S. Con-
gress, through the OSCE Parliamen-
tary Assembly, have deployed thou-
sands of American citizens and legisla-
tors to observe the conduct of elections 
across the OSCE area, including in the 
United 
States. 
Since 
OSCE 
states 
pledged in 1990 to hold free and fair 
elections, elections observation has 
been recognized as one of the most 
transparent and methodical ways to 
encourage 
states’ 
commitment 
to 
democratic standards and is a hall-
mark of ODIHR’s work. 
For nearly 30 years, ODIHR has orga-
nized Europe’s largest human rights re-
view conference, the Human Dimension 
Implementation 
Meeting—HDIM— 
gathering thousands of representatives 
of governments, parliaments, and civil 
society for 2 weeks around the same 
table to review progress on human 
rights commitments. Unfortunately, 
the HDIM did not take place this Sep-
tember. Russia blocked consensus to 
hold the meeting, thereby denying the 
OSCE region’s nearly 1 billion citizens 
of a meaningful and sustained oppor-
tunity to hold their governments to ac-
count. 
In September, Russia also prevented 
ODIHR from deploying a full and inde-
pendent election observation mission 
to observe its Duma elections. Like-
wise, Russia was responsible for the 
closure of OSCE’s border observation 
mission, which provided valuable in-
sight into the personnel and materiel 
flowing across Russia’s border into the 
temporarily occupied areas of eastern 
Ukraine. 
ODIHR’s work is more important and 
relevant than at any time since its 
founding at the end of the Cold War. I 
would like to take a moment to extend 
my heartfelt appreciation to ODIHR’s 
180 staff from 35 countries, upon whose 
dedication and professionalism we rely 
as we strive to realize an equitable and 
just future for all. 
ODIHR is not only the human rights 
arm of the world’s largest regional se-
curity organization; it is also the inde-
pendent body endowed to assist us as 
we pursue this important goal. 
The phrase ‘‘Vancouver to Vladi-
vostok’’ is routinely invoked to de-
scribe the organization’s broad geo-
graphical reach. However, it is perhaps 
ODIHR—and 
OSCE’s—revolutionary 
and comprehensive concept of ‘‘secu-
rity,’’ which includes military secu-
rity, economic and environmental co-
operation, and human rights, that is its 
defining characteristic and most im-
portant contribution to world peace 
and the reason why we should all be 
celebrating ODIHR’s 30th anniversary 
this year and take steps to ensure its 
success for years to come.

GENEVA CONSENSUS 
DECLARATION 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
month marks the first anniversary of 
the Geneva Consensus Declaration on 
Promoting 
Women’s 
Health 
and 
Strengthening the Family. The his-
toric coalition that issued this declara-
tion was formed by a diverse group of 
countries 
committed 
to 
advancing 
women’s health, protecting life at 
every stage while affirming that there 
is no international right to abortion, 
upholding the importance of the family 
as foundational to society, and defend-
ing the sovereign right of Nations to 
make their own laws to advance these 
core values, without external pressure. 
The Geneva Consensus Declaration was 
signed on October 22, 2020, by 32 coun-
tries from every region of the world, 
representing more than 1,600,000,000 
people, which committed to working 
together on the core pillars enshrined 
in the declaration, and five countries 
have subsequently signed. Although 
President Biden removed the United 
States as a signatory to the Geneva 
Consensus 
Declaration 
earlier 
this 
year, at least temporarily, the coali-
tion is alive and growing, currently 
consisting of 36 countries. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD the text of this 
landmark document and the names of 
the 36 signatory countries. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
GENEVA
CONSENSUS
DECLARATION
ON
PRO-
MOTING WOMEN’S HEALTH
AND STRENGTH-
ENING THE FAMILY 
We, ministers and high representatives of 
Governments, 
Having intended to gather on the margins 
of the 2020 World Health Assembly in Gene-
va, Switzerland to review progress made and 
challenges to uphold the right to the highest 
attainable standards of health for women; to 
promote women’s essential contribution to 
health, and strength of the family and of a 
successful and flourishing society; and to ex-
press the essential priority of protecting the 
right to life, committing to coordinated ef-
forts in multilateral fora; despite our inabil-
ity to meet in Geneva due to the global 
COVID–19 pandemic, in solidarity, we 
1. Reaffirm ‘‘all are equal before the law,’’ 
and ‘‘human rights of women are an inalien-
able, integral, and indivisible part of all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms’’; 
2. Emphasize ‘‘the equal right of men and 
women to the enjoyment of all civil and po-
litical rights,’’ as well as economic, social, 
and cultural rights; and the ‘‘equal rights, 
opportunities and access to resources and 
equal sharing of responsibilities for the fam-
ily by men and women and a harmonious 
partnership between them are critical to 
their wellbeing and that of their families’’; 
and that ‘‘women and girls must enjoy equal 
access to quality education, economic re-
sources, and political participation as well 
as equal opportunities with men and boys for 
employment, leadership and decision-making 
at all levels;’’ 
3. Reaffirm the inherent ‘‘dignity and 
worth of the human person,’’ that ‘‘every 
human being has the inherent right to life,’’ 
and the commitment ‘‘to enable women to go 
safely through pregnancy and childbirth and 
provide couples with the best chance of hav-
ing a healthy infant’’; 
4. Emphasize that ‘‘in no case should abor-

attainable standard of health, without in-
cluding abortion; 
Reaffirm that there is no international 
right to abortion, nor any international obli-
gation on the part of States to finance or fa-
cilitate abortion, consistent with the long- 
standing international consensus that each 
nation has the sovereign right to implement 
programs and activities consistent with 
their laws and policies; 
Build our health system capacity and mo-
bilize resources to implement health and de-
velopment programs that address the needs 
of women and children in situations of vul-

Advance supportive public health policies 
for women and girls as well as families, in-

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING HINTON MILLS 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize a family-owned small business 
and beloved eastern Kentucky staple, 
Hinton Mills of Flemingsburg, KY, as 
the Senate Small Business of the Week. 
In 1918, Frank L. Hinton and his wife, 
Ellora, established Hinton Mills in 
Goddard, KY. The general store, which 
provided supplies for local farmers, 
moved down the road to Plummers 
Landing in 1923. After serving in World 
War II, their son, Frank O. Hinton, re-
turned to run the family business to-
gether with his wife, Maxine. Frank O., 
who had a passion for raising livestock, 
added a feed mill in 1956. By 1977, Hin-
ton 
Mills 
had 
added 
locations 
in 
Flemingsburg, Ewing, and May’s Lick, 
primarily serving local dairy oper-
ations and tobacco farmers. A fifth lo-
cation opened in Cynthiana in 2015, en-
abling Hinton Mills to serve northern 
and eastern Kentucky. 
Today, Hinton Mills continues to 
thrive as a farm supply store and feed 
retailer. The family-owned business 
celebrated its 103rd anniversary in 2021 
and is led by the third and fourth gen-
erations of Hintons. Family members 
serve in a number of roles, including 
Frank O.’s son, Bud Hinton, as presi-
dent, and Bud’s son, Adam Hinton, as 
vice president. Led by the ethos of 
‘‘Faith, Family, Friends, and Farm-
ing,’’ Hinton Mills has grown along 
with 
the 
surrounding 
area. 
Their 
strong sense of family has built a 
tight-knit, supportive team, with some 
families employed there for genera-
tions. To celebrate its 100th anniver-
sary, Kentucky Gateway Museum Cen-
ter hosted an exhibit in 2018 to recog-
nize Hinton Mills and their impact on 
the agricultural community of eastern 
Kentucky. 
Over the past 100 years, the Hinton 
family has consistently invested in and 
served their community. They regu-
larly participate in local and regional 
events, ranging from agricultural fairs 
and the annual Fleming County FFA 
Tractor Parade, to hosting their an-
nual weeklong Seed Day customer ap-
preciation event. Hinton Mills cham-
pions Kentucky’s agriculture industry, 
advocating for small agricultural busi-
nesses at the local, State, and national 
level. They are a part of several local 
business and industry groups, including 
the Fleming County Chamber of Com-
merce and Kentucky Retail Federa-
tion. Notably, Adam has served on the 
Kentucky Agricultural Development 
Board, the Kentucky Retail Federation 
Board of Directors, and the Kentucky 
FFA Foundation’s Board of Trustees. 
Like many small businesses, Hinton 
Mills rallied to face the challenges 
caused by the coronavirus pandemic 
and adapted to continue supporting 
local farmers as they kept the country 
fed. 
Hinton Mills is a remarkable exam-
ple of the resilience and adaptability of 
locally owned small businesses. Small 
businesses, like Hinton Mills, form the 
heart of towns across Kentucky and 
play a critical role in Kentucky’s agri-
cultural industry. Congratulations to 
Bud, Adam, and the entire team at 
Hinton Mills. I wish them the best of 
luck, and I look forward to watching 
their continued growth and success in 
Kentucky.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina 
(for himself and Mr. RUBIO): 
S. 3101. A bill to amend title II of the 
Social Security Act to repeal the re-
tirement earnings test, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
older American workers are a vital 
source of economic strength. Before 
the pandemic, there were more seniors 
in the workforce than there were 20 
years ago, and men and women age 55 
and older lifted the overall labor force 
participation rate by a substantial 
margin. During the pandemic, more 
than 3 million seniors retired early, 
and millions more are considering 
early retirement. These losses harm 
seniors’ retirement security by reduc-
ing their income and benefits. 
That is why today, with my good 
friend Senator RUBIO, I am introducing 
the Senior Citizens’ Freedom to Work 
Act, which would repeal the Social Se-
curity retirement earnings test. The 
earnings test is a confusing work dis-
incentive. It says that you lose half 
your Social Security benefits if you 
earn more than $18,960. Then it gives 
your benefits back at full retirement 
age. The problem is that many seniors 
know their benefits will be cut if they 
make too much money, but not that 
they will be replaced later. They treat 
the earnings test like a 50-percent tax 
and work less to avoid it. 
When I have spoken to small business 
owners in South Carolina they have 
made clear to me that the earnings 
test is in fact a disincentive for many 
older workers, and it harms their busi-
nesses. Older Americans want to earn 
just enough that they fall right under 
the threshold so their benefits don’t 
get cut, which makes it harder for 
small businesses to hire them even on 
a part-time basis. It is not surprising 
that research shows the earnings test 
reduces labor force participation by 
more than 3 percent. 
The earnings test also deepens in-
equality. It punishes lower-income sen-
iors who need Social Security benefits 
and earned income to get by. And if 
you need Social Security benefits and 
earned income to meet caregiving re-
sponsibilities or pressing financial obli-
gations or because you have a lower 
life expectancy, the earnings test says 
no, you have to wait until you reach 
full retirement age, whether that is 65 
or 67. 
Many seniors just can’t wait that 
long, and the economy can’t either. 
The Senior Citizens’ Freedom to Work 
Act will give these older Americans the 
freedom and flexibility they need, pro-
mote work, and help employers and 
workers find arrangements that work 
best for them. 
Thank you. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, 
Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN, Mr. CORNYN, and Mr. 
LEAHY): 
S. 3103. A bill to amend title 18, 
United States Code, to eliminate the 
statute of limitations for the filing of a 
civil claim for any person who, while a 
minor, was a victim of a violation of 
section 1589, 1590, 1591, 2241(c), 2242, 
2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 
2422, or 2423 of such title; to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 3103 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Eliminating 
Limits to Justice for Child Sex Abuse Vic-
tims Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMI-
TATIONS. 
Section 2255 of title 18, United States Code, 
is amended by striking subsection (b) and in-
serting the following: 
‘‘(b) STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.—There shall 
be no time limit for the filing of any action 
commenced under this section.’’. 
SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE; APPLICABILITY. 
This Act and the amendments made by 
this Act shall— 
(1) take effect on date of enactment of this 
Act; and 
(2) apply to— 
(A) any claim or action that, as of the date 
described in paragraph (1), would not have 
been barred under section 2255(b) of title 18, 
United States Code, as it read the day before 
the date of enactment of this Act; and 
(B) any claim or action arising after the 
date of enactment of this Act. 
By Mr. CARPER: 
S. 3104. A bill to amend the Coastal 
Zone Management Act of 1972 to allow 
the District of Columbia to receive 
Federal funding under such Act, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing legislation to allow the 
District of Columbia to receive funding 
and other benefits under the Coastal 
Zone Management Act. I am pleased to 
offer this companion legislation to a 
bill introduced by the Congresswoman 
from the District of Columbia, ELEA-
NOR HOLMES NORTON. 
Few of us realize that 70 percent of 
the District is located within the 
coastal plain. Similar to my State of 
Delaware, sea level rise, upstream 
sources of water, and degraded infra-
structure mean that the District could 
experience serious future cleanup and 
repair costs due to flooding, including 
damage to Federal property, which 
makes up almost 30 percent of the Dis-
trict. Since 1950, the National Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 
Administration, 
NOAA, reports there has been a 343-per-
cent increase in nuisance flooding in

the District. Since 2006, D.C. has expe-
rienced two 100-year flooding events. 
Scientists predict that tides on the At-
lantic coast could rise 2 to 4 feet by the 
year 2100, causing as much as $7 billion 
worth of property damage in the Dis-
trict, which would regularly be under 
threat by floodwaters. This fact was 
highlighted by a study released by the 
nonprofit Climate Central last week. 
Needless to say, these events will be-
come more and more common due to 
climate change and sea level rise. 
The District of Columbia would use 
funding from the Coastal Zone Manage-
ment Program for flood risk planning 
and environmental restoration to pre-
vent and mitigate future flood damage. 
At the same time, this work would help 
to restore and conserve the District’s 
coastal resources such as habitat, fish-
eries, and endangered species. 
If included in the Coastal Zone Man-
agement Program, the District of Co-
lumbia would be eligible for $1 million 
or more of Federal funding annually to 
assist in coastal flood-control projects, 
to combat non-point source water pol-
lution, and to develop special area 
management plans in areas experi-
encing environmental justice and/or 
flooding issues. 
The National Coastal Zone Manage-
ment Program, housed in NOAA, was 
established through the passage of the 
Federal Coastal Zone Management Act 
of 1972. At the time, Congress recog-
nized the need to manage the effects of 
increased growth in the Nation’s coast-
al zone, which includes jurisdictions 
bordering the oceans and the Great 
Lakes. 
There are currently 34 jurisdictional 
coastal zone management programs, 
including both States and territories. 
In order for the District of Columbia to 
participate in the program, Congress 
must pass this amendment to the 
Coastal Zone Management Act that 
would include the District under the 
definition of a ‘‘coastal State.’’ 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
text of the bill I am introducing today 
be printed in the RECORD following my 
statement. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 3104 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Flood Pre-
vention Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. ELIGIBILITY OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
FOR FEDERAL FUNDING UNDER THE 
COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT 
OF 1972. 
Section 304(4) of the Coastal Zone Manage-
ment Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1453(4)) is amend-
ed by inserting ‘‘the District of Columbia,’’ 
after ‘‘the term also includes’’.

Ms. HIRONO, Mr. President, I rise

tant legislation would provide all unac-
companied children with legal rep-
resentation as they go through immi-
gration proceedings. This will protect 
the legal rights of vulnerable children 
running from violence, abuse, and 
gangs, but it will also make our immi-
gration system more efficient. 
Five years ago, I traveled to Balti-
more, MD, to observe immigration 
court hearings on the children’s dock-
et. I watched children, who had suf-
fered violence and trauma in their 
home countries, trying to navigate our 
complex legal system without any sup-
port. Leaving young people, children as 
young as 3, to combat an adversarial 
government lawyer and explain why 
they qualify for a legal immigration 
status is unacceptable and unconscion-
able. 
I have also had the opportunity to 
speak to children who were able to se-
cure an immigration status with legal 
support. These children are grateful to 
have escaped the dangers that drove 
them to leave home. They also express 
with certainty that they would not 
have been able to succeed in their cases 
if they did not have lawyers rep-
resenting them. 
In immigration court, people seeking 
relief through our immigration system 
do not have a right to counsel and 
often cannot afford counsel who under-
stand our Byzantine immigration sys-
tem and can explain the lifelong rami-
fications that result from certain deci-
sions. This unfairness is most acute 
when it comes to unaccompanied chil-
dren who are trying to escape brutal 
violence and crushing poverty. Most do 
not speak English, nor do they have 
any understanding of our legal system. 
Yet we expect them to argue their case 
before immigration court and against 
trained and skilled ICE attorneys. 
The Fair Day in Court for Kids Act 
would remedy this injustice by pro-
viding all unaccompanied children with 
legal counsel. Attorneys would review 
the case, advise the child of their legal 
options, 
and 
remain 
with 
them 
throughout 
their 
immigration 
pro-
ceedings. Legal counsel would ensure 
these children have the legal rights and 
opportunities they are afforded, help-
ing our immigration system protect 
the people it was meant to support. 
In addition to protecting the rights 
of unaccompanied children, legal coun-
sel 
will 
ensure 
their 
cases 
move 
quicker and more smoothly. Cases with 
unrepresented children are subject to 
delays and a slower pace as the judge 
must repeatedly help the child under-
stand what is going on and help them 
respond. Children with legal counsel 
also have a 98 percent appearance rate 
in court. These efficiencies can only 
help our overwhelmed immigration 
court system, which currently has a 1.4 
million case backlog. 
I call on my Senate colleagues to 
help protect unaccompanied children 
and quickly pass this bill.

harmful school policies and educational cur-
ricula affecting their children to ‘‘domestic 
terrorism and hate crimes’’ against school 
boards, administrators, and teachers; and 
(2) requested that the President use Fed-
eral law enforcement resources and legal au-
thorities designed to address domestic ter-
rorism, such as the authorities provided by 
the USA PATRIOT Act (Public Law 107–56; 
115 Stat. 272), to investigate and prosecute 
parents who protest against such policies 
and curricula; 
Whereas, in response to such letter, United 
States Attorney General Merrick Garland 
issued a memorandum, dated October 4, 2021, 
directing Federal law enforcement resources 
to be used to discourage, investigate, and 
prosecute parents engaged in such dem-
onstrations and protests; and 
Whereas parents should be at the forefront 
of the decisions affecting the education and 
well-being of their children, and school 
boards, school administrators, and teachers 
should work collaboratively with parents to 
improve educational outcomes rather than 
treat parents as intruders in the education of 
their children: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

Ms. SMITH, and Ms. WARREN) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 432 
Whereas the earliest documented Filipino 
presence in the continental United States 
was October 18, 1587, when the first ‘‘Luzones 
Indios’’ arrived in Morro Bay, California, on 
board the Nuestra Sen˜ ora de Esperanza, a 
Manila-built galleon ship; 
Whereas the Filipino American National 
Historical Society recognizes 1763 as the year 
in which the first permanent Filipino settle-
ment in the United States was established in 
St. Malo, Louisiana; 
Whereas the recognition of the first perma-
nent Filipino settlement in the United 
States adds a new perspective to the history 
of the United States by bringing attention to 
the economic, cultural, social, and other no-
table contributions made by Filipino Ameri-
cans to the development of the United 
States; 
Whereas the Filipino American community 
is the third largest Asian American and Pa-
cific Islander group in the United States, 
with a population of approximately 4,100,000; 
Whereas, from the Civil War to the Iraq 
and Afghanistan conflicts, Filipinos and Fili-
pino Americans have a longstanding history 
of serving in the Armed Forces of the United 
States; 
Whereas more than 250,000 Filipinos fought 
under the United States flag during World 
War II to protect and defend the United 
States in the Pacific theater; 
Whereas a guarantee to pay back the serv-
ice of Filipinos through veterans benefits 
was reversed by the First Supplemental Sur-
plus Appropriation Rescission Act, 1946 (Pub-
lic Law 79–301; 60 Stat. 6) and the Second 
Supplemental Surplus Appropriation Rescis-
sion Act, 1946 (Public Law 79–391; 60 Stat. 
221), which provided that the wartime service 
of members of the Commonwealth Army of 
the Philippines and the new Philippine 
Scouts shall not be deemed to have been ac-
tive service, and, therefore, those members 
did not qualify for certain benefits; 
Whereas 26,000 Filipino World War II vet-
erans were granted United States citizenship 
as a result of the Immigration Act of 1990 
(Public Law 101–649; 104 Stat. 4978), which 
was signed into law by President George 
H.W. Bush on November 29, 1990; 
Whereas, on February 17, 2009, President 
Barack Obama signed into law the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Pub-
lic Law 111–5; 123 Stat. 115), which estab-
lished the Filipino Veterans Equity Com-
pensation 
Fund 
to 
compensate 
Filipino 
World War II veterans for their service to the 
United States; 
Whereas, since June 8, 2016, the Filipino 
World War II Veterans Parole Program has 
allowed Filipino World War II veterans and 
certain family members to be reunited more 
expeditiously than the immigrant visa proc-
ess allowed at that time; 
Whereas, on December 14, 2016, President 
Barack Obama signed into law the Filipino 
Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold 
Medal Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–265; 130 
Stat. 1376) to award Filipino veterans who 
fought alongside troops of the United States 
in World War II the highest civilian honor 
bestowed by Congress; 
Whereas, on October 25, 2017, the Congres-
sional Gold Medal was presented to Filipino 
World War II veterans in Emancipation Hall 
in the Capitol Building, a recognition for 
which the veterans had waited for more than 
70 years; 
Whereas Filipino Americans have received 
the Congressional Medal of Honor, the high-
est award for valor in action against an 
enemy force that may be bestowed on an in-
dividual serving in the Armed Forces, and 
continue to demonstrate a commendable 
sense of patriotism and honor in the Armed 
Forces; 
Whereas the late Peter Aquino Aduja of 
Hawaii 
and 
the 
late 
Thelma 
Garcia 
Buchholdt of Alaska became the first Fili-
pino American elected to public office and 
the first Filipina American elected to a leg-
islature in the United States, respectively, 
inspiring their fellow Filipino Americans to 
pursue public service in politics and govern-
ment; 
Whereas Filipino American farmworkers 
and labor leaders, such as Philip Vera Cruz 
and Larry Itliong, played an integral role in 
the multiethnic United Farm Workers move-
ment, 
alongside 
Cesar 
Cha´vez, 
Dolores 
Huerta, and other Latino workers; 
Whereas, on April 25, 2012, President 
Barack 
Obama 
nominated 
Lorna 
G. 
Schofield to be a United States District 
Judge for the United States District Court 
for the Southern District of New York, and 
she was confirmed by the Senate on Decem-
ber 13, 2012, to be the first Filipina American 
in United States history to serve as an Arti-
cle III Federal judge; 
Whereas Filipino Americans play an inte-
gral role on the frontlines of the COVID–19 
pandemic in the healthcare system of the 
United States as nurses, doctors, first re-
sponders, and other medical professionals; 
Whereas Filipino Americans contribute 
greatly to music, dance, literature, edu-
cation, business, journalism, sports, fashion, 
politics, government, science, technology, 
the fine arts, and other fields that enrich the 
United States; 
Whereas, as mandated in the mission state-
ment of the Filipino American National His-
torical Society, efforts should continue to 
promote the study of Filipino American his-
tory and culture because the roles of Filipino 
Americans and other people of color have 
largely been overlooked in the writing, 
teaching, and learning of the history of the 
United States; 
Whereas it is imperative for Filipino 
American youth to have positive role models 
to instill— 
(1) the significance of education, com-
plemented by the richness of Filipino Amer-
ican ethnicity; and 
(2) the value of the Filipino American leg-
acy; and 
Whereas it is essential to promote the un-
derstanding, education, and appreciation of 
the history and culture of Filipino Ameri-
cans in the United States: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the celebration of Filipino 
American History Month in October 2021 as— 
(A) a testament to the advancement of Fil-
ipino Americans; 
(B) a time to reflect on and remember the 
many notable contributions that Filipino 
Americans have made to the United States; 
and 
(C) a time to renew efforts toward the re-
search and examination of history and cul-
ture so as to provide an opportunity for all 
people of the United States to learn more 
about Filipino Americans and to appreciate 
the historic contributions of Filipino Ameri-
cans to the United States; and 
(2) urges the people of the United States to 
observe Filipino American History Month 
with appropriate programs and activities. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today in recognition of Filipino Amer-
ican History Month. Throughout the 
month of October, people across the 
United States come together to pay 
tribute to the rich culture, history, and 
heritage of Filipino Americans. 
Since the first permanent Filipino 
settlement in the United States was es-
tablished more than 250 years ago, Fili-
pino Americans have played a notable 
role in the development of our country. 
As the third largest Asian American 
and Pacific Islander group in the 
United States, Filipino Americans add 
to the fabric of our society through 
contributions in healthcare, the arts,

business, journalism, and in govern-
ment and military service. 
Filipinos 
and 
Filipino 
Americans 
have a longstanding history of serving 
in the U.S. Armed Forces. In 1915, Fire-
man Second Class Telesforo Trinidad 
was awarded the Medal of Honor for his 
extraordinary heroism in rescuing two 
shipmates after a boiler explosion on 
board the USS San Diego. He survived 
and continued serving during WWI and 
WWII until his retirement in 1945. 
Today, Telesforo Trinidad holds the 
distinction of being the first Filipino 
American and the first and only Asian 
American in the U.S. Navy to receive a 
Medal of Honor. 
Filipino Americans have also con-
tributed as leaders in important work-
ers’ rights and civil rights movements. 
In 1965, Larry Itliong, Peter Velasco, 
and Philip Vera Cruz led Filipino 
American farm workers to strike, de-
manding better pay, benefits, and 
working conditions. The Delano Grape 
Strike was one of the most pivotal civil 
rights and labor movements in Amer-
ican history. 
Earlier this month, Maria Ressa, a 
Filipino-American journalist and au-
thor, became the first person born in 
the Philippines to win a Nobel Peace 
Prize. Maria, a ‘‘fearless defender of 
freedom of expression,’’ was awarded 
the Nobel Peace Prize for working to 
expose the abuses of power and growing 
authoritarianism in her native coun-
try. She also founded Rappler, a digital 
media company for investigative jour-
nalism that has documented how social 
media is spreading fake news and ma-
nipulating public views. 
While 
Filipino 
American 
History 
Month is a time of celebration and 
commemoration, we must also recog-
nize the disparate impact that the 
COVID–19 pandemic has had on com-
munities of color, including the Fili-
pino-American community. Approxi-
mately one in four Filipino-American 
adults serve as frontline healthcare 
workers. High representation in essen-
tial work and other socioeconomic fac-
tors like living in multigenerational 
homes, poverty, limited English pro-
ficiency, preexisting health conditions, 
and a lack of health insurance, put 
these communities at higher risk for 
COVID–19 transmission. As a result, 
Filipino-Americans comprise an esti-
mated 32 percent of COVID–19 deaths 
among nurses despite representing only 
4 percent of registered nurses nation-
wide. In spite of the emotional and 
physical toll of the pandemic on these 
frontline workers and their families, 
the Filipino-American community has 
continued to show its strength and re-
silience. 
During Filipino American History 
Month, we reflect on the great sac-
rifices and contributions of generations 
of Filipino Americans who have helped 
to shape our Nation. This resolution 
reminds us that as the United States 
forges ahead, it is crucial to ensure 
that future generations can learn from 
and appreciate the legacies of Filipino 
Americans, as well as other immi-
grants and people of color.

Whereas, since World War II, hundreds of

Whereas the United States strongly sup-

Whereas the historic coalition that issued 
the Geneva Consensus Declaration on Pro-
moting Women’s Health and Strengthening

the ‘‘Geneva Consensus Declaration’’) was 
formed by a diverse group of countries com-
mitted to charting a more positive path to 
advance the health of women, protect the 
family as foundational to any healthy soci-
ety, affirm the value of life in all stages of 
development, and uphold the sovereign right 
of countries to make their own laws to ad-
vance those core values, without external 
pressure; 
Whereas the Geneva Consensus Declaration 
was signed on October 22, 2020, by 32 coun-
tries from every region of the world, rep-
resenting more than 1,600,000,000 people, 
which committed to working together on the 
core pillars enshrined in the Declaration, 
and 5 countries have subsequently signed;

Whereas, although President Joseph R. 
Biden removed the United States as a signa-
tory to the Geneva Consensus Declaration, 
at least temporarily, 36 countries remain sig-
natories, and longstanding Federal laws that 
prohibit the United States from conducting 
or funding abortions, abortion lobbying, or 
coercive family planning in foreign countries 
remain in effect; 
Whereas the Geneva Consensus Declaration 
reaffirms that ‘‘all are equal before the law’’ 
and ‘‘human rights of women are an inalien-
able, integral, and indivisible part of all 
human rights and fundamental freedoms’’; 
Whereas the Geneva Consensus Declaration 
reaffirms the inherent ‘‘dignity and worth of 
the human person’’ and that ‘‘every human 
being has the inherent right to life’’; 
Whereas the Geneva Consensus Declaration 
reaffirms that ‘‘there is no international 
right to abortion, nor any international obli-
gation on the part of States to finance or fa-
cilitate abortion’’; 
Whereas the Geneva Consensus Declaration 
reaffirms that ‘‘the family is the natural and 
fundamental group unit of society and is en-
titled to protection by society and the 
State’’; and 
Whereas the Geneva Consensus Declaration 
coalition strengthens the collective voice of 
the signatory countries to prevent any coun-
try from being intimidated, isolated, or 
muted on the core values expressed in the 
Declaration: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress—

47 of title 10, United States Code (the Uni-
form Code of Military Justice), is amended 
by inserting after section 873 (article 73) the 
following new section: 
‘‘§ 873a. Art 73a. Petition for DNA testing 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Upon a written petition 
by an accused sentenced to imprisonment or 
death pursuant to a conviction under this 
chapter (referred to in this section as the 
‘applicant’), the Judge Advocate General 
shall order DNA testing of specific evidence 
if the Judge Advocate General finds that all 
of the following apply: 
‘‘(1) The applicant asserts, under penalty of 
perjury, that the applicant is actually inno-
cent of the offense for which the applicant is 
sentenced to imprisonment or death. 
‘‘(2) The specific evidence to be tested was 
secured in relation to the investigation or 
prosecution of the offense referenced in the 
applicant’s assertion under paragraph (1). 
‘‘(3) The specific evidence to be tested— 
‘‘(A) was not previously subjected to DNA 
testing and the applicant did not knowingly 
fail to request DNA testing of that evidence 
in a prior motion for postconviction DNA 
testing; or 
‘‘(B) was previously subjected to DNA test-
ing and the applicant is requesting DNA 
testing using a new method or technology 
that is substantially more probative than 
the prior DNA testing. 
‘‘(4) The specific evidence to be tested is in 
the possession of the Government and has 
been subject to a chain of custody and re-
tained under conditions sufficient to ensure 
that such evidence has not been substituted, 
contaminated, tampered with, replaced, or 
altered in any respect material to the pro-
posed DNA testing. 
‘‘(5) The proposed DNA testing is reason-
able in scope, uses scientifically sound meth-
ods, and is consistent with accepted forensic 
practices. 
‘‘(6) The applicant identifies a theory of de-
fense that— 
‘‘(A) is not inconsistent with an affirma-
tive defense presented at trial; and 
‘‘(B) would establish the actual innocence 
of the applicant of the offense referenced in 
the applicant’s assertion under paragraph 
(1). 
‘‘(7) If the applicant was convicted fol-
lowing a trial, the identity of the perpe-
trator was at issue in the trial. 
‘‘(8) The proposed DNA testing of the spe-
cific evidence may produce new material evi-
dence that would— 
‘‘(A) support the theory of defense ref-
erenced in paragraph (6); and 
‘‘(B) raise a reasonable probability that the 
applicant did not commit the offense. 
‘‘(9) The applicant certifies that the appli-
cant will provide a DNA sample for purposes 
of comparison. 
‘‘(10) The petition is made in a timely fash-
ion, subject to the following conditions: 
‘‘(A) There shall be a rebuttable presump-
tion of timeliness if the petition is made 
within five years of the date of the enact-
ment of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2022 or within three years 
after the date of the entry of judgment under 
section 860c of this title (article 60c), which-
ever comes later. Such presumption may be 
rebutted upon a showing— 
‘‘(i) that the applicant’s petition for a DNA 
test is based solely upon information used in 
a previously denied motion; or 
‘‘(ii) of clear and convincing evidence that 
the applicant’s filing is done solely to cause 
delay or harass. 
‘‘(B) There shall be a rebuttable presump-
tion against timeliness for any petition not 
satisfying subparagraph (A). Such presump-
tion may be rebutted upon the Judge Advo-
cate General’s finding— 
‘‘(i) that the applicant was or is incom-

GOVERNMENT
EFFORTS
TO 
COMBAT CORRUPTION IN RELATION TO RELEVANT 
INTERNATIONAL

deter-
mining whether a government is making se-
rious and sustained efforts to address corrup-
tion, the Secretary of State shall consider 
the government of a country’s compliance 
with the following, as relevant: 
(A) 
The 
Inter-American

the 
Global 
Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability 
Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law 114– 
328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note)—

tary activities of the Department of 
Defense, for military construction, and 
for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military 
personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of division A, add the following: 
TITLE 
XVII—COMBATING 
CORRUPTION 
AND 
PROMOTING 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
INTERNATIONALLY 
Subtitle A—Transnational Repression 
Accountability and Prevention Act of 2021 
SEC. 1701. SHORT TITLE. 
This 
subtitle 
may 
be 
cited 
as 
the 
‘‘Transnational Repression Accountability 
and Prevention Act of 2021’’ or as the ‘‘TRAP 
Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1702. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The International Criminal Police Or-
ganization (INTERPOL) works to prevent 
and fight crime through enhanced coopera-
tion and innovation on police and security 
matters, including kleptocracy, counterter-
rorism, cybercrime, counternarcotics, and 
transnational organized crime. 
(2) United States membership and partici-
pation in INTERPOL advances the national 
security and law enforcement interests of 
the United States related to combating 
kleptocracy, 
terrorism, 
cybercrime, 
nar-
cotics, and transnational organized crime. 
(3) Article 2 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
states that the organization aims ‘‘[to] en-
sure and promote the widest possible mutual 
assistance between all criminal police au-
thorities . . . in the spirit of the ‘Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights’ ’’. 
(4) Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
states that ‘‘[i]t is strictly forbidden for the 
Organization to undertake any intervention 
or activities of a political, military, reli-
gious or racial character’’. 
(5) These principles provide INTERPOL 
with a foundation based on respect for 
human rights and avoidance of politically 
motivated actions by the organization and 
its members. 
(6) Some INTERPOL member countries 
have used INTERPOL’s databases and proc-
esses, including Notice and Diffusion mecha-
nisms and the Stolen and Lost Travel Docu-
ment Database, for activities of a political 
or other unlawful character and in violation 
of international human rights standards, in-
cluding making requests to INTERPOL for 
interventions related to purported charges of 
ordinary law crimes that are fabricated for 
political or other unlawful motives. 
(7) According to the Justice Manual of the 
United States Department of Justice, ‘‘[i]n 
the United States, national law prohibits the 
arrest of the subject of a Red Notice issued 
by another INTERPOL member country, 
based upon the notice alone’’ and requires 
the existence of a valid extradition treaty 
between the requesting country and the 
United States, a valid request for provisional 
arrest of the subject individual, and an ar-
rest warrant issued by a United States Dis-
trict Court based on a complaint filed by the 
United States Attorney’s Office of the sub-
ject jurisdiction. 
SEC. 1703. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States: 
(1) To use the voice, vote, and influence of 
the United States, as appropriate, within 
INTERPOL’s General Assembly and Execu-
tive Committee to promote the following ob-
jectives aimed at improving the trans-
parency of INTERPOL and ensuring its oper-
ation consistent with its Constitution, par-
ticularly articles 2 and 3, and Rules on the 
Processing of Data: 
(A) Support INTERPOL’s reforms enhanc-
ing the screening process for Notices, Diffu-
sions, and other INTERPOL communications 
to ensure they comply with INTERPOL’s 
Constitution and Rules on the Processing of 
Data (RPD). 
(B) Support and strengthen INTERPOL’s 
coordination with the Commission for Con-
trol of INTERPOL’s Files (CCF) in cases in 
which INTERPOL or the CCF has determined 
that a member country issued a Notice, Dif-
fusion, or other INTERPOL communication 
against an individual in violation of articles 
2 or 3 of the INTERPOL Constitution, or the 
RPD, to prohibit such member country from 
seeking the publication or issuance of any 
subsequent Notices, Diffusions, or other 
INTERPOL communication against the same 
individual based on the same set of claims or 
facts. 
(C) Support candidates for positions within 
INTERPOL’s structures, including the Presi-
dency, Executive Committee, General Secre-
tariat, and CCF who have demonstrated ex-
perience relating to and respect for the rule 
of law. 
(D) Seek to require INTERPOL in its an-
nual report to provide a detailed account of 
the following information, disaggregated by 
member country or entity: 
(i) 
The 
number 
of 
Notice 
requests, 
disaggregated by color, that it received. 
(ii) 
The 
number 
of 
Notice 
requests, 
disaggregated by color, that it rejected. 
(iii) The category of violation identified in 
each instance of a rejected Notice. 
(iv) The number of Diffusions that it can-
celled without reference to decisions by the 
CCF. 
(v) The sources of all INTERPOL income 
during the reporting period. 
(E) Support greater transparency by the 
CCF in its annual report by providing a de-
tailed account of the following information, 
disaggregated by country: 
(i) The number of admissible requests for 
correction or deletion of data received by the 
CCF regarding issued Notices, Diffusions, 
and other INTERPOL communications. 
(ii) The category of violation alleged in 
each such complaint. 
(2) Put in place procedures, as appropriate, 
for sharing with relevant departments and 
agencies credible information of likely at-
tempts 
by 
member 
countries 
to 
abuse 
INTERPOL communications for politically 
motivated or other unlawful purposes so 
that, as appropriate, action can be taken in 
accordance with their respective institu-
tional mandates.

partments or agencies took in response to 
these incidents.

admitted for permanent residence in the 
United States, aliens who are lawfully 
present in the United States, or aliens with 
pending asylum, withholding of removal, or 
convention against torture claims, though 
they may be unlawfully present in the 
United States. 
(8) An estimate of the costs involved in es-
tablishing such improvements. 
(c) FORM OF REPORT.—Each report required 
by subsection (a) shall be submitted in un-

SEC. 1711. SHORT TITLES. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Coun-
tering 
Russian 
and 
Other 
Overseas 
Kleptocracy Act’’ or the ‘‘CROOK Act’’. 
SEC. 1712. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Authoritarian leaders in foreign coun-
tries abuse their power to steal assets from 
state institutions, enrich themselves at the 
expense of their countries’ economic devel-
opment, and use corruption as a strategic 
tool both to solidify their grip on power and 
to 
undermine 
democratic 
institutions 
abroad. 
(2) Global corruption harms the competi-
tiveness of United States businesses, weak-
ens democratic governance, feeds terrorist 
recruitment and transnational organized 
crime, enables drug smuggling and human 
trafficking, and stymies economic growth. 
(3) Illicit financial flows often penetrate 
countries through what appear to be legiti-
mate financial transactions, as kleptocrats 
launder money, use shell companies, amass 
offshore wealth, and participate in a global 
shadow economy. 
(4) The Government of the Russian Federa-
tion is a leading model of this type of 
kleptocratic system, using state-sanctioned 
corruption to both erode democratic govern-
ance from within and discredit democracy 
abroad, thereby strengthening the authori-
tarian rule of Vladimir Putin. 
(5) Corrupt individuals and entities in the 
Russian Federation, often with the backing 
and encouragement of political leadership, 
use stolen money— 
(A) to purchase key assets in other coun-
tries, often with a goal of attaining monopo-
listic control of a sector; 
(B) to gain access to and influence the poli-
cies of other countries; and 
(C) to advance Russian interests in other 
countries, particularly those that undermine 
confidence and trust in democratic systems. 
(6) Systemic corruption in the People’s Re-
public of China, often tied to, directed by, or 
backed by the leadership of the Chinese 
Communist Party and the Chinese Govern-
ment is used— 
(A) to provide unfair advantage to certain 
People’s Republic of China economic enti-
ties; 
(B) to increase other countries’ economic 
dependence on the People’s Republic of 
China to secure greater deference to the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China’s diplomatic and 
strategic goals; and 
(C) to exploit corruption in foreign govern-
ments and among other political elites to en-
able People’s Republic of China state-backed 
firms to pursue predatory and exploitative 
economic practices. 
(7) Thwarting these tactics by Russian, 
Chinese, and other kleptocratic actors re-
quires 
the 
international 
community 
to 
strengthen democratic governance and the 
rule of law. International cooperation in 
combating corruption and illicit finance is 
vital to such efforts, especially by empow-
ering reformers in foreign countries during 
historic political openings for the establish-
ment of the rule of law in those countries. 
(8) Technical assistance programs that 
combat corruption and strengthen the rule 
of law, including through assistance provided 
by the Department of State’s Bureau of 
International Narcotics and Law Enforce-
ment Affairs and the United States Agency 
for International Development, and through 
programs like the Department of Justice’s 
Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Develop-
ment, Assistance and Training and the Inter-
national Criminal Investigative Training As-
sistance Program, can have lasting and sig-
nificant impacts for both foreign and United 
States interests. 
(9) There currently exist numerous inter-
national instruments to combat corruption, 
kleptocracy, and illicit finance, including— 
(A) the Inter-American Convention against 
Corruption of the Organization of American 
States, done at Caracas March 29, 1996; 
(B) the Convention on Combating Bribery 
of Foreign Public Officials in International 
Business Transactions of the Organisation of 
Economic Co-operation and Development, 
done at Paris December 21, 1997 (commonly 
referred to as the ‘‘Anti-Bribery Conven-
tion’’); 
(C) the United Nations Convention against 
Transnational Organized Crime, done at New 
York November 15, 2000; 
(D) the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption, done at New York October 31, 
2003;

Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Pub-
lic Officials in International Business Trans-

SEC. 704. TREATMENT FOR EATING DISORDERS 
FOR 
MEMBERS 
OF 
THE 
ARMED 
FORCES AND DEPENDENTS OF MEM-
BERS OF THE UNIFORMED SERV-
ICES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Eating disorders affect approximately 
30,000,000 individuals in the United States, or 
nine percent of the population, during their 
lifetime, including individuals from every 
age, gender, body size, race, ethnicity, and 
socioeconomic status. 
(2) Eating disorders are severe, biologically 
based mental illnesses caused by a complex 
interaction of genetic, biological, social, be-
havioral, and psychological factors. 
(3) Eating disorders result in the second 
highest case fatality rate of any psychiatric 
illness, with one death every 52 minutes as a 
direct result of an eating disorder due to se-
rious medical comorbidities and suicide. 
(4) Untreated eating disorders cost the 
economy of the United States $64,700,000,000 
annually, with individuals and their families 
experiencing 
an 
economic 
loss 
of 
$23,500,000,000 annually. 
(5) A study from the Armed Forces Health 
Surveillance Branch found that diagnoses of 
eating disorders among military personnel 
increased by 26 percent from 2013 to 2016. 
(6) Although accurate estimates are chal-
lenging due to underreporting, the preva-
lence of eating disorders among members of 
the Armed Forces is two to three times high-
er than in the civilian population. 
(7) The Defense Health Board found that 
women members of the Armed Forces on ac-
tive duty experience high rates of eating dis-
orders, which can adversely affect the readi-
ness and health of such members. 
(8) Risk factors for eating disorders among 
members of the Armed Forces include pres-
sure to maintain weight and fitness stand-
ards, trauma, sexual harassment, weight 
stigmatization, and post-traumatic stress 
disorder. 
(9) Family members of members of the 
Armed Forces have a higher prevalence of 
eating disorders than the general population, 
with 21 percent of children and 26 percent of 
spouses of members of the Armed Forces 
found to be at risk of developing an eating 
disorder. 
(10) Research demonstrates a strong cor-
relation in the risk of developing an eating 
disorder between a military spouse and their 
adolescent child. An adolescent female de-
pendent of a member of the Armed Forces is 
more likely to be at risk for an eating dis-
order if their nonmilitary parent is at risk 
for an eating disorder. 
(b) TREATMENT FOR EATING DISORDERS FOR 
DEPENDENTS OF MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED 
SERVICES.—Section 1079 of title 10, United 
States Code, is amended— 
(1) in subsection (a), by adding at the end 
the following new paragraph: 
‘‘(18) Treatment for an eating disorder may 
be provided in accordance with subsection 
(r).’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following new 
subsection: 
‘‘(r)(1) The provision of health care services 
for an eating disorder under subsection 
(a)(18) shall include treatment at facilities 
providing the following services: 
‘‘(A) Inpatient services, including residen-
tial services. 
‘‘(B) Outpatient services for in-person and 
telehealth care, including— 
‘‘(i) Partial hospitalization services; and 
‘‘(ii) Intensive outpatient services. 
‘‘(2) A dependent may be provided health 
care services for an eating disorder under 
subsection (a)(18) without regard to the age 
of the dependent, except with respect to resi-
dential services under paragraph (1)(A), 
which may be provided only to a dependent 
who is not eligible for hospital insurance 
benefits under part A of title XVIII of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq.). 
‘‘(3) In this section, the term ‘eating dis-
order’ has the meaning given the term ‘feed-
ing and eating disorders’ in the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
5th Edition (or successor edition), published 
by the American Psychiatric Association.’’. 
(c) IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF EAT-
ING DISORDERS FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED 
FORCES.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Section 1090 of title 10, 
United States Code, is amended—

shipman who becomes a mother while en-
rolled, including remaining enrolled in ac-
cordance with a family care plan established 
pursuant to paragraph (3) or selecting one of

RECOGNIZING 
SERGEANT 
DON 
FINK, 
RECIPIENT 
OF 
TEXAS’ 
THIRD 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DIS-
TRICT 2021 CONGRESSIONAL VET-
ERAN COMMENDATION 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor fifteen distinguished mili-
tary veterans from Texas’ Third Congressional 
District who answered the call to serve their 
Nation honorably, both in uniform and fol-
lowing their return to civilian life. The recipi-
ents of the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation exemplify the timehonored qualities 
of patriotism, service before self, and bold 
leadership. Following their time in service, 
their efforts in our community have earned 
these fine individuals recognition as the recipi-
ents of this prestigious commendation. Their 
stories of sacrifice will encourage future gen-
erations to pursue a life dedicated to the very 
values we cherish as Americans: faith, free-
dom, and democracy. One such hero is Ser-
geant Don Fink of Frisco, Texas. 
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Don Fink moved to 
Texas early in life where he graduated from 
Richardson High School. From a young age, 
Don’s father, a World War II veteran, instilled 
in him a keen awareness that our country’s 
freedoms were at risk. In 1968, a 20-year-old 
Fink would enlist as an Infantryman in the 
U.S. Army. He was assigned to Chu Lai, Viet-
nam where his contributions in building the 
strategically important LZ Maryanne would ulti-
mately keep the enemy from advancing on 
American troops and in due course save thou-
sands of soldiers’ lives. 
Sergeant Fink’s awards include a Bronze 
Star, Army Commendation Medal, National 
Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service 
Medal, Overseas Service Bar, Vietnam Cam-
paign Medal, Army Sharpshooter Marksman-
ship Badge, Expert Marksmanship Medal, and 
Combat Infantry Badge. 
Upon his return to civilian life, Don would 
begin employment with United Parcel Service 
(UPS) where he would eventually manage 
several statewide regional centers. After grad-
uating from the University of Texas at Arling-
ton, Don would establish his own successful 
staffing and recruiting business. 
Today, Don has become known as a widely 
respected and beloved advocate on behalf of 
our veterans. As an active member of the Fris-
co Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 
8273 he is deeply admired as the current 
Chaplain. In addition to attending funerals, 
tending to the sick and needy, as well as 
those in crisis, Don has been known to per-
sonally drive veterans to service officer ap-
pointments for benefits counseling. As the 
proud father of two children and two grand-
children, Don currently resides in Frisco with 
his beloved dog, Bella. Sergeant Don Fink is 
a stranger to none and continues to exemplify 
the spirit of this award through his willingness 
to help those in need. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Sergeant 
Fink for his exceptional service and congratu-
lates him on this recognition. May his stead-
fast example of leadership inspire others to 
live a life of service to a cause greater than 
themselves. It is my extreme honor to award 
him the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for the Third District of Texas.

DALTON DAVEY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dalton Davey also known 
as Dr. Derpster of Northglenn, Colorado for re-
ceiving the City of Northglenn Young Entre-
preneur Award. 
The Young Entrepreneur Award is given to 
a Northglenn student that has displayed entre-
preneurial 
prowess 
and 
has 
stood 
out 
amongst their peers. This year’s award goes 
to the YouTuber, Dr. Derpster. This young 
man has brought joy to hundreds of sub-
scribers each week as he plays many of the 
most popular video games. This knack for en-
tertainment is impressive, and I encourage 
him to continue to bring joy to people in all as-
pects of his life. 
Dr. Derpster represents some of the bright-
est youths that Northglenn has to offer. It is a 
testament to the schools in our community for 
fostering such a comprehensive learning envi-
ronment. I wish him nothing but the best in the 
future and congratulate him on winning this 
award.

HONORING 
THE 
150TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF HUEBER BREUER 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 150th Anniversary of Hueber 
Breuer, a legacy construction firm in Central 
New York that has developed and built some 
of the most impactful projects in the region. 
Since its founding in 1872, Hueber Breuer 
has remained a family-run business and is 
currently led by its fifth and sixth generations. 
Today, it is the largest, continuously operating, 
family-owned construction and contracting firm 
in Central New York. 
In its 150 years of operation, Hueber Breuer 
has played a key role in developing the City 
of Syracuse and Central New York. The com-
pany has helped build and restore many of the 
landmarks that define our skylines, such as 
the Landmark Theater, the Franklin Center, 
the Samaritan Center, and the Exposition 
Center at the New York State Fairgrounds. 
For the firm’s stellar work. Hueber Breuer has 
received numerous awards including the Asso-
ciated General Contractors of New York Safe-
ty Award, the American General Contractors 
Build New York Award, and the Preservation 
Association of Central New York Award of 
Merit. 
Aside from its construction projects, Hueber 
Breuer also aims to revitalize Central New 
York through philanthropic endeavors. These

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MICHAEL COLLINS 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Michael Collins. 
His unwavering sense of conviction and out-
standing public service to his community 
earned him respect and admiration from those 
who knew him and anyone he crossed paths 
with. 
The state of Florida recognizes his success 
as the champion of the Greater Everglades 
ecosystem from Orlando to the Keys. His 
leadership on the South Florida Water Man-
agement Board for over a decade has tangibly 
benefited the lives of tens-of-millions Florid-
ians. His advocacy for Florida Bay, Lake 
Okeechobee as well as the Upper Chain of 
Lakes was heard and acted upon. 
Michael Collins had the unique ability to 
unite various stakeholders to implement con-
sensus solutions to complex water resource 
issues. He was the father of the creation of 
the Water Resource Advisory Commission to 
carry out this mission. His grand contributions 
cannot be measured. He was always attentive 
to his community and gave it his all. 
Michael Collins will be remembered for his 
lifelong contributions and dedication to Flor-
ida’s water resources. Captain Mike will be 
missed at the helm, however, his ‘‘troops’’ will 
carry on the mission. It’s an honor to com-
memorate a man of this stature and integrity. 
Michael Collins will be profoundly missed. 
God bless.

RECOGNIZING SERGEANT WILLIAM 
‘‘BILL’’ 
HENRY, 
RECIPIENT 
OF 
TEXAS’ THIRD CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
2021 
CONGRESSIONAL 
VETERAN COMMENDATION 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor fifteen distinguished mili-
tary veterans from Texas’ Third Congressional 
District who answered the call to serve their 
Nation honorably, both in uniform and fol-
lowing their return to civilian life. The recipi-
ents of the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation exemplify the time-honored quali-
ties of patriotism, service before self, and bold 
leadership. Following their time in service, 
their efforts in our community have earned 
these fine individuals recognition as the recipi-
ents of this prestigious commendation. Their 
stories of sacrifice will encourage future gen-
erations to pursue a life dedicated to the very 
values we cherish as Americans: faith, free-
dom, and democracy. One such hero is Ser-
geant William ‘‘Bill’’ Henry of Wylie, Texas. 
Drafted into the U.S. Army in 1952, Bill 
Henry was trained as a Combat Radio Relay 
Operator. While stationed in Korea, Sergeant 
Henry controlled an Artillery Battery, radioing 
coordinates for artillery shells to be discharged 
at enemy targets. Bill ended his active duty 
service in 1954, but would complete eight 
years in the Army Reserves prior to his final 
discharge. Sergeant Henry credits his time on 
the front lines with preparing him for a suc-
cessful career in electronics and computers 
following the war. 
For his service, Sergeant Henry was award-
ed the Korean Service Medal, two Bronze 
Stars, United Nations Service Medal, National 
Defense Service Medal, Sharpshooter Badge, 
and Good Conduct Medal. 
Following his time in service, Bill returned 
home and married the love of his life, the late 
Jane Donovan Henry. Together they raised six 
children. Bill’s commitment to his community is 
evidenced by his 72-year tenure in the Knights 
of Columbus where he has held almost every 
single office including that of Grand Knight. Bill 
maintains a deep passion for supporting our 
veterans and he has done so through the 
Wheelchair Mission which supplies wheel-
chairs to our veterans at the VA Medical Cen-
ters in Bonham and Dallas, Texas. Addition-
ally, Sergeant Henry was instrumental in es-
tablishing the American Legion Hale-Combest 
Post 315 in Wylie where he held the position 
of Judge Advocate. 
Even at 91 years old, Mr. Henry has not 
slowed his efforts to serve his community. 
Love of God, family, and country, and a life 
dedicated to service sum up the character of 
Sergeant Henry whom we applaud for his 
longtime commitment to America and our 
community. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Sergeant 
Henry, for his exceptional service and con-
gratulates him on this recognition. May his 
steadfast example of leadership inspire others 
to live a life of service to a cause greater than 
themselves. It is my extreme honor to award 
him the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for the Third District of Texas.

RECOGNIZING THE VETERANS 
AIRLIFT COMMAND 
HON. JAY OBERNOLTE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the outstanding service of 
the Veteran Airlift Command, an organization 
which I’ve volunteered with for many years 
that has a dedicated network of volunteers 
working to support our nation’s wounded war-
riors across the country. 
The Veteran Airlift Command, founded by 
Vietnam War veteran Walter Fricke, has im-
pacted the lives of countless wounded vet-
erans by providing them and their families air 
transportation when they desperately need it. 
After being wounded while serving as a heli-
copter pilot in Vietnam, Walter, like countless 
other wounded veterans, had to face the chal-
lenges presented by everyday civilian life. He 
realized that despite commercial air travel con-
stituting one of the most essential aspects of 
modern life, it was among the most inacces-
sible, especially for our wounded veterans. 
As a military trained pilot with over 800 
hours of combat flying, Walter was well 
equipped to remedy this issue. He had an 
idea for a national organization of volunteer pi-
lots and aircraft that would fly wounded war-
riors and their families with dignity, respect, 
and gratitude, and so in 2006 he founded the 
Veteran Airlift Command. 
Walter started the Veterans Airlift Command 
with his own personal finances, flying exper-
tise, and aircraft, but today the Veterans Airlift 
Command has grown into substantial program 
that boasts a volunteer core of over 2,600 vol-
unteer pilots and aircraft with over 18,000 pas-
sengers successfully flown. 
The VAC has been and will continue to be 
an incredible and essential lifeline for wound-
ed veterans and their families. Thanks to their 
work and that of thousands of volunteer pilots 
across the country, we can give back to our 
nation’s wounded warriors and provide the 
dignity, respect, and comfort that our heroes 
deserve. I am honored to recognize the VAC 
today and proud to have the opportunity to 
volunteer with this organization and give back 
to those who have sacrificed part of them-
selves in the defense of this Nation.

FIT THEOREM 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Fit Theorem of Northglenn, 
Colorado for earning the City of Northglenn’s 
People’s Choice Award. 
The People’s Choice Award recognizes a 
Northglenn business for their customer service 
and customer satisfaction within the commu-
nity. Fit Theorem is known for being one of 
Colorado’s premier kickboxing studios. Their 
mission is to improve the lives of clients by 
making them healthier in both mind and body. 
With several locations across the state and 
country, Northglenn is lucky to have one of 
their studios in our community. During the 
COVID–19 pandemic, the team at Fit Theorem 
moved many of their classes on line and con-
tinue to bring fitness and fun to people during 
a difficult time. 
Congratulations again to Fit Theorem for 
this accomplishment, and I wish them all the 
best in the future. I thank them for their con-
tribution to our community.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF PASTOR 
JEREMY DAVID SMITH 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in remembrance of Pastor Jeremy David 
Smith. Jeremy spent over 20 years as a lead-
er and minister in local churches. He strove to 
create a family environment that shared both 
the challenging and celebratory times with the 
members of the church. 
Pastor Jeremy was devout to his congrega-
tion and he was dedicated to continue Sunday 
Worship throughout the pandemic. He held 
outside services and worked to ensure the 
safe and comfortable experience for all mem-
bers of the church, especially caring for the 
older members so they would be able to at-
tend, experience, and hear the Word of God, 
no matter what. 
David is survived by his wife, Audra Smith; 
children, Nicholas, Logan, Katiana, Kalista, 
and Korinna Smith. Madam. Speaker, I ask 
that you extend your thoughts and prayers to 
Jeremy’s family and friends as they mourn the 
loss of their loved one. I pray that God is with 
Jeremy’s family and friends during this difficult 
time.

Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate a member of our Greatest Genera-
tion and Florida’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict, Larkin V. ‘‘Pete’’ Bowen of Marianna, 
Florida. 
Born October 24, 1921, Mr. Bowen moved 
to Wewahitchka, Florida with his family in 
1941 to build a new life. 
Like so many in the Panhandle during that 
time, he found work anywhere he could. 
In 1943, Mr. Bowen started working for the 
State Road Department, now the Florida De-
partment of Transportation, in Jackson County 
as a road crew guard.

He later moved to Marianna in the 1950s 
with his beloved wife Orianna and three chil-
dren. 
During his 42 years working for the state, 
Pete paved most of the roads across north 
Florida and maintained a small farm to provide 
for his family. 
From shucking oysters to delivering the 
‘‘Pensacola News Journal’’ on Sundays, Mr. 
Bowen made sure there was enough money 
to see his children succeed. 
In his community, Pete is known for his gen-
erosity and unwavering faith. 
He has been a pillar among both the New 
Hope Baptist and Trinity Baptist and has self-
lessly helped with repairs and upkeep at both 
churches. 
Mr. Bowen is also known for sharing his 
crops with neighbors and lending a helping 
hand to any fellow farmer who needs one. 
Today, Pete Bowen has eight grandchildren, 
10 great-grandchildren, and four great-great- 
grandchildren. 
Throughout his lifetime, Mr. Bowen has 
turned his two acres into thirty and has built a 
long-lasting legacy. 
Stories like his are what truly makes Flor-
ida’s Second District so great. 
Please join me in wishing Mr. Bowen a 
happy 100th birthday.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA FLOOD PREVEN-
TION ACT OF 2021 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the District of Columbia Flood Preven-
tion Act of 2021. The bill would amend the 
Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 
(CZMA) to include the nation’s capital in the 
definition of ‘‘coastal state.’’ Senator TOM CAR-
PER, the Chairman of the Environment and 
Public Works Committee, has introduced the 
companion bill in the Senate. Our bill would 
correct an apparent oversight in the omission 
of the District of Columbia from the CZMA by 
making the District eligible to receive federal 
funding and oversight for federally issued per-
mits, facilities and actions that affect our 
coastal waters. The District urgently needs the 
protection of the CZMA because of serious 
flood risks that currently affect federal assets, 
residents and businesses, including the Na-
tional Mall and the cluster of downtown federal 
agencies. 
Congress has authorized a number of pro-
grams to help states and territories respond to 
floods and mitigate risk through resiliency 
projects. An effort to reduce coastal flood risk, 
the CZMA provides planning and technical 
services to assist states in protecting, restor-
ing and developing coastal communities and 
resources. Once the federal government ap-
proves a state’s coastal management plan, the 
state becomes eligible for grants. Federal ac-
tions must be consistent with the state plans 
and vice versa. 
Even though the District, including the fed-
eral complex, is located on two rivers, and has 
suffered substantial coastal floods in the past, 
it was omitted from the list of eligible states 
and territories in the CZMA. It is notable that 
under Section 304 of the CZMA, ‘‘coastal 
state[s]’’ include the states and U.S. territories 
(Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands, the Trust Territories of the Pacific Is-
lands and American Samoa). Because terri-
tories are included in the definition of ‘‘coastal 
states’’ while D.C. is absent, it appears that 
D.C.’s omission is a mistake, which only Con-
gress can correct. This oversight likely oc-
curred because the CZMA was passed in 
1972, which was before the District achieved 
home rule. 
Scientists have predicted that the tides on 
the Atlantic Coast could rise two to four feet 
by the year 2100, causing property worth as 
much as $7 billion in the District to be rou-
tinely under threat by floodwaters. This dam-
age includes private homes and businesses 
and the National Mall, federal buildings and 
three military bases located in the District. The 
Anacostia and Potomac Rivers, which sur-
round the District, are tidally influenced, part of 
an ‘‘intertidal zone’’ between high and low 
maritime tides. In addition, the Maryland and 
Virginia coastal zones each include the tidal 
Potomac River, with Maryland’s zone ending 
at the District line. 
I initially offered the D.C. Flood Prevention 
Act in a previous Congress. The bill passed 
the House as part of the Coastal and Great 
Lakes Communities Enhancement Act. And 
again, last month, the House Committee on 
Natural Resources passed this bill as part of 
the Ocean-Based Climate Solutions Act of 
2021, Chairman RAUL M. GRIJALVA’s effort to 
modernize federal ocean management policy 
to account for climate change. 
The District should be eligible under the 
CZMA just like the states and territories al-
ready listed in the CZMA. I urge support for 
this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL 
VETERAN COMMENDATION 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor fifteen distinguished mili-
tary veterans from Texas’ Third Congressional 
District who answered the call to serve their 
Nation honorably, both in uniform and fol-
lowing their return to civilian life. The recipi-
ents of the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-

stories of sacrifice will encourage future gen-
erations to pursue a life dedicated to the very 
values we cherish as Americans: faith, free-
dom, and democracy. One such hero is Cap-
tain Michael Carathers of Lucas, Texas. 
Originally from Amarillo, Texas, Captain Mi-
chael Carathers enlisted in the U.S. Naval Re-
serves in 1967, after which time he earned a 
Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engi-
neering from Texas Tech University. Along the 
way he would serve as a division petty officer 
at NAVCOMSTA Lululei Hawaii providing com-
munications from the U.S. mainland to Viet-
nam and recovery communications for the 
Apollo program for NASA. Following a direct 
commission as an Engineering Duty Officer, 
he would perform a variety of duties on the 
USS Bataan and USS Blue Ridge. Captain 
Carathers would go on to command two re-
serve units and serve as the Executive Officer 
for two additional units. 
Due to his dedicated service, Captain 
Carathers earned the Navy and Marine Corps 
Medal, Navy Reserve Meritorious Medal, Na-
tional Defense Services Medal, Armed Forced 
Reserve Medal, and Global War on Terrorism 
Medal, as well as various unit awards. 
Following his military career, Mike was em-
ployed as a Principal Systems Engineer on 
military programs for Raytheon from which he 
retired in 2011. Captain Carathers would go 
on to serve on the Reserve Officers Associa-
tion Board of Directors for the local chapter 
and was selected as Texas Department Presi-
dent and Vice President. His commitment to 
our military and veterans is strongly evidenced 
by his role as Committee Chairman for the 
North Texas Military Foundation Ball where his 
advocacy efforts have generated tremendous 
support for our active duty, reserve, and re-
tired military members and veterans. 
Captain Carathers and his wife, Cheryl, 
have three children and six grandchildren with 
whom they have instilled a sense of service 
before self. His deep passion for serving our 
military community with a patriotic and unwav-
ering heart is to be commended as he con-
tinues to display servant leadership. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Captain 
Carathers for his exceptional service and con-
gratulates him on this recognition. May his 
steadfast example of leadership inspire others 
to live a life of service to a cause greater than 
themselves. It is my extreme honor to award 
him the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for the Third District of Texas.

Violence 
Awareness 
Month and to share our collective recommit-

Each October, we remember all those lost 
to and scarred by domestic violence, a tragic 
continuing scourge that cuts across all bound-
aries. Long after we have said goodbyes, long 
after physical wounds have healed, the psy-
chological and social consequences continue 
and magnify. Domestic violence truly touches 
each and all of us. 
Tragically, COVID–19 has magnified this 
challenge. In my home state of Hawaii, the 
Domestic Violence Action Center saw hotline 
calls increase by 188 percent from February 
2020 to 2021. Survivors are further cut off 
from activities that allow them to escape an 
abusive environment, such as work or school, 
and domestic violence organizations face chal-
lenges in reaching survivors or providing serv-
ices.

such as the Hawaii State Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence and the some twenty other

There is so much work to be done still in

for anyone experiencing, witnessing or sus-

The Investment Award is given to a busi-

sonal injury attorneys in our community, help-
ing people receive the best possible medical 
care possible while ensuring insurance com-
panies pay fairly. 
Dr. Ramos’s devotion to our community is

HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the service of J.D. Grom, the 
longest-serving Executive Director of the New 
Democrat Coalition. 
J.D. departs Capitol Hill this month to con-
tinue his federal service as an appointee in 
the Biden Administration, but he leaves behind 
a legacy of sound management and strong 
leadership that will serve the Coalition for 
years to come. 
NewDems occupy an important place within 
the Democratic Caucus. We are the center of 
gravity for the House Democrats and an incu-
bator for some of the best, most forward-lean-
ing policy-making on Capitol Hill. 
None of that happened by accident. J.D. led 
the NewDems with a steady hand and a stra-
tegic vision that positioned the Members of 
this Coalition to make real, substantive, and 
lasting imprints on the legislative output in the 
House of Representatives. 
Under J.D.’s leadership, NewDems were 
firmly at the center of the work to shape this 
21st century economy. Whether speaking out 
on trade or the ever-evolving future of work in 
America, NewDems delivered meaningful pol-
icy prescriptions and helped put kitchen-table 
issues front and center for this institution. 
NewDems are known for working across 
ideologies and party lines to deliver results. 
But more than that, we’ve also become a 
home for thoughtful, measured leaders who 
have had enough of the shouting and division 
that too often defines our politics. 
J.D. embodied that NewDem spirit as a self-
less leader and mentor throughout his career. 
That includes his work on behalf of his home-
town Representative, Melissa Bean of Illinois, 
his work at the Department of the Treasury, 
and service on behalf of four separate Chairs 
of the New Democrat Coalition, including me, 
Rep. RON KIND, Rep. JIM HIMES, and Rep. 
DEREK KILMER. 
On behalf of our entire 95-Member Coali-
tion, I thank J.D. for his service, both past and 
future, and wish him all the best.

Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of the Yemeni American Chamber 
of Commerce (YACC) for their work on behalf 
of the Yemeni American small business com-
munity in southeastern Michigan. 
Over thirty thousand Yemeni Americans live 
in Michigan, with a significant number residing 
in Wayne County. Many Yemeni immigrants 
were drawn to the area by work in automotive 
factories and have established their roots 
here. Immigration to Michigan is still occurring, 
with some studies indicating that Yemenis 
comprise nine percent of the area’s Arab pop-
ulation and that Yemeni community have 
some of the largest families. However, the 
Yemeni community has some of the lowest 
rate of business ownership, only three percent 
compared to twenty percent for other Arab 
groups. 
This is why YACC is critical to our commu-
nity. YACC has established a strong network 
for the small business community. They en-
courage growth through education and train-
ing, as well as collaboration among its mem-
ber businesses. Beyond that, YACC works to 
create business owners who are also commu-
nity leaders. They encourage their members to 
become actively engaged community partners 
who are truly the backbone of the local econ-
omy. 
Please join me in recognizing the many out-
standing contributions of the Yemeni American 
Chamber of Commerce on behalf of the com-

assigned to operations in the Gulf of Tonkin 
aboard the USS Cimarron. As a communica-
tions specialist, he was responsible for direct-
ing replenishment activities including dealing 
with classified cargo supplies for aircraft car-
riers and their escorts. Following two tours of 
duty in Vietnam, Richard served on assign-
ments with SEAL Team 119 and ultimately re-
tired in 1986. 
Chief Petty Officer Lerma earned the Na-
tional Defense Service Medal, 20 Year Good 
Conduct Medal, Navy Sharpshooter w/E, Viet-
nam Service Medal with two Bronze Stars, 
Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm Unit Cita-
tion Badge, and numerous unit awards and 
service ribbons. 
Following service, Richard attended the San 
Diego Academy and was later appointed to 
the Federal Law Enforcement Academy. His 
role would lead him to an assignment at the 
International Border and a promotion to a 
K–9 Narcotic Enforcement Officer dealing with 
international smugglers, human traffickers, and 
undercover operations with various federal 
agencies. Following 9/11, Lerma was trans-
ferred to Customs and Border Protection 
where he would work until his retirement in 
2014. 
Mr. Lerma has earned a reputation as a re-
spected member of our local veterans commu-
nity and has worked tirelessly to assist vet-
erans with education and relief programs. 
Richard is an active member of Vietnam Vet-
erans of America, the American Legion, Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, and the Collin County 
Veterans Coalition. He also dedicates his time 
to assisting with two prison ministries where 
he visits incarcerated military inmates who 
have lost their way. Richard Lerma has led a 
tremendous life of service to our county and is 
to be commended for his many efforts. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Chief Petty 
Officer Lerma for his exceptional service and 
congratulates him on this recognition. May his 
steadfast example of leadership inspire others 
to live a life of service to a cause greater than 
themselves. It is my extreme honor to award 
him the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for the Third District of Texas.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF 
SERGEANT 
GINGER 
GERSBACHER 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the career of Senior Master Ser-
geant D. Ginger Gersbacher, who retired from 
the United States Air Force (USAF) on July 
29, 2021 after more than 29 years of military 
service. 
A native of Central New York and graduate 
of C.W. Baker High School and the State Uni-
versity of New York at Morrisville, Sergeant 
Gersbacher enlisted into the New York Air Na-
tional Guard in June 1992. After completing 
basic training as well as technical school train-
ing as an Instrument and Flight Control Sys-
tems Specialist, she returned to Syracuse in 
January 1993 to serve in the 174th Attack 
Wing. Within the unit, Sergeant Gersbacher 
served as an Avionics Technician with the Air-
craft Maintenance Squadron, and later accept-
ed a part time position in the Maintenance Op-
erations Center. While serving in these posi-
tions, Sergeant Gersbacher also returned to 
school to complete a Baccalaureate Degree in 
Computer Science from Columbia College, 
graduating Summa Cum Laude. 
Later, Sergeant Gersbacher was deployed 
and supported combat missions, participating 
in Operation Provide Comfort, Operation 
Northern Watch, and Operation Southern 
Watch. Following the September 11, 2001 ter-
rorist attacks, she volunteered for active duty 
and served with the 174th Attack Wing of the 
New York Air National Guard during Operation 
Noble Eagle, flying air patrol missions over 
New York City. Later, Sergeant Gersbacher 
reassigned as a maintenance analyst and was 
deployed three more times from 2006 to 2008, 
participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 
2014, Sergeant Gersbacher established the 
Inspector General Office of Inspections within 
the 174th Attack Wing at Hancock Field Air 
National Guard Base, and maintained her po-
sition in the Inspector General’s Office until 
her retirement. 
For her service, Sergeant Gersbacher has 
earned numerous awards including the Meri-
torious Service Medal, the Air Force Com-
mendation Medal, and the Air Force Achieve-
ment Medal. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House to join me in recognizing Senior Master 
Sergeant Ginger Gersbacher for her nearly 
three decades of honorable service. I wish 
Sergeant Gersbacher the best in her retire-
ment.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RAYMOND 
MATTZ 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of the life of Raymond 
Mattz, who passed away at the age of 79 on 
September 2, 2021. Raymond was a revered 
elder of the Yurok Tribe who fought for his 
people’s fishing rights and their reservation, in-
cluding in a landmark case before the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
Raymond grew up in Requa, at the mouth 
of the Klamath River. Though his Yurok an-
cestors had signed a treaty with the U.S. gov-
ernment in 1855, it was not ratified, which led 
the state of California to open the Yurok Res-
ervation to white settlement in 1892. This 
meant tribal fishermen had to obtain permits to 
fish, which severely limited the catch that the 
Yurok people had depended on since time im-
memorial. After being cited by a game warden 
for fishing, Raymond contested his case in 
state court, and then finally in the U.S. Su-
preme Court in 1973. 
The Supreme Court overturned California’s 
assertion that the reservation was no longer 
Yurok country. Following the ruling, the state 
turned jurisdiction of the reservation to the fed-
eral government, which banned fishing outright 
and led to the salmon wars of 1978. Raymond 
was a leader among fishermen who continued 
to fish despite being targets of federal agents 
who often violently accosted them and con-
fiscated gear. His efforts helped lead to the 
establishment of the Yurok Tribe’s fishing 
rights on the Klamath River. Raymond also 
served on the Yurok Tribal Council and was a 
member of the Yurok Cultural and Natural Re-
sources committees. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you 
join me in extending condolences to Ray-
mond’s family, friends, and tribe; and in ex-
pressing our deep appreciation for his dec-
ades of contribution to tribal rights and the 
Yurok Tribe.

District who answered the call to serve their 
Nation honorably, both in uniform and fol-

In his post-military career, Daniels was an 
indispensable asset for program development 
and direction with Raytheon Defense Systems 
where he dealt with top secret programs cen-
tered on radar systems technology. 
As a tireless advocate for our veterans and 
military, Lieutenant Daniels has become a 
known leader in the Dallas Chapter of the Mili-
tary Order of the World Wars (MOWW), where 
he has assumed a variety of roles including 
Junior Vice Commander, Senior Vice Com-
mander, and as the current Commander. 
Never one to seek recognition, Chuck is often 
behind the scenes working on such initiatives 
including the Dallas Veterans Day Parade, 
Dallas Community Police Awards, and the Boy 
and Girl Scout Leadership Awards. As a direct 
result of his efforts, this year MOWW has 
been designated as the best large chapter, an 
international designation of which the organi-
zation is justifiably proud. Due to his leader-
ship, Chuck was awarded the coveted MOWW 
Gold Patrick Henry Medal. Lieutenant Daniels 
continually strives to exhibit service before self 
within our veterans community, making an in-
delible impression on those around him. For 
his efforts, we give him our unwavering grati-
tude. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Lieutenant 
Daniels for his exceptional service and con-
gratulates him on this recognition. May his 
steadfast example of leadership inspire others 
to live a life of service to a cause greater than 
themselves. It is my extreme honor to award 
him the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for the Third District of Texas.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE BOROUGH 
OF SAYREVILLE, NEW JERSEY 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Borough of Sayreville, New 
Jersey as it formally celebrates its centennial 
this year, after marking its 100th anniversary 
in 2020 during the COVID–19 pandemic. It is 
my honor to join with borough officials and 
residents in commemorating this significant 
milestone. 
Although established as a township in 1876 
after breaking away from South Amboy, 
Sayreville was incorporated as a borough in 
1920. Following Sayre and Fisher Company’s 
establishment of a post office in 1860, the 
name Sayreville became the commonly used 
term to reference the area. 
With its rich clay deposits and shoreline 
proximity to New York City, pottery and brick 
manufacturing was the backbone of the area’s 
early industrialization. The Sayre and Fisher 
Brick Company, operating from 1850 to 1969, 
was one of the state’s largest employers and 
supported the rapid growth of the community, 
from less than 2,000 residents in 1876, to over 
32,500 by the end of the 1960s. Materials 
made in Sayreville not only helped construct 
buildings throughout town, they were also 
used in the construction of the Empire State 
Building and Holland Tunnel. 
In 1968, Sayreville elected Peggy Kerr as 
Mayor, who proudly served as the first woman 
to hold the position in Sayreville’s history. In 
its centennial, the borough is governed by 
Mayor Victoria Kilpatrick, Council President 
Kevin Dalina, and council members Vincent 
Conti, Damon Enriquez, Michele Maher, Mary 
Novak and Donna Roberts. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope my col-
leagues will join me in marking the 100th anni-
versary of the Borough of Sayreville and cele-
brating its rich history.

HONORING THE LAUNCH OF 
MAJOR LEAGUE PICKLEBALL 
HON. ROGER WILLIAMS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to pay tribute to the launch of the inau-
gural season of Major League Pickleball 
(MLP) on November 5, 2021. I’m proud to say 
that MLP’s Season One will take place in 
Texas’ 25th Congressional District at Dream-
land in Dripping Springs, Texas, and it will fea-
ture eight MLP teams led by an accomplished 
list of owners: 
Discovery Warriors: Eric Kuo and Mike 
Meldman 
Pickle Ranchers: Bryan Sheffield and Tim 
Klitch 
Team Clean: West Hunt, Tim Berry and 
Navdeep Sooch 
Team Rally: John Raymond and Jim Toth 
ATX Pickleballers: Brene Brown, Steve Alley 
and Charles Kiley 
The Lions: Marc Lasry and James Blake 
Chimeras: Charles Attal and Charlie Walker 
Team BLQK: Richie Tuazon 
MLP will feature the world’s best female and 
male professional pickleball players, com-
peting in a unique format for the Pritchard 
Cup, named after the late U.S. Representative 
Joel Pritchard of Washington State, the inven-
tor of pickleball, 
The new league has two stated aims—to 
create a platform to showcase the world’s best 
professional pickleball players to pickleball 
fans worldwide; and to attract new people to 
pickleball. Pickleball is the fastest growing 
sport in America and already enjoyed by over 
4 million regular players, according to The 
Economist. 
MLP is the brainchild of Steve Kuhn, a 
noted 
business 
leader 
and 
entrepreneur 
whose passion and love of pickleball inspired 
him to found MLP in 2021. Kuhn’s goal is to 
spread pickleball as widely as possible to en-
sure children and adults from all walks of life 
will be able to play. 
I would like to express my support for the 
launch of the newly created Major League 
Pickleball and I wish them well in their inau-
gural season.

stories of sacrifice will encourage future gen-
erations to pursue a life dedicated to the very 
values we cherish as Americans: faith, free-
dom, and democracy. One such hero is Navy 
Seal Ryan Parrott of Allen, Texas. 
Originally from Detroit, Michigan, Ryan 
‘‘Birdman’’ Parrott enlisted in the U.S. Navy 
after watching the Twin Towers fall on Sep-
tember 11, 2001. Ryan served eight years as 
a Navy SEAL, attached to Team Seven. Dur-
ing his time in service, he completed three 
combat tours in Iraq prior to being assigned to 
Advanced Training Command as an instructor. 
In 2005, his life would forever change. While 
manning a gun turret of a Humvee in enemy 
territory, his vehicle was struck by an impro-
vised explosive device. Parrott was thrown 
from the vehicle and along with his team-
mates, suffered devastating burns and a long 
road to recovery. 
For his actions, Parrott was awarded the 
National Defense Service Medal, Global War 
on Terrorism Service Medal, Good Conduct 
Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement 
Medal w/Combat ‘‘V’’, Sea Service Deploy-
ment Ribbon, Iraqi Campaign Medal, Army 
and Navy Commendation Medals, and a Pur-
ple Heart. 
After his discharge, Ryan moved to Dallas 
and after connecting with other veterans who 
suffered similar injuries, he established Sons 
of the Flag in order to support those in the 
military community, first responders, and civil-
ians suffering from traumatic burns. Under his 
leadership, the organization has raised more 
than $5 million to assist burn victims and pro-
vide medical fellowships to facilitate research, 
development, and treatment. Ryan is also the 
Founder of the Bird’s Eye View Project which 
leverages extreme sports to raise awareness 
for the extreme needs of veterans and first re-
sponders. 
Ryan and his wife, Vlada, are the proud par-
ents of two sons named after the couple’s 
grandfathers, who also served in the military. 
Navy SEAL Ryan ‘‘Birdman’’ Parrott is a shin-
ing example of how he has used adversity to 
serve the community, particularly those who 
have experienced life altering injuries, as he 
empower others to lead a life on mission. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Mr. Parrott 
for his exceptional service and congratulates 
him on this recognition. May his steadfast ex-
ample of leadership inspire others to live a life 
of service to a cause greater than themselves. 
It is my extreme honor to award him the 2021 
Congressional Veteran Commendation for the 
Third District of Texas.

OCTOBER 
AS 
NA-
TIONAL WOMEN’S SMALL BUSI-
NESS MONTH 
HON. BRENDA L. LAWRENCE 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the month of October as 
National Women’s Small Business Month and 
recognize the accomplishments and impact of 
our women entrepreneurs and business own-
ers across the country. 
While women-owned businesses have faced 
setbacks due to the pandemic, they remain 
the fastest growing segment of our economy. 
Black and Brown women entrepreneurs are 
the main drivers of this growth, even though 
they are far more likely to also be the primary 
breadwinners and caregivers for their families. 
We must continue to invest in and support 
women business owners, especially Black and 
Brown women business owners, as we begin 
our economic recovery. 
I also want to recognize the 136 Women 
Business Centers nationwide, such as the 
Great Lakes Women’s Business Council which 
has done so much to support women-owned 
small businesses in my home state of Michi-
gan. In addition, I want to recognize the U.S. 
Small Business Administration, which has con-
tinued to provide resources to women-owned 
businesses in their 68 district offices. My dis-
trict is fortunate to host the U.S. Small Busi-
ness Administration’s Michigan district office. 
Businesses that have received support from 
these institutions are far more likely to suc-
ceed, and when women succeed, America 
succeeds. 
As we mark National Women’s Small Busi-
ness Month, on behalf of the United States of 
America, I salute all the women business own-
ers and women entrepreneurs for their vital 
contributions to our country.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MR. JAMES CHARLIE LANE 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the life and service of Mr. 
James Charlie Lane of White Pine, Ten-
nessee. J.C. was born on April 30, 1920 and 
celebrated his 101st birthday on April 30, 
2021. 
He was a Veteran of WWII and served in 
the Navy from March 1941 to August 1946. 
From 1940 to March 1941, he was an em-
ployee of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 
both Unicoi and the Sugarlands in his birth 
county, Sevier County. 
He volunteered and joined the Navy in 
March 1941 and was assigned to the USS Al-
bemarle, where he would qualify as an elec-
trician and would eventually be promoted to 
electrician first class. Volunteering for a new 
ship that was commissioned, he became a 
‘‘plank owner’’ on the Wasp by being one of 
the original crewmen. By 1944, the Wasp’s 
battles would include the islands of Marcus, 
Wake, Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Iwo Jima, Oki-
nawa, Leyte Gulf and the Japanese homeland. 
He arrived in Hawaii and then went to the 
Marshall Islands in May and saw his first ac-
tion in the Marshall Islands as part of Admiral 
Halsey’s fast carrier fleet at the Marianas. Dur-
ing his time in the Navy, he saw action in the 
European Theater, to the African Coast, to the 
Pacific Theater in the Philippines and the five- 
week long battle for Iwo Jima. His military 
service went on until almost a year after Armi-
stice Day when Japan formally surrendered as 
his ship brought soldiers back from Italy and 
England. He retired as a Chief Petty Officer. 
Upon returning to Tennessee, he settled in 
Sevier County for a short period, then upon 
getting a job at American Enka, he moved to 
White Pine in 1951. He retired from American 
Enka after thirty-six years. 
J.C.’s legacy of love includes his marriage 
to his wife, Ruth, of forty-nine years until she 
passed in July 1992, and his children who are 
so proud of his service, Rita Lane Potter, and 
Betty Jo Lane Moore. He has three grand-
children and four great grandsons. 
Madam Speaker, James Charles Lane faith-
fully served his country under the most difficult 
situations possible and as a WWII Veteran 
and member of the United States Navy, and I 
proudly honor his legacy and service to the 
United States of America.

HONORING WWII VET NORVIN D. 
MCCLURE 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mr. Norvin D. McClure of Fort 
Wayne. 
Our Nation owes Norvin a tremendous debt 
of gratitude for his service to our country in 
the United States Army during World War II. 
Serving in an Engineer Combat Battalion in 
the European Theatre, his sacrifices were crit-
ical to the defense of our homeland, of Europe 
and to the security and prosperity of millions. 
Most notably, Norvin’s service earned him 
the French Legion of Honor award, the highest 
distinction awarded by France. Established by 
Napoleon in 1804, the Legion of Honor, known 
as Ordre national de la Le´gion d’honneur, is 
awarded only to the most exceptional of sol-
diers who served in defense of the French Re-
public. As a combat engineer, Norvin was 
charged with one of the most perilous tasks of 
any soldier during the war: removing mines 
and booby traps left behind by a retreating fa-
natical Wehrmacht. But for Norvin and his he-
roic actions, many more Americans would 
have been killed and the Allied advance 
across Western Europe would have been 
even more difficult and deadly than it was. 
Norvin’s unit continued into Germany, and 
then Austria, where it remained involved in 
combat operations until the end of the war in 
Europe in May 1945. Norvin returned to Indi-
ana, raised five children with his wife, 
Maryann, and became a Locomotive Engineer, 
a job he had for 44 years. I’m proud to extend 
my regards to him. On behalf of Congress, let 
me say: we hope Norvin’s heart is filled with 
joy knowing he has experienced our country’s 
greatest blessings, including the affection of 
family, friends, and a grateful Nation, over a

May God Bless Norvin, and may God Bless

District who answered the call to serve their 
Nation honorably, both in uniform and fol-
lowing their return to civilian life. The recipi-
ents of the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation exemplify the time-honored quali-
ties of patriotism, service before self, and bold 
leadership. Following their time in service, 
their efforts in our community have earned 
these fine individuals recognition as the recipi-
ents of this prestigious commendation. Their 
stories of sacrifice will encourage future gen-
erations to pursue a life dedicated to the very 
values we cherish as Americans: faith, free-
dom, and democracy. One such hero is Lieu-
tenant General John Campbell of McKinney, 
Texas. 
A native of Henderson, Kentucky, Lieuten-
ant General John Campbell was commis-
sioned through the Air Force ROTC in 1969 
while at the University of Kentucky. For the 
next three decades, Campbell served with dis-
tinction in unique assignments which took him 
all over the world, including serving as the first 
F–15 instructor pilot with the Royal Saudi Air 
Force, as the Commander of the 57th Fighter 
Interceptor Squadron based at Keflavik Naval 
Air Station in Iceland, and as the Commander 
of the 31st Fighter Wing, Aviano Air Base, 
Italy during Operation DENY FLIGHT, the air 
policing of the Balkans. While serving in the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Campbell was 
appointed as the first Commander of what 
later became known as the U.S. Cyber Com-
mand. In 2000, he would assume his final mili-
tary assignment, serving as the Associate Di-
rector of Central Intelligence for the CIA at 
Langley where he was credited with the devel-
opment of one of the most effective counter- 
terrorism programs in government. 
General Campbell earned numerous military 
and intelligence community awards, including 
the Defense Distinguished Service Medal with 
four oak leaf clusters, Legion of Merit with oak 
leaf cluster, Meritorious Service Medal with 
four oak leaf clusters, Air Medal, Air Force 
Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster, 
Combat Readiness Medal with oak leaf clus-
ter, 
NATO 
Medal, 
Humanitarian 
Service 
Medal, and the CIA’s Distinguished Intel-
ligence Medal, to name just a few. 
In 2012, General Campbell, or ‘‘Soup’’ as he 
is widely known by, and his wife of fifty years, 
Marky, relocated to McKinney. Campbell wast-
ed no time in forming deep roots within the 
community, holding positions as the President 
of the Air Force Association, Board of Direc-
tors for Smiles Charity, director of the veterans 
ministry in his church, and serving within his 
homeowners association. John and Murky are 
the proud parents to three children, Rachel, 
Elizabeth and Matthew, as well as five grand-
children. General Campbell is the epitome of 
a servant leader who has used his many ex-
periences to the betterment of his fellow man. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Lieutenant 
General Campbell for his exceptional service 
and congratulates him on this recognition. May 
his steadfast example of leadership inspire 
others to live a life of service to a cause great-
er than themselves. It is my extreme honor to 
award him the 2021 Congressional Veteran 
Commendation for the Third District of Texas.

CELEBRATING FILIPINO AMERICAN 
HISTORY MONTH 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, each year our 
country recognizes October as Filipino Amer-
ican History Month, a time for all Americans to 
celebrate the incredible past, present and fu-
ture of our fellow citizens whose heritage lies 
in the great country of the Philippines. 
I am especially humbled to do so as the 
Representative of Hawaii’s First Congressional 
District, where some 195,000 Filipino Ameri-
cans live, more than any other of our 435 dis-
tricts throughout the country. With Hawaii’s 
Second Congressional District with the second 
largest Filipino Americans population, at about 
175,000, our Fil-Am community in Hawaii 
stands at 370,000. In total, fully a quarter of all 
Hawaii residents are Filipino Americans, by far 
the largest percentage of any state or territory. 
We observe Filipino American History Month 
in October because the first recorded arrival of 
Filipinos in the continental United States took 
place on October 18, 1587, when the 
‘‘Luzones Indios’’ came ashore from the Ma-
nila-built 
galleon 
Nuestra 
Sen˜ora 
de 
Esperanza in Morro Bay, California. And in 
1906, 115 years ago, the first fifteen sakada 
(contract laborers) arrived in Honolulu from the 
Philippines aboard the SS Doric, marking the 
first sustained immigration into our country 
and the humble beginnings of Fil-Ams in Ha-
waii. Today our Fil-Am community numbers 
some four million throughout our country, now 
the second largest of our Asian American 
groups. 
Hawaii Fil-Ams in particular have been trail-
blazers in politics and government, the mili-
tary, business and entrepreneurship, jour-
nalism, popular culture, music and the arts 
and more. 
Peter Aduja became the first Fil-Am elected 
to public office in the United States when he 
was elected to the Hawaii Territorial House of 
Representatives in 1954. 
Alfred Laureta became the first-ever federal 
judge of Filipino ancestry. He was born in 
‘Ewa, graduated from the University of Hawaii 
at Mano¯a, and was later nominated and con-
firmed by our own Senator Daniel Inouye in 
July 1978. 
Benjamin Menor became the first Fil-Am 
higher court judge as associate justice of the 
Hawaii State Supreme Court. 
Ben Cayetano was the first Filipino Amer-
ican governor of a state in our union. 
Major General Antonio Taguba was the sec-
ond Filipino American promoted to general of-
ficer rank in the United States Army. 
Eddie Flores Jr. bought the first L&L Drive- 
Inn on Liliha Street in Honolulu in 1976, turn-
ing it into a national franchise. 
Carolina Dizon Wong was the first Filipino 
American woman to obtain an M.D. degree. 
Ines Cayaban was the first Filipino Amer-
ican graduate of the School of Public Health, 
Nursing and Social Work at the University of 
Hawaii. She received the prestigious Jefferson 
Award in 1986 for her service to Hawaii. 
Francisco Flores Trinidad Jr., of Honolulu, 
better known by his pen name ‘‘Corky,’’ was 
an award-winning editorial cartoonist of the 
Honolulu Star-Bulletin who became the first 
Asian editorial cartoonist syndicated in the 
U.S. 
A loyal veteran of the 1st Filipino Infantry 
Regiment that fought alongside our troops in 
the Philippines during World War II, Domingo 
Los Banos was Hawaii’s first Filipino American 
school principal. 
Roy Macaraeg became the first Fil-Am to 
become a general officer in the history of Ha-
waii’s citizen soldier ranks. 
In Hawaii, we also regularly honor the over 
250,000 Filipinos who answered the call to 
protect and defend America and the Phil-
ippines in the Pacific theater. In 2016, Presi-
dent Obama signed into law the Filipino Vet-
erans of World War II Congressional Gold 
Medal Act to bestow Congress’s highest honor 
upon those veterans. 
Each and all of these lives of achievement 
are but a small sampling of a broader commu-
nity that has achieved so much and contrib-
uted so much to the rich fabric of our country. 
And the story of Filipino Americans is still in its 
early chapters. 
Why, however, is it important that we take 
the time to recognize groups like Filipino 
Americans? To that, I respond that the story of 
Filipino Americans, and to an extent, the sto-
ries of all of our various ethnic groups, is the 
story of America. From very humble begin-
nings, they have risen through hard work, sac-
rifice, commitment to advancing the next gen-
erations and mutual support to achieve so 
much already. That well describes Filipino 
Americans overall, that and embracing the re-
sponsibilities and opportunities of America 
while honoring and treasuring the rich heritage 
of their ancestral homeland. 
In light of the COVID–19 pandemic, we 
have seen the ways that Asian Americans, in-
cluding Filipino Americans, have been dis-
proportionately affected by health and social 
situations. Filipino American nurses, despite 
making up just 4 percent of the nurse work-
force, have accounted for about 25 percent of 
COVID–19 related deaths among all nurses. 
This is telling sign of the sacrifices they are 
making for our country. 
Sadly, this community is not receiving the 
respect it deserves and facing senseless dis-
crimination. As of August of this year, more 
than 9,000 Anti-Asian incidents have been re-
ported since the pandemic began, with many

being Filipino America. All of us must work to 
stop this hatred. 
And yet, as always, we have seen a resil-
ient community persevere through all. In my 
own district, I have joined my friends for com-
munity clean up days at the Filipino Commu-
nity Center to help protect and promote their 
heritage. With my colleagues in the House, I 
have reintroduced our Filipino Veterans Family 
Reunification Act, which seeks to reunite Fili-
pino soldiers with their children. 
All of this is why I recently joined my friend 
and colleague Congresswoman YOUNG KIM in 
introducing H. Res. 724, a bipartisan resolu-
tion to express support for the designation of 
October as Filipino American History Month. 
We urge our colleagues’ support to promote 
an ongoing appreciation of the contributions of 
Filipino Americans to our country and the rich 
diversity of our Nation. 
To Fil-Ams everywhere, Maraming Salamat 
Po and Dios Ti Agngina, congratulations. I 
truly look forward to partnering with them on 
their next proud chapters.

TRIBUTE TO MRS. AGATHA 
SHORTER-LEWIS 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to celebrate the life of Mrs. Agatha Short-
er-Lewis, a member of CA–24’s NAACP 
Branch. Mrs. Shorter-Lewis has been de-
scribed as ‘‘a social justice, human and civil 
rights champion,’’ because of her hard work 
fighting for equal rights throughout the Central 
Coast. Agatha Noel Shorter-Lewis was born in 
Los Angeles, California on September 7, 
1950, to Leon and Martha Shorter. As a young 
woman, she studied at a community college in 
the Los Angeles area, transferred to the Uni-
versity of California, Santa Barbara and 
earned a bachelor’s degree in sociology in 
1975. 
In 1973, Mrs. Shorter-Lewis began volun-
teering with Santa Barbara County Probation 
Department, interned with them in 1974 and in 
1975 at the age of 24, she took the test for 
Deputy Probation Officer II and scored 1#. On 
January 20, 1976, Mrs. Shorter-Lewis was 
sworn in as the first Black female Deputy Pro-
bation Officer hired by Santa Barbara County. 
Her first assignment was working with Juve-
niles. 
In an April 2001, Santa Maria Times news-
paper article, Mrs. Shorter-Lewis recounted 
her time at the Probation Department noting 
one case stands out: ‘‘A boy, who just 
wouldn’t go to school and was giving his par-
ents, school administrators and teachers 
chaos. She told him, ‘‘Listen, if you don’t get 
up and go to school on time, I’m going to have 
to get there to your house and when you turn 
over, I’m going to be in bed with you, because 
I told you to get up and go to school.’’ The 
young man thought she was playing with him 
and wasn’t going to do it. Early one morning 
his mom called saying he wouldn’t get out of 
bed. She told his mom ‘‘I’m on my way’’ and 
when she arrived at the house, she told the 
mom ‘‘don’t wake him up anymore, begging 
him to go to school’’ and eased up in bed with 
him. When he turned over, he said ‘‘Oh, Oh, 
Miss Shorter, Miss Shorter, I’m going to 
school, I’m going to school.’’ She said, ‘‘sure 
you are going to school because I’m going to 
wait right here until you get up.’’ She drove 
the boy to school that day and his mother 
never had problems with him again. 
While at Probation, Mrs. Shorter-Lewis 
helped countless youth and their families 
changing their lives through dedication and 
caring while providing structure to help them 
reach their full potential. Mrs. Shorter-Lewis 
served the last 8 years with the department in 
the Adult Investigation Unit, investigating fel-
ony offenses, and determining whether or not 
to grant probation. She represented Probation 
in Court once a week as a Hearing Officer in 
Judge Rogelio Flores courtroom. 
Mrs. Shorter-Lewis served 27 years as Dep-
uty Probation Officer, retiring on April 27, 
2001, due to health issues. 
Mrs. Shorter-Lewis married Rev. Henry 
Littleton Lewis, Jr. on January 16, 1993. Their 
wedding was the biggest wedding event in 
Santa Maria, with 25 bridesmaids many of 
whom were Judges, attorneys, and Probation 
Officers and more than 1,000 guests in attend-
ance. One of her biggest joys was on Sep-
tember 12, 2013, when Rev. Lewis became 
Pastor of New Hope Missionary Baptist 
Church and she became First Lady of the 
church, a position she absolutely treasured. 
She was an active church member, and in her 
own words she served in every office of the 
church but ‘‘Pastor!’’ In addition to First Lady, 
at New Hope Missionary Baptist Church, she 
served in the capacity of Church Clerk, Sun-
day School Teacher, Women’s Ministry Presi-
dent, Program Committee Chair, and Wom-
en’s Choir. She was also active with Coast 
Counties District Association serving as local 
president, District President, Minister’s Wives 
Chairperson, and on various activity planning 
committees. At the State Baptist level, she 
was Vice-President of the Women’s Depart-
ment, Chair of Advisory Council of past Presi-
dents, Serendipity Speaker and Teacher. At 
the National Baptist level, she was a delegate 
representing California State Baptist many 
times, Queen candidate for the Women’s De-
partment under Women’s President Sister 
Alma Tate. With Rev. Lewis untimely death on 
September 13, 2013, Mrs. Shorter-Lewis First 
Lady position ended; however, she remained 
an active leader and member of the church. 
In addition to church, Mrs. Lewis was very 
active in the community. After being sworn in 
as a Deputy Probation Officer, Mrs. Shorter- 
Lewis moved to Santa Maria. Once in Santa 
Maria, she tried renting a home, but each time 
would be denied when she showed up and the 
owner saw she was African American. She did 
not let blatant racism deter her instead renting 
an apartment for two years and then becom-
ing a homeowner before age 30. She was a 
lifetime/lifelong member of the National Asso-
ciation For the Advancement of Colored Peo-
ple (NAACP) and made history again as the 
Santa Maria-Lompoc Branch second President 
in 1981 at the age of 31. Under her presi-
dency the Branch’s annual professional fash-
ion show was born, an event that allowed the 
community to come out, get dressed up, enjoy 
dinner and the latest fashions from all over the 
world while supporting the Branch and the 
Branch’s Scholarship recipients. Since its in-
ception, the annual Fashion Show has award-
ed hundreds of scholarships to underserved 
youth to attend college and it continues 37 
years later. When Mrs. Shorter-Lewis’s presi-
dency ended in 1984, she continued her advo-
cacy serving as first vice-president from 1985 
to 1988, second vice president from 1989 to 
1990, on the Executive Committee from 1991 
to 2018, and as Executive Committee Emer-
itus from 2019 to her untimely death on Octo-
ber 5, 2021. In each role, she was always a 
Drum Major for Justice answering every call 
she was asked to do. 
Continuing as a trailblazer, Mrs. Shorter- 
Lewis was a business owner of Almagathai 
Ladies’ Hats & Suits, Men’s Ties and Jewelry 
along with her best friend, Mrs. Alma Tate. 
Mrs. Shorter-Lewis loved cruises and vaca-
tions and celebrated many birthdays on cruise 
ships including her 30th, 50th and 60th. On 
one of those cruises, she was crowned the 
ship’s queen. She and Rev. Lewis spent their 
20th wedding anniversary in Hawaii. 
Mrs. Shorter-Lewis was known by most peo-
ple, well respected in the community, larger 
than life, outgoing, family and people oriented, 
with a bubbly personality, a disarming smile, 
was a dynamic public speaker, very assertive, 
compassionate, a good listener able to discern 
truth. She celebrated many family vacations 
and reunions, chaired extra-large celebrations 
for her family and friends including her sister 
Carolyn’s 65th birthday, numerous retirement 
celebrations for her friends, 75/76th birthday 
celebration for her friend and arranged for the 
community to attend the play ‘‘The Color Pur-
ple’’ in Los Angeles on a chartered bus. 
Over her lifetime, Mrs. Shorter-Lewis, re-
ceived numerous community awards and rec-
ognitions including awards from the Santa 
Maria-Lompoc Branch, City of Santa Maria, 
and Vision of Hope, among others.

During his time as a student at the Univer-

of our nation’s largest stockpiles of missiles at 
Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota. 
Captain Akers’ military decorations include 
the National Defense Service Medal and Air 
Force Outstanding Unit Award with one Oak 
Leaf Cluster. 
Following his time in service, Akers relo-
cated to Texas where he operated a success-
ful small business. In 1993, he would embark 
on a new mission following his election to the 
Plano City Council where he served as both 
Deputy Mayor Pro Tem and Mayor. During his 
time as Mayor, he founded the Collin County 
Mayors’ Alliance and was credited with bring-
ing the Dr Pepper headquarters to town. 
In 2002, Captain Akers was diagnosed with 
a lung disease that would eventually result in 
a double lung transplant. His unique experi-
ence generated a new passion for organ do-
nation advocacy and he remains a staunch 
supporter for the cause. Akers also served in 
the role of President and CEO of the Celina 
Chamber of Commerce until his recent retire-
ment. In his personal life, Jeran is the proud 
father of three children with whom he has in-
stilled a love of country. His eldest son Tyler 
followed in his father’s footsteps by joining the 
Air Force, and his younger son, Josh, is a fall-
en Marine. Today, Jeran, and his wife, Vic-
toria, continue spending time in the community 
and enjoying their five grandchildren. Captain 
Akers has been a steadfast example of serv-
ice before self both to his nation and through 
his dedication to involvement within our local 
community. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Captain 
Akers for his exceptional service and con-
gratulates him on this recognition. May his 
steadfast example of leadership inspire others 
to live a life of service to a cause greater than 
themselves. It is my extreme honor to award 
him the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for the Third District of Texas.

HONORING THE WORLD WAR II,

AND 
VIETNAM 
WAR VETERANS OF ILLINOIS 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the World War II, Korean War, and Viet-
nam War Veterans who traveled to Wash-
ington, D.C. on October 27, 2021 with Honor 
Flight Chicago, a program that provides World 
War II, Korean War, and Vietnam War vet-
erans the opportunity to visit their memorials 
on The National Mall in Washington, D.C. 
These memorials were built to honor their 
courage and service to their country. 
The American Veteran is one of our great-
est treasures. The Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors, 
Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who traveled 
here on October 27th answered our nation’s 
call to service during one of its greatest times 
of need. From the European Campaign to the 
Pacific Asian Theatre to the African Theater, 
these brave Americans risked life and limb, 
gave service and sacrificed much, all while 
embodying what it is to be a hero. We owe 
them more gratitude than can ever be ex-
pressed. 
I welcome these brave veterans to Wash-
ington and to their memorials. I am proud to 
include in the RECORD the names of these 
men and women for all to see, hear, and rec-
ognize, and I call on my colleagues to rise and 
join me in expressing gratitude.

HONORING RABBI NEIL BRIEF 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the 50th Anniversary 
of Rabbi Neil Brief’s service to Ezra Habonim 
Niles Township Jewish Congregation and the 
Skokie, Illinois community. In 1971 Rabbi Brief 
became the Rabbi for the Congregation, and 
he became Rabbi Emeritus in 2004. 
Rabbi Brief overcame poverty as a child and 
developed his leadership skills by becoming 
president of the Brooklyn Brownsville Boys 
Club and coaching two club championship 
basketball teams. 
He attended New York University and distin-
guished himself at Hebrew Union College- 
Jewish Institute of Religion through his study 
of numerology, which he later adapted to meet 
the needs of his congregants. He worked 
throughout his higher education, as a waiter, 
busboy, camp counselor and teaching reli-
gious school. He then served his country as 
an Army Chaplain, counseling soldiers of all 
faiths and rising to the rank of Captain within 
two years. 
Rabbi Brief helped bring people together. 
He brought Skokie’s clergy closer together 
through spearheading the creation of and 
serving as president of the Niles Township 
Clergy Forum. And he helped strengthen his 
congregants’ marriages through his leadership 
in Jewish Marriage encounter. 
Rabbi Brief helped lead and serve his com-
munity through his work with the Skokie Com-
mission on Family Services, the Rotary Club, 
the United Way of Skokie Valley and many 
other service organizations. 
He has always stood by those who were op-
pressed and through his congregational, inter-
faith, political and humanist work, helped cre-
ate Skokie spirit and become a true leader in 
the community. He helped organize rallies 
drawing thousands of people to protest preju-
dice in the community. 
Rabbi Brief trained as a Reform rabbi and is 
a member of the rabbinical organizations of 
Judaism’s Reform, Conservative, and Re-
constructionist. 
Rabbi Brief and his beloved late wife Erica, 
raised three children in Skokie—Dena, David, 
and Debra—all of whom graduated from Niles 
North High School. They were married for 57 
years. 
On this momentous occasion, I wish to con-
gratulate Rabbi Neil Briefs 50 years of service 
to Ezra Habonim Niles Township Jewish Con-
gregation and the Skokie, Illinois community. 
He has been a treasured friend to me and my 
family, and an inspiring leader in our commu-
nity.

RECOGNIZING 
SPECIALIST 
MATT 
FOSTER, RECIPIENT OF TEXAS’ 
THIRD 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DIS-
TRICT 2021 CONGRESSIONAL VET-
ERAN COMMENDATION 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor fifteen distinguished mili-
tary veterans from Texas’ Third Congressional 
District who answered the call to serve their 
Nation honorably, both in uniform and fol-
lowing their return to civilian life. The recipi-
ents of the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation exemplify the time-honored quali-
ties of patriotism, service before self, and bold 
leadership. Following their time in service, 
their efforts in our community have earned 
these fine individuals recognition as the recipi-
ents of this prestigious commendation: Their 
stories of sacrifice will encourage future gen-
erations to pursue a life dedicated to the very 
values we cherish as Americans: faith, free-
dom, and democracy. One such hero is Spe-
cialist Matt Foster of Allen, Texas. 
Born into a military family, Matt Foster, 
moved around his first five years of life prior 
to settling down in New Braunfels, Texas. Like 
many Americans, Matt answered the call to 
serve our nation following the horrific attacks 
of 9/11. Upon graduation from high school, 
Matt enlisted in the United States Army lead-
ing to his deployment to Iraq in support of Op-
eration Iraqi Freedom. Foster served as a 
squad leader in the 101st Airborne Division, 
leading team members in over 180 missions 
and combat patrols. 
Among Specialist Foster’s awards are the 
Army Commendation Medal, Army Good Con-
duct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, 
Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Iraq 
Campaign Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and 
Overseas Service Ribbon. 
Following his honorable discharge from the 
Army, Specialist Foster earned Bachelor’s and 
Master’s degrees in Public Administration from 
the University of Texas at Arlington, where he 
was later recognized as a Distinguished Alum-
ni of the Year. Public policy and government 
are passion points for Foster, and he uses his 
experiences to serve in the role of Regional 
Director of Legislative and External Affairs for 
A&T. 
Matt has chosen to give back to his commu-
nity in a multitude of ways including through 
his work as the Past Chairman of the DFW 
USO Advisory Board, as Vice Chairman of the 
Texas Veterans Commission Fund for Veteran 
Assistance Advisory Board, Past Public Infor-
mation Officer of Team Rubicon-DFW, Co- 
Chairman of the North Texas Crime Commis-
sion Legislative Committee, Director of the 
Collin College Foundation, the YMCA Board of 
Directors in Plano, and as Past Chairman of 
the Plano Young Professionals. In addition to 
his many civic activities, Matt serves as the 
Director of Communications for the Warrior’s 
Keep, a non-profit organization geared to-
wards enhancing the quality of life for veterans 
through the use of outdoor therapy as they re-
integrate back to civilian life. 
Matt and his wife, Vanessa, are raising their 
young son, Jackson, in Allen, Texas. For his 
many efforts to support our defenders of free-
dom, Specialist Foster has earned the respect 
and admiration of our community as he now 
works to mentor a new generation of military 
leaders. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Specialist 
Foster for his exceptional service and con-
gratulates him on this recognition. May his 
steadfast example of leadership inspire others 
to live a life of service to a cause greater than 
themselves. It is my extreme honor to award 
him the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for the Third District of Texas.

HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
a hundred years ago, two independent library 
associations merged into one amazing li-
brary—the Middletown Township Public Li-
brary. 
Congratulations to Library Director Heather 
Andolsen and Board President Bill Bucco— 
and library staff and board members past and 
present—for this remarkable achievement. 
A hundred years ago: Warren Harding was 
in the White House; New Jerseyans Joseph 
Frelinghuysen and Walter Evans Edge were in 
the U.S. Senate; Theodore Appleby was Mon-
mouth County’s Member of Congress; and the 
Freeholder Director was Bryant Newcomb. 
America and the world in 1921 were still 
reeling and recovering from WWI and from the 
1918 H1N1 Flu Pandemic that infected a third 
of the world’s population and killed 50 million 
people. 
That same year—1921—my favorite base-
ball team bought land to build Yankee Sta-
dium (I was there in the stands in 1969 for 
Mickey Mantle Day); the treatment of diabetes 
was significantly advanced with the isolation of 
insulin and Albert Einstein got the Nobel Prize 
for Physics for his many contributions to theo-
retical physics including his 1905 theory of rel-
ativity. 
And it was Albert Einstein who famously 
said ‘‘the only thing you absolutely need to 
know is the location of the library’’ which in the 
early years of MTPL perhaps begged the 
question, where is Dorothy Norton and her 
Ford Model T library on wheels? 
Today, the Library is an important cultural 
and meeting center and a venue for assist-
ance when disasters hit like Superstorm 
Sandy. 
MTPL is an oasis of learning, knowledge, 
wisdom, and knowhow. 
As food nurtures the body, the availability 
and accessibility of books and other literary 
works feeds the mind and soul. 
A few weeks ago, I introduced an anti- 
human trafficking bill named after the great 
abolitionist, author, orator, and former slave 
Frederick Douglass. 
I was joined at the press conference by 
Frederick Douglass’ great, great, great grand-
son Ken Morris, who quoted his famous an-
cestor who said, ‘‘knowledge makes a man 
unfit to be a slave’’ and ‘‘Once you learn to 
read you will be forever free.’’

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF STATE THEATRE 
NEW JERSEY 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to recognize State Theatre New Jer-
sey on its 100th anniversary and join its lead-
ership, staff, and Board of Trustees in cele-
brating its reopening ribbon cutting and mar-
quee lighting. 
Opened in 1921 by Walter Reade, State 
Theatre New Jersey, then known as Reade’s 
State Theatre, continues to bring exceptional 
arts-programming, culture, and vitality to the 
greater New Brunswick community. State The-
atre New Jersey is a premier regional venue, 
providing an outstanding educational and en-
tertainment resource for Central Jersey and 
beyond, attracting visitors as far as Canada 
and England. Its efforts to introduce the theat-
rical arts to the general public, including un-
derserved populations, enriches the lives of 
the diverse local community and provides a 
valuable impact on cultural and economic 
landscape of the area. 
Begun as a silent film and vaudeville the-
ater, the theater was a popular entertainment 
destination for residents of central New Jersey 
throughout the 1920s. As films with sound 
evolved, Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO) took 
over operation of the facility and transformed 
the theater to accommodate and enhance the 
movie experience, including soundproofing 
and measures to darken the interior. For about 
30 years, RKO State Theatre remained well- 
attended by residents until many began mi-
grating into the suburbs and television became

mainstream. Efforts by Johnson & Johnson, 
the New Brunswick Development Corporation 
and the New Brunswick Cultural Center revi-
talized the theater in the 1980s and in 1988 it 
reopened as State Theatre New Jersey. Under 
the direction of its current President and CEO, 
Sarah Chaplin, State Theatre New Jersey con-
tinues to honor and preserve its history while 
improving safety, accessibility, and efficiency 
to bring the theater into the next century. 
Once again, I sincerely hope my colleagues 
will join me in congratulating State Theatre 
New Jersey on its 100th anniversary. State 
Theatre New Jersey’s commitment to pro-
moting the arts has contributed to the thriving 
cultural landscape of the community and is 
truly deserving of this body’s recognition.

HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 28, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor fifteen distinguished mili-
tary veterans from Texas’ Third Congressional 
District who answered the call to serve their 
Nation honorably, both in uniform and fol-
lowing their return to civilian life. The recipi-
ents of the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation exemplify the time-honored quali-
ties of patriotism, service before self, and bold 
leadership. Following their time in service, 
their efforts in our community have earned 
these fine individuals recognition as the recipi-
ents of this prestigious commendation. Their 
stories of sacrifice will encourage future gen-
erations to pursue a life dedicated to the very 
values we cherish as Americans: faith, free-
dom, and democracy. One such hero is Senior 
Master Sergeant Patrick Nugent of Allen, 
Texas. 
Upon joining the U.S. Air Force, Pat Nugent, 
trained as a parachute rigger and was sta-
tioned at England Air Force Base prior to 
being transferred to RAF Mildenhall, England 
where he was assigned to an Aerial Port 
squadron supporting aerial delivery parachute 
systems throughout the European Theater. 
During this time, Nugent developed a lifelong 
passion for photography and was eventually 
assigned to cover the world-renowned Air 
Force Thunderbirds. Due to his training as a 
photojournalist at Syracuse University, Pat 
would have the opportunity to cover a variety 
of historical events including the Rhein-Mein 
Air Base bombing and the return of hostages, 
Father Martin Jenco and David Jacobson, as 
well as those kidnapped from the Italian cruise 
ship Achille Lauro. Pat also covered Oper-
ations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Provide 
Hope, and the Panama invasion, and was in-
volved in efforts to introduce digital photog-
raphy to the Department of Defense. 
During his 23 years of military service, Ser-
geant Nugent earned a multitude of awards in-
cluding the National Defense Service Medal 
with 1 device, the Air Force Training Ribbon, 
Air Force Longevity Service Ribbon with 4 de-
vices, Air Force Good Conduct Medal with 6 
devices, Air Force Outstanding Unit Award 
with 3 devices, Air Force Overseas Short Tour 
Ribbon, Vietnam Service Medal, Air Force 
Achievement Medal, Air Force Commendation 
Medal and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign 
Medal to name just a few. 
Following his retirement from the military, 
Nugent held government account manage-
ment positions with Eastman Kodak and 
Nikon. As an active and lifetime member of 
Vietnam Veterans of America, Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans, the Seidel Dallas Chapter of 
the Air Force Association, the USAF Combat 
Camera Association, and the Collin County 
Veterans Coalition, Pat can often be seen be-
hind the lens capturing our veterans and mili-
tary which earned him the Air Force Associa-
tion’s ‘‘Medal of Freedom.’’ 
Mr. Nugent is a tremendous example of 
using one’s gift in service to their nation. Pat 
and his wife, Carol, look forward to celebrating 
fifty years of marriage this year and are the 
proud parents to two adult children, and five 
grandchildren. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Senior Mas-
ter Sergeant Nugent for his exceptional serv-
ice and congratulates him on this recognition. 
May his steadfast example of leadership in-
spire others to live a life of service to a cause 
greater than themselves. It is my extreme 
honor to award him the 2021 Congressional 
Veteran Commendation for the Third District of 
Texas.
