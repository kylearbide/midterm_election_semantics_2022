PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Great is Your faithfulness, eternal 
God of all creation. As the years go by, 
while our attentions stay absorbed on 
the here and now, You remain sov-
ereign over all our days. 
We cannot even fathom the immen-
sity of what You do from one year to 
the next, let alone what You have done 
from the beginning of time to its end. 
Much has transpired, both good and 
ill, in this year 2021. We have lived and 
thrived in Your grace, and by Your 
great mercy we have not been con-
sumed. 
As we reflect on all that has taken 
place in these Chambers, in our coun-
try, and in our own lives, grant us 
hearts of overflowing gratitude for the 
outpouring of the blessings You have 
granted us, and produce a harvest of 
righteousness in the discipline You 
have conferred on us. 
Redeem the memories we lay before 
You and grant Your favor on the hopes 
we hold for our future. Kindle in our 
hearts the deep desire for the eternity 
You lay before us. To You whose un-
failing love never ends, and in the 
great faithfulness of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

COMMISSION MINORITY REPORT 
AND LETTER 
HON. KAT CAMMACK 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 30, 2021 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, on May 
24, 2021, the Chair of the House Communica-
tions Standards Commission conducted Poll 
117–1: Based on the Complaint submitted to 
the Commission on April 22, 2021, by Rep-
resentative EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER against 
Representative ZOE LOFGREN and Representa-
tive LOFGREN’s Answer to the Complaint, sub-
mitted to the Commission on May 6, 2021, this 
Commission was asked to decide if a violation 
of the House of Representatives Communica-
tions Standards Manual occurred. 
Poll 117–1 was conducted prematurely per 
the Commission rules of procedures, absent of 
proper investigation, and therefore invalid. The 
Republican Members were unable to offer a 
vote to a poll that was invalid. 
MAY 24, 2021. 
Hon. MARY GAY SCANLON, 
Chairwoman, Communication Standards Com-
mission, Longworth House Office Building, 
Washington, DC. 
CHAIRWOMAN SCANLON: On May 21, you sent 
a poll regarding the Communication Stand-
ards violation complaint brought against 
Representative Zoe Lofgren (‘‘Complaint’’) 
to the Members of the Communications 
Standards Commission for consideration. As 
you have conceded, this poll is invalid be-
cause it is procedurally unripe and violates 
Commission Rules. 
Commission Rules are quite clear. Upon re-
ceipt of a valid complaint, the Commission 
has thirty days to adjudicate the complaint 
and issue its written decision. Rule 9. The 
Commission’s adjudication process begins 
with Rule 6, which requires the Commis-
sion’s Chair and Ranking Member to ‘‘review 
the respondent’s answer to the complaint’’ in 
order to agree to dismiss the complaint or 
jointly or independently conclude that the 
complaint ‘‘presents a reasonable justifica-
tion to warrant further review’’. Following a 
‘‘decision by either the Chair and/or the 
Ranking Member that further review of the 
complaint is warranted to determine if a vio-
lation has occurred, the respondent shall be 
given notice of further review.’’ Rule 7 (em-
phases added). Following ‘‘further review’’, 
the Commission may ‘‘determine[ ] there is 
substantial reason to believe that a violation 
has occurred’’, which may lead to a hearing. 
Rule 8. Following a vote on ‘‘substantial rea-
son to believe’’ and/or a hearing, a majority 
of the Commission may decide to dismiss the 
complaint (Rule 10), or the Chair and Rank-
ing Member may determine a violation has 
occurred. Rule 11. Only if the Complaint is 
not dismissed and the Chair and Ranking 
Member are unable to reach a determina-
tion, shall the full Commission vote on such 
a determination. Rule 13. 
The complaint was received by the Com-
mission on April 22, and your first avail-
ability to meet with Ranking Member 
Cammack to discuss the complaint was on 
May 19. This Rule 6 meeting on May 19 was 
an opportunity to determine if a reasonable 
justification for further review of the com-
plaint was warranted. Rule 6. At the conclu-
sion of the meeting and at your request, the 
final Rule 6 determination was delayed in 
order to permit further reflection. This delay 
now appears to have been a tactic to avoid 
fulfilling the Commission’s responsibility to 
protect federal taxpayer dollars. 
Disappointingly, you sent this poll on May 
21, three days before the May 24th statutory 
deadline for the Commission to issue its 
written decision. The Commission did not 
need to be in this position, with no time to 
complete its work. 
Your poll instructs the full Membership of 
the Commission to determine whether the 
alleged violations occurred. Setting aside 
the fact that the Commission has engaged in 
no investigation of the Complaint, this poll 
is clearly procedurally invalid and in con-
travention of Commission Rules, as you 
agree. You cite Rule 13 as your authority to 
put this question before the entire Commis-
sion, yet no action under Rule 13 is ripe. As 
explained above, and as you now appear to 
agree, procedure here is quite clear. The full 
Commission may vote on dismissal only once 
either the Chair or Ranking Member con-
cludes under Rule 6 that ‘‘the complaint pre-
sents a reasonable justification to wan-ant 
further review’’ (Rule 6), the Commission no-
tifies the respondent of such further review 
(Rule 7), and the Commission considers 
whether ‘‘there is substantial reason to be-
lieve that a violation has occurred[.]’’ Rule 8. 
Pursuant to your suggestion for delay, nei-
ther the Chair nor the Ranking Member had 
issued a Rule 6 conclusion when you issued 
the Rule 13 poll on May 21. Further, the full 
Commission may vote on final determina-
tion (Rule 13) only if the Commission does 
not dismiss the complaint under Rule 8 and 
the Chair and Ranking Member are unable to 
reach a ‘‘determin[ation] that a violation 
has occurred[.]’’ Rule 11. On May 24, you 
agreed to send the notice of further review 
required by Rule 7 to Representative Lof-
gren. Last Congress, Democrats and Repub-
licans agreed in a bipartisan manner to up-
date and revise our procedural rules. Let us 
now conduct ourselves according to these bi-
partisan rules and execute our responsibil-
ities as required. 
After it became apparent that your re-
quested delay at the Rule 6 meeting was 
merely a delay tactic, Ranking Member 
Cammack informed you of her timely con-
clusion that the Complaint presents a rea-
sonable justification to wan-ant further re-
view. Under pressure on this issue, you 
agreed to notify Representative Lofgren that 
the Commission will review further the Com-
plaint, as required by Rule 7, conceding that 
this poll is procedurally invalid and in con-
travention of Commission Rules. Given the 
serious nature of the violations outlined in 
the Complaint and the now-short timeframe 
for the Commission to complete its work, 
Ranking Member Cammack also suggested 
an extension of 30 days for the Commission 
to issue its written decision. It is imperative 
that the Commission have sufficient time to 
review the Complaint, and if necessary, to 
request additional information before the 
Chair and Ranking Member or the Commis-
sion make a determination with respect to 
the alleged violations. 
Further, and despite its now-admitted, 
fatal procedural defect, your poll requests 
that the Commission determine without any 
investigation whether the alleged violations 
occurred. Because of your various dilatory 
tactics that led us to this point, there is now 
no way for the Commission to complete its 
work without an extension. There is not even 
enough time for the Commission to request 
additional information from the complain-
ant or respondent to inform its work. See 
Rule 7. Today is the last day for the Commis-
sion to issue a written decision, affording the 
parties no opportunity to respond. There is 
simply not enough time for the Commission 
to determine thoughtfully whether the al-
leged violations occurred. 
Since the Commission’s inception in 1974, 
this bipartisan Commission has historically 
conducted a fair and bipartisan review of all 
valid complaints received. It is our hope that 
this tradition will continue this Congress. As 
such, the full Commission must be afforded 
the ability to perform its statutory responsi-
bility to review this valid complaint and, at 
the appropriate time, to vote on its disposi-
tion. As Ranking Member Cammack has sug-
gested, an extension of time for the Commis-
sion to complete its review of the Complaint 
is necessary and appropriate. 
As you have conceded, the distributed poll 
is procedurally unripe and violates Commis-
sion Rules. Therefore, we decline to vote on 
this invalid poll and encourage the Chair to 
permit the Commission to complete its work 
in accordance with Commission Rules. We 
stand ready to work with you through this 
process. 
Sincerely, 
KAT CAMMACK, 
Ranking Member, 
Communications Standards Commission. 
BRYAN STEIL, 
Member, 
Communications Standards Commission. 
BOB LATTA, 
Member,

SARY OF OUR LADY OF PEACE 
HOSPICE & HOME HEALTH CARE 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 30, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the staff, volunteers, 
patients, and families of Our Lady of Peace 
Home on its 80th anniversary of service to the 
Saint Paul community. A non-profit community 
hospice and home health care organization of-
fering care at no cost to those in need, Our 
Lady of Peace has been a beacon of light car-
ing for more than 25,000 people at the end-of- 
life and their families over the past eight dec-
ades. 
The Our Lady of Peace legacy in Saint Paul 
began in 1941 when nine nuns from the Do-
minican Sisters of Hawthorne traveled to Min-
nesota from New York to open the Our Lady 
of Good Counsel Home. This was the sixth 
home established by the nuns, and their focus 
then was on serving terminally ill cancer pa-
tients without means to pay or care for them-
selves. This service was started by Rose

Hawthorne Lathrop who nursed cancer pa-
tients in New York City in the late 1800s be-
fore founding the Dominican Sisters of Haw-
thorne. The hospice home in Saint Paul was 
the furthest west out of all six homes and took 
shape during a globally perilous time in history 
as World War II was waging in Europe. Never-
theless, the grand opening for Our Lady of 
Good Counsel’s home in Saint Paul was set, 
and they opened their doors on December 7, 
1941—a day that would live in infamy for the 
attack on Pearl Harbor that would launch the 
United States into the war. 
From that day onward, the sisters and other 
volunteers at the home have provided com-
passionate care for terminally ill patients while 
bringing comfort and support to their loved 
ones. Though the modern practice of hospice 
care was not introduced until the late 1960’s, 
the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne had been 
quietly providing hospice care for decades. 
Throughout those first few decades of service, 
Our Lady of Good Counsel depended entirely 
on donations of goods, money, time, and serv-
ice, and they never accepted payment from 
patients, families, insurance companies or the 
government. Today they still rely heavily on 
volunteers and donations to cover any costs 
not covered by Medicare payments in order to 
ensure a free service to patients and families. 
In 1980 they were able to replace the old Tri- 
State Telephone Company building in which 
they were founded with a brand-new building. 
The new building included a chapel, central 
courtyard with gardens and a fountain, and 
two floors for patient rooms; expanding their 
capacity to the twenty-one beds that remain 
today. 
The turn of the century marked a period of 
expansion and transition for the organization. 
In the early 2000’s they introduced an official 
hospice program which allowed them to pro-
vide end-of-life care outside of their residential 
facility and serve people in their homes 
throughout the entire 7–county metro area in 
Minnesota. They also established the Home 
Health Care program which provides in-home 
help with daily living, post-operative care and 
other therapies. They are also affiliated with 
the Highland Block Nurse Program which is 
funded in part by Title III of the Older Ameri-
cans Act and provides a variety of services for 
older adults and their caregivers in the High-
land Park neighborhood in St. Paul. In 2009 
the operation of the home was transitioned to 
the St. Paul-based Franciscan Health Commu-
nity, and two years later the home was offi-
cially renamed ‘‘Our Lady of Peace.’’ 
Led by President & CEO Joe Stanislav, Our 
Lady of Peace is served today by four Fran-
ciscan Clarist nuns and employs over 130 
workers including chaplains, social workers, 
nurses and a full-time physician. And despite 
their ties to the church as a Catholic non-profit 
organization they serve patients from all reli-
gious or non-religious backgrounds and walks 
of life. For 80 years they have upheld their 
mission to gently comfort and care for those 
most in need near the end of their lives, wher-
ever they call home, regardless of means. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Our Lady of Peace’s benevolent and 
dedicated staff and volunteers—as well as the 
patients and families they serve—on their 80th 
anniversary of service.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MO´ NICA 
CRIADO-CUEVAS 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mo´nica Criado-Cuevas. 
Mo´nica passed away on December 13, 2021. 
She was an inspiring woman, mother, mentor, 
wife, and cultural figure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1401 
December 30, 2021 
Mo´nica was born on February 5, 1967 in 
Fresno, California, where she was raised. 
Mo´nica was brought up from humble begin-
nings. Her parents worked as seasonal farm-
workers, and she herself took on the same re-
sponsibility to support her family. This was no 
small feat for Mo´nica. While working to be-
come the first individual to ever graduate in 
her family, she worked long hours picking or-
anges, peaches, and grapes. Mo´nica per-
severed and went on to earn her bachelor’s 
degree at Fresno State and her master’s de-
gree from National University. 
Mo´nica worked for State Center Community 
College District for 23 years and became the 
Dean of Student Services and Counseling at 
Fresno City College, where she will be re-
membered for her care, kindness and commit-
ment to the students and faculty. Mo´nica was 
a beacon of light for many students that came 
from similar circumstances as herself. Her 
ability to recognize and understand the chal-
lenges that presented themselves in those stu-
dents’ lives allowed her to help them over-
come their obstacles more effectively. She 
was adored by her students. In 2019, Mo´nica 
was inducted into the Muro de Honor (Wall of 
Honor) for accomplished district alumni. 
Mo´nica’s excellence extended far beyond 
her profession. She was a prominent cultural 
figure in the Latino community. Mo´nica served 
as president of the Latino Educational Issues 
Roundtable and was secretary of the Hispanic 
Serving Institution Consortium of the San Joa-
quin Valley. Her heritage was captured vividly 
in her love for Folkloric dance, which she de-
veloped a deep passion for at a very early 
age. Mo´nica would put audiences in awe while 
perfectly 
executing 
elaborate 
traditional 
dances at charitable events and gatherings. 
Mo´nica will be remembered for her profound 
impact on the lives of those she came across. 
It was her kindness, care, and charisma that 
allowed her to touch the hearts of everyone 
around her. We send out our thoughts and 
prayers to her family. She is survived by her 
mother, Alicia Criado; her sister Leticia 
Montes; children Michael, Matthew, and Mi-
randa; and two granddaughters. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Mo´nica Cuevas. Her 
service and contributions to the city of Fresno 
will be missed dearly. I join her family and 
friends in celebrating Mo´nica’s life.

HONORING 50 YEARS OF 
ALLIGATOR RECORDS 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 30, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today along with my colleagues, Congressman 
CHUY GARCI´A, Congressman CASTEN, Con-
gressman 
KRISHNAMOORTHI, 
Congressman 
KINZINGER, Congresswoman ROBIN
KELLY, 
Congressman SCHNEIDER, Congresswoman 
BUSTOS, 
Congressman 
RUSH, 
Congress-
woman MARIE NEWMAN, Congressman BILL 
FOSTER, Congresswoman UNDERWOOD, and 
Congressman QUIGLEY, to honor the 50th an-
niversary of Alligator Records. 
Chicago blues music has its roots deep in 
the Mississippi Delta and was carried north in 
the Great Migration of 1916 through 1970 by 
the millions of African Americans who mi-
grated to northern industrial cities in search of 
good jobs and to escape from Jim Crow rac-
ism. 
Chicago’s blues community nurtured thou-
sands of musicians and dozens of record la-
bels, and the city became the world capital of 
blues and eventually gave birth to Alligator 
Records and the rich, soulful Chicago blues 
heritage and culture that we know and love 
today. 
With nothing but his love of the blues and 
entrepreneurial spirit, Bruce Iglauer founded 
Alligator Records in 1971 at the age of 23, 
using all his savings to record his favorite Chi-
cago blues band, Hound Dog Taylor and the 
HouseRockers, although the band had no na-
tional presence, no booking agent, no man-
ager, no publicist, and played almost entirely 
in tiny neighborhood clubs on the South and 
West Sides of Chicago. 
Beginning with this one album, Iglauer built 
a blues record label that is now celebrating its 
50th birthday. 
Today, Alligator Records is the largest inde-
pendent blues label in the world, with over 350 
albums and an artist roster that ranges in age 
from 22 to 78, and has won three Grammy 
Awards and an astonishing 48 nominations, as 
well as over 150 Blues Music Awards and 
over 115 Living Blues Awards. 
Alligator Records has been a driving force in 
support of Chicago blues and blues music 
worldwide, and a glowing example of our 
country’s rich tradition of musical and entre-
preneurial spirit. Now, my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives and I honor Alli-
gator Records on 50 years of business and 
celebrates the American cultural legacy of Chi-
cago blues music. 
Together we urge the United States Govern-
ment to take all necessary steps to preserve 
and advance the art form of Chicago blues 
music; recommit itself to ensuring that record-
ing labels like Alligator Records and their art-
ists receive fair protection under the copyright 
laws of the United States for their contribu-
tions to culture in the United States; and reaf-
firm the status of Chicago blues as a unique 
national treasure.
