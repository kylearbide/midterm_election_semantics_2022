PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Sovereign God, as the world turns its 
attention to the final tributes of a 
great queen, we pray Your blessing 
over the leaders of this country. Each 
day as we renew our oath to support 
and defend its Constitution, signed 235 
years ago, renew in us our ‘‘most sa-
cred duty’’ to maintain ‘‘inviolable re-
spect’’ for the sustaining energy of a 
free government. 
While this document serves as the 
framework for the ‘‘vital principles’’ of 
liberty and security, it is You, Holy 
God, who laid the foundations of the 
Earth and of our Nation. Uphold us in 
our governance by the favor of Your 
grace. 
Likewise, as we acknowledge the cor-
nerstone George Washington laid 229 
years ago for this magnificent Capitol 
building, we ask, O Lord, that You re-
main the foundation for all that takes 
place within these walls. Remind us 
that You, the master builder, have laid 
the footing of faith and virtue that You 
have tasked us, the American people, 
to build upon. 
May we be worthy of the legacy 
which we have inherited, and faithful 
to the privilege to serve in this House 
and in this country, the care for each 
You call us to steward with wisdom. 
Upheld by the strength of Your name, 
we pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the

Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
OUR UNITED STATES 
CONSTITUTION 
(Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Penn-
sylvania asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, as the Chaplain 
just previously mentioned, we recently 
celebrated the 235th anniversary of the 
signing of the United States Constitu-
tion in Philadelphia. 
As the Member of Congress who rep-
resents the Independence Hall where it 
was drafted and adopted, it is a great 
honor for all of us in my district to 
know that our city played such an im-
portant role in the history and found-
ing of our country. 
It is now up to all of us to again read 
our Constitution and bring it close to 
not only our minds but our hearts. 
Every single day we must work to up-
hold it and uphold our democracy.

the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, last year, over 100,000 Ameri-
cans lost their lives to drug overdoses 
and 70 percent of those deaths involved 
synthetic opioids like fentanyl. 
These lethal compounds have contin-
ued to pour across a southern border 
that is not secure, and into commu-
nities that remain overwhelmed by this 
terrible onslaught. 
Unless we in Congress act, possessing 
fentanyl will become completely legal 
in just over 3 months. 
Unless we work now to permanently 
make fentanyl a schedule I narcotic, 
Americans will wake up on New Year’s 
Day in a country where a drug respon-
sible for tens of thousands of deaths 
can freely be sold on our streets. 
Our communities are counting on us. 
We need to pass legislation that per-
manently labels fentanyl as the deadly 
drug that we all know that it is. 
No more short-term bans. 
No more playing politics while lives 
are at stake. 
f 
BIDEN’S BORDER CRISIS 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to address the crisis at our 
southern border. 
The Biden administration’s inaction 
and removal of vital policies such as 
title 42 has caused a massive influx of 
illegal immigrants into our country. 
This past weekend, 1,433 migrants at-
tempted to cross the border and claim 
asylum. In this group, there were four 
gang members, one sex offender, and 
one migrant with an active warrant 
out for their arrest. 
We need to approach immigration 
with commonsense legislation that pre-
vents bad actors like this from enter-
ing our country. 
It is disturbing to hear stories from 
people in the district who have lost 
loved 
ones 
or 
close 
friends 
from 
fentanyl overdoses and other illegal 
drugs coming across the southern bor-
der. 
Today, I would like to reiterate my 
calls for President Biden to visit the 
border. Since taking office, I have vis-
ited the southern border three times to 
listen to the stories of our fearless bor-
der agents about the Biden administra-
tion’s ineffective policies. President 
Biden has proven that he is not inter-
ested in or capable of securing or keep-
ing America safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish an 
amazing person, my husband, Curt 
Meeks, a happy birthday. Happy birth-
day, Curt. 
Mr. Speaker, I am also extending my 
deepest heartfelt sympathies to my sis-
ter-in-law, Diana Cogliano, Mari-Elea-
nor Miller Martino and her husband, 
Ralph Martino, on the sudden passing 
of their mother, Josephine Martino, 
this morning when she passed. May 
God’s grace go with you as you cross 
this journey. 
f 
INFLATION CRISIS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, inflation has outpaced work-
ers’ wages for 17 months in a row under 
Biden. This has cost the average Amer-
ican worker over $3,000 in lost income 
with the price of everyday costs, such 
as gas, utility bills, and food, reducing 
pocketbooks of families. 
Food costs alone are up over 11 per-
cent, the largest 1-year increase in 
prices in 43 years. More specifically, a 
trip to the grocery store will feature 
cost increases such as: Flour up 23 per-
cent; roasted coffee up 19 percent; 
lunch meats up 18 percent; milk up 17 
percent. 
According to a new Fox poll, the in-
flation is the largest issue facing 
Americans voters, along with mur-
derous crime, preferring Republicans 
to handle these issues. Biden inflation 
is a tax on all Americans. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from a safe haven in 
Afghanistan to America. 
Happy birthday, Senator TIM SCOTT 
of South Carolina. 
f 
REQUESTING RETURN OF S. 1198, 
SOLID START ACT OF 2021 
The Speaker pro tempore laid before 
the House the following privileged mes-
sage from the Senate: 
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate 
be directed to request the House of Rep-
resentatives to return to the Senate the bill 
(S. 1198) entitled ‘‘An Act to amend title 38, 
United States Code, to improve and expand 
the Solid Start program of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the request of the Senate is 
agreed to, and S. 1198 will be returned 
to the Senate. 
There was no objection.

REPRESENTATIVE, THE HONOR-
ABLE MIKE THOMPSON, MEMBER

fore the House the following commu-
nication from Maira Calderon, District 
Representative, the Honorable MIKE 
THOMPSON, Member of Congress: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, September 14, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI,

Washington, DC.

after the date of the enactment of this sub-
section, the Director of the Peace Corps shall 
establish a comprehensive policy to ensure

strual products are able to access such prod-
ucts by—

products in the generic product types se-
lected by such volunteer, if available in the

ant to the policy required under paragraph

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from

NER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1456, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the Peace Corps Reauthor-
ization 
Act, 
and 
I 
thank 
Mr. 
GARAMENDI for authoring this impor-
tant bill. 
This week marks 61 years in which 
President Kennedy signed the bill cre-
ating the Peace Corps into law, with 
the mission of promoting world peace 
and friendship. The Peace Corps has 
fulfilled this vision and has evolved 
into a vital diplomatic tool for U.S. 
foreign policy. 
Since 1961, more than 240,000 Ameri-
cans have served as Peace Corps volun-
teers in 143 countries, conducting peo-
ple-to-people diplomacy and develop-
ment in partnership with communities 
in some of the poorest countries of the 
world. 
Volunteers work in sectors that in-
clude education, agriculture, environ-
ment, health, youth, and community 
economic development. From incor-
porating agroforestry technologies in 
Zambia’s 
farming 
system, 
to 
pro-
moting volunteerism in Georgia, there 
is no doubt about the profound impact 
that the Peace Corps has had on the 
world’s developing nations. 
In addition to changing lives of peo-
ple all over the world, the Peace Corps 
has also shaped the next generation of 
American 
and 
foreign 
leaders 
and 
changemakers, by fostering cross-cul-
tural immersion and collaboration. 
After 61 years of success, we think it 
is time to further strengthen the Peace 
Corps’ global mission by providing ad-
ditional resources to better the agency 
and to support its volunteers. Congress 
last authorized the Peace Corps in 1999. 
For this reason, the bill is timely, pro-
vides a much-needed update to benefits 
for volunteers that include readjust-
ment 
allowance, 
re-enrollment 
pri-
ority, transition assistance, health in-
surance, noncompetitive eligibility for 
Federal 
employment, 
and 
updated 
workers’ compensation. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
MEEKS and Ranking Member MCCAUL 
for moving this legislation forward in a 
bipartisan way. The bill will enhance 
the ability of the Peace Corps to make 
strong and strategic investments to 
meet the challenges of today and con-
tinue to be a transformative force for 
years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all 
Members to vote in support of this crit-
ical legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Mr. 
GARAMENDI and Mr. GRAVES for their 
bipartisan work on the Peace Corps Re-
authorization Act. 
Last year, the Peace Corps celebrated 
its 60th anniversary. The Peace Corps 
has played an important role in Amer-
ica’s foreign assistance efforts, and I 
thank the volunteers who have self-
lessly given their time to do work 
abroad. 
The Peace Corps faced many chal-
lenges during the pandemic, but I am 
pleased that volunteers are finally re-
turning to their important tasks over-
seas. As they return, volunteer safety 
must continue to be the agency’s top 
priority. 
Tragically, the number of volunteers 
reporting sexual assault during their 
service has risen. This is devastating, 
and we must continue to hold the 
Peace Corps accountable for maxi-
mizing the safety and welfare of our 
volunteers. 
This bill reinforces and builds on key 
reforms made by Congress in 2011, in-
cluding extending the mandate of the 
Sexual Assault Advisory Council.

It also expedites the reenrollment 
process for volunteers whose service 
was cut short by the pandemic, and it 
directs the Peace Corps to establish a 
zero-tolerance policy on volunteers’ 
drug use. 
This bill is an important step toward 
exercising our oversight responsibil-
ities and driving reforms that will pro-
tect the Peace Corps volunteers that 
we all represent. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GARAMENDI). 
Mr. 
GARAMENDI. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today, I am excited to join my col-
leagues as we consider the first reau-
thorization of the Peace Corps in two 
decades and also celebrate the 61st an-
niversary of the establishment of this 
extraordinary American invention. 
This week, we celebrate the anniver-
sary of President John F. Kennedy’s 
signing of the Peace Corps Act into law 
on September 22, 1961. My wife, Patti, 
and I began our careers in public serv-
ice when we joined the Peace Corps as 
young married graduates fresh out of 
UC Berkeley. 
Our post was to a remote village in 
western Ethiopia. We taught the sev-
enth and eighth grades and engaged in 
community 
development. 
Like 
so 
many Americans of every age and 
background, we answered JFK’s call to 
service. 
Over the 60 years since the first vol-
unteers arrived in Liberia, more than 
240,000 Americans have served in 143 
countries. Their tasks were to assist in 
the economic and social development 
in those countries. 
JFK gave the call to service: ‘‘Ask 
not what your country can do for you— 
ask what you can do for your country.’’ 
By 1962, Peace Corps volunteers were 
in-country. They were bringing ad-
vanced agricultural production tech-
niques. They were teaching and pro-
viding 
medical 
education 
and 
healthcare services. They were cre-
ating cooperatives. They were building 
roads. They were bringing every con-
ceivable skill that every nation needed. 
When the Soviet Union collapsed, 
Peace Corps volunteers were asked by 
13 newly independent states to come 
and bring the best of America with 
them. Americans young and old with 
every skill arrived. Since 1992, 3,552 
American Peace Corps volunteers have 
served in Ukraine. 
Prior to the global COVID–19 pan-
demic, Peace Corps volunteers served 
in 61 countries. For 60 years, the bene-
fits of these Peace Corps volunteers’ 
work at home and abroad were undeni-
able. 
Over the decades, many Members and 
former volunteers have had the honor 
of co-chairing the Congressional Peace 
Corps Caucus. I thank my co-chair, 
GARRET GRAVES, as we lead congres-
sional understanding and support for 
this essential element of America’s 
international engagement and also the 
indelible impact that the Peace Corps 
service has had on the lives of so many 
around the world and in our own coun-
try. 
The COVID–19 pandemic shut down 
Peace 
Corps 
programs 
around 
the 
world. Today, the Peace Corps is dili-
gently returning its volunteers to this 
essential work. The agency has set an 
ambitious goal of surpassing 10,000 vol-
unteers annually serving abroad. Vol-
unteers are now in 27 countries, and 
every month, another country is re-
starting its program. 
My bill, the bipartisan Peace Corps 
Reauthorization Act, H.R. 1456, builds 
upon the Sam Farr and Nick Castle 
Peace Corps Reform Act of 2018 and the 
Kate Puzey Peace Corps Volunteer Pro-
tection Act of 2011. 
It does make many important re-
forms, which have already been dis-
cussed here on the floor. I would only 
add that it does guarantee additional 
health insurance coverage for returned 
volunteers immediately following their 
service and requires the Peace Corps to 
facilitate long-term public and private 
health insurance coverage opportuni-
ties for returning volunteers. As men-
tioned, the workers’ compensation rate 
has increased. 
This bill strengthens the protection 
of volunteers against reprisals or retal-
iation for reporting wrongdoing within 
the agency and overseas. 
In total, this bill would provide the 
necessary Federal resources to support 
international programs, and current, 
returning, and former Peace Corps vol-
unteers, by authorizing an annual ap-
propriation of $430,500,000. This current, 
critical legislation will reinvigorate 
the Peace Corps and ensure that its es-
sential work can continue to shape and 
inspire people around the world for 
years to come. 
In 1961, President Kennedy under-
stood that the Peace Corps would ‘‘per-
mit our people to exercise more fully 
their responsibilities in the great com-
mon cause of world development.’’ 
He set out three goals. To para-
phrase, first, unpack your bag and live 
with and help meet the needs in your 
new community. Second, in your new 
community, work to create a better 
understanding of America by being the 
real face of America. Third, bring an 
understanding of the world back home. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I can 
think of no better way to honor JFK’s 
vision than for this Congress to pass 
the bipartisan Peace Corps Reauthor-
ization Act and advance the Peace 
Corps into the 21st century. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
pass this important bill. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. In the more than two 
decades since the Peace Corps was last 
authorized, the agency and its volun-
teers have done great work around the 
world on behalf of the American peo-
ple, but the agency still has work to 
do. 
By building on key reforms as volun-
teers go back into the field, this legis-
lation will ensure that the Peace Corps 
is prepared to meet the challenges of 
tomorrow. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1456, the Peace 
Corps Reauthorization Act, as amend-
ed, would significantly upgrade the 
Peace Corps and better support Ameri-
cans who are ready to serve their Na-
tion and make the world a better place. 
I thank Mr. GARAMENDI for his serv-
ice to the Peace Corps in Ethiopia and 
for this bill. It is clear from Mr. 
GARAMENDI
and 
from 
many 
other 
Americans—we all know how their 
Peace Corps service has transformed 
their lives and the lives of those with 
whom they volunteered. 
All of this has contributed to a 
stronger American image abroad, re-
affirming our conviction in the endur-
ing value of the Peace Corps. Mr. 
Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join 
me and support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to H.R. 1456. 
I won’t mince words: H.R. 1456 includes a 
Peace Corps payout. 
Section 16 of this bill gives injured Peace 
Corps Volunteers an arbitrary increase in Fed-
eral Employees’ Compensation Act (FECA) 
benefits—increasing the current deemed pay 
level that is used to calculate benefits from 
GS–7, step 1, to GS–7, step 5. 
No one has put forward a rationale for why 
this increase is necessary or appropriate for 
Peace Corps Volunteers. 
Not a single hearing has been held to dis-
cuss or examine this issue. 
In fact, the increased benefit level in H.R. 
1456 is out of line with deemed pay rates for 
other volunteers. 
For example, Job Corps Volunteers have a 
deemed pay level of GS–2 and AmeriCorps 
Vista Volunteers are deemed GS–5. 
I would also note that tens of thousands of 
federal workers are at GS–7, step 1, or lower 
on the federal pay scale. But again, no one 
has explained why Peace Corps Volunteers 
should be deemed to have a higher GS level 
than these federal workers. 
Furthermore, this bill sets a terrible prece-
dent for other programs that will inevitably ask 
for an increase in FECA benefits. Congress 
will have no basis to reject their requests if 
this proposal passes. 
And guess who will be breaking out their 
checkbooks to foot the bill of these benefit in-
creases? 
Hardworking taxpayers. 
And I’m willing to bet they won’t get an ex-
planation either. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this Peace 
Corps payout and vote no on H.R. 1456.

tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) and the 
gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 8453, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 8453, the Upholding the Dayton 
Peace Agreement Through Sanctions 
Act. I thank Representatives WILD and 
WAGNER for their dedicated efforts to 
introduce and move this important 
bill. 
Memories and horrific consequences 
of the Balkan wars of the 1990s are with 
us all, those of us who experienced that 
war in the region and those of us who 
worked on the ending of that war. I was 
one of those people. 
I was at the Dayton peace conference 
in 1995 as a young State Department 
staffer and remember how close we 
came to failure and the extraordinarily 
positive consequences of success: end-
ing a war that claimed 200,000 lives, re-
affirming the centrality and impor-
tance of American leadership in Europe 
and the importance of the NATO alli-
ance, and keeping the peace in the 
transatlantic community. 
The fragile peace that we ushered in 
with the Dayton Accords was meant to 
leave the threats of ethnic nationalism 
and demagoguery in the past and to 
create a framework, as imperfect as it 
was, for cooperation and, ultimately, 
the integration of those countries into 
European institutions. 
Well, some of those young countries 
have done as we hoped. They success-
fully moved toward and integrated into 
the European Union and NATO. Some 
have struggled on that path but are 
still striving for a democratic and pros-
perous future. 
Some of the problems that they still 
experience are internal of their own 
making, but others are coming from 
outside actors, particularly Russia and 
China, who see an interest and an op-
portunity to keep these countries in 
chaos and limbo.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7895 
September 19, 2022 
In 2 weeks, the people of Bosnia will 
head to the polls in decisive elections 
that will determine their country’s 
fate. However, in the lead-up to and 
following the elections, there will be 
temptations to break away from the 
Dayton Accords and the spirit of peace 
and partnership that they represent. 
The citizens of Bosnia deserve better 
from their leadership. 
This legislation, which the House 
Committee on Foreign Affairs marked 
up in July, is designed to hold the bad 
actors holding Bosnia back account-
able and to prevent others from hurt-
ing that country’s chances to enjoy a 
free and democratic future. 
As we are learning from Putin’s cruel 
and unjustified war on the people and 
the very idea of Ukraine, peace and de-
mocracy are not guaranteed but must 
be fostered and protected always. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 8453, the Upholding the Dayton 
Peace Agreement Through Sanctions 
Act, my bipartisan bill codifying key 
sanctions authorities that will help the 
United States stave off a serious crisis 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
The country is headed into important 
general elections in just a few short 
weeks on October 2, and time is run-
ning out to send a strong deterrent 
message to bad actors intent on desta-
bilizing the country. 
Bosnia’s democratic institutions, its 
territorial integrity, even the Office of 
the High Representative, the inde-
pendent 
body 
tasked 
with 
imple-
menting the Dayton Accords, are all at 
risk. 
Peace in Bosnia came at a very steep 
price. Those who would threaten the 
very foundations of the country must 
be held accountable. 
The reckless secessionism and desta-
bilizing actions of ethnonationalist 
politicians like Milorad Dodik, the 
Serb member of Bosnia’s tripartite 
presidency, are extremely dangerous. 
The October elections could be a crit-
ical flash point. 
b 1430 
It worries me tremendously to see 
Serb and Croat nationalist parties, 
with the support of the ruthless Putin 
regime, working to roll back the 
progress Bosnia has made. 
We have a strong and vibrant Bos-
nian community in my hometown of 
St. Louis, Missouri. Many of my con-
stituents fled to the city during and 
after the 1992 and 1995 Bosnian war in 
which more than 100,000—200,000 lost 
their lives. My constituents want to 
see their homeland prosper as a uni-
fied, sovereign, and multi-ethnic state. 
I cannot imagine the heartache they 
must feel when Dodik denies the horri-
fying genocide committed by Serb 
troops against Bosniak Muslims at 
Srebrenica, or when he threatens to 
lead the dissolution of Bosnia. 
These actions are offensive to those 
who lost loved ones in the Bosnian war, 
and they are profoundly dangerous to 
Bosnia’s future. 
It is imperative, Mr. Speaker, that 
the United States wield our economic 
toolkit to deter threats to Bosnian sov-
ereignty and territorial integrity as 
the country navigates these challenges. 
H.R. 8453 codifies and mandates key 
sanctions authorities to address the po-
litical crisis and corruption in Bosnia. 
Ahead of the country’s October general 
election, this bill sends a critical sig-
nal to local officials engaging in desta-
bilizing and anti-democratic behavior, 
and to Russia for its destructive influ-
ence, that the United States will hold 
them accountable. 
At this volatile moment, Bosnians 
need the United States House of Rep-
resentatives to stand in unequivocal 
support of their peaceful, democratic 
future. 
I appreciate the chair and ranking 
member’s swift attention to this ur-
gently needed bill that I have the great 
honor of putting forward. I also thank 
Representative WILD for working with 
me on this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting H.R. 8453, the Upholding the 
Dayton 
Peace 
Agreement 
Through 
Sanctions Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Rep-
resentative WILD for working with me 
on this important legislation. 
And as a guarantor of the Dayton 
Peace Agreement, the United States 
cannot stand by while Bosnia and 
Herzegovina are threatened by desta-
bilizing ethnonationalist forces and 
Russia’s destructive influence. 
This legislation sends an unmistak-
able message to any actor that threat-
ens the peace, security, and stability, 
or territorial integrity of Bosnia. If 
such 
destabilizing 
behavior 
is 
not 
ceased, he or she will be sanctioned. 
These sanctions will not be considered, 
nor deliberated over, but mandated. 
With the country’s October election 
less than a month away, the time for 
the U.S. House of Representatives to 
act is now. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8453, Upholding the 
Dayton 
Peace 
Agreement 
Through 
Sanctions Act, will help prevent ma-
levolent 
actors 
from 
undermining 
peace and stability in Bosnia, to pro-
tect that country’s free and democratic 
future from efforts to unravel the Day-
ton Accords. 
The progress made since the dev-
astating Balkan wars of the 1990s must 
be preserved. Efforts to provoke ten-
sions must not and will not be toler-
ated by the United States. Russia’s war 
of choice in Ukraine has showed us the 
consequences of a land war in Europe 
in the 21st century. We cannot allow 
anything remotely similar to happen in 
the Balkans, and I am confident that 
Congress and the administration will 
work together to prevent that. 
I once again thank my colleagues, 
Representatives WILD and WAGNER, for 
introducing H.R. 8453, and I hope my 
colleagues will join us in supporting 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8453, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

DEFINED.—In this section, the term 
‘‘appropriate 
congressional 
committees’’ 
means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on Financial Services of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs of the Senate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) and the 
gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. WAG-
NER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6846, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6846, the Corruption, Over-
throwing Rule of Law, and Ruining 
Ukraine: Putin’s Trifecta Act, or bet-
ter known as the CORRUPT Act. You 
can imagine we worked hard on that 
acronym. 
I first thank my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle for the bipartisan ef-
fort. 
Representatives 
CURTIS, 
KINZINGER, SALAZAR, FITZPATRICK, and 
JOE WILSON, on the Republican side, 
led this bill with me when Putin’s inva-
sion kicked off. 
And despite what the news often 
says, behind the curtains I have seen 
tremendous bipartisan unity over the 
last 6 months to ensure that Ukraine’s 
brave people have all of the military 
hardware and economic support that 
they need. 
I will start by reminding us why we 
are 
advancing 
the 
CORRUPT 
Act 
today. We are passing this bill today 
because of the death and destruction in 
Ukraine. 
Right here, you see a picture from 
the village of Bucha. When Bucha was 
liberated, 
Ukrainians 
found 
mass 
graves with hundreds, including many 
civilians with hands tied behind their

September 19, 2022 
backs. The Associated Press says more 
than 1,300 bodies have been found in 
just this one location. And sadly, as 
the Ukrainian military advances and 
retakes more of its sovereign territory 
from the Russian invaders, more such 
evidence of massacres is coming to 
light. 
We are here because this is a moral 
outrage, because this is evil. We are 
also here because we understand that 
the people of Ukraine are not just 
fighting for their country; they are 
fighting for ours. They are not just 
fighting for their freedom and security; 
they are fighting for ours. 
They are fighting for the idea that in 
the 21st century, no country can 
change borders with tanks. No leader 
can seek power through murder. These 
are principles that protect everybody 
in the world, including the people of 
the United States. 
And with this bill, we are sending an-
other clear bipartisan signal that Con-
gress supports President Biden’s un-
precedented sanctions against Putin’s 
regime; and that we will continue to 
push for targeted sanctions against key 
enablers of Putin’s repression until 
Ukraine is free. 
Now, we have before us a list of near-
ly 200 key cronies of Putin. Identified 
by brave Russian democracy activists, 
these are the people who keep Putin in 
power and continue to fuel the war in 
Ukraine. They must not continue to 
profit 
from 
investments, 
accounts, 
condos, properties, planes, yachts held 
in the West. 
But I also want to use this oppor-
tunity to make an important point; 
that Putin’s senseless invasion started 
with his cruel repression inside Russia. 
The first victims of Putin were in Rus-
sia, brave Russians who stood up for 
democracy and freedom in their coun-
try. 
Right here, you see a picture of a 
dear friend of mine, Vladimir Kara- 
Murza, a brave Russian hero. Putin 
tried to poison him twice, and he sur-
vived, miraculously. Putin now holds 
him in Russia’s new gulags. Why? Be-
cause he openly calls for democracy 
and freedom in Russia. 
So you don’t get to the war crimes in 
Bucha without this. So this is why the 
U.S. Congress is going to continue 
pushing for targeted sanctions against 
those corrupt cronies of Putin propping 
up his repression and fueling the hor-
rific war in Ukraine; because it is the 
same people responsible for both of 
these crimes; because we believe it is 
what is best for the Ukrainian people 
and the Russian people and for the 
United States. 
I would like to use Vladimir Kara- 
Murza’s own words to make that point. 
He said that the Magnitsky Act, the 
bill that we passed years ago to facili-
tate the sanctions against corrupt and 
repressive cronies of the Putin regime: 
The Magnitsky Act is the most pro-Rus-
sian law ever to have been passed by a for-
eign parliament. Nothing can send a chill 
down 
the 
backs 
of 
Putin’s 
autocratic 
enablers like the realization that not even 
the Kremlin, with all of its patronage, all of 
its oil money, will be able to guarantee their 
ill-gotten gains. 
Finally, as we continue to freeze the 
assets of corrupt Russian officials and 
leaders, we must also face the fact that 
many of their condominiums, and vil-
las, and investment accounts, and 
trusts remain hidden right here in the 
United States because of loopholes in 
our own laws. 
So I am going to continue to push 
with the same congressional leaders 
who have supported the CORRUPT Act, 
the bill we are passing today, Rep-
resentatives MARIA SALAZAR, JOE WIL-
SON, 
STEVE
COHEN, 
ABIGAIL 
SPANBERGER, RICHARD HUDSON, to in-
clude the House-passed ENABLERS 
Act in this year’s NDAA, the national 
defense bill. 
It will make sure that Putin’s cro-
nies, the ones who we are sanctioning 
today in the CORRUPT Act, as well as 
Venezuelan kleptocrats, and Chinese 
Communist Party officials repressing 
their people, that these dictators and 
their enablers can no longer hide their 
money and earn interest here in New 
Jersey, in Florida, and across America. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker I rise in support of this 
bill. Without question, the horrific and 
illegal war Russia is waging against 
the people of Ukraine is Putin’s war. 
But Putin’s regime and, by exten-
sion, his barbaric behavior in Ukraine, 
are shamelessly supported by too many 
Russian military officials, lawmakers, 
oligarchs, and propagandists who have 
yet to face U.S. sanctions. 
These enablers and supporters of 
Putin’s unprovoked war of aggression 
should not be able to set foot in the 
United States of America. They should 
not be able to enjoy their ill-gotten 
wealth here. They should not be able to 
buy expensive homes here, and they 
should not be able to send their chil-
dren to school here. 
Failing to act would be a great dis-
service to the victims of Putin’s de-
pravity, not just in Ukraine, but those 
in Russia as well who have suffered 
from the Kremlin’s domestic crack-
down. 
At the outset of the full-scale inva-
sion, Putin signed a ludicrous law man-
dating sentences of up to 15 years for 
telling the truth about his war in 
Ukraine. In Russia, calling it a war and 
not a special operation is illegal. 
b 1445 
Questioning the wisdom of his un-
justifiable war is illegal. Those still 
brave enough to speak out these 
truths, including Vladimir Kara-Murza, 
now sit behind bars in Russia as polit-
ical prisoners. 
This bill calls on the administration 
to make a sanctions determination for 
nearly 200 Russians linked to the re-
gime’s pervasive corruption and human 
rights violations. These names were 
compiled by a team of investigators or-
ganized by now-jailed Russian opposi-
tion politician and anticorruption cru-
sader Aleksei Navalny for not only 
their part in Putin’s kleptocracy but 
also for supporting the Kremlin’s war 
against Ukraine. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this bill to send a strong 
signal to Putin’s regime and all his 
cronies that they will be held account-
able for backing the regime’s crimes at 
home and abroad. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
closing. 
Mr. Speaker, in the months leading 
up to February 24, many of us called 
for the Biden administration to impose 
severe sanctions before—let me under-
score ‘‘before’’—Russian troops amass-
ing on Ukraine’s border invaded. These 
sanctions, we argued, would make crys-
tal clear to Putin and his cronies that 
they would be held accountable for 
launching this renewed invasion. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
administration 
chose not to heed this warning, sacri-
ficing a final opportunity to deter the 
war raging today. 
While the administration has since 
worked with allies and partners to cut 
off funding to Putin’s war machine, it 
cannot rest in its efforts to target all 
those in Russia complicit in the Krem-
lin’s crimes at home and abroad. Thus, 
I urge all my colleagues to support this 
bill to ensure Putin’s enablers face real 
consequences. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6846, with this bill, 
the CORRUPT Act, we stand in bipar-
tisan solidarity with the Ukrainian 
people and with the many people in 
Russia who oppose this war, who be-
lieve that Putin’s regime is as destruc-
tive to their country as it is to the rest 
of the world. 
We are saying, with passing this bill, 
that the United States is absolutely 
committed to tracking down the dirty 
money that props up Putin’s repres-
sion, 
his 
brutal 
criminal 
war 
in 
Ukraine. Hopefully, as we scour the 
world to seize the yachts and the prop-
erty and the bank accounts of these 
people, we will be able to put the pro-
ceeds of that wealth to good use to help 
rebuild the country that Putin is de-
stroying. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues 
will join me in supporting the bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6846, as 
amended.

UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON 
INTERNATIONAL 
RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM 
REAUTHORIZATION 
ACT OF 2022 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 3895) to extend and authorize 
annual appropriations for the United 
States Commission on International 
Religious Freedom through fiscal year 
2024. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3895 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United 
States Commission on International Reli-
gious Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON INTER-
NATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. 
(a) AUTHORIZATION
OF
APPROPRIATIONS.— 
Section 207(a) of the International Religious 
Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6435(a)) is 
amended by striking ‘‘2019 through 2022’’ and 
inserting ‘‘2023 and 2024’’. 
(b) EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATION.—Section 
209 of the International Religious Freedom 
Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6436) is amended by 
striking ‘‘September 30, 2022’’ and inserting 
‘‘September 30, 2024’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) and the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on S. 3895. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the United States Commis-
sion on International Religious Free-
dom Reauthorization Act of 2022. I 
thank our Senate colleagues and Mr. 
SMITH and Ms. ESHOO for their leader-
ship in advancing this important meas-
ure—in Mr. SMITH’s case, his leadership 
over many, many years in advancing 
the cause of religious freedom across 
the world. 
Since 1998, USCIRF has served as a 
leading advisory panel to the United 
States Government on matters related 
to religious freedom globally. It is re-
sponsible for monitoring the freedom 
of religion or belief abroad and for 
making policy recommendations to the 
President, Secretary of State, and to 
Congress. 
The past several USCIRF reauthor-
izations have been bipartisan and faith-
ful to the original mandate as estab-
lished by Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, the right to practice a 
religion, or to practice no religion, is a 
fundamental human right. The prin-
ciple of religious liberty should extend 
to all people, not only ones who come 
from a specific set of religious beliefs. 
As respect for democracy and human 
rights continue to be under stress in 
many parts of the world, the work of 
USCIRF 
and 
other 
human 
rights 
groups to shine a light on religious 
freedom is even more important. 
I thank Chairman MEEKS and Rank-
ing Member MCCAUL for moving this 
legislation forward in a bipartisan way. 
The bill will enhance the Commission’s 
ability to continue its important work 
promoting religious freedom and to 
highlight those countries around the 
world that have to do better. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all 
Members to vote in support of the bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of the bill, S. 
3895, and I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I and my good friend 
and 
colleague, 
ANNA
ESHOO, 
have 
worked together on many religious 
freedom issues over the many years 
and have introduced the House com-
panion bill to the Senate bill before us 
to authorize the United States Com-
mission 
on 
International 
Religious 
Freedom. 
It is both timely and essential that 
we pass this legislation. Timely, be-
cause USCIRF’s authorization runs out 
at the end of this month; and essential, 
because the cause of religious freedom 
is 
under 
sustained 
and 
escalating 
threat around the globe, particularly 
in the world’s remaining communistic 
dictatorships, from Cuba to Vietnam to 
North Korea to Iran, and to the world’s 
largest oppressor of religious freedom 
in the world today, the People’s Repub-
lic of China under Xi Jinping. 
Indeed, just today, we see that the 
great defender for religious liberty, 90- 
year-old Cardinal Joseph Zen, has been 
put on trial in Hong Kong, a city-state 
which was once a bastion of freedom, 
but which now sadly has buckled to the 
dictates of Xi Jinping and the Chinese 
Communist Party. All of us here in 
Congress and the White House need to 
raise our voices in defense of Cardinal 
Zen. 
Sadly, we also need to add to that 
list of oppressors Nicaragua, where Co-
mandante Daniel Ortega has reestab-
lished 
his 
Sandinista 
dictatorship 
along communist lines and is waging a 
relentless war against the Catholic 
Church, the one institution which has 
consistently 
stood 
up 
for 
freedom 
throughout his tenure of abuse. 
I would note parenthetically that I 
met with Ortega in 1984 on a human 
rights trip with Tony Hall and Frank 
Wolf, and the man is back. He has been 
back for a number of years, and his 
proclivity toward dictatorial rule, im-
prisoning the very people who run 
against him—I held a hearing earlier 
this year with the wives of two of the 
opponents for him in the general elec-
tion. What does he do? It was with 
their wives, and they were very articu-
late, very passionate, very courageous 
in speaking out for their husbands. But 
Ortega says, ‘‘I don’t like what you are 
doing; I don’t like that you are running 
against me,’’ so he throws them in pris-
on, and they are still in prison. And his 
oppression of the church has reached 
new lows as we speak. 
Mr. Speaker, USCIRF also calls at-
tention to other issues around the 
world, including whether you are a 
Christian or a Muslim or you happen to 
be Jewish or happen to be a member of 
a lesser-known faith, such as Baha’i or 
Falun Gong, USCIRF reports—I en-
courage everyone to go to their website 
and read their reports. They are fact- 
filled, they are very persuasive, based 
on all these kinds of investigations. 
The human rights NGOs all feed infor-
mation to them about what is going 
on. They talk to the State Department, 
but they are really a good check on the 
State Department in terms of getting 
it right. 
That is particularly true when it 
comes to designating certain countries 
to be CPC countries, countries of par-
ticular concern. Unfortunately, the 
State Department has a less-than-stel-
lar record of picking and choosing and 
giving passing grades artificially to 
some countries that ought to be on the 
CPC designation, which is the worst vi-
olator and, therefore, susceptible to 
sanctioning by the United States Gov-
ernment. 
As a matter of fact, this just hap-
pened with regards to Nigeria, where 
USCIRF accurately labeled Nigeria a 
top-tier violator of religious freedom 
while the State Department gave it an 
unwarranted upgrade right before the 
Secretary of State went to Abuja to 
meet with the President there. 
We should have said to the President 
of Nigeria, President Buhari: ‘‘You 
have got to clean up your act. The kill-
ing of Christians, of churches, houses 
of worship and schools, has to come to 
an end.’’ Some of it he can’t stop, but 
the response could be far better for 
much of it. Unfortunately, there is se-
rious allegations of aiding and abet-
ting, particularly with Fulani, the kill-
ing of Christians there. 
I would also point out to my col-
leagues that Nury Turkel, who is the 
Chairman of the Board of USCIRF, was 
born, of all places, in a Chinese deten-
tion center during the cultural revolu-
tion. He has been a leader on behalf of 
the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, as my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle

know—we all know it—they are com-
mitting genocide. Now, we have walk-
ing point of USCIRF, a man who was 
actually born in a detention center, 
and he has been articulate and strong. 
Last week, in the China Commission, 
which I serve as ranking member, when 
he testified, he just hit it out of the 
park in terms of good, factual informa-
tion, persuasive, what next to do, with 
regards to that genocide and other con-
cerns of all religious faiths that are 
being oppressed by the Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
I will end by saying that it is this 
great Commission that keeps speaking 
out so boldly about de-Sinicization of 
all religions in China. That means they 
all comport with Xi Jinping’s etiology. 
Whether you are Catholic, Protestant, 
Buddhist, Uyghur, or Falun Gong, they 
are breathing down your neck and put-
ting people in prisons if they do not ad-
here and comport with Xi Jinping’s 
mandates. 
Frank Wolf is now a member of the 
Commission, and I congratulate him on 
that. Here is the guy that wrote the 
law in 1998, the International Religious 
Freedom Act of 1998. We had real oppo-
sition to it. I was one of his cosponsors, 
and I put together a number of hear-
ings in my committee where the bill 
first originated. But it was Frank who 
was the absolute champion, and we 
named the 2016 act after him to honor 
the champion work that he is doing, 
the 
life-changing 
work 
across 
the 
globe. 
I thank Frank for his tenacious de-
fense of religious freedom of all people. 
Mr. Speaker, USCIRF needs to be re-
authorized. I thank my colleague, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 3895, the USCIRF Re-
authorization Act, is critically needed 
to ensure that our country maintains 
the tools we need to stand up for 
human rights and, in particular, reli-
gious freedom around the world. 
I thank my friend from New Jersey, 
once again, for encouraging us to move 
on this and really for being the con-
science of the House on these issues for 
so many, many years. 
I remember many times testifying 
before you back in the day, and I am 
glad that you are still reminding us 
that this is some of the most impor-
tant work that we can do. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues 
will join me and support the bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend

READ ACT REAUTHORIZATION ACT 
OF 2022 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7240) to reauthorize the 
READ Act, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7240 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘READ Act 
Reauthorization Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION. 
Section 4(a) of the Reinforcing Education 
Accountability in Development Act (division 
A of Public Law 115–56; 22 U.S.C. 2151c note) 
is amended by striking ‘‘during the following 
five fiscal years’’ and inserting ‘‘during the 
following ten fiscal years’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) and the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 7240, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7240, the reauthorization of the 
Reinforcing Education Accountability 
in Development, or the READ Act. I 
would first like to thank my col-
leagues, Representative BASS and Rep-
resentative SMITH, for their leadership 
in this legislation. I also want to ac-
knowledge 
former 
Appropriations 
Chairwoman LOWEY
for championing 
basic education programs for so many 
years in the House. The READ Act is 
just one piece of her great legacy. 
The bill we are considering today re-
authorizes the READ Act for another 5 
years, continuing our country’s leader-
ship in expanding access to basic edu-
cation for kids around the world. As 
Chairwoman LOWEY
would say, edu-
cation is one of the greatest force mul-
tipliers in foreign aid. Every dollar we 
spend on a child’s education is an in-
vestment in their future and in a more 
peaceful and prosperous world. 
b 1500 
Since the READ Act was signed into 
law in 2017, we have made significant 
progress in responding to the needs of 
our partner countries to improve lit-
eracy, strengthen education systems, 
expand access to safe learning, and pro-
mote education as a foundation for sus-
tained economic growth. 
Despite this progress, the READ Act 
and our basic education programs re-
main critical in the face of profound 
learning loss everywhere due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Learning poverty 
has increased by a third in low- and 
middle-income countries, with an esti-
mated 70 percent of 10-year-olds unable 
to understand a simple written text, up 
from 57 percent before the pandemic. 
According to the World Bank, this 
generation of students now risks losing 
$21 trillion in potential lifetime earn-
ings, or the equivalent of 17 percent of 
the world’s GDP. Millions of kids 
around the world remain out of school. 
Children need a quality education, 
whether 
in 
Bethesda, 
Nairobi, 
or 
Kabul. But investing U.S. taxpayer dol-
lars in this cause is not just charity; it 
is in our collective interest. Reauthor-
izing the READ Act is thus a step to-
ward maintaining U.S. leadership in 
achieving this goal, and I urge my col-
leagues to support its passage through 
the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of the READ 
Act reauthorization, and I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. BASS), my 
good friend and colleague, for cham-
pioning this effort. I am proud to be 
the Republican lead on this bill. There 
are 50-plus cosponsors on it. It is a bi-
partisan bill that seeks to encourage 
and strengthen our efforts at education 
overseas. 
Mr. Speaker, investment in basic 
education is an investment in the pros-
perity and the security of the next gen-
eration and the communities they live 
in, and that applies both at home and 
abroad. 
Without the opportunity to attend 
school and learn how to read and write, 
children around the world are falling 
behind and are more vulnerable to ex-
tremism, violence, and exploitation. 
In the Africa, Global Health, and 
Global Human Rights Subcommittee, 
Ms. BASS and I—when I was chairman 
of the committee and now she as 
chair—have held a number of hearings 
about this challenge of helping these 
children so they can have good lives, 
care for their families, and be as well 
read and as well positioned in their 
communities as humanly possible. 
That is why the United States is a 
leader in this sector. The United States 
provides $950 million to partner coun-
tries to support basic education around 
the world, making strategic invest-
ments in improving educational access, 
quality, and teacher training. 
While important gains have been 
made, COVID–19 had a devastating im-
pact on learners, both in the United 
States and around the world. We all

know that from our work within our 
own constituencies. According to the 
most recent report to Congress from 
the ILO on U.S. basic education pro-
grams, in 2021, 24 million additional 
students were at risk of dropping out of 
school; 22 million more girls and young 
women were at risk of forced mar-
riages, early marriages especially, as a 
result of this; and 9 million additional 
children were at risk of child labor, all 
because of the impacts of COVID. 
We need to do a hurry-up offense, I 
think, to try to get back to normalcy 
and back to a better regimen of train-
ing and teaching. 
Despite these immense challenges, 
the U.S. Government’s efforts to sup-
port basic education programs did 
reach 33.4 million learners in 73 coun-
tries around the world, and I am very 
proud of the United States’ efforts to 
invest in future generations. It is a 
credit to our taxpayers that they are 
supportive of this—and they are—as 
well as this Congress on both sides of 
the aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further re-
quests for time, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7240, the reauthor-
ization of the Reinforcing Education 
Accountability in Development Act, or 
the READ Act, comes at a critical 
time. 
Despite the progress we have made 
toward expanding access to education 
around the world, COVID–19 has set us 
back, particularly in low- and middle- 
income 
countries. 
The 
bill 
dem-
onstrates our continuing commitment 
to ensuring every child has access to 
safe, equitable, and quality education, 
and our confidence that every dollar 
invested in this cause returns dividends 
by way of global economic growth and 
stability. 
Once again, I thank the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. BASS) for intro-
ducing this bill, along with the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) 
for their leadership in advancing this 
critical reauthorization. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 7240, the READ Act Reau-
thorization Act of 2022. This bipartisan bill, I 
authored with Africa Subcommittee Ranking 
Member CHRIS SMITH, is a straightforward re-
authorization of the Reinforcing Education Ac-
countability in Development (READ) Act of 
2017, which was signed into law in the 115th 
Congress. 
The original READ Act required a five-year 
Comprehensive Strategy to equitably expand 
access to basic education for children around 
the globe and measurably improve the quality 
of basic education and learning outcomes in 
literacy, numeracy, and other basic skills that 
prepare an individual to be an active, produc-
tive member of society and the workforce. 
The READ Act Reauthorization Act, which 
passed the Committee on Foreign Affairs by 
voice vote, would extend the original author-
ization by an additional five years. I have also 
worked closely with the authors of the original 
READ Act, Senate Majority Whip DICK DURBIN 
and Senator MARCO RUBIO, who have intro-
duced companion legislation in the Senate as 
S. 3938. 
As implemented in the READ Act, it is the 
policy of the United States Government to 
work with partner countries, other donors, mul-
tilateral institutions, the private sector, and 
nongovernmental and civil society organiza-
tions, including faith-based organizations, to 
promote quality basic education through pro-
grams and activities. 
Since the READ Act’s implementation, we 
have begun to see significant progress in 
building the foundational skills necessary for 
students to thrive and succeed in their edu-
cational endeavors. For example, in FY 2021 
alone, U.S. basic education programs reached 
more than 33.4 million pre-primary, primary, 
and secondary students in 73 countries and 
more than one million additional individuals 
with tertiary, vocational, and other workforce 
training. 
The READ Act also required the President 
to submit a comprehensive integrated United 
States strategy to promote basic education. 
The U.S. Government Strategy on Inter-
national Basic Education for Fiscal Years 
2016–2023 emerged from this effort and was 
designed to promote basic education in part-
ner countries for all children, particularly chil-
dren from vulnerable groups, including women 
and children, and measurably improve the 
quality of basic education and the achieve-
ment of key learning outcomes. The strategy 
has been carried out by the United States 
Agency 
for 
International 
Development 
(USAID), through a Senior Coordinator of 
International Basic Education, since 2017. 
Since the launch of the USG Strategy on 
International Basic Education in 2018, agen-
cies and departments have: Created har-
monized indicators and streamlined yearly re-
porting to Congress; Launched the first inter-
national basic education website that includes 
information across all U.S. agencies involved 
in supporting basic education worldwide; And 
has increased coordination among U.S. fed-
eral agencies and departments by establishing 
a process for sharing research, tools, and re-
sources to better leverage taxpayer dollars. 
Although the READ Act has seen initial suc-
cess, our partners at USAID and other Federal 
agencies require time to update the current 
Strategy and adapt it to new and emerging 
issues in global education, such as the 
COVID–19 pandemic which closed schools 
and resulted in learning loss around the world. 
USAID has already begun consulting imple-
menting partners and think tanks at the work-
ing and local levels to update the Strategy, 
and they plan to have a full rollout by Sep-
tember. This update will focus on equitable 
learning outcomes and joint reporting on glob-
al learning poverty from COVID–19 among 
other issues. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation has received bi-
partisan and bicameral support, backing from 
USAID (which implements the Strategy) as 
well as endorsements from 38 international 
education organizations. I ask my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to join me in passing 
this important reauthorization measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7240, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

SECURING GLOBAL 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 8503) to require the develop-
ment of a strategy to promote the use 
of secure telecommunications infra-
structure worldwide, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8503 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing 
Global Telecommunications Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress as follows: 
(1) The United States Government should 
promote and take steps to ensure American 
leadership in strategic technology indus-
tries, including telecommunications infra-
structure and other information and commu-
nications technologies. 
(2) The expansive presence of companies 
linked to the Chinese Communist Party, 
such as Huawei, in global mobile networks 
and the national security implications there-
of, such as the ability of the People’s Repub-
lic of China to exfiltrate the information 
flowing through those networks and shut off 
countries’ internet access, demonstrates the 
importance of the United States remaining 
at the technological frontier and the dire 
consequences of falling behind. 
(3) The significant cost of countering 
Huawei’s market leadership in telecommuni-
cations infrastructure around the world un-
derscores the urgency of supporting the com-
petitiveness of United States companies in 
next-generation information and commu-
nication technology.

vendors win bids to build out information 
and communications technology (ICT) infra-
structure; 
(2) incorporating ICT focuses into allies’ 
and partners’ international development fi-
nance initiatives; and 
(3) diplomatic coordination to emphasize 
the importance of secure telecommuni-
cations infrastructure to countries using 
untrusted providers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) and the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 8503. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 8503, the Securing Global Tele-
communications Act, introduced by 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. MANNING) and the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. KIM). 
A week from today, the International 
Telecommunication Union, the U.N. or-
ganization 
that 
oversees 
global 
telecom and tech issues, will have a 
plenipotentiary for the first time in 4 
years. Crucially, among the elections 
to be held during this time, there will 
be an election to decide who will lead 
the agency as its secretary general. 
The current secretary general is a 
Chinese national who has used his posi-
tion to bolster the PRC’s interests. The 
upcoming race to decide who will next 
lead the organization is between an 
American, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, and 
a Russian national, Rashid Ismailov. 
The Russians and Chinese have consist-
ently staked out positions on internet 
governance that would make the com-
munications sector more friendly for 
authoritarian 
governments 
such 
as 
they, governments that want to crack 
down on human rights, on freedom of 
speech and expression. 
This bill is an answer that stakes out 
a better telecommunications future. It 
calls on the administration to submit a 
strategy on how to promote American 
economic and security interests in crit-
ical technologies like 5G, Open RAN, 
and low-Earth orbit satellite internet. 
The bill positions the United States 
to lead on global telecommunications 
issues and requires the administration 
to increase reporting and transparency 
on Russian and PRC activities in the 
telecommunications sector. This infor-
mation will help us better coordinate 
with like-minded democracies on dig-
ital and internet freedom and security 
issues. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join us in supporting the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 8503, and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
the 
Securing 
Global 
Telecommuni-
cations Act introduced by two of my 
colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, the gentlewoman from North

Carolina (Ms. MANNING) and the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. KIM). 
The Chinese Communist Party does 
not hide the fact that its end goal is to 
replace freedom and democracy with 
dictatorship and oppression, and they 
use advanced communications such as 
5G networks to spread their malign in-
fluence. The CCP seeks to spread that 
influence further by dominating the 
international standards-setting bodies 
that set the rules of the road for 
emerging technologies to skew those 
standards and industries toward their 
interests and industries. 
This bipartisan bill seeks to bolster 
U.S. efforts that are already underway, 
but I think it takes it even further to 
promote 
secure 
telecommunications 
infrastructure around the world. 
It will require, for example, that the 
U.S. Department of State submit a re-
port on Chinese and Russian efforts to 
advance 
their 
interests 
at 
inter-
national standards-setting bodies, as 
my colleague from New Jersey just 
pointed out, like the International 
Telecommunication Union, or ITU, and 
to identify opportunities for multilat-
eral collaboration to promote secure 
telecom providers. 
Lastly, it codifies the International 
Digital Economy and Telecommuni-
cation Advisory Committee, which the 
State Department created to provide 
expert advice to the Bureau of Cyber-
space and Digital Policy on ICT policy 
matters. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a good bill and de-
serves the support of Members on both 
sides. I urge its support, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, Representative MALINOWSKI, 
for yielding. I thank Chairman MEEKS 
for his leadership in advancing this leg-
islation to the floor, and the gentle-
woman from California (Mrs. KIM), my 
friend, for partnering with me on this 
important bill. 
I rise today in support of my Secur-
ing Global Telecommunications Act, a 
bipartisan bill I introduced to help 
combat China’s attempts to dominate 
the next generation of critical tech-
nology. 
Mr. Speaker, many of the products 
we use every day are connected to tele-
communications networks, and they 
rely on a nearly invisible set of inter-
nationally agreed-upon standards. 
Our strategic competitors, Russia 
and China, want to gain an unfair ad-
vantage over these critical areas. They 
are determined to set the rules of the 
road for the next generation of critical 
technologies like 5G and AI. They are 
relentless in their efforts to provide 
their own companies, like Huawei and 
ZTE, with an unfair advantage while 
shutting out all competitors. 
This effort is not just about helping 
their businesses win. This is about con-
trolling a key strategic domain, which 
poses serious risks and consequences 
for the U.S. and global security. That 
is because the PRC has demonstrated 
its willingness to abuse technology to 
steal data, conduct surveillance, and 
invade privacy, all to further its geo-
political agenda and bolster its model 
of a closed, authoritarian system of 
governance. 
b 1515 
The United States and our allies 
must work together to counter this 
threat. We need to develop and deploy 
more secure and better trusted tech 
and 
telecommunications 
infrastruc-
ture. 
My bipartisan bill will help do just 
that. 
First, the bill will require a com-
prehensive strategy for securing global 
telecommunications 
infrastructure 
worldwide, incorporating mobile net-
works, data centers, and emerging 
technologies like LEO satellites and 
6G. 
We can’t afford to be complacent 
about this challenge. We must have a 
cohesive strategy to address this issue. 
This bill will also help crack down on 
Russia’s and China’s malign influence 
at the International Telecommuni-
cation Union, or ITU—a little-known 
but incredibly important U.N. organi-
zation that could determine the stand-
ards behind the future of the digital 
world. It is vital that America and al-
lied countries are in the room at the 
table and leading the charge to set 
next-generation technology standards. 
Finally, the bill would encourage the 
U.S. to work closely with our allies and 
partners to promote and finance secure 
networks and trusted vendors, without 
having to rely on Chinese state-owned 
companies that threaten our security. 
Taken 
together, 
these 
important 
measures will help us shore up key 
gaps and vulnerabilities, while coun-
tering China’s strategic technology 
ambitions. 
Mr. Speaker, our adversaries hope 
and believe that they can achieve 
undue influence and dominance over 
international telecom infrastructure 
and technical standards. 
This bill is a step toward stopping 
their unfettered aggression in an area 
that is of vital strategic importance. 
It will help preserve our global lead-
ership in tech and telecom, keep our 
companies competitive, and protect 
the safety and integrity of the net-
works we rely on every day. 
Once again, I thank Chairman MEEKS 
for his leadership in this area. I urge 
all my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting this bill. 
Mr. 
MALINOWSKI. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
H.R. 8503, the Securing Global Tele-
communications Act, is important leg-
islation that will position our country 
to be a leader in the world’s tele-
communications future. It will ensure 
that the U.S. Government is taking 
steps to shore up and protect our dig-
ital infrastructure at home and help us 
better coordinate with like-minded de-
mocracies as we work to thwart Russia 
and the PRC’s malign efforts to crack 
down on dissent and freedom of expres-
sion. 
I again thank my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives MANNING and KIM for in-
troducing this legislation. I hope my 
colleagues will join me in supporting 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8503, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

COUNTERING 
UNTRUSTED 
TELE-
COMMUNICATIONS ABROAD ACT 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 8520) to establish certain re-
porting and other requirements relat-
ing to telecommunications equipment 
and services produced or provided by 
certain entities, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8520 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Countering 
Untrusted 
Telecommunications 
Abroad 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the national security of the United 
States is affected by the telecommunications 
security of United States allies, partners, 
and other countries around the globe; 
(2) the importance of mobile and internet 
services makes such services tempting and 
effective tools for malign influence and eco-
nomic coercion; 
(3) Huawei Technologies Company and ZTE 
Corporation (and any subsidiary or affiliate 
of either such entity) should not serve as a 
vendor of telecommunications equipment or 
services given the close ties to, and control 
over, such entities by the People’s Republic 
of China; and 
(4) it is in the economic and national secu-
rity interests of the United States to ensure 
that countries around the globe use trusted 
telecommunications equipment or services. 
SEC. 3. REPORT ON UNTRUSTED TELECOMMUNI-
CATIONS EQUIPMENT OR SERVICES 
IN COUNTRIES WITH COLLECTIVE 
DEFENSE AGREEMENT WITH UNITED 
STATES. 
(a) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, and 
annually thereafter for two years, the Sec-
retary of State, in consultation with the As-
sistant Secretary of Commerce for Commu-
nications and Information, shall submit to 
the Committees on Foreign Affairs and En-
ergy and Commerce of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Committees on Foreign

September 19, 2022 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 8520. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 8520, the Countering Untrusted 
Telecommunications Act. 
Imagine the following: A senior offi-
cial for a NATO ally of the United 
States transmits a vital national secu-
rity matter to his country’s embassy 
here in Washington, but before the call 
even reaches the embassy, it is inter-
cepted by Chinese spyware, which 
transmits the call to Beijing. Before 
our officials even hear the top-secret 
message, CCP officials have captured 
and recorded the information. 
Threats like this are very real and on 
the rise. Even here in the United 
States, intelligence and defense offi-
cials are concerned that telecommuni-
cations equipment made by the com-
pany Huawei could capture commu-
nications about our nuclear arsenal. 
Around the world, the problem is 
worse. Many of our partners and allies 
have all of their major cell phone net-
works backed by unsafe equipment giv-
ing the PRC and its friends backdoor 
access to our private communications. 
Many countries, replete with this un-
safe equipment, have mutual defense 
treaties with the United States. 
The 
Countering 
Untrusted 
Tele-
communications Act would be a crucial 
tool to address these security issues. 
First, it would require the State De-
partment to ensure that the Depart-
ment itself is not relying on unsafe 
equipment at our embassies around the 
world. 
Second, it would require a com-
prehensive report on the telecommuni-
cations security of all countries with 
which the United States has a mutual 
defense treaty. 
Third, it authorizes our State De-
partment to provide diplomatic sup-
port for telecommunications projects 
and pushes our United States Trade 
and Development Agency to finance 
important projects in this area. 
Finally, it requires mobile network 
operators listed on American stock ex-
changes to disclose whether they have 
Huawei, ZTE, or other unsafe equip-
ment in their networks. Currently, 
many network operators fail to dis-
close this information despite existing 
sanctions against Huawei. This provi-
sion would be beneficial for our na-
tional security but also crucial for in-
vestors and shareholders in these com-
panies. 
I thank Representatives WILD
and 
WAGNER for their important work on 
this bill, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
Countering 
Untrusted Telecommunications Abroad 
Act requires the State Department to 
conduct a report on the presence and 
risks 
posed 
by 
any 
Chinese 
tele-
communications vendor like Huawei or 
ZTE in the networks of defense-allied 
countries. 
It also requires the General Account-
ability Office, or GAO, to report on 
Chinese and Russian telecom suppliers 
serving U.S. embassies overseas. 
Finally, it tasks the State Depart-
ment with identifying telecom infra-
structure projects that will strengthen 
U.S. national security, and with help-
ing countries currently being serviced 
by Chinese vendors to build capacity 
for replacing those vendors. 
I would hope by now that most U.S. 
officials understand the threats to U.S. 
national security posed by tech compa-
nies controlled by the Chinese Com-
munist Party, like Huawei. But we 
must also ensure that our allies and 
partners are not duped by the seem-
ingly low cost of telecom services pro-
vided by state-backed countries. While 
seemingly cheap, the real cost lies in 
giving the CCP control over all of your 
telecommunications data, which they 
will use to spread their malign influ-
ence globally. 
So I support the bill strongly, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
am prepared to close, and I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8520, the Coun-
tering Untrusted Telecommunications 
Act is an important initiative in find-
ing and addressing American vulnera-
bilities to cyber spying and espionage, 
particularly in our communications 
with partners and allies whose unse-
cure networks may provide backdoor 
access to these increasing threats. 
I, once again, thank Representatives 
WILD and WAGNER for their tremendous 
work in advancing this bill and their 
commitment to protecting our na-
tional security from cyber and security 
threats. I hope my colleagues will join 
us in supporting this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8520, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned. 
RUSSIA CRYPTOCURRENCY 
TRANSPARENCY ACT 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7338) to require congressional 
notification prior to payments of De-
partment 
of 
State 
rewards 
using 
cryptocurrencies, authorize the ap-
pointment of a Director of Digital Cur-
rency Security in the Office of Eco-
nomic Sanctions Policy and Implemen-
tation of the Department of State, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7338 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Russia 
Cryptocurrency Transparency Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On February 24, 2022, the Government of 
the Russian Federation, led by Vladimir 
Putin, launched an unprovoked, full-scale in-
vasion of Ukraine. 
(2) This unprovoked act of aggression vio-
lates Ukraine’s right to independence, sov-
ereignty, and territorial integrity, and con-
stitutes an emergency in international rela-
tions. 
(3) The invasion by the Government of the 
Russian Federation of Ukraine caused sig-
nificant displacement in Ukraine and trig-
gered a broader humanitarian crisis in Eu-
rope. 
(4) On March 23, 2022, the Department of 
State released a statement assessing that 
the Russian Armed Forces committed war 
crimes by launching indiscriminate attacks 
on civilians and non-military infrastructure, 
including apartment buildings, schools, and 
hospitals, leaving thousands of innocent ci-
vilians killed or wounded. 
(5) The United Nations Office for Coordina-
tion of Humanitarian Affairs has projected 
that, over the next three months, 12,000,000 
people living in Ukraine will need humani-
tarian assistance, 6,700,000 people will be in-
ternally displaced, and 4,000,000 people will 
flee Ukraine. 
(6) Rapid humanitarian assistance is nec-
essary 6 across sectors to address the needs 
of refugees and internally displaced persons 
from Ukraine. 
(7) Cryptocurrency has been used as an ef-
fective cross-border payment tool to send 
millions to the Ukrainian Government, 
Ukrainian army, and Ukrainian refugees 
with limited access to financial services. 
(8) In response to the war of aggression by 
the Government of the Russian Federation, 
the United States has imposed an array of 
sanctions, cutting off major Russian finan-
cial institutions from Western markets and 
freezing the assets of numerous Russian 
oligarchs. 
(9) Given that regimes sanctioned by the 
United States have used cryptocurrencies to 
evade sanctions, there are increasing con-
cerns that these digital assets may be used 
to circumvent the sanctions now imposed on 
Russia and Belarus by the United States and 
other foreign countries.

gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 7338, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7338, the Russia Cryptocurrency 
Transparency Act introduced by the 
chairman and ranking member of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep-
resentatives MEEKS and MCCAUL. I also 
acknowledge Chairwoman WATERS of 
the Financial Services Committee, who 
has 
been 
deeply 
engaged 
on 
cryptocurrency issues for years and has 
shown such tremendous leadership on 
the topic. 
Russia’s illegal, immoral, and inde-
fensible invasion of Ukraine has placed 
renewed focus on how the Putin regime 
evades sanctions and continues to fund 
itself. 
One answer is cryptocurrency. Vir-
tually 
unregulated 
globally, 
cryptocurrency technology has increas-
ingly become a tool for people seeking 
to avoid financial sanctions. While 
there are legitimate and responsible 
companies that police their platforms 
and products, there are also products 
like 
cryptocurrency 
tumblers 
that 
have little or no value to society other 
than helping people evade sanctions 
and launder money. 
At the same time, the people of 
Ukraine have demonstrated the poten-
tial value of cryptocurrency. Some ref-
ugees, for example, have found that it 
is a particularly useful way to conduct 
cross-border transactions, and the sale 
of nonfungible tokens has been used to 
support Ukraine and its people. 
Balancing these tradeoffs is not easy, 
but Chairman MEEKS’ bill, I believe, 
strikes the right balance. It will pro-
vide necessary transparency and infor-
mation about these practices to ensure 
that our foreign policy is up to the 
challenge of adapting to this new tech-
nology. 
I strongly support the measure, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to do the 
same.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7906 
September 19, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of the Russia 
Cryptocurrency 
Transparency 
Act, 
H.R. 7338, and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legisla-
tion authored by Chairman MEEKS and 
Ranking Member MCCAUL would exer-
cise oversight of the State Depart-
ment’s use of cryptocurrency as part of 
its rewards program, as well as meas-
ures to improve the efficacy and en-
forcement of U.S. sanctions against 
Russia. 
Emerging 
technologies 
like 
blockchain, the foundation for many 
cryptocurrencies, offer immense oppor-
tunities. For example, people around 
the 
world 
sent 
aid 
using 
cryptocurrency to those fleeing Rus-
sia’s full-scale barbaric invasion of 
Ukraine. 
However, this bill will ensure that 
the U.S. is taking the necessary steps 
to prevent these emerging technologies 
from undermining sanctions, including 
those currently aimed at bankrupting 
Putin’s war machine. 
While the rise of digital assets like 
cryptocurrencies promise innovative fi-
nancial 
opportunity, 
digital 
assets 
could be ripe for abuse as Russia seeks 
to evade the unprecedented sanctions 
the United States and Europe have im-
posed for Vladimir Putin’s brutal war 
of choice on Ukraine. 
b 1530 
This legislation will provide greater 
oversight in the State Department’s re-
wards program, helping ensure that 
these hard-to-trace funds are not fall-
ing into the hands of bad actors. It also 
will help the State Department develop 
sanctions enforcement mechanisms to 
prevent sanctions evasion through the 
use of cryptocurrencies. 
Given the tremendous need for hu-
manitarian support as Europe faces the 
largest influx of refugees since World 
War II, this legislation also asks the 
State Department to assess how crypto 
can be used to support humanitarian 
assistance to Ukrainians fleeing the 
war. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. In closing, Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to thank, again, 
my colleagues, Chairman MEEKS and 
Ranking Member MCCAUL, for intro-
ducing this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues 
will join me in supporting it, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7338, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on

COUNTERING ASSAD’S PROLIFERA-
TION 
TRAFFICKING 
AND 
GAR-
NERING OF NARCOTICS ACT 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 6265) to require a strategy by 
the United States Government to dis-
rupt and dismantle the Captagon trade 
and narcotics networks of Bashar al- 
Assad in Syria. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6265 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Countering

AND DISMANTLE NARCOTICS PRO-
DUCTION AND TRAFFICKING AND 
AFFILIATED NETWORKS LINKED TO 
THE REGIME OF BASHAR AL-ASSAD 
IN SYRIA. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Captagon trade linked to the regime 
of 
Bashar 
al-Assad 
in 
Syria 
is 
a 
transnational security threat; and 
(2) the United States should develop and 
implement an interagency strategy to deny, 
degrade, and dismantle Assad-linked nar-
cotics production and trafficking networks. 
(b) REPORT AND STRATEGY REQUIRED.—Not 
later than 180 days after the date of the en-
actment of this Act, the Secretary of De-
fense, the Secretary of State, the Secretary 
of the Treasury, the Administrator of the

rector of National Intelligence, and the 
heads of other appropriate Federal agencies 
shall provide to the appropriate congres-
sional committees a written strategy to dis-
rupt and dismantle narcotics production and 
trafficking and affiliated networks linked to 
the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. Such 
strategy shall include each of the following: 
(1) A strategy to target, disrupt, and de-
grade networks that directly or indirectly 
support the narcotics infrastructure of the 
Assad regime, particularly through diplo-
matic and intelligence support to law en-
forcement 
investigations 
and 
to 
build 
counter-narcotics capacity to partner coun-
tries through assistance and training to law 
enforcement services in countries, other 
than Syria, that are receiving or transiting 
large quantities of Captagon. 
(2) Information relating to the use of stat-
utory authorities, including the Caesar Syria 
Civilian Protection Act of 2019 (22 U.S.C. 8791 
note), the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Des-
ignation Act (popularly referred to as the 
‘‘Kingpin Act’’), section 489 of the Foreign 
Assistance Act (relating to the international 
narcotics control strategy report), and asso-
ciated actions to target individuals and enti-
ties directly or indirectly associated with 
the narcotics infrastructure of the Assad re-
gime. 
(3) Information relating to the use of glob-
al diplomatic engagements associated with 
the economic pressure campaign against the 
Assad regime to target its narcotics infra-
structure. 
(4) A strategy for leveraging multilateral 
institutions and cooperation with inter-
national partners to disrupt the narcotics in-
frastructure of the Assad regime. 
(5) A strategy for mobilizing a public com-
munications campaign to increase awareness 
of the extent of the connection of the Assad 
regime to illicit narcotics trade. 
(6) A description of the countries receiving 
or transiting large shipments of Captagon, 
and an assessment of the counter-narcotics 
capacity of such countries to interdict or 
disrupt the smuggling of Captagon, including 
an assessment of current United States as-
sistance and training programs to build such 
capacity in such countries. 
(c) FORM OF REPORT.—The report required 
under subsection (b) shall be submitted in an 
unclassified form, but may contain a classi-
fied annex. 
(d) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES.—In this section, the term ‘‘appropriate 
congressional committees’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Armed Services, the 
Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Finan-
cial Services, the Committee on Appropria-
tions, and the Permanent Select Committee 
on Intelligence of the House of Representa-
tives; and 
(2) the Committee on Armed Services, the 
Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee 
on Foreign Relations, the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, the 
Committee on Appropriations, and the Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence of the Sen-
ate. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) and the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6265. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6265, the CAPTAGON Act. 
I would like to first thank Represent-
atives 
FRENCH
HILL
and 
BRENDAN 
BOYLE, as well as Members from both 
sides of the aisle for reintroducing this 
bipartisan legislation and addressing 
an important issue which continues to 
fuel the Assad regime’s coffers and 
campaign of brutality. 
Despite 
condemnation 
from 
the 
United States and the international 
community, Bashar al-Assad’s military 
has continued its relentless assault on 
the Syrian people committing rep-
rehensible crimes against humanity 
upon them. 
Even as American and European 
sanctions restrict this regime’s ability 
to transact and deal internationally, 
its campaign of brutality continues to 
seek sources of revenue around the 
world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7907 
September 19, 2022 
One of these illicit sources of revenue 
is the smuggling of the narcotic stimu-
lant drug, Captagon, which is traf-
ficked to, in, and around Syria, and has 
become a cash source for the Assad re-
gime to enrich itself and prolong its 
atrocities against Syrians. 
Though initial steps have been taken 
by the State Department, our intel-
ligence community, and the Drug En-
forcement Agency to work with allies 
and partners to counter this traffic, 
more can and must be done. 
So the CAPTAGON Act would require 
the Federal Government to develop an 
interagency strategy to disrupt and 
dismantle narcotics trafficking and 
networks linked to the Assad regime in 
Syria. It also requires reporting on 
such efforts and on coordination with 
our partners. 
This is an important step in ensuring 
we can use every tool we have to stop 
the spread of Captagon in the region 
and to choke off illicit revenue for this 
brutal regime. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the bipartisan 
group of Members, including you, Mr. 
Speaker, for presenting this measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time.

the provisions in H.R. 6265, the ‘‘Countering 
Assad’s Proliferation Trafficking And Gar-
nering 
Of

Act’’ 
or 
the 
‘‘CAPTAGON Act,’’ that fall within our Rule 
X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting 
with us on those provisions. The Judiciary 
Committee has no objection to your includ-

ation is willing to forgo action on H.R. 6265, 
with the understanding that we do not there-
by waive any future jurisdictional claim

ters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the

over the matters contained in the bill that 
fall within your jurisdiction. 
I also acknowledge that your Committee 
will be appropriately consulted and involved 
as this or similar legislation moves forward 
and will support the appointment of Com-
mittee on the Judiciary conferees during any 
House-Senate conference convened on this 
legislation. 
Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of 
letters is included in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill. 
Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
GREGORY W. MEEKS, 
Chairman. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), 
who is the ranking member on the Fi-
nancial Services Committee. He is au-
thor of this important legislation, and 
in the past, Mr. Speaker, he served 
under George Herbert Walker Bush as 
the Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
Treasury. He also was the special as-
sistant for economic policy under 41, 
George Herbert Walker Bush, so he 
brings a wealth of knowledge and infor-
mation that we are blessed to have 
here in this House. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
two friends from New Jersey for man-
aging the floor, and I thank my good 
friend, the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
BRENDAN F. BOYLE) for working with 
me on this important legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of 
H.R. 6265, the CAPTAGON Act. I really 
appreciate Chairman MEEKS and Rank-
ing Member MCCAUL shepherding this 
legislation through the committee and 
now to the House floor. As I said, Con-
gressman BOYLE and I worked collec-
tively on this over the past year, and I 
appreciate 
his 
leadership 
on 
our 
Friends of Syria Caucus. 
The decade of destruction and dete-
riorating human rights situation in 
Syria is well known. But just look at 
the poster next to me for a snippet of 
the headlines coming out of the region 
as it relates to this poison, this drug, 
Captagon. 
In addition to regularly committing 
war crimes against his own people, the 
Assad regime in Syria has now become 
a narco state. Narcotic production and 
trafficking in Syria and its neighbors 
have become more expansive and more 
widespread. 
The current epicenter of the drug 
trade is in territory controlled by the 
Assad regime. This has been well 
known now for at least 2 years. Yet de-
spite that, just last week the State De-
partment and White House failed to in-
clude Syria in their required deter-
minations of major drug transit and 
major illicit drug producing countries. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter dated July 15, 2022, from Sen-
ator ROGER MARSHALL of Kansas, Rep-
resentative BRENDAN BOYLE, and my-
self to Secretary Blinken urging that 
Syria be added to this determination. 
Washington, DC, July 15, 2022. 
Hon. ANTONY BLINKEN, 
Secretary of State, 
Department of State. 
DEAR MR. SECRETARY: We are writing to 
respectfully request that your administra-
tion review and determine whether Syria 
meets the criteria of a ‘‘major illicit drug 
producing country’’ or ‘‘major drug-transit 
country’’ as defined in sections 481(e)(2) and 
481(e)(5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 
(22 U.S.C. § 2291(e)(2) and § 2291(e)(5)). 
Elements of the Assad regime and regime- 
affiliated networks have reportedly engaged 
in state-sponsored amphetamine production 
and trafficking. We have seen a troubling in-
crease in Captagon exports from Assad re-
gime-affiliated networks relying on a robust 
pharmaceutical sector and smuggling routes 
between Syria and neighboring countries. 
This uptick has also coincided with in-
creased Assad-affiliated Captagon seizures 
globally. 
Not only is this trade a potential source of 
revenue for elements of the Assad regime 
and its affiliates, but the industrial-scale 
amphetamine production represents a secu-
rity threat to the region itself, particularly 
as Captagon production can become meth-
amphetamine with a few changes to the pro-
duction process. In response, the House of 
Representatives designed an amendment to 
the National Defense Authorization Act 
(NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2022 to encourage 
your administration to develop a multi- 
agency strategy to disrupt and dismantle 
these 
networks. 
The 
Joint Explanatory 
Statement for the FY2022 NDAA noted that 
‘‘the Captagon trade is a cause of instability 
in the Middle East that has negative impli-
cations for the national security of the 
United States and its allies and partners. We 
support development of a strategy to guide 
appropriate action against narcotics produc-
tion and trafficking and affiliated networks 
linked to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in 
Syria.’’ 
As you know, section 706 of the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 
2003 (P.L. 107–228) requires that the President 
submit an annual report no later than Sep-
tember 15 of each year that identifies each 
country determined by the President to be a 
major drug transit country or major illicit 
drug-producing country. In its most recent 
report, the White House did not list Syria 
among the 22 countries identified as major 
drug transit or major illicit drug producing 
countries. If a country is designated as hav-
ing ‘‘failed demonstrably’’ in its counter-
narcotics commitments, the United States 
must cease providing certain categories of 
foreign assistance (as defined in section 
481(e)(4) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 
1961; 22 U.S.C. § 2291(e)(4)) to such country un-
less the President determines that the provi-
sion of such assistance is vital to U.S. na-
tional interests or that the country, at any 
time after the President’s initial report to 
Congress, has made ‘‘substantial efforts’’ to 
comply with the counternarcotics conditions 
in the legislation. This prohibition does not 
affect narcotics-related assistance and hu-
manitarian assistance (i.e., disaster relief as-
sistance, assistance involving the provision 
of food or medicine, and assistance for refu-
gees). 
We, therefore, request that you determine 
whether the Government of Syria meets the 
criteria for designation as a major drug tran-
sit country or major illicit drug-producing 
country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7908 
September 19, 2022 
Thank you for your time and attention to 
this matter. We look forward to receiving 
your expeditious response. 
Sincerely, 
ROGER MARSHALL, 
United States Senator. 
BRENDAN BOYLE, 
Member of Congress. 
FRENCH HILL, 
Member of Congress. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, this recent 
omission tracks with the administra-
tion’s diplomacy disconnect from our 
American values. First, earlier this 
year, State erred and did not include 
Nigeria, leaving them off as a country 
of particular concern for religious free-
dom. And now it is Syria left off as a 
major drug-producing country. 
Mr. Speaker, this is why this bill is 
so critical and important at this time. 
We need an all-of-Government ap-
proach to addressing the Assad re-
gime’s drug production and trafficking. 
Captagon has already reached Eu-
rope, and it is only a matter of time be-
fore it reaches our shores. If we do not 
work with our like-minded partners to 
first hinder the narcotics trade and re-
place it with a working system of insti-
tutions that serve the Syrian people, 
then Assad will, in fact, add the title 
drug kingpin to his recognized global 
status as a leading mass murderer. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this important bill. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, 
FRENCH HILL, for authoring this very, 
very important piece of legislation. It 
mandates an interagency strategy on 
how the U.S. is responding to the de-
stabilizing Captagon drug trade in the 
Middle East. 
Captagon, as I think my colleagues 
know, is a highly addictive amphet-
amine that is fast becoming the most 
widely abused drug in the Middle East. 
Given the growing threat Captagon 
poses to the stability in the region and 
to individual human lives, the lack of 
resources devoted to address its pro-
liferation is alarming. 
In addition to this drug trade cre-
ating a crisis along Jordan’s border, 
there is growing evidence that the 
murderous Assad regime is deeply in-
volved in Captagon trafficking. This 
narco trafficking fuels Assad’s war on 
the Syrian people and further threat-
ens regional stability. The administra-
tion clearly is not doing enough, as was 
pointed out by my good friend and col-
league, FRENCH HILL, to focus on this 
threat, which is why we need this bill 
to admonish the administration and to 
force the administration, the executive 
branch, to acknowledge this problem 
and to respond to it. 
The CAPTAGON Act will help ensure 
that we are countering this desta-
bilizing drug trade which is helping to 
bankroll one of the most brutal tyrants 
of our time. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank, once again, my 
colleagues, 
Representatives 
FRENCH 
HILL and BRENDAN BOYLE, for intro-
ducing this critical legislation. I hope 
all of our colleagues will join us in sup-
porting it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6265. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned. 
f 
URGING THE EUROPEAN UNION TO 
DESIGNATE HIZBALLAH IN ITS 
ENTIRETY AS A TERRORIST OR-
GANIZATION 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and agree to 
the resolution (H. Res. 558) urging the 
European Union to designate Hizballah 
in its entirety as a terrorist organiza-
tion, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 558 
Whereas, in April 1983, a Hizballah terror 
attack against the United States Embassy in 
Beirut killed 63 people; 
Whereas, in October 1983, a Hizballah ter-
ror attack against the United States Marine 
barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, killed 241 
American and 58 French servicemembers 
supporting the Multinational Force peace-
keeping mission; 
Whereas, in July 2012, a Hizballah terror 
attack, carried out by an operative with dual 
Lebanese-French citizenship, in Burgas, Bul-
garia, killed 5 Israeli tourists and 1 Bul-
garian; 
Whereas, in March 2013, a Swedish-Leba-
nese Hizballah operative in Cyprus was con-
victed of planning terror attacks against 
Israeli tourists; 
Whereas, in June 2015, a Hizballah opera-
tive was sentenced to 6 years in prison after 
he stockpiled more than 8 tons of ammonium 
nitrate in Cyprus; 
Whereas the Hizballah International Fi-
nancing Prevention Act of 2015 (Public Law 
114–102) and the Hizballah International Fi-
nancing Prevention Amendments Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115–272) broadened financial sec-
tor sanctions against Hizballah to compel 
foreign financial institutions to refrain from 
supporting the terrorist group; 
Whereas, in May 2018, the Department of 
the Treasury imposed sanctions on Abdullah 
Safi-Al-Din, Hizballah’s representative to 
Iran, Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi, a Hizballah 
financier, and blacklisted 5 of Bazzi’s compa-
nies, including Belgian energy services con-
glomerate Global Trading Group NV; 
Whereas, in October 2018, French police 
raided the Islamic Zahra Centre on suspicion 
of supporting Hizballah, freezing the organi-
zation’s funds, and seizing illegal weapons; 
Whereas, in September 2020, 4 former lead-
ers of the Zahra Centre France were arrested 
on suspicion of continuing to run the asso-
ciation; 
Whereas, in July 2019, the Department of 
the Treasury designated 2 Hizballah-backed 
members of Lebanese Parliament, Amin 
Sherri and Muhammad Hasan Ra’d, and 
Hizballah security official Wafiq Safa, stat-
ing that Hizballah uses its operatives in par-
liament to advance its violent activities; 
Whereas, as of April 2020, Germany be-
lieved there to be 1,050 people with suspected 
links to Hizballah in the country; 
Whereas Europol’s June 2020 European 
Union Terrorism Situation and Trend Report 
outlined that Hizballah is ‘‘suspected of traf-
ficking diamonds and drugs and of money 
laundering via the trade in second-hand 
cars’’, and the report also stated that ‘‘inves-
tigations 
face 
the 
difficulty 
of 
dem-
onstrating that the funds collected are chan-
neled to the military wing of the organiza-
tion’’; 
Whereas United States-led Project Cas-
sandra and Operation Cedar exposed the 
criminal-business wing of Hizballah, the 
Business 
Affairs 
Component 
(BAC) 
of 
Hezbollah’s External Security Organization; 
Whereas, 
during 
Project 
Cassandra, 
Hizballah elements involved in drug traf-
ficking were arrested in the United States, 
South America, and several European coun-
tries, including France, Belgium, Germany, 
and Italy; 
Whereas Hizballah’s criminal activity in 
Europe is run by the BAC, which reports to 
the External Security Organisation, also 
known as Unit 910, or the Islamic Jihad Or-
ganization, 
and 
Abdallah 
Safieddine, 
Hizballah’s representative in Iran, is also in-
volved in this activity; 
Whereas, in August 2020, United Nations 
Secretary General Guterres called on Leb-
anon to disarm Hizballah, citing the terror 
group’s persistent violation of Resolution 
1701 (2006); 
Whereas Iran is the prime sponsor of 
Hizballah, harboring, financing, training, 
and arming the group; 
Whereas the Department of the Treasury 
and Department of State estimate that Iran 
provides as much as $700,000,000 per year to 
Hizballah in the form of financial and 
logistical support, weapons, and training; 
Whereas Hizballah now has an arsenal of 
approximately 150,000 missiles and rockets, 
many of which can reach deep into Israel; 
Whereas Hizballah fighters have been sup-
porting the Assad regime in Syria, often 
leading operations in the conflict which has 
left more than 500,000 dead; 
Whereas Hizballah’s destabilizing actions 
in Syria have contributed to a migrant crisis 
that has brought over 700,000 refugees to Eu-
rope; 
Whereas Hizballah trains and provides 
weapons for militias in Iraq and Yemen, fur-
ther destabilizing the region and perpet-
uating violence in those countries; 
Whereas Hizballah activities continue to 
plague Lebanon with profound economic and 
political instability and violence; 
Whereas, in August 2020, at least 220 people 
died and thousands more were injured when 
a massive stockpile of ammonium nitrate ex-
ploded in Beirut’s port; 
Whereas Hizballah’s cross border illicit 
arms and drugs trafficking undermines the 
Lebanese Armed Forces, the legitimate secu-
rity establishment of the country as outlined 
in United Nations Security Council Resolu-
tion 1701 (2006); 
Whereas, in October 2012, Hizballah Deputy 
Secretary General Naim Qassem stated that 
‘‘[Hizballah does not] have a military wing

and a political one . . . Every element of 
Hizballah, from commanders to members as 
well as our various capabilities, are in the 
service of the resistance’’; 
Whereas the United States, Germany, the 
United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Estonia, 
Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Serbia, and 
Kosovo, 
among 
others, 
have 
designated 
Hizballah in its entirety as a terror organiza-
tion; 
Whereas, in March 2016, the Gulf Coopera-
tion Council formally branded Hizballah, in 
its entirety, a terrorist organization, and the 
League of Arab States shortly thereafter 
adopted the same designation; 
Whereas the Department of the Treasury 
has diligently added persons and entities to 
the list of Specially Designated Global Ter-
rorists who have provided material support 
to the Hizballah terrorist organization, 
thereby 
hampering 
its 
financing 
and 
logistical capabilities; 
Whereas the European Union, in July 2013, 
designated Hizballah’s so-called ‘‘military 
wing’’, but not the organization as a whole, 
as a terrorist organization; 
Whereas, 
despite 
restrictions 
put 
on 
Hizballah since the designation of its mili-
tary wing, the group continues to conduct il-
licit narcotrafficking, money laundering, 
and weapons trafficking throughout Europe 
and the world; and 
Whereas the House of Representatives has 
previously called on the European Union to 
fully designate Hizballah as a terrorist orga-
nization, passing House Resolution 359 in Oc-
tober 2017: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) applauds and expresses support for the 
continued, increased cooperation between 
the United States and the European Union 
(EU) in thwarting Hizballah’s criminal and 
terrorist activities; 
(2) supports transcontinental efforts within 
Europe to share intelligence information 
among police and security services to facili-
tate greater cooperation in tracking, appre-
hending, and prosecuting terrorists, foreign 
fighters, and potential offenders; 
(3) encourages the European Union to im-
plement sanctions against Hizballah-affili-
ated terrorists in tandem with the United 
States; 
(4) recommends greater civil society en-
gagement in both the United States and Eu-
rope to underscore Hizballah’s malign re-
gional influence; and 
(5) urges the European Union to designate 
Hizballah in its entirety as a terrorist orga-
nization and increase pressure on the group, 
including through— 
(A) facilitating better cross-border co-
operation between European Union members 
in combating Hizballah; 
(B) issuing arrest warrants against mem-
bers and active supporters of Hizballah; 
(C) freezing Hizballah’s assets in Europe, 
including those masquerading as charities; 
and 
(D) prohibiting fundraising activities in 
support of Hizballah. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI) and the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
SMITH) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
558, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 558, urging the European 
Union to designate Hizballah in its en-
tirety as a terrorist organization. 
I thank first my dear friend, TED 
DEUTCH, the chairman of our Sub-
committee on the Middle East, North 
Africa, and Global Counterterrorism 
for reintroducing this important legis-
lation which previously did pass the 
House in the 115th Congress. When Ted 
departs our Foreign Affairs Committee 
in October, we are all going to miss his 
voice, particularly on issues regarding 
the Middle East, and his tireless advo-
cacy in defense of American interests 
and those of our allies around the 
world. 
Now, despite all we know about 
Hizballah, a murderous, terrorist orga-
nization that also serves as an Iranian 
proxy in the region, our friends and 
partners in the European Union only 
include Hizballah’s military branch, 
not its political branch, on its list of 
sanctioned terrorist organizations. 
The 
Government 
of 
the 
United 
States, in contrast, makes no distinc-
tion between its two branches and in-
cludes Hizballah in its entirety on the 
U.S. foreign terrorist organization list 
because we know they are one and the 
same. The European Union is long 
overdue in coming to the same realiza-
tion. 
Congress is pleased that many indi-
vidual European countries have acted 
despite the position of the E.U. as a 
whole. The Arab League and the Gulf 
Cooperation Council have also des-
ignated Hizballah in its entirety. So it 
remains troubling that the E.U., an or-
ganization that shares so many of our 
values, interests, and policy goals, con-
tinues to allow Hizballah’s political 
wing 
to 
operate 
freely, 
advancing 
Hizballah’s violent agenda around the 
world. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this important resolution, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
resolution. 
I would like to start off by thanking 
my good friend and colleague, TED 
DEUTCH, for not only introducing this 
important resolution but his tremen-
dous work during his tenure in the 
House, particularly in combating anti- 
Semitism. There is no better friend of 
Israel than TED DEUTCH, and there is 
no better friend of the Jewish commu-
nity that is under siege here in the 
United States and around the world 
than TED DEUTCH. 
b 1545 
He and I co-chaired the House Anti- 
Semitism Task Force. As we all know, 
and many of my colleagues know, he is 
leaving on October 1 to head up the 
American Jewish Committee, AJC. 
What is AJC’s gain is our loss, for 
Mr. DEUTCH has brought character and 
leadership to this Congress, and he will 
be deeply missed, and I thank him 
again for his very, very strong voice. 
Mr. Speaker, as the Lebanese lira 
continues 
its 
downward 
decline, 
Hizballah has become increasingly reli-
ant on illicit criminal networks across 
Europe to help finance their criminal 
enterprise. 
Combating Hizballah’s malign activ-
ity requires robust transatlantic law 
enforcement 
cooperation. 
This 
can 
only take place once Hizballah is des-
ignated as a terrorist organization in 
its entirety. 
Recognizing an arbitrary distinction 
between Hizballah’s political and mili-
tary wings gives Hizballah space to op-
erate across Europe, providing legal 
cover for its military wing to continue 
financing terrorism through its polit-
ical branch. 
There 
is 
no 
distinction 
between 
Hizballah’s 
political 
and 
military 
wings—both serve the same ugly ma-
lign agenda that seeks to undermine 
the stability of the Lebanese state, 
prop up the murderous dictatorship of 
Bashar al-Assad, and threaten Israel’s 
security. 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the recent 
steps taken by Germany and others to 
designate Hizballah in full as a ter-
rorist organization, and all of the Eu-
ropean Union needs to do likewise. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, Representative MALINOWSKI, 
for yielding. I also thank my dear 
friend and colleague, Congressman TED 
DEUTCH, for his tremendous leadership 
on this and so many issues as the 
chairman of the Subcommittee on Mid-
dle East, North Africa, and Global 
Counterterrorism. It is a privilege to 
serve with him. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 558, a bipartisan resolution I 
was proud to help introduce with 
Chairman DEUTCH, urging the Euro-
pean Union to designate Hizballah in 
its entirety as a terrorist organization. 
The Iranian-backed terrorist group, 
Hizballah, is responsible for thousands 
of civilian deaths, not just in the Mid-
dle East, but around the globe. Until 9/ 
11, Hizballah had killed more Ameri-
cans than any other terrorist group. 
Today, it maintains an arsenal of 
150,000 rockets aimed at Israel. 
Just this past week, Hizballah’s lead-
er, Hassan Nasrallah, issued a series of 
grave threats and provocations against 
Israel, claiming its missiles are locked 
on an Israel offshore gas field, which 
Israel seeks to develop to export much- 
needed energy supplies to Europe. 
This is another reminder of why it is 
incomprehensible that any EU member

can credibly assert any distinction be-
tween Hizballah’s so-called military 
and political wings. The truth is, there 
is one unified Hizballah, and it is dedi-
cated to carrying out terrorist activi-
ties around the world. 
That is why this bipartisan resolu-
tion calls on our partners in the EU to 
take a stronger stand against world-
wide 
terrorism 
by 
designating 
Hizballah—as a whole—as a terrorist 
organization. 
We must continue to keep pressure 
on Hizballah and all other terrorist 
groups that threaten the United States 
and our ally Israel, and undermine 
peace, security, and stability through-
out the region. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
bipartisan measure, and I thank Chair-
man DEUTCH for his steadfast leader-
ship on this important issue. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further requests for 
time, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DEUTCH). 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend, Mr. MALINOWSKI, for 
yielding, and for his friendship, leader-
ship, and kind words. I thank my other 
friend from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) for 
his leadership and for his kind words. I 
thank Ms. MANNING for her leadership 
and kind words, as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 558, which urges the Euro-
pean Union to designate Hizballah in 
its entirety as a terrorist organization. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this 
is 
Hizballah. 
Hizballah that bombed the U.S. Em-
bassy in Beirut, the U.S. and French 
Marine barracks in Beirut, the Israeli 
Embassy in Buenos Aires, the AMIA 
Jewish Center in Buenos Aires, bombed 
Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, and 
has—as Ms. MANNING pointed out—over 
150,000 rockets pointed at Israeli civil-
ians. 
First, I thank Chairman MEEKS and 
Ranking Member MCCAUL
for their 
leadership on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee and for bringing this resolution 
to the floor today. 
I also want to extend my gratitude to 
my good friend from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS) for partnering with me on this 
resolution, and to Ranking Member 
JOE WILSON for his leadership on the 
subcommittee and for his commitment 
to working with me on this and a host 
of so many other critical issues—issues 
critical to America’s security. 
Mr. Speaker, I also take this moment 
on the House floor to thank my For-
eign 
Affairs 
staff, 
Sophie 
Mirviss, 
MENA staff director; professional staff 
member, Jack Steinberg; and of course, 
Casey Kustin, our former staff director. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
10 
years 
ago, 
a 
Hizballah suicide bomber blew up a bus 
in Burgas, Bulgaria. On that bus were 
42 Israeli tourists, mostly young peo-
ple. That day, Hizballah ended five 
lives and injured 32 others. In 2013, al-
most exactly 1 year later, the Euro-
pean Union took action to designate 
Hizballah’s military wing as a terrorist 
organization. 
But the inadvertent result of this 
designation was that a false distinction 
was made: a false distinction between 
Hizballah’s 
military 
and 
political 
wings. Let me be clear, there are no 
different branches of Hizballah; it is in 
its entirety a terrorist organization. 
You don’t need to take my word for 
this. The United States Government 
makes no distinction between the orga-
nization’s 
branches 
and 
includes 
Hizballah, in its entirety, on the U.S. 
Foreign Terrorist Organization List. 
But you also don’t need to take our 
Government’s word for it, or the word 
of Germany, Israel, Guatemala, Argen-
tina, the United Kingdom, or the many 
other countries that have designated 
all of Hizballah, rightfully, as a ter-
rorist organization. Take Hizballah’s 
word for it. One of their own represent-
atives in the Lebanese Parliament ex-
plicitly said, ‘‘the military wing of 
Hizballah is inseparable from its polit-
ical wing.’’ 
It is a fact that Hizballah is one uni-
fied terrorist organization. An organi-
zation that, with support from the Ira-
nian regime, has carried out horrific 
terror attacks around the globe and 
continues to spread violence and terror 
throughout the Middle East. 
It is an Iranian terror proxy. The 
same Iranian regime whose President 
last night on American television 
deemed the reality of the Holocaust— 
deemed it false—denied the reality of 
the Holocaust. It denied Israel’s very 
right to exist. 
Iran-backed Hizballah consistently 
threatens Israel and its citizens with 
drones, missiles, threats of invasion, 
and undermines stability and economic 
opportunity in Lebanon. What’s more, 
the organization supports the brutal 
Assad regime and is complicit in its 
murder of more than half a million 
people from the ongoing conflict in 
Syria. 
The facts are clear: Around the 
world, Hizballah should be designated 
as a terrorist organization in its en-
tirety. 
That is why I stand in support of this 
resolution: as global partners of the 
United States and key players in the 
international rules-based order, the EU 
must designate all of Hizballah as a 
terrorist organization so we can in-
crease global cooperation to isolate 
and dismantle this group. 
I recognize there are legal concerns 
from our European friends that desig-
nating all of Hizballah as a terrorist 
organization could prevent support for 
the Lebanese people, as Hizballah has 
infiltrated the country’s political sys-
tem. 
The EU rightful recognizes Hamas in 
its entirety as a terrorist organization, 
despite that fact that Hamas operates 
as a political party in Gaza. This does 
not impact the EU’s ability to support 
Gaza reconstruction, just as desig-
nating Hizballah as a whole would not 
prevent the EU from supporting the 
needs of the people of Lebanon, and the 
refugees inside Lebanon. 
It is time for the EU to fix this false 
distinction once and for all, and the 
global momentum is on our side. In 
2016, the Gulf Cooperation Council and 
the 
Arab 
League 
both 
designated 
Hizballah as a terrorist organization 
with no distinction between its polit-
ical and military wings, despite Leb-
anon being a member of the Arab 
League. The EU should take note of 
that. 
A full EU designation now would 
demonstrate Europe’s commitment to 
cracking down on Iran’s use of proxy 
terrorist groups, destabilizing the re-
gion, and attacking our shared na-
tional security priorities. 
This resolution sends an important 
message to our European allies. More 
can and must be done to counter the 
Iranian proxy Hizballah, which begins 
with calling them what they are, a ter-
rorist organization in its entirety that 
is committed to the destruction of our 
ally, Israel, and continues to under-
mine the values and interests of both 
the United States and Europe. It is 
time for the EU to join us in desig-
nating Hizballah in its entirety. A 
nearly identical measure passed the 
House in 2017 by voice vote. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute and 30 sec-
onds to the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I came to 
Congress in April 2010 committed to 
standing up to Iran’s malign activities, 
and support for Hizballah is a prime ex-
ample. As I prepare to conclude my 
time in this Chamber, I urge my col-
leagues to continue to unite the world 
against Iran’s terror proxies and to 
boldly take action to ensure Iran never 
has nuclear weapons; never forgets 
that the U.S. will always stand against 
its human rights violations, against its 
support for terror, against its anti- 
Semitism, against its call for Israel’s 
destruction, against its unlawfully de-
tention of Americans—Morad Tahbaz, 
Emad Sharghi, Siamak Namazi, Baquer 
Namazi, and refuses to bring closure to 
the family of Bob Levinson. 
My colleagues, we must continue to 
stand up to Iran’s aggression. Today’s 
vote is a vote to urge our European al-
lies to designate all of Hizballah—what 
it is—an Iran-backed terror proxy. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for their cooperation on this bill, and I 
thank them for their friendship all 
these many years. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly agree with 
Representative DEUTCH. I have always 
believed the first principle of foreign 
policy is to call things by their proper 
name. Sometimes we have to be prag-
matic in our dealings around the world, 
but always start by being honest. 
Hizballah is a terrorist organization.

HELEN KELLER NATIONAL CEN-
TER REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 
2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I move to suspend the rules and pass 
the bill (H.R. 1433) to reauthorize the 
Helen 
Keller 
National 
Center 
for 
Youths and Adults Who Are Deaf- 
Blind, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1433 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Helen Keller 
National Center Reauthorization Act of 
2022’’. 
SEC. 2. HELEN KELLER NATIONAL CENTER REAU-
THORIZED. 
The first sentence of section 205(a) of the 
Helen Keller National Center Act (29 U.S.C. 
1904(a)) is amended by striking ‘‘1999 through 
2003’’ and inserting ‘‘2023 through 2027’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
SEMPOLINSKI) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 1433, the Helen Keller National 
Center Reauthorization Act of 2022. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1433, the Helen Keller National Center 
Reauthorization Act, which would re-
authorize the Helen Keller National 
Center for 5 years. 
The Helen Keller National Center for 
Youths and Adults Who Are Deaf-Blind 
was first authorized by Congress in 1967 
to assist the deaf-blind community in 
America. 
To this day, it is the only com-
prehensive national program that pro-
vides information, referrals, support, 
and training exclusively to Americans 
who have combined vision and hearing 
loss, while also supporting families and 
professionals who work with the deaf- 
blind community. 
Moreover, the Helen Keller National 
Center is the only comprehensive na-
tional program that provides for infor-
mation, referral, support, and training 
exclusively to youth and adults who 
have combined vision and hearing loss. 
The center also supports families and 
professionals who work with the deaf- 
blind community. 
Thankfully, 
through 
our 
actions 
today, we will be one step closer to re-
authorizing 
the 
center’s 
important 
work through 2027. 
The Helen Keller center performs 
life-changing work. This work and the 
population it serves deserve all of our 
support. 
Lastly, I thank the sponsor of the 
legislation, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. POCAN), and the cosponsors, 
the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
COLE), the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. SUOZZI), and the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK), for 
their leadership on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the American deaf- 
blind community and support this bi-
partisan legislation before us. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SEMPOLINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1433, bipartisan legislation to 
reauthorize the Helen Keller National 
Center Act. 
This center is unique. In fact, it is 
the only one of its kind. Since 1967, the 
center has helped individuals with 
combined vision and hearing loss by 
providing them, as well as their fami-
lies and service providers, with special-
ized, intensive services to help them 
lead successful and independent lives. 
This includes, but isn’t limited to, ca-
reer and technical education. 
Simply put, the center offers hope 
and dignity to those it serves. This 
center is on the forefront of research in 
developing new and innovative ways 
for those that are deaf-blind to live a 
full and independent life. The end goal 
is allowing those with combined vision 
and hearing loss to work and thrive in 
communities of their choice. 
The Helen Keller National Center is 
living up to the legacy of its namesake. 
Helen Keller is the epitome of persever-
ance. She overcame every obstacle to 
lead a successful life that impacted the 
lives of so many. 
She once wrote, ‘‘A happy life con-
sists not in the absence but in the mas-
tery of hardships.’’ There is so much 
we can learn from Helen Keller’s com-
mitment to serving others despite her 
own trials. 
This bipartisan bill will ensure that 
the Helen Keller National Center con-
tinues to help deaf-blind youth and 
adults triumph over adversity, just as 
Helen Keller did more than 50 years 
ago. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill and, in doing so, em-
power those who are deaf-blind to live 
full, successful, and independent lives. 
This bill will help ensure these stu-
dents and adults have all the resources 
they need to reach their fullest poten-
tial. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
SUOZZI), a cosponsor of the legislation. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for giving me the oppor-
tunity to speak in support of H.R. 1433, 
the reauthorization of the Helen Keller 
National Center for Youths and Adults 
Who Are Deaf-Blind in our country. 
Let me start by thanking not only 
the chairman but Congressman POCAN 
and all of my colleagues who, on a bi-
partisan 
basis, 
have 
shown 
over-
whelming support for this legislation 
and the national center. 
The Helen Keller National Center for 
the Deaf-Blind, located in my district, 
is the only center of its type anywhere 
in the Nation. People from all over the 
country travel to the center for help, 
and they have regional support centers, 
as well. 
In my first 2 weeks in office, back in 
2017, I visited the Helen Keller National 
Center for the first time. I heard sto-
ries from people whose lives were 
changed and whose families’ lives were 
changed because of the miracles that 
were brought into their lives by this 
exceptional national treasure. 
People’s lives have been changed dra-
matically because of the work of this 
center supported by this Congress for 
55 years, since 1967. We need to con-
tinue to support the center. 
I thank my colleagues for the great 
work that they have done in sup-
porting it and continuing to increase 
its funding year after year. Let us keep 
working together on a bipartisan basis 
to serve the people of our country, es-
pecially this vulnerable population. 
Imagine what it would be like to be 
deaf and blind. 
This is truly a national treasure, and 
I thank my colleagues for their sup-
port. 
Mr. SEMPOLINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of reauthorizing the 
Helen Keller National Center Act. 
Helen Keller’s story is an example of 
determination and hard work. Not only 
did she overcome her difficulties, but

she worked tirelessly to better the 
lives of others. In doing so, she showed 
the world there were no boundaries. 
That is how the center looks at its 
work and those who it serves. 
As a parent of a child with a dis-
ability, this issue is very near and dear 
to my heart, so I am glad to have this 
time today to share my thoughts and 
experiences. I know firsthand the im-
portance of each child with a disability 
having every possible opportunity to 
succeed and thrive. Any parent of a 
child with any disability can tell you 
that their top priority is to provide the 
very best for their children’s education 
and growth. 
I will work tirelessly in and out of 
Congress for the disability community. 
This is one of many reasons why I sup-
port this bill. Today’s bipartisan legis-
lation will allow the center to continue 
its invaluable research and develop-
mental programs in several areas, in-
cluding communication techniques and 
teaching methods. 
All of this leads to improved program 
offerings and, ultimately, better lives 
for deaf-blind Americans and their 
families. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1433. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation will 
help members of the deaf-blind commu-
nity across the country. I thank the 
gentleman from New York for his lead-
ership, along with the sponsors and co-
sponsors of the legislation. I am proud 
that the House is considering this leg-
islation today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and 
I yield back the balance of my time.

BRIDGING THE GAP FOR NEW 
AMERICANS ACT 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I move to suspend the rules and pass

SEMPOLINSKI) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on S. 3157, the Bridging the Gap for 
New Americans Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, each year, millions of 
immigrants and refugees come to the 
United States to find a better life and 
achieve the American Dream. Many of 
these new Americans arrive with valu-
able experiences in specialized fields 
and international degrees that could 
help strengthen our communities and 
our economy. 
Regrettably, we know that these 
Americans face barriers that prevent 
them from utilizing their skills and 
credentials to contribute to our coun-
try and pursue their careers. In fact, 
nearly 2 million highly skilled immi-
grants are underemployed or working 
in low-skilled jobs instead of their ex-
pert fields. 
These barriers directly affect our 
economy, costing tens of billions of 
dollars in forgone wages and billions in 
lost Federal, State, and local tax pay-
ments each year. 
In response, the Bridging the Gap for 
New Americans Act will help us better 
understand not only the employment 
barriers facing immigrants and refu-
gees but also steps we can take to en-
sure that new Americans can join our 
economic growth and pursue careers in 
which they can succeed to their fullest 
potential. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.

September 19, 2022 
Mr. SEMPOLINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Bridging the Gap for New Americans 
Act. I applaud our colleagues in the 
Senate for approving this bill this sum-
mer by unanimous consent. I also ac-
knowledge our colleague, Mr. JOHN 
KATKO, for his work on a companion 
bill in the House. 
S. 3157 directs the Secretary of Labor 
to conduct a study on barriers to em-
ployment for legal immigrants and ref-
ugees who earn their professional cre-
dentials somewhere other than the 
United States. The study will also in-
clude policy recommendations for bet-
ter helping these immigrants and refu-
gees obtain skill-appropriate employ-
ment in the United States. 
Obstacles for foreign-educated immi-
grants and refugees who are legally in 
the United States but are unemployed 
or underemployed include language 
barriers, credential recognition dif-
ficulties, regulatory hurdles, and a 
lack of professional networks to offer 
assistance. 
This underutilization of skills, or 
brain waste, is costing the United 
States billions of dollars per year in 
lost individual earnings, economic out-
put, and tax revenue. 
The healthcare sector is especially 
impacted by this challenge. Two mil-
lion immigrants with college degrees 
in the United States have been rel-
egated to low-wage jobs or unable to 
find work, often because of licensing, 
credential recognition, and other bar-
riers. This leaves immigrants and refu-
gees unable to contribute fully to the 
economy, reach their full potential, or 
secure the American Dream. 
In 
addition 
to 
providing 
rec-
ommendations for addressing these 
challenges for individual immigrants 
and their families, S. 3157 will benefit 
all Americans and our economy. With 
too many jobs still going unfilled and a 
rapidly evolving labor market, it is 
vital we address this issue now. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 3157, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. CROW), the chair of 
the Subcommittee on Innovation, En-
trepreneurship, and Workforce Devel-
opment of the Small Business Com-
mittee. 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of S. 3157, a bill to help 
eliminate barriers to employment fac-
ing immigrants and refugees across the 
country. 
I represent one of the most diverse 
districts in Colorado, and we know in 
Colorado and in my community that 
diversity is our strength. 
Many 
of 
our 
immigrant 
refugee 
neighbors have skills and professional 
credentials they can’t use because of 
regulatory 
hurdles. 
These 
hurdles, 
whether language barriers, difficulty in 
recognizing credentials, or a lack of 
professional networks, prevent many 
from making a good living for their 
families or contributing fully to our 
economy in reaching their full poten-
tial. 
The 
unemployment 
and 
under-
employment of these folks is a missed 
opportunity for our businesses, for our 
community, and for our country. 
In 2016, across the U.S., nearly 2 mil-
lion immigrants with college degrees 
were unable to find work or were em-
ployed in low-wage jobs. This includes 
more than one-third of the 11,000 immi-
grants in the State of Colorado with 
health-related undergraduate degrees 
in 2020. 
Identifying these barriers to full em-
ployment for these immigrants and ref-
ugees is an essential first step to over-
coming them. This bill would direct 
the Department of Labor to conduct a 
collaborative interagency study of the 
barriers that hold back refugees and 
immigrants from their full potential. 
I thank Senator KLOBUCHAR and Con-
gressman KATKO for their diligence in 
this effort, and I urge my colleagues to 
join us in supporting passage of this 
bill today. 
Mr. SEMPOLINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. KATKO), my friend. 
b 1615 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of S. 3157, the Bridging the Gap 
for New Americans Act. This legisla-
tion’s journey to the House floor began 
in my office 3 years ago and was born 
out of a conversation with Interfaith 
Works of Central New York, a non-
profit in my district. 
Interfaith Works serves the Central 
New York community by working to 
resettle individuals and families that 
have fled unimaginable hardship, seek-
ing opportunity and prosperity legally, 
legally, in the United States. 
As advocates from the organization 
with firsthand experience described, 
Interfaith’s resettlement efforts con-
sistently encounter a troubling trend; 
underemployment 
or 
unemployment 
among individuals that come to Amer-
ica with professional degrees and cer-
tifications from other countries. 
This phenomenon, often referred to 
as ‘‘brain waste,’’ impacts individuals 
with skills and experiences in a wide 
range of in-demand fields, and it is by 
no means isolated to Central New 
York. 
A study by the Migration Policy In-
stitute estimated that 2 million immi-
grants and refugees with college de-
grees have been relegated to low-wage 
jobs or left unemployed in the U.S., 
with 60 percent of these individuals 
holding credentials in the healthcare 
sector. 
On an annual basis, this untapped 
talent is estimated to cost nearly $40 
billion in uncollected wages and over 
$10 billion in unrealized tax receipts. 
Simply put, these are individuals 
who came to our country through the 
proper channels—and I can’t stress 
that enough—who want to contribute 
to our economy, and who are now fac-
ing significant obstacles in seeking em-
ployment through no fault of their 
own. 
Most concerningly, the underutiliza-
tion of their skills comes in the midst 
of a nationwide workforce crisis, when 
our economy needs their contributions 
more than nearly any point in my life-
time. 
So, what is Congress going to do 
about it? 
I am proud to say that the Bridging 
the Gap for New Americans Act takes a 
significant first step in addressing 
brain waste and enabling millions of 
individuals who are already legally 
present in the United States to partici-
pate fully in our economy. 
This bill would seek to identify the 
underlying factors that contribute to 
brain waste by directing the Depart-
ment of Labor to study existing bar-
riers and issue recommendations to 
help combat them. 
Critically, the narrowly tailored con-
sensus approach taken by this legisla-
tion has already received strong bipar-
tisan support, with the legislation 
passing in the Senate by unanimous 
consent earlier this year. 
The Bridging the Gap for New Ameri-
cans Act also has significant support 
nationwide and has been endorsed by 
over 200 workforce development groups 
and community organizations. 
I 
thank 
Representatives 
CROW, 
FITZPATRICK, and GOTTHEIMER for join-
ing me in introducing the House 
version of this bill in a bipartisan man-
ner, as well as Senators KLOBUCHAR and 
CORNYN for their work to move this 
legislation through the Senate. 
I also thank the hundreds of national 
advocates who have worked tirelessly 
to raise awareness surrounding this 
brain waste and to build support for 
this commonsense legislation. 
This bill is about upholding the 
American Dream and unlocking oppor-
tunities for millions of workers, and I 
urge all my colleagues to join me in 
voting to send it to the President’s 
desk. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I am prepared to close. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SEMPOLINKSI. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the Bridging the Gap for New 
Americans Act. This bill will help us 
understand how to give legal immi-
grants with professional credentials 
more access to opportunities in our 
country. 
Immigrants and refugees who spent 
years earning college degrees and pro-
fessional credentials should not be rel-
egated to low-wage jobs because they 
were educated outside of the United 
States. 
Those pursuing a better life and re-
specting our laws should be com-
mended, not punished. S. 3157 will shed 
light on the bureaucratic hurdles and

unnecessary red tape these workers 
face and how we might remove these 
obstacles. 
It would be foolish of us to let good 
talent go to waste, especially as our 
country continues to face a labor 
shortage, 
particularly 
in 
the 
healthcare sector. 
This legislation is common sense. It 
will help immigrants and refugees who 
are in our country legally fulfill their 
potential, better provide for their fami-
lies, and become even more of an asset 
to our economy. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues have 
pointed out, the Bridging the Gap for 
New Americans Act is particularly 
critical as we continue to recover from 
the economic consequences of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Now, more than 
ever, we must draw from the skills of 
our Nation’s immigrants and refugees 
to 
accelerate 
our 
recovery 
and 
strengthen our communities. 
In other words, this bill will ensure 
that the new Americans can re-estab-
lish their careers, succeed to their full 
potential, and join the effort to build 
back a brighter future for all Ameri-
cans. 
I thank the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. SEMPOLINSKI), the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. KATKO), the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. CROW), the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr.

as Senator KLOBUCHAR of Minnesota, 
Senator CORNYN
of Texas, Senator 
COONS of Delaware, and Senator MUR-
KOWSKI from Alaska, for their leader-
ship on this legislative priority. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.

NO TRAFFICKING ZONES ACT 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7566) to amend title 18, 
United States Code, to increase the 
punishment for human trafficking in a 
school zone, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7566 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘No Trafficking 
Zones Act’’ or the ‘‘NTZ Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds as follows: 
(1) Child sex trafficking can have devastating 
immediate and long-term consequences, includ-
ing health impacts, psychological and physical 
trauma, and even death. 
(2) While any child can be targeted by a traf-
ficker, research, data, survivors’ lived experi-
ences, and expertise have revealed that traf-
fickers often target vulnerable youth who lack 
strong support networks, supervision, care, or 
basic necessities, have low self-esteem, have ex-
perienced violence in the past, are experiencing 
homelessness, are experiencing academic dif-
ficulties, or are marginalized by society, and 
lure them into forced labor and prostitution and 
other forms of sexual exploitation. Traffickers 
are masters of manipulation and prey upon 
vulnerabilities using psychological pressure, in-
timidation, and drugs to control and sexually 
exploit the child for their benefit. 
(3) The National Center for Missing and Ex-
ploited Children (NCMEC) has received reports 
of child sex trafficking in all 50 States, the Dis-
trict of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. These re-
ports include incidents occurring in every type 
of 
community, 
including 
suburban, 
rural, 
urban, and Tribal lands. In 2021, NCMEC re-
ceived more than 17,200 reports of possible child 
sex trafficking. 
(4) Of 22,326 trafficking victims and survivors 
identified through contacts with the National 
Human Trafficking Hotline in 2019, at least 
5,359 were under age 18. 
(5) Many underage victims of sex trafficking 
are students in the United States school system. 
No community, school, socioeconomic group, or 
student demographic is immune. 
(6) While the internet and social media make 
up the majority of first encounters, traffickers 
regularly find young people in shopping malls, 
through friends, at bus stops, and at schools. 
Specifically, traffickers systematically target 
vulnerable children and youth by frequenting 
locations where young people congregate, in-
cluding schools. They also use peers or class-
mates, who befriend the target and slowly groom 
them for the trafficker by bringing the young 
person along to parties and other activities. 
(7) A 2018 survey reported that 55 percent of 
young sex trafficking survivors in Texas were 
trafficked while at school or school activities 
and 60 percent of trafficked adults say they 
were first groomed and solicited for trafficking 
on school campuses. 
(8) Schools can and should be safe havens for 
students. Schools are best positioned to identify 
and report suspected trafficking and connect af-
fected students to critical services. Students are 
more likely to report instances of sex trafficking, 
attempted sex trafficking, or grooming for the 
purposes of sex trafficking where they feel most 
safe from harm and threats. 
SEC. 3. INCREASED PUNISHMENT FOR HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING IN SCHOOL ZONES. 
Section 1591 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended— 
(1) by redesignating subsection (e) as sub-
section (f); and 
(2) by inserting after subsection (d) the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(e)(1) Whoever violates subsection (a) in a 
school zone, or on, or within 1,000 feet of, a 
premises on which a school-sponsored activity is 
taking place, or on, or within 1,000 feet of a 
premises owned by an institution of higher edu-
cation, shall, in addition to the punishment oth-
erwise provided under this section, be impris-
oned for not more than 5 years. 
‘‘(2) In this subsection: 
‘‘(A) The term ‘school zone’ has the meaning 
given such term in section 921. 
‘‘(B) The term ‘school-sponsored activity’ 
means any activity that is produced, financed, 
arranged, supervised, or coordinated by a school 
or a State educational agency or local edu-
cational agency or is under the jurisdiction of a 
State educational agency or local educational 
agency. 
‘‘(C) The terms ‘State educational agency’ 
and ‘local educational agency’ have the mean-
ings given those terms under section 8101 of the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965. 
‘‘(D) The term ‘institution of higher edu-
cation’ has the meaning given such term in sec-
tion 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
U.S.C. 1001).’’. 
SEC. 4. INCREASED PUNISHMENT FOR COERCION 
AND 
ENTICEMENT 
IN 
SCHOOL 
ZONES. 
Section 2422 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended— 
(1) in subsection (b), by striking ‘‘individual 
who has not attained the age of 18 years’’ and 
inserting ‘‘minor’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(c)(1) Whoever violates subsection (a) or (b) 
knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, 
that the violation is committed against a minor 
who is enrolled in school and is, at the time of 
the violation, in a school zone or on, or within 
1,000 feet of, a premises on which a school-spon-
sored activity is taking place, or against a per-
son who is enrolled in an institution of higher 
education and is, at the time of the violation on 
or within 1,000 feet of a premises owned by the 
institution of higher education, shall, in addi-
tion to the punishment otherwise provided 
under this section, be imprisoned for not more 
than 5 years. 
‘‘(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply in a case 
in which a minor’s presence on, or within 1,000 
feet of, the premises on which a school-spon-
sored activity is taking place is not related to 
such school-sponsored activity, or the person’s 
presence on or within 1,000 feet of the premises 
owned by the institution of higher education is 
not related to their enrollment at such institu-
tion. 
‘‘(d) In this section: 
‘‘(1) The term ‘minor’ means an individual 
who has not attained 18 years of age. 
‘‘(2) The term ‘school’ means a public, paro-
chial, or private school that provides elementary 
or secondary education. 
‘‘(3) The term ‘school zone’ has the meaning 
given such term in section 921. 
‘‘(4) The term ‘school-sponsored activity’ 
means any activity that is produced, financed, 
arranged, supervised, or coordinated by a school 
or a State educational agency or local edu-
cational agency or is under the jurisdiction of a 
State educational agency or local educational 
agency. 
‘‘(5) The terms ‘State educational agency’ and 
‘local educational agency’ have the meanings 
given those terms under section 8101 of the Ele-
mentary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. 
‘‘(6) The term ‘institution of higher education’ 
has the meaning given such term in section 101 
of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1001).’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous materials on H.R. 7566, as 
amended.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7915 
September 19, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill was introduced 
as an important response to stopping 
human trafficking and sex trafficking 
at schools. In fact, its name was Stop 
Human Trafficking in School Zones. I 
introduced that bill to stop human 
trafficking in school zones. 
I am glad to be here on the floor of 
the House to continue this journey in 
protecting our children. I want to start 
with the words from the Major Cities 
Chiefs Association, one of the major 
supporters of this legislation: 
Child sex trafficking is one of the 
most despicable crimes an individual 
can commit. Sadly, there are far too 
many 
children 
victimized 
by 
this 
scourge. For example, the National 
Center for Missing and Exploited Chil-
dren received more than 17,200 reports 
of possible child sex trafficking in 2021. 
It is especially troubling that these 
crimes sometimes occur at schools 
which should be a safe haven for Amer-
ica’s children. 
Besides gun violence, human traf-
ficking, sex trafficking is a scourge 
that takes and destroys the lives of our 
children. 
H.R. 7566 will play an important part 
in addressing child sex trafficking by 
establishing additional penalties for of-
fenders who commit these offenses in a 
school zone or within 1,000 feet of a 
school-sponsored activity. 
We want to be heard on stopping 
human trafficking and sex trafficking 
at our schools. And so the No Traf-
ficking Zones Act, which was formerly 
the Stop Human Trafficking in Schools 
Act, would ensure that schools across 
the country, including institutions of 
higher learning, are safe spaces for 
learning and academic exploration, 
free from the menace of sex traf-
ficking. 
H.R. 7566 would establish a sen-
tencing enhancement of up to 5 years 
in several instances: First, in the case 
of any person who commits the offense 
of sex trafficking within a primary or 
secondary school zone or on or within 
1,000 feet of the premises of a school- 
sponsored activity, or premises owned 
by an institution of higher learning. 
Second, for any person who commits 
the offense of coercion and enticement 
of a minor enrolled in a primary or a 
secondary school, or a person enrolled 
in an institution of higher learning, to 
travel in interstate or foreign com-
merce and engage in criminal sexual 
activity while the minor is in a school 
zone, or on or within 1,000 feet of prem-
ises where a school-sponsored activity 
is taking place, or while the person is 
on or within 1,000 feet of the premises 
owned by the institution of higher edu-
cation. 
And third, for any person who com-
mits the offense of coercion and entice-
ment of a minor using the mail or fa-
cilities of interstate or foreign com-
merce, such as the text and instant 
messaging or social media platforms 
which have been used extensively, 
while the minor who is enrolled in 
school or an institution of higher edu-
cation, is in a school zone, or on or 
within 1,000 feet of premises where a 
school-sponsored activity is taking 
place, or premises owned by the insti-
tution of higher education. 
Human trafficking is one of the 
greatest threats to human rights in the 
United States. It destroys a human 
being’s life, and it destroys, forever, a 
child’s life. 
In 2020, 11,193 instances of potential 
human trafficking were reported to the 
United States National Human Traf-
ficking Hotline, with at least 70 per-
cent of those instances involving sex 
trafficking, while an estimated 25 per-
cent of all human trafficking victims 
in this country are in my home State 
of Texas at any given time, many of 
whom are minors. 
Mr. Speaker, I gave and held the first 
human trafficking hearing, field hear-
ing from Houston, Texas, with my co-
sponsor of this legislation, the honor-
able MIKE MCCAUL. I express my appre-
ciation for his collaboration on this 
legislation, his enthusiastic collabora-
tion, as he did join me when we held 
the first hearing on human trafficking 
in Houston, through the Homeland Se-
curity Committee. 
What I would say is that Houston had 
been the epicenter of human traf-
ficking. It was a powerful hearing, and 
I am glad that we have joined together 
now to stop human trafficking at 
schools. 
Let me also offer my sympathy to 
him and his family for their loss. 
At least 5,359 trafficking victims and 
survivors identified through the hot-
line in 2019 were under the age of 18. 
And in 2021, the National Center for 
Missing and Exploited Children re-
ceived more than 17,200 reports of sus-
pected child sex trafficking. Many of 
these young victims of sex trafficking 
are students in school systems, col-
leges, trade schools, and universities 
across the country. 
A 2018 survey reported that in Texas, 
where no trafficking zone legislation 
passed with bipartisan support earlier 
this year, 55 percent of young sex traf-
ficking survivors were trafficked while 
at school or school activities, and 60 
percent of trafficked adults said they 
were first groomed and solicited for 
trafficking while on school campuses. 
That has been a hotbed of oppor-
tunity for the scourge of sex traffickers 
who want to prey upon our innocent 
children. I am grateful that the legisla-
tion in Texas generated out of an effort 
chaired by Bishop James Dixon, chair 
of the Houston Sports Authority at the 
NRG Arena, and began to develop a 
policy where there would be no traf-
ficking zones around major stadiums 
and events. 
Members of this body know all too 
well that children are sexually ex-
ploited in many ways. Some young peo-
ple are trafficked by their schoolmates 
or people they once considered friends. 
And while the traffickers seek out 
young people who have noticeable vul-
nerabilities, 
including 
problems 
at 
school, conflicts at home, or even the 
need to fill in a tuition gap caused by 
the loss of a scholarship, no child or 
young person is truly safe from the 
schemes 
of 
charismatic 
traffickers 
bent on exploiting and destroying 
young lives. 
b 1630 
With 
the 
proliferation 
of 
social 
media and the myriad ways in which 
we communicate with one another, 
traffickers have put these same means 
of communication to their own use to 
find, target, lure, groom, victimize, and 
exert control over their victims while 
buyers are using technology to find and 
purchase sex anonymously. 
Traffickers have infiltrated every 
known form of communication, espe-
cially the sites, messaging apps, and 
social media platforms our children use 
most frequently, leaving young chil-
dren more vulnerable to manipulation. 
Access to the internet, cell phones, and 
smartphones 
make 
it 
easier, 
Mr. 
Speaker, for traffickers and buyers to 
communicate with children and youth. 
Even when they are at school, in 
class, or attending school-sponsored ac-
tivities, there are no barriers, no walls, 
no brick walls, cement walls, steel 
walls, that can keep a trafficker from 
getting a precious child. 
As a result, trafficking has reached 
the 
halls, 
lunchrooms, 
gyms, 
dor-
mitories, and classrooms of schools, 
colleges, and universities in every cor-
ner of the United States of America. 
These staggering facts and statistics 
led me to introduce this bipartisan leg-
islation, the No Trafficking Zones Act, 
along with Chairman NADLER and Rep-
resentative MCCAUL, who I wish to 
thank for working with me, as I have 
said previously, as well as Representa-
tive JOHNSON
of Louisiana for his 
amendment that included the protec-
tion for young people at institutions of 
higher education. 
We came together in a bipartisan 
manner to exert the influence nec-
essary to protect America’s children 
collectively. I, again, thank Chairman 
NADLER, Representative MCCAUL
of 
Texas, and Representative JOHNSON of 
Louisiana. I am delighted to work with 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, human trafficking, es-
pecially the sex trafficking of children, 
is an abhorrent crime, and all con-
victed offenders should face serious 
criminal penalties. 
This bill would provide increased 
criminal penalties for human traf-
ficking or coercing a minor to engage

near school-sponsored activities, as my 
colleague from Texas stated. 
Texas recently enacted a similar law. 
According to the Texas State Senate 
bill report, 55 percent of young sex 
trafficking survivors in Texas were 
trafficked while at school or during 
school activities. 
The Justice Department’s Office of 
Justice Programs reports that the av-
erage age of entry into prostitution is, 
unbelievably, 12 to 14 years old and 
that traffickers are known to recruit 
at schools and in after-school pro-
grams. 
However, this legislation doesn’t ad-
dress a root cause of this serious prob-
lem, our unsecure southwest border. 
Tragically, we know that human smug-
gling and trafficking occurs daily at 
the southwest border. 
Under Democrat leadership, this Con-
gress has failed to fix the completely 
broken immigration system or to ad-
dress the Biden border crisis, which 
cartels and other organized criminal 
organizations have exploited to smug-
gle and traffic children into our coun-
try. 
Cartels and criminal organizations 
continue to take advantage of the 
Biden administration’s complete fail-
ure to secure the southwest border. 
We should focus Congress’ efforts on 
securing our southwest border to pre-
vent the type of human trafficking this 
legislation seeks to address. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the issue of stopping 
human trafficking in school zones is 
such a crucial issue that I would hope 
that the focus of our debate today 
would be on saving the lives of chil-
dren. 
I will just simply make the point, 
being on the Committee on Homeland 
Security and chairing the Judiciary 
subcommittee that deals with Crime, 
Terrorism, and Homeland Security, 
that we all can work together for com-
prehensive immigration reform. 
Here we are today, specifically fo-
cused and pointed on ensuring that 
there are no trafficking zones in our 
country and specifically around our 
school zones where children cannot be 
harmed. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
letters from the Major Cities Chiefs As-
sociation; Texas State Representative 
Ron Reynolds; NAACP, Bishop James 
Dixon, Branch President; Break the 
Cycle U.S.A., Valerie Winborne, moth-
er of trafficking victim; and Courtney 
Litvak, surviving—a summary of her 
experience where she was trafficked.

DEAR REP. JACKSON LEE, REP. NADLER, AND 
REP. McCAUL: I write on behalf of the Major 
Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) to register 
our support for H.R. 7566, the Stop Human 
Trafficking in School Zones Act. The MCCA is 
a professional organization of police execu-
tives representing the largest cities in the 
United States and Canada. 
Child sex trafficking is one of the most 
despicable crimes an individual can commit. 
Sadly, there are far too many children vic-
timized by this scourge. For example, the 
National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children received more than 17,200 reports of 
possible child sex trafficking in 2021. It’s es-
pecially troubling that these crimes some-
times occur at schools, which should be a 
safe haven for America’s children. H.R. 7566 
will play an important part in addressing 
child sex trafficking by establishing addi-
tional penalties for offenders who commit 
these offenses in a school zone or within 1,000 
feet of a school-sponsored activity. These en-
hanced penalties will help establish a strong 
deterrent and ensure those who commit 
these heinous acts are held accountable. 
Thank you for your leadership and ongoing 
commitment to protecting America’s chil-
dren. Please do not hesitate to contact me if 
the MCCA can be of further assistance. 
Sincerely.

want to thank you for scheduling this impor-
tant markup of H.R. 7566, the Stop Traf-
ficking in School Zones Act, which you in-
troduced along with Representative Michael 
McCaul. The need for legislation that makes 
clear that children and youth are never to be 
trafficked or pursued by sex traffickers espe-
cially while at school or participating off- 
campus in school-sponsored activities. 
Human trafficking poses a grave danger to 
individual well-being, public health, public 
safety, national security, economic develop-
ment, and prosperity. Child and youth sex 
trafficking can have devastating immediate 
and 
long-term 
consequences, 
including 
health impacts, psychological and physical 
trauma, substance use disorders, mental 
health problems, and even death. While any 
minor can be targeted by a trafficker, traf-
fickers often target vulnerable youth, in-
cluding those who lack strong support net-
works, supervision care, have low self-es-
teem, are experiencing academic difficulties, 
are marginalized by society, or ostracized by 
their peers. No child or community is im-
mune. Recruiting and grooming occur every-
where that kids can be found, even in schools 
across the country. Traffickers frequent 
places where young people can be found, in-
cluding school-sponsored events like basket-
ball and football games, field trips, and tal-
ent shows. They also use peers and class-
mates, who befriend the traffickers’ targets 
and groom them for the trafficker by form-
ing relationships with the students and 
brining them along to parties and other ac-
tivities, slowly acclimating them to the traf-
fickers and their lifestyle. 
Targeting youth online via social media, 
direct messaging, and the like has become an 
increasingly common tactic among traf-
fickers. They will look vulnerable young 
people who are receptive to their advances. 
Grooming occurs online or in person, over an 
extended period. They gain their targets’ 
trust, fulfill their needs, make promises, 
gradually isolating them and exerting con-
trol over their lives—sometimes virtually. 
Technology has made it much easier for traf-
fickers to seek out children and youth. 
To that end, we would like to express our 
strong support for H.R. 7566 because young 
people should be safe at all times—but espe-
cially while they are trying to learn or pur-
sue school-related endeavors that enhance 
their 
educational 
experiences. 
We 
are 
thrilled that the House Judiciary Committee 
will condenser this legislation that would es-
tablish a sentencing enhancement for those 
who would dare to commit sex trafficking or 
contact young people for such purposes while 
they are at school-sponsored activities and 
encourage members to vote yes. 
We thank you for your leadership and as 
survivors and advocated dedicated to eradi-
cating human trafficking, we are grateful for 
your commitment to ensuring that those 
who choose to target and victimize children 
will be held accountable.

DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER AND CHAIRWOMAN 
LEE: NTZ is a bi-partisan organization dis-
rupting the criminal activity of human traf-
ficking. NTZ’s mission is to create No Traf-
ficking Zones across the nation. In order to 
create no trafficking zones, we must have 
policies set in place to protect our commu-
nities from commercial sexual exploitation 
and human trafficking. Children in America 
are being preyed upon every single day in 
schools across our nation. In 2021, NTZ was a 
part of the creation of the S.B.1831 ‘‘No Traf-
ficking Zone Act’’ for schools in Texas. The 
‘‘No Trafficking Zone Act was authored by 
Rep. Senator Larry Taylor, was carried in 
the House by State Representative Senfronia 
Thompson, and approved with 100 percent bi-
partisan support. Our belief is there needs to 
be unity in fighting for the protection of our 
great Nation’s children. 
In this letter, you will hear testimonies of 
Mother and the names of their daughters. 
You will learn brutal detail of what is sex 
trafficking. Sex trafficking is the slave trade 
where a person is raped and owned by an-
other. 
We want to thank you for scheduling this 
important markup of H.R. 7566, the Stop 
Trafficking in School Zones Act, which you 
introduced along with Representative Mi-
chael McCaul. America needs legislation 
that makes it clear, that children and youth 
are never to be commercially sexually ex-
ploited or pursued by sex traffickers, espe-
cially while at school or participating off- 
campus in school-sponsored activities 
An Alarming Fact: Did you know that 60 
percent of trafficked adults say they were 
first introduced to trafficking (groomed or 
solicited) on school campuses? 
We have support across the nation. Parents 
and families want their children safe while 
they are at school. Parents and families 
across our country are picking up the pieces 
of destruction as their children are being 
groomed and lured on school campuses or 
during school functions. We have human 
trafficking 
detectives, 
advocates, 
social 
workers, parents, elected officials, law en-
forcement leaders, school district super-
intendents, board members, PTO parents, 
survivor leaders, nurses, doctors, and anti- 
trafficking specialists coming together to 
say enough is enough. We need laws to pro-
tect our youth while they are in school from 
sexual predators. This is happening in all 
communities across our nation. 
The term ‘‘institutional grooming’’ de-
scribes the perpetrator using a position of 
trust to gain access to a child/youth and 
avoid detection. Perpetrators of grooming 
can use online and offline methods to reach 
their victims. 
Valerie Winbornes’s daughter was traf-
ficked in Virginia. She like most families 
said she received no help and there was no 
justice for her twelve-year-old daughter who 
was trafficked from her school. 
Madelynn Bennetsen. She trusted a girl in 
JH who she thought was her friend—who 
would later lead her on the path of skipping 
class, running away from home, drugs, and 
trafficking. If there were more awareness 
and training for the staff in the school and 
even myself. We may have been more alert to 
these behaviors as red flags instead of teen-
age behavior problems. We make it our life’s 
work to help others in honor of Mady. Mady 
was murdered by her trafficker and never re-
turned home. 
Mary Well’s daughter was a target because 
she had Autism. She also was a young girl 
who was murdered and never returned home. 
Courtney Litvack was trafficked out of 
Katy Texas. Katy is a suburban wealthy area 
in Harris County. She was sold to multiple 
traffickers and eventually taken to Las 
Vegas. Her family as all of these other fami-
lies will express with grief that there was no 
justice. 
Leddie a fifteen-year-old girl committed 
suicide after she could not get the proper 
help after being recovered from being sex 
trafficked. 
Do you know traffickers pick out young 
girls on tick tok and Instagram and tell 
groomers to go lure them from school? In 
many states, the traffickers introduce girls 
as young as twelve to strip clubs. Fourteen 
and fifteen-year-old girls are trafficked by 
gangs, pimps, and organized crime and then 
‘‘trained’ and ‘‘broken in’ at strip clubs. 
They will form a trauma bond with many of 
their traffickers and such a level of shame 
that most girls will not know how to leave 
even if they physically can. They will also 
have the girls become addicted to drugs be-
coming numb to being raped. The teen’s ad-
diction will have them not knowing or un-
derstanding everything that is happening 
and controlling them through their addic-
tion and abuse. I have given definitions to 
the terms in this paragraph. 
NTZ and I want to express our gratitude 
for scheduling this important markup of 
H.R. 7566, the Stop Trafficking in School 
Zones Act, which you introduced along with 
Representative Michael McCaul. The need 
for legislation that makes clear that chil-
dren and youth are never to be trafficked or 
pursued by sex traffickers, especially while 
at school or participating off-campus in 
school-sponsored activities. Every day kids 
are going missing and are being sex traf-
ficked from their schools or were contacted 
at their school. We must change this. This is 
unacceptable. Nelsen Mandela said There can 
be no keener revelation of a society’s soul 
than the way in which it treats its children. 
To that end, we would like to express our 
strong support for H.R. 7566 because young 
people should be safe at all times—but espe-
cially while they are trying to learn or pur-
sue school-related endeavors that enhance

COURTNEY LITVAK 
Courtney has made it her mission to tell 
her story and speak out to spread awareness 
about human trafficking and help shape pol-
icy to protect other young people from fall-
ing victim to the schemes of human traf-
fickers, and to hold traffickers accountable. 
Courtney first became entangled in sex 
trafficking when she was still in high school. 
Despite what some believe about victims of 
human trafficking, she grew up in a loving, 
church-going family, in a safe neighborhood, 
and attended an upscale, suburban high 
school in Texas. But, by the age of 17 she was 
under the control of her first trafficker and 
she was being advertised for illicit sex on 
websites like Backpage.com. 
Courtney was a junior in high school when 
a series of traumatic experiences occurred, 
leaving her emotionally and physically sus-
ceptible and in a downward spiral—like so 
many victims of human trafficking. She 
began participating in high-risk behaviors, 
including abusing drugs and alcohol. 
A trafficker, with ties to her high school, 
used fellow students to prey upon her and 
use her vulnerabilities to their advantage— 
offering her friendship and support when she 
felt she had none, meanwhile drawing her 
gradually and deeper into ‘‘the life.’’ 
Courtney was actually being groomed by 
two different organized crime networks si-
multaneously and each groomer chatted 
with her through social media and messaging 
other apps. One network even invested in 
grooming Courtney for almost an entire 
year. She grew to trust these people, who 
were in fact all friends of friends and all for-
merly attended her high school. 
Her first trafficker picked her up from her 
school on multiple occasions. Consequently, 
she was unenrolled from her school and had 
her entire life uprooted in a desperate at-
tempt for her family to intervene in her ex-
ploitation. Courtney returned back to her 
hometown where days after turning 18 she 
was taken from her home by the other in-
vested trafficking network. She soon real-
ized that this individual she thought she 
loved meant to pass her on to her next traf-
ficker for a finder’s fee of $500. 
Eventually, Courtney would be transported 
from Texas to California, then, Las Vegas— 
passing from the clutches of one trafficker to 
another. 
The coercive tactics of her captors varied 
from subtle to overt, physical to psycho-
logical—from violent to caring. 
On an occasion when she attempted to seek 
help, law enforcement officials treated her 
like a criminal, convincing her that the 
safest place for her was with her trafficker. 
Fortunately, after years of exploitation, 
overdoses, and mulitple suicide attempts, 
Courtney escaped her final trafficker in 2018. 
She sought trauma counseling and attended 
an intense out of state recovery program, be-
came a consultant, and, in 2020, was ap-
pointed to the U.S. Advisory Council on 
Human Trafficking. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
would just simply like to suggest that 
we can find trafficking in many other 
places. 
I also include in the RECORD the arti-
cle: ‘‘Epstein’s ‘ground zero’: How the 
financier reportedly wreaked havoc on 
Royal Palm Beach High School com-
munity.’’ 
[From Business Insider, July 27, 2019] 
EPSTEIN’S
‘GROUND
ZERO’: HOW
THE
FIN-
ANCIER
REPORTEDLY
WREAKED
HAVOC
ON 
THE ROYAL PALM BEACH HIGH SCHOOL COM-
MUNITY 
(By Kat Tenbarge) 
Former Royal Palm Beach High School As-
sistant Principal Carolyn Brown told The 
Palm Beach Post it was an ‘‘open secret’’ 
that female students were involved in some-
thing suspicious that involved hundreds of 
dollars in cash and resulted in girls being 
bullied for being ‘‘prostitutes’’ and ‘‘sugar 
babies.’’ 
What administers didn’t know, or at least 
didn’t act upon, was that at least 15 under-
age girls enrolled at the high school were 
sexually assaulted by financier and now con-
victed sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, accord-
ing to police reports obtained by The Palm 
Beach Post. 
Like dozens of other accusations against 
the shadowy financier, who is currently 
being held without bail on charges of sex 
trafficking of minors and conspiracy in the 
southern district of New York, Epstein’s 
Royal Palm Beach High accusers say he paid 
them to give him massages, during which he 
would coerce them into sex acts. 
Epstein was well aware that his victims 
would have been high schoolers, since The 
Post reported that a Royal Palm Beach High 
transcript was found in 2005 in his bedroom 
desk drawer at his $12 million Palm Beach 
estate, next to a massage table and an 
armoire filled with sex toys. 
One Royal Palm Beach High accuser told 
police she was 16-years-old when Epstein 
asked her to give him a massage while she 
was topless. She said she told him she was in 
high school. He asked what her favorite sex 
position was. 
Another 16-year-old told police Epstein 
said he would help her get into her dream 
college, New York University, after review-
ing her SAT scores and high school tran-
script. 
Epstein also wrote a note on his own Jef-
frey E. Epstein-branded stationary, Palm 
Beach police officers found, which instructed 
an employee to deliver a dozen roses to an 
underage girl who performed in a Royal 
Palm Beach High play. Police found the note 
in Epstein’s garbage in 2005. 
These findings were some of the evidence 
brought forward before Epstein signed a plea 
deal in 2008 that allowed him to avoid federal 
prosecution and serve 13 months of an 18- 
month prison sentence, during which he 
could work from a high-rise in Palm Beach 
12 hours a day, 6 days a week. 
Now, Epstein is pleading not guilty to sex 
trafficking charges that accuse the elite fin-
ancier of assaulting upward of 80 women, 
many who were underage at the time of the 
assault, including some as young as 14. The 
Palm Beach Post reports that Epstein re-
cruited girls from several Palm Beach, Flor-
ida high schools, but that Royal Palm Beach 
High was his ‘‘ground zero.’’ 
The Post reports that girls who were part 
of Epstein’s underage sexual assault scheme 
were bullied for being ‘‘prostitutes’’ and 
‘‘sugar babies,’’ which administrators took 
notice of when they found $300 in a girl’s 
purse after she was caught fighting with an-
other female student. 
Attorney Adam Horowitz, who has rep-
resented some of Epstein’s accusers in eight 
civil lawsuits, was quoted as describing the 
girls who were allegedly targeted as vulner-
able, with some ‘‘living in trailer parks,’’ in 
The Post. 
Epstein asked girls to bring their friends, 
The Post reported, paying girls up to $200 for 
recruiting new victims. ‘‘The younger the 
better,’’ he instructed them, according to 
one accuser who was first approached by an 
adult who worked for Epstein in 2003 at a re-
sort in Riviera Beach. 
That accuser went into her senior year at 
Royal Palm Beach High with Epstein’s goal 
in mind, with The Post reporting she re-
cruited at least eight other underage girls 
who then recruited their own friends, includ-
ing some girls who were on the verge of 
homelessness and needed money, badly. 
‘‘Knowing what we know now, it’s so sad 
what happened to those girls,’’ Brown, the 
former assistant principal, told The Post.

(By Lulu Ramadan) 
Tucked in the drawer of Jeffrey Epstein’s 
bedroom desk, near a massage table and a 
wooden armoire filled with sex toys, was a 
teenage girl’s Royal Palm Beach High School 
transcript. 
She was 16 years old when Epstein lured 
her to his Palm Beach home set at the end of 
a dead-end street behind a wall of hedges. 
And she’s one of at least 15 girls from 
Royal Palm Beach High School who Epstein 
sexually exploited in that bedroom 15 years 
ago, police reports reveal. 
Epstein, a multimillionaire financier then 
in his 50s, lured a procession of girls as 
young as 14 to his home to perform nude 
massages for money, police and court records 
say. The massages often ended with Epstein 
groping or sexually assaulting the girls. 
Epstein’s victims attended several Palm 
Beach County schools, including Lake Worth 
Middle and Palm Beach Gardens High. 
But Royal Palm Beach High, with about 
3,000 students, many from the county’s rural 
reaches, was ground zero. 
Evidence suggests Epstein knew his vic-
tims were school girls and the signs didn’t 
escape Royal Palm Beach High administra-
tors. The girls endured teasing and class-
mates called them ‘‘prostitutes.’’ After two 
girls fought, an administrator found one of 
them had $300 in her purse. 
Aside from the student transcript found in 
Epstein’s desk in 2005, police collected more 
evidence and witness statements that sug-
gest Epstein knew his victims were still 
school children: 
He scrawled a note on Jeffrey E. Epstein- 
branded stationery instructing one of his 
employees to deliver a dozen roses to a girl 
who performed in a Royal Palm Beach High 
play. Police found the note in his trash. 
One 16-year-old girl described to detectives 
giving Epstein a massage while she was top-
less. He asked her about herself and she told 
him she was a student at Royal Palm High. 
He then asked her which was her favorite 
sexual position, she told police. 
Another girl, who met Epstein at age 16, 
said Epstein reviewed her college applica-
tions and SAT scores and promised to help 
her get into her dream school, New York 
University. 
Though Palm Beach detectives uncovered 
these details in 2005, the Palm Beach County 
State Attorney’s Office and U.S. Attorney’s 
Office in Miami, then headed by Alexander 
Acosta, cut Epstein a plea deal that landed 
him in jail for 13 months on two charges of 
soliciting prostitution. 
This month, a decade after his release from 
a Palm Beach County jail, federal agents in 
New York arrested Epstein, 66, on charges of 
sex trafficking minors. The move came eight

months after a Miami Herald investigation 
zeroed in on Acosta’s role in Epstein’s plea 
deal and let victims tell their stories pub-
licly for the first time. 
Epstein preyed on dozens of girls, at least 
32 identified at the time by police but about 
80 identified in 2018 by the Herald. 
‘‘These girls had never even been to Palm 
Beach island,’’ said Adam Horowitz, an at-
torney who represented Epstein victims in 
eight civil lawsuits filed against the multi-
millionaire. 
‘‘Some of them were living in trailer parks. 
This was a whole new world to them.’’ 
FOR EPSTEIN: ‘THE YOUNGER THE BETTER’ 
Some of the girls told Epstein they were 
uncomfortable with being touched during 
massages, so he asked them to bring friends 
instead, police reports and court records re-
veal. 
He paid girls about the same amount, 
around $200, to recruit a friend as he paid the 
girls who stripped down and performed mas-
sages, court records show. 
Royal Palm Beach High was a target by co-
incidence. 
‘‘One of Epstein’s recruiters managed to 
infiltrate that circle,’’ Horowitz said. 
The ‘‘recruiter’’ approached a 17-year-old 
Royal Palm Beach High School student in 
2003 at a resort in Riviera Beach with an 
offer to make $200 for an hour to give a mas-
sage, she told police two years later. 
The teen went to Epstein’s seven-bedroom 
home on the Intracoastal Waterway, where 
an assistant led her up a staircase lined with 
pictures of naked young girls and into 
Epstein’s bedroom, police say. 
In keeping with descriptions to police from 
many Epstein victims, the teen found Ep-
stein wearing only a towel, which he later 
removed, before lying on a massage table. 
Epstein tried to grope her, but she resisted. 
She told him she didn’t want to be touched, 
she told detectives. 
So Epstein asked her to bring friends to his 
home for cash instead. ‘‘The younger the bet-
ter,’’ Epstein said, according to her police 
statement. 
Going into her senior year at Royal Palm 
Beach High, the girl became a conduit to the 
school, recruiting at least eight other girls 
she’d met on campus, court depositions and 
police testimonies reveal. 
And those girls recruited more girls. 
NAME-CALLING AND A FIGHT 
One Royal Palm Beach High student told 
detectives in 2005 that she targeted promis-
cuous teens on campus. Another said she 
brought a friend on the verge of homeless-
ness and strapped for cash. 
School administrators knew something un-
usual was happening, police reports show. 
Students teased the Epstein clique as 
‘‘prostitutes’’ or ‘‘sugar babies,’’ a term for 
young women who seek relationships with 
wealthy, older men, The Post learned from 
court depositions and former students. 
The tension came to the administration’s 
attention in February 2005, when a 14-year- 
old freshman, the first of Epstein’s victims 
to speak to police, got into a fight on cam-
pus with a girl who called her a ‘‘prostitute,’’ 
police said. 
But the school kept no disciplinary record 
of the fight and didn’t report anything, po-
lice learned in 2005. 
At the time, it appeared the girls were 
making money doing something nefarious, 
one former administrator, then-Assistant 
Principal Carolyn Brown, said in a brief 
interview this month. 
It was an ‘‘open secret,’’ Brown said, stop-
ping short of saying whether school adminis-
trators knew the girls were paid for sexual 
favors. 
Brown was subpoenaed to testify in the 
2005 criminal case against Epstein after she 
found $300 in the 14-year-old’s purse on cam-
pus shortly after the fight, court records re-
veal. 
Administrators considered and then dis-
missed the idea that it might be drug money, 
detectives wrote in a 2005 report. 
Brown, who is retired, never spoke to pros-
ecutors. Soon after her subpoena, federal 
prosecutors struck Epstein’s plea deal call-
ing for 18 months in county jail, registration 
as a sex offender and payments to victims. 
It wasn’t clear if the principal at the time, 
Sheila Henry, knew that more than a dozen 
students were involved with Epstein. Henry 
wasn’t mentioned in police reports and could 
not be reached for comment. 
But two former students reached by The 
Post, who asked to stay anonymous, said 
students gossiped that some girls had rich, 
older boyfriends who bought them expensive 
gifts. Six other students didn’t recall any 
such talk. 
None of the girls knew then what the pub-
lic knows now: That a Palm Beach million-
aire tapped a local high school to prey on 
girls for his sexual gratification. 
‘‘Knowing what we know now,’’ said 
Brown, the former assistant principal, ‘‘it’s 
so sad what happened to those girls.’’

POLICE: CHILDREN RECRUITING OTHER KIDS 
FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING AT SCHOOLS 
FLORIDA RANKS 3RD IN THE NATION FOR CALLS 
TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOTLINE 
(By Erik von Ancken) 
Orlando, FL.—Human trafficking is real 
and it is happening in Central Florida. 
Crystal Blanton, co-chair of the Marion 
County Human Trafficking Task Force, said 
she receives thousands of reports from the 
National Human Trafficking Hotline every 
year. 
‘‘Usually the reports are in the thousands, 
every year,’’ Blanton said. ‘‘Thousands of 
people are being human trafficked. Right 
here in Marion County and across the state 
of Florida.’’ 
Blanton said it’s not like the movies 
(‘‘Taken’’ 2008), where young girls are taken 
during their summer vacations by foreign 
human traffickers to be sold to sultans or 
sheiks. 
But local children, often as young as 12, 
are being recruited into a life of forced pros-
titution. 
‘‘I just think it’s the internet, I hate to say 
it,’’ Blanton said. ‘‘Social media has grown 
the field of human trafficking. It’s easier for 
these traffickers to make contact with vic-
tims.’’ 
Blanton said traffickers look for vulner-
able teenagers online—runaways, teenagers 
complaining about their lives and their par-
ents, young people with drug addictions—and 
befriend them. 
But human trafficking isn’t confined to 
any race or class, according to Blanton. 
Some victims were on the honor roll head-
ed to college. 
‘‘We’ve had doctors’ children who have 
been intertwined,’’ Blanton said. 
Blanton also said human traffickers align 
with students and use them and their schools 
as recruiting grounds. 
‘‘There are recruiters, juvenile recruiters 
in the schools, working with a pimp of some 
kind, and they are sent out in the schools 
and given a job to bring other minors on 
board,’’ Blanton said. 
Blanton said the task force has had success 
educating Marion County elementary, mid-
dle and high school principals in looking for 
signs of human trafficking and placing 
Human 
Trafficking 
Hotline 
posters 
in 
schools. 
Mike Lanfersiek, a sergeant at the Human 
Trafficking Squad at Orlando’s Metropolitan 
Bureau of Investigation (MBI), said the defi-
nition of human trafficking is forcing a per-
son to have sex or to work through force, 
fraud or coercion. 
‘‘Human trafficking is quite simply the ex-
ploitation of another person for commercial 
sex or forced labor,’’ Lanfersiek said. 
Lanfersiek said once victims, female or 
male, enter into the life of human traf-
ficking, they are kept there by their captor, 
taking advantage of their vulnerability. 
‘‘A vulnerability to substance abuse, the 
fear of physical beating, or withholding pass-
ports or documents, things like that,’’ 
Lanfersiek. 
Lanfersiek’s Human Trafficking Squad has 
rescued hundreds of young women and chil-
dren, often from hotels in the tourist district 
of Orange and Osceola Counties. 
‘‘Anywhere where the trafficker thinks 
there might be demand for commercial sex,’’ 
Lanfersiek said. 
Traffickers often set up their prostitution 
operation at hotels because they cater to 
visitors in town for business or pleasure who 
are looking for sex, according to Lanfersiek. 
Lanfersiek said he just rescued a 15-year- 
old girl from a hotel on International Drive. 
‘‘She had met someone on the ‘Plenty of 
Fish’ website and felt this person was her 
boyfriend, 
exploiting 
her 
vulnerabilities, 
pimping her out,’’ Lanfersiek said. 
In July, MBI agents arrested three men for 
luring a teenage girl through a social media 
app to an International Drive hotel and then 
prostituting her and having sex with her. 
In 2016, Orlando police charged two men 
with the death of a 14-year-old girl who 
they’d been allegedly prostituting, driving 
her to men’s homes to have sex. 
Lanfersiek said MBI regularly sets up un-
dercover sting operations to catch traf-
fickers and rescue victims. 
MBI analysts spend their days online, 
searching through postings by human traf-
fickers looking for victims and offering them 
for prostitution. 
Lanfersiek offered this warning: If you’re 
coming to Central Florida looking for a date 
for sex, you may get a date with an under-
cover officer.

RECRUITMENT AND ENTRAPMENT PATHWAYS OF 
MINORS INTO SEX TRAFFICKING IN CANADA 
AND THE UNITED STATES: A SYSTEMATIC RE-
VIEW 
(By Kyla Baird and Jennifer Connolly) 
Abstract—the domestic sex trafficking of 
minors is occurring across Canada and the 
United States. Understanding the routes into 
sex trafficking, including the way traffickers 
target, recruit and enmesh youth in the sex 
trade is invaluable information for service 
providers and law makers developing preven-
tion and intervention initiatives. This re-
view synthesized research on the exploi-
tation processes and tactics employed by 
traffickers in the sex trafficking of domestic 
minors in Canada and the US. The authors

searched five electronic databases and ob-
tained additional publications and grey lit-
erature through a backward search of the 
references cited in articles reviewed for in-
clusion. Inclusionary criteria included: Stud-
ies published in the English language be-
tween January 1990 and June 2020 containing 
original research with quantitative or quali-
tative data on the recruitment or pathways 
into sex trafficking for minors trafficked 
within the US and Canada. The search yield-
ed 23 eligible studies. The synthesis of the 
studies in the review converged on the no-
tion of sexual exploitation occurring on a 
continuum comprising of three components; 
the recruitment context, entrapment strate-
gies utilized by traffickers, and enmeshment 
tactics used to prolong exploitation. Find-
ings highlight the significant physical, psy-
chological and emotional hurdles faced by 
youth victims of sex trafficking and point to 
the importance of comprehensive and holis-
tic approaches to prevention and interven-
tion practices. 
Human trafficking is a global problem that 
has garnered significant international and 
national attention over the past 2 decades. 
In 2000, 140 countries signed onto the Pa-
lermo protocol agreeing that human traf-
ficking is a significant human rights viola-
tion and a criminal offense that requires pre-
vention, the protection of vulnerable popu-
lations, and the prosecution of violators of 
the protocol. In North America, both Canada 
and the United States signed this protocol 
and have since passed legislation and poli-
cies to combat human trafficking. Sex traf-
ficking became criminalized in Canada in 
2005 when human trafficking entered the 
criminal code under section 279.01 and in the 
United States in 2000 with the passing of the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA). 
Sex trafficking is one of the most common 
forms of human trafficking consisting of the 
recruitment and exploitation of an indi-
vidual through the use of threats, force, co-
ercion, deception, or abuse of power for the 
purpose of a commercial sex act (United Na-
tions Office on Drugs and Crime, 2014). A 
commercial sex act, as defined by the Amer-
ican TVPA (2000), is ‘‘any sexual act for 
which something of value is given or re-
ceived.’’ Common examples include prostitu-
tion, pornography, sexual massage parlors, 
and strip clubs. Commercial sex acts may be 
exchanged for money, drugs, shelter, cloth-
ing, or food (Cole & Anderson, 2013; Kotrla, 
2010). Sex trafficking is rampant across the 
United States and Canada (Clawson et al., 
2009; Dalley, 2010). Despite various political 
and social differences between these coun-
tries, they are united on the front of com-
bating sex trafficking within their borders 
and expanding research to support effective 
evidence-based prevention and intervention 
strategies. 
SEX TRAFFICKING OF MINORS (STM) 
Minors (under the age of 18) are overrepre-
sented among victims of sex trafficking, 
with the majority of victims recruited be-
tween 12 and 14 years of age (Jordan et al., 
2013; Smith et al., 2009). Given the elevated 
risk for minors, research and legislation 
have begun to focus on the specific issue of 
the STM. Consequently, our understanding 
of the risks for recruitment, experiences, and 
needs of underage victims is growing, and 
important policy actions have been taken. In 
the past decade, both Canada and the United 
States have passed legislation, reformed 
laws, and enacted policies to combat issues 
of the STM. Legislative changes in both Can-
ada and the United States have transformed 
the way victims are viewed and treated by 
law enforcement. More specifically, Amer-
ican and Canadian federal consent laws de-
clared minors under the age of 18 unable to 
consent to commercial sex and have shifted 
the lens of law enforcement from criminal-
izing youth in the sex trade to viewing them 
as victims (Adelson, 2008; Franchino-Olsen, 
2019). Language in research on STM has fol-
lowed suit, shifting from calling underage 
victims of sex trafficking ‘‘teen prostitutes’’ 
to ‘‘victims of STM.’’ 
On the basis of age, youth from all sectors 
of society are at risk for recruitment into 
sex 
trafficking. 
Developmental 
vulnerabilities such as identity formation, 
the need for belonging, desire for autonomy, 
desire for romantic relationships, and evolv-
ing problem-solving skills make them easily 
exploitable by traffickers who appeal to 
these vulnerabilities (Schwartz, 2015). Based 
on the growing literature, some youths are 
at greater risk for recruitment than others. 
Several risk factors for STM have been iden-
tified, including involvement with child pro-
tective services, history of childhood sexual 
abuse, homelessness, physical and emotional 
abuse, neglect, exposure to intimate partner 
violence, 
problematic 
relationships 
with 
caregivers, drug and alcohol abuse, and teen 
dating violence (Choi, 2015; Countryman- 
Roswurm, 
2012; 
Countryman-Roswurm 
& 
Bolin, 2014; Farley et al., 2005; Franchino- 
Olsen, 2019; Kotrla, 2010; Landers et al., 2017). 
Traffickers are known to be deeply percep-
tive of the developmental vulnerabilities of 
youth and target their unmet needs through 
strategic recruitment methods. 
Simply being a girl places a youth at an 
elevated risk status relative to boys (Estes & 
Weiner, 2001), with 98% of victims being 
women and girls (International Labour Orga-
nization, 2012). Adolescent girls are particu-
larly vulnerable to sexual exploitation due 
to social norms that cast gendered expecta-
tions and power imbalances in relation to 
sexual activities, with boys being expected 
to take sexual initiatives. Sexual inexperi-
ence, desire for romantic relationships, and 
insecurity among young girls can set the 
stage for manipulation and exploitation by 
adolescent boys or men (Hanna, 2002). 
Based on the differential needs and situa-
tions of youth, the recruitment and exploi-
tation of underage populations are thought 
to differ from adult populations (Bouche´ & 
Shady, 2017; Dank et al., 2014). While it may 
be riskier to traffic a youth due to increased 
policing efforts in protecting minors and 
higher sentences for STM, it has been sug-
gested that these risks are offset by the 
youth being easier to manipulate and control 
and being highly desired by purchasers, 
bringing in more money for the trafficker 
(Dank et al., 2014). Compared to adults, 
youths have greater needs for protection, 
less life experience, and are dependent on 
adults for basic needs such as food and shel-
ter, making them more vulnerable to traf-
fickers who vow to provide care, protection, 
and basic needs (Bruhns et al., 2018; Cole & 
Anderson, 2013). Given youths’ physical and 
emotional dependency on adults, some re-
search have suggested youths are more 
trusting and less able to identify traffickers’ 
coercive and manipulative strategies to en-
trap them (Cole & Sprang, 2015). Adult vic-
tims, on the other hand, are generally less 
psychologically dependent on their traf-
ficker (Bouche´ & Shady, 2017). In addition, 
literature on the trafficking of adults iden-
tify several risk factors that are more 
unique to adult victim populations, includ-
ing needing to financially support depend-
ents, low educational attainment, and hav-
ing few job skills (Holger-Ambrose et al., 
2013). Despite differences in adult and under-
age victim populations, much of the extant 
research on recruitment for sex trafficking 
have pooled both underage and adult partici-
pants or examined victimized adults only, 
limiting our understanding of the STM spe-
cifically (Reid, 2014). In order to translate 
sex trafficking research into evidence-based 
initiatives to combat the STM, it is impor-
tant for research to delineate the specific 
ways in which traffickers target and recruit 
youth into the sex trade. The current study 
aims to synthesize research that focuses on 
youth recruitment into sex trafficking in 
North America. 
NORTH AMERICAN CONTEXT OF SEX TRAFFICKING 
There have been few attempts to estimate 
the prevalence of the STM in North America; 
however, 
available 
statistics 
are 
often 
‘‘guesstimates’’ rather than reliable rates 
(Franchino-Olsen et al., 2020; Stransky & 
Finkelhor, 2012). Available estimates for 
STM most commonly come from the United 
States, where the rates range from 1,400 to 
upward 
of 
199,000 
victims 
(Banks 
& 
Kyckelhahn, 2011; Estes & Weiner, 2001; Sny-
der & Sickmund, 2006; U.S. Department of 
Justice, 2004), with the most commonly cited 
study estimating upward of 325,000 children 
at risk for sexual exploitation in the United 
States each year (Estes & Weiner, 2001). How-
ever, available statistics are problematic as 
they often fail to distinguish between domes-
tic and international victims, are based on 
varying definitions of sex trafficking, are 
geographically 
limited, 
and 
utilize 
nonreplicable, 
unreliable 
methodologies 
(Fedina et al., 2019; Franchino-Olsen et al., 
2020; Stransky & Finkelhor, 2012). Researcher 
error aside, the very nature of the sex traf-
ficking industry presents barriers to the ac-
quisition of accurate statistics. Most signifi-
cant among these is the fact that trafficking 
occurs largely underground, within criminal 
networks that are transient, discrete, and 
often invisible, even to law enforcement 
(Duger, 2015; Franchino-Olsen et al., 2020). 
Difficulty in obtaining estimates of an invis-
ible crime is compounded by the fact that 
many individuals victimized by sex traf-
ficking do not view themselves as victims of 
a crime and therefore do not report it in any 
official capacity (Mcclain & Garrity, 2011). 
Despite flawed and unreliable statistics, 
STM is known to be widespread across Can-
ada and the United States, requiring imme-
diate action and sound research to uncover 
trends and pathways of youth into sex traf-
ficking including the way traffickers target, 
recruit, and enmesh youth in the sex trade 
(Clawson et al., 2009; Cole & Sprang, 2015; 
Dalley, 2010). 
While STM defies geographic borders, a 
country’s economic environment, geographic 
positioning, laws, employment rates, per 
capita income, and historical events shape 
the industry and individual risk for recruit-
ment (Hepburn & Simon, 2010; C. O’Brien, 
2009). As a result, trends in STM within 
North America are different from the Euro-
pean context. The permeable borders be-
tween European countries allow for easy 
international movement between proximal 
countries (Lindstrom, 2004). For example, 
one report found only 5% of all identified 
sex-trafficked victims in the United King-
dom (UK) were originally from the UK, 
which is a stark contrast to the picture of 
trafficking in NA where the majority of vic-
tims are domestic persons (Baird, McDonald 
& Connolly, 2020; Banks & Kyckelhahn, 2011; 
Mitchell et al., 2010; Royal Canadian Mount-
ed Police [RCMP], Human Trafficking Na-
tional Coordination Centre, 2014; Serious 
Organised Crime Agency, 2013). Given sex 
trafficking industries vary between coun-
tries based on differences in social, geo-
graphical, cultural, economic, and historical 
factors, it is not appropriate to generalize 
understandings of STM across countries that 
are dissimilar across these factors (Hepburn 
& Simon, 2010). As such, the current study 
narrowed its focus to systematically review-
ing the recruitment of minors for sex traf-
ficking in two countries, Canada and the

United States both of which have similar 
cultural, economic, geographic, and histor-
ical contexts. 
The domestic STM is of major concern 
within Canada and the United States (Claw-
son et al., 2009; Dalley, 2010). While both 
countries adhere to the standards of affluent 
and profitable nations that are alluring des-
tinations for international sex traffickers, 
research consistently shows that domestic 
youth (i.e., youth trafficked within their 
country of origin) comprise the majority of 
underage victims in their respective coun-
tries (Baird et al., 2020; Kotrla, 2010; RCMP, 
Human Trafficking National Coordination 
Centre, 2014). Due to the risks and challenges 
associated with transporting victims across 
borders, some research suggests that domes-
tic youths are preferred by traffickers 
(Smith et al., 2009). In summarizing the lit-
erature on recruitment and entrapment, it is 
important to distinguish between inter-
national and domestic sex trafficking due to 
the nuanced differences in the process of ex-
ploitation. Comparatively, researchers sug-
gest domestic sex traffickers more often uti-
lize interpersonal relationships and domestic 
violence to entrap their target and inter-
national traffickers rely upon kidnapping, 
parents’ selling their children, and offering 
false promises of jobs abroad for entrapment 
(Cecchet & Thoburn, 2014). Understanding 
the specific ways American and Canadian 
youths are recruited by traffickers and ex-
ploited domestically is important in devel-
oping effective prevention and intervention 
strategies. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
then let me offer this point of impor-
tance. The victims are not here on this 
floor, but we must carry their story to 
this floor, to ensure that we do not see 
another victim. 
So I will offer these words from 
Courtney. Courtney has made it her 
mission to tell her story and speak out 
to spread awareness of human traf-
ficking and help shape policy to pro-
tect other young people from falling 
victim to the schemes of human traf-
fickers and to hold traffickers account-
able. 
She became entangled in sex traf-
ficking while still in school. Despite 
what some believe about victims of 
human trafficking, she grew up in a 
loving, church-going family, in a safe 
neighborhood, and attended an upscale 
suburban high school in Texas. 
At the age of 17, she was under the 
control of her first trafficker. She was 
being advertised for illicit sex on 
websites like Backpage. A trafficker 
with ties to her high school used fellow 
students to prey upon her and use her 
vulnerabilities to their advantage, of-
fering her friendship and support when 
she felt she had none, meanwhile draw-
ing her gradually and deeper into the 
life. She was actually groomed by two 
different organized crime networks si-
multaneously, and each groomer chat-
ted with her through social media and 
messaging. One network even invested 
in grooming Courtney for almost an 
entire year. 
Her first trafficker picked her up 
from school. She was unenrolled from 
her school and had her entire life up-
rooted in a desperate attempt to inter-
vene in an exploitation. 
She returned back to her hometown 
where days after turning 18, she was 
taken from her home by another in-
vested trafficker. She soon realized she 
was in this world, and over and over 
again she was used and transported 
from Texas to California to Las Vegas, 
passing from one hand to the next. 
What a vile life. She is willing to 
share this life. 
It is extremely important that we 
pass this legislation and that we ad-
dress the question of what can happen 
to our innocent children. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
closing. 
I would just once again like to em-
phasize the idea that although human 
trafficking is at the forefront of what 
we are discussing here today, we must 
continue to focus on the southern bor-
der and making sure that we secure 
that soon. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for closing. 
Let me express my appreciation to 
those who sacrificed to share with us 
their stories and those who worked on 
this very important effort: Bishop 
James Dixon, II, the No Trafficking 
Zone cofounder and senior pastor of the 
Community of Faith Church, Branch 
President of the NAACP, Houston 
Branch; Jacquelyn Aluotto, NTZ co-
founder, founder of Real Beauty Real 
Women; and Courtney Litvak, a mem-
ber of the U.S. Advisory Council on 
Human Trafficking, who will partici-
pate in unveiling their annual report 
later this week; and so many others 
who have really helped. Jacquelyn 
Aluotto was someone who inspiration-
ally wanted to lead us in this direction 
and worked very hard. 
Each of us has a duty to protect 
young people, whether it be from 
drugs, gun violence, or sex traffickers. 
Our children deserve to be safe, and 
parents should know their children will 
be safe when they put them on the 
school bus or move them into their new 
dorms. 
To be sure, H.R. 7566, the No Traf-
ficking Zones Act, provides increased 
accountability for anyone who would 
dare interrupt or interfere with a 
young person’s ability to obtain an 
education and lay the foundation for a 
productive future for the purpose of 
sexual exploitation. 
In drafting this legislation, I am 
grateful for the contribution of the No 
Trafficking Zone Initiative and all of 
those whose names I have called, in-
cluding those names not called, those 
victims silenced, or lives lost or de-
stroyed. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support H.R. 7566. This is a great day 
for helping to stop sex trafficking, 
human trafficking, where our children 
should be most safe, and that is at our 
schools. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7566, the bipartisan ‘‘No 
Trafficking Zones Act,’’ would ensure that 
schools across the country, including institu-
tions of higher education, are safe spaces for 
learning and academic exploration—free from 
the menace of sex trafficking. 
H.R. 7566 would establish a sentencing en-
hancement of up to five years in several in-
stances: 
First, in the case of any person who com-
mits the offense of sex trafficking within a pri-
mary or secondary school zone, or on, or with-
in 1,000 feet of the premises of a school-spon-
sored activity or premises owned by an institu-
tion of higher education; 
Second, for any person who commits the of-
fense of coercion and enticement of a minor 
enrolled in a primary or secondary school or a 
person enrolled in an institution of higher edu-
cation—to travel in interstate or foreign com-
merce and engage in criminal sexual activity— 
while the minor is in a school zone, or on, or 
within 1,000 feet of, premises where a school- 
sponsored activity is taking place or while the 
person is on, or within 1,000 feet of, premises 
owned by the institution of higher education; 
And, third, for any person who commits the 
offense of coercion and enticement of a minor 
using the mail or facilities of interstate or for-
eign commerce—such as text and instant 
messaging or social media platforms—while 
the minor who is enrolled in school or an insti-
tution of higher education, is in a school zone, 
or on, or within 1,000 feet of, premises where 
a school-sponsored activity is taking place or 
premises owned by an the institution of higher 
education. 
Human trafficking is one of the greatest 
threats to human rights in the United States. 
In 2020, 11,193 instances of potential human 
trafficking were reported to the United States 
National Human Trafficking Hotline with at 
least 70 percent of those instances involving 
sex trafficking, while an estimated 25 percent 
of all human trafficking victims in the country 
are in my home state of Texas at any given 
time—many of whom are minors. That is why 
the Stop Human Trafficking in School Zones 
Act that we are debating is so important to 
pass. 
At least 5,359 of trafficking victims and sur-
vivors identified through the hotline in 2019 
were under the age of 18, and in 2021, the 
National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children received more than 17,200 reports of 
suspected child sex trafficking. 
Many of these young victims of sex traf-
ficking are students in school systems, col-
leges, trade schools, and universities across 
the country. 
A 2018 survey reported that in Texas— 
where No Trafficking Zone legislation passed 
with bipartisan support earlier this year—55 
percent of young sex trafficking survivors were 
trafficked while at school or school activities 
and 60 percent of trafficked adults said they 
were first groomed and solicited for trafficking 
while on school campuses. 
Members of this body know all too well that 
children are sexually exploited in many ways. 
Some young people are trafficked by their 
schoolmates or people they once considered 
friends. 
And while traffickers seek out young people 
who have noticeable vulnerabilities—including 
problems at school, conflicts at home, or even 
the need to fill in a tuition gap caused by the 
loss of a scholarship—no child or young per-
son is truly safe from the schemes of char-
ismatic traffickers bent on exploiting and de-
stroying young lives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7922 
September 19, 2022 
With the proliferation of social media and 
the myriad ways in which we communicate 
with one another, traffickers have put these 
same means of communication to their own 
use—to find, target, lure, groom, victimize, and 
exert control over their victims. While buyers 
are using technology to find and purchase sex 
anonymously. 
Traffickers have infiltrated every known form 
of communication—especially the sites, mes-
saging apps, and social media platforms our 
children use most frequently—leaving young 
people more vulnerable to manipulation. 
Access to the internet, cell phones, and 
smartphones makes it easier for traffickers 
and buyers to communicate with children and 
youth—even when they are at school, in class, 
or attending school-sponsored activities. 
As a result, trafficking has reached the halls, 
lunchrooms, gyms, dormitories, and class-
rooms of schools, colleges, and universities in 
every corner of this nation. 
These staggering facts and statistics led me 
to introduce this bipartisan legislation, the No 
Trafficking Zones Act, known as the Stop 
Human Trafficking in School Zones Act, along 
with Chairman NADLER and Representative 
MCCAUL, who I wish to thank for working with 
me, as well as Representative JOHNSON of 
Louisiana for his amendment, that included 
the protections for young people at institutions 
of higher education. 
Each of us has a duty to protect young peo-
ple—whether it be from drugs, gun violence, 
or sex traffickers. Our children deserve to be 
safe; and parents should know their children 
will be safe when they put them on the school 
bus or move them into their new dorms. 
To be sure, H.R. 7566, the No Trafficking 
Zones Act, provides increased accountability 
for anyone who would dare interrupt or inter-
fere with a young person’s ability to obtain an 
education and lay the foundation for a produc-
tive future—for the purpose of sexual exploi-
tation. 
In drafting this legislation, I am grateful for 
the contributions of the No Trafficking Zone 
Initiative, Bishop James Dixon, Jacquelyn 
Aluotto, and Courtney Litvak, who is also a 
member of the U.S. Advisory Council on 
Human Trafficking and will participate in un-
veiling their Annual Report later this week. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7566, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING 
PREVENTION ACT OF 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7181) to amend the Traf-
ficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 
to direct the Secretary of Transpor-
tation to seek to provide for the post-
ing of contact information of the na-
tional human trafficking hotline in the 
restrooms of each aircraft, airport, 
over-the-road bus, bus station, pas-
senger train, and passenger railroad 
station operating within the United 
States, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7181 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Human Traf-
ficking Prevention Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. POSTING OF NATIONAL HUMAN TRAF-
FICKING PHONE NUMBER IN CER-
TAIN RESTROOMS. 
Section 107(b)(1)(B)(ii) of the Trafficking Vic-
tims Protection Act of 2000 (enacted as division 
A of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence 
Protection 
Act 
of 
2000 
(22 
U.S.C. 
7105(b)(1)(B)(ii))) is amended by— 
(1) striking the third sentence; and 
(2) inserting after the period at the end the 
following: ‘‘The contact information of the na-
tional human trafficking hotline (including op-
tions to reach out to the hotline such as through 
phone, text, or TTY) shall be posted as follows: 
‘‘(I) In a visible place in all Federal buildings. 
‘‘(II) The Secretary of Transportation, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, shall seek to coordinate with 
the owners and operators of aircraft, airports, 
over-the road buses, bus stations, passenger 
trains, and passenger railroad stations to place 
the contact information of the national human 
trafficking hotline in the restrooms of each such 
aircraft, airport, over the-road bus, bus station, 
passenger train, and passenger railroad station 
operating within the United States. 
‘‘(III) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services and in coordination with the 
heads of such other Federal agencies as may be 
appropriate, shall place the contact information 
of the national human trafficking hotline at 
each port of entry.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 7181. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7181, the Human 
Trafficking Prevention Act of 2022, 
would provide for the posting of the 
contact information for the National 
Human Trafficking Hotline in the rest-
rooms of our country’s transportation 
centers, where we know many traf-
ficking victims pass through, as well as 
all Federal buildings and ports of entry 
to inform victims and those who wit-
ness suspected trafficking situations 
that help is available. 
As I have said many times before, 
smuggling people across international 
borders is an equally troubling crime 
but distinct from human trafficking. 
Smugglers must be prosecuted, and the 
exploitation of their victims must not 
go unpunished. While many believe 
human trafficking happens only in 
other countries, the victimization of 
adults, youth, and children for the pur-
poses of performing labor, commercial 
sex acts, and other services happens on 
an enormous scale in rural, urban, and 
suburban 
communities 
across 
the 
United States. We can document that 
by many organizations that are fight-
ing the scourge of human trafficking. 
H.R. 7181 would require the posting of 
the National Human Trafficking Hot-
line contact information in all Federal 
buildings; require the Department of 
Transportation and the Department of 
Health and Human Services to coordi-
nate with owners and operators of 
transportation hubs such as airports, 
bus stations, and train stations to post 
the contact information for the hotline 
in their restrooms; and, three, require 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services and other appropriate Federal 
agencies to post the hotline’s contact 
information at every port of entry. 
In 2020, more than 11,193 instances of 
potential human trafficking were re-
ported to the United States National 
Human Trafficking Hotline. 
b 1645 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. In Texas, there 
are reportedly 313,000 victims of human 
trafficking at any given time, includ-
ing 79,000 children and youth who are 
victims of sex trafficking and 234,000 
adults who are victims of labor traf-
ficking. The victims of human traf-
ficking tend to be concealed, living in 
fear and isolated, in some cases phys-
ically and in other cases emotionally. 
They might remain under the control 
of their traffickers for a variety of rea-
sons, including a lack of the basic ne-
cessities to escape, like transportation 
or a safe place to go. Some may be 
afraid for their safety, while others 
may not recognize that they are under 
the control of their trafficker. Even 
after they are rescued or escape, there 
is always a possibility the victims will 
be revictimized. 
The 
National 
Human 
Trafficking 
Hotline is an essential component of 
the fight to end human trafficking, of-
fering toll-free phone lines and SMS 
text lines that are available 24 hours a 
day, every day of the year. The hotline 
provides help, safety, and hope to vic-
tims and survivors by connecting them 
to the support and services they need. 
They must know that they are not 
alone. That is the most important mes-
sage that we want to give on the floor 
of the House today. The victims of sex 
trafficking and human trafficking, the 
children and the adult victims, are not 
alone. 
Victims in crisis can receive assist-
ance with safety planning, emotional 
support, and/or immediate connections

to emergency services, while survivors 
can get help in rebuilding their lives. 
Mr. Speaker, that is an important as-
pect of this legislation we are putting 
forward today. 
The hotline also plays a vital role in 
combating human trafficking by help-
ing law enforcement identify and res-
cue victims by receiving tips about a 
potential situation of human traf-
ficking and by providing reports of tips 
to the appropriate authorities. 
We must make every effort to iden-
tify victims and ensure victims and 
survivors of human trafficking are con-
nected to services that can lead them 
to safety and help them begin to re-
store their lives. That begins with 
reaching them where they are and let-
ting them know who they can call on 
for help without risking their safety. 
Traffickers rely on our Nation’s 
transportation infrastructure to trans-
port their victims from city to city and 
State to State. In the brief moments 
victims are allowed by their traffickers 
to have a moment alone in the rest-
room of a bus station or airport, they 
may be able to call or even text for 
help. Victims, survivors, and concerned 
citizens need to know that help is just 
a phone call away because one call can 
mean the difference between life and 
death. 
Despite the clandestine nature of 
human trafficking, we have learned 
from survivors that opportunities do 
exist to reach victims, and we should 
make the most of them. H.R. 7181, the 
Human Trafficking Prevention Act of 
2022, does exactly that. 
I am very grateful to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
BASS), the gentleman from California 
(Mr. ISSA), and the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE) for intro-
ducing this strategic and practical 
measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bipartisan 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is a 
terrible and tragic evil. We should do 
all we can in Congress to fight traf-
ficking and help victims. 
This legislation would change the 
law to direct the Secretary of Trans-
portation to post the contact informa-
tion of the National Human Traf-
ficking Hotline in locations where vic-
tims may be able to see them and seek 
help. 
Because this horrific crime often in-
volves border crossings, Republicans 
added an amendment in committee di-
recting the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity to post the contact information 
of the National Human Trafficking 
Hotline at ports of entry. 
It is well documented that human 
traffickers often use the transportation 
industry for both recruiting and oper-
ations. In 2020, the latest year for 
which data is available, 10,583 incidents 
of human trafficking were reported to 
the U.S. National Human Trafficking 
Hotline, and 16,658 victims of traf-
ficking were identified. 
We hope this legislation will help to 
raise awareness about human traf-
ficking and assist victims in seeking 
help by posting hotline information in 
places where they may see it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, be-
fore I yield to the gentleman for his 
closing, I include in the RECORD the

KATY
SEX-TRAFFICKING
SURVIVOR
TEAMS 
WITH
WHITE
HOUSE
TO
FIGHT
GROWING 
THREAT 
(By Natalie Cook Clark) 
21-year-old Courtney Litvak of Katy hopes 
her experience as a sex-trafficking victim 
can 
help 
other 
young 
people. 
As 
the 
Childproof America Ambassador, she has 
taken her fight against human trafficking to 
the White House. 
After a year of ‘‘grooming’’ from various 
people, Courtney Litvak, a Cinco Ranch High 
School student, left her Katy home. At 18- 
years-old, she started a life in human traf-
ficking that lasted two years. Now, saved 
and back home, Courtney works to raise 
awareness and end this epidemic affecting 
students around the country, and right here 
in Katy. 
CINCO RANCH STUDENT SURVIVED SEX- 
TRAFFICKING 
Courtney Litvak, now 21, grew up in Katy 
in a loving home. She went to church every 
Sunday and competed on a local swim team. 
But at 18, she willingly left her home to 
enter a life in human-trafficking. 
‘‘I was groomed by multiple people over 
the period of a year,’’ says Courtney. ‘‘This 
is such a subtle process that it’s easy not to 
notice.’’ She pointed out that social media is 
often a major form of communication and 
makes such crimes difficult to track. 
VICTIMS LOSE ALL CONTROL 
‘‘They (victims) don’t understand what 
will be their reality when they lose control,’’ 
explains Courtney. She felt she was targeted 
when she was vulnerable after experiencing a 
traumatic event. 
‘‘I was assaulted and I became a changed 
person,’’ says Courtney. ‘‘You should not go 
through a loss and then become a target.’’ 
CHILDPROOF AMERICA SUPPORTS FAMILIES, 
EDUCATES COMMUNITIES 
In 2017, Courtney’s mother, Kelly Litvak 
founded Childproof America, a non-profit or-
ganization aimed at educating families and 
communities about the warning signs that 
can ultimately save children from becoming 
victims of this growing trend in our country. 
‘‘It’s key for people to understand this 
issue,’’ says Kelly. ‘‘Every household in Katy 
needs to be informed about human traf-
ficking. Denial is a coping mechanism and 
it’s difficult for parents to comprehend. 
Child and sex should never go into the same 
sentence. It’s because of this mindset that 
this is a threat to Katy. These people are 
counting on families to be naive and it 
makes us sitting ducks.’’ 
INFORMAL INTERVENTIONS 
In addition to her duties as spokesperson, 
Courtney meets informally with teens and 
young adults going through the grooming 
process or trafficking. 
‘‘A parent will reach out to Childproof 
America and we talk for about an hour on 
what 
they 
have 
found 
and 
are 
going 
through,’’ explains Kelly. ‘‘Then Courtney is 
filled in and if the youth is willing, she will 
sit down with them and can help in key ac-
tivities.’’ 
These meetings are very effective. Since 
becoming the Childproof America spokes-
person this past August Courtney has spoken 
to about 10 students, 3 of whom were boys. 
Currently, Courtney and Kelly say that these 
sessions are seen as being 100 percent suc-
cessful in getting these young people out of 
a harmful and dangerous situation. However, 
they stress that these cases will be followed 
up on. 
‘‘You can’t help someone who doesn’t want 
to be helped,’’ says Courtney. 
KATY-BASED CHILDPROOF AMERICA AVERAGES 2– 
3 CALLS A WEEK 
Since Childproof America is Katy-based 
and many in Katy know the Litvak’s story 
about 80 percent of their calls come from 
Katy residents. They average 2–3 calls a 
week but it comes in waves. Recently 
Childproof America worked with the Chil-
dren’s 
Assessment 
Center 
to 
host 
a 
Childproof America emergency safety sem-
inar when calls reached a sudden increase. 
‘‘We started receiving so many calls that 
we felt something was going on,’’ says Kelly. 
THIS IS NOT THE STUDENT’S FAULT 
‘‘I wish someone would have looked at me 
and said I get it,’’ says Courtney. ‘‘I wanted 
to be validated and heard, just listened to. 
We need to do better at recognizing these 
groups and knowing this doesn’t happen over 
night and this is not the person’s fault.’’ 
When Courtney was trafficked, the city of 
Katy and Houston community accepted that 
she chose this.‘‘That is not true,’’ says 
Courtney. 
MASTER MANIPULATORS 
Courtney describes the people involved 
with human trafficking as master manipula-
tors. 
‘‘Everything is in their control,’’ explains 
Courtney. ‘‘All of your decisions are theirs. 
You’re a commodity, a property.’’ 
According to the University of Texas, more 
than 79,000 children are being trafficked for 
sex in Texas alone. 
‘‘I’ve never seen so much coverage espe-
cially on social media,’’ says Courtney. ‘‘It’s 
really a combination of more awareness 
being brought to it and such organizations 
are growing. It (human trafficking) is con-
tinuing to get more sophisticated and grow-
ing.’’ 
INTEREST FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 
A major initiative launched by Childproof 
America is the education and outreach ini-
tiatives, specifically Family Guides, which is 
exclusive to their group. Family Guides is 
inspired by parents of victims and is de-
signed to meet the need of families in crisis. 
During a time of stress and fear, families 
need a trained advocate who knows how to 
navigate the issue quickly to help. Families 
with minor children and 18+ are matched 
with a compassionate advocate who can as-
sist with critical questions in a quick and ef-
fective fashion. It’s this program that has 
really piqued the interest of officials in our 
nation’s capital.

SUCCESS IN D.C. 
Just before Thanksgiving, Courtney and 
her mother were invited to meet with lvanka 
Trump, advisor to the President. In that 
meeting, they discussed how the current ad-
ministration could help fight against human 
trafficking. 
‘‘Ivanka was amazing and a champion for 
this cause,’’ says Kelly. ‘‘We were prepared 
to present our mission in a short time.’’ 
The Litvaks say that lvanka was inter-
ested and has followed up since their initial 
meeting. 
‘‘We’re going back to D.C. in January,’’ 
says Kelly. ‘‘We developed a true trust and 
lvanka’s administration has asked up for our 
opinions on top leaders on this topic.’’ 
PUTTING EVERYTHING INTO PERSPECTIVE 
‘‘What we’re doing really didn’t sink in 
until I was there (meeting Ivanka),’’ says 
Courtney. ‘‘It was really emotional, which is 
hard for me to be vulnerable. Our trip to D.C. 
put 
everything 
into 
perspective. 
I’m 
repurposing the pain and it’s the beginning 
of something great.’’ 
‘‘There are so many areas where people are 
suffering,’’ says Courtney. ‘‘No matter where 
the suffering is, I hope to help and use my 
platform to establish relationships with 
leaders to get the ball rolling.’’ 
PASSION FOR OTHER AREAS 
Courtney is passionate with other areas of 
service that she hopes one day to be able to 
work with her connections to make a dif-
ference. 
‘‘I’d love to help the homeless,’’ says 
Courtney. ‘‘Growing up in Katy I could never 
wrap my head around it. I’ve seen the gap 
and want to help.’’ 
LOCAL SCHOOLS NEED TO OPEN DOORS TO 
EXPERT TRAINING 
Childproof America is working with local 
schools and groups to help spread their edu-
cation initiative and educate people on this 
difficult subject. 
‘‘We have been talking to Fort Bend ISD 
and now they are organizing a massive train-
ing for everyone from students, parents, and 
teachers,’’ says Kelly. ‘‘Every school district 
needs to swing open their doors to experts to 
train people on this subject. Schools need to 
get over the mindset that if they have train-
ing, people will think that they are having a 
problem. We need to empower the commu-
nity.’’ 
FAITH BROUGHT HER BACK 
Courtney credits her faith in God for giv-
ing her the strength to stop putting harmful 
substances in her body and to breakthrough 
the brain washing to get help and leave that 
lifestyle. 
‘‘I’m not the first person this has happened 
to and I won’t be the last,’’ says Courtney. ‘‘I 
always want to continue to be very raw and 
very genuine on this subject. I’m not putting 
a time stamp on my service. I will always 
put my full heart into it but what that will 
look like I don’t know.’’ 
HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS IN KATY AND DOESN’T 
DISCRIMINATE 
It is important to note that human traf-
ficking doesn’t discriminate. It can happen 
to anyone, and according to Childproof 
America, this activity is happening in Katy 
and Katy schools, like it’s happening all 
over. 
‘‘I always want to acknowledge that every-
one who’s been through this does not need to 
talk or help others,’’ says Courtney. ‘‘It is 
extremely difficult and it’s a lifelong recov-
ery.’’

4-VEAR-OLD AMONG 31 HUMAN TRAFFICKING 
VICTIMS RESCUED IN KANSAS, MISSOURI 
(By Matthew Impelli) 
A 4-year-old child was among a group of 31 
human trafficking victims recently rescued 
by authorities in Kansas and Missouri. 
The victims rescued were sexually ex-
ploited, according to the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security. The 4-year-old was the 
youngest victim rescued in the group of 31 
human trafficking victims, which included 14 
missing children and 17 adults. 
The Department of Homeland Security 
said in a statement that, ‘‘The operation 
took place June 17–26, 2021 in Wichita, Kan-
sas, Independence, Missouri and Kansas City, 
Missouri.’’ 
‘‘The results of the operation were an-
nounced by Homeland Security Investiga-
tions Deputy Special Agent in Charge, Kan-
sas City, James Wright,’’ the statement 
read. ‘‘He was joined by Heartland Anti-Traf-
ficking Rescue Taskforce partners from 
across the region in making the announce-
ment.’’ 
Along with rescuing the 31 human traf-
ficking victims, the operation also resulted 
in the arrest of 82 individuals. The individ-
uals ‘‘will be charged with crimes related to 
soliciting prostitution, commercial sex traf-
ficking, sodomy, narcotics violations, felony 
assault on a police officer, sex offender reg-
istry violations and outstanding warrants,’’ 
according to the Homeland Security state-
ment. 
Homeland Security investigators received 
assistance during the operation from the 
Wichita Police Department; the Kansas Bu-
reau of Investigation; Kansas Highway Pa-
trol; the Department of Health and Human 
Services; the United States Marshal’s Serv-
ice; the Platte County Sheriff’s Office; the 
Independence Police Department; the Jack-
son County Sheriffs Department; Missouri 
State Highway Patrol; the Bourbon County 
Sheriff’s Office and the Hutchinson Police 
Department. 
The Department of Homeland Security did 
not identify any of the victims rescued or 
those arrested and noted that ‘‘the defend-
ants in this case are presumed innocent and 
entitled to a fair trial where the government 
has the burden of proving guilt beyond a rea-
sonable doubt.’’ 
Homeland 
Security 
investigators 
com-
pleted a similar operation on Thursday in 
Fresno County, California. Operation Stolen 
Hearts focused on arresting human traf-
fickers and child predators seeking to pay 
for sex with minors. The operation ended on 
June 23 and resulted in the rescue of 10 
women and girls ‘‘from the sex trade,’’ as 
well as the arrest of 21 individuals, according 
to Homeland Security. 
The arrested individuals were charged with 
‘‘contacting a minor with intent to commit 
a sexual offense, aiding prostitution, arrang-
ing a meeting with a minor for lewd purposes 
and solicitation of acts of prostitution.’’ 
Newsweek reached out to the Department 
of Homeland Security for further comment 
but did not receive a response in time for 
publication.

TEXAS AUTHORITIES RESCUE 70 MISSING 
CHILDREN VICTIMIZED BY SEX TRAFFICKING 
THE CHILDREN RANGED IN AGES FROM 10 TO 17 
(By Andrew Mark Miller) 
Law enforcement officials have success-
fully recovered dozens of missing children as 
part of a joint task force operation in West 
Texas. The three-week operation, known as 
‘‘Operation Lost Souls,’’ started in late April 
in the Texas counties of El Paso, Midland, 
Ector and Tom Green and recovered 70 chil-
dren ranging in age from 10 to 17 who were 
victims of sex trafficking, physical and sex-
ual abuse, according to a press release from 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
‘‘Operation Lost Souls exemplifies Home-
land Security Investigations’ commitment 
to protecting the public from crimes of vic-
timization. In this case, we are looking out 
for our children—our community’s most pre-
cious resource,’’ said HSI El Paso Deputy 
Special Agent in Charge Taekuk Cho. 
‘‘HSI is committed to continue working 
with our law enforcement partners to locate, 
recover and help missing children heal, while 
ensuring that perpetrators are held respon-
sible for these heinous crimes and brought to 
justice.’’ 
The operation was conducted by several 
law enforcement agencies, including the 
Texas Highway Patrol, El Paso Police De-
partment, U.S. Marshals Service and the 
FBI. 
‘‘At the Department of Public Safety, 
teamwork is one of our core values,’’ said 
DPS Major Matthew Mull. ‘‘We are grateful 
for all of our law enforcement partners who 
participated in this operation and who work 
around the clock every day to protect our 
communities, including our youth.’’ 
HSI added that several agencies have pro-
vided counseling to the children. 
Authorities say that the children who were 
located outside of West Texas were found in 
Dallas, Texas; Colorado; and Ciudad Juarez, 
Mexico. 
Federal law enforcement teams have suc-
cessfully rescued missing children in oper-
ations across the country over the last few 
years, including in January 2021, when the 
FBI announced it located 33 children in the 
Los Angeles area. 
U.S. marshals in Ohio rescued 45 missing 
children and 109 additional human traf-
ficking survivors during ‘‘Operation Autumn 
Hope’’ in October 2020.

REPORT: HUMAN TRAFFICKING SPIKES IN 
TEXAS AMID PANDEMIC 
(By Olivia P. Tallet, Staff writer) 
Texas, already the home to the second 
highest number of sex trafficking cases, is 
seeing a steep increase in crisis calls related 
to the illegal activity because of the 
coronavirus pandemic. What’s more, traf-
ficking activities are exploding online, as 
criminals adapt to the changing environ-
ment, experts said. 
The Lone Star State is only second to Cali-
fornia with 2,455 victims and survivors iden-
tified in Texas from over 2,000 calls to the 
hotline, which now includes texts and other 
means for victims to communicate, accord-
ing to a report released last week by the Po-
laris Project. The calls led to the identifica-
tion of 515 traffickers and 240 businesses in-
volved in this illegal trade. 
An analysis by Polaris comparing the hot-
line activity in three periods this year to 
2019 indicates that crisis has worsened by 
about 40 percent, and that the pandemic has 
impacted the victims’ vulnerabilities, as well 
as the manner of sex trafficking operations 
nationwide. 
The number of cases identified through the 
hotline is only a fraction of the prevalence of 
human trafficking, which is defined as an in-
dividual being deceived or coerced into pros-
titution, forced labor, or domestic servitude. 
‘‘Calls have more to do with people on the 
ground knowing about the hotline as a re-
source,’’ said Ayan Ahmed, a Polaris spokes-
person. ‘‘It’s more about awareness.’’ 
Because Houston is considered a hub for 
human trafficking, the issue has gained sig-
nificant awareness in the city, said Ann

Johnson, former human trafficking pros-
ecutor in Harris County. She said hotlines 
might get more calls here ‘‘because our gen-
eral population is more on alert.’’ 
Elaine Andino, a director with the non-
profit United Against Human Trafficking in 
Houston, said the prevalence of human traf-
ficking is hard to gauge because it’s mostly 
a hidden crime that flourishes in businesses 
posing as legal enterprises or exploits vic-
tims who are too vulnerable to report them. 
Andino said the most reliable study avail-
able in Texas about this illegal trade was 
published by the University of Texas at Aus-
tin in 2016, which estimated that there are 
310,000 victims of human trafficking at any 
given moment in the state. Most are victims 
of labor trafficking, 234,500, while 79,000 are 
minors and youth in sex trafficking. 
Victims have been driven further under-
ground and have become more vulnerable as 
the pandemic forced the closure of busi-
nesses, saw many employees let go, and 
prompted an economic crisis, Andino said. 
Many agencies providing services to vic-
tims were also impacted and unable to re-
ceive new clients, according to the Polaris 
report, titled ‘‘Crisis in Human Trafficking 
During the Pandemic.’’ 
‘‘There are roughly about 500 beds in the 
entire country for trafficking victims,’’ 
Andino said. ‘‘A lot of these shelters are re-
stricting how many people come into the 
shelters to prevent COVID from spreading.’’ 
While the pandemic closed businesses in 
industries where human trafficking thrives, 
such as hospitality, restaurants and bars, the 
criminal enterprise adapted by moving heav-
ily online. 
‘‘A lot of victimization has just moved on-
line,’’ said Andino. ‘‘There are lots and lots 
of trafficking victims who are forced to have 
sex on camera now; we saw a lot of that real-
ly, really spike during COVID.’’ Several re-
ports point to a significant increase in porn 
consumption during the pandemic, with mo-
dalities such as cam sex and 3D services 
gaining traction. 
With social distancing, many men have 
avoided paying for in person sex, but those 
who continue tend to be the most reckless 
and violent, ‘‘so it became even more of a 
scary situation for trafficking victims’’ vul-
nerability to abuse, Andino added. 
The pandemics effect has increased the 
very vulnerabilities that put victims in the 
hands of traffickers in the first place, said 
former prosecutor Johnson. For example, 
some minors who are trying to escape abu-
sive parenting get sucked into trafficking. 
Also, immigrants are more likely to get co-
erced by employers to work in dire condi-
tions for little or no pay. 
‘‘Every victim I’ve seen, whether it’s age, 
race, background, the common theme, is vul-
nerability,’’ said Johnson. 
Johnson insists that tackling human traf-
ficking will require increasing services to 
victims and prosecuting exploiters, including 
sellers who profit from the business and the 
consumer who pay for the abuse. 
‘‘You need to continue the awareness con-
stantly,’’ said Johnson. ‘‘This is not like 
turning off the water faucet at once.’’

TIPS FROM COMMUNITY LED OHIO OFFICIALS 
TO
RESCUE
5 SUSPECTED
HUMAN
TRAF-
FICKING VICTIMS 
(By Lydia Taylor) 
OHIO.—Ohio officials said five suspected 
human trafficking victims were rescued this 
month after tips from community members 
led them to two southern Ohio massage par-
lors. 
The West Chester Police Department and 
the Chillicothe Police Department contacted 
Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation in 
June about tips received about an illegal 
massage parlor. After investigating further, 
the BCI found connections between two par-
lors: The Lucky Asian Bodywork, 1532 N. 
Bridge St., Chillicothe location and the 
Lucky Asian Bodywork, 1532 N. Bridge St., 
Chillicothe location, according to Ohio At-
torney General Dave Yost’s office. 
Officials executed search warrants on Dec. 
7, finding five victims who were offered med-
ical attention and access to other resources. 
Victim advocates were present during both 
searches and talked with the women. Two 
women were found at the Chillicothe loca-
tion and the other three were at the West 
Chester location. 
The BCI is still investigating. 
‘‘If you think human trafficking doesn’t 
happen where you live, you’re wrong,’’ Yost 
said. ‘‘It happens everywhere across our 
state and across every demographic. It hap-
pens because of the demand, but won’t hap-
pen in Ohio without consequences—we’re 
watching.’’ 
Ohio is among the worst states for human 
trafficking. According to data from the Ohio 
Human Trafficking Task Force, between 
2014–2020, more than 1,300 victims were iden-
tified by officials. In 2019, Ohio ranked No. 4 
for the most human trafficking victims na-
tionwide. 
If you are in need of help or know of some-
one, you can dial 911, contact your local po-
lice department or call the National Human 
Trafficking Hotline at 1–888–3737–888.

TWO SEPARATE HUMAN TRAFFICKING RESCUES 
IN TUSCALOOSA WITHIN ONE WEEK 
(By Lauren Harksen) 
TUSCALOOSA, AL (WBRC).—Two teenage 
girls are now home with their families after 
calling 911 from a Tuscaloosa hotel room. 
It’s the second human trafficking rescue in 
the city within a week. 
It’s an issue becoming all-too common in 
the Tuscaloosa area. Thankfully, the latest 
trafficking victims had a chance to call for 
help, but it doesn’t always end that way. 
‘‘It’s extremely unusual for them to call 
911 and say, ‘Hey we need help.’ ’’ said Tusca-
loosa Police Captain Phil Simpson. 
That call was from a 15-year-old and an 18- 
year-old Wednesday night. 
‘‘There came a time where they did not 
want to go any farther with what was going 
on.’’ said Captain Simpson. ‘‘Their initial re-
quest was that we help them get home.’’ 
They wanted to return home to their fami-
lies in a neighboring state. 
Captain 
Simpson 
says 
the 
two 
were 
brought to Tuscaloosa as sex trafficking vic-
tims. Unfortunately, just one week ago, a 
similar investigation happened in the area. 
‘‘We’ve seen a lot of this activity increas-
ing and we believe it’s leading up to the 
World Games in Birmingham,’’ said Captain 
Simpson. 
He is also Commander of the West Ala-
bama Human Trafficking Task Force and 
says when large-scale events like the World 
Games are right around the corner, unlawful 
acts tend to rise. 
‘‘The traffickers want that business, so 
they’re going to go where there’s a lot of 
people,’’ he added. ‘‘They’re going to take 
their victims to make them money where 
there is a lot of people.’’ 
In this day and age, Captain Simpson says 
most trafficking victims are not abducted. 
Instead, they are coerced. 
‘‘What we see is minors who are vulner-
able,’’ he said. ‘‘They become enamored with 
somebody on the internet that they think is 
innocent and then they meet that person and 
it goes from there . . . until it’s too far or 
too late for the victims to back out.’’ 
Captain Simpson says the typical gateway 
for these perpetrators is social media. He en-
courages parents to keep a close eye on who 
your children are in contact with because 
you never know who’s on the other side of 
the screen. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as 
we have heard, the idea of human traf-
ficking is not going away. This legisla-
tion, I believe, will provide us with the 
important instruction to give to those 
victims where they may find some re-
lief. 
Human trafficking is a multibillion- 
dollar criminal industry that denies 
freedom to nearly 25 million people 
around the world. It is an ever-present 
threat to the health and safety of vic-
tims, many of whom are children, but 
also poses grave danger to public 
health and safety and national secu-
rity. 
Although the statistics we recite 
daily are breathtaking, they represent 
a mere fraction of the instances of traf-
ficking that occur, as human traf-
ficking 
is 
a 
highly 
underreported 
crime. 
H.R. 7181, the Human Trafficking 
Prevention Act of 2022, would help 
identify, protect, and provide essential 
services to victims of human traf-
ficking, who are often unseen, by re-
quiring the posting of the contact in-
formation for the National Human 
Trafficking Hotline so that victims and 
anyone who sees someone who appears 
to be a victim know who to call or text 
for help. 
This is commonsense, bipartisan leg-
islation that I urge all of my col-
leagues to support, and I am seeking 
the support of my colleagues. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7181, the ‘‘Human Traf-
ficking Prevention Act of 2022,’’ would provide 
for the posting of the contact information of 
the National Human Trafficking Hotline in the 
restrooms of our country’s transportation cen-
ters—where we know many trafficking victims 
pass through—as well as all federal buildings 
and ports of entry—to inform victims and 
those who witness suspected trafficking situa-
tions that help is available. 
As I have said many times before, smug-
gling people across international borders is an 
equally troubling crime, but distinct from 
human trafficking. Smugglers must be pros-
ecuted, and the exploitation of their victims 
must not go unpunished. 
And while many believe human trafficking 
happens only in other countries, the victimiza-
tion of adults, youth, and children for the pur-
poses of performing labor, commercial sex 
acts and other services happens on an enor-
mous scale in rural, urban, and suburban 
communities across the United States. 
H.R. 7181 would: require posting of the Na-
tional Human Trafficking Hotline’s contact in-
formation in all federal buildings; require the 
Department of Transportation and the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services to coordi-
nate with owners and operators of transpor-
tation hubs, such as airports, bus stations, and 
train stations to post the contact information

for the hotline in their restrooms; and require 
the Department of Homeland Security—in con-
sultation with the Department of Health and 
Human Services and other appropriate federal 
agencies—to post the hotline’s contact infor-
mation at every port of entry. 
In 2020, more than 11,193 instances of po-
tential human trafficking were reported to the 
United States National Human Trafficking Hot-
line. 
And in Texas, there are reportedly 313,000 
victims of human trafficking at any given time, 
including 79,000 children and youth who are 
victims of sex trafficking and 234,000 adults 
who are victims of labor trafficking. 
Victims of human trafficking tend to be con-
cealed, living in fear, and isolated—in some 
cases physically and in other cases emotion-
ally. 
They might remain under the control of their 
traffickers for a variety of reasons, including a 
lack of the basic necessities to escape—like 
transportation or a safe place to go. 
Some may be afraid for their safety. While 
others may not recognize that they are under 
the control of their trafficker. 
And even after they are rescued or escape, 
there is always the possibility that victims will 
be revictimized. 
The National Human Trafficking Hotline is 
an essential component of the fight to end 
human trafficking. Offering toll-free phone lines 
and SMS text lines, that are available 24 
hours a day, every day of the year, the hotline 
provides help, safety, and hope to victims and 
survivors by connecting them to the support 
and services they need. 
Victims in crisis can receive assistance with 
safety planning, emotional support, and imme-
diate connections to emergency services while 
survivors can get help with rebuilding their 
lives. 
The hotline also plays a vital role in combat-
ting human trafficking by helping law enforce-
ment identify and rescue victims; by receiving 
tips about potential situations of human traf-
ficking; and by providing reports of tips to the 
appropriate authorities. 
We must make every effort to identify vic-
tims and ensure victims and survivors of 
human trafficking are connected to services 
that can lead them to safety and help them 
begin to restore their lives. 
That begins with reaching them where they 
are and letting them know who they can call 
for help without risking their safety. 
Traffickers rely on our nation’s transpor-
tation infrastructure to transport their victims 
from city to city and state to state. In the brief 
moments that allow victims to have a moment 
alone in the restroom of a bus station or air-
port, they may be able to call—or even text— 
for help. 
Victims, survivors, and concerned citizens 
need to know that help is just a phone call 
away because one call could mean the dif-
ference between life and death. 
Despite the clandestine nature of human 
trafficking, we have learned from survivors that 
opportunities do exist to reach victims, and we 
should make the most of them. H.R. 7181, the 
Human Trafficking Prevention Act of 2022, 
does exactly that. 
I thank Representatives JEFFRIES, BASS, 
ISSA, and MACE for introducing this strategic 
and practical measure. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting 
this bipartisan bill. 
Human trafficking is a multi-billion-dollar 
criminal industry that denies freedom to nearly 
25 million people around the world. It as an 
ever-present threat to the health and safety of 
victims, many of whom are children, but also 
poses grave danger to public health and safe-
ty and national security. 
Although the statistics we recite daily are 
breathtaking, they represent a mere fraction of 
the instances of trafficking that occur, as 
human trafficking is a highly underreported 
crime. 
H.R. 7181, the ‘‘Human Trafficking Preven-
tion Act of 2022,’’ would help identify, protect, 
and provide essential services to victims of 
human trafficking, who are often unseen, by 
requiring the posting of the contact information

that victims—and anyone who sees someone

JACKSON LEE) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7181, as

ARTISTIC RECOGNITION FOR 
TALENTED STUDENTS ACT 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 169) to amend title 17, United 
States Code, to require the Register of 
Copyrights to waive fees for filing an 
application for registration of a copy-
right claim in certain circumstances, 
and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 169 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Artistic 
Recognition for Talented Students Act’’ or 
the ‘‘ARTS Act’’. 
SEC. 2. WAIVER OF FEES FOR WINNERS OF CER-
TAIN COMPETITIONS. 
Section 708 of title 17, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(e)(1) In this subsection, the term ‘cov-
ered competition’ means— 
‘‘(A) an art competition sponsored by the 
Congressional Institute that is open only to 
high school students; or 
‘‘(B) the competition established under 
section 3 of House Resolution 77, 113th Con-
gress, agreed to February 26, 2013. 
‘‘(2) With respect to a work that wins a 
covered competition, the Register of Copy-
rights— 
‘‘(A) shall waive the requirement under 
subsection (a)(1) with respect to an applica-
tion for registration of a copyright claim for 
that work if that application is submitted to 
the Copyright Office not later than the last 
day of the calendar year following the year 
in which the work claimed by the applica-
tion wins the covered competition (referred 
to in this paragraph as the ‘covered year’); 
and 
‘‘(B) may waive a fee described in subpara-
graph (A) for an application submitted after 
the end of the covered year if the fee would 
have been waived under that subparagraph 
had the application been submitted before 
the last day of the covered year.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on S. 169. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 169, the Artistic Rec-
ognition for Talented Students Act, or 
the ARTS Act, would help introduce 
promising young students who have 
won either the Congressional Art Com-
petition or the Congressional App Chal-
lenge to the intellectual property sys-
tem by waiving the fee for these stu-
dents to apply for a copyright for their 
winning work. 
I applaud the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. JEFFRIES) for introducing 
the House version of this bipartisan, bi-
cameral legislation with the gentle-
woman 
from 
South 
Carolina 
(Ms. 
MACE), along with several of my col-
leagues on the Judiciary Committee, 
including Courts, Intellectual Prop-
erty, and the Internet Subcommittee 
Chairman JOHNSON and Ranking Mem-
ber ISSA, the gentleman from Rhode Is-
land (Mr. CICILLINE), and the gentle-
woman from Indiana (Mrs. SPARTZ). 
The bill was passed under suspension 
last year. We are pleased today to take 
up passage of the Senate version of the 
bill, championed by Senators LEAHY 
and TILLIS, so the bill will pass both 
Chambers and become law. 
We in this Chamber know just how 
important intellectual property rights 
are to our country and our economy, 
yet studies show that awareness of in-
tellectual property is lacking among 
the country’s students, even if they 
pursue fields that are IP intensive. The 
ARTS Act helps close this awareness 
gap early on and allows these students 
to participate in the intellectual prop-
erty system without a financial bur-
den. 
What it also does is help build the 
farm team for all of those who will be 
protecting intellectual property in the

future. It gives them a sense of owner-
ship, and it ties them to the Constitu-
tion because intellectual property cer-
tainly is part of their constitutional 
privilege, constitutional rights, and 
constitutional protection. 
Property rights are very important, 
and that is what intellectual property 
is. It builds on Congress’ work to en-
courage the creativity of our Nation’s 
youth with the establishment of the 
Congressional Art Competition and the 
Congressional 
App 
Challenge. 
Year 
after year, in both of these competi-
tions, the talent of students displayed 
is remarkable. I know it well in the 
candidates that I have seen and the 
choices that our arts committee in 
Houston in the 18th Congressional Dis-
trict has made. They are brilliant, and 
the apps are equally so. 
Year after year, in both of these com-
petitions, we see outstanding work. 
Through both, we continue to see our 
youth encouraged to develop their ar-
tistic and technical talents as Congress 
intended. 
The ARTS Act makes these competi-
tions even more impactful. Under the 
bill, the students may apply to register 
a copyright for their winning work or 
winning app for free. This introduces 
these students to the intellectual prop-
erty system and the benefits of copy-
right protection—again, a constitu-
tional right. 
Under current law, the Register of 
Copyrights cannot waive these fees on 
her own. The ARTS Act amends the 
Copyright Act to allow such a fee waiv-
er for these specific circumstances. 
Building the farm team, again, is so 
very important. 
Once again, I applaud the sponsors of 
the bill for bringing forward this im-
portant legislation, which will aid the 
next 
generation 
of 
creators 
and 
innovators. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support passage, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
169, the Artistic Recognition for Tal-
ented Students Act. 
The Constitution authorizes Congress 
‘‘to promote the progress of science 
and useful arts, by securing for limited 
times to authors and inventors the ex-
clusive 
right 
to 
their 
respective 
writings and discoveries.’’ 
Our copyright system is designed to 
help fulfill that mandate by promoting 
the work of authors, musicians, artists, 
and other creators. 
Creative industries contribute hun-
dreds of billions of dollars to the U.S. 
economy every year. This bill makes it 
easier for some of our brightest young 
creators to obtain copyrights on their 
award-winning work. This is essen-
tially the same as the bill that passed 
the House under suspension of the rules 
last year. 
Promoting and encouraging the next 
generation of American creators en-
sures that our creative economy will 
remain strong for decades to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
again, S. 169 is a short but important 
bill 
that 
promotes 
education 
and 
awareness of intellectual property to 
the next generation of creators. What 
an outstanding way to build the farm 
team, to create a buy-in by the young 
geniuses of our time, both in terms of 
the apps and arts and many other as-
pects. 
Again, we recognize the constitu-
tional connection to the idea of prop-
erty, copyright, intellectual property, 
and it is important for young people to 
learn early on and to be protective of 
the genius of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 169, the ‘‘Artistic Recogni-
tion for Talented Students Act’’ or the ‘‘ARTS 
Act,’’ would help introduce promising young 
students who have won either the Congres-
sional Art Competition or the Congressional 
App Challenge to the intellectual property sys-
tem by waiving the fee for those students to 
apply for a copyright registration for their win-
ning work. 
I applaud my colleague, Mr. JEFFRIES, for in-
troducing the House version of this bipartisan, 
bicameral legislation with Ms. MACE, along 
with several of my colleagues on the Judiciary 
Committee, 
including 
Intellectual 
Property 
Subcommittee Chairman JOHNSON and Rank-
ing Member ISSA, Mr. CICILLINE, and Ms. 
SPARTZ. 
This bill was passed under suspension last 
year. We are pleased today to take up pas-
sage of the Senate version of the bill, cham-
pioned by Senators LEAHY and TILLIS, so that 
the bill will pass both chambers and become 
law. 
We in this Chamber know just how impor-
tant intellectual property rights are to our 
country and our economy. Yet studies show 
that awareness of intellectual property is lack-
ing among the country’s students, even if they 
pursue fields that are IP-intensive. The ARTS 
Act helps close this awareness gap early on 
and allows these students to participate in the 
intellectual property system without a financial 
burden. 
It builds on Congress’s work to encourage 
the creativity of our nation’s youth with the es-
tablishment of the Congressional Art Competi-
tion and the Congressional App Challenge 
more. 
Year after year, in both of these competi-
tions, the talent our students display is re-
markable. Through both, we continue to see 
our youth encouraged to develop their artistic 
and technical talents, as Congress intended. 
The ARTS Act makes these competitions 
even more impactful. Under the bill, students 
may apply to register a copyright for their win-
ning artwork or winning app for free. This in-
troduces these students to the intellectual 
property system and the benefits of copyright 
protection. 
Under current law, the Register of Copy-
rights cannot waive these fees on her own. 
The ARTS Act amends the Copyright Act to 
allow such a fee waiver for these specific cir-
cumstances. 
Once again, I applaud the sponsors of the 
bill for bringing this important legislation for-
ward, which will aid the next generation of cre-
ators and innovators. 
I urge my colleagues to support its passage. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 169 is a short but important 
bill that will promote education and awareness 
of intellectual property to the next generation 
of creators. I urge my colleagues to support 
the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, S. 169. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
PROTECT REPORTERS FROM EX-
PLOITATIVE STATE SPYING ACT 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4330) to maintain the free 
flow of information to the public by es-
tablishing appropriate limits on the 
federally compelled disclosure of infor-
mation obtained as part of engaging in 
journalism, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

In any matter arising under Federal law, a 
Federal entity may not compel a covered jour-

issued determines by a preponderance of the evi-
dence, after providing notice and an oppor-
tunity to be heard to the covered journalist 
that— 
(1) disclosure of the protected information is 
necessary to prevent, or to identify any perpe-
trator of, an act of terrorism against the United 
States; or 
(2) disclosure of the protected information is 
necessary to prevent a threat of imminent vio-
lence, significant bodily harm, or death, includ-
ing specified offenses against a minor (as de-
fined by section 111(7) of the Adam Walsh Child 
Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (34 U.S.C. 
20911(7))). 
SEC. 4. LIMITS ON COMPELLED DISCLOSURE 
FROM 
COVERED 
SERVICE 
PRO-
VIDERS. 
(a) CONDITIONS
FOR
COMPELLED
DISCLO-
SURE.—In any matter arising under Federal 
law, a Federal entity may not compel a covered 
service provider to provide testimony or any doc-
ument consisting of any record, information, or 
other communications stored by a covered pro-
vider on behalf of a covered journalist, includ-
ing testimony or any document relating to a per-
sonal account of a covered journalist or a per-
sonal technology device of a covered journalist, 
unless a court in the judicial district in which 
the subpoena or other compulsory process is, or 
will be, issued determines by a preponderance of 
the evidence that there is a reasonable threat of 
imminent violence unless the testimony or docu-
ment is provided, and issues an order author-
izing the Federal entity to compel the disclosure 
of the testimony or document. 
(b) NOTICE TO COURT.—A Federal entity seek-
ing to compel the provision of testimony or any 
document described in subsection (a) shall in-
form the court that the testimony or document 
relates to a covered journalist. 
(c) NOTICE TO COVERED JOURNALIST AND OP-
PORTUNITY TO BE HEARD.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—A court may authorize a 
Federal entity to compel the provision of testi-
mony or a document under this section only 
after the Federal entity seeking the testimony or 
document provides the covered journalist on be-
half of whom the testimony or document is 
stored pursuant to subsection (a)— 
(A) notice of the subpoena or other compul-
sory request for such testimony or document 
from the covered service provider not later than 
the time at which such subpoena or request is 
issued to the covered service provider; and

the testimony or document is compelled. 
(2) EXCEPTION TO NOTICE REQUIREMENT.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Notice and an opportunity 
to be heard under paragraph (1) may be delayed 
for not more than 45 days if the court involved 
determines there is clear and convincing evi-
dence that such notice would pose a clear and 
substantial threat to the integrity of a criminal 
investigation, or would present an imminent risk 
of death or serious bodily harm, including speci-
fied offenses against a minor (as defined by sec-
tion 111(7) of the Adam Walsh Child Protection 
and Safety Act of 2006 (34 U.S.C. 20911(7))). 
(B) EXTENSIONS.—The 45-day period described 
in subparagraph (A) may be extended by the 
court for additional periods of not more than 45 
days if the court involved makes a new and 
independent determination that there is clear 
and convincing evidence that providing notice 
to the covered journalist would pose a clear and 
substantial threat to the integrity of a criminal 
investigation, or would present an imminent risk 
of death or serious bodily harm under current 
circumstances. 
SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON CONTENT OF INFORMA-
TION. 
The content of any testimony, document, or 
protected information that is compelled under 
sections 3 or 4 shall— 
(1) not be overbroad, unreasonable, or oppres-
sive, and as appropriate, be limited to the pur-
pose of verifying published information or de-
scribing any surrounding circumstances rel-
evant to the accuracy of such published infor-
mation; and 
(2) be narrowly tailored in subject matter and 
period of time covered so as to avoid compelling 
the production of peripheral, nonessential, or 
speculative information. 
SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to— 
(1) apply to civil defamation, slander, or libel 
claims or defenses under State law, regardless of 
whether or not such claims or defenses, respec-
tively, are raised in a State or Federal court; or 
(2) prevent the Federal Government from pur-
suing an investigation of a covered journalist or 
organization that is— 
(A) suspected of committing a crime; 
(B) a witness to a crime unrelated to engaging 
in journalism; 
(C) suspected of being an agent of a foreign 
power, as defined in section 101 of the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (50 U.S.C. 
1801); 
(D) an individual or organization designated 
under Executive Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701 
note; relating to blocking property and prohib-
iting transactions with persons who commit, 
threaten to commit, or support terrorism); 
(E) a specially designated terrorist, as that 
term is defined in section 595.311 of title 31, Code 
of Federal Regulations (or any successor there-
to); or 
(F) a terrorist organization, as that term is de-
fined in section 212(a)(3)(B)(vi)(II) of the Immi-
gration 
and 
Nationality 
Act 
(8 
U.S.C. 
1182(a)(3)(B)(vi)(II)). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. FITZ-
GERALD) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4330. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
b 1700 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4330, the Protect Reporters 
from Exploitative State Spying Act, or 
the PRESS Act. 
The PRESS Act would create a 
strong but qualified Federal statutory 
privilege that protects journalists from 
being compelled by the Federal Gov-
ernment to reveal confidential sources 
and information. 
Additionally, the bill prohibits the 
Federal Government from compelling 
an electronic service provider that 
stores a journalist’s information to dis-
close that information, as well as infor-
mation relating to the journalist’s per-
sonal account or technology device, to 
the government unless a court deter-
mines that there is a reasonable threat 
of imminent violence absent the infor-
mation’s disclosure and subject to 
other requirements and certain speci-
fied exceptions. 
H.R. 4330 is necessary and long-over-
due legislation. 
Over the past several decades, Presi-
dential administrations of both parties 
have attempted to crack down on leaks 
of classified information to media out-
lets, and these investigations have in-
cluded efforts to obtain journalists’ 
records. For example, just last year, 
The Washington Post, The New York 
Times, and CNN reported that the De-
partment of Justice under the Trump 
administration sought the information 
and records of their reporters. 
The most sacred part of our freedom 
includes the protection and freedom of 
the press. That is embedded in the Con-
stitution in our First Amendment in 
the Bill of Rights, so to hear and to see 
that glaring infraction shows us the 
necessity of this legislation before us. 
In addition, during the Obama ad-
ministration, the Department report-
edly 
searched 
FOX 
News 
reporter 
James Rosen’s emails and even listed 
him as a coconspirator in an Espionage 
Act case it brought against a source of 
the leaked information. 
These and other recent episodes illus-
trate the need for stronger Federal pro-
tections 
for 
journalists 
and 
their 
sources. 
The truth is cleansing. The truth is 
democracy. 
Indeed, 40 States and the District of 
Columbia have enacted press shield 
laws, while other States afford similar 
privileges through their State con-
stitution of common law. 
Moreover, 
there 
has 
been 
long-
standing and bipartisan support in 
Congress for Federal protections. In

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7929 
September 19, 2022 
2005, 
former 
Vice 
President 
Mike 
Pence, when he was a Member of this 
body, first introduced the Free Flow of 
Information Act, which was very simi-
lar in concept to H.R. 4330. That legis-
lation subsequently passed the House 
twice in the 110th and the 111th Con-
gresses, the first time by 398–21, and 
the second time by voice vote. Unfortu-
nately, the Senate never took action 
on these bills, but I am pleased that ef-
forts to advance a Federal reporters 
shield bill continue in the House today. 
Again, we must stand for liberty. It 
is my hope that the Senate will finally 
take up this important issue. 
I thank Congressmen JAMIE RASKIN, 
TED LIEU, and JOHN YARMUTH for their 
work on the PRESS Act. I also thank 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
ranking 
member, JIM JORDAN, for his support. 
The need for this legislation is as 
great, if not greater, than when it was 
first introduced in an earlier form 
many years ago. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this impor-
tant bipartisan legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, there is a reason why 
the Founders chose to enshrine the 
freedoms of the press in the First 
Amendment to the Constitution. It is 
an important part of a functional and 
informed democracy. 
Over the years, versions of this bill 
have received widespread support from 
across the political spectrum. In fact, 
the first version of this bill was intro-
duced by none other than Vice Presi-
dent Pence when he was a Member of 
this body. 
Liberty depends on the freedom of 
the press. Good reporters are com-
mitted to holding our government ac-
countable. A critical aspect of the free-
dom of the press is the pursuit of truth 
without intimidation or coercion from 
the government. 
Administrations of both parties have 
unjustly targeted journalists, but none 
more so in recent years than the 
Obama administration. The Obama ad-
ministration’s control on the flow of 
information has been described as ‘‘the 
most aggressive . . . since the Nixon 
administration.’’ 
The Biden administration isn’t prov-
ing to be much better. 
In a free country, we need to make 
sure 
that 
the 
government 
cannot 
unmask journalists’ sources without 
good cause. This bill provides those 
protections and recognizes the impor-
tance of independent journalism to our 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN), the author of 
the PRESS Act, who has been per-
sistent in his commitment to civil lib-
erties as an important member of the 
Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding and for 
her very distinguished and passionate 
advocacy for civil liberties and civil 
rights. I thank her for her excellent 
management of this legislation. I also 
thank the floor leader on the minority 
side for his excellent words on the leg-
islation, as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bill, H.R. 4330, the Protect Re-
porters from Exploitative State Spying 
Act, or the PRESS Act, which I intro-
duced with Congressmen LIEU and YAR-
MUTH. It is a close successor to the bill 
that then-Congressman Mike Pence got 
passed in the House in the 110th Con-
gress by a lopsided vote of 398–21. 
Given that the bill passed unani-
mously in the Judiciary Committee 
earlier this year, I am very hopeful 
that this is the Congress in which we 
can get it done. 
Our Founders insisted that the Amer-
ican people must have the means to ac-
quire the truth about their own gov-
ernment, 
their 
society, 
and 
their 
world. Those ‘‘who mean to be their 
own governors,’’ said Madison, ‘‘must 
arm themselves with the power which 
knowledge gives.’’ 
Newspapers were critical, a form of 
continuing public education about gov-
ernment and about society. Thomas 
Jefferson said: ‘‘If it were left to me to 
decide whether we should have a gov-
ernment without newspapers or news-
papers without a government, I should 
not hesitate a moment to prefer the 
latter.’’ 
The great Tom Paine not only de-
fended but demonstrated the power of 
the pen as the people’s weapon against 
political tyranny. His sensationally 
successful pamphlet ‘‘Common Sense’’ 
argued the central importance of free 
speech and free press to the survival of 
political democracy. 
In theory, the specific command in 
the First Amendment that Congress 
shall make no law abridging the free-
dom of the press was unnecessary be-
cause press freedom would already, by 
definition, be subsumed under the free-
dom of speech. The Framers insisted 
upon protecting the structurally dis-
tinctive role that the press plays as a 
watchdog institution in a representa-
tive democratic society. 
Not everyone can go to congressional 
hearings or State legislative sessions 
or county council meetings late into 
the night. Not all of us can travel to 
Ukraine to uncover Russian war crimes 
against the people there or go to Af-
ghanistan to see what it means to have 
theocratic tyranny oppressing the peo-
ple. Not everyone can personally go get 
the Pentagon Papers or break the Wa-
tergate scandal or penetrate crime and 
drug trafficking rings or see with their 
own eyes how climate change is rav-
aging the Louisiana coast or Pakistan. 
As citizens of the United States, we are 
all equally implicated and affected by 
these developments, and we are all 
equally invested in obtaining the truth 
about them. This is why we need pro-
fessional journalists and newspapers. 
Yet, reporters in our country face vi-
olence, threats, intimidation, and even 
jail time just for doing their jobs, pro-
viding news and information. 
The Committee to Protect Journal-
ists reported that journalists in the 
United States faced unprecedented at-
tacks in 2020. At least 110 reporters 
were arrested or criminally charged in 
relation to their reporting, and around 
300 were assaulted in 2020 alone. 
Many families in my State of Mary-
land are still reeling from the mass 
shooting at the Capital Gazette news-
paper in Annapolis, which took the 
lives of five different journalists and 
injured several others in 2018. 
Lots of reporters face harsh legal 
consequences just for reporting and 
then faithfully maintaining the con-
fidentiality of sources. 
One journalist who faced repercus-
sions simply for doing his job I know 
well—Brian Karem, one of my constitu-
ents. In 1990 and 1991, he went to jail 
four different times to protect con-
fidential sources while working as a TV 
reporter. The last time, he went to jail 
for nearly 2 weeks while the Supreme 
Court considered his case, and he was 
only spared a long sentence when his 
source moved from Texas to California 
and, no longer fearing for her life, came 
forward. 
Now more than ever, we need to 
make good on the constitutional prom-
ise of a free press by establishing a 
Federal shield law to protect journal-
ists against government overreach and 
prosecutorial abuses that may occur 
from one administration to the next. 
The PRESS Act is an update of the 
Free Flow of Information Act that I in-
troduced with the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN), the ranking member of 
the Judiciary Committee, in the 115th 
Congress. It will prevent Federal law 
enforcement from being able to obtain 
information from covered journalists 
through their work devices and ac-
counts, as well as their personal de-
vices and accounts. It will also prevent 
government officials from conducting 
an end run around these prohibitions 
by precluding them from seeking third- 
party communications held by commu-
nications services, except in narrow 
and carefully cabined exceptional in-
stances. 
America favors shield laws to protect 
the media because our people know 
that the press is not the enemy of the 
people. The press is the people’s best 
friend. 
Forty-nine States and Washington, 
D.C., have already passed State shield 
laws or adopted some kind of reporter’s 
privilege of their own. What better evi-
dence could we have that the American 
people want a free and aggressive press 
to expose corruption and safeguard de-
mocracy? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman.

vently hope that my colleagues on both

sides of the aisle—indeed, every Mem-
ber of the House of Representatives— 
will rise to support this bill, the suc-
cessor to our 2017 bipartisan bill and 
the successor to the bill that then-Con-
gressman, now-Vice President Mike 
Pence navigated to victory in the 
House on a vote of 398–21 15 years ago. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for her indulgence. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
would inform you and my colleague 
from Texas that I have no further 
speakers, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just comment, as 
I determine whether we have any fur-
ther speakers, that this protection of 
the First Amendment rights of our 
journalists are so crucial, and this leg-
islation enjoys bipartisan support. 
We have already made the point that 
we have found some offense of this in 
bipartisan officeholders, government, 
so I think it is important, in the spirit 
of harmony today, that we choose no 
President to suggest one was more so 
than the others, and I can’t think of 
any comparison to the previous admin-
istration. But, today, we are standing 
here and wanting to bring people to-
gether around the importance of ensur-
ing that the press is protected and 
shielded, that the truth is cleansing, 
and that the truth is heard. 
Clearly, in the Trump administra-
tion, the truth was challenged, and we 
are grateful that the press stood tall. 
I believe this legislation is extremely 
important to cleanse all persons in 
public life so that public officials can 
serve in the spirit of transparency and 
that journalists can provide the facts 
to all the people of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, H.R. 4330 
is a bipartisan effort similar to legisla-
tion worked on by Vice President 
Pence. 
b 1715 
The Judiciary Committee reported 
the bill on a bipartisan basis by voice 
vote. In addition, H.R. 4330 is supported 
by numerous civil liberties and jour-
nalist 
organizations, 
including 
the 
American Civil Liberties Union, De-
mand Progress, the Society of Profes-
sional Journalists, the News Media Al-
liance, the National Association of 
Broadcasters, the National Press Pho-
tographers Association, the Radio Tel-
evision Digital News Association, the 
News Leaders Association, MPA—the 
Association of Magazine Media, the 
Project for Privacy and Surveillance 
Accountability, 
and 
the 
Reporters 
Committee for Freedom of the Press. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
4330, the ‘‘Protect Reporters from Exploitative 
State Spying Act’’ or the ‘‘PRESS Act.’’ The 
PRESS Act would create a strong, but quali-
fied, federal statutory privilege that protects 
journalists from being compelled by the federal 
government to reveal confidential sources and 
information. 
Additionally, the bill prohibits the federal 
government from compelling an electronic 
service provider that stores a journalist’s infor-
mation to disclose that information, as well as 
information relating to the journalist’s personal 
account or technology device, to the govern-
ment, unless a court determines that there is 
a reasonable threat of imminent violence ab-
sent the information’s disclosure, and subject 
to other requirements and certain specified ex-
ceptions. 
H.R. 4330 is necessary and long overdue 
legislation. 
Over the past several decades, presidential 
administrations of both parties have attempted 
to crack down on leaks of classified informa-
tion to media outlets, and these investigations 
have included efforts to obtain journalists’ 
records. 
For example, just last year, The Washington 
Post, The New York Times, and CNN reported 
that the Department of Justice under the 
Trump Administration sought the information 
and records of their reporters. 
In addition, during the Obama Administra-
tion, the Department reportedly searched Fox 
News reporter James Rosen’s e-mails and 
even listed him as a co-conspirator in an Espi-
onage Act case that it brought against the 
source of the leaked information. 
These and other recent episodes illustrate 
the need for stronger federal protections for 
journalists and their sources. 
Indeed, forty states and the District of Co-
lumbia have enacted press shield laws, while 
other states afford similar privileges through 
their state constitutions and common law. 
Moreover, there has been longstanding and 
bipartisan support in Congress for federal pro-
tections. 
In 2005, Former Vice President Mike Pence, 
when he was a member of this body, first in-
troduced the ‘‘Free Flow of Information Act,’’ 
which was very similar in concept to H.R. 
4330. That legislation subsequently passed 
the House twice, in the 110th and 111th Con-
gresses, the first time by a 398 to 21 vote, 
and the second time by voice vote. 
Unfortunately, the Senate never took action 
on those bills, but I am pleased that efforts to 
advance a federal reporters’ shield bill con-
tinue in the House today. It is my hope that 
the Senate will finally take up this important 
issue. 
I want to thank Congressmen JAMIE RASKIN, 
TED LIEU, and JOHN YARMUTH for their work on 
the PRESS Act. I also thank Judiciary Com-
mittee Ranking Member JIM JORDAN for his 
support. 
The need for this legislation is as great, if 
not greater, than when it was first introduced 
in its earlier form many years ago. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote YES on this 
important bipartisan legislation. 
As I noted earlier, H.R. 4330 and similar 
federal press shield legislation has long en-
joyed strong bipartisan support. The Judiciary 
Committee reported the bill on a bipartisan 
basis by voice vote. 
In addition, H.R. 4330 is supported by nu-
merous civil liberties and journalists’ organiza-
tions, including the American Civil Liberties 
Union, Demand Progress, the Society of Pro-
fessional Journalists, the News Media Alli-
ance, the National Association of Broad-
casters, the National Press Photographers As-
sociation, the Radio Television Digital News 
Association, the News Leaders Association, 
MPA—The Association of Magazine Media, 
the Project for Privacy and Surveillance Ac-
countability, Protect The 1st, and the Report-
ers Committee for Freedom of the Press. 
Given the broad support for the bill and the 
pressing need for federal protections for jour-
nalists and their sources, I urge the House to 
pass H.R. 4330. 
Mr. Speaker, given the broad support 
of the bill and the pressing need for 
Federal protections for journalists and 
their sources, I urge the House to pass 
H.R. 4330, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4330, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7931 
September 19, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3034 which would amend title 28 of the 
U.S. Code to provide an additional 
place for holding court in the Western 
District of Washington. 
This one-sentence bill would allow 
the residents of that district which is 
comprised of half of Washington State 
from the Cascade Mountains to the Pa-
cific Ocean to attend Federal Court in 
Mount Vernon, Washington, halfway 
between Seattle and the Canadian bor-
der. 
Currently, 
residents 
of 
the 
sur-
rounding counties, including the third 
most populous county in the State, 
have to travel significant distances to 
access the Federal justice system lead-
ing to increased travel time and admin-
istrative costs. Adding Mount Vernon 
as an additional court location would 
alleviate those burdens. It would also 
be a cost-free change because there is 
an existing facility available for the 
court to use, and no court personnel 
would be permanently stationed there. 
Making use of this existing facility 
would ensure that litigants, attorneys, 
witnesses, and other court users would 
have greater access to the justice that 
our Federal courts provide. 
Mr. Speaker, the Judiciary Com-
mittee is the holder, protector, and 
nurturer of the Constitution. There is 
probably nothing as important among 
other elements but for the right to a 
trial by jury or right to be heard as a 
litigant in a court. This important leg-
islation is suggesting that those who 
may have difficulty or are even de-
prived because of distance or other 
issues dealing with the far reaches of 
where this court is away from them 
can now have unfettered access to 
court in their region, in their area. 
This move will benefit the many in-
dividuals who live, work, and do busi-
ness in northwest Washington which is 
very far from the present site of the 
Federal 
Court. 
This 
legislation 
is 
broadly supported by the judges, attor-
neys, prosecutors, public defenders, and 
law enforcement in the Western Dis-
trict of Washington. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
SUZAN DELBENE and RICK LARSEN for 
calling attention to this issue and for 
introducing this legislation to improve 
the lives of the residents of Washington 
State. Chairman NADLER and all of the 
members of the Judiciary Committee 
were very pleased to work with this 
legislation, 
and 
Congresswoman 
DELBENE and Congressman LARSEN to 
be able to make this fix to provide an 
additional pathway of justice and the 
protection of the constitutional rights 
of individuals to have their access to 
courts and to trials by jury. 
At this point, Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers, I am prepared to close, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. Speaker, it 
appears that this bill has wide, bipar-
tisan support among Members of Con-
gress. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers. I urge my colleagues to support 
the bill, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is good music and 
good sounds to hear my colleague indi-
cating that this legislation has wide-
spread support, and he is absolutely 
right. 
The only point that I would want to 
emphasize is that whenever this body 
and this Judiciary Committee can ex-
pand the rights to the protection of 
Americans and their rights to access 
justice, we should stand tall. 
Today, this legislation, with a small 
fix of providing an additional site for 
the people of western Washington to 
access their constitutional, judicial, 
and legal rights, I think this is a cele-
bration. So because of the broad sup-
port for this, we are delighted. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 
3034, and make known that it is a 
straightforward bill that will improve 
the administration of justice in Wash-
ington State and will reinforce our 
duty and responsibility to the Amer-
ican people for justice. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3034, 
which would amend title 28 of the U.S. Code 
to provide an additional place for holding court 
in the Western District of Washington. 
This one-sentence bill would allow residents 
of that district, which comprises half of Wash-
ington state—from the Cascade Mountains to 
the Pacific Ocean—to attend federal court in 
Mount Vernon, Washington, halfway between 
Seattle and the Canadian border. 
Currently, residents of the surrounding 
counties, including the third most-populous 
county in the state, have to travel significant 
distances to access the federal justice system, 
leading to increased travel time and adminis-
trative costs. Adding Mount Vernon as an ad-
ditional court location would alleviate those 
burdens. It would also be a cost-free change 
because there is an existing facility available 
for the court to use, and no court personnel 
would be permanently stationed there. 
Making use of this existing facility would en-
sure that litigants, attorneys, witnesses, and 
other court users would have greater access 
to the justice that our federal courts provide. 
This move will benefit the many individuals 
who live, work, and do business in Northwest 
Washington, and this legislation is broadly 
supported by the judges, attorneys, prosecu-
tors, public defenders, and law enforcement in 
the Western District of Washington. 
I thank Representatives SUZAN DELBENE 
and RICK LARSEN for calling attention to this 
issue and for introducing this legislation to im-
prove the lives of the residents of Washington 
state. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support the 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3034 is a straightforward 
bill that will improve the administration of jus-
tice in Washington State. I urge my colleagues 
to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 4009, the Enslaved Voyages Me-
morial Act, introduced by my col-
league, 
Representative 
ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON. 
This bill will authorize the establish-
ment of a memorial on Federal land in 
the District of Columbia and its sur-
roundings 
commemorating 
the 
enslaved individuals who disembarked 
here after forced migration by way of 
the transatlantic slave trade. 
This memorial will honor the lives of 
all enslaved individuals, celebrate their 
contributions to our history, and rec-
ognize their remarkable resilience and 
fortitude throughout four centuries of 
slavery. 
During this time period, enslavers 
forced the transport of 12.5 million cap-
tive Africans to sell in the Americas. 
The Georgetown waterfront has an ex-
tensive and long-neglected history of 
involvement in the slave trade. In fact, 
1,475 enslaved individuals disembarked 
at the Georgetown waterfront while 
the institution of slavery grew on this 
continent. 
Establishing a memorial to honor 
those who were enslaved will create a 
powerful site of truth-telling and re-
membrance. 
I thank my colleague, Delegate Nor-
ton, for introducing this important and 
significant piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4009 
offered 
by 
Delegate 
ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON, which authorizes the 
Georgetown African American Historic 
Landmark Project and Tour to estab-
lish a work on Federal land in Wash-
ington, D.C., to commemorate the 
enslaved individuals, whose identities 
may be known or unknown, who en-
dured the forced voyage across the At-
lantic Ocean to the United States dur-
ing the Middle Passage. 
This effort is being championed by 
the Georgetown African American His-
toric Landmark Project, a community- 
based nonprofit organization dedicated 
to honoring the enslaved and free Afri-
can Americans who worked in, lived in, 
and built Georgetown. 
In 2019, the United Nations Edu-
cational, Scientific and Cultural Orga-
nization designated the Georgetown 
waterfront as a site of memory for his-
torical places associated with slavery. 
The bill requires the Georgetown Af-
rican American Historic Landmark 
Project and Tour to follow the stand-
ard legal framework established by the 
Commemorative 
Works 
Act 
Com-
mittee. This is a great effort, and I ap-
plaud Delegate Holmes Norton for her 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON), who is the prin-
cipal sponsor of the legislation. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend, Chairman GRIJALVA, 
for yielding, and I thank him and 
Chairman NEGUSE for bringing this bill 
to the floor. 
This bill would authorize the George-
town African American Historic Land-
mark Project and Tour to establish a 
memorial on Federal land in the Dis-
trict of Columbia commemorating the 
enslaved 
individuals 
who 
endured 
forced migration to the United States 
by way of the transatlantic slave trade. 
The National Capital Memorial Advi-
sory Commission unanimously sup-
ported this bill, and it passed out of 
committee by unanimous consent. 
We must not hide this history. 
Enslaved individuals, known and un-
known, rest at the core of our Nation’s 
history. The atrocities of the system of 
chattel slavery shed light on our Na-
tion’s central struggle between slavery 
and freedom—a freedom under which 
some could be owned, beaten, separated 
from their families, and denied any 
rights. 
This bill provides for the creation of 
a powerful marker of truth-telling and 
remembrance. 
Let 
us 
honor 
the 
personhood of these individuals who 
were repeatedly assumed to have none 
so that they will never be forgotten. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. WESTERMAN). 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill along with the other suspension 
bills that we have worked with Chair-
man GRIJALVA
to get on the floor 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to rec-
ognize the dedicated service of one of 
my staff members, Terry Camp, who 
will be leaving us next month. 
Known affectionately as ‘‘Turbo’’ by 
his colleagues, he has certainly lived 
up to that nickname. Since starting on 
the House Committee on Natural Re-
sources in 2015, Terry has had a hand in 
nearly 60 bills that have been signed 
into law. This total doesn’t even ac-
count for the countless bills he has 
been a part of that have been enacted 
as part of various legislative packages. 
While this is an impressive total, it 
doesn’t even come close to the number 
of now-famous Capitol tours he has 
given, which he offers in both English 
and Spanish. 
As our national parks staffer, he has 
visited numerous national park units 
throughout his tenure, frequently stop-
ping by any nearby units on family va-
cations. That dedication has led to the 
creation of many new bills, including 
the Save the Liberty Theater Act 
which was signed into law earlier this 
year.

Terry’s passion for public service is 
perhaps surpassed only by his passion 
for the Utah State University Aggies. 
Terry exemplifies the guiding prin-
ciples of my office by always abiding in 
love, competing to win, and succeeding 
through service. While we will miss 
him in the Halls of Congress, we wish 
him, his wife, Kayla, and their son, Eli-
jah, all the best as they start the next 
chapter of their lives back in their 
home State of Utah.

ance of my time.

tion of this bill, and I yield back the

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-

mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. CARL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 6353, the National Service Ani-
mals Memorial Act, introduced by my 
colleague, Representative SUSAN WILD. 
The bill would authorize the National 
Service Animals Monument Corpora-
tion to establish commemorative work 
on Federal land in the District of Co-
lumbia, and its surroundings, to com-
memorate the heroic deeds and sac-
rifices of service animals—and handlers 
of 
service 
animals—in 
the 
United 
States. 
The bill recognizes the National 
Service Animals Monument Corpora-
tion’s mission to honor and recognize 
the broad scope of service animals 
through a memorial to educate the 
public of the contributions by service 
animals and of the human-animal bond 
between service animals and their han-
dlers. 
The memorial will ensure that the 
contributions of service and working 
animals are understood, and that their 
history is not forgotten. 
In doing so, the bill recognizes the 
lifesaving and life-sustaining service 
these animals so generously provide to 
our communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Representative WILD, for introducing 
this legislation and championing this 
bill on behalf of her constituents. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 
6353, a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6353, offered by 
Representative WILD, would authorize 
the National Service Animals Memo-
rial Corporation to create a commemo-
rative work on Federal land in Wash-
ington, D.C., to honor the heroic acts 
and sacrifices of service animals and 
their handlers. 
The commemorative work would fea-
ture the contributions of animals, such 
as heroic service dogs, that have as-
sisted humans for generations by serv-
ing as guides for those with disabilities 
and 
supporting 
law 
enforcement, 
search and rescue, and military per-
sonnel. 
Some well-known examples of heroic 
dogs include Cairo, which was part of 
the Navy SEAL team that killed 
Osama bin Laden. H.R. 6353 prohibits 
the use of Federal funds to create or 
maintain this work. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
WILD for her work on this legislation, 
and I urge adoption of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6353, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

KEEP AMERICA’S REFUGES 
OPERATIONAL ACT OF 2022 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 6734) to amend the Fish and Wild-
life Act of 1956 to reauthorize the vol-
unteer services, community partner-
ship, and refuge education programs of 
the National Wildlife Refuge System, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6734 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Keep Amer-

‘‘2018 through 2022’’ and inserting ‘‘2023 
through 2027’’. 
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7934 
September 19, 2022 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6734, the Keep America’s Refuges Oper-
ational Act, introduced by our col-
league, 
Representative 
HAKEEM 
JEFFRIES. 
This bill will reauthorize the volun-
teer services, community partnerships, 
and refuge education programs of the 
National Wildlife Refuge System. 
The refuge system spreads itself 
across 568 national wildlife refuges and 
protects nearly 837 million acres of 
land, water, and wetlands. These im-
portant lands serve as homes for over 
an array of species, including 700 birds, 
220 mammals, 1,000 fish, and 250 reptile 
and amphibian species. 
Volunteers in the refuge system are 
crucial to keeping the refuges running, 
encouraging millions of the tourists 
each year, and generating billions of 
local revenue while creating jobs for 
neighboring communities. 
Reauthorizing these volunteer serv-
ices allows the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice to continue providing transpor-
tation, uniforms, lodging, awards, sub-
sistence, and training for those who 
selflessly choose to volunteer on these 
projects. 
During the March hearing on the bill, 
we heard from Ms. Caroline Brouwer of 
the National Wildlife Refuge Associa-
tion, and Ms. Joan Patterson from the 
Coalition of Refuge Friends and Advo-
cates about the outside role that vol-
unteers and friend groups play in keep-
ing refuges running, as well as serving 
and connecting with the local commu-
nity. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service also 
testified in support of the legislation. 
In June, the National Resources Com-
mittee reported the bill to the House 
by unanimous consent. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the bill 
sponsor and my colleagues on the com-
mittee for the bipartisan support for 
this legislation, and I urge its adop-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6734, the Keep America’s Refuges Oper-
ational Act of 2022. 
This bill introduced by my col-
leagues, Mr. JEFFRIES, Mr. WITTMAN, 
and Mr. GRAVES, reauthorizes volun-
teer programs at our national wildlife 
refuges. 
Specifically, this bill would reauthor-
ize for 5 fiscal years several U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Services programs, includ-
ing those related to volunteer services, 
community 
partnerships, 
donations 
and gifts, and education projects. 
The Fish and Wildlife Services cur-
rently utilize volunteers for tours, re-
storing the habitat, plant and animal 
surveys, staffing refuge stores and vis-
itor centers, and all other activities. 
While I believe more work needs to 
be done to improve our overall man-
agement of our national wildlife ref-
uges, the volunteer activities that this 
bill will reauthorize are an effective 
tool to perform needed work without 
increasing costs to taxpayers. 
Solutions such as this legislation are 
especially welcome during times like 
these when our national debt continues 
to balloon, and inflation continues to 
soar 
because 
of 
reckless 
spending 
pushed forward by the majority and 
the current administration. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chair for yielding, as 
well as his continued leadership of this 
all-important committee and in con-
nection with this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of H.R. 
6734, the Keep America’s Refuges Oper-
ational Act. I thank my colleagues, 
Representatives 
THOMPSON
and 
SABLAN, and certainly Representative 
WITTMAN
for his leadership on the 
other side of the aisle. 
This commonsense and bipartisan 
legislation reauthorizes the National 
Wildlife 
Refuge 
System 
volunteer, 
community partnership, and education 
program. Because of this program, ref-
uges continue to benefit from volun-
teer support, which has successfully 
saved taxpayer dollars, generated mil-
lions for local economies, and pro-
moted jobs in communities throughout 
America. 
The National Wildlife Refuge System 
is comprised of over 560 refuges located 
in every United States territory and 
State. They make up over 800 million 
acres of habitat dedicated to the con-
servation of fish and wildlife. Each 
year, National Wildlife Refuge System 
hosts more than 60 million visitors, 
generating over $3 billion in revenue 
for local economies and supporting 
more than 40,000 jobs. 
Visitors come from all over to ex-
plore, hunt, fish, and enjoy America’s 
natural beauty. Refuges help to mold 
the next generation of conservationists 
and outdoor enthusiasts by providing 
learning 
experiences 
and 
cherished 
memories. 
But this wouldn’t be possible without 
the dedicated refuge volunteers and 
community partners who donate their 
time and their energy to keep refuges 
open and operational. During fiscal 
year 2021, approximately 11,700 volun-
teers gave close to 649,000 hours of 
their time, which is the equivalent of 
nearly 318 full-time employees or a 
contribution of more than $18 million. 
Volunteers provide critical support 
to full-time staff in numerous ways. 
They operate visitor centers, conduct 
fish and wildlife population surveys, 
maintain visitor structures, roads and 
paths, fight invasive species, and pro-
tect native plants and animals. They 
also help refuges raise money for key 
infrastructure projects and visitor cen-
ters. 
Volunteers are of all ages, come from 
diverse walks of life, work in many dif-
ferent capacities, and truly represent 
the gorgeous mosaic of the American 
people. But one thing they all have in 
common is their commitment to pre-
serving America’s natural beauty so 
that we can all enjoy it for years to 
come. 
In the 115th Congress, the House 
passed an identical reauthorization 
bill, which was signed into law by 
President Trump in April of 2018. Since 
that time, the program has continued 
to leverage volunteer hours allowing 
wildlife refuges to remain accessible 
for millions of visitors each year. It is 
my hope that we can again work across 
the aisle to support, in different ways, 
our National Wildlife Refuge System. 
b 1745 
I will take a moment to acknowledge 
the cosponsors of this legislation, 
Chairman GRIJALVA
and Representa-
tives GRAVES, THOMPSON, and SABLAN, 
with a particular special thanks to 
Representative WITTMAN for partnering 
with me, once again, to advance this 
legislation. I greatly appreciate their 
leadership and longstanding support 
for the National Wildlife Refuge Sys-
tem. 
Supporting this bill in this Chamber 
means supporting the economic bene-
fits to be gained from being good stew-
ards of the environment that God has 
given to this great country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6734. 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I urge adop-
tion of this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I con-
gratulate all involved on a significant 
partnership on this legislation that has 
brought benefits historically to our 
park systems and refuge systems and 
will continue to do so. Let me thank 
my friends across the aisle for their bi-
partisanship on that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6734, as 
amended.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7935

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7618 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF THE KOL ISRAEL 
FOUNDATION 
HOLOCAUST 
MEMO-
RIAL AS A NATIONAL MEMORIAL.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. CARL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 7618, introduced by my col-
league, 
Representative 
SHONTEL 
BROWN. 
This bill would designate the Kol 
Israel Foundation Holocaust Memorial 
in Bedford Heights, Ohio, as a national 
memorial. 
This bill recognizes the significance 
of the Kol Israel Foundation Holocaust 
Memorial, which helps preserve the 
memory of the 6 million Jews mur-
dered by the Nazi regime and honors 
the life and legacy of the Holocaust 
survivors who built this memorial. 
Completed in 1961 by survivors of the 
Holocaust residing in northeast Ohio, 
the Kol Israel Holocaust Memorial is 
likely the first and oldest Holocaust 
memorial in the United States. 
For more than 60 years, the Kol 
Israel Foundation has looked over the 
memorial, which has the ashes of Jew-
ish victims and other tokens of remem-
brance buried at its base. The bill en-
sures national historic recognition for 
the Kol Israel Holocaust Memorial and 
preserves the memories and resiliency 
of the victims and the survivors of the 
Holocaust. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
SHONTEL BROWN, for introducing this 
important legislation, for introducing 
this important acknowledgment and 
memorial, and championing the bill to 
the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7618, offered by 
Representative 
BROWN, 
would 
des-
ignate the Kol Israel Foundation Holo-
caust Museum at Zion Memorial Park 
in Bedford Heights, Ohio, a national 
memorial. 
This memorial was dedicated in May 
1961 and honors the 6 million Jews 
murdered during the Holocaust. It is 
one of the first Holocaust commemora-
tive works in the United States, and it 
is surrounded by walls with the names 
of those who died in the Holocaust, 
along with the survivors who later 
passed away. 
The memorial also includes the ashes 
of Jewish martyrs killed by Nazis from 
three concentration camps buried at 
its base. 
I hope the Kol Israel Foundation Hol-
ocaust Memorial will continue to bring 
peace and comfort to the families and 
the community who lost loved ones 
during the Holocaust. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. BROWN), 
the sponsor of the legislation. 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman GRIJALVA for his lead-
ership and for yielding to me. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7618, a bipartisan bill to recog-
nize the Kol Israel Foundation Holo-
caust Memorial as a national memo-
rial. 
H.R. 7618 was unanimously voted out 
of the House Natural Resources Com-
mittee on July 20, 2022, and its bipar-
tisan Senate companion, S. 4121, led by 
Senators SHERROD
BROWN
and ROB 
PORTMAN, favorably passed out of the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee on July 21, 2022. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill recognizes and 
honors a memorial in my district with 
a remarkable history. In 1961, surviving 
victims of the Holocaust erected the 
Kol Israel Memorial, dedicating it to 
the 6 million Jewish victims of the 
Nazi regime, its allies, and collabo-
rators. 
From 1939 to 1945, the Holocaust 
touched all corners of Jewish life from 
east to west, from Africa to Northern 
Europe. Thriving Jewish life in main-
land Europe was decimated. The geno-
cide wiped out entire Jewish commu-
nities, villages, and towns in a cam-
paign that Nazis carried out with ruth-
less precision. They did so with mass 
shootings, concentration camps, and 
death camps like none the world had 
ever seen. 
The trauma, pain, and suffering in-
flicted on the Jewish community were 
not confined to their side of the Atlan-
tic. Many members of our American 
Jewish community were touched by 
profound loss, and survivors found ref-
uge in many communities across the 
United States. 
One such group of survivors made its 
way to northeast Ohio, putting down 
roots in Bedford Heights, a thriving 
part of Ohio’s 11th Congressional Dis-
trict. They never forgot the horrors of 
the past and began planning a memo-
rial to the 6 million as early as 1959, 
only 14 years after the end of the Sec-
ond World War. 
Since the memorial’s dedication on 
May 28, 1961, survivors and their fami-
lies have continuously cared for what 
is likely the oldest memorial of its 
kind in the United States. 
On the memorial’s exterior walls, the 
survivors engraved the names of their 
family members and loved ones. At the 
foot of the monument, the survivors 
also buried firsthand artifacts and 
keepsakes and ashes of victims from 
three concentration camps. 
Given its historical significance, the 
Kol Israel Memorial deserves to be rec-
ognized by Congress. Designating the 
site as a national memorial ensures 
that future generations understand the 
true legacy of a very dark chapter in 
history. 
This legislation comes at no cost to 
taxpayers and does not establish the 
memorial as a unit of the National 
Park Service. The Kol Israel Founda-
tion will retain oversight and responsi-
bility for the memorial, as it has for 
six decades. 
Members of the Ohio community, in-
cluding Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, 
the Ohio General Assembly, and promi-
nent local and national stakeholders, 
have all supported efforts to recognize 
the Kol Israel Memorial. 
The bill also enjoys wide support 
from a coalition of organizations such 
as the Jewish Federation of Cleveland, 
the Anti-Defamation League, and the 
American Jewish Committee. 
I thank all the cosponsors of this leg-
islation, including our seven co-leads 
from both sides of the aisle: Represent-
atives KAPTUR, RYAN, BEATTY, JOYCE, 
BALDERSON, 
GONZALEZ, 
and 
CAREY. 
They, too, have a deep understanding 
of the importance of the Kol Israel Me-
morial and this legislation, particu-
larly at a time of rising anti-Semitism 
in the United States and around the 
world. 
Let me take one moment, Mr. Speak-
er, to speak about the dangers of Holo-
caust denial and distortion. Last night 
on ‘‘60 Minutes,’’ we watched in shock 
and disgust as the President of Iran de-
nied the existence of the Holocaust and 
pretended to seek more information on 
its veracity. 
Today, let us all speak in a loud and 
clear voice: The Holocaust happened. It 
was devastating. We must work every

day to remember so that we may hon-
estly say ‘‘never again.’’ 
I am honored to represent one of the 
country’s most celebrated Jewish com-
munities, which happens to reside in 
Ohio’s 11th Congressional District. Now 
is our opportunity to honor the victims 
of the Holocaust who call this country 
home and remember their bravery, 
dedication, and everlasting legacy. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my House col-
leagues for taking swift action on H.R. 
7618 so we may send a strong signal of 
support for our Jewish community. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this critical legislation.

the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield

BLACKWELL SCHOOL NATIONAL 
HISTORIC SITE ACT 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(S. 2490) to establish the Blackwell 
School National Historic Site in Marfa, 
Texas, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2490 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Blackwell 
School National Historic Site Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) the Blackwell School, located at 501 
South Abbott Street, in Marfa, Presidio 
County, Texas, is— 
(A) associated with the period of racial seg-
regation in Marfa public schools; and 
(B) the only extant property directly asso-
ciated with Hispanic education in Marfa 
since the other buildings were torn down 
after the Blackwell School closed in 1965; 
(2) the Blackwell School is a tangible re-
minder of the period during which the doc-
trine of ‘‘separate but equal’’ dominated edu-
cation and social systems; 
(3) despite being categorized as ‘‘white’’ by 
Texas law, Mexican Americans were regu-
larly excluded from commingling with Anglo 
individuals at barbershops, restaurants, fu-
neral homes, theaters, churches, and schools; 
(4) the spectrum of experiences of students 
and teachers at the Blackwell School are an 
important record of life in a segregated 
school in the context of the history of Texas 
and the United States; 
(5) Mexican and Mexican American culture 
and history in Marfa is tied to the Blackwell 
School, which for more than 50 years served 
as a leading feature of the Hispanic commu-
nity, illustrating the challenge of maintain-
ing cultural identity in a dominant Anglo so-
ciety; 
(6) Hispanic influences continue to be seen 
in social and religious organizations, busi-
ness 
and 
government 
institutions, 
and 
shared experiences of language, food, and 
music in Marfa, Texas; 
(7) the historic Blackwell School building 
is a physical record of— 
(A) the longevity and beauty of the distinc-
tive design and craftsmanship informed by 
traditional techniques and materials; and 
(B) 
the 
transition 
from 
the 
purely 
vernacular to the period of materials, design, 
and workmanship made available after the 
arrival of the railroad; 
(8) the original historic school building and 
grounds on which the Blackwell School 
building stands provide an authentic setting 
to commemorate and interpret the history of 
the Blackwell School; 
(9) the Blackwell School is closely associ-
ated with the broad patterns of local, State, 
and national history in the area of school 
segregation; and 
(10) Mexicans and other members of the 
Latin American diaspora have placed a high 
value on education as a means of economic, 
social, and political advancement, but His-
panics and Latinos have not always had eq-
uitable opportunities and access to quality 
educational facilities in the United States.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure that is before us under consider-
ation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-

Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
2490, the Blackwell School National

the House will recall, was sponsored 
primarily 
by 
Representative 
TONY 
GONZALES from Texas. 
S. 2490 is a companion to that legisla-
tion from the Senate, from Senator 
CORNYN, and this legislation directs the 
Secretary of the Interior to establish 
the Blackwell School National Historic 
Site to preserve, protect, and interpret 
the role of the Blackwell School as an 
academic and cultural cornerstone in 
Marfa, Texas. 
The Blackwell School was the sole 
public education institution for Mexi-
can-American children in Marfa from 
1909 until 1965, when local schools were 
finally integrated.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7937 
September 19, 2022 
The building is a tangible reminder 
of a time in American history where 
separate but equal remained prevalent 
in our culture. It is a symbol of com-
munity solidarity, pride, and identity, 
and it remains to this day. 
Approximately 
4,000 
students 
at-
tended the Blackwell School over the 
course of more than 50 years. Despite 
the inherent unfairness of segregation, 
the Blackwell School became a meet-
ing place and a source of pride for the 
local Mexican-American community in 
the region. 
Today, all that remains of the once- 
sprawling campus is a three-room 
adobe schoolhouse, one of the last such 
schools remaining in Texas. 
Designating the Blackwell School as 
a national historic site ensures that 
the story of the Blackwell School is 
maintained so that future Americans 
can learn from and understand its rich, 
complex, and troubling history. 
Representative 
TONY
GONZALES 
should be applauded for his efforts on 
this. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me today in supporting the bill 
and sending it to President Biden for 
his signature, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
b 1800 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 2490, the Blackwell School National 
Historic Site Act. This legislation, 
championed in the House by my friend, 
TONY GONZALES of Texas, would estab-
lish a new unit of the National Park 
System to tell the history of this seg-
regated education in Marfa, Texas. 
Although there was no State law that 
mandated separate schools for Hispanic 
students, Texas school districts prac-
ticed de facto segregation through the 
mid-20th century. 
Blackwell School was known origi-
nally as the Ward School and later re-
named for its longtime principal, Jesse 
Blackwell, who arrived at the school in 
1922. During Blackwell’s 25-year tenure, 
the school grew from one building with 
120 students to a multi-building cam-
pus with more than 600 students. 
The original historic school building 
and grounds provide an authentic set-
ting to the interpretation of history of 
segregated schools in Texas. 
I commend Mr. GONZALES
for his 
work on this important landmark. He 
has been a strong champion for this 
legislation, including writing House 
companion legislation that previously 
passed this Chamber with strong bipar-
tisan support. 
Madam Seaker, I urge adoption of 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further requests for time on 
this legislation. I am prepared to close. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. TONY GONZALES). 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to encour-
age my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Blackwell 
School National Historic Site Act. And 
I thank my distinguished colleague 
from Alabama for allowing me this op-
portunity. 
This 
bill 
would 
designate 
the 
Blackwell School in my district as one 
of the first national park sites dedi-
cated to Latino history. This legisla-
tion comes at a critical time, as we cel-
ebrate the accomplishments of the 
Latino community during Hispanic 
Heritage Month. 
From 1909 to 1965, the Blackwell 
School in Marfa, Texas, was the only 
public school for the city’s Mexican- 
American children. Although there was 
no State law that mandated separate 
schools for Hispanic students, it was 
common practice for them to be taught 
at different facilities. This meant that 
the Blackwell School was the only 
place where children of Mexican de-
scent could be educated and have a 
shot at the American Dream. 
Today, the Blackwell School reminds 
us of the resiliency the Mexican-Amer-
ican 
community 
has 
displayed 
throughout our history. 
Designating the Blackwell School as 
a national park site would improve the 
ability of the Park Service to oversee 
conservation efforts, promote regional 
tourism, and share important stories 
about the Mexican-American commu-
nity in the U.S. 
Please join me in passing this bill to 
honor the hard work and fighting spirit 
of the Hispanic community. 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, again, I 
urge the adoption of this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BROWN of Ohio). The question is on the 
motion offered by the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
2490. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned.

carrying out this Act, the Secretary of the Inte-
rior may not use eminent domain or condemna-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. CARL) each

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 820, the New Philadelphia Na-
tional Historic Site Act. New Philadel-
phia was the first town platted and le-
gally registered by an African Amer-
ican before the Civil War. It is listed on 
the 
National 
Register 
of 
Historic 
Places, designated as a National His-
toric Landmark, and included in the 
National Park Service’s National Un-
derground Railroad Network to Free-
dom program. 
This bill would further establish the 
New Philadelphia National Historic 
Site in Pike County, Illinois. 
Honoring the legacy of New Philadel-
phia and celebrating the history of 
Black Americans is critically impor-
tant. The protection and conservation 
of New Philadelphia ensures that this 
important history is preserved so that 
visitors to the site can have the oppor-
tunity to learn from and understand an 
important part of Illinois and Amer-
ican history. 
The story of New Philadelphia is our 
story, and it rightly deserves a place in 
our National Park System. 
As chair of the Natural Resources 
Committee, I am committed to advanc-
ing diversity, equity, and inclusion 
throughout our committee’s work, in-
cluding by advancing the preservation 
of forgotten or under-told stories. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
LAHOOD, for introducing this impor-
tant legislation and championing the 
bill on behalf of, not only of his con-
stituents, but the overall interest of 
the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 820, the New Philadelphia Na-
tional Historic Site Act, sponsored by 
Congressman DARIN LAHOOD of Illinois, 
which would establish New Philadel-
phia as a unit of the National Park 
System. 
New Philadelphia Town Site, located 
near Barry, Illinois, is the first known 
town in the United States to be estab-
lished and officially registered by an 
African American. 
The national historic site established 
by this bill will tell the inspiring story 
of ‘‘Free Frank’’ McWorter, who found-
ed New Philadelphia in 1836. He was 
born into slavery in South Carolina in 
1777 and spent the first 42 years of his 
life 
enslaved. 
He 
worked 
to 
save 
enough money to purchase the freedom 
of his expectant wife, Lucy, and ensur-
ing the freedom of their child. Two 
years later, he purchased his own free-
dom. 
The family moved to a pioneer home-
stead 
in 
Illinois, 
where 
McWorter 
founded a town called New Philadel-
phia where free-born and formerly 
enslaved 
African 
Americans 
lived, 
alongside European Americans in a re-
gion and an era intense with racial 
strife. 
New Philadelphia was added to the 
National Register of Historic Places in 
2005 and was designated a National His-
toric Landmark in 2009. New Philadel-
phia is also listed as part of the Na-
tional Underground Railroad Network 
to Freedom. 
I commend Representative LAHOOD 
for sponsoring this bipartisan and lo-
cally supported bill. New Philadelphia 
will be a valuable addition to the Na-
tional Park System. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further requests for time on 
my side, and I am prepared to close. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. LAHOOD). 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Alabama (Mr. 
CARL) for yielding and for his terrific 
work on the Natural Resources Com-
mittee, and I thank the majority and 
Chairman GRIJALVA for their support. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of my bipartisan bill, 
H.R. 820, the New Philadelphia Na-
tional Historic Site Act. 
Located in West Central Illinois, near 
the Missouri border, in Barry, Illinois, 
is New Philadelphia. Founded in 1836 
by Frank McWorter, this was the first 
town founded, platted, and registered 
by an African American in the United 
States. 
Once an enslaved person himself, Mr. 
Frank McWorter also known as ‘‘Free 
Frank,’’ 
bought 
his 
freedom. 
Mr. 
McWorter went on in his life and in his 
legacy to establish New Philadelphia, 
but also to demonstrate the critical 
role many African Americans played in 
their own freedom efforts. 
Through the sale of land in New 
Philadelphia, among other business 
ventures, Free Frank used his earnings 
to free 15 other family members out of 
slavery. Additionally, many of the resi-
dents of New Philadelphia, both Euro-
pean Americans and African Ameri-
cans, later came together to assist 
freedom-seekers moving north from 
slave-occupied States and locations. 
The 40-acre original townsite is now 
nationally and historically significant. 
It is an archaeological site, advancing 
our understanding of free, rural com-
munities and the abolitionist move-
ment in the antebellum area. 
The New Philadelphia site has al-
ready been recognized for its historical 
significance. It is currently on the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places and 
is designated as a National Historic 
Landmark. The site is also included in 
the National Park Service Under-
ground Railroad Network to Freedom 
program, and the Smithsonian Na-
tional Museum of American History 
displays many of the artifacts un-
earthed from the area near New Phila-
delphia. 
This bipartisan bill would establish 
the New Philadelphia National Histor-
ical Park in the State of Illinois as a 
unit of the National Park System. 
Many local and regional organiza-
tions have worked tirelessly for many 
years to preserve and protect this site 
and they deserve so much credit. One 
organization in particular, the New 
Philadelphia Association, has done a 
tremendous job in improving, main-
taining, and endorsing the site for the 
benefit of New Philadelphia descend-
ants, those living in the surrounding 
community, and those visiting from 
afar. I am delighted to be here tonight 
to assist their efforts and support the 
continued advocacy of many of my en-
gaged constituents on this issue. 
Including New Philadelphia in the 
National Park System would provide 
certainty and ensure its continued 
preservation far into the future. The 
National Park Service will be able to 
provide the tools, resources, and exper-
tise necessary to elevate the site to its 
fullest potential. 
It is imperative that sites like New 
Philadelphia are preserved for years to 
come, so that future generations can 
better understand their important his-
tory as well as the lessons that history 
provides us. 
In closing, I thank the Natural Re-
sources Committee for supporting this 
important piece of legislation, and I 
urge the adoption of the bill. 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I urge 
the adoption of this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 820, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed.

LITTLE MANATEE WILD AND 
SCENIC RIVER ACT 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4358) to amend the Wild and 
Scenic Rivers Act to designate seg-
ments of the Little Manatee River as a 
component of the Wild and Scenic Riv-
ers System, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4358 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Little Manatee 
Wild and Scenic River Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DESIGNATION FOR STUDY OF WILD AND 
SCENIC RIVER SEGMENTS, LITTLE 
MANATEE RIVER, FLORIDA. 
Section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1276(a)) is amended by adding at the 
end the following: 
‘‘(ll) LITTLE
MANATEE
RIVER, FLORIDA.— 
The approximately 50-mile segment beginning at 
the source in southeastern Hillsborough County, 
Florida, downstream to the point at which the 
river enters Tampa Bay, including appropriate 
tributaries, but shall not include— 
‘‘(A) those portions lying within Manatee 
County, Florida, and being more particularly 
described as Parcel ID 247800059, Parcel ID 
248200008 and Parcel ID 248100000; and 
‘‘(B) South Fork.’’. 
SEC. 3. STUDY AND REPORT. 
Section 5(b) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1276(b)) is amended by adding at the 
end the following: 
‘‘(ll) LITTLE MANATEE RIVER, FLORIDA.—Not 
later than 3 years after the date on which funds 
are made available to carry out this paragraph, 
the Secretary of the Interior shall— 
‘‘(A) complete the study of the Little Manatee 
River, Florida named in subsection (a)(l); and 
‘‘(B) submit to the Committee on Natural Re-
sources of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of 
the Senate a report that describes the results of 
the study.’’. 
SEC. 4. EFFECT ON MANAGEMENT. 
This Act and the amendments made by this 
Act shall not interfere with the current manage-
ment of the area of the Little Manatee River de-
scribed in section 5(a)(l) of the Wild and Scenic 
Rivers Act, nor shall the fact that such area is 
listed for study under the Wild and Scenic Riv-
ers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.) be used as jus-
tification for more restrictive management until 
Congress acts on the study recommendations. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. CARL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the item 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4358, the Little Manatee Wild and 
Scenic River Act, offered by our col-
league from Florida, Representative 
BUCHANAN. 
The bill will formally designate an 
approximately 51-mile segment of the 
Little Manatee River in Florida as a 
national scenic river. 
Beginning at its source in south-
eastern Hillsborough County, the Lit-
tle Manatee River flows downstream 
into Tampa Bay. 
The river is one of the most pristine 
blackwater rivers in Southwest Florida 
and is designated as an outstanding 
Florida water. 
b 1815 
Like all other wild and scenic rivers 
throughout the country, this bill will 
protect the river for public enjoyment 
without the fear of intrusive develop-
ment. 
The bill ensures the river remains 
available for full a range of rec-
reational activities, such as canoeing, 
kayaking, boating, and fishing. 
Designating the Little Manatee River 
as a Scenic River will ensure that it 
continues to be enjoyed by future gen-
erations of Floridians and visitors of 
all stripes. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4358, the Little Manatee Wild and 
Scenic River Act. This bill, sponsored 
by my colleague from Florida, Rep-
resentative VERN BUCHANAN, would au-
thorize a study of the Little Manatee 
River in Florida to consider its inclu-
sion as a component of the National 
Wild and Scenic River System. 
The Little Manatee River, which has 
been designated an Outstanding Flor-
ida Water, transitions from a 10- to 20- 
food-wide creek flowing through an ash 
and oak floodplain forest to a 300-foot- 
wide 
tide-influenced 
river 
flowing 
through tidal marsh that empties into 
Tampa Bay. 
The bill contains important provi-
sions 
protecting 
private 
property 
rights that ensure that study cannot be 
used as a justification for new restric-
tive management practices unless Con-
gress acts to officially designate the 
river as part of the National Wild and 
Scenic River System at a future date. 
This bill is locally supported, and I 
commend Representative BUCHANAN for 
his work on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the gentleman from 
Alabama, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 4358, bipartisan legis-
lation I introduced last July with my fellow Flo-
ridian Rep. DARREN SOTO, regarding the Little 
Manatee River. I urge my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to join with us in voting in 
support of this bill. 
The Little Manatee Wild and Scenic River 
Act authorizes the National Park Service 
(NPS) to study whether it’s appropriate to add 
an approximately 51-mile-long segment of the 
Little Manatee River, from its source in south-
eastern Hillsborough County to the point at 
which the river enters Tampa Bay, to its Wild 
and Scenic River System. 
For my part, I strongly support both passage 
of this bill today and of subsequently adding 
the Little Manatee River to the NPS’ Wild and 
Scenic River program in the future. Passage 
of the bill before us today begins that journey 
and I have been very pleased to work with my 
colleagues on the Natural Resources Com-
mittee toward realizing that goal. 
Adding this river to the Wild and Scenic 
River program in the future will help ensure 
the Little Manatee will remain available for a 
full range of recreational activities for Florid-
ians, like canoeing, kayaking, boating and fish-
ing. 
In Florida, protecting our precious natural 
resources has always been a top priority. Flor-
ida’s Suncoast is blessed with an abundance 
of natural treasures like Sarasota Bay, Emer-
son Point Preserve and Myakka River State 
Park. 
I want all of my colleagues to know that 
adding the Little Manatee River to the Wild 
and Scenic River program enjoys strong local 
support as well. Both the Hillsborough County 
Commission and the Manatee County Com-
mission have approved resolutions supporting 
this designation. 
Of particular note, Hillsborough County 
Commission Chairman Stacy White has been 
a leader in the effort to add the Little Manatee 
River to the Wild and Scenic River program. 
He has been a champion of this effort from 
day one and an invaluable partner for me in 
my efforts at the federal level. 
Protecting and enhancing water quality for 
all of Southwest Florida has always been one 
of my highest priorities in Congress. 
Approving this bill today will move us for-
ward in our efforts to help ensure a vibrant, 
clean and healthy environment in my home 
state of Florida. It’s both an important element 
in our quality of life and a vital part of our eco-
nomic well-being because millions of people 
visit Florida every year. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the bipar-
tisan leadership of the Natural Resources 
Committee for working with me to bring H.R. 
4358 to the floor today. 
Again, I urge all of my colleagues in the 
House to join with me in voting for this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4358, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays.

CAPTAIN ROSEMARY BRYANT 
MARINER OUTPATIENT CLINIC 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7698) to designate the out-
patient clinic of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs in Ventura, Cali-
fornia, as the ‘‘Captain Rosemary Bry-
ant Mariner Outpatient Clinic’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7698 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) As of January 2021, of the 1,255 health 
care facilities of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, two are named after women. 
(2) Rosemary Ann Bryant was born on 
April 2, 1953, in Harlingen, Texas, to Captain 
Cecil Bryant and Constance Boylan Bryant, 
a World War II Navy nurse. 
(3) Captain Mariner was the first woman to 
enroll in the aeronautics program at Purdue 
University in 1971. 
(4) Captain Mariner joined the Navy in 
1973, and after graduating from officer can-
didate school that year, she became a mem-
ber of the Navy’s first flight-training class 
for women. 
(5) In 1974, Captain Mariner was one of six 
women to earn her wings and in 1975 she be-
came the first female Naval aviator to fly a 
jet attack aircraft. 
(6) In July 1990, Captain Mariner was 
named commander of Navy ‘‘Tactical Elec-
tronic Warfare Squadron 34’’ at Naval Air 
Station Point Mugu in Ventura County, 
California. The unit was 30 percent female 
and made Captain Mariner the first woman 
to command an operational air squadron, 
even though women were still barred from 
flying combat missions. 
(7) Captain Mariner became a passionate 
advocate for women in the military, leading 
the Women Military Aviators and working 
with Congress and the Department of De-
fense to lift restrictions barring women from 
flying in combat. 
(8) Captain Mariner attended the National 
War College in the District of Columbia, 
earning a master’s degree in national secu-
rity strategy and served on the staff of the 
Joint Chiefs at the Pentagon, and a professor 
of joint military studies at the National War 
College. 
(9) Captain Mariner retired from the Navy 
in 1997, and moved to Tennessee with her 
husband Commander Tommy Mariner and 
her daughter Emmalee. 
(10) During her Naval career Captain Mar-
iner logged 17 landings on aircraft carriers 
and more than 3500 flight hours in 15 dif-
ferent aircraft. 
(11) In retirement, Captain Mariner contin-
ued her service in her community as a resi-
dent scholar in the University of Tennessee’s 
Center for the Study of War and Society, and 
taught military history in UT’s history de-
partment for 15 years. 
(12) Captain Mariner passed away from 
ovarian cancer on January 24, 2019, in Knox-
ville, Tennessee. 
(13) In honor of Captain Mariner, the 
United States Navy conducted its first all-fe-
male flyover at the funeral service for Cap-
tain Mariner on Saturday, February 2, 2019, 
in Maynardville, Tennessee. 
(14) In July 2021, a panel of Ventura County 
members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and 
military spouses recommended that the Ven-
tura Medical Center be named in honor of 
Captain Rosemary Bryant Mariner. 
SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF CAPTAIN ROSEMARY 
BRYANT 
MARINER 
OUTPATIENT 
CLINIC. 
(a) DESIGNATION.—The outpatient clinic of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs in Ven-
tura, California, shall after the date of the 
enactment of this Act be known and des-
ignated as the ‘‘Captain Rosemary Bryant 
Mariner Outpatient Clinic’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘Captain Rosemary 
Bryant Mariner Outpatient Clinic’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
7698. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the 
memory of Captain Rosemary Bryant 
Mariner, a member of the Navy’s first 
flight-training class for women, the 
first woman to command a naval avia-
tion squadron, and a lifelong advocate 
for women’s military service. 
The bill before us, H.R. 7698, would 
appropriately name the VA outpatient 
clinic in Ventura, California, the ‘‘Cap-
tain Rosemary Bryant Mariner Out-
patient Clinic.’’ 
I 
thank 
Representative 
JULIA 
BROWNLEY, chairwoman of the Vet-
erans’ 
Affairs 
Committee’s 
Women 
Veterans Task Force, for championing 
this effort. 
The 
VA 
has 
more 
than 
1,200 
healthcare facilities nationwide, yet as 
of the beginning of this Congress, just 
two of these facilities bore the names 
of 
women 
veterans. 
Representative 
BROWNLEY’s bill will begin to correct 
this regretful disparity. 
More than 2 million women veterans 
live in the United States today. They 
serve across all military branches and 
divisions, and they are the fastest 
growing group of veterans that utilize 
VA healthcare services. So it is fitting 
that we honor a trailblazing woman 
like Captain Mariner at one of these 
VA healthcare facilities. 
Captain Mariner had service to this 
country in her veins. The daughter of a 
World War II Navy nurse and Army 
pilot killed in a plane crash when she 
was just 3 years old, Captain Mariner 
grew up watching planes take off and 
land at the Miramar Naval Air Station 
in San Diego, California. 
Captain Mariner went on to become 
the first woman to enroll in the aero-
nautics program at Purdue University 
in 1971, one of six initial women to earn 
her wings as a U.S. naval aviator in 
1974, and the first woman aviator to fly 
a jet attack aircraft in 1975. 
In 1990, Captain Mariner became com-
mander of the Navy’s tactical warfare 
squadron at Naval Air Station Point 
Mugu in Ventura County. 
She continued in public service fol-
lowing her 24-year military career, 
teaching military history at the Uni-
versity of Tennessee for an additional 
15 years. 
At Captain Mariner’s funeral service 
in 2019, following a long battle against 
ovarian cancer, the Navy conducted its 
first flyover featuring all female pilots. 
This was, like the naming of the Ven-
tura VA outpatient clinic will be, a fit-
ting tribute to a life of service to this 
Nation. 
H.R. 7698 has letters of support from 
the American Legion, Veterans of For-
eign Wars, and Disabled American Vet-
erans. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD these three letters. 
THE AMERICAN LEGION, 
DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA, 
Sanger, CA, April 6, 2022. 
Rep. JULIA BROWNLEY, 
Washington, DC. 
REP. BROWNLEY: The American Legion De-
partment of California is proud to support 
the naming of the Ventura County Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic 
after captain Rosemary Bryant Mariner. 
Since its founding in 1919, the American 
Legion has served veterans, service mem-
bers, and communities throughout our na-
tion. Our commitment to serving all vet-
erans has been one of the main pillars out-
lining our purpose. As the United State De-
partment of Veterans Affairs (VA) continues 
to make strides in the way it supports and 
cares for women veterans, I believe by re-
naming VA facilities after brave female vet-
erans it is a great step towards recognizing 
the contribution of this Nation’s woman 
warriors. 
On behalf of the 80,000+ American Legion 
members in California we urge congress to 
take action to name this facility to honor 
this woman veteran who embodies the true 
essence of duty and service to our commu-
nity, state, and Nation. 
Respectfully,

sixty-four thousand members of the Veterans 
of Foreign Wars Department of California, I 
am writing to support naming the Ventura

ant Mariner. 
It is our privilege to help recognize and

through legislative advocacy and fully sup-
port your work on behalf of our nation’s vet-
erans.

RANKING
MEMBERS: As Com-
mander of the Department of California Dis-
abled American Veterans representing over 
70,000 DAV Life Members in the State of 
California and in recognition of our fallen 
veterans and their survivors . . . as a depart-
ment of veterans—who advocate daily for the 
heroes that served this nation; we sincerely 
urge you to support the bill created to re-
name the Ventura VA Clinic in Ventura, 
California, after the late Captain Rosemary 
Bryant Mariner. 
Since the Revolutionary War, millions of 
women and minorities have served in the 
Armed Forces of the United States. They 
have served in every role, from infantry sol-
dier to cyber warfare engineer. Yet, as of 
January 2021, of the 1,255 VA healthcare fa-
cilities, only 13 have been dedicated to honor 
the service of minority veterans, and only 
two facilities have been named in honor of 
women veterans. 
Rosemary Ann Bryant was born on April 2, 
1953, in Harlingen, Texas, to Captain Cecil 
Bryant and Constance Boylan Bryant, a 
World War II Navy nurse. She was the first 
woman to enroll in the aeronautics program 
at Purdue University in 1971. She joined the 
Navy in 1973, and after graduating from offi-
cer candidate school that year, she became a 
member of the Navy’s first flight-training 
class for women. In 1974, she was one of six 
women to earn her wings, and in 1975 she be-
came the first female Naval Aviator to fly a 
jet attack aircraft. 
In July 1990, Captain Mariner was named 
commander of Navy Tactical Electronic 
Warfare Squadron 34 at Naval Air Station 
Point Mugu in Ventura County, California. 
The unit was 30 percent female and made 
Captain Mariner the first woman to com-
mand an operational air squadron, even 
though women were still barred from flying 
combat missions. Captain Mariner became a 
passionate advocate for women in the mili-
tary, leading the Women Military Aviators 
and working with Congress and the Defense 
Department 
to 
lift 
restrictions 
barring 
women from flying in combat. 
She attended the National War College in 
Washington, DC., earning a master’s degree 
in national security strategy and served on 
the staff of the Joint Chiefs at the Pentagon, 
and a professor of joint military studies at 
the National War College. Captain Mariner 
retired from the Navy in 1997 and moved to 
Tennessee with her husband Commander 
Tommy Mariner and her daughter Emmalee. 
During her Navy career, Captain Mariner 
logged 17 landings on aircraft carriers and 
more than 3500 flight hours in 15 different 
aircraft. In retirement, she continued her 
service in her community as a resident 
scholar in the University of Tennessee’s Cen-
ter for the Study of War and Society and 
taught military history in UT’s history de-
partment for 15 years. 
Captain Mariner passed away from Ovarian 
Cancer on January 24, 2019, in Knoxville, 
Tennessee. In honor of Captain Mariner, the 
United States Navy conducted its first all-fe-
male flyover at the funeral service for Cap-
tain Mariner on Saturday, February 2, 2019, 
in Maynardville, Tennessee. In July 2021, a 
panel of Ventura County members of the 
Armed 
Forces, 
veterans, 
and 
military 
spouses recommended that the Ventura Med-
ical Center be named in honor of Captain 
Rosemary Bryant Mariner. 
In a recent report, the VA Advisory Com-
mittee on Women Veterans recommended in-
clusive naming of VA facilities ‘‘to dem-
onstrate to women veterans that their serv-
ice matters.’’ While VA has concurred with 
the recommendation, it is the responsibility 
of Congress to pass legislation to actually 
name these facilities. 
The Chairwoman of the Women Veterans 
Task Force has helped identify disparities in 
access to care and benefits, and, where nec-
essary, introduced, advocated for, and passed 
legislation that fixes those gaps. Naming 
new or undedicated facilities for women vet-
erans would be a symbolic step to show our 
appreciation for the great courage, dedica-
tion, and sacrifice that these veterans have 
demonstrated in defense of our Nation. 
Please join me in honoring the incredible 
life of Captain Rosemary Bryant Mariner by 
co-sponsoring this bill and signing onto the 
letter of support to the Senate Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee, a requirement to move the 
bill forward. 
Thank you for your support of America’s 
disabled veterans and their survivors. If you 
have any concerns, please do not hesitate to

Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
wholeheartedly support this bill, I en-
courage all of my colleagues to do the 
same, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7698, a bill to rename the 
VA outpatient clinic in Ventura, Cali-
fornia, the Captain Rosemary Bryant 
Mariner Outpatient Clinic. 
Captain Mariner was a trailblazer for 
women in military aviation. She was 
born in Texas and grew up in San 
Diego, California. Her mother was a 
Navy nurse, and her father was a mili-
tary pilot. She grew up watching 
planes take off from Naval Air Station 
Miramar, which inspired her to save up 
for flying lessons. 
In 1972, when she was just 19 years 
old, she became the first woman to 
graduate 
from 
Purdue 
University’s 
aeronautical program. She then joined 
the Navy and was selected as one of the 
first eight women to enter pilot train-
ing. In 1974, she became one of the first 
six women to earn their naval aviator 
pilot’s wings. 
She went on to become one of the 
first female aviators to fly the A–4 
Skyhawk fighter aircraft, the first 
woman to fly the A–7 Corsair strike 
aircraft, the first female aviator to be 
assigned to an aircraft carrier, and the 
first woman to command an aviation 
squadron in the Navy. 
She commanded a tactical electronic 
warfare squadron during the first Gulf 
war. After that, she was one of the first 
women in the Navy to be promoted to 
captain. She retired in 1997 after 24 
years of military service with over 
3,500 flight hours. Her funeral in 2019 
was accompanied by the first all-fe-
male pilot flyover. 
Captain Mariner’s contributions to 
the U.S. military and the Nation were 
truly remarkable. She set a lasting ex-
ample for women in the Navy, whose 
ranks will include, as of Wednesday, 
my own granddaughter, which I am 
very proud of, even though I am still 
having trouble with the Navy over the 
Marines thing. 
Madam Speaker, I am so proud to 
support this bill, I am grateful to Con-
gresswoman BROWNLEY for sponsoring 
it, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I want to say I appreciate the rank-
ing member’s mentioning of his daugh-
ter and the connection with today’s ac-
tion. I also extend my pride, and I feel 
his pride. We also are thankful for his 
daughter’s service. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 7 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
BROWNLEY), my good friend and the 
chairwoman of the Subcommittee on 
Health. She is the author of H.R. 7698, 
a vital piece of legislation. 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman of the committee 
and the ranking member for being so 
supportive of this bill. I also thank 
Speaker PELOSI and Majority Leader 
HOYER, and every member of the Cali-
fornia delegation, for their support. 
As the chair and ranking member 
mentioned, my bill, H.R. 7698, will 
name the new VA outpatient clinic in 
Ventura County after Captain Rose-
mary Bryant Mariner. 
This new VA clinic has been a long 
time in the making. Since I was elect-
ed to Congress, I have been working to 
expand VA services in Ventura County 
to ensure that our veterans have access 
to the timely and quality care that 
they have earned and deserve. 
When I first came to Congress, it was 
clear that Ventura County veterans 
were being deeply underserved by the 
undersized and understaffed local VA 
clinic, so I immediately set out to 
work to correct the situation. 
While I was able to secure improve-
ments to the facility that existed, it

was clear that the large veteran popu-
lation in our region needed a much 
larger facility and one run by VA per-
sonnel, 
personnel 
that 
understood 
them and understood their experiences. 
That was critically important. 
Although the road to passing legisla-
tion to authorize a new facility was 
long, in 2017, my legislation was signed 
into law. This new clinic will be better 
equipped 
to 
deliver 
high-quality 
healthcare to a growing community of 
veterans living in Ventura County and 
in the area. 
Importantly, the new clinic will have 
VA personnel and will offer expanded 
services and more specialty care, like 
dental care, physical therapy, rehabili-
tation services, optometry, audiology, 
podiatry, cardiology, and other serv-
ices. 
Getting the new facility open has 
been my highest priority in Congress, 
and I am very, very excited that it will 
be opening next Tuesday, September 
27. 
I am very grateful for the work of all 
the dedicated VA personnel in our re-
gion, who have been laser focused on 
getting this new facility opened and 
hiring all the necessary staff it needs. 
b 1830 
Already, the reviews from local vet-
erans who have toured the new facility 
have been very positive. I am hopeful 
that as veterans begin to get care at 
the facility, it will be truly trans-
formative in their lives. 
As chair of the Women Veterans 
Task Force, I am also especially 
pleased that the new clinic will be one 
of the first VA clinics in the country, 
and the very first in the greater Los 
Angeles area, with a women-only en-
trance. 
Since the Revolutionary War, mil-
lions of women have served in the 
Armed Forces of the United States. 
However, when they leave the military, 
they are often invisible, and far too 
many women leave military service 
with the scars of military sexual trau-
ma. The women-only entrance will en-
sure that our women veterans can feel 
safe and welcomed and, hopefully, 
never feel discouraged from seeking 
the care they need. 
While opening this clinic has been 
my highest priority, I also believe that 
naming the clinic will provide us with 
yet another opportunity to recognize 
the service and sacrifice of our women 
veterans. 
Women comprise the fastest growing 
and most diverse demographic in both 
the military and veteran populations. 
Through my work in Congress, I am 
constantly reminded that women are 
the most visible while serving and the 
most invisible when they return to ci-
vilian life. This is symbolized, sadly, by 
the lack of VA facilities named after 
women veterans. In fact, of the 1,255 
VA healthcare facilities, only two fa-
cilities have been named in honor of 
women veterans—only two. 
To address this, I convened a local 
citizens advisory panel comprised of 
veterans and community leaders to se-
lect a woman veteran for whom we 
could name the new clinic, and they se-
lected Captain Rosemary Bryant Mar-
iner. 
Captain Mariner, a former resident of 
Ventura County, joined the Navy in 
1973, where she became a member of 
the Navy’s first flight training class for 
women. In 1974, she was one of six 
women to earn her wings and, the fol-
lowing year, became the first female 
naval aviator to fly a jet attack air-
craft. 
Captain Mariner was named com-
mander of the Naval Tactical Elec-
tronic Warfare Squadron 34 at Naval 
Air Station Point Mugu in Ventura 
County, California. The unit was 30 
percent female and made Captain Mar-
iner the first woman to command an 
operational air squadron. 
Throughout her career, Captain Mar-
iner was a passionate advocate for 
women in the military, leading the 
Women Military Aviators and working 
with Congress and the Department of 
Defense to lift restrictions barring 
women from flying in combat. 
I could not be more pleased that the 
House is taking up my bill to honor 
Captain Rosemary Bryant Mariner. 
This bill and this clinic send a criti-
cally important message to our women 
veterans, and that is: We see you. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
the bill. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I encour-
age my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
all of my colleagues to join me in pass-
ing H.R. 7698, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7698. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

COLONEL CHARLES AND JOANNE 
POWELL DEPARTMENT OF VET-
ERANS AFFAIRS CLINIC 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 2771) to designate the commu-
nity-based outpatient clinic of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs in San 
Angelo, Texas, as the ‘‘Colonel Charles 
and JoAnne Powell Department of Vet-
erans Affairs Clinic’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2771 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Colonel Charles Powell and his wife, 
Mrs. JoAnne Powell, served the community 
of San Angelo, Texas, with character and 
dignity. 
(2) Colonel Powell served as the base com-
mander of Goodfellow Air Force Base from 
1980 to 1984. 
(3) When the Powells moved to San Angelo, 
Charles was ordered to help Goodfellow avoid 
closure and the displacement of many mem-
bers of the Armed Forces from the commu-
nity they had grown to love. 
(4) The impact of Charles’ career can still 
be felt today at Goodfellow Air Force Base, 
as it serves as a training school for thou-
sands of members from every Armed Force 
to train in cryptology, intelligence, and fire-
fighting. 
(5) JoAnne assisted thousands of constitu-
ents in the district offices of Representatives 
Tom Loeffler, Lamar Smith, K. Michael Con-
away, and August Pfluger. 
(6) One of the several duties JoAnne spear-
headed was the annual process of nomina-
tions to the military service academies, 
which was always a year-round process for 
her. 
(7) With JoAnne’s assistance, many of the 
young men and women of the 11th congres-
sional district of Texas went on to serve the 
United States and attend one of the military 
service academies. 
(8) In addition, JoAnne was a fierce advo-
cate of veterans and helped thousands of in-
dividuals gain access to the veterans benefits 
they rightfully earned. 
(9) JoAnne’s compassion and dedication 
helped make the Concho Valley a better 
place. 
SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF COMMUNITY-BASED 
OUTPATIENT CLINIC OF DEPART-
MENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS IN SAN 
ANGELO, TEXAS. 
(a) DESIGNATION.—The community-based 
outpatient clinic of the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs in San Angelo, Texas, shall 
after the date of the enactment of this Act 
be known and designated as the ‘‘Colonel 
Charles and JoAnne Powell Department of 
Veterans Affairs Clinic’’ or the ‘‘Colonel 
Charles and JoAnne Powell VA Clinic’’. 
(b) REFERENCE.—Any reference in any law, 
regulation, map, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the commu-
nity-based outpatient clinic referred to in 
subsection (a) shall be considered to be a ref-
erence to the Colonel Charles and JoAnne 
Powell Department of Veterans Affairs Clin-
ic. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on S. 2771. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize 
the lives of Colonel Charles and Jo-
Anne Powell, both of whom served the 
community of San Angelo, Texas, and 
advocated for veterans for many years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7943 
September 19, 2022 
I thank Senator JOHN CORNYN and 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
PFLUGER) for putting forward this leg-
islation, which will rename the San 
Antonio VA clinic in Colonel and Mrs. 
Powell’s honor. 
Colonel Powell served as base com-
mander of Goodfellow Air Force Base 
in San Angelo from 1980 to 1984. He was 
instrumental in helping to avoid clo-
sure of the base, which today serves as 
a school for thousands of servicemem-
bers training to be cryptologists, intel-
ligence officers, and military fire-
fighters. 
Mrs. Powell also lived a life devoted 
to public service as district manager to 
four separate Members of Congress. In 
this role, Mrs. Powell encouraged many 
young men and women in the 11th Con-
gressional District of Texas to serve in 
the United States military and helped 
numerous veterans access the VA bene-
fits they rightfully earned. 
S. 2771 and its companion bill, H.R. 
4328, are cosponsored by nearly 40 
Members of Congress, Democrat and 
Republican, and the legislation has the 
support of The American Legion, Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled 
American Veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I include letters of 
support from these Members and orga-
nizations for the RECORD. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, February 10, 2022.

DEAR
CHAIRMAN
TESTER, 
CHAIRMAN 
TAKANO, 
RANKING
MEMBER
MORAN, 
AND 
RANKING MEMBER BOST: We are writing to ex-
press our support to name the Veterans Af-
fairs community-based outpatient clinic in 
San Angelo, Texas, the ‘‘Colonel Charles and 
JoAnne Powell VA Clinic’’. 
Colonel Charles Powell served 30 years in 
the U.S. Air Force and was Commander of 
the 17th Training Wing at Goodfellow Air 
Force Base from 1980 until retiring in 1984. 
Only six months after his graduation from 
the U.S. Naval Academy, he married JoAnne, 
who soon became a force of her own in the 
military and veterans’ communities. To-
gether, they settled in San Angelo for 
Charles’s final assignment at Goodfellow 
AFB. The two saved Goodfellow from closure 
and helped the base become a technical 
training center. 
During her husband’s two deployments in 
Vietnam and during his time at Goodfellow, 
JoAnne revived the Officer Wives Club and 
started a Christmas Bazaar program that is 
ongoing today. Additionally, she was an ac-
tive volunteer for a program that supported 
MIA and POW families, the Red Cross, and 
various other charitable causes. 
Beyond these acts of service, JoAnne spent 
37 years as a district staffer for four Mem-
bers of Congress in the San Angelo district. 
She is believed to have provided casework 
assistance to thousands of service members 
and veterans and helped hundreds of district 
students navigate service academy selec-
tions and receive appointments. Although 
Charles passed away on July 2, 2020, JoAnne 
upheld Charles’ legacy by staying active in 
the community, eventually being honored as 
a Lifetime Hero in the community for her 
contributions to the military community. 
On March 24, 2021, JoAnne Powell passed 
away. Throughout Charles’ and JoAnne’s life 
together, they embodied the true meaning of 
selflessness, patience, and perseverance. The 
countless hours the Powells dedicated to 
changing the lives of their neighbors and 
being a light in their community have left a 
lasting impact on West Texas. We would be 
grateful for your support of this effort and 
hope that the Senate and the House Commit-
tees on Veterans’ Affairs will give it its 
prompt consideration.

The American Legion, the Nation’s largest

CHAIRMAN
MARK
TAKANO
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER MIKE BOST: On the behalf of Dis-
abled American Veterans, Department of 
Texas, I am honored to extend my support to 
the efforts of Congressman August Pfluger 
and the members of Congress from Texas to 
rename The Department of Veterans Affairs 
outpatient clinic in San Angelo, Texas, to 
the Colonel Charles and JoAnne Powell VA 
Clinic’’. 
Colonel Powell was a graduate of the 
United States Naval Academy and served a 
distinguished 30 year career in the Air Force, 
including Commander of Goodfellow Air 
Base in San Angelo, Texas. 
Mrs. Colonel Powell was in the Air Force 
and was a dedicated Military wife and force 
in her own right, active in the Officers Wives 
Club for 30 years. She was a voice for Vet-
erans and served 37 years as District Man-
ager to four members of Congress. 
The bill, Colonel Charles and JoAnne Pow-
ell VA Clinic, would rename the VA Clinic in 
San Angelo, Texas, to Honor the lives of 
these two individuals. The Powells were be-
loved figures in their adopted hometown who 
spent their lifetime serving their country 
and community with honor and dedication. 
Sincerely, 
TERESA JOHNIKEN, 
Adjutant/Treasurer, 
DAV Department of Texas. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I sup-
port naming VA’s community-based

in Colonel Charles and Mrs. JoAnne 
Powell’s honor, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
S. 2771. This bill names the VA commu-
nity-based outpatient clinic, or CBOC,

three decades in the Air Force. In that 
time, he deployed twice to Vietnam, 
served as commander of Goodfellow Air 
Force Base in San Angelo, and eventu-
ally attained the rank of colonel. 
While not a veteran herself, his wife, 
JoAnne Powell, was, as the Disabled 
American 
Veterans, 
Department 
of 
Texas, put it, a force all her own. Dur-
ing her husband’s time as commanding 
officer of Goodfellow, she revived the 
Officers Wives Club, started a Christ-
mas bazaar program that continues to 
this day, supported efforts to prevent 
the base from closing, and actively vol-
unteered for the local charities and 
helped families of servicemembers who 
were prisoners of war or missing in ac-
tion. 
For her efforts, she was honored at 
the Goodfellow Air Force Base with a 
lifetime achievement award. JoAnne 
also spent almost 40 years working for 
her local Congressmen, helping thou-
sands of servicemembers, veterans, and 
military families. 
This bill fulfills the committee’s 
naming criteria. It has the full support 
of the Texas congressional delegation, 
local VSOs, and the veteran commu-
nity in and around San Angelo. 
I particularly recognize the hard 
work and leadership of the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER), my friend, 
and the Senate sponsor of this bill, 
Senator CORNYN. They have been re-
lentless in their advocacy for the bill 
so that Charles and JoAnne’s incred-
ible legacy will finally receive the rec-
ognition it deserves. I thank them 
both. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bill today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleagues, the ranking 
member and the chairman, for bringing 
this bill to the floor. 
I rise today in support of my bill to 
rename the veterans community-based 
outpatient clinic in San Angelo, Texas, 
the Colonel Charles and JoAnne Powell 
VA Clinic. 
I cannot think of two people more de-
serving of this honor than Colonel 
Charles and JoAnne Powell. They are 
both true American heroes who, for 
their entire lives, dedicated their serv-
ice to this country through a distin-
guished career not only in the U.S. Air 
Force but later in civilian life when 
they became two of the most ardent 
and fervent leaders for military and 
veterans issues. 
They shared a love story not only be-
tween themselves but also for this 
country. Colonel Charles and JoAnne 
Powell met in preschool in Nashville, 
Arkansas. They graduated high school 
together, and they were married in 1954 
after Charles graduated from the U.S. 
Naval Academy and then joined the Air 
Force. No matter where Charles’ mis-
sions took them around the world to 
different locations, JoAnne was right 
there, serving alongside him. 
Colonel Powell and JoAnne first flew 
into San Angelo in 1980, and he became 
the base commander of Goodfellow and 
JoAnne the honorary first lady. Their 
mission was daunting, as they were 
tasked with saving Goodfellow, which 
was slated for closure. Not only did 
they immediately spring into action to 
save the base, but they built a lasting 
partnership that lasts today between 
the community and the base, com-
pletely converting the base mission 
into one of a premier intelligence, sur-
veillance, 
reconnaissance, 
and 
fire 
training installation for every branch 
of the U.S. military. 
After Charles retired, they settled in 
San Angelo, and their legacy has left 
over 360,000 graduates from Goodfellow 
Air Force Base that have joined all 
branches and all intelligence agencies, 
including not just the military but the 
CIA, DIA, FBI, NSA, and more. 
Thankfully, their professional serv-
ice has made this country better, but it 
is there where they decided to plant 
their roots and set to work in their 
community, making it a better place. 
In addition to her service as a mili-
tary spouse, JoAnne Powell gave of 
herself through immeasurable commu-
nity involvement on countless boards 
and civic organizations. Through her 
35-year career as a congressional liai-
son for the 11th District, she worked 
for 
Representatives 
Tom 
Loeffler, 
Lamar Smith, Mike Conaway, and, 
lastly, myself. 
She served thousands of veterans in 
this position. She helped in any way 
she possibly could. Not only did she 
spearhead the annual process of nomi-
nating young men and women to the 
service academies, which was a year- 
round position for both her and Charles 
Powell, but she also achieved what I 
think is probably more lasting in help-
ing those cadets and those midshipmen 
go through the academies, including 
myself, which was probably her most 
generous contribution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SCHRIER). The time of the gentleman 
has expired. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. 
PFLUGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Charles and JoAnne Powell were a per-
fect team, and they supported one an-
other as they completed their missions 
of life with flying colors. Together, 
they raised an exceptional daughter, 
Terri, and adored their two wonderful 
grandchildren. 
I am thrilled today to be able to 
honor them, to honor their service, the 
impact that they had in the Concho 
Valley, the impact that they had on so 
many veterans, and the impact that 
they had on our military with the nam-
ing of the Charles and JoAnne Powell 
VA Clinic. 
I thank the chairman and ranking 
member and the entire Texas delega-
tion and your staffs for helping make 
this a reality. Obviously, I thank 
Charles and JoAnne Powell for their 
love of this country, which is a legacy 
that I think all of us could stand to 
learn from. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, in clos-
ing, I encourage all of my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
all of my colleagues to join me in pass-
ing S. 2771, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 2771. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
PERSONS WHO COMMIT, THREAT-
EN 
TO 
COMMIT, 
OR 
SUPPORT 
TERRORISM—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–145) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
STRICKLAND) laid before the House the 
following message from the President 
of the United States; which was read 
and, together with the accompanying 
papers, referred to the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and ordered to be print-
ed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to per-
sons who commit, threaten to commit, 
or support terrorism declared in Execu-
tive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001, 
as amended, is to continue in effect be-
yond September 23, 2022. 
The crisis constituted by the grave 
acts of terrorism and threats of ter-
rorism committed by foreign terror-
ists, including the terrorist attacks on 
September 11, 2001, in New York and 
Pennsylvania and against the Pen-
tagon, and the continuing and imme-
diate threat of further attacks on 
United States nationals or the United 
States that led to the declaration of a 
national emergency on September 23, 
2001, has not been resolved. This crisis 
continues to pose an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity, foreign policy, and economy of 
the United States. Therefore, I have de-
termined that it is necessary to con-
tinue the national emergency declared 
in Executive Order 13224, as amended, 
with respect to persons who commit, 
threaten to commit, or support ter-
rorism. 
JOSEPH R. BIDEN, Jr.
THE WHITE HOUSE, September 19, 2022. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE INFLATION 
REDUCTION ACT 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the Inflation Re-
duction Act. This law not only makes a 
massive $370 billion climate and energy 
investment nationwide, but it could 
generate up to 5 million new clean en-
ergy jobs across America. 
Madam Speaker, Texas is number one 
in wind energy and number two in 
solar energy. Texas led all States in 
overall renewable energy production in 
the first quarter of 2022. There are 
nearly 240,000 Texas workers in the 
clean energy industry. 
This number will soon increase be-
cause of the estimated $66 billion in-
vestment in Texas’ clean power indus-
try between now and 2030. More Texas 
workers will be able to gain employ-
ment across the solar, wind, and other 
clean energy industries. 
President Biden and House Demo-
crats are not only fighting the climate 
crisis, but we are making sure workers 
can transition into good-paying clean 
energy jobs. We are putting people over 
politics, and it is about jobs, jobs, and 
more jobs. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE THUNDERBOLT 
FIRE DEPARTMENT 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
heroism of the Thunderbolt Fire De-
partment for its swift and effective re-
sponse after Savannah Bananas pitcher 
Bill Lee collapsed while warming up. 
Bill ‘‘Spaceman’’ Lee is a legendary 
pitcher, a Boston Red Sox Hall of 
Famer, and a notorious personality in 
Major League Baseball. He is beloved 
by his community. Teammates and col-
leagues use words like ‘‘infectious,’’ 
‘‘unique,’’ and ‘‘living legend’’ to de-
scribe him. 
His commitment to the great Amer-
ican pastime is lifelong, having contin-
ued to pitch for 40 years after the end 
of his career in the major leagues. 
While warming up for a Savannah 
Bananas game, Bill, unfortunately, suf-
fered from a sudden cardiac episode 
that rendered him unconscious and un-
able to breathe. The Thunderbolt Fire 
Department reacted immediately, how-
ever, and Bill was quickly resuscitated 
and in a stable condition when he was 
transferred to a local hospital. 
Bill is already well on his way to a 
full and speedy recovery and is today 
in great spirits, waiting for his next 
game. 
We have the Thunderbolt Fire De-
partment’s 
timely 
intervention 
to 
thank for saving this baseball legend’s 
life, and I take this opportunity to rec-
ognize them today. 
f 
REAUTHORIZING THE READ ACT 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 7240 to reauthorize the Rein-
forcing Education Accountability in 
Development Act, or the READ Act. 
I thank my good friend, Chairwoman 
KAREN BASS, for leading this bipartisan 
legislation and Chairman MEEKS and 
the Speaker for moving it to the floor. 
Our dear friend and a great leader, 
Chairwoman NITA LOWEY, who preceded 
me as chair of the Subcommittee on 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs, led the charge to pass the 
READ Act in 2017. I saw her over this 
weekend, and she was so excited that 
this bill was coming to the floor. 
The READ Act coordinates and am-
plifies U.S. efforts to support basic edu-
cation abroad. Over 58 million children 
still cannot go to school around the 
world, more than half are girls, and 
COVID–19 disrupted learning for hun-
dreds of millions of kids, creating huge 
challenges for meeting the sustainable 
development goal of providing a qual-
ity education for all kids by 2030. 
I was proud to include in the fiscal 
year 2023 House SFOPS appropriations 
bill $985 million for international basic 
education, $35 million above last year’s 
enacted level and $291.6 million above 
the President’s budget request. The 
READ Act authorization will ensure 
that these resources will deliver the 
most value for kids around the world. 
f 
INCREASING ILLEGAL CROSSINGS 
AND DECREASING DEPORTATIONS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
bring attention to the American people 
of what should be the number one story 
in every newspaper in the country to-
morrow, but we know they won’t even 
cover it. 
Today were released the encounters 
and releases at the southern border for 
August—just shy of 140,000 people. By

comparison, 2 years ago in August of 
the prior administration, it was 13,000. 
So, in 2 years, we have gone from 13,000 
to 140,000. 
That also means a corresponding in-
crease in the amount of fentanyl cross-
ing the border, and we all know that, 
right now, we have well over 100,000 il-
legal drug deaths in America, and of 
those 100,000, the vast majority contain 
fentanyl. 
I also point out that, right now, the 
deportations are about one quarter per 
day as to what they were for people 
committing crimes 2 years ago. 
I want the American people to wake 
up and demand something serious be 
done on the border, and I beg the press 
corps to talk about the new August 
numbers for people crossing here ille-
gally. 
f 
b 1945 
FISCAL YEAR 2023 COMMUNITY 
PROJECT FUNDING 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my profound support 
for the work of the House Appropria-
tions Committee and highlight the in-
clusion of the Fiscal Year 2023 Commu-
nity Project Funding requests for Indi-
ana’s First Congressional District. 
I am grateful for the ability to col-
laborate with local units of govern-
ment, nonprofit organizations, and in-
stitutions of higher education to effec-
tively advocate in a transparent fash-
ion for their eligible projects. 
Notably, the House-approved legisla-
tion includes funding for vital eco-
nomic and transportation assets in 
Northwest Indiana, including the Gary/ 
Chicago 
International 
Airport, 
the 
Burns Waterway Small Boat Harbor in 
Portage, and shoreline restoration ef-
forts for Mount Baldy within the Indi-
ana Dunes National Park. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with all my colleagues to complete our 
constitutional work to fund govern-
ment and advance the needs of our dis-
tricts. 
f 
IMMIGRATION HYPOCRISY 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, over 
the past 21 months under the Biden ad-
ministration, border States and cities 
such as McAllen, Texas and Yuma, Ari-
zona, have seen hundreds of thousands 
of illegal immigrants enter their cities 
under these reckless border policies. 
I, along with 59 Republicans, intro-
duced 
H.R. 
6592, 
the 
Immigration 
Transparency and Notification Act, to 
provide for transparency of these se-
cret immigration flights conducted by 
the Biden administration into my 
hometown 
and 
rural 
towns 
across 
America. 
Thousands of illegals were flown into 
areas across the country with no notice 
or coordination, yet no one flinched; no 
mainstream media attention; no out-
rage from the White House. 
Now that Chicago, D.C., and Martha’s 
Vineyard have joined the party and 
been introduced to open border policy, 
somehow, now this is a national trag-
edy and unacceptable. This is hypoc-
risy at its highest. 
f 
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
any extraneous material on the subject 
of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to begin the discussion that I 
think we will continue in days to come 
and even into the new year, and that is 
to discuss the Congressional Black 
Caucus’ accomplishments in this Con-
gress, the 117th. 
By its very nature, the tenure and 
the breadth and depth of members of 
the Congressional Black Caucus, I be-
lieve that we can be talking for a very 
long time, and so this will probably be 
a continuum to tell the American peo-
ple how we have been helping to ensure 
that they have a better quality of life. 
I am very proud to join with the 
chairwoman of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, JOYCE BEATTY, who has led us, 
in the 117th Congress, to be instru-
mental in the lives of intergenerations, 
across generational lines, and to ensure 
that those who are at the beginning of 
life, and those at the end of life, and 
those in between raising their families, 
know that the Congressional Black 
Caucus is standing with them. 
One particularly unique example of 
that is, of course, the HBCU conference 
that is going on this week, where 
HBCUs are coming from all over the 
country. And it is interesting to be 
able to associate, not only our col-
league, ALMA ADAMS, as the chair of 
the HBCU Caucus, of which I am a 
member and many of our colleagues 
are members, including I see on the 
floor, Chairman SCOTT. 
Under his leadership, the HBCUs 
have gotten more money—than I be-
lieve in the history of many of our ten-
ure here in the United States Con-
gress—working with President Biden. 
This is the leadership of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus. 
So let me quickly begin my com-
ments, and I will look forward to yield-
ing to my friends who are here, includ-
ing my colleague and friend from Lou-
isiana, Mr. TROY CARTER, Congressman 
CARTER, who is the new vice chair of 
the Congressional Children’s Caucus. 
And I know that we are looking for-
ward to many days of action on behalf 
of the children of America and on be-
half of children of color and African- 
American children. 
Members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus strongly support the Presi-
dent’s goal of passing legislation that 
will significantly reduce healthcare 
costs for all Americans. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will sig-
nificantly reduce, and has significantly 
reduced, prescription drug costs and 
expanded healthcare coverage for mil-
lions of Black Americans, relieving fi-
nancial strains on individuals and fam-
ilies. 
What I think is most important is 
the work that many of us on the Con-
gressional Black Caucus did, including 
the work that I advocated with our 
whip, 
JIM
CLYBURN, 
and 
Senator 
WARNOCK. We were on it for the $35 cap 
on insulin, along with our colleagues. 
It was driven and inspired by members 
of the Congressional Black Caucus to 
ensure that insulin, which now is one 
of the driving forces of creating a bet-
ter quality of life for our seniors—you 
can say that the Congressional Black 
Caucus was intimately involved in 
that. 
We were intimately involved in en-
suring that it has a fair response to cli-
mate change around the issue of bring-
ing down the cost of energy for our 
families in America. And of course, 
that impacts Black families. 
This new law will help bring down en-
ergy costs for millions of Black Ameri-
cans, and it includes very strong pro-
tections and programs to promote envi-
ronmental justice. 
Of course, we worked extensively on 
the bipartisan infrastructure law. That 
was, of course, a very pivotal role for 
those of us in the Congressional Black 
Caucus. Black, Hispanic, Asian Amer-
ican, Pacific Islander, Native Ameri-
cans, especially those who reside in 
urban communities, are more likely to 
be negatively impacted by pollution. 
Black people are almost three times 
more likely to die from asthma-related 
causes than their White counterparts. 
And, of course, the Congressional 
Black Caucus led in negotiations to as-
sure that this was a balanced bill. 
In particular, my constituents have 
already seen the magnificent results of 
the once-in-a-generation piece of legis-
lation. Houston METRO was granted a 
$21 million grant to buy battery-pow-
ered electric buses, and it has helped it 
move to the next level, next generation 
of rapid transit, and plans to go to the 
airports, both Hobby and Bush Inter-
continental, in my district, with bipar-
tisan infrastructure dollars. 
And as a hurricane-prone commu-
nity, as many of the Gulf States are, 
from Louisiana to Texas and Mis-
sissippi, the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill will help us work on those flood-

prone areas and ensure the safety and 
life of so many. 
I am excited about how the Congres-
sional Black Caucus gravitated around 
the Juneteenth legislation, the first 
bill in almost 40 years that created a 
Federal holiday which was signed on 
June 17, 2021. I am very pleased to be 
the first Member to introduce legisla-
tion to ensure that there was a holiday 
after 10 years of introducing the resolu-
tions, and the culmination of all of 
these years, and particularly, the cul-
mination of Opal Lee, who came on a 
hot day in 2019, and brought us a mil-
lion petitions—she was in her nine-
ties—to ensure that Juneteenth could 
become a Federal holiday. 
Her work in getting all those peti-
tions, the introduction of the legisla-
tion that I was proud to introduce, and 
ultimately presiding over the floor—all 
of the members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus were strong proponents 
of this, and we could not have done it 
without their leadership and urgency. 
Many of you know that Juneteenth 
represents two more years of slavery 
for those west of the Mississippi, until 
General Granger came with Order 
Number 15 to announce that the slaves 
were free, because the South had not 
adhered to the 1863 Emancipation Proc-
lamation. So he came to Galveston, 
Texas, General Granger, announcing 
the end of the Civil War and the free-
dom of the last Americans enslaved in 
the Confederate States. 
Since the 1800s, Juneteenth has been 
an important commemoration to Afri-
can Americans. Even as Frederick 
Douglass and W.E.B. Du Bois reminded 
us that—Frederick Douglass, in par-
ticular—there is no power with strug-
gle. And, of course, W.E.B. Du Bois 
talked to us about ‘‘The Talented 
Tenth.’’ 
That means that the work of the 
Congressional Black Caucus is keen, 
and we are keen to make sure that the 
work that is done continues to empha-
size what is best for them. 
Let me also take note of the support 
of African Americans in helping to as-
sure—and 
the 
Congressional 
Black 
Caucus, with the leadership of Chair-
woman BEATTY, and working with the 
Judiciary Committee, the chairman of 
the 
full 
committee, 
NADLER, 
sub-
committee, COHEN and myself, and the 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus on the Judiciary Committee, 
we were able to mark up for the first 
time in history, H.R. 40, the Commis-
sion to Study and Develop Reparations 
Proposals for African Americans Act. 
What a powerful experience, first, 
with two hearings, bringing people 
from all over, including the author and 
proponent of the 1619 Project, and lead-
ers and scholars who understood that 
this is simply restoration and repair, 
and this must be created as a commis-
sion by law, by vote, or executive 
order. 
In addition, glad to have the help of 
the Congressional Black Caucus on the 
passage of the Violence Against Women 
Act, a reauthorization act that I intro-
duced. And in it were many aspects of 
work or language for people of color for 
the first time; training for young men 
and boys on how to deal with the issue 
of violence, and also the question of 
rape and how we should be working on 
that. 
We followed with massive work on 
education, as I indicated, doing more 
for primary and secondary education 
than could ever be imagined, under the 
leadership of Chairman BOBBY SCOTT. 
I will conclude my remarks in order 
to yield to my friends. I want to be 
able to say that during the midst of the 
pandemic, there were several things 
that the Congressional Black Caucus 
led on. One, to push testing into our 
community where there was none; to 
push vaccines and vaccinations into 
our community where there were none; 
and to ensure that we focused on lost 
learning and our children who did not 
have access to broadband. 
It was our voices that made it loud 
and clear. Ultimately, broadband ac-
cess has been put more and more into 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill. But 
during the pandemic, it was the voices 
of the Congressional Black Caucus that 
insisted that we do better with respect 
to these children who had no access. 
The stories were large and looming. 
They were frightening, and I am glad 
that our voices continue. 
There are many other litanies of 
issues dealing with climate change, 
dealing with criminal justice reform. It 
was because of us that ultimately we 
introduced the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act, one of two bills named 
after George Floyd. 
Because of all the work we did, with 
KAREN BASS and all the members of the 
CBC, all the work that we did ulti-
mately resulted in an executive order 
that we do know, as indicated by exec-
utive order, that you will have no more 
choke holds, no more no-knocks, and 
more that we hope to put into statu-
tory law. We are excited that the bill 
did include large aspects of the George 
Floyd Justice in Policing Act. 
With that in mind, I am delighted to 
be able to yield to—as I talk further 
about some of these important ele-
ments of the work of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, but I am pleased now to 
yield to the chairman of the House 
Education and Labor Committee so 
that he can evidence the Congressional 
Black Caucus’ 117th Congress accom-
plishments through the works that he 
has done on his committee, the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), 
chairman of the Education and Labor 
Committee. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding, and I thank her for her good 
work. 
Madam Speaker, the people, the 
American people deserve a government 
that puts people over politics and pro-
tects hardworking families, not billion-
aires and special interests. That is 
why, throughout the 117th Congress, 
the House Education and Labor Com-
mittee has advanced legislation that 
meets the needs of students, families, 
workers, and our economy. 
Over the last 2 years, Congressional 
Democrats and the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration 
have 
made 
historic 
progress to rescue the American econ-
omy, create good-paying jobs, get stu-
dents back on track, fight child hun-
ger, and boost access to healthcare. 
Just in the Education and Labor 
Committee, there was a lot that was 
done. We helped create over 10 million 
jobs in our economy since January 
2021: the most jobs in history for 20 
months. We recovered all of the jobs 
lost during the pandemic. We reduced 
unemployment to historically low lev-
els. 
We saved the pensions of over 1 mil-
lion workers, and protected thousands 
of businesses by saving the multiem-
ployer pension fund. 
We delivered the largest one-time 
Federal investment to K–12 education 
in the United States history. And we 
delivered that money and distributed it 
according to the Title I formula where 
poverty is the main factor, meaning 
that the districts that need it the most 
got the most. Those that are tradition-
ally overlooked got more money than 
they have ever gotten before. 
b 2000 
We put money into school lunches so 
that students didn’t go hungry during 
that period of time. We made sure that, 
with that money, the schools could 
open safely, stay open safely, and make 
up for lost learning. During that period 
of time, during the COVID relief bills, 
we had more money for historically 
Black colleges and universities than we 
ever have in history. 
Now, we also made sure that the 
number of Americans without health 
insurance, because of the actions that 
we have taken, is now the lowest it has 
ever been. We have made sure that 
they can get vaccines, and those vac-
cines were distributed equitably. That 
is not always the case. 
We made sure that drug prices were 
down, particularly insulin for seniors, 
no more than $35 per month for insulin. 
A lot of people right now before this 
bill were paying a lot more than that. 
That is just the kind of legislation 
that came through the Education and 
Labor Committee. But House Demo-
crats and the Congressional Black Cau-
cus are committed to continuing this 
historic progress and building back a 
stronger economy for all Americans. 
That is why we passed the bipartisan 
infrastructure law, which not only 
modernized roads, bridges, and water-
ways, but will also create millions of 
good-paying 
jobs 
and 
will 
deliver 
broadband to areas that don’t have 
broadband today. We will invest in 
neighborhoods that were destroyed by 
previous transportation plans going 
right down the middle of African-

American neighborhoods, and we will 
invest in those neighborhoods to try to 
make up for that devastation. 
Moving forward, we are committed to 
committee work, advancing policies 
like the Raise the Wage Act, the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act, the 
Equity and Inclusion Enforcement Act, 
the Strength in Diversity Act, and the 
Rebuild America’s Schools Act to en-
sure that every worker, student, and 
family has the opportunity to succeed. 
We have done a lot. We haven’t fin-
ished. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Texas for her leadership 
and the opportunity to remind the 
American public of what we have al-
ready accomplished. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for his remarks. 
It is clear that there is a new day on 
the 
Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
Labor. That committee, led by Chair-
man SCOTT, has shown itself to be the 
people’s committee, and I am delighted 
that his longstanding membership with 
the Congressional Black Caucus has 
shown that his work is for all of Amer-
ica. But through the Congressional 
Black Caucus he has helped and ele-
vated families who have suffered be-
cause of racial discrimination and be-
cause of economic inequities. He has 
been focused. 
Certainly, I credit him again with 
the work that has been done on HBCUs. 
I can assure you, with HBCUs in Texas, 
everywhere I go, they are taking note 
of the increased funding that has al-
lowed them to do issues or handle mat-
ters 
with 
physical 
infrastructure, 
scholarship, the new Pell grant execu-
tive order, student loan executive order 
that is allowing for those with Pell 
grant loans making $120,000 to get 
$20,000 in relief. The Congressional 
Black Caucus worked extensively to 
ensure that those people with student 
loans were not forgotten. 
Let me say it again. We work with-
out ceasing to ensure that individuals 
who were overburdened with student 
loans, couldn’t get down payments for 
housing and other matters for their 
quality of life—we were ensuring that 
we were in the front, if you will, to 
continue to advocate for student loan 
reduction. 
Let me just say this, as I prepare to 
yield to my dear friend on the floor 
here. 
As poet Langston Hughes reminds us, 
in his famous poem ‘‘Mother to Son,’’ 
life in America for African Americans 
‘‘ain’t been no crystal stair.’’ 
The goodness of this message is that 
in spite of it all, African Americans 
have put on uniforms and fought their 
battles on behalf of this Nation. Afri-
can Americans are great lovers of this 
country, and they are great patriots. 
African Americans have worked in 
every level of government. They have, 
of course, been individuals who have 
worked, as some will say, at the bot-
tom of the totem pole, meaning every 
manner of work they have done. 
There have been African Americans 
who were enslaved who helped build 
the White House and the very building 
that we are in, never to hold the anger 
of their station in life but continue to 
work to insist on a better quality of 
life for their families. 
It is very much important to take 
note of the bills that we have been able 
to do as individual Members of Con-
gress. 
I am just going to cite H.R. 7566, 
stops human trafficking in schools, 
that I introduced; working with an 
amendment to the Workforce Innova-
tion bill; ensuring HBCU’s full access 
to job skills training; amendment to 
H.R. 8294, the Transportation, Housing, 
and Urban Development appropriations 
bill to ensure that HBCUs had specific 
work—it supports the work of the Na-
tional Institute of Food and Agri-
culture by increasing the funding by $2 
million. 
Then I will finish more deeply on 
H.R. 40. That bill is much exhibited, as 
I have been on the floor before, with 
this slave and his back and the welts 
on his back from a whip. This was the 
life of slavery in America. 
I just read recently of Germany’s re-
sponse to aging holocaust victims, 
which I applaud, providing millions of 
dollars to respond to their pain, just 
recently. In the course of the commis-
sion to study slavery and develop rep-
aration proposals, it would give Amer-
ica a moment of healing. We have been 
hearing this discussion across the Na-
tion and across the world, most re-
cently, of course, in the halls or the 
places in Great Britain. 
But for America to take that stand 
that the discussion is worthy, that the 
study is worthy, that the idea of what 
kind of proposals would come about, 
what inclusive ways would we deal 
with the recognition of over two cen-
turies of slavery—unpaid, no insurance, 
no workers’ comp, no days off, from 
sunup to darkness, beat by the whip, as 
the slave narratives in 1939 told us. The 
stories are powerful. Ripped away from 
our families. Made families, husband 
and wife and children. Then you would 
hear the pleas in the slave narratives 
when they say, ‘‘Come home, husband. 
They are about to sell me and the chil-
dren in different ways and different 
places.’’ It happened to slaves all the 
time. 
I was honored and humbled to meet 
the survivors of the Wall Street mas-
sacre. It happened in 1921. Those people 
were, in actuality, some even former 
slaves, but mostly descendants of the 
most recent people who were slaves, 
the most recent, their ancestors or 
their mother might have been a slave. 
But they built a Wall Street, but yet it 
could not survive because of racism 
and discrimination. 
So to heal our land, the Congres-
sional Black Caucus has worked in 
many ways to heal our land, and I am 
grateful for their advocacy for just a 
fair and simple study and assessment 
of what we should do to repair what oc-
curred two centuries and continues 
even today. 
The story is long about the inequities 
of the GI Bill, redlining, discrimination 
in voting, in the criminal justice sys-
tem, the basis of wealth, so distinctive 
between other populations in this 
country. 
So I thank the Congressional Black 
Caucus for the extensive legislative 
history that it has had over the 117th 
Congress. 
It really is my privilege, Madam 
Speaker, to yield to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. CARTER) to speak 
about the accomplishments of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, my dear col-
league and friend who has shown him-
self a leader. 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, a huge thank you to our in-
credible 
leader, 
my 
neighbor, 
my 
friend, my colleague, my leader, the 
honorable 
Congresswoman 
SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE, who has the pulse of our 
country firmly in her grip. 
I have watched this woman go from 
country to country fighting for justice 
and what is right and what is pure. We 
can’t thank her enough in recognition 
of the great work she does. 
She stands at this rostrum, and she 
talks about the atrocities in our coun-
try while she continues to fight for 
atrocities in other countries. I applaud 
her. I thank her for her incredible lead-
ership. It has been a pleasure to work 
with her, and America has been a bet-
ter place because of her. 
For decades, the CBC has fought for 
justice, truth, and equality. From 
within the halls of government that 
once permitted our ancestors to be 
enslaved, Congress after Congress, the 
CBC is at the center of many negotia-
tions and conversations to better the 
lives of the American people. 
The 117th Congress was an excep-
tional example of CBC’s leadership. 
The CBC led the fight for a national in-
frastructure investment, so that in-
stead of bridges on the brink and toxic 
sludge, Americans will have resilient 
infrastructure and clean, safe, reliable 
drinking water. 
Today, the CBC leads the fight to re-
duce child poverty. Through policies 
like the expanded child tax credit and 
SNAP, we know that instead of setting 
kids up to struggle, we are setting 
them up to succeed. 
Through policies like the bipartisan 
Safer Communities Act, we can im-
prove public safety and help prevent 
terrible, hate-driven crimes like we 
saw in Buffalo, Uvalde, or any city in 
the U.S.A. It seems to happen far, far 
too often. 
In Louisiana, because of the actions 
of the CBC and great leaders in this 
body, we have been able to have kids 
not have to sit outside of a McDonald’s 
to use the internet. Since Katrina, 
since the hurricanes that have wrecked 
our community, since COVID that has 
wrecked our world, we know that 
things like broadband are no longer a 
luxury but a necessity.

Yet, in many impoverished commu-
nities in my district, people would not 
have access. Many rural areas would 
not have access to the internet for tele-
health, for education, for business pur-
poses, for everyday life, for shopping. 
These things would not exist. But I am 
proud today, because of the efforts of 
this body and because of the CBC, we 
are able to deliver and bring those 
things home to the people of Louisiana 
and America. 
We know that because of the infra-
structure bill that is now signed into 
law, Louisiana is seeing dollars flowing 
that they have never seen before. 
Bridges that have been on the brink of 
disaster are being repaired. The oppor-
tunity for us to have transportation 
between New Orleans, Baton Rouge, 
Lake Charles, and beyond is now a re-
ality. 
The ability to invest money in areas 
in my State that have been plagued 
with chemical poisoning, have been 
plagued with disease, because of the 
placement of these facilities that have 
historically settled themselves in com-
munities of Black and Brown. No 
longer will our communities be the 
path of least resistance. No longer will 
people have to literally die for their 
jobs. 
We can have coexistence, but coexist-
ence begins with everyone recognizing 
that the single most important com-
modity that anyone has is its people. 
Making sure that we have safe environ-
ments and clean environments where 
our children can be educated, where 
families can live, where families can 
earn a good living and enjoy clean air, 
that is what we fight for at the CBC 
every day. 
Louisiana will be the beneficiaries of 
such efforts. We will continue to fight 
to make sure that this caucus and this 
body understands and no longer looks 
away and says, ‘‘business as usual.’’ No 
longer can we afford to watch children 
go without. As my dear colleague and 
chairman of the Education and Labor 
Committee said moments ago, more 
money has been invested in HBCUs 
under this 117th Congress than ever in 
the history of our country. 
More money has been put into infra-
structure, since the very creation of 
the Interstate Highway System, under 
this Congress, and this CBC has played 
a pivotal role in making these things 
happen. 
But it doesn’t stop here. We must 
continue to fight. We must continue to 
go out and make sure that we tell our 
story: That we are here, we are work-
ing, and we will not let anyone turn 
the clock back on the efforts that we 
have fought so valiantly for. 
I am so proud to serve with giants in 
the CBC, people that have worked tire-
lessly for decades to make a difference 
in our community. 
There is a lot of work yet to be done. 
With the leadership of Chair BEATTY, 
Whip CLYBURN, and many others, the 
CBC will continue to secure major wins 
for the American people, because they 
deserve it. 
Madam Speaker, we will continue to 
fight. Failure is not an option. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, Homeland Secu-
rity, and the Budget, as well as the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, I am proud to stand be-
side my sisters and brothers to explore the 
achievements of the Congressional Black 
Caucus throughout the 117th Congress. 
I would like to thank Congresswoman 
BEATTY, the Chair of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, for organizing this Special Order 
today. I would also like to thank Speaker 
PELOSI for her outstanding leadership through-
out this Congress. 
Members of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus have been at the forefront of every major 
legislative achievement this 117th Congress. 
These achievements have pushed for an in-
crease in equity for African Americans, His-
panic Americans, Asian Americans, Native 
Americans, and people from all backgrounds 
in the United States. 
Members of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus strongly supported the President’s goal of 
passing legislation that will significantly reduce 
healthcare costs for all Americans and ad-
dress the very real climate crisis we are all 
facing. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will significantly 
reduce prescription drug costs and expand 
health insurance coverage for millions of Black 
Americans, relieving financial strains on indi-
viduals and families. 
Among adults 65 and older, Black Medicare 
beneficiaries are 1.5 times more likely than 
their white counterparts to have trouble afford-
ing medications. They are also 2 times as like-
ly to not fill needed prescriptions due to high 
drug costs. 
5.8 million Medicare beneficiaries are Afri-
can American, which amounts to 10 percent of 
all beneficiaries. 
Altogether, 5-to-7 million Medicare bene-
ficiaries will see their prescription drug costs 
go down because of the provision allowing 
Medicare to negotiate prescription drug costs. 
3.3 million Medicare beneficiaries will have 
their insulin costs capped at $35 a month. 
Seniors will also have their yearly prescrip-
tion drug costs capped at $2,000. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will enable free 
or low-cost health insurance to remain avail-
able, allowing over half a million more Black 
Americans to have health insurance coverage 
next year, compared to what the situation 
would be without the IRA. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is also the most 
aggressive legislation on climate change and 
clean energy in American history. 
This new law will help bring down energy 
costs for millions of Black Americans, and it 
includes very strong protections and programs 
to promote Environmental Justice. 
The average American family is estimated 
to see an annual $1,025 in energy savings, as 
the Inflation Reduction Act tackles one of the 
largest 
drivers 
of 
inflation—oil 
and 
gas 
prices—by lowering fuel and electricity costs 
and improving energy efficiency. 
This bill will prevent thousands of premature 
deaths by improving the air we breathe, with 
communities most burdened by pollution en-
joying disproportionate health benefits. 
The Inflation Reduction Act alone will help 
get America 80 percent of the way to achiev-
ing its share of greenhouse gas reductions, 
and the majority of the way toward President 
Biden’s goal of cutting carbon pollution in half 
this decade. 
The members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus were also leaders in the passage of 
the Presidents Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. 
The once-in-a-generation investment into 
our nation’s infrastructure addresses the dis-
parate impacts of pollution on communities of 
color. 
Black, Hispanic, Asian American, Pacific Is-
lander, 
and 
Native 
Americans—especially 
those who reside in urban communities—are 
more likely to be negatively impacted by pollu-
tion. Black people are almost three times more 
likely to die from asthma related causes than 
their white counterparts. 
My constituents have already seen the mag-
nificent results of this once-in-a-generation 
piece of legislation. 
Houston METRO was granted a $21 million 
grant to buy battery electric buses and charg-
ing infrastructure to replace aging diesel buses 
that have exceeded their useful life. 
The electric buses will improve air quality 
and health—for riders and residents in Hous-
ton’s historically disadvantaged communities 
by eliminating nearly 18,000 tons of green-
house gases over the next 20 years. 
The passage of the law also allowed me to 
work closely with Secretary Buttigieg to secure 
$40 million dollars in funding for Bush Inter-
continental Airport. IAH’s terminal redevelop-
ment program is the largest project in the air-
port’s 53-year-history. 
I am very pleased and proud that the CBC’s 
priorities for the 117th Congress included 
some of my legislation, including the creation 
of the new Juneteenth federal holiday. 
On June 17, 2021, President Biden signed 
into law the Juneteenth National Independ-
ence Day Act, establishing June 19th as an 
annual national holiday. 
Since I had placed the creation of a 
Juneteenth federal holiday on the national 
agenda—introducing H.R. 7232, on June 18, 
2020 and reintroducing the Juneteenth Na-
tional Independence Day Act in the 117th 
Congress—witnessing it become law was a 
true honor and an exhilarating occasion. 
It was the culmination of years—even dec-
ades—of efforts to have the nation formally 
recognize the importance of Juneteenth and 
inculcate it into the pantheon of landmark na-
tional occasions with profound significance for 
the country and all Americans. 
That day at the White House, I celebrated 
the joyful, yet tearful signing ceremony joined 
by my congressional colleagues, members of 
the Congressional Black Caucus, representa-
tives of the numerous organizations who toiled 
in the vineyards for so long, and the first Afri-
can American Vice-President. 
It spoke volumes that the Juneteenth Na-
tional Independence Day Act had over-
whelming bipartisan support, passing by unan-
imous consent in the Senate and a 415 to 14 
vote in the House the next day. 
Although I had introduced resolutions recog-
nizing Juneteenth since 2013, establishing 
Juneteenth as a national holiday was a quan-
tum leap further. Enacting the holiday into law 
was much more than commemorating the his-
toric events associated with Juneteenth. 
Making Juneteenth a national holiday as-
serts that the historic occasion is a funda-
mental part of American history. It elevates 
Juneteenth into the consciousness of all 
Americans. It reinforces the point that Black 
history is American history.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7952 
September 19, 2022 
National recognition of Juneteenth creates a 
channel for teaching and learning the truth 
about slavery which preceded it and both Re-
construction and the Jim Crow era that fol-
lowed it. Amid this era of misinformation, hav-
ing the national imprimatur on Juneteenth will 
launch discussions and awareness of the 
Black experience in America that will add to 
multi-ethnic cohesion and mutual respect. 
Since the 1800s, Juneteenth has been as 
important to African Americans as July 4th is 
to all Americans. Consider also that, at the 
end of the Revolutionary War, while patriots 
were celebrating the end of colonialism and 
subjugation, 450,000 African-Americans were 
trapped in chattel slavery: our country’s origi-
nal sin. Black Americans were considered and 
treated as property, not as people. 
Juneteenth is special because, on June 19, 
1865, General Gordon Granger, the Com-
manding Officer of the District of Texas, rode 
into Galveston, Texas, announcing the end of 
the Civil War and the freedom of the last 
Americans enslaved in the Confederate states. 
The announcement of freedom belatedly 
freed 250,000 slaves in Texas months after 
the end of the Civil War and two and a half 
years after the Emancipation Proclamation, 
signed by President Abraham Lincoln, went 
into effect. 
Texas’s newly freed men and women re-
acted first with shock and then with jubilation 
when General Granger read these words of 
General Order No. 3: 
‘‘The people of Texas are informed that in 
accordance with a Proclamation from the Ex-
ecutive of the United States, all slaves are 
free. This involves an absolute equality of 
rights and rights of property between former 
masters and slaves, and the connection there-
fore existing between them becomes that be-
tween employer and hired laborer.’’ 
Until then, slave owners withheld freedom 
by not informing those whom they enslaved 
and who enabled their wealth. It was nec-
essary for the Union Army to take control of 
an area and announce freedom for it to take 
effect. Because of Galveston’s remote loca-
tion, it was not until June 19, 1865, that the 
Union Army arrived. 
General Granger’s reading of General Order 
No. 3 ended chattel slavery, the institutional-
ized system of perpetual servitude that held 
generations of Africans in bondage in the our 
country for 248 years. 
No longer would human beings be forced 
into a legalized system of unending, lifelong 
slavery that was known for gruesome mur-
ders, dehumanizing rapes, and tortuous beat-
ings and floggings with leather whips tipped 
with metal to rip flesh from bone. No longer 
would the atrocities of slavery be permitted by 
federal laws. 
Juneteenth was first celebrated in 1866 
under the direction of the Freedmen’s Bureau 
and was often called ‘‘Jubilee Day’’. As freed 
men and women left Galveston to begin their 
lives anew in other states, the retelling of their 
Juneteenth memories led to annual celebra-
tions in many other states. 
Recognizing the importance of this date, 
former slaves coined the word ‘‘Juneteenth’’ to 
mark the joyous occasion. 
Yet, in some cases, white officials outwardly 
resisted the holiday, barring the use of public 
property for the festivities. So, church grounds 
were used for the festivities, and, as freed 
men and women achieved upward economic 
mobility, some communities purchased land 
for Juneteenth celebrations. 
One of the earliest documented land pur-
chases in the name of Juneteenth was orga-
nized by Rev. Jack Yates. This fundraising ef-
fort yielded $1,000 and the purchase of Eman-
cipation Park in Houston, Texas. 
In the town of Mexia, Texas, the local 
Juneteenth organization purchased Booker T. 
Washington 
Park, 
which 
became 
the 
Juneteenth celebration site in 1898. 
Along with parades, prayer readings, per-
formances and cookouts among finely attired 
attendees, Juneteenth community-centric ac-
tivities informed Black Americans about voting, 
promoted education, and showcased the 
achievements of African Americans and the 
community. 
Perhaps because the holiday carried the 
message of empowerment, Juneteenth activi-
ties were sometimes interrupted and halted by 
white landowners demanding that their labor-
ers return to work. 
Juneteenth continued to be highly revered in 
Texas decades later, with many former slaves 
and their descendants making an annual pil-
grimage back to Galveston to celebrate June 
19th. 
Juneteenth remains the oldest known cele-
bration of slavery’s demise, commemorating 
freedom while acknowledging the sacrifices 
and contributions made by courageous African 
Americans towards, in more recent years, 
making our great nation the more conscious 
and accepting country that it has become. 
Juneteenth was, and is, a living symbol of 
freedom for people who were denied hope of 
being free. 
It serves as a reminder that, as the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. said, ‘‘Freedom is never 
free,’’ and as African American labor leader A. 
Phillip Randolph often said, ‘‘Freedom is never 
given. It is won.’’ 
Truer words were never spoken. 
We should all recognize the power and truth 
of those guideposts. Juneteenth calls upon us 
to pause to remember the enormous price 
paid by all Americans in our country’s quest to 
realize its promise. 
Juneteenth honors the end of the 400 years 
of suffering that African Americans endured 
under slavery and celebrates the legacy of 
perseverance that has become the hallmark of 
the African American experience in the strug-
gle for equality. 
As the poet Langston Hughes reminds us in 
his famous poem, ‘‘Mother to Son,’’ that life in 
America for African Americans ‘‘ain’t been no 
crystal stair.’’ 
The Jim Crow era in America was marked 
by violence and terrorism against African 
Americans as our ancestors sought to activate 
the promises of the Declaration of Independ-
ence and the Constitution. 
Juneteenth celebrations declined in the 
1920s and 1930s partly due to the Great De-
pression’s severe economic difficulties, but 
mainly because of the resurgence of heinous 
hate crimes perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan 
to derail African Americans from advancing in 
society politically and economically. 
Despite the New Deal’s progress and post- 
WWII economic policies, discrimination and 
the lingering impact of slavery largely ex-
cluded African Americans from the creation of 
the modern middle class. 
However, the Civil Rights Movement of the 
1950s and 1960s, and its legal framework for 
equality, led to a resurrection of Juneteenth 
celebrations that celebrated the achievements 
of Black Americans, reinforcing our commu-
nity’s sense of identity and pride. 
Juneteenth became an opportunity for us to 
showcase our successes and our contributions 
to society, while providing the government with 
a mirror into demographic disparities and a 
demand to recommit itself to serving all Ameri-
cans. 
Amid this renewed spirit of identity, pride, 
and equality, Texas state representative Al 
Edwards introduced a bill, H.R. 1016, to make 
Juneteenth a state holiday. The bill became 
law, and on January 1, 1980, Juneteenth offi-
cially became a Texas state holiday, making 
Texas the first state to officially recognize this 
celebration of emancipation. 
Representative Edwards actively sought to 
spread the observance of Juneteenth across 
America. In the two decades after Texas 
acted, only a few other states did so. But in 
the past twenty years, a wave of states fol-
lowed Texas’s lead. By 2021, 49 states and 
the District of Columbia had commemorated or 
recognized Juneteenth. 
Nonagenarian activist Opal Lee, affection-
ately 
known 
as 
the 
‘‘Grandmother 
of 
Juneteenth,’’ also deserves much credit for the 
federal holiday. Lee pressed for the holiday for 
years, and in 2016 at age 89, walked from her 
home in Fort Worth to Washington, DC, to de-
liver a petition and raise attention to) the holi-
day’s importance. 
Today, after decades of rallies, petitions, 
editorials, and legislation calling for Juneteenth 
to be a national holiday, we celebrate the 2nd 
Juneteenth National Independence Day. 
The 
transformative 
significance 
of 
Juneteenth since the first celebration in 1866 
is a remarkable tale in American history. 
Though it is now recognized at the national 
level, it does not erase our nation’s racist his-
tory in straying from its original promise that 
‘‘all men (actually, people) are created equal.’’ 
Every Juneteenth, I return to Frederick 
Douglass’ speech best known as ‘‘What to the 
Slave is the Fourth of July?’’ 
The answer to this question is Juneteenth. 
In 2022, we can affirm that June 19, 1865, 
signifies the start of the American Promise 
that must be fulfilled and made real for all 
Americans, including the descendants of 
slaves. 
To say 1776 marks the beginning of our 
free nation begs the question, ‘‘What does 
freedom mean if we are not all free?’’ 
Juneteenth remains a pivotal moment, signi-
fying the starting point in the emergence from 
racial oppression that was endured by genera-
tions with perseverance, resilience, and deter-
mination. 
This vision is shared by millions of Ameri-
cans who have held fast to the promise of 
freedom in our nation while fighting for basic 
human rights. We know that the struggle 
which began in 1619 did not end with the 
Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. 
The fight did not end two years later in 
1865, nor 100 years after that with the pas-
sage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights 
Acts. 
The fight for our freedom continues as a 
common thread in the fabric of this country. 
But we also recognize the lack of freedom that 
persists for many, as well as the injustices, 
abuse, and discrimination that continue in to-
day’s America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7953 
September 19, 2022 
The true power of Juneteenth lies both in 
the commemoration of the past and the possi-
bilities of the future. 
When VAWA first became law in 1994, it 
represented a historic shift in the federal gov-
ernment’s role in combating violent crimes 
committed against women. 
Due to the importance of the legislation and 
resulting success, VAWA was reauthorized on 
an overwhelming bipartisan basis in 2000, 
2005, and 2013. 
Recognizing the importance of the law and 
knowing that the law was set to expire at the 
end of the year, I introduced the ‘‘Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2018’’ 
in September of 2018. 
The reauthorization strengthened and en-
hanced the vital services provided under the 
law to victims of domestic violence, dating vio-
lence, sexual assault, and stalking. 
Despite our best efforts, the bill was not 
brought to the floor, and VAWA was allowed 
to expire at the end of 2018. 
I continued to work, along with other mem-
bers, victims, survivors, experts, and advo-
cates, to ensure not only that VAWA would be 
reauthorized but that we enhanced the law 
and made it better, more effective, and more 
responsive to the needs of those seeking to 
heal after suffering trauma. 
Therefore, I introduced the bill, HR 1620, 
the ‘‘Violence Against Women Act Reauthor-
ization Act of 2021’’. 
This version of the reauthorization rep-
resented countless hours of discussions to en-
sure that we refined and improved upon the 
earlier iteration of the bill. 
H.R. 1620 passed in the House and served 
as foundation for the bill that was introduced 
in the Senate and was eventually included in 
H.R. 2471, the ‘‘Consolidated Appropriations 
Act of 2022’’ (the Omnibus) and signed by the 
President. 
Thankfully, after many hard-fought battles, 
we were finally able to get the VAWA Reau-
thorization across the finish line this year. 
Many of the provisions I included in my bills 
in 2018 and 2021 carried over to the Senate 
version of VAWA as well as the Omnibus, 
such as: 
The reauthorization of vital grant programs 
like the Services Training Offices Prosecutors, 
or STOP grants, administered by the Depart-
ment of Justice, which allows the use of STOP 
grants to develop the most effective law en-
forcement tools and protocols for preventing 
domestic violence homicides and requires 
state, territorial, local, and tribal governments 
to certify that they have established and imple-
mented such programs to be eligible for 
grants. 
Creating Hope through Outreach Options, 
Services, and Education, or the CHOOSE pro-
gram, which clarifies that funding under the 
CHOOSE program for children and youth is 
being provided for the core areas of VAWA— 
domestic violence, dating violence, sexual as-
sault, and stalking—and that services that tar-
get youth should also incorporate youth in un-
derserved communities and sex trafficking and 
bullying as elements when part of a com-
prehensive youth violence response program. 
The preservation of funding for sexual as-
sault services programs, transitional housing 
grants for victims, grants to states territories, 
and Indian tribes in rural communities, and 
grants to support families in the justice system 
with a history of domestic violence, dating vio-
lence, sexual assault, or stalking. 
Just today, the House passed my bipartisan 
bill, H.R. 7566, the ‘‘No Trafficking Zones Act.’’ 
The bill would ensure that schools across the 
country, including institutions of higher edu-
cation, are safe spaces for learning and aca-
demic exploration—free from the menace of 
sex trafficking. 
As predators often prey on communities of 
color, this bill is a strong measure to fight 
against sex trafficking that often targets young 
African Americans and other people of color. 
H.R. 7566 would establish a sentencing en-
hancement of up to five years in several in-
stances: 
First, in the case of any person who com-
mits the offense of sex trafficking within a pri-
mary or secondary school zone or on or within 
1,000 feet of the premises of a school-spon-
sored activity or premises owned by an institu-
tion of higher education; 
Second, for any person who commits the of-
fense of coercion and enticement of a minor 
enrolled in a primary or secondary school or a 
person enrolled in an institution of higher edu-
cation—to travel in interstate or foreign com-
merce and engage in criminal sexual activity— 
while the minor is in a school zone, or on, or 
within 1,000 feet of, premises where a school- 
sponsored activity is taking place or while the 
person is on, or within 1,000 feet of, premises 
owned by the institution of higher education; 
And, third, for any person who commits the 
offense of coercion and enticement of a minor 
using the mail or facilities of interstate or for-
eign commerce—such as text and instant 
messaging or social media platforms—while 
the minor who is enrolled in school or an insti-
tution of higher education, is in a school zone, 
or on, or within 1,000 feet of, premises where 
a school-sponsored activity is taking place or 
premises owned by an the institution of higher 
education. 
Human trafficking is one of the greatest 
threats to human rights in the United States. 
In 2020, 11,193 instances of potential human 
trafficking were reported to the United States 
National Human Trafficking Hotline with at 
least 70 percent of those instances involving 
sex trafficking, while an estimated 25 percent 
of all human trafficking victims in the country 
are in my home state of Texas at any given 
time—many of whom are minors. 
At least 5,359 of trafficking victims and sur-
vivors identified through the hotline in 2019 
were under the age of 18, and in 2021, the 
National Center for Missing and Exploited 
Children received more than 17,200 reports of 
suspected child sex trafficking. 
Many of these young victims of sex traf-
ficking are students in school systems, col-
leges, trade schools, and universities across 
the country. 
A 2018 survey reported that in Texas— 
where No Trafficking Zone legislation passed 
with bipartisan support earlier this year—55 
percent of young sex trafficking survivors were 
trafficked while at school or school activities 
and 60 percent of trafficked adults said they 
were first groomed and solicited for trafficking 
while on school campuses. 
Members of this body know all too well that 
children are sexually exploited in many ways. 
Some young people are trafficked by their 
schoolmates or people they once considered 
friends. 
While traffickers seek out young people who 
have 
noticeable 
vulnerabilities—including 
problems at school, conflicts at home, or even 
the need to fill in a tuition gap caused by the 
loss of a scholarship—no child or young per-
son is truly safe from the schemes of char-
ismatic traffickers bent on exploiting and de-
stroying young lives. 
With the proliferation of social media and 
the myriad ways in which we communicate 
with one another, traffickers have put these 
same means of communication to their own 
use—to find, target, lure, groom, victimize, and 
exert control over their victims. While buyers 
are using technology to find and purchase sex 
anonymously. 
Traffickers have infiltrated every known form 
of communication—especially the sites, mes-
saging apps, and social media platforms our 
children use most frequently—leaving young 
people more vulnerable to manipulation. 
Access to the internet, cell phones, and 
smartphones makes it easier for traffickers 
and buyers to communicate with children and 
youth—even when they are at school, in class, 
or attending school-sponsored activities. 
As a result, trafficking has reached the halls, 
lunchrooms, gyms, dormitories, and class-
rooms of schools, colleges, and universities in 
every corner of this nation. 
These staggering facts and statistics led me 
to introduce this bipartisan legislation which 
the House passed today to protect young 
Americans from predators. 
Last week, the House passed H.R. 8326, 
the Ensuring a Fair and Accurate Census Act. 
By reforming the operations of the Census Bu-
reau, this bill—which includes my amend-
ment—would ensure that racial and ethnic eq-
uity in the decennial count will be a priority in 
future Census counts. 
My amendment would enhance the bill’s 
operational impact by specifying that the dep-
uty director appoint an official with responsi-
bility to optimize racial and ethnic equity in the 
Census count. To ensure that equity be a pri-
ority, this official would report directly to the di-
rector and deputy director. 
In light of the decennial count’s extremely 
consequential impact in terms of funding allo-
cation formulas, political district apportionment, 
and other uses, it is imperative that the Cen-
sus Bureau elevate racial and ethnic equity to 
a top priority in its counting strategies and pro-
cedures. 
My amendment directs the equity official to 
engage and collaborate with organizations that 
have influence with racial and ethnic groups, 
develop strategies and tactics to maximize 
participation of these populations, and rectify 
the undercount that has been typical of recent 
Census counts, especially among immigrants 
and homeless people. 
The status of the efforts to optimize racial 
and ethnic equity will also be included in the 
Census Bureau’s biannual reports to Con-
gress, to ensure accountability and bolster the 
likelihood of progress. 
Optimization of racial and ethnic equity in 
the Census count requires designation of a 
high-ranking official with direct responsibility 
for achieving this goal and reports directly to 
the Census leadership. 
My amendment establishes that role, makes 
racial and ethnic equity in the decennial count 
a priority, specifies key strategies that must be 
applied, and ensures that Congress receives 
regular reports about the progress toward the 
goal. 
H.R. 8326 is an excellent bill with vital re-
forms that uses this opportunity to advance

equity in the Census count. My amendment 
creates a framework for achieving this objec-
tive. 
In May of this year, the House passed HR 
7309, the Workforce Innovation and Oppor-
tunity Act of 2022. 
This bill would ensure that more institutions 
will be able to provide education and job train-
ing services; a wider range of curricula will be 
available that enables learners to become job- 
ready; and more Americans will be equipped 
with skills that will jump-start long-term ca-
reers. 
It would extend the reach of job skills train-
ing and employment preparation to all corners 
of the country and all segments of society. It 
does so by creating vital national programs 
and instituting accountability systems that will 
monitor program operations and success. 
One of my two amendments to this bill 
would ensure that this legislation helps all 
Americans, specifically communities of color 
that historically did not benefit equally from 
workforce development and job skills training 
programs. 
My amendment ensures that HBCUs and 
other minority-serving educational institutions 
are eligible and encouraged to apply for maxi-
mal benefits under the bill’s programs. 
My amendment clarifies that, beyond equal-
ity, the job training and workforce development 
programs at HBCUs and minority-serving insti-
tutions should be given priority in order to pro-
mote equity for students whose ancestors 
were denied that right. It can be the impetus 
for a fresh start. 
By including and prioritizing HBCUs and 
other minority-serving institutions, the institu-
tionalized 
barriers 
which 
1 
impeded 
generational prosperity will be eroded, even if 
only incrementally and over time. By leveling 
the playing field, the imbalance of generational 
wealth will also be rectified. 
Diversity and inclusion must always be a 
priority particularly in future high-growth indus-
tries that are essential to our nation’s long- 
term economic growth, success, and job cre-
ation strategy. 
The Transportation, Housing & Urban De-
velopment, 
Agriculture 
Appropriations 
Act 
passed the House in July of this year with 
many amendments that I offered. 
One of my amendments to this bill specifi-
cally benefits HBCUs. It supports the work of 
the National Institute of Food and Agriculture 
(NIFA) by increasing its funding by $2,000,000 
for use in agriculture research programs at 
1890s Institutions, which are land grant col-
leges at 28 Historically Black Colleges and 
Universities (HBCUs), as well as Hispanic- 
serving institutions, and other educational in-
stitutions that benefit underrepresented com-
munities. 
This amendment promotes NIFA’s work at 
HBCUs with agricultural experiment stations, 
cooperative forestry, and other innovations to 
improve our nation’s food production through 
agricultural research, economic analysis, ex-
tension, and higher education. 
One of ways NIFA achieves its mission is 
by providing research grants to education in-
stitutions, which include 1890s institutions cre-
ated by the Morrill Act of 1890. 
Today, land-grant colleges and universities 
can be found in 18 states, the District of Co-
lumbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The list in-
cludes: 
Alabama A&M University 
Alcorn State University 
Delaware State University 
Florida A&M University 
Fort Valley State University 
Kentucky State University 
Langston University 
Lincoln University 
North Carolina A&T State University 
Prairie View A&M University in Texas 
South Carolina State University 
Southern University System 
Tennessee State University 
Tuskegee University 
University of Arkansas Pine Bluff 
University of Maryland Eastern Shore 
University of the District of Columbia* 
University of the Virgin Islands 
Virginia State University 
West Virginia State University 
HBCUs annually enroll 40 percent of all Afri-
can American students in 4-year colleges and 
universities. HBCUs are prominent among re-
search institutions in fields such as: 
animal sciences 
sustainable agriculture and agriculture eco-
nomics 
toxicology and waste management 
conservation and environmental manage-
ment 
business and industrial development 
biomedical science 
food and nutrition 
plant and social sciences 
international development 
Agricultural research programs at HCBUs 
help people living in densely populated areas 
learn ways to eliminate food deserts, increase 
public education about farming, bolster appre-
ciation for our nation’s farmers, and provide 
new avenues to careers for graduates with de-
grees in agriculture who seek to enter cutting- 
edge agricultural research. 
This amendment promotes NIFA’s work with 
HBCUs on agricultural experiment stations, 
cooperative forestry, and other innovations to 
improve our nation’s food production through 
agricultural research, economic analysis, ex-
tension, and higher education. 
The funds provided by my amendment sup-
ports research and education for helping 
urban and suburban communities maximize 
their green space by turning it into productive 
farming resources to support access to afford-
able foods. 
Since 2020, the COVID–19 pandemic has 
swept the country, wreaking its most bitter toll 
on communities of color. 
Early in the pandemic, the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control found that Black Americans 
were infected with COVID–19 at a rate nearly 
one and a half times higher than that of 
whites, were hospitalized at a rate nearly four 
times higher, and were three times as likely to 
die from the disease. 
On February 8, 2021, I introduced H.R. 936, 
the ‘‘COVID–19 Delivery Act,’’ which strength-
ens FEMA’s role in vaccine distribution. 
Specifically, this legislation: (1) authorized 
FEMA as the National Coordinator of vaccine 
transport and delivery; (2) supported the safe 
and effective supply chain transport, delivery, 
and site use of vaccines; (3) implemented the 
Center for Disease Control and prevention 
COVID–19 Vaccine Recommendations. 
To date I have opened 96 COVID–19 test-
ing sites and 88 vaccination sites in some of 
the most underserved communities in my dis-
trict and Houston as a whole. 
As an original cosponsor of H.R. 1652 the 
‘‘VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund 
Act, I helped lead the passage of the bill in the 
House and on June 22, 2021, President Biden 
signed the bill into law. 
VOCA grants are the primary source of fed-
eral funding for thousands of victim service 
providers around the country, including pro-
grams serving victims of domestic violence, 
sexual assault, child abuse, trafficking, and 
drunk driving. 
This critical piece of legislation supports vital 
victim service programs by preventing future 
cuts to already diminished federal victim serv-
ice grants. 
H.R. 1652 requires the Department of Jus-
tice DOJ to deposit all monetary penalties, in-
cluding from deferred prosecution and non- 
prosecution agreements, into the Crime Vic-
tims Fund. This simple fix prevents future 
funding cuts that jeopardize programs’ ability 
to serve their communities. 
Although the Congressional Black Caucus 
has had many legendary achievements this 
Congress, our work is far from done. We will 
continue to fight for equality and justice by 
pushing legislation that will better the lives of 
African Americans, and indeed all Americans 
around the nation. 
Now more than ever, the facts and cir-
cumstances facing our nation demonstrate the 
importance of H.R. 40, which I introduced, and 
the necessity of placing our nation on the path 
to reparative justice, as well as providing ac-
countability for injuries inflicted. 
H.R. 40 establishes a national commission 
to examine slavery and discrimination in the 
colonies and the United States from 1619 to 
the present and recommend appropriate rem-
edies. 
H.R. 40 was first introduced by Congress-
man John Conyers in 1989. Though many 
thought it a lost cause, Conyers believed that 
a day would come when our nation would 
need to account for the brutal abuse of African 
Americans during slavery, Jim Crow segrega-
tion and the enduring structural racism en-
demic to our society. 
With the rise and normalization of white 
supremacism during the Trump administration, 
the discussion of H.R. 40 and the concept of 
restorative justice gained urgency, garnered 
attention from mainstream media, and illus-
trated the need for a national reckoning. 
Eradication of structural institutionalized rac-
ism requires it. Full empowerment, enfran-
chisement, and inclusion require it. Genuine 
equality and equity to overcome injustices re-
quire it. 
A vital step is an official acknowledgment 
that Black history IS American history and the 
Juneteenth holiday has achieved that. 
Another key step for reconciliation is the de-
velopment of a factual, historical record that il-
luminates the truth about the African American 
experience amid slavery, Reconstruction, Jim 
Crow, legalized violence, exclusion, and in-
equality. 
The factual, truthful record will expose the 
fallacies of revisionism and misinformation 
which, in recent years, have become the fa-
vorite tools of those with racist motives and 
agendas. Vilification of the collegiate study of 
critical race theory is a typical example. 
The role of federal, state, and local govern-
ments at each stage in the nefarious chapters 
of history must be revealed and recognized. 
The next step must be a national apology 
for governmental actions that legalized op-
pression, violence, inequality, and exclusion

from the means toward socioeconomic mobil-
ity and generational wealth. 
Reconciliation requires an apology—an ac-
knowledgment of government collusion in past 
ignominious eras—for three reasons: to pro-
vide accountability for past wrongs, to heal the 
national soul, and to confer official validation 
of the plights of its victims. Without an apol-
ogy, there can be no closure; there can be no 
justice for our ancestors who suffered hideous 
torment. 
With those steps addressed, the focus turns 
to what can be done to right the wrong. Rep-
arations in various forms are needed to instill 
equity and create a level playing field for Afri-
can Americans who are still disadvantaged by 
the aftershocks of previous eras. 
The commission created by H.R. 40 would 
start by identifying (1) the role of federal and 
state governments in supporting the institution 
of slavery; (2) forms of discrimination in the 
public and private sectors against freed slaves 
and their descendants; and (3) lingering nega-
tive effects of slavery that impact today’s Afri-
can-Americans and society. 
The goal of the historical investigations that 
H.R. 40 mandates is to bring American society 
to a new reckoning with how our past affects 
the current conditions of African Americans 
and to make America a ‘‘more perfect union’’ 
by helping the truly disadvantaged. 
Consequently, the reparations movement 
does not focus on payments to individuals, but 
rather, on remedies that can be created in as 
many forms as necessary to equitably address 
the many kinds of injuries sustained from chat-
tel slavery and its ongoing vestiges. 
To merely focus on finance is an empty 
gesture and betrays a lack of understanding of 
the depth of the unaddressed moral issues 
that continue to haunt this nation. 
Reparations can have wide-ranging positive 
effects, for example, a recent peer-reviewed 
study from Harvard Medical School suggests 
that reparations for African Americans that 
narrowed the wealth gap could have cut 
COVID–19 transmission and infection rates 
both among Blacks and the population at 
large. 
While it might be convenient to assume that 
we can address the current divisive racial and 
political climate in our nation through race 
neutral means, experience shows that we 
have not escaped our history. 
Though the Civil Rights Movement chal-
lenged many of the most racist practices and 
structures that subjugated the African Amer-
ican community, it was not followed by a com-
mitment to truth and reconciliation. 
For that reason, the legacy of racial inequal-
ity has persisted, leaving the nation vulnerable 
to a range of problems that continue to gen-
erate division, racial disparities, and injustice. 
By passing H.R. 40, Congress can start a 
movement toward the national reckoning that 
we need to bridge racial divides. 
Reparations are ultimately about respect 
and reconciliation—and the hope that one day, 
all Americans can walk together toward a 
more just future. 
In his famous Second Inaugural Address, 
President Lincoln spoke of the profound moral 
debt owed for ‘‘all the wealth piled by the 
bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of un-
requited toil.’’ He asserted that the Civil War 
was the judgment of the Lord, which was ‘‘true 
and righteous altogether.’’ 
That debt remains to be paid, which is why 
African Americans always peacefully peti-
tioned the government for the redress of griev-
ances. 
As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King said at 
the 1963 March on Washington: 
‘‘In a sense, we have come to our nation’s 
capital to cash a check. When the architects 
of our republic wrote the magnificent words of 
the Constitution and the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, they were signing a promissory 
note to which every American was to fall heir. 
‘‘This note was a promise that all men, yes, 
black men as well as white men, would be 
guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. 
‘‘It is obvious today that America has de-
faulted on this promissory note insofar as her 
citizens of color are concerned. Instead of 
honoring this sacred obligation, America has 
given the Negro people a bad check, a check 
which has come back marked ‘insufficient 
funds.’ But we refuse to believe that the bank 
of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe 
that there are insufficient funds in the great 
vaults of opportunity of this nation. So, we 
have come to cash this check—a check that 
will give us upon demand the riches of free-
dom and the security of justice.’’ 
Official slavery ended with the Civil War and 
the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. 
But unofficial slavery continued by: (a) 
newly instituted share-crop farming; (b) a 
criminal justice system that pressed convicts 
into work that was once done by slaves; and 
(c) labor policies that dictated income for work 
done based upon skin color. 
This, of course, was reinforced by the sys-
tematic disenfranchisement of black Ameri-
cans, the ‘‘discrete and insular minority’’ ex-
cluded from ‘‘those political processes ordi-
narily to be relied upon to protect’’ them, to 
quote Chief Justice Hughes’ famous Footnote 
4 in United States v. Carolene Products Com-
pany, 304 U.S. 144 (1938). 
These are just some of the many reasons 
that the history of the U.S. is intertwined with 
the history of enslaved Africans in the Amer-
icas. 
But to reach redemption and reconciliation, 
we must have the complete truth and lay our 
history bare. It is the light that sheds the way 
to the more perfect union all Americans de-
sire. 
The Commission that would be created and 
empowered by H.R. 40 is a vital first step in 
the effort to attain truth and reconciliation 
about the Original Sin of American Slavery 
that is necessary to light the way to the be-
loved community we all seek. 
We witnessed nightly peaceful civil disobe-
dience in the streets of America in solidarity 
with countless victims of injustice and cruelty. 
Young African American men and women no 
longer with us in body but forever with us in 
memory. 
We demanded justice and equity that starts 
with policing reform yet extends far beyond. 
It’s not just about police conduct toward us. It 
starts with the predisposition of police about 
us, before interaction occurs. Police biases, 
implicit and explicit, can forecast a propensity 
for violence toward us and the denial of our 
civil rights. 
In addition to criminal justice reform, we de-
manded the full eradication of structural and 
systemic institutionalized racism. Since then, 
confederate statues were removed, newly de-
veloped factual curriculum has begun to edu-
cate all students about the actual truth of 
Black history, and millions of Americans 
learned about the Juneteenth holiday. 
Once again, I would like to thank Chair-
woman BEATTY for giving me and my CBC col-
leagues the opportunity to shine a light on all 
our accomplishments this Congress. 
I am so proud to be a part of such a dedi-
cated and hardworking group of people. I look 
forward to continuing to work with all of you on 
legislation that will make America a more 
equal and just place. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an ABC News article entitled: 
‘‘Congress passes legislation to make 
Juneteenth a federal holiday.’’ 
[From ABC News, June 16, 2021] 
CONGRESS PASSES LEGISLATION TO MAKE 
JUNETEENTH A FEDERAL HOLIDAY 
(By Libby Cathey) 
For the first time in nearly 40 years, Con-
gress has moved to establish a new national 
holiday, this time for Juneteenth, and just 
in time for Saturday’s 156th anniversary of 
the day that marks the last African Amer-
ican slaves being freed in Texas in the wake 
of the Civil War. 
The House voted Wednesday night to pass 
the legislation. It heads next to President 
Joe Biden’s desk for a signature. When Biden 
signs it, as he’s expected to at 3:30 p.m. ET 
Thursday, according to the White House, 
Juneteenth will officially become a federal 
holiday—the first since Martin Luther King 
Jr. Day was signed into law in 1983. 
Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of 
Texas, a fierce advocate for the Black com-
munity who sponsored the legislation in the 
House, proudly announced from the podium 
the ‘‘bill is passed’’ before bringing the gavel 
down. 
One Republican, Rep. Matt Rosendale of 
Montana, said in a charged statement ahead 
of the evening vote that he opposed the legis-
lation that was ‘‘an effort by the Left to cre-
ate a day out of whole cloth to celebrate 
identity politics.’’ Sen. John Cornyn, R– 
Texas, a lead sponsor of the Senate bill, 
called the statement ‘‘kooky’’ in a tweet. 
Other House Republicans who voted no on 
the legislation include Reps. Thomas Massie, 
Scott DesJarlais, Mo Brooks, Andy Biggs, 
Tom Tiffany, Doug LaMalfa, Tom McClin-
tock, Mike Rogers, Andrew Clyde, Ralph 
Norman, Chip Roy, Paul Gosar and Ronny 
Jackson of Texas. 
The House vote came after the Senate—in 
a surprise move Tuesday—passed the meas-
ure by unanimous consent following a single 
Republican senator dropping his opposition. 
Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wis-
consin, who opposed the legislation last 
year, said in a statement that he would no 
longer raise his objections on the floor, 
though, as of last week, the bill already had 
the support of 60 cosponsors to overcome a 
filibuster. 
‘‘Although I strongly support celebrating 
Emancipation, I objected to the cost and 
lack of debate,’’ Johnson said, referring to 
his previous stance. ‘‘While it still seems 
strange that having taxpayers provide fed-
eral employees paid time off is now required 
to celebrate the end of slavery, it is clear 
that there is no appetite in Congress to fur-
ther discuss the matter.’’ 
Biden will be accompanied for the signing 
by Vice President Kamala Harris, who was 
one of the Democrats to introduce the legis-
lation in the Senate last year alongside Cor-
nyn. 
Steve Williams, the president of the Na-
tional Juneteenth Observance Foundation, 
thanked lawmakers in a press conference on 
Capitol Hill earlier for, he said, ‘‘put(ting) 
that exclamation mark on the fabulous 
work.’’

‘‘The Juneteenth nation is ecstatic,’’ he 
said. 
What is Juneteenth? 
Juneteenth—also known as Freedom Day, 
Liberation Day and Emancipation Day— 
marks the day when federal troops arrived in 
Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, to ensure 
that African Americans still enslaved were 
freed following both the signing of the 
Emancipation Proclamation and end of the 
Civil War. 
The advance by Union Army Gen. Gordon 
Granger came 30 months and 19 days after 
President 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
signed 
the 
Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, 
which had declared, ‘‘all persons held as 
slaves within any States, or designated part 
of the State, the people whereof shall be in 
rebellion against the United States, shall be 
then, thenceforward, and forever free.’’ 
But with the seven Confederate states op-
erating under their own president, slaves in 
the South weren’t exactly free to go. It 
would take another two months after Robert 
E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Court 
House in April 1865 that troops would arrive 
in Galveston to free the final 250,000 people 
enslaved there. Most left the area despite a 
message from Union troops that they could 
stay and work for their owners as employees. 
A few months later, in December 1865, the 
13th Amendment to the Constitution was 
ratified and abolished slavery. 
Where is it celebrated? 
Like most holidays, Juneteenth is recog-
nized in gatherings across the country, pre-
dominantly in the Black community. With 
the help of social media to spread awareness 
on a holiday not always taught in school, it 
has become more mainstream in recent 
years. 
Celebrations can include reflections, pa-
rades, food and drink, music—and even advo-
cacy. 
For instance, in 2016, Opal Lee of Texas, a 
now 94-year-old activist, walked from her 
home in Fort Worth to the nation’s capital 
in an effort to get Juneteenth named a na-
tional holiday. 
It was in 1979 that Texas became the first 
state to officially establish Juneteenth as an 
official holiday. Now, 49 states and the dis-
trict separately recognize the day, with 
South Dakota as the only outlier, despite 
legislative attempts earlier this year. 
What’s next? 
The legislation has passed just in time for 
the holiday Saturday. Biden is scheduled to 
sign the bill into law Thursday afternoon. 
Despite the bipartisan victory, advocates 
said they are still far from repairing the 
wounds from American slavery. 
Some point to HR 40, which specifically 
calls for the creation of a commission to 
study ‘‘and consider a national apology and 
proposal for reparations for the institution 
of slavery, its subsequent de jure and de 
facto racial and economic discrimination 
against African Americans, and the impact 
of these forces on living African Americans, 
to make recommendations to the Congress 
on appropriate remedies, and for other pur-
poses.’’ 
A version has been introduced in every leg-
islative session since 1989, but passed out of 
a House committee for the first time this 
year. 
‘‘We’re giving America the opportunity for 
redemption, for repair, for restoration, for 
also understanding the new America, which 
is so multicultural,’’ said lead sponsor, Jack-
son Lee, in April after it passed. 
That legislation is still awaiting a full 
House vote and is expected to face an uphill 
battle in the Senate. 
Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, another 
lead Democrat to sponsor the legislation 
making Juneteenth a federal holiday also 
highlighted in a tweet Wednesday that even 
with its passage, Republicans still attack 
critical race theory which would allow stu-
dents to study the roots of events, such as 
Juneteenth, in school. 
‘‘Even today, as conservatives try to erase 
history with their attacks on critical race 
theory and understanding the impacts of sys-
temic racism, we stand here acknowledging 
the truth. We will make #Juneteenth a fed-
eral holiday,’’ Markey said in the tweet. 
Speaking at a press conference earlier 
Wednesday in front of the Capitol, a group of 
lawmakers including Jackson Lee and other 
Democrats supportive of the Juneteenth leg-
islation said there is still work to be done. 
‘‘Of course today is not enough, there’s so 
much more work left to be done, but this is 
an important day because it is a piece of 
pavement on that path towards justice,’’ said 
Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn. ‘‘This is not a mo-
ment for complacency, this is a moment to 
rededicate ourselves to that work.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time.

FISCAL CRISIS FACING AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in solidarity with the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER), my 
good friend, to raise an important issue 
that my constituents, my friend from 
Pennsylvania 
and 
his 
constituents, 
and, frankly, constituents all over this 
country care about, and that is the 
state of the fiscal crisis facing our 
country right now. 
This is really not a Republican issue 
or a Democrat issue. All hardworking 
American taxpayers of all political per-
suasions should be concerned about the 
state of the fiscal mess that we face in 
our country: a $31 trillion national 
debt that is literally burying our chil-
dren and our grandchildren in a moun-
tain of debt. This is mortgaging our fu-
ture, and we need to get our fiscal 
house in order. 
The American taxpayer works hard 
for their income, and they deserve a 
government 
that 
lives 
within 
its 
means. That is why I am proud to 
stand shoulder to shoulder with my 
colleague Mr. SMUCKER, who will later 
highlight this issue of fiscal reckless-
ness and the need to tighten our belts 
and to live within our means so that 
we do not continue to put this burden 
on our children and our grandchildren. 
We need to stop the spending spree and 
live within our means. 
Just to highlight how serious this 
problem is, Madam Speaker, it is not a 
lack of tax revenue. The issue is not 
that we don’t tax the American people 
enough from Washington, D.C. The 
issue is that we are overspending. 
In fact, this year, the Federal Gov-
ernment has raised more revenue from 
taxes than in any period in history, and 
it is actually over a trillion dollars 
when you consider inflation, a trillion 
dollars more in tax revenue in infla-
tion-adjusted terms. 
The problem with our debt and def-
icit is not that we are taxing the Amer-
ican people too little. The problem is 
that we are living beyond our means, 
spending well beyond our means, and it 
is not only threatening the future fis-
cal solvency of our country. This over-
spending, this addiction to deficit 
spending, has delivered a historic 40- 
year high inflation crisis. It has cre-
ated excess demand. When combined 
with the constraints that this adminis-
tration has put on energy production, 
it is a classic supply-demand mis-
match, overspending creating excess 
demand, combined with constraining 
energy, a war on domestic energy pro-
duction constraining the supply. That 
supply-demand mismatch has pushed 
up prices. 
What is the result of that, Madam 
Speaker? It means the Federal Reserve 
must engage in a precipitous quan-
titative tightening process. It must 
raise interest rates fast. It must en-
gage in tightening monetary policy. 
What does that mean? Higher interest 
rates. And higher interest rates mean 
higher debt service costs. We have to 
pay higher interest on the national 
debt, which compounds the problem. 
The solution, Madam Speaker, for 
the fiscal policy policymakers, those of 
us in the Congress and the White House 
and the executive branch, is to start 
living within our means. Then and only 
then can we get our inflation crisis 
under control and the Federal Reserve 
can start lowering interest rates once 
again. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania for his lead-
ership in advocating for fiscal sanity in 
Washington and the restoration of fis-
cal responsibility. We need to exercise 
fiscal discipline and get this ship 
turned around. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

AMERICA MUST RESTORE FISCAL 
SANITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) is recognized 
for the remainder of the hour as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Kentucky, who 
truly is an expert on fiscal policy and 
truly understands the situation that 
we are in, in our country. 
We just simply cannot afford to con-
tinue down this path and expect that 
there will not be consequences: con-
sequences for us and, if not for us, cer-
tainly for future generations. At the 
least, we are mortgaging the future of 
our kids and our grandkids, and it is 
completely irresponsible. 
We just came back, all of us, to our 
districts. I can tell you, I spent most of 
the weekend out talking to people 
across the district, and they are very

concerned about the impact of this 
President’s policies and the policies of 
this Congress on their daily lives. I 
have constituents who are choosing 
each week whether they can buy gro-
ceries or whether they can buy gas for 
the car. 
I spoke just recently to one con-
stituent who had been out of the work-
force for about 10 years. This indi-
vidual, by the way, had 13 kids, which 
I thought was amazing, but he had been 
out of the workforce for 13 years and 
just took a job because he can no 
longer make ends meet because of the 
policies of this President and the rising 
prices that have been created by the 
policies of this administration. 
They are angry that the President 
had a White House party to celebrate 
the passage of the so-called Inflation 
Reduction Act. This celebration, of 
course, just recently was broadcast 
amid a backdrop of the plummeting 
stock market and upon the news just 
that morning of another month of 
record-high inflation. 
No matter how the President wants 
to talk about it, no matter how Demo-
crats want to talk about it, Madam 
Speaker, he says that inflation has lev-
eled off, but we are still at 8.5 percent 
above what prices were just 12 months 
ago. That is something we haven’t seen 
in our country for about 40 years. This 
was after Democrats and the President 
were saying this would be transitory 
inflation. 
You would think if we are in a hole, 
at some point, we would stop digging. 
Instead, the President and congres-
sional Democrats, while they are pat-
ting themselves on the back, continue 
to spend taxpayer dollars. 
Just last night, President Biden was 
on ‘‘60 Minutes,’’ arguing that he de-
serves some credit, again, for his fiscal 
policies while inflation is at another 
40-year high. 
The President speaks fiscal responsi-
bility, yet every action that he takes 
only balloons our debt and balloons our 
deficits. It is far past time for his 
wasteful inflationary spending agenda 
to come to an end. The American peo-
ple, the constituents in my district, 
can no longer afford the policies of this 
administration. 
Tonight, for the next 45, 50 minutes 
or so, I am proud to welcome some of 
my Republican colleagues, including 
fellow members of the House Budget 
Committee and others who share the 
deep concerns that were just outlined 
by Congressman BARR. You will be 
hearing from others their concerns 
about the fiscal state of our Nation and 
the trajectory that we are on. 
Over the next hour, we are going to 
take stock of this administration’s 
reckless budget agenda and some of the 
drastic consequences that we are hear-
ing about from our constituents. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE), 
who is a great member of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. We won’t 
argue tonight about which committee 
is the best committee. I serve on the 
Ways and Means Committee. But John 
is a dear friend of mine, a wonderful 
Member of Congress, and I am very, 
very proud to serve with him. I am 
proud to count him as a friend. He is 
doing a fabulous job as a member of 
that committee and Member of Con-
gress. 
I look forward to his insights on how 
the Biden administration’s policies 
have resulted in this record-high infla-
tion. I would like to hear what his con-
stituents are facing in the 13th District 
of Pennsylvania, which is directly adja-
cent to mine. I thank Dr. Joyce for 
joining us this evening. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for holding this important 
Special Order tonight on an issue that 
truly affects all Pennsylvanians and all 
Americans. 
I thank Representative SMUCKER, my 
colleague, who is a true leader and a 
fiscal conservative, for bringing this 
discussion to the United States Con-
gress. 
Yesterday afternoon, I conducted a 
survey in my weekly newsletter, ask-
ing respondents if, during the past 
year, the rising costs of gas and gro-
ceries had cut into their savings, a rel-
atively simple question. Eighty-nine 
percent of the responders said yes. 
Unfortunately, this is a sad reality. 
It is a sad reality in the American 
economy that has been decimated by 
President Biden’s failed tax-and-spend 
policies that put far-left gimmicks 
ahead of the needs of the American 
people. 
During the Biden administration, at 
a time when small businesses across 
our country were begging for workers, 
we saw legislation that paid workers to 
remain at home. We saw the govern-
ment mandates that had no basis in 
science, policies that did not account 
for natural immunity, policies that 
forced highly skilled workers to leave 
their jobs, which, unfortunately, again, 
helped to cripple our supply chains. 
During the Biden administration, we 
saw the so-called infrastructure bill 
that spent more money bailing out 
windmills and solar farms and did 
nothing on fixing roads and bridges. We 
saw the poorly named Inflation Reduc-
tion Act, which the Congressional 
Budget Office says will increase our na-
tional deficit over the next few years. 
This is no time to throw a party cele-
brating these priorities as inflation 
continues to rise. This is no party situ-
ation. 
Time after time, we have witnessed 
an administration that cowers to the 
radical left and fails to consider that 
their own runaway spending has led to 
these soaring prices at the gas pump 
and at the grocery store. 
When I was seeing patients as a phy-
sician, one of the issues that I would 
stress to parents is how important it 
was for them to provide milk, whole 
milk, for their children’s growth, whole 
milk that supplies the necessary vita-
mins for bone development, brain de-
velopment, and muscle development. In 
the past year, the cost of milk has 
soared 17 percent. 
b 2030 
That 
kind 
of 
price 
hike 
is 
unsustainable, and no administration 
can take the health and well-being of 
Americans seriously while deliberately 
creating policies that make healthy 
choices, like whole milk, more expen-
sive for American families, more ex-
pensive for the parents who need to 
supply that for their growing children. 
The cost of eggs is up nearly 40 per-
cent, and the cost of food overall has 
risen more in the past year than at any 
time since 1979 when Jimmy Carter was 
President. 
To make matters even worse, real 
wages have gone down, and inflation 
has outpaced wage growth for the 17 
months that Joe Biden has been in the 
White House. 
The economic situation the Amer-
ican people find themselves in right 
now is unsustainable. In the second 
quarter of this year, household wealth 
in the United States fell by $6.1 tril-
lion—a record drop that has left fami-
lies unable to pay for the everyday ex-
penses that they face. 
As I traveled through my district in 
August—like 
my 
colleague, 
Mr. 
SMUCKER, spoke about—I talked to a 
mother who told me that she was mak-
ing difficult decisions, decisions on 
whether to buy the necessary groceries 
for her family, for her children’s 
lunches or put gasoline in the family 
car. No American should be making 
those decisions. 
The record inflation that has put par-
ents and families in this position is the 
result of failed policies that have wast-
ed taxpayer dollars and flooded our 
economy with too much cash while si-
multaneously killing the supply chain 
and causing shortages throughout the 
market. 
When we look at the liberal partisan 
legislation passed this past year, we 
see laws that choose winners and los-
ers. 
So let’s take stock. 
By handing out tax breaks for pur-
chasing an electric vehicle and by of-
fering money to companies who put up 
solar farms that fail to produce base-
load power, the Biden administration 
has sent a clear signal to Pennsylva-
nia’s energy producers that they are 
not valued by Washington liberals. 
By canceling the Keystone XL pipe-
line and putting a halt on new drilling 
leases, Joe Biden has made one thing 
clear: He has no interest in lowering 
gas prices. He has no interest in low-
ering energy prices. 
Instead of pivoting to failed tech-
nologies like wind and solar that can-
not be stored and that can only be used 
during peak hours, we need to return to 
the energy sources that are under the 
feet of my constituents in Pennsyl-
vania: the coal, the natural gas, the 
oil, the Marcellus shale that can help

to return our Nation to a position of 
energy dominance. 
After dismantling nuclear energy, 
Europe is facing the worst energy crisis 
in a generation. By signing pro-Green 
New Deal legislation, President Biden 
seems intent on making the same mis-
take—the same mistake right here in 
the United States. 
Digging out of that hole that Presi-
dent Biden and the far-left Members of 
Congress created will take some hard 
work, and it is time for Congress to 
stop the runaway spending on failed 
and untested programs. 
We need to stop giving taxpayer dol-
lars to Green New Deal priorities that 
only serve to hurt American families. 
Right now, our communities are 
counting on us. The schools in our dis-
trict are counting on us to get infla-
tion under control. The families in our 
district are counting on us to get this 
runaway inflation back under control. 
As President Biden creates crisis 
after crisis in our economy, one thing 
is very clear: We cannot spend our way 
out of the problems that the Biden ad-
ministration has orchestrated. 
We need to return to fiscal conserv-
atism and pass legislation that sup-
ports Pennsylvania families, American 
families, instead of burdening them 
with crushing inflation. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for holding this Special Order. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his words. It 
is clear that he is in touch regularly 
with his constituents and is hearing 
some of the same things that I have 
heard. 
The gentleman mentioned the real 
wage drop about $3,500 per family due 
to the policies of this administration. 
It is as if someone is taking a month’s 
worth of salary, and families have to 
do without that month of salary. 
By the way, that comes on the heels 
of policies under the previous adminis-
tration that led to—after decades of 
stagnation—a $6,000 average household 
increase in income. Which is more 
compassionate? The gentleman is ex-
actly right. We know the impact of 
these policies. We must stop. We must 
implement policies that work for the 
American people. That is why I was so 
frustrated. 
By the way, I have a news flash: 
Naming a bill something doesn’t mean 
it is so. Just recently, the Biden ad-
ministration and Democrats in Con-
gress passed the Inflation Reduction 
Act. Studies now are saying it will not 
impact inflation, it will most likely in-
crease inflation. 
Let’s just dig in on some of the poli-
cies that are included. $745 billion in 
new spending, over half of which is for 
the Green New Deal agenda. That in-
cludes $3 billion for, ‘‘environmental 
and climate justice warriors,’’ and $245 
billion in Department of Energy loans 
for other friends of the left. 
As gas prices increased 50 percent 
over the course of last year, President 
Biden’s solution was to raise taxes on 
American oil and gas producers. So we 
know that this will continue to affect 
constituents. They will continue to pay 
the higher price of gasoline at the 
pump. 
At this time, President Biden and 
congressional Democrats thought it 
would be a good idea to combat infla-
tion by offering tax credits for high- 
end electric vehicles. 
Now, 
interestingly 
enough, 
and 
maybe unsurprisingly, a lot of those 
electric vehicle manufacturers that 
were set to benefit from those new tax 
credits, immediately turned around 
and raised the prices of their vehicles, 
essentially wiping out the value of the 
credit. 
Another way they thought that ap-
parently would help inflation was to 
raise taxes on the middle class, includ-
ing $53 billion in new taxes on Main 
Street and $10 billion in taxes on those 
making less than $200,000 a year. Then, 
adding salt to the wound, the bill 
spends $80 billion for the IRS to hire 
87,000 new agents. 
By the way, any of us in our congres-
sional districts know that the IRS has 
a problem? I have talked to constitu-
ents in my district, who are still wait-
ing for refunds from 2019. 
So, I get that the IRS may need some 
additional funding to help to serve the 
American people better, but do you 
know there is 14 times as much money 
in this bill spent on increasing audits 
on everyday Americans, rather than 
improving—than the money that is in 
it for improving customer service there 
at the IRS? 
There is a CBO analysis. The Con-
gressional Budget Office that we all 
rely upon confirmed that those new 
agents will focus on extracting as 
many dollars as possible doing audits 
on the middle class, and despite the 
President’s claims, half of those audits 
will be on those making less than 
$400,000 a year. 
We could go on about this bill, and if 
we have a little more time maybe we 
will, but I am very pleased to yield to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CAR-
TER), who is a fellow member of the 
Budget Committee, passionate about 
fiscal issues here in our country. I al-
ways appreciate his fervor about these 
issues, and I am pleased to count him 
as a friend. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding, and I thank him for hosting 
this because this is extremely impor-
tant. I hope people are paying atten-
tion to this. 
As I say, what we are doing right now 
is intergenerational theft—$31 trillion 
in debt. That is intergenerational 
theft. In fact, Madam Speaker, by the 
time I am done speaking tonight just 
my part, the Federal debt will have 
grown by more than $13,000. That is 
right. I suspect I will take about 3 min-
utes, maybe 4, but during that time, 
the Federal debt will have grown by 
$13,000. 
We learned last week that August’s 
annual inflation rate was a staggering 
8.3 percent. By ‘‘we,’’ of course, I mean 
everyone except Joe Biden, who boast-
ed on 60 Minutes last night that infla-
tion has not spiked. If the worst infla-
tion numbers in 40 years isn’t a spike, 
I don’t know what is. 
Unfortunately for Mr. Biden, the 
numbers don’t lie. That 8.3 percent in-
flation is costing families well over 
$4,000 this year alone, essentially wip-
ing out one month’s paycheck. I don’t 
know a single family that can afford 
that kind of sacrifice. 
Worse, real wages have fallen every 
single month since President Biden’s 
$1.9 trillion stimulus passed last year. 
But it is not just today’s taxpayers 
that will feel these impacts. Genera-
tions from now, people will still be 
feeling the sting of Biden’s inflation 
crisis. Over the next decade, decisions 
made in Biden’s first 2 years will add 
$4.8 trillion to our Federal deficit—$4.8 
trillion. 
Decades of lower interest rates have 
spared the Federal Government from 
facing the true costs of borrowing at 
such high levels, but today’s inflation 
has forced the Federal Reserve to raise 
interest rates. We are quickly ap-
proaching a point where the interest 
alone on our Federal debt will over-
whelm our Federal budget resulting in 
dire economic effects. 
One percentage, one percentage of 
higher interest rates would cost the 
Federal Government $400 billion every 
year starting next year. Just 1 percent 
rise in the interest rate costs the Fed-
eral Government $400 billion in extra 
interest. That is on top of what we are 
paying already. That is money we 
could 
spend 
on 
national 
defense, 
healthcare, and other of the many pri-
orities our Nation faces. 
But instead, we are paying interest 
on our debt. Interest payments will 
pass defense spending by the end of the 
decade. They will pass Medicare by 2046 
and Social Security by the midpoint of 
the century. 
As the Federal Reserve continues to 
raise interest rates to combat infla-
tion, which will likely happen again 
this week, this only gets worse. This, 
again, is intergenerational theft. 
Every year we add more than four 
times the entire U.S. population to our 
national debt. The time to act is now. 
We are stealing from our children and 
our grandchildren and deferring a crisis 
for them to fix. We must act. 
Each year that goes by without in-
creased deficits digs ours hole deeper 
and deeper. It is time to put down the 
shovel. 
One of the first thing I learned when 
I became a member of the Georgia 
State legislature was when you are in a 
hole, quit digging. We are in a hole. We 
are stealing from our children and our 
grandchildren and deferring a crisis for 
them to fix, and we must act. 
As a medical professional by train-
ing, I am well acquainted with the Hip-
pocratic oath, which famously says: 
‘‘First, do no harm.’’ 
Congress must take a similar ap-
proach when it comes to our budget.

Congress doesn’t control interest rates, 
but we can control how much money is 
added to our national debt. Responsible 
fiscal policy that balances our budget 
is the first step to walking away from 
the fiscal cliff over which our chil-
dren’s children are already dangling. 
President Biden’s budget calls for $1 
trillion in deficit spending every year 
going forward. Again, that is money we 
do not have and cannot continue pre-
tending like we do. 
Republicans must insist on reining in 
this spending. That means no more 
trillion-dollar packages that pour fuel 
on the fire of inflation. That means 
eliminating our deficit so we can pay 
off our outsized debt. That means re-
turning the budget process to regular 
order. 
You know, Washington Democrats 
recently passed the Inflation Reduction 
Act, or as I like to call it, the inflation 
acceleration act. Because this bill did 
not go through regular order, there was 
a grave oversight that threatens a $5.5 
billion electric vehicle plant that is set 
for construction in my district. It has 
put it in jeopardy. This highlights just 
how important it is that bills go 
through regular order. If we had had a 
committee markup on this, we could 
have caught it. If we had vetted it—one 
of my favorite sayings is that none of 
us are as smart as all of us. That is 
why all of us should be involved in this. 
The same logic applies to budgeting. 
If we don’t give our Members the abil-
ity to read, debate, and amend legisla-
tion, we end up with policies and pro-
posals and budgets that hurt the same 
people they purport to help. 
When we miss budget deadlines, we 
are breaking the law. In what world 
does it make sense for a legislative 
body to routinely break Federal law, 
the laws we wrote and passed? 
b 2045 
Small business owners and families 
have to make a budget and they have 
to stick to it. It is time to restore fis-
cal discipline in Washington, D.C. It is 
time to balance our budget. 
Again, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding to me, and I thank him for 
hosting this. This is important. I don’t 
know what it is going to take to get 
people’s attention short of a catas-
trophe, but I do know this: we cannot 
continue. We cannot continue on the 
route in which we are right now. This 
is intergenerational theft. We cannot 
leave this to our children and our 
grandchildren. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Georgia for 
his comments. He has identified the 
problem and has some real solutions on 
how we can address this and how we 
can save the future for our kids and 
our grandkids. One of the saddest 
things about this is that the idea of the 
American Dream is that every genera-
tion can do better than their parents 
and their parents before them, and we 
have seen that for centuries here in the 
United States. That is at risk because 
of the fiscal policies that are in place 
here today. 
I look forward to working with my 
friend, and we hope that the next Con-
gress will be the Congress when we can 
begin to put this country on the right 
path. 
Madam Speaker, I welcome our next 
speaker tonight, the next participant is 
my friend and fellow Pennsylvanian, 
FRED KELLER, from the 12th District in 
Pennsylvania. 
Mr. KELLER plays an important role 
in oversight of the Biden administra-
tion as a member of the Education and 
Labor Committee as well as the Over-
sight and Reform Committee. I count 
him as a great friend and look forward 
to his thoughts tonight on what we are 
talking about, the administration’s 
flawed understanding or lack of under-
standing of the impact of inflation on 
Pennsylvanians. We see it every day. 
He will discuss budget principles that 
can help us right our fiscal ship. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania, my friend and colleague. Our 
history goes back a little farther than 
before we knew each other, and that is 
to Lancaster County. I worked for a 
business headquartered in Lancaster 
County that taught me a lot of things. 
It taught me how to budget, it taught 
me how to look out for the future and 
plan, and it taught me how to listen. I 
think that is the thing that we do best 
when we are representing the people 
who sent us here to do their work. 
During President Biden’s interview 
with 60 Minutes, that marked the first 
on-air, sit-down interview between the 
President and an American journalist 
in 7 months. It is abundantly clear why 
his handlers have been keeping him 
away from the cameras. He is com-
pletely out of touch with the American 
people. He can tell us stories about 
when he was in Scranton. That was 
back in the seventies. I was 8 years old 
when he came to Washington, D.C. So 
he can tell us stories from before I was 
8 years old. 
But he has been here for 50 years. He 
ought to remember that the last time 
we had this kind of inflation, President 
Reagan was leading our great Nation 
out of the disaster of the Carter years. 
It looks like President Biden has failed 
to learn from that history because 
those who fail to learn from history are 
condemned to repeat it. Unfortunately, 
the President is forcing all of us to re-
peat that history of runaway inflation. 
During 
his 
interview, 
President 
Biden pushed back when pressed about 
inflation soaring to record highs argu-
ing that the month-to-month inflation 
rate has remained steady at 8.3 percent 
compared to 1 year ago. I guess we are 
supposed to say thank you. But thank 
you doesn’t put gas in the car, thank 
you doesn’t put food on the table, and 
thank you doesn’t make sure that fam-
ilies can save for their children’s edu-
cation. 
Keep in mind, Madam Speaker, this 
is the same President who told the 
American people inflation was transi-
tory. So I don’t know if he means it is 
going to come back worse than it is 
now or what he is thinking. But now he 
is spiking the football and taking cred-
it for persistent inflation not getting 
worse. That is interesting. It is not 
getting worse. It is almost like some-
body who lights one house on fire and 
then takes credit for the house next 
door not catching on fire. 
I just can’t understand it. The Presi-
dent can try and spin the narrative on 
inflation all he wants. But last night 
Americans 
watched 
the 
President 
speak, and they got a glimpse into the 
future of our country if Washington 
Democrats remain in control. 
The reality is that inflation is at a 
record high. American families are 
making tough decisions about their 
budgets, decisions that President Biden 
hasn’t had to make since 1973 when he 
started collecting his check from the 
taxpayers. But the people for whom he 
works are having to make those deci-
sions. 
Hardworking Americans deserve real 
answers on how their government plans 
to reduce inflation, not just maintain 
historically high levels of it. Wash-
ington Democrats can’t give the Amer-
ican people straight answers because it 
is their policies that have put us in 
economic turmoil. 
Republicans have a plan, and my col-
leagues so very well laid it out here be-
fore me: regular order and making sure 
that every person’s Representative and 
every State senator has input on the 
legislation. 
The Republican Study Committee 
produced a budget that would balance 
in 7 years. Think about that: a bal-
anced budget. That is what all the fam-
ilies have to do who are living through 
these disastrous policies of President 
Biden and the Democrats that have 
caused them to lose 1 month’s income. 
Think about that, Madam Speaker, 
8.3 percent inflation. It is not a hard 
equation. I can write it on a chalk-
board for the President. One divided by 
12 is 8.3. So you have 1 year, there are 
12 months in the year, that is 8.3. It is 
not a hard equation, although they 
don’t have a problem spending money. 
President Reagan used to say that 
you can’t accuse them of spending like 
a drunken sailor because at least the 
sailor is spending his own money. 
What they are spending is not their 
money. They are spending our chil-
dren’s money. They are robbing the fu-
ture from our children. Talk about tax-
ation without representation, regular 
order needs to be restored. 
When we talk about the plan we have 
for balancing the budget, we are talk-
ing about elimination of waste and to 
stop leaving a financial disaster for the 
next generation. Those are the issues 
that really matter to the American 
people whom we all come here to rep-
resent, 
the 
hardworking 
men 
and 
women who have worked their entire

life and those who get up and go to 
work every day to earn a living to sup-
port their family. 
I am committed to fighting for what 
they believe is important, not what the 
Democrats and the President inside the 
Beltway think is important. His poli-
cies are creating an issue with people 
being able to take care of their family 
and realizing the American Dream. 
Madam Speaker, when you look at 
the energy policy, when you look at 
the massive spending, and when you 
look at the President standing in Inde-
pendence Hall telling us that half the 
American people aren’t good, that is 
not how you lead a nation. That is not 
how you be responsive. 
Quite frankly, how we be responsible 
is we listen, and we include the people 
in the solutions and in the discussions, 
and we work to make sure that Amer-
ica is strong and safe and that our chil-
dren have a bright future. That is our 
job, and I am committed to making 
sure that I help all my colleagues here 
in Congress achieve that goal. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his wonderful 
comments. 
One of the things that is most frus-
trating about this is not only, as the 
gentleman just mentioned, the admin-
istration doesn’t seem to understand 
the impact of their policies that have 
led to these rising prices and the pain 
that he is causing for people in our dis-
tricts. 
Mr. KELLER. Excuse me. If I may 
jump back in. 
I don’t think he could do this by acci-
dent. Even to get things this bad, I 
don’t know that you can do it by acci-
dent, quite frankly. It is an assault on 
American energy, and it is an assault 
on American jobs. I just wonder what 
is going to happen when somebody has 
an electric vehicle, they get home from 
a long day’s work, they are told they 
can’t charge their vehicle, and their 
child needs to be rushed to the doctor 
or the hospital. 
When my son was 3 years old, he had 
an accident. We got him to the hos-
pital, and they life flighted him to the 
trauma center. If we had run out of 
gas, he would have died. 
So do you know what, Madam Speak-
er, I think maybe they need to think 
about Americans and Americans’ prior-
ities which is their family and what it 
means to have the American Dream. I 
have benefited from living the Amer-
ican Dream. A kid as poor as I was 
would have been labeled disadvantaged 
or at risk, but we didn’t let our govern-
ment label us or anyone else. We 
worked hard, and we realized the 
American Dream. I just want that to 
be alive and well for future genera-
tions. 
So I will stop pontificating. I really 
appreciate the opportunity to be here 
this evening. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for being here. 
We talked about what they have re-
ferred to as the Inflation Reduction 
Act. I think a better title for it is the 
Expensive Attempt to Distract Voters 
Act. We know the bill will not cut the 
deficit, and we know CBO has said that 
the bill will have a tiny effect on infla-
tion. Penn Wharton Institute in my 
State estimates that the bill would in-
crease inflation this year and next. 
So how can you call a bill Inflation 
Reduction Act if it doesn’t actually de-
crease inflation? 
Then shortly after that, in fact, just 
8 days later, you would think at some 
point, Madam Speaker, the President 
would stop the spending spree and that 
at some point there would be a connec-
tion made with all of the spending, the 
rising deficits and debt, and the rising 
prices. 
But what did the President do just 8 
days later? 
He unilaterally—we think unconsti-
tutionally—but 
unilaterally 
spent 
more than half a trillion dollars on 
blanket student loan forgiveness, much 
of which went to high-income earners. 
Madam Speaker, $500 billion, that is 
half a trillion dollars. One constituent 
in my district went out and talked to 
some workers in a foundry, and you 
should have heard what they said 
about this bill, Madam Speaker. 
One of them said: Why should I or 
why should a plumber need to pay the 
tuition and the debt for a medical stu-
dent, maybe a graduate medical stu-
dent? 
They are angry that they are being 
asked. They are working hard every 
day trying to deal with the rising 
prices, trying to make ends meet, 
going back to work out of retirement, 
and then the President comes along 
and says: We are going to ask you to 
pay for the 16 percent of Americans 
who have student debt. 
It makes absolutely no sense to them 
and makes no sense when you are try-
ing to implement fiscal policies that 
will tackle the rising prices and help 
the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I welcome my next 
friend and colleague who is a fellow 
member of the House Budget Com-
mittee, Mr. JAY OBERNOLTE of Cali-
fornia. Mr. OBERNOLTE also serves on 
the Natural Resources and Science, 
Space, and Technology Committees. 
We spent some time earlier this year 
down at the border, which is another 
catastrophe I don’t think we are going 
to be talking about tonight, but he has 
been a wonderful Member of Congress. 
It has been great getting to know my 
friend, and I appreciate his being here 
this evening. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Member for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I stand deeply con-
cerned today about the state of our 
economy. Last week, the Department 
of Labor released the latest statistics 
for inflation in the United States. It 
shows that inflation continues to occur 
here at a rate above 8 percent, a 40- 
year high. 
Even more alarmingly, the Depart-
ment of Labor says that core inflation 
has increased in August over the 
month of July and that real wages 
have 
declined 
3.4 
percent 
on 
an 
annualized basis. 
What that means is that my con-
stituents cannot buy the same quan-
tity of the things that they need this 
year as they could last year, even if 
they got a raise for the labor that they 
produced. 
Madam Speaker, every single day I 
hear of constituents who are desperate 
because of the results of this inflation. 
Imagine my embarrassment when I 
have to tell them that inflation was 
caused by actions of their own Federal 
Government. Economists already an-
swered why we are experiencing this 
inflation. It is a combination of several 
things. 
b 2100 
As our economy emerges from the 
pandemic, there has been an increased 
demand for goods and services, and a 
constrained supply chain which re-
stricts our ability to respond to that 
increased demand. An economist will 
say that will make prices go up. 
The other thing that has occurred is 
that this Federal Government has 
dumped almost $5 trillion of excess 
government spending into our economy 
over the last 18 months—$5 trillion. To 
give you an idea of how big that num-
ber is in context, normally our Federal 
Government only spends about $5 tril-
lion in a given year. So we are increas-
ing government spending by a rate of 
almost double that of the normal rate. 
Madam Speaker, when that occurs, you 
put even more pressure on goods and 
services, and that causes prices to in-
crease further. 
Earlier this year, the San Francisco 
branch of the Federal Reserve Bank 
wondered why inflation was so much 
worse here in the United States than 
that experienced by other countries, 
particularly in Europe. They did a 
study and several months ago they re-
leased the results of this study, and 
their findings were stark. They said 
that deficit government spending is at 
the root cause of why inflation is so 
much worse here in the United States 
than it is in other countries. 
Madam Speaker, when the actions of 
government result in people paying 
more—that is called a tax. Inflation in 
the United States represents an unseen 
tax paid by every single American fam-
ily. Unfortunately, this is a tax that is 
borne disproportionately by those who 
can least afford to pay it—the impover-
ished and the working poor in this 
country. 
I have an even deeper concern this 
evening, 
Madam 
Speaker. 
Several 
weeks ago the Congressional Budget 
Office released their long-term fiscal 
forecast in which they analyze the fi-
nances of the United States over the 
next 30 years. They do this every year, 
and Congress, frankly, never pays at-
tention. Madam Speaker, Congress and

September 19, 2022 
the American people need to start pay-
ing attention to what the CBO has to 
say. 
The CBO says that our current na-
tional debt stands at over $30 trillion. 
If you do the math, that is over $90,000 
for 
every 
single 
American 
man, 
woman, and child—over $90,000 each— 
and that is today. 
The CBO says that right now our 
Federal Government runs a deficit of 
about 30 percent of all Federal spend-
ing. That represents about 4 percent of 
our gross domestic product. At the end 
of the forecast period, the CBO says 
that our deficit will nearly triple to 11 
percent of our GDP. 
At that time, just paying interest on 
the national debt will eclipse all of our 
Federal spending on Social Security. It 
will eclipse all of our Federal spending 
on Medicare. In fact, it will become the 
single largest expenditure of Federal 
Government, requiring over half of all 
Federal tax revenue to pay—over half. 
That is under the current fiscal condi-
tions. 
Ironically, the Federal Reserve Bank 
is being forced to raise interest rates as 
a result of the inflation that this Fed-
eral Government has caused. Every 
time the Fed takes the action that 
they are likely to take this week in 
raising the discount rate by three- 
quarters of a point, it increases the 
cost of our interest payments on our 
national debt by $180 billion a year, 
which makes the problem even worse. 
In fact, the CBO says that if the Fed-
eral Reserve is forced to raise interest 
rates by 3 percentage points—and we 
know that they have already gotten to 
about halfway there—that by the end 
of their forecast period, just paying in-
terest on the national debt will con-
sume over 100 percent of Federal tax 
revenues. 
In other words, Madam Speaker, we 
won’t even have enough money to pay 
the interest on the debt that we have 
rung up. That is unacceptable. This 
should be something that everyone in 
this Chamber is talking about because 
what the CBO says is that sometime in 
the next 30 years there will come a day 
of reckoning. The sooner it comes, the 
less painful it will be. It will be painful 
no matter what we do, but if we wait it 
will be extremely painful. 
Madam Speaker, we must get our fis-
cal house in order. The only way to 
solve this problem is to reduce our 
habit of deficit spending. Now, I know 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle like to say this is an easily solved 
problem. The problem is that we don’t 
tax Americans enough. Well, the CBO 
had an answer to that, too. 
They said that over the next 30 years, 
in their forecast period, average Fed-
eral tax revenues will be over 18 per-
cent. That is a substantial increase 
over the current Federal tax revenue 
over the last 50 years. In other words, 
Madam Speaker, what we have is not a 
revenue problem, we have a spending 
problem. The only way we can get this 
problem under control is to reduce our 
Federal spending and control our def-
icit. 
Madam Speaker, almost every year 
in this Chamber multiple bills are in-
troduced attempting to impose a bal-
anced budget requirement—sometimes 
within our House rules, sometimes 
within our Federal Constitution. I, my-
self, 
introduced 
a 
balance 
budget 
amendment last year in this Chamber. 
We try to do it in a responsible way 
that won’t disrupt the economy. We do 
it over a 5-year phase-in period. We 
allow for periods of fiscal emergency to 
be declared in which the President, 
with the concurrence of Congress, can 
override the requirement that the Fed-
eral budget be balanced in times of 
warfare and times of economic crisis. 
Madam Speaker, we must pay atten-
tion to this problem. We must balance 
our Federal budget. If we do not, not 
only us but our children will pay the 
terrible consequence. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his wonderful 
comments outlining the problem that 
we are faced with here. It sounds like 
we are up here criticizing the adminis-
tration—and certainly we are—but it is 
far beyond that. I think to address a 
problem, whether it seems like an ab-
stract problem or something that will 
happen in the future—to address the 
problem we must first understand it 
and recognize that the problem exists. 
The policies of this administration do 
not seem to understand that there is a 
real crisis up ahead if we don’t take 
steps now to change the trajectory. 
Madam Speaker, I have a chart here 
beside me—and a few of the other 
speakers have mentioned this tonight— 
the amount of spending that this ad-
ministration has incurred above the $4 
to $5 trillion that we spend in the Fed-
eral Government every year—this is an 
outline of the major policies, starting 
with the American Rescue Plan and on 
and on. Student debt is the most re-
cent. $4.8 trillion in less than 2 years in 
office—$4.8 trillion. 
It seems like the response of this ad-
ministration to every problem is just 
to throw money at it, and it is money 
we don’t have. The response is to print 
money and to take money to spend the 
money of our future generations. He 
did this with the American Rescue 
Plan—$1.9 trillion. 
At that time, Democrat economist 
Larry Summers said that was the 
worst macroeconomic policy and a mis-
take that would end in double-digit in-
flation. He ended up being exactly 
right on that. 
His response to helping veterans re-
covering from burn pits, which was 
once a strong bipartisan policy that I 
was proud to support—but his response 
was to throw $667 billion in new man-
datory spending at the problem, ignor-
ing bipartisan alternatives that were 
responsibly paid for and doubling the 
fiscal impact of the VA in the process— 
$4.8 trillion in less than 2 years in of-
fice. 
So why are we talking about this to-
night? Why are some—more and more— 
a growing number of Members in Con-
gress concerned about this? Is there 
any hope? I would say that despite the 
current fiscal challenges that we face, 
hope is not lost. We can ensure that 
America’s best days still lie ahead. I 
am optimistic that we can do that in 
Congress.

Is there any hope? I would say that, 
despite the current fiscal challenges 
that we face, hope is not lost. We can 
ensure that America’s best days still 
lie ahead. I am optimistic that we can 
do that in Congress. 
Wouldn’t that be great if we look 
back 20 years from now and were able 
to say that that was the Congress that 
began to change America and that 
saved the future of America? We can do 
it if we decide that is what we will do. 
We simply cannot afford the contin-
ued spending policies of this adminis-
tration. We can’t afford to continue on 
this destructive, wasteful path. We 
can’t afford to delay and to kick the 
can down the road. 
We need to begin to seriously recom-
mit to fiscal responsibility by mean-
ingfully reducing spending and reduc-
ing deficits while investing in policies 
that ensure growth. We need to reject 
any increases to mandatory spending. 
Several other speakers mentioned 
this tonight, but we have budget rules 
in Congress that have simply been ig-
nored for decades. We need to enforce 
our own budget rules that this body set 
for itself and set for the Federal Gov-
ernment and not simply look the other 
way as we routinely pass bills increas-
ing spending, increasing mandatory 
spending, by billions of dollars. 
There is a measure of our total debt 
that I think is worth looking at. Com-
pare it to our total economic output as 
a Nation or the gross domestic product. 
Currently, we are at about 130 percent. 
Our debt is 130 percent of GDP. 
That is projected to increase, as far 
as we can project at this point, about a 
trillion—we are 30 trillion now—in-
crease over a trillion per year under 
the policies of this administration and 
previous administrations. That debt 
will eclipse 185 percent of GDP by 2052 
on the current path. 
We know how it ends. Every country 
in history that has spent more money 
than it had, that has overtaxed and 
overspent, has failed. It doesn’t end 
well. 
While we may think this is a problem 
far in the future that future genera-
tions can take care of, at some point, 
we will see the devastating impact if 
we don’t change the trajectory. 
If we don’t reverse course, we risk 
the full faith and credit of the United 
States, which would put us under 
threat of a sovereign debt crisis and 
economic fallout that we have seen 
elsewhere in nations across the world. 
It will take discipline. It will take re-
ducing our spending. It will take in-
vesting in progrowth policies similar to 
those that we implemented just a few

I appreciate the comments of a num-
ber of my colleagues here. I appreciate 
the interest in this crisis. It truly is a 
crisis. 
I look forward to working with my

forward-thinking 
budget 
next 
Congress that reduces Federal spend-
ing, implements those progrowth poli-
cies, and puts our country back to a 
sustainable fiscal future. 
We can do it, and we must do it for 
future generations. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER

INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Last week, the 
American people received yet another 
absolutely 
crushing—crushing—infla-
tion report. More than a year after 
Washington Democrats’ policies set off 
the worst overall inflation in 40 years, 
the prices of some of the most essential 
items for working families are sky-
rocketing at their fastest rates in a 
generation. 
Electricity costs are rising faster 
than they have since 1981, and grocery 
inflation has eclipsed a high from 1979. 
Parents trying to put food on the table 
are now contending with annual price 
hikes of 16.2 percent for a loaf of bread, 
17 percent for a gallon of milk, and 40 
percent more for a dozen eggs. 
Now, the very same day this painful 
news broke, just a few hours later, 
Washington Democrats threw a party 
for themselves on the White House 
lawn, celebrating their economic poli-
cies. 
You really can’t make this stuff up. 
The official numbers had just con-
firmed that American families have 
seen the single worst year for both food 
and electricity inflation since the fall-
out from Jimmy Carter. And the 
Democrats’ response was to throw 
themselves 
a 
party—a 
party—for 
spending hundreds of billions of dollars 
more, raising taxes, and making work-
ing-class Americans pay off the loans 
of doctors and lawyers. 
You might think the Biden adminis-
tration couldn’t possibly get any more 
out of touch. You would think that 
kind of display would have to take the 
cake. But alas, last night, on ‘‘60 Min-
utes,’’ President Biden gave an almost 
comically out-of-touch interview on 
the inflation crisis. 
The 
President 
argued—with 
a 
straight face—that the American peo-
ple ought to be grateful for last 
month’s terrible inflation report be-
cause it could have been even worse. 
Here was a quote: 
Guess where we are? We’re in a position 
where, in the last several months, [inflation] 
hasn’t spiked. 
Struggling Americans are supposed 
to be grateful that we have plateaued 
at a steady ongoing inflation rate of 
more than 8 percent? The President 
wants a round of applause for steadily 
clocking month after month after 
month of the worst inflation in 40 
years? 
The inflation rate plateauing does 
not mean that prices themselves have 
leveled off. It means that prices are

September 19, 2022 
still steadily climbing all the time, at 
a historically fast pace, the worst in a 
generation. 
Month after month after month, 
Democrats’ policy failures are con-
tinuing to add inflation on top of infla-
tion. The inflation rate plateauing 
above 8 percent does not mean that 
families are catching a break. It means 
exactly the opposite. It means that 
families are continuing to see prices go 
up and up and up all the time. 
Simply surviving, just getting by, in 
Washington Democrats’ economy costs 
8.3 percent more than it did a year ago, 
but remember, the 12-month numbers 
now dramatically understate the dam-
age the Democrats have done because 
it only looks back 1 year, when Demo-
crats’ inflation spiral was already up 
and running. 
Here is the number that really mat-
ters. Since the day that President 
Biden was sworn in, since the day that 
this one-party Democratic government 
took power, our country’s inflation 
rate has been—listen to this—13.2 per-
cent. 
And 
according 
to 
President 
Biden, if you are angry about that, if 
parents are upset, if workers are frus-
trated, they just aren’t putting things 
in proper perspective. 
Considering 
the 
American 
people 
give President Biden a 38-percent ap-
proval rating on his handling of the 
economy, I would say it is the White 
House that needs to get some perspec-
tive, not the working people of this 
country. 
And get this: When President Biden 
was asked how we can avoid a reces-
sion, since Democrats’ policies have 
forced the Fed to raise their rates 
sharply, the President doubled down on 
his fantasyland. He suggested: 
[W]e’re growing the economy . . . it’s 
growing in . . . a way that it hasn’t in years 
and years. 
But, of course, that is complete non-
sense. You measure real GDP growth 
after inflation. From early 2017 until 
the beginning of the COVID pandemic, 
Republican policies had the economy 
humming along with robust growth, 
low unemployment, and low inflation— 
a great trifecta for the American peo-
ple. 
But now, with President Biden’s poli-
cies in place, we have seen two con-
secutive quarters of real GDP actually 
falling. Once you account for the infla-
tion that Democrats have caused, our 
economy is not growing at all. It is, in 
fact, shrinking. 
Families 
talk 
about 
the 
term 
‘‘shrinkflation’’ at the grocery store or 
the big-box store. That means not only 
have prices gone up, but the size of the 
package has gone down so you are both 
paying more and getting less. Like the 
size of a bag of chips or a box of cook-
ies or the number of sheets in a roll of 
toilet paper or the weight of a bag of 
fertilizer—higher prices, smaller quan-
tities. 
And this is basically what President 
Biden and Democrats have done to the 
entire U.S. economy. Everything costs 
more, even as the GDP is shrinking in 
real terms. Just like American families 
have seen their real wages plummet 
after inflation, the same thing has hap-
pened to the country as a whole for two 
quarters and counting. 
So the President might want to talk 
to a couple of working Americans who 
are trying to survive under his policies 
before he sits down for his next TV 
interview. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
MARK FRERICHS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 21⁄2 
years ago, a native of my home State 
of Illinois and a veteran of the U.S. 
Navy, Mark Frerichs, was abducted by 
the Taliban or one of its affiliates in 
Afghanistan. 
He was working there as a con-
tractor, and his disappearance was dev-
astating to his family back in Lom-
bard, IL. 
Senator DUCKWORTH and I have spent 
countless hours and staff hours work-
ing with his family trying to find out 
what happened to Mark. We spoke to 
his sister Charlene and repeatedly 
raised his case with both the Trump 
and Biden administrations. We wanted 
to let them know we cared, and we 
joined the family on that course. 
Well, today, the family’s prayers 
have been answered. The news was re-
leased that Mark is coming home. I 
want to commend President Biden, 
Secretary of State Blinken, and their 
teams for never giving up on Mark and 
ultimately securing his freedom. 
His sister Charlene said upon news of 
her brother’s release that ‘‘[w]e never 
gave up hope that he would survive and 
come home safely to us.’’ She was 
right. And Mark was so fortunate to 
have her as his steadfast champion. 
Welcome home, Mark Frerichs. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 2022 
Madam President, I listened to the 
comments that were just made by the 
Republican leader about events in 
Washington, the state of the economy, 
and it was interesting, the perspective 
he took. He was critical of President 
Biden for calling a meeting of several 
thousand supporters last week on the 
White House lawn from all over the 
United States to celebrate the passage 
of the Inflation Reduction Act here in 
the U.S. Senate and House. You know 
and I know there wasn’t a single Re-
publican vote in favor of the Inflation 
Reduction Act. Some 6 weeks ago, we 
did some things that, frankly, many of 
us had been hoping for for a long time 
without a single Republican vote sup-
porting it. 
The Senator from Kentucky won-
dered what we were celebrating. Well, 
let me tell him a few of the things we 
are celebrating. 
After years of candidates going out 
on the campaign trail and telling 
America that the cost of prescription 
drugs were too high, we finally did 
something 
about 
it—finally. 
After 
years of negotiating the price for drugs 
in the Veterans’ Administration so we 
could afford to give our veterans the 
very best, we applied the same stand-
ard to Medicare. What does it mean? It 
means that the most popular and most 
expensive drugs that are sold through 
Medicare to recipients over the age of 
65, we are now going to negotiate the 
prices to come up with a reasonable 
amount to charge taxpayers for those 
drugs. 
Well, if you wondered whether or not 
the pharmaceutical industry can han-
dle that kind of truth, I might remind 
people what they already know. Ex-
actly the same drugs in the same boxes 
are for sale in Canada at a fraction of 
the price that we pay in the United 
States. The same thing is true in Eu-
rope. And we said, once and for all, we 
are going to do something about it. I 
think that is something to celebrate. 
Let me tell you something else that 
is part of it too. We said that, from this 
point forward, when this bill takes ef-
fect, no recipient on Medicare will ever 
pay more than $2,000 a year for pre-
scription drugs—upper limit, ceiling, 
2,000 bucks. Do you know what these 
same people were faced with when it 
came to cancer drugs and other thera-
pies? Thousands and thousands of dol-
lars. And we brought it home to a 
level—which I wish we could have done 
more, but it is very important as well— 
and that is when it comes to diabetes. 
Millions of Americans suffer from dia-
betes or someone in their family does, 
and we said that if you are on Medi-
care, you won’t have to pay more than 
$35 for a dose of insulin—$35. That is a 
relief to a lot of people with diabetes in 
their family. Some of those people 
couldn’t afford insulin, couldn’t afford 
the doses they need, and they endan-
gered their life in the process. 
In addition to all of that, we, in this 
bill, did, in fact, address the Tax Code. 
The Senator from Kentucky said ear-
lier that we raised taxes. We did. Let 
me tell you who is going to pay more 
in taxes. If you own a corporation that 
over the last 3 years has had a net prof-
it, an average net profit, of $1 billion a 
year—1 billion—I am not asking for a 
show of hands—but if you had a net 
profit that averaged over $1 billion 
over the last 3 years, you have to pay 
a 
minimum 
corporate 
tax 
of—get 
ready—15 percent. Fifteen percent. 
Most Americans pay their taxes be-
lieving that is what the law requires, 
and many believe, as I do, that is the 
price of admission in America for a 
great 
nation. 
Fifteen 
percent—we 
would all welcome that rate. There are 
very few people at that rate. But to say 
that a corporation with a net profit on 
average of $1 billion a year over the 
last 3 years finally has to pay taxes in-
stead of escaping all tax liability—

guilty as charged. The Senator from 
Kentucky is right. We did that. Do you 
know the net result of it? The net re-
sult of it, it is going to reduce the def-
icit this year by $1.3 trillion. 
All this talk about the big spenders 
in Congress, the bill we put together 
for inflation reduction zeroed in on 
those two issues: capping the cost of 
prescription drugs for Medicare and 
making certain that corporations, prof-
itable corporations, pay their fair 
share of taxes just like every American 
family. Those two elements were not 
mentioned by the Senator from Ken-
tucky. It is understandable. But what I 
want to make clear is, we didn’t have a 
single Republican vote in support of 
what I have just given you. 
There is an additional section there 
that is controversial, but I feel strong-
ly about it. I think we are facing in 
this world today obvious evidence of 
extreme weather and changes that 
should alarm us. Yes, it is climate 
change. It is global warming. And what 
we did in this bill was to create incen-
tives for American families and cor-
porations to start taking steps toward 
responsible conduct. It is coming. It 
wasn’t a Federal mandate that re-
quired all the car companies to build 
electric vehicles. They see the writing 
on the wall. They realize we have to 
change the way that we energize trans-
portation in America, and they want to 
be in front of the parade, not behind it. 
So do we. That was part of this bill as 
well. I support it. Not a single Repub-
lican voted for it. That is the reality. 
Incidentally, inflation is a burden on 
American 
families 
and 
individuals. 
There is no doubt about it, and I am 
not going to sugarcoat it. We have seen 
some progress. For example, the price 
of gasoline stares us right in the face 
every time we drive right down the 
road. Well, I did some driving over the 
weekend, probably put 600 to 700 miles 
on the car in Illinois, driving around to 
various events, and I kept an eye out 
for the cost of gasoline. I don’t know 
what it is in Hawaii or in any home 
State, but I will tell you that in Mis-
souri, gasoline was selling for $3.13 a 
gallon; in Illinois, closer to $3.50 a gal-
lon. High? Yes. But not $5, which we 
faced just a few months ago. We have 
made some progress, and we need to 
continue to focus on reducing the cost 
of goods for families that they face 
every week. That is part of our mission 
as well. 
IMMIGRATION 
The last point I want to make is this. 
Madam President, there was a decision 
made by the Governor of Texas, Gov-
ernor Abbott, several weeks ago to 
start transporting people who were le-
gally in the United States but had just 
arrived from foreign countries on buses 
to various places around the country. 
Thousands of them were brought to 
Washington; thousands were brought to 
New York; and hundreds were brought 
to my city of Chicago that I represent. 
These were people who came to our 
borders and asked if they could be ad-
mitted as legal immigrants to the 
United States, and they passed the 
threshold test. But let me quickly add, 
it is a threshold test as to whether 
they have credible fear for their own 
personal safety. They still have to face 
an adjudication, and the majority of 
them are not likely to win that adju-
dication. The problem we face is very 
obvious: It is a long time before that 
adjudication takes place. What are 
these families supposed to do when 
they are here waiting? 
I went over to the Salvation Army 
rescue shelter on the West Side of Chi-
cago to meet with some of these fami-
lies and individuals who had been bused 
to Chicago by the Governor of Texas. I 
met one man, Carlos, and his family— 
his wife, his 5-year-old daughter, and 
his 
8-month-old 
daughter 
as 
well. 
Through the translators, they told me 
their story. They are from Venezuela. 
Venezuela is in a disaster situation. 
It is so dangerous that the United 
States warns travelers not to go to 
Venezuela, and the economy is so weak 
that the cost of living has gone up dra-
matically. Inflation there is even dra-
matically 
larger 
than 
the 
United 
States. 
Carlos reached a point that, even 
working as hard as he could, he 
couldn’t feed his family. So on May 15, 
he and his wife decided to pick up their 
children and try to make it to the bor-
der of the United States to try to find 
work. It took them 5 months, and they 
went 
through 
everything 
you 
can 
imagine; much of it on foot, and what 
travel they could find, they took ad-
vantage of. They were robbed, beaten 
up. They were pushed into a jungle sit-
uation in Panama where Carlos said, ‘‘I 
didn’t think we were going to live 
through the night.’’ It was that dan-
gerous. They did survive, and they fi-
nally made it, and now they are here in 
Chicago. 
I asked him what he wanted. He said, 
‘‘I just want to go to work. I will take 
any job.’’ 
What we are finding—and the front 
page story in the New York Times con-
firmed it—is that many of these people 
are needed. Yes, we have unemploy-
ment of 5 million in America, but we 
have 11 million jobs that need to be 
filled. Many of them are entry-level 
jobs, and it is hard to get anyone to 
take them. 
Last week, as well, I had the Illinois 
Farm Bureau come and see me. They 
started talking about their need for 
immigrant labor on the farms of Amer-
ica. 
Madam 
President, 
you 
probably 
know this from your own home State, 
but currently half of the agricultural 
workers in America who are working 
on the dairy farms, picking crops, 
doing things that are pretty hard work, 
half of them are undocumented. We 
don’t think twice about eating the 
fruits and vegetables that are the 
bounty of their work, but that is the 
reality. 
Our immigration system, at this 
point in time, is badly broken. We need 
to have legal immigration into the 
United States—controlled legal immi-
gration into the United States for work 
purposes. Many of these people who are 
arriving are desperately needed for jobs 
that Americans won’t fill. They don’t 
want to work picking crops, for exam-
ple, or on a dairy farm. A friend of 
mine who is a restaurateur in Chicago 
told me, if you removed all of the un-
documented workers from the res-
taurants of Chicago, you would just 
start closing them right and left. Be-
hind that screen door in your favorite 
restaurant are people working hard 
every single day who are undocu-
mented. 
We have to reach the point where we 
sit down in a bipartisan basis and do 
something about it. It was 8 years ago 
when we put together a comprehensive 
immigration reform bill. Democrats, 
DURBIN, SCHUMER—and I want to salute 
MICHAEL BENNET, who time and again 
has been able to come up with a good 
bipartisan approach to ag workers— 
and BOB MENENDEZ of New Jersey, we 
were on the Democratic part of the 
team of 8. On the Republican part, we 
had Senator McCain, Senator GRAHAM, 
Senator 
RUBIO, 
and 
then 
Senator 
Flake. 
We worked for months, put together 
a comprehensive bill, brought it to the 
floor of the Senate, and passed it with 
14 Republicans joining us. There were 
68 votes on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
for a bill that would have addressed the 
very issues we are facing today. The 
bill was then sent over, after it passed 
the Senate, to the House of Represent-
atives, and the Republican leader re-
fused to take up it or even call it. 
We had a chance, and we have to cre-
ate that chance again—comprehensive 
immigration reform. We shouldn’t do it 
at the expense of a poor family like 
Carlos’s family who came from Ven-
ezuela. I would say what the Governors 
of Arizona and Texas and Florida are 
doing now is to jeopardize the safety 
and the health of these families. That 
is not fair to them. It is not American. 
Putting them on buses and promising 
them, at the end of the journey, that 
there are going to be jobs waiting for 
them, for example, is just to mislead 
them. 
In addition, if these Governors were 
transporting these people in good faith 
to Chicago or New York or Wash-
ington, they would have the decency to 
tell us who is coming and when. They 
don’t. They put the buses on the road, 
and they stop at a train station and 
turn them all loose. Many of these peo-
ple know no one in those cities. We 
found recent evidence that some of 
them are in a position where they are 
taken away from where they are sup-
posed to report—legally report—in this 
country and sent hundreds and thou-
sands of miles away by these Governors 
for political reasons I can’t explain. 
That is not who we are. 
I do want to commend the Salvation 
Army, Catholic Charities, many of the 
charities in our area.

September 19, 2022 
WBEZ is our public radio station in 
Chicago. This was on their website: 
Chicago agencies and local groups tell mi-
grants ‘‘We are so glad you are here.’’ 
They are getting an American wel-
come. They are being treated decently. 
They are being treated with respect. 
Now, as we debate the politics of why 
they are here and whether they can 
stay, we shouldn’t do it at the expense 
of demonstrating clear American val-
ues of humanity and caring. That is 
who we are. We are not going to allow 
these kids to reach a situation like 
they have before and be the victims of 
our political debate. We don’t want 
kids in cages. We don’t want kids forc-
ibly removed from their parents. We 
don’t want them to suffer on these bus 
rides, not knowing where they are 
going to end up and what is going to 
happen to them next. We are better 
than that as Americans, and we are 
better than that as a nation of immi-
grants. 
I have said it on the floor many 
times, and I am proud to say it again: 
I am the son of an immigrant to this 
country. My mother came here at the 
age of 2 from Lithuania, brought with 
her the good luck that I could live my 
life and be part of the U.S. Senate and 
the governance of this Nation. We 
shouldn’t look beyond that. 
I will say the Presiding Officer holds 
a special place in the history of the 
Senate with her immigration status as 
well. 
If you look in any direction, you are 
going to find immigrants, sons and 
daughters of immigrants, who really 
have made America what it is today. 
Let’s get this right on a bipartisan 
basis. Let’s not waste any time. 
In the meantime, let us treat these 
people who are coming to our country 
and are now legally in the country 
with dignity and respect. 
I yield the floor.

SOLID START ACT OF 2021 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. As if in legislative session and 
under the previous order, the Senate, 
having received from the House the re-
turned papers with respect to S. 1198, 
the actions of the Senate on September 
8, 2022, are vitiated; the committee-re-
ported substitute is withdrawn; the 
Tester amendment at the desk, No. 
5505, is agreed to; the bill, as amended, 
is considered read a third time and 
passed; and the motions to reconsider 
are considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to 
consider (S. 1198) a bill to amend title

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
PUERTO RICO 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
today, my thoughts are with all our 
fellow Americans in Puerto Rico—and 
all communities across the Caribbean— 
battered by the destruction of Hurri-
cane Fiona. As of this morning, well 
over a million residents on the island 
remain without power, and two-thirds 
remain without running water. 
In a short while, I will get on the 
phone with the FEMA Administrator 
and urge that they be ready to approve 
temporary 100 percent Federal cost 
share for all emergency protective 
services that Puerto Rico conducts in 
the coming days. That means covering 
the island’s costs for distributing food 
and water, disaster operations, and 
emergency medical care. Right now, 
the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund has 
about $15 billion as of late last week— 
a fund we Democrats fought extremely 
hard to secure. 
I will also join with my colleagues in 
the New York delegation to send 
FEMA a letter calling on them to be 
ready to support Puerto Rico on any 
upcoming request for aid. 
Five years—almost exactly 5 years to 
the day—after Puerto Rico was dev-
astated by Hurricane Maria, the Fed-
eral Government has a responsibility 
to make sure we don’t repeat the mis-
takes of the previous administration. 
The Federal response should be swift, 
robust, and continued for as long as the 
island needs. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, now on judges, as 
we begin the third week of the work pe-
riod, the Senate presses ahead to con-
firm more of President Biden’s impres-
sive lineup of judicial nominees.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4813 
September 19, 2022 
This week, we will aim to confirm 
our sixth—yes, sixth—circuit court 
nominee of the month, and this one is 
especially important. It is to move for-
ward on Judge Florence Pan to serve as 
a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Cir-
cuit Court for the District of Columbia. 
After the Supreme Court, the DC 
Court of Appeals is the most important 
Federal court in the country, with ju-
risdiction over cases involving Con-
gress and executive branch Agencies. It 
goes without saying that those nomi-
nated to serve as jurists on this court 
must be individuals of the highest cal-
iber, of impeccable credentials, and 
must show deep fidelity to the Con-
stitution. 
The President couldn’t have done 
better than Judge Pan: a brilliant, ac-
complished, and truly bipartisan nomi-
nee. The Senate confirmed her to the 
DC district court with an overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan vote of 68 to 30. Since 
then, her conduct on the bench has vin-
dicated that margin. So I hope we can 
see similar bipartisan support this 
week. 
The daughter of Taiwanese immi-
grants, Judge Pan graduated from the 
University of Pennsylvania and earned 
her law degree from Stanford, where 
she wrote on the Law Review. 
As a judge for both the DC Superior 
Court and DC district court, she has 
seen practically every kind of legal dis-
pute under the Sun: criminal law, fam-
ily law, administrative law, consumer 
protection, immigration, employment 
law, and more. In short, she is a re-
markably qualified and experienced ju-
rist. 
So I urge my colleagues from both 
sides of the aisle to vote in favor of ad-
vancing this nominee. A seat on the DC 
Circuit deserves to be filled by a high- 
caliber 
and 
impartial 
jurist, 
and, 
thankfully, we have that in Judge Pan. 
TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 117–1 
Madam President, now on the Kigali 
treaty, besides working on judicial 
nominations, the Senate will also vote 
this week to advance a pair of criti-
cally important measures on the floor. 
First, we will vote tomorrow to pro-
ceed to the Kigali Amendment to the 
Montreal Protocol, an agreement from 
the 1980s that united much of the world 
in reducing the use of industrial chemi-
cals harmful to our ozone layer. Three 
decades later, this agreement has been 
an unqualified success. The Kigali 
Amendment is a golden opportunity to 
strengthen U.S. businesses and secure 
an edge against China in the emerging 
industry 
of 
next-generation 
refrig-
erants. 
Let me explain. It sounds a little 
complicated, but it is important. The 
Kigali Amendment, which has been ne-
gotiated by both Democratic and Re-
publican administrations, would build 
on the Montreal Protocols by affirming 
the U.S. commitment to phase out the 
use of a particularly dangerous chem-
ical known as hydrofluorocarbons, ab-
breviated commonly as HFCs. Though 
used only in small amounts in house-
hold appliances like refrigerators and 
air conditioners, they wreak havoc on 
our atmosphere. Many on both sides 
have long agreed we should transition 
away from their use. 
By ratifying the Kigali Amendment, 
businesses that specialize in the next 
generation of refrigerant technologies 
would see new markets open for them. 
In fact, one study suggests U.S. net ex-
ports could increase by $6 billion annu-
ally—$6 billion. So this is a projobs 
bill. 
Combined with previous measures to 
reduce HFCs, this step could help cre-
ate 150,000 new jobs here in the United 
States. All the while, we would get a 
much needed leg up on Chinese busi-
nesses that still lag behind—for now— 
in developing viable HFC alternatives. 
Failure to ratify the Kigali Amend-
ment would mean squandering billions 
in economic activity and potentially 
over 100,000 good-paying American jobs. 
The good news: This measure has 
broad support from the business com-
munity, including the Chamber of 
Commerce, the American Chemistry 
Council, the Semiconductor Industry 
Association, and many others. The 
same support should manifest itself 
here in the Senate. 
The first vote on cloture will require 
60 Senators to move forward. And be-
cause this is a treaty, we will then 
need the support of two-thirds of the 
Chamber to ratify. 
For the sake of U.S. businesses, U.S. 
innovators, and the sake of our climate 
and American dominance in emerging 
markets, I urge my colleagues from 
both sides to vote in favor of advancing 
and ratifying the Kigali Amendment. 
DISCLOSE ACT 
Madam President, finally on the DIS-
CLOSE Act, today, I am announcing 
the Senate will vote this week to take 
up a measure critical to fighting the 
cancer of dark money in our elections: 
the DISCLOSE Act. 
I have long promised to bring this 
bill to the floor, and I want to thank 
all my colleagues and in particular 
Senator WHITEHOUSE. He has done an 
amazing job documenting and pressing 
forward on trying to eliminate the evil 
scourge of dark money. He has been an 
amazing leader in championing this 
legislation. 
The DISCLOSE Act is premised on a 
simple idea: Americans deserve to 
know who is trying to influence their 
elections. 
Sadly, 
most 
Americans 
today are largely in the dark, thanks 
to the abominable decision in Citizens 
United handed down by the Supreme 
Court’s conservative majority. Their 
ruling has paved the way for billions in 
unlimited campaign contributions by 
Super PACs and other dark money 
groups over the last decade. Ordinary 
citizens, meanwhile, have had their 
voices drowned out by elites who have 
millions to spare for political dona-
tions. 
And the worst part? Much of this 
spending happens entirely in secret. 
That is not like a democracy. It is a 
veil cast over our democracy that must 
be ripped away once and for all. 
The DISCLOSE Act is simple. It 
would require Super PACs and other 
dark money groups to report anyone 
contributing $10,000 or more during an 
election. It would likewise require 
groups spending money on judicial 
nominees to disclose their donors too. 
There is no justification under Heaven 
for keeping such massive contributions 
hidden from the public. 
This week, Republicans are going to 
have to take a stand on whether they 
want to fight the power of dark money 
or allow this cancer to grow even 
worse. Limiting the power of dark 
money shouldn’t be a Democratic or 
Republican view; it should be bipar-
tisan through and through. 
I hope Republicans will join us, be-
cause Americans intuitively under-
stand that right now, there is a stench 
taking over our campaign finance law. 
After all, when was the last time any 
of us heard voters cheer on the spread 
of dark money? When was the last time 
any of us heard voters say it is better 
for billionaires and special interests to 
buy elections in secret rather than be 
held accountable to the public? Of 
course, they don’t think that unless 
they themselves are the ones cutting 
the multimillion-dollar checks. 
So this week, all of us will go on 
record on whether or not we think 
Americans deserve to know who is 
spending billions to sway our democ-
racy. It will be our chance to put into 
practice the famous saying by Judge 
Louis D. Brandeis that ‘‘sunlight is 
said to be the best disinfectant.’’ 
I 
once 
again 
commend 
Senator 
WHITEHOUSE for his years of leadership 
in fighting this wave of dark money, 
and I urge all my colleagues to support 
this measure this week. 
I yield the floor.

pore. The Senator from Texas. 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
when Attorney General Garland went 
through the confirmation process for 
his current job as Attorney General of 
the United States, he made a solemn 
pledge to keep politics out of the Jus-
tice Department. I, for one, was en-
couraged by his statement, having seen 
the disastrous politicization of the Jus-
tice Department under former Attor-
neys General Eric Holder and Loretta 
Lynch. 
Attorney General Garland said this. 
He said: 
I will never make a decision in the Depart-
ment based on politics or partisanship. 
I took him at his word. I hoped we 
wouldn’t see a return to the days when 
people saw double standards play out 
in the Justice Department based on 
who happened to be in office, who hap-
pened to be investigated. But, clearly, 
under Attorney General Garland’s lead-
ership, the Department of Justice has 
pointed its arrows toward concerned 
parents, for example, who are exer-
cising their First Amendment rights to

September 19, 2022 
speak up about their children’s edu-
cation. Attorney General Garland has 
sued the State of Georgia and the State 
of Texas, for example, claiming that 
ballot integrity measures that are 
within the prerogative of the States to 
pass were somehow suppressing the 
public’s right to vote. 
We are going to start voting in about 
50 days from now. That is the main 
election date. In Texas, we will start 
voting a full 2 weeks before that date, 
where, without any reason whatsoever, 
you can show up and vote in person, 2 
full weeks before the general election. 
Yet Attorney General Garland spins 
the false narrative that somehow the 
State of Texas is suppressing people’s 
right to vote. 
And then Attorney General Garland I 
think shocked everybody by author-
izing an unprecedented search warrant 
on a former President and a current po-
litical rival when less intrusive means 
and methods would have produced the 
same documents that they claimed to 
be after. 
Time and time again, the Depart-
ment of Justice under Merrick Garland 
has taken aggressive actions that are 
viewed by the Biden administration as 
politically advantageous. For every-
body else, though, it is a different 
story, that double standard. When Su-
preme Court Justices are receiving 
death threats, including the interdic-
tion of a deranged man who was out to 
kill Justice Kavanaugh here in the Na-
tion’s Capital, the Attorney General 
did not respond by taking appropriate 
steps to prevent that violence. In fact, 
he fanned the flames. Instead of pro-
tecting the Justices, he chose to criti-
cize 
them 
and 
encouraged 
what 
amounts to irresponsible conduct on 
the part of people on the left. 
And now I am concerned about the 
Department’s double standard in the 
handling of the Hunter Biden inves-
tigation. The public reports are that 
the President’s son has been under in-
vestigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice for the District of Delaware for a 
long time now. There is a lot, of 
course, we don’t know, but reported 
leaks and evidence seem to show that 
Hunter Biden may have committed 
various felonies, including tax fraud, 
money laundering, and foreign lob-
bying violations. Despite the severity 
of these concerns, recent news reports 
have painted an alarming picture of 
the Department of Justice’s handling 
of this investigation: silencing whistle-
blowers, downplaying or discrediting 
inculpatory information, prohibiting 
the Department of Justice and FBI em-
ployees 
from 
communicating 
with 
Members of Congress. This does not 
look, sound, or smell like an impartial 
investigation guided only by the facts 
and the rule of law. 
Just across the street from here sits 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States. On the front of that Court is 
the inscription ‘‘Equal Justice Under 
Law.’’ There is no footnote. There is no 
asterisk. There is no exception for rel-
atives of the President of the United 
States. Every American is entitled to 
fair and equal treatment and equal jus-
tice under the laws. The Attorney Gen-
eral must guarantee that Hunter Biden 
receives the same treatment as any 
other American who is under criminal 
investigation—not better, not worse, 
but the same. 
Today, 32 of my colleagues and I have 
sent a letter to Attorney General Gar-
land urging him to provide special 
counsel authorities and protections to 
U.S. Attorney David Weiss, who is 
leading the investigation into Hunter 
Biden. This is a critical step that the 
Attorney General can and should take 
to restore faith in this investigation 
and avoid even the appearance of im-
propriety. So I hope he will honor our 
request, do what he pledged to do when 
he was confirmed, and keep politics out 
of this investigation and, in the proc-
ess, restore public confidence in our 
Nation’s most revered institutions. 
IMMIGRATION 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, the migration surge at the south-
ern border has been at a crisis level for 
a year and a half now. Coming from a 
border State with 1,200 miles of com-
mon border with Mexico, we have expe-
rienced a disproportionate impact of 
that humanitarian surge, as well as the 
drugs that have found their way into 
the United States as a result. 
This, after all, is part of a business 
model or plan by the cartels, which get 
rich smuggling people and drugs into 
the United States. But just in terms of 
the volume of migrants coming across, 
we have logged more than 150,000 bor-
der crossings every month for each of 
the last 17 consecutive months. That is 
unprecedented and shocking. 
Alarm bells used to sound when ille-
gal border crossings topped 100,000 a 
month, but we haven’t dipped below 
that level since President Biden took 
office. In the last year, Customs and 
Border Protection has logged nearly 2.3 
million—2.3 million—border crossings 
across the southern border. 
Now, these records come with serious 
consequences for everyone involved. 
Our Democratic colleagues and mem-
bers of the news media focus their at-
tention on how this surge impacts the 
migrants themselves, and there is no 
question that migrants endure a brutal 
journey to reach our country. They 
typically pay thousands of dollars to 
travel 
with 
human 
traffickers—or 
coyotes, as they are sometimes called— 
who are known to rape, rob, abuse, and 
abandon for dead their customers. 
Those who survive the perilous jour-
ney to our border still face serious dan-
gers. These are people who come not 
through our legal immigration process 
but who want to jump ahead of the line 
of the people who are waiting, even 
though we naturalize about a million 
people a year in the United States. 
In June of this year, 53 migrants, in-
cluding 3 children, passed away after 
being locked in a tractor-trailer rig on 
a 100-degree day in Texas—a horrible 
way to die. The Washington Post de-
scribed it as the ‘‘deadliest smuggling 
incident of its kind in U.S. history.’’ 
Last month, two children died at-
tempting to cross the Rio Grande and 
drowned in that river attempting to 
make their way into the United States. 
One was a 5-year-old girl from Guate-
mala who was swept from her mother’s 
arms into the river. And just 2 weeks 
ago, Customs and Border Protection 
confirmed that another nine migrants 
had died trying to cross the Rio 
Grande. 
Since last October, more than 750,000 
migrants have died at our border. That 
does not include the ones we have not 
yet discovered but will eventually dis-
cover as a rancher comes across the 
bleached bones of a migrant who has 
been left behind by the heartless 
coyotes. 
Migrants are suffering every day, and 
we can’t lose sight of the humanitarian 
crisis, but the migrants aren’t the only 
victims of the border crisis. They have 
chosen to try to enter the United 
States irregularly, other than through 
legal means, and turn their lives over 
to people who care nothing for them 
but care only about them as a human 
commodity and how much money they 
can make smuggling them into the 
United States. 
But migration surges have a dev-
astating impact on border communities 
like the border communities in my 
State and Arizona, New Mexico, and 
California. Over the last year and a 
half, I have visited our border commu-
nities several times and repeatedly 
have heard of the strain of this crisis. 
Nonprofits that try to assist, in a hu-
manitarian way, the migrants lack the 
space or resources to care for the thou-
sands of people entering our country 
every day. Local businesses try to stay 
afloat amid safety concerns and signifi-
cant financial losses. Morgues have 
reached capacity due to the influx of 
deceased migrants. As we have dis-
cussed during a Judiciary Committee 
hearing last week, local health systems 
and emergency response services are 
stretched to the breaking. 
Last year alone, in a small town 
called Del Rio, TX, 15,000 Haitian mi-
grants showed up under a bridge. Can 
you imagine a town of 35,000 people 
having to deal with trying to address 
the needs and treat these migrants in a 
humane way? Well, during the 2019 
surge, Customs and Border Protection 
reported that it was on track to refer 
more than 31,000 migrants for medical 
treatment, compared with only 12,000 
the previous year. 
Of course, the surge in 2019 pales in 
comparison to what is happening now 
as a result of President Biden’s failed 
border policies. The number of mi-
grants needing medical care today is 
much, much higher. The strain this 
places on local hospitals and public 
health systems not only impacts the 
migrants but also the American citi-
zens who live and work in these border 
communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4815 
September 19, 2022 
We all remember the strain on our 
healthcare systems during the height 
of the pandemic. Hospitals inundated 
with COVID cases made it more dif-
ficult to get care in the event you were 
experiencing some other health emer-
gency. As Brooks County Sheriff Mar-
tinez wrote in his testimony in the 
hearing we had last week, ambulances 
that ordinarily would respond to emer-
gency calls from local citizens are now 
diverted to answer calls in remote 
areas to answer the needs of the mi-
grants who are experiencing a health 
emergency, reducing the medical serv-
ices available for the local residents 
who actually pay the taxes that sup-
port those services. 
The impact of this crisis on border 
communities in Texas is not a consid-
eration for the Biden administration. 
They simply don’t care—or, frankly, 
most of my Democratic colleagues here 
in the Senate. We heard from the chair-
man of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, the senior Senator from Illi-
nois, complaining about the terrible 
state of our broken immigration sys-
tem and what is happening now as mi-
grants are being bused to places all 
across the country, including Chicago. 
But he is the only one who can convene 
a markup of legislation. 
Our Democratic colleagues have a 
Democrat in the White House, a Demo-
cratic Speaker, and a Democratic ma-
jority leader in the U.S. Senate, yet we 
have not seen a single piece of legisla-
tion offered or passed to try to deal 
with the crisis. It is always somebody 
else’s problem or it is just a political 
issue that you flail in the runup to the 
coming election. 
Migrants are arriving in someone 
else’s backyard—what do you care?— 
inundating 
someone 
else’s 
public 
health system along the U.S.-Texas 
border and filling up somebody else’s 
morgue. Apparently, the Biden admin-
istration doesn’t care. 
And I haven’t mentioned the 108,000 
Americans who have died of drug 
overdoses last year alone. Virtually all 
of those drugs, including for the 71,000 
Americans who died from synthetic 
opioid or fentanyl overdoses, come 
from the southern border. 
The precursors come from China. 
They come to Mexico, where the car-
tels get rich shipping their poison into 
the United States. And then it is dis-
tributed by criminal street gangs, like 
the same gangs that are responsible for 
the dozens and dozens of shootings that 
seem to occur in a lot of our major cit-
ies on a weekly basis, including places 
like Chicago. 
These gangs that distribute the drugs 
that kill Americans fight for market 
share. They fight for territory. Yet our 
Senate 
Democratic 
colleagues 
who 
have been in the majority now—who 
control both the Senate, the House, 
and the White House—have not offered 
a single piece of legislation or a single 
response. 
In Texas, because of our proximity to 
the border, we don’t have the luxury of 
ignoring this problem. Our commu-
nities are somehow expected to absorb 
and care for this vast humanitarian 
crisis, even though they don’t have the 
resources to do so, even though it is 
the Federal Government’s responsi-
bility. International borders and immi-
gration enforcement is a Federal re-
sponsibility. Yet the State of Texas 
and taxpayers in the State have spent 
billions of dollars to do the job that the 
Federal Government simply refuses to 
do and even then are overwhelmed. 
It simply is unacceptable for our Sen-
ate colleagues or our Members of the 
House who haven’t lifted a finger to 
deal with these problems to say this 
isn’t our problem because it is not hap-
pening to us. Well, that is why maybe— 
just maybe—the fact that migrants 
who are showing up in Washington, DC, 
in New York, and Chicago seem to be 
getting the attention of others who 
previously have not lifted a finger or 
expressed any concerns whatsoever. 
By the way, the Biden administra-
tion has been shipping and flying mi-
grants into the interior of the United 
States for the last year and a half. I 
mean, you haven’t heard a single peep. 
But when they start showing up in rel-
atively small numbers compared to 
what is coming across the border, the 
Mayor of Washington, DC, declares a 
crisis. She asked for the activation of 
the National Guard. 
Since April, roughly 9,400 migrants 
have arrived in Washington, DC. I men-
tioned 2.3 million have showed up at 
the border. But now, when 9,400 mi-
grants arrive in Washington, DC—a 
self-described 
sanctuary 
city—the 
Mayor cries out for help from the Fed-
eral Government. She declared a public 
health emergency. 
Well, I mentioned the total number, 
but an average of 6,000 migrants cross 
the southern border every day. And yet 
the Mayor of Washington, DC—a self- 
described sanctuary city—is in a panic 
when 9,400 come to her city. 
The Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Val-
ley Sector alone sees almost an aver-
age of almost 1,400 migrants a day. 
Over the last 5 months, DC has ab-
sorbed the same number of migrants 
that the Rio Grande Valley Sector sees 
in a single week, and the city is crying 
out for help. 
The way the Mayor really could help 
is to pick up the phone and call her 
friends in the Biden administration and 
say: We need to do something about 
what is happening at the border. 
That would be a constructive thing 
to do. We are more than happy to work 
with our Democratic colleagues to 
come up with some solutions like the 
Bipartisan Border Solutions Act that I 
introduced last year with a Democrat, 
a 
border 
State 
Senator, 
Senator 
SINEMA; TONY GONZALES, a Republican 
from the 23rd Congressional District; 
and HENRY CUELLAR, a Democrat from 
Laredo, TX. 
We offered this bill as a bipartisan, 
bicameral beginning to come up with a 
solution. Yet we have not heard a sin-
gle peep out of the Biden administra-
tion. You would think with the Presi-
dent’s poll numbers plummeting as a 
result of his failure to deal with this 
border crisis, they would be looking for 
some way out, somewhere to land that 
plane. But they have not reached out 
at all. They have not responded. And 
Democratic leadership in the White 
House, House, and the Senate have 
taken zero action. 
I would just like my Democratic col-
leagues to pause for a moment and 
think about the communities in my 
State that have been operating at cri-
sis levels since President Biden took 
office more than a year and a half ago. 
We are the ones and they are the ones 
picking up the Federal Government’s 
slack and managing a crisis—or trying 
to—that our Democratic colleagues 
refuse to even acknowledge. 
My constituents and border commu-
nities in Texas and beyond are exhaust-
ing resources paid for by their tax dol-
lars to serve their own communities— 
spending them on the Federal Govern-
ment’s responsibility. And it shouldn’t 
be any surprise if they are exhausted; 
they are overwhelmed; and they are 
desperate for the Biden administration 
and the Democratic leadership in the 
House and Senate to do something. 
Maybe, just maybe, now that this cri-
sis has caught the attention of the 
Mayors of Washington, DC, and New 
York, and Chicago—maybe the admin-
istration will pay attention to those 
Mayors when they have ignored this 
problem so far. 
Maybe, just maybe, they will see that 
what is happening along our border 
every day is dangerous, unsustainable, 
and a problem that we need to work on 
together to address.

RESTORING LAW AND ORDER ACT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. As I have talked 
on this floor through the past few 
years, I have talked about visiting each 
of the 95 counties in our great State of 
Tennessee every year. And when I am 
there, I spend much of the time talking 
with local leaders, small business own-
ers, families, citizens who call Ten-
nessee home. And I have seen firsthand 
what the Biden agenda has done to 
them over these past 2 years. 
The 
out-of-control 
spending 
that 
started 
almost 
immediately 
after 
Democrats took power and the infla-
tion it caused has made life too expen-
sive to afford for many individuals. The 
open border policy that did indeed 
start on day 1 of this administration 
overwhelmed Border Patrol and turned 
every Tennessee town, just like towns 
all across this country, into a border 
town. 
The Democrats’ obsession with envi-
ronmental radicalism and the Green 
New Deal destroyed thousands of jobs, 
and as a bonus, this has sent gas and 
energy prices soaring. 
They ignored our broken-down sup-
ply chains, and now economic develop-
ment in rural and depressed areas has 
stalled out. I wish I could chalk all this 
up to gross incompetence, but after 2 
years, I know and Tennesseans know 
there is a lot more to that story. Joe 
Biden and the Democrats know what 
they are doing. They know it is wrong, 
and they are doing it anyway. 
One of the most frightening con-
sequences of Joe Biden’s reckless abuse 
of power is the rise in violent crime. 
The left’s ‘‘defund the police’’ move-
ment gained traction before Biden and 
his Democratic allies took power here 
in Washington, DC, but it was their de-
cision to let it fester and undermine 
local law enforcement. 
Instead of abiding by their duty to 
keep Americans safe, they have made 
heroes out of criminals and turned po-
lice officers into villains. 
The results have been disastrous. 
Compared to mid-2019, America’s larg-
est cities have seen a 50-percent in-
crease in homicides and a 36-percent in-
crease in aggravated assaults. 
Cities that caved to the radical left’s 
demands to gut the police department 
have seen crime rates rise even higher. 
The people of Memphis have had a 
front-row seat to this violence. I would 
implore my colleagues to listen to 
them, rather than to the anti-police ac-
tivists making their phones ring, be-
cause they—they—are the ones who are 
paying the price for this little experi-
ment. 
Ask them how they felt as they 
watched a shooting spree play out live 
on social media. I won’t use the per-
petrator’s name here on the floor of the 
Senate, but he is accused of murdering 
three people, wounding three others, 
and committing not one but two 
carjackings. 
Ask them how they felt when they 
found out what happened to the wife,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

September 19, 2022 
mother, and teacher who never came 
back from her morning run. A monster 
with a long criminal record—again, 
whose name I will not use here—is 
charged with her brutal abduction and 
murder. And then ask them how they 
would feel about living in a world with-
out law enforcement officers. 
There are thousands of examples, un-
fortunately, that I could list, but the 
point is that the Democrats and their 
reckless anti-cop, anti-law enforce-
ment agenda destroyed the concept of 
law and order in this country to service 
a narrative about how evil America is, 
but in the end, all they did was to em-
power the real evildoers. 
Joe Biden and the Democrats have 
squandered their time in power, wast-
ing our money and throwing cops under 
the bus, and now, just as they have 
with every other disastrous choice they 
have made, they are determined to, un-
fortunately, ignore the consequences. 
The Democrats did not take power 
with a mandate to defund the police, 
but if they listened to the American 
people, they would have known we do 
have a mandate to undo the damage 
that caused and support ‘‘Back the 
Blue’’ and make our communities safe 
again. 
Last week, Senator HAGERTY and I 
introduced the Restoring Law and 
Order Act, and I am hopeful that my 
Democratic colleagues will see reason 
and help us move this through Con-
gress and to the President’s desk as 
soon as possible. 
The bill addresses two key priorities 
we should all share: One, hiring more 
police officers with experience han-
dling violent crime and, two, cutting 
down the processing time that it is 
taking for processing rape kits. 
Sheriffs in Tennessee have confirmed 
for me, time and again, that manpower 
is, indeed, a problem. They don’t have 
enough people to keep up with the 
crimewave that we are seeing. We need 
to change that. 
We are also going to give them the 
resources they need to target drug 
crime, clean all that cartel fentanyl off 
the streets, and keep criminals locked 
up behind bars. 
I want to devote the time I have left 
to the issue of the rape kit backlog be-
cause this is something that we have 
talked about for years but haven’t been 
able to get to the bottom of, even with 
the help of hundreds of millions of dol-
lars. 
Simply throwing money at the prob-
lem is no longer enough. I want to use 
one program as an example of why we 
know this is the case. Between 2015 and 
2021, $266 million in grants has flowed 
out the door to 40 States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia as part of the Sexual 
Assault Kit Initiative. 
These jurisdictions have identified 
about 136,000 unsubmitted kits and 
tested more than 81,000 of them. Let 
that number sink in. As I said, they 
have identified 136,000 kits. They have 
tested more than 81,000 of them. 
This has led to 13,000 CODIS hits, 189 
convictions, and 795 guilty pleas. Good 
results but not good enough. Those 
grantees still have 50,000 kits gathering 
dust on the shelves of their evidence 
lockers—50,000—50,000 kits, aggravated 
assaults, rapes, incidences reported, 
but they have not been processed even 
yet. 
So what is going on here? That is a 
question that is truly in need of an an-
swer, and this administration, the 
Democrats, all of us in this Chamber, 
owe it to the women in this country to 
help local law enforcement officers get 
an answer. 
Why are these kits not being proc-
essed in a timely manner? As I said, we 
have put hundreds of millions of dol-
lars into this. We have made certain 
kits are there. We have money that has 
been put forward to push these through 
the system, but they are languishing. 
We are not getting those results in a 
timely manner in order to lock up vio-
lent criminals. 
The Restoring Law and Order Act 
will direct some funds to State and 
local agencies to specifically address 
the backlog. It also will require the 
GAO to study the availability of and 
deficiencies in processing rape kits. 
Congress has let this go on long 
enough. When I speak to women at 
home in Tennessee, they are terrified 
about how far this has been willing to 
let go. This President’s anti-justice 
agenda has destroyed trust in our sys-
tem. 
It is astonishing to me that in 2022, 
we are still having to debate the mer-
its—the merits—of maintaining law 
and order, especially considering we 
can see the consequences of under-
mining it live and on camera every sin-
gle night. 
Turn on the local news here in DC, 
you will get a taste of what it looks 
like when local leadership turns their 
backs on victims and empowers crimi-
nals. 
The Restoring Law and Order Act is 
an important bill that the Senate 
should pass as soon as possible, but 
that is just one step. If you listen to 
the outcry from Memphis or L.A. or 
New York and other cities around the 
country and especially on the border, it 
is so clear this President and the 
Democrats have a mandate from the 
American people to fight crime, to em-
power law enforcement, and to seek 
justice for victims of violence. 
This 
means 
embracing 
a 
simple 
mantra: If you do the crime, you have 
to pay the time. It also means hiring 
and electing tough prosecutors and dis-
trict attorneys and eliminating soft- 
on-crime policies that allow violent of-
fenders to roam free. 
If the powers that be had been a little 
tougher on the violent criminal who 
live-streamed his shooting spree, the 
streets of Memphis would have been a 
little bit safer. He only served 11 
months of a previous 3-year sentence 
for aggravated assault. But they let 
him out early, and now three individ-
uals have lost their lives. If they had 
really taken their time with the other 
criminal I mentioned just a few mo-
ments ago, who had a past record of 
rape and aggravated assault, they may 
not have let him out of prison before 
his 24-year sentence was up. If the 
crime lab had secured the resources to 
clear their rape kit backlog, they may 
have discovered the year-old kit con-
taining his DNA and stopped his re-
lease. The monster would still be in 
jail; a wife and mother would still be 
alive; and one less family would be in 
mourning. 
The time for politicizing this has 
come to an end. Tennesseans aren’t 
worried about the midterms. They are 
not 
worried 
about 
a 
legislative 
timeline. What matters to them is re-
storing law and order. 
I would venture to guess that this 
President’s 
administration 
and 
my 
Democratic colleagues probably know 
this, and if they block this bill, if they 
stand between victims of violent crime 
and the justice they deserve, they do so 
with the knowledge that more people 
will die; more violent offenders will 
walk free; and more families will suf-
fer. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

FORMED SERVICES UNIVERSITY 
OF THE HEALTH SCIENCES 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
throughout the past five decades, the 
Senate has recognized the important 
role of the Uniformed Services Univer-
sity of the Health Sciences—USUHS— 
in maintaining the health and readi-
ness of our Nation’s uniformed serv-
ices. Today, I am proud to congratulate 
this fine institution, located in Be-
thesda, in my State of Maryland, on its 
50th anniversary. 
Public Law 92–426 established USUHS 
in 1972 to ensure continuity and leader-
ship for uniformed medicine. USUHS is 
our country’s only Federal graduate 
and 
undergraduate 
degree-granting 
health sciences university in support of 
the Department of Defense—DOD—and 
the Nation. Since its founding, USUHS 
has graduated more than 11,000 mili-
tary health professionals. 
USUHS has met every goal and mis-
sion envisioned by the founders of this 
remarkable institution. It is the only 
institute of higher learning to provide 
a unique military curriculum that edu-
cates and trains leaders in healthcare 
relevant 
to 
the 
military 
mission. 
USUHS provides its students a rigorous 
healthcare education combined with 
equally demanding training in leader-
ship, military medicine, and public 
health. Students learn in a variety of 
settings, including modern classrooms 
and laboratories, a renowned simula-
tion center, major military hospitals 
and clinics, summer operational expe-
riences with military units, and pro-
gressively challenging field exercises. 
Students leave USUHS prepared to 
care in any setting, from a modern ter-
tiary care hospital or primary care 
clinic, to the sickbay of a warship, the 
cargo bay of a critical care air trans-
port flight, an operating room in a 
combat support hospital, or a treat-
ment tent in a refugee camp. 
The USUHS Hebert School of Medi-
cine, compared with any other U.S. 
medical school, contributes the highest 
number of physician accessions to the 
military services. USUHS alumni com-
prise 25 percent of the Military Health 
System 
physician 
force. 
An 
inde-
pendent analysis of USUHS conducted 
by the Institute for Defense Analysis 
found that, on a value basis that fac-
tors in retention, USUHS may offer the 
highest return on physician education 
and training investments. They con-
cluded that USUHS graduates deployed 
more than 250 percent longer than 
other accession sources—an average of 
731 days compared to 266—have higher 
proportions of officers in the mid- and 
senior-rank levels compared to other 
accession sources, have higher rep-
resentation in special operation units 
compared to other accession sources, 
and attain a higher percentage of spe-
cialty board certification compared to 
other accession sources. The school’s 
graduate education programs in bio-
medical sciences, public health, clin-
ical 
psychology, 
health 
professions 
education, and health policy have 
granted more than 1,000 graduate de-
grees. Many of these alumni are now 
serving as key leaders in the Federal 
Government, academia, research foun-
dations and laboratories, and in public 
health. Throughout the COVID–19 pan-
demic, USUHS School of Medicine 
alumni 
supported 
under-resourced 
communities, as well as national and 
global preparedness and response ef-
forts, and were involved in evaluating 
new COVID–19 test methods, including 
those that received emergency use au-
thorization 
approvals. 
The 
USUHS 
Daniel K. Inouye Graduate School of 
Nursing educates advanced practice 
nurses for the Federal Nursing Chiefs 
to provide the Nation with the highest 
quality graduate nurse clinicians, sci-
entists, scholars, and leaders dedicated 
to Federal service, health readiness, 
and global engagement. Its nurse anes-
thesia program is consistently ranked 
among the top four in the country by 
U.S. News & World Report’s Best Grad-
uate School rankings, which also ranks 
the school’s doctor of nursing practice 
degree program in the top 13 percent in 
the country. The USUHS Graduate 
School of Nursing has received mul-
tiple national recognitions and was ac-
knowledged by the National League for 
nursing twice, as a Center of Excel-
lence for enhanced student learning 
and faculty development. The USUHS 
postgraduate dental college’s 19 post-
graduate dental specialties and 26 post-
graduate year-1 programs ensure that 
military dentists attain advanced skill 
sets beyond those acquired upon grad-
uation from dental school. These ad-
vanced dental skills are essential to 
meeting the needs of warfighters be-
fore, during, and after military oper-
ations. The university’s college of al-
lied health sciences awards under-
graduate college credit and degrees to 
enlisted 
medical 
professionals 
and 
trainees and has graduated more than 
3,500 students from its 23 programs 
since its inception. 
Over the past five decades, USUHS 
has played a critical role in national 
defense, in times of war and peace. 
USUHS graduates continue to be inte-
gral to combat deployments, humani-
tarian missions, disaster response, and 
public health crisis response through-
out the world. USUHS provides its ex-
pertise to DOD and the Nation in glob-
al health, TBI, PTSD, disaster medi-
cine, neuroscience, and human per-
formance. During the recent wars in 
Iraq and Afghanistan, the Military 
Health System achieved the highest 
rate of survival from battlefield injury 
in the history of the world. USUHS 
graduates and faculty have not only 
made important contributions to clin-
ical practice in combat environments 
around the world, but to medical 
science and research, benefiting both 
the military and the public at large. 
The value of the university’s science 
is increasingly recognized by the Na-
tional Institutes of Health—NIH—and 
other funders; USUHS is ranked 80 of

900 U.S. institutions of higher learning, 
putting it in the top 10th percentile in 
total research and development ex-
penditures by the National Science 
Foundation. USUHS researchers gen-
erate 
high-impact 
military-relevant 
discoveries and products to protect the 
health of our forces and assure the na-
tional health security of the United 
States. Since its founding, USUHS has 
filed more than 2,273 patents for re-
search discoveries and technology in-
ventions. Its faculty have been the re-
cipient of eight consecutive Federal 
Laboratory 
Consortium 
Technology 
Transfer Awards for their ground- 
breaking work. 
USUHS’s centers focus on advancing 
research, education, and public health. 
Its National Center for Disaster Medi-
cine and Public Health has been at the 
forefront of the national Stop the 
Bleed and First Aid for Severe Trauma 
campaigns to encourage bystanders 
and high school students. USUHS was 
designated as the Nation’s first Na-
tional Stop the Bleed Campus in 2019. 
The USUHS Center for Biotechnology— 
4DBio3—uses 3D printers to produce 
military-relevant medical products in 
extreme austere environments for the 
benefit of our warfighters. It has also 
developed technology to generate red 
blood cells which would allow for whole 
blood transfusion and could become the 
answer to blood shortages on the bat-
tlefield, other remote locations, and in 
hospitals. The Surgical Critical Care 
Initiative at USUHS created an appli-
cation to accurately predict whether a 
patient, who has just been admitted to 
the emergency room, would need a 
massive blood transfusion. USUHS re-
searchers and trauma surgeons have 
also led the development of knowledge, 
skills, and abilities metrics that are 
being used to inform changes to pa-
tient workflow, increasing surgical 
workloads, and, ultimately, enhancing 
readiness within the Military Health 
System. These KSA metrics have prov-
en vital to measuring military sur-
geons’ individual clinical skills readi-
ness, while also providing data to lead-
ership, increasing clinical readiness- 
generating workload within the MHS. 
USUHS has long met and exceeded 
the original intent of its founders to 
educate a career cadre of physicians to 
support our Nation’s military. Over the 
past 50 years, USUHS has contributed 
immeasurably to the health and future 
of our Nation, through its stellar edu-
cation and training programs, its inno-
vative research, and its development of 
the next generation of military med-
ical leaders and scientists. I am de-
lighted to recognize and congratulate 
the remarkable students, faculty, and 
staff of USUHS for their outstanding 
work and commitment to serving our 
country, and my best wishes for a 
happy golden anniversary to our Na-
tion’s Uniformed Services University of 
the Health Sciences. 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN BERG 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, today, 
I rise to honor the enduring legacy of 
an outstanding Utahn. As the autumn 
sun sunk below the mountains sur-
rounding Southern Utah University’s 
sprawling athletic fields, the men’s 
teams had finished their practice for 
the day. Only under the night sky 
could one group of young, ambitious, 
and dedicated women finally take to 
the empty field, dressed in worn, plain 
PE uniforms with hand-stitched num-
bers. In the collegiate sporting era of 
the 1970s, these female athletes had no 
access to new equipment or team budg-
ets, let alone scholarships or institu-
tional support. But they did have a 
leader. Kathryn Berg, of Heber City, 
UT, proudly led this group of woman 
athletes as their coach, mentor, friend, 
and lifelong advocate for gender equal-
ity across all sports at the university 
and the State of Utah. Today, a return 
visit to SUU must rekindle mixed emo-
tions for Kathryn, both for the enor-
mous strides made for gender equality 
by virtue for her accomplishments as 
its associate athletic director and the 
work still required in pursuit of that 
goal. The field bears her name. 
Despite her decorated career, meas-
ured in both awards and the boundless 
admiration of others, Kathryn Berg 
would be embarrassed to have the spot-
light shone on her life and achieve-
ments. That is because she spent her 
over 33-year career elevating others 
into such a position. The athletes, fam-
ilies, and individuals who know Kath-
ryn describe her as a humble servant to 
others, who worked overtime to pro-
vide opportunities for girls and women 
to participate in sports. To accomplish 
this, she educated herself in sports she 
knew little about by becoming an ex-
pert in the rules and regulations of 
each sport, took classes, and earned 
certifications at her own expense. She 
even became a certified gymnastics 
judge so she could be a better gym-
nastics coach. This enabled her ath-
letes to reach their peak athletic and 
academic performances. An athlete 
herself, Kathryn played basketball and 
tennis at Wasatch High School before 
earning a B.A. and M.A. from Brigham 
Young University, followed by a doc-
torate from the University of Utah. 
She taught and coached at Richfield 
High School, Lincoln Junior High, and 
Orem Junior High, respectively, before 
arriving for a new challenge at South-
ern Utah University. 
At SUU, she served as administrator 
for all women’s sports, including soft-
ball, basketball, gymnastics, track and 
field, volleyball, cheerleading, and syn-
chronized swimming. In Cedar City, she 
continued to face down the perennial 
obstacles halting progress for female 
athletic programs. With no available 
budget, Kathryn and her athletes had 
to fundraise for their right to take to 
the fields and courts. Kathryn stitched 
together 
uniforms, 
spent 
her 
own 
money, and drove the team bus herself. 
With few female coaching mentors 
around, she instead learned as she went 
despite hearing ‘‘no’’ to most every re-
quest. As a direct result of her relent-
less advocacy for gender equality in 
collegiate athletics, countless student- 
athletes had a chance to compete, to 
succeed, and to dream. 
A giver, a selfless servant, and al-
ways present for her friends and fam-
ily. These attributes accurately de-
scribe who Kathryn is as a person and 
what she means to those who love her, 
reinforced by abundant examples of hu-
mility over the decades. One such ex-
ample transcends careers or athletics 
and speaks to the true nature of 
Kathryn’s heart. In 2001, she retired 
from her successful administrative ca-
reer in order to care for her younger 
sister, Charlotte, who suffered from 
cerebral palsy. She needed full-time 
care after their parents died, and Kath-
ryn made sure that she was able to live 
life to the fullest until her passing in 
2014. 
Kathryn Berg is a founding pioneer of 
gender equality in collegiate athletics 
in Utah. Her indelible legacy includes 
helping oversee SUU’s ascension into 
NCAA Division I, helping establish the 
Utah Summer Games, and leading the 
creation of the Thunderbirds’ enduring 
women’s intercollegiate athletic pro-
gram. She is aptly recognized in sev-
eral athletic halls of fame and received 
an honorary doctorate degree from 
SUU. Kathryn is still active in the 
community, especially as the chair of 
the Daughters of Utah Pioneer Mu-
seum. She provides a scholarship to a 
senior at Wasatch High School each 
year and is the No. 1 fan of her family’s 
extracurricular events. 
Thank you, Kathryn, for your life-
time of achievement and inspiration 
for student-athletes everywhere. Your 
unwavering work will continue to ben-
efit untold generations of female ath-
letes and their families.∑

TER-
RORISM—PM 38 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to per-
sons who commit, threaten to commit, 
or support terrorism declared in Execu-
tive Order 13224 of September 23, 2001, 
as amended, is to continue in effect be-
yond September 23, 2022. 
The crisis constituted by the grave 
acts of terrorism and threats of ter-
rorism committed by foreign terror-
ists, including the terrorist attacks on 
September 11, 2001, in New York and 
Pennsylvania and against the Pen-
tagon, and the continuing and imme-
diate threat of further attacks on 
United States nationals or the United 
States that led to the declaration of a 
national emergency on September 23, 
2001, has not been resolved. This crisis 
continues to pose an unusual and ex-
traordinary threat to the national se-
curity, foreign policy, and economy of 
the United States. Therefore, I have de-
termined that it is necessary to con-
tinue the national emergency declared 
in Executive Order 13224, as amended, 
with respect to persons who commit, 
threaten to commit, or support ter-
rorism.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA: 
S. 4879. A bill to amend the Federal 
Credit Union Act to permit credit 
unions to serve certain underserved 
areas, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Expanding 
Financial Access for Underserved Com-
munities 
Act, 
which 
I 
introduced 
today. 
Over the past decade, affordable 
banking services have become more 
difficult for many Americans to access 
due to the closure of physical bank 
branches. Addressing banking deserts 
is an important element to promoting 
equity across our entire economy. 
I believe that credit unions can play 
a significant role in improving access 
to affordable banking services in un-
derserved communities throughout our 
Nation. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this legislation to allow all federally 
chartered credit unions to expand their 
field of membership to underserved 
areas. The bill would exempt business 
loans made to borrowers located in un-
derserved areas from the credit union 
member business lending cap. 
I am proud to join Chairwoman MAX-
INE WATERS in this effort. I hope my 
colleagues will join me in support of 
this bill to promote economic oppor-
tunity in low-income communities and 
communities of color. 
By Ms. HIRONO: 
S. 4883. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of the Interior to partner and 
collaborate with the Secretary of Agri-
culture and the State of Hawaii to ad-
dress Rapid Ohia Death, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce a bill, the Contin-
ued Rapid Ohia Death Response Act of 
2022. This bill requires the Secretary of 
the Interior to continue partnering and 
collaborating with the Secretary of Ag-
riculture and the State of Hawaii to 
address Rapid Ohia Death, ROD. ROD 
is a fungus, Ceratocystis, that was first 
found in Hawaii in 2014 and has since 
killed over a million native Ohia trees. 
Since then, the U.S. Department of Ag-
riculture’s 
Forest 
Service 
has 
partnered with the State of Hawaii and 
the U.S. Department of the Interior in 
efforts to detect and respond to the 
spread of ROD. Sustained efforts, such 
as those supported by this bill, are nec-
essary to protect Ohia trees, which 
comprise 80 percent of Hawaii’s native 
forests. 
Over the past 8 years, ROD has been 
detected on Hawaii Island, Kauai, 
Maui, and Oahu. Efforts are currently 
underway to educate the public to re-
duce the spread, research transmission 
vectors of ROD such as humans, bee-
tles, ungulates, and weather events, 
and test ROD resistant varieties of 
Ohia. This bill directs the Secretary of 
the Interior, acting through the U.S. 
Geological Survey, to continue pro-
viding resources for the purposes of re-
searching 
ROD 
vectors 
and 
trans-
mission. It also requires the Secretary 
of the Interior, acting through the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, to work with 
the State of Hawaii and other local 
stakeholders on ungulate management 
in control areas on Federal, State, and 
private land. Finally, the bill requires 
the Secretary of Agriculture, acting 
through the Chief of the U.S. Forest 
Service, to continue providing re-
sources to prevent the spread of ROD 
and restore the native forests in Ha-
waii and to also continue to provide fi-
nancial and staff resources to the Insti-
tute of Pacific Islands Forestry, IPIF, 
located in Hilo, to continue research on 
ROD. 
The bill authorizes $5 million in ap-
propriations for each fiscal year from 
2023 through 2033 for both the Secre-
taries of Agriculture and Interior to 
carry out these actions, which are nec-
essary to protect and restore Hawaii’s 
most abundant native tree—Ohia—for 
future generations. 
By Ms. HIRONO: 
S. 4884. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of the Interior, in coordination 
with the Secretary of Agriculture, to 
establish a joint natural infrastructure 
science program, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce a bill, the Natural 
Infrastructure Act of 2022. This bill re-

seek to further research on the use of 
natural solutions to address evolving 
infrastructure needs across the coun-
try. The bill also requires the Sec-
retary of the Interior to assess the 
costs and effectiveness of select nat-
ural infrastructure projects on an an-
nual basis. 
The bill defines natural infrastruc-
ture as constructed landscape features 
and systems that employ nature-based 
solutions that promote, use, restore, or 
emulate natural ecological processes. 
These features, when compared to grey 
infrastructure 
solutions, 
are 
often 
more cost-effective, increase commu-
nity resilience to climate change im-
pacts, and attract community support. 
The American Society of Civil Engi-
neers estimates that our country’s 
need for infrastructure repairs through 
2025 totals over $4 trillion. In order to 
meet our country’s short- and long- 
term infrastructure needs, research is 
needed to inform the decisions being 
made by the people charged with ad-
dressing these infrastructure needs— 
civil engineers, local governments, de-
velopers, and the construction indus-
try. The Joint Natural Infrastructure 
Science Program established by this 
bill directs USGS and FS to work with 
colleges and universities to advance 
ongoing 
natural 
infrastructure 
re-
search efforts to inform future infra-
structure projects. The bill also estab-
lishes a stakeholder advisory group to 
inform the Secretary of the Interior on 
appropriate research topics to be as-
sessed by the Joint Natural Infrastruc-
ture Science Program. 
The bill authorizes $4 million in ap-
propriations for each fiscal year from 
2023 through 2033 for both the Secre-
taries of Agriculture and Interior to 
implement the Joint Natural Infra-
structure Program. Additionally, the 
bill requires the Secretary of the Inte-
rior to publish an annual report on no 
fewer than 30 natural infrastructure 
projects across the country to assess 
the cost 
and 
effectiveness of the 
projects 
as 
well 
as 
provide 
rec-
ommendations on ways to improve fu-
ture natural infrastructure projects in 
terms of construction, costs, and effec-
tiveness. The selected projects should 
be diverse in terms of both geographic 
location as well as project type. These 
reports, coupled with the research gen-
erated by the Joint Natural Infrastruc-
ture Science Program, will help inform 
future infrastructure projects as we 
seek out cost-effective solutions all 
across the country that maximize 
human and environmental benefits in 
the face of evolving challenges, includ-
ing the increasing impacts of climate 
change.

A 
STILLBIRTH, 
AND

OTHER FAMILIES FROM EXPERI-
ENCING THE SAME TRAGEDY 
Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. 
GRASSLEY, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. WYDEN, 
Mr. KING, and Mr. PETERS) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 771 
Whereas, 23,000 pregnancies in the United 
States end in stillbirth each year, and the 
COVID–19 pandemic has exacerbated the cri-
sis; 
Whereas racial disparities persist in birth 
outcomes, with Black, Hispanic, and Indige-
nous families at the greatest risk of losing a 
baby to stillbirth; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, the annual 
number of stillbirths far exceeds the number 
of deaths among children under 15 years of 
age due to sudden infant death syndrome, 
car accidents, drowning, guns, fire, poison, 
and flu combined; 
Whereas, in the last 2 decades, the still-
birth rate in the United States declined by a 
negligible 0.4 percent, and in a report pub-
lished by the World Health Organization 
comparing progress in improving stillbirth 
rates, the United States ranked 183 out of 195 
countries; 
Whereas stillbirths are devastating and 
have a profound and lifelong impact on the 
families who endure them; 
Whereas stillbirth is linked to an increased 
risk of maternal mortality; 
Whereas, with increased awareness and 
better data collection, the United States will 
be able to better understand why stillbirths 
in the United States are happening at an 
alarming rate and identify what can be done 
to combat this crisis; 
Whereas proven stillbirth prevention ef-
forts have the power to save a minimum of 
7,500 babies every year from preventable 
stillbirth in the United States, and innova-
tions in stillbirth prevention could save 
thousands of additional families in the 
United States from the heartache of losing a 
baby each year; 
Whereas recognizing ‘‘National Stillbirth 
Prevention Day’’ is an opportunity to in-
crease awareness, support evidence-based 
prevention efforts, promote research, en-
courage improved data collection and great-
er understanding, and provide community to 
those who have experienced stillbirth; and 
Whereas ‘‘National Stillbirth Prevention 
Day’’ calls on the President and all other 
Federal officials to use their authorities to 
reduce stillbirths in the United States by at 
least 33 percent and ensure every expectant 
family is educated on how to reduce the risk 
of losing a baby to stillbirth: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘Na-
tional Stillbirth Prevention Day’’; 
(2) understands the importance of advanc-
ing evidence-based prevention efforts; and 
(3) requests that the President issue a 
proclamation calling upon the people of the 
United States to observe National Stillbirth 
Prevention Day with appropriate awareness 
programs and activities.

SERIOUSNESS 
OF 
MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY AND EX-

SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF SEPTEMBER 15, 
2022, 
AS 
‘‘INTERNATIONAL 
MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY AWARE-
NESS DAY’’ 
Mr. KAINE (for himself, Ms. LUMMIS, 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR, and Ms. SMITH) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 772 
Whereas myotonic dystrophy is a rare, 
multi-systemic, inherited disease that af-
fects approximately 1 in 2,100 individuals and 
more than 150,000 individuals in the United 
States; 
Whereas 1 in 8,000 individuals are living 
with myotonic dystrophy globally, yet thou-
sands of individuals do not know they have 
the disease and are in need of care; 
Whereas myotonic dystrophy is the most 
common form of adult-onset muscular dys-
trophy, and the symptoms of the disease be-
come more severe with each generation; 
Whereas the disease is caused by a muta-
tion 
in 
the 
DMPK 
gene, 
resulting 
in 
myotonic dystrophy type 1, or the CNBP 
gene, resulting in myotonic dystrophy type 
2; 
Whereas those mutations prevent those 
genes from functioning properly, impacting 
multiple body systems; 
Whereas those mutations are autosomal 
dominant mutations, in which one copy of 
the altered gene is sufficient to cause the 
disorder, and affected individuals have a 50 
percent chance of passing on the mutated 
gene to their children; 
Whereas, through this inherited genetic 
anomaly, individuals with myotonic dys-
trophy experience varied and complex symp-
toms, ranging from skeletal muscle prob-
lems, early cataracts, and excessive daytime 
sleepiness to heart, breathing, digestive, hor-
monal, speech, swallowing, diabetic, im-
mune, vision, and cognitive difficulties; 
Whereas myotonic dystrophy is a highly 
variable and complicated disorder, and the 
younger an individual is when symptoms 
first appear, the more severe symptoms are 
likely to be; 
Whereas misdiagnoses have persisted for 
decades, and delays in diagnosing myotonic 
dystrophy are common; 
Whereas there are currently no treatments 
approved by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion for myotonic dystrophy; 
Whereas the Myotonic Dystrophy Founda-
tion was founded in 2007 with a mission to 
enhance the quality of life of individuals liv-
ing with myotonic dystrophy and accelerate 
research focused on finding treatments and a 
cure; 
Whereas, in 2014, Congress enacted the 
Paul D. Wellstone Muscular Dystrophy Com-
munity Assistance, Research and Education 
Amendments of 2014 (Public Law 113–166; 128 
Stat. 1879), which advanced muscular dys-
trophy research and public health surveil-
lance activities, including for myotonic dys-
trophy;

cially disabling impact of myotonic dys-

myotonic dystrophy, the Social Security Ad-
ministration added congenital myotonic dys-
trophy to the Compassionate Allowance Pro-
gram, which allows individuals to quickly 
qualify for disability benefits, including 
health insurance coverage; 
Whereas, in 2018, Congress added myotonic 
dystrophy to the list of eligible conditions 
for research funding under the Peer Re-
viewed Medical Research Program of the De-
partment of Defense, which resulted in more 
than $6,000,000 in new research awards; and 
Whereas a more robust scientific invest-
ment in myotonic dystrophy research will 
improve health outcomes, reduce disability, 
and increase life expectancy for individuals 
living with myotonic dystrophy, and holds 
great promise for helping individuals with 
similar genetic diseases: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses support for the designation of 
September 
15, 
2022, 
as 
‘‘International 
Myotonic Dystrophy Awareness Day’’; 
(2) recognizes the seriousness of myotonic 
dystrophy; and 
(3) supports the goals and ideals of Inter-
national Myotonic Dystrophy Awareness 
Day, which include— 
(A) committing to promoting and advanc-
ing the health, well-being, and inherent dig-
nity of all children and adults with myotonic 
dystrophy; 
(B) supporting the advancement of sci-
entific and medical myotonic dystrophy re-
search; 
(C) fostering biopharmaceutical innovation 
that will lead to Food and Drug Administra-
tion-approved treatments and eventually a 
cure for myotonic dystrophy; 
(D) advancing programs and policies that 
assist individuals living with myotonic dys-
trophy and the caregivers of such individ-
uals; and 
(E) encouraging awareness and education 
of myotonic dystrophy for patients, care-
givers, clinicians, and researchers.

democracy is not passed down through the 
gene pool. It must be taught and learned 
anew by each generation of citizens.’’;

rifice and to the willingness, if necessary, to 
die in its defense.’’; 
Whereas President Ronald Reagan said, 
‘‘Democracy is worth dying for, because it’s 
the most deeply honorable form of govern-
ment ever devised by man.’’; 
Whereas Congressman John R. Lewis said,

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
FOUNDING 
OF 
JERICHO 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to extend my warmest 
congratulations to The Bureau for Exceptional 
Children and Adults (JERICHO) on celebrating 
their 50th anniversary. This milestone achieve-
ment deserves the highest praise for the hard 
work and dedication of the organization’s 
board, staff, and everyone who has contrib-
uted to JERICHO’s success. 
Founded in the late 1960s by Father Robert 
F. Wagner and Sr. Joan Magnani, JERICHO 
was created to address the need for religious 
education classes and services for people with 
special needs in western Massachusetts. 
Through their work, they have brought new 
awareness and previously unavailable support 
to those families and individuals who are often 
ignored. 
For 50 years, JERICHO has striven to fulfill 
its mission of bringing dignity, respect, and 
wholeness into the lives of people with disabil-
ities and their families. In that time, thousands 
of families have benefitted from the programs, 
support, and the many other services provided 
by JERICHO throughout the western Massa-
chusetts community. The past few years, in 
particular, have highlighted the need for the 
support and connection gained through organi-
zations such as JERICHO. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to congratu-
late JERICHO again on celebrating their 50th 
anniversary and thank them for continuing to 
provide the means to meet life’s spiritual, 
moral, and social challenges. JERICHO is a 
cherished member of Massachusetts’ First 
District, and I wish them many more years of 
success and prosperity.

CELEBRATING DR. WARREN H. 
STEWART, SR. 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Dr. Warren H. Stewart, 
Sr. on 45 years of preaching at the First Insti-
tutional Baptist Church of Phoenix, Arizona. 
Dr. Stewart’s leadership, faith, and advocacy 
have inspired generations of Arizonans, and I 
want to express my gratitude for his service to 
our community. 
Dr. Stewart is the Senior Pastor at First In-
stitutional, where he has served since 1977. 
Since moving to Phoenix, Dr. Stewart has tire-
lessly worked to help Arizona’s most vulner-
able populations and fought to bring justice to 
all in the state. He was instrumental in the 
passage of the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday 
in Arizona and founded FIBCO Family Serv-
ices, Inc. in 1986. Through the values of serv-
ice, respect, integrity, empowerment, and di-
versity and inclusion, FIBCO Family Services 
works to, ‘‘provide people with knowledge, 
skills and support to transform and empower 
their lives.’’ The services they provide include 
food and clothing distribution, affordable hous-
ing, immigrant and refugee support, and 
health care. 
Throughout his distinguished career, Dr. 
Stewart has had numerous academic achieve-
ments, won awards and accolades, and pub-
lished several books. He has served as a bea-
con of hope and integrity. I’d like to again con-
gratulate Dr. Stewart on 45 years of preaching 
at First Institutional and thank him for over 
four decades of service and leadership to the 
Phoenix community.

RECOGNIZING PRIVATE FIRST 
CLASS (PFC) EDMUND F. LEWIS 
HON. W. GREGORY STEUBE 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. STEUBE. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to recognize Private First Class (PFC) 
Edmund F. Lewis, of Port Charlotte, Florida. 
On October 1, 2022, PFC Lewis will be award-
ed the Legion d’honneur, France’s highest 
honor for acts of valor and integrity. PFC 
Lewis was drafted into service in 1943 and de-
ployed to France in January of 1945 with the 
65th Infantry Division. During his time in com-
bat, PFC Lewis helped reestablish freedom for 
France from its hostile occupation by Nazi 
Germany. As an Infantryman, he found himself 
fighting on the front lines, advancing from 
town to town to free the occupied territory. 
Often under the presence of heavy enemy re-
sistance, PFC Lewis and the allied forces 
pushed their way west into Germany and be-
yond, with the goal of bringing an end to the 
war. After months of fighting, PFC Lewis and 
his brothers in arms were able to secure the 
surrender of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945. 
Following the surrender, PFC Lewis aided in 
the liberation of one of the most infamous 
Concentration Camps, Mauthausen, and freed 
thousands of prisoners who were held captive 
there. I thank PFC Lewis for his years of dedi-
cated service to our Nation and congratulate 
him on receiving the Legion d’honneur. 
RECOGNIZING MR. CRAIG 
PEDERSEN 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the incredible career of Mr. 
Craig Pedersen and to congratulate him on his 
retirement. 
Mr. Pedersen has spent most of his life in 
Kings County. Born in Reno, Nevada, his fam-
ily moved to Lemoore in 1962 to return to their 
family farm. While he didn’t know it at the 
time, this would begin a lifelong career in the 
agricultural industry for Mr. Pedersen. After 
graduating from Hanford High School, Mr. Pe-
dersen began working full time with the family 
farm in 1982 and would eventually become 
business partners with his father, Robert. To-
gether, they formed Pedersen Farms in 1987. 
After many years of learning the agriculture 
business on his family farm, Mr. Pedersen 
began to take on leadership positions in the 
local agricultural community. He has served as 
the Chairman of the California Cotton Growers 
Association, the California Wheat Commission, 
and the Kings County Farm Bureau. In 1992, 
Mr. Pedersen accepted a multi-year fellowship 
with the California Agriculture Leadership Pro-
gram, which allowed him to travel across 
North and South America to obtain an even 
better understanding of the agriculture indus-
try. Following his fellowship, former California 
Governor Pete Wilson appointed Mr. Pedersen 
to serve a four-year term on the Central Valley 
Regional Water Quality Control Board. In 
2015, Mr. Pedersen was elected to the Kings 
County Board of Supervisors, where he has 
continued his lifelong commitment to the Cen-
tral Valley agricultural community. 
Mr. Pedersen has been an essential part of 
the Central Valley community for over thirty 
years. His work has been widely recognized 
throughout Kings County, where he has re-
ceived both the California Agriculture Leader-
ship Profile in Leadership Award in 2000 and 
the Kings County Agriculturalist of the Year 
award in 2002. I cannot think of a man more 
deserving of these recognitions than Mr. Pe-
dersen, who has dedicated his entire adult life 
to supporting agriculture in the Central Valley. 
I ask all my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring the lifelong work and achievements of 
Mr. Craig Pedersen and congratulate him on a 
well-deserved retirement.

RECOGNIZING RON HALBER 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to observe the remarkable tenure of Ron 
Halber, who is recognizing his 25th year of 
service to the Jewish Community Relations 
Council of Greater Washington. Ron has 
served as the JCRC’s Executive Director since 
2001, and his passionate work in that role re-
flects his dedication to the DC-area Jewish 
community. 
Ron has transformed the JCRC of Greater 
Washington, turning it into one of the nation’s 
most robust Jewish community relations orga-
nizations. Under his leadership, the JCRC has 
advocated for numerous pieces of beneficial 
state and local legislation and has been able 
to vastly increase its programming in support 
of the organization’s mission. 
Ron is the deserving recipient of the 2006 
Ted B. Farber Professional Excellence Award 
and the 2001 Professional of the Year Award 
from the Association of Community Govern-
ment Affairs Directors. However, his career 
outside of JCRC has been just as remarkable 
as his career inside. He has long been in-
volved in his community, serving as the polit-
ical coordinator for the Montgomery County 
Democratic Party and, long before, as the 
community liaison for New York State Senator 
Martin Solomon. 
Ron Halber’s tenure has been beneficial for 
the State of Maryland, and I know that he will 
continue to serve the state as Executive Direc-
tor of the JCRC. His dedication to Maryland’s 
Jewish community and the greater Maryland 
community serves as an example for us all of 
what it means to be an American, committed 
to both pluralism and the common good. I 
hope that the House will join me in celebrating 
Mr. Halber’s contributions.

HONORING 
THE 
70TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PORT OF HAR-
LINGEN, TX 
HON. MAYRA FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mrs. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Port of Harlingen, Texas, as it 
celebrated its 70th anniversary this year. 
On February 27, 1952, John Fullbright, the 
President of the Intracoastal Canal Association 
of Louisiana and Texas, stood in front of a 
crowd and said, ‘‘Port Harlingen is now open 
for business!’’ For 70 years, the Port has 
served a major role in the growth and devel-
opment of those in the Rio Grande Valley and 
throughout the country. 
In 1926, Mr. Lon C. Hill, the first Mayor of 
Harlingen, envisioned that the newly formed 
city would be a vital port for the Arroyo Colo-
rado River. He was right. Soon after, he and 
several other colleagues began the process of 
creating the Port. From 1926 to 1941, the 
commissioners worked to secure the funding 
for the Port of Harlingen and in 1938, the U.S. 
Army Corp of Engineers approved the building 
of the channel. Not long after, construction 
began. For the next nine years, construction 
workers tirelessly worked to build the Port. Fi-
nally, the Port of Harlingen was finalized. On 
February 27, 1952, the Port was officially 
opened as it discharged its first cargo ship-
ment of steel pipes. 
Initially, the Port was responsible for trans-
porting steel, fuel, a variety of seafoods, and 
gasoline. Later, it quickly began to be a trans-
porter of fertilizer and liquid bulk. This meant 
that the Port could serve as a means of trans-
porting the goods local farmers produced as 
well as means of receiving the needed assist-
ance to increase their production. The Port of 
Harlingen continued to expand. In 1979, the 
construction of the Administration Building 
began, and in 1983, it officially changed its 
name to ‘‘The Port of Harlingen Authority’’. 
It also serves as the starting point of the 
Gulf-Intracoastal Waterway and has become a 
critical port for the South Texas as well as the 
rest of the country. The RGV would not be the 
area like we know it without the Port of Har-
lingen. It is an essential part for the people of 
the Valley as it employs just over 4,600 jobs 
for individuals directly and indirectly. 
It is for these reasons and our history that 
I congratulate the Port on its 70th anniversary 
and look to the future as it will continue to im-
pact the RGV.

RECOGNIZING THE KOREAN AND 
VIETNAM WAR VETERANS 
HON. CLIFF BENTZ 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the Korean and Vietnam War Veterans 
from Oregon’s Second Congressional District 
who are visiting their memorials on the Na-
tional Mall through the efforts of Honor Flight 
of Oregon. When I have the opportunity to 
meet these heroes, I am reminded of the en-
during words of General George S. Patton, 
who said, ‘‘Wars may be fought with weapons, 
but they are won by men. It is the spirit of 
men who follow and of the man who leads 
that gains that victory.’’ The words he spoke 
then, Madam Speaker, still ring true today. 
Those who value liberty are indebted to these 
heroes, for each one of them chose to defend 
freedom through acts of service, incredible 
sacrifice, and bravery on behalf of our country. 
It is my privilege to include in the Record their 
names. 
The Veterans on this Honor Flight from Or-
egon are as follows: Robert Altvatter, Army; 
Dennis Allen, Marine Corps; Kenneth Ander-
son, Navy; Fred Barber, Marine Corps; Keith 
Becker, Marine Corps; Robin Brown, Coast 
Guard; Ricky Davis, Air Force; James DeSully, 
Army; 
George 
Endicott, 
Army; 
Robert 
Fincham, Navy; James Gabriel, Navy; Vernon 
Gurney, Army; James Lindgen, Navy; Thomas 
Mabalot, 
Navy; 
Thomas 
McCann, 
Navy; 
James Mills, Navy; George Oldham, Army; Jo-
seph Petrelli, Navy; Thomas Queener, Navy; 
Wade Reece, Army; John Richardson, Marine 
Corps; Ronald Robbel, Army; Harold Schnei-
der, Navy; Gerald Smith, Army; Spencer Stew-
art, Marine Corps; Allan Tobiason, Army; Jay 
Turnage, Navy; Mark Wirges, Marine Corps, 
Jimmie Young, Marine Corps; and James 
Zupancic; Air Force. 
These heroes join over 240,000 Veterans 
who have been honored through the Honor 
Flight Network of volunteers nationwide since 
2005. I would also like to recognize volunteer 
Dr. Jana Frazier for her years of dedicated 
service to our Veterans and the Central Or-
egon Honor Flight. 
Madam Speaker, Ronald Reagan affirmed 
that, ‘‘We owe this freedom of choice and ac-
tion to those men and women in uniform who 
have served this Nation and its interests in 
time of need. In particular, we are forever in-
debted to those who have given their lives that 
we might be free.’’ As a nation, we must never 
take for granted the liberties we enjoy today, 
recognizing that these freedoms have been 
hard-won by the honor, commitment, and sac-
rifice of our Veterans. Each Member in this 
chamber and citizen in these United States 
should be humbled by the courage of the 
brave Veterans who voluntarily underwent 
dangers and successes in order to preserve 
our country and way of life. Colleagues, 
please join me in thanking these Veterans and 
the volunteers of Honor Flight of Oregon for 
their remarkable service and devotion to our 
great country.

CELEBRATING 10 YEARS OF 
CIRCLE THE CITY 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Cir-
cle the City. By recognizing health care as the 
first step to empowerment and independence, 
Circle the City is an invaluable community 
partner in addressing homelessness in Phoe-
nix. 
Founded by Sister Adele O’Sullivan, CSJ, 
MD, Circle the City opened the first medical 
respite center for people facing homelessness 
in Phoenix in 2012. Today, Circle the City op-
erates two medical respite centers, two out-
patient health care clinics, and four mobile 
medical units. The COVID–19 pandemic in-
creased homelessness in Phoenix dramatically 
and made providing health care to under-
served populations more important than ever. 
Circle the City rose to the challenge, providing 
vaccinations to the hardest to reach individ-
uals. As climate change continues to worsen 
extreme heat in Phoenix, Circle the City has 
been working to help people experiencing 
homelessness prevent and heal from heat ex-
haustion and dehydration. 
I would like to offer my deepest thanks to 
Circle the City for their work providing health 
care to a population that is too often over-
looked. I congratulate them on a decade of 
service and look forward to helping them 
achieve another 10 years.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CHUCK 
FUENTES 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a very heavy heart to honor the life 
of Chuck Fuentes, my dear friend and con-
fidant, who passed away on September 13 at 
the age of 70. 
Born March 16, 1952 in Whittier, CA to Rob-
ert H. and Theresa M. Fuentes, Charles Pat-
rick ‘‘Chuck’’ Fuentes was raised in the City of 
Norwalk, CA. He attended St. John of God 
Catholic School, St. John Bosco High School, 
Cerritos Community College, and the Univer-
sity of California-Berkeley. 
Chuck was raised a proud Democrat by his 
father, Robert H. ‘‘Bob’’ Fuentes, a politico of 
some note. Chuck ran countless campaigns 
and ran for office himself. He was a shrewd 
strategist with a keen sense of timing, and he 
had a knack for connecting a candidate’s vi-
sion to voters’ concerns. 
Chuck was a ubiquitous presence in city, 
county, state, and national politics, causes, 
and committees, and was elected the young-
est member of the Cerritos Community Col-
lege Board of Trustees. He served for 26 
years on the Democratic State Central Com-
mittee, was elected Vice Chair of the Cali-
fornia Democratic Patty in 1989, and was a 
delegate to the Democratic National Conven-
tion. 
Working at all levels of government, Chuck 
was at one time my right hand, serving as my 
advisor on the Norwalk City Council and my 
Chief of Staff in the State Assembly and the 
United States Congress. My gratitude for all 
his years of service knows no bounds. He was 
instrumental in helping guide me as a public 
servant but was so much more than an em-
ployee. Chuck was family, and his loss is im-
measurable. 
Chuck was also campaign manager for 
James K. Hahn in his final successful cam-
paign for City Controller and his later success-
ful campaigns for City Attorney and for Mayor 
of Los Angeles. He served as Chief Adminis-
trative Officer for the Los Angeles City Con-
troller’s Office and later as the Chief Adminis-
trative Officer for the Los Angeles City Attor-
ney. Chuck was City Manager of Pico Rivera 
and was General Manager at the Central 
Basin Municipal Water District. 
A devout Roman Catholic and member of 
the Knights of Columbus, Norwalk Council 
3678, Chuck was an active member of numer-
ous church communities and served as a par-
ish bereavement minister. 
Chuck is survived by his spouse, Linda L. 
Unruh; siblings Christine M. Fuentes, Roberta 
T. ‘‘Bobbi’’ Buescher, Andrea Kunkel (Robert), 
Cecilia C. Fuentes, Robert H. Fuentes III, 
Christopher Fuentes (Paul), and Joseph A. 
Fuentes (Amy); and godchildren Ryan A. 
Kunkel, 
Jonathan 
Palomares, 
Robert 
H. 
Fuentes IV, and Ray Morones. 
I extend my deepest sympathies to the fam-
ily, colleagues, and friends of Chuck Fuentes, 
and I urge all my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing his distinguished life and public serv-
ice. Although he is deeply missed, he will for-
ever remain in our hearts.

RECOGNIZING MRS. DIANE 
MESSER DODDS 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mrs. Diane Messer Dodds, 
for receiving the Bench and Bar Award, Kern 
County Bar Association’s most prestigious 
award. 
A graduate of Yale Law School, Mrs. Dodds 
was sworn into the California State Bar in 
1975 and began her lifelong commitment to 
provide outstanding legal services to those in 
need. She started her legal career working 
with the Legal Aid Office in Long Beach, Cali-
fornia. After a year there, she began clerking 
for U.S. District Judge Harry Pregerson. Fol-
lowing her clerkship, she would go on to work 
at the Western Center on Law and Poverty in 
Los Angeles. 
After her time with Western Center, Mrs. 
Dodds moved to Kernville after marrying her 
husband, Patrick. For 12 years, she would 
provide important legal services to the elderly 
throughout her community as she and Patrick 
raised their young children. This work led to 
her meeting Pat Jennison, an attorney in Ba-
kersfield, who has been a dear friend and im-
portant legal partner. The two would go on to 
open the law office of Jennison and Dodds in 
2007. 
For decades, Mrs. Dodds has provided vital 
legal services to clients throughout the Valley. 
Mrs. Dodd’s pro bono work has earned her 
special recognition from the California State 
Bar, as a recipient of the Wiley M. Manuel 
Award for Pro Bono Legal Services. Mrs. 
Dodds has dedicated thousands of hours to 
legal 
clinics 
for 
self-represented 
litigants 
through the Greater Bakersfield Legal Assist-
ance and the Kern County Law Library—even 
teaching a monthly class at the library for self- 
represented litigants for the past 15 years. 
Mrs. Dodds has rightfully received the 
praise of fellow attorneys, Judges, Bar Asso-
ciations throughout California, and most impor-
tantly—her clients. She has accomplished all 
of this while being a dedicated wife and loving 
mother to three children, and I cannot think of 
a more deserving recipient of this prestigious 
award than Mrs. Dodds. 
I ask my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing the incredible work of Mrs. Diane 
Messer Dodds for her accomplishment of re-
ceiving the Kern County Bar Association 
Bench and Bar Award. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL BLUE 
RIBBON SCHOOLS FOR 2022 
HON. BILL FOSTER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize three schools in the Illinois 11th 
Congressional district that have been named 
National Blue Ribbon Schools for 2022: Eisen-
hower Academy, Elmwood Elementary School, 
and Highlands Elementary School. These 
schools are recognized for their overall aca-
demic excellence on their progress in closing 
achievement gaps among student groups, 
demonstrating that all students can achieve at 
high levels. 
Throughout its 40-year history, the National 
Blue-Ribbon Schools Program has affirmed 
the hard work of students, educators, families, 
and communities in creating safe and wel-
coming schools where students master chal-
lenging content. The award flag gracing a 
school’s building has been widely recognized 
by everyone—from parents to policymakers— 
as a symbol of exemplary teaching and learn-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the faculty, staff, administra-
tors, parents, and students at these three 
schools for their great accomplishment.

Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Thelma Castillo and The 
Blue Water Area Chamber in Port Huron, 
Michigan for supporting, celebrating, and 
growing small businesses in Michigan. 
The Blue Water Area Chamber is hosting a 
MI New Favorite Snack competition this fall. 
The competition gives businesses with 10 or 
fewer employees a chance at a generous

coming businesses the chance to show off 
their products and promote them in an exciting 
new way. Participants look forward to the mar-
keting benefits as well as a chance at winning 
the cash prize to invest in the growth of their 
business. 
Small businesses are a critical part of our 
economy and community. We must continue 
to help them grow by supporting them in any 
way we can. I applaud the work of Thelma 
Castillo and The Blue Water Area Chamber 
for recognizing small businesses in Michigan.

CELEBRATING 125 YEARS OF OUR 
LADY 
OF 
PERPETUAL 
HELP 
CHURCH 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the 125th anniver-
sary of Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church. 
As the only Parish that serves the Old First 
Ward of Buffalo, this congregation has been a 
cornerstone of Buffalo for well over a century. 
In honor of this milestone, I wish to recognize 
all that the church has done to enrich count-
less Buffalo residents. 
Established on March 25, 1897, during the 
‘‘Feast of Annunciation,’’ Bishop James E. 
Quigley led its creation. Carving out portions 
of the St. Brigid and St. Stephen parishes, the 
Bishop began recruiting families to his own 
congregation. Along with Father O’Connell, 
who was chosen to be the first leader of the 
parish, Our Lady of Perpetual Help succeeded 
in incorporating over 800 families to the new 
congregation. 
Father O’Connell spearheaded the effort to 
develop the church, obtaining the land where 
the rectory and church now stand using funds 
donated to him by the JJ Glenny Estate. In 
collaboration with the Lansing and Beiri firm to 
design the church, Father O’Connell brought 
gothic styles popular during the Middle Ages 
to his parish with vertically pointed arches, 
ribbed vaulting, and floral design that can still 
be seen today. 
The parish celebrated its first Mass on July 
11, 1897, under the leadership of Father 
O’Connell. A few months later, the church 
opened its doors to students for Sunday 
school with a class size of 46 boys and 41 
girls. In 1909, the church acquired a three- 
story brick schoolhouse in honor of Father 
O’Connell who had passed a few years prior. 
The street the parish now stands on was also 
later renamed after him in honor of all he had 
done for his congregation. The school closed 
its doors in 1971 after over 2,900 students re-
ceived an education. 
Our Lady of Perpetual Help is currently led 
by Father Paul Seil who continues to be a be-
loved public figure. Since joining the parish, 
Father Seil has led numerous restoration ef-
forts at the churches as well as increasing the 
Church’s social media presence to allow for 
congregation members to stay connected. 
With a large hall, four meeting rooms, a stage, 
and a kitchen in the building’s basement, Our 
Lady hosts a myriad of activities to strengthen 
community ties. The Church also encourages 
youth organizations by sponsoring Boy Scout 
and Girl Scout troops . 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to honor 
the contributions Our Lady of Perpetual Help 
has made to our community for the past 125 
years.

Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to

art, Sr., and congratulate him for reaching the 
milestone of 45 years of service as the senior 
pastor of First Institutional Baptist Church of 
Phoenix. Our community is so fortunate that 
Pastor Stewart has devoted his life to mean-
ingful service that has made a difference in 
the lives of many, and I am personally grateful 
to call this civil rights leader, humanitarian, 
scholar and author a friend. 
Pastor Stewart answered the call early in 
life and preached his first sermon when he 
was just 17 years old. Several years later he 
became the pastor at First Institutional Baptist, 
the youngest—and eventually longest serv-
ing—in the church’s history. 
During his tenure, he has led his congrega-
tion through transformative growth and his im-
pact stretches far beyond his spirited sermons 
from the pulpit. He created a family resource 
center, the Samaritan House for homeless 
families, a home for teenage mothers and ex-
panded the church’s education and outreach 
services. Each of these have changed the tra-
jectory of people’s lives for the better. 
Through many challenging moments in our 
community’s recent history, Pastor Stewart 
has offered a voice of moral clarity. He’s stood 
up to the darkest forces in our state and pre-
vailed. When the extremists first stopped Ari-
zona from recognizing Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Day, it was Pastor Stewart who organized, 
mobilized and energized the campaign to 
make that day a reality in our state. 
It’s not just Arizona where his legacy lives. 
He’s preached throughout the United States 
and in more than 50 countries. While over-
seas, Pastor Stewart helped build a new 
church edifice and parsonage in the Republic 
of South Africa. 
Arizona is fortunate to have experienced 45 
years of Pastor Stewart’s leadership, and we 
are hopeful for many more. 
I thank Pastor Stewart for his friendship and 
service, and extend congratulations to him on 
this significant milestone.

HONORING THE TOWN OF GLEN 
ELLEN AND THE GLEN ELLEN 
POST OFFICE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 150th 
year milestone of Glen Ellen and the Glen 
Ellen Post Office in Sonoma County, Cali-
fornia. 
Originating on July 19, 1872, Glen Ellen 
was named after Ellen Mary Stuart, the wife of 
Colonel Charles Stuart. Glen Ellen is located 
in the canyon between the Mayacamas Moun-
tain Range and Sonoma Mountain. The beau-
tiful Calabasas and Sonoma creeks run 
through downtown Glen Ellen further adding to 
the immaculate scenery. 
Glen Ellen, part of the historic Valley of the 
Moon, is home to many Sonoma County 
wineries and culinary gems. It is home to 
nearly 800 people but also serves as a get-
away for many California residents due to the 
various hiking trails and its close proximity to 
Sonoma Valley Regional Park. 
The Glen Ellen Post Office holds historical 
value in the community it serves. It was cre-
ated at the same time as the town and has 
been led by a distinguished list of post-
masters, such as Charles Justi, John Gibson, 
and Charles Crofoot. The post office is located 
in historic Jack London country, surrounded by 
vineyards. 
One of the most notable attractions of Glen 
Ellen is the Jack London State Historic Park. 
Created in 1960 and named after author and 
owner Jack London, the park spans fourteen 
hundred acres and contains a winery dating 
back to the 19th century, as well as a variety 
of orchards and historic structures. Celebra-
tions commemorating Glen Ellen and its post 
office have been held here, signifying the im-
portance of the park and the historical signifi-
cance it has to the community. 
Glen Ellen is a place for Californians to 
seek quiet and relaxation. The variety of at-
tractions, including wineries, restaurants, hik-
ing trails, historic landmarks, such as the Mill, 
all contribute to the town and its community. 
Along with the historic Glen Ellen Post Office, 
these attractions are an important part of what 
make Glen Ellen a special place to live. 
Madam Speaker, it is therefore appropriate 
that we acknowledge Glen Ellen’s 150th mile-
stone and wish them another 150 years of 
success.

September 19, 2022 
The company’s achievement was part of the 
50th anniversary celebration of their produc-
tion plant in Logan, Utah. It took the Schreiber 
Foods team 3 hours and 26 minutes to cook 
the recipe, finishing with a super-sized maca-
roni and cheese weighing in at 2,151 kg. They 
invited the public to eat the thousands of 
servings of the mac ’n cheese and partnered 
with a local food pantry to donate the remain-
ing food. For over 30 years, Schreiber Foods 
has shared their delicious dairy products with 
consumers across the globe. Founded in 
1945, Schreiber foods began as a small 
cheese production plant, located in an old 
brewery building in Green Bay, WI. Since its 
founding, they have grown to become one of 
the largest privately held dairy production 
companies in the world, with more than 30 lo-
cations spread across North America, South 
America, Europe, and Asia. Through their ex-
pansion, Schreiber Foods has also become 
one of the leading suppliers of cheese to fast- 
food restaurant chains, supplying cheese 
slices to 17 of the top 20 hamburger chains. 
Although Schreiber Foods has come a long 
way from its modest beginnings, their commit-
ment to integrity and quality products hasn’t 
been left behind. From day one, the company 
followed the ‘‘16 ounces to the pound’’ philos-
ophy, stating that one pound of cheese would 
weigh no more, and no less than 16 oz. 
Today, Schreiber still uses ‘‘16 ounces to the 
pound’’ as a basis for two characteristics of 
their company: unquestionable integrity and an 
ongoing commitment to quality. I commend 
Schreiber Foods for their commitment to cus-
tomer satisfaction that has led to their contin-
ued success for over 30 years. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to congratu-
late 
Schreiber 
Foods 
on 
achieving 
the 
Guinness World Records title for the largest 
macaroni and cheese and for their ongoing 
commitment to quality and customer satisfac-
tion.

HYDROCEPHALUS AWARENESS 
MONTH 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
patients, caregivers, and other advocates 
across the country come together every Sep-
tember to raise awareness of this condition. 
As Co-chair—with Representative LLOYD DOG-
GETT—of the Congressional Pediatric and 
Adult Hydrocephalus Caucus I want to ex-
press my support for Hydrocephalus Aware-
ness Month and urge my colleagues to join 
our caucus and cosponsor H. Res. 20, the Na-
tional Hydrocephalus Awareness Month Reso-
lution. 
The mission of our caucus is to raise aware-
ness and inspire members of Congress to 
consider policy options that assist the hydro-
cephalus community. Hydrocephalus affects 
over one million Americans—infants, children, 
adults, and especially our seniors—with a 
prevalence in our elderly (175/100,000) equal 
to more than twice as that for infants and chil-
dren (88/100,000). 
We need members of Congress and their 
staff to understand that anyone can acquire 
hydrocephalus at any time. 
Hydrocephalus—a build-up of cerebrospinal 
fluid in the brain—is colloquially known as 
‘‘water on the brain.’’ Everyone, from babies to 
the elderly, can develop it. While some cases 
are congenital, it can also be caused by a 
traumatic brain injury, an infection, or even 
just develop as part of the aging process. 
Brain surgery is the only treatment—many 
patients endure dozens of surgeries in their 
lifetime. There is no cure—yet—but Congress 
can play a role in moving the ball forward. 
In addition to impacting people across the 
country, I’ve seen the success of treating peo-
ple faced with hydrocephalus in my own dis-
trict. The pediatric division of New Neurons 
Neurosurgery Institute (NNNI) in New Jersey, 
for example, plays a critical role in addressing 
the needs of thousands of children with hydro-
cephalus in New Jersey and around the coun-
try. With the expertise in the kinds of brain 
surgeries essential for survival, dedicated 
medical professionals such as Dr. Lawrence 
Daniels and his colleagues at NNNI save lives 
every day. 
NNNI with Carly Weisman, who organizes 
the annual Jersey Shore WALK to End Hydro-
cephalus, are advocating and fighting hard in 
my district to bring greater awareness and 
help find a cure. 
Nationwide, over 400,000 babies a year are 
born with hydrocephalus. Yet, the United 
States is not alone in this struggle—it is a 
worldwide problem—which is why I have intro-
duced the Global Brain Health Act. This Act 
authorizes hydrocephalus funding from the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. This ap-
proach would ensure more robust foreign as-
sistance for treating people in developing 
countries with hydrocephalus and other brain 
health-related conditions. 
It is essential for members of Congress to 
better understand this condition and its pro-
found impact on the people we represent, and 
the hydrocephalus caucus is a great way to 
help achieve that goal. 
I urge my colleagues to mark Hydro-
cephalus Awareness Month by joining the bi-
partisan Congressional Adult and Pediatric Hy-
drocephalus Caucus and by cosponsoring H. 
Res. 20. As a member you will not only help 
raise awareness but may also play a role in 
creating public policies that lead to better 
treatments and possibly even a cure.

HONORING DANIEL BORYTA 
HON. VIRGINIA FOXX 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Daniel Albert Boryta, an ex-
emplary North Carolinian who worked as a 
chemist for Cypress Foot Mineral Kings Moun-
tain, North Carolina. 
Daniel is remembered by many not only for 
his bright smile and friendly demeanor, but 
also for his innumerable contributions to the 
field of chemistry. 
His bailiwick was producing innovative com-
pounds that involved lithium. 
From creating solutions to extract lithium 
from salt brines in Chile to his patented lithium 
hydroxide compound that’s still used in space 
exploration by NASA, Daniel’s accomplish-
ments are second to none. The impact of his 
work has made a profound impact upon soci-
ety. 
Madam Speaker, I’m confident that genera-
tions of Americans to come will look upon 
Daniel’s work, and the vibrant legacy that he 
has left behind, in pure admiration.

IN 
CELEBRATION 
OF 
THE 
KC 
SHEPHERD’S CENTER 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 19, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the KC Shepherd’s Cen-
ter on their 50th anniversary and their 5th an-
nual 70 Over 70 Awards. These are out-
standing achievements. The efforts of the KC 
Shepherd’s Center to support, celebrate, and 
empower the older residents of the Greater 
Kansas City area by fostering independence 
and connection are truly commendable. As the 
Nation’s first Shepherd’s Center, the Kansas 
City location serves as a model for the 56 
Shepherd’s Centers across the country work-
ing to create a better world for senior citizens. 
As we look back on the previous five decades, 
let us take a moment to reflect on all of the 
invaluable services the KC Shepherd’s Center 
has provided to the aging populations of Mis-
souri’s Fifth Congressional District. 
By reducing isolation and loneliness, in-
creasing social connection and activity, and 
creating opportunities for purposeful living, the 
KC Shepherd’s Center makes a profound im-
pact on the overall health of the seniors the 
organization serves. Moreover, by providing 
Meals on Wheels to over 1,000 elderly adults 
each week, the KC Shepherd’s Center has 
made significant progress toward reducing 
food insecurity among older generations. To-
gether, these efforts ensure that the Greater 
Kansas City area is a fine place to live for 
aging populations. 
Founded in 1972 by Dr. Elbert Cole, then 
Pastor at Central United Methodist Church, 
the KC Shepherd’s Center has faithfully lived 
up to its ‘‘of seniors, by seniors, for seniors’’ 
model. Believing firmly in the importance of lis-
tening to the voices and wisdom of older 
adults, the KC Shepherd’s Center has built its 
programs around the needs expressed by 
senior citizens in our local communities. In 
doing so, the KC Shepherd’s Center has 
helped thousands of seniors over the last five 
decades stay active, receive the care they 
need, and remain in their own homes as long 
as possible, leading meaningful, independent 
lives. 
Each year, the KC Shepherd’s Center pro-
vides services to more than 2,800 older adults 
in the Kansas City region. Guided by their un-
derstanding that social engagement is not a 
luxury but a basic human need, the volunteers 
and staff at the Shepherd’s Center help re-
duce the devastating physical, emotional, and 
mental impacts of isolation and loneliness. To 
fully understand the impact that the KC Shep-
herd’s Center has on the local senior popu-
lation, however, one must look not only at 
numbers and figures, but to the ‘‘Shepherd’’ of 
the 23rd Psalm, from which this organization 
takes its name. Indeed, the volunteers and 
staff at the KC Shepherd’s Center are ‘‘thy rod

and thy staff’’ for the thousands of senior citi-
zens they faithfully serve. In other words, they 
are truly doing God’s work. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Missouri’s 
Fifth Congressional District, I want to con-
gratulate everyone at KC Shepherd’s Center 
on their 50th year anniversary as well as their 
5th annual 70 Over 70 Awards. The Shepherd 
Center’s contributions to Kansas City’s older 
population cannot be overstated, and it is a 
true honor to serve as their Congressman.
