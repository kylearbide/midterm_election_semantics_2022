Holy and eternal God, we pause 
today, united in our grief at the loss of 
Congressman 
Jim 
Hagedorn, 
Rep-
resentative of Minnesota’s First Dis-
trict. 
Those whom he served and we who 
have known him have been graced by a 
gracious man. Through his love of 
country and of Minnesota, You have in-
spired us by this public servant who 
grasped confidently and courageously 
his life’s dream to serve others while 
serving You. 
We ask that You give comfort to his 
wife, Jennifer Carnahan, as she endures 
a broken heart and a shattered spirit. 
May she know that You hold her firmly 
in Your tender embrace in these days 
of sadness. 
Bless those who served with him. 
May they be sustained by the faith 
that Representative Hagedorn claimed 
as the source of his strength through-
out his life and in his recent battle 
with cancer. 
May Representative Hagedorn’s leg-
acy of service to this country, his 
heartfelt dedication to the ideals he 
held strongly, and his faithfulness to 
You serve as an inspiration to each of 
us. And may his memory be a blessing 
to all. 
We offer this prayer upheld in Your 
most holy name. 
Amen.

HONORING KATHY KANE AND THE 
TRENTON TRIB 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Kathy Kane on the occa-
sion of her retirement from the Trenton Trib, 
where she has served as Business Manager 
and Co-Publisher for over twelve years. Her 
significant contributions and service to our 
community are worthy of commendation. 
Ms. Kane received her Bachelor of Science 
in Hospitality and Marketing from Central 
Michigan University. She was co-publisher of 
the Trenton Trib, which was founded in 2009 
in response to community concerns about the 
lack of a hometown newspaper. In addition to 
her work in journalism, Ms. Kane is also the 
President of Market Insights LLC, a company 
that creates and implements marketing strate-
gies for businesses and organizations. 
The Trenton Trib and the Island Beacon has 
served a variety of local institutions with its 
varied and engaging reporting. In the years 
since its founding, it has become a multi-
faceted news organization and has presented 
the news that matters to the citizens of Tren-
ton and Downriver. From the latest in high 
school sports to breaking development news 
to highlighting local businesses, the Trib could 
always be counted on to write about the things 
that our neighbors cared about. Along with co- 
publisher Joe Hoshaw, they brought news to 
the people of Downriver. The Trenton Trib 
ceased publication at the end of 2021, but 
their impact on the community will last for 
years to come. 
As an involved community member, Ms. 
Kane is a member of the Trenton Business 
Association, Trenton Rotary, Southern Wayne 
County Regional Chamber, and the Downriver 
Business Association. She is known for her 
broad insight and marketing expertise, as well 
as her kindness and friendly demeanor. Her 
commitment to Southeast Michigan and or 
local news cannot be understated. She con-
tinues to reside in Downriver with her husband 
Matthew and sons Dustin and Timothy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Kathy Kane. We are grateful 
for her years spent at the Trenton Trib and her 
dedication to the residents of southeastern 
Michigan. I join with Kathy’s family, friends, 
and colleagues in extending my best wishes to 
her in retirement.

CONGRATULATING 
DEBORAH 
HEART AND LUNG CENTER ON 
THEIR 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate Deborah Heart and 
Lung Center on their 100th anniversary. Debo-
rah is a true leader for cardiovascular and pul-
monary care throughout the state with a mis-
sion of providing quality care to our community 
and beyond. 
One hundred years ago, the hospital started 
as a tuberculosis and pulmonary center. As 
advancements in antibiotics led to the eradi-
cation of tuberculosis, Deborah began to con-
centrate on other chest diseases. 
Today, Deborah serves as New Jersey’s 
only specialty heart hospital and has become 
a cornerstone of compassionate care in our 
region. Deborah maintains a distinguished rep-
utation for educating the next generation 
through one of the largest cardiac teaching fel-
lowship programs in the country, and consist-
ently debuts innovative cardiac treatments 
through their clinical research department. 
In addition to serving as New Jersey’s 
‘‘safety net’’ hospital, providing unparalleled 
care to residents of all twenty-one New Jersey 
counties, Deborah in its 100 years has treated 
2.3 million patients from every county in the 
state and from 87 countries throughout the 
world. 
From the beginning, Deborah’s medical 
treatment was provided by a staff known for 
their compassion and medical excellence. At a 
time when millions of Americans are making 
the tough decisions between keeping food on 
the table and healthcare, Deborah has never 
issued a bill to one of its patients. 
The work Deborah Heart and Lung Center 
is doing makes a real impact on the lives of 
everyone in our community. On Deborah’s 
100th anniversary, I extend my best wishes 
and thanks to every current and former staff 
member and volunteer.

HONORING TEXAS STATE HOUSE 
REPRESENTATIVE EDDIE LUCIO, 
III 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, l rise to recog-
nize The Honorable Eddie Lucio, III, who has 
admirably represented the people of south-
western Cameron County in the Texas House 
of Representatives for the past 15 years. 
Eduardo Andres ‘‘Eddie’’ Lucio, III was born 
in Brownsville, TX, on December 19, 1978, to 
Andres ‘‘Eddie’’ Lucio, Jr., and Herminia 
Cerda Lucio. He graduated from James Pace 
High School in 1997 and attended Texas Tech 
University for a year before transferring to the 
University of Texas at Austin, where he 
earned a Bachelor of Business Administration 
in 2001 and a J.D. from the University of 
Texas School of Law in 2005. 
After law school Eddie was called to public 
service, a value instilled in him at a young age 
by his parents. He worked for the Texas 
Comptroller for Public Accounts before running 
for Texas State Representative of District 38 
in 2006, a position he won and to which he 
was re-elected in every consecutive election 
until he announced his retirement in 2022. 
Eddie worked tirelessly to improve the qual-
ity of life for residents of Cameron County dur-
ing his tenure in the Texas House of Rep-
resentatives and through his work as a lawyer. 
His efforts have made an indelible impact on 
the Rio Grande Valley, especially in the areas 
of children and families, education, and the 
environment. 
As a state representative, he found a way to 
make Pre-K education cost-neutral for Cam-
eron County school districts, giving young chil-
dren a better chance to succeed in school; 
and championed legislation that gave foster 
children a voice in their placement. Eddie also 
aided in the creation of the University of 
Texas–Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV) in 2013, 
which came into being through the merging of 
the University of Texas–Pan American and the 
University of Texas at Brownsville/Texas 
Southmost College. UTRGV has had a trans-
formative influence on the community thanks 
to its affordable tuition, its diverse academic 
curriculum, and the establishment of a new 
medical school that fills a void in an area of 
the country that is medically underserved. 
Eddie’s concern for the environment is evi-
dent in his work to pass legislation to preserve 
Texas’ access to water for future generations 
through the creation of a regulator system for 
seawater desalination, and his efforts to se-
cure funding for the State Water Plan. He also 
led the effort in the Texas House to make it 
illegal to buy or sell shark fins in Texas, re-
ceiving special recognition for the bill’s pas-
sage by the Discovery Channel during its an-
nual Shark Week programming. 
In addition to his work in the Texas House 
of Representatives and his law practice, Ed-

IN RECOGNITION OF LETRENT’S 
PHARMACY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Letrent’s Phar-
macy as they celebrate their 50th anniversary 
of serving the people of Bedford, Pennsyl-
vania. For 50 years, Letrent’s Pharmacy has 
served the people in that community with the 
utmost care and consideration. The pharmacy 
has been a family owned and operated busi-
ness since Richard Letrent opened the phar-
macy in 1972 after spending 5 years in an-
other location not too far from his current flag-
ship store. 
Richard, his wife Connie and their daughter, 
Connie are all proud alumni of Duquesne Uni-
versity in Pittsburgh, and their tight-knit family 
make up three of the five practicing phar-
macists at Letrent’s. 
Throughout the time they have operated the 
pharmacy, the Letrent’s have dedicated them-
selves to ensuring the health and wellness of 
the Bedford County community. 
On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania’s 
13th Congressional District it is my honor to 
wish the Letrent family a happy 50th anniver-
sary, and many, many more to come. Con-
gratulations on this incredible milestone.

CELEBRATING THE LEGACY AND 
MINISTRY OF THE FIRST PRES-
BYTERIAN 
CHURCH 
OF 
COLO-
RADO SPRINGS 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the legacy and ministry of 
the First Presbyterian Church of Colorado 
Springs. 
2022 marks First Pres’s 150th year of min-
istry to Colorado Springs. This congregation 
has distinguished itself as a church after 
God’s own heart in that time. To quote one of 
its former pastors, First Presbyterian is ‘‘a 
church rich in fellowship, broad in outreach, 
evangelical in spirit, and generous in attitude.’’ 
Founded in 1872, this church has been a 
pillar to our community since its inception. It 
has faithfully ministered to over six genera-
tions of Coloradans with one straightforward 
mission; to reflect the love of Jesus Christ into 
their community. 
Their congregation has demonstrated this 
time and time again through their generous 
philanthropic efforts and numerous community 
partnerships. They donate millions of dollars 
annually 
to 
local 
engagement, 
proudly 
partnering with over 18 local missions and 
non-profits. Together, they help fight against 
the prevalent problems facing our community, 
such as homelessness, food insecurity, and 
the absence of affordable healthcare and 
housing. 
This church truly embodies the principle 
found in Acts 20:35, ‘‘it is more blessed to 
give than receive.’’ The members of this 
church live out what it means to love their 
neighbor as themselves for the sake of the 
Gospel. 
It is undeniable that First Pres has helped to 
shape the life and soul of Colorado Springs 
from a frontier town into the nationally ac-
claimed city on the hill that it is today. 
As we look forward to many more genera-
tions of life-changing ministry, I’m honored to 
gratefully reflect on the last 150 years of 
impactful work that God has done through 
First Presbyterian Church of Colorado Springs. 
I ask that my colleagues in Congress join me 
in honoring this institution of faith and grace.

REMEMBERING GARY LEE 
GUTELIUS 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of my dear friend Gary Lee 
Gutelius, who passed away on Saturday, Feb-
ruary 12, 2022, at the age of 74. We are all 
heartbroken by his passing because he was 
the friend that was always there to help and 
support. It didn’t matter the cause or the 
event, Gary showed up. He understood that 
the best lives lived are those of service. He 
knew how to be a friend even in tough times. 
His death is a blow to our entire community, 
and we all need to do more for each other to 
try to make up for this tremendous loss. 
He was born on February 12, 1948, in War-
ren, the second son of the late Harold and 
Ruth Harsh Gutelius. Gary was a 1966 grad-
uate of Warren G. Harding High School. After 
graduating, Gary was drafted into the United 
States Army in 1967, serving with the 101st 
Airborne Division in the Vietnam War. During 
his tour, Gary took part in Operation Apache 
Snow, where be was wounded at the Battle of 
Hamburger Hill. For his meritorious service 
during his service, he would receive the 
Bronze Star medal and the Purple Heart. 
After returning home, Gary would become a 
well-known figure in our community, especially 
with veterans. He would work for Packard 
Electric from 1970 to 2006 and serve as presi-
dent of their veteran’s committee for 16 years. 
Gary belonged to many different veteran orga-
nizations, including being a lifetime member 
of: D.A.V. Chapter 11, the VFW Post 1090, 
the Military Order of the Purple Heart Chapter 
606 where he served as Senior Vice Com-
mander, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the 
American Legion Post 540 and the Amvets 
Post 290. Gary headed up the Veterans Day 
and Memorial Day committee for Trumbull 
County, as well as organized volunteers every 
year to decorate the veterans’ graves for Me-
morial Day. He was also one of five individ-
uals responsible for bringing the Vietnam Wall 
That Heals to Warren. Gary became a veteran 
services commissioner in 2013 and was hon-
ored as a Tribune Chronicle ‘‘Community Star’’ 
and received the Valley Legacy award in 
2014. In 2018, Gary had the honor of placing 
a wreath on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier 
at Arlington National Cemetery on the 100th 
anniversary of Veterans Day. 
He was a member of Grace United Meth-
odist Church of Warren and enjoyed boating, 
skiing, and hunting. Gary had dreams of re-
storing his cherished MG car and was a finan-
cial supporter for the restoration and upkeep 
of the Gutelius home and museum in 
Mifflinburg, Pennsylvania. 
He was predeceased by his parents, Harold 
Gutelius and Ruth Harsh Gutelius. He is sur-
vived by his siblings, Dan Gutelius (Pat) of 
Howland and Pam Swanson (Jeff) of Canfield; 
his girlfriend Anna Marie Rosasco of Cham-
pion; his nephew Steve Gutelius (Marissa) of 
Howland; his niece Beth Kant: (Adam) of 
Cortland; his great-nephews, Jackson and 
Dylan; and his great-niece Lyla.

HONORING STAFF SERGEANT 
BRIAN C. DARLING 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Staff Sergeant Brian C. 
Darling, who recently retired after nearly three 
decades in the United States Army and the 
New Jersey Army National Guard. 
Brian grew up in Manchester, NJ, and was 
inspired by his familial legacy of service. He 
decided to carry that torch himself and en-
listed in the active-duty Army in 1995. Brian 
was deployed overseas for several years as a 
Paralegal Specialist where he provided legal 
and administrative support to the Army’s legal 
team. Over the course of his service, he 
served tours in Iraq in 2008, Afghanistan in 
2010, and Qatar from 2014–2015. He spent 
the past year as an active part of the Army’s 
mission to fight COVID–19 and is retiring at 
the rank of Staff Sergeant. Brian’s service 
hasn’t ended with his retirement, he continues 
to be a valued schoolteacher in the Central 
Regional School District of Bayville, New Jer-
sey. 
I would like to formally thank Staff Sergeant 
Darling for his service to the United States of 
America and his continued contributions to our 
community.

Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor Ms. Silvia Miranda of Mesa 
Elementary School in Clovis, New Mexico, for 
her incredible commitment to New Mexico’s 
children, schools, and community. 
The National Science Foundation (NSF) re-
cently awarded Ms. Miranda the Presidential

nology, engineering, mathematics, and com-
puter science teachers. It is the highest honor 
our nation can bestow to a math or science 
teacher. 
This prestigious award is only one of many 
things Ms. Miranda has achieved over her il-
lustrious career. The award echoes the praise

colleagues who describe her as an asset and 
a blessing to Clovis Municipal Schools and to 
those whom she works with. In addition to 
being an experienced bilingual educator, Ms. 
Miranda also engages students by helping to 
organize the Mesa Science Fair and Spanish 
Spelling Bee. Her dedication and passion is 
the foundation for the academic and personal 
growth of her students both when she is their 
teacher and long after. 
Ms. Miranda is a shining example of the 
passion and dedication that define our great 
state, and we are proud that she calls New 
Mexico home. I offer my congratulations to 
Ms. Miranda and thank her from the bottom of 
my heart for her contributions to the future of 
New Mexico—our youth.

REMEMBERING WALTER IGNATIUS 
WILLARD 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the late Walter Ignatius 
Willard. 
Walter was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, 
on April 14, 1957, the fifth child of twelve born 
to the late Elliot ‘‘Doc’’ Willard Sr. and Mary 
Jane Jordan Willard. He passed away peace-
fully on February 11, 2022, at the age of 64, 
after a well-fought battle with early-onset Alz-
heimer’s disease. He is survived by the love of 
his life, Valerie ‘‘Missy’’ Sims; their three 
daughters, Jordan, Jillian, and Jenna; his elev-
en siblings; and many nephews, nieces, and 
friends. 
A proud Purple Knight, Walter attended St. 
Augustine High School, and prior to grad-
uating in 1975, played trumpet for St. Aug’s 
renowned Marching 100. He not only was the 
trumpet section leader, but also was the first 
musician selected to play the band’s newly in-
troduced herald trumpet. He then earned a 
B.A. in political science in 1979 at Tulane Uni-
versity, where his ceaseless love of music led 
him to join the university’s marching band. 
Walter then ventured to Washington, D.C., 
where he obtained his J.D. from the American 
University Washington College of Law in 1982. 
While in the nation’s capital, Walter worked in 
the Capitol Hill offices of Louisiana Congress-
man Gillis Long, Senator Russell Long, and 
Senator J. Bennett Johnston. 
Walter returned to New Orleans to start his 
law career, eventually earning a Master of 
Law degree in energy and environment from 
Tulane Law School in 1993. Over the course 
of his 30-year legal career, he was admitted to 
the bar for the states of Louisiana, New Jer-
sey, and Pennsylvania, and served as judge 
pro tempore for the Orleans Civil District 
Court. As Dr. Martin Luther King once said, 
‘‘True peace is not merely the absence of ten-
sion; it is the presence of justice.’’ A pas-
sionate advocate for justice, Walter spent his 
career leveraging his judgment and compas-
sion in the pursuit of Dr. King’s vision for au-
thentic peace. One of his greatest endeavors 
in this regard was acting as one of the plain-
tiffs in the historic Supreme Court redistricting 
case Chisolm v. Edwards, which set the stage 
for Louisiana’s first African American Supreme 
Court justice. 
Walter’s remarkable life was characterized 
by unconditional love and support for family 
and friends, zealous engagement with commu-
nity programs and initiatives to improve life for 
others, and an ardent devotion to God. A life-
long parishioner at St. Raymond Catholic 
Church, he was an altar boy in his youth and 
became a member of the church’s choir as an 
adult. Selflessly committed to the betterment 
of his community, Walter’s civic involvements 
included acting as a voluntary attorney in child 
neglect cases for the Orleans Parish Juvenile 
Court CASA program, participating on the 
mayor’s Environmental Affairs Advisory Com-
mittee as well as the Task Force on City- 
Owned Cemeteries, and serving as a member 
and chair of the New Orleans Historic District 
Landmarks Commission. Additionally, Walter 
was a 30-year member of the Sugar Bowl 
Committee and a nine-year board member of 
both the Young Leadership Council and 
Young Audiences of Louisiana organization. 
A veritable Renaissance Man, one could 
easily find Walter in a courtroom arguing a 
case, at Tipitina’s jamming out to the Soul 
Rebels, at the Riverbend coaching his daugh-
ters’ soccer teams, at the Loyola gym picking 
up a game of basketball, in the kitchen making 
omelets, in the yard planting a garden, restor-
ing an old car, or playing with the family’s me-
nagerie of pets. He was a wonder to all who 
knew and loved him, and he will be remem-
bered fondly for his joyful spirit and relentless 
optimism, which served him well until God 
called him home. The loss and death of Wal-
ter bears witness to the divine and mysterious 
power of redemptive suffering. Through his 
heroic battle, Walter has helped shower nu-
merous heavenly graces and blessings upon 
all of those he loved so deeply, and we are 
eternally grateful.

HONORING MICHAEL MEDART 
HON. ANN WAGNER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate 
my 
friend, 
Michael 
‘‘Mike’’ 
Medart, of Medart Engine & Marine, on the 
conclusion of his tenure as Chairman of the 
National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors 
(NAW), an association comprised of the dis-
tributors who keep America moving. 
During Mike’s leadership, NAW fought for 
and defended pro-business policies that boost 
our local economies. NAW, with its partners, 
also donated more than $1 million in PPE and 
other supplies to help reopen America. NAW 
saw rapid growth in the industry and the asso-
ciation itself and was crucial in reopening 
America at a critical time. 
The name Medart is familiar to Missourians 
in my district and our region, having been a 
mainstay in the community for more than 100 
years. Mike is at the helm of a third generation 
of leadership, an incredible legacy of which he 
should be proud. The family-owned company 
prioritizes a ‘‘Golden Rule Service’’ commit-
ment to their customers and employs more 
than a hundred workers, with many having 
been with the company for decades. 
I congratulate Mike and thank him for his 
leadership nationally and at home in Missouri! 
HONORING WGY NEWS RADIO ON 
THEIR ONE HUNDREDTH ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and congratulate WGY News 
Radio on celebrating 100 years of informing 
and entertaining New Yorkers. 
WGY was first established when General 
Electric received their Broadcasting License 
and was randomly assigned the now ac-
claimed letters WGY on February 4, 1922. 
WGY’s first broadcast took place on February 
20, 1922, 7:47 p.m. in Schenectady, New 
York. WGY employees were pioneers in the 
new wireless radio technology sector, which is 
evident in the station’s incredible accomplish-
ments. WGY was the first radio station in New 
York State and, in 1926, it became the first 
NBC affiliate station. Since then, the station 
has established itself as one of the premier 
sources of news and entertainment for the 
North Country while also providing a space for 
major historical moments. 
While he was governor of New York, Frank-
lin D. Roosevelt began broadcasting his now 
famous fireside chats on WGY. In 1923, WGY 
became the first radio station to solve a major 
criminal case, when Verner Alexanderson was 
returned home after being kidnapped due to 
the on-air efforts to make the public aware of 
his disappearance. WGY was the home of 
The Rush Limbaugh Show before its conclu-
sion in 2021 and continues to broadcast many 
talk show programs, fulfilling its mission to en-
rich and connect New Yorkers. 
WGY prides itself on being an exceptional 
source of public service and engagement, as 
evidenced by its numerous awards and 
achievements. In 2009, WGY won the Radio 
Television Digital News Association Edward R. 
Murrow Award for its exceptional reporting on 
the Capital Region ice storm. During the 2021 
Awards for Excellence in Broadcasting, WGY 
won awards in categories including Out-
standing Public Service Announcement and 
Campaign, Outstanding Interview, and Out-
standing Use of Digital Platforms. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I con-
gratulate WGY News Radio for 100 years of 
exemplary service to the people of New York 
State, including North Country families. The 
station’s active engagement with the commu-
nity and public service continues to inspire, 
connect, and enrich the lives of New Yorkers.

TRIBUTE TO SAM COHEN ON HIS 
60TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA

Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Sam Cohen on the occa-
sion of his 60th birthday for his distinguished 
service over the years. Sam serves as the 
Legal and Government Affairs Officer of the 
Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians located 
in my district, where he has supported the 
Tribe’s leadership and members for more than

a decade and a half. In doing so, Sam has be-
come an exemplar of civic engagement 
throughout the Central Coast and in Wash-
ington, DC. 
Sam’s path to becoming a leader in our 
community and throughout Indian country is 
as unique as they come. 
After graduating from the University of Ari-
zona and University of Minnesota Law School, 
Sam began his career in the world of inter-
national corporate and finance law. This work 
took him around the world, including a two- 
year stint in Tokyo, Japan. Sam briefly re-
turned to the states to pursue his LLM degree 
in tax at NYU before once again venturing off 
the beaten path, this time to the U.S. Territory 
of Guam. While in Guam, Sam found his call-
ing in more ways than one. First, he came to 
understand and appreciate the vital role that 
economic development plays in providing op-
portunity and equity to marginalized commu-
nities. His four years working to support com-
panies investing in Guam struck a chord, as 
such Sam has gone on to spend the next 25 
years working on behalf of many communities 
that have historically been passed over and 
overlooked in the economic opportunities af-
forded to many other Americans over the gen-
erations. 
Sam also met his late wife, Trina, while in 
Guam. They were soon married, and together 
raised three children, Abraham, Keanu, and 
Rebekah, who are all now making their own 
way in the world. 
Shortly 
after 
leaving 
Guam, 
Sam 
transitioned to serving as counsel to Tribal 
governments, working in the states of Wash-
ington and Louisiana before moving to the 
Golden State. 
Sam’s first role in California was to serve as 
General Counsel to the Tule River Tribe in 
Porterville. His efforts there, shortly after Cali-
fornia voters authorized gaming for Native 
American tribes, were critical in setting the 
Tule River Tribe on a path to economic suc-
cess. 
In 2006 Sam moved to Santa Ynez in Santa 
Barbara County, to take a position as Legal 
Officer for the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash 
Indians. His impact was felt immediately, and 
he has been a trusted advisor for tribal lead-
ers and members ever since. 
I first got to know Sam during my time serv-
ing as a Supervisor in Santa Barbara County. 
Like many Tribal nations in California, the 
Chumash tribe had very little land over which 
to assert its sovereignty, provide a sense of 
community for its members, and grow as a na-
tion. Sam’s personal interactions with Super-
visors, staff and other stakeholders on fee to 
trust issues earned him a reputation as an 
honest broker which led to a number of suc-
cessful and important Tribal initiatives. 
My relationship with Sam and the Chumash 
Tribe deepened after I made the transition to 
Congress. Sam took time to educate my staff 
and I on the significance of the federal govern-
ment’s trust responsibilities to Tribes and im-
printed on me the importance of Congress ful-
filling its constitutional obligation to engage 
with Tribes on a government to government 
basis. Due in part to this education, I now am 
a proud member of the Native American Cau-
cus. 
Sam’s prolific efforts on behalf of the 
Chumash Tribe have not only been an asset 
to me as a Representative, but also to the en-
tire Central Coast region. Sam is tireless, and 
his expertise seems to touch upon virtually 
every topic. He serves as a member of the In-
ternal Revenue Service Advisory Committee 
and on a subcommittee of the Treasury Tribal 
Advisory Committee, providing recommenda-
tions to the IRS on ways that it can better im-
plement its laws and regulations to support 
Tribes, nonprofits, and all Americans. He is 
the President of the Santa Ynez Chamber of 
Commerce, President of the Econ Alliance for 
Northern Santa Barbara County, and serves 
on boards of the local community services dis-
trict for wastewater and the regional transpor-
tation agency. He is currently guiding the 
Tribe’s engagement with NOAA’s consider-
ation of a new Chumash Heritage National 
Marine Sanctuary, and just this month Sam 
was named to an advisory committee of the 
Federal Communication Commission. 
Most importantly, Sam is an absolute joy to 
be around. It is always a pleasure to run in to 
Sam and his partner, Trea, at community 
events throughout the district, and when they 
visit Trea’s daughter, Bria, here in Wash-
ington, DC. On this momentous occasion, I 
want to wish Sam a happy birthday and recog-
nize his exceptional work over the years and 
his many efforts to support the Santa Ynez 
Chumash Tribe and the citizens of California’s 
24th Congressional District.

HONORING GEOCONDA ARGU¨ ELLO- 
KLINE AS SHE RETIRES 
HON. STEVEN HORSFORD 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Geoconda Argu¨ello-Kline, as 
she retires from the Culinary Workers Union 
Local 226. Mrs. Argu¨ello-Kline leaves a posi-
tive impact on the lives of thousands of work-
ers in Nevada. 
Mrs. Argu¨ello-Kline’s story begins in Mana-
gua, Nicaragua, where she was born and 
raised. In 1979, Mrs. Argu¨ello-Kline was ad-
mitted to the United States as a political ref-
ugee. Since 1983, she calls Nevada her 
home. Picketing, negotiating, and asking for 
safe working conditions were some of the rea-
sons Mrs. Argu¨ello-Kline was relentless to give 
up the battle against the big corporations. As 
a guestroom attendant in 1989, Mrs. Argu¨ello- 
Kline stood outside of the Fitzgerald’s Hotel 
(now The D Hotel & Casino) picketing daily for 
6 months. That was only the beginning of 
many more similar scenarios to help workers 
stand up for their rights and benefits. 
In 1990, Mrs. Argu¨ello-Kline joined the Cul-
inary Workers Union Local 226. Mrs. Argu¨ello- 
Kline went from being an organizer in the 
1990s, then director of campaigns, trainer, and 
many other responsibilities, until becoming the 
union’s Secretary-Treasurer. Over the years, 
Mrs. Argu¨ello-Kline’s call to action remained 
the same and the voices only grew. An 
18,000-membership 
expanded 
to 
60,000 
members under her leadership. The casino in-
dustry, at that point, had to hear them out. 
The culinary workers were not alone. Bar-
tenders and housekeepers also demanded 
dignity in the workplace, medical benefits, re-
tirement security and more. 
One of the many successes Mrs. Argu¨ello- 
Kline led early on was the longest walkout in 
the history of the U.S. labor movement: the 
Frontier strike in 1991, where the Culinary 
Workers’ pension fund was in jeopardy. After 
more than six years of picketing, their pension 
fund was restored. 
Mrs. Argu¨ello-Kline has been a tremendous 
leader and a champion for workers in Nevada. 
We often saw her in the red t-shirt reminding 
folks of the power of each worker and the right 
to stand up for better working conditions. She 
retires after 32 years devoted to the Culinary 
Union and close to 40 years as a member. 
She is a hero in the labor community. I wish 
Geoconda Argu¨ello-Kline a great retirement. 
We honor her arduous work and contributions 
to the Silver State.

RECOGNIZING THE VARINA HIGH 
SCHOOL 
BLUE 
DEVILS 
STATE 
CHAMPIONSHIP FOOTBALL TEAM 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to celebrate the 
Varina Blue Devils football team for winning 
the Class 4 state championship title. 
This title run was particularly exciting, as it 
resulted in Varina High School’s first ever foot-
ball state championship. Their victory was 
made even more special by the fact that the 
last time the Blue Devils made the champion-
ship finals in 1999, their Head Coach Marcus 
Lewis was on the team. 
The Blue Devils’ win was not earned just on 
the day of the game but was built on months 
of hard work. After a season of close victories 
that toughened their resolve and showed their 
fighting spirit, these young men closed out the 
championship game in style. When a last- 
minute interception sealed the win for Varina, 
the Blue Devils earned their place in our Com-
monwealth’s history. I am certain that these 
young men and their championship achieve-
ment will be remembered in the Henrico com-
munity for years to come. 
On behalf of Virginia’s Fourth Congressional 
District, I would like to congratulate Principal 
Darin Thompson, Coach Marcus Lewis, and 
the Varina High School Blue Devils football 
team for their inspiring championship season.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF POINT OF VIEW 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize national talk radio program, Point 
of View, as they celebrate 50 years of media 
ministry committed to providing listeners with 
biblical clarity and truth. 
Since launching in 1972, under talk radio 
pioneer, Marlin Maddoux, Point of View has 
offered listeners authentic insight on a full 
spectrum of subject matter and current events 
affecting our nation’s families, constitutional 
freedoms, and faith. In recognition of his ef-
forts, Maddoux received the National Religious 
Broadcasters (NRB) Award of Merit and was

later inducted into the NRB Hall of Fame. In 
1994, Christian Today Magazine recognized 
the program as America’s most popular live 
Christian call-in show. 
Much of the longtime success of this pro-
gram can be attributed to current host, Kerby 
Anderson, whose impressive background in-
cludes serving as the President of Probe Min-
istries and as the author of more than 25 
books ranging from topics focused on media 
and technology, to economics and intelligent 
design. Cohost Penna Dexter shares the 
same devotion to God’s truth as she provides 
listeners with weekly commentary focused on 
Christian conservative politics and prominent 
cultural issues affecting the family. Throughout 
it all, the Point of View team has remained 
steadfast in their commitment to sharing the 
truth of God to restore a Christian worldview 
and provide biblical wisdom in today’s culture. 
For 50 years, Point of View has brought 
needed attention to prominent issues while 
serving as a source of wisdom rooted in God’s 
word. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to the 
Point of View team on this milestone anniver-
sary and ask my colleagues in the U.S. House 
of Representatives to join me in recognizing 
their devoted service to truth and keeping 
God’s word at the center of their message as 
they seek to enlighten the people of this Na-
tion.

HONORING TEXAS STATE 
SENATOR EDDIE LUCIO, JR. 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Texas State Senator Eddie Lucio, Jr., a 
man who has devoted his life to bringing dig-
nity and prosperity to the people of the Rio 
Grande Valley. 
Eduardo Andres ‘‘Eddie’’ Lucio, Jr. was born 
on January 20, 1946, in Brownsville, Texas. 
The second of ten children, Eddie grew up in 
the Bougainvillea neighborhood, where he 
learned the importance of hard work and a 
good education. He attended the University of 
Texas-Pan American in Edinburg, where he 
earned a Bachelor of Science in Education. 
Eddie served as an educator and coached 
football, basketball, and track and field in the 
Brownsville Independent School District before 
running for office in 1971. 
At the age of 25, Eddie became the young-
est person ever to be elected County Treas-
urer in the State of Texas. He also served as 
Cameron County Commissioner before his 
first election to the Texas House of Represent-
atives, where he represented the people of 
Brownsville from 1986 to 1990. He then suc-
cessfully ran to represent District 27 in the 
Texas Senate, a position he held continuously 
for 31 years until he announced his retirement 
in 2022. 
Eddie leads by example and believes that 
looking out for your neighbors, especially 
those who have fallen on hard times or are 
economically disadvantaged, is the heart of 
public service. He has assisted families who 
have lost their homes to fire with food, cloth-
ing, and rent, and he donates hundreds of 
Thanksgiving turkeys every year. After wit-
nessing the destruction of Hurricane Harvey, 
he purchased a food truck, which he operates 
with the help of friends and family to feed resi-
dents in remote locations when they are af-
fected by natural disasters or other events 
such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 
As a former educator, Eddie is a fierce advo-
cate for students and teachers and is well- 
known throughout South Texas for his work to 
help young scholars, awarding thousands of 
dollars in scholarships from funds raised by 
his annual golf tournaments over the past 30 
years. 
In the State Senate, Eddie authored bills to 
increase public school funding, expand bilin-
gual education, improve bus safety, ensure 
nutritious school lunches, and secure better 
pay for teachers. He also fought to improve 
access to higher education in the Rio Grande 
Valley. He was instrumental in the establish-
ment of the University of Texas Regional Aca-
demic Health Center and helped fast-track the 
creation of the University of Texas-Rio Grande 
Valley and its groundbreaking medical school, 
which are helping to train the next generation 
of doctors and medical professionals in a 
medically underserved area of the country. To 
honor his countless contributions to education 
in the community, Brownsville ISD named 
Lucio Middle School after him in 1997. 
Eddie has changed the landscape of South 
Texas. As Vice Chair of the Finance Com-
mittee, he worked to secure millions of dollars 
in state funding for infrastructure, which con-
tributed to the designation of the first interstate 
highways in the Rio Grande Valley and ad-
dressed water and wastewater needs for 
colonias. He also introduced legislation in sup-
port of bringing the World Birding Centers to 
the area and building an artificial reef off the 
coast of South Padre Island, boosting tourism 
and ecotourism in the area. Eddie was an 
early advocate for bringing SpaceX to the re-
gion, knowing it would eventually spur a boom 
of economic development. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me, Eddie’s wife, Minnie; his children, Eddie 
Lucio Ill and Lynda; and his grandchildren, 
Eddie ‘Luc’ Lucio IV and Olivia Rose, in thank-
ing him for five decades of selfless dedication 
to his community.

HONORING THE OUTSTANDING 
CAREER OF JANE BAIRD 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the distinguished career 
of Jane Baird, of Haddam, Connecticut. As the 
Senior Director of External Affairs, Jane cele-
brated a major milestone on January 14th, 
2022, when she officially reached 20 years of 
dedicated employment and leadership with 
Connecticut Children’s Medical Center. By co-
ordinating relationships between the CCMC 
and its partners, Jane has truly proved her de-
votion to the health and welfare of Connecti-
cut’s children, ensuring a bright and healthy 
future for countless youth throughout the state. 
Before the outset of her career with Con-
necticut Children’s Medical Center, Jane 
began with her studies at Grinnell College, 
graduating in 1988 with a bachelor’s degree in 
biology. Upon graduating, Jane went on to 
study at Indiana University, graduating with a 
master’s in public administration in 1993. 
Equipped with this robust education, Jane ini-
tially moved to and worked in Vermont as the 
Managed Care Administrator of the Office of 
Vermont Health Access for over 4 years. Jane 
then moved to the Vermont Division of Health 
Care Administration to be the Director of Qual-
ity Assurance and Consumer Protection, keep-
ing to her tireless life-mission of ensuring 
those around her receive proper medical care. 
In 2002, the Second District of Connecticut 
was lucky when Jane and her family discov-
ered the area for their new home. Upon mov-
ing to the small town of Haddam, Jane 
launched her impactful career with CCMC as 
the Director of Government Relations. In this 
role, Jane was responsible for the mainte-
nance of legislative relationships on behalf of 
the medical center, acting as a conduit be-
tween the medical staff at CCMC and the 
world of public policy. Jane approached this 
role with great passion, leading advocacy ef-
forts with a wide variety of partners to promote 
healthcare policies that advance the growth 
and health of families and their children. 
Throughout her tenure, Jane has been an ex-
traordinary force in the realm of Medicaid, in-
jury prevention, and national health reform. 
Without Jane’s leadership, I am sure that 
CCMC would not have had such an influential 
impact on the well-being of children in Con-
necticut and across the country. 
In recognition of her hard-earned suc-
cesses, Jane was promoted in 2016 to her 
current title of Senior Director of External Re-
lations. Under this expanded leadership posi-
tion, Jane has been instilled with a deeper 
connection to the promotion of healthy families 
and communities, taking up even greater, 
more creative efforts of advocacy. In doing so, 
she has successfully and dutifully managed 
communications with the medical center’s 
many 
affiliates, 
including 
Hartford 
Public 
Schools and local YMCAs. 
Since 2004, Jane has also been an active 
member of the Board of Directors at Southside 
Institutions Neighborhood Alliance in Hartford. 
A medium of cooperation between CCMC, 
Hartford Hospital, and Trinity College, the Alli-
ance continues to serve a devoted mission to-
ward improving the lives of people in South 
Central Hartford. In 2011, Jane was appointed 
Chairwoman to the Alliance as a result of her 
commitment to and advancement of the orga-
nization’s core mission. 
Madam Speaker, Jane’s advocacy for chil-
dren—characterized by understanding, pa-
tience, and perseverance—is a practice that I 
am grateful to represent in Connecticut’s Sec-
ond District. Throughout her 20 years of advo-
cacy with Connecticut Children’s Medical Cen-
ter, and the years of work before that in 
Vermont, Jane has displayed how providing 
care to others involves more than what we 
often think of. Even after 20–plus years in the 
field, Jane’s devotion to the children is as tire-
less as ever, a mark of true devotion for help-
ing others in the world. For her unparalleled 
altruistic nature, I ask my colleagues in the 
House to join me in honoring Jane Baird, an 
unrelenting advocate and inspiring leader, set-
ting her name, character and continued work 
further into stone.

IN RECOGNITION OF SERGEANT 
PAUL EDWARD THORNTON 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the exemplary work of Ser-
geant Paul Thornton as he retires from a life 
of public service. He has served the citizens of 
the State of Texas, in the communities of 
Houston, Huntsville, and The Colony as a po-
lice officer for over 34 years. 
Sergeant Thornton began his law enforce-
ment career in 1988 when he was hired as a 
police officer with the University of Houston 
Central Campus Police Department. He at-
tended the Harris County Sheriff’s Office 
Academy. Between 1988 and 1992, Sergeant 
Thornton also worked as a police officer with 
the Sam Houston State University Police De-
partment and the Walker County Sheriffs Of-
fice. During this time he also earned a Bach-
elor’s of Science degree in Criminal Justice 
from Sam Houston State University. 
On September 2, 1992, Sergeant Thornton 
was hired by The Colony Police Department. 
Just a year later, he was named The Colony 
PD’s ‘‘Officer of The Year’’. In 1995, he be-
came The Colony PD’s first and only K9 Offi-
cer. He and his K9 colleague, Major, a nar-
cotic detection dog, worked the streets several 
years combating illegal narcotics. 
In 1998, he was promoted to the rank of 
Sergeant. After his promotion, he served as 
both a Night Shift and Day Shift Patrol Ser-
geant. As a Patrol Sergeant, he has been in 
charge of the Crossing Guards, Bike Patrol 
Unit, Traffic Enforcement Division and the de-
partments off-duty employment program. He 
has also served as the department’s Criminal 
Investigations Supervisor and the Internal Af-
fairs Sergeant. 
In 1999, be met the love of his life and wife, 
Karen Thornton. Karen is a United States Air 
Force Veteran and holds a Master’s Degree 
from the University of Texas–Austin. Sergeant 
Thornton and his wife have three children, 
Alex, Samantha, and Tyler; and two grand-
children, Clayden and Reagan Thornton. 
Sergeant Thornton has devoted over 34 
years faithfully serving and protecting his com-
munity. For more than three decades, he has 
put strangers’ safety above his own, and we 
are indebted to him. I am deeply grateful for 
his service to our community and state, and I 
wish Sergeant Thornton and his family the 
best in his retirement.

REMEMBERING DOROTHY F. 
MASTERNICK 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Dorothy F. Masternick, who 
passed away on Tuesday, February 1, 2022, 
at the age of 96. She was a pillar of our com-
munity, a servant of others, and an example of 
how our lives and talents are meant to be 
shared. 
Dorothy was born November 3, 1925, in 
Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, the daughter of 
William J. and Annabelle (Onspaugh) Fritz. 
Dorothy graduated from Beaver Falls High 
School and Jameson Memorial School of 
Nursing in New Castle, Pennsylvania. 
She worked in a wartime factory as a bomb 
inspector during WWII while attending nursing 
school. While working as a registered nurse at 
North Side Hospital she attended Youngstown 
State University where she met her future hus-
band, John Masternick. They married on June 
25, 1949, and together they co-owned, devel-
oped, and operated Windsor House Nursing 
Homes. 
Dorothy was a member of St. Rose Catholic 
Church and was very active in the catholic 
community. She served as President of the 
Youngstown Diocesan Council of Catholic 
Women, Bishops Advisory Board, Retired 
Priests Commission, Ohio Catholic Con-
ference, was an advocate of catholic school 
education, and organized a monthly rosary 
group. She was especially active in the 
Cursillo movement which shaped her commit-
ment to care for the elderly in our community 
with compassion and dignity. Along with her 
husband, they established the John and Doro-
thy Masternick Foundation which provides 
funding to catholic education and scholarships 
for local high school graduates and nursing 
students, as well as establishing the nursing 
simulation laboratory at Youngstown State 
University. 
Dorothy was a natural caregiver and had 
strong faith. She loved to host Sunday dinner, 
bridge club and loved to read and paint. After 
retiring she enjoyed spending time in Florida 
but her favorite thing to do was to spoil her 
grandchildren, especially at Christmas. 
She leaves to cherish her memory, her chil-
dren: two sons, Jeffrey (Terri) Masternick, and 
Atty. John J. (Melissa) Masternick and two 
daughters, Maria Masternick and Theresa 
(Leo) Grimes; grandchildren, John Colby 
Grimes, Daniel (Stacy) Grimes, Ken Grimes, 
John 
Michael 
Masternick, 
Christopher 
Masternick, Alyssa Masternick, Kevin (Erica) 
Pangio, and Amy Pangio; great-grandson, 
Dean Grimes; nephew, Greg (Cheryl) Hardy; 
great-niece, 
Jennifer, 
and 
great-nephew, 
Jason. She is preceded in death by her par-
ents; her husband; her sister, Mildred Hardy, 
and her brother, Donald W. Fritz.

RECOGNIZING LANE CHANGE 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the outstanding work of a 
local nonprofit in my district for their commit-
ment to ending substance abuse. 
Lane Change was established by Lauren 
and Cory Mitchell, along with Brad and Stacy 
Segebarth, after local resident Lane Austin 
died from a fatal overdose while waiting for an 
available inpatient drug treatment facility. With-
in less than three short years, Lane Change 
has transformed many lives through edu-
cation, outreach, and prevention in the Leb-
anon Community. Most importantly, their orga-
nization has helped families receive coun-
seling and inpatient treatment for substance 
abuse through local and regional partnerships. 
Their network has become a vital resource for 
patients and probationary drug offenders, 
something that did not exist when Lane Austin 
lost his life over three years ago. 
Founder and executive director, Lauren 
Mitchell, is continually expanding her vision for 
Lane Change as she recognizes more unmet 
needs in her community. Her organization 
does not simply want to treat the symptoms of 
substance abuse but address the fundamental 
problems that drive it. Like many programs, 
their leadership understands that substance 
abuse is frequently linked with mental ill-
nesses or social trauma in childhood and ado-
lescence, making early intervention crucial to 
prevention. Lane Change has already out-
grown their current facility as they have ex-
panded their program to include a safe place 
for local students to spend time away from 
troubled home environments. 
None of this would have been possible with-
out the generosity of donors and community 
volunteers. I am proud of each one and for 
Lauren Mitchell whose vision and commitment 
made this nonprofit possible. She has already 
made a tremendous impact. In the coming 
years, I look forward to watching Lane Change 
continue to grow and transform lives in south-
west Missouri.

HONORING BLACK HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. LUCY McBATH 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Dr. Marjorie Roberts of Johns 
Creek, Georgia. As we continue our celebra-
tion of Black History Month, we recognize 
Black men and women from throughout the 
past and present who have made an indelible 
mark on the story of our nation. I am proud to 
say that Dr. Roberts is a woman who is doing 
just that: making her own mark on history by 
sharing her story and her smile through advo-
cacy on behalf of COVID–19 survivors nation-
wide. 
Dr. Marjorie Roberts grew up the youngest 
member of her family. In 1980, she gave birth 
to her daughter, whom she calls her best 
friend. She is a mother, a wife, and a veteran 
of the United States Army. She attended 
Capella University and obtained her Doctorate 
of Business Administration with a Specializa-
tion in Strategy and Innovation in 2014. In 
2019, she earned her Life Coaching Certifi-
cation. She works with clients to achieve 
progress, reach milestones, and transform 
their lives. 
In March of 2020, Dr. Roberts tested posi-
tive for COVID–19. By grace, she survived her 
initial case of COVID, which included a stay in 
the hospital. But she is one of the millions of 
COVID survivors who are considered ‘‘long 
haulers,’’ patients who continue to battle 
symptoms of the virus for weeks and months 
after their initial illness. Since then, she has 
faced health issues that have prevented her 
from living her life in the same way she did 
prior to getting COVID–19. In addition to her 
own challenges, Dr. Roberts also lost a dear 
friend to COVID–19, Sergeant Gary Mitchell, 
with whom she served in the Army. 
As a COVID–19 survivor and long hauler, 
Dr. Roberts has made it her life’s mission to

help fellow survivors face the challenges that 
follow in the wake of a COVID diagnosis. She 
works with the organization COVID Survivors 
for Change to support fellow survivors, re-
member those who have died, and advocate 
for strong public health measures to prevent 
future pandemics. In the face of her ongoing 
struggle and through the pain of losing a loved 
one, Dr. Roberts continues to advocate on be-
half of others through her work with COVID 
Survivors for Change. Despite her grief and 
pain, Dr. Roberts says that she always has 
something to smile about. Her resolve and her 
passion are evident in her words and deeds, 
and I am so proud of the work that she is 
doing. 
As we celebrate Black History Month, may 
we be reminded of Black men and women’s 
enormous contributions to the United States 
each and every day. It is a true honor to rep-
resent Dr. Roberts in Congress and recognize 
her today for the work she has done to help 
others even at a time when her own life has 
been significantly impacted by COVID–19. I 
am proud to call Dr. Roberts a constituent, 
and grateful for the opportunity to uplift her 
during this year’s celebration of Black History 
Month.

HONORING NASHUA FIRE CHIEF 
BRIAN RHODES 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of the outstanding career in pub-
lic service of Nashua Fire Chief Brian Rhodes. 
It is with great pride that I join others in hon-
oring Brian’s commitment to the City of Nash-
ua. 
Brian’s career with the Nashua Fire Depart-
ment was marked with many milestones and 
achievements. He has attended the National 
Fire Academy and successfully graduated 
from both the Fire Service Financial Manage-
ment and Executive Planning programs. Brian 
started his career with the Nashua Fire De-
partment in 1987. He was promoted to Lieu-
tenant in 2000, Captain in 2004, Deputy Chief 
in 2011, Assistant Chief in June of 2015 and 
took over as Chief in April of 2018. In 2018, 
Chief Rhodes joined me in Washington, D.C. 
to share his work combating the opioid epi-
demic with Members of Congress. I appreciate 
Chief Rhodes unwavering commitment to 
serving his community and sharing his exper-
tise with leaders from across the country. 
I commend Chief Rhodes on his retirement 
after more than three decades with the Nash-
ua Fire Department and on his unwavering 
dedication to the Granite State. Chief Rhodes 
also served as a State Representative from 
2008 to 2014 representing Nashua Ward 3 in 
the New Hampshire General Court—a testa-
ment to his dedication to making the Granite 
State a better place. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s Second Congressional District, I thank 
Brian for his many years of service, and for 
being a part of what makes the Granite State 
so great. I am honored to recognize and con-
gratulate Brian on his retirement and wish him 
the best of luck in the years ahead. 
IN RECOGNITION OF VFW POST– 
8896 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, l rise today to recognize VFW Post–8896 
located in East Berlin, Pennsylvania on their 
seventy-five years of operation. Post 8896 is 
named in honor of Richard J. Gross, a native 
of Pennsylvania and. a member of the United 
States Army-Airforce who gave his life on 
September 8, 1943, while flying a combat mis-
sion over New Guinea while serving as a radio 
operator and gunner on a B–24 Liberator 
Bomber. 
In 1947, a group of veterans carried on the 
legacy and memory of Richard J. Gross and 
opened Post–8896. 
For more than seven decades, the Post’s 
members have remained dedicated to helping 
veterans and their families, building commu-
nity fellowship, and promoting awareness for 
the sacrifices that our veterans have made. 
On behalf of the people of the 13th Con-
gressional District, it is my great honor to con-
gratulate the Richard J. Gross VFW on sev-
enty-five years of service to veterans of 
Adams County. I thank them for their great

HONORING EDWARD ‘‘ED’’ A. 
TORIELLO 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor, Edward ‘‘Ed’’ A. Toriello, 
a World War II veteran, as he celebrates his 
100th birthday today. 
Sergeant First Class (SFC) Ed Toriello 
proudly served his country in Patton’s 3rd 
Army during World War II. In 1944, he was a 
recent graduate from St. John’s University’s 
Divinity School looking to enter the priesthood 
when a week later, he answered the call to 
serve his country. Following six months of 
training he was sent to the European Theatre 
where he first served as a combat medic, then 
a scout in the 76th infantry regiment. Ed was 
supposed to remain in the country and go to 
Officer Candidate School, but at the height of 
the war, the Army needed more enlisted men, 
and he was immediately deployed overseas. 
During the frigid winter of 1944–45, he and his 
unit were sent to help stop the last German of-
fensive of the war at the Battle of the Bulge. 
The 76th infantry regiment was then tasked 
with securing the Remagen Bridge in March of 
1945, a crucial action that allowed the Allies to 
enter Germany. This single event’s success is 
credited with shortening the war. 
Throughout his service, Ed exemplified 
bravery and resilience as his unit suffered 
heavy losses. Edward is a decorated soldier, 
earning numerous commendations including 3 
Service Stars, the Combat Medic Badge, and 
the Combat Infantry Rifle Badge. After Ger-
many’s surrender, he was assigned to the 
U.S. sector in Southern Germany where he 
was offered to then attend Officer Candidate 
School as he had originally intended. Instead, 
he decided to return to civilian life and as he 
describes it, ‘‘the rest was history’’. 
Ed Toriello returned to Brooklyn where he 
met his wife to be, Zina Toriello nee Caruba, 
and together they went on to have six chil-
dren. They ultimately moved to Southern 
Ocean County in 1977 where he quickly be-
came a beacon of positivity within the commu-
nity. He remained active as a community vol-
unteer and leader in numerous organizations 
such as Kiwanis International, Italian American 
Social and Civic Association, and the Knights 
of Columbus. Ed also served as a trustee for 
three decades with South Ocean’s Medical 
Center and started a beloved local fundraising 
concert for the facility that has raised over 
$100,000 to date. Today, Ed enjoys watching 
the Yankees and cooking for his friends and 
family. 
Edward A. Toriello is a distinguished mem-
ber of our community whose heroic actions 
during the Second World War set the trajec-
tory for a life of servitude that has positively 
impacted those around him and will continue

HONORING KAREN FERGUSON OF 
THE PENSION RIGHTS CENTER 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
offer my condolences to the family and friends 
of Karen Ferguson, the President of the Pen-
sion Rights Center, and recognize her as a 
true champion for the rights of pensioners. 
Karen was a leader on an issue that is of par-
ticular importance to me; namely, the retire-
ment security of workers, retirees, and their 
families. For over 45 years, Karen was signifi-
cantly involved in protecting pensioners rights 
through the development of pension legislation 
in Congress, and recently I witnessed her tire-
less advocacy first-hand as we worked to 
enact the Butch Lewis Act. 
An alum of Harvard Law School and Bryn 
Mawr College, Karen founded the Pension 
Rights Center. The Pension Rights Center, 
with Karen as president and leader, has been 
instrumental in advocating for and drafting 
new regulations and laws, including the Retire-
ment Equity Act of 1984, the Tax Reform Act 
of 1986 and the Butch Lewis Act of 2021. 
Karen was widely known and respected on 
Capitol Hill and testified at many congres-
sional and regulatory hearings. She will be re-
membered for her passion and depth of 
knowledge. 
I join the millions of pensioners around the 
country in expressing gratitude for Karen’s te-
nacity. She will be deeply missed. I send my 
deepest sympathies to all who loved her, the 
Ferguson family, her friends, and her col-
leagues.

HONORING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
SOUTH CAROLINA FIREFIGHTER 
HOBART ERICKSON 
HON. JEFF DUNCAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the service of Mr. Hobart ‘‘Hobie’’ 
Erickson of Donalds, South Carolina, who has 
served as a first responder firefighter for over 
sixty-five years. 
Mr. Erickson began his career as a fire-
fighter in 1965 in New Jersey where he served 
for thirty years, rising to the position of Chief. 
In 1995, Mr. Erickson and his wife retired to 
Donalds, South Carolina. After being encour-
aged by his wife, Lois, Mr. Erickson left retire-
ment to serve the Donalds Fire Department 
where he has since spent 351⁄2 years in con-
tinued service. 
In January of 2022, Mr. Erickson turned 95 
years old. According to the South Carolina 
Firefighters Association, Mr. Erickson is the 
oldest of 17,000 actively serving firefighters in 
the state. Although he is no longer able to 
fight fires, Mr. Erickson is a vital member of 
the department where he tends to the fire 
trucks and answers calls for medical assist-
ance. He attributes his health and energy to 
the protection of Jesus Christ and his loving 
wife. The younger firefighters in Donalds look 
up to Mr. Erickson, and he even exercises 
with them several hours a week. Younger fire-
fighters gather around Mr. Erickson to hear his 
stories and his advice on how to treat others 
and how to be a successful leader. 
Mr. Erickson’s selfless leadership has made 
not only the Third District of South Carolina 
proud, but the entire state of South Carolina. 
His tireless commitment to keep his commu-
nity safe and healthy for over a half of a cen-
tury is something we should all aspire to have. 
Throughout his career, he has exemplified 
what it means to be a true servant leader. I 
am confident in the future of first responders 
in my district because of the example Mr. 
Erickson has set. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be able 
to serve the Third District of South Carolina 
and to honor those who have dedicated their 
life to service, like Mr. Erickson. I wish Mr. 
Erickson and his family many more years of 
health and happiness.

HONORING JOE HOSHAW, JR. 
EDITOR OF THE TRENTON TRIB 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Joe Hoshaw, Jr. on the oc-
casion of his retirement from the Trenton Trib, 
where he has served as Editor and Co-Found-
er for over twelve years. His significant con-
tributions and service to our community are 
worthy of commendation. 
Mr. Hoshaw received his Bachelor of Arts in 
journalism from Wayne State University and 
specializes in publication writing and editing. 
He founded the Trenton Trib in 2009 in re-
sponse to community concerns about the lack 
of a hometown newspaper. Prior to his work at 
the Trenton Trib, he worked at The News-Her-
ald Newspapers as assistant managing editor 
and founded HPR Media & Promotional Serv-
ices LLC, where he still works today. 
Mr. Hoshaw has continued to provide posi-
tive, interesting and uplifting articles on behalf 
of his community, demonstrating the impor-
tance of neighborhood news. Under his lead-
ership, the Trenton Trib has become a multi-
faceted news organization and has delivered 
impactful information to the citizens of Tren-
ton. From the latest in high school sports to 
breaking development news to highlighting 
local businesses, the Trib could always be 
counted on to write about the things that our 
neighbors cared about. Along with co-pub-
lisher Kathy Kane, they brought news to the 
people of Downriver. The Trenton Trib ceased 
publication at the end of 2021, but their impact 
on the community will last for years to come. 
Mr. Hoshaw is a past president and 11-year 
member of the Rotary Club of Trenton, Michi-
gan. He is also a member of the board of di-
rectors for the Southern Wayne County Re-
gional Chamber and the Trenton Business As-
sociation. Mr. Hoshaw is known for his atten-
tion to detail and tireless enthusiasm for his 
community. He continues to reside in south-
eastern Michigan with his wife Mary, a retired 
teacher who taught at Lincoln Park Public 
Schools for nearly thirty years. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Joe Hoshaw, Jr. We are grate-
ful for his years spent at the Trenton Trib, for 
his over four decades of dedication to the jour-
nalism in southeastern Michigan. I join with 
Joe’s family, friends, and colleagues in ex-
tending my best wishes to him in retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS 
AND DEDICATION OF MS. LYNNE 
TELFORD 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the achievements and 
dedication of Ms. Lynne Telford, the CEO of 
Care and Share Food Bank for Southern Colo-
rado. Ms. Telford is retiring after 11 years of 
faithful service to those in need in the Pikes 
Peak Region. 
Since taking the reins at Care and Share 
Food Bank, Lynne has demonstrated steadfast 
leadership, not only within the Care and Share 
organization but across the non-profit industry 
in Colorado Springs. 
Shortly after her start with Care and Share, 
Lynne identified the need for resiliency in op-
erations. She helped to build a disaster re-
sponse system during the Waldo Canyon Fire 
(2012), the Black Forest Fire (2013), and more 
recently, the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Thinking outside the box, Lynne helped de-
velop a successful Direct Services branch, in-
cluding Sunny Side Markets and Mobile Mar-
kets. Her goal was to reach those unable to 
be served by traditional food bank methods. 
Additionally, Lynne established an endow-
ment fund under the Care and Share Founda-
tion to spin-off operating funds each year. 
Care and Share Food Bank is currently 
opening up a third distribution center in the 
San Luis Valley of Southern Colorado. This 
unprecedented addition will increase trucking 
and shipping efficiencies, getting food to those 
in need faster. 
During her time as CEO, Care and Share 
more than doubled the amount of food distrib-
uted, totaling 25 million lbs. in 2021. Incred-
ibly, revenue generation under Lynne’s leader-
ship has grown exponentially. In 2021, more 
than 17,000 people made a gift in support of 
Care and Share. 
But her leadership and service to her com-
munity doesn’t end there. Lynne has served 
on the Board of Directors for Leadership Pikes 
Peak (2003–2006), the Pikes Peak Library 
District (2004–2016), the Colorado Springs 
Chamber & EDC Board (2014–2019). In addi-
tion, she currently serves on the Colorado 
Food Advisory Council, the Colorado Springs 
City for Champions Committee, and was ap-
pointed to the Colorado State Board of Human 
Services in 2019 by Governor Polis. 
Lynne’s value to our community is undeni-
able. So much so that in 2020, Lynne was the 
recipient of the coveted United Way S. Jerrard 
‘‘Jerry’’ Smith Community Service Award, an 
award presented annually to an individual 
whose involvement in public policy and civic 
issues led to the growth and betterment of the 
Pikes Peak region. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House of Representatives join me in 
honoring Lynne Telford and her legacy of 
kindness, creative thinking, and hard work that 
will transcend generations to come. Lynne’s 
service to her community has provided many 
homes in Colorado’s 5th Congressional Dis-
trict with a warm, dignified meal. I congratulate 
and thank Lynne for her many accomplish-
ments and wish her the very best in her next 
adventure.

HONORING WALLACE JAY NELSON, 
JR. 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
commemorate the life of my longtime dear 
friend Wallace Jay ‘‘Wally’’ Nelson, Jr. of 
Blacksburg, Virginia, who passed away on 
January 28, 2022. 
Wally was a native Virginian and a graduate 
of Emory & Henry College, where he and I 
were roommates. While there he studied eco-
nomics and went on to receive his master’s 
degree in business from the University of Vir-
ginia. 
Wally started his professional career at Bur-
lington Industries. He worked hard and gave 
his all, earning the spot as the youngest-ever 
plant supervisor. His time there helped pave 
the way for the rest of his career in the com-
mercial insurance industry, where he worked 
for more than three decades. He most recently 
served as the Vice President of SIA Group. 
His life was evidence of his commitment to 
the improvement of the communities in south-
west Virginia. He cared deeply for all people 
and was greatly involved in public service. 
Over the years, he was an active Republican 
that aided in fundraising efforts for numerous 
political candidates. He also served with the 
Blacksburg Partnership, Junior Achievement,

and the Roanoke Valley Regional Chamber of 
Commerce, where he served as president of 
the group’s recruitment division. He also 
served as a co-chair for the New River Valley 
Rail 2020 to lead the effort to expand the pas-
senger rail service. 
Wally lived to serve and care for others. He 
prospered in any situation that allowed him to 
unite and care for others—he never met a 
stranger. But most of all, he adored his family. 
His humble giving heart, hard-working nature, 
and steadfast faith are just some of the most 
notable characteristics that defined the kind of 
man Wally was. 
Wally was proceeded in death by his loving 
parents, Wallace and Helen Nelson. He is sur-
vived by his cherished wife Heather; children 
Crandall Murphy and husband Shannon, Wal-
lace Jay Nelson III and wife Tory, Krystine 
Hammerle and husband Ryan, Katherine Nel-
son and Ben Stovall; grandchildren Jackson 
and Paige Nelson, as well as many other be-
loved extended family and friends. 
A man whose legacy and love for family, 
neighbors, and community will long be remem-
bered. Wally was a dear friend that will be 
greatly missed. I am honored to pay tribute to 
Wally’s life. My thoughts and prayers go out to 
his family and loved ones.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY 
OF 
MRS. 
WILLIE 
LEE 
MOSES 
HON. MARK TAKANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 100th birthday of Mrs. Willie 
Lee Moses, a constituent of mine and a 
woman known to her community as the 
‘‘Mayor of Good Hope.’’ The dedication that 
Mrs. Moses has to her community has made 
a profound difference in the Inland Empire, 
and it is my honor to recognize her work. 
The impact of Mrs. Moses’ work is difficult 
to overstate. Born in northern Louisiana, Mrs. 
Moses and her husband settled in Perris in 
1957 and immediately became active mem-
bers of their community. Besides being a 
mother of five and an employee of Perris 
School District for over two decades, Mrs. 
Moses was also elected as the president of 
multiple Parent Teacher Associations at var-
ious schools and served in union leadership 
as a job steward for fellow school district em-
ployees. An avid organizer, Mrs. Moses ran 
voter registration drives, worked on political 
campaigns, and was a leader in the area’s 
first Human Relations Commission, which 
worked to facilitate dialogue on race relations 
among the community of Perris Valley. The 
Moses Schaffer Community Center now bears 
her name, recognizing the tireless work she 
did in support of the construction of critical in-
frastructure that enabled her city to thrive. 
Mrs. Moses’ generosity is well-known in the 
City of Perris. For 35 years, Mrs. Moses co-
ordinated a free food program to ensure that 
low-income seniors always had resources to 
turn to. Over the decades, her family room 
has served as a gathering place for friends 
and neighbors, including the many years that 
she hosted meals for those stationed at the 
March Air Reserve Base with nowhere to go 
for the holidays. Her tireless work emulates 
her trailblazing spirit—she was often the first 
African American in the leadership positions 
she took on, and her commitment to civil 
rights and civic duty has forever changed the 
Inland Empire community for the better. 
Mrs. Moses has done more for her commu-
nity in her 100 years than many could achieve 
in several lifetimes. It is with gratitude that I 
wish her a very happy birthday and thank her 
for her leadership and vision. Her example 
has set a high bar for all of us in public serv-
ice, and I am honored to have her in our com-
munity.

HONORING 
PETER 
STEC 
FOR 
ACHIEVING SCOUTING’S HIGHEST 
AND MOST PRESTIGIOUS RANK, 
EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Peter Stec for his exceptional 
community service that has earned him the 
rank of Eagle Scout. 
Peter has been involved with the Scouts for 
many years and, through perseverance and 
hard work, has become the Senior Patrol 
Leader of Boy Scouts of America Troop 6016 
in Queensbury, New York. Peter has dedi-
cated his time in the Scouts to the well-being 
of the community of Queensbury, culminating 
in his Eagle Scout community service project. 
For his Eagle Scout project, Peter created a 
COVID–19 memorial garden recognizing War-
ren County residents who passed away during 
the pandemic. Peter built benches and planted 
trees and shrubs along the Warren County 
bike path in Queensbury. The COVID–19 me-
morial garden creates a space for Warren 
County residents to sit and reflect on those 
they have loved and lost. Peter’s project ex-
emplifies his deep commitment to improving 
his community. 
Peter’s dedication to his community is evi-
dent not only in his Eagle Scout achievement, 
but also in his engagement in music, arts, and 
school. Peter is an exemplary student who is 
also an accomplished musician in his school’s 
jazz band and has had his artwork displayed 
in the Saratoga National Racing Museum. 
Rising through the ranks to Eagle Scout re-
quires dedication and perseverance, and Peter 
stands as an exemplar of that fact. His work 
is a strong indication of his exceptional leader-
ship skills and commitment to service. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I would like to thank Peter for his con-
tributions to the community and congratulate 
him on achieving the rank of Eagle Scout. It 
is so important, now more than ever, that our 
youth learn the values of service to the com-
munity and nation. I am excited to see where 
Peter’s bright future takes him.

IN RECOGNITION OF HOPE CAHILL 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor Ms. Hope Cahill of El Do-
rado Community School in Santa Fe for her 
incredible commitment to New Mexico’s chil-
dren, schools, and community. 
The National Science Foundation (NSF) re-
cently awarded Ms. Cahill the Presidential 
Award for Excellence in Mathematics and 
Science Teaching (PAEMST). The award pro-
gram is administered by NSF on behalf of the 
White House Office of Science and Tech-
nology Policy to recognize the invaluable con-
tributions of exceptional K–12 science, tech-
nology, engineering, mathematics, and com-
puter science teachers. It is the highest honor 
our nation can bestow to a math or science 
teacher. 
Ms. Cahill, a 25-year resident of New Mex-
ico, serves as an inspiration to not only her 
students but to her entire community with her 
dedication to the next generation of our na-
tion’s future leaders. She has received numer-
ous other awards including theTeachers Who 
Inspire Award from the Santa Fe Partners in 
Education Foundation. She is also well known 
for her ability to incorporate writing and com-
munication skills into her curriculum and for 
her work to inspire girls to pursue STEM edu-
cation. 
Describing teaching as a calling, not a pro-
fession, Ms. Cahill says that she wanted to be 
a teacher since she was a child and loves the 
way that science has the ability to engage her 
students. She of course incorporates New 
Mexico’s incredible landscapes and geology 
into her lessons to excite students about both 
the beauty of science and the land of enchant-
ment. Selflessly, Ms. Cahill extends credit and 
thanks to her colleagues, administrators, and 
family and professes that her greatest accom-
plishments are the students that she has 
‘‘hooked’’ into science. 
Ms. Cahill is a shining example of the pas-
sion and dedication that define our great state, 
and we are proud that she calls New Mexico 
home. I offer my congratulations to Ms. Mi-
randa and thank her from the bottom of my 
heart for her contributions to the future of New 
Mexico—our youth.

ACKNOWLEDGING THE MOUNT 
LAUREL CUB SCOUT PACK 15 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 18, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to acknowledge the hard work and 
dedication shown by the Mount Laurel Cub 
Scout Pack 15. 
During 
the 
holiday 
season, 
Pack

partnered with BookSmiles, a 501(c)(3) organi-
zation that collects and distributes books 
throughout New Jersey and the Greater Phila-
delphia area and have been serving our com-
munities since September 2017. As a result of 
their efforts, Pack 15 collected more than 
7,000 books—the largest single day book col-
lection in BookSmiles’s history. 
I commend every member of Cub Scout 
Pack 15, their leaders Jeffrey A. Shaman and 
Daniel Pelaez, and the entire team at 
BookSmiles for accomplishing something that 
will benefit children, students, teachers, and 
parents throughout our community.
