PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, we find ourselves at the 
end of this Memorial Day weekend hav-
ing honored the heroes of our country. 
We lift our hearts in gratitude for 
those who chose to give their lives in 
the fight for right and freedom, the 
honor of this country, and the preser-
vation of its noble ideals. 
We pray for those families, friends, 
and communities who sent their loved 
ones off to war and who now touch a 
gravestone just to sustain the memory 
of their sacrifice. 
But as the first funerals are held 
today following the tragedy in Texas, 
we also grieve the innocents who didn’t 
live long enough to have a choice as to 
how they would give their lives. 
Lord God our Father, we raise our 
voices of grief and mourning in mem-
ory of the ones who were lost on 
Uvalde’s battlefield, the 19 children and 
their two teachers. We cry with the 
families who sent their children off to 
school but who now drape themselves 
over tiny caskets, yearning just to hold 
them one last time. 
Our country’s eyes are dim with 
grief, and we call out to You, spreading 
before You our deepest sadness. Our 
Nation’s prayers are offered before You 
in the hope that You would turn Your 
ear to our cries for those whom we 
have loved and lost. 
O Lord, You are the God who saves. 
Show Your compassion to us in these 
moments. Declare Your love to us in 
the midst of our grief. 
In Your sovereign name we pray 
Your favor. 
Amen.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
SUPERIOR 
TOWNSHIP 
TREAS-
URER BRENDA MCKINNEY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ms. Brenda McKinney on 
the occasion of her retirement from Superior 
Township, Michigan, where she has served as 
Treasurer for over 25 years. Her significant 
contributions to our community are worthy of 
commendation. 
Ms. McKinney has a long history of service 
to Washtenaw County, Michigan. In 1996, she 
retired from the Washtenaw County Treas-
urer’s Office after 15 years of service. She de-
cided to bring her wealth of knowledge back 
home and run for Treasurer of Superior Town-
ship in August of 1996. Ms. McKinney was 
successful. She made history as the town-
ship’s first elected African-American treasurer 
and has been reelected every 4 years since. 
Responsible for managing the Township’s 
funds and investments, she has modernized 
and improved the Township’s tax collection 
and cash management systems. Her efforts to 
improve the functioning of the Treasurer’s of-
fice will benefit the Township and its residents 
for years to come. 
For the past 26 years, Ms. McKinney has 
been a crucial leader in Superior Township 
and has always been willing to step up to the 
plate. Recently, she worked with local leaders 
in ministry to ensure that all members of the 
community have access to the vaccinations 
they need to be healthy. When people are 
hungry, she makes sure they are fed and con-
nects those in need to affordable housing and 
health care services. Active in charitable 
causes and serving on several humanitarian 
boards, she is a mentor to her fellow public 
servants and a friend to many. Everything she 
does is in service of her fellow neighbors, and 
the passion she has for her community is evi-
dent in her work. Ms. McKinney continues to 
reside in Superior Township with her family. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Treasurer Brenda McKinney. 
We are grateful for her nearly 40 years spent 
serving the citizens of Superior Township and 
Washtenaw County. Her wisdom, experience, 
and caring heart has guided me in my own 
public service, and I am blessed to call her my 
friend. I join with Brenda’s family, friends, and 
colleagues in extending my best wishes to her 
in retirement. 
HONORING THE PATRIOTIC 
SERVICE OF CHOC CHRISTOPHER 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and commemorate the lengthy public 
service career of Choc Christopher. 
For the last eighteen years, Choc has faith-
fully served the students, teachers, and ad-
ministrators of the Celina Independent School 
District as a Trustee. He has dedicated his ca-
reer to expanding and improving education ac-
cess for students of all ages in Celina, Texas. 
Moreover, he served as President of the 
Celina School Board for five years and worked 
on the Alla Hubbard Educational Trust Board 
for eight years. Choc leaves behind a powerful 
legacy that encompasses an efficient school 
administration, updated facilities, and ex-
panded access to education. Generations of 
students, teachers, and administrators will 
benefit from Choc’s extraordinary contributions 
to the Celina ISD community. 
Mr. Christopher was instrumental to Celina 
ISD’s rapid growth, and through his leader-
ship, the students of Celina experienced brand 
new, state-of-the-art educational facilities and 
sports complexes. Choc is also a twenty-one- 
year member of the Celina Quarterback Club 
and had the privilege of operating the clock for 
Celina High School and Celina Middle School 
football games—his favorite pastime. 
I have requested a United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize 
Choc Christopher’s lifelong contributions to the 
good people of Celina, Texas. Furthermore, 
Madam Speaker, I would like to personally 
commend Mr. Christopher for his years of 
dedication to Celina ISD. May God bless him 
in all his future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING 
GUAM’S 
NATIBU 
DANCE ACADEMY ON THEIR 27TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MICHAEL F. Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Guam’s Natibu Dance 
Academy (Natibu) for their exceptional talents, 
acclaimed 
performances, 
and 
outstanding 
commitment as ambassadors of our island 
community, CHamoru heritage, and vibrant 
Pacific region. I would like to further congratu-
late Dr. Benjamin ‘‘Benjie’’ Santiago for over 
27 years of leadership in advancing the Hafa 
Adai spirit beyond Guam’s shores by fostering 
the skills and passions of countless dancers 
through the Academy. 
Impassioned with a mission to cultivate 
greater 
cultural 
diversity 
in 
dance, 
Dr. 
Santiago founded Natibu in 1995. From a 
humble summer camp at the Barrigada Com-
munity Center to success on numerous inter-
national stages, the group that once consisted 
of only 21 students has grown into a thriving 
agent of CHamoru pride, learning, generosity, 
and excellence. Uniquely navigating a mix of 
CHamoru, Hawaiian, Tahitian, and Maori 
genres, Natibu is a visionary force in the world 
of traditional dance. Dr. Santiago’s certifi-
cations 
by 
the 
late 
Uncle 
George 
Lanakilakeikiahiali’i Na’ope and Al Makahinu 
Barcarse as Kumu Hula in 1999 and 2002 re-
spectively, further strengthen his ability to ex-
plore new opportunities for Natibu dancers to 
rise as champions of artistic discovery. 
The numerous recognitions Natibu has gar-
nered throughout the years illustrate the dis-
tinction with which they represent Guam. In 
addition to earning the Governor’s arts awards 
and Hafa Adai spirit award, the group has ob-
tained several top placements in the local 
Guahan Asia Hula Festival and Dinann˜a’ 
Minagof Chamorro Dance Competitions. With 
Honorary 1st and Overall Championship titles 
at Oahu festivals including the Keiki Hula 
Competition, King Kamehameha Hula Com-
petition, Hula ‘Oni Festival, and the E Ho’i Mai 
I ka Piko Hula World Invitational, they also 
maintain a fine record of elevating Guam’s 
presence among international communities. 
Moreover, they have tirelessly pursued greater 
connections with places as far as Taiwan, 
China, Japan, and the Philippines through var-
ious promotional collaborations with the Guam 
Visitors Bureau. 
On behalf of the People of Guam, I would 
like to extend a sincere congratulations to the 
Natibu Dance Academy for their many years 
of service to our island, region, and larger Pa-
cific family. The traditions and stories they 
share through the art of cultural dance admi-
rably empower our community, enrich others, 
and inspire many more to similarly honor the 
histories inscribed on our Pacific peoples. I 
further 
commend 
Dr. 
Benjamin 
‘‘Benjie’’ 
Santiago for his dedication to developing novel 
connections between cultural revitalization, 
transpacific identity, and the gifts and talents 
of our youth. It is truly an honor to join both 
Natibu and Dr. Santiago as they celebrate 
nearly three decades of achievements and 
growth, and I look forward to seeing the next 
chapter of their journey as they continue to 
elevate CHamoru and Pacific voices.

Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Ms. Karen Aponte on

munities of Los Angeles, Ms. Aponte will be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

May 31, 2022 
Ms. Aponte’s career began in June 1980 
with the City of Los Angeles as a parking at-
tendant. In April 1986, she joined the Los An-
geles Police Department as a Police Service 
Representative, where she answered to 9–1– 
1 emergency calls as a frontline responder to 
those in need of help. In times of crisis and 
major events, Ms. Aponte provided consistent 
and critical support to law enforcement. Ms. 
Aponte’s achievements have resulted in more 
than 27 well-deserved commendations during 
her career. 
She earned recognition for her performance 
during the 1992 Civil Unrest, the devasting 
1994 earthquake, her professionalism during 
situations with distressed children, and during 
the Lakers Championship parade in 2000 
when a tactical alert was declared after 
250,000 people filled the streets of Los Ange-
les. During the Democratic National Conven-
tion in 2020, Ms. Aponte received praise for 
her commitment to service excellence. 
In 2001 Ms. Aponte was assigned to the 
Timekeeping Unit where she evolved as the 
timekeeping subject expert. She worked dili-
gently to ensure the smooth function of the 
unit as she exceptionally performed all her du-
ties. There was no task too big or too small 
that Ms. Aponte did not welcome. 
For her remarkable accomplishments, it is 
my honor to recognize Police Service Rep-
resentative II Karen Aponte. Her decades of 
public service and commitment to the Depart-
ment and the people of Los Angeles are wor-
thy of the highest commendation.

HONORING 75 YEARS OF THE 
MICHIGAN WATER COLOR SOCIETY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Michigan Water Color 
Society as they celebrate their seventy-fifth 
anniversary. Their significant contributions to 
our community and their seventy-five years 
spent promoting local artists and their work 
throughout the state of Michigan are worthy of 
commendation. 
In September 1946, a group of about 70 
watercolorists interested in forming a state-
wide society met in the galleries at Detroit’s 
Scarab Club to discuss creating what became 
the Michigan Water Color Society. Their ex-
ploratory meeting focused on the need for in-
tegrity, professionalism, and inclusion of all 
points of view. By the end of the year, the So-
ciety was established, with Emil Weddige of 
the University of Michigan and William Bostick 
of the Detroit Institute of Arts serving as the 
first co-presidents. Their first exhibition was 
held in Detroit in June 1947, featuring fifty- 
nine unique paintings. 
Annual juried exhibitions are the Michigan 
Water Color Society’s premier event, these ex-
hibitions feature watercolor paintings by Michi-
gan 
artists 
and 
are 
on 
display 
for 
Michiganders and art enthusiasts of all ages to 
see. Winning artists receive cash prizes, and 
their paintings are then shown at museums 
around the state. The Michigan Water Color 
Society also provides other opportunities for 
Michigan artists to display their art such as 
‘‘Out of the Box’’—a ‘‘not necessarily water-
color’’ art showcase that exhibits other artistic 
mediums beyond watercolor. A volunteer-run 
organization, the Michigan Water Color Soci-
ety has created a welcoming community for 
artists of all ages and backgrounds. They work 
tirelessly to promote and showcase the talents 
of our Michigan artists and share their passion 
for art with us all. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the Michigan Water Color So-
ciety on this special day. We are grateful for 
their seven and a half decades spent enrich-
ing our culture in the state of Michigan. We 
wish them the very best in the years to come 
and congratulate them on their seventy-fifth 
annual exhibition at the Kayrod Gallery in De-
troit, the city where it all began so many years 
ago.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ENSURING 
CHILD HEALTH COVERAGE COM-
PENSATION IN DIVORCE ACT OF 
2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Ensuring Child Health Coverage 
Compensation in Divorce Act of 2022. This bill 
would require that when a court directs a non- 
custodial parent (including a stepparent) to 
provide health insurance for a child, the other 
parent can get reimbursed directly from the in-
surer for any out-of-pocket medical expenses 
for the child incurred by such parent, regard-
less of the source of insurance. 
In a divorce, one parent is typically court-or-
dered to provide health insurance for the child 
to prevent the child from being uninsured. 
However, the other parent may pay for out-of- 
pocket medical expenses for the child that are 
reimbursable by the insurer. Under the Em-
ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974, group health insurers are required to di-
rectly reimburse a parent who pays for reim-
bursable 
out-of-pocket 
medical 
expenses 
when the other parent has been court-ordered 
to provide health insurance for the child. How-
ever, other health insurers are not required to 
directly reimburse the other parent. 
This bill would provide the same require-
ments for all health insurers to ensure that the 
parent who pays for the out-of-pocket medical 
expenses is reimbursed. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
f 
RECOGNIZING WOMEN’S HEALTH 
MONTH 
HON. SHONTEL M. BROWN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Women’s Health 
Month. This month, we seek to empower 
women to make their health a priority and re-
commit to raising awareness of and address-
ing the conditions and diseases that impact 
women across America. 
As a woman and as a Black Woman, I am 
keenly aware of the health challenges that dis-
proportionately impact women of color. From 
maternal health and autoimmune diseases to 
mental health and various forms of cancer, 
women—especially women of color—experi-
ence a variety of unique health care issues. 
Expanding access to health care and improv-
ing outreach, awareness, prevention and treat-
ment strategies is critically important. 
This Women’s Health Month, I would like to 
draw attention to Uterine Fibroids. More than 
25 million American women suffer from Uter-
ine Fibroids, and around 80 percent of Black 
Women can expect to experience them by age 
50. This disease can be devastating to a 
woman’s life and her reproductive health. It 
causes debilitating symptoms and can nega-
tively impact fertility. Uterine fibroids are a se-
rious public health challenge, and they expose 
and exacerbate underlying racial health dis-
parities. 
In the face of this challenge, we need more 
funding for prevention, diagnosis, and treat-
ment interventions, as well as public edu-
cation. That is why I am proud to cosponsor 
Congresswoman YVETTE CLARKE’S landmark 
bill, the Stephanie Tubbs Jones Uterine Fi-
broid Research and Education Act. The bill, 
named after my esteemed predecessor in 
Ohio’s Eleventh District who was a longtime 
champion for women’s health issues during 
her time in Congress, would increase research 
funding for uterine fibroids.

Specifically, the bill would establish $150 
million in research funding for the National In-
stitute of Health and create a new public edu-
cation program through the CDC. To help ad-
dress the grave threat uterine fibroids pose to 
women of color, the bill specifically highlights 
the need to raise awareness of Uterine 
fibroids in the Black community. 
I am proud to join Congresswoman CLARKE 
and my other colleagues in supporting this 
critical bill, and I look forward to its swift con-
sideration here in the House.

HONORING THE PATRIOTIC 
SERVICE OF OUR FALLEN HEROES 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the patriotic service of the men and 
women who have given their lives in defense 
of the United States. From the icy waters of 
General Washington’s crossing of the Dela-
ware River to the burning sands of the Middle 
East, our armed forces have continuously de-
voted themselves to the cause of freedom and 
liberty for all Americans and our allies. 
Today, this great Nation takes a moment to 
honor those who have given the last full 
measure of devotion that we might continue to 
proclaim the United States as the Land of the 
Free and the Home of the Brave. Our warriors 
have ensured with their very blood that all 
Americans might live in peace and security. 
Our warriors have fought in the trenches, on 
the beaches, in the streets, and on the seas. 
They have faced the most violent and evil foes 
in human history and have claimed victory. 
From my very own district hailed one of the 
finest examples of American bravery, First 
Lieutenant Audie Murphy. He remains the 
most decorated American Soldier in our Na-
tion’s history having received the Medal of 
Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver 
Star Medals, three Bronze Stars, three Purple 
Hearts, and many other citations. Lt. Murphy 
hailed from Kingston, Texas in Hunt County. 
While he is a shining example of American 
heroism, this same spirit lives on in all who 
have heeded the call to serve their Nation 
from the Fourth District. Others from the 
Texas’ Fourth Congressional District who 
heeded the call of duty include the following 
heroes: 
First Lieutenant Allen Arthur Brill served our 
nation during the Second World War as a Pilot 
in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Born in Franklin 
County in 1916, Lt. Brill was awarded the Dis-
tinguished Service Cross, Air Medal, and Pur-
ple Heart. 
Lieutenant Colonel Oren Calvin Atchley of 
Hunt County gave the last full measure of de-
votion for us in the mountains of the Korean 
Peninsula. He was awarded the Distinguished 
Service Cross, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart. 
U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Daniel Lasaule 
Chappell of Camp County was KIA in the 
dense forests of South Vietnam defending the 
free world. He was awarded the Purple Heart 
for his selfless courage. 
Staff Sergeant Ennis Murry Bankhead of 
Lamar County, Specialist Four Jose Sanchez 
Monetmayor of Fannin County, Lieutenant 
Warren Bacon Wisdom, Private First Class 
Darrel 
D. 
Council, 
and 
many 
other 
servicemembers of the Fourth District who 
have given their lives bearing the torch of free-
dom for all of us. 
I have requested a United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize 
our warriors and their families whose sac-
rifices have secured the blessings of freedom 
and liberty for generations. It is my hope that 
we never forget these individuals and may 
God rest their souls.

RECOGNIZING 
GILMAN 
INTER-
NATIONAL SCHOLARSHIP RECIPI-
ENTS 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize six young men and women 
in my district who were awarded the Benjamin 
A. Gilman International Scholarship to study 
abroad during the 2019–2020 and 2020–2021 
academic years. This program’s mission to 
‘‘expand the number of young American citi-
zens gaining knowledge, linguistic, and cul-
tural skills that are critical to our national secu-
rity and prosperity’’ is admirable, and our com-
munity is incredibly proud of the following stu-
dents’ achievement: 
Humna Chaudhry of Bensalem, PA, study-
ing in Singapore; 
Sabrina De Nicola of Churchville, PA, study-
ing in Spain; 
Humna Rub of Doylestown, PA, studying in 
the United Kingdom; 
Ryan Smith of Warrington, PA, studying in 
Indonesia; 
Ian Yannuzzi of Southampton, PA, studying 
in New Zealand; 
Mikaila Harper of Chalfont, PA, studying in 
Uganda. 
At a time where our Nation’s policy ap-
proach to security and diplomacy is actively 
challenged and adapting, the conviction of 
these young men and women is exceptional. 
We commend their participation in the Gilman 
Scholarship and are grateful for their commit-
ment to strengthening the relationships and 
standing of the United States around the 
world.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
104TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 104th anniversary of the Re-
public Day of Azerbaijan, and to extend my 
best wishes to all Azerbaijanis. May 28th 
marked the founding of the Democratic Re-
public of Azerbaijan, when the people of Azer-
baijan first gained their independence from the 
Russian Empire in 1918. Although Soviet 
forces ended Azerbaijan’s independence in 
1920, the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan 
was the world’s first secular parliamentary 
democratic republic in a predominantly Muslim 
nation—earning diplomatic recognition from 
the United States during the administration of 
President Woodrow Wilson. We also recall 
that the Democratic-Republic of Azerbaijan 
granted universal suffrage to its citizens in 
1918, making it the first Muslim country to give 
women the right to vote. 
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
Azerbaijan restored its independence on Octo-
ber 18, 1991, when its Parliament adopted the 
Constitution Act on the Restoration of the 
State of Independence of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan. 
Azerbaijan has emerged as a key partner 
for enhancing global energy security, espe-
cially as the U.S. and European countries look 
for alternatives to Russian energy in the wake 
of Putin’s unjustified war against Ukraine. 
Azerbaijan provides roughly 40 percent of 
Israel’s oil consumption and enjoys friendly 
ties with Israel beyond oil sales. Jews have re-
sided in Azerbaijan for 2,500 years without 
persecution and today, the Jewish community 
in Azerbaijan numbers over 12,000. Azer-
baijan is also home to Christian communities 
and has been praised for its religious toler-
ance by the European Parliament. 
It is also worth noting that Azerbaijan has 
provided 
significant 
humanitarian 
aid 
to 
Ukraine during this trying time, an exception 
among former Soviet non-NATO countries that 
led Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 
to publicly thank the President of Azerbaijan 
for this courageous step. 
Azerbaijan is a key global security partner 
for the United States. As an active member of 
NATO’s Partnership for Peace program, Azer-
baijan cooperates with the United States in 
countering terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and 
narcotics trafficking. Azerbaijani troops were 
among the last partner militaries to leave 
Kabul airport, facilitating the evacuation until 
the very end. 
As co-chair of the Congressional Azerbaijan 
Caucus, I stand with the Azerbaijani people as 
they continue to work towards independence 
and security as well as to embrace human 
rights and democratic values. I congratulate 
the people of Azerbaijan on the centennial of 
their Republic Day. May the partnership be-
tween the United States and Azerbaijan 
progress and continue to benefit both of our 
nations.

all for their country. We commend our vet-
erans for their honorable service to this coun-
try and all of the work they continue to do for 
our communities. We are proud to honor and 
recognize them this Memorial Day at the fu-
ture site of Eden Park. 
Eden Park is a vibrant outdoor area located 
in Southwest Detroit and will be the first park 
in Michigan catered specifically for Alzheimer’s 
patients and their caregivers. It will also offer 
senior, veteran, and disabled citizens’ accom-
modations. This environmentally conscious 
park will contain beautiful botanical gardens, 
large and eco-friendly trees, raised vegetable 
gardens, walking paths, a playground for chil-
dren, an amphitheater, a veteran’s memorial, 
and other picnic and play opportunities. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the Board of Directors and 
Staff of Tri-City Community Development Cor-
poration and the Eden Park Community 
Project Steering Committee on this day. We 
would especially like to thank Crystal Ancrum, 
Reverend William J. Price, and Miranda 
White-Redley who all served our country hon-
orably in the United States Army and put to-
gether this special event. We are thankful for 
the work that this organization has done to im-
prove the lives of Detroiters through their tire-
less advocacy and look forward to the opening 
of Eden Park. I thank them for coming to-
gether today to honor those who have served 
our country.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF THE INDIAN AMERICAN COM-
MUNITY IN CENTRAL FLORIDA 
AND 
THE 
RELATIONSHIP 
BE-
TWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA 
AND THE UNITED STATES OF 
AMERICA 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I acknowledge 
the strong, multidimensional, and mutually vital 
partnership between the United States of 
America and the Republic of India. Our two 
nations 
share 
a 
partnership 
for 
peace, 
progress, and prosperity. The solidarity be-
tween our two democratic countries and open 
economies is a force for global good. 
One of the important pillars of this relation-
ship is the enduring bridge provided by the In-
dian American community in my district. I reg-
ularly meet with Indian American community 
members, including successful hotel owner 
Mr. Jan Gautam, and learn from them about 
our Indian friends and their progress. Support 
from the Indian-American community, through 
the Asian American Hotel Owners Association, 
was instrumental in assisting Puerto Rico fol-
lowing Hurricane Maria. 
During my past trip to India, our delegation 
was briefed on the significance of advance-
ments in Artificial Intelligence technology, its 
role in the relationship between our nations, 
and its possible applications to the industry 
and workforce. We met with former Chairman 
of the Indian Space Research Organization, 
Aluru Seelin Kiran Kumar, where we dis-
cussed its organizational structure, mission 
focus, applications, and accomplishments. 
Later, in meetings with the former Minister of 
Science and Technology Harsh Vardhan, we 
discussed the importance of space exploration 
and cybersecurity advancement, all in the con-
text of collaboration between our great democ-
racies. 
I recently met with the Indian Consul Gen-
eral to the Southeast, Dr. Swati Kulkarni. I 
learned about India’s developmental efforts, 
including efforts through the recent announce-
ment of the 2022–23 Union Budget. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, our two 
nations worked closely. There was robust col-
laboration in the health sector, including in 
vaccines, where the U.S. provided raw mate-
rials to India for vaccine production during a 
time of surging cases in the country. 
I look forward to continued collaboration be-
tween the United States of America and the 
Republic of India.

Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my great honor to recognize Oceanside 
resident Rose Teding as my May Constituent 
of the Month. Rose has dedicated countless 
hours to various community service projects to 
help the Oceanside community and has in-
spired many others to join in her efforts. 
As President of the Woman’s Club of 
Oceanside, Rose Teding has been donating 
more than half of her time in a volunteer ca-
pacity to the Oceanside community for years. 
In her capacity as President, Rose oversees a 
large volunteer team that facilitates community 
service programs, engages in civic outreach, 
supports children and domestic and sexual as-
sault victims, helps individuals experiencing 
homelessness, 
and 
more. 
Even 
during 
COVID–19, the Woman’s Club of Oceanside 
still organized and found ways to safely serve 
our community members. 
During Asian American and Native Hawai-
ian/Pacific Islander Heritage Month, I am 
proud to celebrate the exceptional work of in-
dividuals like Rose Teding who volunteer their 
time and contribute to our unique and beautiful 
district. I’m so grateful for CA–49 residents 
who dedicate their lives to the betterment of 
our residents and community, and I’m proud to 
honor Rose Teding as my May Constituent of 
the Month.

Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of Rose Linda 
Korten. Living in Millsboro, DE, formerly of 
East Brunswick, NJ, Rose Linda Korten 
passed away on Sunday, May 15, 2022, at 
her home, surrounded by her loving family. 
She was 73 years old. 
Born in the Bronx, NY, she resided in East 
Brunswick before settling in Millsboro, DE, 7 
years ago. Rose attended Walton High School 
in The Bronx, NY; received her Bachelor’s De-
gree in Health and Physical Education from 
Long Island University, and 2 Masters De-

vision from Hunter College, New York, NY. 
Prior to retiring in 2003, she was the Deputy 
Director of the Public-School Athletic League 
for the New York City Board of Education. She 
worked with high school students at Seward 
Park High School for over 30 years. 
She enjoyed volunteering at the food pantry 
at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church, word games, 
and visiting casinos. She adored animals, es-
pecially her Bichon Frise, Vegas. 
Surviving are her lifelong partner and wife of 
40 years, Brenda Pinkney; their son, Duane 
Anthony Pinkney, Sr. of Atlanta, GA; grandson 
Duane Anthony Pinkney, Jr. (Shanita Thigpen) 
and granddaughter Hannah Rose Pinkney

friends who loved her dearly. 
Again, I honor the life and work of Rose

HONORING THE LIFE AND PATRI-
OTIC 
SERVICE 
OF 
PRIVATE 
JAMES WILLIAM BROWN 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and commemorate the life and serv-
ice of Private James William Brown. James 
honorably served in the United Stated Marine 
Corps during the Vietnam War. He tragically 
has been missing in action since April 5, 1966. 
This Memorial Day, he is being remembered 
by his family, friends, and neighbors in his 
hometown of Maud, Texas. As the Congress-
man for that district, I would like to join them 
in commemorating Private Brown. 
James was born on July 22, 1946, and was 
a resident of Maud, Texas where he lived with 
his parents William and Shirley. James was 
the oldest sibling and is now survived by his 
sister Becky Sorsby and brothers Mark Brown 
and Bill Embry, Jr. 
Eight years into the Vietnam War, when 
more than half of the men eligible for the draft 
were deferred, exempted, or disqualified, 17- 
year-old James proactively answered the call 
to serve his country. Putting country over self, 
he decided to end his high school education 
and enlisted in the United States Marine 
Corps on August 30, 1963. 
A little over two and a half years later, 
James found himself as a rifleman for Com-
pany B, 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, 
1st Marine Division in a hazy jungle of South 
Vietnam. While engaged in a combat mission 
against hostile forces, James was the lead 
scout towing a rope across the Rach La River 
in Vietnam’s Mekong River Delta in an effort 
to secure safe passage for the rest of his unit. 
That is when the river’s waters began to rise 
quickly, and he was overtaken by the 
duplicitous waters. After days of searching, he 
was declared missing in action. Private James 
William Brown paid the ultimate sacrifice and

56 years later, his body has yet to be recov-
ered. 
Private James William Brown posthumously 
received the Purple Heart, National Defense 
Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Viet-
nam Campaign Medal, Vietnam Gallantry 
Cross, Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, 
and Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal for his 
service and bravery. 
This Memorial Day in Maud, Texas, the 
town where he enlisted and one in which I 
proudly represent in the United States Con-
gress, there will be a memorial stone dedi-
cated to the honor and sacrifice of Marine Pri-
vate James William Brown. This event is 
sponsored by SPC Israel Garza of the Amer-
ican Legion, Post 161 and will be highly at-
tended, as so deserved. I pray that the mem-
ory of this patriot will live on in all those who 
attend this memorial. 
Madam Speaker, I have shared with the 
House today only a small portion of this great 
American’s life. I have requested a United 
States flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol 
to recognize Private James William Brown’s 
patriotism and devotion to God, family, and 
country. Furthermore, Madam Speaker, I ex-
tend my personal condolences to the family of 
James for the loss of such an extraordinary 
man of service and duty. May God rest his 
soul.

INTERNATIONAL LGBTQI+ RIGHTS 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor the LGBTQIA+ community as we 
enter Pride month and reaffirm our commit-
ment to LGBTQ rights for people all over the 
world. Everyone should have equal protection 
under the law regardless of sexual orientation, 
gender identity, or gender expression. We 
shall celebrate and commemorate our diversity 
and raise awareness over the issues that 
plague 
our 
communities, 
including 
the 
LGBTQIA+ communities. 
The LGBTQIA+ community is filled with gi-
ants who have made immeasurable contribu-
tions to our country, including Marsha P. John-
son, who dedicated her life to helping home-
less transgender youth and who led the 
Stonewall uprising, Harvey Milk, the first open-
ly gay official in California, and Audre Lorde, 
the writer who devoted her life to confronting 
the intersectionality of discrimination. 
It is unconscionable that anti-LGBTQ+ dis-
crimination continues to threaten the LGBTQ+ 
community. From workplace discrimination, 
lack of access to healthcare, homelessness, to 
high rates of violence, it is no secret that 
these issues are systemic. 
LGBTQIA+ rights are critical to the future of 
this country. Our country is stronger and better 
off when everyone is protected under the law 
and has the equal opportunity. I reintroduced 
H. Res. 1128, the 2022 Resolution Calling to 
End Homophobia, Transphobia, Biphobia, and 
Intersexphobia, to uplift the LGBTQIA+ com-
munity. H. Res. 1128 is a call for full equality 
and acceptance for all LGBTQIA+ people in 
this country and around the world. 
We must take immediate steps to address 
the disparities in access to healthcare and cul-
tivate inclusive environments in all our com-
munities. Make no mistake, we still have a 
long way to go to achieve true equality, but we 
have the power to take a step in the right di-
rection. In a world where we can be anything, 
let’s choose to be allies who love their neigh-
bors, no matter who they love. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the entire House to 
join me in uplifting LGBTQIA+ rights in all our 
communities. Our country and world win when 
people are free from discrimination and are 
given equal opportunity. We must protect this 
community and we must find the political will 
to do it.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
GENERAL JOSEPH M. MARTIN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 31, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize General Joseph M. Martin 
on the occasion of his retirement. We are hon-
ored to have him returning home to serve as 
the Grand Marshal for the City of Dearborn’s 
ninety-sixth annual Memorial Day Parade. His 
honorable years of service to our community 
and to our entire country are worthy of com-
mendation. 
Born and raised in Dearborn, Michigan, 
General Martin is a graduate of Dearborn High 
School. He went on to attend the United 
States Military Academy at West Point and 
earned degrees at the University of Louisville, 
the U.S. Army Command and General Staff 
College, and the U.S. Army War College. After 
graduation from West Point, he joined the 1st 
Battalion, 37th Armor Regiment, 1st Armored 
Division. Following years of successful brigade 
command domestically and during deploy-
ments through Operation Desert Storm and 
Operation Iraqi Freedom, he became the Chief 
of Staff of III Corps at Fort Hood. Some of his 
other assignments include Observer/Controller 
at Fort Irwin, Aide to the Commanding Gen-
eral at the U.S. Armor Center at Fort Knox, 
Battalion and Brigade Operations Officer and 
Aide to the III Corps Commanding General at 
Fort Hood, Armor Branch and Fires and Ef-
fects Division Chief at the U.S. Army Human 
Resources Command, and Initiatives Group 
Director for the Commander of U.S. Forces 
Iraq and U.S. Joint Forces Command. General 
Martin was appointed to serve as Vice Chief 
of the Chief of Staff of the Army on July 26, 
2019. 
Having served in the Army for thirty-six 
years, General Martin is the recipient of nu-
merous awards and commendations for re-
markable service, including the Army Distin-
guished Service Medal, the Defense Superior 
Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the 
Bronze Star Medal. Even though he is the 
third-highest ranking officer in the U.S. Army 
and is highly decorated, he serves this Nation 
with the pride and humility of a true patriot. In 
his role as Vice Chief of the Chief of Staff of 
the Army, he is always searching for new 
ways to support our men and women in uni-
form, including focusing on mental health ef-
forts to save soldiers at risk of death by sui-
cide. He resides in the Washington, DC area 
with his wife Leann and their two children, 
Joey and Kylie. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring General Joseph M. Martin for 
a career of exemplary service to our Nation in 
the U.S. Army. I join with General Martin’s 
family, friends, and colleagues in extending 
my gratitude to him from a grateful Nation and 
thank him for all he has done for our armed 
forces. We also thank him for serving as 
Grand Marshal this Memorial Day as we come 
together to honor those who gave their all for 
this country. We wish him the best in retire-
ment.
