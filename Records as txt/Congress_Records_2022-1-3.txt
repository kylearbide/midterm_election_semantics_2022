Almighty God, we orient ourselves to

Consecrate this new year that it 
would be a year of spiritual joy and

will, Your absolute Word, Your loving 
intent. 
Direct all our energies according to 
Your purpose for the common good of 
our fellow Americans. 
Give us the skill to serve You. In 
Your grace, You have surrounded each 
of the country’s Representatives with 
talented advisers, diligent staff mem-
bers, exceedingly devoted behind-the- 
scenes clerks and recorders, laborers, 
and administrators. Cause all to realize 
the significance of the gifts You have 
uniquely given each person. Remind us 
again that our efforts will prove all the 
more effective when carefully and com-
passionately woven with the talents of 
every other soul with whom we serve. 
By Your mercy, reveal the plans You 
have for this body, plans for hope and 
not harm, that our future will rest 
safely in Your beneficent grace. 
With our whole hearts, we ask Your 
blessing for this new congressional 
year. Lord, hear our prayer. 
Amen.

WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JANUARY 3, 2022 
No. 1 
Senate 
The Senate met at 12:03 p.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable 
TAMMY BALDWIN, a Senator from the 
State of Wisconsin. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Spirit, as the snow falls on 
Capitol Hill, we thank You for being 
our shelter in the time of storm. 
Lord, we live in challenging times 
that require more than human solu-
tions for our problems. In the midst of 
these days, help our lawmakers to find 
in You a sure place to stand and a 
strong support they can absolutely 
trust. Lord, give them such faith in 
You that they will seek and follow 
Your guidance, living lives that honor 
Your Name. Rule in their hearts as 
they deliberate so that Your higher 
wisdom will prevail. 
And Lord, we thank You for the leg-
acies of former Senators Johnny Isak-
son and Harry Reid. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, January 3, 2022. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable TAMMY BALDWIN, a 
Senator from the State of Wisconsin, to per-
form the duties of the Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Ms. BALDWIN thereupon assumed 
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will be in a period of morning 
business, with Senators permitted to 
speak therein for up to 10 minutes 
each. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
SECOND SESSION OF THE 117TH 
CONGRESS 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I had 
hoped to be opening this new session as 
President pro tempore, but I couldn’t 
imagine anybody who is better suited 
to be the Acting President pro tempore 
than the distinguished Senator from 
Wisconsin, and I thank her for being 
here. 
Apparently, to a number of the 
groups around this area, it comes as a 
surprise that it was snowing and the 
snow could be slippery and probably 
they should have gotten some plows 
out. Maybe now they will. If not, we 
can hope for several days of warm sun-
shine, which is the best snow remover 
down here. 
The distinguished Presiding Officer is 
well aware of what snow is like in her 
State, as I am in the State of Vermont, 
and we usually go out and clear the 
roads. But I appreciate those few who 
are out there doing it. I have seen side-
walk plows and other things and some 
road plows, and I applaud those who 
are doing that because it is not an easy 
job. And I realize, coming from the 
State of Vermont where we are used to 
snow, we get used to getting rid of it. 
I know the Senate is thinking of 
going out in 1 or 2 minutes. I will speak 
later this week about the anniversary 
of January 6, and I will state this very, 
very seriously: I am beginning my 48th 
year here, and I have never seen such a 
total abuse of our democracy, not in 
the 48 years I have been here. I have 
cast 17,000 votes, and I cast them with 
the idea of preserving our democracy. 
The people who stormed the Capitol 
had no sense of what a democracy is, 
had no sense of the importance of the 
Senate and the House of Representa-
tives. They had no sense of the impor-
tance of having both political parties 
protecting our Constitution and our 
country. It was a disgraceful time I 
hope never to be repeated. 
I will also speak later about my dear 
and close friend Harry Reid of Nevada, 
who left us in the past few days. Harry 
and I ran the same year. I was in the 
Senate, and we campaigned together 
when he ran. I was thrilled to be re-
elected and thrilled that he was elect-
ed, and I felt so honored to be able to 
vote for him as our leader, both major-
ity leader and minority leader. He was 
a good man. He came from a small, 
rural town, as did I. He believed in the 
U.S. Senate. I think of his memory and 
the memories of others who served in 
both parties who saw the loss of Bob 
Dole, another one who believed in the

Constitution and how this country 
should be run. I believe in the giants 
whom I had a chance to serve with in 
both parties. 
Let us hope that we will see the lead-
ership in both parties roundly condemn 
what we saw a year ago and pray it 
never happens again. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
