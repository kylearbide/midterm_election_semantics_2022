CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E901 
September 9, 2022 
RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF 
COLONEL PETER J. WEINA 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Colonel Peter J. Weina, Ph.D., MD, 
FACP, FIDSA upon his retirement from the Of-
fice of Research Protections at the Defense 
Health Agency. Colonel Weina has served for 
45 years in various federal capacities, and his 
dedicated service will be sorely missed. 
Colonel Weina joined the United States 
Army right out of high school and completed 
both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in zo-
ology at the University of Wisconsin Madison. 
As a second lieutenant, he completed a Ph.D. 
in pathology and parasitology, also at UW 
Madison. After 4 years at the Walter Reed 
Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), he en-
tered medical school at the Uniformed Serv-
ices University of Health Sciences. Mr. Weina 
then completed an internship and residency in 
internal medicine at Tripler Army Medical Cen-
ter and a fellowship in infectious diseases at 
the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. 
Colonel Weina, a board-certified doctor in 
both internal medicine and infectious diseases, 
also holds a Certificate of Knowledge in clin-
ical tropical medicine and travelers’ health. 
From his time as Chief of Pharmacology at 
WRAIR and subsequently as Director of Viral 
Diseases, to his fellowships with the American 
College of Physicians and the Infectious Dis-
eases Society of America, Colonel Weina has 
proven himself a competent leader and a 
measured presence in the medical field. 
Over his illustrious career, Colonel Weina 
has published over 70 articles in peer-re-
viewed journals, five chapters in books, and 
two books of his own. He has worked to ex-
pand the availability and licensure of intra-
venous Artesunate, the first new anti-malarial 
drug since the advent of quinine over 300 
years ago. In 2020, this life-saving treatment 
was licensed by the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration. 
Colonel Weina formerly headed the only 
College of American Pathologists-accredited 
leishmania diagnostics laboratory in the world. 
He has received numerous awards for his 
work, including the Federal CDC Silo Buster’s 
Collaborative Award of Excellence in 2008, the 
Colonel George W. Hunter Ill Certificate in 
2011, and the Bronze Star for Service. Colo-
nel Weina’s accolades extend far beyond 
these, as many have recognized his courage, 
passion, and dedication to bettering his com-
munity. He has combined the opportunity to 
serve his country with the chance to advance 
our medical knowledge and capabilities, and 
our Nation is better off for his efforts. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Colonal Peter J. Weina 
for his 45 years of service to the United 
States. His contributions to our Nation are in-
numerable and his impact has been felt by 
countless Americans. He has been an inspira-
tion and a mentor to the next generation of 
health professionals, and I wish him the best 
in his retirement and may happiness and suc-
cess find him in all future endeavors.

CONCERN OVER RUTGERS REPORT 
ON 
INCREASE 
IN 
ANTI-HINDU 
DISINFORMATION 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to express concern following a recent re-
port published by The Network Contagion Re-
search Institute (NCRI) at Rutgers University 
on an increase in anti-Hindu disinformation 
and Hinduphobic rhetoric on social media plat-
forms such as 4chan, Telegram, Gab, and 
Twitter. As a religious, cultural, and ethnic mi-
nority of Indian and Hindu heritage, I am espe-
cially concerned that hateful rhetoric and 
disinformation can serve as a precursor to vio-
lence in the real-world. 
NCRI’s study, which reviewed social media 
content ranging from January 2019 to June 
2022, found that Hinduphobic tropes—such as 
the portrayal of Hindus as evil, dirty, tyran-
nical, genocidal, irredeemable, or disloyal— 
‘‘are prominent across the ideological spec-
trum and are being deployed by fringe web 
communities and state actors alike.’’ 
Among many concerning findings, this re-
port exposes that organized non-state actors 
such as ISIS have mounted disinformation 
campaigns to suggest that ‘‘Hindu Extremists’’ 
are responsible for attacks proven to be per-
petrated by ISIS. 
In addition, the study found a proliferation of 
anti-Hindu attacks in white supremacist com-
munities. Specifically, NCRI identified a grow-
ing reference on Twitter to the idea that Hin-
dus are ‘‘pajeets’’ who are dirty, backwards, 
and perverted. Similarly, memes on Twitter in 
white supremacist channels borrow antisemitic 
tropes, such as the idea of a ‘‘Zionist Occu-
pied Government.’’ Further, the ‘‘pajeet’’ slur is 
found throughout the platform 4Chan and has 
been used by white supremacists in white na-
tionalist podcasts in reference to violence to-
wards Indians and Indian Americans. 
We need not search far and wide to under-
stand how hate speech, and specifically 
Hinduphobia, can translate to real-world vio-
lence perpetrated against innocent civilians. 
For example, John Earnest, the white su-
premacist shooter of the Chabad Synagogue 
in San Diego in 2019, repeatedly referenced 
‘‘pajeets’’ in his manifesto. This is but one ex-
ample that warrants our collective attention. 
Madam Speaker, we must do everything we 
can to combat hate and racially and religiously 
motivate violence against the 2.5 million Hin-
dus living in the United States, the one billion 
Hindus around the world, and the millions of 
other religious minorities of all faiths across 
the globe. As the proud author of the Hate 
Crimes Commission Act, and cosponsor of re-
cently enacted legislation to encourage the 
DOJ to prosecute hate crimes against reli-
gious, ethnic, and racial minorities, I will con-
tinue to fight to combat hate in all its forms, 
whether it be Hinduphobia, Islamophobia, or 
any other form of hate. Similarly, as the author 
of the Anti-Bullying Act and as Co-Chair of the 
Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus, I will 
continue to fight to combat homophobia and 
transphobia. 
Hinduphobia to date is largely unknown, and 
the authors of the NCRI study note that ‘‘the 
essential first step in combating hate speech 
is to call it out.’’ Today, I am endeavoring to 
use my platform as a Member of the U.S. 
House of Representatives to call out this dis-
turbing trend, a meaningful preliminary action 
in combating hatred towards a community that 
contributes greatly to the cultural fabric and 
economic prosperity of our diverse nation, To 
that end, I call on all Members of Congress to 
stand alongside me in condemning this con-
cerning rise in hateful rhetoric and threats of 
violence.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS OF LLOYD LEWIS 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I, along with 
Representative DIANA DEGETTE, rise today to 
recognize the accomplishments of Lloyd Lewis 
and congratulate him on receiving the World 
Citizenship Award from Civitan International 
for his nearly two decades of tireless advo-
cacy for individuals with intellectual and devel-
opmental disabilities. 
Lloyd made the transition to advocacy fol-
lowing the birth of his son, Kennedy, who was 
diagnosed with Down Syndrome. This diag-
nosis led Lloyd to leave a successful career in 
finance to begin his journey as CEO of Arc 
Thrift Stores of Colorado—an organization that 
supports advocacy services for Coloradans 
with intellectual and developmental disabilities 
since its founding in 1968. 
Under Lloyd’s extraordinary leadership, Arc 
has become one of Colorado’s largest employ-
ers of individuals with intellectual and develop-
mental disabilities through their Ambassador 
program—which Lloyd created. The Ambas-
sador program provides employment with full 
pay and benefits to individuals with disabilities, 
in addition to free social, educational, and pro-
fessional development support. 
The impactful work by Lloyd and Arc doesn’t 
stop there. Arc has donated money, supplies, 
and vouchers to several non-profits throughout 
Colorado when the need arises. In recent 
years, Arc has donated to the Boulder Mar-
shall Fire Relief, COVID relief, and to Ukrain-
ian refugees. 
With this award, Lloyd joins the ranks of dis-
tinguished recipients such as former President

Dwight D. Eisenhower and Sir Winston 
Churchill. The World Citizenship Award is not 
given out annually, rather presented based on 
merit to those who have made a significant 
difference to mankind. 
Lloyd is a shining example for how we 
should all strive to live our lives—as pas-
sionate, dedicated advocates for the diversity 
and inclusion of all people. There is no doubt 
our community is a better place because of 
Lloyd’s leadership at Arc. We congratulate him 
on receiving this award and thank him for his 
tireless work advocating for vulnerable com-
munities in Colorado.

HONORING 
MINNESOTA 
STATE 
REPRESENTATIVE 
CONNIE 
BERNARDY 
HON. ILHAN OMAR 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Minnesota State Representative Connie 
Bernardy for her hard work, accomplishments, 
and service as a member of the Minnesota 
House of Representatives. Within her eight 
terms at the legislature, Rep. Bernardy has 
been a champion for her constituents and es-
pecially on the issues of Higher Education and 
Transportation. I had the great pleasure in 
serving alongside Representative Bernardy in 
2017 and 2018. 
Rep. Bernardy was first elected to the Min-
nesota House of Representatives in 2000. She 
served until 2006 when she decided to switch 
roles and work for Education Minnesota as a 
government-relations specialist. She later re-
turned to the House when she was reelected 
in 2012. Within her District 41A, she currently 
represents neighborhoods in Fridley, New 
Brighton, 
and 
Spring 
Lake 
Park. 
Rep. 
Bernardy is the current Chair of the Higher 
Education Finance and Policy Committee, 
where she made significant progress on mak-
ing higher education more affordable for stu-
dents in Minnesota. 
During her fight for students, she has been 
a strong advocate on hunger free campuses, 
improving access through tuition and textbook 
affordability, dedicated funding for higher ed 
students of color training to become teachers. 
As a transportation leader, Rep. Bernardy has 
pushed for long-term sustainable multi-modal 
transportation funding. Focused on ensuring 
safe access to active transportation for Min-
nesotans who walk, bike, or have a disability. 
Having grown-up in the area, Rep. Bernardy 
truly knows her community and has fought for 
well-deserved changes. Key legislation that I 
want to recognize is her work on the 
Springbrook Wetland Restoration Project, the 
first urban wetland restoration of its kind in the 
nation; securing funding to establish the up-
coming bus rapid transit F-Line; replacing the 
Railroad Bridge in New Brighton; enacting an 
Aquatic Invasive Species Emergency Re-
sponse Plan for Long Lake; and spearheading 
the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency Citizen Advisory Committee. 
Although her time in the legislature is com-
ing to an end, the work put towards her com-
munity and its legacy will never end. Rep-
resentative Bernardy will truly be missed in the 
Minnesota House of Representatives. 
HONORING ALYCE EAGANS 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the legacy of Alyce Eagans, a be-
loved local activist and civil rights pioneer of 
Washington’s Sixth Congressional District. 
Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1929, 
Eagans moved to Bremerton with her family in 
1946. She married Loxie Eagans in 1949, and 
together they helped to found the Kitsap 
Chapter of the NAACP alongside other com-
munity activists James and Lillian Walker and 
Al and Hazel Colvin. They had two children, 
Phyllis and Loxie, Jr. 
She passed away in 2016 from cancer but 
when she got her diagnosis, she didn’t let that 
slow her down. 
Alyce Eagans was a pillar of the community. 
After settling in Bremerton, she worked in the 
supply office at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard 
for 20 years and once she retired, she moved 
on to a career in the Bremerton School Dis-
trict, where she worked in the superintendent’s 
office for 17 years. Eagans continued to volun-
teer with the school district even after retire-
ment. 
During her 70 years in Kitsap County, 
Eagans took on many leadership roles includ-
ing PTA president when her children attended 
school in Bremerton, president of the local 
NAACP chapter and of the Washington State 
United Christian Church Ushers. She worked 
with Dianne Robinson to help found the Black 
Historical Society of Kitsap County, and was 
an active member of the YWCA, the Brem-
erton Central ‘‘Lady Lions’’ and the Kitsap 
County Historical Society. 
Members of our community called her the 
Mother of the community, go-getter, mentor, 
activist, stalwart, and full of endless energy. 
As the Bremerton NAACP Unit 1134 hosts 
their annual Freedom Fund Banquet: Black 
Women are Supreme this weekend—it’s my 
honor to recognize the legacy of a very 
impactful woman in our community whose leg-
acy will live on for years to come.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
WORK 
AND 
ACHIEVEMENTS OF DR. ROBERT 
EICHORN 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the work of Dr. Robert Eichorn who 
is retiring after two decades of work as an ed-
ucator. While a Prince William County Prin-
cipal, Dr. Eichorn’s dedicated service has led 
Independence Nontraditional School to be 
named the first ever model school by the Na-
tional Alternative Education Association. His 
work to meet the needs of an often under-
served community has made education and 
achievement more accessible to Virginia’s 
youth. 
Dr. Eichorn has pushed to reimagine edu-
cation for students, instructors, and the broad-
er Prince William community. He is a fierce 
advocate for the socioeconomically disadvan-
taged children of Virginia and has imple-
mented a learner-centric curriculum to meet 
the needs of the individual. Dr. Eichorn has 
been an advocate and practitioner for over 
thirty years, and his efforts have been crucial 
in the fight for educational equity. 
For years, Dr. Eichorn has served as the 
principal 
at 
Independence 
Nontraditional 
School, which serves students from kinder-
garten through 12th grade. The school pro-
vides a full curriculum, including music, foreign 
language, Advanced Placement, and engi-
neering courses. The school also offers intern-
ships within their career and technical edu-
cation trades programs. The primary focus at 
Independence is to meet the individual needs 
of every student with tailored instruction. For 
those who may need a little extra assistance 
or a second chance, Independence Nontradi-
tional School offers the resources that dis-
advantaged young people need to achieve 
their fullest potential. 
Dr. Eichorn has been the recipient of mul-
tiple awards for his tireless efforts. He was 
named Prince William County Schools’ 2017– 
18 Principal of the Year. In 2020, the National 
Association of Secondary School Principals 
named him a Digital Principal of the Year for 
his leadership through the COVID–19 pan-
demic. He shepherded navigated his school 
as they implemented new technologies to ex-
pand access to students and to maintain a 
semblance of normalcy throughout unprece-
dented hardship. 
As the first model school highlighted by the 
National Alternative Education Association, 
Independence has illuminated the successes 
made possible when our educators strive to 
develop integrity, ingenuity, and intellect in 
every student. With the right resources, we 
must hope to recruit more educators who ex-
emplify the dedication and talent that Dr. 
Eichorn has demonstrated. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Robert Eichorn for his 
unwavering dedication to the young people of 
Prince William County. He has made every ef-
fort to ensure that all children have access to 
the resources they need for a rich and prom-
ising education. His students and colleagues 
alike have expressed their sincere apprecia-
tion for his tremendous service. Dr. Eichorn 
has truly lived up to the Prince William County 
Public Schools motto, ‘‘Providing a World- 
Class Education.’’ I wish him the best in his 
retirement and thank him for the service he 
provided our community.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise

Founded in 1970, the Kings County Com-

gatherings for the elderly—many of whom find 
themselves alone. 
Since then, the KCCOAC has greatly ex-
panded its services for seniors through their 
work providing health and legal services, nutri-
tion programs, rent and utility assistance, tax 
preparation assistance, health insurance coun-
seling, and senior center activities. These are 
just some of the many different programs of-
fered to senior citizens through the KCCOAC 
and essential to thousands of elderly Ameri-
cans throughout Kings County. 
For 50 years, the work done by the Kings 
County Commission on Aging Council has 
been crucial to lifting the spirits of thousands 
of seniors in the Central Valley. Their work 
has directly impacted their lives and provided 
a source of community and necessary serv-
ices to those who need help. 
I ask all my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing the Kings County Commission on Aging 
Council as they celebrate 50 years of incred-
ible work on behalf of seniors.

HONORING WAYNE T. WIRICK, JR. 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Wayne T. 
Wirick, Jr. for 40 years of outstanding service 
to the City of Sonoma. Mr. Wirick has dem-
onstrated his commitment to the local commu-
nity through various roles in service to the City 
of Sonoma, and volunteer work with emer-
gency response departments. 
In the last 40 years, Mr. Wirick has fulfilled 
several roles in the City of Sonoma. He has 
served as Building Inspector, Building Official, 
Project Manager, and Interim Public Works Di-
rector. In these roles, he was involved in en-
suring that buildings were updated and se-
cured to the correct standard, especially as 
the area experienced earthquakes. Mr. Wirick 
was also the Planning Section Chief when the 
city experienced several disasters, including 
the Nuns fires. Currently, he is Sonoma’s Act-
ing City Manager and on-site Information 
Technology specialist 
Volunteer service is an important part of Mr. 
Wirick’s life, as he volunteered with the City of 
Sonoma Fire Department for 17 years. Volun-
teer firefighters are a valuable addition to fire 
departments everywhere, and by participating, 
Mr. Wirick put himself in danger in order to 
protect the people in his community. 
Mr. Wirick has also been recognized for his 
involvement with the Sonoma Valley Boys and 
Girls Club. He has been recognized by the 
Sonoma League for Historic Preservation in 
1988 
for 
his 
involvement 
in 
preserving 
Sonoma City Hall and in 1993 for the City of 
Sonoma Seismic Upgrade Ordinance. 
Mr. Wirick is a family man at heart. He and 
his wife Carol have three children, Matt, 
Danny, Emily, and two grandchildren, Luke 
and Reagan. His community views him as a 
mentor and a leader, with a sense of humor. 
He holds himself and others in his community 
to a high standard, while also maintaining pa-
tience and kindness. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Mr. Wirick 
has worked endlessly to serve his community. 
Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we honor 
him here today.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF TELESCOPE CAS-
UAL FURNITURE IN GRANVILLE, 
NEW YORK 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Telescope Casual Fur-
niture on their 100th Anniversary in Granville, 
New York. For over a hundred years, Tele-
scope Casual Furniture has thrived as a family 
business committed to Made in America man-
ufacturing and community engagement. 
Henry Joseph William Vanderminden Sr. 
founded Telescope Cot Bed & Novelty Co. in 
1903. Mr. Vanderminden began producing 
new cots and camp stools with telescoping 
legs, giving the company its trademark and 
name. Vanderminden was an incredible inno-
vator and used the same contemporary mass 
production techniques as Ford Motor Co. to 
produce his furniture. 
In the early 20th century, Granville was fac-
ing an economic decline as the slate industry 
was slowing. Granville residents, concerned 
for the future of their home, founded the Gran-
ville Community Association to revitalize Gran-
ville’s economic viability. The Granville Com-
munity Association recruited Vanderminden 
and persuaded him to move Telescope to 
Granville in 1921. Today, the partnership be-
tween Telescope and Granville remains vi-
brant. 
After nearly 120 years in business, Tele-
scope continues to serve as a great example 
of the entrepreneurial spirit that defines Up-
state New York and the North Country and is 
a testimony of an incredible locally-owned and 
family-owned business. Telescope Casual Fur-
niture is a staple in the Granville community. 
From the iconic Telescope water tower to the 
company’s decades long involvement with 
Granville Little League, Telescope Casual Fur-
niture has left an indelible impact on the Gran-
ville community. As Granville’s largest private 
employer, Telescope provides hundreds of 
high-skill jobs in New York’s 21st District and 
produces high-quality products that are in de-
mand across the country. 
The tremendous economic impact that Tele-
scope Casual Furniture has had on Granville 
cannot be overstated, and I look forward to 
witnessing their continued success. On behalf 
of New York’s 21st Congressional District, it is 
my honor to celebrate the incredible impact 
Telescope Casual Furniture has had on the 
Granville community for the last 100 years.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
AEROSPACE WEEK 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize National Aerospace Week and more 
than 100 years of American innovation and 
advancements in the aerospace industry, 
which has moved, connected, secured, and in-
spired our world. 
Colorado has the nation’s second largest 
aerospace economy. We are fortunate that so 
many aviation, space, and defense businesses 
call Colorado home. Not only do they employ 
tens of thousands of Coloradans, but they play 
a vital role in our national security, technology 
development, and keeping the U.S. competi-
tive in the global economy. 
The aerospace industry is critical in sup-
porting U.S. national security and defense by 
providing the military and our allies with the 
most technologically advanced platforms and 
systems. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine proved 
the importance of a strong, stable, and resil-
ient defense industrial base. It is because of 
the cutting edge technologies developed by 
U.S. aerospace workers, that we are able to 
aid our allies and safeguard our national inter-
ests. 
In other areas such as civil aviation and 
space, the aerospace industry has long 
shaped technological innovations that help the 
U.S. maintain global leadership in key sectors 
of the global economy. These include aircraft 
and engine design, air traffic control, and 
space exploration. In aviation, the U.S. indus-
try 
continues 
the 
rapid 
development 
of 
groundbreaking technologies to enable ad-
vanced air mobility options and the potential 
return to supersonic commercial transpor-
tation. 
The U.S. aerospace industry is working 
today to build a better, safer, and more pros-
perous tomorrow. I am proud to celebrate Na-
tional Aerospace Week and honor all of the 
people who work tirelessly to develop cutting- 
edge technologies that not only protect Amer-
ican interests, but also put America at the 
forefront of aerospace and defense innovation 
and development.

SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AN-
DERSONS, INC. 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and celebrate the 75th anniversary 
of The Andersons, Inc. The Andersons has a 
remarkable history within the City of Maumee 
and the surrounding region. Over the last 75 
years, The Andersons has been committed to 
its mission of providing extraordinary service 
to both customers and local communities. 
Located in Maumee, Ohio, The Andersons 
was founded in 1947 by Harold and Margaret 
Anderson under the name of Andersons Truck 
Terminal. Their first facility was built to speed 
up deliveries and cut down the lines of grain 
trucks. The 9 truck bays provided efficient 
service and a rapid turnaround for local farm-
ers. The company established a rail-to-ship 
loading area on the Maumee River which gave 
The Andersons access to Lake Erie to ship 
their grain. 
During their first two decades, The Ander-
sons started a retail store, added additional 
grain storage, ear corn and cob milling facili-
ties, and began fertilizer blending. With the 
opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, 
The Andersons were able to ship products out 
of the Great Lakes. To accommodate this ex-
pansion, the company opened the first deep- 
water grain loading facility on the U.S. side of 
the Great Lakes. The company continued to 
open new elevators, including the first elevator 
in the U.S. that could load 100 car unit trains. 
In the 1970s, as grain receipts tripled, and the 
company’s river elevator was expanded. 
The 1980s and 90s brought significant ex-
pansion for The Andersons. The company 
opened additional retail stores in Toledo and 
Columbus that served the community with a 
variety of products including produce, baked 
goods, farm tools, and feed for livestock. They 
opened liquid fertilizer facilities along the 
Maumee River, and elevators were opened in 
Indiana and Michigan. The company entered 
the rail leasing business and acquired a num-
ber of grain and liquid storage facilities across 
Indiana. On February 20, 1996, The Ander-
sons was incorporated and was listed on the 
NASDAQ. 
Over the past two decades, the company 
entered the ethanol business and initially 
oversaw the operations of three ethanol 
plants. It expanded its operations under The 
Andersons Denison Ethanol, LLC and ac-
quired an ethanol plant in Denison, Iowa. The 
company has continued to pivot towards more 
sustainable and organic products. In 2021, 
The Andersons purchased Capstone Com-
modities which has allowed the company to 
serve the feed market industries in New Mex-
ico and Texas. 
The key element of The Andersons busi-
ness philosophy is to build strong commu-
nities. The company has dedicated time, tal-
ent, and financial resources to support their 
employees and the communities they are part 
of. Through their charitable contributions, The 
Andersons has been able to support commu-
nities across the country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to The Andersons, 
Inc. and its staff, past and present, on this re-
markable occasion. By celebrating the 75th 
anniversary, Ohio residents recognize the con-
tribution of The Andersons to our region and 
community. Congratulations to The Andersons 
on this significant milestone.

RECOGNIZING SYLVIO DUPUIS 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Sylvio Dupuis and his life- 
long service to the city of Manchester, where 
he was born and raised. A proud alumnus of 
Manchester schools and Saint Anselm Col-
lege, Syl became an optometrist and built a 
successful private practice while also serving 
in the Air National Guard. This spirit of service 
was best embodied by Syl’s two terms as 
Mayor of Manchester and his emphasis on 
finding community-based solutions for the 
Queen City’s most pressing issues. 
Syl’s steadfast leadership and expertise led 
to a major revitalization effort in Central Man-
chester, which saw funding secured from HUD 
used to purchase the former Sacred Heart 
Hospital. Today, this facility is home to ninety- 
five subsidized rental apartments operated by 
the Manchester Housing and Redevelopment 
Authority. Syl’s involvement in the community 
extended well past his two terms as Mayor, in-
cluding his roles as a founding President of 
Catholic Medical Center, Commissioner of 
Health and Human Services, and later Com-
missioner of Insurance. 
Syl’s leadership on housing issues also ben-
efited NeighborWorks in their formative years, 
resulting in the organization converting the 
Straw Mansion at the former Notre Dame Col-
lege into affordable rental apartments for 
Manchester’s workforce. It is both fitting and 
proper that Syl’s service to the community be 
recognized with the David P. Goodwin Out-
standing Neighbor Award, and I can think of 
no one more deserving of the title ‘‘out-
standing neighbor.’’ 
Syl’s vision for a safer, cleaner Manchester 
has made the Queen City one of the largest 
metropolitan centers in New Hampshire, and 
we owe him and his wife, Cecile, a debt of 
gratitude for their dedication to our state. On 
behalf of my constituents in New Hampshire’s 
First Congressional District, I want to con-
gratulate Sylvio Dupuis for his tireless commit-
ment to Manchester and thank him for his out-
standing contributions to the community.

HONORING THE LENOLA VOLUN-
TEER FIRE COMPANY ON THEIR 
100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the Lenola Volunteer Fire 
Company on their 100-year anniversary of 
service to the Moorestown community, and 
New Jersey’s 3rd District. 
Since its informal founding in 1922 out of 
one of the first volunteers’ houses to its fire-
house location today, the Lenola Volunteer 
Fire Company has been dedicated to pro-
tecting the Moorestown area and saving 
countless lives in our community. As a fully 
volunteer-led fire company, with some being 
the 2nd or 3rd generations of fire fighters in 
their families, each member has devoted their 
time and service to the safety of our neigh-
bors. Whether it be major fires, car accidents, 
or various incidents in between, members of 
the Lenola Volunteer Fire Company have con-
sistently answered the call to service in peo-
ple’s times of need. 
Over the years, the Lenola Volunteer Fire 
Company has been recognized by many as a 
pillar of community building in our district.

While they have been there to help in times of 
emergency, they have also provided numer-
ous programs and events for community out-
reach for people to enjoy. From their 69-year- 
old 
Easter 
egg 
hunt 
to 
various 
other 
Moorestown traditions, you can often find 
Lenola Volunteer Fire Company supporting 
other local activities. 
Not only have volunteers gained recognition 
by residents in the Moorestown area, but they 
have also been recognized throughout the 
state of New Jersey for their skills in the field 
and years of service. Across all of New Jer-
sey, Lenola Volunteer Fire Company is well- 
known for their outstanding accomplishments 
in fire truck musters and competing with var-
ious fire departments across the state. Award-
ed the Presidents Trophy four times, with 3 of 
those being in consecutive years, Lenola Vol-
unteer Fire Company has showcased the suc-
cess and expertise of their firefighters year 
after year. 
Our volunteer firefighters are integral to 
building and maintaining the safer, more se-
cure, and more connected communities we 
wish to live in. On the centennial anniversary 
of the Lenola Volunteer Fire Company, I thank 
each of their volunteers over the years for 
their service to our communities.

AUGUST CONSTITUENT OF THE 
MONTH STATEMENT 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize Beatriz Palmer as 
my August Constituent of the Month. As we 
begin another school year, we must continue 
to support and uplift the work of local edu-
cators and community leaders who are going 
above and beyond to help students succeed. 
Palmer is the Program Manager for the 
Service Learning and Volunteer Center at 
MiraCosta College, where she focuses on 
helping students combine their studies with 
community service and civic engagement. Her 
passion for public service is evident in her 
work at the college and the community, where 
she is helping to foster the next generation of 
young people and adults who understand the 
power of civic engagement and giving back to 
their community. 
In addition to her role at the college, Palmer 
serves as the new board president of Oper-
ation HOPE-North County, a shelter for fami-
lies with children and single women experi-
encing homelessness. Operation HOPE-North 
County provides critical wrap-around and case 
management services for families with children 
and single women, and the families who grad-
uate from their program. Prior to her board 
role, Palmer and her family volunteered pre-
paring and purchasing meals for the shelter 
residents, supported the kids program, brought 
others to OHNC, and created fundraisers and 
drives for the shelter. She continues to advo-
cate for housing needs throughout the com-
munity, connecting college students to the or-
ganization for service opportunities, and pro-
viding other support to advance Operation 
HOPE-North County’s vital mission. 
I am incredibly grateful for constituents like 
Palmer who are committed to helping our stu-
dents succeed and growing a generation of 
community members who appreciate the value 
of public service. Our District is brighter be-
cause of her dedication to her students and 
her community. I have no doubt that Palmer 
will continue to inspire future leaders, and I’m 
honored to recognize her as my August Con-
stituent of the Month. 
Representative LEVIN’s Constituent of the 
Month program recognizes outstanding North 
County San Diego and South Orange County 
Residents who have gone above and beyond 
to help their neighbors, give back to their com-
munity, and represent the best of our country. 
Rep. LEVIN’s July Constituent of the Month 
was local reproductive health doctor Dr. 
Pratima Gupta. Rep. LEVIN’s June Constituent 
of the Month was Carlsbad native and 
LGBTQIA+ advocate Kevin Lee. To nominate

RECOGNIZING PAUL WEBSTER FOR 
50 YEARS SERVING WITH HOUS-
ING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize a leading figure in the 
practice of community and economic develop-
ment, Mr. Paul Webster. 
Mr. Webster serves as the Director of the 
Financial Management Division in the Office of 
Community Planning and Development for the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment. Mr. Webster’s commitment to public 
service is unparalleled, his five-decade-long 
career focused on creating resilient commu-
nities, suitable living environments, and eco-
nomic opportunities for low- and moderate-in-
come persons and families. 
Mr. Webster joined the Department in 1972 
and has served as Director since 1983. In this 
role, Mr. Webster oversees the Section 108 
loan guarantee program, a transformational 
program and resource for low-income commu-
nities, including funding for critical economic 
development projects and facilitation of afford-
able housing solutions that would otherwise 
not be possible. 
He spearheaded the expansion of the Sec-
tion 108 program. Over the course of his ca-
reer, Mr. Webster has overseen an unprece-
dented 2,000 loan guarantee commitments 
with a total value close to $10 billion. These 
numbers underscore his work to provide the 
much-needed resources that revitalize Amer-
ican communities and ensure everyone has a 
chance to succeed. 
Mr. Webster also championed legislation 
that established the Economic Development 
Initiative (EDI), which provided grant funds to 
support and enhance the use of Section 108 
loan 
guarantees 
and 
the 
subsequent 
Brownfields EDI to help address environ-
mental cleanup efforts, returning contaminated 
property to sustainable use. His expertise also 
extended to long-term disaster recovery work 
and neighborhood stabilization activities tar-
geted at addressing the effects of abandoned 
and foreclosed housing. 
He is one of the leading experts on financial 
management and is happy to provide guid-
ance and advice to individuals, organizations, 
and federal, state, and local partners for the 
Department. Equally important, Mr. Webster 
has been and continues to be a mentor to the 
next generation of community development 
and financial management professionals, re-
flected in the esteem of his colleagues, staff, 
and external partners. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in honoring this remarkable public 
servant, whose expertise, tenacity, and cre-
ativity in economic and community develop-
ment has helped to transform hundreds of 
communities for the better. Paul Webster has 
tirelessly dedicated himself to making life bet-
ter for countless Americans. I hope his con-
tinuing legacy inspires us all to renew our 
commitments to serving our communities.

RECOGNIZING BARBARA L. 
CHAVEZ 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life and work of 
my constituent, the late BarBara L. Chavez. 
BarBara served our community in a variety of 
ways, including as a Board Member of the 
Fontana Unified School District and member 
of the Planning Commission for the City of Ri-
alto. 
BarBara was devoted to helping others. She 
worked as a teacher’s aide for many years, 
and from 2003 to 2006 served as the first 
Latina President of United Steelworkers Local 
8599, where she represented childcare pro-
viders, substitutes, and college tutors. In 2008, 
BarBara was elected to the Fontana Unified 
School Board where she served for 8 years, 
continuing her service to the children and edu-
cators of her community. 
In 2018, BarBara L. Chavez was selected to 
be a member of the Planning Commission for 
the City of Rialto, where she would go on to 
serve as Vice Chair. Her work on the Planning 
Commission contributed to many projects that 
benefit the city and residents of Rialto and 
continue to play a pivotal role in the economic 
development of our region. 
BarBara shined as the embodiment of gen-
erosity and compassion. As an active parish-
ioner at St. John Catholic Church, she worked 
tirelessly to help those in need throughout Ri-
alto and beyond. 
Sadly, our community is now in mourning. 
On Sunday, August 21st, BarBara tragically 
passed away in a traffic collision. I offer my 
deepest condolences to her friends and family 
on their loss. 
For her outstanding accomplishments and 
her contributions to her community, it is my 
honor to recognize BarBara L. Chavez. Her 
years of civic service and commitment to the 
people of Rialto and Fontana are worthy of the 
highest commendation. May she rest in peace 
and her family find comfort during this time. 
She will be missed.

RECOGNIZING DR. SHETAL SHAH, 
MD, FAAP 
HON. KATHLEEN M. RICE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Miss RICE of New York. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Dr. Shetal Shah, MD, 
FAAP, for his advocacy on the behalf of New 
York’s children and for his many years serving 
as a resource to my office. 
A noted pediatrician, neonatologist, and re-
searcher, Dr. Shah has tirelessly fought to 
protect the well-being of children. He has pro-
moted increased funding for childhood vac-
cinations and children’s hospitals and improv-
ing the Medicaid and CHIP programs to en-
sure children always have access to the care 
they need. He is a voice for his fellow doctors, 
and his efforts will help guarantee that medical 
school graduates continue to pursue careers 
in pediatrics and pediatric subspecialties in un-
derserved communities. 
Dr. Shah has also played a critical role in 
promoting 
public 
health 
throughout 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic by hand-delivering pro-
tective equipment to doctors across Long Is-
land. His determination provided children in 
our communities with the critical care they 
needed. 
In New York, and across the country, we 
are incredibly fortunate to have people like Dr. 
Shah, whose work ensures that our children 
grow into healthy adults. I would like to com-
mend Dr. Shah for his commitment to public 
health and to the children of New York’s 
Fourth Congressional District.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF GERARD ‘‘ROD’’ GAYNOR, JR. 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mourn the loss Gerard ‘‘Rod’’ Gaynor 
Jr, of New London, Connecticut who passed 
away on August 29. 2022, at age 80. Rod was 
a well-respected, virtuous man, whose posi-
tive, lifelong contributions to the City of New 
London were honored by an overwhelming 
turnout from the community at his wake and 
funeral on September 2nd and 3rd. 
Born in 1942 to Gerard and Gemma 
Gaynor, Rod was raised within, grew through, 
and empowered by the City of New London. 
His family upbringing and his deep religious 
faith, drove his passion to serve those around 
him. He gained impactful learning experiences 
from New London’s schools, attending both 
public schools and Saint Joseph’s parochial 
school before earning a college degree from 
Mitchell College, located right in the center of 
the city. 
Upon graduating college, Rod embarked on 
a full-time career within the New London Po-
lice Department, eventually gaining a pro-
motion in his service from officer to detective 
for the force. He had a penchant for purposing 
his sharp sense of loyalty toward creating a 
more effective and safer town, particularly 
through community policing. For example, he 
helped found several programs within the De-
partment, including both the first crime preven-
tion program and scuba diving unit for a town 
that borders the Thames River and Long Is-
land Sound. A level-headed, diligent profes-
sional, Officer Gaynor became the first mem-
ber of the New London Police Department to 
earn the VFW Police Officer of the Year award 
early on in his tenure, one of the innumerable 
commendations he received throughout his 
37–year-long career for committing both his 
heart and mind to the Department. 
Upon his retirement from the force, Rod be-
came all the more active within the City and 
its local institutions. It was no small footnote 
within his life of service that he ran for and 
was elected to the position of city councilor 
before becoming mayor of the City of New 
London. He was an active member of New 
London politics, and as a candidate who has 
been on the ballot in New London a number 
of times, I personally benefitted from his stal-
wart support and advice. 
If you were to ask him, however, one of the 
accomplishments he prided himself in most 
was performing the role of the first full-time, 
permanent Deacon of St. Joseph’s Church. A 
devoted husband, father and grandfather, Rod 
eventually made the difficult decision to move 
from New London to live closer to his family 
in the neighboring town of Waterford. He of 
course remained active within the local com-
munities, maintaining strong ties to the city 
while also becoming elected to Waterford’s 
Representative Town Meeting. 
Madam Speaker, it is nothing short of inspir-
ing when constituents, like Rod, remain as 
loyal and dedicated to giving back to the very 
communities that were so formational in their 
own upbringing. It is a kind of mission that 
speaks a thousand words about one’s char-
acter. Rod dedicated his life in service to the 
People of New London and was known to be 
gentle in every relationship. He will be sorely 
missed by all who knew him, and we remain 
forever grateful that there are so many com-
munity members to carry on his name and 
memory. This includes his wife, Carole, of 
more than 58 years, his four children, 
Maureen, Teresa, Christine, and ‘‘Rod’’ III, 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren as well 
as the greater family. To that end, Madam 
Speaker, it is fitting that my colleagues in the 
House join me in uplifting the memory of Ge-
rard ‘‘Rod’’ Gaynor, Jr.

SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
MARSH FOUNDATION’S 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and celebrate the 100th anniversary 
of the Marsh Foundation. The Marsh Founda-
tion has a remarkable history within Van Wert 
and the surrounding community. Over the last 
100 years, the Foundation has been com-
mitted to its mission of inspiring hope, teach-
ing others, and caring for children and fami-
lies. 
The Marsh Foundation was made possible 
by the family of George and Hilinda Marsh. 
George, Hilinda, and their daughter Katie do-
nated their substantial estate for the purpose 
of helping children and families in need. The 
concept for the Foundation originated when 
George and Hilinda were traveling through 
Van Wert on their way home from Fort 
Wayne, Indiana when they noticed two small 
boys huddled together in a dark doorway. 
Their mother was working that evening, so the 
boys had to wait during the winter night for her 
to finish. The sight of the cold, young boys 
drove the compassionate Marshs to use their 
resources to help those in need. 
Through his will, George Marsh created a 
foundation to benefit youth in the area. His will 
provided $5,000,000 for the establishment of 
the Foundation. During the last 100 years, the 
Marsh Foundation has provided many services 
including: on-campus group homes for boys 
ages ten to seventeen, a specialized residen-
tial program for male juvenile sex offenders, a 
strong network of foster homes, clinical serv-
ices, an on-campus school for youth in care, 
and a full-time activities program for youth. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to the Marsh 
Foundation and its staff, past and present, on 
this remarkable occasion. By celebrating the 
one hundredth anniversary, community mem-
bers and Ohio residents recognize the con-
tribution of the Foundation to our region and 
community. Congratulations to the Marsh 
Foundation on this significant milestone.

COMMENDING JOAN W. SACAROB 
AND DONALD A. SACAROB 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the lifetime of service that Joan and 
Donald Sacarob have dedicated to Hadassah, 
a non-profit organization that seeks to expand 
women’s rights and their leadership capacity. 
Hadassah embodies Jewish values to ad-
vance health equity, fight antisemitism, and 
equip women with the tools they need to make 
a difference in their communities. 
Hadassah’s mission is to provide education, 
advocacy, and youth development opportuni-
ties to enhance the lives of those in their com-
munity. Their work extends to the Hadassah 
Medical Organization to research cutting-edge 
medical procedures and provide first-rate care 
for those who need it. To these ends, they 
connect and empower Jewish women to lead 
by example. 
The organization traces its origins back to 
the extraordinary public service of Henrietta 
Szold, who dedicated her life to ameliorating 
disease and starvation that were dispropor-
tionately affecting Jewish people. She founded 
youth villages to house Jewish children who 
fled their homelands as Nazi troops invaded 
Eastern Europe. Her legacy of care has rip-
pled outward for over a century. Hadassah 
was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize nomination 
for their work to offer world-class medical care 
to all, regardless of race, ethnicity, or national 
origin, following their commitment to building a 
bridge to peace through medicine. 
For 50 consecutive years, Joan Sacarob 
has served Hadassah with national portfolios 
focused on advocacy and philanthropy. Her 
husband Donald has served as the National 
Associate Vice President of Hadassah, the

men’s branch of the organization. For dec-
ades, these two hardworking philanthropists 
and activists have committed themselves to 
the betterment of the Northern Virginia and 
Greater Washington Metropolitan Area Jewish 
communities. 
Joan was a pivotal figure in the develop-
ment of the Jewish Community Center of 
Northern Virginia, and her friends and col-
leagues recognize her as a passionate and re-
silient force. She served for 20 years on the 
Jewish Community Relations Council of Great-
er Washington and was honored for her distin-
guished service on the board in 2006. Her ad-
vocacy work has not dwindled since then, and 
I am honored to know such a fierce advocate 
for equity. 
Joan and Donald have earned the respect 
and recognition of their peers. Their work has 
been instrumental in advancing the causes of 
health equity, women’s leadership, and access 
to much needed resources. I wish them every 
success and comfort as they continue their 
work. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Joan and Donald Sacarob 
for their exceptional dedication and leadership 
within our community.

HONORING THE GEORGE L. 
ALTAMURA 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Hands Across 
the Valley President and Founder, George 
Altamura, upon the creation of the George L. 
Altamura Endowment. Mr. Altamura has dedi-
cated his life to serving others, choosing to 
focus on preventing his fellow citizens from 
going hungry by creating programs that offer 
food resources. 
Mr. Altamura was born in 1934 in Buffalo, 
New York, and came to live in the Napa Val-
ley in the 1940s. He began a successful ca-
reer in real estate after owning both a dry- 
cleaning business and a restaurant. Commu-
nity 
service 
became 
a 
priority 
in 
Mr. 
Altamura’s life, starting largely with food inse-
curity prevention. 
This all started with the cancellation of an 
annual food fundraising event. Mr. Altamura 
acted quickly in inviting Francis Coppola, 
Johnny Miller, Steve Young, and me to help 
him serve food at his restaurant, in the Napa 
Valley, instead. Our team was able to serve 
over 300 people and raise more than $30,000, 
making Mr. Altamura’s efforts profoundly suc-
cessful. 
This event inspired Mr. Altamura, along with 
other leaders in our community, to come to-
gether ‘‘to do something about the hunger in 
Napa Valley.’’ Learning that hundreds of peo-
ple in Napa County went hungry on a daily 
basis, Mr. Altamura founded Hands Across the 
Valley, an annual event which raises funds for 
the Napa Valley Food Bank, Meals on 
Wheels, the Salvation Army, and The Table. 
Since its founding in 1994, Hands Across 
the Valley has raised over $2 million to help 
benefit Napa Valley’s Safety Net Food pro-
grams. In addition to providing much needed 
funding to these services, Hands Across the 
Valley helps the Food Bank, Catholic Char-
ities, The Table and American Canyon Family 
Resource Center provide holiday turkeys and 
food baskets each year. 
In honor of over 30 years of service, Hands 
Across the Valley has established the George 
L. Altamura Endowment to permanently aid in 
the fight against hunger in Napa Valley. The 
Endowment will supply safety net food pro-
grams in Napa Valley with long-term financial 
support. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Mr. 
Altamura has worked endlessly to help the 
fight against hunger in our community. There-
fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor him 
here today.

ANGELS IN ADOPTION 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Amber Richardson who has recently 
been nominated for the Angels of Adoption 
Award. Historically, the Angels of Adoption 
program has celebrated individuals, couples, 
families, and organizations from across the 
nation who have made an extraordinary con-
tribution on behalf of vulnerable children and 
families. Those recognized through Angels of 
Adoption represent a wide variety of individ-
uals involved in the adoption, foster care, and 
the child welfare world. I am proud to nomi-
nate Amber for this award as she is the found-
er and CEO of Foster Love and has fostered 
14 different children over her lifetime. 
In June 2020, Amber Richardson Founded 
Foster Love, an official 501c3 within my dis-
trict in Omaha, that has made an extraordinary 
impact on the lives of foster children within our 
community since its creation. Their mission is 
to provide basic needs and opportunities for 
children in foster care, so they feel confident, 
empowered, and valued, and foster families 
feel supported. They have done this by open-
ing a storefront boutique in which foster chil-
dren can shop the latest trends in a wel-
coming, unique setting where merchandise is 
new, high quality, and free of cost. The store 
front offers multiple programs each month 
such as shopping days, appointments for 
emergency needs, and an art program called 
Artsy Kids. 
Amber and her husband, Matthew, have 
fostered 14 different children. Starting in 2007 
they welcomed Trevor, their first foster child, 
into their home and later adopted him in order 
to give him a ‘‘forever home’’. This was the 
spark that led Amber to continue developing 
relationships within the foster community as 
well as volunteering and advocating on dif-
ferent foster panels. Amber has been a driving 
force within the Omaha foster care community; 
her drive and passion for this cause has been 
truly inspiring. 
Through Foster Love, Amber has built a vi-
brant community that helps support both foster 
children and their families. To date, Foster 
Love has served and supported over 800 chil-
dren and foster parents, their work continues 
to expand and grow. Not only are these chil-
dren provided with the necessary resources 
that they need to thrive on a daily basis, but 
they are also loved every step of the way. 
Foster Love exemplifies love and dignity, and 
I could not be happier to recognize Amber 
Richardson for the Angels of Adoption Award. 
I salute and thank Amber for her impression 
upon the Omaha community, which will be felt 
for years to come.

ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE NEW YORK STATE 
MILITARY 
OFFICERS 
ASSOCIA-
TION OF AMERICA COUNCIL OF 
CHAPTERS 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the 
New York State Military Officers Association of 
America (MOAA) Council of Chapters. The 
New York State MOAA Council has worked 
hard to bring New York State’s chapters to-
gether since its charter in 1972 and is now the 
only state council to have held fifty consecu-
tive conventions. It is my honor to recognize 
the dedication of New York State’s chapters to 
MOAA’s mission as they celebrate this incred-
ible achievement in New York’s 21st District. 
Since 1972, the New York State MOAA 
Council has worked hard to promote the 
‘‘Never Stop Serving’’ motto of MOAA. In 
1970, Lt. Col. Leslie Reichardt, United State 
Air Force (Ret.) led the New York MOAA 
Chapters in uniting to create a Council of 
Chapters. The Council was chartered on Octo-
ber 7, 1972 with the goal of promoting cama-
raderie and selfless service among its mem-
bers. 
MOAA works to bring the voices of all mili-
tary officers to the highest levels of govern-
ment through leading the charge on fighting 
for fair compensation and benefits for all mem-
bers of the military community. The New York 
State MOAA Council fosters relationships 
among military officers at every stage of their 
career, so they can work together to protect 
the rights and interests of officers and their 
families. This work has led them to be the top 
ranked association in advocating for all mem-
bers of the uniformed services for 15 years. 
Not only do member chapters work for the 
military community, they also are active within 
their communities and support a wide variety 
of service member organizations. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want 
to congratulate the New York State MOAA 
Chapter of Councils on 50 years of loyal serv-
ice to our military officers. And I want to thank 
all of you and your families for selflessly dedi-
cating your lives to our Nation’s armed serv-
ices. I thank them for their service.

RECOGNIZING LEILANI CAAMAL 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022

become a tackle football star and wrestling 
standout.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

September 9, 2022 
Since she was nine years old, Leilani has 
tackled the stereotype that girls can’t and don’t 
play football. Leilani put on shoulder pads and 
a helmet to play tackle football like her broth-
er. In the past two years, she’s emerged as an 
All-American linebacker for the Mile High 
Blaze, a women’s semi-pro tackle football 
team that is a part of the Women’s Football 
Alliance. 
Leilani represents the future of women’s 
tackle football as it continues to grow in popu-
larity. She’s currently a linebacker on the Vista 
Peak High School boys varsity football team 
working to be a leader and role model for 
young girls both on and off the field. Like the 
trailblazers who paved the way before her, 
Leilani wants to inspire girls and young 
women by demonstrating the opportunities 
and choices available to them. 
Leilani not only excels on the football field, 
but is also leading the way in the growth of 
women’s wrestling across the country. With 
big Olympic and gold medal aspirations, I 
have no doubt Leilani’s courage and persever-
ance will bring her success whether it’s in 
football or wrestling. 
Young women like Leilani represent the fu-
ture of tackle football and women’s sports— 
fostering and promoting an accepting environ-
ment for young women and girls to pursue 
their athletic goals. Leilani motivates and in-
spires not only her peers, but the next genera-
tion of young female athletes who have their 
eyes on male-dominated sports. I am proud to 
recognize Leilani for her athletic successes 
and thank her for her relentless pursuit fighting 
for an inclusive environment for women in 
sports. 
RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE NATIONAL ACTIVE 
AND 
RETIRED 
FEDERAL 
EM-
PLOYEES DULLES CHAPTER 1241 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 9, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate the National Active and Retired 
Federal Employees (NARFE) Dulles Chapter 
1241 on its 50th anniversary. The Northern 
Virginia region is home to tens of thousands of 
federal employees and many retirees who 
have chosen to stay in the region. Throughout 
their careers, these dedicated civil servants 
have given their time and effort to serve their 
fellow Americans, and NARFE has consist-
ently provided them with coordinated support. 
Founded in 1921, NARFE is a nonpartisan 
organization dedicated to protecting and en-
hancing the earned pay, retirement, and 
health care benefits of federal employees and 
retirees as well as their spouses and sur-
vivors. Dulles Chapter 1241 is one of more 
than 1600 NARFE chapters nationwide. 
The Charter for Chapter 1241 was issued 
June 21, 1972. At that time, there were nine 
members. Today, the Chapter membership 
has grown to approximately 350 members with 
another 400 national members in the Dulles 
jurisdiction. Chapter members have had a 
strong voice in many national and local legis-
lative issues affecting federal retirees, senior 
citizens, and the public at large. In 2015, fol-
lowing the dissolution of the Leesburg Chap-
ter, the Dulles Chapter welcomed many of 
these federal employees and retirees into their 
ranks with open arms. Chapter 1241 has 
worked from their founding to represent fed-
eral employees, but also to better their com-
munity. 
This chapter has supported Alzheimer’s re-
search for many years through regular draw-
ings, the ‘‘Red Pot’’ for monthly donations, and 
the Alzheimer’s Christmas Challenge. Addi-
tionally, the Dulles chapter has sponsored 
several food drives for Fairfax County food 
pantries, collecting resources for those who 
have been hit the hardest by misfortune. 
Throughout the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, 
the Dulles Chapter has seen its share of hard-
ship, but these federal employees have still 
banded together to ensure that everyone’s 
needs are met. 
Over the years, members have also partici-
pated in health and community fairs, auto 
shows, and other outreach activities. Addition-
ally, many members have been active leaders 
in the Virginia Federation of NARFE. These 
accomplished federal employees have earned 
the attention and praise of numerous bodies, 
from Virginia state legislators to NARFE na-
tional leaders, as well as travel, medical, in-
surance, tax, and law enforcement experts. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating the National Active and 
Retired Federal Employees Dulles Chapter 
1241 for 50 years of dedicated service to 
Northern Virginia’s federal employees. These 
individuals are the lifeblood of our federal gov-
ernment, and I am grateful for their service 
and proud to represent such outstanding indi-
viduals. I wish them the best for their anniver-
sary, and continued success in future endeav-
ors.
