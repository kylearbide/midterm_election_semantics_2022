Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 16, 2020 
No. 10 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. CUELLAR).

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
January 16, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY 
CUELLAR to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Gracious and merciful God, we give 
You thanks for giving us another day. 
The House prepares to recess for a 
week of constituent visitation in home 
districts as the Nation anticipates the 
Martin Luther King long weekend. 
As we remember the heroic struggle 
of the civil rights movement, the 
‘‘badges and incidents of slavery’’ have 
perdured through policies still opera-
tive today, though recently being ad-
dressed through efforts at criminal jus-
tice reform and sentencing reform. 
The pains of racism, like a national 
genetic defect, plague us still, though 
so many wish it were not so. Lord, have 
mercy on us. 
Bless those who have been elected to 
secure laws protecting and expanding 
our cherished freedoms with the wis-
dom and vision to root out all traces of 
involuntary servitude in our Nation, 
most notably in human trafficking in 
our own time, so might we be able to 
declare with pride we are the land of 
the free. 
May we, as Americans, do our part to 
find the image and likeness of God in 
those of different race or ancestral 
country of origin. 
May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

Chair has examined the Journal of the 
last day’s proceedings and announces 
to the House his approval thereof. 
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved. 
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a 
vote on agreeing to the Speaker’s ap-
proval of the Journal. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the Speaker’s approval 
of the Journal. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, I

The point of no quorum is considered 
withdrawn. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE

gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. CHABOT led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE

HONORING RAYMOND LERMA 
(Mr. COX of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of Raymond Lerma, 
a beloved husband, father, and leader 
in the community of Corcoran, Cali-
fornia. Ray passed away on January 11. 
Among his many honored roles in 
life, Ray served 25 years as mayor and 
councilman in Corcoran, California. He 
was a pillar of the community. 
Ray was born in El Paso, Texas, and 
raised in Corcoran in a large and loving 
family that proudly farmed the crops 
of the Central Valley. Encouraged by 
his parents to reach for higher edu-
cation, Mr. Lerma graduated from UC 
Berkeley. He was a proud Cal Bear. 
After college, Ray returned to the 
community that raised him to build his 
own family with his beloved wife, Lola. 
He touched countless lives in his 38 
years as an educator at Corcoran High. 
After retirement, he kept changing 
lives, teaching English as a second lan-
guage to adult learners. Ray also 
served as a longtime board member of 
the King’s Community Action Organi-
zation, which helps to bring resources 
to the Central Valley. 
Ray once said he wanted to be re-
membered as someone who made a dif-
ference in his community. I stand be-
fore you today to say he will always be 
remembered for his dedication and con-
tributions to his community. We will 
miss his leadership. 
Ray leaves behind his wife, Lola; 
their three children, Eva, Ramon, and 
Pablo; as well as his grandchildren. 
May he rest in peace.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H304 
January 16, 2020 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JIMMY 
PATRONIS, SR. 
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Jimmy Patronis, Sr., a local 
legend in Bay County, Florida, where 
he recently passed away at the age of 
88. 
Mr. Patronis truly lived a life in full, 
one of family, entrepreneurship, and of 
service to our community. 
He served as a captain in the United 
States Air Force and then moved to 
Panama City in 1953 to join in the res-
taurant business with his brother, 
Johnny Patronis. 
The brothers purchased Captain An-
derson’s, which has been in his family’s 
ownership ever since and has become a 
favorite spot for people who are vis-
iting Panama City. 
From a very young age, Jimmy had 
an unwavering desire to serve others 
and make the world a better place. He 
had an enormous staff, and he treated 
all of them like family. 
He leaves behind the love of his life, 
Helen, and four sons: Theo, Yonnie, 
Nick, and the current Florida chief fi-
nancial officer and friend of mine, 
Jimmy, Jr. 
Jimmy Patronis will be sorely missed 
by many. May he rest in peace. 
f 
HONORING DR. MARTIN LUTHER 
KING, JR. 
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the late, great Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. 
On June 23, 1963, in my hometown of 
Detroit, 
Michigan, 
Martin 
Luther 
King, Jr., delivered an impassioned pre-
cursor to his ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ speech 
during the historic Detroit Walk to 
Freedom, which recognized the 20th an-
niversary of the Detroit race riots. 
With over 120,000 people present, the 
Detroit Walk to Freedom was the larg-
est civil rights demonstration in the 
Nation’s history. Of course, we all 
know that soon changed just a few 
weeks later with the March on Wash-
ington. 
As a young Black girl growing up on 
the east side of Detroit, Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., was more than just a 
public figure; he was our hope. Today, 
I am honored to have the chance to 
recognize him and his work and will 
continue to do my part to ensure his 
legacy lives on. 
And in today’s environment, here in 
Washington, D.C., and this Congress, 
we must refocus on the ability to rec-
ognize every person based on their 
character, their skills and abilities, 
and not based on race. 
RECOGNIZING BRADEN ZUKOWSKI 
ON HIS APPOINTMENT TO THE 
U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-
late Braden Zukowski of Saxonburg, 
Pennsylvania. Braden is a high school 
senior at Knoch High School. He is the 
son of Brad Zukowski and Shauna 
Braun-Zukowski. 
I am pleased to announce that 
Braden recently accepted a fully quali-
fied appointment to the United States 
Naval Academy in Annapolis, Mary-
land. 
Braden is a shining example of what 
leadership looks like. His hard work 
and dedication to excellence in and out 
of the classroom are the qualities that 
will make him a great midshipman. I 
am confident that he will continue to 
excel during his time at the Naval 
Academy. 
Not only is Braden a leader in the 
classroom, he has also excelled in 
sports, serving as captain of the Knoch 
High School swim and cross country 
teams. He is also an active member of 
the chemistry, Spanish, history, and 
robotics clubs, as well as a National 
Honor Society member. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud Braden’s deci-
sion to join our Nation’s Armed Forces, 
and I wish him the best of luck in his 
new venture. 
f 
FACING A TIME OF NEED FOR THE 
PEOPLE OF PUERTO RICO 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of over 3 million of our fellow 
Americans who are facing a time of 
need right now, the people of Puerto 
Rico. 
Several of my colleagues have been 
working tirelessly to convey the voices 
of the people of Puerto Rico following 
the earthquakes that they have been 
experiencing over the past several 
weeks. Those voices must be more 
widely heard in the media and across 
our society because our fellow Ameri-
cans are calling out for help. 
The damage caused by this most re-
cent disaster comes in addition to the 
devastation of Hurricane Maria and the 
grossly inadequate Federal response to 
that tragedy. 
Today, the administration confirmed 
that it would finally end its hold on 
disaster aid relief that Congress au-
thorized for Puerto Rico years ago. 
Now, in the wake of this most recent 
tragedy, the President must approve a 
major disaster declaration today. 
Constituents across my community 
have reached out to me with deep con-
cern for their friends and families, and 
nearly all of us represent constituents 
of Puerto Rican origin. We cannot turn 
our backs on our fellow citizens. We 
must stand with them and come to 
their aid. 
f 
CONGRATULATING COACH PAT 
MCLAUGHLIN 
(Mr. CHABOT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
congratulate 
Coach 
Pat 
McLaughlin, the head football coach at 
my alma mater, La Salle High School, 
for a significant accomplishment. 
I played for La Salle back in the day, 
and my brother, Dave, played 10 years 
later. 
Coach McLaughlin has been nomi-
nated for the NFL’s Don Shula High 
School Coach of the Year award. This 
prestigious honor recognizes the best 
high school football coaches across the 
country for their character, integrity, 
leadership, dedication to the commu-
nity, commitment to player protec-
tion, and on-field success. 
In December, Coach McLaughlin led 
the La Salle Lancers to their fourth 
Ohio Division II football championship 
in the last 6 years. As this nomination 
affirms, he has been a leader both on 
and off the field. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Coach 
McLaughlin, as well as all the La Salle 
players and their families and everyone 
involved in the Lancer football pro-
gram. They have all made, and con-
tinue to make, the entire Cincinnati 
community tremendously proud. 
Lancers Roll Deep. 
f 
SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE SLOW 
IMPEACHMENT PROCESS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to shed some light on how slow 
this urgent impeachment process real-
ly unfolded. 
The missile crawler-transporter used 
to transfer the NASA spacecraft to the 
launch pad travels at a rate of about 
5,000 feet per hour. The slowest animal 
on Earth, the three-toed sloth, can 
travel at a speed of 792 feet per hour. 
The California banana slug can travel 
at 240 feet per hour, amazingly enough. 
It is approximately 610 feet from the 
House desk to the Senate desk. It took 
28 days for Speaker PELOSI to send the 
articles to the Senate at a rate of 
about 11 inches per hour. 
Mr. Speaker, House Democrats never 
thought this was an urgent matter of 
national security, as was stated. Ur-
gent matters don’t move at 11 inches 
per hour. Indeed, there was time to use 
about a dozen different souvenir pens 
to sign the document one letter at a 
time yesterday. 
The dishonesty, the misdirection of 
House Democrats surrounding this im-
peachment process—well, the Amer-
ican public has had 28-plus days to fig-
ure this out.

Thankfully, the Senate is going to

CONGRATULATING 
SAN 
JACINTO 
COLLEGE 
CHANCELLOR 
DR. 
BRENDA HELLYER 
(Mr. BABIN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate 
San 
Jacinto 
College 
Chancellor Dr. Brenda Hellyer on re-
ceiving the prestigious Quasar Award 
for Economic Development Excellence 
from the Bay Area Houston Economic 
Partnership. 
This award is given to an outstanding 
individual who has demonstrated a 
strong and continual effort to support 
the business foundations of the Greater 
Bay Area Houston communities. 
Dr. Hellyer is highly educated, earn-
ing her master’s degree in business ad-
ministration and a doctorate in com-
munity college leadership from the 
University of Texas at Austin, where 
she received the Distinguished Grad-
uate Award. She is also a certified pub-
lic accountant. 
In 2009, Dr. Hellyer was named chan-
cellor of San Jacinto College and has 
since transformed the school with 
major renovations and the develop-
ment of many award-winning pro-
grams. 
Mr. Speaker, 1 minute is just simply 
not enough time to properly congratu-
late Dr. Hellyer, and I will submit an 
extension of my remarks for the 
RECORD.

PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
DISAPPROVAL 
OF 
RULE 
SUB-
MITTED 
BY 
DEPARTMENT 
OF 
EDUCATION RELATING TO ‘‘BOR-
ROWER 
DEFENSE 
INSTITU-
TIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY’’ 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to House Resolution 790, I 
call up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 
76) providing for congressional dis-
approval under chapter 8 of title 5, 
United States Code, of the rule sub-
mitted by the Department of Edu-
cation relating to ‘‘Borrower Defense 
Institutional Accountability’’, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The Clerk read the title of the joint 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 790, the joint 
resolution is considered read. 
The text of the joint resolution is as 
follows: 
H.J. RES. 76 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress 
assembled, 
That 
Congress 
dis-
approves the rule submitted by the Depart-
ment of Education relating to ‘‘Borrower De-
fense Institutional Accountability’’ (84 Fed. 
Reg. 49788 (September 23, 2019)), and such 
rule shall have no force or effect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
joint resolution shall be debatable for 1 
hour, equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Education and 
Labor. 
The gentlewoman from Nevada (Mrs. 
LEE) and the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each will control 
30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Nevada. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to insert extraneous mate-
rial on H.J. Res. 76. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am here today for one 
reason: to ask that my colleagues in 
this House stand with me to make 
clear to the American people that we 
care more about defending students 
than enriching predatory schools. That 
is what my joint resolution, H.J. Res. 
76, is all about. 
In 1992 Congress added a rule known 
as borrower defense to the Higher Edu-
cation Act to give students a legal 
right to seek forgiveness on their Fed-
eral student loans because of fraud by 
their schools. 
Predatory school misconduct in the 
eighties was so rampant it was pain-
fully clear to Democrats, Republicans, 
and everyone in between that we need 
protections in place for students who 
are scammed and cheated by their in-
stitution, and that is just as true 
today. 
Corinthian Colleges, ITT Tech, Uni-
versity of Phoenix, and Dream Center— 
350,000 students have filed claims alleg-
ing they were defrauded by these 
schools. They were lied to about the 
job prospects they would get from 
these schools, they were lied to about 
the transferability of their credits, and 
they were lied to about the quality of 
education they would receive. The only 
thing they got was a useless degree and 
a mountain of debt after these schools 
abruptly closed because of rampant 
misconduct. 
The most painful part is that these 
are mostly students from low-income 
communities, people of color, and vet-
erans. These are Americans we should 
be standing up for, not taking advan-
tage of. 
In 2016 the last administration cre-
ated a new borrower defense rule to 
streamline the process to help these 
students. 
It sounds pretty good, right? 
Not to Betsy DeVos. She then re-
wrote the borrower defense rule to 
make it almost impossible for a de-
frauded student to get relief on their 
student loans. Even in cases where 
schools clearly violated the law, the 
burden of proof on the defrauded stu-
dent is so absurdly unrealistic that a 
student would need to hire a team of 
lawyers to have a shot at proving in-
tent and misconduct from the school. 
But the point made by proponents of 
this borrower defense rule that is most 
insulting is that the new rule saves 
taxpayer dollars. That is simply false. 
The new rule severely weakens the 
early warning system that ensures 
predatory schools, not taxpayers, cover 
the cost of debt relief. As a result in 
the few cases where relief is rewarded 
under the DeVos rule, taxpayers will be 
the ones to foot the bill. Beyond that, 
the only reason you can say that this 
rule actually saves money is because 
we are denying relief to every legiti-
mately defrauded student. 
Let me be clear: if Betty DeVos’ 2019 
borrower defense rule goes into effect, 
more students will become victims of 
fraud with no way to climb out of the 
hole that our government dug for 
them. 
This puts my colleagues in Congress 
on the record. Members have a choice 
to make, and if they choose to vote 
against this resolution, then they will 
have to go back home and tell thou-
sands of students, veterans, and their 
constituents in their district that they 
choose to be on the side of predatory 
schools over them. 
I think the choice is clear. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.J. Res. 76, the latest attempt 
by House Democrats to undermine the 
Trump administration. It seems these 
attempts will never end. 
Specifically, the resolution would 
undo the Education Department’s ef-
forts to assist students who have been 
defrauded by colleges and universities 
while also protecting taxpayer inter-
est. 
Any school that has taken advantage 
of students must be held accountable. 
Students who have been lied to and suf-
fered financial harm are entitled to re-
lief and forgiveness. We can and should 
have bipartisan agreement on these 
points. 
Sadly, Democrats have a long track 
record of pursuing radical ideological 
objectives at the expense of taxpayers, 
students, and schools. Today it is clear 
that my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are more interested in tearing 
down the Trump administration than 
providing real solutions. 
Before I touch upon the advantages 
of the Trump administration’s new 
rule, I would like to provide some con-
text on the previous administration’s

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H306 
January 16, 2020 
so-called borrower defense rule and its 
many shortcomings. 
The Obama administration’s over-
zealous political actions created a dan-
gerous domino effect. In 2016, during 
the final months of his Presidency, 
President Obama implemented a bor-
rower defense regulation that was irre-
sponsible, 
drastically 
exceeded 
the 
scope of current practice, and came 
with the shocking price tag for the 
American taxpayer of $42 billion. 
The Obama regulations blurred the 
line between fraud and inadvertent 
mistakes made by schools. The dif-
ference between the two is critical, Mr. 
Speaker, because the Education De-
partment can levy significant financial 
penalties on institutions found to en-
gage in fraud which can cause a school 
to have to close despite no intentional 
wrongdoing. Most schools do not have 
a reckless disregard for the truth. 
With this flawed rule in place, many 
schools could face harsh financial pen-
alties forcing them to close leaving 
millions of students without access to 
their higher education opportunity. In 
fact, several historically Black colleges 
and universities, HBCUs, wrote to 
President 
Obama’s 
Education 
Sec-
retary John King, Jr., with concerns 
about Obama’s defense rule. Their let-
ter stated: 
In fact, the proposed regulation language 
could undermine the financial viability of a 
number of academic institutions and could 
possibly bankrupt less financially secured 
colleges and universities. 
In the end, the Obama regulations 
created more chaos than clarity and 
encouraged tens of thousands of bor-
rowers, whether they were harmed or 
not, to apply to have their loans for-
given. This was nothing more than a 
political move by the left to provide a 
backdoor scheme to hand out free edu-
cation. So it is not surprising that 
claim filings for loan forgiveness went 
from 59 in the first 20 years to roughly 
300,000 claims submitted in the last 5 
years. 
President Trump realized quickly 
that placing a $42 billion burden on the 
backs of taxpayers was not the answer, 
and his administration made it a pri-
ority to halt the Obama-era regulation 
from going into effect. The Trump ad-
ministration worked to instill some 
common sense into the rulemaking 
process. 
As a result, the administration pro-
duced a rule with clearer standards for 
borrower defense and increased trans-
parency for both students and institu-
tions. 
Among other benefits, the new rule 
makes sure students who have been 
lied to and suffered financial harm re-
ceive relief; reduces the cost of the 2016 
Obama-era regulation by $11 billion be-
cause it helps students complete their 
education rather than indiscriminately 
closing schools; holds all institutions, 
not just for-profit colleges, account-
able for misrepresentation instead of 
picking winners and losers at consider-
able cost to taxpayers; ensures due 
process for all parties; extends the 
look-back window to qualify for closed 
school loan discharges from 120 to 180 
days, so when schools close more stu-
dents are eligible for forgiveness; and 
allows for arbitration which could re-
sult in borrowers’ recovering resources 
not provided by the Education Depart-
ment such as cash payments or other 
expenses. 
The bottom line is this: the Trump 
administration’s borrower defense rule 
protects student borrowers, holds all 
higher education institutions account-
able, and saves taxpayers $11 billion. 
The American people sent us to 
Washington to work together and solve 
important 
issues. 
Our 
constituents 
would be far better served if the Demo-
crat majority used its time to find real 
solutions to our Nation’s issues instead 
of continuing to lament the 2016 elec-
tion results. 
Republicans stand ready to provide 
relief to students who have been 
harmed by fraud, and the borrower de-
fense rules issued by the Trump admin-
istration are the answer. 
I encourage my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to do away with 
the political blame game so we can 
move forward and work in a bipartisan 
manner to address issues facing Amer-
ica. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly recommend a 
‘‘no’’ vote on H.J. Res. 76, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. DAVIS). 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-
er, when a college makes promises to 
recruit students, we expect those prom-
ises to be met. Yet time after time we 
see colleges closing or losing accredita-
tion, 
leaving 
their 
students 
with 
worthless degrees. 
There are currently 240,000 defrauded 
students waiting for loan relief, and 
more than 40,000 of these students are 
from my home State of California. 
These 
defrauded 
student 
borrowers 
have been needlessly waiting—many 
for over a year—to obtain this student 
loan relief. 
The most inexcusable part of this sit-
uation is that the Department of Edu-
cation, during all this time, could have 
brought relief to these students using 
the original borrower defense rule. 
Instead, this administration has de-
cided to create an entirely worthless 
rule that, firstly, does almost nothing 
to help borrowers. Further, it provides 
clear preference to the very sham col-
leges that are compromising the integ-
rity and the purpose of the original 
borrower defense rule. 
This recent rule is sending a message 
to the American public that any 
scammer can open up a school, collect 
money, 
defraud 
our 
students, 
and 
dodge any consequences. 
It is outrageous to learn about the 
hundreds of servicemen and -women 
who have tried to improve their profes-
sional standings by enrolling in one of 
these programs only to end up with a 
pointless credential and a lot of uncon-
scionable debt. In these tragic cases, 
many have not only expended their GI 
Bill funding for good but have also lost 
years of their lives working hard and 
studying to gain these futile degrees. 
The original borrower defense rule 
was an honest attempt to address these 
grievances and give students their dig-
nity back. Rather, we have here today 
a new rule that makes it nearly impos-
sible for students to truly regain what 
has been lost due to this large-scale 
con job. 
Mr. Speaker, why are we making it 
harder for our defrauded students to re-
cover their lives? 
Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us 
today is the first step toward blocking 
these flawed and misguided changes to 
the borrower defense rule from taking 
effect, and I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this resolution.

Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.J. Res. 76, certainly not be-
cause I want to defraud students, cer-
tainly not because I want to protect 
scam education institutions—not at 
all. 
The Department of Education re-
leased an updated and improved bor-
rower defense rule last year for all the 
opposite reasons, to, in fact, protect 
students and protect quality education 
and promote that but also to protect 
the taxpayer. It did all of the above. 
I think we need to keep that in mind 
and not just spend our time on mes-
saging. We want to have results that 
produce quality education opportuni-
ties for the future. 
The 2016 Obama administration rule 
was a broad, sweeping, reactionary 
measure, sadly, to an issue that re-
quires a more nuanced solution that 
will have results. 
Defrauded students who have been fi-
nancially harmed deserve relief, abso-
lutely. The Department’s 2019 rule es-
tablishes a fair process in which these 
students will get the relief they de-
serve. 
A point of personal privilege, Mr. 
Speaker. I hearken back to the hearing 
we had with Secretary DeVos. I was 
embarrassed for the first time, really, 
in the many years I have been on this 
committee to hear someone who has 
spent her adult life promoting edu-
cation maligned in that way. I would 
challenge any of our committee mem-
bers, myself included, to exhibit the 
number of years, talent, and treasure 
put toward enhancing opportunities for 
schools and education, and, by the way, 
the students and success that we have 
seen. I think that the success that the 
President saw in this Secretary of Edu-
cation was why she was put there. 
This rule that is in place right now, 
which we are debating today to try to

change, is a rule that will enhance edu-
cation as well as protect the taxpayers. 
When Secretary DeVos was before 
our committee last month, she ex-
plained how the Department is also 
taking proactive measures to prevent 
fraud from occurring through more 
transparency for students on the Col-
lege Scorecard. 
Under 
the 
2019 
rule, 
predatory 
schools were held accountable for mis-
representations leading to financial 
harm to students. This rule also lays 
out a transparent framework that 
guarantees the process while estab-
lishing a proportional connection be-
tween financial harm and the amount 
awarded. 
Hard-earned taxpayer dollars should 
be used responsibly. I think we will all 
agree to that. This 2019 rule respects 
the taxpayer while also allowing appro-
priate relief for defrauded students and 
setting an example for institutions 
that we will not accept what has gone 
on. 
Mr. Speaker, I end by saying this: I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ today 
to keep a responsible system that pro-
tects defrauded students. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of this joint 
resolution, and I congratulate the gen-
tlewoman from Nevada for her leader-
ship on this issue. 
Secretary DeVos and this adminis-
tration have proven that they will go 
to the ends of the Earth to defend pred-
atory for-profit colleges at the expense 
of our students and taxpayers. 
This holds true for the DeVos bor-
rower defense rule, which creates un-
necessary obstacles for students seek-
ing debt relief from predatory for-prof-
it colleges. It even punishes students 
with approved claims by allowing these 
colleges to deny students their tran-
scripts and refuse to verify their 
earned credits. 
Passing this joint resolution is a cru-
cial step, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. But we also must build on 
this work by bringing our Higher Edu-
cation Act reauthorization to the floor. 
Next up, we have to pass the College 
Affordability Act with even stronger 
protections for American students. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to add a personal 
note. From 2007 to 2011, I ran the work-
force system of the State of Michigan. 
In those years, fraudulent, for-profit 
higher education programs emerged as 
a major problem in Michigan and in 
our Nation. As a former State program 
director, I can tell you that our States 
do not have the resources or the au-
thority to remedy this problem. The 
Federal Government must act. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from Mr. Johnny Taylor at the 
Society for Human Resource Manage-
ment, SHRM. 
SOCIETY FOR HUMAN RESOURCE 
MANAGEMENT, 
Alexandria, VA, January 15, 2020. 
Hon. SUSAN DAVIS, 
Chairman, U.S. House Education Subcommittee 
on Higher Education and Workforce Invest-
ment, Washington, DC. 
Hon. LLOYD SMUCKER, 
Ranking Member, U.S. House Education Sub-
committee on Higher Education and Work-
force Investment, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DAVIS AND RANKING MEM-
BER SMUCKER: Every new rule comes with the 
risk of unintended negative impact even 
when the best of intentions exists on both 
sides. This is particularly prevalent in high-
er education—a space I know well following 
seven years as the President and CEO of the 
Thurgood Marshall College Fund and having 
served as a Trustee for the University of 
Miami, Drake University and the Cooper 
Union. It is with this lens and my current 
lens as President and CEO of the Society for 
Human Resource Management, Chair of the 
President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs, and 
member of the White House American Work-
force Policy Advisory Board that I feel com-
pelled to provide perspective on the U.S. De-
partment of Education’s updated rule gov-
erning borrower defense to repayment. 
It’s important to take a step back. Three 
and a half years ago, the Department un-
veiled proposed revisions to the borrower de-
fense to repayment rule. During the com-
ment period many constituencies, including 
the HBCU community, asserted that certain 
elements of the revisions had the potential 
to be ‘‘injurious and burdensome’’ and could 
cause many schools financial harm. These 
concerns referred mainly to the standard by 
which institutions would be judged to have 
misrepresented the conditions of a bor-
rower’s loan, broadening of the definition of 
‘‘misrepresentation,’’ and the basis for po-
tential administrative action by the Sec-
retary—including fines or termination from 
participation in Title IV programs under the 
Higher Education Act (HEA). 
One of Secretary DeVos’s first actions was 
to postpone the effective date for the pro-
posed borrower defense rules. She then re-
convened the negotiated rulemaking com-
mittees to address, among other things, the 
concerns raised by HBCUs and other Minor-
ity Serving Institutions that primarily serve 
first-generation, low-income students. The 
Secretary encouraged all parties to take a 
step back and find a solution that would be 
fairer to students and schools and relieve 
taxpayers of significant costs. 
A year later, having not reached consensus 
about the best way forward, the Department 
of Education published its own revised rules 
clarifying who is eligible for relief, the max-
imum amount of said relief, and how long a 
borrower can bring a claim. More impor-
tantly, the Department made a commitment 
to consumer education for students and their 
families prior to them enrolling in college 
instead of having them litigate poor college 
choice decisions after-the-fact when they’ve 
poured significant amounts of time and 
money into earning a degree without any 
reasonable hope of achieving a fair return on 
their investment. I’m of the opinion that the 
Department’s new borrower defense rules 
protect individual borrowers from fraud, en-
sures accountability across institutions of 
higher education, and protects taxpayers. 
While the resulting new rules are not per-
fect, they go a long way toward addressing 
the challenges of students and colleges. The 
HBCU Community had major concerns about 
the initial 2016 revisions because they placed 
all of the accountability on the schools and 
had a low threshold for punitive action. In 
addition, many college leaders disagreed 
with the ‘‘triggers’’ for administrative ac-
tion. The new rules provide flexibility for 
schools to make changes to their course of-
ferings and graduation requirements based 
on costs, student interest and employer 
needs without being characterized as fraudu-
lent. Now that nearly all of the major con-
cerns raised by the HBCU Community were 
addressed by the Secretary, it is time to pass 
the rules so we can put our collective energy 
into educating America’s diverse future 
workforce. 
America has a talent shortage—one that 
will only get worse in the foreseeable future 
due to our low birth rate. Adding insult to 
injury, we have a workforce in critical need 
of re-skilling with a very large percentage of 
Americans sitting on the sidelines as a result 
and not participating in the labor force. As 
borrowers and schools move forward, both 
groups should be laser-focused on addressing 
this issue and improving the employability 
of the U.S. workforce. 
On the front end, borrowers should select 
schools and programs that lead to good jobs 
and whose costs are commensurate with sal-
aries for their industry of choice. Then col-
leges, having enrolled the right students in 
the right programs, must proactively de-
velop relationships with employers to co-de-
sign relevant curricula that meet our coun-
try’s need for skilled workers. 
All parties must put aside petty partisan 
differences to arm our country with a high-
ly-skilled future U.S. workforce sans unnec-
essarily burdensome student loan debt. Sup-
porting the new borrower defense rules pro-
posed by the Department of Education is an 
important first step. 
Sincerely, 
JOHNNY C. TAYLOR, Jr., 
President & CEO. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to share some 
quotes from the letter.

‘‘All parties must put aside petty 
partisan differences to arm our country 
with a highly skilled future U.S. work-
force sans unnecessarily burdensome 
student loan debt. Supporting the new 
borrower defense rules proposed by the 
Department of Education is an impor-
tant first step.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I rise in support of this resolu-
tion and thank the gentlewoman from 
Nevada for her leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution conveys 
the congressional disapproval of the 
Department of Education’s refusal to 
protect students and taxpayers from 
predatory institutions. Those students 
are victims of widespread, proven fraud 
about graduation rates, job placement 
rates, and transferability of credits. 
Fortunately, the law provides relief, 
but instead of maintaining the Obama- 
era borrower defense rule, which pro-
vides a fair and streamlined process to 
provide debt relief to defrauded stu-
dents, the Department of Education 
has finalized a new borrower defense 
rule that prevents an overwhelming 
majority of defrauded students from 
getting relief. 
We should reject this new rule and 
provide meaningful relief to defrauded 
students. Making defrauded students 
whole is the right thing to do, but it is 
not the only thing we should do. 
We must ensure that students and 
taxpayers are not defrauded in the first 
place. That is why we should pass the 
College 
Affordability 
Act, 
a 
com-
prehensive overhaul of our higher edu-
cation system that cracks down on 
low-quality, predatory schools. The 
College Affordability Act holds schools 
accountable for students’ success and 
cuts the cost of college for students 
and families across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, to address the present 
problem, those students need relief 
today. Therefore, I urge my colleagues 
to support this resolution of congres-
sional disapproval. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. All in-
stitutions, regardless of their tax sta-
tus, must be held accountable for 
fraudulent behavior, and that is ex-
actly what the 2019 borrower defense 
regulation accomplishes. 
I am very interested in the way our 
colleagues are using the term and the 
way the Obama administration cat-
egorizes the schools we call for-profits. 
They are called predatory. Why is 
that? 
It is very interesting to me that I 
have always thought that what makes 
this country great is our capitalistic 
system, yet our colleagues think that 
anybody that makes a profit is preda-
tory. That is so counter to the Amer-
ican theme, the American way of life, 
but that is what they call them, preda-
tory. It is really, really unfair to do 
that. 
Republicans care about all students, 
all institutions, and all taxpayers. It is 
a shame my friends across the aisle feel 
otherwise. 
Back in 2016, the previous adminis-
tration let ‘‘selective, regionally ac-
credited liberal arts schools’’ off the 
hook from facing consequences for in-
flating data in marketing materials. 
Students who filed a borrower de-
fense claim in this situation would be 
denied relief. Why? Because President 
Obama’s administration believed this 
theoretical school and the education 
the student subsequently received is 
somehow superior to other institu-
tions. Justice was not served in this ex-
ample. 
Before my colleagues argue that this 
example is theoretical and rarely hap-
pens, let me list a few examples, with-
out naming names. 
A public flagship university gave 
U.S. News incorrect information about 
alumni contributions from 1999 to 2019. 
Last 
year, 
five 
schools 
were 
unranked from U.S. News & World Re-
port after all five of those schools—two 
public and three private not-for-prof-
its—acknowledged they provided incor-
rect information. 
In 2018, a public university admitted, 
over the course of several years, that it 
intentionally—intentionally—sub-
mitted false data to boost the rankings 
of its online MBA program. 
Other examples in the past decade in-
clude prominent institutions fudging 
acceptance rates, SAT scores, high 
school GPAs, and graduation rates. 
The Trump administration recog-
nizes the borrower defense to repay-
ment process must be fair to students, 
taxpayers, and institutions. I am glad 
they struck a balance that gives due 
process to all parties involved. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose H.J. Res. 76, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire as to how much time I 
have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Nevada has 21 minutes 
remaining. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, be-
fore I yield, I would like to clarify for 
the record that this example that was 
just included by Ms. FOXX was an ex-
ample that was included in the rule in 
2016, and in fact, there were no claims 
filed under that example. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Oregon 
(Ms. 
BONAMICI). 
b 0945 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.J. Res. 76, 
which will reverse the Trump adminis-
tration’s harmful new borrower defense 
rule. 
The initial borrower defense rule was 
designed to provide defrauded students 
with the debt relief they are entitled to 
receive under the Higher Education 
Act. Unfortunately, Secretary DeVos 
rewrote the rule to make it nearly im-
possible for future students who are 
victimized by deceptive institutions to 
get the relief they need and deserve. 
According to the Department’s own 
estimate, only about 3 percent of the 
loan debt held by defrauded borrowers 
would be dismissed under the new rule. 
That is not justice for victims of fraud. 
We must also continue our work to 
update the Higher Education Act to 
prevent unscrupulous institutions from 
harming students and taxpayers in the 
first place. The College Affordability 
Act will hold institutions accountable 
and make college more affordable and 
equitable for everyone. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.J. 
Res. 76 today and the College Afford-
ability Act when it comes to the floor. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE). 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the resolution, but I 
think what we all support and what we 
all agree on is that individuals who are 
harmed by fraudulent practices should 
have their debts forgiven. 
And let’s just look at where we are. 
This is 20 years this has been on the 
books. For 20 years, 60 cases were 
filed—60, I will emphasize that. Since 
2015, at the end of the previous admin-
istration, 287,000 cases have been filed. 
So we all want to know if there is 
fraud. We don’t want fraud. We don’t 
want people harmed by fraud, individ-
uals harmed by fraud to have to pay 
that back. And remember, the money 
is going to our hardworking taxpayers. 
So that is all this rules says. It says 
that there is fraud; you are harmed by 
fraud; and you don’t have to pay it 
back as an individual. 
Let’s just look at an example of that. 
What if the fraud of a school is they 
advertise a work placement rate of 85 
percent and it is only 50 percent. Well, 
that is fraud. But if you were one of the 
50 percent who got a job, were you 
harmed? You got your education; you 
got a job; you moved forward. Should 
the taxpayers forgive your student 
loans when you got the education and 
got the job that you were moving for? 
That is all. We are trying to make it 
reasonable. The 287,000 cases that are 
sitting before Secretary DeVos would 
be under the old rule. This is the new 
rule going forward, so people will know 
what it is and understand that, one, we 
are fighting fraud. If you were harmed 
by fraud and you can prove that as an 
individual, you still get your loans for-
given. 
I think it is reasonable. I think that 
it sets a process in place that people 
can understand. It has it going forward. 
I support the rule, and I oppose this 
resolution. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO). 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H309 
January 16, 2020 
Under Secretary Betsy DeVos, the 
Department of Education has aban-
doned its responsibility to put students 
first and hold predatory, for-profit col-
leges accountable. The Department has 
rolled back protections for students 
seeking a foothold in the middle class 
through higher education. 
In what amounts to a giveaway to 
predatory, 
for-profit 
colleges, 
Sec-
retary DeVos has dismantled a crucial 
protection for students who were de-
frauded by shady institutions that sad-
dled them with student loan debt, pro-
vided them with subpar education, and 
issued them useless degrees. 
Borrower defense to repayment was 
intended to provide full student loan 
debt forgiveness to defrauded students. 
But Secretary DeVos has issued a new 
rule which makes it harder for stu-
dents to prove that they were de-
frauded and fails to provide students 
with the full student loan debt relief 
that they are legally entitled to. 
Now, to make this even worse, she 
eliminated protections for students 
whose schools shut down, shut down 
before they completed their programs, 
leaving them burdened with loans and 
often without the ability to transfer 
their credits elsewhere. 
240,000 students—nearly 42,000 stu-
dents from California—are waiting for 
relief, suffering emotional and finan-
cial hardships in the process. Many of 
these 
students 
attended 
the 
now- 
defunct Corinthian Colleges, an insti-
tution that even my Republican col-
leagues have agreed was in the business 
of defrauding students. 
These students did everything right, 
but they were deceived by a slew of 
false promises from for-profit institu-
tions that only saw them as a boost to 
their bottom line. 
Secretary DeVos is using the power 
of her office to defend a shady indus-
try. Today, we are here to send a clear 
message: We Democrats stand with 
America’s students who should be re-
lieved of student debt unjustly accrued. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER). 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 76. 
We all want to make sure that Amer-
ica’s students get the education they 
deserve in the college they pay for that 
education or the higher education in-
stitution. By advancing this legislation 
today, the majority of this Chamber 
seeks to turn back the clock on bor-
rower defense, leading to dangerous 
consequences for students, those repay-
ing their loans, and the American tax-
payer. 
The Obama-era rule, which the ma-
jority seeks to return us to, was 
marked by regulatory chaos, excessive 
punishments, and ridiculous costs. The 
Obama rule had no clarity and sought 
to forgive student loans on a massive 
scale, regardless of the cost to the tax-
payers. 
Estimates put the total cost of the 
loan forgiveness giveaway at $40 bil-
lion. 
It 
also 
excessively 
punished 
schools with harsh penalties, some-
times leading to their closure, ending 
access to another avenue for higher 
education for some current and pro-
spective students. That is why the 2019 
Trump administration issued the new 
Borrower Defense Institutional Ac-
countability rule. 
The new rule currently in effect pro-
vides: 
Regulatory clarity for all institu-
tions; 
Affords due process to both students 
and institutions; 
Narrowly tailors relief to actual 
harm; 
Holds all institutions accountable for 
misrepresentation; 
Provides students with more options 
to continue their education should 
their school close; and 
Allows for faster relief by allowing 
institution-level arbitration. 
Importantly, the 2019 rule is esti-
mated to save taxpayers $11 billion 
from the 2016 Obama rule. 
Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot afford 
to return to the outdated, costly, and 
confusing Obama-era rule the majority 
seeks to return to effect today. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the joint reso-
lution. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I would like to, first, clarify the 
record that the 60 students who filed 
claims in the past 20 years is because 
students didn’t understand they had 
the right to file those claims. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Nevada for her 
fierce leadership on this. 
I rise in strong support of this resolu-
tion to block Betsy DeVos’ callous at-
tempt to rewrite the borrower defense 
repayment rule. That original rule pro-
tected student borrowers who have 
been cheated by predatory, for-profit 
colleges. 
This rule change would make it near-
ly impossible for defrauded students to 
have their loans forgiven, and it strips 
away 
justice 
for 
240,000 
borrowers 
whose claims the Trump administra-
tion has refused to process. That in-
cludes my own constituents, whom I 
had a roundtable with, and they have 
filed claims after their school, the for- 
profit Art Institute of Seattle, abrupt-
ly closed last year. 
Some of those students have rightly 
applied for loan forgiveness through 
the borrower defense to repayment 
process because they are ineligible for 
closed school discharge, and now they 
face extreme barriers to the relief that 
they deserve because Secretary DeVos 
has put profits before the students she 
took an oath to serve. 
One of those students said: I am left 
with no degree, extra thousands of dol-
lars in private loans that they pres-
sured me to get. I feel tricked, guilted, 
and screwed. 
Today, Mr. Speaker, I urge support 
for this resolution that will defend stu-
dents, and I call on the House to also 
pass the College Affordability Act, 
which will crack down on predatory 
for-profit colleges in a comprehensive 
manner. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we have to make sure 
the American people understand the 
truth, and it is especially important 
when we are on the floor of the House. 
What has been happening here this 
morning is that apples and oranges are 
being compared, and it is very impor-
tant that that not happen here because 
that can mislead the public. 
I think most of us learned this in 
school. When laws are passed and rules 
are passed, they go forward, not back-
ward, Mr. Speaker. The new rules go 
forward. They apply in the future. 
They don’t go backward. They don’t af-
fect the people who were in school in 
some of these schools that closed be-
fore. 
Those students, unfortunately for 
those students, are under the previous 
rule, the Obama rule, and that is how 
they are being handled. That is the 
major problem here. 
Our colleagues are saying many of 
these people didn’t know what the 
rules were. That is not the fault of the 
Federal Government, Mr. Speaker. It is 
up to the students to understand the 
rules. 
And, yes, many of them are having 
difficult times because the rule is so 
bad. That is exactly what the new rule 
is trying to fix. It is trying to bring 
clarity and help these students under-
stand when they will be able to apply. 
But the students who were at Corin-
thian and ITT are being handled under 
the Obama-era rule, and that is exactly 
why they are having problems. We have 
been pointing that out over and over 
and over again, yet our colleagues 
refuse to acknowledge that that is the 
nub of the problem. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD). 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.J. Res. 76, which was intro-
duced by my good friend and colleague 
from Nevada, SUSIE LEE, and of which 
I am a proud cosponsor. 
Students defrauded by predatory for- 
profit colleges can be left with crush-
ing debt, useless degrees, and none of 
the job opportunities they were prom-
ised. 
When Secretary DeVos has testified 
before the Education and Labor Com-
mittee over the past year, on two sepa-
rate occasions she has claimed that 
students are her number one priority, 
as they should be. Yet, as Secretary, 
she has acted at all times as though 
students are the enemy and as though

a quality and affordable education is 
her last priority. 
Secretary DeVos has the ability to 
provide immediate relief to students 
who were defrauded. Instead, she has 
halted loan relief for borrowers and 
changed the rules to deprive them of 
relief. Under the new rule from Sec-
retary DeVos, defrauded borrowers can 
be denied debt relief, even in cases 
where predatory schools clearly vio-
lated the law. 
More than 7,000 Pennsylvanians are 
suffering while their applications for 
financial relief are sitting in limbo at 
the Department of Education. We must 
protect students and taxpayers by 
passing this resolution, which blocks 
the DeVos rule from going into effect. 
Students are my number one pri-
ority. Unfortunately, I don’t believe 
that the Secretary can say the same. 
I am proud to stand up for students 
and to be an original cosponsor of this 
resolution. I am also proud that the 
Education and Labor Committee re-
cently passed the College Affordability 
Act out of committee, which would 
provide more protections for students 
and taxpayers. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, when I have had the 
privilege of being in that chair, I have 
often been reminded to ask Members to 
refrain from making comments about 
the President or Members of the Cabi-
net. I am not hearing that being said 
this morning, and I would just like to 
call it to the Speaker’s attention. 
I would also like to say that as long 
as people are getting up on the floor 
and misrepresenting what is happening 
in this administration, I will continue 
to remind them that the rule that is 
being enforced is the Obama-era rule, 
and any students who are being harmed 
are being harmed as a result of that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1000 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Secretary DeVos’ new borrower de-
fense rule drastically changes the ex-
isting 2016 rule making it harder for 
students to get the relief that they de-
serve. Only 3 percent of students are 
projected to even benefit from this new 
provision. 
Students should be focused on get-
ting the quality education they were 
promised, not worrying about being 
saddled with large debts from schools 
that could not and did not deliver on 
that education promise. 
The Secretary’s rule takes the bur-
den of repayment away from the fraud-
ulent institutions and places it on the 
back 
of 
the 
taxpayer. 
Americans 
should not be responsible for the dis-
honest actions of a predatory school. 
I thank Congresswoman LEE for in-
troducing H.J. Res. 76, an important 
step in protecting our students and 
holding 
fraudulent 
institutions 
ac-
countable. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
The taxpayers ought not pay the tab 
for a student who files a claim that 
says I didn’t like the president of this 
school; therefore, my loan should be 
forgiven. Those are the claims being 
filed by some of the students. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to op-
pose the implementation of the harm-
ful DeVos/Trump borrower defense reg-
ulation. 
Instead of working on behalf of stu-
dents, Secretary DeVos is enriching 
predatory for-profit colleges that leave 
students with crushing debt. Instead of 
creating a streamlined process to help 
defrauded borrowers access relief and 
move forward with their lives, this ad-
ministration 
has 
given 
dishonest 
schools new tools they can use to keep 
taking advantage of students. 
In my district in 2016, the courts 
found that the Minnesota School of 
Business and Globe University engaged 
in consumer fraud and purposely de-
ceived more than 1,000 Minnesota stu-
dents who were systematically misled 
to believe that they would obtain a de-
gree and credits that were essentially 
meaningless, losing not only $33.8 mil-
lion, but also their time and countless 
opportunities. 
It is the government’s duty to look 
out for those victimized students and 
to make sure they don’t continue to 
suffer at the hands of the greedy insti-
tutions that took advantage of them. 
Secretary DeVos should be ashamed 
of herself for failing to uphold that 
duty and for once again putting profit 
over people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this resolution. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the 2016 borrower de-
fense regulation does a great disservice 
to our Nation’s students and institu-
tions of post-secondary education be-
cause the previous administration did 
not design the borrower defense rule to 
improve post-secondary education. 
Let me explain. The Higher Edu-
cation Act establishes that a borrower 
can receive loan forgiveness if he or 
she attends an institution that engages 
in an act or omission which led the in-
dividual to borrow a loan. An example 
of an act or omission could be an insti-
tution lying about its graduation rates 
in order to lure more students to enroll 
in that program. That seems fair. 
It is important to note that in the 
2019 rule, students who suffer financial 
harm from fraudulent institutions are 
eligible and will receive loan relief. But 
where the Obama administration went 
haywire was when they blurred the dis-
tinction between what acts or omis-
sions constitute fraud versus an inad-
vertent mistake. 
Many institutions, including HBCUs 
and public flagship universities, were 
concerned that a single marketing 
error could set off a domino effect of 
borrowers seeking and receiving for-
giveness. 
For example, in a New York Times 
article published in 2018, Henry N. Tis-
dale, the President of the small campus 
of Claflin University in Orangeburg, 
South Carolina, expressed concern over 
the Obama-era regulation. Mr. Tisdale 
said, ‘‘A small mistake or error at a 
college like Claflin could put us out of 
business. We don’t have the resources 
ready to respond to frivolous claims.’’ 
Claflin University is just one of the 
many 
small, 
nonprofit 
institutions 
that serve low-income, minority, and 
first-generation students that have be-
come at risk due to the Obama-era 
rules. Institutions like these would be 
on the hook for debt and could close 
due to financial pressures. This would 
deny students their education, act as 
an economic drain on the community 
benefiting from the institution’s busi-
ness, and harm taxpayers who may ul-
timately be responsible to pay off the 
loans. 
It is reasonable to conclude that the 
Obama administration’s borrower de-
fense rule could be the deciding factor 
in colleges prematurely closing. In 
fact, the Obama administration esti-
mated it would have the effect of clos-
ing many institutions, which is why 
their rule is projected to cost over $40 
billion in 10 years. Luckily, the Trump 
administration acted quickly to cor-
rect the rule. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I would like to clarify that the com-
ments that were just quoted were on 
the proposed rule, and those issues 
were fixed. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. TRONE). 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of hundreds of 
thousands of students across the Na-
tion who are victims of predatory for- 
profit colleges. Over 4,000 borrowers in 
Maryland and 227,000 nationally are 
paying the price because the depart-
ment, led by Betsy DeVos, appears to 
have intentionally decided not to proc-
ess the claims. 
Before coming to Congress, I led a 
business of over 7,000 employees. At the 
end of the day, the buck stopped with 
me to make sure we had the staff that 
we needed to serve our customers. Not 
only did Secretary DeVos not have the 
staff she needed to follow the law, but 
through the new rule, this administra-
tion is proposing she is making it hard-
er for students to get the relief they 
deserve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H311 
January 16, 2020 
This is not how we should treat 
America’s students who are looking to 
make a better future for themselves. I 
urge my colleagues to stand with the 
students and reverse this Trump ad-
ministration rule. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 31⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER). 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.J. Res. 76. 
I do agree with my colleagues across 
the aisle that as Members of Congress 
it is our job to ensure accountability 
over how taxpayer dollars are spent, 
and that is a very important aspect of 
our job here. And when tax dollars flow 
to an institution of higher education 
that has not lived up to its promises 
made to students, then defrauded indi-
viduals do deserve a transparent proc-
ess to seek relief and have their stu-
dent loans discharged. 
Under Secretary DeVos’ leadership, 
the U.S. Department of Education’s 
new borrower defense rule replaces a 
flawed process with one that is fair for 
taxpayers and is fair for students. The 
new rule establishes a defined standard 
for borrower defense to repayment, 
clearing up years of confusion that has 
left students in financial hardship and 
schools exposed to increased risk of 
closure despite no intentional mis-
representation. 
The Trump administration’s rule also 
strengthens opportunities for relief for 
students who were misled by a school 
by expanding the window of time that 
students have to discharge their loans. 
But most importantly, this process, 
which 
was 
developed 
over 
many 
months and with stakeholder engage-
ment through every step of the way, 
strengthened accountability on all in-
stitutions of higher education by en-
suring that each and every school is 
held to the same standard, not just the 
taxpaying for-profit institutions. 
Despite all of these commonsense 
measures, today’s CRA seeks to move 
us backwards simply to undermine the 
Trump 
administration 
while 
pre-
venting students from making edu-
cational choices that best meet their 
needs. 
H.J. Res. 76 will repeal the Trump ad-
ministration’s rule to reinstate the 
flawed, confusing standards that were 
implemented in 2016. That rule, the 
Obama-era borrower defense rule, ig-
nored due process, lowered the stand-
ard of proof, and left taxpayers on the 
hook for forgiving student loans to the 
tune of $42 billion regardless of an indi-
vidual claim’s merit. 
The Trump administration’s thor-
ough methodology for borrower defense 
claims ensures any and every student 
will have a pathway to have their stu-
dent loans discharged if they have been 
defrauded while protecting taxpayer 
dollars from massive loan forgiveness 
schemes. In fact, this new rule is esti-
mated to save taxpayers $11 billion. 
It is critical that we leave this rule 
in place to protect students and tax-
payers alike. I urge my colleagues to 
place commonsense policy above poli-
tics and oppose this misguided CRA 
that ultimately will harm all Ameri-
cans. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time remains 
on each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Nevada has 111⁄2 min-
utes. The gentlewoman from North 
Carolina has 2 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Today I rise to offer my strong sup-
port for the joint resolution led by my 
friend and colleague, Congresswoman 
SUSIE LEE. 
On the Education and Labor Com-
mittee we are taking action on behalf 
of students who were fleeced by preda-
tory for-profit colleges. 
Secretary DeVos has ignored hun-
dreds of thousands of pending claims 
from defrauded borrowers and tax-
payers. That includes almost 3,000 from 
my home State of Massachusetts. De-
spite having authority to provide full 
and immediate relief, the Secretary’s 
borrower defense rule does not make 
students whole. 
Her new, partial-relief formula to de-
termine debt forgiveness adds further 
insult to injury. We tested that for-
mula in committee with the secretary 
and exposed how flawed it is, how it se-
verely restricts the relief one can re-
ceive. 
H.J. Res. 76 is necessary to block ef-
forts to weaken key consumer protec-
tions against crushing student debt 
and useless degrees. 
I thank Congresswoman LEE and the 
committee for taking legislative ac-
tion, and I call upon my colleagues to 
support defrauded students in this 
joint resolution. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. WATERS). 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I thank Representatives BOBBY SCOTT 
and SUSIE LEE for their leadership on 
this important resolution. I rise to sup-
port H.J. Res. 76 which blocks Sec-
retary DeVos’ attempts to undermine 
the much-needed borrower defense rule. 
b 1015 
The original rule was implemented in 
2016 to cancel the debt of those stu-
dents defrauded by their colleges. The 
Secretary’s replacement rule is shame-
ful. It would cancel only 3 percent of 
the student loans that result from 
school misconduct. 
While totally unacceptable, the Sec-
retary’s actions are nothing new. The 
for-profit college industry has been ex-
ploiting students for decades, and I 
have been fighting them back for just 
as long. 
As an assemblywoman in California, 
I authored one of the Nation’s first 
laws regulating for-profit schools. As a 
Congresswoman, I passed the 85/15 rule, 
which limited the amount of Federal 
funding for-profit colleges receive from 
taxpayers. 
In 2015, when the for-profit Corin-
thian Colleges closed down after years 
of fraud and misconduct, I was one of 
the Members of Congress to endorse 
and support the Corinthian 100, a group 
of former students who refused to pay 
back loans accrued while attending Co-
rinthian. 
This Congress, I continue fighting for 
students. Last year, the House Finan-
cial Services Committee held two hear-
ings examining the student loan crisis. 
Last month, the committee approved 
three bills that will provide strong stu-
dent borrower protections, including 
for those harmed by for-profit colleges. 
Congress should not stand idly by 
while Secretary DeVos tries to make it 
easier for students to get defrauded by 
for-profit schools. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. LOWEY). 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, Michele 
Kernizan is an Air Force veteran and a 
constituent of mine. After serving our 
country, she enrolled at Kaplan Uni-
versity. 
Kaplan misled Michele about her GI 
Bill benefits and persuaded her to take 
out loans to cover tuition. They offered 
a so-called stipend for books and sup-
plies, but it wasn’t a stipend. It was ad-
ditional student loans. 
By the time Michele learned the 
truth, she had $42,654 in student debt 
and no degree. 
The 2016 borrower defense to repay-
ment rule created a process to help de-
frauded borrowers like Michele access 
student debt relief. Secretary DeVos’ 
rewrite guts protections for students 
and taxpayers in favor of shielding bad- 
acting 
institutions 
from 
account-
ability. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support today’s CRA so veterans like 
Michele have a fair process. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.J. Res. 76 
and in strong opposition to the Depart-
ment of Education’s change to the bor-
rower defense rule. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to stand in defense of defrauded 
students nationwide from getting relief 
that they are entitled to. This signifi-
cant step ensures that we hold the in-
stitutions accountable for their actions 
by blocking this rule from going into 
effect. 
Allowing this rule to move forward is 
a dismantling of student protections

and would further exacerbate the stu-
dent loan crisis in our country, which 
is a major crisis for our young people. 
We should not be protecting fraudu-
lent institutions that prey on students. 
We should be working to prevent fraud 
in education in the first place. 
It is vital that defrauded students 
have a process that is fair and easy to 
understand, and this new guidance 
makes it substantially more difficult 
for these students to receive the relief 
that they desperately need. Denying 
debt relief to defrauded students is 
wrong. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to 
support this bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Congresswoman LEE
for 
yielding and for her leadership on this 
critical issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of this legislation, which re-
verses actions by Betsy DeVos that 
would deny debt relief to students de-
frauded by predatory colleges. 
Over recent years, we have seen for- 
profit colleges like Corinthian and ITT 
Tech collapse, leaving students in my 
district and across the country with 
crushing debt and none of the job op-
portunities that they were promised. 
These students were defrauded, plain 
and simple, and they have been left 
holding the bag, thanks to Betsy 
DeVos’ 
refusal 
to 
implement 
an 
Obama-era rule that provides defrauded 
students with relief and helps them 
move forward with their lives. 
Instead, DeVos rewrote the rule to 
make it harder for borrowers to get re-
lief, severely restricted how much re-
lief they can receive, and shifted the 
costs of providing debt relief from 
predatory schools to the taxpayers. 
DeVos is putting the interests of 
predatory for-profit schools above stu-
dents, and it is wrong. We should al-
ways put students first, and many of 
them are waiting on Betsy DeVos to do 
the right thing. 
As of last month, 240,000 defrauded 
students, including more than 41,000 
students in California, are still waiting 
for DeVos to take action on their 
claims for debt relief. Many of these 
students can’t afford to enroll in an-
other school without the debt relief 
they are owed. They can’t move on 
with their lives because Betsy DeVos is 
dragging her feet. That is simply not 
fair. 
We must pass this legislation to stop 
DeVos from making it even harder for 
defrauded students to get the relief 
they desperately need. 
Ultimately, we must do much more 
to help stop schools from defrauding 
students and taxpayers in the first 
place. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support this action to overturn Sec-
retary DeVos’ misguided policy against 
defrauded students. 
Predatory, 
for-profit 
colleges 
are 
scamming students and taxpayers out 
of millions of dollars. Secretary DeVos 
is helping them to get away with it. 
I held an oversight hearing in my 
Committee 
on 
Appropriations 
sub-
committee, and what did we find? 
While accounting for only 9 percent of 
all students enrolled in post-secondary 
education, predatory, for-profit col-
leges account for 34 percent of all de-
faults. 
Under Secretary DeVos’ new rule, 
students may not receive the financial 
relief that they deserve and are enti-
tled to under the borrower defense to 
repayment provision of the Higher 
Education Act. 
While the Obama administration cre-
ated a streamlined process to help stu-
dents access the relief, the Trump ad-
ministration is making it nearly im-
possible. 
Under the Secretary’s new rule, if 
borrowers cannot prove the school in-
tentionally defrauded them or if they 
cannot file their claim fast enough or if 
they cannot document their exact fi-
nancial harm, they lose out. As little 
as 3 percent of eligible debt will be for-
given now. 
With the Secretary’s rule, what little 
relief there is will likely be shouldered 
by taxpayers, not the schools that are 
committing the fraud. It is wrong. 
In Connecticut, 1,100 defrauded stu-
dents are waiting to be made whole. 
They need help, not Secretary DeVos’ 
cruel policy. 
We must pass this Congressional Re-
view Act resolution and stop her. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time remains 
on my side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Nevada has 3 minutes 
remaining. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
North Carolina has 2 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further requests for time and 
would inquire through the Chair if my 
colleague has any remaining speakers 
on her side. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, we have no further people to 
testify. We are ready to close. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me say again, the 
Secretary has been faithfully executing 
the law. The problem is that our col-
leagues don’t like the law as it is, and 
so we need to change the law if they 
don’t like what the Secretary is exe-
cuting. However, that is not where we 
are today. 
Students who have been harmed by 
fraudulent practices deserve relief, pe-
riod. There is no disagreement on that 
issue, Mr. Speaker. 
Sadly, 
President 
Obama’s 
over-
zealous and flawed borrower defense 
regulation abandoned due process and 
limited student choice. So the Trump 
administration acted quickly to re-
verse this struggling regulation. 
In 2019, the Education Department 
issued a new borrower defense rule to 
better 
protect 
borrowers 
and 
tax-
payers. The rule is the result of more 
than 2 years of deliberations, public 
hearings, negotiations with the higher 
education stakeholders, and consid-
ering, incorporating, and responding to 
public comments on the issues. 
To hear our colleagues speak about 
it, it is something that came straight 
off of Secretary DeVos’ desk. Not true. 
Thanks to this regulatory reset, all 
colleges and universities will be held 
accountable, defrauded students will 
see relief, and taxpayer dollars will be 
better protected. 
Today’s resolution would repeal the 
Trump administration’s rule and go 
back to Obama regulations that harm 
students and taxpayers. That is unrea-
sonable to think about, that our col-
leagues want to do that. They want to 
actually harm the students they claim 
they want to help. Students deserve 
better. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this misguided resolu-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like 
to correct some misinformation about 
the 2016 rule that my colleagues on the 
other side have stated today. 
First of all, the law, the Higher Edu-
cation Act, entitles borrowers a right 
to relief. This applies to all institu-
tions, not just a few. 
The reason the 2019 rule saves money 
is because meritorious claims will be 
denied. Under this new rule, students 
will see only 3 percent of their loans 
discharged, and predatory institutions 
will pay only 1 percent of their fraud. 
The 2019 rule sets an impossibly high 
bar for students to prove relief, incon-
sistent with State law. 
The 2016 rule allowed for arbitration. 
It just banned predispute arbitration 
and class action waivers. 
The 2016 rule was closely negotiated 
with institutions, including HBCUs, 
that struck a balance that was fair to 
institutions and students. 
The Department of Education pre-
dicts that by 2021 over 200,000 borrowers 
will face this type of fraud. This is not 
about borrowers in the past; this is 
about borrowers moving forward. This 
number will only continue to grow if 
we don’t pass the reforms in the Col-
lege Affordability Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H313 
January 16, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
three letters: a letter from The Amer-
ican Legion; a letter from 20 State at-
torneys general; and a letter from a co-
alition of groups, including Student 
Veterans of America, supporting our 
effort to overturn the Secretary’s 
harmful borrower defense rule. 
THE AMERICAN LEGION, 
OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL COMMANDER, 
Washington, DC, December 18, 2019. 
Hon. RICHARD DURBIN, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR DURBIN: On behalf of the 
nearly 2 million members of The American 
Legion, I write to express our support for 
Joint Resolution 56, providing for congres-
sional disapproval of the rule submitted by 
the Department of Education relating to, 
‘‘Borrower Defense Institutional Account-
ability.’’ The rule, as currently written, is 
fundamentally rigged against defrauded bor-
rowers or student loans, depriving them of 
the opportunity for debt relief that Congress 
intended to afford them under the Higher 
Education Act. Affirming this position is 
American Legion Resolution No. 82: Preserve 
Veteran and Servicemember Rights to Gain-
ful Employment and Borrower Defense Pro-
tections, adopted in our National Convention 
2017. 
Thousands of student veterans have been 
defrauded over the years—promised their 
credits would transfer when they wouldn’t, 
given false or misleading job placement rates 
in marketing, promised one educational ex-
perience when they were recruited, but given 
something completely different. This type of 
deception 
against 
our 
veterans 
and 
servicemembers has been a lucrative scam 
for unscrupulous actors. 
As veterans are aggressively targeted due 
to their service to our country, they must be 
afforded the right to group relief. The De-
partment of Education’s ‘‘Borrower Defense’’ 
rule eliminates this right, forcing veterans 
to individually prove their claim, share the 
specific type of financial harm they suffered, 
and prove the school knowingly made sub-
stantial misrepresentations. The preponder-
ance of evidence required for this process is 
so onerous that the Department of Edu-
cation itself estimated that only 3 percent of 
applicants would get relief. 
Until every veteran’s application for stu-
dent loan forgiveness has been processed, we 
will continue to demand fair and timely de-
cisions. The rule that the Department of 
Education has promulgated flagrantly denies 
defrauded veterans these dignities, and The 
American Legion calls on Congress to over-
turn this regulatory action. 
Senator Durbin, The American Legion ap-
plauds your leadership in addressing this 
critical issue facing our nation’s veterans 
and their families. 
For God & Country, 
JAMES W. ‘‘BILL’’ OXFORD, 
National Commander. 
THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHU-
SETTS, OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, 
Boston, Massachusetts, January 14, 2020. 
Senator DICK DURBIN, 
Washington, DC. 
Representative SUSIE LEE, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR DURBIN
AND REPRESENTA-
TIVE
LEE: We, the undersigned Attorneys 
General of Massachusetts, California, Dela-
ware, the District of Columbia, Hawai’i, Illi-
nois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Min-
nesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, 
North 
Carolina, 
Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, 
Vermont, Virginia, and Washington write to 
express our support for the resolution of dis-
approval that you have introduced regarding 
the U.S. Department of Education’s (‘‘De-
partment’’) 2019 Borrower Defense Rule 
(‘‘2019 Rule’’) pursuant to the Congressional 
Review Act. In issuing the 2019 Rule, the De-
partment has abdicated its Congressionally- 
mandated responsibility to protect students 
and taxpayers from the misconduct of un-
scrupulous schools. The rule provides no re-
alistic prospect for borrowers to discharge 
their loans when they have been defrauded 
by predatory for-profit schools, and it elimi-
nates financial responsibility requirements 
for those same institutions. If this rule goes 
into effect, the result will be disastrous for 
students while providing a windfall to abu-
sive schools. 
The 2019 Rule squanders and reverses re-
cent progress the Department has made in 
protecting students from fraud and abuse. 
Three years ago, the Department completed 
a thorough rulemaking process addressing 
borrower defense and financial responsi-
bility, in which the views of numerous 
schools, 
stakeholders, 
and 
public 
com-
menters were considered and incorporated 
into a comprehensive set of regulations. The 
regulations, promulgated by the Department 
in November 2016 (‘‘2016 Rule’’), made sub-
stantial progress toward achieving the De-
partment’s then-stated goal of providing de-
frauded borrowers with a consistent, clear, 
fair, and transparent process to seek debt re-
lief. At the same time, the 2016 Rule pro-
tected taxpayers by holding schools account-
able that engage in misconduct and ensuring 
that financially troubled schools provide the 
government with protection against the 
risks they create. 
The Department’s new rule would simply 
rescind and replace its 2016 Rule, reversing 
all of its enhanced protections for students 
and its accountability measures for for-prof-
it schools. The Department’s 2019 Rule pro-
vides an entirely unfair and unworkable 
process for defrauded students to obtain loan 
relief and will do nothing to deter and hold 
accountable schools that cheat their stu-
dents. Among its numerous flaws, the De-
partment’s new rule places insurmountable 
evidentiary burdens on student borrowers 
with meritorious claims. The rule requires 
student borrowers to prove intentional or 
reckless misconduct on the part of their 
schools, an extraordinarily demanding stand-
ard not consistent with state laws governing 
liability for unfair and deceptive conduct. 
Moreover, even where a school has inten-
tionally or recklessly harmed its students, it 
is difficult to imagine how students would be 
able to obtain the evidence necessary to 
prove intent or recklessness for an adminis-
trative application to the Department. The 
rule also inappropriately requires student 
borrowers to prove financial harm beyond 
the intrinsic harm caused by incurring fed-
eral student loan debt as a result of fraud, 
and establishes a three-year time bar on bor-
rower defense claims, even though students 
typically do not learn until years later that 
they 
were 
defrauded 
by 
their 
schools. 
Compounding these obstacles, the rule arbi-
trarily eliminates the process by which relief 
can be sought on a group level, permitting 
those schools that have committed the most 
egregious and systemic misconduct to ben-
efit from their wrongdoing at the expense of 
borrowers with meritorious claims who are 
unaware of or unable to access relief. 
We are uniquely well-situated to under-
stand the devastating effects that the 2019 
Rule would have on the lives of student bor-
rowers and their families. State attorneys 
general serve an important role in the regu-
lation of private, postsecondary institutions. 
Our investigations and enforcement actions 
have repeatedly revealed that numerous for- 
profit schools have deceived and defrauded 
students, and employed other unlawful tac-
tics to line their coffers with federal student- 
loan funds. We have witnessed firsthand the 
heartbreaking devastation to borrowers and 
their families. Recently, for example, state 
attorneys general played a critical role in 
uncovering widespread misconduct at Career 
Education Corporation, Education Manage-
ment Corporation, the Art Institute and Ar-
gosy schools operated by the Dream Center, 
ITT Technical Institute, Corinthian Col-
leges, American Career Institute and others, 
and then working with the Department to 
secure borrower-defense relief for tens of 
thousands of defrauded students. Though 
this work, we have spoken with numerous 
students who, while seeking new opportuni-
ties for themselves and their families, were 
lured into programs with the promise of em-
ployment opportunities and higher earnings, 
only to be left with little to show for their 
efforts aside from unaffordable debt. 
A robust and fair borrower defense rule is 
critical for ensuring that student borrowers 
and taxpayers are not left bearing the costs 
of institutional misconduct. The Depart-
ment’s new rule instead empowers predatory 
for-profit schools and cuts off relief to vic-
timized students. During the comment pe-
riod on the 2019 Rule, we submitted these and 
other objections to the Department. Rather 
than engaging with our offices, the Depart-
ment ignored our comments and left our con-
cerns unaddressed. We commend and support 
your efforts to disapprove the 2019 Rule to 
protect students and taxpayers. Congress 
must hold predatory institutions account-
able for their misconduct and provide relief 
to defrauded student borrowers and, by en-
acting your resolution of disapproval, ensure 
that the 2016 Rule remains the operative bor-
rower defense regulation.

DEAR SENATOR DURBIN
AND REPRESENTA-
TIVE LEE: As 57 organizations representing 
and advocating for students, families, tax-
payers, veterans and service members, fac-
ulty and staff, civil rights and consumers, we 
write in support of your efforts to disapprove 
the 2019 Borrower Defense to Repayment rule 
pursuant to the Congressional Review Act. 
The purpose of the borrower defense rule as 
defined by the Higher Education Act is to 
protect students and taxpayers from fraud, 
deception, and other illegal misconduct by 
unscrupulous colleges. A well-designed rule

will both provide relief to students who have 
been lied to and cheated, and deter illegal 
conduct by colleges. 
However, the final rule issued by the De-
partment of Education on September 23, 2019, 
would accomplish neither of these goals. An 
analysis of the Department’s own calcula-
tions estimates that only 3 percent of the 
loans that result from school misconduct 
would be cancelled under the new rule. 
Schools would be held accountable for reim-
bursing taxpayers for just 1 percent of these 
loans. 
The DeVos Borrower Defense rule issued in 
September imposes unreasonable time limits 
on student borrowers who have been deceived 
and misled by their schools. It requires ap-
plicants to meet thresholds that make it al-
most impossible for wronged borrowers to 
obtain loan cancellation. 
The rule eliminates the ability of groups of 
borrowers to be granted relief, even in cases 
where there is substantial compelling evi-
dence of widespread wrongdoing. It prohibits 
the filing of claims after three years even 
when evidence of wrongdoing emerges at a 
later date. It requires borrowers to prove 
schools intended to deceive them or acted 
recklessly, although students have no ability 
to access evidence that might show this in-
tent. And the rule stipulates that student 
loans taken by students under false pre-
tenses are insufficient evidence of financial 
harm to allow the loans to be cancelled. 
Additionally, the 2019 rule eliminates the 
promise of automatic loan relief to eligible 
students whose school closed before they 
could graduate. Instead, the Department 
would force each eligible student impacted 
by a school closure to individually find out 
about their statutory right to relief, apply, 
and navigate the government’s bureaucracy 
to have their loans cancelled. 
Many of us wrote to the Department in Au-
gust 2018 in response to the notice of pro-
posed rulemaking and offered carefully con-
sidered recommendations. However, the De-
partment 
rejected 
our 
recommendations 
that would have provided a fair process that 
protects students and taxpayer dollars. In-
stead, the new rule would do little to provide 
relief to students who have been lied to, and 
even less to dissuade colleges from system-
atically engaging in deceptive and illegal re-
cruitment tactics. Moreover, a borrower de-
fense rule that fails to adequately protect 
students harms the most vulnerable stu-
dents, including first-generation college stu-
dents, Black and Latino students, and mili-
tary-connected students, who are targeted 
by and disproportionately enroll in preda-
tory for-profit colleges. 
Meanwhile, the Department refuses to take 
action on a massive backlog of over 200,000 
pending borrower defense claims, having 
failed to approve or deny a single claim in 
over a year. We fully support your effort to 
repeal the 2019 borrower defense rule, and 
look forward to restoration of the 2016 rule, 
which took major steps to provide a path to 
loan forgiveness for the hundreds of thou-
sands of students who attended schools 
where misconduct has already been well doc-
umented.

Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support H.J. 
Res. 76 and to reject Secretary DeVos’ 
harmful rule that makes it nearly im-
possible for borrowers to seek the relief 
that they have the right to seek. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of this resolution disapproving 
the Administration’s new ‘‘Borrowers Defense 
to Repayment’’ rule. This proposed rule would 
make it more difficult for defrauded students in 
my district to seek relief from their student 
loan obligations. 
Over the past few years, we have seen 
large for-profit colleges close shop, leaving 
students with significant amounts of student 
debt and useless degrees. These closures in-
cluded multiple campuses in North Texas, 
thus impacting thousands of students across 
the state. These students were falsely prom-
ised a better life if they obtained a degree 
from these institutions. However, because of 
these closures, students were worse off finan-
cially. 
The Obama Administration proposed rules 
that would streamline the process for students 
to get discharged from their student loan obli-
gations and be able to move on with their 
lives. Unfortunately, these rules were unable 
to go into effect due to Secretary DeVos’s un-
lawful refusal to implement the Obama-era 
rule. Instead, Secretary DeVos has worked 
tirelessly to make the process for students 
seeking relief more burdensome. 
The new Borrower’s Defense rule makes it 
harder for borrowers to seek the relief they 
desperately need so that they can move on 
with their lives. The new rule drastically short-
ens the application period for borrowers to 
apply for relief, raises the bar that borrowers 
have to prove that an institution defrauded 
them, and allows instructions to access the 
evidence provided the borrower so that they 
have an advantage when attempting to under-
mine these claims. 
Simply put, Secretary DeVos’ Borrowers De-
fense rule rigs the game in favor of fraudulent 
institutions while making life much more dif-
ficult for those students that were ripped off. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of this resolution so that we may use our 
Congressional Review Act authority to stop 
this rule before it ruins the livelihood of any 
more students. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 790, 
the previous question is ordered. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the joint resolu-
tion.

was read the third time.

lution.

RECOGNIZING THE WEST ORANGE 
HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate some exceptional young 
people from my district, the cheer-
leaders from West Orange High School, 
known as the Mountaineers. 
They have one dream this year. They 
wanted to compete in the National 
Cheerleading 
Championships. 
They 
knew it wouldn’t be easy. It would re-
quire hours of practice. They would 
have to work and make every routine 
perfect, and they would have to defy 
expectations. 
They went to the regional qualifier 
in Pennsylvania with one goal, and 
when the routines were done and the 
points were counted, they earned a trip 
to the national championships. 
In February they are off to Walt Dis-
ney World Resort in Orlando to battle 
with the best high school cheerleading 
squads in the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope they bring home 
that trophy to West Orange. But 
whether they do or not, they will al-
ways be champions to me and all of us 
in the 10th District of New Jersey. 
f 
CONGRATULATING PATTI PRICE 
ON HER RETIREMENT 
(Mrs. MILLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the hard work of Patricia 
Price, who has devoted the past 42 
years to Big Brothers Big Sisters of the 
Tri-State, an organization in Hun-
tington, West Virginia, which provides 
volunteer mentors for children in ad-
verse living situations. 
Patti came to Big Brothers Big Sis-
ters in 1978 fresh out of graduate school 
with a servant’s heart. She started as a 
case worker, eventually rising to be-
come the executive director. Through-
out her career she committed herself to 
developing a consistent, encouraging, 
and safe environment for underprivi-
leged children in our region. 
Under her leadership, Patti organized 
hundreds of volunteers and staff, and 
created 
countless 
successful 
fund-
raising initiatives. Through these ef-
forts, Big Brothers Big Sisters of the 
Tri-State 
has 
grown 
to 
provide 
mentorship for over 160 children every 
year. 
As she moves into the next phase of 
her life, Patti leaves behind a legacy of

CONGRATULATING LSU ON WIN-
NING NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
(Mr. RICHMOND asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate a group of young 
men who had an excellent undefeated 
season at LSU and won the national 
championship. 
I also rise to congratulate Coach 
Orgeron for his leadership in shaping 
not only those young men on the field, 
but off the field also. 
I also take great pride, Mr. Speaker, 
in recognizing one outstanding indi-
vidual on that team, his name is Grant 
Delpit. 
Grant Delpit was my first batboy at 
the congressional baseball game. Last 
year he was the unanimous All-Amer-
ican, and this year he caused a fumble 
in the national championship game. 
But more importantly, his parents, a 
lawyer, 
law 
enforcement, 
and 
his 
grandmother serves on the board of a 
charter school in my district. They are 
an exceptional family. 
Mr. Speaker, we have a commitment 
that when we see our young people 
doing well that we recognize them and 
congratulate them. So, to all of the 
outstanding young men at LSU for 
winning the national championship, 
and to Grant Delpit for excelling in the 
classroom, off and on the field, I just 
want to say congratulations, we recog-
nize you. And good luck in whatever 
you do in your future. 
f 
CONGRATULATING THE WESTLAKE 
CHAPARRALS ON THEIR STATE 
CHAMPIONSHIP TITLE 
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate 
the 2019 Westlake High School Chap-
arrals football team on winning their 
second State championship title. 
For Texans, high school football isn’t 
just a sport, it is a way of life. Each 
week in the fall we gather under Fri-
day night lights and cheer our team on 
to victory. The young men, women, 
and coaches on our team spend count-
less hours running drills, watching 
film, and getting ready for their mo-
ment in history. 
During the 2019 season, Westlake’s 
dedication paid off as they posted a 24– 
0 shutout over Denton Guyer at AT&T 
Stadium for their second State title. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 25th 
Congressional District in Texas, I con-
gratulate the Chaps on their victory 
and wish them the very best in their 
bright futures. 
In God we trust. 
TIME TO HELP OUR FELLOW 
AMERICANS IN PUERTO RICO 
(Mr. SOTO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, it was over 2 
years ago that Hurricane Maria hit the 
island of Puerto Rico, and our fellow 
Americans sustained one of the worst 
natural disasters, with the highest 
death toll in modern history. Now we 
have, again, earthquakes hitting the is-
land since December 28 to this date. 
I got to go this week and saw first-
hand schools crumbling. I saw folks sit-
ting out in tents who need emergency 
housing and mental health services. 
Yet we still have less than half the 
money that we allocated for Hurricane 
Maria actually down on the island. 
It is time for the Trump administra-
tion to bring that money down. 
In addition, it is time to declare a 
major disaster declaration. We cannot 
let this tragedy happen again. America 
is watching. History is watching. It is 
time to help our fellow Americans in 
Puerto Rico. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
TALENTED 
ALL- 
AMERICAN GAMES WOMEN BAS-
KETBALL PLAYERS 
(Mr. WALTZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, today I 
want to recognize three talented high 
school basketball players in my dis-
trict, Khadija Faye, Tiera White, and 
Brianna Ellis. 
Khadija and Tiera play basketball at 
Father Lopez High School in Daytona 
Beach, and Brianna plays basketball at 
Flagler Palm Coast High School in 
Palm Coast, Florida. All three of these 
young women have just been nomi-
nated to play in the 2020 All-American 
Games, a national basketball competi-
tion benefiting the Ronald McDonald 
charities. They were among 46 seniors 
from Florida to be selected for this 
honor. 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to recog-
nize their hard work and talent on the 
House floor today. The final roster will 
be announced next week, and we are all 
hoping all three will be on it. 
I know I speak on behalf of all of us 
when I say we are so proud and so ex-
cited to see Daytona and Palm Coast 
represented so well in women’s basket-
ball. 
f 
RELIEF FOR DEFRAUDED 
STUDENTS 
(Mr. ENGEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the passage of H.J. 
Res. 76, a resolution to overturn Sec-
retary DeVos’ shameful borrower de-
fense rule. 
Secretary DeVos claims her rule is to 
help students and to protect taxpayers, 
but this rule does the complete oppo-
site. 
Instead of working on behalf of stu-
dents that have been defrauded by 
predatory for-profit colleges, Secretary 
DeVos seeks to protect those bad ac-
tors who leave students with crushing 
debt and worthless degrees. 
Secretary DeVos refuses to provide 
relief to defrauded students, eliminates 
consumer protections and higher edu-
cation, and weakens safeguards to pre-
vent low quality schools from receiving 
taxpayer money. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why I was proud 
to vote for and help pass H.J. Res. 76 to 
overturn Secretary DeVos’ anti-stu-
dent rule, and I urge prompt action by 
the full Senate. 
f 
ADDRESSING SUICIDE 
PREVENTION 
(Mr. STEWART asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak about the Suicide Prevention 
Act. 
I read this statistic on the House 
floor before, but it bears repeating: 
every 9 minutes someone in the United 
States commits suicide. And for every 
suicide-related death, there are 25 at-
tempts. These are truly heartbreaking 
statistics, and they hit close to home. 
I have met with the family and 
friends of those who have taken their 
own life. I have heard their stories and 
I am responding to their pleas for help. 
This bill is part of a longstanding 
commitment to reverse this troubling 
trend. It is bipartisan, it is bicameral, 
and it would provide for new resources 
to turn the tide on this dire situation. 
Part of the problem when it comes to 
effectively addressing suicide is that 
medical and other professionals have 
outdated resources and stale data. The 
current data collection efforts regard-
ing suicide are often years out of date, 
and this limits the ability of State and 
local health organizations, as well as 
community organizations, to recognize 
the trends early and intervene. 
Mr. Speaker, I am asking my col-
leagues here in the House and the Sen-
ate to respond to those who are crying 
for help. This legislation makes so 
much sense, we should make it a pri-
ority.

SKYROCKETING PRESCRIPTION 
DRUG COSTS 
(Ms. CRAIG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago I 
started a healthcare listening tour 
across Minnesota’s Second Congres-
sional District. Whether it is Wabasha 
or Burnsville, the issue is the same. 
The cost of lifesaving prescription 
drugs is skyrocketing. Over the past 2

decades, the cost of insulin has risen 
600 percent, a lifesaving drug that more 
than 350,000 Minnesotans rely on. 
That is unacceptable and that is why 
I have introduced the Emergency Ac-
cess to Insulin Act, to make insulin 
more affordable, and hold big drug 
companies accountable for jacking up 
insulin prices and making other life-
saving drugs unaffordable for Min-
nesota families. 
Over the past 10 years, the cost of 
Canasa, a medicine for Crohn’s disease, 
has increased by 150 percent. That is 
why I have cosponsored 61 bills to ad-
dress skyrocketing healthcare costs. 
We do not have the luxury of stand-
ing by any longer while 3 in 10 Min-
nesotans are rationing their medicine. 
It is time to sit down with my col-
leagues 
and 
lower 
the 
cost 
of 
healthcare.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
MAYOR DEBBIE JOHNSON 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of 
Ms. Debbie Johnson, who passed away 
from complications due to an illness on 
Monday, January 13. 
At the time of her passing, Ms. JOHN-
SON was serving as mayor pro tem of 
Port Wentworth in the First Congres-
sional District of Georgia. Mayor pro 
tem Johnson’s colleagues remember 
her as a larger-than-life figure, who 
served the city with the utmost dedica-
tion to the people she represented. 
For 17 years she worked at Savan-
nah-Chatham Metropolitan Police De-
partment before becoming one of the 
first African American women ever 
elected to the Port Wentworth City 
Council. 
While mayor pro tem, she fought for 
the voices of the unheard and made 
fundamental rights and equality a top 
priority. One of her most important 
projects included coordinating events 
to feed the hungry during Thanks-
giving and Christmas. 
Mr. Speaker, Mayor pro tem John-
son’s work and presence will be deeply 
missed in Port Wentworth. Her family 
and friends will be in my thoughts and 
prayers during this most difficult time.

MARKING ROE V. WADE 47TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
(Ms. SPEIER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, in honor 
of the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade 
on January 22, I rise for the 1-in-4 
women in America who have had an 
abortion, and the 1-in-3 women living 
in a State where abortion would be 
banned if Roe was overturned. 
On March 4, the Supreme Court will 
hear June Medical Services v. Gee. The 
Louisiana 
law 
requiring 
admitting 
privileges would leave just one clinic 
open and one physician to provide all 
the abortions in Louisiana. 
Although Roe is the law of the land, 
27 States impose waiting periods, 12 
ban private insurance coverage, 18 
mandate counseling, and 43 have abor-
tion-ban laws ready to go. 
Mr. Speaker, to those waging war on 
the rights of women, next week is the 
anniversary of the Women’s March. We 
have seen the power women wield when 
they march to the ballot box. Get 
ready for 2020 because we are not going 
back.

ROE V. WADE DECISION DEPRIVES 
STATES’ RIGHTS 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, 47 years 
ago, the Supreme Court of the United 
States 
incorrectly 
decided 
Roe 
v. 
Wade. Since then, the rights of States 
to determine whether or not they will 
provide unborn children the same right 
to life and liberty as those outside the 
womb has been eliminated. 
Since then, 61 million American chil-
dren have been killed without a say 
and without due process. Since then, 
the Supreme Court has effectively tied 
the hands of those with compassion by 
depriving States the ability to protect 
life. 
Justice Antonin Scalia, in his dissent 
in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern 
Pennsylvania v. Casey, saw the harm 
in this, saying: ‘‘By foreclosing all 
democratic outlet for the deep passions 
this issue arouses, by banishing the 
issue from the political forum that 
gives all participants, even the losers, 
the satisfaction of a fair hearing and 
an honest fight, by continuing the im-
position of a rigid national rule instead 
of allowing for regional differences, the 
Court merely prolongs and intensifies 
the anguish.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I couldn’t agree with 
the late Justice Scalia more.

HONORING JEANETTE PEDONE ON 
HER 
RETIREMENT 
AS 
ASSIST-
ANT CHIEF CLERK OF DEBATES 
(Mr. CONNOLLY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Jeanette Pedone on 
her recent retirement as our Assistant 
Chief Clerk of Debates, after nearly 17 
years of service here in the House. 
Jeanette grew up along the eastern 
seaboard but always enjoyed her sum-
mers in Harvey Cedars, New Jersey. 
She attended the Fashion Institute of 
Technology and the New York School 
of Interior Design. Jeanette came to 
the House from the Stenograph Com-
pany, where she was a sales representa-
tive. She first served as an editor for 
committee hearings in the Office of Of-
ficial Reporters in 2003, and she became 
an Assistant Chief Clerk of Debates a 
year later. 
Jeanette was a debate clerk for more 
than 16 years, the longest job she ever 
held, and served under four Speakers of 
the House, four Clerks of the House, 
and four Chiefs of the Office of Official 
Reporters. 
As a debate clerk, she coordinated 
the production of the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD from the floor of the House, re-
cording who spoke on the floor and all 
parliamentary actions of the House, a 
pretty big job. She also assisted the of-
ficial reporters and editors in gath-
ering speeches and supplemental infor-
mation for the RECORD. 
Jeanette was a familiar face on the 
floor and had a front-row seat to his-
tory. She represented the office at a 
State 
of 
the 
Union 
Address, 
five 
speeches to joint meetings of Congress 
by foreign leaders, and many impor-
tant legislative moments here on the 
floor. But she most fondly recalls 
meeting her childhood idol, Patty 
Duke, and her son, the actor Sean 
Astin, when they toured the House 
floor late one night after adjournment. 
Jeanette retired to Lords Valley, 
Pennsylvania, with her husband, Joe. 
She looks forward to spending more 
time with her family, including her 
daughter, Courtney, and her son, Jeff. 
She also now has two baby grand-
daughters to shower with attention. 
Mr. Speaker, we wish Jeanette all 
the best on behalf of the entire House 
of Representatives.

CONGRATULATING REFUGIO HIGH 
SCHOOL 
(Mr. CLOUD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate the Refugio High School 
Bobcats football team for winning 
their fifth State championship. The 
Bobcats had a 16–0 record this year on 
the way to the Class 2A Division 1 
championship game, where they won 
28–7. 
What makes this win extra special is 
that Refugio was one of the hardest hit 
communities by Hurricane Harvey. Ini-
tially, the vast majority of students 
was homeless, and football games were 
delayed as the school and stadium were 
repaired. While the damage to homes, 
schools, and businesses in that commu-
nity were devastating, the spirit of 
Refugio remained strong. 
Head coach Jason Herring consist-
ently gives all the credit to the kids 
who put in the hours and showed up to 
get their work done. He has played a 
big role in helping these students ful-
fill their potential. All in all, it was an 
awesome year for the team. 
In Refugio, winning football games is 
part of the legacy that goes to building

PAYING TRIBUTE TO WILLIE 
BELTON 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
Mr. Willie Belton, a political leader, 
successful businessman, and decorated 
war veteran who passed away on Janu-
ary 8, 2020. 
Born and raised in Basile, Louisiana, 
Mr. Belton went on to serve in the 
United States Army and was awarded 
the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart 
for his heroic acts of sacrifice. Later, 
he received the Louisiana Veterans 
Honor Medal in gratitude for his faith-
ful service. 
Mr. Belton was also a monumental 
figure within the civil rights move-
ment. In 1960, he was chosen to lead a 
local 
NAACP 
chapter 
and 
worked 
alongside some of history’s heroes, in-
cluding Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., to 
put an end to racial discrimination and 
ensure equal opportunity for all. 
Mr. Belton was the first African 
American in Evangeline Parish to run 
for State representative in a predomi-
nantly white district. Even though he 
didn’t end up winning that election, he 
made an enormous impact on the State 
of Louisiana by breaking down bar-
riers, extinguishing fear, and paving 
the way for those who followed. 
Our prayers are with the Belton fam-
ily as they grieve the loss of an Amer-
ican hero. His service to this country 
and his active commitment to social 
justice will never be forgotten. 
May he rest in peace.

RECOGNIZING EAGLE SCOUT EVAN 
MICHAEL HOLMES 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, today, 
I recognize Evan Michael Holmes from 
Troop 95 in Upper Township on the at-
tainment of his Eagle Scout rank. 
Eagle Scout is the highest rank obtain-
able from the Boy Scouts of America, 
and only 4 percent of all boys ever 
achieve this prestigious recognition. 
Eagle Scouts are more likely to dedi-
cate their life to service, and his serv-
ice is very special. He is planning to 
join the Navy in February 2020. I was 
proud of Evan’s beautiful Court of 
Honor that was celebrated earlier this 
month, and I congratulate Evan. 
Mr. Speaker, we are proud of Evan 
and look forward to big things in the 
future from him. Some of us look for 
heroes in celebrities—God help us. 
Some look for heroes here in Wash-
ington—equally, God help us. But my 
heroes are individuals, young men like 
Evan, who do more, who work harder, 
and who know what it is to be a true 
American and a good person, who real-
ly care for and love their families and 
the people around them. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish Evan the very 
best, and may God bless him.

Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand here today as pro-life, pro-fam-
ily, and pro-child. No matter what your 
faith is, everyone understands that life 
is very precious and that life is a gift. 
I believe that as Members of Congress 
and, really, as all citizens, we are 
called to protect the vulnerable, and 
this is one of my core beliefs. Being 
pro-life means not just pro-birth but 
being interested in the welfare of the 
child during his or her entire formative 
years. 
That is why I am not only a longtime 
member of the Pro-Life Caucus but 
also the co-chair of the Congressional 
Coalition on Adoption. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to take this op-
portunity to thank this administration 
for the work they have done to defend 
the unborn, including changing the 
rules for title 10 and expanding the 
Mexico City policy. I look forward to 
continuing to work with the adminis-
tration on these issues as we come to 
the time of January when we remem-
ber the ruling on Roe v. Wade. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the 
day when there are no more abortions 
because there are no more unwanted 
children.

CONSTITUTIONAL AND MORAL 
AUTHORITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority

Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
GALLAGHER). 
PROTECTING OUR WATERS AND COMMUNITIES 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, last week, the House 
passed H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act 
of 2019. This important legislation 
marks a critical step forward in ad-
dressing the public health crisis caused 
by so-called forever chemicals like 
PFAS. 
According to the Agency for Toxic 
Substances and Disease Registry, cer-
tain compounds of PFAS, like PFOA 
and PFOS, are known to cause liver 
damage, thyroid disease, asthma, birth 
defects, and even some cancers. 
Unfortunately, for many in northeast 
Wisconsin, this fight is personal and 
tragic. Anyone who has been to our 
small corner of the country knows that 
water is part of what makes northeast 
Wisconsin so special and beautiful. Un-
fortunately, this water, which is so 
central to our way of life, is under 
threat from chemicals like PFOA and 
PFOS. 
While until recently, PFAS was an 
unknown contaminant. Recent studies 
give us a better understanding of the 
risks posed by compounds like PFOA 
and PFOS. Not only have our commu-
nities been unwittingly placed at risk 
by these toxins, but it has taken far 
too long to get them the resources re-
quired to mitigate their effects. 
As a result, these toxic chemicals 
have contaminated local water sources 
and literally poisoned the well from 
which Wisconsinites drink. 
No one should be afraid to drink or 
use the water from their tap. The fact 
that this is the case for many across 
the country, including in northeast 
Wisconsin, and in Peshtigo, in par-
ticular, means one thing: We must act 
with a sense of urgency to defend our 
communities and protect the clean 
water that underpins our way of life. 
As a member of the PFAS Task 
Force, I am committed to finding ways 
to combat PFAS and its negative ef-
fects on our communities. 
Last year, Representative DELGADO 
and I introduced the PFAS Right-to- 
Know Act, a bipartisan bill that would 
require PFAS to be listed on the Toxics 
Release Inventory and require manu-
facturers, processors, and producers to 
report their usage of PFAS chemicals 
to the EPA. 
Signed into law last month as part of 
the 2020 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, this bill provides commu-
nities with a better understanding of 
where these toxins come from so we 
can better combat their effects. While 
this was an important first step, there 
is more to be done. 
The PFAS Action Act builds on last 
year’s progress through a number of 
important provisions. It designates

PFOA and PFOS as hazardous sub-
stances to ensure that all those respon-
sible for contamination do their part to 
clean up and restore our waters and 
habitats. It establishes stronger drink-
ing water standards to give States and 
communities the resources they need 
to 
mitigate 
contamination. 
It 
strengthens the Clean Water Act to in-
clude PFOS and PFOA as toxic pollut-
ants. 
This legislation will be critical in 
protecting waters in northeast Wis-
consin and across the country for cur-
rent and future generations. When it 
comes to the PFAS crisis, I would sim-
ply argue to my own colleagues who 
may be skeptical of which direction we 
need to go or the need for the Federal 
Government to get involved that inac-
tion is not an option. 
The PFAS Action Act is a thorough, 
comprehensive, and long-overdue solu-
tion, and I want to thank Representa-
tives PALLONE and DINGELL for their 
leadership, as well as my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle for their hard 
work in protecting our water and our 
communities. 
b 1130 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is al-
ways an honor to be here in the House 
of Representatives and have an oppor-
tunity to speak, as so many places 
around the world don’t have those 
privileges, those rights. 
Sometimes people ask, well, if the 
rights are truly endowed by our cre-
ator, then why don’t people have them 
all over the world? 
And it is an endowment, these rights, 
like an inheritance; but the only way 
you get to keep any inheritance is if 
you are willing to fight for it, because, 
if you are not, in this world, evil people 
will always be trying to take what you 
have and take it for themselves. 
So we have been blessed to be in a 
country where we had men and women 
willing to stand up and fight for us. 
My 4 years in the Army, we were 
never in combat. I still think we should 
have gone, in 1979, to Iran; and if we 
had addressed the attack on our Amer-
ican property, which was the U.S. Em-
bassy, then the Ayatollah would have 
been gone, and there would be tens of 
thousands of Americans still alive 
today. It is just very unfortunate. 
But at least Soleimani is no longer 
around to kill Americans and to dream 
up new devices, whether improvised or 
exploding devices to kill and maim 
Americans. 
It is one of the great ironies that the 
lead terrorist in the world, Soleimani, 
who ordered, directed, got the best ar-
chitects to design instruments to in-
flict 
casualties 
on 
Americans—and 
there were more Americans killed or 
wounded on that road in from the air-
port in Iraq. 
Some may remember, back in the 
early days of the war in Iraq, that the 
most dangerous place we kept hearing 
was on that road in from the airport. 
There were so many IEDs and explosive 
devices that killed, maimed our Amer-
ican military, and they were set to kill 
and maim American military. That 
was after Soleimani had taken over the 
IRGC and he had his special troops. 
But he was a terrorist. He had been 
allowed to keep finding ways to kill 
Americans for far too long, and the 
world is a better place without him. 
It was amazing that people on both 
sides of the aisle could agree on that 
when President Obama ordered the 
killing of Osama bin Laden, and yet so 
many of those same people with whom 
we agreed thought it was atrocious 
that President Trump would order the 
taking out of the lead terrorist killing 
hundreds of Americans. It is just a 
strange thing. 
Some call it Trump Derangement 
Syndrome. They just have so much ha-
tred for our current President that it 
doesn’t matter that it is in direct con-
flict with what they have said before. 
For example, our chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee and the minority 
leader in the Senate had some pretty 
strong quotes back when President 
Clinton was impeached, and now they 
both say 180-degree opposite things, 
completely contradicting themselves 
about what impeachment should be and 
not be. 
So it is clear, though, from the Con-
stitution—this is the last sentence of 
Article II. It says: ‘‘The President, Vice 
President and all civil officers of the 
United States, shall be removed from 
office on impeachment for, and convic-
tion of, treason’’—that is a crime— 
‘‘bribery’’—that is a crime—‘‘or other 
high crimes’’—those are crimes—‘‘and 
misdemeanors’’—and those are crimes. 
So it is very clear, if you are going to 
impeach and then convict and remove a 
President from office, there need to 
have been crimes. In every one of the 
prior impeachments—there have only 
been a few—the allegations involved 
crimes. 
Perjury, as President Clinton was 
guilty of, is a crime. He was not pros-
ecuted. There still seemed to be a per-
manent feeling that you couldn’t con-
vict a sitting President of a crime. But 
he paid a very heavy price, being dis-
barred for perjury and other costs that 
he had to pay. 
But, unfortunately, we now live in a 
time where right and wrong are sup-
posed to be so relative. It all depends. 
The ends justify the means. That is the 
way you lose a great civilization. That 
is the way you lose moral authority, 
when right and wrong all become rel-
ative. 
In fact, John Adams, as President, in 
1797, our second President, made very 
clear when he said this Constitution is 
meant for a moral and religious people. 
It is wholly inadequate for the govern-
ment of any other. 
If we are going to continue to allow 
schools to teach relativity of right and 
wrong and that ends justify the means, 
you can be mean and evil and hateful 
so long as your hate and evil conduct is 
aimed at somebody that you call hate-
ful. 
So we have developed quite a quan-
dary here in the United States where 
so many people—and I know some have 
said: Oh, I don’t hate anybody. But 
President Trump obviously drives them 
crazy and spurs them to do and say 
things they wouldn’t normally do and 
say, and they certainly didn’t with 
President Clinton when he was caught 
actually lying under oath. 
So we have got to get back to teach-
ing right and wrong. There is a right; 
there is a wrong. 
And I know some people say: Well, I 
am a Christian and, therefore, I know 
God is love, and, therefore, I love ev-
erybody, and that is just the way God 
is. 
But I would direct attention to 
Psalm 6, beginning with verse 16. It 
points out that there are actually some 
things that God hates, and one is a 
lying tongue; one is a heart that de-
vises wicked schemes; one is a person 
who stirs up conflict in the commu-
nity. And, frankly, we had that among 
some people who conspired to elimi-
nate a sitting President. 
Actually, they started out conspiring 
to use taxpayer funds to use the FBI, 
intelligence community, even some de-
fense funds, State Department per-
sonnel and funds, to prevent Donald 
Trump from being elected. And then 
after he was elected, those guns were 
turned on him to try to eliminate him 
from office. 
Obviously, in the current impeach-
ment, there is no treason; there is no 
bribery; there is no high crime; there is 
no misdemeanor. So those pushing 
these Articles of Impeachment, abuse 
of power and obstruction of Congress, 
actually ended up being guilty of both 
of those allegations. 
But they are not crimes; they are not 
high 
crimes; 
they 
are 
not 
mis-
demeanors; they are not bribery. But 
they are guilty of those themselves. 
If you go back, as I am thrilled that 
so many of my friends across the aisle 
are doing now, quoting our Founders, 
they made clear in those early debates 
that you could not, you should not, 
could not be able to remove a President 
or someone because you don’t like the 
way they are doing things or mal-
administration; or you think they are 
not doing something quickly enough 
and so you would say they are ob-
structing Congress; or you don’t like 
the way they did something so you 
would say: Oh, they are abusing their 
power—even though the Obama admin-
istration did the very same things, just 
much worse. 
I thought it was worse when I met 
with a big group of weeping Nigerian 
mothers whose children were kid-
napped and chained to beds, normally 
raped multiple times a day, from what 
we were told. I asked the pastor who 
was trying to assist so many of these 
Nigerian women: Where are the fa-
thers? 
He said: That is part of the tragedy. 
The fathers know that their little girls 
are chained to beds and being raped

every day, and they don’t feel like they 
should stay in a bed when they were 
not able to protect their daughters. 
And I have got to give it to the 
Obama administration. They did hold 
up a sign and say #bringbackourgirls. 
But from what Nigerians in govern-
ment there were telling me, they were 
told: If you really want us to take out 
Boko Haram for you, we have got the 
power; we have got the money; we have 
got the military might; but you are 
going to have to change your laws to 
allow abortion and to allow same-sex 
marriage. And if you are not going to 
do that, we are not going to help you 
like we could with Boko Haram. 
I saw a quote from a Catholic bishop 
in Nigeria who was basically saying: 
Our religious beliefs are not for sale, 
not to President Obama, to John 
Kerry, to America. They are not for 
sale. 
So some of us were concerned that we 
could have helped stop some of the big-
gest atrocities going on in the world by 
radical Islam, but money was withheld. 
Help was withheld in order to achieve a 
political agenda regarding same-sex 
marriage and abortion, according to 
people I met with there in Nigeria, and 
seemed to be bolstered by articles that 
have been read back at that time. 
We also know that this Congress has 
repeatedly, since I have been here, 
made clear we don’t want to be giving 
away money to countries that are 
going to use it for improper purposes. 
Now, of course, that changed a great 
deal during the Obama administration. 
We are willing to give $150 billion to 
people that we knew there is a decent 
chance they were going to be using it 
to kill Americans and to terrorize the 
world, maybe use it, some of it, to pur-
sue nuclear weapons. We have been 
hearing that some of it was used by 
Soleimani to help coordinate attacks 
against Americans around the Middle 
East because they want Americans out 
of the Middle East. 
But I have had a bill in most of the 
Congresses in which I have been a 
Member called the United Nations Vot-
ing Accountability Act, and it put re-
quirements on our money. 
b 1145 
I almost got it passed as an amend-
ment early on. It just simply basically 
says any nation that votes against the 
United States’ position in the U.N. 
more than half of the time shall re-
ceive no assistance of any kind from 
the United States in the subsequent 
year. It seems like in March, some-
where around there, we get the voting 
results from the prior year from the 
U.N. and you can go through and see 
what percentage of the time each coun-
try voted with us and when they voted 
against us. 
I think it would be a great require-
ment to put on our financial aid, and 
as I have said repeatedly since I have 
been here in Congress, you don’t have 
to pay people to hate you, they will do 
it for free. You don’t have to pay them 
to hate you, they are perfectly happy 
to hate you for free. 
And as I found from being very small 
in elementary school, you don’t win 
the respect of a bully by giving them 
your lunch money or giving them 
whatever they demand. You have to 
make them pay a price. Even if you 
don’t win the war, if you hurt them—of 
course, they hurt you worse—they de-
cide they will pick on somebody else 
because they don’t want to get hurt 
themselves, and they know you will 
fight back. 
It is nice here in the United States, 
we are big and strong enough we can 
take it to bullies, terrorists like 
Soleimani, and I thank God that he is 
gone and there will be Americans liv-
ing as a result of him being gone. 
So Trump derangement syndrome 
has caused the House majority to push 
through two Articles of Impeachment. 
We heard for 3 years all of this Russia 
collusion. As most of us know who 
have had legal training, collusion is 
not normally a crime, unless it is with 
regard to stocks. Normally the term is 
used as conspiracy, a criminal con-
spiracy. Somebody came up with a bril-
liant idea of using the word ‘‘collu-
sion,’’ and let’s accuse Donald Trump 
of doing exactly what we have done. 
Why else would the President of the 
United States say to the President of 
Russia, Tell Vladimir I will have a lot 
more flexibility after the next elec-
tion? So they could give in a lot more 
than he even had in the past. 
It is called projecting. You engage in 
improper conduct and then accuse your 
opponent of engaging in what you did. 
That is exactly what we have seen 
here, projecting. 
So you have somebody that gets paid 
off by corrupt entities in Ukraine, and 
they turn around—and when the Presi-
dent of the United States does his job 
and basically says to Ukraine—when 
they elect a president who got elected 
on the basis that he was going to end 
corruption—if you have got evidence of 
corruption, we sure would like to see it 
if it involves American people. You 
know, please, we would like to see 
what you got if it involves Americans. 
There is nothing wrong with that. It is 
perfectly legal. 
If you listen to the contention of 
some people we have heard in Wash-
ington, the contention basically is: 
You may have committed a crime or 
engaged in corrupt activity, if you will 
just run for President then we will de-
fend you, saying, you can’t go after 
that person, he is running for Presi-
dent. You are trying to use your office 
for political purposes. That way some-
body that engages in corruption and 
keeps running for President can never 
be prosecuted because we will defend 
you because you shouldn’t be pros-
ecuted, you are running for President. 
So we can say your position is being 
used for political purposes, where actu-
ally if somebody is engaged in corrup-
tion it ought to be investigated. 
Look what has happened as a result 
of this Ukraine hoax; it scared a lot of 
people to death, including people that 
have worked with Ukraine in our Na-
tional 
Security 
Council 
who 
were 
aware of some of the money passing 
back and forth with Americans. And 
what do they do: Oh, my gosh, what are 
we going to do? We are going the get 
caught up in this investigation. Oh, I 
know, we will claim that when the 
President asked for evidence of corrup-
tion by Americans that that is some 
kind of quid pro quo. And even though 
it is perfectly consistent with the 
President keeping his oath, we will 
allow that to just be hammered over 
and over again, so maybe we can con-
vince the Ukrainian President if he 
provides the evidence of corruption by 
Americans then that means the Presi-
dent is guilty of some crime. 
They have actually been very suc-
cessful in backing President Zelensky 
and Ukraine off of investigating crimes 
of corruption by American individuals. 
That is a real victory. No matter 
what happens on impeachment in the 
Senate, it is a real victory for those 
who were engaged, participated in po-
tential corruption with Ukraine, be-
cause they have been able to turn the 
tables, accuse President Trump, and 
then back the Ukrainian President off 
from investigating their corruption, 
and all of the focus is on President 
Trump instead of on those who may be 
guilty of high crimes, including brib-
ery. It has been interesting to see the 
way that has politically played out. 
We are told constantly, there is 
breaking news, the President should 
not have sat on that money to Ukraine. 
There was nothing illegal about hold-
ing up the money. And if I were Presi-
dent, I would be holding up any money 
that was going to any country that en-
gaged in or where there was rampant 
corruption, as we knew had gone on in 
Ukraine, and require them to produce 
evidence that they were actually try-
ing to stop corruption. Since the cor-
ruption seemed to involve American 
individuals, we have now stopped that 
investigation by Ukraine into the cor-
ruption by Americans, and that means 
that Ukraine is not going to be rid of 
corruption because they haven’t been 
able to adequately pursue it. There is 
no breaking news. There is nothing 
new if people reporting it were fair. 
Again, one good thing from my 
standpoint about the Trump derange-
ment syndrome, we knew there were 
lots of bad actors among deep staters 
in the State Department, in the Intel 
community, in the FBI at the top, at 
the DOJ, some of the top people, but it 
was hard to identify them. Well, be-
cause of the hatred for Donald Trump 
that is just in-articulable, it is so de-
ranging to those that have this level of 
despising the President they keep rais-
ing their heads, so we know who the 
people are that are willing to abuse 
their office and violate their oath to 
the Constitution and loyalty to our 
own government.

family members that are lieutenant 
colonels, I have known so many serving 
in the military, in the Army, but he is 
the only one that I ever heard get high, 
righteous, and mighty and demand to 
be 
called 
lieutenant 
colonel, 
even 
though most days he doesn’t wear a 
uniform. But he certainly wore one so 
people that don’t normally respect the 
military, as well as some of us that do, 
they would go on and on about him 
being a part of the military. 
I asked my staff to get me the tran-
script of his testimony, and I got it be-
fore he had finished, and I am reading 
through and I am going, My word, 
Vindman has been violating his oath to 
his own Constitution. And he certainly 
is not being loyal to the President 
when the President is not committing 
a crime. He is clearly being more loyal 
to Ukraine. 
Then you find out later, well, actu-
ally, he was admonished because a su-
perior officer heard him bad-mouthing 
the United States to some Russians. 
But that is why it came as no surprise 
to me. I was thinking he is more loyal 
to Ukraine than he is to the United 
States. It was no big surprise when I 
found out that Vindman was offered 
the position in Ukraine of defense min-
ister three times, because clearly he 
had shown the Ukrainian leaders that 
he was more loyal to them than he was 
to his own U.S. leaders. That might be 
a good move for him at some point 
since he appears to have more loyalty 
to Ukraine. He may want to take them 
up on that at some point. Obviously, he 
would want to wait until after the im-
peachment trial is over. 
I know there are some that want to 
have live witnesses in the Senate 
Chamber, just make it a full-blown cir-
cus. We should have had live witnesses 
in the House. That is what they did 
during the Clinton impeachment. You 
had fact witnesses that testified before 
the Judiciary Committee, however, we 
had a bunch of opinions coming in. 
We didn’t get the real fact witnesses. 
And of course, the real fact witnesses, 
in my mind, would include Alexandra 
Chalupa, the actions and antics she 
was involved in, along with Eric 
Ciaramella, Abigail Grace, and Sean 
Misko; they had both worked at the 
National Security Council. They have a 
lot of information about work with 
Ukraine, real facts, not just made up 
stuff, but real facts. They would have 
been important to get under oath. I 
still think they would be. 
Andrew McCarthy, just a superb 
former prosecutor, had an article yes-
terday or today talking about the Sen-
ate should just say we are not taking 
up impeachment until you finish. You 
want us to do the investigation that 
you didn’t do in the House because you 
were in such a hurry to get it to the 
Senate. We are not going to do your in-
vestigation, you don’t have a high 
crime, you don’t have a misdemeanor, 
you don’t have treason, you don’t have 
bribery. So why don’t you go back, and 
if you come up with a high crime, mis-
demeanor, bribery, or treason then 
come see us once you have actually got 
evidence of something like that. 
Unfortunately, the House passed im-
peachment even though it didn’t rise to 
the level of impeachable offenses. It is 
an allegation of maladministration, 
which the Founders said should never 
be a basis for impeachment, and that is 
why they didn’t include those types of 
things as a basis for impeachment. 
That is what they have alleged, and 
that is what is now down at the Senate 
straight down the hall. The Senate is 
going to take them up. I agree with my 
friend, Andy McCarthy. The Senate 
should not do the House’s job. 
The House had thousands of pages of 
transcripts. I sure wish they would re-
lease the Inspector General’s deposi-
tion, but of course, that is why they 
did it down in the SCIF. None of the in-
formation we were told was classified. 
The witnesses were told if you have 
any answer that may involve classified 
information, just don’t answer, which 
is also a cue, don’t answer any ques-
tions Republicans ask that you don’t 
want to answer. And that was the rea-
son that so often Republican questions 
were interrupted with instructions to 
the witness by the chairman of Intel. 
That is why Intel did it. They wanted 
to have them in secret even though 
they weren’t classified, have them in a 
place where most of us could not be 
there, including people like those of us 
on the Judiciary Committee, the true 
committee of jurisdiction. 
b 1200 
Then they could leak out what they 
thought might be helpful, even if they 
were leaks that were not accurate 
about what was actually testified to, 
and certainly out of context, to try to 
build this feeling that the President 
had done something terrible. 
Again, this has been going on for 3 
years, the investigation. We have been 
told since the day after President 
Trump was elected that they were 
going to impeach him. They didn’t 
know what for, but they were going to 
find something. 
As Senator SCHUMER said back I be-
lieve it was in 1998 or 1999, during the 
Clinton impeachment, he pointed out 
that the Clinton impeachment—even 
though, as I say, it involved an actual 
crime of perjury, the Clinton impeach-
ment lowered the bar. He said now it 
will be too easy to go after a President 
and impeach him for a minor crime 
like perjury. 
Well, he had no idea how low the bar 
would be made by the Democrats. Now, 
it really is dangerous because they 
have shown you don’t have to have a 
crime. All you have to have is a major-
ity in the House and you can help de-
stroy at least 3-plus years of a Presi-
dent’s term by keeping them under a 
cloud the whole time. 
I didn’t initially support Donald 
Trump as a candidate, but I really 
think people believed if we can just go 
after his family, go after him, go after 
business and friends, 6 months in, he 
will resign. He will say: ‘‘I am going 
back to making money. You can forget 
this. I don’t need this,’’ and walk away, 
but they just didn’t know President 
Trump. He was not going to walk away. 
He could see this country was in big 
trouble. 
As Newt Gingrich has said, if Hillary 
Clinton had been elected, we would 
never have known the extent of the 
corruption in these departments. 
Now we find out even in Defense, as 
Adam Lovinger found, they were pay-
ing hundreds of thousands of dollars, I 
think over a million dollars, to a guy 
named Stefan Halper. It didn’t look 
like there was anything they were get-
ting back, and that was his job. Ulti-
mately, they don’t question Halper’s 
involvement with the Defense Depart-
ment, making all this money, getting 
rich helping the Defense Department as 
a professor over in London. 
Little did Adam Lovinger know that 
he was doing work for a number of de-
partments by trying to set up Carter 
Page, setting up Papadopoulos, and 
just helping out trying to bring down a 
candidate and then bring down a Presi-
dent. 
Even the Defense Department got 
into this effort to prevent the election 
and then to remove a sitting President. 
Historically, that is called a coup 
d’etat. Sometimes, it is without vio-
lence. 
In this case, of course, we found out 
there was violence at Trump events, 
and they blamed Trump for that. Then 
we find out, in a secret recording, a 
Democratic operative said: Yeah, we 
are the ones that hire people to go in 
and start fights so that we can accuse 
Trump supporters of being violent. 
That is also a tactic of the Muslim 
Brotherhood. It is what they have done 
in Egypt. They had the largest peaceful 
uprising in the history of the world 
protesting against a Muslim Brother, 
Morsi, who was shredding their Con-
stitution. They arose, demanded he be 
removed. 
The 
Muslim 
Brotherhood 
went out, started violence, burned 
down some churches and synagogues. 
Then CNN and others faithfully re-
ported that it was the protestors and 
not the Muslim Brotherhood that did 
that. 
But it was amazing what the people 
of Egypt did in their peaceful protests 
against a man shredding the Constitu-
tion, much as our Department of Jus-
tice and FBI top people have done over 
the last 4 years. 
Some have said they only began to 
investigate the Trump campaign in 
July 2016, but we know it was months 
before that. 
It looks like they were probably in-
vestigating different campaigns, trying 
to figure out ways, if that person won 
the Republican nomination, then they 
would come after them as well. I don’t 
have any doubt that would have hap-
pened. 
As former Speaker Gingrich has said, 
we wouldn’t have had any idea just how

corrupt the intel and these other folks 
had become. 
If you want a real fact witness, it 
ought to be Brennan and Clapper. Of 
course, we saw how comfortable they 
have been lying under oath when testi-
fying before Congress. It would be nice 
if they were held accountable. 
It would be nice if Koskinen had been 
held accountable, if Loretta Lynch had 
been held accountable, because right 
now, after all these abuses during the 
Obama years, people got very arrogant 
about their abuses of their positions, 
and nobody has been made to pay. That 
needs to happen. 
But we don’t need to have people who 
are comfortable lying under oath come 
down to testify at a big circus in the 
Senate Chamber. They should adopt ex-
actly what they did under the Clinton 
rules. 
If they have witnesses, depose them, 
use the testimony from the deposi-
tions. Senators from both parties can 
submit questions to be asked, but they 
ought to follow exactly the rules ex-
actly the way they did during the Clin-
ton impeachment. They shouldn’t be 
taking new witnesses. 
Like Andy McCarthy says, the Sen-
ate should not be asked to do the job 
that the House should have done but 
did not. He is exactly right about that. 
I would encourage, Mr. Speaker, and 
I hope, the Senate will hold to those 
rules. They were rules that were de-
manded and agreed to under the Clin-
ton impeachment during the Clinton 
administration. They seemed to have 
been fair rules back then. They ought 
to enforce them exactly the same way: 
no live witnesses in the Chamber. That 
is not the place to have an investiga-
tion. 
There is no high crime; there is no 
misdemeanor. 
None 
of 
those 
were 
charged. 
We heard about bribery. We heard 
about Russia, Russia, Russia. We know 
that the real crimes regarding Russia 
were committed by Christopher Steele; 
potentially the DNC; and the Clinton 
campaign, which paid Fusion GPS, 
which paid Christopher Steele, who 
worked possibly with—he said, yeah, it 
is possible that maybe they worked for 
Putin, the people he got his informa-
tion from. Maybe they were involved 
with Ukraine. We are not sure. 
Obviously, the Hillary Clinton cam-
paign and the DNC paid foreign individ-
uals to interfere in our election. 
It amazes me that even some smart 
reporters have said all this Ukraine 
stuff has been disproven. No, it hasn’t. 
They act as if Russia and Ukraine ac-
tivity—that you couldn’t have mis-
conduct in Russia and also have mis-
conduct in Ukraine. Absolutely you 
could. In fact, we know that countries 
around the world, including China, 
have been trying to affect our elec-
tions. 
For those who have been students of 
Russia and their current highest lead-
er, Putin, Putin didn’t care so much 
who got elected in that election. We 
have heard testimony that they pro-
vided things to help Hillary Clinton as 
well. That doesn’t come out in the 
media a whole lot because it is not con-
sistent with what the alt-left media 
would have you believe. 
But they did things to help Hillary 
Clinton, and they did things to help 
Donald Trump. They were not as much 
interested in who got elected as they 
were about dividing America, and they 
have been extremely successful with 
that. 
America is divided. It is terribly di-
vided. People get mad at each other in 
this Chamber and in committees. It is 
so frustrating. I hope it doesn’t get as 
bad in the Senate as it has here. 
But Putin succeeded. And they didn’t 
have to spend hardly any money, not 
much money, to divide America. 
They have tried for so long, yet here, 
with some unknowing allies, they have 
been able to divide America like hadn’t 
happened in the last 150 years. It is 
tragic. 
I am hopeful that Senators will un-
derstand that the accounts they have 
seen in the media are rarely factual, 
that they are going to have to do a lit-
tle bit of digging, that they are not 
going to be able to take summaries at 
face value, and that they need to do 
some real digging, do some real home-
work to find out exactly what the facts 
are. They will be amazed. 
I am hoping that people who will be 
deposed 
will 
include 
Alexandra 
Chalupa, 
Eric 
Ciaramella, 
Abigail 
Grace, and Sean Misko. I have said 
that for months. 
Some report stories and say: ‘‘Oh, 
Gohmert named the whistleblower.’’ 
No, I didn’t. I named four fact wit-
nesses. Apparently, all these media 
folks must know who the whistle-
blower is to say that I named him. 
I have never named a whistleblower. 
We were told earlier on apparently it 
was a male, but I haven’t named the 
whistleblower ever. I have named peo-
ple I think are fact witnesses and that 
I think would be very good to have in 
depositions in the Senate. I hope they 
will be called. 
I don’t think they need Vindman 
again. They certainly don’t need law 
professors who are so inconsistent and 
just have a law professor act like he is 
really reluctant to talk about impeach-
ment, have people talk about how seri-
ous and how reluctant they are, when, 
actually, like in the case of the Har-
vard professor, he has been talking 
about it since right after the election. 
He has been trying to come up with 
ways to impeach President Trump. 
These were not honest witnesses. 
Then you have people like Turley, 
Professors Turley and Dershowitz, who 
were actually trying to be fair and who 
have been extremely consistent. I have 
had profound disagreements with both 
of those professors on some issues, but 
I have always found them to be honest. 
Some people are shocked that I have 
liberal friends who are Democrats. 
When people are honest, you under-
stand where they are coming from. 
When they haven’t lied to you, you can 
work together. That can happen, and it 
does happen here. 
I hope that this impeachment stuff 
ends so that we can get back to helping 
the President help America, as he has 
been doing for 3 years. He has done an 
extraordinary job. Until the impeach-
ment is over, apparently, that is not 
going to happen. 
For those who believe in the power of 
prayer, we need to be asking God for 
mercy. I would implore people who be-
lieve in the power of prayer in the 
United States: Do not pray for justice 
because we don’t want God’s justice to 
come down on America or we are over. 
b 1215 
We need mercy. We need grace. We 
need direction, and we need to come 
back to the place where we recognize 
there is an absolute right or wrong. It 
comes from a universal source, as C. S. 
Lewis talked about, where he came 
from being an atheist to becoming, ul-
timately, a Christian. 
But the realization started that he 
could never know that there was a fair 
and unfair, a right and wrong, a just or 
unjust, unless there was some ubiq-
uitous universal standard of right and 
wrong. Otherwise, he would be like a 
man born blind. If you have never seen 
the light, how can you know that there 
is light and dark? You have never seen 
it. You have never experienced it. 
So there has to be something placed 
in our hearts that gives us an idea of 
right and wrong, truth and untruth. 
And just because, as he said, some peo-
ple come closer to hitting it right, 
doesn’t mean there is no absolute right 
and wrong, just or unjust. 
We need to get back to the point 
where truth matters, justice matters. 
And when we have officials, as we still 
do—we still have some in our Justice 
Department, in our intelligence depart-
ment or agencies, in the FBI—and we 
do need a new FBI Director, he is part 
of the problem—but until we get back 
to having people in the Justice Depart-
ment, in intel, who are honest, honor-
able, just, upright people, then we will 
continue our slide toward the dustbin 
of history. 
No Nation lasts forever. The United 
States won’t. But my prayer is that we 
will come together and do the things 
that will allow this country to succeed 
as a Republic with people having free-
dom for at least 50 more years. Is that 
too much to ask? 
I know people are worried about cli-
mate change. We won’t make another 
dozen years where we are right now un-
less we have some massive reform 
within our government. We need to 
come together to do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

H323 
January 16, 2020 
1024(a), and the order of the House of 
January 3, 2019, of the following Mem-
ber on the part of the House to the 
Joint Economic Committee: 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York, to rank after Mr. BEYER of Vir-
ginia. 
f 
DISINFORMATION 
IS 
THE 
BIG 
MAMA OF ALL WEAPONS TAR-
GETING OUR NATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. CLEAVER) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, our Na-
tion has gone through quite a tumul-
tuous first 15 days of 2020. We marched 
right up to the brink of war after 
President Donald Trump authorized 
the assassination of Iranian General 
Soleimani. And even though the Ira-
nians did launch a measured attack, it 
is like the argument that the husband 
believed he won with his wife. It ain’t 
over yet. 
Long before the current crisis with 
Iran, our peerless intelligence agencies 
began 
warning 
us 
of 
robust 
cyberattacks 
from 
Russia, 
China, 
North Korea, and, of course, Iran. 
These nations are all hell-bent on 
doing damage to us and using bots, an 
online 
method 
of 
passing 
disinformation to unsuspecting Ameri-
cans, with the ultimate goal of turning 
unsuspecting Americans against each 
other. 
If we do that, we are repeating or al-
lowing the repetition of what the Rus-
sians did in 2016, which is to again med-
dle in our upcoming quadrennial elec-
tion. 
Now, for me, it is difficult to blame 
our enemies for seeking to exploit the 
weaknesses in our society, because it is 
so crystal clear to me that we are 
doing to ourselves what our enemies 
have been unable to do in the last 150 
years. 
Our current extreme political par-
tisanship 
and 
reliance 
on 
social 
media—which is, by the way, littered 
with disinformation—but with that, we 
have allowed a well to be dug into the 
soul of American democracy. Our Na-
tion is wounded and it is a wound that 
our enemies will seek to further infect. 
Sadly, I must give some frightening 
news to our Nation. This, I guess, is a 
matter of national security informa-
tion. Russia has designed and advanced 
the most menacing, yet non-nuclear 
weapons on Earth. Every American 
should know that the blast from this 
bomb can do greater damage to our Na-
tion than the combined marching ar-
mies of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo. 
Mr. Speaker, I say to my fellow 
Americans: We are now threatened by 
the big mama of all weapons. It is 
called disinformation and the delivery 
system is called Facebook and other 
forms of social media. 
In many ways, Congress has been 
complicit in this tribalistic way in 
which we conduct business in our Na-
tion. We have opened wide the door to 
a brazen alien incursion into our elec-
tions. Some Members of this august 
body 
are 
actually 
pushing 
disinformation into the delivery sys-
tem. 
In days gone by, kings and lords built 
their fortresses around deep wells to 
provide cool and clear water for those 
who lived inside the garrison. Strategi-
cally, these wells were inside the walls 
of forts so that at a time of an attack 
from the enemy, the water supply 
could never be blocked so that the life-
saving water, in a time of war, would 
be controlled by those inside the fort. 
Therefore, the inhabitants would not 
be at the mercy of invaders. 
Here is the point: If our great Repub-
lic could be led by our leaders into the 
babbling, cool waters of internal one-
ness and toleration, we will not be vic-
tims of the kind of vicious misinforma-
tion that has been flowing across this 
Nation now for a number of years. We 
would not be vulnerable to the whims 
of those who wish to do us harm. 
Mr. Speaker, I close with an ominous 
note: 
Most 
of 
the 
great 
empires 
throughout the history of the world 
fell into decline not because of some 
new military juggernaut, but because 
of internal fighting and the failure to 
appreciate the amazing ethnic and ra-
cial mosaic that is uniquely ours as 
Americans. 
Will that happen to us? Let me just 
say that we can only be saved by the 
well water of civility and decency in-
side our Nation. We control what is in-
side our Nation. What we need most is 
inside our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that we please ac-
cept and remember and meditate on 
this: Under the right conditions, even 
the most inspirational democracy in 
the history of the world can wane. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM 
‘‘BILL’’ GRAVES WOFFORD, JR. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. FLORES) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor William ‘‘Bill’’ Graves 
Wofford, Jr., of Rockwall, Texas, who 
passed away on October 29, 2019, at the 
age of 95. 
Bill was born on May 1, 1924, in Fort 
Worth, 
Texas 
to 
William 
Graves 
Wofford, Sr., and Margaret Melinda 
Wofford. 
As a very young man, Bill left his 
family to fight in World War II and to 
defend our country. He proudly served 
in both the U.S. Army and the U.S. 
Navy. At the close of the war, at the 
age of 21, Bill returned to the States to 
pursue an education from the Georgia 
Institute of Technology. 
Following graduation, Bill returned 
home to Texas where he embarked on 
his 27-year career alongside business 
partner, Bob Timberlake, to form Tim-
berlake & Wofford, a manufacturing 
representative firm that served the 
north Texas area and experienced great 
success. 
Bill is remembered for his great sense 
of humor and his gentle personality. 
His love of sailing and the outdoors led 
him to help found the Rush Creek 
Yacht Club. 
Bill was not only a leader in his com-
munity, but a friend to all: a loving 
husband, father, and grandfather. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest 
and 
heartfelt 
condolences 
to 
the 
Wofford family. We also lift up the 
family and friends of Bill Wofford in 
our prayers. 
I have requested that the United 
States flag be flown over our Nation’s 
Capitol to honor his life, legacy, and 
his service to our country. 
As I close today, I ask all Americans 
to continue praying for our country 
during these difficult times, for the 
brave men and women who serve in our 
military who protect us, and for our 
first responders who protect us here at 
home. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DEPUTY SHERIFF 
MATTHEW RYAN JONES 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Matthew Ryan Jones of 
Waco, Texas. 
Deputy Sheriff Jones was killed on 
October 11, 2019 in the line of duty as 
he assisted a motorist on the side of an 
area highway. 
Matt was born on February 7, 1989, in 
Waco, Texas, to Ronnie and Debbie 
Coleman Jones. He graduated from 
Connally High School and the Texas 
State Technical College in Waco before 
joining the Falls County Sheriff’s Of-
fice in August of 2015. 
Matt bravely served his community 
for 4 years, most recently being named 
the department’s canine deputy. Fel-
low first responders have sung the 
praises of their fallen brother stating 
that: Matt ‘‘never backed down from a 
challenge and understood the nature of 
policing in a small community.’’ 
Matt was not only a proud public 
servant, he was a friend to all, a loving 
husband, and an avid outdoorsman. 
Matt enjoyed spending time in nature, 
hunting, fishing, and riding his ATV. 
Mr. Speaker, Matt’s life was defined 
by his service to his community. He 
will be forever remembered by his com-
munity as a husband, a son, a brother, 
and a selfless public servant. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest 
and heartfelt condolences to the Jones 
family. We also lift up the family and 
friends of Matthew in our prayers. 
I have requested the United States 
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol 
to honor his life, legacy, and his serv-
ice to our central Texas community. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue to pray for our country, for 
our military men and women who pro-
tect us overseas, and for our first re-
sponders who keep us safe here at 
home.

S255 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 16, 2020 
No. 10 
Senate 
The Senate met at 9:45 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal King, ruler of all nature, 
thank you for the opportunity to serve 
You and country. Help us to give gov-
ernment what belongs to government 
as we render to You our faithful stew-
ardship. 
Lord, guide our lawmakers to make 
right choices in challenging times. En-
able them to feel Your presence and be-
come lights to a dark world. Open their 
eyes to see Your daily gifts and bless-
ings, infusing them with a spirit of 
gratitude. 
Protect our Nation from sea to shin-
ing sea, as You empower us to live for 
Your glory. 
We pray in Your wonderful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to address the 
Senate for 1 minute in morning busi-
ness. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
DAY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
today is a very important day that we 
recognize once a year—National Reli-
gious Freedom Day. It is a day when 
we celebrate America’s longstanding 
commitment to religious freedom. 
The First Amendment to the Con-
stitution protects that right for Ameri-
cans. Unfortunately, this fundamental 
right we have great respect for in the 
United States is under attack inter-
nationally in many autocratic coun-
tries. 
Around the world, people are being 
persecuted for their faith by authori-
tarian 
dictatorships 
and 
terrorist 
groups. Countries like China, North 
Korea, and Russia restrict their citi-
zens’ rights to practice their own reli-
gion. 
China, for example, plans to enforce 
additional 
restrictions 
on 
religious 
groups starting February 1. That is al-
ready on top of a very bad record they 
have for religious freedom. That is in 
regard to China, but it would apply to 
all countries. 
I have legislation to require the 
United States to work to block World 
Bank projects in wealthy countries 
like China and Russia that abuse reli-
gious freedoms. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
it took 4 weeks—4 weeks, but the 
Democratic majority in the House of 
Representatives is finally ready—fi-
nally ready—to defend their impeach-
ment of the President of the United 
States. 
After weeks of delay, the Speaker of 
the House decided yesterday that a 
trial could finally go forward. She 
signed the impeachment papers. That 
took place at a table with a political 
slogan stuck onto it. And they posed— 
they 
posed—afterward 
for 
smiling 
photos. And the Speaker distributed 
souvenir pens—souvenir pens—to her 
own colleagues, emblazoned with her 
golden signature that literally came in 
on silver platters. The pens literally 
came in on silver platters. There were 
golden pens on silver platters, a sou-
venir to celebrate the moment. 
I seem to remember Democrats fall-
ing over themselves to say they did not 
see impeachment as a long-sought po-
litical win. House Democrats said over 
and over that they recognized the grav-
ity and the seriousness of this action, 
and, of course, they had only come to 
it reluctantly. Well, nothing says seri-
ousness and sobriety like handing out 
souvenirs, as though this were a happy 
bill-signing instead of the gravest proc-
ess in our Constitution. 
This final display neatly distilled the 
House’s partisan process into one per-
fect visual. It was a transparently par-
tisan performance from beginning to 
end. 
That is why they sped through a 
slapdash inquiry in 12 weeks, when pre-
vious Presidential impeachments came 
after months, if not years, of investiga-
tions and hearings. That is why the 
House cut short their own inquiry, de-
clined to pursue their own subpoenas, 
and denied the President due process, 
but now—now they want the Senate to 
redo their homework and rerun the in-
vestigation. 
That is why our colleague the Demo-
cratic leader told the press that what-
ever happens next, as long as he can 
weaponize the trial to hurt the Repub-
licans in the 2020 election, ‘‘it’s a win- 
win.’’ That is what the Democratic 
leader of the Senate said.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S256 
January 16, 2020 
That is why the Speaker of the House 
apparently saw nothing strange about 
celebrating the third Presidential im-
peachment in American history with 
souvenirs and posed for photographs— 
souvenirs and posed photographs. 
That pretty well sums it up. That is 
what the process has been thus far, but 
it is not what this process will be going 
forward. 
The Founding Fathers who crafted 
and ratified our Constitution knew 
that our Nation might sometimes fall 
prey to the kind of dangerous fac-
tualism and partisanship that has con-
sumed—literally consumed the House 
of Representatives. 
The Framers set up the Senate spe-
cifically to act as a check against the 
short-termism and the runaway pas-
sions to which the House of Represent-
atives might fall victim. 
Alexander Hamilton worried that 
‘‘the demon of faction’’ would ‘‘extend 
his scepter’’ over the House majorities 
‘‘at certain seasons.’’ That is what 
Alexander Hamilton said. He feared for 
the viability of the government estab-
lished by the Constitution if, blinded 
by factualism, the House of Represent-
atives would abuse the power of im-
peachment to serve nakedly partisan 
goals rather than long-term interests 
of the American people and their Re-
public, but, fortunately, they did some-
thing about it. 
They did not give both the power to 
impeach and the power to remove to 
the House. They divided the power and 
placed the final decision on removal 
over here in the Senate. 
This body, this Chamber, exists pre-
cisely—precisely so we can look past 
the daily dramas and understand how 
our actions will reverberate for genera-
tions; so we can put aside animal re-
flexes and animosity and coolly con-
sider how to best serve our country in 
the long run; so we can break factional 
fevers before they jeopardize the core 
institutions of our government. 
As Hamilton put it, only the Senate, 
with ‘‘confidence enough in its own sit-
uation,’’ can ‘‘preserve, unawed and 
uninfluenced, 
the 
necessary 
impar-
tiality between an individual accused, 
and the representatives of the people, 
his accusers.’’ 
The House’s hour is over. The Sen-
ate’s time is at hand. It is time for this 
proud body to honor our founding pur-
pose. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on an entirely different matter, before 
we turn to the trial in earnest, the 
Senate has one more major accom-
plishment to deliver to the American 
people. 
Yesterday we began floor consider-
ation of the most significant update to 
the North American trade policy in 
nearly 30 years. In just a couple of 
hours, we are going to pass the USMCA 
and send it to President Trump for his 
signature. 
It was back in 2018 when the Trump 
administration finalized its talks with 
the Governments of Mexico and Can-
ada. This has been a major priority for 
the President and for many of us in 
both Houses of Congress. 
That is because American livelihoods 
in every corner of every State depend 
on these critical trading relationships. 
Farmers, growers, cattlemen, manufac-
turers, small businesses, big busi-
nesses—this is a major step for our 
whole country. 
In the 26 years since the ratification 
of NAFTA, trade with Mexico and Can-
ada has come to directly support 12 
million 
American 
jobs—12 
million 
workers and their families who depend 
on robust trade with our North Amer-
ican neighbors. Our neighbors to the 
north and south purchase half a tril-
lion dollars in American goods and 
services every single year. That in-
cludes more than a quarter of all the 
food and agricultural products we ex-
port. Take my home State of Kentucky 
as an example. Mexico and Canada buy 
$300 million of agricultural exports 
from Kentucky growers and producers 
every year. They buy $9.9 billion of our 
State’s manufacturing exports—and on 
and on. Commerce with our neighbors 
is essential across the board. 
No wonder experts estimate that 
USMCA would create 176,000 new Amer-
ican jobs. No wonder they predict it 
will yield tens of billions of dollars in 
economic growth. No wonder farmers, 
ranchers, steelworkers, and manufac-
turers across our country have been so 
eager to see the USMCA signed, sealed, 
and delivered. In one recent letter, 
Kentucky farmers told me: ‘‘We need 
the agreement ratified, and we need it 
to happen now.’’ 
I know my colleagues have been 
hearing the same thing from their 
home States. Republicans, Democrats, 
Senators, Representatives—our incom-
ing has been the same: Get this deal 
passed. Failure is not an option. 
Of course, for far too long, our coun-
terparts in the House kept all these 
Americans waiting. It took more than 
a year and a lot of pressure from Sen-
ate Republicans to get the Speaker of 
the House to stop blocking the trade 
deal and finally let the House vote on 
it. Late last year, she finally relented. 
It passed by a big bipartisan margin, of 
course, and I now expect that kind of 
vote will repeat itself here in the Sen-
ate. 
I am especially grateful to our col-
leagues and counterparts who got this 
across the finish line: to the U.S. Trade 
Representative, Bob Lighthizer, and 
his hard-working team, led by his chief 
of staff, Jamieson Greer; to Chairman 
GRASSLEY for leading the bipartisan ef-
fort in the Senate Finance Committee 
and his trade team, led by Nasim 
Fussell; to Ranking Member WYDEN 
and his trade counsel, Jayme White, 
and all of our Finance Committee col-
leagues and staff; and to the chairmen 
of our other committees of jurisdiction 
who worked nimbly to get this done. 
I want to thank the exceptional 
Cloakroom staff—in particular, Chris-
topher Tuck. 
I would like to thank members of my 
own team whose efforts were invalu-
able, most especially my chief eco-
nomic policy council, Jay Khosla, 
whose role in securing this agreement 
has 
been 
absolutely 
essential; 
Ali 
Nepola in my personal office; Erica 
Suares and my leadership policy advis-
ers; and, of course, their fearless lead-
ers, Sharon Soderstrom, my chief of 
staff, and my deputy chief of staff for 
policy, Scott Raab. 
Of course, I am most grateful to 
President Trump for prioritizing, nego-
tiating, and delivering on this major 
promise. Today the Senate will send 
this landmark agreement to the Presi-
dent’s desk—a big bipartisan win. It 
comes the very same week as President 
Trump also signed phase one of his ad-
ministration’s trade agreement with 
China—quite a week of substantive ac-
complishments for the Nation, for the 
President, and for our international 
trade. Both of these measures will only 
add to all the other Republican policies 
of the past 3 years that have helped 
generate this historically strong eco-
nomic moment for working Americans 
and for their families. 
I would urge every one of our col-
leagues to join me in voting to pass the 
USMCA.

S257 
January 16, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
this is a serious, solemn, and historic 
day. The events that will take place 
this afternoon have happened only 
twice before in our grand Nation’s 250- 
year history. The Chief Justice will 
swear in every U.S. Senator to partici-
pate as a court of impeachment in a 
trial of the President of the United 
States. 
Yesterday, the Senate received no-
tice that the House of Representatives 
has two Articles of Impeachment to 
present. The House managers will ex-
hibit those two articles today at noon. 
The first article charges the President 
with abuse of power: coercing a foreign 
leader into interfering in our elections, 
thereby using the powers of the Presi-
dency, the most powerful public office 
in the Nation, to benefit himself rather 
than the public interest. The second 
charges the President with obstruction 
of 
Congress 
for 
an 
unprecedented 
blockade of the legislature’s ability to 
investigate those very matters. Let me 
talk about each one. 
The first is so serious. Some of our 
Republican colleagues have said—some 
of the President’s own men have said: 
Yeah, he did it, but it doesn’t matter; 
it is not impeachable. Some of them 
even failed to say—many of my Repub-
lican 
colleagues, 
amazingly—it 
is 
wrong. 
Let me ask the American people: Do 
we want foreign leaders helping deter-
mine who is our President, our Sen-
ators, our Congressmen, our Governors, 
our legislators? That is what President 
Trump’s argument will be: that it is 
OK to do that, that there is nothing 
wrong with it, that it is perfect. 
Hardly anything is more serious than 
powers outside the borders of the 
United States determining, influencing 
elections inside the United States. It is 
bad enough to do it but even worse to 
blackmail a country of aid that was le-
gally allocated to get them to do it. It 
is low. It is not what America has been 
all about. 
The second charge as well. The Presi-
dent says he wants the truth, but he 
blocks every attempt to get the facts. 
All the witnesses we are asking for—he 
could have allowed them to testify in 
the House. They wanted them. The 
President is blocking. 
Again, the American people—just 
about all of them—are asking the ques-
tion: What is the President hiding? 
What is he afraid of? If he did nothing 
wrong, why didn’t he let the witnesses 
and the documents come forward in the 
House of Representatives? 
Put another way, the House of Rep-
resentatives has accused the President 
of trying to shake down a foreign lead-
er for personal gain, deliberately solic-
iting foreign interference in our elec-
tions—something the Founding Fa-
thers greatly feared—and then doing 
everything he could to cover it up. 
The gravity of these charges is self- 
evident to anyone who is not self-inter-
ested. If proved, they are not petty 
crimes or politics as usual but a deep, 
wounding injury to democracy itself, 
precisely the conduct most feared by 
the Founders of our Constitution. 
We as Senators, Democrats and Re-
publicans, must rise to the occasion, 
realizing the seriousness of the charges 
and the solemnity of an impeachment 
proceeding. The beginning of the im-
peachment trial today will be largely 
ceremonial, but soon our duty will be 
constitutional. The constitutional duty 
is to conduct a fair trial, and then, as 
our oaths this afternoon command, 
Senators must ‘‘do impartial justice.’’ 
Senators must ‘‘do impartial justice.’’ 
The weight of that oath will fall on our 
shoulders. Our ability to honor it will 
be preserved in history. 
Yesterday evening, I was gratified to 
hear the Republican leader, at least in 
part of his speech, ask the Senate to 
rise to the occasion. I was glad to hear 
him say so. For somebody who has 
been partisan—deeply, strongly, and al-
most 
unrelentingly 
partisan—for 
2 
months, he said something that could 
bring us together: The Senate should 
rise to the occasion. 
Far more important than saying it is 
doing it. What does ‘‘doing it’’ mean? 
The best way for the Senate to rise to 
the occasion would be to retire par-
tisan considerations and to have every-
one agree on the parameters of a fair 
trial. The best way for the Senate to 
rise to the occasion would be for Demo-
crats and Republicans to agree on rel-
evant witnesses and relevant docu-
ments, not run the trial with votes of a 
slim majority, not jam procedures 
through, not define ‘‘rising to the occa-
sion’’ as ‘‘doing things my way,’’ which 
is what the majority leader has done 
thus far, but, rather, a real and honest 
and bipartisan agreement on a point we 
all know must be confronted: that we 
must—we must—have witnesses and 
documents in order to have a fair trial. 
A trial without witnesses is not a 
trial. A trial without documents is not 
a trial. That is why every completed 
impeachment trial in our Nation’s his-
tory—every single one that has gone to 
completion—15, have all included wit-
nesses. The majority leader claims to 
believe in precedent. That is the prece-
dent: witnesses. There is no deviation. 
Let us hope we don’t have one this 
time. 
Over the centuries, Senators have 
stood where we stand today, confronted 
with the responsibility of judging the 
removal of the President. They rightly 
concluded they were obligated to seek 
the truth. They were under a solemn 
obligation to hear the facts before ren-
dering a final judgment. 
The leader—incorrectly, in my judg-
ment—complained the House was doing 
short-termism and rush. The leader is 
trying to do the exact same thing in 
the Senate. The very things he con-
demns the House Democrats for, he 
seems bent on doing. Condemning 
short-termism? Are we going to have a 
full trial? Condemning the rush? Are 
we going to allow the time for wit-
nesses and documents or is the leader 
going to try to rush it through? At the 
very same time, out of the other side of 
his mouth, he condemns the House—in-
correctly, in my judgment—for doing 
it. 
Another thing about the importance 
of witnesses and documents, the leader 
has still not given a good argument 
about why we shouldn’t have witnesses 
and documents. He complains about 
process and pens and signing cere-
monies but still does not address the 
charges against the President and why 
we shouldn’t have witnesses and docu-
ments. 
We are waiting. Rise to the occasion. 
Remember the history. That is what 
the leader said he would do last night, 
and I was glad to hear it, but he must 
act, not talk about rising to the occa-
sion and then doing the very same 
things he condemns the House for. 
If my colleagues have any doubts 
about the case for witnesses and docu-
ments in a Senate trial, the stunning 
revelations this week should put those 
to rest. We have new information about 
a plot by the President’s attorney and 
his associates to oust an American am-
bassador and potentially with the 
‘‘knowledge and consent’’ of the Presi-
dent, 
pressure 
Ukrainian 
President 
Zelensky to announce an investigation 
of one of the President’s political ri-
vals. The effort to remove Ambassador 
Yovanovitch by Lev Parnas and Mr. 
Giuliani is now the subject of an offi-
cial probe by the Government of 
Ukraine. 
My friends, this information is not 
extraneous; it is central to the charges 
against the President. We have a re-
sponsibility to call witnesses and sub-
poena documents that will shed light 
on the truth here. God forbid we rush 
through this trial and only afterward 
the truth comes out. 
How will my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle feel if they rushed it 
through and then even more evidence 
comes out? We have seen lots come 
out. There has barely been a week 
where significant new evidence, further 
making the House case, hasn’t come 
out as strong as the House case was to 
begin with. 
Here is what Alexander Hamilton 
warned of in the Federalist 65. He said: 
‘‘The greatest danger is that the deci-
sion [in an impeachment trial] will be 
regulated more by the comparative 
strength of parties than by the real 
demonstration of innocence or guilt.’’ 
Alexander Hamilton, even before the 
day political parties were as strong as 
they are today, wanted us to come to-
gether. The leader wants to do things 
on his own, without any Democratic 
input, but, fortunately, we have the 
right to demand votes and to work as 
hard as we can for a fair trial, a full 
trial, a trial with witnesses, a trial 
with documents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S258 
January 16, 2020 
The Founders anticipated that im-
peachment trials would always be buf-
feted by the winds of politics, but they 
gave the power to the Senate anyway 
because they believed the Chamber was 
the only place where impartial justice 
of the President could truly be sought. 
In the coming days, these eventful 
and important coming days, each of 
us—each of us will face a choice about 
whether to begin this trial in search of 
the truth or in the service of the Presi-
dent’s desire to cover up and rush 
things through. The Senate can either 
rise to the occasion or demonstrate 
that the faith of our Founders was mis-
placed in what they considered a grand 
institution. As each of us swears an 
oath this afternoon, let every Sen-
ator—every Senator reflect on these 
questions. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor of the Senate today 
at a moment that will be remembered 
in history. In just a few hours, the 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court will 
come to this Chamber and will be 
sworn in as the Presiding Officer in the 
impeachment trial of President Donald 
John Trump. He will then administer 
an oath to each Member of the U.S. 
Senate. It is an oath that is included in 
our Senate manual. It is very brief, 
only 35 words, and it bears repeating 
for the record at this moment. 
Each Senator will be asked to make 
the following oath and affirmation: ‘‘I 
solemnly swear that in all things ap-
pertaining to the trial of the impeach-
ment of Donald John Trump, now pend-
ing, I will do impartial justice accord-
ing to the Constitution and laws: so 
help me God.’’ 
In just 35 words, that oath binds all 
of us—Republicans and Democrats— 
who swear by that oath to do impartial 
justice. The Founding Fathers, and 
others, could have been much more 
elaborate in describing the process we 
face, but in its simplicity, this oath 
really tells us what we will face in the 
coming days. 
I believe more than ever, starting on 
Tuesday, when the impeachment trial 
begins in earnest on the floor of the 
Senate, America will be watching. 
Many Americans have busy lives—per-
sonal, private, family, and profes-
sional—and don’t tune in to the polit-
ical events of the moment as many of 
us do, but I think more and more will 
be watching come Tuesday. They are 
going to see a historic moment, only 
the third time in history when a Presi-
dent of the United States faces im-
peachment. What will they find? Will 
they find an effort to do impartial jus-
tice? Will they find partisanship? Will 
they find a real trial? 
I think it is important for us to real-
ize that a real trial includes evidence. 
As a lawyer, I brought many cases to 
trial, a few of them to verdict. I had to 
prepare my case, not just my theory of 
the law or statement of facts but proof, 
real proof that came from documents 
and witnesses. That is what a real trial 
is about. Unfortunately, on the other 
side, the majority leader has suggested 
we don’t need witnesses and that it is 
only evidence of the weakness of the 
impeachment charges. I think he is 
wrong. 
As the Democratic leader said this 
morning, history will prove him wrong 
because in impeachment trial after im-
peachment trial, evidence and wit-
nesses have been presented. That is the 
tradition and the precedent of the U.S. 
Senate. 
If there is an effort to short circuit 
that, to eliminate the witnesses and 
the evidence, I think it will be obvious 
to the American people who are fol-
lowing this what is underway. 
In this morning’s newspapers, it was 
reported that the President’s defense 
team has been ready, anxious, if you 
will, for this impeachment trial to 
begin and equally anxious to end it as 
quickly as possible. I hope they don’t 
prevail in that sentiment because a 
race to judgment may not serve the 
cause of impartial justice. We believe 
that the House managers should be al-
lowed to make their presentation, and 
they will, and the President’s defense 
team, as well. We believe that Members 
of the Senate should hear those argu-
ments and then proceed to consider 
any additional evidence. 
What kind of evidence may be rel-
evant? As Senator SCHUMER, of New 
York, mentioned just a few minutes 
ago, it seems that every day there 
unfolds another chapter in this story. 
Every day we learn of the efforts of the 
President’s self-described personal at-
torney, Rudolph Giuliani, to appeal di-
rectly to the leadership of Ukraine to 
initiate a political investigation of the 
Biden 
family, 
to 
serve 
President 
Trump’s political interest in the 2020 
Presidential campaign. 
We have also heard repeatedly on the 
floor that there have been no allega-
tions of anything that was illegal or 
criminal on the part of the President. 
The standard in the Constitution for 
impeachment does not require the vio-
lation of a Federal crime. Our Con-
stitution was written before any stat-
utes creating Federal crimes had been 
created. 
Rather, 
the 
phrase 
‘‘high 
crimes and misdemeanors’’ was used as 
a standard to be imposed on the Presi-
dent. 
But we just received information in 
the last 24 hours from the General Ac-
countability Office, which does raise 
very serious concern about illegality of 
the President’s action in withholding 
the funds appropriated by Congress to 
support the Ukrainian defense efforts 
against the invasion of Russian troops 
by Vladimir Putin and their country. 
As a Member of the Senate Appro-
priations Committee, ranking member 
of the Defense Subcommittee, I can re-
call when we, on a bipartisan basis, de-
cided to provide additional assistance 
to Ukraine in the form of hundreds of 
millions of U.S. tax dollars so that 
they could defend themselves against 
the invasion of Vladimir Putin. That 
money was appropriated and we be-
lieved would be sent in a timely way to 
the Ukrainians to defend their own 
country. Little did we know that 
money would become part of the bar-
gaining between President Trump and 
the President of Ukraine as to this po-
litical investigation. It turns out that 
money was withheld until the very last 
moment. In fact, as I was offering an 
amendment in the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee, and I was told that 
the night before—late the night be-
fore—the President finally released the 
funds. 
Questions were raised by Senator 
VAN HOLLEN to the Government Ac-
countability Office as to whether or 
not it was legal or illegal for the ad-
ministration to withhold those funds. 
We have now received the statement 
from the General Accountability Of-
fice. They have held that the Presi-
dent’s withholding of funds to Ukraine 
violated Federal law. The Government 
Accountability Office has a sterling 
reputation as a nonpartisan watchdog 
with taxpayers’ dollars. GAO’s legal 
opinion today concludes that President 
Trump and his administration violated 
the law by putting a hold on military 
aid to Ukraine while that country was 
trying to defend itself against an inva-
sion ordered by Vladimir Putin. 
This is an important ruling that de-
serves a thorough hearing in the im-
peachment trial. It should be part of 
the evidence of wrongdoing by the 
President, especially as it relates to 
the alleged abuse of power. I also hope 
this ruling will convince the adminis-
tration to speed the additional delivery 
of $250 million in military aid, which 
the Congress has also sent to Ukraine. 
I am going to yield the floor because 
I know one of my colleagues is coming 
to speak. 
In just a few hours, this Chamber will 
be transformed. As we noted yesterday, 
at about 5:38 p.m., when the clerk of 
the House arrived with the Articles of 
Impeachment, there was a change in 
the atmosphere and environment of 
this Chamber, and I can sense it even 
today. We realize we are only moments 
away from a historic meeting of this 
Chamber on the issue of Presidential 
impeachment. When we take that oath 
of office, each and every one of us, 
swearing impartial justice, we need to 
remember that not only is America 
watching but history will hold us ac-
countable. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE 
AGREEMENT 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, soon 
the Senate will vote on the final pas-
sage of the new North American Free 
Trade Agreement. I am going to make 
just a few remarks. I know Senator 
TOOMEY
is here to make remarks. 
Later, he is going to offer, I believe, 
some procedural requests.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S259 
January 16, 2020 
The new NAFTA is a good deal for 
American workers because Democrats 
in this body and Democrats in the 
other body stopped the Trump adminis-
tration from going ahead with business 
as usual on trade enforcement. There 
has even been an effort by several 
Members on the other side in the Sen-
ate to actually block enforcement dol-
lars. With Chairman GRASSLEY’s help, 
we were able to prevent that. 
If you write a trade agreement with 
weak 
enforcement, 
particularly 
on 
labor and environmental issues, my 
view is you sell out American workers 
and key industries, whether it is auto-
mobiles, whether it is technology, or 
whether it is manufacturing. Basically, 
you set up a race to the bottom on 
cheap wages and the treatment of 
labor. 
I particularly want to thank Senator 
BROWN, my colleague from Ohio, who 
for decades has led the fight for tough 
trade enforcement. We spoke yesterday 
on the floor about our effort. We 
worked on this side of the aisle, but we 
reached out to a lot of Senators on the 
other side of the aisle as well. 
I just want to give an example of 
what the Brown-Wyden trade enforce-
ment package does. In the past, it 
would take almost to eternity to bring 
trade enforcement action. I spelled out 
yesterday how the Brown-Wyden en-
forcement 
package 
speeds 
up 
the 
timeline for tough trade enforcement 
by more than 300 percent. That, in my 
view, throws a real lifeline—an actual 
lifeline to communities that are wor-
ried about whether they are going to 
have an economic heartbeat in the 
days ahead. 
I also wanted to mention—and I am 
then going to yield to my colleague, 
and we are going to use this time so 
that everybody gets a chance to make 
some remarks—that this is the first- 
ever trade agreement in which the 
United States locks in strong rules on 
digital trade and technology. Back 
when the first NAFTA came about, you 
didn’t have Senators with smartphones 
in their pocket. You didn’t have the 
internet as the shipping lane of the 21st 
century. What we did in this part of 
the bill, which was really bipartisan, is 
we protected intellectual property. We 
prohibited shakedowns of data belong-
ing to innovative American companies, 
and I was especially involved in mak-
ing sure that we drew on established 
U.S. law to defend the small tech-
nology entrepreneurs working to build 
successful companies in a field domi-
nated by a small number of Goliaths. 
These rules on technology and trade 
ought to be the cornerstones of our 
trade policy in the years ahead because 
those rules on technology protect 
every 
single 
American 
industry— 
healthcare, 
manufacturing, 
agri-
culture, you name it. It is how the 
United States also is going to fight 
back against authoritarian govern-
ments that use the internet as a tool to 
repress their own people, bully Amer-
ican businesses and workers, and med-
dle with the free speech rights of Amer-
ican citizens. 
The bottom line here is that my col-
league who sits right behind me, Sen-
ator BROWN, was key to producing a 
bill that had the provisions and the 
prerequisite to getting a law, frankly, 
with tough trade law enforcement that 
brought, literally, dozens of Members 
of both the Senate and the House over 
to support this. I want to thank him 
and wrap up by saying—I am not sure 
that he is with us today here in the 
Senate Gallery—that Ambassador Bob 
Lighthizer deserves a special thanks 
today. He may be off around the world 
somewhere talking to additional trade 
ministers, looking for other opportuni-
ties to come up with tough future-ori-
ented trade agreements. Ambassador 
Lighthizer is the hardest working man 
in the trade agreement business. I want 
to thank him for all his work. I have a 
difference of opinion with my colleague 
from Pennsylvania on these issues. We 
may have some procedure, but I think 
you are going to see Senators handle 
these issues over the next 20 minutes in 
a way that reflects the seriousness of 
this issue. 
I yield the floor. 
I know the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania will speak next. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
want to thank the ranking member of 
our committee for all of the work that 
he has put into this effort, even though 
I disagree in some important respects. 
One thing I want to talk about this 
morning is the process under which we 
are going to consider and probably pass 
this legislation. We are considering 
this legislation under trade promotion 
authority. That refers to another bill— 
a law, actually—that we passed some 
time ago that expedites the process, 
forbids Senators from offering amend-
ments, and allows passage of the legis-
lation to occur with a simple majority 
vote—51 out of 100 instead of the usual 
60-vote threshold. That is what trade 
promotion authority makes possible. 
It seems to me that it is very impor-
tant that any legislation we consider 
under trade promotion authority be 
compliant with trade promotion au-
thority, because, if it is not, if we allow 
extraneous provisions, for instance, 
then, we are circumventing the normal 
legislative process, we are circum-
venting the 60-vote threshold, and we 
are abusing trade promotion authority. 
One of the reasons that is so impor-
tant is that this is a delegated author-
ity. I remind my colleagues that trade 
policy is clearly, unambiguously as-
signed to Congress in the Constitution. 
It is our responsibility to manage 
trade, and legislation is obviously and 
undoubtedly exclusively granted to 
Congress in the Constitution. So our 
branch of government has exclusive re-
sponsibility for trade and legislating. 
What do we have here? We have a 
piece of legislation that deals with 
trade. When we choose to delegate our 
responsibility to the executive branch, 
it is very important to me that we in-
sist that delegated authority be exer-
cised properly and that the legislation 
that follows from it comply with the 
law. 
What I want to raise is a concern 
about one of several—but one respect, 
in particular—in which the legislation 
we are considering today does not, in 
fact, comply with the trade promotion 
authority under which this legislation 
is being considered. Specifically, I am 
going to zero in on a certain aspect of 
some of the spending that occurs in 
this bill. 
By way of background, I think it is 
important to know that the Senate has 
never passed a spending bill with a sim-
ple majority vote. I don’t think that 
has ever happened in modern times 
since we established the 60-vote thresh-
old on any piece of legislation. 
We don’t do discretionary appropria-
tions with a simple majority vote be-
cause it has been the collective will of 
this body for decades that responsi-
bility should occur at a 60-vote thresh-
old and should be subject to amend-
ments. 
Not only that, but we have discre-
tionary spending in this bill and this is 
the first time that any trade imple-
menting legislation has ever spent 
money. Of the 17 trade bills that we 
have considered in recent decades 
under fast-track authority, none of 
them have ever contained any kind of 
appropriations, any kind of govern-
ment spending. It is not that there is 
no spending necessary for the imple-
mentation of these other agreements. 
There was. Yet that spending always 
ran separately in a different bill, in a 
different piece of legislation, and that 
piece of legislation was subject to 
amendment and a 60-vote threshold. 
Now, why is that? 
It is in order to comply with the 
trade promotion authority. It is in 
order to comply with the conditions of 
granting an expedited process. 
What the trade promotion authority 
reads, among other things, is that any 
provision in this implementing legisla-
tion must be strictly necessary or ap-
propriate for the implementation of 
the trade agreement. Well, spending is 
not strictly necessary for this purpose 
because it can occur in a separate bill, 
and that is the way it has always been 
done. 
If we allow this to proceed on this 
basis—exactly as is contemplated—we 
are really going to dramatically under-
mine the 60-vote threshold for spend-
ing, and there is spending in this bill. 
There is $843 million—almost $1 bil-
lion—and it gets worse. It gets worse 
because this spending has an emer-
gency spending designation. So it is 
not only that we are spending money 
in a way that has never been done be-
fore, and it is not only that we are 
spending money in a trade imple-
menting bill, which we have never done 
before, but now we have decided to call 
it emergency spending.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S260 
January 16, 2020 
Why is it that it gets an emergency 
spending designation? Why did some-
one bother to give this spending an 
emergency designation? There is a sim-
ple reason. 
Under our budget rules, if you label 
spending as an emergency, then you 
don’t have to offset that spending if 
you exceed our agreed-upon statutory 
spending caps. We are at the caps, and 
I gather that the folks who wrote this 
don’t want to have to offset this new 
spending with a reduction anywhere 
else in the enormous budget of our Fed-
eral Government. So they have des-
ignated it as emergency spending. 
This is clearly an abuse of the use of 
an emergency designation. I mean, we 
designate emergency spending when we 
have to respond to a tornado or to a 
flood or to an outbreak of Ebola. These 
sorts of things are unpredictable, sud-
den, devastating. Those are actual 
emergencies. This is what that provi-
sion is there for. Yet here we are, using 
it for things like doubling the staffing 
salary budget for the U.S. trade office. 
That is not an emergency. It is not 
even close. 
So I am going to offer a point of 
order. It is very, very simple, and it is 
very, very narrow. It is a very, very 
small thing. What I am going to do is 
to raise a point of order against the 
emergency designation of one of the 
spending lines in this appropriation. I 
could do it for all of them. I could raise 
an issue about the fact that there is 
spending in the first place, but I am 
not going to do that. I am going to 
take a very, very modest and narrow 
approach. 
I suggest that we raise a point of 
order against the emergency designa-
tion—against $50 million of the hun-
dreds of millions of dollars alto-
gether—that clearly is not an emer-
gency, and that clearly, in my view, is 
inconsistent with the trade promotion 
authority. 
What would be the consequences if 
my budget point of order were to suc-
ceed? 
First of all, not a dime of spending 
would be reduced. This is not an at-
tempt to cut spending. Eliminating an 
emergency designation does not cut 
any spending in this bill. What it would 
mean is that Congress would have until 
the end of the year to find an offset for 
this $50 million, which, by the way, is 
about one one-thousandth of one penny 
for every dollar the Federal Govern-
ment spends. It is a tiny, tiny amount 
of money. It means the bill will still 
pass because there will easily be more 
than 60 votes for this bill. Then it will 
go to the House, where it will pass be-
cause it already has passed. 
The point isn’t to save money per se, 
for it is too small to really matter in 
that regard. The point is, are we will-
ing to enforce our own law that gov-
erns the proceedings of this body? 
I think one of my colleagues is likely 
to respond by offering a point of order 
or a provision that will preclude the 
possibility of my offering this point of 
order. Not only that, I think it is going 
to preclude the possibility of any Sen-
ator’s offering any budgetary point of 
order, which will be a way of saying it 
will be forbidden to enforce compliance 
with the TPA’s budgetary rules in this 
legislation. 
To my colleagues, I think this is a 
very, very bad idea. I think to suggest 
that we are going to have this bill that 
is not compliant with the trade pro-
motion authority and that we are 
going to preclude the possibility of 
raising a point of order about that non-
compliance would be a big mistake. 
I will soon have the exact language 
that we will be using for this purpose, 
and we will have this discussion. Then 
we will have a vote on whether or not 
to preclude the possibility of enforcing 
our budget rules with respect to this 
implementing legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
this is a very serious claim being made 
by Senator TOOMEY, and I don’t take 
this lightly because the privilege af-
forded by the trade promotion author-
ity is a very important matter. 
The appropriations language that 
Senator TOOMEY takes issue with is, in-
deed, trade promotion authority-com-
pliant. The appropriations ensure that 
the 
United 
States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement’s commitments are fulfilled 
and enforceable by providing adequate 
resources to do so. The commitments 
cover bipartisan priorities, including 
the monitoring, enforcement, and re-
capitalization of the North American 
Development Bank. 
If funds were only authorized, as Sen-
ator 
TOOMEY
has 
suggested, 
there 
would be no guarantee that we would 
be able to fulfill the commitments 
made in the USMCA, and the credi-
bility of our good-faith negotiations 
with Mexico and Canada is the pre-
sumption that we will carry out this 
agreement and carry it out year after 
year after year. Besides, historically, 
all trade bills result in changes to Fed-
eral spending and revenue. 
This bill has the benefit of reducing 
the deficit even with the funds dis-
cussed by Senator TOOMEY. Striking 
the emergency designations could lead 
to a sequestration of discretionary 
funding as regular appropriations for 
fiscal year 2020 have already been en-
acted. The emergency designation is, in 
this precise context—and in a very pre-
cise context—considered strictly nec-
essary or appropriate under section 103 
of the trade promotion authority 2015. 
Here is the oddity of the Senator’s 
argument: If Senator TOOMEY is sug-
gesting funds be authorized, I think he 
inherently agrees that enforcement 
funding is either strictly necessary or 
appropriate to implement the USMCA. 
This is a very important clarification 
to make; that the trade promotion au-
thority language is ‘‘strictly necessary 
or appropriate.’’ 
It is for Congress, then, to decide 
what is strictly necessary or appro-
priate. The Committee on Finance, 
with jurisdiction over the entire bill, 
and the Committees on the Budget and 
Appropriations, with jurisdiction over 
the language at issue, voted over-
whelmingly to support the bill. It is 
important to note that the final appro-
priation was significantly reduced in 
consideration of concerns about spend-
ing, including my own concerns. 
Finally, I emphasize this was a nego-
tiated outcome, which was necessary in 
order to achieve the broad bipartisan 
support that this bill is going to get— 
particularly to get it through the 
House of Representatives. 
I am satisfied with the final outcome, 
so I will make a motion to waive the 
point of order, if it is made, and I urge 
my colleagues to support waiving the 
point of order and to vote yes for the 
USMCA so we can deliver a victory to 
the American people. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for up to 1 
minute and then for Senator TOOMEY 
to proceed with the procedural ques-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, first, 
I want to make sure that we can enter 
into the RECORD a thanks that is de-
served to the bipartisan team here in 
the Senate that has made this day pos-
sible. 
Second, on one substantive point, be-
cause I associate myself with the re-
marks of Chairman GRASSLEY, I think 
we need to understand that what the 
Toomey procedural issue is all about is 
really that of a Trojan horse for rolling 
back an aggressive effort to enforce the 
rights that workers care about and 
that we all care about with respect to 
our land, air, and water. I know the 
Senator from Pennsylvania disagrees 
with it, but I just wanted to make that 
point. 
The chairman is right with respect to 
the procedure. I just want people to un-
derstand what the substantive issue is. 
This is just a policy disagreement, and 
that is what the Senate is all about. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
will make two quick points and then 
get to the point of order. 
First of all, I disagree with the chair-
man. I do think the spending in this 
bill is neither strictly necessary nor 
appropriate, but that is not what the 
point of order is about. If my point of 
order is sustained and if the motion 
that is going to be made by the chair-
man is to be rejected, not a penny will 
be reduced in the spending of this bill, 
which is why I couldn’t disagree more 
with my colleague from Oregon in his 
suggesting it is a Trojan horse for 
something. It doesn’t cut spending by a 
dime from this bill. It simply means 
that by the end of the fiscal year, Con-
gress will have to find an offset for this

kind of compliance. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Madam President, pursuant to sec-
tion 314(e) of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974, I raise a point of order 
against the emergency designation on 
page No. 233, lines 4 through 8, of H.R. 
5430. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
pursuant to section 904 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiv-
er provisions of applicable budget reso-
lutions, I move to waive all applicable 
sections of that act and applicable 
budget resolutions for purposes of H.R. 
5430, and I ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered.

Mr. CRAWLEY. Mr. President, it is 
no secret around here that staff work 
is key to any Senator’s success. It 
often goes unnoticed and unthanked, 
but today, as the United States-Mex-
ico-Canada Agreement Implementation 
Act passes Congress, I would like to ex-
press my appreciation to the many 
Senate staff who work for the people of 
Iowa and the entire country. 
Foremost among them are Kolan 
Davis, my Finance Committee staff di-
rector and longtime advisor of 35 years; 
Jeff Wrase, my deputy staff director; 
and Nasim Fussell, my chief inter-
national trade counsel on the com-
mittee. Their thoughtful, prudent ad-
vice, and hard work were crucial to 
helping create the conditions that 
allow for nearly-unanimous passage 
today. 
Nasim led my trade staff on the Fi-
nance Committee. Her leadership of 
several 
other 
key 
staff, 
including 
Mayur Patel, Brian Bombassaro, An-
drew Brandt, Rory Heslington, Grace 
Kim, and Michael Pinkerton, and all of 
their many late nights working at the 
office, are among the top reasons why 
this 
modernized 
trade 
agreement 
wasn’t just negotiated with Canada and 
Mexico but will actually become law 
and soon take effect. Their diligent 
work with their Democratic counter-
parts, as well as the administration, is 
evidenced in the overwhelming vote 
USMCA received. 
My chief of staff, Aaron Cummings, 
legislative director, James Rice, and 
director of scheduling, Jennifer Heins, 
provided consistent guidance and help-
ful input on USMCA throughout nego-
tiations that helped me do the job I 
needed to do for us to get to this point. 
I am grateful for their standing by my 
side this past year and going above and 
beyond for the people of Iowa. 
I would also like to thank my com-
munications and press staff, including 
Michael Zona, Taylor Foy, George 
Hartmann, 
Nicole 
Tieman, 
Melissa 
Kearney, and Katelyn Schultz, for 
helping me communicate the many 
benefits of this trade deal to Iowans 
and all Americans. Their work to de-
liver that message to the grassroots of 
this country helped create the public 
pressure needed to encourage Congress 
to act and ratify USMCA. 
We all know that no legislating hap-
pens in the Senate without bipartisan-
ship. That is why today I say congratu-
lations and thank you to Ranking 
Member WYDEN and his staff for all 
their hard work. They are Joshua 
Sheinkman, staff director; Mike Evans, 
deputy staff director; Jayme White, 
chief advisor on international competi-
tiveness and innovation; and Greta 
Peisch, Sally Laing, Virginia Lenahan, 
and Rachel Lang. 
Of course, also critical to the bill’s 
passage 
were 
Ambassador 
Bob 
Lighthizer and his hard-working team 
at the Office of the U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative, particularly John Melle 
and Maria Pagan. 
Getting the Chamber of Commerce 
and the AFL–CIO to both endorse this 
trade deal was no easy feat, and it took 
both sides’ good faith efforts to get us 
here. 
You have heard me extol all the good 
that USMCA will do for this Nation’s

farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and 
workers of all stripes—hundreds of 
thousands 
jobs, 
billions 
of 
dollars 
added to the economy, new market ac-
cess, and a framework for the future of 
international trade. It is these staff 
members who also deserve to share in 
the Nation’s gratitude and celebration. 
Thank you all. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, 
the 
Senate 
considers 
the 
‘‘new 
NAFTA’’, a bill now reviewed by seven 
Senate committees on which more 
than 85 Senators serve. Surely the vote 
count is clear: This implementing leg-
islation will be adopted today and sent 
to the President. In Vermont, that will 
mean important wins for our State’s 
economy and, in particular, our dairy 
farmers. I will support this bill. 
Vermont is a border State, and the 
commercial and cultural exchanges 
with Canada are woven into the fabric 
of the State. Vermont’s largest export 
destination is Canada. In 2018, Vermont 
exported $1.3 billion—billion—in goods 
to Canada. That is 43 percent of 
Vermont’s exports. Trade with our 
neighbors to the north is essential to 
Vermont, just as trade throughout 
North America is important to our na-
tional economy. 
This agreement is far from perfect, 
but reflects a compromise that results 
when parties come together with a de-
sire to make progress. It makes impor-
tant updates to the more than 25-year- 
old North American Free Trade Agree-
ment to reflect the advances in digital 
trade and intellectual property. The 
agreement will protect our ability do-
mestically to increase the availability 
of affordable drugs. Importantly, to 
Vermont and the struggling dairy in-
dustry across the country, the agree-
ment will increase U.S. access to mar-
kets in Canada and Mexico for our 
high-quality dairy products. 
The new NAFTA also includes fund-
ing to promote clean water infrastruc-
ture on the U.S.-Mexico border, and to 
improve environmental infrastructure 
on both sides of the southern border. It 
also includes funding to support re-
forms to the labor justice system in 
Mexico, to reduce the use of child labor 
and forced labor, to reduce human traf-
ficking, and for international labor ac-
tivities. These are important aspects of 
the deal that we should all strongly 
support. 
This agreement is a compromise. For 
all its gains, it lacks important ac-
countability measures to address the 
escalating threat of climate change. No 
one surprised that an administration 
that announced from the start its in-
tention to remove the United States 
from the landmark Paris agreement 
would not agree to binding limits on 
pollution. It should not surprise us 
that the Trump administration would 
not agree to any system to enforce en-
vironmental regulations. It is the 
greatest flaw of this agreement and a 
startling missed opportunity. We can 
no longer deny that climate change is 
real. The United States has a real op-
portunity to be a world leader in devel-
oping the green jobs and green econo-
mies that must drive our future. So 
while I am grateful that House Demo-
crats were able to secure some conces-
sions from the administration that will 
ensure that at least consider environ-
mental impacts in terms of trade, the 
new NAFTA, unfortunately, misses 
that chance. 
I have heard from Vermont busi-
nesses concerned about our trade fu-
ture, particularly with our neighbors 
to the north. They support this deal, 
and I ask unanimous consent to place a 
letter of support from the Vermont 
Chamber of Commerce and Vermont 
employers in the RECORD. It is because 
our trading relationships throughout 
North America are so vitally impor-
tant to our national economy, and to 
local economies like those in Vermont, 
that I will support this agreement. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
VERMONT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, 
Montpelier, VT, January 14, 2020. 
Hon. PATRICK LEAHY, 
Senator, U.S. Senate. 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SENATOR
LEAHY: We, the under-
signed, urge you to vote in support of S. 3052, 
the ‘‘United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment (USMCA) Implementation Act.’’ Pas-
sage of this bill would provide much needed 
updates to the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA), which took effect over 
a quarter of a century ago. 
As you are aware, Vermont depends heav-
ily on trade with our North American neigh-
bors, particularly Canada. USMCA provides a 
path forward that strengthens these trade re-
lationships and protects the interests of 
Vermont workers and industry. The proposed 
agreement 
promotes 
job 
stability 
and 
growth, while also providing tariff-free ac-
cess to sell U.S. products in Canada and Mex-
ico. A fully implemented USMCA also pre-
vents the steep increases in consumer goods 
prices that would result from inaction. Fur-
ther, USMCA grows digital trade, including 
by guaranteeing freedom to move data 
across borders, while protecting intellectual 
property. 
Passage of USMCA relieves much of the 
uncertainty our business community has 
faced in relation to trade over the last sev-
eral years. Businesses across Vermont have 
made clear that the unpredictable imposi-
tion of tariffs and the threat of tariffs have 
added significant, often unsustainable costs 
to doing business. These added costs have 
harmed industry and limited growth by dis-
couraging the long-term investments that 
would have otherwise occurred had it not 
been for unprecedented levels of volatility in 
our trade dependent markets. 
Implementation of USMCA would greatly 
benefit Vermont businesses and their em-
ployees by providing the mechanisms nec-
essary for Vermont to continue a prosperous 
and competitive relationship with our top 
trade partner. Please promptly approve 
USMCA. 
Sincerely, 
VERMONT CHAMBER OF 
COMMERCE.

Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in 
1993, I voted against the North Amer-
ican 
Free 
Trade 
Agreement, 
or 
NAFTA. At the time, I was concerned 
about a number of issues, including 
that NAFTA would not adequately pro-
tect 
American 
jobs—manufacturing 
jobs in particular—and also lacked suf-
ficient environmental protections. 
Today, I voted yes on the U.S.-Mex-
ico-Canada Agreement that will re-
place NAFTA because it will substan-
tially improve upon NAFTA, and in the 
process benefit California and the 
United States. 
There are several provisions in the 
agreement that will help California, in-
cluding greater access to Canadian ag-
ricultural markets, including dairy; 
labor provisions that go far beyond 
past trade agreements; and $300 million 
to help address pollution from the Ti-
juana River. It also includes $215 mil-
lion and renewed authorization for the 
North American Development Bank to 
address pollution along the U.S-Mexico 
border, a provision that comes from 
legislation I introduced with Senator 
CORNYN. 
The agreement sets new standards 
for labor protections in a trade agree-
ment. The agreement will require Mex-
ico to make major improvements to its 
labor laws, including collective bar-
gaining 
reforms, 
establishing 
inde-
pendent labor courts and union dis-
pute-resolution bodies, and eliminating 
compulsory labor. It will substantially 
improve monitoring and enforcement 
of these labor reforms in Mexico, and 
make the enforcement process easier. 
For example, the agreement will estab-
lish benchmarks for Mexico’s compli-
ance with its labor obligations that 
will trigger a new labor-specific en-
forcement mechanism if those obliga-
tions are not met. 
The updates to NAFTA include sev-
eral provisions that will help Califor-
nia’s agricultural producers, including 
increasing access to Canada’s dairy 
market. The agreement also puts wine, 
beer, and spirit products from each 
country on a more level playing field. 
I recognize that some critics think 
we can do more to protect the environ-
ment and fight climate change, and I 
agree. But we can’t make the perfect 
the enemy of the good, and this agree-
ment takes important steps in that 
area. In addition to fighting pollution 
along the southern border, the agree-
ment provides increased funding for en-
vironmental 
compliance 
monitoring 
and enforcement, helps prevent illegal 
and unregulated fishing and trafficking 
of wildlife, protects marine species, af-
firms each country’s commitments to 
international 
environmental 
agree-
ments, and makes it easier for coun-
tries to issue regulations in the public 
interest. 
This agreement is a step in the right 
direction, in large part due to impor-
tant improvements made by House 
Democrats. 
Those 
improvements 
helped secure many of the strong labor

and environmental provisions I have 
just mentioned. 
These updates to NAFTA will also go 
a long way toward stabilizing our trade 
relationships with Mexico and Can-
ada—two of the most important trad-
ing partners for California and the Na-
tion. Canada and Mexico are two of the 
largest 
trading 
partners 
with 
the 
United States, each accounting for 
more than $600 billion in trade. The 
two countries are California’s two larg-
est export markets, buying nearly $50 
billion of California’s exports each 
year. 
Finally, it is notable that this agree-
ment has broad bipartisan support, 
which I think is a sign that Congress 
can still work together to get impor-
tant things done. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we 
consider these amendments to NAFTA. 
I opposed the original NAFTA in 1993 
because I believed it would kill Amer-
ican jobs and failed to protect the envi-
ronment. I oppose this version now, be-
cause it does not substantially improve 
on what was a bad deal all those years 
ago. 
I appreciate the concessions my col-
leagues were able to force President 
Trump to accept that strengthen pro-
tections for workers, but at the end of 
the day, these changes don’t go far 
enough. I am concerned that this trade 
agreement could continue NAFTA’s 
suppression of wages here at home in-
stead of lifting them. This agreement 
also doesn’t prioritize protecting our 
environment and will contribute to en-
vironmental damage and degradation, 
and it will continue President Trump’s 
failed economic priorities that pri-
marily benefit the wealthy and well- 
connected at the expense of hard-work-
ing, middle-class, and blue collar tax-
payers. 
A well-crafted free trade deal should 
provide reciprocal benefits, contain 
sufficient labor standards that preserve 
and create jobs here at home, and in-
clude environmental and other protec-
tions to ensure that trade is conducted 
fairly. 
If well-crafted, trade policy can be a 
vital part of our economic and security 
efforts. Ideally, it would serve to 
achieve our Nation’s policy objectives. 
The simple fact is that there are win-
ners and there are losers in any trade 
agreement. The loss of economic secu-
rity as a result of trade agreement 
after trade agreement over decades 
stems from a frequent failure to pro-
vide guaranteed and significant assist-
ance to dislocated workers and small 
businesses that are negatively im-
pacted by increased trade. A little 
money for training in a massive econ-
omy just hasn’t cut it. 
In. 1993, I thought that NAFTA failed 
this test and as a result would be bad 
for Rhode Island’s workers, manufac-
turers, and small businesses. I outlined 
a number of concerns at the time. 
I believed that NAFTA would in-
crease incentives for companies to 
move factories and outsource jobs to 
Mexico—depressing wages for Amer-
ican workers. I also worried that the 
conditions on the ground in Mexico and 
the disposition of its government were 
not conducive to a free-trade agree-
ment. Sadly, many of these concerns 
were later realized. NAFTA, along with 
increased globalization, certainly con-
tributed to stagnating wages, loss of 
jobs, and a diminishing manufacturing 
base. Businesses outsourced jobs and 
moved factories to Mexico where costs 
and wages were lower. Labor standards 
were not adequate or enforced and 
workers were taken advantage of. Ad-
ditionally, there were lax environ-
mental standards, further incentivizing 
businesses to move jobs to Mexico, and 
which have proven harmful to our envi-
ronment. 
Alternating between threatening to 
withdraw from NAFTA and imposing 
tariffs on dubious national security 
grounds, President Trump damaged 
critical relationships for, at best, mar-
ginal gains. That is what is so con-
founding. Out of the very chaos that 
President Trump has sown, we could 
have emerged with a much better, 
stronger NAFTA but that is not where 
we find ourselves. 
According to a report conducted by 
the U.S. International Trade Commis-
sion, USITC, released in April, the 
USITC forecasts that the new NAFTA 
‘‘would raise U.S. real GDP by $68.2 bil-
lion (0.35 percent) and U.S. employ-
ment by 176,000 jobs (0.12 percent)’’ 
once implemented, years in the future. 
While each new job is critically impor-
tant, these projections in no way 
match the rhetoric that President 
Trump spins and demonstrate that the 
new NAFTA is essentially the same as 
the old NAFTA from an economic per-
spective. It is also not clear that jobs 
lost as a result of NAFTA will be re-
covered, as has been claimed by some 
of the new NAFTA’s proponents. 
Similarly, I believe that many of the 
concerns that I had with NAFTA and 
other trade agreements remain, par-
ticularly with respect to the protection 
of workers and our environment and 
ensuring tough enforcement mecha-
nisms. I note the absence of a specific 
and robust Trade Adjustment Assist-
ance Program to assist workers nega-
tively impacted by increased trade in 
the implementing legislation—such as-
sistance was at least included in 1993. 
The implementing legislation contains 
$843 million dollars in new spending. 
This includes resources to enforce envi-
ronmental and labor standards in Mex-
ico. Yet it does not include funding to 
assist American workers and small 
businesses who are negatively im-
pacted by trade. As a result of any 
trade agreement, there are those who 
benefit and those who are hurt. We 
should always insist that there are suf-
ficient provisions to assist workers 
who will lose out. 
Environmental standards and protec-
tions were inadequately accounted for 
in 1993, and the fact that they are not 
sufficiently stringent here is very dis-
appointing. Climate change is having a 
serious impact on our environment and 
our economy. Safeguarding the envi-
ronment is the right thing to do. It 
also helps ensure our workers can com-
pete on an even playing field. Jobs are 
typically outsourced because it is 
cheaper to do business somewhere else. 
The absence of stringent and enforce-
able 
environmental 
standards 
in 
NAFTA contributed to a rush to move 
the production of goods to Mexico. It 
also hurt our environment. As we con-
sider the new NAFTA, Australia is 
being ravaged by wildfires that many 
scientists argue are exacerbated by cli-
mate change. Our trade policy should 
intentionally include efforts to recog-
nize and combat climate change. The 
new NAFTA fails to tackle this chal-
lenge that today’s and every suc-
ceeding generation for the foreseeable 
future will have to confront, and my 
colleague from Rhode Island has made 
this point in greater and granular de-
tail. 
In l993, conditions in Mexico and the 
disposition of its government were not 
conductive to a free-trade agreement. 
Mexico’s democratic institutions and 
law enforcement agencies were weak 
and susceptible to corruption. As is fre-
quently reported in the news, this re-
mains a challenge for Mexico. If Mex-
ico cannot arrest certain of its citizens 
for fear of cartel violence, it seems un-
reasonable to believe that it will be 
able to effectively inspect factories for 
alleged labor violations in territory 
controlled by cartels or factories in 
which cartels have an interest. 
In order to revitalize manufacturing 
in America, we need a commitment to 
workers. We need to make national in-
vestments in infrastructure and inno-
vation. But, instead, what President 
Trump is offering is a repackaging and 
rebranding of NAFTA. 
President Trump may not be an ex-
pert on a lot of things, but he knows 
the importance of branding. He thinks 
he can call NAFTA terrible, fiddle 
around the edges, re brand it as the 
United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment, NAFTA 2.0, or whatever name he 
wants to come up with, and then call it 
great, big, and beautiful, when in re-
ality, he hasn’t solved a problem. 
Further, the new NAFTA fits neatly 
into President Trump’s habit of cre-
ating a problem, sowing chaos, and 
then seeking credit when he provides a 
‘‘solution’’ that is marginally better 
than where he began or worse. 
Many proponents of the new NAFTA 
explain that an important reason to 
vote in favor of this deal is that if rati-
fied, it will remove ‘‘uncertainty’’ from 
the economy and our relationship with 
our NAFTA partners. However, the 
main cause of uncertainty from our re-
lationship with Canada and Mexico was 
created by President Trump through 
his erratic threats to our neighbors and 
trading partners. The arsonist is not a 
hero for putting out the blaze he inten-
tionally set.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S265 
January 16, 2020 
The President’s pattern of behavior 
is prevalent throughout his trade pol-
icy. The President’s tariffs and tweets 
are having a damaging effect. Indeed, 
while President Trump continues to as-
sert that China is paying the cost, 
economists, including those from the 
Federal Reserve, have instead proven 
that these tariffs are being paid by 
American families, workers, farmers, 
small businesses, and manufacturers. 
These NAFTA amendments are just 
another example of an economic policy 
that provides crumbs to the middle- 
class. It goes hand in hand with the 
President and Republicans in Congress 
choosing to spend $1.9 trillion on tax 
cuts for the biggest companies and the 
wealthiest one percent of Americans 
who were recently estimated to already 
control more than a third of America’s 
wealth. It is no wonder the President’s 
tax law is unpopular. People can read 
the paper and see the list of those now 
paying little to nothing in taxes, while 
their taxes remain more or less the 
same and investment in roads and 
other 
infrastructure, 
education, 
or 
healthcare facilities goes unmet. 
We should be focusing our attention 
on lifting up working families and 
small businesses and ensuring that our 
Nation is on sound financial footing. 
While some of my Democratic col-
leagues had a hand in improving the 
initial agreement, it still fails to pro-
vide adequately for Rhode Island’s 
workers and small businesses or the en-
vironment. Just like the old NAFTA, I 
cannot support this new one. 
f 
STATEMENT 
ON 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES-MEXICO-CANADA AGREE-
MENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, trade 
with Canada and Mexico is vitally im-
portant 
to 
Maine’s 
economy, 
sup-
porting numerous small businesses and 
more than 53,000 jobs in our State. 
In reviewing the text of the U.S.- 
Mexico-Canada 
Agreement, 
the 
re-
placement 
for 
the 
deeply 
flawed 
NAFTA, my paramount concern was 
ensuring that Maine workers will be 
protected. After careful assessment of 
the benefits USMCA will have for those 
employed in Maine’s manufacturing in-
dustry, agriculture sector, and small 
businesses, I will vote in support of the 
USMCA. 
According to the U.S. International 
Trade Commission, USMCA is pro-
jected to have a positive impact on all 
broad industry sectors, increasing em-
ployment by 176,000 jobs and increasing 
real GDP by $68.2 billion. This agree-
ment also makes important improve-
ments to labor and environmental 
standards and brings these issues into 
the core of the agreement. This is a 
step in the right direction for modern-
izing trade agreements. 
Dana Connors, president & CEO of 
the Maine State Chamber of Com-
merce, said: 
Our border countries are important trade 
partners for Maine businesses, in fact, trade 
with our friends to the north is vital to 
many Maine businesses on a daily basis. The 
Maine State Chamber of Commerce thanks 
Senator Collins for her support of the United 
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). 
The USMCA’s passage is vital for Maine 
businesses, will restore trade uncertainty 
and help our economy to continue to thrive. 
One out of five Maine manufacturing 
firms exports to Canada and Mexico, 
and the majority of these are small- 
and medium-sized companies. Without 
tariff-free trade, Maine’s manufactured 
goods exported to Canada and Mexico 
could face $6.3 million to $26 million in 
additional tariffs, jeopardizing Maine 
jobs. Companies like New Balance, 
which employs hundreds of Mainers at 
its facilities in Norridgewock, Norway, 
and Skowhegan, and Texas Instru-
ments in South Portland, depend on a 
stable North American supply chain. 
Amy Dow, director of public rela-
tions and government relations for 
New Balance, said: 
On behalf of our company’s Maine associ-
ates, New Balance supports the passage of 
the USMCA that will enable the continued 
success and future growth of our three man-
ufacturing facilities in Maine. Senator Col-
lins’ support and leadership on this trade 
agreement has been vital to ensure that our 
factories can continue to produce thousands 
of pairs of shoes annually for export to the 
Canadian market. 
Stephen Bonner, Texas Instruments 
vice president for worldwide govern-
ment relations, said: 
Texas Instruments is a long-time supporter 
of predictable, open-market based trade poli-
cies. We’re pleased that the new USMCA in-
cludes strong digital trade and intellectual 
property provisions to adapt the agreement 
to the 21st century economy, and support its 
passage. 
Our agricultural producers also rely 
on a stable and predictable trading en-
vironment. U.S. agricultural exports to 
Canada and Mexico more than quad-
rupled between 1993 and 2017. In Maine, 
I have heard from producers in the 
dairy, potato, and wild blueberry in-
dustries who have shared their support 
for free and fair trade agreements. 
Maine has a special relationship with 
Canada in particular, given our shared 
border. While there remain frictions 
with Canada, including fishing rights, 
right whale regulations, and softwood 
lumber issues, Canada is our largest 
trading partner and has consistently 
been our top U.S. export market. As a 
native of Aroostook County, I know 
how many of our border communities 
are truly intertwined, with people and 
goods traveling back and forth daily. 
In 2019, Maine and Canada traded an 
average of $350 million in goods per 
month. 
Ambassador Robert Lighthizer de-
serves recognition for his tremendous 
work on this agreement. It is impres-
sive to see a trade agreement receive 
such strong bipartisan support.

original version of this proposal, it was 
stunning to see how weak it was in 
terms of trade enforcement. When you 
write a proposal with weak trade en-
forcement, particularly on labor and 
environmental issues, you sell out 
American workers and you launch a 
corporate race to the bottom of cheap 
wages and the treatment of labor. 
Senator BROWN and I decided that 
was unacceptable, and we were going to 
create a trade enforcement regime 
with real teeth. We worked with Sen-
ators here; we worked with Senators on 
the other side of the aisle and in the 
other body. To give you an example of 
what this means with respect to en-
forcing trade law, we sped up the 
timeline by more than 300 percent. 
The second point—just very quick-
ly—what this proposal does is bring 
technology and trade policy into the 
21st century. When the last North 
American Free Trade Agreement was 
considered, nobody had a smartphone. 
So what we did is protect intellectual 
property; we prohibited shakedowns of 
data belonging to innovative compa-
nies; and on something I care deeply 
about, we drew on established U.S. law 
to defend small tech entrepreneurs 
working to build successful companies 
in a field dominated by Goliaths. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
proposal and once again thank Bob 
Lighthizer, the hardest working man in 
the trade agreement business. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote.

HOUSE RESOLUTION 755 
IMPEACHING DONALD JOHN TRUMP, PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES, FOR HIGH CRIMES AND 
MISDEMEANORS 
Resolved, That Donald John Trump, Presi-
dent of the United States, is impeached for 
high crimes and misdemeanors and that the 
following articles of impeachment be exhib-
ited to the United States Senate: 
Articles of impeachment exhibited by the 
House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in the name of itself and 
of the people of the United States of Amer-
ica, against Donald John Trump, President 
of the United States of America, in mainte-
nance and support of its impeachment 
against him for high crimes and mis-
demeanors. 
ARTICLE I: ABUSE OF POWER 
The Constitution provides that the House 
of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole 
Power of Impeachment’’ and that the Presi-
dent ‘‘shall be removed from Office on Im-
peachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’. In his conduct of the office of 
President of the United States—and in viola-
tion of his constitutional oath faithfully to 
execute the office of President of the United 
States and, to the best of his ability, pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
of the United States, and in violation of his 
constitutional duty to take care that the 
laws 
be 
faithfully 
executed—Donald 
J. 
Trump has abused the powers of the Presi-
dency, in that:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S267 
January 16, 2020 
Using the powers of his high office, Presi-
dent Trump solicited the interference of a 
foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 
United States Presidential election. He did 
so through a scheme or course of conduct 
that included soliciting the Government of 
Ukraine to publicly announce investigations 
that would benefit his reelection, harm the 
election prospects of a political opponent, 
and influence the 2020 United States Presi-
dential election to his advantage. President 
Trump also sought to pressure the Govern-
ment of Ukraine to take these steps by con-
ditioning official United States Government 
acts of significant value to Ukraine on its 
public announcement of the investigations. 
President Trump engaged in this scheme or 
course of conduct for corrupt purposes in 
pursuit of personal political benefit. In so 
doing, President Trump used the powers of 
the Presidency in a manner that com-
promised the national security of the United 
States and undermined the integrity of the 
United States democratic process. He thus 
ignored and injured the interests of the Na-
tion. 
President Trump engaged in this scheme or 
course of conduct through the following 
means: 
(1) President Trump—acting both directly 
and through his agents within and outside 
the United States Government—corruptly 
solicited the Government of Ukraine to pub-
licly announce investigations into— 
(A) a political opponent, former Vice Presi-
dent Joseph R. Biden, Jr.; and 
(B) a discredited theory promoted by Rus-
sia alleging that Ukraine—rather than Rus-
sia—interfered in the 2016 United States 
Presidential election. 
(2) With the same corrupt motives, Presi-
dent 
Trump—acting 
both 
directly 
and 
through his agents within and outside the 
United States Government—conditioned two 
official acts on the public announcements 
that he had requested— 
(A) the release of $391 million of United 
States taxpayer funds that Congress had ap-
propriated on a bipartisan basis for the pur-
pose of providing vital military and security 
assistance to Ukraine to oppose Russian ag-
gression and which President Trump had or-
dered suspended; and 
(B) a head of state meeting at the White 
House, which the President of Ukraine 
sought to demonstrate continued United 
States 
support 
for 
the 
Government 
of 
Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. 
(3) Faced with the public revelation of his 
actions, President Trump ultimately re-
leased the military and security assistance 
to the Government of Ukraine, but has per-
sisted in openly and corruptly urging and so-
liciting Ukraine to undertake investigations 
for his personal political benefit. 
These actions were consistent with Presi-
dent Trump’s previous invitations of foreign 
interference in United States elections. 
In all of this, President Trump abused the 
powers of the Presidency by ignoring and in-
juring national security and other vital na-
tional interests to obtain an improper per-
sonal political benefit. He has also betrayed 
the Nation by abusing his high office to en-
list a foreign power in corrupting democratic 
elections. 
Wherefore President Trump, by such con-
duct, has demonstrated that he will remain a 
threat to national security and the Constitu-
tion if allowed to remain in office, and has 
acted in a manner grossly incompatible with 
self-governance and the rule of law. Presi-
dent Trump thus warrants impeachment and 
trial, removal from office, and disqualifica-
tion to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
trust, or profit under the United States. 
ARTICLE II: OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS 
The Constitution provides that the House 
of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole 
Power of Impeachment’’ and that the Presi-
dent ‘‘shall be removed from Office on Im-
peachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’. In his conduct of the office of 
President of the United States—and in viola-
tion of his constitutional oath faithfully to 
execute the office of President of the United 
States and, to the best of his ability, pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
of the United States, and in violation of his 
constitutional duty to take care that the 
laws 
be 
faithfully 
executed—Donald 
J. 
Trump has directed the unprecedented, cat-
egorical, and indiscriminate defiance of sub-
poenas issued by the House of Representa-
tives pursuant to its ‘‘sole Power of Im-
peachment’’. President Trump has abused 
the powers of the Presidency in a manner of-
fensive to, and subversive of, the Constitu-
tion, in that: 
The House of Representatives has engaged 
in an impeachment inquiry focused on Presi-
dent Trumps corrupt solicitation of the Gov-
ernment of Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 
United States Presidential election. As part 
of this impeachment inquiry, the Commit-
tees undertaking the investigation served 
subpoenas seeking documents and testimony 
deemed vital to the inquiry from various Ex-
ecutive Branch agencies and offices, and cur-
rent and former officials. 
In response, without lawful cause or ex-
cuse, President Trump directed Executive 
Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to 
comply with those subpoenas. President 
Trump thus interposed the powers of the 
Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of 
the House of Representatives, and assumed 
to himself functions and judgments nec-
essary to the exercise of the ‘‘sole Power of 
Impeachment’’ vested by the Constitution in 
the House of Representatives. 
President Trump abused the powers of his 
high office through the following means: 
(l) Directing the White House to defy a 
lawful subpoena by withholding the produc-
tion of documents sought therein by the 
Committees. 
(2) Directing other Executive Branch agen-
cies and offices to defy lawful subpoenas and 
withhold the production of documents and 
records from the Committees—in response to 
which the Department of State, Office of 
Management and Budget, Department of En-
ergy, and Department of Defense refused to 
produce a single document or record. 
(3) Directing current and former Executive 
Branch officials not to cooperate with the 
Committees—in response to which nine Ad-
ministration officials defied subpoenas for 
testimony, namely John Michael ‘‘Mick’’ 
Mulvaney, 
Robert 
B. 
Blair, 
John 
A. 
Eisenberg, Michael Ellis, Preston Wells Grif-
fith, Russell T. Vought, Michael Duffey, 
Brian McCormack, and T. Ulrich Brechbuhl. 
These actions were consistent with Presi-
dent Trump’s previous efforts to undermine 
United States Government investigations 
into foreign interference in United States 
elections. 
Through these actions, President Trump 
sought to arrogate to himself the right to de-
termine the propriety, scope, and nature of 
an impeachment inquiry into his own con-
duct, as well as the unilateral prerogative to 
deny any and all information to the House of 
Representatives in the exercise of its ‘‘sole 
Power of Impeachment’’. In the history of 
the Republic, no President has ever ordered 
the complete defiance of an impeachment in-
quiry or sought to obstruct and impede so 
comprehensively the ability of the House of 
Representatives to investigate ‘‘high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors’’. This abuse of office 
served to cover up the President’s own re-
peated misconduct and to seize and control 
the power of impeachment and thus to nul-
lify a vital constitutional safeguard vested 
solely in the House of Representatives. 
In all of this, President Trump has acted in 
a manner contrary to his trust as President 
and subversive of constitutional government, 
to the great prejudice of the cause of law and 
justice, and to the manifest injury of the 
people of the United States. 
Wherefore, President Trump, by such con-
duct, has demonstrated that he will remain a 
threat to the Constitution if allowed to re-
main in office, and has acted in a manner 
grossly incompatible with self-governance 
and the rule of law. President Trump thus 
warrants impeachment and trial, removal 
from office, and disqualification to hold and 
enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit 
under the United States.

Speaker of the House of Representatives.

LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Senate has remained in session this 
afternoon following the first meeting 
of our impeachment trial. History will 
not only remember today for the first 
steps of the trial, but today was also a 
tremendous bipartisan legislative ac-
complishment for the American people. 
The Senate passed USMCA, President 
Trump’s historic new trade agreement 
with Canada and Mexico, by a vote of 
89 to 10. Now this landmark deal, which 
experts estimate will add tens of bil-
lions of dollars to the U.S. economy 
and create 176,000 new jobs, is on its 
way to the White House to be signed 
into law by the President. 
This was a major priority for farm-
ers, ranchers, manufacturers, small 
businesses, and working families across 
the entire country, and, today, the 
Senate got it done. 
We also passed another important 
bill that will keep analogues of the 
dangerous drug fentanyl designated as 
schedule I narcotics. It will keep them 
appropriately listed among the most 
dangerous illegal drugs and keep this 
important tool in the hands of law en-
forcement. The legislation also pre-
serves mandatory minimum sentences 
for the criminals who unleash these 
dangerous poisons on our streets. 
Law enforcement officials from Ken-
tucky and across the Nation have been 
pleading with Congress for months to 
keep these tools in place. But our 
Democratic colleagues have resisted 
Republican efforts to make these tem-
porary measures permanent. 
Finally, this week, thanks to Chair-
man GRAHAM and the Judiciary Com-
mittee, we were at least able to get an 
agreement to prevent these measures 
from expiring for now. 
There is a lot of work to do. Fentanyl 
and these analogues are a plague—a 
plague. They kill more Kentuckians 
than any other illegal drug—nearly 800 
overdose deaths in 2018 alone, just in 
my State. The problem, of course, is 
nationwide. We are going to stay in the 
fight and keep working, but today’s 
victory was an important step. 
The Senate will next convene on 
Tuesday. As I discussed this morning, 
an impeachment trial is just about the 
most serious business in which the U.S. 
Senate can engage. The Founding Fa-
thers gave us this task for a reason. 
They had confidence in the Senate for 
a reason. They knew this institution 
could do what was right for our Nation, 
so I am confident that we can prove 
our Framers right in the days that lie 
ahead. 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate be in a period of morning business, 
with Senators permitted to speak 
therein for up to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section 
36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act 
requires that Congress receive prior no-
tification of certain proposed arms 
sales as defined by that statute. Upon 
such notification, the Congress has 30 
calendar days during which the sale 
may be reviewed. The provision stipu-
lates that, in the Senate, the notifica-
tion of proposed sales shall be sent to 
the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

installation support material, special pur-
pose test equipment, initial logistics outfit-
ting, spares and other ancillary equipment 
to support the installation and integration 
of AEGIS Combat System equipment in the 
Hunter and Hobart class ship platforms; de-
velopment of technical documentation to 
support both programs; provision of logistics 
and other support services to support the Ho-
bart and Hunter Class ships; procurement, 
staging, delivery and installation support for 
AEGIS Combat System equipment for the 
Hobart and Hunter Class ships; provision of 
training support for curriculum develop-
ment, training tool development, front-end 
analysis, and crew training for the Hobart 
and Hunter Class ships; U.S. Government and 
contractor representative engineering, logis-
tics, and technical support services; and 
other related elements of logistics and pro-
gram support for the Hobart and Hunter 
Class ships. The total estimated cost is $1.50 
billion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. 
The proposed sale will enhance Australia’s 
Surface Combatant capability by modern-
izing their existing three AEGIS capable Ho-
bart Class Destroyers with the latest tech-
nology and capability, and delivering the 
first three (of nine) AEGIS capable Hunter 
Class Future Frigates. This sale enhances 
Australia’s self-defense capability, while sig-
nificantly improving interoperability with 
U.S. Navy AEGIS combatants in the region. 
By deploying a surface combatant fleet that 
will incorporate Cooperative Engagement 
Capability (CEC), Australia will signifi-
cantly improve network-centric warfare ca-
pability for US forces operating in the re-
gion. Australia will have no difficulty ab-
sorbing this equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
There are a significant number of compa-
nies under contract with the U.S. Navy that 
will provide components and systems as well 
as engineering services during the execution 
of this effort, with a significant portion of 
the effort to be performed by Lockheed Mar-
tin, 
Rotary 
and 
Mission 
Systems, 
Moorestown, NJ. There are no known offset 
agreements proposed in connection with this 
potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require travel of U.S. Government and/or 
contractor representatives to Australia on a 
temporary basis for program support and 
management oversight. No extended (long- 
term) visits to Australia will be required as 
part of this effort. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. This sale involves the procurement of 
long lead material and services to support 
the Australian Surface Combatant Program. 
The AEGIS Combat System (ACS) to be pro-
cured to support the modernization of the 
Hobart Class Destroyers is a multi-mission 
combat system providing Integrated Air and 
Missile Defense (IAMD) and a growth path to 
Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) capability, 
derived from USN AEGIS Weapon System 
Baseline 9 capability. In addition to ship-
board AEGIS equipment, this proposed sale 
will provide software, documentation (in-
cluding combat system capabilities and limi-
tations), training devices and services, and 
other technical support to ensure the proper 
installation, testing and operation of the 
provided equipment. 
2. AEGIS Weapon System simulation soft-
ware, documentation, training and study 
material will be provided a classification lev-
els up to and including SECRET. Delivery of 
sensitive technological information, up to 
and including SECRET, will be limited to 
the minimum level of information required 
to progress activities associated with the in-
tegration of indigenous combat system sys-
tems into the AEGIS Combat System. This 
consists primarily of AEGIS Combat System 
requirements and integration information to 
support early combat system development 
activities, in the form of documentation, 
simulation software, and technical specifica-
tions. This information is sensitive as it pro-
vides limited insight into AEGIS Combat 
System capabilities and requirements—as 
tailored to the Australian AEGIS Combat 
System configurations. 
3. The Cooperative Engagement Capability 
(CEC) is a system that fuses tracking data 
from shipboard sensors and distributes radar 
measurement data to other platforms with 
CEC capability. This data is filtered and 
combined to create a common tactical pic-
ture, based on available sensor data from all 
platforms netted through the CEC system. 
The hardware is unclassified with the excep-
tion 
of 
a 
Communications 
Security 
(COMSEC) card which is classified SECRET. 
The software and documentation are classi-
fied SECRET. All manuals and technical 
documentation disclosure will be limited to 
those necessary for operational use and orga-
nizational maintenance. 
4. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures, which might reduce weapon sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
5. This sale is necessary in furtherance of 
the U.S. foreign policy and national security 
objectives outlined in the enclosed Policy 
Justification. A determination has been 
made that Australia can provide the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. 
6. All defense articles and services listed on 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Aus-
tralia. 
f 
REVEREND DR. MARTIN LUTHER 
KING, JR. DAY 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, on Janu-
ary 20, we celebrate the 91st anniver-
sary of the birth of the Reverend Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. In the short 39 
years that he spent on Earth, Dr. King 
inspired more change, touched more 
lives, and lifted up more voices than 
most of us could hope to in many life-
times. With his message of compassion, 
he shepherded a civil rights movement 
defined by love and peacefulness, de-
spite the violence and hatred raging all 
around. He bravely preached the equal 
value of every human soul, and he was 
killed for it. That day, we lost a cham-
pion for justice who can never be re-
placed. 
Nearly 52 years after Dr. King’s mur-
der, it is important to pause and reflect 
on the profound impact that his dream 
of peace and equality has had on our 
Nation’s character. Dr. King’s legacy 
includes expanded voting rights, more 
inclusive housing policies, and the 
legal prohibition of discrimination on 
the basis of race. Not only that, but his 
advocacy for economic justice illumi-
nated the ways that race and class 
intersect in America, inspiring future 
generations to demand freedom from 
all vectors of oppression. 
But today is also an opportunity to 
reflect on what is still needed to make 
Dr. King’s dream a reality. Our crimi-
nal justice system still operates as a 
tool with which to surveil and sub-
jugate minority communities. 
People of color, especially African 
Americans, are still disenfranchised at 
substantially higher rates and have to 
navigate sophisticated voter deception 
and intimidation practices in order to 
exercise their right to vote. And White 
supremacists are still marching in the 
streets while the occupant of our coun-
try’s highest office proclaims that 
there are ‘‘good people on both sides.’’ 
It turns out that the forces of injus-
tice that Dr. King fought to eradicate 
are strong and adaptable. Often, when 
we think we have defeated them, they 
have in fact taken a new, unfamiliar 
form, or simply hidden below the sur-
face, waiting for an opportunity to 
emerge. Sadly, there are too many in 
power right now who offer platforms 
and shelter to these forces. They 
threaten to drag our country back to a 
darker time. 
We can’t let that happen. I appre-
ciate how daunting that imperative 
is—goodness knows that I ask myself 
all the time how I, just one man, can 
possibly effect the change that I hope 
to see in the world. But it helps to re-
member that Martin Luther King was 
also just one man, one ordinary man 
called to an extraordinary mission. 
So all we need to do is model our-
selves in Dr. King’s image. Easy, right? 
Maybe not. But a good way to start is 
to recall his lesson that ‘‘life’s most 
persistent question is: what are you 
doing for others?’’ Dr. King taught us 
that justice doesn’t have to be sweep-
ing and grand—it can be quiet; it can 
take root in small moments. The world 
that he envisioned can be planted with 
good deeds between neighbors, helping 
hands offered to friends, and displays of 
empathy for complete strangers. 
When we do these things, we recog-
nize each other’s humanity, we bond 
ourselves to one another, and then we 
come to see that none of us is striving 
alone for a better world. That together-
ness, that solidarity, will always win 
out over hatred and fear. 
Another thing we can do is support 
the systems and institutions that have 
the power to uphold equality. This is 
where I make my plug for the census. 
The upcoming decennial census will be 
used to determine congressional rep-
resentation and the fair distribution of

resources 
for 
things 
like 
schools, hospitals, and housing. It has 
the potential to ensure that all Ameri-
cans get the services and political rep-
resentation to which they are entitled, 
or it could further skew the playing 
field in favor of the already privileged. 
It all depends on whether minority 
communities are fully counted. 
Historically, they have not been. 
That is why I am asking each and 
every American to please, please par-
ticipate in the census this year. Dr. 
King taught us that every human being 
is equal, that all of us deserve to live 
with dignity and respect. He shined a 
light on the forgotten and the op-
pressed and demanded better for them. 
Help to honor his memory by making 
sure that no one goes uncounted. Carry 
on his legacy by demanding a govern-
ment that serves and protects each of 
its citizens equally. In this way, we can 
continue building the world that Dr. 
King envisioned.

man of the Armed Services Committee, 
my top priority is ensuring the effec-
tive implementation of the National 
Defense Strategy. I rise today to speak 
about the importance of Africa as a 
key front in our global efforts under 
the NDS to compete with China and 
Russia, defend U.S. national security, 
and combat radical terrorist groups 
like al-Qaida and ISIS. The NDS says 
competition with China and Russia is 
‘‘the central challenge to U.S. pros-
perity and security.’’ This is where 
DOD is rightly focusing its attention. 
But China’s and Russia’s growing influ-
ence isn’t restricted to Europe and the 
Indo-Pacific. Recent actions by China 
and Russia clearly demonstrate that 
both countries view Africa as a critical 
battlefield to fulfill their global ambi-
tions and challenge U.S. interests. 
Over the past 20 years, I have con-
ducted 164 African country visits. I can 
tell you it is no coincidence that China 
established its first overseas military 
base in Djibouti—strategically located 
on one of the most important maritime 
transit routes in the world. I visited 
Djibouti last February and saw first- 
hand China’s military base and their 
encroachment on the Port of Djibouti. 
Elsewhere, China is using cash and 
debt to trap countries and force them 
to put their infrastructure and poten-
tially their very sovereignty on sale. 
For example, 90 percent of African ex-
ports depend on ports and China is 
funding, building, or operating at least 
46 port projects in sub-Saharan Africa. 
In addition to giving China a potential 
stranglehold on African prosperity, it 
also provides China access to critical 
maritime routes and chokepoints. 
At the same time, Russia is using its 
armed forces, mercenaries, and the sale 
of Russian arms to buy influence, ex-
ploit Africa’s natural resources, and to 
prop up leaders sympathetic to Russian 
interests and hostile to those of the 
West. And while the NDS states that 
competition with China and Russia 
should be DOD’s top priority, it makes 
clear that we cannot afford to lose 
sight of the continuing threat posed by 
radical terrorist groups like al-Qaida 
and ISIS. 
Africa has been and must remain a 
key theater for our counterterrorism 
efforts. Today, more than a dozen ter-
rorist groups with ties to al-Qaida and 
ISIS, like Al-Shabab, are operating 
across the continent. Many of these 
groups have ambition to attack Ameri-
cans and our partners, as we saw last 
week when Al-Shabab militants in 
Kenya killed a U.S. servicemember and 
two DOD contractors. Without pressure 
the threat these groups pose to the 
United States will grow unchecked. 
And this isn’t a recent development—I 
have seen this come up time and time 
again on my visits to the continent. It 
is why I pushed the DOD for years to 
stand up an Africa command. People 
forget that we didn’t always have a 
dedicated military presence in Africa, 
despite its strategic importance. It was 
managed through three separate com-
batant commands. I worked with DOD 
and then-President Bush to change 
that, and in 2008 we officially stood up 
United 
States 
Africa 
Command 
AFRICOM. 
Despite the breadth of security chal-
lenges we face on the African continent 
every day, AFRICOM has consistently 
suffered resource shortfalls. On any 
given day, there are about 7,000 DOD 
personnel serving in Africa. Africa is 
home to 1.3 billion people and is larger 
geographically than China, India, the 
United States, and most of Europe— 
combined. In light of these significant 
resource and geographical challenges, 
the men and women of AFRICOM per-
form critical missions every day to 
check Chinese and Russian influence, 
combat terrorism, and strengthen the 
capabilities of our partners. AFRICOM 
provides an enormous value to the Na-
tion for an extremely modest level of 
investment—the 
very 
definition 
of 
‘‘economy of force.’’ Despite this, I un-
derstand that DOD is reviewing our 
military presence in Africa and is con-
sidering significant cuts. 
Given what is at stake for both U.S. 
national security and effective imple-
mentation of NDS, we must have a 
meaningful, albeit limited, U.S. pres-
ence in Africa. Any drawdown of our 
troops would be shortsighted, could 
cripple AFRICOM’s ability to execute 
its mission and, as a result, would 
harm national security. Rather than 
talking about drawing down troops in 
Africa, we should finally assign forces 
to AFRICOM on an enduring basis—in-
cluding an SFAB—in order to provide 
the 
command 
with 
predictable 
resourcing so it can be most effective 
in defending U.S. national security. 
I urge the Secretary of Defense to 
keep this in mind as he makes deci-
sions on the future of our presence and 
role in Africa.∑

REMEMBERING CHRIS ALLEN 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the life of Chris 
Allen, who worked as my senior eco-
nomic policy adviser. It is fitting that 
I do so on the Senate floor because 
Chris Allen would be the first one to 
tell you he loved his job. 
This statement was delivered so fre-
quently and with such sincerity that 
one was compelled to look inward and 
remind one’s self of what a privilege it 
is to work in the U.S. Senate on behalf 
of the American people. 
Chris Allen was a student of history 
and a lover of politics. Ladies and gen-
tlemen, Chris Allen loved tax policy. If 
that doesn’t tell you what a special 
person he was, I don’t know what does. 
Chris’s attitude about his job ex-
tended to his coworkers. He loved his 
coworkers. When he was on my staff, 
Chris was always willing to help junior 
staff, senior staff, or interns. It didn’t 
matter—he had time for you. He rolled 
up his sleeves and pitched in. He gave 
you advice. He truly cared. 
When it came time for my 2014 cam-
paign, Chris spent his vacation days 
with me in Kansas—knocking on doors, 
walking in parades, and being a force of 
positive energy no matter what we 
faced. Normally these are grueling 
tasks but not for Chris. He had fun. He 
loved it. 
As a matter of fact, posted on the 
wall of our little Hart kitchen, we have 
a selfie on election night of my crew at 
the victory party. The picture is enti-
tled ‘‘This is what victory looks like.’’ 
And right smack-dab in the middle is 
one smiling Chris Allen. Now, when I 
am heating up my coffee, I look at 
Chris in the picture, and I can feel his 
joy as he is surrounded by our family 
of staffers. 
Elections weren’t his only love. Chris 
Allen loved a cold beer. He loved a 
natty jacket. He loved loud pants. 
Sometimes he loved wearing them to-
gether. He loved his lacrosse. He loved 
his Baltimore neighborhood. He loved 
all things English and French. He loved 
researching his ancestry. 
Chris Allen loved his parents, his in- 
laws, his brothers, his nieces and neph-
ews, but nothing compared to his love 
for Lynda, Lucie, and Sophie. He was 
not just a proud dad who boasted of his 
daughters’ accomplishments big and 
small; he was better. He was a father 
who took delight in the things his 
daughters said and did, big and small. 
They were cherished. May they under-
stand today and always that we loved 
Chris, and he loved them. 
I always looked forward to my brief-
ings with Chris. For one, he got my 
jokes. He understood my references to 
radio and television shows and person-
alities that my other staff would have 
to research and look up. But he was 
also understanding of the history of 
the issues, even those not in his port-
folio.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S273 
January 16, 2020 
He was an excellent steward of my 
priorities on the Finance Committee, 
so much so they stole him from me. At 
the time I told him, ‘‘Listen, you still 
work for me, you are just sitting down 
the hall.’’ 
To illustrate Chris’ popularity, I 
would like to share this story. 
There is an annual, all-day legisla-
tive meeting held in Washington for a 
Kansas group that requires a lot of 
preparation. My staff must be able to 
speak about a variety of topics and dif-
ficult issues before an audience of at 
least 100 Kansans. At one of these such 
meetings, Chris had just left my office 
to work at tax nerd nirvana, the Sen-
ate Finance Committee. I called him 
back to answer a few tax questions 
while my new staffer transitioned into 
the role. Before Chris was scheduled to 
arrive, a number of questions about 
taxes came up and my staff deferred to 
him, mentioning they would wait for 
the ‘‘real tax guy’’ to show up. Their 
repeated deference to him built up a 
feeling of anticipation in the room. At 
long last, Chris strolls in, and heads 
swivel around to the back of the room 
to see the great tax man cometh. It 
was like Elvis had entered the building. 
The audience got to their feet and gave 
him a standing ovation. One man was 
even moved to testify how Chris had 
helped his community on a rural tax 
issue and it had made all of the dif-
ference. And at the front of the room 
on the panel, there sat Chris in his dap-
per jacket, his head tilted back and his 
beaming smile. He loved to help and 
they loved him. 
Whether it was the tax reform bill or 
pension legislation, Chris’ brilliant 
mind made the measure better—every 
time. And his work will have a long 
lasting influence on our Nation and lit-
erally millions of Americans. What a 
career Chris Allen had. 
Everyone in this room will probably 
agree that Chris’s best stories were 
about himself, and he was usually his 
own punchline. Something had hap-
pened to him. He had messed some-
thing up, or he had gleefully embar-
rassed his daughters. You can hear him 
now. I was a bit player in one of his fa-
vorite tales. It was his first Finance 
Committee hearing working for me. 
Chris had prepped for days—weeks 
probably. He was both nervous and ex-
cited. As we walked over to the com-
mittee room, he told me he was calling 
Lynda, hoping she could watch the 
hearing on CSPAN and catch him sit-
ting behind the dais. 
So I decided to have a little fun with 
Chris. As the time for questions got to 
the Senator next to me, I very dra-
matically motioned to Chris. Chris 
looked shocked—I am sure he was 
thinking, ‘‘Oh no, what could I have 
forgotten to tell him.’’ Chris leaned in, 
and I put my hand to the side of my 
mouth: ‘‘Chris, this is your moment. 
Look very serious. Nod your head a few 
times. Now point at the paper I am 
holding—now tell me something very 
crucial . . . we are going to make sure 
Lynda sees you!’’ 
Chris got the biggest kick out of it, 
and we met the goal—he was on 
CSPAN. So while we take the issues 
and the policy very seriously, and we 
negotiate very intensely—and Chris 
could sure do that—we can also stop 
for a minute to appreciate where we 
are and what a privilege it is to do 
these jobs. As I said, Chris never forgot 
or took it for granted. He appreciated 
every minute in the Senate. 
I understand Lucie has shared a link 
to a Google doc for Chris’s friends and 
loved ones to share their ‘‘short but in-
teresting stories about Chris.’’ I en-
courage everyone to do so. These sto-
ries will be a treasure trove for Lynda, 
Sophie, and Lucie. I hope you can pre-
serve them in some way with his gene-
alogy work. I know he would like that. 
I will conclude with a note to Lynda 
and the girls: I always say you are only 
as good as your staff; it is your friends 
and family who make you what you 
are. In my office, staff are family. 
Chris was family; you will always be 
family. Besides, Chris still works for 
me. He is just sitting and smiling a few 
floors up.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING OXFORD-BELLEVUE 
FERRY 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to name Oxford-Bellevue Ferry, 
believed to be our Nation’s oldest pri-
vately owned ferry, as the U.S. Senate 
Small Business of the Week. 
Currently owned and operated by 
Judy and Tom Bixler, the ferry has 
transported residents and tourists be-
tween the towns of Oxford and Bellevue 
across the Tred Avon River since 1683— 
more than 90 years before the Colonies 
came together to form the United 
States, making it one of the oldest 
companies in the country. 
Over the past three centuries, the 
ferry has become a part of the fabric of 
the community, with some residents 
calling it ‘‘the pulse of the river.’’ Resi-
dents have also come to associate the 
sound of the ferry’s engine with the 
turning of the seasons: the first sounds 
mark the beginning of spring, while the 
ferry’s final rumble of the year lets 
them know that fall has arrived. 
Tom and Judy purchased the ferry 
route and moved to Maryland in 2001. 
Since then, they have not only been 
good stewards of the ferry’s history, 
but they have become pillars in the Ox-
ford community and leaders in Mary-
land’s tourism industry. 
Last year, Judy was appointed chair 
of the Maryland Tourism Development 
Board, where she advocates for Mary-
land’s tourism industry and helps mar-
ket Maryland as a tourist destination. 
In 2018, Tom and Judy were awarded 
the Community Impact Award by the 
Talbot County Department of Eco-
nomic Development and Tourism for 
their commitment to serving Talbot 
County, its visitors, and its residents. 
I was proud to stand with Tom and 
Judy for the Oxford-Bellevue Ferry’s 
325th anniversary celebration in 2008 
and am proud to recognize their con-
tinued success today. I hope the ferry 
will still be transporting Marylanders 
and tourists across the Tred Avon 
River for many years to come.∑

TRIBUTE TO LINDA ROST 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Linda Rost of Fallon County for being 
named Montana’s 2020 Teacher of the 
Year. 
Linda is a highly qualified science 
teacher at Baker High School with a 
master’s degree in science education 
from Montana State University. Linda 
has been inspiring students and moti-
vating them to dig deeper when it 
comes to science education. The folks 
in Fallon County are very proud of 
Linda’s prestigious recognition. 
Because of the size of Baker High 
School, Linda teaches multiple age 
groups. While it is a joy, it is also one 
of the many challenges that comes 
from teaching at a small rural school. 
Linda goes above and beyond to find a 
variety of ways to connect with each 
student ensuring they understand the 
course material in a fun and engaging 
way. 
The Montana Teacher of the Year 
award is a long and competitive proc-
ess. After interacting with several se-
lection committees made up of top edu-
cation leaders from across Montana, 
Linda was selected as the 2020 winner. 
Linda will now go on to represent Mon-
tana in the 2020 National Teacher of 
the Year competition. 
It is my honor to recognize Linda for 
her dedication to teaching young Mon-
tanans. Fallon County and Montana 
are very fortunate to have a teacher 
like Linda to ensure that our rural stu-
dents are getting the highest quality 
education possible.∑

TRIBUTE TO KARTHIK AND RAHUL 
CHALUMURI 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize Karthik and Rahul 
Chalumuri of Keene as January 2020’s 
Granite Staters of the Month for their 
efforts to organize donation drives at 
their school to support patients at a 
local cancer center. 
Karthik and Rahul, fraternal twins 
attending Keene High School, have 
been involved in their local community 
from a young age. When they were 5 
years old, their parents brought them 
to volunteer at their local soup kitch-
en, and helped instill in them the im-
portance of giving back to their com-
munity. 
As they headed into their senior year 
at Keene High School, these two young 
men decided that they wanted to give 
back in a big way before they headed 
off to college. They founded a club at 
their school, Students for Hope, to or-
ganize donation drives with the intent

of sending care packages to Cheshire 
Medical Center’s Norris Cotton Cancer 
Center-Kingsbury 
Pavilion, 
which 
would distribute the care packages to 
their patients. Rahul, who plans to 
study computer science in college, de-
signed the group’s website from scratch 
to provide resources on how to donate. 
The group began their first donation 
drive in August. The brothers had low 
expectations for turnout and were 
shocked when local businesses and in-
dividuals in their community came to-
gether to donate a substantial amount 
of items for these care packages. 
Since then, they have organized two 
more donation drives around both 
Thanksgiving and Christmas and plan 
to hold another one in February 
around 
Valentine’s 
Day. 
Although 
Rahul and Karthik are heading to col-
lege in the fall, they have tapped 
younger students to lead the organiza-
tion next year. 
I 
want 
to 
commend 
Rahul 
and 
Karthik for their dedication to improv-
ing the lives of people who are less for-
tunate and recruiting others to do the 
same. I know I join the rest of the 
Keene community and all Granite 
Staters in thanking Rahul and Karthik 
for exemplifying the all-hands-on-deck 
spirit of New Hampshire.∑

TRIBUTE TO CARL ADRIAN 
∑ Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a close friend, 
ally, and devoted public servant, Mr. 
Carl Adrian, as he retires from a 16- 
year career supporting our national se-
curity, environmental cleanup, eco-
nomic growth, job creation, and fur-
thering the ever-expanding missions of 
the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and 
Pacific Northwest National Labora-
tory, PNNL, as well as advancements 
in innovation and more tied to each of 
these in my home State of Washington. 
Mr. Adrian, retiring president and 
CEO of Tri-Cities Development Coun-
cil—TRIDEC—began his service to the 
Pasco, Richland, West Richland, and 
Kennewick cities, also known as the 
TriCities, on September 1, 2003. Mr. 
Adrian arrived in the Tri-Cities as a 
transplant, being born and raised in 
Omaha, NE, where he graduated from 
Westside High School. Mr. Adrian then 
obtained his bachelor of arts in polit-
ical science, geography, and later a 
masters of administration in urban and 
economic geography from the Univer-
sity of Iowa. 
Prior to Mr. Adrian’s tenure with 
TRIDEC, he spent significant time sup-
porting 
economic 
development 
throughout the central region of the 
United States through his work with 
multiple organizations. He served com-
munities in Casper, WY, the Quad-City 
area of both Iowa and Illinois, and 
Cedar Valley located in Waterloo/Cedar 
Falls, IA, before embarking upon his 
last enterprise in the Tri-Cities. 
Mr. Adrian has devoted his life to 
supporting commerce and new innova-
tion in the region. In his role at 
TRIDEC, Mr. Adrian has been one of 
the Tri-Cities most effective advocates 
to Congress, frequently working to en-
sure members of Washington State’s 
congressional delegation were abreast 
of the concerns and needs of the com-
munity while also helping to strength-
en federal support for Central Wash-
ington priorities, including working to 
successfully 
expand 
Washington 
State’s wine industry, signing vital 
MOUs with Hong Kong to bolster the 
local economy, and more. Mr. Adrian’s 
dedication to inclusive collaboration 
ensures important stakeholders are 
never left uninformed on the needs of 
the Tri-Cities area, and through his ro-
bust advocacy, the region has seen sig-
nificant 
population 
and 
economic 
growth as well as industry expansion, 
offering many Tri-Citians a new path 
to the American Dream. 
As TRIDEC’s longest-serving presi-
dent, Mr. Adrian has successfully led 
efforts to help expand the Tri-Cities 
airport and offer nonstop daily flights 
to key regional airports; create the 
Manhattan Project National Historical 
Park in 2015; promote services to at-
tract, retain, and improve commerce 
and economic development throughout 
the region, which led to significant job 
growth, population growth, and the de-
velopment of several new business ven-
tures in the TriCities. 
It is clear to me that Washington 
State has benefited greatly from Mr. 
Adrian’s vision and passion for pro-
moting what the Tri-Cities commu-
nity, its workforce, the Hanford Site, 
and PNNL have to offer, as I have seen 
firsthand both at home and in the 
other Washington. His work is evident 
in the progress that has been made on 
environmental cleanup at Hanford, as 
well as his work to help plan a future 
for the Tri-Cities that looks past clean-
up operations towards preserving the 
region’s rich history through designa-
tions of the B Reactor as a National 
Historic 
Landmark 
and 
Manhattan 
Project National Historical Park, and 
seeking out new, emerging opportuni-
ties like small modular reactors to 
help grow additional economic oppor-
tunities in the region and boost Wash-
ington State’s leadership role in cut-
ting-edge energy technologies to com-
bat climate change. Through all of 
this, he has remained as committed as 
they come. Last August, when I had 
the good fortune to get one more visit 
with Mr. Adrian at PNNL, I was 
unsurprised that he still carried the 
same enthusiasm and pride for his 
work as he did during his first visit 
with me in 2003. 
Mr. Adrian has been critical to my 
work in the U.S. Senate to ensure the 
Federal Government is keeping its 
commitments to central Washington, 
and he has made a tremendous impact 
on the Tri-Cities community, Wash-
ington State, and our Nation. Today, I 
join with others throughout the State 
of Washington in thanking him for his 
many years of service. I congratulate 
Mr. Carl Adrian on his retirement and 
wish him and his wife Rheta the best of 
luck as they write their next chapter 
together.∑

TRIBUTE TO ROBERT LONG 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, would like 
to congratulate one of my fellow Ida-
hoans, Robert Long, on winning first 
place in the Mongol Derby. This annual 
competition held in August brings peo-
ple from around the world to race 
across the Mongolian Steppe on horse-
back. Robert finished the course with-
out any setbacks. This is truly one of 
the toughest tests of skill and endur-
ance for any horseman or woman, and 
I am proud that an Idahoan rep-
resented the United States with such 
excellence. 
The Mongol Derby course follows the 
ancient path of Genghis Khan’s horse 
messenger system first set up over 800 
years ago. The course crosses 600 miles 
of some of Mongolia’s harshest terrain 
and takes riders over a week to com-
plete. Contestants are not only chal-
lenged by the terrain but also by the 
traditional methods of the race. The 
hundreds of horses that shoulder the 
journey are recruited from the local 
Mongolians’ 
herds. 
Riders 
change 
horses every 25 miles, just as the an-
cient Mongols did. Thus, contestants 
must have the skill to adapt to each 
new mount and the instinct to ride 
within the limits of its strengths and 
weaknesses. Although the riders are 
racing towards the finish, they are also 
responsible for taking care of their 
horses’ wellbeing and ensuring they are 
not overworked or injured during the 
journey. Robert’s experience with ani-
mals helped him to win the race with-
out any veterinary penalties. 
Robert’s victory was surely an out-
come of his extensive experience work-
ing with horses on the American West-
ern terrain. ‘‘Cowboy Bob,’’ as he is 
known by his close friends, was raised 
in Wyoming and now lives in Boise, IA. 
He trained for the Mongol Derby across 
the American West, where the rough 
terrain is not so different from that of 
the Mongolian Steppe. 
Robert not only made an impression 
as a master horseman but also as a gra-
cious guest. The course covers a vast 
area inhabited by Mongolian nomad 
herders, who volunteer their horses for 
the competitors in the race at each 
stop. Robert presented each herder 
with a blue ribbon from his past com-
petitions, which he brought after learn-
ing the significance of the color blue in 
Mongolia, the Land of Eternal Blue 
Sky. 
In taking part in this race and per-
forming with thoughtfulness and mas-
tery, Robert exemplified how well 
Americans can relate to other peoples 
and cultures. U.S.-Mongolia relations 
have been growing stronger since our 
two nations established diplomatic ties 
over 30 years ago. That the Mongol 
Derby attracts riders from across the 
world demonstrates Mongolia’s ability 
to build global connections through

RECOGNIZING TWO SISTERS NEW 
BEGINNINGS, LLC 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, it is 
my privilege to recognize a unique 
Florida small business for its valuable 
contributions to the local economy and 
its dedicated efforts to sustainability 
and 
dignified 
work. 
Today, 
I 
am 
pleased to honor Two Sisters New Be-
ginnings, LLC of Monticello, FL, as the 
Senate Small Business of the Week. 
Founded in 2013 by sisters Sandra 
Hood and Pat Marchman, Two Sisters 
New Beginnings is an eclectic antique 
and repurposed furniture shop. After 
purchasing and refinishing a chest, Pat 
and Sandra discovered a passion for 
repurposing vintage furniture and de-
cided to create a place for local artists 
to sell their unique items. Today, Two 
Sisters New Beginnings has become an 
asset to the Monticello community, 
supplying locally sourced repurposed 
furniture, antiques, collectibles, and 
more to both residents and visitors. 
Since its establishment, the business’s 
customer base has grown steadily, as 
has the number of local artists and 
craftsmen who seek to showcase their 
products in the store. The storefront 
has become such a popular destination 
that Two Sisters New Beginnings ex-

Two Sisters New Beginnings has been 
a long supporter of the Monticello 
community, 
participating 
in 
local 
events such as the Mainstreet Monti-
cello Christmas Kickoff and Jefferson 
County Historical Association Home 
and Heritage Tour. It is a member of 
Monticello Main Street, a business de-
velopment and nonprofit organization 
that promotes local businesses, his-
toric preservation, and tourism within 
the community. Two Sisters New Be-
ginnings consistently donates to nu-
merous charitable events in the local 
community, including the Big Bend 
Hospice Joyful Noise Concert and the 
David Hobbs Memorial Barrel Race. 
They have served as a silver sponsor of 
the Teal Magnolias Ladies Golf Tour-
nament, an event that raises awareness 
for ovarian cancer each year. Addition-
ally, the vendors of Two Sisters New 
Beginnings share in this charitable 
mindset, often donating a portion of 
their sales to local charities like Ref-
uge House. Two Sisters New Begin-
nings is an unparalleled example of 
how small businesses can strengthen 
and support a community by giving 
back and creating dignified jobs. 
Two Sisters New Beginnings is a 
prime example of the integral role 
small businesses play in our local com-
munities. Its community first mindset 
and dedication to dignified work make 
it a notable and integral member of the 
city of Monticello. Congratulations 
again on being named the Senate 
Small Business of the Week. I look for-
ward 
to 
watching 
your 
continued 
growth and success.∑

to feel ‘‘high’’ øin contrast to the chemical 
tetrahydrocannabidol (THC)¿; and 
Whereas, The federal Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) states that products 
such as food additives and dietary supple-
ments that contain cannabidiol are illegal 
under federal law; and 
Whereas, Within the past three years, more 
than 1,500 cannabidiol products have come to 
the market without a clear approach for reg-
ulation or any plan from the FDA to balance 
consumer 
access 
and 
protect 
consumer 
health; and 
Whereas, The lack of clear policy towards 
cannabidiol from the FDA and the patch-
work regulation of the substance by the 
states øcreate¿ has created a complicated 
legal framework øfor¿ in which cannabidiol 
companies øfor their operations¿ are attempt-
ing to operate; and 
Whereas, The lack of clear regulatory guid-
ance includes uncertainty as to the level of 
cannabidiol content that is safe and appropriate 
for human consumption. This uncertainty can 
present a risk to the public health, as consumers 
have access to a wide variety of cannabidiol 
products but no clear direction as to what 
amount is safe to consume in a single sitting or 
over the course of time; and 
Whereas, As a result of this uncertain legal 
framework, 
it 
has 
become 
difficult 
for 
cannabidiol companies to participate in inter-
state commerce øfor national cannabidiol 
companies is difficult¿ because banks, insur-
ance companies, and merchant service com-
panies are uneasy about providing services 
to cannabidiol companies, which may be at 
øthe¿ risk of øinvolvement from¿ investiga-
tion or adverse enforcement actions by the 
FDA; and 
Whereas, By enacting legislation that 
specifies a safe daily level of cannabidiol 
consumption, the President and Congress of 
the United States would øbe able to¿ help 
allow individuals to experience the ømed-
ical¿ holistic and therapeutic benefits of 
cannabidiol while ensuring consumer safety 
and øalso generate¿ facilitate the participation 
of cannabicliol companies in interstate com-
merce, thereby generating increased economic 
activity øfrom all interstate commerce for 
cannabidiol 
companies¿ 
nationwide, 
now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the State of New 
Jersey: 
1. This House respectfully urges the Presi-
dent and Congress of the United States to 
øestablish¿ enact legislation establishing a safe 
daily consumption level øof¿ for cannabidiol 
øconsumption¿. 
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted 
by the Secretary of the Senate to the Presi-
dent and Vice President of the United 
States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of 
the United States Senate, the Speaker and 
Minority Leader of the House of Representa-
tives, and each member of the United States 
Congress elected from this State.

S279 
January 16, 2020 
shall, in accordance with applicable proce-
dures for the appropriate handling of classi-
fied information, promptly provide reason-
able access to documents, statistical data, 
and any other information that the Comp-
troller General determines is necessary to 
conduct the study and develop the report re-
quired under subsection (b). 
(f) INPUT FROM CERTAIN NON-FEDERAL EN-

of experts from certain non-Federal entities, 
including experts from— 
(1) the scientific and medical research 
community; 
(2) the State and local law enforcement 
community; and 
(3) the civil rights and criminal justice re-
form communities. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to join my Judiciary Com-
mittee colleagues, Chairman GRAHAM 
and Senator DURBIN, as the lead co-
sponsor of the ‘‘Temporary Reauthor-
ization and Study of the Emergency 
Scheduling 
of 
Fentanyl 
Analogues 
Act.’’ 
This bill will ensure that fentanyl-re-
lated substances remain in Schedule I 
and will help deter the manufacture of 
fentanyl-related substances responsible 
for overdose deaths. 
In 2018, the number of fentanyl-re-
lated deaths in the United States in-
creased from 28,000 to 32,000. 
This is more than double the number 
of heroin-related overdose deaths. It is 
a staggering number of lives lost that 
we simply cannot accept. 
To address the increasing deaths, the 
Drug 
Enforcement 
Administration 
(DEA) issued a temporary order to con-
trol fentanyl-related substances, or 
fentanyl analogues, as a class. 
That order is set to expire on Feb-
ruary 6th. 
Based on the information my office 
has received from the DEA and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, it is clear that this order has 
been effective. 
The number of law enforcement en-
counters of new fentanyl analogues has 
decreased from 8 to 2. That is signifi-
cant and means that the order has re-
duced the supply of new fentanyl ana-
logues by 75 percent. 
This decrease in supply has reduced 
the need for widespread prosecutions of 
fentanyl-related offenses. In fact, since 
the DEA’s order went into effect, it is 
my understanding that there has only 
been two related prosecutions. 
Additionally, although the number of 
fentanyl-related overdose deaths has 
continued to increase, the rate at 
which these deaths has increased has 
declined significantly. 
For example, between the 12 month 
periods ending January 2017 and Janu-
ary 2018, fentanyl deaths increased by 
nearly 36 percent. 
Comparatively, between the 12 month 
periods ending May 2018 and May 2019, 
which is the latest data available, the 
rate of fentanyl deaths only increased 
by just over 9 percent. 
I would have preferred a long-term 
solution to addressing this problem 
that can gamer strong bipartisan sup-
port, and I am eager to continue work-
ing with my colleagues on such a solu-
tion. 
However, given the limited amount 
of time that we have before the DEA’s 
temporary order expires, we cannot sit 
idly by and do nothing. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
legislation. Given the staggering num-
ber of overdose deaths associated with 
fentanyl-related substances, inaction is 
not an option. 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Ms. MURKOWSKI): 
S. 3203. A bill to amend title 38, 
United States Code, to codify the re-
quirements for appointment, qualifica-
tions, and pay for therapeutic medical 
physicists of the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. Physi-
cians at the Department of Veterans 
Affairs depend on Therapeutic Medical 
Physicists to help plan and deliver crit-
ical radiation treatment to patients. 
Inadequate support from these medical 
professionals can place veterans at risk 
for radiation injury or inappropriate 
treatment. As radiation therapy has 
become more sophisticated and more 
common over the past fifteen years, 
the Department has struggled to re-
cruit and retain Therapeutic Medical 
Physicists. The average salary in the 
private sector for a PhD board certified 
Therapeutic Medical Physicists with 
ten to fourteen years of work experi-
ence is approximately $190,000, but cur-
rent law limits salaries for these em-
ployees at the Department to $166,500, 
inhibiting the Department’s ability to 
recruit qualified individuals to fill 
these positions. 
When faced with Therapeutic Medical 
Physicist shortages, the Department 
outsources this work to expensive con-
tractors. Consequently, the Depart-
ment substantially overspends on these 
services, which could be done more re-
liably in-house and at a much lower 
cost. Furthermore, contracts for TMP 
services are awarded for a short period, 
which results in frequent turnover that 
can be potentially dangerous from the 
perspective of quality care and patient 
safety. 
Today, I am pleased to introduce the 
Department of Veterans Affairs Thera-
peutic Medical Physicist Pay Cap Re-
lief Act with my colleague Senator 
MURKOWSKI. This legislation would im-
prove the recruitment and retention of 
Therapeutic Medical Physicists by al-
lowing the Department to pay these 
professionals at rates competitive with 
the private sector. This bill would also 
improve the quality of care for vet-
erans by reducing the turnover of 
Therapeutic Medical Physicists, and 
lead to lower total costs for the De-
partment by eliminating the use of ex-
pensive contractors. With these sav-
ings, the Department could raise sala-
ries and hire more Therapeutic Medical 
Physicists. 
This commonsense, bipartisan legis-
lation is an opportunity to invest in 
professionals who treat those who have 
sacrificed for our nation, and improve 
the standard of care we provide to our 
veterans. I look forward to working 
with my colleagues to swiftly imple-
menting the provisions of the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs Therapeutic 
Medical Physicist Pay Cap Relief Act. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

SENATE RESOLUTION 474—TO AU-
THORIZE 
REPRESENTATION 
BY 
THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL IN 
THE 
CASE 
OF 
MARTIN 
F. 
MCMAHON 
V. 
SENATOR 
TED 
CRUZ, ET AL 
Mr. SCHUMER submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 474 
Whereas, Senators Ted Cruz, Lindsey Gra-
ham, Mitch McConnell, and Rand Paul have 
been named as defendants in the case of Mar-
tin F. McMahon v. Senator Ted Cruz, et al., 
Case No. 1:19–cv–03774–TSC, currently pend-
ing in the United States District Court for 
the District of Columbia; 
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 
704(a)(1) of the Ethics in Government Act of 
1978, 2 U.S.C. §§ 288b(a) and 288c(a)(1), the 
Senate may direct its counsel to defend 
Members of the Senate in civil actions relat-
ing to their official responsibilities: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is 
authorized to represent Senators Ted Cruz, 
Lindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell, and 
Rand Paul, and any other Member who may 
be named as a defendant in the case of Mar-
tin F. McMahon v. Senator Ted Cruz, et al. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I send 
to the desk a resolution authorizing 
representation by the Senate Legal 
Counsel and ask for its immediate con-
sideration. 
Mr. President, this resolution con-
cerns a pro se lawsuit recently filed in 
Federal court in the District of Colum-
bia against Senators CRUZ, GRAHAM, 
MCCONNELL, and PAUL. In this lawsuit, 
plaintiff seeks to obtain judicial super-
vision over the upcoming impeachment 
trial of the President under the Ninth 
Amendment. Plaintiffs suit is subject 
to dismissal on jurisdictional grounds 
as the Constitution grants the Senate 
the sole power to try impeachments, 
and the Judicial Branch has no power 
to oversee the actions and participa-
tion of Senators in an impeachment 
trial. This resolution would authorize 
the Senate Legal Counsel to represent 
the named defendant Senators in order 
to seek dismissal of the claims against 
them.

following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 478 
Whereas providing a diversity of choices in

Whereas high-quality K–12 education envi-
ronments of all varieties are available in the 
United States, including traditional public

Whereas talented teachers and school lead-
ers in each of the education environments 
prepare children to achieve their dreams; 
Whereas more families than ever before in 
the United States actively choose the best 
education for their children; 
Whereas more public awareness of the 
issue of parental choice in education can in-
form additional families of the benefits of 
proactively 
choosing 
challenging, 
moti-
vating, and effective education environments 
for their children; 
Whereas the process by which parents 
choose schools for their children is non-
political, nonpartisan, and deserves the ut-
most respect; and 
Whereas tens of thousands of events are 
planned to celebrate the benefits of edu-
cational choice during the tenth annual Na-
tional School Choice Week, held the week of

dations of the greater Bay Area Houston com-
munities. 
Dr. Hellyer grew up in Hays, Kansas, a 
small town of nearly 12,000 in the heart of 
wheat and cattle country. She is the second of 
four children—three girls and a boy. Her father 
was a truck driver for Rainbow Bread and later 
served as a custodian at the local elementary 
school. Her mother was a housewife until her 
youngest sister started school, and then 
began a career as a school cook and baker. 
Dr. Hellyer earned her Bachelor of Science 
in Accounting from Fort Hays State University, 
and both her master’s degree in business ad-
ministration and a doctorate in community col-
lege leadership from the University of Texas at 
Austin. She received the Distinguished Grad-
uate Award from the College of Education at 
the University of Texas at Austin in spring 
2009. Dr. Hellyer is also a Certified Public Ac-
countant (CPA) licensed in Texas. While in 
college, she received many scholarships that 
helped finance her education and credits her 
success to the generosity of University donors. 
Working for Fortune 500 companies in ac-
counting and finance, eventually led Dr. 
Hellyer down to Houston where she met her 
husband, Rusty. Together, Rusty and Brenda 
worked with several small businesses they 
owned in the Deer Park and Pasadena com-
munities. She strongly believes in serving the 
community, and her first involvement with San 
Jacinto College was as a volunteer with the 
San Jacinto College Foundation. 
Since 2009, Dr. Hellyer has served as 
Chancellor of San Jacinto College, a notable 
Houston institution with nearly 30,000 stu-
dents, four primary campuses, and an annual 
budget of $252 million. Her involvement with 
the College began in 1996 as an inaugural di-
rector for the San Jacinto College Foundation. 
She later served in a number of executive po-
sitions at the college, including Executive Vice 
President for Resource Development, Vice 
Chancellor for Fiscal Affairs, Chief Financial 
Officer, and Executive Vice Chancellor. 
After becoming Chancellor of San Jacinto 
College in May 2009, Dr. Hellyer led a rig-
orous strategic planning process to transform 
the image of the college. During her tenure, 
the college has made major infrastructure ren-
ovations and developed award-winning pro-
grams including its Maritime Training and 
Technology Center, Generation Park Campus, 
Aerospace 
Training 
facility, 
and 
the 
LyondellBasell Center for Petrochemical, En-
ergy, and Technology. 
These efforts have transformed San Jacinto 
College into a modern community college, of-
fering students education in collaborative 
classrooms and hands on training with equip-
ment they will encounter as they move into the 
workforce. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Hellyer for her 
dedication as Chancellor of San Jacinto Col-
lege, and for her outstanding community en-
gagement in the greater Bay Area.

IN CELEBRATION OF VIETNAMESE 
NEW YEAR TET 2020 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in celebration of T�t, Vietnamese New Year, 
for 2020. The large Vietnamese community in 
Orange County will gather together in Little 
Saigon to celebrate the Year of the Rat. I am 
once again honored to join them in observing 
their traditions and rich culture. 
T�t marks the beginning of a new spring 
where families can reunite with their ances-
tors, reconnect with their loved ones, and 
move beyond their troubles and difficulties 
from the past year. Furthermore, they cele-
brate and hope for a better year ahead of 
them. The celebration brings together the Viet-
namese community in Little Saigon, the larg-
est Vietnamese community outside of Viet-
nam. Fifty thousand participants and over sixty 
organizations will gather to celebrate with 
food, music, dance, and so much more. The 
theme for this year’s parade is ‘‘With Profound 
Gratitude and Appreciation,’’ where partici-
pants will express their gratitude to the ances-
tors who sacrificed to give forthcoming gen-
erations a brighter future. Another aspect of 
this year’s celebration is an expression of the 
community’s appreciation to the United States. 
In the nearly fifty years since the fall of Sai-
gon, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese 
refugees have resettled and built strong com-
munities across the United States. The United 
States accepted and looked after the Viet-
namese community and offered the oppor-
tunity to start a new life in this great country. 
Here in America, they have the freedom to 
celebrate their basic human rights and enjoy 
the communities they have built after reset-
tling. 
A shining star of the Vietnamese American 
community of Little Saigon is the vibrant group 
of media outlets—Nguoi Viet Daily News, Vien 
Dong Daily News, Viet Bao Daily News, Viet-
nam America TV (VNA–TV), Saigon Broad-
casting Television Network (SBTN), Little Sai-
gon Radio, Central Broadcasting Network 
(CBN), and many more. They are committed 
to providing reliable news, preserving the Viet-
namese language and culture, and enriching 
the lives and experiences of the Vietnamese 
community in the United States. 
Madam Speaker and fellow colleagues, 
please join me in celebration of the Viet-
namese New Year, T�t 2020.

HONORING DAVIS S. WELCH 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor Davis S. Welch as he retires fol-
lowing 38 years of distinguished service to the 
Army and the nation. Throughout his extraor-
dinary career, he embodied the duty, honor, 
and loyalty that makes the U.S. Army the 
world’s premier fighting force. 
Davis’ commitment to investing his gifts, tal-
ents, and abilities in service of his nation is a 
deeply held creed that speaks to the gen-
erosity and activism of a true and devoted pa-
triot. Throughout his career, he earned numer-
ous academic and military accolades, includ-
ing the Legion of Merit, that garnered the re-
spect and admiration of his peers. Davis was 
instrumental in balancing immediate needs 
within resource constraints while expertly and 
expeditiously funding peacetime and war-re-
lated Theater, Joint, and Operational Needs 
Statements. His resume tells the story of a 
man unafraid to embrace the challenges that 
forge the leaders our nation needs.

For near four decades, Davis positively im-

beginning of a new adventure. It is my honor

of Davis Welch as he starts this new chapter 
of his life. On behalf of a grateful nation, I 
thank him for his superb work and wish him 
the very best.

HONORING COLTON MATTHEW 
FRENCH 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Colton Matthew 
French. Colton is a very special young man 
who has exemplified the finest qualities of citi-
zenship and leadership by taking an active 
part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 
1412, and earning the most prestigious award 
of Eagle Scout. 
Colton has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Colton has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Col-
ton has contributed to his community through 
his Eagle Scout project. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Colton Matthew French for 
his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of 
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

PROTECTING OLDER WORKERS 
AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act. This bipartisan and 
commonsense legislation will level the playing 
field for older workers in Central New York 
and across the country by restoring the ability 
to combat age discrimination in the workplace. 
Speaking with Central New Yorkers, I have 
heard from many older workers who have ex-
pressed concern over the prevalence of 
ageism in the workplace. My constituents are 
not alone either. According to a recent AARP 
report, 3 in 5 older workers have experienced 
age discrimination in the workplace. Despite 
this statistic, the recent 2009 Supreme Court’s 
decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, 
Inc., has weakened federal protections against 
age discrimination, making it more difficult for 
older Americans to prove age discrimination 
and rectify these instances. For this reason, I 
am proud to support the Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act. Under this 
bipartisan legislation, we will take the nec-
essary steps to protect older workers against 
age discrimination in the workplace by restor-
ing the pre-2009 legal standards for age dis-
crimination claims. 
Mr. Chair, age should never be a factor in 
employment decisions. Whether an older 
worker is forced out of a job or receiving lower 
pay due to age, older workers in Central New 
York and in the United States must be pro-
tected from age discrimination in the work-
place. Troubling statistics published by AARP 
make it clear that age discrimination in the 
workplace is an issue that must be addressed 
by Congress. I urge my colleagues in the 
House to act in a bipartisan manner to protect 
older workers against age discrimination by 
supporting the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
MARK 
GAFFNEY FOR A DISTINGUISHED 
CAREER 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the distin-
guished career of Mark Gaffney as he retires 
from his position at Teamsters Local Union 
No. 214. 
As a lifelong Michigan resident, Mark 
Gaffney has become a cornerstone of the 
Michigan labor community. Upon receiving his 
bachelor’s degree in Philosophy and master’s 
degree in Labor Relations from Michigan State 
University, Gaffney launched a successful thir-
ty-year career in workforce issues and labor 
relations. Beyond his role at Teamsters Local 
Union No. 214, Gaffney has also served as 
President of the Michigan AFL–CIO, an asso-
ciation of forty national labor unions rep-
resenting over 700,000 Michiganders. In addi-
tion, Gaffney has directed the Economic Alli-
ance of Michigan for twelve years as a co- 
chair, served as the Chair of the Board of 
Human Resources Development, Inc., was 
part of the Executive Committee of the Michi-
gan Council for Labor and Economic Growth, 
and was appointed by Mayor Duggan to serve 
on the Detroit Workforce Board. Aside from 
his work with labor relations, Gaffney also has 
extensive healthcare experience and even 
served as a member of the Board of Directors 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. In 
2016, Gaffney was elected statewide to serve 
an eight-year term on the Board of Governors 
of Wayne State University. 
Mark Gaffney’s professional accomplish-
ments demonstrate his unrelenting commit-
ment to the people of Michigan. During his 
time at Teamsters Local Union No. 214, the 
largest Teamsters Local in Michigan, Gaffney 
has represented and negotiated on behalf of 
Michigan municipal and education workers 
from all walks of life. Yet, Gaffney’s dedication 
is not exclusive to his role within the labor 
union. Instead, Gaffney has endeavored to 
represent Michiganders in all capacities, en-
suring their needs are being properly met. 
Gaffney is recognized amongst his peers and 
colleagues as a compassionate, ambitious, 
and humble leader who strives for excellence 
without seeking praise or recognition for any 
of his significant accomplishments. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating Mark Gaffney’s career 
with Teamsters Local Union No. 214. Mark 
Gaffney’s unrelenting commitment to our state 
is remarkable and I deeply appreciate his con-
tinued leadership in our community.

HON. HARLEY ROUDA

Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today

of Vietnamese culture, civic engagement, and 
leadership development within the community. 
Since its founding, it has shown an unwaver-
ing dedication to community service and advo-
cacy for social justice, both domestically and 
internationally. 
UVSA’s volunteers are students, alumni, 
professional, educators, and community lead-
ers. When not organizing the Te´t Festival, 
UVSA provides grants to other non-profits 
across Southern California, holds leadership 
development activities at high schools and col-
leges, participates in Black April commemora-
tions, and holds inter-collegiate events with 
their respective Vietnamese student associa-
tions. 
I ask all members to join me in recognizing 
the extraordinary work and contributions of the 
Union of Vietnamese Student Associations of 
Southern California.

IN HONOR OF DANIEL STEWARD 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Mr. Daniel Steward on 
his recent retirement from a remarkable four-
teen-year career as first selectman for the 
town of Waterford, Connecticut. This tenure 
makes Dan the longest serving first selectman 
since the founding of the town in 1801 and en-
sures his legacy will last forever. 
Dan was born and raised in Waterford and 
worked in the southeastern Connecticut region 
his entire adult life. He honed his managerial 
skills at Southern New England Telephone 
Company where he worked for twenty-eight 
years and then spent another three years as 
supervisor in information technologies at Do-
minion Energy’s Millstone Power Plant, Con-
necticut’s largest electrical energy producer. 
While still employed in the private sector, he 
began his impressive career of public service 
working to improve the town’s public schools, 
first as president of the Parent Teacher Orga-
nization, and then when he transitioned to the 
Waterford board of education where he rose 
to the position of chair. In 2005, the people of 
Waterford elected Dan as their First Select-
man, and he hit the ground running. This win 
was especially significant for Waterford, as 
they now had the leadership of one of their 
own, a true Lancer. This first-hand knowledge 
proved crucial for the growth and success of 
the town. Not only did Dan make structural im-
provements such as building five new schools; 
he also paid close attention to the individual 
problems of Waterford’s residents. Dan’s vest-
ed interest in the town enabled him to connect 
with everyone as his peer. He took the con-
cerns of his constituents personally; his big-
gest gripe with the job being only that ‘‘he 
wanted to make everyone happy.’’ 
During his time as first selectman it became 
obvious that Dan had a gift for strong leader-
ship and embracing change, something he 
knew all too well. His own father sold their 
family’s dairy farm to developers who would 
go on to build the local Lowe’s hardware 
store, giving Dan personal experience with the 
cyclical economies of small towns. When Do-
minion Energy’s Millstone Power Station, a 
backbone of the current economy, was re-
negotiating with the state, Dan remained a 
fierce advocate for Waterford. Dan’s personal 
knowledge of the company gave him a unique 
and well-rounded perspective to facilitate a 
sustainable, long-term plan for its continued 
operation. 
As the Congressman for Waterford during 
the bulk of Dan’s tenure, I had the pleasure of 
working with him and the town on a number 
issues, such as the memorial at Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery to Vietnam hero and U.S. 
Army Captain Arnie Holm, a beloved son of 
Waterford, the development of a long term 
dredging plan for eastern Long Island Sound, 
and the recapitalization of the New England 
Central Railroad, to name just a few. I found 
Dan to be extremely thoughtful and positive, 
always focused on the big picture of making 
southeastern Connecticut’s future strong and 
healthy. Although we are from different polit-
ical parties, he approached the job of gov-
erning from a non-political, practical point of 
view which I believe is a refreshing example 
elected officials at every level of government 
should follow. 
Dan’s presence will be sorely missed at 
Town Hall, although he has certainly earned 
this next, hopefully more restful chapter that 
I’m sure he will spend with his wife, Kathy, his 
four daughters, and his nine grandchildren. 
Luckily, Waterford residents won’t have to look 
far as he will still support the community by 
going door to door for the census. Madam 
Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join 
me in thanking Dan for his service and con-
gratulating him on his retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GRAND 
OPENING 
OF 
OZONE 
HOUSE’S 
YOUTH FACILITY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the grand opening of 
Ozone House’s youth facility. 
The Ozone House is a community-based, 
non-profit organization that has been devoted 
to helping youth in crisis for the past 50 years. 
In Washtenaw County, nearly 1,300 youth ex-
perience homelessness annually due to situa-
tions that arise from neglect, abuse, mental ill-
ness, or other crises. In 1969, Ozone House 
was established to address this problem and 
help young people in the community learn how 
to lead safe, healthy, and productive lives. 
Each year, the Ozone House provides refuge 
for over 800 young people and arranges over 
4,000 hours of professional counseling serv-
ices at two locations in Ann Arbor and a drop- 
in center in Ypsilanti. 
Today, we celebrate the opening of Ozone 
House’s new youth facility. The opening of the 
newly-constructed 19,000 square-foot building 
demonstrates the organization’s continued un-
relenting commitment to youth in Michigan, as 
it allows the organization to improve its serv-
ices and counsel more youth than ever before. 
The facility will provide more space and pri-
vacy to youth navigating trauma and crisis and 
will afford them a new sense of security, sta-
bility, and consistency. In addition to 16 pri-
vate bedrooms that can sleep 32 young peo-
ple, the facility will offer counseling rooms, an 
expanded food and necessities pantry, three 
kitchens, and laundry and shower facilities. 
Ozone House’s new facility will positively im-
pact the lives of hundreds of youth throughout 
our community and empower them to get 
though even the toughest of circumstances. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the grand opening of 
Ozone House’s new youth facility. In their 
commitment to providing a safe space for 
young people to help them grow and recog-
nize their talents, the Ozone House continues 
to be an asset to the community. I am grateful 
for Ozone House’s positive impact and wish 
the organization continued success in the 
years to come.

ROE V. WADE ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I am pro- 
life, pro-family, and pro-child. While my beliefs 
are rooted in my Christian faith, I am not naı¨ve 
enough to believe that everyone shares that 
connection between faith and the sanctity of 
life. 
Yet, no matter what someone believes or 
doesn’t believe, everyone understands that life 
is precious, and it is a gift. I believe that as 
Members of Congress and as citizens, we are 
called to protect the vulnerable. This is one of 
my core beliefs. 
But being Pro-Life comes with responsibil-
ities. It’s not enough to say that you are Pro- 
Life and then walk away. ‘‘Just say no’’ isn’t 
enough when it comes to abortion. 
Women who find themselves with an un-
planned pregnancy need support. Sometimes 
they need a loving shoulder to cry on. And 
sometimes they need help to find adoption re-
sources. 
Being pro-life means not just pro-birth but 
being interested in the welfare of that child 
during their entire formative years. 
That’s why I am not only a long-time mem-
ber of the Pro-Life Caucus, but also a co-chair 
of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. 
We must speak up on behalf of the millions 
of babies aborted since Roe v. Wade, but also 
speak up for the children who have been 
saved by mothers who chose life. 
Let’s work together to find new ways to pro-
tect the most vulnerable amongst us—to advo-
cate for families to adopt children or become 
foster parents, and then promote the under-
lying structures that support these families. 
I also want to take this opportunity to thank 
President Trump and his Administration for the 
work they have done to defend the unborn, in-
cluding changing the rules for Title X and ex-
panding the Mexico City Policy.

RECOGNIZING TIM PETROSKY FOR 
HIS SERVICE AT CMS ENERGY 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my 
honor to recognize Tim Petrosky for his serv-
ice at CMS Energy. Through his exceptional 
leadership and steadfast devotion to the public 
good, Tim has become an indispensable part 
of Michigan’s First District. 
Tim first joined CMS Energy as the spokes-
man for Big Rock Point Nuclear Power Plant 
in 
1991. 
This 
historic 
power 
plant 
in 
Charlevoix, first opened in 1962, was the first 
nuclear power plant in the state of Michigan, 
the fifth oldest in the nation, and is designated 
as a Nuclear Historic Landmark by the Amer-
ican Nuclear Soceity. While Big Rock Point 
was decommissioned in 1997, Tim’s work as 
spokesperson continued. This included ac-
companying a large piece of radioactive equip-
ment by rail car to a southern U.S. storage 
site by rail—giving him the nickname ‘‘Boxcar 
Tim.’’ 
In 2005, Tim became NW Area Manager, 
Community Affairs, where he was responsible 
for media, communication, and community ac-
tivities in three counties of the northwest 
Lower Peninsula. In this capacity, Tim has 
helped CMS Energy communicate and hear 
from the public—helping reach those in need 
during winter power outages, working with 
local communities to promote public safety 
and environmental protection, and hearing 
from members of the community on issues 
that matter most to them. With today’s ever- 
evolving world, the work of industry leaders 
like Tim has been critical in supporting the 
common good an ensuring the public trust. His 
impact on the state of Michigan cannot be 
overstated. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late Tim Petrosky for his decades of service at 
CMS Energy. Michiganders can take great 
pride in knowing the First District is home to 
such a dedicated leader. On behalf of my con-
stituents, I wish Tim all the best in his future 
endeavors.

COMCAST 
XFINITY ON THE DATE OF ITS 
STORE’S GRAND OPENING 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Comcast Xfinity and their 
employees on the date of their store’s grand 
opening in Taylor. Comcast Xfinity has be-
come an important component of our Michigan 
community by utilizing our current infrastruc-
ture and workforce to deliver more affordable, 
efficient, and assessible internet services to 
consumers statewide. 
Originally established in April 1981 as 
Comcast Cable, Xfinity has grown significantly 
and transformed the southeast Michigan com-
munity. While employing thousands of individ-
uals across Michigan, Xfinity has simulta-
neously developed new infrastructure to pro-
vide countless businesses and residents alike 
with quality cable and internet access. Their 
facilities have improved our region, show-
casing it as a competitor in the market of tech-
nology and innovation. Xfinity’s continued 
commitment to our state is exemplified in the 
company’s expansion into the Taylor commu-
nity. 
Comcast Xfinity’s investment in opening a 
Taylor facility underscores the city’s reputation 
as a center for growth, innovation, and ad-
vancement. With this new store, Xfinity will 
provide residents and businesses with the 
ability to access the latest technologies, prod-

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Comcast Xfinity during the 
grand opening of the Comcast Xfinity Store in 
Taylor. This critical investment will provide 
Michigan’s ambitious workforce and residents 
with access to the newest technologies in

COMMEMORATING 35TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF REV. DR. MARTIN LU-
THER KING, JR. HOLIDAY 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, on 
Monday, January 20, the nation observes for 
the 35th time the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Holiday. 
Each year this day is set aside for Ameri-
cans to celebrate the life and legacy of a man 
who brought hope and healing to America. 
The Martin Luther King Holiday reminds us 
that nothing is impossible when we are guided 
by the better angels of our nature. 
Dr. King’s inspiring words filled a great void 
in our nation and answered our collective 
longing to become a country that truly lived by 
its noblest principles. 
Yet, Dr. King knew that it was not enough 
just to talk the talk; he knew that he had to 
walk the walk for his words to be credible. 
And so, we commemorate on this holiday 
the man of action, who put his life on the line 
for freedom and justice every day. 
We honor the courage of a man who en-
dured harassment, threats and beatings, and 
even bombings. 
We commemorate the man who went to jail 
29 times to achieve freedom for others, and 
who knew he would pay the ultimate price for 
his leadership but kept on marching and pro-
testing and organizing anyway. 
Dr. King once said that we all have to de-
cide whether we ‘‘will walk in the light of cre-
ative altruism or the darkness of destructive 
selfishness. 
‘‘Life’s most persistent and nagging ques-
tion,’’ he said, is ‘‘what are you doing for 
others?’’ 
And when Dr. King talked about the end of 
his mortal life in one of his last sermons, on 
February 4, 1968 in the pulpit of Ebenezer 
Baptist Church, even then he lifted up the 
value of service as the hallmark of a full life: 
‘‘I’d like somebody to mention on that day 
Martin Luther King, Jr. tried to give his life 
serving others,’’ he said. ‘‘I want you to say on 
that day, that I did try in my life . . . to love 
and serve humanity.’’ 
We should also remember that the Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. was, above all, a per-
son who was always willing to speak truth to 
power. 
There is perhaps no better example of Dr. 
King’s moral integrity and consistency than his 
criticism of the Vietnam War being waged by 
the Johnson Administration, an administration 
that was otherwise a friend and champion of 
civil and human rights. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, 
Georgia on January 15, 1929. 
Martin’s youth was spent in our country’s 
Deep South, then run by Jim Crow and the Ku 
Klux Klan. 
For young African-Americans, it was an en-
vironment even more dangerous than the one 
they face today. 
A young Martin managed to find a dream, 
one that he pieced together from his read-
ings—in the Bible, and literature, and just 
about any other book he could get his hands 
on. 
And not only did those books help him edu-
cate himself, but they also allowed him to 
work through the destructive and traumatic ex-
periences of blatant discrimination, and the 
discriminatory abuse inflicted on himself, his 
family, and his people. 
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. that we 
celebrate here today could have turned out to 
be just another African-American who would 
have had to learn to be happy with what he 
had, and what he was allowed. 
But he learned to use his imagination and 
his dreams to see right through those ‘‘White 
Only’’ signs—to see the reality that all men, 
and women, regardless of their place of origin, 
their gender, or their creed, are created equal. 
Through his studies, Dr. King learned that 
training his mind and broadening his intellect 
effectively shielded him from the demoralizing 
effects of segregation and discrimination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E49 
January 16, 2020 
Dr. King was a dreamer and his dreams 
were a tool through which he was able to lift 
his mind beyond the reality of his segregated 
society, and into a realm where it was pos-
sible that white and black, red and brown, and 
all others live and work alongside each other 
and prosper. 
But the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was 
not an idle daydreamer. 
He shared his visions through speeches that 
motivated others to join in his nonviolent effort 
to lift themselves from poverty and isolation by 
creating a new America where equal justice 
and institutions were facts of life. 
In the Declaration of Independence in 1776, 
Thomas Jefferson wrote, ‘‘We hold these 
truths to be self evident, that all Men are Cre-
ated Equal.’’ 
At that time and for centuries to come, Afri-
can-Americans were historically, culturally, and 
legally excluded from inclusion in that declara-
tion. 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King’s ‘‘I Have 
a Dream’’ Speech, delivered 56 years ago this 
year, on August 28, 1963, was a clarion call 
to each citizen of this great nation that we still 
hear today. 
His request was simply and eloquently con-
veyed—he asked America to allow of its citi-
zens to live out the words written in its Dec-
laration of Independence and to have a place 
in this nation’s Bill of Rights. 
The 1960s were a time of great crisis and 
conflict. 
The dreams of the people of this country 
were filled with troubling images that arose 
like lava from the nightmares of violence and 
the crises they had to face, both domestically 
and internationally. 
It was the decade of the Cuban Missile Cri-
sis, the Vietnam War, and the assassinations 
of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Mal-
colm X, Presidential Candidate Robert Ken-
nedy, and the man we honor here today. 
Dr. Martin Luther King’s dream helped us 
turn the corner on civil rights. 
It started when Dr. King led the Montgomery 
Bus Boycott, with Rosa Parks and others, 
which lasted for 381 days, and ended when 
the United States Supreme Court outlawed ra-
cial segregation on all public transportation. 
But the dream did not die there. 
It continued started with a peaceful march 
for suffrage that started in Selma, Alabama on 
March 7, 1965—a march that ended with vio-
lence at the hands of law enforcement officers 
as the marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge. 
Dr. King used several nonviolent tactics to 
protest against Jim Crow Laws in the South 
and he organized and led demonstrations for 
desegregation, labor and voting rights. 
On April 4, 1967, at Riverside Church in 
New York City, he spoke out against the Viet-
nam War, when he saw the devastation that 
his nation was causing abroad and the effect 
that it had on the American men and women 
sent overseas. 
When the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King was stolen from us, he was a very young 
39 years old. 
People remember that Dr. King died in 
Memphis, but few can remember why he was 
there. 
On that fateful day in 1968 Dr. King came 
to Memphis to support a strike by the city’s 
sanitation workers. 
The garbage men there had recently formed 
a chapter of the American Federation of State, 
County and Municipal Employees to demand 
better wages and working conditions. 
But the city refused to recognize their union, 
and when the 1,300 employees walked off 
their jobs the police broke up the rally with 
mace and Billy clubs. 
It was then that union leaders invited Dr. 
King to Memphis. 
Despite the danger he might face entering 
such a volatile situation, it was an invitation he 
could not refuse. 
Not because he longed for danger, but be-
cause the labor movement was intertwined 
with the civil rights movement for which he 
had given up so many years of his life. 
The death of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr., will never overshadow his life. 
That is his legacy as a dreamer and a man 
of action. 
It is a legacy of hope, tempered with peace. 
It is a legacy not quite yet fulfilled. 
I hope that Dr. King’s vision of equality 
under the law is never lost to us, who in the 
present, toil in times of unevenness in our 
equality. 
For 
without 
that 
vision—without 
that 
dream—we can never continue to improve on 
the human condition. 
For those who have already forgotten, or 
whose vision is already clouded with the fog of 
complacency, I would like to recite the immor-
tal words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr.: 
‘‘I have a dream that one day on the red 
hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and 
the sons of former shareholders will be able 
to sit down together at the table of brother-
hood. 
I have a dream that one day even the State 
of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the 
heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of 
oppression, will be transformed into an oasis 
of freedom and justice. 
I have a dream that my four little children 
will one day live in a nation where they will 
not be judged by the color of their skin, but 
for the content of their character. 
I have a dream today. 
I have a dream that one day down in Ala-
bama with its vicious racists, with its Gov-
ernor having his lips dripping with words of 
interposition 
and 
nullification—one 
day 
right there in Alabama, little black boys and 
black girls will be able to join hands with lit-
tle white boys and white girls as sisters and 
brothers. 
I have a dream today. 
I have a dream that one day every valley 
shall be exalted, every hill and mountain 
shall be made low, the rough place will be 
made plain and the crooked places will be 
made straight, and the glory of the Lord 
shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it to-
gether.’’ 
Dr. King’s dream did not stop at racial 
equality, his ultimate dream was one of human 
equality and dignity. 
There is no doubt that Dr. King wished and 
worked for freedom and justice for every indi-
vidual in America. 
He was in midst of planning the 1968 Poor 
People’s Campaign for Jobs and Justice when 
he was struck down by the dark deed of an 
assassin on April 4, 1968. 
It is for us, the living, to continue that fight 
today and forever, in the great spirit that in-
spired the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Soviet Union. January 20 marks the 30th anni-
versary of this tragic day in the history of 
Azerbaijan, which is seen as its rebirth as an 
independent country. 
26,000 Soviet troops attacked Baku, the 
capital city of Azerbaijan, and its surrounding 
areas on the night of January 20, 1990. This 
vicious invasion is fixed in Azerbaijan’s na-
tional history and is remembered in the hearts 
of its people as ‘‘Black January’’ In the Soviet 
brutality, more than 145 innocent civilians 
died, around 800 people were injured, and 
hundreds were arrested. 
The Soviet crackdown was meant to smoth-
er the independence movement in Azerbaijan 
which was gaining momentum at the time. It 
proved to be a futile attempt to prop up the 
rule of the Communist Party, and really the 
whole Soviet Union. In fact, it had the opposite 
effect, further inflaming the independence 
movement and strengthening other such 
movements throughout the former Soviet 
Union. 
Following the events of Black January, pop-
ular sentiment drove Azerbaijan to break away 
from the Soviet Union and declare independ-
ence. On August 30, 1991, Azerbaijan’s Par-
liament adopted the Declaration on the Res-
toration of the State Independence of the Re-
public of Azerbaijan, and on October 18, 1991, 
the Constitutional Act on the State Independ-
ence of the Republic of Azerbaijan was ap-
proved. 
Azerbaijan began to receive international 
recognition of its newfound independence in 
November 1991, and shortly thereafter the 
United States became one of the first nations 
to recognize the country, establishing diplo-
matic relations on February 28, 1992. Today, 
cooperation between the U.S. and Azerbaijan 
has blossomed to include a broad range of 
issues, particularly energy development and 
security, and we share many common inter-
ests and goals for the region. 
I urge my colleagues to join me and the Az-
erbaijani people as they remember the events 
of Black January and celebrate that brutality 
cannot stifle the thirst for freedom.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MR. TAECHIN ‘‘TC’’ KIM 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I stand 
today to honor the life and legacy of Mr. 
Taechin ‘‘TC’’ Kim, who passed away on De-
cember 29, 2019, at the age of 72. Mr. Kim 
was a key leader of the prayer community and 
prayer movement in the Pikes Peak region. As 
a former Korean businessman, TC dedicated 
his life as a prayer missionary to seeking au-
thentic transformation of our city and nation. 
TC was a naturalized American citizen who 
cherished the Biblical, founding principles of 
our nation and lived an exemplary life as a 
true patriot. As the National Facilitator of 
Transform USA, he had a profound impact on 
Colorado Springs and beyond by organizing 
two weekly public prayer gatherings and con-
stantly promoting outstanding Christian citizen-
ship. Colorado’s 5th Congressional District is 
truly blessed by TC’s believing and living 2 
Chronicles 7:14, ‘‘if My people who are called 
by My name will humble themselves, and pray 
and seek My face, and turn from their wicked 
ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will 
forgive their sin and heal their land.’’ 
TC Kim was born in 1947 in the city of 
Taegu, South Korea. He graduated from 
Yonsei University, Seoul with a BA in Busi-
ness and received his MBA from the Univer-
sity of La Verne in Southern California. His 
professional career includes nearly 30 years 
as: General Manager, Samsung Trading Com-
pany; Vice President, NCH Corporation; and 
Asian Pacific Operations Sales Director, Otis 
Elevator Company/United Technologies. In 
2000, he transitioned into service with a global 
non-profit organization Eron/Loving Concern 
as a missionary, providing medical supplies to 
South America and Africa before moving to 
Colorado Springs in 2007. 
In 2007, TC was commissioned by several 
national and global ministry leaders at the 
Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. to serve 
as the National Facilitator of Transform USA. 
Soon after, TC and his wife, Soonae, moved 
to Colorado Springs where he began to con-
nect with local pastors, ministry leaders, ev-
eryday people of faith, as well as many across 
the nation for the purpose of relationship, sup-
port and collaboration towards transforming 
America together. In the summer of 2007, TC 
launched a weekly Wednesday morning pray-
er meeting which continues to this day. He 
also began a monthly national conference call 
to provide a networking platform for servant 
leaders to share about their regional/national 
ministry of serving others which also continues 
into 2020. 
At both the weekly local prayer meeting as 
well as the monthly national conference calls, 
TC always encouraged and inspired people of 
faith to be the positive change makers in the 
spheres of business, education, public service, 
media, arts/entertainment and religion. In 
2014, TC was granted space in Colorado 
Springs’ City Hall to launch a weekly Friday 
evening meeting to pray for our city. Through-
out TC’s years in Colorado Springs, he always 
looked for opportunities to serve the needs of 
our community. He also convened several 
special Transform USA gatherings in our re-
gion including the 2011 D-Day Prayer and the 
2018 Transform USA Summit. TC continued to 
‘‘fight the good fight’’ even after he was diag-
nosed with stage four cancer in 2015, and 
‘‘finished the race’’ at the end of 2019. 
TC Kim lived a transformed life through lov-
ing and honoring all those around him both as 
a global businessman and missionary and 
both a local and national ministry leader. He 
represented Christian virtues well and many in 
our region, nation, and around the world have 
been blessed by his service. The Pikes Peak 
Region and beyond will continue to thrive 
through the lives he impacted. TC is survived 
by his wife Soonae, sons Andrew and Sean, 
their wives, and five grandchildren. Madam 
Speaker, it is my distinct honor to remember 
the life and legacy of Mr. Taechin ‘‘TC’’ Kim.

nity and family. He shared in the vision of eco-
nomic advances and took strides to help main-

HONORING F. ANTHONY KEATING 
FOR HIS 24 YEARS OF SERVICE 
AS CIVILIAN AIDE TO THE SEC-
RETARY OF THE ARMY ON THE 
OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Anthony Keating for his 24 
years of service to our community as Civilian 
Aide to the Secretary of the Army for the 
Northern New York region. 
The Civilian Aide to the Secretary of the 
Army is an unpaid volunteer who advises and 
supports the Secretary of the Army on issues 
affecting his or her region. For the past 24 
years, Anthony Keating has been advising 
Army Secretaries on the local issues affecting 
Fort Drum and the surrounding active service 
and veteran communities in the North Country. 
Mr. Keating combines his local knowledge with 
his nine years of active duty service to the 
Army when advising the secretary on policy 
decisions. Although he is retiring from the po-
sition specifically covering Northern New York, 
Mr. Keating is not finished serving the region, 
as he will remain on as Civilian Aide Emeritus 
for all of New York State. 
His deep knowledge of the community, 
which includes Fort Drum, and his decades of 
experience have made him an invaluable 
asset to Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCar-
thy and his predecessors. On behalf of New 
York’s 21st District, I would like to thank Mr. 
Keating for his service and wish him well in 
this new chapter in his life.

ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE 
HON. RON ESTES 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, today I ad-
dress the first and most fundamental right 
guaranteed to every individual—the right to 
life. 
Next week marks the 47th anniversary since 
the tragic ruling in Roe v. Wade. In that time, 
more than 60 million lives have been lost to 
abortion. 
That’s 60 million babies who were never 
given the chance to fulfill their potential as a 
future doctor, farmer, artist, or maybe Member 
of Congress. 
Last year, I helped support efforts by the 
Trump administration to update Title X guide-
lines so that tax dollars for family planning 
services don’t go to abortion providers. 
This year we have built on our pro-life ef-
forts by introducing the Down Syndrome Dis-
crimination by Abortion Prohibition Act to pro-
tect the most vulnerable of the unborn. 
We have accomplished great victories for 
life over the past three years, however we 
know there is more to be done. 
That’s why I want to thank the hundreds of 
thousands of Americans from Kansas and 
throughout our country who will be convening 
in Washington next week to stand for life. 
We know that research has proven what 
pro-life Kansans have already known—that is 
life is precious and it begins at conception. 
As a dad of three and a Kansan, I stand in 
support of fellow Kansans and Americans who 
are a voice for the voiceless.

RECOGNIZING THE GRAND OPEN-
ING OF CITY OF HOPE IN NEW-
PORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA 
HON. HARLEY ROUDA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I, along with 
Representatives GILBERT R. CISNEROS, JR., J. 
LUIS CORREA, MIKE LEVIN, ALAN LOWENTHAL, 
KATIE PORTER, and LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ, rise to 
recognize the grand opening of City of Hope 
in Newport Beach, California. This is City of 
Hope’s first Orange County location and it will 
make a tremendous impact in enhancing the 
lives of residents by providing highly special-
ized care and pioneering cancer research 
closer to home. City of Hope is a National 
Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive 
Cancer Center. Each year, more than 100 mil-
lion people worldwide benefit from scientific 
and clinical discoveries made at City of Hope. 
For the first time, Orange County residents will 
have local access to City of Hope’s network of 
world-renowned 
cancer 
specialists 
and 
groundbreaking treatments. 
With the opening of City of Hope’s Newport 
Beach location, the organization, which has 
been named by U.S. News & World Report as 
the top-ranked cancer hospital in California, 
fulfills its promise of providing lifesaving treat-
ments to Orange County and launches a new 
era in cancer care. City of Hope is also devel-
oping a comprehensive cancer campus in 
Irvine, California. 
City of Hope was founded more than a cen-
tury ago to address a pressing medical need. 
Its arrival in Orange County also answers the 
call of a community where nearly 20 percent 
of cancer patients have needed to leave the 
area for advanced cancer care. City of Hope 
is bringing the latest in personalized therapies, 
highly specialized physicians, and nationally 
recognized compassionate care to our local 
community, which will positively impact patient 
healing. 
We ask that all Members join us in recog-
nizing the extraordinary work and contributions 
of City of Hope and their efforts to eradicate 
cancer and bring tomorrow’s discoveries to the 
people who need them today, in Orange 
County and around the world.

CONGRATULATING 
STEVEN 
H. 
PERDUE 
FOR 
RECEIVING 
THE 
2019 
DISTINGUISHED 
SERVICE 
AWARD 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Steven H. Perdue for re-
ceiving the 2019 Distinguished Service Award 
from Traverse Connect. Through his excep-
tional leadership and steadfast devotion to his 
community, Steve has become an indispen-
sable part of Northern Michigan. 
Since 1929, the Distinguished Service 
Award has been given to leaders who have 
had a tremendously positive impact on the 
Traverse City area. Through his decades of 
service to his community, Steve has shown 
himself to be more than deserving of this 
honor. Founded in 1974, Grand Traverse In-
dustries (GTI) provides comprehensive serv-
ices for those with intellectual and develop-
mental disabilities. As President and CEO of 
GTI, Steven has led these efforts since 1980. 
His exceptional work has helped thousands of 
persons with disabilities in the Grand Traverse 
Area find meaningful employment. 
Steve’s selflessness has been previously 
recognized on multiple occasions, for instance 
receiving the 2007 Sara Hardy Humanitarian 
of the Year Award from the City of Traverse 
City. Outside of his work at GTI, Steve has 
served in a variety of leadership roles in the 
Idaho Special Olympics, the Idaho and Michi-
gan State Trade Associations, the TC Area 
Chamber of Commerce, the Small Business 
Council, and the Traverse Bay Economic De-
velopment Corporation. He also serves on the 
Board of SourceAmerica, a national nonprofit 
that creates job opportunities for those with 
disabilities. The impact of Steve’s work on the 
people of Michigan cannot be overstated. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late Steven H. Perdue for receiving the 2019 
Distinguished Service Award. Michiganders 
can take great pride in knowing the First Dis-
trict is home to such a selfless leader. On be-
half of my constituents, I wish Steve all the 
best in his future endeavors.

Since he joined, Mr. LaValley has proven to 
be an instrumental member of the Bangor Vol-
unteer Fire Department. He has served in nu-
merous roles for the department, including 
membership on the board of directors, safety 
officer, and multiple assistant chief positions. 
Lawrence is the current vice-president of the 
department; his son, Larry, is the current

been 
among the top five responders in the depart-
ment for several years running. He has also 
demonstrated a commitment to his community 
outside the department serving as Town Jus-
tice and on the Bangor Republican Com-
mittee. 
Lawrence LaValley devoted 50 years of his 
life to fire protection, and is an exemplary 
member of his community. On behalf of New 
York’s 21st District, I would like to thank Fire-
fighter LaValley for a lifetime of service and 
dedication to keeping Bangor and the sur-
rounding communities safe.

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE UNITED HOUSE OF 
PRAYER FOR ALL PEOPLE 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the United House of Pray-
er for All People as the church celebrates its 
100th year anniversary. The United House of 
Prayer for All People was founded by Bishop 
Charles Manuel Grace in 1919 in West 
Wareham, 
MA. 
The 
church 
is 
now 
headquartered in the District of Columbia and 
has 137 places of worship in 27 states. 
Bishop Charles Manuel Grace’s vision for 
the United House of Prayer for All People was 
for it to be a place of worship that also ad-
dressed the critical needs of communities 
devasted by social and economic injustice. 
The impact of the church can be seen through 
community development, enterprise, and im-
proved housing throughout the United States. 
United House of Prayer has developed thou-
sands of multi-family and single-family homes 
while maintaining affordability in neighbor-
hoods across the country. 
The church has also made a major impact 
on 
education. 
The 
late 
Bishop 
Walter 
McCollough, the church’s second leader, 
founded the McCollough Scholarship College 
Fund to afford young people the opportunity to 
pursue their dreams of higher education. The 
late Bishop S.C. Madison established the St. 
Lady D. Scholastic Achievement program to 
reward grade school students for maintaining 
good citizenship and honor roll achievement. 
The United House of Prayer continues to be 
an extraordinary force in serving the needs of 
the less fortunate and impoverished citizens 
across this country. I am fortunate to rep-
resent several House of Prayer congregations 
in Virginia’s third congressional district. The 
House of Prayer provides youth community 
programs, senior citizen projects, food banks, 
child care, and other community projects. The 
church remains focused on being a place 
where all nations and people, irrespective of 
denomination or creed, can pray and worship 
in spirit and in truth. 
The 100-year celebration of the United 
House of Prayer for All People is not just a 
celebration of bricks and mortar, it is a cele-
bration of faith, unity, and dynamic leadership. 
Madam Speaker, the United House of Pray-
er for All People, under the current leadership 
of Bishop C.M. Bailey, has never sought pub-
lic recognition for their hard work and dedica-
tion to the community. Bishop Bailey and the 
church have dedicated their lives to the ad-
vancement, growth, and success of commu-
nities throughout the country. I congratulate 
them on their 100th anniversary and I am ex-
cited to see the positive contributions they will 
continue to make in the years ahead.

AZERBAIJAN—BLACK JANUARY 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, this 
month, our friend and ally, the Republic of 
Azerbaijan marks the 30th anniversary of 
‘‘Black January.’’ This time period symbolizes 
the beginning of the end of Soviet rule over 
Azerbaijan, an occupation that existed for 
much of the 20th Century. Violent conflict 
erupted in Azerbaijan’s capital city of Baku on 
January 19–20, 1990 when Soviet troops 
killed over 100 Azeri demonstrators and 
wounded another 700. 
In stark contrast to the violence of the So-
viet military, the people of Azerbaijan contin-
ued their peaceful protests until declaring 
independence from the U.S.S.R. on October 
18, 1991. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in com-
memorating the events of Black January in 
Azerbaijan and honoring those who lost their 
lives in pursuit of freedom. The United States 
continues to stand with our ally and partner.

RECOGNIZING CHIEF RODOLFO 
KARISCH 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the public service of Chief Rodolfo 
Karisch as he celebrates his retirement after 
30 years with the U.S. Border Patrol. 
Chief Karisch retires after having served 
with distinction as the Chief Patrol Agent of 
the Rio Grande Valley Sector and Commander 
of the South Texas Corridor. Prior to his selec-
tion as Chief Patrol Agent of the Rio Grande 
Valley Sector, Rodolfo Karisch served as 
Chief of the Tucson and Del Rio Sectors. He 
also served as Acting Assistant Commissioner 
of the Office of Professional Responsibility. 
Throughout 
his 
extensive 
career, 
Chief 
Karisch has consistently embodied the Border 
Patrol’s motto of ‘‘Honor First’’. 
Chief Karisch was a friend of mine and a 
steady, guiding light to his institution through-
out his service. His career was dedicated to 
the best interests of the community and the 
country, and he worked tirelessly to protect 
our border, the town of El Paso, and his com-
munity. 
I thank Chief Karisch for three decades of 
dedicated service and wish him many happy 
memories with his family and loved ones dur-
ing his retirement. It is often said that a retire-
ment is an ending, but retirement is also a 
well-deserved beginning to new adventures 
and opportunities. I wish him and his family all 
the best in the future. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to recognize 
the legacy of Chief Rodolfo Karisch.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE GRAND 
RE-OPENING OF THE MICHIGAN 
UNION 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the grand re-opening of the 
Michigan Union. 
The Michigan Union is a cornerstone of the 
University of Michigan. Opened in 1919, the 
Michigan Union is one of the oldest college 
unions in the country. For nearly a century, 
the Michigan Union has given students, fac-
ulty, and members of the Ann Arbor commu-
nity a space to gather, study, and socialize. 
Throughout the years, the Michigan Union has 
undergone a great deal of transformation and 
witnessed some of our nation’s greatest histor-
ical moments. On the morning of October 14, 
1960, Democratic presidential nominee John 
F. Kennedy gave an impromptu speech that 
laid the groundwork for the Peace Corps. 
Later, during a visit to the University of Michi-
gan, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. joined students 
in the Michigan Union to discuss his thoughts 
on discrimination and the future of integration 
in America. To carry on this impactful legacy 
and adapt to meet the needs of 21st century 
students, the Michigan Union closed in May 
2018 to undergo an $85.2 million renovation. 
Today, we celebrate the Michigan Union as 
it opens its doors once again. While maintain-
ing the architectural integrity of the 1919 origi-
nal structure, Michigan Union has vastly re-
modeled internal features. Aside from tech-
nology upgrades and infrastructure renewals, 
the Michigan Union now includes expanded 
lounge and study rooms, a revolutionary idea 
hub, an enclosed courtyard, collaborative 
spaces, and a host of different food vendors. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the grand re-opening 
of the Michigan Union. Through the historical 
renovation, the Michigan Union will continue to 
be an iconic symbol of the University of Michi-
gan for generations to come.

Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Watertown Mayor Joseph But-
ler, Jr. for his appointment as Civilian Aide to

Joseph Butler, Jr. is a lifelong resident of 
Watertown, New York, a pillar of the commu-

Council for eight years and as Mayor for four 
years. Mr. Butler is currently the president of 
the Watertown Local Development Corpora-
tion, a lector for St. Patrick’s Church, a volun-

nomic Development Council. He has also held 
positions with the Sacred Heart Foundation, 
Jefferson Community College, and the Amer-
ican Red Cross. 
His deep knowledge of the community, 
which includes Fort Drum, and his decades of 
experience will make him an invaluable asset 
to Secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy. On 
behalf of New York’s 21st District, I would like 
to thank Mr. Butler for his service and con-
gratulate him on this appointment. I look for-
ward to his success in this new role.

100TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
STATE OF INDIANA’S RATIFICA-
TION OF THE 19TH AMENDMENT 
TO THE U.S. CONSTITUTION 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the 100th Anniversary of 
the State of Indiana’s ratification of the 19th 
Amendment to the United States Constitution. 
It was on this date a century ago that the Indi-
ana General Assembly answered the call of 
history, helping to finally open the doors of de-
mocracy, equality, and opportunity to Hoosier 
women. 
Not long after the landmark Seneca Falls 
Convention and subsequent Declaration of 
Sentiments in 1848, female leaders in Indiana 
began to organize their own women’s rights 
initiatives. Led by Randolph County native 
Amanda Way, Indiana’s first convention for 
women’s rights took place in 1851. Building on 
the energy generated from this first conven-
tion, participants went on to form the Indiana 
Woman’s Rights Association in 1852. As the 
movement began to take hold the organization 
transformed into the Indiana Woman’s Suf-
frage Association. In 1859, Richmond physi-
cian Dr. Mary F. Thomas spoke in favor of 
women’s suffrage in front of the Indiana Gen-
eral Assembly in Indianapolis. As the leader of 
the Indiana Woman’s Suffrage Association, 
she was the first female to address the Indi-
ana General Assembly. 
Soon thereafter the scourge of the Civil War 
dominated political and social life throughout 
the country. However, the dream of women’s 
suffrage did not wither in the shadow of this 
national calamity. After the surrender of Con-
federate forces in 1865, the states went on to 
ratify the 14th Amendment guaranteeing citi-
zens equal protection under the law, in 1868. 
The states then ratified the 15th Amendment 
in 1870, guaranteeing the right to vote to all 
males regardless of race. These new guaran-
tees reinvigorated the push for women’s suf-
frage. 
Pressure for passage of statewide women’s 
suffrage was first and foremost on the mind of 
May Wright Sewall’s Equal Suffrage Society, 
which during the early 1880’s, organized mas-
sive letter writing campaigns aimed at influ-
encing the members of the Indiana General 
Assembly. Activists such as Helen Gougar of 
Lafayette, went even a step further, actively 
attempting to vote in an election in 1894. Hav-
ing been barred from her attempt to vote, she 
filed a court case against the Tippecanoe 
County Election Board. After initial successes 
in lower courts, the case went to the Indiana 
Supreme Court which ultimately ruled against 
Mrs. Gougar. Later in 1897, American icon 
and women’s suffrage leader Susan B. An-
thony spoke before the Indiana General As-
sembly, advocating the swift passage of state-
wide women’s suffrage. 
With the struggle continuing on into the 20th 
Century, those fighting for women’s suffrage 
developed new connections and organizations, 
strengthening their forces in this march to-
wards equality. Groups such as the Indiana 
Federation of Clubs, the Women’s Franchise 
League, the Legislative Council of Indiana, 
and the Equal Suffrage Association employed 
new, more high-profile tactics such as auto 
tours, parades, car rallies, and other major 
grassroots campaigns, in an effort to increase 
support for their cause. Leaders including Indi-
anapolis natives Grace Julian Clarke, Dr. 
Amelia Keller, and Carrie Barnes Ross, along 
with Ida Husted Harper of Terre Haute, Marie 
Stuart Edwards of Peru, and many others, re-
cruited Hoosier women from all ethnic, socio-
economic, and religious backgrounds to their 
ranks, increasing the spectrum of voices call-
ing for equality and opportunity. As a result of 
their continued efforts the suffragettes were 
successful in persuading the Indiana General 
Assembly to pass the Maston-McKinley Partial 
Suffrage Act in 1917. This act granted women 
the right to vote in certain state and local elec-
tions. However, a legal ruling from the Indiana 
State Supreme Court struck down the law 
shortly before the 1917 municipal elections. 
Undeterred, these brave, intrepid heroes 
continued their struggle. Then in 1919, the 
dam of inequality finally began to break as the 
United States House or Representatives and 
the United States Senate passed the 19th 
Amendment on June 4, 1919. The anticipated 
vote total in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives was predicted to be so narrow that sup-
porters of women’s suffrage helped carry Hoo-
sier Representative Henry Barnhart of Roch-
ester, Indiana, from his hospital bed to the 
House floor so he could cast his vote in favor 
of the bill. After passing both houses of the 
U.S. Congress, the proposed amendment was 
sent to the states, needing three-quarters of 
the states to vote in favor of ratification before 
the amendment could be adopted. Back in In-
diana, after resisting demands to call a special 
session to ratify the 19th Amendment, the In-
diana General Assembly did finally convene, 
and on January 16, 1920, Indiana became the 
26th state to ratify the 19th Amendment. 
After decades of struggle, the power of the 
vote was extended to women with the adop-
tion of the 19th Amendment on August 26, 
1920. Forever more the law would guarantee 
that the right of citizens of the United States 
to vote would no longer be denied to women. 
Today, a century after this landmark moment, 
women across our country continue to lead 
the United States into the future with the same 
zeal and steely determination that sparked a 
political revolution and allowed our country to 
move another step closer to living out the 
ideals of its founders.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SELWYN 
SCHOOL 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 16, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the opening of the Selwyn 
School’s Argyle, Texas Campus and the rib-
bon-cutting of its newly constructed Early 
Childhood Center. As a proud alumnus of 
Selwyn, I celebrate the school’s achievements 
and join the staff, faculty, students and par-
ents in looking forward optimistically as 
Selwyn renews its mission of equipping future 
leaders as productive citizens from a new 
physical setting. 
Founded in 1957, the Selwyn School is an 
independent, 
non-sectarian, 
college-pre-
paratory school serving pre-school through 
grade twelve students. A member of the Na-
tional Association of Independent Schools, 
Selwyn provides the most thoroughly individ-
ualized, comprehensive and developmentally 
appropriate array of student-focused experi-
ences in North Texas. Selwyn graduates are 
independent thinkers and creative problem 
solvers trained to embrace complex chal-
lenges with empathy and innovative thought to 
advance the human condition. 
Resilient, emotionally intelligent and globally 
aware, Selwyn graduates are challenged to 
elevate the human experience by encouraging 
holistic development through age appropriate 
challenges to foster problem-solving, emo-
tional intelligence and social responsibility. 
Conducting these academic exercises with the 
expectation of high academic standards, grad-
uates form the necessary academic and char-
acter-building tools necessary in adulthood to 
identify and successfully seek solutions to re-
sponsibly address both the known and not yet 
identified challenges the world will present 
them in adulthood. 
As an exciting backdrop for these lessons, 
Selwyn relocated in March 2017 to one of 
North Texas’ most picturesque settings. The 
idyllic 10-acre campus provides an environ-
ment supporting nature-based play and explo-
ration, promoting environmental awareness 
and unique outdoor education opportunities.

gardens to creating their own businesses, 
Selwyn creates practical and challenging op-
portunities for students of all ages to engage 
in creating solutions for the problems of their 
communities. 
I know their commitment to the mission well, 
as Selwyn was an integral part of the develop-
ment of the focus, curiosity and determination 
I’ve relied upon through my pursuit of post- 
graduate studies, success as a physician and 
business owner, and as a Member of Con-
gress. Even though 5O years have passed 
since my graduation, I rely daily in my current 
legislative role on the foundations Selwyn in-
structors developed within my young mind. In 
doing so, I join other graduates, including en-
trepreneurs and philanthropists, who daily ful-
fill their life’s work in service to their fellow 
man. 
I am honored to represent the Selwyn 
School both as a graduate and as a constitu-
ency I am fortunate to serve as a part of the 
26th Congressional District. I look forward to 
witnessing 
the 
continued 
application 
of 
Selwyn’s mission to the success of their stu-
dents and the growth and development of this 
new campus I join them in celebrating today.
