Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MAY 5, 2020 
No. 84 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Compassionate God, thank You for 
giving us another day. 
In an earlier national crisis, Presi-
dent Gerald Ford bound the Nation 
with these words: ‘‘My fellow Ameri-
cans, our long national nightmare is 
over. Our Constitution works. Our 
great Republic is a government of laws 
and not of men. Here, the people rule. 
. . . Let brotherly love purge our 
hearts of suspicion and of hate.’’ 
Much earlier, President John Adams 
felt that Americans were engaged in 
the best cause that ever employed the 
human heart, but feared success was 
doubtful not for want of power or of 
wisdom, but of virtue. We are now en-
gaged in a similar challenge in a new 
world emerging. 
Inspire the men and women of Con-
gress to bend their energies not to 
strengthen positions of privilege, but, 
to the extent possible, reduce privilege 
in favor of the common weal. For we 
are a Nation of laws, not men, and the 
responsibility of government is the 
benefit of all its citizens. 
May each American rise to our 
shared effort to remind ourselves that 
we are all responsible for the greatness 
of our Nation and to make the sac-
rifices necessary to emerge better in 
virtue and stronger in national well- 
being. With Your grace, O Lord, may it 
be so. 
And may everything done this day be 
for Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen. 
f 
THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
7(a) of House Resolution 891, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD) come forward and lead 
the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD led the Pledge of 
Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER laid before the House 
the following communication from the 
Clerk of the House of Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, May 1, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I have the honor to 
transmit herewith a scanned copy of a letter 
received from Ms. Linda H. Lamone, Admin-
istrator, Maryland State Board of Elections, 
indicating that, according to the preliminary 
results of the Special Election held April 28, 
2020, the Honorable Kweisi Mfume was elect-
ed Representative to Congress for the Sev-
enth Congressional District, State of Mary-
land. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON. 
MARYLAND STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, 
Annapolis, MD, April 30, 2020. 
Hon. CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MS. JOHNSON: This is to advise you 
that the unofficial results of the Special 
Election held on Tuesday, April 28, 2020, for 
Representative in Congress from the 7th 
Congressional District of Maryland, show 
that Mr. Kweisi Mfume received 83,868 votes 
as of April 29, 2020 or 72.8% of votes of the 
number of votes cast for that office. 
It would appear from these unofficial re-
sults that Mr. Mfume was elected as Rep-
resentative in Congress from the 7th Con-
gressional District of Maryland. To the best 
of our knowledge and belief at this time, 
there is no contest to this election. 
As soon as the official results are certified 
to this office by the Board of Canvassers, an 
official Certificate of Election will be pre-
pared for transmittal as required by law. 
Sincerely, 
LINDA H. LAMONE, 
State Administrator. 
f 
SWEARING IN OF THE HONORABLE 
KWEISI MFUME, OF MARYLAND, 
AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the gentleman 
from Maryland, the Honorable Kweisi 
Mfume, be permitted to take the oath 
of office today. 
His certificate of election has not ar-
rived, but there is no contest and no 
question has been raised with regard to 
his election. 
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER. Will Representative- 
elect Mfume and the members of the 
Maryland delegation present them-
selves in the well. 
All Members will rise and the Rep-
resentative-elect will raise his right 
hand. 
Mr. MFUME appeared at the bar of 
the House and took the oath of office, 
as follows: 
Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you 
will support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic; that you will bear true 
faith and allegiance to the same; that you 
take this obligation freely, without any 
mental reservation or purpose of evasion; 
and that you will well and faithfully dis-
charge the duties of the office on which you 
are about to enter, so help you God. 
The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you 
are now a Member of the 116th Con-
gress.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1976 
May 5, 2020 
WELCOMING 
THE 
HONORABLE 
KWEISI MFUME TO THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, all of 
us, of course, were deeply saddened by 
the passing of our friend, Elijah Cum-
mings, last year. He was a giant of 
moral strength and unquestioned in-
tegrity. 
In his 24 years in office, Elijah built 
a reputation for legislative skill, excel-
lence 
in 
constituent 
service, 
an 
unyielding energy for rooting out cor-
ruption in government, and fighting 
tirelessly for justice, equality, and op-
portunity. He served his constituents 
in Maryland’s Seventh Congressional 
District 
well. 
And 
today, 
Madam 
Speaker, they are sending someone to 
take his place whom I believe is an ex-
cellent choice. 
As the dean of the Maryland Congres-
sional delegation, it is my honor today 
to welcome the House’s newest Mem-
ber, Representative Kweisi Mfume. 
However, he is not new to the House. 
He is a veteran of this body, a skilled 
and experienced legislator, who rep-
resented Maryland’s Seventh District 
from 1987 to 1996. When he left to be-
come the national president of the 
NAACP, Elijah Cummings was chosen 
to succeed him. 
Now, as we continue to mourn Eli-
jah’s passing, we welcome Representa-
tive Mfume back to his old seat to 
carry on the work that he and Elijah 
have both been engaged in for many, 
many years. 
The voters of the Seventh District, to 
their credit, replaced great intellect 
with great intellect, a passion for jus-
tice, equality, and opportunity, with a 
successor who mirrors and shares that 
passion and history of commitment. 
Their shared work has been to ensure 
that the promise of America is kept for 
all Americans equally, regardless of 
race or faith or gender or sexual ori-
entation or national origin; to break 
down disparities in justice and access 
to opportunity; to address the tragic 
and unacceptable disparities in access 
to 
quality, 
affordable 
healthcare, 
which the COVID–19 tragedy has made 
so starkly evident; to make certain 
that every child in this country can go 
to a good, safe public school and re-
ceive a quality education that leads to 
a rewarding career. 
That is what Representative Mfume 
fought for as a member of the Balti-
more City Council and as a Member of 
this House. It is what he worked hard 
to achieve as a former chairman of the 
Congressional Black Caucus and as the 
NAACP national president. 
I speak on behalf of our delegation, 
but all who served with him here in the 
Congress of the United States, we are 
pleased that he is back with us. And I 
know that those who were not Mem-
bers when he last served will find him 
to be a wonderful colleague, a man of 
wisdom, thoughtfulness, depth, and 
whose experience can help guide this 
House and our majority as we navigate 
challenges both longstanding and new. 
I hope that all of my colleagues will 
join me in congratulating Representa-
tive Mfume on his election to represent 
Maryland’s Seventh Congressional Dis-
trict once more and in welcoming him 
back to the House. 
I am now honored, Madam Speaker, 
to yield to my friend of longstanding, 
my colleague, and my fellow Mary-
lander, Kweisi Mfume. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the majority leader for his kind 
and overly gracious remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to offer my 
heartfelt thanks and my deepest appre-
ciation to the people of Maryland’s 
Seventh Congressional District for the 
high honor and the distinct privilege of 
again representing them here in the 
Congress of the United States. 
I am happy to have been joined by 
members of our distinguished delega-
tion from the State of Maryland, and I 
appreciate their presence here among 
us. 
I thank Almighty God for the victory 
and for my wonderful family and 
friends. I am joined here in the gallery 
by my wife, Dr. Tiffany Beth Mfume, 
and a longtime family friend, attorney 
Eric Bryant, and others. 
I am honored by those supporters 
who are Black and White, Latino and 
Asian, who could not be here at this 
time but who have worked so very hard 
to make sure that this moment would 
be possible. And I believe, as they do 
and as we continue to do, that racism, 
sexism, and anti-Semitism are wrong, 
that Black bigotry can be just as cruel 
and evil as White bigotry, that gay 
bashing, immigrant bashing, and union 
bashing ultimately deplete us as a Na-
tion and rob us of our ability to make 
true and lasting change. 
Today marks my return to this body 
after 24 years and following the death 
of the Honorable Elijah Cummings, my 
friend of 42 years. I do so against the 
backdrop of COVID–19 and in the midst 
of our Nation’s greatest health crisis of 
the 21st century. 
Simultaneously, we are also locked 
in the Nation’s greatest economic col-
lapse, where there are now families and 
individuals who haven’t had a pay-
check in weeks as they struggle to buy 
food and to pay bills. 
Madam Speaker, our challenges as a 
Nation at this hour, as you and others 
know better than I, are economic, edu-
cational, social, and systemic, and they 
require both the courage of conviction 
and the unwavering resolve that the 
American spirit has always exhibited 
in order to solve them. 
Thus, in yielding back my time, I 
call forth the words of Dr. James 
Cheek, when he so eloquently ex-
claimed: ‘‘I have not given up on the 
American idea or on the American pos-
sibility, and I ask my colleagues in this 
body not to give up also. 
‘‘I am convinced that our Nation still 
stands before the world as perhaps the 
last expression of a possibility of man-
kind devising a social order where jus-
tice is the supreme ruler, and law is 
but its instrument; where freedom is 
the dominant creed, and order . . . but 
its principle; where equity is the com-
mon practice, and fraternity the true 
human condition.’’ 
It is against that backdrop that I 
welcome and embrace both this chal-
lenge and opportunity before me. 
Madam Speaker, I thank you and I 
thank the distinguished majority lead-
er for his words of introduction.

S2225 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MAY 5, 2020 
No. 84 
Senate 
The Senate met at 11 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, Your words are true. 
Guide our lawmakers with Your pre-
cepts. Give them a passion for what-
ever is just, worthy, and honorable. 
Guide them to cultivate such reverence 
for Your providence that they will re-
peatedly pray for Your will to be done. 
Remind them that if they faint under 
pressure, then their strength is too 
small. Help them, therefore, to look to 
You, for You are able to do immeas-
urably, abundantly above all that they 
can ask or imagine, according to Your 
power, working in and through them. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa is 
recognized. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
would like to speak for 1 minute in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
despite the hardships and headaches 
and heartaches that so many families 
are experiencing right now, there are 
countless acts of kindness that show 
humanitarian goodness taking place in 
the entire country, but I notice them 
across my State of Iowa. From rainbow 
art decorating windows to inspira-
tional chalk messages on sidewalks, 
Iowans are donating their time, talent, 
and treasure to support local busi-
nesses, food pantries, and grab-and-go 
meals for students. 
As just one example, the residents of 
a retirement community are sewing 35 
to 40 masks per day for healthcare pro-
fessionals and laundry service workers 
at the University of Iowa Hospitals & 
Clinics. They are also supplying local 
food banks and others who need them 
in their community. The Iowa City 
senior threaders are among the count-
less silver linings that are lighting 
America’s path to recovery. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
it has been a little more than 100 days 
since the first case of COVID–19 was re-
ported in the United States. Since 
then, our Nation has come face-to-face 
with this full-scale pandemic. Families 
have hunkered down and changed their 
routines. Bustling Main Streets have 
literally come to a halt. Essential 
workers have taken new precautions to 
keep the supply chains running. And, 
of course, brave healthcare providers 
have stretched the limits of their sup-
plies and their stamina to care for pa-
tients. All the while, even with the en-
tire country doing its best to fight this 
disease, it has stolen the lives of nearly 
70,000 of our fellow Americans. 
Our Nation is facing the most severe 
pandemic since 1918 and quite possibly 
the worst economic shock since the 
Great Depression. And we are facing 
them at the same time. This is a his-
toric challenge, and the Senate is help-
ing the country meet it. 
In early March, we passed an initial 
response to help communities handle 
the outbreak. We spent billions of dol-
lars to enhance our public health re-
sponse, to promote development of vac-
cines and treatment, and to help the 
healthcare providers and small busi-
nesses in places that were bearing the 
brunt of the virus. 
Just days later, we delivered billions 
more in phase 2. It sought to expand 
access to testing and to help workers. 
Then we built the historic CARES 
Act, the largest rescue package in 
America’s history, and then passed it 
without a single vote in opposition. It 
sent more than $2 trillion in direct 
money to American households, sup-
port for employees’ paychecks, sta-
bility for major employers, and re-
sources for the healthcare fight itself. 
Predictably, these huge, historic ef-
forts have encountered some chal-
lenges along the way. There is no way 
the Federal Government could make 
years’ worth of small business loans in 
a few weeks or rapidly cut checks to 
most American households without 
any hiccups at all. But on the whole, it 
has been encouraging to see Congress, 
the administration, the Federal Re-
serve, and the American people—all of 
us—leap into action together to help 
our country. 
Our work is making a difference. But, 
ultimately, we know there is no policy 
Congress could pass, nor any amount of 
money we could spend, that would keep 
the entire economy glued together if 
these blunt shutdowns continue indefi-
nitely. 
So while our legislation has rightly 
poured money into short-term help for 
the economy, we have also made sure 
to invest in the tools and tactics we 
will need to contain and beat the virus 
so that our country can step back to-
ward 
normalcy: 
testing, 
tracking, 
treatments, and the race for a vaccine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2226 
May 5, 2020 
Our task in the weeks ahead will be 
to keep seeking thoughtful solutions 
that are not just for the very short 
term but will help pivot toward a 
phased reopening and recovery. We will 
need to ask not only how we endure 
each week but also how we foster re-
covery on the other side. 
Early February feels like it was 
about 2 years ago, but the truth is, it 
was just 12 weeks ago. American work-
ers and families were in one of the 
most prosperous economic moments in 
our history. Wages were growing. Un-
employment was near a 50-year low. 
Formerly discouraged Americans were 
being drawn off the sidelines. The 
country was buzzing—literally buzz-
ing—from coast to coast. The Amer-
ican people built that. It is our job to 
help them build it again. 
As we carefully consider what may 
come in the weeks ahead, we will need 
smart and targeted policies to help 
jump-start our economic engine, not 
unrelated ideological wish-list items 
that would gum it up even further. The 
country will need pro-growth, pro-cer-
tainty 
policies—pro-growth, 
pro-cer-
tainty policies. 
The last thing we need is for the po-
litical left to view this national crisis 
as 
an 
exploitable 
opportunity 
to 
achieve other goals they have wanted 
for a very long time. That is how, for 
example, former Vice President Biden 
has repeatedly described the pandemic. 
Here is what he had to say: ‘‘an incred-
ible opportunity . . . to fundamentally 
transform the country’’—‘‘an incred-
ible opportunity . . . to fundamentally 
transform the country.’’ 
This cannot be about ideological 
transformation. It needs to be what 
will actually work for the American 
people. 
Here is just one example of a com-
monsense policy Republicans will in-
sist on. Even as the entire country is 
rallying behind healthcare workers and 
small businesses, trial lawyers are al-
ready looking for ways to line their 
pockets by suing the very people we 
are bending over backward to help. 
As one recent Washington Post col-
umn put it, ‘‘[f]ear of COVID–19 law-
suits is not [some] mere Republican re-
flex’’—a 
Washington 
Post 
column: 
‘‘[f]ear of COVID–19 lawsuits is not 
[some] mere Republican reflex.’’ 
It went on to list all sorts of lawsuits 
that are already pouring in. This kind 
of hostile climate would create yet an-
other major headwind we cannot af-
ford. Republicans will be insisting on 
strong 
legal 
protections 
for 
the 
frontlines. We will not let our historic 
recovery efforts be diverted so that 
taxpayers foot the bill for the biggest 
trial lawyer bonanza in our history. 
Our discussions in the weeks ahead 
do not need to be partisan or conten-
tious. There is nothing partisan about 
the coronavirus, and there is nothing 
partisan about the inspiring example 
being set by citizens across our coun-
try. 
In my home State of Kentucky, we 
are proud of a father-daughter duo in 
Breathitt County. They both came 
down with the virus. They both beat it 
and then turned right around and 
started donating plasma to the race for 
new medicines. 
We are proud of the family resource 
coordinators of Fayette County Public 
Schools who are collecting donated 
household supplies to add to weekly 
food deliveries for thousands of stu-
dents and families. 
These stories only scratch the sur-
face in the Bluegrass, and I know every 
one of my colleagues has stories of 
their own to tell. We are all in this to-
gether. We have stepped up to meet the 
challenge. Let’s continue to stand to-
gether for our country.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of William R. Evanina, of Penn-
sylvania, to be Director of the National 
Counterintelligence and Security Cen-
ter. (New Position) 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Republican leader has called the 
Senate back into session during a time 
when there are significant risks to the 
health of the Members of this Chamber 
and the staff who make this place func-
tion. 
This is a time of national emergency. 
We should be working to provide our 
country with the relief and support it 
so direly needs. But this is only the 
second day of business since Leader 
MCCONNELL
called the Senate back 
into session, and there will be no votes 
on the floor—not one vote. And so far, 
there is no plan—no plan at all—to 
consider COVID-related legislation on 
the floor in the near future. 
If we are going to be here in session, 
with an elevated health risk, why 
doesn’t Leader MCCONNELL
have us 
work on issues that are directly related 
to COVID–19? 
Last night, we confirmed a non-
controversial nominee to the Nuclear 
Regulatory 
Commission. 
The 
next 
nominee on the floor is for a counter-
intelligence post—no doubt important 
but unrelated to COVID—whose nomi-
nation has been delayed by a hold by a 
Republican Senator. So when the Re-
publican leader reasons that we must 
process nominees on the floor this 
week because of a previous Democratic 
obstruction, he should check his notes 
and his facts first. 
We could be using our time here to 
address a number of urgent priorities, 
whether it is rescuing our ailing health 
system, increasing testing capacity, as-
sisting small businesses, renters, and 
homeowners. Providing vigorous over-
sight of legislation we have already 
passed would have been a better use of 
the Senate’s time. 
Instead of coming together to work 
on these pressing matters, we are talk-
ing about nominations and rightwing 
judges, including a former protege of 
the Republican leader who was rated 
unqualified by the American Bar Asso-
ciation, a man who argued against the 
constitutionality of our healthcare law 
in the midst of a public health crisis— 
someone who probably 80 percent or 90 
percent of Americans would reject if 
they knew his views. But he is a pro-
tege of the leader. We are rushing him 
through. We are not paying attention 
to COVID. 
The Senate Intelligence Committee 
is holding a virtual hearing on the 
nomination 
of 
Representative 
RATCLIFFE to serve as the next Direc-
tor of National Intelligence. This is an 
extremely important post that de-
mands a candidate with deep experi-
ence, credibility on both sides of the 
aisle, and, above all, the ability to 
speak truth to power. 
Representative 
RATCLIFFE
meets 
none of these criteria. He is a deeply 
partisan cheerleader for the President, 
a yes-man in every sense of the 
phrase—someone who doesn’t speak 
truth to power to the President of the 
United States. He tells the President 
what he wants to hear. 
Doesn’t this sound familiar? Right 
now, we are living with the con-
sequences of a President who doesn’t 
want to hear the truth about the 
coronavirus, who doesn’t want to be-
lieve it is as bad as it truly is, who 
wants to cling to quack medicines that 
will not work, and who runs away from 
the fact that his administration bears 
responsibility for the inadequacy of our 
national response—a President who 
still doesn’t have a testing plan when 
we desperately need tests to get this 
country open again. 
The President doesn’t like hearing 
the truth. It is that simple. That has 
hurt us dearly when it has come to the 
coronavirus. This crisis is partly the

S2227 
May 5, 2020 
result of an administration that did 
not take COVID–19 seriously enough 
early enough and refused to heed the 
warnings of public health officials and 
scientists. 
The same phenomenon of the Presi-
dent’s not wanting to hear the truth 
will hurt us dearly when it comes to 
national security as well. If the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence can’t stand 
up and tell the President what is really 
happening, even when the President 
doesn’t want to hear it, our country 
will be dramatically less safe—the 
same thing that has happened during 
the coronavirus crisis. If we move 
RATCLIFFE and pass him, we will repeat 
the same mistake that the President 
has made on COVID. Not hearing the 
truth, not acting on the truth, listen-
ing to flattery and not much else, 
which we did on COVID, will be re-
peated on national security. 
Now, I think many of my Republican 
colleagues actually know this. This is 
not the first time that President 
Trump has floated RATCLIFFE’s name— 
it is the second—because, the first 
time, the Republicans balked. Many 
Republicans whispered: He has no expe-
rience. Some Republicans said to one 
another and to some of us: You don’t 
need someone in the DNI who is just a 
cheerleader for the President; you need 
someone who knows intelligence and 
will speak the truth. 
There is no new evidence that Mr. 
RATCLIFFE will act with the necessary 
independence. Nothing has changed 
about RATCLIFFE’s qualifications since 
he was shot down by the Republican 
Senators in their saying he was the 
wrong man for the job. Yet some-
times—all too often in this Senate and 
to the detriment of this country—even 
when my Republican colleagues know 
the President is wrong, they go blindly 
along with him anyway. That happened 
with COVID and will now happen with 
our intelligence agency. I hope it is not 
the case. I hope Mr. RATCLIFFE’s nomi-
nation will be roundly rejected, as it 
should be. 
NOMINATION OF BRIAN MILLER 
Madam President, the second hearing 
this morning is in the Senate Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs on Brian Miller to be the 
Special Inspector General of the pan-
demic relief efforts. Having an inde-
pendent, experienced, and strong IG to 
oversee the administration’s use of tax-
payer funds in this pandemic is criti-
cally 
important. 
Under 
President 
Trump, who has been firing IGs left 
and right simply because they tell the 
truth and who believes that he is ac-
countable to no one, selecting a truly 
independent watchdog is essential and 
urgent. 
As someone who currently works di-
rectly for President Trump as a mem-
ber of his White House Counsel’s Office, 
Mr. Miller’s independence from the 
President is very much in doubt. We 
need a strong, tough IG. Billions of dol-
lars are being spent. We don’t want 
someone who has in his mind: I have to 
please the President. Mr. Miller needs 
to explain why the Senate should con-
firm him to a position that requires 
genuine independence. In particular, he 
must answer specific questions from 
the Committee on Banking, Housing, 
and Urban Affairs about his role in the 
White House Counsel’s Office and what 
issues he has worked on. It is not ac-
ceptable to hide behind vague asser-
tions that he can’t answer those ques-
tions. It is too important. The burden 
on Miller is to demonstrate that he can 
be a truly strong and independent in-
spector general. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, there are serious 
questions about the fitness of both of 
these nominees—Mr. RATCLIFFE
and 
Mr. Miller. Yet, more broadly, the Re-
publican leader has made a mistake by 
choosing to dedicate this session to 
nominations only instead of to urgent 
legislative business—COVID–19. 
We could and should be focused on 
issues like testing. The first diagnosed 
case of COVID–19 was diagnosed here in 
the United States just over 100 days 
ago. We still don’t have a national test-
ing strategy that is adequate. In early 
March, President Trump said that any-
body who needs a test gets a test, 
which has entered the pantheon of 
Presidential lies, alongside: ‘‘I am not 
a crook,’’ and ‘‘Read my lips: no new 
taxes.’’ It was not true then, and it 
isn’t true now. We still don’t have a 
situation in which everyone who needs 
a test and wants a test gets one. 
As nations around the world, like 
South Korea and Canada, flatten the 
curve with rigorous national testing 
programs, 
the 
United 
States—this 
great United States, usually the leader 
of the world—is lagging so far behind. 
So, today, 42 Senate Democrats are 
sending a letter, demanding that the 
Trump administration fulfill its re-
sponsibility to produce a comprehen-
sive, national strategic plan of action 
by May 24. Congress provided $25 bil-
lion in the last round of COVID legisla-
tion to help build up our testing capac-
ity. The administration needs to take 
those resources and produce results. 
We have given him the money and the 
wherewithal. Where are they? The 
strategy they must come up with must 
include a strategy for managing supply 
chains and for making sure resources 
are equitably allocated and a strategy 
to use all available tools, like the De-
fense Production Act, to make sure we 
reach the level of testing that will 
manage this disease, save lives, and get 
our economy moving again. 
Until we have a vaccine, the most 
important tool we have at our disposal 
for tracking the disease, limiting its 
spread, and understanding where we 
can safely open is testing, testing, test-
ing. We await the President’s response 
to our letter and want to work with the 
administration to make sure we can 
end its embarrassment of inadequate 
testing, which, frankly, is far more 
than an embarrassment—it is crucial. 
It is life and death. 
SMALL BUSINESS LENDING TRANSPARENCY 
Madam President, finally, on small 
business lending transparency, over the 
past several months, Congress has pro-
vided historic levels of funding to help 
small 
businesses 
retain 
employees, 
meet payroll, and stay afloat during 
these turbulent times. Because of the 
depth of this crisis, we have dedicated 
trillions—not billions but trillions—to 
this effort. We must absolutely make 
sure these relief programs are imple-
mented properly. With so much tax-
payer money at stake, oversight, trans-
parency, and accountability are musts. 
Issues with the small business lend-
ing programs cropped up almost as 
soon as the administration began im-
plementing them. Truly, small busi-
nesses had a difficult time in securing 
loans while larger businesses that had 
standing relationships with big banks 
had a much easier time. Minority- 
owned businesses, women-owned busi-
nesses, 
and 
other 
unbanked 
busi-
nesses—the proverbial small restaurant 
owner, the butcher, the baker, the can-
dlestick maker—have been left out to a 
large degree. We tried to rectify some 
of 
these 
problems, 
particularly 
in 
COVID 3.5, but more must be done. 
As Justice Brandeis said: ‘‘Sunlight 
is the best disinfectant.’’ Transparency 
around these programs is the order of 
the day. So, this afternoon, Senator 
CARDIN and I will ask the Senate to 
pass legislation that demands new dis-
closure requirements for the Paycheck 
Protection Program and other disaster 
relief accounts. Our bill is very simple. 
It would require the daily and weekly 
reporting of the PPP, the Economic In-
jury Disaster Loan, and debt relief pro-
grams to be broken down, in each case, 
by geography, demographics, and in-
dustry. The data would need to be 
downloaded and would include the 
names of the entities and the loans or 
grant amounts. It would need to detail 
whether the programs are reaching un-
derserved communities. 
This is hardly a controversial idea. 
There is nothing partisan about it. Our 
legislation would simply require the 
basic transparency we expect from any 
Federal program—certainly, one of this 
size and importance. It is my hope that 
my Republican colleagues will not 
block our request simply because it 
comes from this side of the aisle. I 
would hope, on a day when the Repub-
lican leader has scheduled literally no 
business on the floor of the Senate, 
that we could come together to pass 
this very simple bill to make sure we 
know how taxpayer dollars are being 
spent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, to 
date, more than 1 million people have 
contracted coronavirus in the United 
States—61,000 in the State of Illinois. 
Sadly, we are quickly approaching a 
death toll of 100,000 Americans. While 
more people continue to contract and

May 5, 2020 
succumb to the virus, another alarm-
ing trend has come to light. The 
coronavirus disproportionately affects 
minority 
communities. 
Black 
Illi-
noisans make up less than 15 percent of 
the State’s overall population. How-
ever, they account for 34 percent of all 
coronavirus deaths. In Chicago, Black 
residents account for 52 percent of the 
total coronavirus deaths despite their 
comprising only 30 percent of the city’s 
population. 
Recently, a survey of Latinos in Illi-
nois, who make up 17 percent of our 
State’s population, surpassed Black Il-
linoisans 
in 
confirmed 
cases 
of 
coronavirus. Now Latino Illinoisans ac-
count for 23 percent of confirmed cases 
in the State—the most cases of any 
race or ethnicity. Last week, on a call 
with the Illinois community health 
centers, I learned that, of the 34,000 Af-
rican Americans who were tested in Il-
linois, 36 percent were positive for 
coronavirus. Of the 24,000 Latinos test-
ed, 62 percent tested positive—62 per-
cent. Compare that to the 73,000 White 
Illinoisans 
tested 
for 
coronavirus, 
wherein 18 percent tested positive. 
Latino and Black populations in Illi-
nois and across the Nation are bearing 
the brunt of this pandemic. As we con-
tinue to hit new, grim milestones dur-
ing this public health crisis, these dis-
parities are a sobering reminder of the 
historical inequities of our healthcare 
system in our country. Nationwide, 
Black and Latino Americans are more 
likely to have chronic diseases, such as 
diabetes, asthma, and heart disease, 
and are less likely to have health in-
surance than are White Americans. 
These health gaps are the result of his-
toric and structural inequality, includ-
ing their exposure to trauma, racism, 
stigma, and food deserts, and this pan-
demic magnifies the need to imme-
diately address them. 
Black and Latino Americans are also 
more likely to hold frontline jobs that 
have been deemed essential in the food, 
retail, and service industries. That in-
creases their risk of contracting the 
coronavirus when reporting for work. I 
have spoken with many community or-
ganizations, such as the First Ladies 
Health Initiative and West Side United, 
as well as the Illinois community 
health centers, and they have all 
stepped up to help Illinoisans find solu-
tions to these challenges. Yet we can’t 
just talk about the problem. We need 
to put solutions on the table. 
Congress needs to step up. I am work-
ing with the Illinois congressional del-
egation 
to 
improve 
our 
Nation’s 
coronavirus data collection efforts so 
that we can better understand and ad-
dress these racial disparities. It is un-
acceptable that not all States are cur-
rently reporting coronavirus incidents 
and deaths by race. We need these vital 
statistics to help the Federal Govern-
ment, as well as the State and local 
governments, to develop plans to pro-
tect our most vulnerable populations. 
A few moments ago on the floor, the 
Republican leader—the Senator from 
Kentucky, Mr. MCCONNELL—kind of 
warned us about the next stage of the 
debate 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
this 
coronavirus. He warned those of us on 
this side of the aisle not to see this cri-
sis as the basis for fundamentally 
transforming our country. Well, I want 
to say to my colleague from Kentucky 
and all other colleagues, if we don’t 
learn from this crisis the weaknesses of 
this great Nation when it comes to 
healthcare, if we don’t understand the 
inequities of this great Nation when it 
comes to healthcare, and if we don’t re-
solve to do something about it, shame 
on us. If at the end of this crisis we 
breathe a sigh of relief and say that 
now we will go back to business as 
usual, wherein health disparities are 
accepted in this country, shame on this 
Senate. 
Yes, I want to see our way through 
this crisis with the fewest number of 
infections and the fewest number of 
deaths. That is our immediate goal—to 
protect America and to restore the 
economy. Yet, when it is over, if we 
don’t step back and take a look at 
what we have learned from this crisis 
and vow to make America stronger, 
fairer, and more just when it comes to 
healthcare in this country, shame on 
us. 
There are those who voted against 
every aspect of the Affordable Care 
Act—so-called 
ObamaCare—10 
years 
ago. I remember it well. Not a single 
Senator from the other side of the aisle 
would support our effort to reduce the 
number of uninsured people in America 
dramatically. We barely passed it—by 
one vote in the U.S. Senate and with 
Senator Harry Reid as the majority 
leader at the time—and without any 
help, without any votes, from the other 
side of the aisle. And what happened? 
In my State, the number of those who 
were uninsured was cut in half by this 
so-called ObamaCare. Proudly, I call 
the Affordable Care Act ‘‘ObamaCare.’’ 
Since then, those on the other side of 
the aisle have been resolute in their de-
termination to repeal it, not to replace 
it with anything that is better—they 
don’t even have a replacement—and to 
give up on our quest of making sure 
that every American has the peace of 
mind for having the protection of 
health insurance—affordable, quality 
health insurance. 
At the end of this health crisis, are 
we still going to hear the other side of 
the aisle arguing that we shouldn’t 
dedicate ourselves to reducing the 
number of uninsured? I hope they will 
take the time, as I have, to talk to ad-
ministrators at hospitals about what is 
happening in their emergency rooms, 
in their surgical suites, and in other 
places in which they have had to ad-
dress this crisis firsthand. One major 
hospital in Chicago said that half of 
the people in that hospital who have 
died from coronavirus-related disease 
had no health insurance. Is this a coin-
cidence? No. It is a pattern. Without 
health insurance and with gross dis-
parities in the delivery of healthcare, 
we know that there are groups of 
Americans who are suffering and that 
many will die. 
So I would just say to the Republican 
leader, yes, I hope that our experience 
from this coronavirus makes us all 
vow, on both sides of the aisle, to truly 
change America for the better when it 
comes to healthcare and health protec-
tion. That is a must. 
Last week, I had the opportunity to 
speak 
with 
several 
Illinois-focused 
community development financial in-
stitutions. 
These 
organizations 
do 
amazing work by offering lending serv-
ices to small businesses and popu-
lations that are typically overlooked 
by the big banks. They were grateful 
for the work we have done so far and 
for the legislation we have passed, but 
they had suggestions on how to im-
prove the Small Business Administra-
tion’s Paycheck Protection Program to 
ensure that financial relief makes it to 
minority-, women-, and veteran-owned 
small businesses. 
In addition, I am working with my 
colleagues to help ensure that vaccine 
and drug trials that are related to 
COVID–19 include diverse patient popu-
lations and are widely available and af-
fordable. 
I 
have 
cosponsored 
the 
COVID–19 Racial and Ethnic Disparity 
Task Force Act with Senator KAMALA 
HARRIS. This important piece of legis-
lation would create a task force com-
prised of healthcare, economic, and 
government leaders to provide rec-
ommendations about how to best allo-
cate resources to address racial dispari-
ties in our healthcare system. 
When the Senator from Kentucky, 
the majority leader, comes to the floor 
and says to those of us—warns those of 
us—on this side of the aisle not to use 
this healthcare crisis as an excuse or 
an opportunity to transform America, 
is he wedded to the racial inequality 
that we see in our system in his warn-
ing us not to try to address it? I hope 
not. I hope that we can have a bipar-
tisan approach to making this system 
fairer in its reaching more people. 
This week, I am introducing the 
Health Heroes 2020 Act, and here is 
what is behind it: As we all put up 
signs in our windows and yards across 
America to thank healthcare workers 
for risking their lives, we understand 
that these doctors, nurses, and lab 
technicians and these people who work 
in nursing homes who are taking care 
of the elderly folks, as well as those 
who clean up and provide food, are all 
healthcare workers who are risking 
their lives to do their work. I thank 
them. We should all thank them day in 
and day out. 
Yet what are we going to do about 
recognizing the work they have done? 
First, I think we ought to com-
pensate them for jobs well done. Sen-
ator BOB CASEY has legislation on that 
subject, which I am happy to support. 
Beyond that, what can we do for our 
healthcare workforce? Why is it that in 
the United States of America the best 
and brightest, who get great grades in

May 5, 2020 
high school, go through college taking 
the tough courses and getting good 
grades, get accepted to medical school, 
and after working hard for 4 years or 
more there, go through residencies 
which are backbreaking exercises in 
actually learning the clinical practice 
of medicine, and just before we tell 
them they are licensed doctors ready 
to practice in America, we give them 
bad news—the news that they must be 
carrying a student debt from medical 
school of between $200,000 to $240,000 on 
average? What are we thinking? These 
women and men are critical to our fu-
ture and our own healthcare. Why do 
we burden them with this certain awe-
some debt that they have to carry for-
ward and build their career around? 
That is why this bill really seeks to 
look at this from a new angle and says 
that we ought to reward those medical 
students who are willing to practice in 
areas of greatest need—minority stu-
dents as well—and provide for them 
scholarships to defray the cost of med-
ical school so they don’t end up grad-
uating with this incredible financial 
burden. This legislation would help 
provide doctors, nurses, mental health 
professionals, dentists, and others to 
communities 
with 
shortages 
which 
often contribute to health disparities 
as I described earlier—inner-city areas, 
rural America, smalltown America. 
Studies show that having doctors who 
reflect the communities they treat ac-
tually helps health outcomes. So my 
bill would help to expand the represen-
tation of minorities in the workforce. 
Last week, in a letter to the CDC, 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, I urged the agency to support 
global efforts to build up our commu-
nity health workforce capacity. Com-
munities of color across America are 
suffering 
at 
disproportionate 
rates 
across this pandemic, and we have to 
step up to help all Americans against 
the threat of coronavirus. It is unac-
ceptable, but sadly not surprising, that 
communities of color are bearing the 
burden of this dangerous virus. I stand 
here to continue fighting with my col-
leagues in the Senate to try to solve 
these inequities happening in commu-
nities across the Nation. 
There aren’t many redlines that have 
been drawn publicly so far as we have 
considered coronavirus legislation. We 
passed the original CARES Act, $2.2 
trillion, with 96 votes on the floor of 
the Senate and with no dissenting 
votes. The next bill, the coronavirus 
3.5, as it was characterized, passed the 
U.S. Senate by a voice vote, adding $484 
billion to the effort. More will obvi-
ously be needed, not just for small 
business loans but also for unemploy-
ment insurance and certainly to make 
sure that our hospitals, large and 
small, can survive this crisis as we all 
hope America will. We are certain they 
will, but we have to be prepared to do 
that. 
Yet, this morning, the Republican 
leader came forward and said he is 
drawing a redline; that Republicans 
will not move forward when it comes to 
dealing with these challenges without 
addressing one issue, and that was the 
issue of legal liability. I will not de-
scribe in detail what the Senator from 
Kentucky is proposing because we 
haven’t seen it, but what he is sug-
gesting 
is 
that 
our 
greatest 
fear 
shouldn’t be the coronavirus; it should 
be trial lawyers—trial lawyers. 
He is fearful that we are going to see 
COVID–19 lawsuits. Well, let me tell 
you, there could easily be COVID–19 
lawsuits and some—and I think most 
Americans 
would 
agree—should 
be 
filed. Is there a COVID–19 lawsuit if 
someone is profiteering with protective 
equipment, raising the prices way be-
yond reach because they have this mo-
ment of opportunity with the crisis we 
are facing? One downstate hospital in 
Illinois talked about surgical gowns 
that cost 22 cents apiece and now cost 
between $11 and $20 apiece. Clearly, 
there is price gouging and profiteering. 
If we can, can we hold those respon-
sible for profiteering liable? I would 
say yes. Is that a COVID–19 lawsuit? I 
think it is related to COVID–19, but it 
relates to it in a way that most Ameri-
cans would agree there should be legal 
action. 
If there are scams and profiteering, 
the people responsible for it should be 
held legally responsible in a lawsuit, if 
necessary. If people are promulgating 
phony tests and making representa-
tions that are a fraud on the public, 
should they be held accountable? Well, 
of course. Is that a COVID–19 lawsuit? 
Could be. 
What about those who are talking 
about the protection of workers? If 
workers are not protected on the job, 
they may be turning to workers’ com-
pensation for any of the injuries and 
illnesses that result. Are we going to 
stop those as COVID–19 lawsuits going 
too far? Nurses are suing in some situa-
tions because they are not being given 
adequate or quality protective equip-
ment. Do we want to stop that litiga-
tion as well? Is that what the Senator 
from Kentucky is suggesting? 
There is an interesting situation 
with meatpacking workers right now. I 
know a little more than some Senators 
about that. When I was working my 
way through college, I spent 12 months 
working in a meatpacking plant in 
East St. Louis, IL. I was paid $3.65 an 
hour. I thought that was pretty good, 
but it was hard, hard work. I saw what 
it was like then, many, many years 
ago. I have gone back to see the 
meatpacking 
and 
meat 
processors 
today. It is not much different. People 
stand literally elbow-to-elbow, shoul-
der-to-shoulder, 
as 
conveyor 
belts 
bring through hundreds and hundreds 
of pounds of meat and poultry that 
have to be acted on immediately to 
keep up with the line. It is tough, hard 
work, and now it turns out to be an ex-
traordinarily dangerous line of work as 
well. We are learning that dispropor-
tionate numbers of workers in this in-
dustry are coming down with the 
COVID virus infection. United Food 
and Commercial Workers, which rep-
resents many of these plant workers, 
estimated that at least 5,000 have al-
ready reported infected and anywhere 
from 10 to 20 have died. Now the Presi-
dent issues an Executive order man-
dating that these companies open for 
business. Well, I can say to the Presi-
dent, yes, they should open, but only if 
they dedicate themselves to the health 
and safety of their workforce as the 
highest 
priority. 
Let’s 
make 
that 
workplace safe before we talk about 
making it a mandatory opening. 
In fairness to the industry, in my 
State of Illinois, several companies 
that have been affected have reached 
out to us and are, in fact, determined 
to make their workplace safe. I salute 
them for taking that approach. They 
are talking about testing and making 
sure that workers on the job have nec-
essary distancing and protective equip-
ment. That is the right approach. In 
the meantime, those companies that 
ignore that responsibility, should they 
bear some liability for the illnesses or 
injuries that result? Well, under work-
ers’ compensation law, they certainly 
would. Is the Senator from Kentucky 
calling that the COVID–19 lawsuit? It 
could be related to COVID–19, for sure. 
Should they have their day in court? I 
certainly hope so. 
As we look at the challenges before 
us, and there are many, this notion of 
drawing a redline on legal liability, un-
fortunately, fails to take into account 
that system of justice in America 
which we have turned to in good times 
and bad to make sure that justice is 
meted out to those who have no re-
course but to consider lawsuits in 
court. Let’s take this issue seriously, 
carefully. Let’s not squander the op-
portunity of protecting the people who 
are risking their lives every day in es-
sential workplaces and believe they, 
too, should be protected by our system 
of justice. I will stand with them, and 
I hope that other Members of the Sen-
ate will join me. 
I yield the floor.

ator from South Dakota. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, after 
a few weeks of working remotely to 
help flatten the coronavirus curve, we 
are back in Washington to continue 
our coronavirus response and address 
other important issues. It has been an 
incredibly difficult couple of months 
for our country and, in fact, for most of 
the world. More than 1 million Ameri-
cans have contracted the coronavirus, 
and thousands have died. Our economy 
has taken a huge hit. Millions of Amer-
icans are out of work, and businesses 
are struggling to stay afloat. Ameri-
cans are worried. They are worried 
about their own health. They are wor-
ried about the health of their families 
and loved ones, and they are worried 
about their finances. 
My colleagues and I know that Amer-
icans are suffering. Our overriding pri-
ority over the past 2 months has been

May 5, 2020 
responding to the coronavirus crisis. 
We passed several major response bills 
and provided substantially more than 
$2 trillion in assistance. We have fund-
ed testing, medical care, personal pro-
tective equipment for frontline medical 
personnel, vaccine and treatment de-
velopment, paid sick leave, unemploy-
ment benefits, direct relief payments 
to American citizens, forgivable loans 
for small businesses, and much more. 
Our goal has been to provide a com-
prehensive response, addressing not 
just the medical priorities but also the 
economic impact this virus has had on 
so many American families, and there 
is more work to be done. Right now a 
big part of that work is monitoring the 
implementation of legislation we have 
already passed. We provided a tremen-
dous amount of money, and we need to 
make sure it is getting to where it 
needs to go as quickly as possible and 
is being spent in the most effective 
way. 
Monitoring the implementation of 
the legislation we have already passed 
is also crucial for informing any future 
legislation. As I said, we have provided 
a tremendous amount of money for 
coronavirus, equal to almost 50 percent 
of the entire Federal budget for 2020, 
and it is important that any future 
funding be carefully targeted. We need 
to make sure that Federal dollars are 
going only to real coronavirus prior-
ities. Our children and grandchildren 
will be footing the bill for the money 
we are adding to the national debt. 
As a case in point, the debt to GDP, 
which was scheduled to be 79 percent 
this year, is now expected to be, in the 
Year 2020, 101 percent. That jump from 
79 percent debt to GDP to 101 percent 
debt to GDP is the largest jump, I am 
told, literally, since 1943, in the middle 
of World War II. So it is essential that 
we spend wisely. 
In addition to overseeing the imple-
mentation of the coronavirus legisla-
tion we passed and gathering data to 
inform any future bills, we also have a 
number of coronavirus-related nomina-
tions to consider, something that is a 
role that is unique to the U.S. Senate 
under the Constitution. When it comes 
to judicial nominations, nominations 
to the executive branch, the Senate has 
the responsibility to ensure that we 
conduct 
the 
research, 
investigate 
nominees, hold confirmation hearings, 
and ultimately vote to put people into 
key positions in the administration 
and on the courts. 
So the question about why we are 
here this week I think is a fairly easy 
one to answer, and that is because 
there are lots of really important posi-
tions that are key not only to the 
healthcare crisis we are facing in this 
country but to our ongoing national se-
curity priorities as well as to the eco-
nomic challenges we are facing through 
this crisis. 
In fact, this week, the Senate Bank-
ing Committee will be holding a hear-
ing on the nomination of Brian D. Mil-
ler to be the special inspector general 
for pandemic recovery at the Treasury 
Department, a key role created by the 
legislation that we passed here in the 
Congress, critically important to the 
implementation, making sure every-
thing is done in the right way. As we 
all know, inspectors general pay a key 
oversight role in Federal departments, 
helping to root out waste, fraud, and 
other abuses of taxpayer dollars. If 
confirmed, Mr. Miller will be an essen-
tial part of ensuring that the trillions 
we provided for coronavirus relief are 
spent properly. 
Committees are doing other essential 
coronavirus work this week as well. 
The Senate Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions Committee is holding 
hearings on an initiative Senators 
Blunt, Alexander, and others worked to 
get included in the coronavirus legisla-
tion. This initiative was designed to 
spur innovation in private sector and 
public sector collaboration, with a goal 
of 
dramatically 
increasing 
our 
coronavirus testing capabilities. So 
that is going on in the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee. 
The Senate Commerce Committee, of 
which I am a Member, is holding a 
hearing this week looking at the im-
pact of COVID–19 on the airline indus-
try, an industry we know is being pro-
foundly impacted by what is happening 
with the virus. 
Next week, the Senate Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee 
will be hearing directly from the lead-
ers 
of 
our 
fight 
against 
the 
coronavirus—Drs. Fauci, Redfield, and 
Hahn and Admiral Giroir. Committee 
work will play a key role in any future 
coronavirus bill, and it is good to have 
committees able to meet once again 
here in Washington, DC. 
Of course, while the COVID–19 pan-
demic will continue to be our priority 
in Washington in the coming weeks 
and months, there is other essential 
work that we have to do for the Amer-
ican people: appropriations bills, nomi-
nations to essential administration 
posts, and critical national security 
legislation is just some of the items on 
our agenda over the next couple of 
months. This week, the Senate Armed 
Services Committee and the Senate In-
telligence Committee are holding hear-
ings on nominees for key national se-
curity positions, including the Director 
of National Intelligence and the Sec-
retary of the Navy. 
Senate Republicans are committed to 
getting our country through this crisis 
and helping American workers and 
businesses deal with the virus’s impact. 
We will be discussing a lot of ideas over 
the next couple of weeks, from tax and 
regulatory relief to support farmers 
and ranchers to ways to spur job cre-
ation and shield responsible businesses 
from frivolous litigation once the econ-
omy is opened up again. As I said, we 
will continue to focus on making sure 
that the money we provided gets where 
it is needed as fast as possible. 
The United States undoubtedly has 
more tough days ahead, but we are 
going to get through them. We are 
going to come out tougher on the other 
side. In the meantime, we have work to 
do here in the U.S. Senate. People 
across this country are hurting and 
struggling, and there are many prior-
ities that need to be addressed. So I am 
pleased that the Senate is open for 
business. We are going to be working 
the next few months, as I mentioned, 
on the national defense authorization 
bill, a piece of legislation that we have 
to do on an annual basis that deals 
with all of our national priorities, 
making sure that the men and women 
who defend this country, the American 
people, and our interests around the 
world have the training, equipment, 
and resources to do their jobs to keep 
Americans safe. 
We have a critical water infrastruc-
ture bill that will be marked up by the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee, also a piece of legislation that 
is important to the economy in this 
country. If you look at the long list of 
things and priorities that we need to 
deal with here in the U.S. Senate, it is 
important that we be about the peo-
ple’s business. 
I know I can speak from personal ex-
perience that over the past several 
weeks, like my colleagues, we have 
worked really hard to stay connected. I 
worked really hard to stay in touch 
with people across South Dakota using 
technology, platforms, and apps that I 
never really had much experience with 
using in the past. From Zoom to 
Skype, to Google Hangouts, to Shindig, 
there are all kinds of interesting new 
apps that I think many of us became 
acquainted with, conducting lots of vir-
tual meetings and staying in touch 
with our constituents to see what is 
important to them, finding out what is 
working and what is not working and 
getting feedback on what we could be 
doing to even better respond to the cri-
sis that is out there. But there is no 
substitute, when it comes to doing the 
Nation’s business, for being here, for 
committees to work, to meet, for us to 
be able to vote, for us to be able to deal 
with the important nominations I men-
tioned that under the Constitution, we, 
the Senate, have an obligation and re-
sponsibility to advise and consent on, 
whether that is a judicial nomination, 
key Cabinet post, or an important ad-
ministration position that pertains to 
national security and the virus. 
There are lots of priority items for 
which the U.S. Senate has a key and 
principal responsibility, and we need to 
be about that business. So I hope, in 
the days and weeks ahead, as we take 
on those challenges, that we can work 
together in a way that provides max-
imum safety for the people who work 
here but also gives the important pri-
ority to the items and the issues that 
are critical to Americans at this point, 
in the middle of this crisis and, hope-
fully, when we get on the other side of 
it, those important critical national se-
curity priorities, economic priorities, 
and other business that the American

people need us to deal with on a daily 
basis. 
I thank the Presiding Officer for the 
time and look forward to working with 
my colleagues, albeit in different cir-
cumstances than we have had to deal 
with in the past but, nevertheless, to 
have the U.S. Senate, the people’s rep-
resentatives, here doing the important 
work the American people expect us to 
do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas is recognized. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, let 
me join our friend and my friend, the 
Senator from South Dakota, and say 
that I am glad to be back in this Cham-
ber doing the work of 29 million Tex-
ans. I see the Presiding Officer and my 
partner, my fellow Senator from Texas, 
joining us as well. 
I was listening closely to the Senator 
from South Dakota’s recitation of all 
the things we have to do. There is no 
shortage of work for us to do, and there 
is no reason for us to continue to curl 
up in a fetal position in some undis-
closed location and be afraid to go out-
doors. 
The fact is, the experts at the Cen-
ters for Disease Control, people like Dr. 
Fauci and Dr. Birx, whom we have seen 
on TV on a nightly basis, tell us what 
we need to do in order to function safe-
ly. It is the same thing that our gro-
cery clerks and our doctors and nurses 
and, frankly, our law enforcement per-
sonnel are doing. We know how to do 
this and how to do it safely. 
At the same time, we simply cannot 
hide out and not show up for work. 
What kind of message does that send to 
the American people? 
We know this is an extraordinary cri-
sis, an unprecedented crisis, and we 
have done some things we would never 
consider doing under normal times— 
appropriating more than $3 trillion at 
warp speed. I, frankly, think it is a 
good time for us to tap the brakes and 
to consider what it is we have already 
done and where we need to make some 
corrections. 
Anytime you do anything this big 
and this fast, you are going to make 
some mistakes. We have seen that, and 
there have been corrections both in 
terms of the way the Treasury is ad-
ministering the program, but also we 
have heard about gaps. For example, I 
have done a number of video con-
ferences with our chambers of com-
merce around the country, and they 
ask me: Why did you leave the cham-
bers out of the support under the Pay-
check Protection Program for non-
profits? I, frankly, don’t have a good 
answer for that. I said that is some-
thing we need to go back and fix. If we 
can’t do it by Treasury guidance, then 
we need to do it by future legislation. 
I have no doubt we will continue to 
legislate, but we need to do it smartly. 
We need to be here in person so we can 
have the interaction and deliberation 
and debates that are so important to 
coming up with a good product. 
We have done some pretty extraor-
dinary work in the last 6 weeks or so. 
Both Chambers have come together 
and quickly passed four separate pieces 
of legislation to strengthen our re-
sponse to the coronavirus. 
We sent vital funding to our hos-
pitals. Ironically, at a time when our 
hospitals were the frontline of defense 
dealing with people with COVID–19, 
many of them were laying off employ-
ees because we had asked them to forgo 
elective surgery, which is one of the 
ways that they end up paying the bills. 
Then we learned, in the global com-
petition for personal protective equip-
ment, literally every mayor, every 
Governor, every President, every lead-
er of every country around the world 
was in a global rush to try to come up 
with personal protective equipment. 
One of the things I have told my con-
stituents and friends that I think we 
have learned is we can’t depend on 
China and on these uncertain supply 
chains for things as important as per-
sonal protective equipment—or phar-
maceuticals, for that matter. So these 
are some of the lessons and some of the 
feedback we have gotten as we have 
interacted with our constituents. 
We know that testing has gotten 
much more widespread, and we have 
made tremendous advances in terms of 
treatment with all the clinical trials 
that are underway—well over 70 of 
them—and now the hope of a vaccine, 
hopefully sooner rather than later. 
Once we get a vaccine, then hopefully 
this will be relegated to the same sta-
tus as the seasonal flu, for which we 
typically do have a vaccine, so the par-
ticularly vulnerable individuals—the 
elderly, people with underlying chronic 
disease—can be protected first and 
foremost. 
We also sent funding to our State and 
local Governors: $150 billion. Now, we 
have all talked to our mayors and our 
county judges—in Texas, that is what 
we call our county leaders—and Gov-
ernors. Obviously, the sales tax rev-
enue has fallen off a cliff because there 
is not much business going on in our 
retail stores, to be sure, although there 
is a lot going on online with deliveries 
and those sorts of orders. 
But we know our State and local gov-
ernments provide for law enforcement 
and other essential services, so we felt 
it was important to throw them a life-
line, too, to help them meet their budg-
ets and maintain those vital services. 
Perhaps the most ambitious and the 
most popular thing we did is to try to 
help our small businesses stay afloat 
through the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. Obviously, this was successful— 
or it is certainly popular in that $350 
billion was spent in 2 weeks. Then we 
had to come back and replenish that 
with another $320 billion. But we know 
that money is flying out of our local 
community banks and credit unions, 
helping small businesses keep their 
employees on the payroll. And, if they 
do that, then this low-interest loan 
will turn into a grant. 
The goal, of course, is, once we defeat 
this virus—as we will—we will then be 
in a position for those businesses to 
bring their employees back, if they 
have furloughed them, to help us build 
out of this recession in which we are 
currently involved. 
We also provided critical funding for 
our farmers and ranchers and other 
producers so they can keep our country 
fed. We have taken unprecedented steps 
to minimize the impact of this virus on 
the American people and our economy 
and tried to provide some modicum of 
certainty amid so much uncertainty. 
I don’t think there is a single event 
in my lifetime that rivals the breadth 
and depth of the crisis that we have 
reached. Certainly, 9/11 was a different 
type of crisis. The 2008 great reces-
sion—with the meltdown of the banks 
on Wall Street and the great recession, 
those were significant events to be 
sure, but nothing quite has rivaled 
what the coronavirus has done to our 
public health and to our economy. 
The cascading consequences of this 
virus have reached every community, 
every sector of our economy, and every 
corner of the globe. Every single Amer-
ican has experienced some sort of shift 
in their daily routine as a result of the 
virus. Maybe ‘‘shift’’ is too tentative a 
word. Actually, many of us have had 
our lives turned on their head. 
For some, the changes were very sig-
nificant. Think about those who con-
tracted the virus, the loved ones who 
couldn’t 
be 
at 
their 
side, 
the 
healthcare workers who were there and 
are helping them, those who are sick. 
Then there are billions of Americans 
who have lost their jobs, small business 
owners wondering whether they are 
going to cease to exist and whether 
they can survive this current crisis, 
and then the farmers seeing a glut of 
supply and reduced demand. 
Now, many people have been able to 
safely work from home, and that is 
wonderful, but often they end up pull-
ing double duty as teachers for their 
children with the schools having been 
closed, and others have continued 
heading out to work every day to keep 
the cogs of our society running—so- 
called essential workers. 
By the way, I really don’t like the 
designation between essential and non-
essential. I think, really, what we 
ought to call it is safe and unsafe be-
cause all workers are, I believe, essen-
tial. 
In ways big and small, this virus has 
affected everybody in this country. 
While we must continue working to 
slow the spread and reduce the eco-
nomic impact, we cannot ignore the 
profound human impact it has had. 
Many people have been isolated under 
very difficult circumstances, not know-
ing whether they will still have a job 
to go back to. Many are living with the 
uncertainty of this pandemic, perhaps 
in a crowded house or apartment with 
children, maybe elderly parents and 
others, cut off from the rest of society. 
It is no secret that this pandemic is 
taking a toll on America’s mental

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2232 
May 5, 2020 
health. Last weekend, the family of a 
New York City emergency room doctor 
released some devastating news. Dr. 
Lorna Breen had been in the trenches 
battling this virus for weeks. She was 
working long hours, as many of our 
healthcare providers are, and told her 
family about the devastation that she 
was seeing every day. 
She contracted COVID–19 and took a 
week and a half off to recover, but then 
she went back to work, eager to help 
where she could. Shortly after, Dr. 
Breen’s family intervened and brought 
her home to Charlottesville, VA, to 
rest and to spend a little time with her 
family and for R&R. 
Sadly, tragically, the struggles Dr. 
Breen was facing felt untenable. After 
overcoming COVID–19, she ultimately 
took her own life by suicide. 
Dr. Breen was a hero who devoted her 
entire life to caring for others, to put-
ting others before herself. While her 
tragic death cannot be reversed, it 
should serve as a warning signal about 
the broader impact of this virus. 
In a recent poll by the Kaiser Family 
Foundation, nearly half of Americans 
reported that coronavirus is having a 
negative 
impact 
on 
their 
mental 
health—one-half. That is up from one- 
third in March. The number of texts to 
the Federal Disaster Distress Helpline 
skyrocketed in April—more than a 
1,000-percent increase. 
As we continue to discuss what fu-
ture coronavirus legislation could look 
like, we cannot ignore the mental 
health impact. Nationwide, we rely on 
the community mental health centers 
and community behavioral health or-
ganizations to support those battling 
mental health and substance abuse dis-
orders. As the need for these services 
has increased, resources have actually 
decreased. More than 90 percent of the 
community behavioral health organi-
zations nationwide have been forced to 
reduce their operations—reduce their 
operations at a time of increased need 
and demand—and more than 60 percent 
of 
behavioral 
health 
organizations 
project they can’t survive financially 
for more than 3 months under the cur-
rent COVID–19 conditions. 
Congress tried to do something to 
help. We provided $175 billion for the 
Public Health and Social Services 
Emergency Fund to support healthcare 
providers on the frontlines of this cri-
sis. As this funding is being distrib-
uted, mental health providers cannot 
be forgotten. 
Along with 24 of our colleagues, Sen-
ator STABENOW and I have sent a letter 
to Secretary Azar and Administrator 
Verma, urging them to quickly allo-
cate this funding and ensure that these 
mental health organizations are in-
cluded. Not only do they provide vital 
care and support for individuals strug-
gling with mental health issues; they 
also are key to fighting addiction and 
substance abuse. 
Those struggling to overcome addic-
tion are often living in a fragile state, 
fighting each day to stay the course, 
but the current circumstances have 
made those daily battles much more 
difficult. They are isolated from their 
friends and loved ones, and they are 
dealing with the anxiety caused by the 
virus and possibly—probably—facing fi-
nancial struggles. 
The new stressors brought on by this 
virus are compounded by reduced ca-
pacity for treatment. In-person support 
meetings are canceled, treatment clin-
ics and counselors are curtailing ap-
pointments, and the barriers to over-
coming addiction loom even larger. For 
those individuals, treatment cannot 
simply be delayed. 
Our country has made serious in-
roads in our battle against the opioid 
epidemic. In 2018, overdose deaths were 
down 4 percent from the previous year, 
the first decrease in nearly three dec-
ades. We can’t let the coronavirus de-
rail the progress we have fought so 
hard to make. 
The CARES Act—I am glad to say— 
does expand access to telehealth. I 
think many Americans are experi-
encing the benefits of telehealth, and I 
predict at some point this will change 
a lot of the ways that we receive con-
sultation by healthcare providers: not 
having to drive our car and make ap-
pointments, pay for parking, spend a 
lot of time out of our day. We can sim-
ply do it through video conference, 
conveniently and effectively. But more 
must be done to support those battling 
addiction and mental health chal-
lenges. 
For those who are transitioning from 
the criminal justice system, the need 
for additional resources and support is 
especially dire. Earlier this year, Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL and I introduced the 
Crisis Stabilization and Community 
Reentry Act to support those who have 
been a part of the criminal justice sys-
tem and to provide stable treatment 
for those with mental illness. 
Most prisoners who are receiving 
treatment for a mental health or a sub-
stance use disorder are released with-
out a plan to keep them on their regi-
men. This often leads to higher recidi-
vism rates, unsurprisingly, which could 
be avoided. It also means that law en-
forcement is, all too often, left to be 
the first responders for those suffering 
a mental health crisis, which can esca-
late those confrontations and put both 
the officer and the individual in that 
crisis at risk. 
This bill creates grants to connect 
law enforcement, State and local, and 
community resources to help individ-
uals who are either engaged in the 
criminal justice system or have been 
released from prison and makes it pos-
sible for them to access the resources 
they need to have a successful reentry 
into civilized society. These grants 
connect those services to make sure 
that people suffering from an acute epi-
sode can access treatment without the 
risk of being reincarcerated. 
We are facing a battle unlike any we 
have seen in my lifetime, and the 
stress and the anxiety that come with 
it are taking a tremendous toll on the 
American people. It is not just the 
virus and the threat of catching the 
virus that are taking the toll. We need 
to look at this holistically and realize, 
if you are a victim of domestic violence 
and you are forced to be confined with 
your abuser and have nowhere else to 
go and maybe have no money coming 
in the front door, only to have your 
abuser abusing alcohol and perhaps be-
coming even more violent—there are a 
whole catalog of problems associated 
with this virus and the virus itself, the 
risk of infection being just one, and we 
need to look at this holistically. 
As our discussions continue this 
week on how to support the American 
people during this unprecedented time, 
resources for mental health and sub-
stance abuse treatment providers can-
not fall by the wayside.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
over the past few months, both parties 
have worked together to provide his-
toric levels of funding to help small 
businesses retain employees, meet pay-
roll, and stay afloat during the COVID– 
19 pandemic. The Paycheck Protection 
Program—the main instrument to help 
small businesses—received $349 billion 
under the CARES Act and another $310 
billion in supplemental legislation. 
The public has a right to know how 
this money is being spent. Oversight, 
transparency, and accountability are 
crucial because from the moment the 
administration 
began 
implementing 
these funds, it became clear that much 
of it wasn’t going to those who needed 
it most. 
Today, we are not taking any other 
action 
on 
the 
floor 
dealing 
with 
COVID. We thought we would take this 
opportunity to ask unanimous consent 
to get something real done that should 
have bipartisan support on both sides 
of the aisle. Who can be against trans-
parency? Who can be against account-
ability? Who cannot want to know 
where close to $700 billion of the tax-
payers’ money is going? Is it going to 
the right places? 
Unfortunately, today at least 200 
publicly traded companies have man-
aged to secure PPP loans, and most of 
those are not very small, including 
some companies whose owners are 
large contributors to President Trump.

May 5, 2020 
hundreds of thousands of mom-and-pop 
shops with less than 20 employees, the 
proverbial restaurant owner or the 
butcher, the baker, and the candlestick 
maker—have been mostly shut out be-
cause they didn’t have a standing rela-
tionship with a big bank. 
There have been great disparities 
when it comes to minority-owned busi-
nesses. According to the Center for Re-
sponsible Lending, over 90 percent of 
African-American-owned and Latino- 
owned businesses were likely shut out 
of PPP funding. Women-owned busi-
nesses have also been neglected. We 
have tried to fix some of these prob-
lems in COVID 3.5, working closely 
with the Senators from Maryland and 
New Hampshire and the Senator from 
Florida, but much more needs to be 
done. We need data to help further in-
form who is being left out so we can 
continue to make the necessary fixes 
to see that all small businesses are 
helped. 
My friends Senators CARDIN and SHA-
HEEN have a bill they worked on to do 
just that. I want to thank them. They 
will talk more about this bill in a mo-
ment, but I want to make one point 
here. This is a very simple piece of leg-
islation. It requires the kind of trans-
parency expected from any Federal 
program of this size and importance: 
regular public reporting of how and 
where taxpayer dollars are spent. 
This is something my Republican col-
leagues have always believed in. I hope 
that my Republican colleagues will not 
object to this legislation when I ask 
unanimous consent in a few minutes, 
after Senators CARDIN
and SHAHEEN 
have spoken. I hope they will not ob-
ject just because it comes from this 
side of the aisle. It is a good idea. 
There is no reason to object to this 
very unobjectionable idea and get this 
body focused on COVID, not on extra-
neous matters, which we seem to be 
doing now, when COVID is the most 
important issue we face. 
We are doing quite literally nothing 
else on the floor of the Senate today. 
There is no other business before us, no 
votes whatsoever. We are here to force 
some action, force some progress, and 
force some focus on COVID-related leg-
islation. I prefer to do this in a com-
pletely bipartisan way. But from the 
get-go, Democrats have had to force 
the issue on many COVID response pro-
grams. The leader lays down a bill, it 
has no Democratic input, and then, of 
course, we have to work toward that 
goal, and we have. The fact that the 
first bill passed 96 to 0 is a tribute to 
this body that we can come together 
when there is real need. 
We should be doing it the same way 
today. We should be working together 
in support of our healthcare system, 
for testing so desperately needed, un-
employment insurance, and crucial im-
provements to small business lending, 
all of which Democrats said we need-
ed—our Republican friends first re-
sisted and then came along, led by the 
Republican leader—and all of which 
passed with unanimous support. 
The same thing should happen today. 
We should pass this. We should UC it 
and get the oversight this program so 
desperately needs. 
I yield the floor to Senator CARDIN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, let 
me thank Leader SCHUMER for initi-
ating this discussion. I am very pleased 
Senator SHAHEEN is also on the floor. 
The two of us worked on the Demo-
cratic side, with Senator RUBIO and 
Senator COLLINS
on the Republican 
side. We are very proud of the tools we 
made 
available 
to 
small 
business. 
These are important tools to keep 
small businesses alive during COVID– 
19. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
got money out quickly and helped 
small businesses stay afloat. We have 
provided $660 billion under the Pay-
check Protection Program. The eco-
nomic disaster loan program, the loan 
and grant program—we have now pro-
vided $70 billion for that program. But 
here is the issue. We had to adjust both 
of those programs without even know-
ing all the specifics on how the first 
amount of money was distributed. We 
are hearing that we are going to be 
running out of money again soon and 
that Congress is going to be asked to 
make additional changes in these pro-
grams, and we still don’t know the spe-
cifics on how this money was distrib-
uted. 
We are all frustrated here. I really 
appreciate the leadership. I know my 
chairman is on the floor. He has been 
demanding this information and has 
been unable to get it. We are going to 
be asked to act again without having 
the specific information. 
Senator SCHUMER is absolutely right. 
We know in the first round that those 
who had preferred relationships with 
banking institutions got priority. That 
we know. But we don’t know how 
much. We don’t know how many loans 
the big banks have issued and what size 
they have issued, what their compensa-
tion has been, and how those loan deci-
sions were made. We need to know that 
because we are relying on the private 
banking institutions to make the 7(a) 
loans in all communities. 
We expanded this program to non-
profits. That was a good thing. But we 
don’t know how many of the nonprofits 
have received help under this pro-
gram—the specific dollar amounts, the 
specific loans, the specific locations. 
Here is the challenge. I got a call yes-
terday where they wanted to expand 
eligibility under this program. We 
know there are some difficulties in the 
programs themselves that need atten-
tion. There is now a desire to expand 
eligibility. They are also being asked 
what comes next. 
Restaurants are still ordered to be 
closed in my State. They are going to 
need additional help. How do we go 
about crafting what we need to do if we 
don’t know what has been done al-
ready? 
We have been asking for this infor-
mation 
over 
and 
over 
again. 
We 
haven’t been able to get it. It is our re-
sponsibility to oversight these pro-
grams. 
Now I am quoting from my chairman. 
He said—and I agree with him—it is 
our responsibility to oversight. But if 
we don’t have the information, how can 
we oversight? I am concerned about 
underbanked and underserved commu-
nities getting their fair share of this 
help, and yet we don’t have the spe-
cifics on the number of minority small 
businesses, the number of women- 
owned small businesses, the number of 
veteran-owned small businesses. We 
don’t know about rural small busi-
nesses and how well they have done. 
We need to have that information in 
order to make the next judgments in 
this Congress. And yes, we do need 
transparency because we have even 
heard from this administration that 
there may very well have been small 
businesses that didn’t qualify for this 
loan that have gotten help or had their 
own ability to handle this crisis but 
yet still asked the government for 
these funds or may have violated the 
size standards that are in this legisla-
tion. 
We need to have that transparency 
for oversight. It is our responsibility. 
That is why we do need to act as a Sen-
ate. The legislation that we are going 
to bring forward is very common sense. 
It just tells the Small Business Admin-
istration to make available the infor-
mation on the PPP loans, on the EIDL 
loans and grants, so that we can ana-
lyze this, know how these loans have 
been made and make the proper over-
sight and adjustment that we may need 
to make in these programs in order to 
make 
sure 
small 
businesses 
get 
through COVID–19. 
I urge my colleagues, let’s get this 
done and continue to work in a bipar-
tisan way to make sure small busi-
nesses in this country are protected. 
I see Senator SHAHEEN is on the floor. 
I will yield the floor so Senator SHA-
HEEN can be recognized. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
am pleased to be able to join my col-
league Senator CARDIN, who is the 
ranking member on the Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship Committee, as 
well as Minority Leader SCHUMER. I am 
pleased that the chairman of the Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship Com-
mittee, Senator RUBIO, is also here be-
cause Senator CARDIN, Senator RUBIO, 
Senator COLLINS, and I all worked on 
the Paycheck Protection Program and 
the small business provisions that are 
in the CARES package that we passed 
over 5 weeks ago. I am proud of our ef-
forts to negotiate in a bipartisan way 
to help small businesses get through 
this crisis. 
Not only did we pass, in that first 
CARES package, $350 billion to help 
small business, but just a couple of 
weeks ago, Congress also came to-
gether to pass an additional $370 billion

May 5, 2020 
for the Paycheck Protection Program 
and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan 
Program. 
Our intent in passing that legislation 
was to deliver relief to small busi-
nesses that are truly hurting. Small 
businesses are the lifeblood of this 
economy nationally, really, and cer-
tainly in New Hampshire, where 99 per-
cent of our businesses are considered 
small businesses. They employ over 50 
percent of the New Hampshire work-
force. 
In New Hampshire, 20,000 small busi-
nesses and nonprofits have received 
over $2.5 billion in low-interest, forgiv-
able loans under the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program. There have been chal-
lenges. We have heard some of those 
stories from small businesses that 
weren’t able to access this assistance 
because some larger businesses got into 
the queue ahead of them—some of 
those large, publicly traded companies 
that had a relationship with their lend-
er, and so they were able to get in 
early. We need information if we are 
going 
to 
correct 
the 
things 
that 
haven’t been working about this pro-
gram. That is why the legislation that 
Senator CARDIN, Senator SCHUMER, and 
I are introducing, I think, would be so 
helpful. 
The Trump administration and Con-
gress need to be held accountable for 
implementation of these programs. In 
order to do that, we have to have over-
sight, as Senator CARDIN said. Trans-
parency is fundamental. We need to en-
sure that assistance is going to the 
small businesses and nonprofits that 
need it most. 
Senator CARDIN listed off a number of 
those companies: the women-owned 
companies, minority-owned companies. 
We also need to think about those busi-
nesses that have fewer than 10 employ-
ees—those mom-and-pop shops that 
really need help, that may not have as 
long a relationship with their lender or 
may not have any relationship with a 
lender. 
All we are asking for today is a meas-
ure that would provide the bare min-
imum that this administration should 
provide to ensure that these programs 
are functioning as Congress intended. 
This is commonsense legislation. All 
it would do is require the Small Busi-
ness Administration to provide daily 
reporting on PPP and EIDL loans, to 
provide more detailed weekly reports 
on these programs, and to make this 
information publicly available, while 
at the same time protecting borrower 
and participant privacy. 
We have heard the horror stories 
about problems with this program. 
There have also been a lot of success 
stories. But the public isn’t going to 
know both sides of that unless there is 
reporting and transparency so that 
people know what is working and what 
is not working. 
The bill would also ensure that PPP 
and EIDL funds are reaching under-
served and underbanked borrowers. It 
would establish an early warning sys-
tem for the SBA and for Congress so we 
can figure out how to respond to things 
that aren’t working and when we are 
expecting an additional funding short-
fall. 
These proposals shouldn’t be con-
troversial. These are all things that I 
have heard people on both sides of the 
aisle talking about supporting. What 
they will do is allow Congress to per-
form our basic oversight responsibil-
ities and foster public confidence in the 
integrity of these programs. And per-
haps, most important, these improve-
ments will help make sure that the 
limited resources that are available are 
getting to the small businesses that 
need them the most. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I want to thank my 
colleagues not only for their eloquent 
remarks but their hard work. We know 
that Senator RUBIO has a 2:30 appoint-
ment so Senator BLUMENTHAL has gra-
ciously agreed to speak after we ask 
our unanimous consent request. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of a 
bill that is at the desk that would re-
quire the Administrator of the Small 
Business Administration to report on 
COVID–19 recovery small business pro-
grams; I further ask that the bill be 
considered read three times and passed 
and the motion to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table, with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Reserving the right to 
object, let me first begin by saying 
that this is the first time I had a 
chance to speak on the floor about the 
Paycheck Protection Program since it 
passed. I want to say this unequivo-
cally. Despite everything you read out 
there, in my mind, I don’t think there 
is any question that by far this has 
been the most successful part of the 
CARES Act. 
To put it in perspective, this was 
something we worked on in a bipar-
tisan way. In less than a week, it was 
crafted, and then the agencies had less 
than 6 days to put together the rules. 
Until Friday, April 4, no bank in 
America had ever made a PPP loan; no 
one had ever applied for one; and the 
SBA had never approved one. It was a 
massive program. We looked at the re-
sults. They are stunning—the results 
that we have seen. 
Does the program have problems? 
Sure. I think any time that you create 
something that spends $500 billion, $600 
billion that reaches over 50 percent of 
the U.S. economy and put it together 
so quickly, there are going to be unin-
tended consequences. I will come back 
to that point in a moment. I think the 
biggest problem this program has had 
from the very beginning, which created 
some of these tensions that we read 
about in the press, is that it was under-
funded from the very beginning. I 
mean, the demand was greater than the 
supply, even potentially right now 
after the second round. 
We have heard the reports about pub-
licly traded companies. We all know 
how we feel about that, and I am glad 
that is being addressed now. I also 
want to put it in perspective. They 
have taken 0.35 percent of the funds 
that were approved—not 35 percent, 
not 3.5 percent, 0.35 percent of the 
money that has been lent. 
It is not like they took half the 
money, which is what the perception is 
that has been created in the coverage. 
Meanwhile, that means the rest of it 
went to somebody who is not publicly 
traded. 
That 
is 
an 
extraordinary 
achievement, nonetheless, and I am 
glad that is being looked at. 
On transparency, they are all valid 
points. 
Myself—Friday, 
Saturday—I 
was really upset that we weren’t get-
ting those numbers. The reason why I 
want the numbers is, A, we want to 
make sure this program that we put 
our names on and worked hard on—all 
of us have—is reaching its intended au-
dience and, B, the points that were 
made here as well, to the extent that 
changes have to be in any future fund-
ing, we want to make sure that future 
funding is targeted in the right way. 
The problem is—I was as upset as any-
body. 
I hope that the agencies are watching 
these 
proceedings 
now 
and 
under-
standing why it is so important that 
our Members have accurate details and 
regular information about how this 
program is rolling out. 
What we do know, when they finally 
released numbers on Saturday, is that 
in round 2, the average loan went from 
$206,000 in round 1 to $76,000 or so in 
round 2. That is a stunning drop. It 
tells you it is reaching smaller busi-
ness. 
We know that 72 percent of loans 
made in round 2 were under $50,000, and 
85 percent were under $100,000. We do 
know that 4,400 of the 5,200 lenders in 
the program—or 5,400 lenders in the 
program have less than $1 billion in as-
sets. We know it is reaching the re-
gional banks, the smaller banks, the 
credit unions. 
The reason why doing what is being 
proposed now will be problematic is 
twofold. The first is, some of the demo-
graphic data that is being asked is not 
on the application. It is not even clear 
that they would be able to produce 
that for us unless they stopped the 
process, created a new application, and 
then began the process as well. 
We will know the answer to that 
question in the forgiveness phase. I do 
believe in the forgiveness phase it is 
very valid to ask that information on 
demographics be included in the for-
giveness application that people are 
going to have to file. 
I think the best path forward is, in 
my view, not to pass something like 
this today, although something like 
this may be necessary if we can’t get 
these numbers. But let’s find out, first 
and foremost, what data points do they

have. What data points does the SBA 
have at their disposal and see if we can 
get them to do what they should be 
doing already, which is producing it on 
a regular—maybe not on a daily basis. 
What I don’t want to see is an already 
overburdened agency that is small to 
begin with and struggling to get all 
these programs running having to pull 
people off getting people money to fill 
out this information. 
We have to understand that in the 
end, it is not the Administrator or the 
Treasury Secretary who will have to 
write these things up and collect it. It 
is going to be people who, in many 
cases, are working from home, living in 
this region under all the restrictions 
that are there. 
I think this agency is already strug-
gling to manage this massive program, 
and to add an additional requirement 
without thinking it through would 
have an unintended consequence of po-
tentially slowing the program down. 
It is my view that we are going to 
find out all of this information, and we 
are going to know it in a timely fash-
ion so we can do something about it. I 
do not believe that passing this today 
is the right approach, given the fact 
that we first need to know what data 
they have at their disposal before we 
can ask them to produce it. Otherwise, 
I fear they are going to stop or they 
are going to slow down, and real busi-
nesses, small businesses, and not-for- 
profits will be delayed. I will object to 
this request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I want to thank my 
colleague from Florida. I believe he is 
sincere and has the best of intentions 
to want to make this program work. 
I want to make two quick points. The 
first point is, the more data we have 
and the sooner we have it, the better 
we can make the program. It will not 
slow it down. It will improve it and 
make it better—the sooner the better. 
Second, about demographic informa-
tion, I understand the problem, but 
there are a lot of ways to skin that cat. 
If we looked at ZIP Codes, we might 
very easily be able to tell demographic 
information. 
I thank my colleague. I regret that 
we cannot move this legislation—the 
only COVID legislation that will be 
talked about on the floor thus far, even 
though we were asked by the majority 
leader to come back during the crisis, 
and I hope we can move forward quick-
ly in the future to get the kind of in-
formation we need. 
With that I yield the floor. I yield to 
the Senator from Connecticut. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I thank my colleagues Senator 
CARDIN, Senator SHAHEEN, and Senator 
SCHUMER for their leadership on this 
issue of seeking better transparency 
and oversight with regard to a program 
that involves now almost a trillion tax-
payer dollars. I also join Senator SCHU-
MER in the sentiment that our col-
league from Florida has been both sin-
cere and bipartisan in his efforts on 
this program. 
The fact is that this program, the 
Paycheck Protection Program, cries 
out for stronger oversight as does the 
entire CARES package. We will now be 
spending an authorized $3 trillion—the 
Federal budget and then half again— 
with little or no oversight. Yet we 
know that this program meets a need 
among small businesses that is abso-
lutely critical. I have traveled my 
State via video conference and have 
had telephone calls and communica-
tions of all kinds with small businesses 
around Connecticut, and I have seen 
and heard firsthand how they are hang-
ing by a thread—struggling to keep 
their doors open and stay alive. This 
program gives them a lifeline. 
It has, in fact, provided many power-
ful success stories, as my colleague 
Senator SHAHEEN said, but it has also 
produced some horror stories about big 
customers of big banks who have re-
ceived favored treatment to the det-
riment of the smaller businesses that 
were supposed to have been the bene-
ficiaries of this program. We need to 
make sure that these funds go to the 
small businesses, which really need it, 
and we should make sure that this pro-
gram is adequately and effectively ad-
ministered. We need to make sure 
there is transparency and disclosure 
about who is receiving these loans that 
can be converted and forgiven so that 
they can become grants and so that the 
real needs of those businesses can be 
met and their employees can continue 
to be employed. Those kinds of impera-
tives we must assure. 
We know that the ripple effect of the 
closures of these businesses is tragic 
and traumatic. That is why we need to 
continue this program, but we need to 
do so with the oversight that assures 
that its purposes are met. For the busi-
nesses that have told me, for example, 
that they need more flexibility, those 
needs need to be met. Numbers of them 
have indicated they would like to ex-
tend the time provided to them to hire 
back their employees past the time in 
which the State is likely to allow them 
to open. They also need more funding 
for fixed costs. Basically, they need 
some flexibility because every business 
is different, and the oversight in this 
bill will help to alert the SBA and Con-
gress to those needs. 
Finally, the oversight needed here is 
simply one example of the account-
ability that should be imposed on the 
entire CARES Act. Real accountability 
demands a watchdog, not a lap dog, in 
order to stop the waste, fraud, and fa-
voritism that seems all too common in 
this administration. That is why I have 
been working with my colleagues— 
most prominently, Senator WARREN— 
in the strengthening of the oversight of 
programs created by the CARES Act 
during this pandemic. We need to make 
sure there is effective enforcement and 
a hammer, which will be essential to 
deter wrongdoing, preserve resources, 
and conserve credibility. 
Strong scrutiny is required to make 
sure that aid reaches the right hands. I 
know that all of us believe, for exam-
ple, that conflicts of interest should be 
barred; that retaliation against whis-
tleblowers should be prevented; and 
that the firing of the inspector general 
without just cause should be stopped, 
which means keeping an eye on these 
programs—not just a wandering eye 
but one of focused, strict scrutiny that 
will assure transparency and make 
sure this program serves the needs it 
was intended to. 
The only people who feel threatened 
by that kind of oversight are the ones 
who are trying to game the system or 
hide something. The rest of us, which 
means the workers, their families, and 
small businesses, demand oversight. 
This bill is a good way to begin. It is a 
start, not a finish, to the task of the 
oversight ahead of us. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Iowa. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
when it comes to the virus pandemic 
that faces the world, the World Health 
Organization is not serving its member 
nations the way it should. The World 
Health Organization’s mission is to 
promote worldwide health, to reduce 
the burdens of disease and poverty, and 
to provide access to healthcare, espe-
cially for the world’s most vulnerable 
populations. The World Health Organi-
zation states as its guiding principle 
that all people should enjoy the high-
est standard of health regardless of 
race, religion, economics, social condi-
tion, or political belief. It serves pri-
marily as a coordinating body to share 
information and best practices by con-
necting experts in different countries. 
The virus that emerged in Wuhan, 
China, which has caused the disease 
now known as COVID–19, has had a dev-
astating impact on the health of people 
worldwide as well as the global econ-
omy. Nations, including the United 
States, have been scrambling to deal 
with the impact of the virus since the 
beginning of the year. Without a doubt, 
worldwide efforts to combat COVID–19 
would have been greatly benefited from 
independent, unbiased, and informative 
data from the world’s leader in health, 
the World Health Organization. Unfor-
tunately, information coming from 
this organization since the beginning 
of the year has left much to be desired 
in its often providing information that 
we know now to be inaccurate or at 
least incomplete. The American people 
and the citizens of every country—all 
of whom rely on direct and truthful in-
formation—deserve better from Dr. 
Tedros and his team who lead the 
World Health Organization. 
China, which is where the current 
crisis began, has not done its part ei-
ther in its seeking of or in providing 
that very crucial information that, had

it come out sooner, would have saved 
many lives. As an example of China’s 
not cooperating, a doctor in Wuhan, 
China, by the name of Dr. Li Wenliang, 
raised concerns about the growing pan-
demic in early January. Dr. Li tried to 
blow the whistle on the spread of one of 
the world’s deadliest diseases. Do you 
know what he got for doing that? He 
was punished by the Communist Chi-
nese Government for ‘‘spreading ru-
mors.’’ 
Tragically, Dr. Li passed away in 
early February due to this virus, 
COVID–19. After the death of Dr. Li, he 
actually became a rallying point for 
Chinese citizens who were very upset 
about their government’s coverup of 
this virus. Only then, after he died and 
after the public outroar, did the Chi-
nese Government apologize to his fam-
ily and posthumously drop Dr. Li’s rep-
rimand. Throughout this time, the 
World 
Health 
Organization 
dem-
onstrated no interest in the accurate 
and verifiable information on the true 
dangers of this virus. 
We now know that, in late December 
2019, Taiwanese officials sounded the 
alarm directly to the World Health Or-
ganization about the human-to-human 
transmission of the virus. Prior to 
that, it was only thought there was an 
animal-to-human 
transmission, 
but 
Taiwanese officials blew the whistle. 
The Taiwan Centers for Disease Con-
trol sent an email to the World Health 
Organization—an email that has now 
been forwarded to my office and has 
been widely reported. It warned of ‘‘at 
least seven atypical pneumonia cases 
in Wuhan, China.’’ Additionally, this 
email communication noted that those 
individuals had been isolated for treat-
ment, which we now know is said to be 
the standard operating procedure for 
preventing 
human-to-human 
trans-
mission, but still, at that time, it was 
considered to be animal to human. 
Taken together, this information 
should have been very much a red flag 
to the World Health Organization’s 
leadership that the virus was capable 
of 
having 
human-to-human 
trans-
mission. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
World 
Health Organization chose to ignore 
these warnings and, thus, failed to pass 
on this critical information to other 
countries. Instead, what did the World 
Health 
Organization 
do? 
It 
was 
complicit in the Chinese Government’s 
coverup. It stated the opposite—that 
there was not human-to-human trans-
mission. In fact, the World Health Or-
ganization 
even 
retweeted 
Chinese 
propaganda on January 14—that there 
was ‘‘no clear evidence of human-to- 
human transmission,’’ which is con-
trary to the information that the 
World Health Organization got from 
the Taiwanese. 
It ought to be very clear that mis-
leading the public like this is simply 
egregious. By sidelining Taiwan’s par-
ticipation, which has one of the lowest 
known COVID–19 infection rates per 
capita, despite its proximity to Main-
land China, the World Health Organiza-
tion stymied information about a more 
effective response to the pandemic. It 
was during these critical days back in 
January when the spread of the virus 
could have been greatly slowed or even 
contained and could have saved a lot of 
lives. 
The 
World 
Health 
Organization’s 
mandate is to coordinate responses and 
facilitate information sharing to all of 
its members on a health emergency— 
members which include probably al-
most every country on this globe. This 
gross mishandling of the organization’s 
most important mandate has cost 
countless lives around the world. 
While China covered up the extent of 
the virus’s spread, the World Health 
Organization continued to praise China 
for its so-called proactive response and 
transparency. General Secretary Xi 
waited a crucial 6 days, until January 
20, before announcing the findings by 
China’s National Health Commission 
about the danger of the widespread 
human-to-human 
coronavirus 
con-
tagion. Now, just think for a while of 
the time lost between Taiwan’s warn-
ing to the World Health Organization 
in late December 2019 and General Sec-
retary Xi’s admitting on January 20 of 
its 
human-to-human 
transmission. 
That time lost could have saved the 
whole world thousands of lives because 
they could have been on top of the situ-
ation as to how bad it was, which was 
much more than anybody knew at that 
particular time. 
General Secretary Xi’s government 
also delayed an access request for the 
World Health Organization’s experts to 
visit affected regions at the end of Jan-
uary by almost 2 weeks—another 2 
weeks lost. He has also continually fed 
disinformation to foreign citizens via 
several misleading tweets by his for-
eign ministry and multiple unfounded 
claims that have been posted on state- 
run media websites. 
Despite this and also other evidence 
that China actively silenced whistle-
blowers and doctors domestically and 
that the Communist Party’s officials 
were aware of the spread well before re-
porting it, the World Health Organiza-
tion’s officials continued to praise Chi-
na’s response and transparency. The 
World 
Health 
Organization 
lauded 
China for releasing the virus’s genome 
in mid-January while it neglected to 
mention that it took China at least 14 
days to do this even as the virus con-
tinued to spread across Europe and 
reach America. 
Dr. Tedros said in early February 
that there was no need for measures 
that 
unnecessarily 
interfered 
with 
international travel and trade in try-
ing 
to 
halt 
the 
spread 
of 
that 
coronavirus. Now, early February was 
a few days after President Trump 
stopped travel from China except for 
American citizens who were coming 
home. Yet, during that period of time, 
Dr. Tedros thought it was unnecessary 
to interfere with international travel. 
Time and again, the World Health Or-
ganization endorsed and also repeated 
Chinese Government talking points, 
and it did it all to the rest of the 
world’s detriment. We now know that 
there was a continued flow of misin-
formation that came from the Chinese 
Government since the onset of the pan-
demic with there being little to no 
pushback from the World Health Orga-
nization as to whether that informa-
tion was accurate. 
In mid-February, officials from the 
World Health Organization—yet again, 
uncritically—parroted Chinese Govern-
ment propaganda by stating that there 
were signs that confirmed and sus-
pected cases of COVID–19 had declined 
in China. The U.S. intelligence commu-
nity has, in fact, asserted that China 
misrepresented both the number of 
cases and its death toll from the virus, 
concealing the real extent of the out-
break in its country, and that China 
intentionally hid or even destroyed 
evidence of the virus’ outbreak. 
In a dossier that was leaked to the 
Australian Daily Telegraph, it is al-
leged that China began censoring infor-
mation as early as December 31, 2019— 
precisely when Taiwan, in its caring 
about the whole world as it knew what 
might be going on, was sounding that 
alarm to the World Health Organiza-
tion. 
Previously, Chinese leaders came 
under incredible scrutiny by the World 
Health Organization back in 2003 for 
the SARS outbreak. China was not 
transparent with SARS, just like they 
weren’t transparent until too late in 
regard to this virus pandemic that we 
are fighting today. Back then, the Chi-
nese Government made sure that infor-
mation regarding the outbreak was not 
made public. At that point, the World 
Health Organization did what they are 
responsible for doing: They publicly 
reprimanded China back in 2003 on the 
SARS outbreak. Chinese leaders then 
quickly fell in line with the rest of the 
world in sharing its data with the 
World Health Organization member 
countries. If the World Health Organi-
zation had been doing its job on this 
pandemic, then maybe China would 
have been quicker admitting that its 
spread was human-to-human and how 
bad it was even in their own country. 
However, we are seeing a very dif-
ferent approach now to the organiza-
tion’s handling of China’s information 
suppression campaign, with the World 
Health 
Organization 
often 
praising 
China for its information sharing, but 
make no mistake, China has been noth-
ing but deceptive in its handling of 
COVID–19. 
We must remember that China has a 
long history of not being transparent 
with respect to the outbreaks of vi-
ruses, and there is little to no evidence 
suggesting we should start believing 
China now—meaning, of course, the 
Chinese Communist leaders. Nobody in 
this world is going to hold the Chinese 
people responsible for this. 
Global leaders are now coming to re-
alize that China is responsible for this 
pandemic, 
with 
global 
sentiment

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2237 
May 5, 2020 
against the Chinese Communist Party 
at its highest since the 1999 Tiananmen 
Square crackdown. 
It is important that world leaders, 
including President Trump, keep pres-
sure on China to finally be transparent 
with its data so we can join together in 
combating this deadly disease. We have 
a report from the Department of Home-
land Security that says that China ‘‘in-
tentionally concealed the severity’’ of 
the pandemic from the world. To make 
matters 
worse, 
the 
report 
further 
states that while China continues to 
downplay the pandemic, it began to in-
crease imports and decrease exports of 
medical supplies. This report from the 
Department of Homeland Security sug-
gests that China was beginning to 
hoard these medical supplies from the 
rest of the world. So they knew how 
bad this was in their own country. Sec-
retary Pompeo recently stated that 
there is a significant amount of evi-
dence that this virus came from the 
laboratory in Wuhan, China, contrary 
to what Chinese Communist Party 
propagandists 
have 
been 
pushing 
throughout the world. 
On April 9, I wrote to the World 
Health Organization seeking answers 
to several questions regarding the or-
ganization’s handling of COVID–19. I 
wanted to know what the World Health 
Organization knew and when they 
knew it. I asked that my questions be 
answered no later than May 1. Much to 
my dismay, the World Health Organiza-
tion has refused to answer my ques-
tions about its handling of the virus. It 
would seem that the organization is 
much more focused on covering for 
China than it is in answering questions 
that every single American has a right 
to know. 
Not only does the United States have 
the right to know this information for 
the benefit of the world, because trans-
parency brings accountability, but be-
cause we give about $400 million a year 
to support the World Health Organiza-
tion. I believe we are the largest con-
tributor to it, and I believe China gives 
about 10 percent of what the U.S. tax-
payers put in. I want to state that I 
will continue to push the World Health 
Organization for answers. There are 
probably a lot more questions that 
ought to be asked in addition to the 
questions in my letter. 
Ultimately, the primary responsi-
bility for this pandemic lies with the 
Chinese Communist Government au-
thorities who actively concealed the 
outbreak since the fall of 2019 and sup-
pressed the spread of accurate informa-
tion about the virus, but the World 
Health Organization also bears respon-
sibility for aiding and abetting the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s coverup. That 
is why I support a full congressional in-
vestigation into how the World Health 
Organization has bowed to Chinese 
pressure with the COVID–19 outbreak. 
The leaders of the World Health Orga-
nization need to be held accountable 
for their role in promoting misinforma-
tion and helping China cover up this 
global pandemic. Americans deserve to 
know what the World Health Organiza-
tion leaders knew and when they knew 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Wyo-
ming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today as the Senate 
returns to help the country recover 
from coronavirus. This global pan-
demic is hopefully a once-in-a-lifetime, 
once-in-a-century shock, but it has 
been an earthquake that continues to 
shake the world to its core. Tragically, 
we have lost tens of thousands of 
Americans to the disease, and our 
hearts and prayers go out to each of 
those impacted and all of their loved 
ones. 
More than 30 million Americans have 
lost their jobs in the last 6 weeks due 
to the virus and the State lockdowns 
that have been put in place as a result 
of the virus. People want and need to 
get back to work as soon as possible. It 
is vital we reopen America smartly and 
safely and we do it as soon as we can. 
Many States are starting to open. 
Wyoming did this past Friday. We 
must all be prepared and alert for any 
likely aftershocks that will occur from 
the virus. 
The economy could not reopen had it 
not 
been 
for 
the 
major 
medical 
progress we have been experiencing. 
Our heroic nurses, doctors, and others 
on the frontlines have saved many 
lives. Testing in the United States has 
been dramatically expanded, and we 
are producing promising treatments. 
The American people deserve a lot of 
credit for their tremendous sacrifices 
to contain the spread of the virus. Ev-
eryone in my home State of Wyoming 
is suffering from the economic fallout, 
as are Americans all across the coun-
try. The best way to help these people 
is to push the start button on the econ-
omy. 
The Senate is in session and will con-
sider taking targeted temporary and 
bipartisan relief measures. We are now 
assessing the relief money that has al-
ready been spent. We know what has 
worked—the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram funds that go to mom-and-pop or-
ganizations that are part of the CARES 
Act has saved 30 million jobs. Small 
business is the backbone of our econ-
omy, the engine of job creation. In Wy-
oming, the program has been very suc-
cessful and very popular. Before the 
pandemic, the United States had record 
job growth and record low unemploy-
ment. Our economy will bounce back, 
there is no question in my mind. 
As we look to the future, in terms of 
recovery legislation, what we need to 
do is to prevent a second epidemic. I 
am very concerned that the second epi-
demic 
will 
be 
that 
of 
frivolous 
coronavirus lawsuits. Any future legis-
lation must focus on the virus and 
must include reasonable liability pro-
tections for the hard-hit healthcare 
workers and for American employers. 
Opportunistic lawyers are already ad-
vertising, and they are targeting the 
healthcare workers and small busi-
nesses that we have assisted during the 
crisis. Ironically, the relief money 
could end up lining the pockets of 
greedy trial lawyers. 
As businesses bravely begin to re-
open, class action lawsuits are being 
planned nationwide. Ambulance chas-
ers are running recruitment ads right 
now 
that 
read 
‘‘receive 
a 
free 
coronavirus lawsuit review.’’ They go 
on to say: Call if you or a loved one has 
been diagnosed with COVID–19 and you 
believe 
another 
party’s 
negligence 
caused the exposure. 
Nursing homes appear to be the 
prime target. One lawyer who described 
himself as a ‘‘coronavirus exposure 
lawyer’’ encouraged action for nursing 
home negligence. That is why nurses, 
doctors, and hospitals are counting on 
Congress to pass commonsense liability 
reform. 
Yet Speaker PELOSI
and Senator 
SCHUMER say they oppose this critical 
liability protection. Instead, Demo-
crats are demanding more aid for 
States and local governments. They 
want American taxpayers to bail out 
States with long histories of financial 
mismanagement. That is already on 
top of the $150 billion that the States 
have just received within the last 2 
weeks. NANCY PELOSI now wants a lot, 
lot more. 
We put the full force of the American 
Government in this fight against the 
coronavirus. We cannot afford to allow 
an avalanche of abusive lawsuits to 
crush our awakening economy. Repub-
licans will insist on a legal shield for 
essential workers and for businesses 
before spending another dime. It is our 
job to do everything that we can to get 
people back to work and back to work 
safely. 
The physical and economic health of 
our country is at stake today. We are 
continuing to deliver financial support 
plus medical help to all people across 
the country. One thing is clear: trial 
lawyers should not profit from our Na-
tion’s pain. Together, America will 
come back and Americans will come 
back and it will be stronger and better 
than ever. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
we are here in the U.S. Senate on this 
Tuesday. We had a vote yesterday 
evening, the first that we have had in 
some 6 weeks here. As I walked over to 
the Chamber just now from the Hart 
Building, at 4 o’clock on a Tuesday 
afternoon, the only individuals whom I 
saw were the extraordinary men and

women of the Capitol Police here in the 
building. 
Suffice it to say, these are strange, 
unusual, 
challenging, 
and 
difficult 
times as we face the COVID–19 pan-
demic and as we address the challenges 
that our constituents, our friends, and 
our families are dealing with at home, 
whether it be the impact of the virus 
itself on our health and our health fa-
cilities or whether it be the impact— 
truly, the economic devastation—that 
we are seeing in all corners of the Na-
tion. 
So the opportunity to be together as 
a body to address these challenges is 
important. It is challenging for us as 
we adapt to this time and this situa-
tion of wearing protective masks, of 
being separated from one another, of 
teleworking as we are. We are adapt-
ing. We are facing that challenge. We 
rightly must be doing this because, as 
the Nation deals with these matters re-
lated to the COVID–19, there are other 
matters that are taking place every 
day—issues that need to be addressed, 
problems that must be tackled, and 
matters of governance that we must be 
engaged in. 
NATIONAL DAY OF AWARENESS FOR MISSING AND 
MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS 
Madam President, I woke up this 
morning and looked at my little news 
caps with which to focus on the day, 
this Tuesday, and they noted that 
today is Teacher Appreciation Day. We 
thank all of our teachers. Our teachers 
are certainly in an unusual situation 
now, as all of our students are. It is 
also Cinco de Mayo. It is also Giving 
Tuesday. 
For 
many, 
it 
feels 
like 
Groundhog Day every day because of, 
again, this strange time in which we 
are living. For so many, it just seems 
that every day is more and more of the 
same. 
Today, May 5, is also a day that we 
have recognized for several years now 
as being the National Day of Aware-
ness for Missing and Murdered Indige-
nous Women and Girls. It is a matter 
that I would like to speak briefly to 
this afternoon. I recognize the devasta-
tion that so many families have seen 
when it comes to those they love who 
have gone missing or who have been 
found murdered, and I recognize the 
dark reality that many, we know, are 
still missing. 
Unfortunately, for far too long, there 
has been silence on this issue. There 
has been a failure to act in the face of 
what we know and sometimes in the 
not knowing of what we are dealing 
with because we haven’t asked the 
questions, which is equally problem-
atic. It tears at my heart to hear the 
stories of those whom I have come in 
contact with in Alaska—a woman’s 
story, a family’s story—in that their 
words have been discounted. They have 
been dismissed because the woman who 
went missing or the woman who was 
murdered 
was 
a 
Native 
American 
woman. 
We have to change that. We cannot 
accept that. We cannot let the statis-
tics that have really just been allowed 
to accumulate for too long to remain 
as statistics. Every single one of these 
women was her own person, each story 
her own life story, each a member of 
her community. In addition to their 
being someone’s lost daughters, wives, 
mothers, sisters, we should mourn the 
promise that these missing and mur-
dered women meant to our commu-
nities—their being the next genera-
tions of mentors, role models, and 
changemakers. 
When women are murdered or ab-
ducted, when women are trafficked— 
when individuals are left missing, dis-
carded, or discounted—there is an in-
justice that is being done, and we can-
not let that continue. By raising 
awareness of the epidemic, by giving 
these women their faces, their names, 
and by telling their stories, we are 
shining a light on a problem, and we 
are giving hope. 
I acknowledge the work of a former 
colleague of mine here in the Senate, 
Senator Heidi Heitkamp, who came to 
this floor often as a strong, strong ad-
vocate for those Native women who 
have been dismissed and discounted. 
She shared pictures, gave names, and 
went beyond the statistics. She re-
minded me—encouraged me—that this 
is an effort that, together, we must ad-
dress. 
Unfortunately, we all have the sto-
ries—the stories that sicken you and 
just literally break your heart. The one 
that, perhaps, touches me most imme-
diately and directly is the life of Ash-
ley Johnson Barr. She was a beautiful 
10-year-old girl who was taken from 
the children’s playground in her home-
town of Kotzebue, AK, which is a Na-
tive village on the northwest coast. 
She was brutally raped and murdered. 
Again, she was taken from the kids’ 
playground to just outside her town. 
Her death and the tragedy around the 
circumstances of how she left the world 
are still open. It is still raw and has 
left a permanent scar on Alaskan com-
munities. 
What happened to Ashley is a re-
minder that, in my State, unfortu-
nately, there is a darkness that is still, 
to this day, very, very hard to talk 
about, but we must. We have to talk 
about it. We have to act on it. We can-
not turn a blind eye simply because it 
is difficult to talk about. We have to 
because we are seeing the stories that 
represent these statistics in unprece-
dented proportions. Let me give you 
some numbers to just put that into 
perspective. 
Alaska Native women are 21⁄2 times 
more likely to be victims of domestic 
violence. In Tribal villages and Native 
communities, domestic violence rates 
are up to 10 times higher than in the 
rest of the Nation. In 2015, it was esti-
mated that 40 percent of sex-traf-
ficking victims were Native Ameri-
cans. Almost 40 percent of those who 
have been trafficked have been Native 
Americans. The rate of sexual violence 
victimization among Alaska’s Native 
women is at least seven times greater 
than of non-Native females. 
Again, I will just say these are un-
precedented proportions. So, when we 
designate a day as a day of awareness— 
an awareness of those who have gone 
missing and who have been murdered 
as being indigenous women and girls— 
it has to be about more than aware-
ness. It has to be about action. This is 
where Senator CORTEZ MASTO and I 
have picked up on this work. She and I 
have worked together on several pieces 
of legislation that have helped to pave 
the way for greater collaboration and 
data collection between Federal agen-
cies—our law enforcement and elected 
Tribal officials—to not only under-
stand the extent of the issues but to 
develop methods with which to end 
these horrible crimes. 
There are two bills. The first one is 
Savanna’s Act. It combats the epi-
demic of murdered and missing Native 
women and girls by improving the Fed-
eral Government’s response in address-
ing the crisis. We do this through the 
coordination among all levels of law 
enforcement by increasing data collec-
tion and information sharing and by 
empowering Tribal governments with 
the resources they need in the cases in-
volving missing or murdered indige-
nous women and girls wherever they 
may occur. 
The second piece of legislation is 
called the Not Invisible Act. It is aimed 
at addressing the crisis of missing, 
murdered, 
and 
trafficked 
Native 
women by engaging law enforcement, 
Tribal leaders, Federal partners, and 
service providers and by improving the 
coordination across the Federal agen-
cies. The more we have reviewed this, 
we have learned that so much of the 
data is lacking. We have gaps. We just 
haven’t been able to get the data that 
we need in order to do a better job of 
coordinating with our agencies. 
The good news from all of this is that 
both of these bills have passed this 
body, and I thank my colleagues here 
in the Senate for their support of the 
measures. We advanced them unani-
mously on March 11, which was just a 
little while before we left to deal with 
the COVID pandemic. I truly want to 
thank 
the 
Senate 
for 
helping 
to 
prioritize these measures to protect in-
digenous women. 
In addition to these measures that 
we have passed in the Senate, we have 
done more on the appropriations side. 
We have worked through the commit-
tees, and for the first time in the ap-
propriations bill that President Trump 
signed in December, there was funding 
specifically directed to address the cri-
sis of missing, murdered, and traf-
ficked indigenous women—$6.5 million 
included for the BIA to take a really 
comprehensive look at the issue across 
BIA and IHS, the Indian Health Serv-
ice. 
It covers everything for the funding 
of cold casework, background checks, 
equipment needs, training, and a direc-
tive to the IHS with regard to forensic

training. It also includes language that 
does more for the coordination and 
data collection amongst Tribal, local, 
State, and Federal law enforcement. So 
that is significant. The Executive order 
that was issued by the Trump adminis-
tration late last year was very impor-
tant in this effort. 
I personally acknowledge the good 
work that Tara Sweeney has done, the 
Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs. 
She has pulled together the agency co-
ordination to respond to these cases. 
She has shown extraordinary heart— 
real heart—in responding to the calls 
from Tribes and advocates to address 
the crisis of missing and murdered Na-
tive women. So there has been so much 
at play that has come together. 
What we need now is for the House to 
act on these legislative measures that 
we have moved through the Senate so 
that the President can sign them into 
law. 
I think we recognize that as we are 
dealing with these matters that are di-
rectly related to the day-to-day re-
sponse to COVID, as we have seen our 
economies slowed, as we have moved 
indoors to telework, the work that is 
required for us to help protect the most 
vulnerable among us continues. We 
know that work continues. 
As we have worked aggressively 
across the country and in Alaskan 
communities to flatten the curve out 
there as it relates to the coronavirus, 
we know, unfortunately, that we have 
seen an uptick in domestic violence. 
Unfortunately, and truly sadly for so 
many, the order to shelter in place— 
‘‘safer at home’’ is the terminology 
used in some communities, and safer at 
home doesn’t necessarily mean safe at 
home for far too many. Shelter in place 
is not a safe shelter. We are seeing in-
creased calls to police departments 
during this time, but, interestingly 
enough, we are not seeing an increase 
in those who are seeking help or shel-
ter in our women’s shelters. 
It was just a couple of weeks ago that 
I had a phone call with representatives 
from the various women’s shelters 
around my State, with probably a 
dozen or so women on the line, and I 
asked specifically: How are we doing in 
the shelters? What are we seeing? Their 
numbers are down, and if you look at it 
from just a numbers perspective, you 
would say ‘‘Good.’’ But we know that 
domestic violence doesn’t disappear or 
go away at times like the ones we are 
facing now; it just goes underground. I 
think what we are seeing is that con-
cern and fear. As difficult as the situa-
tion may be at home, it might be more 
frightening to go to a shelter where 
one may be exposed to this invisible 
threat of the virus. 
I wish I could say that, as a con-
sequence of what we are seeing, our 
shelters are better off, but I fear that 
those who would seek shelter are not 
better off. So to make sure we are pre-
pared to address these needs is yet an-
other challenge for us in this body: to 
come together to address these issues 
that we know are with us—not only the 
levels of domestic violence but the im-
pact that we know is present when it 
comes to mental and behavioral health, 
when people are fragile and yet are 
afraid to seek help because of the expo-
sure to something else. We have work 
to do in this area, and that is some-
thing I intend to focus on in the days 
and weeks ahead. 
I was encouraged to hear my friend, 
the Senator from Texas, Mr. CORNYN, 
speaking to just these issues yesterday 
on the floor. We have much to do. 
These are challenging times on many 
different levels. 
As we recognize this day of aware-
ness for those who have gone missing— 
for those women and girls who have 
been murdered—know that this is more 
than just raising awareness. It is up to 
us. We owe it to them, their families, 
and their loved ones to act as well. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING 
NORTH 
DAKOTA’S 
DELEGATES 
TO 
THE 
SENATE 
YOUTH PROGRAM 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, one of 
the outstanding programs offered in 
the U.S. Senate recognizes the best of 
America’s high school juniors and sen-
iors. Since 1963, the U.S. Senate Youth 
Program has selected two students 
from each State who rank high aca-
demically, excel in leadership and vol-
unteerism, and have a passion for pub-
lic service. They also receive a $10,000 
college scholarship. 
These young delegates have come to 
Washington, DC, every spring for a 
week of education and tours high-
lighting all three branches of govern-
ment. Unfortunately, like so many 
other programs and events, this year’s 
trip to Washington was cancelled as 
our 
Nation 
faces 
the 
coronavirus 
threat. This is only the second time in 
the program’s nearly 60 years that the 
delegates have not gathered in Wash-
ington for this memorable week. 
As one of the eight Senators serving 
on the Senate Youth Program’s Advi-
sory Committee, I want to congratu-
late all who were selected to be dele-
gates this year and assure them we 
share their disappointment they could 
not be with us this month. I also want 
to recognize North Dakota’s two dele-
gates, Megha Bharadwaj and Rachel 
Goven. 
Megha is a junior at St. Mary’s Cen-
tral High School in Bismarck. Her 
leadership positions include being the 
State treasurer for the North Dakota 
Future Business Leaders of America 
and a board member and publicity di-
rector for AchieveWE. Megha has re-
ceived top honors participating in 
school, district, and State competi-
tions in Voices of Democracy, debate,

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 557—RECOG-
NIZING THE CULTURAL AND HIS-
TORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 
CINCO DE MAYO HOLIDAY 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
CORNYN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 557 
Whereas May 5, or ‘‘Cinco de Mayo’’ in 
Spanish, is celebrated each year as a date of 
importance by Mexican and Mexican-Amer-
ican communities; 
Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday com-
memorates May 5, 1862, the date on which 
Mexicans defeated the French at the Battle 
of Puebla, one of the many battles that the 
Mexican people won in their long and brave 
fight for independence, freedom, and democ-
racy; 
Whereas the victory of Mexico over France 
at Puebla represented a historic triumph for 
the Mexican government during the Franco- 
Mexican war fought between 1861 and 1867 
and bolstered the resistance movement; 
Whereas the success of Mexico at the Bat-
tle of Puebla reinvigorated the spirits of the 
Mexican people and provided a renewed sense 
of unity and strength; 
Whereas the French army, which had not 
experienced defeat against any of the finest 
troops of Europe in more than half a cen-
tury, sustained a disastrous loss at the hands 
of an outnumbered and ill-equipped, but 
highly spirited and courageous, Mexican 
army; 
Whereas the courageous spirit that Mexi-
can General Ignacio Zaragoza and his men 
displayed during that historic battle can 
never be forgotten; 
Whereas, in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo 
symbolizes the right of a free people to self- 
determination, just as Benito Juarez, the 
president of Mexico during the Battle of 
Puebla, once said, ‘‘El respeto al derecho 
ajeno es la paz’’, meaning ‘‘respect for the 
rights of others is peace’’; 
Whereas the sacrifice of Mexican fighters 
was instrumental in keeping Mexico from 
falling under European domination while, in 
the United States, the Union Army battled 
Confederate forces in the Civil War; 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a re-
minder that the foundation of the United 
States was built by people from many coun-
tries and diverse cultures who were willing 
to fight and die for freedom; 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a re-
minder of the close ties between the people 
of Mexico and the people of the United 
States; 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo encourages the 
celebration of a legacy of strong leaders and 
a sense of vibrancy in communities; and 
Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a re-
minder to provide more opportunity for fu-
ture generations: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the historic struggle of the 
people of Mexico for independence and free-
dom, which Cinco de Mayo commemorates; 
and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe Cinco de Mayo with appro-
priate ceremonies and activities.

SENATE RESOLUTION 558—RECOG-
NIZING APRIL 30, 2020, AS ‘‘EL 
DIA 
DE 
LOS 
NINOS–CELE-
BRATING YOUNG AMERICANS’’ 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
CRAPO) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 558 
Whereas, each year in the United States, 
El Dı´a de los Nin˜ os–Celebrating Young 
Americans is recognized as a day to affirm 
and recognize the importance of young chil-
dren and adolescents in the United States; 
Whereas children and adolescents rep-
resent the hopes and dreams of the people of 
the United States, and the well-being of chil-
dren and adolescents is emphasized as a top 
priority in the United States; 
Whereas, according to data of the Bureau 
of the Census, the Hispanic population in the 
United States is the youngest major racial 
or ethnic group in the United States, as— 
(1) more than 18,100,000 Hispanics in the 
United States, a group that represents near-
ly 
1⁄3
of the Hispanic population in the 
United States, are younger than 18 years of 
age; and 
(2) in 2017, more than 15,600,000 Hispanics in 
the United States, a group that represents 
more than 1⁄4 of the Hispanic population in 
the United States, were individuals between 
18 and 34 years of age (commonly referred to 
as ‘‘millennials’’); 
Whereas the Hispanic population in the 
United States continues to grow and is a sig-
nificant part of the workforce in the United 
States, and children in that population will 
be consumers, taxpayers, and voters in the 
future; 
Whereas, as the United States becomes 
more culturally and ethnically diverse, the 
people of the United States must strive to 
bring about cultural understanding and cele-
brate a tradition that honors all children 
and adolescents on El Dı´a de los Nin˜ os–Cele-
brating Young Americans, a day that ac-
knowledges and shares traditions and cus-
toms with all people in the United States; 
Whereas parents are at the center of teach-
ing children about family values, morality, 
life preparation, health, survival, and cul-
ture; 
Whereas the designation of a day of special 
recognition to honor children and adoles-
cents in the United States— 
(1) will help affirm the significance of fam-
ily, 
education, 
health, 
and 
community 
among the people of the United States; and 
(2) will provide an opportunity for those 
children and adolescents to reflect on their 
futures, to articulate their aspirations, to 
find comfort and security in the support of 
their family members, communities, and

United States; 
Whereas the National Latino Children’s In-
stitute, which serves as an advocate and a 
voice for young Latino children— 
(1) will celebrate its 22nd anniversary in 
2020; 
(2) has partnered with States and cities

Whereas April 30, 2020, would be an appro-
priate day to recognize as ‘‘El Dı´a de los 
Nin˜ os–Celebrating Young Americans’’: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes April 30, 2020, as ‘‘El Dı´a de 
los Nin˜ os–Celebrating Young Americans’’; 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States— 
(A) to nurture and invest in children and 
adolescents in order to preserve and enhance 
economic prosperity, democracy, and the 
free and open exchange of ideas, which are 
concepts that are essential to the spirit of 
the United States; and 
(B) to celebrate the gifts of children and 
adolescents and to help them take their

the United States to observe El Dı´a de los

(A) center on children and are free or of

pation by all people; 
(B) uplift and help children positively envi-
sion a path to their futures by allowing chil-
dren to voice their hopes and dreams;

RESOLUTION 
559—HON-
ORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
AND

Ms. CORTEZ MASTO, Ms. DUCKWORTH, 
Mr. DURBIN, Ms. HARRIS, Mr. HEINRICH, 
Ms. HIRONO, and Ms. KLOBUCHAR) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 559 
Whereas Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez was born on 
March 31, 1927, near Yuma, Arizona; 
Whereas Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez spent his 
early years on a family farm; 
Whereas, at the age of 10, Ce´sar Estrada 
Cha´vez joined the thousands of migrant farm 
workers laboring in fields and vineyards 
throughout the Southwest after a bank fore-
closure resulted in the loss of the family 
farm; 
Whereas Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez, after at-
tending more than 30 elementary and middle 
schools and achieving an eighth grade edu-
cation, left school to work full-time as a 
farm worker to help support his family; 
Whereas, at the age of 17, Ce´sar Estrada 
Cha´vez entered the United States Navy and 
served the United States with distinction for 
2 years; 
Whereas, in 1948, Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez re-
turned from military service to marry Helen 
Fabela, whom he had met while working in 
the vineyards of central California; 
Whereas Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez and Helen 
Fabela had 8 children; 
Whereas, as early as 1949, Ce´sar Estrada 
Cha´vez was committed to organizing farm 
workers to campaign for safe and fair work-
ing conditions, reasonable wages, livable 
housing, and the outlawing of child labor; 
Whereas, in 1952, Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez 
joined the Community Service Organization, 
a prominent Latino civil rights group, and

voter registration drives and conduct cam-
paigns against discrimination in East Los 
Angeles; 
Whereas Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez served as 
the national director of the Community 
Service Organization;

tablish the National Farm Workers Associa-
tion, which eventually became the United

Whereas, under the leadership of Ce´sar 
Estrada Cha´vez, the United Farm Workers of 
America organized thousands of migrant 
farm workers to fight for fair wages, health 
care coverage, pension benefits, livable hous-
ing, and respect; 
Whereas Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez was a 
strong believer in the principles of non-
violence practiced by Mahatma Gandhi and 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; 
Whereas Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez effectively 
used peaceful tactics that included fasting 
for 25 days in 1968, 25 days in 1972, and 38 days 
in 1988 to call attention to the terrible work-
ing and living conditions of farm workers in 
the United States; 
Whereas, through his commitment to non-
violence, Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez brought dig-
nity and respect to the organized farm work-
ers and became an inspiration to and a re-
source for individuals engaged in human 
rights struggles throughout the world; 
Whereas the influence of Ce´sar Estrada 
Cha´vez extends far beyond agriculture and 
provides inspiration for individuals working 
to better human rights, empower workers, 
and advance the American Dream, which in-
cludes all individuals of the United States; 
Whereas Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez died on 
April 23, 1993, at the age of 66 in San Luis, 
Arizona, only miles from his birthplace; 
Whereas more than 50,000 people attended 
the funeral services of Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez 
in Delano, California;

Whereas, since the death of Ce´sar Estrada 
Cha´vez, schools, parks, streets, libraries, and

Whereas more than 10 States and dozens of 
communities across the United States honor 
the life and legacy of Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez 
each year on March 31; 
Whereas March 31 is recognized as an offi-
cial State holiday in California, Colorado, 
and Texas, and there is growing support to 
designate the birthday of Ce´sar Estrada 
Cha´vez as a national day of service to memo-
rialize his heroism; 
Whereas, during his lifetime, Ce´sar Estrada 
Cha´vez was a recipient of the Martin Luther 
King Jr. Peace Prize; 
Whereas, on August 8, 1994, Ce´sar Estrada 
Cha´vez was posthumously awarded the Presi-
dential Medal of Freedom; 
Whereas, on October 8, 2012, President 
Barack Obama authorized the Secretary of 
the Interior to establish a Ce´sar Estrada 
Cha´vez National Monument in Keene, Cali-
fornia; 
Whereas President Barack Obama was the 
last President to honor the life and service of 
Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez by proclaiming March 
31, 2016, to be ‘‘Ce´sar Cha´vez Day’’ and by 
asking all people of the United States to ob-
serve March 31 with service, community, and 
education programs to honor the enduring 
legacy of Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez; and 
Whereas the United States should continue 
the efforts of Ce´sar Estrada Cha´vez to ensure 
equality, justice, and dignity for all people

IN MEMORY OF AARON SHEPLEY 
HON. SEAN CASTEN 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to remember the life of Aaron 
Shepley. The State of Illinois has lost one of 
its most capable and dedicated public serv-
ants with the tragic death of Crystal Lake’s 
longtime Mayor. In his long service to the 
community, as both mayor and city council 
member, a founding member of the drumline 
group the Crystal Lake Strikers, and dedicated 
husband and father, Aaron led with quiet hu-
mility, approachability, and selflessness. 
A resident of Crystal Lake since 1972, 
Aaron was passionate and unwavering in his 
advocacy for the city, and eager to work in a 
unifying and positive manner to assist its resi-
dents. In a time when politics more often di-
vides us, Aaron was most professionally proud 
of the congenial relationships among his fellow 
council members and the work of the Crystal 
Lake city staff. He leaves a beautiful legacy of 
highly competent and unselfish public service 
that should inspire us all. 
In addition to his civic work, Aaron was also 
a drummer dedicated to supporting aspiring 
musicians. After learning to play drums for his 
40th birthday, Aaron and two friends started 
Strikers, a drum line for adult percussionists. 
In the decade since their founding, the Strikers 
have gained local and national notoriety, and 
created several educational programs to sup-
port the performing arts in the northwest sub-
urbs of Chicago. Aaron was the driving force 
behind the Strikers’ Evening of Percussion 
fundraising event, and in the 11 years of 
awarding scholarships, the Strikers have pro-
vided over $50,000 to local students. 
Aaron Shepley was a class act, and I am 
grateful to have known and learned from him. 
I extend my deepest sympathy to Aaron’s wife 
Regan and their daughters Chase and Madi-
son, and the people of Crystal Lake, for this 
tremendous loss.

TRIBUTE TO ROMEO WATKINS 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a faithful, civic-minded 
man and a dear friend, Romeo Watkins, the 
father of my long-time Chief of Staff Yelberton 
Watkins, transitioned from this life on April 30, 
2020. He will be sorely missed by all who 
knew him. 
Romeo Watkins was a native of the Ridge-
wood community of Columbia, South Carolina. 
He was the third of eight children born to the 
late Deacon Leroy and Beatrice Harris Wat-
kins. His was a close-knit family, with his ma-
ternal grandmother, Agnes Harris, living next 
door, She took Romeo and his siblings to her 
hometown of Bronson, Florida every summer, 
and played an important role in his upbringing. 
His maternal aunt, Mrs. Franklin Scott Harris, 
was very close to her nephew, and he spent 
many nights in her home across from the Gov-
ernor’s Mansion. 
Romeo 
attended 
Ridgeway 
Elementary 
School and Booker T. Washington High 
School in Columbia. At a young age, he 
learned the value of hard work. In the mid- 
1960s, he became a civilian employee at the 
Fort Jackson U.S. Army training base and 
continued to work there until his retirement in 
1993. 
He began barbering as a 10-year old, prac-
ticing on his older brother Charles, and later 
owned and operated a barber shop on North 
Main Street in Columbia for over 40 years. 
Ever the entrepreneur, he was also a success-
ful real estate agent. Known for his impec-
cable taste and style, he was always well 
dressed. 
Those fortunate to know Mr. Watkins knew 
of his deep Christian faith. He was a life-long 
member of Ridgewood Baptist Church, joining 
as a child. A third-generation member, he 
served for many years on the Church History 
Committee and was regarded as a historian of 
the Ridgewood community. While he served in 
many capacities, his greatest joy at church 
was his long tenure as Leader of the Jubilee 
Choir, a role which his father held before him. 
He was well known throughout the city for his 
expert knowledge of shape-note singing of 
common meter hymns. 
Mr. Watkins was also an avid golfer. It was 
on the golf course that we first met many 
years ago, and we bonded over our love of 
the sport. He learned to golf as a young caddy 
on Columbia’s segregated golf courses, and 
he enjoyed playing in golf tournaments across 
Columbia and throughout the state. He was an 
annual attendee of my Rudolph Canzater Me-
morial Classic held each year in Santee, 
South Carolina, and he also served as a Com-
missioner of the Eau Claire Youth Baseball 
League. 
Family was always at the center of his life. 
Left to cherish his memory are his wife of 58 
years, Annette Caughman Watkins, and their 
four children: Quintus (Verdell) Young, Brigitte 
Watkins Long, Yelberton Romeo Watkins; and 
Vancito Ethridge Watkins; nine grandchildren: 
Quintus, Justin, Velicia, Gabrielle, Danielle, 
Autumn, Alexi, Tori, and Ashlyn; three great- 
grandchildren: Jamari, Raleigh, and Solomon; 
and a host of relatives, nieces, nephews, 
MeadowLake neighbors, and close friends. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the life of 
Romeo Watkins. He was a man grounded in 
faith and family, and no one can leave a 
greater legacy. 
CONGRATULATING 
DALLAS 
KRUEGER 
FOR 
HIS 
WIN 
AT 
CLASS 1A STATE FINALS FOR 
WRESTLING AT THE IHSA STATE 
TOURNAMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Dallas Krueger, a senior from 
Rockridge High School, who won the Illinois 
High School Association’s Class 1A State 
Finals Wrestling Tournament in the 138 pound 
weigh class. 
At 138 pounds, Dallas pinned his opponent 
in four minutes and forty seconds to finish 47– 
0. As a former athlete, I appreciate the for-
titude Dallas displayed to achieve his dream of 
being a state champion and commend him for 
his efforts and attitude. Dallas is an example 
of the importance of dedication and a strong 
work ethic, and I am proud to see him rep-
resent Taylor Ridge so well throughout the 
state with his talent and passion. 
It is because of student leaders such as 
Dallas Krueger that I am especially proud to 
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally 
congratulate Dallas Krueger on his Class 1A 
State Finals title in Wrestling.

IN HONOR OF CHERISHED PUBLIC 
SERVANT, LETTER CARRIER MS. 
ANGELA SUMMERS—USPS 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of a cherished pub-
lic servant of the United States Postal Service 
(USPS), Ms. Angela Summers. 
Tragically, my congressional district, the 7th 
District of Indiana, recently lost Ms. Angela 
Summers, a Letter Carrier with the USPS, to 
gun violence while she was performing her du-
ties on April 28, 2020. Angela joined the Post-
al Service almost two years ago, and she 
quickly became a prized employee. Her 
friends remember her as ‘‘fun-loving and bub-
bly.’’ Her colleagues remember her as a public 
servant dedicated to customers, In turn her 
customers remember her not only as their Let-
ter Carrier—but also as their friend, neighbor, 
and member of the community. 
Postal workers are quite often the human 
face of government in our communities. They 
walk door-to-door in our neighborhoods, no 
matter the weather, earning the trust and con-
fidence of our citizens, just as our neighbors 
earn our trust. Their deliveries not only mean 
that a highly anticipated package has arrived 
at your doorstep. Their work also serves as a 
subtle reminder that the government, com-
posed of vast institutions, can still reach deep

into our communities to build trust on a human 
level and perform the work that must be done. 
The Postal Service—and its dedicated em-
ployees—are a testament to the work and 
value of government. 
Each day, thousands of federal employees 
go out in our communities to work and live a 
life of service, sometimes facing very real, yet 
underappreciated risks to their lives. Their 
hard work and dedication often go unnoticed 
even though both are indispensable for our 
country, especially now during the current 
Covid–19 pandemic. I believe that we must 
recognize this great, indispensable work and 
commemorate the lives of America’s public 
servants when the moment arises. And we 
must recognize those risks and the sacrifices 
made by our public servants to overcome 
them. 
Today, I ask that my colleagues join me in 
commemorating the life of Ms. Angela Sum-
mers, and recognizing the United States Post-
al Service and the hard work of Letter Carriers 
in Indianapolis and across the country. With-
out the service and sacrifice of people like Ms. 
Summers, the ability of government to carry 
out critical services would stall and fail. I hope 
my colleagues will join me and extend our 
deepest condolences to the family and friends 
of Ms. Summers, and to express our most sin-
cere gratitude for her service.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. DAVID E. PRICE 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, now, more than ever, America must 
remain a global leader. We cannot afford to ig-
nore what is happening outside our borders. 
As we have learned from the Ebola and 
Zika 
crises 
before, 
and 
now 
the 
new 
coronavirus pandemic; infectious disease re-
spects no borders and it has no political ide-
ology. 
No matter how successful we are in com-
bating COVID–19 here at home, we will never 
neutralize the pandemic’s threat unless we 
also fight it abroad. 
As Congress continues to address the ur-
gent domestic health and economic crisis, we 
also must maintain our nation’s commitment to 
providing emergency resources to confront 
COVID–19 around the world. Such assistance 
must address both the immediate health crisis 
and the long-term effects of this pandemic. 
Furthermore, the spread of the novel 
coronavirus has the potential to undo decades 
of American investments in democracy, health, 
education, agriculture, and security around the 
world. Only a robust, comprehensive response 
from the United States can ensure these in-
vestments are not lost and can prevent the ex-
acerbation of second-order intractable social, 
economic, and political crises in communities 
ravaged by COVID–19. 
As chairman of the House Democracy Part-
nership (HDP), a bipartisan congressional 
commission that works to strengthen par-
liaments in emerging democracies, I have 
seen first-hand the success of U.S. develop-
ment assistance programming on the ground. 
We cannot and should not abandon these 
hard-fought development gains or withdraw 
our leadership and leave our partners in the 
lurch at this critical time. HDP is organizing 
virtual round tables with our parliamentary col-
leagues, starting with Tunisia and Kosovo, to 
keep up the dialogue and show support. 
Combating COVID–19 requires a bold, com-
plex, and comprehensive response that must 
include coordination with and support for al-
lies, partners, and developing countries, as 
well as multilateral international institutions, 
such as the World Health Organization 
(WHO). 
The WHO is at the forefront of conducting 
vaccine research, distributing resources, and 
sharing best practices with governments 
around the world. Whatever criticisms we may 
have, this is not the time to cut funding to the 
very organization that may have the largest 
global impact on combating COVID–19. 
The United States has a proud history of 
global leadership that is rooted in our coun-
try’s founding purpose and in our strategic in-
terests. 
We must build on that legacy and join with 
our partners at home and abroad to respond 
to this pandemic. The stakes could hardly be 
higher.

RECOGNIZING THE YUMA COUNTY 
FARM BUREAU’S CENTENNIAL 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, the Yuma 
County Farm Bureau is celebrating its centen-
nial this year. An article in the Yuma Morning 
Sun dated January 8, 1920 notified farmers of 
the upper valley of a meeting at the court-
house to form and organize a farm bureau. 
The article goes on to say, ‘‘It seems that at 
last the farmers have come to the conclusion 
that united they stand and divided they fall.’’ A 
century later, Yuma County Farm Bureau 
members remain united in their efforts to pro-
tect and promote farming and agriculture lo-
cally and beyond. 
From its beginnings, the Farm Bureau has 
existed to give members the tools needed for 
success. That can mean financial expertise, 
communication skills, advocacy opportunities, 
training and opportunities to network with and 
learn from fellow farmers. It all comes together 
to help farmers stay strong and prosperous. 
Yuma County Farm Bureau leaders work 
with elected officials and government agencies 
at the county, state, and national level to ad-
vocate on behalf of its members to address 
issues ranging from food safety, air quality, 
and water. These efforts help ensure agri-
culture remains a strong and viable industry. 
In Yuma County, agriculture is the single larg-
est private sector contributor to Yuma Coun-
ty’s gross domestic product. 
Yuma County Farm Bureau members are 
also members of the Arizona Farm Bureau 
and the American Farm Bureau Federation. 
This means that the Farm Bureau today is 
county, state, and national in its scope and in-
fluence and provides members with a voice at 
all levels. 
I look forward to Yuma County Farm Bu-
reau’s continued work and success as a voice 
for farmers ensuring a prosperous future for 
farming. 
RECOGNIZING SARAH MCWHIRTER 
FOR BEING NAMED ‘‘DEPUTY OF 
THE YEAR’’ FOR HER HEROIC 
ACTIONS TO SAVE A CITIZEN OF 
ROCKFORD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Deputy Sarah McWhirter for being 
named ‘‘Deputy of the Year’’ by the Illinois 
Sheriff’s Association for her heroic actions dur-
ing an incident in 2018. 
Deputy McWhirter is a four-year veteran of 
the Winnebago County Sheriffs Police and 
currently serves in the Sheriffs Crime Scene 
Unit. In August of 2018, Deputy McWhirter 
went above and beyond the call of duty to 
save both herself and a citizen from an armed 
robbery. The robber approached her car and 
got several shots off, but she pulled her weap-
on, defended herself, and saved the citizen. I 
want to thank Deputy McWhirter for her coura-
geous actions during a life-threatening incident 
and for saving another person’s life. Deputy 
McWhirter is a hero and I commend her ac-
tions to protect and save innocent lives. 
It is because of leaders such as Deputy 
McWhirter that I am especially proud to serve 
Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Deputy Sarah McWhirter for being 
named ‘‘Deputy of the Year’’ by the Illinois 
Sheriff’s Association and recognize her for her 
heroic actions at a citizen’s time of need.

OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020

pacities she volunteered over 1,500 hours as 
documented in the Army’s Volunteer Manage-
ment Information System. 
In her SVA capacity Shelly Knapp advised 
the 63d RD Commanding General on all Fam-
ily

Scholarship efforts for deserving USAR Sol-
diers and high school recipients on behalf of 
the 63d RD CG. Five candidates were award-
ed four-year or three-year Army ROTC schol-
arships. This service represents 236 volunteer 
hours. 
While at the 63d Readiness Division, Mrs. 
Knapp was selected by Army Reserve Family 
Programs to attend and obtain certification as 
a Department of Defense Master Trainer—one 
of the select few chosen in the Army Reserve. 
This represents 296 volunteer hours. 
Mrs. Knapp is currently employed as a 
Budget Analyst at the Veterans Administration 
Palo Alto Cooperative Studies Medical Re-
search Program in Mountain View, California. 
During her time at the VA she volunteered 
as an artist/vocalist in the VA Palo Alto Arts 
Session Band, performing at ten VA-spon-
sored events and recording an original song, 
‘America Begins’, by a fellow VA Arts Band 
Veteran that won the Bay Area VA Creative 
Arts Competition. She also volunteers as a 
Wellness Ambassador and Employee Engage-
ment Committee Leader where she has led ef-
forts for a Wellness Fair attended by over 100 
VA employees from multiple Bay Area VA 
campuses. She also displayed many of her 
own paintings and drawings for the Women 
Veteran in Arts Program. This represents 203 
volunteer hours. 
During the five year period from 2015 to 
2020 while Mrs. Knapp was associated with 
the 63d RD, she volunteered over 1,500 hours 
while maintaining full-time employment at the 
VA. She also graduated with her Bachelor’s 
degree in Business Administration from Gold-
en Gate University during this period, com-
pleting 65 credit hours in 22 months—a long- 
time goal accomplished after attending five 
universities previously due to 20-plus military 
relocations and multiple deployments during 
her spouse’s military career. 
In 2014, prior to her family’s final military as-
signment to the 63d RD, Mrs. Knapp served in 
a part-time paid position as Program Adminis-
trator for Texas A&M University’s 4–H ‘Oper-
ation Military Kids’ program where she man-
aged a federal grant that directly assisted 
Guard and Reserve Families of all service 
branches at two military installations in Texas. 
Her efforts included coordinating community 
partner efforts at family readiness events, or-
ganizing multiple volunteer opportunities for 
military families, conducting cooking classes 
for military children and families, and briefing 
community officials on the challenges military 
families face. 
In previous roles as FRG Leader, Co-Lead-
er and Treasurer over a period of 20 years, 
she accumulated over 3,000 volunteer hours 
and was instrumental in standing up Family 
Readiness Groups, training new volunteers, 
organizing and executing small and large- 
scale events and managing non-appropriated 
funds, demonstrating her adeptness at men-
toring new volunteers and FRGs and re-ener-
gizing dormant ones. She has opened her 
home for years to military families for Thanks-
giving and she and her family have long been 
active in Army and Army Reserve Family Pro-
grams, including her daughter Katie serving 
two terms on the National Army Reserve Teen 
Panel. Her volunteer service to Soldiers and 
Army Reserve Families culminated in 2012 
with her FRG being awarded the DoD Family 
Readiness Group of the Year—Army Reserve 
while she served as Co-Leader of the 79th 
Theater Sustainment Command FRG. 
Mrs. Knapp’s unmatched energy, excellent 
communication skills and devotion to serve 
and assist Army Soldiers, Families and Vet-
erans has contributed greatly to individual, unit 
and family morale and readiness in every for-
mation and location she has served over 26 
years, including assignments in five states and 
three overseas locations. Her service in the 
Marines for four years on active duty (1989 to 
93) laid the foundation for her volunteer serv-
ice. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring and 
thanking Shelly Knapp, a force for good in 
military families, for her extraordinary service 
to our country. She has set the ‘gold standard’ 
with 
her 
thousands 
of 
volunteer 
hours, 
touched thousands of lives and strengthened 
our country immeasurably with her devotion to 
service.

HONORING 
THE 
150TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF BONITA ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL 
HON. JOSH HARDER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam Speaker, 
today, I am proud to celebrate the 150th anni-
versary of the opening of Bonita Elementary 
School in Crows Landing, California. This 
campus and its educators have continued to 
provide amazing opportunities to students 
here in the Central Valley and should be ap-
plauded for the valuable work they have pro-
vided to our community over that past 150 
years. 
Bonita Elementary School is one of six tradi-
tional schools in the Newman Crows Landing 
Unified School District. While it is the oldest 
campus in the district, it is also the smallest of 
four elementary schools creating a tight knit 
community where parents and teachers can 
work together to provide a quality education 
for their students. The continued achieve-
ments of this campus should be credited to 
the teachers, administrators, and staff who are 
dedicated to ensuring the academic success 
of every student and to provide a safe and 
comprehensive educational experience. 
I am honored to recognize the hard work 
and dedication of everyone who has contrib-
uted to the success of Bonita Elementary 
School over the past 150 years. I know we 
can look forward to more success for this 
campus and their students for years to come. 
EMERGENCY EDUCATIONAL 
CONNECTIONS ACT, H.R. 6563 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise in the 
midst of a global health emergency that has 
re-calibrated each of our lives, including for 
over 55 million students across the country 
who are now forced into remote learning. To 
help 
combat 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
novel 
coronavirus (COVID–19), over 124,000 public 
and private schools have closed across the 
country—many for the remainder of the aca-
demic year. These actions have laid bare to 
the American people the critical role internet 
access plays in our society. 
Before the pandemic struck, there were 
nearly 12 million students who were part of 
the so-called ‘‘homework gap’’—meaning they 
lacked internet access at home to complete 
their homework. This is a problem because as 
many as 7 in 10 teachers assign homework 
that requires internet access. To keep up with 
their connected peers, homework gap stu-
dents had to travel to a library or other public 
places to use its free Wi-Fi—or risk not com-
pleting their homework and falling further be-
hind academically. 
Fast forward to now, with millions of people 
sheltering at home, students are participating 
in remote learning that includes class meet-
ings, explanations of new content, virtual field 
trips, homework, and learning exercises. As 
such, for those students without internet, this 
gap seems more like a chasm. Students with-
out internet service will fall further behind as 
students with internet service at home can 
continue advancing in their studies. Whether 
they live in urban centers, suburbs, or exurbs, 
or small communities in rural America, all stu-
dents require internet connectivity to succeed 
during this pandemic. 
That is why I introduced the Emergency 
Educational Connections Act, H.R. 6563 which 
would provide $2 billion to the FCC’s E-Rate 
program to ensure students can continue their 
studies from the safety and comfort of their 
homes. Through this program, the FCC can 
distribute funds to schools and libraries, in-
cluding Tribal schools and libraries, relatively 
quickly. We do not have to reinvent any proc-
esses to help students. 
Madam Speaker, it is imperative that the 
Emergency Educational Connections Act, H.R. 
6563 be included in the next coronavirus relief 
package to ensure no child loses out on an 
education because they lack internet access 
at home. I urge all my colleagues to support 
it and see it signed into law. We must finally 
see an end to the digital divide.

ONGOING PARLIAMENTARY 
DIPLOMACY IN EUROPE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I wish to 
provide an update to my colleagues on the 
continuing activities of the Parliamentary As-
sembly of the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe—the OSCE PA—dur-
ing these challenging times. 
Not surprisingly, the pandemic challenges 
the OSCE PA to find new ways to conduct its 
work. International relations require engage-
ment on both a bilateral level and on multilat-
eral levels as well. It is likely that all gath-
erings of the OSCE PA this year will be on-
line, through video conferences. 
For example, last week the OSCE PA held 
a webinar on economic security and the 
COVID–19 pandemic. I participated in the 
event and spoke specifically on energy secu-
rity needs, pointing to the continuation of Rus-
sia’s predatory natural gas supply practices 
which seek to exert geopolitical influence. Eu-
rope needs a diversified supply for its energy 
sources. Too much reliance on Russia for en-
ergy can lead to market distortions and en-
courage corrupt practices, while alternative 
sources increase security and benefit the av-
erage consumer. 
Last week a video session was held of 
those parliamentarians who comprise the lead-
ership of the OSCE PA, which includes Sen-
ator ROGER WICKER of Mississippi and myself. 
Guest speakers included the Prime Minister of 
Albania, Edi Rama, as well as the EU Com-
missioner for Crisis Management, Janez 
Lenarcic of Slovenia. As Chairman of the First 
Committee, I made clear that the committee 
will not waver from its crucial role in defending 
Helsinki Principles where they are most threat-
ened. In this regard, I noted the public state-
ment I made last week, jointly with my fellow 
committee officers from the parliaments of Ro-
mania and Lithuania, on the third anniversary 
of the tragic death of Joseph Stone, an Amer-
ican working on the OSCE Monitoring Mission 
in Ukraine. 
Senator BEN CARDIN of Maryland spoke at 
this leadership session as the Assembly’s 
Special Representative on anti-Semitism, rac-
ism and intolerance. He noted that disadvan-
taged immigrant and minority communities are 
made even more vulnerable by the pandemic, 
and that parliamentarians have an important 
role in responding to this problem during 
states of emergency. Our colleague from New 
Jersey, Mr. CHRIS SMITH, also spoke in his ca-
pacity as the Special Representative of the 
OSCE PA on Human Trafficking Issues. He 
stressed how current circumstances make 
those vulnerable to trafficking and exploitation, 
including children, even more vulnerable. 
Coronavirus and its butterfly effect have also 
rendered non-government organizations less 
effective in their mission to help trafficking vic-
tims by operating shelters, care and coun-
seling. 
To conclude Madam Speaker, I want to 
stress that, while we may need to focus our 
efforts on fighting this pandemic at home, we 
need to work with our partners abroad to 
eliminate a virus that knows no borders and 
from which we ultimately can never fully iso-
late ourselves. Working with our partners and 
allies across the globe is the interest of our 
constituents here at home. I also want to 
stress that the pandemic has not resolved ear-
lier challenges but in many cases made them 
worse. We need the capacity to address a 
wide range of ongoing issues, and the OSCE 
PA is a valued venue for doing that on a multi-
lateral level. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
recognizing the importance of these continued 
discussions with our European allies and 
friends.

IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL 
TEACHER APPRECIATION MONTH 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor every teacher, administrator, employee 
and contractor in all San Mateo County school 
districts who together prepare our children to 
grow into educated and contributing members 
of our society. May is National Teacher Appre-
ciation Month, but they deserve our gratitude 
and admiration every day. They rise to the oc-
casion even under the most challenging and 
unprecedented conditions they are facing in 
the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Working in education is more than a job, it’s 
a passion. The dedication to guide and nurture 
our future generations is based on selfless-
ness and wanting to create a better world. The 
impact an educator has on children is pro-
found. The philosopher Plato once said: ‘‘The 
direction in which education starts a man will 
determine his future life’’—wise and true 
words. 
Who doesn’t have memories of a teacher 
whose words and actions will stay with them 
for the rest of their lives? My middle school 
teacher at South San Francisco’s Parkway, 
Mr. Jex, called me ‘‘chief’’ when he appointed 
me editor in chief of the school newspaper. 
Mr. Jex gave me confidence and a purpose. 
He helped determine the direction of my life 
. . . like all teachers do. 
Educators spend countless hours and their 
own money to prepare students for the future. 
They buy pencils, crayons, paper, snacks, 
toothbrushes, whatever it is the child is lack-
ing. In the United States, we don’t pay them 
anywhere near their value. They deserve more 
compensation and more recognition for the 
tireless and essential work they do, but it’s not 
in the nature of teachers to give up and walk 
away, not even in the face of COVID–19. 
The outbreak of the contagious novel 
coronavirus forced school and health officers 
to close schools on March 16th to prevent the 
spread of the disease. It did not shutter edu-
cation, though. San Mateo County teachers, 
administrators, kitchen workers and custodians 
rose to the occasion. They created distance 
learning, providing students with Chromebooks 
and hotspots to connect in virtual classrooms. 
They designed innovative curricula to ensure 
engaging 
learning 
opportunities. 
Under-
standing the dependence of many students on 
breakfast and lunch, they continued to prepare 
and distribute meals. Striving to prevent the 
achievement gap from deepening, they pro-
vided additional support, tutoring and coun-
seling for students and their families. 
Facing unprecedented challenges, everyone 
from superintendents to principals to teachers 
to administrators to custodians came together 
and contributed. Now, everyone continues to 
adjust to the new reality. Schools will remain 
closed for the remainder of the academic year. 
Madam Speaker, let us rise to acknowledge 
the remarkable resilience of our educators and 
to redouble our efforts as Members of Con-
gress and as members of society to support 
them. They have our children’s backs, so we 
must have theirs. To invoke Plato again, he 
said: ‘‘No man should bring children into the 
world who is unwilling to persevere to the end 
of their nature and education.’’

Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Peoria Medical Society Alliance 
(PMSA) for its 80 years of service to the Peo-
ria community. The PMSA is a not-for-profit 
organization that works with the Peoria Med-
ical Society to promote the health, the edu-
cation, and the quality of life for the people of 
the Peoria community. 
Partnered with the Peoria Medical Society, 
the PMSA has several committees dedicated 
to important causes in the community. For ex-
ample, in their Adopt-A-School program they 
adopted Whittier Grade School to tutor 
kindergarteners and first graders. They also 
host game nights and parties for senior 
homes, such as Heddington Oaks. PMSA 
even provides scholarships for students at-
tending college in health-related fields. I com-
mend the PMSA for its contributions to the 
local Peoria community and I thank them for 
their kindness and generosity. 
It is because of leaders such as the PMSA 
that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally recognize the Pe-
oria Medical Society Alliance for its great work 
in the Peoria community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE ECO-TOUR-
ISM VESSEL EQUITY AND RE-
LIEF ACT OF 2020 
HON. DON YOUNG 
OF ALASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the ‘‘Eco-tourism Vessel Equity and 
Relief Act of 2020.’’ This is a bill to address 
and correct a regulatory mismatch of the man-
ner in which a small passenger vessel that op-
erates in Southeast Alaska is measured. Spe-
cifically, the M/V Liseron (United States official 
number 971339), a converted minesweeper 
that conducts overnight passenger cruises in 
the eco-tourism trade in Southeast Alaska, 
should be classified as the same regulatory 
tonnage for licensing its crew as is used for its 
safety inspection category, and the other ves-
sels in the same trade. 
By way of background, the motor vessel 
Liseron was built in a U.S. shipyard in Ta-
coma, WA, in the early 1950’s as one of a 
class of seven minesweepers under the aus-
pices of the U.S. Navy for the French but was 
subsequently reacquired by the Navy in 1955. 
It was constructed to navigate shallow waters 
of bays, coastlines, and inlets having a shal-
low draft, which is why it makes for the perfect 
vessel to operate in Southeast Alaska. Specifi-
cally, the M/V Liseron is 145 feet long and 28 
feet wide with a draft of 8.5 feet. Later delisted 
by the Navy, The Boat Company in Port Or-
chard, WA, acquired and restored the vessel 
in the late 1980’s. After an extensive 16-month 
restoration in a U.S. shipyard facility in Tarpon 
Springs, FL, where the vessel was gutted and 
refitted, this vessel was placed into service in 
the early 1990’s as an eco-tourism vessel in 
Southeast Alaska. The vessel’s operations 
have a significant economic impact in both 
Washington State and Alaska. The vessel is 
homeported in Kitsap County, Washington 
State, where it undergoes needed mainte-
nance and repair locally in Pacific Northwest 
shipyards, and where the vessel re-provisions 
for the next season’s sailing in Alaska. Its op-
erations during the cruising season in South-
east Alaska bring significant job opportunities 
and needed economic activity in local busi-
nesses by the company and its customers. 
The vessel enables tourists from around the 
world to come and enjoy the unparalleled sce-
nic and natural beauty that Alaska has to 
offer. 
Operationally, the M/V Liseron has ten 
staterooms and is limited to 20 passengers. 
More critically, the vessel is currently in-
spected by the Coast Guard as a small pas-
senger vessel in the 100 gross regulatory ton-
nage category. Notwithstanding that, the ves-
sel has a larger tonnage entered on its certifi-
cate of inspection. This larger tonnage is due 
to the arcane nature of the U.S. vessel ad-
measurement laws, rules that govern the volu-
metric size of vessels. Larger competitor ves-
sels can be 238 feet in length and carry 100 
passengers, i.e., nearly 100 feet longer and 5 
times the number of passengers, yet they are 
considered to be in the smaller 100 GT small 
passenger vessel category for both licensing 
and inspection purposes. 
Needless to say, the M/V Liseron has an 
equity disparity as the vessel must compete 
with similar or larger vessels in the eco-tour-
ism trade. While the vessel is inspected and 
regulated for all safety purposes in a lower 
tonnage category, due to the higher tonnage 
rating entered on its certificate of inspection, 
the M/V Liseron must source crew from sea-
farers with deep water credentials (i.e., 500 
GT) rather than for the shallower and pro-
tected waters of Southeast Alaska. The in-
equity is underscored by the fact that the M/ 
V Liseron physically can fit within the volu-
metric profile of its competitors. That is, it is 
smaller, but the rules say it should be as-
signed a measurement of being larger. Fur-
ther, the vessel carries far fewer passengers 
than its competitors. This seems to be a regu-
latory mismatch and creates the inequitable 
situation where a physically larger vessel that 
carries five times the number of passengers is 
determined to be smaller for crew licensing. 
And this mismatch results in the M/V 
Liseron to have its master and chief mate with 
a license in a much higher tonnage category. 
The legislation I introduce today corrects this 
inequity and regulatory anomaly. This legisla-
tion prohibits the M/V Liseron from undergoing 
any alteration of its size. Consequently, there 
is no reason why the smaller M/V Liseron that 
carries far fewer passengers must have a 
crew licensed in a larger tonnage category. 
To add to the inequity, a higher turnover for 
the master and first mate occurs because 
these mariners with the larger 500 GT li-
censes, which are more appropriate for deep 
water oceangoing vessels, leave whenever a 
deep-water position is available. This is under-
standable from their point of view. These 500 
GT qualified crew get a larger tonnage license 
to work on larger seagoing vessels, not a 
smaller vessel operating in the shallow waters 
of bays, coastlines, and inlets in Southeast 
Alaska. This makes attracting 500 GT qualified 
crew that much more difficult. While the rest of 
the crew is stable, these two positions require 
that new hires undergo qualifying each time 
these positions turn over for these inland 
waters. If the master and first mate can hold 
100 GT licenses it will result in less turnover 
and more appropriately experienced personnel 
that will contribute to even safer and con-
sistent operation of the vessel. No alteration of 
the vessel itself is proposed nor will the crew 
size be reduced. Only two positions are af-
fected by this legislation. 
Another aspect of the vessel’s operations is 
the economic impact of the cancellations due 
to the COVID–19. The operation of the eco- 
tourism trade in Southeast Alaska is seasonal. 
As a result, the M/V Liseron has lost an entire 
season of revenue due to cancellations. Con-
tinuing an artificial barrier such as having to 
hire crew in a mismatched licensing category 
will only add to the vessel’s difficulties to re-
cover from this economic loss when they are 
able to resume operations. 
The tragic fire that occurred on board the 
dive vessel Conception on September 2, 
2019, has brought additional scrutiny to small 
passenger vessels with overnight accommoda-
tions. Almost immediately after that fire an offi-
cial marine investigation was commenced. I 
understand that in addition a criminal inves-
tigation is being conducted and will take a 
long time to complete. All of this is appropriate 
and should be done to get at the root of what 
went wrong on that vessel. As part of the 
safety concerns, the Coast Guard initiated a 
special Concentrated Inspection Campaign 
(CIC) to review the safety of all small pas-
senger vessels with overnight accommoda-
tions. On October 8, 2019, the M/V Liseron 
was fully inspected by the Coast Guard as a 
vessel with overnight accommodations as part 
of this special inspection campaign. I under-
stand that the CIC program included a job aid 
worksheet used by the Coast Guard inspec-
tors to evaluate crew operations and proce-
dures when inspecting the M/V Liseron and 
other overnight accommodation small pas-
senger vessels. As a result of this special in-
spection, I understand that the Coast Guard 
confirmed that the vessel passed for every as-
pect of its certificate of inspection without ex-
ception and for crew performance. For pas-
senger safety, the vessel has early warning 
and fire detection alarm systems, ready evac-
uation routes from each passenger cabin onto 
the main deck, and approved life rafts and 
vests. Having passed this rigorous and special 
inspection, the M/V Liseron is free of any of 
the issues on the Conception. The change 
brought about by this legislation will not create 
a vessel construction or safety issue. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me to 
enact this statutory provision permitting the 
Coast Guard to treat this vessel as less than 
100 gross tons for the purpose of applying the 
operational regulatory measurement under 
section 14305 of title 46, United States Code, 
provided that nothing is done to change the 
size of the vessel. By adjusting the tonnage 
rating for licensing the M/V Liseron’s crew to 
be consistent with its safety inspection cat-
egory, the M/V Liseron would be able to hire 
and retain more appropriate experienced crew 
familiar with Southeast Alaskan waterways 
and small passenger vessel operations, and 
be regulated the same as other similar or larg-
er vessels with which the M/V Liseron must 
compete.

NATIONAL 
DAY 
OF 
AWARENESS 
FOR MISSING AND MURDERED 
INDIGENOUS WOMEN 
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize May 5, 2020 as the National Day of 
Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indige-
nous Women and Girls. 
Today, we recognize our nation’s dev-
astating history of colonization and the dis-
proportionate effects for Native women. The 
coronavirus pandemic has exposed health 
care inequalities in our country, especially the 
health care available to Native communities. 
But we must be equally concerned about the 
number of Native women and girls that face 
incredible violence in this country every day. 
In the United States, Native women face trag-
ically high rates of violence, sexual assault, 
and murder. According to the U.S. Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, homicide is 
the third leading cause of death among Native 
women. These rates are ten times higher than 
the national average and far too often, families 
are left without answers. 
I am a cosponsor of Savanna’s Act, which 
will recognize Native women and make sure 
that their invisibility to law enforcement ends. 
The bill would create and improve procedures, 
communication, and cooperation among fed-
eral, state, tribal, and local agencies that may

share jurisdiction over crimes against Native 
women. We cannot allow the experiences of 
Native communities continue to slip through 
bureaucracy. Today, I am calling on House 
Leadership to quickly bring this bill to the floor. 
I am thankful for the work of the City of 
Portland to shine a light on this issue by pass-
ing a resolution later this week calling atten-
tion to this urgent crisis. We need to all work 
together to demand action. 
We must strive to better understand the in-
stitutional racism and systemic inequalities 
that Native communities face. I will keep fight-
ing for justice for those who are missing or 
murdered, and I remain committed to taking 
action to prevent these crimes in the future. 
CONGRATULATING THE EASTLAND 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
GIRLS 
BASKET-
BALL TEAM ON THEIR WIN AT 
CLASS 1A IHSA STATE FINALS 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 5, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Eastland High School Girls 
Basketball Team, who won the Illinois High 
School Association’s Class 1A State Finals 
Girls Basketball Tournament. 
Despite being down by ten at half-time, the 
team ramped up their defense and came back 
to beat their opponent 62–57 in the state 
championship. Eastland finished the season 
34–3, with the 34 wins being the most in pro-
gram history. As a former athlete, I appreciate 
the fortitude the team displayed to achieve 
their dream of being a state champions and 
commend them for their efforts and attitude. 
This team is an example of the importance of 
dedication and a strong work ethic, and I am 
proud to see them represent Lanark so well 
throughout the state with his talent and pas-
sion. 
It is because of student leaders such as the 
Eastland High School Girls Basketball Team 
that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally congratulate the 
Eastland High School Girls Basketball Team 
on their Class 1A State Finals title in Basket-
ball.
