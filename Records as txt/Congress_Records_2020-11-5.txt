HONORING RABBI GOPEN LIPOF 
HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY, III 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 5, 2020 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam Speaker, l rise 
today to recognize Rabbi Emily Gopen Lipof 
on her 80th birthday. An extraordinary woman 
who has raised a loving, still growing family, 
Rabbi Lipof has dedicated her life to strength-
ening her community and the world around 
her. As she gathers virtually with friends and 
family to celebrate her 80th birthday, it is my 
honor to play a small role in recognizing her. 
At five years old, when most of us struggle 
to choose a favorite toy, Emily had already de-
cided that she would be a Rabbi when she 
grew up. Not deterred by the lack of female 
Rabbis to look up to, she knew her calling and 
always strove towards that ultimate goal. Even 
as her path diverged throughout her early 
years as she built a family and a career in pol-
itics, she used her powerful voice and infec-
tious personality to become a leader in her 
community. 
After earning a bachelor’s degree with four 
toddlers, Emily used the power of politics to 
shape her hometown of Newton, her Com-
monwealth of Massachusetts and her country. 
She served as campaign manager for her hus-
band Michael’s campaign for Alderman, Sen-
ator Edward Brooke, and Newton’s longest 
serving Mayor, Theodore Mann. But still, she 
remained committed to her calling as a Rabbi. 
In 1980, Emily organized a communal wed-
ding for 60 Jewish couples from the former 
Soviet Union who had been denied a Jewish 
wedding in their youths. That powerful experi-
ence inspired her to reunite with her path to-
wards becoming a Rabbi. So committed to her 
calling, Emily began commuting to and from 
The Academy for Jewish Religion in New York 
for one long day of classes. Despite the de-
manding, grueling schedule, she was ordained 
just five years later. 
Just days after receiving semichah, she was 
offered a position as interim Rabbi at Ohabei 
Shalom in Brokline, becoming the first woman 
in the United States to be named senior Rabbi 
of a major congregation. For decades, she 
has continued to be a fearless, compassionate 
leader in her community. She founded the 
Temple Shalom Nursery School to help nur-
ture young children and support their families. 
She married a gay couple on the very first day 
marriage equality became the law of our Com-
monwealth in 2008. And quietly, she has of-
fered counsel and guidance to countless 
neighbors in need of support. 
Happy 80th birthday to Rabbi Lipof. And on 
behalf of a grateful Commonwealth and coun-
try, I thank her for demanding better of, and 
for, us all. Enjoy the day. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF F. 
MICHAEL HOFFSCHNEIDER 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 5, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madame Speaker, I rise 
today with Congressman MIKE THOMPSON to 
recognize 
the 
service 
of 
F. 
Michael 
Hoffschneider upon his retirement. 
Michael grew up in Oakland, California, and 
enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1966. He served 
with distinction, rising to the rank of Sergeant 
and earning the position of Drill Sergeant. 
After Michael’s separation from the Army in 
1969, he attended the University of California, 
Berkeley with the assistance of the GI Bill. He 
graduated with a B.A. in Political Science in 
1973, and began working as a Veterans 
Claims Examiner for the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs. 
With Michael’s new job in San Francisco, he 
and his wife, Conny, settled in Pleasant Hill, 
California, where they would raise their family. 
While working for the VA, Michael further pur-
sued his education, graduating from John F. 
Kennedy University with a Master’s Degree in 
Public Administration. He continued to work 
his way up through the VA and eventually be-
came the Veterans Service Center Manager at 
the Oakland Regional Office. 
Although Michael retired from the VA in 
2004, his work with veterans was not com-
plete and he soon started working for the 
Contra Costa County Veterans Service Office. 
During this time, Michael assisted veterans 
with his many years of experience and wis-
dom and even served for a time as the interim 
County Veterans Service Officer. His work has 
helped train the next generation of Veterans 
Service Representatives, leaving a legacy that 
inspires those who follow in his footsteps. Ad-
ditionally, to commemorate Michael’s work 
with veterans, he was given honorary lifetime 
membership with the Vietnam Veterans of Dia-
blo Valley as a Vietnam-era veteran. 
Michael’s work has impacted the lives of 
countless veterans and their families. Please 
join me and Congressman MIKE THOMPSON in 
congratulating Michael as he retires from the 
Contra Costa Veterans Service Office and 
thanking him for his dedicated service.

HONORING W.C. GORDEN 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 5, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor W.C. Gorden. 
W.C. Gorden was a native of Nashville, 
Tennessee, a former longtime football coach 
of Jackson State University and a member of 
the College Football Hall of Fame. Mr. Gorden 
was considered the school’s winningest coach. 
Mr. Gorden served in the U.S. Army before 
beginning his coaching journey in 1956. 
Gorden led the Tigers from 1976 to 1991 
and guided the football team to eight SWAC 
championships and nine NCAA Division I-AA 
playoff appearances. He had just one losing 
season. 
Jackson State won its second HBCU na-
tional championship in 1985. He finished his 
storied career with a 119–48–5 overall record 
and was a six-time SWAC Coach of the Year. 
Gorden was inducted into the SWAC Hall of 
Fame in 1994 and the College Football Hall of 
Fame in 2008. 
He was named to ESPN’s Top 150 list of 
the greatest college football coaches of all 
time. 
Gorden produced 29 NFL Draft picks at 
Jackson State, including Jimmy Smith. 
Last month, the Jackson City Council voted 
unanimously to rename Jaycee Park after him 
in his honor. 
Mr. Gorden, who was 90, died on October 
23, 2020. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the late Hall of Famer, W.C. 
Gorden.

CONGRATULATING 
ASSISTANT 
CHIEF YOGANANDA PITTMAN OF 
THE U.S. CAPITOL POLICE 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 5, 2020 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Assistant 
Chief Yogananda Pittman of the United States 
Capitol Police on being awarded the Women 
in Federal Law Enforcement’s 2020 Out-
standing Advocate for Women in Federal Law 
Enforcement Award. Ms. Pittman joined the 
U.S. Capitol Police force in 2001. Her USCP 
career began with security and protective 
services for the U.S. Senate. She has contin-
ually risen through the ranks, and in 2012 be-
came the first African-American female super-
visor to become Captain. From 2016 to 2018, 
Ms. Pittman completed the National Organiza-
tion of Black Law Enforcement Executives 
(NOBLE) CEO Mentoring Program, and in Oc-
tober of last year, she became the first female 
to achieve the rank of Assistant Chief of the 
U.S. Capitol Police—the same year she com-
pleted a Master’s Degree in Public Administra-
tion and enrolled in a Doctoral program. As if 
these accomplishments were not enough, Ms. 
Pittman has been promoting diversity and 
mentoring through the U.S. Capitol Police’s In-
clusion, Diversity, Equity and Action (IDEA) 
Office—all in addition to her police force re-
sponsibilities. To call her impressive is truly an 
understatement. I’d like to formally express my 
gratitude for her dedicated public service and 
congratulate 
her 
on 
her 
well-deserved 
achievement of the Outstanding Advocate for 
Women in Federal Law Enforcement Award. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF DONALD KENT HOBERT, M.D. 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 5, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Donald Kent 
Hobert, M.D. 
Born in Iowa, Dr. Hobert grew up on his 
family’s hog farm. His education began in a 
one-room schoolhouse, but he later attended 
junior high at a city school. During his fresh-
man year at Charles City High School, Dr. 
Hobert met his future wife, Nancy, when they 
ran against each other for class president. The 
two eventually reconnected during their col-
lege years, fell in love, and married in 1959. 
Dr. Hobert attended medical school at the Uni-
versity of Iowa before the couple relocated to 
California where he worked as an intern at 
San Joaquin County Hospital in Stockton. 
The Hobert family relocated again during Dr. 
Hobert’s service in the United States Air Force 
during the Vietnam War. The family then set-
tled permanently in Martinez, California, where 
Dr. Hobert began working at Contra Costa 
County Medical Center and later started a pri-
vate medical practice. He dedicated his pro-
fessional career to caring for and helping his 
patients. Dr. Hobert’s life changed when he 
became confined to a wheelchair in 1983, but 
it never deterred him—he found ways to con-
tinue practicing medicine in his pursuit to help 
others. 
Beyond his career, Dr. Hobert adored his 
family and was committed to the happiness of 
his loved ones. He cherished family vacations 
and used his time wood working to make gifts 
for family and items to be donated for auctions 
to various organizations that he supported. 
Sadly, Dr. Hobert passed away this year. 
He is survived by his wife, three children, four 
grandchildren, sister, and stepmother. He will 
be remembered for his compassion, gen-
erosity, and determination. Please join me in 
honoring Dr. Hobert for his many contributions 
to our community.
