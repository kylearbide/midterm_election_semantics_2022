DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY

f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O God, in You do we place our trust; 
in You do we find our refuge. You are 
our Lord; apart from You there is noth-
ing that we can do or claim that can 
truly be called good. 
Forgive us when we part ways with 
You and pursue other gods; the gods of 
power, position, possession; when we 
taste on our lips the gods of ego, ease, 
and expertise. 
Remind us that to worship these 
things will only lead to suffering and 
sadness. For You alone are sufficient, 
the source of our serenity. You have al-
ready provided all that we need and are 
so privileged to enjoy. 
So shall we praise You, the Lord, who 
gives us counsel, who provides instruc-
tion even in the darkest hours of our 
days. 
May we keep our eyes always on You. 
With You alongside us, our hearts will 
be glad and our steps sure. 
Make Yourself known to us on the 
paths we trod. Fill us with the joy of 
Your presence. 
We offer this prayer in the strength 
of Your name. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCNERNEY) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. MCNERNEY led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to five requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
INCITING POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
(Mr. GOMEZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I believe 
some of my Republican colleagues, and 
one in particular, wish harm upon this 
legislative body. I am not saying this 
for shock value; it is the conclusion I 
drew after a Member of Congress advo-
cated violence against our peers, the 
Speaker, and our government. 
It is what I believed after this Cham-
ber was turned into a crime scene just 
10 weeks ago. It is how many of us felt, 
sheltering in this room, as the Capitol 
was breached. 
Some Members called their loved 
ones to say good-bye. Others prayed to 
their God. And I asked myself if this 
would be the day our democracy died. 
I take no joy in introducing this res-
olution, but any Member who incites 
political violence and threatens our 
lives must be expelled, and I will do ev-
erything I can in my power to protect 
our democracy and keep all of my col-
leagues safe. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE LINEMEN AND 
LINEWOMEN OF TEXAS 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the resil-
ient linemen of Texas-25 for their out-
standing work to successfully provide 
power to Texas homes, businesses, and 
communities during the catastrophic 
winter storms. 
I and many others send our deep 
gratitude 
to 
the 
workers

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1588 
March 19, 2021 
Pedernales Electric Cooperative, Aus-
tin Energy, and other electric pro-
viders in Texas-25 who worked tire-
lessly through a brutal winter storm to 
meet the needs of Texans and across 
the State. 
They put their lives in danger, work-
ing around the clock in subzero tem-
peratures and in harsh conditions to 
restore critical power as quickly as 
possible. 
Due to their fortitude and grit, lives 
were saved, animals were saved, and 
communities were restored and on 
track to recovery. 
You are our heroes, and on behalf of 
the 25th 
Congressional District of 
Texas, we simply say thank you. In 
God we trust. 
f 
VIOLENCE AGAINST ASIAN 
AMERICANS IS UN-AMERICAN 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak on the horrific 
anti-Asian American sentiment that 
has been brewing in our country. 
Like all of you, I was heartbroken by 
this week’s shooting in Georgia. This 
violent act of hate has no place in our 
country. While this tragedy deserves 
all our outrage and attention, it is im-
portant to remember that this was not 
an isolated incident. 
COVID–19 has worsened the racism 
and xenophobia our AAPI brothers and 
sisters face. Many elected officials 
have used the pandemic to fan the 
flames of hate, and now they refuse to 
accept the consequences of their ac-
tions. 
My district is home to over 10,000 
Asian Americans. They make our com-
munity whole, and they do not deserve 
to live in fear because of hateful rhet-
oric that has spread across America. 
As President Biden has said, violence 
against Asian Americans is un-Amer-
ican, and it must stop. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
CHRISTOPHER BROWNAWELL 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, today, we 
take a moment to remember the life 
and service of Sergeant Major Chris-
topher Brownawell, a decorated Amer-
ican soldier who died unexpectedly last 
week. 
Chris’ life was defined by his service, 
both in and out of uniform. For 24 
years, Chris served honorably in the 
United States Army, deploying to 
Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait. 
Outside of the military, Chris kept 
our community safe as a corrections 
officer at SCI Coal Township. 
Those who knew Chris remember him 
as the quintessential infantryman and 
a purpose-driven leader who went out 
of his way to develop and mentor other 
soldiers. Chris set the standard for 
other soldiers and, undoubtedly, had a 
profound impact on so many during his 
years of service. 
Every freedom we have in this Nation 
was paid for by soldiers like Chris. 
Chris is a hero, and his legacy of serv-
ice to our community, State, and coun-
try will live on with his family and 
friends and our community. 
f 
HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIANS 
MUST STOP 
(Ms. CHU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, eight lives 
were lost in Georgia this week when a 
gunman targeted three Asian-owned 
businesses. Six of these victims were 
Asian-American women. 
I am heartbroken for all these lost 
souls, and I am heartbroken because 
this is just one of the latest in a string 
of attacks that have created fear 
throughout the Asian-American com-
munity. 
Since the start of the coronavirus 
pandemic, there have been over 3,800 
reported anti-Asian hate crimes and in-
cidents. What started off as dirty looks 
and verbal assault has escalated into 
physical attacks that have become in-
creasingly deadly. 
There was Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 
84-year old man who died after being 
assaulted outside of his home, and Noel 
Quintana, whose face was slashed from 
ear to ear on a New York subway. 
These attacks have been almost a 
daily tragedy, and they must stop. We 
must stand united against xenophobia 
and slurs like ‘‘China virus’’ and ‘‘Kung 
flu,’’ which we know put lives at risk, 
and we must work together to stop 
Asian hate. 
f 
RECOGNIZING KIDNEY CANCER 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. HAGEDORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, March 
is Kidney Cancer Awareness Month, 
and frankly, every month is cancer 
awareness month. 
Two years ago, I was diagnosed with 
stage IV kidney cancer, and ever since, 
I have received treatment and great 
care from the Mayo Clinic in Roch-
ester, Minnesota. 
Two months ago, they removed my 
kidney, and I am very grateful to say 
that, just this week, my doctor said 
‘‘no cancer detected’’ at this time. 
But here is the point about this: My 
cancer was found through a routine 
physical. I had no symptoms. 
In this past year, millions of Ameri-
cans 
have, 
for 
whatever 
reason, 
coronavirus or otherwise, postponed or 
canceled 
their 
doctor’s 
visits 
and 
aren’t getting the cancer screenings 
they have in the past. 
I encourage everyone to make sure 
you get out there, see your doctor reg-
ularly, get looked into, because the 
earliest possible detection of serious 
illness can literally save your life. I am 
someone who can attest to that. 
To my fellow cancer survivors, hang 
in there. Keep fighting because cures 
are coming along every day. And, Mr. 
Speaker, it is uncanny how family, 
friends, medical professionals, total 
strangers, they rally around us and 
help us fight. 
f 
HONORING DR. I.M. SINGER 
(Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and accomplish-
ments of Dr. I.M. Singer, one of Amer-
ica’s most influential mathematicians. 
The 
son 
of 
Polish-Jewish 
immi-
grants, Dr. Singer had an unquenchable 
thirst for knowledge and graduated 
from the University of Michigan with a 
degree in physics in just 21⁄2 years be-
fore joining the United States military 
during World War II. 
Upon returning, Dr. Singer earned a 
doctorate degree in mathematics from 
the University of Chicago. Later, he 
chaired committees at the United 
States National Academy of Sciences, 
was a member of the White House 
Science Council, and cofounded the 
Mathematical Sciences Research Insti-
tute in Berkeley. 
Dr. Singer’s most prominent con-
tribution was the Atiyah-Singer index 
theorem, which created a link between 
mathematical analysis and topology 
and, ultimately, led to a new field of 
mathematics. For his work, Dr. Singer 
received the most prestigious award in 
mathematics, the Abel Prize. 
As a fellow mathematician, I deeply 
admire Dr. Singer’s contributions to 
theoretical physics and mathematics, 
which have revolutionized the way we 
understand the universe. 
f 
HONORING BURKE WALL 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
Burke Wall, who passed away on March 
1, 2021, at the age of 76. 
Burke was a lifelong Georgian who 
graduated from the University of Geor-
gia with a degree in dairy production. 
Burke was an avid UGA football fan 
and an active sportsman. 
Burke was also an enthusiastic deep- 
sea fisherman aboard his boat called 
Trashman, and his talents were recog-
nized in numerous tournaments along 
the East Coast. 
In 2019, Burke won the Edisto Beach 
South Carolina Governor’s Cup Tour-
nament and impressively put a 549- 
pound blue marlin on the dock at the 
Mid-Atlantic 500 the same year, earn-
ing him second place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1589 
March 19, 2021 
Burke owned Superior Sanitation 
Services, sold that company to Waste 
Management, and then founded Atlan-
tic Waste Services in Pooler in 1999. 
Although Burke grew up with humble 
beginnings on his family’s dairy farm, 
he lived a life of immense influence 
through his involvement with the 
Chatham Club, the Rotary Club of Sa-
vannah, the Savannah Yacht Club, and 
several other professional organiza-
tions. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to 
all who knew him during this most dif-
ficult time, especially his son, Ben. 
f 
PENNSYLVANIA BENEFITING 
FROM AID 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, last week, 
President Biden signed the American 
Rescue Plan. Although the bill received 
no Republican votes, it has bipartisan 
support and will have a long-lasting bi-
partisan impact. 
Many constituents in my district 
have already received relief checks, 
with as many as 90 million stimulus 
checks out this week. 
Yet, this transformative legislation 
goes even further. It expands funding 
to get shots in arms and kids safely in 
school, and it cuts child poverty in half 
with an expanded child tax credit. 
Additionally, we finally targeted re-
lief 
to 
our 
local 
restaurants 
and 
eateries that have been devastated by 
the pandemic. 
Let’s not forget about our State and 
local governments. We will finally be 
sending them much-needed aid. 
My home State of Pennsylvania will 
receive more than $13 billion. Mont-
gomery and Berks Counties, where my 
district resides, will receive a com-
bined $242 million. 
The American Rescue Plan, and all it 
provides, is the responsible way to 
fully reopen all of our communities and 
Build Back Better.

WHOLE MILK FOR HEALTHY KIDS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, last week, I introduced 
the Whole Milk For Healthy Kids Act 
with Mr. ANTONIO DELGADO. This bill 
addresses the importance of providing 
whole milk in school cafeterias. 
It is proven that milk is the number 
one provider of nine essential nutri-
ents, as well as a great deal of long- 
term health benefits, including better 
bone health, lower blood pressure, re-
duced risk of cardiovascular disease 
and type 2 diabetes. These benefits are 
crucial for the healthy development of 
our Nation’s youth. 
Over the years, milk has been un-
fairly demonized, leading to the loss of 
nearly an entire generation of milk 
drinkers. The goal of this bill is to give 
children a wide variety of milk options 
and bolster milk consumption, a win- 
win for growing healthy children and 
America’s dairy farm families. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to follow the 
signs and allow whole milk back into 
the school cafeterias. With bipartisan 
support, it is my hope that we can 
bring this bill to the floor and pass this 
critical legislation to encourage the 
healthy development of our Nation’s 
youth and support our dairy farm fami-
lies across the country.

ant to House Resolution 233, I call up

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 1 hour, equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
the ranking minority member of the 
Committee on the Budget or their re-
spective designees. 
The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
YARMUTH) and the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. SMITH) each will control 
30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Kentucky. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert 
extraneous 
material 
into 
the 
RECORD on H.R. 1868. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, because of the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, relief checks are al-
ready being deposited in Americans’ 
bank accounts, furloughs have already 
ended for tens of thousands of workers, 
and we have averted the unemploy-
ment cliff. But we have a loose end to 
tie up before our work is finished, and 
that is the bill before us. 
Enacting COVID relief through budg-
et reconciliation was always plan B, 
but the American people could not af-
ford any more delays, and Congress 
needed a path forward for the Amer-
ican 
Rescue 
Plan 
and 
the 
trans-
formative support it provides. Because 
paygo requirements cannot be changed 
in reconciliation bills, we knew from 
the outset that this additional legisla-
tive fix was needed to avert painful and 
indiscriminate cuts to Medicare, farm 
supports, and other programs. 
The language of H.R. 1868 should look 
familiar. Over the past year, Congress 
has enacted multiple COVID relief 
packages to address the crises facing 
the American people and our economy. 
Each time, we excluded these bills 
from statutory paygo calculations be-
cause of the dire impact sequestration 
would have on our Nation’s seniors, 
students, farmers, and others. 
Today’s bill will ensure the American 
Rescue Plan is treated the same as 
these previous relief measures and 
treated the same as the last reconcili-
ation bill passed by Congress. That was 
in 2017, when Republicans used rec-
onciliation to pass the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act. 
Following the bill’s passage without 
Democratic support in either the House 
or Senate, Republicans proposed this 
same legislative fix, albeit buried in a 
problematic 
continuing 
resolution. 
Enough House and Senate Democrats 
joined Republicans to prevent harmful 
across-the-board cuts to critical pro-
grams I mentioned, even though we op-
posed the short-term CR and the mas-
sive tax giveaways to the wealthy. 
This time the situation is flipped, but 
the same nonetheless. House Repub-
licans opposed the American Rescue 
Plan. I don’t understand their position. 
This bill is supported by more than 70 
percent of Americans and will directly 
benefit far more. But that is the choice 
they made. Either way, a statutory 
legislative fix for paygo is now needed 
and, historically, that has been enacted 
with little dispute. 
Even in the wake of contentious leg-
islation, Congress has come together to 
prevent sequestration and to protect 
Medicare, farm support programs, so-
cial services, resources for students 
and individuals with disabilities, and 
other programs Americans rely on. 
This time should be no different. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, this week, the Presi-
dent has been traveling across the 
country telling Americans how appre-
ciative they should be that Washington 
Democrats are spending, or have spent, 
$1.9 trillion in borrowed dollars, money 
they are using to bail out States run by 
the President’s political buddies and to 
reward devastating lockdowns that 
have destroyed hundreds of thousands 
of small businesses and kept kids out 
of schools; billions on policies that will 
reduce private-sector employment in 
this country; billions on foreign aid. 
And out of all the money, less than 9 
percent goes towards healthcare spend-
ing to crush the virus and to put vac-
cinations in people’s arms. 
The massive debt-inducing spending 
package also threatens billions in cuts 
to seniors on Medicare, including $36 
billion starting next year. My guess is 
that the President is probably not 
going to be bragging to seniors he 
meets on the road that the bill he 
signed into law is cutting billions of 
dollars from their Medicare, just as I 
am sure he won’t bother to mention 
that the economic recovery he wants 
to take credit for is already underway; 
that the economy is steadily projected 
to reach the level of real GDP growth 
we saw prior to the pandemic by the 
middle of this year; that we are on 
track this year, in fact, to have the 
largest economic growth in more than 
15 years, all without one dime used 
from the nearly $2 trillion bailout 
package that the Democrats passed in 
the last week. 
In other words, just as President 
Biden has desperately tried to take 
credit for the incredible, truly historic 
work President Trump did to ensure 
that we have vaccines going into the 
arms to save lives, he is trying to take 
credit for an economic recovery put in 
place by the policies signed into law by 
President Trump. Don’t listen to the 
words. Watch his actions. 
In fact, it was under President 
Trump’s 
leadership 
that 
Operation 
Warp Speed delivered multiple vaccines 
in record time with planning to get 
those shots in the arms of the Amer-
ican people. Meanwhile, the Biden ad-
ministration has spent an inordinate 
amount of time running afoul of fact 
checkers with their shameless rhetoric 
meant to dismiss the incredible work 
done by the previous administration. 
Nevertheless, we are here today be-
cause Democrats want to fix one of the 
many problems caused by President 
Biden and the House Democrats in the 
$1.9 trillion bailout: Those cuts to 
Medicare. And they want to do so by 
erasing almost $2 trillion in spending 
from the Nation’s books; pretending $2 
trillion in spending is not going to hap-
pen. 
That, of course, serves two purposes 
for our Democrat colleagues. First, it 
avoids the immediate cuts, which they 
caused and they chose to happen. Sec-
ond, it gives them a clean slate on 
which they are reportedly already 
planning to add trillions more in 
spending in the months to come. 
Given all of this, I would ask my col-
leagues to move forward with a much 
better approach, one that stops their 
Medicare cuts and does so in a more re-
sponsible way. Let’s work together to 
protect seniors and to cut waste from 
their bailout bill that the American 
people clearly don’t want, such as stop-
ping billions in benefits and payments 
to prisoners and illegal immigrants— 
billions in payments to prisoners and 
illegal immigrants; stopping funds they 
recklessly jammed into the bailout for 
the National Endowment for the Arts 
and the National Endowment for the 
Humanities; stopping special handouts 
to Federal employees; rescinding bil-
lions in bailouts that go to State gov-
ernments that do not need it, and re-
ward their continued lockdowns. 
Mr. Speaker, put people before poli-
tics. Put people before politics. Put 
seniors ahead of the Democrats’ special 
interests and their political class. This 
is the responsible way to address the 
Medicare cuts caused by my Democrat 
colleagues. It is a far better approach 
than to simply pretend $1.9 trillion in 
spending is not happening. It is a far 
more honest approach given the fact 
that the President is traveling the 
country bragging about the same near-
ly $2 trillion in spending. 
Mr. Speaker, $1.9 trillion, such a big 
number, is hard to put in proper per-
spective. But this year, when the 
American people pay their Federal in-
come taxes, every single penny—every

single 
penny 
of 
their 
hard-earned 
money the IRS collects will total less 
than the cost of this $1.9 trillion bail-
out to their friends, donors, and polit-
ical allies. 
Let’s do the responsible thing: Pro-
tect seniors by rolling back some of the 
most wasteful and wrong policies em-
bedded in the Democrat’s bailout bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. SCOTT), the distinguished 
chairman of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, and also a member of 
the Budget Committee. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of H.R. 1868. 
Since the start of the pandemic, Con-
gress has passed several emergency 
COVID–19 response packages to help 
our communities get back on their 
feet. Unfortunately, as the chairman 
mentioned, due to technicalities in the 
reconciliation process, some of that 
progress will be wiped away unless we 
pass this legislation. 
So H.R. 1868 is necessary to prevent 
the automatic, across-the-board fund-
ing cuts that will undermine our recov-
ery. Just as the ranking member men-
tioned, that will happen unless we pass 
this bill. Many of those cuts will occur 
within the jurisdiction of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. 
For example, the legislation before 
us protects student borrowers from 
automatic increases and loan origina-
tion fees and would increase the cost of 
taking out a student loan. 
The bill protects TEACH Grants, 
which help recruit talented individuals 
into the classroom. 
The proposal preserves funding for 
many of our colleges struggling to sur-
vive during the pandemic. 
Passing this legislation will prevent 
cuts to grants that go to students 
whose parents made the ultimate sac-
rifice serving our Nation in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. 
Finally, this bill protects Americans’ 
access to affordable healthcare during 
the global health emergency. 
Mr. Speaker, Congress took bold ac-
tion to get our country through the 
pandemic by enacting the American 
Rescue Plan. Now we must take this 
final step in the reconciliation process 
to ensure that we do not undermine 
critical programs that students and 
families urgently need. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the legislation. 
b 0930 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished ranking mem-
ber from Missouri for yielding this 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
opposition to H.R. 1868, the Democrats’ 
attempt to put a Band-Aid on their 
out-of-control spending, and this bill 
tries to remove, as the others speakers 
have said, the tough consequences of 
their continued reckless and irrespon-
sible spending. 
Last week, the Democrats passed 
their massive $2 trillion blue State 
bailout package with the intent to bur-
den future generations of Americans 
with yet another layer of crippling 
debt and inevitably higher taxes for 
years to come. 
This was yet another effort to fur-
ther use the COVID virus as an oppor-
tunity to fund their leftist expansion of 
government, climate extremism, woke 
social justice, and radical progressive 
agenda. At $2 trillion, the Pelosi bail-
out bill would spend another $6,000 per 
American citizen. This $6,000 in debt, 
per citizen, with the chance for some to 
receive a $1,400 check, is a raw deal for 
Americans. Everybody gets an IOU for 
$6,000; some people get a $1,400 check in 
return. 
Only 9 percent of the $2 trillion is 
even related to COVID relief, with the 
bulk of the spending going to fund 
these Democrat pet projects. There is 
no pressure at all on the teachers’ 
unions to even reopen the schools in re-
turn for the additional $130 billion in 
the bill, the Democrats rejected those 
commonsense amendments to require 
the schools to reopen. Only 5 percent of 
that $130 billion for schools will even 
be spent this year in 2021, that is how 
essential it is for COVID relief. 
Now Democrats are finally acknowl-
edging today that their spending is out 
of control and unsustainable, but in-
stead of seeking a true remedy for 
their problem, they are once again try-
ing to kick the can down the road and 
exempt 
their 
spending 
from 
long-
standing paygo rules. 
This new legislation would prevent 
sequestration for mandatory spending, 
which was only triggered in response to 
the reckless spending bill they passed 
last week. Their ill-conceived bill 
failed to cut funding for the unneces-
sary projects prioritized by Democrats, 
but not by the American people. 
The imminent future sequester cuts 
this new bill is intended to address 
came about as a result of the blatantly 
partisan and irresponsible bill the 
Democrats rammed through last week. 
Our national debt is now nearing $30 
trillion, an inconceivable number. It 
equates to about $90,000 per citizen. 
This amounts to an economic crisis, a 
national security crisis, and we can’t 
afford to ignore it any longer. A day of 
reckoning is coming. 
But the majority is ignoring it. Any 
semblance of fiscal discipline would 
have resulted in a COVID bill that was 
maybe 10 to 20 percent of the $2 trillion 
that was in H.R. 1319, the Pelosi blue 
State bailout. But instead, they unilat-
erally, 
on 
a 
hyperpartisan 
basis, 
rammed through the $2 trillion to sat-
isfy their left wing, and appease poorly 
run blue States and Democratic gov-
ernors. 
Our country cannot continue to af-
ford to race toward fiscal insolvency, 
and this bill allows the Democrats to 
put the pedal to the metal without con-
sequence, as we speed faster toward a 
fiscal catastrophe. Rather than truly 
helping the country, the bill enables 
Democrats’ fiscal irresponsibility. Ac-
tions like this are why Congress has 
such a low, abysmal approval rating. 
I will continue to tell my folks back 
home that I am fighting for them and 
their hard-earned tax dollars, while the 
other side wants to continue to steal 
those dollars to fund their future pet 
projects. 
Mr. Speaker, we find ourselves today 
truly in March madness, and the Demo-
crats are throwing up another air ball 
with this legislation. I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on this bill. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to remind the gentleman from Vir-
ginia that in 2017 when Republicans 
passed an almost identical amount of 
tax cuts, 83 percent of which went to 
the top 1 percent and major corpora-
tions, MITCH MCCONNELL said on the 
Senate floor: Sequestration has never 
happened, will not happen now, and 
will never happen. His words were pro-
phetic because it is not going to hap-
pen today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAL-
LONE), the distinguished chairman of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the chair of our Budget Com-
mittee, the gentleman from Kentucky. 
He really makes the point so well. 
Look, regardless of what our ranking 
member says on the other side, Amer-
ica is not in great shape, the economy 
is not good, many people have lost 
their jobs, and the reason for the 
American Rescue Plan was exactly 
that. We want to help people. We want 
to make sure people get direct cash 
payments to help them. We want to 
make sure the State and local govern-
ments get help, because they don’t 
want to be laying people off and not 
provide services during the pandemic. 
We want to help small businesses. 
The contrast between what we, as 
Democrats, push in the American Res-
cue Plan to help people in this eco-
nomic and health crisis is so vast com-
pared to what the Republicans did with 
their tax cut, which just helped the 
wealthiest and helped corporate inter-
est. It is that simple. 
So I am just going to ask my col-
leagues on the other side to put par-
tisanship aside and vote for this bill. 
This 
legislation 
includes 
non-con-
troversial policies that will truly help 
all of our constituents. It provides crit-
ical support for hospitals and rural 
health clinics and prevents cuts to 
Medicare and other important pro-
grams. 
In recent weeks, Republicans have 
claimed that any cuts to Medicare 
would be incredibly harmful. But the 
only way to make sure that these cuts 
don’t happen is passing this legislation 
today. In the past, we have always been 
able to come together to prevent these 
cuts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1592 
March 19, 2021 
When Republicans passed their $2 
trillion tax law for the wealthiest few, 
it triggered billions in mandatory cuts, 
and Congress ultimately voted to pre-
vent those cuts with Democratic sup-
port. If Republicans truly want to pro-
tect Medicare and other programs that 
support our farmers, our students, and 
the 
Nation’s 
defense, 
they 
simply 
should vote for this bill today. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to remind my 
colleagues that in addition to averting 
statutory paygo cuts, this bill provides 
additional relief specifically to front-
line healthcare providers through in-
creased Medicare payments. This is a 
policy that Congress supported mul-
tiple times. Please support this bill if 
you care. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to remind 
the gentleman from New Jersey that 
the folks in southeast Missouri, a fam-
ily of four who makes less than $55,000 
a year, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act had zero in tax liability because of 
what the Republicans passed. 
I don’t think a family of four, who 
makes $55,000 or less, is considered the 
wealthy. But apparently maybe some-
one from New Jersey might think 
someone who makes $55,000 for a family 
of four is wealthy. It is surely not in 
southeast Missouri. 
I also would like to point out that 
the gentleman from New Jersey did not 
help support in waiving this provision 
back in 2017. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, this 
bill is just the first taste of a bitter 
brew concocted by those who pushed 
through $1.9 trillion of pure deficit 
spending last week. 
Now, 
this 
measure 
involves 
our 
paygo rules. You remember paygo. The 
current version dates to 2010. In those 
days everyone was worried about a $1.3 
trillion deficit and $13 trillion of na-
tional debt. Isn’t that adorable? 
Paygo 
requires 
across-the-board 
spending cuts to offset any bill that 
spends money we don’t have. And we 
just spent a lot of money we don’t 
have. As paygo works, the first install-
ment payment for this Biden binge is 
$345 billion of spending cuts every year 
for the next 5 years, and that includes 
$52 billion in paygo and BCA cuts to 
Medicare, which is expected to go 
broke in 2024 as it is. Now, that is just 
to pay for the party the Democrats had 
the other day. So it is time to pay for 
it. 
How do you deal with a bill like that? 
Well, it is pretty simple: Just forget 
about it. Just wipe it off the books and 
start planning the next trillion-dollar 
spending spree. In fairness, that is how 
both parties have addressed paygo 
since we passed it. And the net result is 
the deficit has nearly tripled and the 
debt has more than doubled in less 
than a decade. 
At least the Republican tax cuts in 
2017 helped produce such a strong eco-
nomic recovery that our revenues went 
up. They didn’t go down. Now, that 
should have reduced our deficit, but 
our failure to control spending instead 
drove that deficit still higher. In short, 
it is the spending, stupid. 
No nation has ever spent, taxed, and 
borrowed its way to prosperity, but 
many have spent, taxed, and borrowed 
themselves into bankruptcy and ruin. 
History warns us that nations that 
bankrupt themselves aren’t around 
very long, because before you can pro-
vide for the common defense and pro-
mote the general welfare, you first 
have to be able to pay for them. 
Excessive debt saps the credit of a 
nation that is its lifeline in times of 
genuine peril. It consumes the future 
prosperity of the nation as interest 
costs swell. It saps the economic vital-
ity of our Nation by crowding out cap-
ital that would otherwise be available 
to consumers and home buyers and 
businesses. It robs the currency of its 
value, pilfering the Nation’s savings 
and their pensions. It alienates capital 
markets until interest rates rise and 
interest costs balloon into a debt spi-
ral. Once this starts, there is no way to 
stop it until the whole house of cards 
crashes down. 
Do you know want to know what 
that looks likes? It looks a lot like 
Venezuela. 
In the spring of 1945, there was seri-
ous concern whether we could continue 
the war into 1946. Bond sales were fail-
ing miserably, war taxes, spending, 
borrowing, and inflation had hollowed 
out our economy, and the Nation’s 
credit was nearing exhaustion. Now 
consider this: we are carrying a larger 
percentage of debt today than we were 
at the very end of World War II, and I 
fear how we could respond to a similar 
sustained national threat today. 
When a colleague told the great econ-
omist, Adam Smith, that a British de-
feat would be the ruin of the nation, 
Smith calmly observed: ‘‘Be assured, 
my young friend, that there is a great 
deal of ruin in a nation.’’ 
But as I look at the unprecedented 
and unsustainable debt that these poli-
cies are producing, I can’t avoid a sense 
of foreboding that our Nation is fast 
running out of ruin, and that a terrible 
day of reckoning is coming. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG), a distinguished 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, last week 
we passed the American Rescue Plan to 
help our Nation get through a COVID– 
19 public health and economic crisis. 
This historic legislation is already 
helping millions of Americans and hun-
dreds of thousands of Minnesotans. 
When I think about this piece of leg-
islation, it is widely, on a bipartisan 
basis, supported in a swing district like 
mine back in Minnesota. But if Con-
gress fails to take action—and we are 
not going to let that happen—to pre-
vent sequestration, countless Federal 
programs that our constituents rely on 
could be impacted. 
If we fail to pass H.R. 1868, cuts to 
programs at USDA could devastate 
family farmers who are already reeling 
after years of trade instability and stu-
pid trade wars. We must act because we 
cannot allow cuts to Medicare, risking 
seniors’ access to care at a time when 
they need it the most, in the midst of 
a deadly global pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this crucial 
legislation to ensure that the Federal 
Government can meet the needs of 
Minnesotans and the American people 
during a public health crisis. This body 
that I joined just over 2 years ago; this 
body has come together numerous 
times to make sure that we do not 
allow sequestration to take cuts for 
worse ideas than helping the American 
people through a public health crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
please support this bill today. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. WENSTRUP). 
b 0945 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, the 
pandemic was a problem that led some 
healthcare providers to close their 
doors. In a bipartisan way, in the pre-
vious session of Congress, we made an 
effort to fix that problem. 
Now, because of the Democrats’ irre-
sponsible spending bill, healthcare pro-
viders who are struggling will see de-
creased payments, which is the last 
thing they need right now, and it is the 
last thing we need right now. 
Medicare reimbursement rates are al-
ready low, only balanced out by non- 
Medicare payments. The better way is 
to target the funding to those who need 
it and are still working to come out of 
the pandemic. We can fill the gaps 
without adding to the deficit. 
Wasn’t the idea of a rescue to im-
prove access to care? Yet, 9 percent of 
the $1.9 trillion really went to address 
the COVID crisis. 
They bailed out failed pension funds 
without reform and ignored our doctors 
and healthcare providers on the front 
lines of the pandemic. They cut pay-
ments to caregivers. $1.9 trillion, yet 
cuts to healthcare providers during a 
pandemic. 
What Democrats are trying to do 
today is ignore the negative con-
sequences of the bill they passed ear-
lier this month. The consequences of 
the bill passed 2 weeks ago means there 
will be payment cuts to providers. 
$1.9 trillion? Someone should be 
helped in this measure, but we can do 
better. We can do better, but we 
weren’t talked to for our ideas. 
Mr. Speaker, Members should ask 
themselves: What about all of this 
today? Will the next several genera-
tions of Americans look to us and say 
thank you as they get stuck with pay-
ing our bills?

March 19, 2021 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT), who is the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Agriculture 
Committee. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an important 
and urgent activity that we are on this 
morning. Now, my Republican friends 
talked about this, but they did the 
identical, same thing in 2017 with 
President Trump’s tax cuts. What is 
good for my friends is also good for us. 
That is the way the rules are. 
Mr. Speaker, let me tell you how dev-
astating the damage would be if we do 
not act. First of all, it will cut $29 bil-
lion from badly needed programs, and 
no entity will be impacted and dev-
astated like agriculture. They will cut 
$29 billion and cut our programs for en-
ergy efficiency and rural development. 
We are working on that together. 
This bill will save our rural develop-
ment, research, specialty crop develop-
ment, and beginning and veteran farm-
er development. 
Out of the $29 billion, it will take $23 
billion out of our Commodity Credit 
Corporation, limiting our ability to 
make payments to our farmers and 
food producers at this critical time 
when we are in a hunger crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, you must understand, 
we Democrats and Republicans need to 
send a powerful message to the Nation 
on this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Georgia an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, let us move hand in hand to-
gether at this serious time. 
Now, when my friends used this, it 
was for the tax cut, most of which went 
to the wealthy. But this $23 billion cut 
to our CCC will devastate the Amer-
ican people where it hurts the most: 
their food, their water, their shelter, 
and their clothing. We must not do 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join us. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to remind the body that 
the reason we are here today is because 
of the reckless behavior. All of these 
cuts on Medicare are because House 
Democrats forced through a nearly $2 
trillion spending bill. The reason we 
have the paygo statutory provision is 
because President Obama signed it into 
law and House Democrats passed it. So 
the cuts are the result today of all the 
policies that Democrats have been 
doing since 2010. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, today, we are addressing a problem 
that didn’t even exist a week ago. It 
did not even exist last week. 
The Republicans stood on this floor 
and argued against the $1.9 trillion par-
tisan package last week. There were 
many reasons to oppose it, but one of 
the most significant reasons was the 
fact that the bill would trigger cuts to 
Medicare and other essential programs. 
We argued that it would harm all of 
our constituents. I argued that it 
would harm my constituents in Geor-
gia to my friend, my fellow delegation 
member. This bill penalized the State 
of Georgia more than any State in the 
United States. More than any State in 
the Nation, Georgia was punished. We 
lost $1.3 billion because of the funding 
formula. We didn’t shut down our 
State, and we didn’t destroy our econ-
omy, and the funding was based on the 
unemployment rate and not popu-
lation. 
Where did that $1.3 billion go? It 
went to blue States. It went to Cali-
fornia, and it went to New York. Geor-
gian taxpayers’ money went to other 
States; it went to blue States. 
What did it do to Medicare in the 
State of Georgia? We lost $11.5 billion 
that would have gone to the seniors on 
Medicare in the State of Georgia. 
Where did it go? Again, it went to 
California, and it went to New York. It 
went to the blue States. It went to the 
States that shut down their businesses 
and destroyed their economies. Yet, 
the bill was pushed forward anyway. 
This could have all been avoided al-
together. We could have crafted a bi-
partisan package that would not have 
triggered these Medicare cuts. Instead, 
those across the aisle resorted to forc-
ing a bill through reconciliation. In the 
end, they passed a package filled with 
political favors on the back of our sen-
iors. 
Again, this could have been avoided. 
But today, we need to fix this for our 
constituents who are recognizing we 
have a spending problem. 
Now that the largest stimulus bill in 
our history has been signed into law, 
our deficit for the year will also break 
records. We are now projected to have 
a Federal deficit of $3.4 trillion, and 
debt as a share of our GDP will be at 
100 percent for only the second time in 
our country’s history. 
My colleagues have shown little re-
gard for actually paying for this reck-
less spending for political favor. That 
is why I urge my colleagues to find a 
way to pay for restoring the cuts to 
Medicare. The first place I suggest 
looking for it is in the over 90 percent 
of the last package that will not go to 
addressing the pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, this is wrong, and my 
colleagues know it is wrong. Let’s get 
this fixed. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PANETTA), who is a distin-
guished member of the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise in support of H.R. 1868 to prevent 
these harmful budget cuts to vital agri-
cultural programs that are relied on by 
farmers, farmworkers, and food-inse-
cure families in all of our districts. 
If we don’t pass this bill today, $29 
billion in agricultural funding would be 
subject to these sequester cuts. Those 
types of cuts would zero out funding 
for such crucial agricultural programs 
like EQIP, the Conservation Steward-
ship Program, and the Regional Con-
servation Partnership Program. 
In my district on the mid-central 
coast of California, many farmers, 
ranchers, and forest landowners rely on 
those types of helpful programs not 
just to survive, Mr. Speaker, but to 
succeed. They use those programs to 
harvest their products and to be part of 
the climate solution. 
The producers in my district under-
stand and appreciate the old adage 
called usufruct, which basically says 
the land they use now must be kept 
fresh and fertile, not just for them, but 
for future generations. It is these pro-
grams that contribute to their current 
product and, yes, that type of forward 
thinking. 
Sequester cuts would also prevent 
the Federal Government from pur-
chasing and donating food to food 
banks through section 32 purchases. 
After the year we had, in which food 
banks contributed so much to the food 
security of so many of my constitu-
ents, we should be doing everything we 
can to protect and bolster our food pro-
grams. 
We should also be doing everything 
we can to protect the production of 
food, but sequestration cuts would 
compromise many parts of the farm 
bill, like the specialty crop block 
grants or the agricultural research ex-
tension programs at public univer-
sities. 
As the co-chair of the Congressional 
Agriculture Research Caucus, I know 
that these types of ag research pro-
grams help our farmers meet the chal-
lenges of 2021 and will allow them to 
prepare for challenges of the 21st cen-
tury. 
Mr. Speaker, as the Representative 
from the salad bowl of the world, it is 
my job to ensure that my farmers, 
farmworkers, and food-insecure fami-
lies have all the tools that they need to 
live and lead healthy and productive 
lives. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from California. 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, as Rep-
resentatives in Congress for this Na-
tion, it is all of our jobs to ensure that 
the programs for those tools and that 
food are here not just for today but to-
morrow. We can live up to that respon-
sibility by supporting H.R. 1868. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Mississippi (Mr. KELLY), who is 
the newest member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Mr. 
KELLY 
of 
Mississippi. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 
1868, the bill to prevent across-the- 
board direct spending cuts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1594 
March 19, 2021 
It should come as no surprise to my 
Democrat friends. They were told dur-
ing what little process we had in the 
$1.9 trillion spending bill that it was 
going to disproportionately hurt sen-
iors and that it was going to hurt farm-
ers. 
My friends were told this, and they 
ignored that, knowing they would have 
to fix it later and drive something just 
as irresponsible through now. 
A disproportionate share of this $2 
trillion goes to urban, poorly run, 
Democrat cities and States at the ex-
pense of our rural, blue-collar Ameri-
cans who feed, clothe, and protect 
America every day. We told my friends 
this weeks ago, and they ignored it. 
I am deeply concerned that the 
Democrats would enact a bill that adds 
$1.9 trillion to an American deficit 
without the support of a single Repub-
lican. Over 200 voting Members of this 
body had no opportunity for input into 
this massively destructive package. 
The Biden administration promised 
the American people bipartisanship 
and unity. However, they unilaterally 
drafted and pushed this bill through 
without any Republican support. 
Now, the Democrats have hastily put 
together a bill that jeopardizes the 
standing of our seniors and mortgages 
the future of our children. 
My 
colleague, 
Ranking 
Member 
SMITH, reminded the Democrats of the 
consequences of such a dramatic in-
crease in mandatory spending: a $36 
billion cut to Medicare beginning in 
2022. Democrats would rather cut bene-
fits to American seniors in rural Amer-
ica than give up checks to illegal im-
migrants and prisoners. 
The Democrats have taken advantage 
of the need of the American people. My 
colleagues are advocating for a more 
responsible alternative that would re-
move the wasteful spending of the 
Biden bailout bill and protect the most 
vulnerable population. We must cut the 
billions of liberal State bailouts and be 
sure money already authorized is spent 
responsibly. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to remind the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi, along with all the other Mem-
bers of this body, that his citizens will 
receive, in total, $900 million from just 
the $1,400 checks. That is the average 
that every congressional district is 
going to receive, and I hope that at 
some point they will realize the bene-
fits of that injection of capital into an 
economy that is struggling. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Mr. 
COURTNEY), who is a distinguished 
member of the Education and Labor 
Committee. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman of the Budget 
Committee for his and his committee 
staff’s steady hand over the last couple 
of months to make sure that the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan was enacted last 
week. 
Mr. Speaker, in that week’s time up 
to today, the American people have 
had a chance to listen to the debate 
and evaluate for themselves what they 
think of the American Rescue Plan. A 
Morning Consult poll that came out 
yesterday showed 72 percent support 
for the plan, 44 percent among Repub-
licans across the country. 
Why not? Ninety million Americans 
on Wednesday received $1,400 checks 
totaling $242 billion. For those Ameri-
cans who are not connected digitally to 
the IRS, they are going to get their 
checks through the mail. 
b 1000 
For those Americans who are filing 
their 2020 tax returns, whose income 
now qualifies them for the economic 
impact payments, they are going to re-
ceive their checks. 
On Monday, people who were on un-
employment got an extension because 
of the American Rescue Plan. These 
are working people in the service sec-
tors, in the commercial real estate sec-
tor, in most parts of the economy that 
are still hurting out there. 
Every ‘‘no’’ vote was a ‘‘no’’ vote in 
terms of people getting that critical 
economic help. 
Another vote of confidence happened 
on Wednesday, which is, the Federal 
Reserve Board met and voted to keep 
their key benchmark rate at zero, not 
just for a couple of weeks or a couple of 
months, but for the balance of 2021, for 
all of 2022, and into 2023. 
So for all of the historical arguments 
that we are overheating the economy 
and inflation is going to go up, Jerome 
Powell, Donald Trump’s nominee as 
chair of the Federal Reserve, took 
questions for over an hour on this in-
flation issue, argued, accurately, with 
a battalion of economists that they 
have at the Federal Reserve that there 
is still slack in this economy and 10 
million folks on unemployment need to 
get this type of fiscal relief that the 
American Rescue Plan responsibly tar-
geted, which is going to make sure that 
this country recovers as soon as pos-
sible. 
This is a routine bill today. We have 
done it over and over again in the last 
10 years. Vote ‘‘yes’’ and make sure 
that this economy, as the Chairman of 
the Federal Reserve advised us, gets 
the help it needs. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), one of the 
leading doctors of the Republican Con-
ference and a great member of the 
Budget Committee. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to speak in 
opposition to H.R. 1868, but I also feel 
obligated to point out that you may 
say that the inflation rate is zero, but 
if you bought a gallon of gas, pur-
chased a two-by-four at Home Depot, 
or bought a sack of Quikrete at Lowe’s, 
you would know that inflation is a real 
phenomenon. 
But I do rise in opposition to H.R. 
1868. There was no effort made on the 
part of the majority party to work 
with Republicans on what should be a 
bipartisan priority, and that is pro-
vider relief. 
I have heard from physicians and I 
have heard from hospitals in Texas 
that struggled financially throughout 
the pandemic. But the bill we have be-
fore us today is simply an excuse to 
wipe out the scorecard of the fiscal im-
pact of this $1.9 trillion partisan pack-
age passed last week. 
Last week, Republicans warned that 
this would threaten cuts to Medicare, 
but those warnings were repeatedly ig-
nored. If the House majority really 
cared, if the House Democrats really 
cared about meaningful healthcare pro-
vider relief, they would have worked to 
gain Republican support, worked with 
us to build a bill from the ground up. 
Instead, this bill is coming toward us 
as a Hail Mary pass right before the 
Medicare sequester cuts go into effect 
in April. 
As a physician, I have deep empathy 
for those whose medical practices have 
been impacted and are now struggling 
to stay open. I know I have helped 
many doctors, many clinics, navigate 
the Provider Relief Fund over this past 
year. We need targeted relief for the 
providers who are hurting, and some 
are hurting more than others. 
I am a cosponsor of H.R. 1999, which 
is an alternative approach that adds 
over $12 billion to the Provider Relief 
Fund and ensures that dollars would 
flow to those doctors who have experi-
enced lost revenue or increased cost. 
This type of financial relief has al-
ready 
been 
proven 
successful. 
We 
passed the CARES Act on March 27 of 
last year. We know it’s successful. 
Additionally, this alternative bill en-
sures that the 4 percent cut to Medi-
care providers that was included in last 
week’s reconciliation bill as a result of 
statutory paygo does not go into effect 
in 2022. 
The American Rescue Plan Act gifted 
$350 billion to State and local govern-
ments that simply was not justified. 
Providers in our State and local com-
munities are worthy of funding and 
they should specifically benefit from 
those State and local dollars that are 
not necessary to go where they are 
planned to go. That is why we would 
like to redirect the State and local 
funding toward provider relief. 
Maintaining 
a 
strong 
healthcare 
workforce is critical to the health of 
this Nation during normal times, and 
it is especially critical during a public 
health emergency. 
We should work together on the right 
policy solution to deliver this relief to 
ensure that it stands a chance of actu-
ally passing in the other body, and that 
should be a starting point for those dis-
cussions. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope we can come to 
such a sensible solution. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Illinois 
(Ms. 
SCHA-
KOWSKY), a distinguished member of 
the Budget Committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1595 
March 19, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
am proud to cosponsor H.R. 1868 to pre-
vent arbitrary cuts to Medicare and to 
ensure that the American Rescue Plan 
is treated in the same way as previous 
coronavirus bills have been treated, in-
cluding the CARES Act. 
This legislation, as we all know, this 
fix is needed to avoid painful cuts to 
our mandatory spending programs. And 
let’s remember—the hypocrisy is over-
whelming here—that the Democrats 
voted with Republicans in 2017 to avoid 
Medicare cuts as a result of the Repub-
lican’s tax scam, a $2 trillion tax cut, 
that went mostly to the wealthy. 
Our healthcare workers have been 
working nonstop for over a year fight-
ing this pandemic. They do not deserve 
a cut in Medicare payments for taking 
care of seniors and people with disabil-
ities. 
By removing the sequester, we can 
ensure that providers keep their doors 
open and they can continue to treat 
their patients. 
Though Republicans voted against 
the American Rescue Plan, which they 
shouldn’t have, I sincerely hope that 
today they will join us and vote to pro-
tect these programs that enjoy broad 
bipartisan public support and ensure 
that our commitment to our Nation’s 
seniors and people with disabilities are 
met during this public health crisis. 
Especially now, we need to be work-
ing together, as we did for the Repub-
licans. When the Republicans were giv-
ing tax cuts to the wealthiest Ameri-
cans, we were not going to let Medicare 
suffer. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to remind the gentle-
woman from Illinois that actions speak 
louder than words, and that the Demo-
crats did not help the folks in 2017, 
since the gentlewoman tried to point 
out the hypocrisy. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, to the gentlewoman’s 
point about working together, Demo-
crats did not offer a hand of bipartisan-
ship in this ram-and-jam job on the $2 
trillion bailout bill. They even lost 
Democrats on it. So they didn’t work 
with us. 
It was a pure partisan play, and there 
is a reason for that. It is mostly unre-
lated to COVID. It is bailout galore. It 
is a wish list of the liberals in this 
House, and they just pushed it through 
and called it, in disguise, COVID relief. 
But the fundamental principle we are 
talking about today is paygo. This is a 
law passed by Democrats, signed by a 
Democrat 
President. 
It 
says, 
fun-
damentally—and the American people 
understand this—if you spend beyond 
your means, you have got to find a way 
to pay for it. You have got to offset it 
or you go into debt. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people, if 
they don’t pay their bills, they get 
their water turned off or their elec-
tricity turned off. The IRS will hunt 
them down and put them in jail if they 
don’t pay their taxes. They will have 
their mortgage foreclosed, their cars 
repossessed. That is what happens to 
the American people when they don’t 
pay their bills. 
President Obama, when he signed the 
law, said, You can’t spend a dollar un-
less you cut a dollar elsewhere. I agree 
with him. 
Ms. PELOSI, our Speaker, gave a 
speech and she gave glowing points as 
she embraced wholeheartedly and full- 
throatedly this paygo. She said it is 
important ‘‘ . . . to our fiscal sound-
ness, and to our children and grand-
children.’’ 
She said: ‘‘ . . . who could oppose this 
great idea?’’ 
She went on to say: ‘‘ . . . invest-
ments in our children’s future . . . 
must be paid for, or else we are heaping 
debt onto our children.’’ 
The national debt is almost $30 tril-
lion and counting. 
Who is going to pay for that? 
Not us. Not you. Our kids are going 
to pay for it. 
These are Ms. PELOSI’s words, Mr. 
Speaker: ‘‘This pay-as-you-go is part of 
a blueprint for fiscal responsibility. 
. . . ’’ 
She said: ‘‘ . . . subjecting spending 
to the harshest scrutiny. Every Federal 
dollar that is spent must be subjected 
to scrutiny to make sure taxpayers get 
his or her money’s worth.’’ 
Bailing out union pensions, giving 
cities and States money that horribly 
mismanaged their business prior to 
COVID, giving people more money to 
be on unemployment than they made 
in their previous jobs, paying people 
who are not economically harmed in 
this COVID disaster, all of these things 
are wasteful. There is a litany of 
wasteful, irresponsible, and unneces-
sary spending, hundreds of billions of 
dollars. 
And the Speaker is saying every dol-
lar is going to be scrutinized. We are 
going to stick it to our seniors. We are 
going to stick it to our kids. That is a 
profile in courage, if I ever saw one. 
Now, that is the leadership that made 
this country great, Mr. Speaker. These 
are Ms. PELOSI’s words, not mine, but I 
agree with her. 
We have an opportunity here to do 
the right thing by our children, to off-
set the spending here in this $2 trillion 
bailout with the wasteful spending that 
is in there. And I gave you a list, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I plead with you and I 
plead with my colleagues to offset this 
and do right by our kids and their fu-
ture in this country. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time remains 
on both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky has 111⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Missouri has 11⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), 
a distinguished member of the Budget 
Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank our distinguished chairman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, whenever you hear the 
words of Speaker PELOSI, you know 
that the gentlewoman is leading us on 
the fight to protect our seniors. I am 
glad to cosponsor this legislation to be 
a strong supporter of being on the front 
seat of protecting our seniors. 
Whenever 
you 
hear 
us 
being 
demagogued from those on the other 
side using demagoguery, you can be as-
sured that when they pass a tax bill, it 
was not having seniors as their pri-
ority. But when you hear the word 
‘‘Medicare,’’ you know that Democrats 
are standing strong to make sure that 
not one dime is taken away from our 
seniors with Medicare. 
My open letter to my seniors in my 
district—open message to my seniors 
is: We will die on the vine to protect 
your Medicare. That is what we are 
doing today on the floor of the House. 
Not one dime will come out of your 
Medicare. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
H.R. 1868, which excludes the budgetary 
effects of the American Rescue Plan of 
2021 from scorecards established by the 
Pay-As-You-Go, or PAYGO Act of 2010, 
preventing across-the-board cuts to nu-
merous direct-spending programs. That 
is what we are doing here today. We 
are taking our seniors seriously. 
I say to seniors: Have no fear with all 
of this demagoguery because we are 
going to make sure that not one dime 
comes out of your pocket. 
In addition, I say to seniors: You are 
going to be living in cities like Hous-
ton, where it says that Houston’s share 
of the stimulus package is $615 million. 
That is going to help keep the city 
services going, the fire, the police, and 
trash pickup going. We know that sen-
iors call my office and these issues are 
important to them. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a Houston Chronicle article dated 
March 10, 2021, showing that the city of 
Houston will receive $615 million. 
[From the Houston Chronicle, Mar. 10, 2021] 
HOUSTON’S
SHARE
OF
STIMULUS
BILL
EX-
PECTED TO TOP $600M, HELP AVOID CUTS TO 
CITY SERVICES, OFFICIALS SAY 
(By Jasper Scherer) 
Houston and Harris County are expected to 
receive more than $1.5 billion through the 
stimulus bill approved by Congress Wednes-
day, providing a massive cash injection that 
city officials say will help close a budget 
shortfall widened by the pandemic for the 
second year in a row. 
The measure provides local governments 
with their most generous round of COVID-re-
lated funding yet, and it comes with fewer 
spending restrictions than last year’s aid. 
Houston will receive an estimated $615 mil-
lion, putting the city at more than $1 billion 
in direct federal relief during the pandemic, 
while Harris County is projected to receive 
$914 million—more than double its allotment 
from the first round of local aid last March. 
‘‘I’m hopeful and optimistic that we will be 
able to use this money to, essentially, bail

the city out of a very dire financial situa-
tion,’’ said City Controller Chris Brown, who 
monitors the spending of Houston’s more 
than $5 billion city budget. 
Many local governments, including Hous-
ton, have seen their sales tax revenues plum-
met as the pandemic slowed consumer spend-
ing on dining, tourism and other leisure ac-
tivity. And while rising appraisal values 
mean the city is projected to take in more 
money from property taxes this year than 
last, officials say the pandemic’s true toll on 
property tax revenue may not be felt until 
early 2022, when homeowners make pay-
ments for this year’s not-yet-certified tax 
rolls. 
Much to the relief of local officials, the 
latest round of federal aid allows cities and 
counties to spend the funds to replace rev-
enue lost due to the pandemic. Trump ad-
ministration rules barred local governments 
from using the first round of local COVID re-
lief to plug budget holes, stipulating it could 
only cover expenses tied directly to the pan-
demic, though Mayor Sylvester Turner’s ad-
ministration still was able to use the funds 
to avoid furloughing city employees. 
Marvin Odum, the former Shell executive 
appointed by the mayor to oversee the city’s 
COVID recovery, said Wednesday he is ‘‘very 
optimistic the funds will be able to be used 
to mitigate the city’s budget shortfalls re-
sulting from COVID–19.’’ Still, he noted that 
beyond the broad language in the bill, fed-
eral officials have yet to release specific 
rules for how local governments can spend 
the funds. 
‘‘I’ll just caution that clarity on the guide-
lines for these programs tends to come over 
time. 
It’s 
not 
always 
available 
imme-
diately,’’ Odum said. 
Republican lawmakers bitterly opposed 
the local aid, including Senate Minority 
Leader Mitch McConnell, who accused Demo-
crats of sending ‘‘wheelbarrows of cash to 
state and local bureaucrats to bail out mis-
management from before the pandemic.’’ 
Meanwhile, local officials across the country 
have warned they would have to enact deep 
cuts to city services, such as fire, police and 
trash collection, without federal aid to offset 
their revenue losses. 
‘‘Every mayor, every county judge, every 
local official that I visited with since before 
December, they all need help,’’ said U.S. Rep. 
Sylvia Garcia, D–Houston, a former Houston 
controller and county commissioner. ‘‘Every 
city in America will get dollars to help with 
their revenue shortfalls. And that’s huge, be-
cause they can keep the firefighters working, 
they can keep police departments open, they 
can get the garbage picked up.’’ 
Even before the pandemic, Houston offi-
cials in recent years have scrambled to close 
major city budget gaps, often dipping into 
reserves to balance spending and revenue. 
The city’s public safety costs, which make 
up more than half of spending on core serv-
ices, have steadily increased as the budget 
remains capped by a limit on how much 
property tax revenue the city can take in 
each year. 
‘‘It’s going to solve, in the short term, 
some of these problems, but the real chal-
lenge is, you cannot solve a structural prob-
lem with one-time financing sources,’’ Brown 
said. ‘‘You actually have to do the hard work 
to cut recurring expenses. And that’s the 
only way you can narrow that budget gap 
over time.’’ 
Local governments will receive half their 
federal aid within 60 days of Friday, when 
President Joe Eiden will sign the bill into 
law, according to White House press sec-
retary Jen Psaki. They will receive the sec-
ond half of the funds at least a year later. 
That means Houston will receive more 
than $300 million to offset its revenue losses 
next fiscal year, along with any potential 
shortfall before the current fiscal year ends 
June 30. Odum said the city finance depart-
ment is projecting a budget gap of between 
$160 and $200 million next year, while 
Brown—whose office generates its own esti-
mates separate from Turner’s administra-
tion—said he expects the shortfall to be even 
higher. 
Brown noted that while finance depart-
ment projections assume the city will see a 
less-than-1 percent reduction in sales tax 
revenue this year, the actual decrease has 
been 7 percent. 
‘‘The (Turner) administration, I don’t 
think, has properly evaluated the reductions 
in sales and property tax,’’ Brown said. 
‘‘There’s a $40 million variance between us 
and (the) finance (department) in sales tax 
alone.’’ 
Brown estimated city officials will have to 
lay off about a dozen city employees for 
every $1 million trimmed from the budget, 
meaning Houston could have been looking at 
more than 2,000 layoffs without any federal 
aid. 
Instead, Houston’s relief will far exceed its 
budget deficit. The city also is expected to 
devote a chunk of the aid to direct COVID 
relief, such as testing and vaccinations. 
Turner’s administration exhausted the pre-
vious round of aid, totaling $405 million, in 
December. Those funds covered contact trac-
ing efforts, city workers whose jobs were 
consumed by COVID, and relief to renters 
and small businesses, among other areas. 
Turner, who proposes the annual budget to 
city council each year, did not respond to 
questions Wednesday about how he intends 
to spend the new round of relief aid. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me 
also 
indicate 
that 
seniors’ 
healthcare will be in a good place with 
this particular program. Their grand-
children will be able to go back to 
school with almost $1 billion to the 
Houston Independent School District. 
Seniors’ stimulus checks are not 
going to be ignored. They are going to 
be able to get stimulus checks directly 
into 
their 
accounts. 
Their 
grand-
children, their children will get $3,600 
for a 5-year-old. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, they will get $3,000 for 
children above 9 years old. There will 
be enhanced unemployment for the 
young people in their lives who have 
been unemployed. And then, of course, 
that local restaurant will be able—and 
I fought for this—to be open again with 
$28 billion. 
The issue of public assistance or local 
government assistance was something I 
was allowed to offer a motion to in-
struct on. It was something that I 
thought we could not abandon. We will 
not abandon seniors. We will not let 
them touch one dime of Medicare, as 
our friends on the other side have. 
Vote for this legislation because we 
are seniors first. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, on the Budget, and as the Member 
of Congress for a congressional district that 
has experience the worst of the COVID–19 as 
a public health emergency and economic ca-
tastrophe, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
1868, which excludes the budgetary effects of 
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, from 
the scorecards established by the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Act of 2010, pre-
venting across-the-board cuts to numerous di-
rect spending programs. 
The legislation also excludes the budgetary 
effects of this Act from the Senate PAYGO 
scorecards. 
This legislation is necessary to ensure that 
that Medicare and other programs are pro-
tected from PAYGO sequestration. 
The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act requires 
across-the-board cuts, known as ‘‘sequestra-
tion,’’ to a defined set of programs if certain 
legislation affecting mandatory spending or 
revenues increases net deficits. 
Although legislation that Congress des-
ignates as an emergency or otherwise ex-
cludes from the PAYGO scorecard does not 
trigger sequestration, this action is necessary 
because restrictions on the content of rec-
onciliation bills prevented the American Res-
cue Plan Act of 2021 from including a provi-
sion to avert sequestration. 
The bill before also extends a separate 
Medicare sequester relief provision, first en-
acted in the CARES Act, that expires March 
31, 
Mr. Speaker, Congress has never permitted 
sequestration to affect the Medicare trust fund 
and it certainly will not allow it now, just when 
help is arriving under the American Rescue 
Plan Act to put shots in arms, money in pock-
ets, kids in school, and workers back on the 
job. 
It is worthwhile to explain why the American 
Rescue Plan Act is the most transformative 
legislation in more than a half century and 
easily justifies exclusion from sequestration. 
H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act, 
is a landmark, life-saving legislation that will 
provide urgently-needed resources to defeat 
the virus, put vaccines in people’s arms, 
money into families’ pockets, children safely 
back into classrooms, and people back to 
work. 
With tens of millions of Americans infected, 
more than half a million lives lost, over 18 mil-
lion Americans unemployed and millions more 
hungry and food and housing insecure, thanks 
to the work of congressional Democrats in the 
House and Senate and the Biden Administra-
tion, at long last the people of the United 
States and my home state of Texas can be 
assured that ‘Help Is On The Way.’ 
In simple terms this life-saving and life-en-
hancing legislation puts vaccines in arms, puts 
money in people’s pockets, puts children safe-
ly back in school, and it will put workers back 
in jobs. 
1. Put Vaccines in Arms: The plan will 
mount a national vaccination program that in-
cludes setting up community vaccination sites 
nationwide and addressing disparities facing 
communities of color. It will also take com-
plementary measures to combat the virus, in-
cluding scaling up testing and tracing, ad-
dressing shortages of personal protective 
equipment and other critical supplies, investing 
in high-quality treatments, and addressing 
health care disparities. 
2. Put Money in People’s Pockets: The plan 
finishes the job on the President’s promise to 
provide $2,000 in direct assistance to house-
holds across America with checks of $1,400

per person, following the $600 down payment 
enacted in December. The plan will also pro-
vide direct housing assistance, nutrition assist-
ance for 40 million Americans, expand access 
to safe and reliable child care and affordable 
health care, extend unemployment insurance 
so that 18 million American workers can pay 
their bills and support 27 million children with 
an expanded Child Tax Credit and more than 
17 million low-wage workers through an im-
proved Earned Income Tax Credit. 
3. Put Children Safely Back in School: The 
plan delivers $170 billion for education and 
$45 billion for childcare providers. This in-
cludes a $130 billion investment in K–12 
school re-opening and making up for lost time 
in the classroom, with funds that can be used 
for such things as reducing class sizes, modi-
fying spaces so that students and teachers 
can socially distance, improving ventilation, 
implementing more mitigation measures, pro-
viding personal protective equipment and pro-
viding summer school or other support for stu-
dents that help make up lost learning time this 
year. The plan also provides more than $40 
billion for higher education. 
Here is what the American Rescue Plan Act 
means for the State of Texas, Houston, and 
Harris County. 
An estimated $16.7 billion will come to the 
State of Texas. 
The lion’s share of $3.3 billion will come di-
rectly to the City of Houston, and Harris Coun-
ty will receive a similar share of $5.667 billion, 
thanks to a provision in the law I helped se-
cure that created the Coronavirus Local Fiscal 
Recovery Fund and appropriated $45.57 bil-
lion. 
$1.4 billion in direct payments is allocated to 
smaller jurisdiction like Jacinto City. 
Houston Independent School District can 
expect to receive close to $100 million 
($993,198 million to be more precise). 
The law specifically allows this funding to be 
used: 
1. To respond to the pandemic or its nega-
tive economic impacts, including assistance to 
households, small businesses, and nonprofits, 
or aid to impacted industries such as tourism, 
travel, and hospitality; 
2. For premium pay to eligible workers per-
forming essential work (as determined by each 
recipient government) during the pandemic, 
providing up to $13 per hour above regular 
wages; 
3. For the provision of government services 
to the extent of the reduction in revenue due 
to the pandemic (relative to revenues collected 
in the most recent full fiscal year); and 
4. To make necessary investments in water, 
sewer, or broadband infrastructure. 
In addition to these funds, Texas will receive 
$100 million out of the newly created $10 bil-
lion Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund for 
‘‘critical capital projects directly enabling work, 
education, and health monitoring, including re-
mote options, in response to the public health 
emergency with respect to the Coronavirus 
Disease. 
Now all that is well and good but let me tell 
you what the American Rescue Plan Act 
means for a hard-working and hard-pressed 
single mother of two children making a modest 
income: 
Stimulus checks: $1,400 × 3 = $4,200 
Child tax credit: $3,600 (5-year-old) + 
$3,000 (9-year-old) = $6,600. Half of that 
amount will be paid out periodically from late 
July through December; the rest will come as 
a check with next year’s taxes. 
Enhanced unemployment: If the parent be-
comes unemployed in March, she will be eligi-
ble for $300 in aid every week through the last 
week of August. 
Total: $10,800 from stimulus and tax credits, 
plus another $7,500 from 25–weeks of en-
hanced unemployment aid. This individual 
would also receive $318 per week in state un-
employment aid and thousands more from the 
Earned Income Tax Credit. 
RESTAURANTS 
Finally, let me discuss briefly the good 
things for the restaurant industry that are in 
the American Rescue Plan Act. 
The law allocates $28 billion in funds to 
devastated food service establishments, in-
cluding bars, and food trucks, and vendors. 
Unlike the Paycheck Protection Program, 
which saddled restaurants with burdensome 
loans if the bulk of the funds were not spent 
on payroll, these restaurant relief dollars are 
grants, plain and simple. 
Grant sizes will generally be determined by 
subtracting lower 2020 pandemic-era receipts 
from higher 2019 gross receipts. 
Over $5 billion will be set aside for smaller 
venues whose annual gross receipts were 
below $500,000, leaving $23.6 billion for ev-
eryone else. 
Grants will be capped at $10 million for res-
taurant groups and $5 million for individual 
venues. 
Publicly traded companies or restaurants 
with more than 20 locations will not be eligible 
to participate in this funding. 
And, for the first 21 days, establishments 
owned by women, veterans, or economically 
and socially disadvantaged groups will be 
prioritized. 
This transformative legislation will also pro-
vide direct housing assistance, nutrition assist-
ance for 40 million Americans, expand access 
to safe and reliable child care and affordable 
health care, extend unemployment insurance 
so that 18 million American workers can pay 
their bills and support 27 million children with 
an expanded Child Tax Credit and more than 
17 million low-wage childless workers through 
an improved Earned Income Tax Credit, which 
will reduce the number of children living in 
poverty in America by 50 percent. 
I want to commend my colleagues and 
House Speaker NANCY PELOSI for her leader-
ship and President Biden for signing into law 
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, and I 
urge all Members to join me in voting to pass 
H.R. 1868, which excludes the budgetary ef-
fects of the American Rescue Plan Act from 
the scorecards established by the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Act of 2010, and 
thus precludes the implementation of direct 
across the board cuts in spending. 
b 1015 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. DOGGETT), a distinguished member 
of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, 55 years 
ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson 
overcame sustained Republican opposi-
tion to enact Medicare. It has been a 
literal lifeline for millions. Those who 
suffered 
without 
healthcare 
before 
Medicare now have access to a family 
physician and hospital care when they 
need it. 
Former Republican Speaker Newt 
Gingrich, in this very room, plotted to 
let Medicare wither on the vine. Mil-
lions of Americans would have with-
ered had he been successful. Yet, gen-
erations of Republicans have sought to 
privatize it, cut it, or weaken it. Sure-
ly, some of the strongest evidence of 
the success of Medicare, through all of 
these times, is the claim by today’s Re-
publicans that after so many failed at-
tempts to weaken Medicare, they are 
here, quite amazingly, claiming to be 
its new protectors. 
Of course, this comes following their 
understandable desperation to justify 
their inexplicable efforts to deny the 
relief that was offered by the American 
Rescue Plan: the survivor benefits; the 
unemployment; the small business and 
rental assistance so vitally needed; the 
support for getting our students back 
in school, the funding to keep State 
and local employees doing their jobs. 
Republicans have resisted that rescue 
plan with the same fervor that they re-
sisted Medicare in the first place. So 
determined are these folks to oppose 
anything that President Biden ad-
vances, they have come out here and 
claimed that the rescue plan means 
Medicare cuts, which certainly it does 
not. 
Most of Medicare falls within the ju-
risdiction of the Ways and Means 
Health Subcommittee, which I chair. 
We do need to strengthen Medicare. 
The latest financial report suggests 
that additional revenues will be needed 
to sustain Medicare beginning in 2026. 
Some of the changes that are needed 
are largely accounting adjustments, 
and others will require additional rev-
enue. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Texas. 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, what 
our colleagues should be doing is com-
ing together to work with us to ensure 
the permanent security of Medicare. 
Medicare works, but after 55 years, it 
needs some updates. It has not pro-
vided 
adequate 
protection 
against 
pharmaceutical price gouging; it does 
not cover most of dental, hearing, and 
vision care; and, of course, too many 
Americans are just too young to ben-
efit from Medicare. 
I believe we need to be working to-
gether to make Medicare better and 
more widely available to more Ameri-
cans, because health security is Amer-
ican security. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Il-
linois (Mrs. BUSTOS), a distinguished 
member of the Committee on Agri-
culture and Committee on Appropria-
tions. 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to support H.R. 1868. I know we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1598 
March 19, 2021 
have talked this morning about the im-
portance of the bill protecting Medi-
care. I want to talk with you for a cou-
ple of minutes here about its protec-
tion of farm supports and other direct 
spending as it pertains to our family 
farmers. 
As chair of the Subcommittee on 
General Farm Commodities and Risk 
Management, this bill will protect crit-
ical resources like the Commodity 
Credit Corporation, resources that our 
family farmers depend on now more 
than ever. 
There are nearly 2 million farmers 
across our Nation. In the district that 
I serve, we have close to 10,000 family 
farms. But throughout our Nation, 
there is no farm that isn’t touched by 
the Commodity Credit Corporation, not 
one American farmer who wouldn’t be 
impacted by these cuts. In the district 
I serve, those close to 10,000 family 
farmers would have fewer resources if 
this were to happen and would face 
challenges as they try to pay their bills 
and put food on the table. 
The truth is, our family farmers have 
seen an onslaught of challenges for 
years, each year worse than the one be-
fore it: extreme weather conditions; 
devastated crops; unstable and uncer-
tain trade markets that held back ex-
ports 
and 
economic 
growth; 
and 
throughout the past year, a global pan-
demic that has left many of our farm-
ers ravaged, even as they kept fighting 
for fellow Americans, to keep them fed. 
COVID–19 has impacted all of us. But, 
thankfully, we have never truly seen 
empty store shelves. We have our 
American farmers to thank for that. 
We have our American farmers to 
thank for the stable food supply and 
for the certainty that, even after years 
of challenges, even at the height of this 
worldwide crisis, our American farmers 
have had our backs. Now, it is time for 
us to have theirs. 
A vote against this bill is a vote to 
cut farm funding. I urge my colleagues 
to vote to protect our family farmers 
and vote ‘‘yes’’ on this critical bill. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I am prepared 
to close. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I 
have introduced an alternative, a more 
responsible approach that protects our 
seniors and rolls back some of the most 
wasteful and absurd parts of the Demo-
cratic bailout bill. 
I would encourage my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to put Amer-
ica’s seniors ahead of their special in-
terest allies. Join us in finding a solu-
tion that protects and respects Amer-
ica’s seniors and the working class. We 
will offer such a solution as a motion 
to recommit. If adopted, it will in-
struct the Budget Committee to con-
sider an amendment to make the sen-
sible cuts in waste offered in H.R. 1999, 
the Protect Seniors and Cut Waste Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of this amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
let’s put the healthcare of our seniors 
ahead of prisoners, illegal immigrants, 
and the political class. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the last couple of 
months have been an incredibly busy 
time. The work that was done on the 
American Rescue Plan, from start to 
finish, was extraordinary, and we owe 
our staffs an enormous debt of grati-
tude, and not just the Budget Com-
mittee staff, but the staff of the 12 
committees that also contributed to 
the drafting of the American Rescue 
Plan. 
I would like to take this time to read 
the names of the Budget Committee 
staff who pulled all-nighters, all-week-
enders, and went way beyond the call 
of duty in doing the work on the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan: 
Erika Appel, Ellen Balis, Samantha 
Carter, Edward Etzkorn, Jose Guillen, 
Jocelyn Harris, Emily King, Sarah Lee, 
Sheila 
McDowell, 
Diana 
Meredith, 
Leyla Mocan, Kimberly Overbeek, Bar-
bara Pike, Katie Raymond, Scott Rus-
sell, Laura Santos, Raquel Spencer, 
Greg 
Waring, 
Alexandra 
Weinroth, 
Christie 
Wentworth, 
Jennifer 
Wheelock, Sam Wice, Ted Zegers, and 
Grady Stevens. I want to thank all of 
them personally for their work on be-
half of the House. 
In closing, Mr. Speaker, I just want 
to say this: You know, we have heard a 
lot of newly found concern about the 
deficit and the debt today. We heard it 
during the debates. This is the same 
party that drove up the deficit 3 years 
ago, 4 years ago now, with a $2 trillion 
tax cut, most of which benefitted the 
wealthiest Americans, and, according 
to virtually everyone who has looked 
at it, didn’t even come close to paying 
for itself. 
What we have done in the American 
Rescue Plan is give an incredible boost 
to the American people, the American 
people who need the boost most. Not 
one dollar in the American Rescue 
Plan goes to the top 1 percent of Amer-
icans. The vast majority goes to 
middle- and lower-income people strug-
gling to get by. 
I am kind of amused when people 
talk about their States being cheated. 
The gentleman from Georgia talked 
about how Georgia was cheated. Under 
the American Rescue Plan, Georgia 
gets over $8 billion, twice as much as 
Georgia got under the CARES Act. 
That doesn’t even count all of the 
money that is going to the Georgia 
citizens. 
As I said, in every congressional dis-
trict in this country, on average, the 
people, the citizens we represent, will 
get $900 million, every congressional 
district. 
My friend from Missouri talked about 
his family of four. I know his math is 
better than this, but a family of four 
doesn’t get $1,400, as he mentioned. A 
family of four gets $1,400 times four, 
which is $5,600, and then two children, 
depending on their ages, get at least 
$3,000 each. So that family of four is 
going to get $11,000 out of this bill. 
The talk about future generations, I 
love that. You know, I am sure that 
when the national debt reached $1 bil-
lion under Abraham Lincoln, there 
were people saying: ‘‘Wow, we are lay-
ing an incredible burden on our grand-
children.’’ When it reached $1 trillion 
under Ronald Reagan, I am sure there 
were people saying the same thing. And 
when it gets to $50 trillion, as it prob-
ably will in the next couple of decades, 
people will be saying the same thing. 
We have been accumulating debt for 
our entire history, and yet no one has 
ever been asked to pay for that debt, 
and no one ever will. 
So all in all, we are very proud of the 
American Rescue Plan. The American 
people love the American Rescue Plan. 
This fix, which we ask for today, is 
something that, again, is just what the 
Republicans asked to do in 2017. It is a 
routine measure. Nobody wants to cut 
Medicare to providers and certainly 
benefits to our citizens. I am sure we 
will have a bipartisan vote on this 
today, and I urge all of my colleagues 
to support H.R. 1868. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 233, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and the third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows:

the provider for the payment and the eligible 
health care provider shall have a valid tax 
identification number. 
(9) For any reimbursement by the Sec-
retary from the Provider Relief Fund to an 
eligible health care provider that is a sub-
sidiary of a parent organization, the parent

fers or otherwise) all or any portion of such

nues using the Frequently Asked Questions

vider’s budgeted and actual revenue budget if 
such budget had been established and ap-
proved prior to March 27, 2020.

coronavirus. 
(12) Not later than 3 years after final pay-
ments are made under this section, the Of-
fice of Inspector General of the Department 
of Health and Human Services shall transmit 
a final report on audit findings with respect 
to this program to the Committees on Ap-
propriations of the House of Representatives 
and the Senate. 
(13) Nothing in this section limits the au-
thority of the Inspector General or the

RECOGNIZING LATRICE POWELL 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I take this brief moment to salute 
Latrice Powell. We are humbled by her 
service. I wear on my jacket Lady 
Freedom. I would argue that Latrice 
Powell is our Sojourner Truth because 
she is a pioneer and has made an enor-
mous difference in this House, that is 
the people’s House. She truly is a rep-
resentative of the people. With that in 
mind, I thank her so very much for all 
that she has done. 
Madam Speaker, I must take this 
separate moment again, as she knows, 
to honor those who died in Atlanta, to 
honor them for the vile way in which 
they lost their lives; to say that those 
women, Asian-American women, really 
were the victims of hate crimes. Why? 
Because women gender can be a hate 
crime. 
Madam Speaker, and I would only 
say to my colleague—a friend of mine, 
yes, from Texas—in the midst of pain, 
to talk about a rope and an oak tree as 
a tradition of Texas, lynching, is ab-
surd, unacceptable, and I denounce. 
I apologize for any hurt that was 
given to the Asian-American commu-
nity, and I ask my colleague to apolo-
gize. 
Madam Speaker, I ask us to join to-
gether against hate crimes.

IN MEMORY OF MITCH STONE 
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in memory of Mitch Stone. 
He was a University of Cincinnati foot-
ball superfan, and he was an inspira-
tional young man who passed away 
years after his battle with brain can-
cer. 
In 2009, at age 11, Mitch Stone was di-
agnosed with a malignant brain tumor. 
The Cincinnati Bearcats football team 
took Mitch in as one of their own and

saw him through his treatments. Mitch 
found strength and support through the 
UC Bearcats football team, and they 
found strength in him. 
Mitch went on to attend the Univer-
sity of Cincinnati, where he earned a 
bachelor’s degree in 2020. He was a 
Kolodzik Business Scholar, an honors 
program at the Carl H. Lindner College 
of Business. Mitch used his experience 
to start his own foundation called 
Mitch’s Mission, which helped children 
overcome their own health challenges. 
Mitch’s death is a tragedy that we 
continue to mourn, but his life is a tes-
timony to the good in this world. His 
legacy and the positive effects of his 
works will live on. 
Rest in peace, Mitch.

AMERICA’S KIDS DESERVE 
BETTER 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, before COVID–19 more than 40 
percent of San Diego kids were already 
living in families experiencing poverty. 
Childhood poverty was a problem be-
fore COVID–19, and we know it has only 
worsened 
through 
this 
pandemic. 
America’s kids deserve better. 
That is why I was so proud to fight 
for them through the American Rescue 
Plan and so proud to see the bill signed 
into law last week. 
The American Rescue Plan makes 
historic investments to increase the 
child 
tax 
credit 
and 
support 
our 
childcare infrastructure to help work-
ing families and our care workers. 
These 
investments 
will 
be 
trans-
formational, cutting childhood poverty 
in half and lifting a heavy burden off 
the shoulders of so many parents. 
Today, I celebrate this progress. And, 
today, I commit myself to working to 
support the 5 million American chil-
dren who will still experience poverty. 
Let’s make the child tax credit in-
creases permanent. Let’s revitalize our 
childcare infrastructure, and let’s do 
right by America’s kids. 
f 
LAND BELONGING TO THE 
WINNEBAGO 
(Mr. FORTENBERRY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, my district in Nebraska is home to 
many Native American Tribes, includ-
ing the Winnebago in the northeast 
corner of the State. And it is nestled, 
Madam Speaker, along the Missouri 
River Bottoms at the beginning of the 
great plains in a beautiful setting of 
rolling hills. This Tribal land has been 
an integral part of Nebraska’s history 
and culture. 
But several decades ago, land belong-
ing to the Winnebago was appropriated 
by the Army Corps of Engineers for de-
velopment. In 1976, a Federal court 
found that the United States and the 
Corps lacked the authority to take this 
land through eminent domain. 
It is time to make this right. So the 
Winnebago Land Transfer Act is an im-
portant bill to return to the Winnebago 
this piece of land. 
Hunters will be able to continue to 
enjoy this prime spot along the Mis-
souri River through the Winnebago 
Tribe, Wildlife, and Parks program. 
I am appreciative of the bipartisan 
effort here of our colleagues, DARREN 
SOTO
of Florida, SHARICE
DAVIDS
of 
Kansas, as well as RANDY FEENSTRA of 
Iowa, to once again make this right. 
f 
LIFELINE TO SMALL BUSINESSES 
(Ms. CRAIG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, last 
weekend, I visited women-owned busi-
nesses in Shakopee, and I had the 
pleasure of meeting Elise Steger who 
owns ShakRa Yoga & Fitness. 
Throughout the past year, Elise has 
done everything she can to comply 
with COVID restrictions while con-
tinuing to pay her employees and keep 
her business open. With the help of the 
Paycheck Protection Program loans 
she has also turned to creative solu-
tions like virtual classes, but she has 
been able to keep her business going. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
has served as a lifeline to small busi-
nesses like Elise’s, but in less than 2 
weeks it is due to expire. This week we 
passed legislation in the House on a bi-
partisan basis to extend this critical 
program through May 31. We must en-
sure that that extension becomes law.

RECOGNIZING MARY MARGARET 
BUTLER 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
local 
hero 
in 
my 
hometown 
of 
Ottumwa, Iowa. 
This coming Wednesday, March 24, 
Mary Margaret Butler of Ottumwa will 
be recognized as a 2021 Hero of the 
Heartland by the American Red Cross. 
Mary Margaret is being recognized 
for founding Whatsoever You Do, Inc., 
a nonprofit that has worked tirelessly 
on creating shelters for the homeless in 
southeastern Iowa. For years now, 
Whatsoever You Do has helped hun-
dreds with basic needs such as, food, 
clothing, and housing. 
Across the country, the Red Cross 
works every day through programs and 
services related to disaster relief, the 
military, health and safety, and help-
ing the homeless. The Hero of the 
Heartland 
award 
recognizes 
out-
standing individuals who demonstrate 
courage, compassion, selflessness, and 
work to better help their neighbors and 
communities. 
I am proud to not only represent 
Mary Margaret Butler in Congress, but 
proud to call her a neighbor. Thank 
you, 
Mary 
Margaret, 
for 
making 
Ottumwa a better place to live. 
Additionally, I would like to wish a 
happy birthday to two other amazing 
women of integrity, selflessness, com-
passion, and courage, my chief of staff, 
Tracie Gibler, and my daughter, Taylor 
Miller-Meeks. 
f 
HATE CRIMES MUST STOP 
(Mr. GREEN of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, when you are a son of the seg-
regated south, when you have heard 
your mother called girl, and your fa-
ther called boy, when you have had to 
go to the back door, when you have had 
the Klan burn a cross on your property, 
you know hate when you see it. You 
know what a hate crime is when it 
takes place. 
What happened in Georgia was hate 
personified, it was a hate crime. I will 
march with the people who will be op-
posed to this. I will stand with them. 
We cannot allow this kind of injustice 
to go unchallenged. It is better to 
stand alone than not stand at all. This 
is a hate crime and we must—we must 
seek justice for those victims, and we 
must demand that these persons who 
are calling these viruses by names as-
sociated with people, that they ought 
to stop, and we ought to demand it. I 
do so. I demand that they stop.

DEFENDING OUR HOMELAND 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
there is nothing an American will not 
do to defend his country. I rise today in 
defense of my homeland. I am angry, 
not just for the destruction of Amer-
ican values perpetrated by those on the 
left, but I am angry because my col-
leagues simply do not seem to care. 
They do not care that our border is 
non-existent, that 6,000 criminals cross 
into our country daily. They do not 
care that 64 percent of the Federal ar-
rests are of illegal immigrants. They 
do not care that America’s welfare and 
infrastructure system simply cannot 
handle this influx of criminal immi-
grants. They do not care because, to 
them, power is all that matters. 
I have a message to the power-hun-
gry and the partisan. Power corrupts, 
and absolute power corrupts abso-
lutely. 
It is in the nature of Americans to be 
kind. It is in our nature to be gentle 
and loving. But know this, when it 
comes to the matter of protecting our

TO-DO LIST FOR THE PRESS 
CORPS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
we are now being sent home for 3 
weeks, I don’t know whether it is coin-
cidence or not that we are being sent 
home when we have such a problem at 
our border, and we just got done voting 
on a few immigration bills. 
All of us Congressmen should have a 
to-do list over the next 3 weeks. I want 
to give the press corps a to-do list. 
Right now, our Border Patrol is under 
a gag order in which they cannot edu-
cate the press or Congressmen as to 
what is really going on. This, at a time 
when you have almost three times as 
many people trying to get across the 
border than at this time last year, and 
we have huge numbers of unaccom-
panied minors down there. 
The press should be outraged at this 
gag order. I have been at the border 
four times so far over the last couple 
years, and it is always very illu-
minating what the Border Patrol can 
say to us. Now, like we are in some to-
talitarian state, they are not allowed 
to speak to us. 
I don’t care whether you care about 
the government benefits, the unaccom-
panied minors, the drug trafficking, 
the human trafficking, the money the 
drug cartels are making on illegal im-
migration, we should want to know and 
we can’t know unless the Border Patrol 
tells us. Please wake up, sleeping press 
corps. 
f 
DISASTER AT OUR BORDER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, last 
year Portland, Oregon, cut $16 million 
from their police budget. This has led 
to a twenty-fold increase, unfortu-
nately, in deadly shootings. Mayor 
Wheeler has been forced to reverse 
course now and ask for more funding 
for police. 
Similar to this, the Biden adminis-
tration is having to reverse course due 
to the crisis on the border. Now, many 
are getting hung up on using the word 
‘‘crisis,’’ so FEMA is now involved, and 
they deal with disasters, hence, the 
Biden border disaster. 
Less than 2 months in, the border is 
worse than it has been in two decades. 
And now, Biden has been forced to re-
verse course and ask Mexico to help 
control the flow of migrants once 
again, after previously dismantling the 
‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy. 
Also, on his first day in the Biden ad-
ministration, they issued a proclama-
tion to halt all border construction, de-
spite Congress funding it and demand-
ing that it be built. Now, just yester-
day, the administration has said it was 
moving forward with border wall con-
struction. Good. 
As they are learning in Portland, Se-
attle, and Minneapolis, the Biden ad-
ministration is learning law and order 
is also required on our border or you 
get a disaster.

SCORCHED EARTH TO MISSISSIPPI 
BURNING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from South Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, last 
March, as the tragic failure of the 
Trump administration’s response to 
the coronavirus pandemic was becom-
ing very apparent, the House Demo-
cratic Caucus held a conference call to 
discuss the crisis. Recalling the lessons 
of history, like the aftermath of World 
War I, the Spanish Flu, the Great De-
pression, and World War II, that it is 
usually the least of these among us 
that are the hardest hit during the cri-
ses and the last to recover after these 
crises are over, if they are able to re-
cover at all; I expressed at that time to 
the Caucus that the legislation before 
us offered a tremendous opportunity to 
restructure things in our vision. I was 
referring then, as I often do, to the vi-
sion expressed in our Pledge of Alle-
giance to our Nation’s flag of liberty 
and justice for all. 
b 1315 
Shortly after the media reported 
these comments, Senator MCCONNELL, 
the majority leader of the Senate, de-
rided them on the Senate floor. Refer-
ring to me by position, he declared: 
‘‘This is not a political opportunity. It 
is a national emergency.’’ 
I wholeheartedly agree with the now- 
minority leader of the Senate that the 
coronavirus pandemic was and remains 
a national emergency. But because the 
previous administration and Senate 
Republicans failed to address it with 
appropriate urgency and a vision of lib-
erty and justice for all, the American 
people, through the political process 
last November, entrusted Democrats 
with an opportunity to build back with 
a better and more equitable vision for 
the future of our great country. 
The American Rescue Plan has begun 
that process, and it is enjoying wide-
spread, bipartisan support across the 
entire spectrum of the country. It did 
not get a single Republican vote in the 
House or the Senate. Because of the 
use of the budget process commonly 
called reconciliation, Republicans were 
not able to block by filibuster the 
American Rescue Plan, and that is 
proving to be a good thing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1606 
March 19, 2021 
But the Senate minority leader and 
several of his colleagues seem to be 
hellbent on using archaic Senate proce-
dural rules to allow the minority in the 
Senate to block any legislation de-
signed to protect the voting and civil 
rights of our country’s minority citi-
zens as we continue our pursuit toward 
the fulfillment of liberty and justice 
for all. 
We have been here before. During the 
1940s and 1950s, the Senate filibuster 
was used to kill civil rights legislation 
and protect Jim Crow laws. Today, 
Senate Republican leaders are employ-
ing the same tactics to obstruct voting 
rights and civil rights legislation. 
Their efforts are designed to gain 
power for their party by suppressing 
political participation by minorities. 
The minority leader has threatened 
that if Senate Democrats modify the 
filibuster rules to do to him as he did 
to President Obama, he will resort to 
scorched-earth tactics. This threat of 
scorched-earth tactics by the Senate 
minority leader in defiance of Amer-
ican democracy is reminiscent of ‘‘Mis-
sissippi Burning,’’ which highlighted 
the lynching of three civil rights work-
ers who were simply registering Black 
voters in Mississippi in June 1964. They 
were murdered by the KKK, with the 
cooperation of law enforcement offi-
cials, to keep them from assisting mi-
nority citizens who simply wanted to 
vote. It was 44 days before their bodies 
were located and four decades before 
anyone faced legal consequences for 
their deaths. 
Today, Republicans are using the big 
lie about the 2020 elections as a pretext 
to advance a litany of minority voter 
suppression laws. They know that our 
vision of liberty and justice for all en-
joys majority support among voters, so 
they seek to suppress enough votes so 
that their oppressive policies and bank-
rupt ideas can prevail. The minority 
leader wants to allow a minority of his 
minority to block measures that would 
prevent a return to bygone days. 
To confront this threat, the Senate 
must eliminate the 60-vote threshold to 
end a filibuster on voting rights and 
civil rights legislation. Just as Mis-
sissippi Burning was met with the Civil 
Rights Act and Voting Rights Act, the 
threat of scorched earth must be met 
with the For the People Act and the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. 
I didn’t march in the streets and 
spend nights in jail as a young man to 
find myself fighting the same battles 
generations later, but it appears the 
minority leader and his Republican 
colleagues are preparing to retread old 
ground, and I am prepared to stand my 
ground. 
To the minority leader and his col-
leagues, I say: This is not a political 
opportunity. This is a national emer-
gency. 
Since this country’s inception, equal 
rights for people of color have been re-
stricted by those in power who seek to 
hold on to power by using their power 
to deny the greatness of this country 
to those who do not look like them. 
Extending 
debate 
on 
legislative 
issues is one thing, but when it comes 
to rights rooted in the Constitution, 
the filibuster has no place. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
HONORING REV. DR. C.T. WRIGHT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I am going to do a couple of things 
right now, and one of the first ones is 
a little conversation about someone we 
lost in my community who actually 
was a friend and a neighbor and had an 
impact in ways that are hard to de-
scribe. I desperately wish the Members 
of this body could have spent time with 
him and his wife. 
It is Rev. Dr. Professor C.T. Wright. 
What was so unique about him is that 
he was a big man, and he had a voice 
that carried. You would have conversa-
tions with him, Madam Speaker, and 
realize just how incredibly brilliant he 
was. 
He was born in Georgia. He struggled 
and worked his way up. He ended up 
with a Ph.D. in history from Boston 
College. He became a civil rights lead-
er, yet when you would talk to him 
about 
that, 
Reverend 
Wright—Dr. 
Wright—actually often wouldn’t refer 
to himself as a civil rights leader. He 
would say: I want to lead for humanity. 
He loved people. It was a different 
view. He took his struggles, his suc-
cess, and his academic prowess and 
said: We are going to make people’s 
lives better. Why would you dare focus 
on the color of their skin? 
I remember one of the most inter-
esting conversations I had with him 
where he and I were in the back of the 
room and talked, and he saw many of— 
actually, almost an example of what 
we just saw on the floor—the discus-
sions of politics and race, and said: 
DAVID, it is class and opportunity that 
divides us. It is not our color; it is our 
opportunity. 
Dr. Wright was just a powerful and 
brilliant man. 
Madam Speaker, you see his wife 
there, Mary. They were married in 1974. 
Mary was the epitome of love. 
How many of us in our life have that 
one person? 
I am blessed to have a 5-year-old lit-
tle girl. But even when she was young-
er, when she would see Mary, Mary 
would sort of scream, and the two of 
them would run over and hug each 
other. She was just the epitome of love. 
That made them incredibly powerful, 
as you felt good by just knowing Dr. 
Wright and Mary Wright in your com-
munity. 
The other thing that also made him 
unique was that he was a passionate 
conservative. He was a Republican 
elector. He was the chairman of our 
clemency board, and he was on my 
community school board. He was bril-
liant, and he cared about humanity. He 
ran charities and foundations to help 
all people. They helped people on the 
continent of Africa and even people all 
through our community. He was a pow-
erful force for good because he was 
good, because he was passionate, and 
because he was caring. 
We lost both Mary and Dr. Wright 
last year. 
I am going to put in a much more de-
tailed CV because his history goes on 
page after page, and we will put that in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
Individuals like them bring us to-
gether and also make us better. It 
breaks my heart that more will not get 
to spend time with him because, after a 
couple of minutes with him and Mary, 
you felt different. 
The last thing I will say is he loved 
to give the opening prayer at Repub-
lican meetings. What was always so 
fascinating, Madam Speaker, is you 
would watch the room, and the room 
ends up standing and clapping. I was 
waiting for an altar call. Now, I am 
Catholic, so I am not used to the con-
cept of an altar call, but watching 
someone be able to have so much en-
ergy, vigor, enthusiasm, love for peo-
ple, and love for believing that conserv-
atism is how you free people, he made 
an impact. He made an impact on my 
life, my family’s life, my community, 
and my State, and I believe he made an 
impact on this country. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
memory of Dr. C.T. Wright, a passionate, 
faithful, and devoted public servant and valued 
neighbor. C.T. will be remembered as a men-
tor and true leader throughout the education, 
criminal justice, and faith communities in Ari-
zona. He devoted much of his life to civil 
rights and education, working for many of the 
country’s historically black colleges and uni-
versities, where he then moved on to his pas-
sion to help with human rights. He founded 
the Light of Hope Institute, which promotes 
human rights around the world. He also 
served as a delegate for the Electoral College 
and met six presidents. C.T. frequently led 
prayers at campaign rallies and promoted 
faith. He proudly served as the Chairman of 
the Board of Executive Clemency. 
C.T. Wright had great passion for his family, 
education, faith, and freedom. Many will al-
ways remember and consider him as their 
brother. He leaves behind a great legacy that 
has reached out to communities across Ari-
zona. He was a thoughtful, compassionate, 
and kind man who always cared for others 
while ensuring a good future for all. 
C.T. Wright served countless communities 
unselfishly and served and as a great leader. 
May we continue to honor his memory through 
our passion and service to our communities. 
REVISITING NET NEUTRALITY 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I want to do a handful of other things 
because, with the craziness of our 
schedule, we haven’t had a chance to 
sort of walk through a lot of policy 
thoughts. But there was one that has 
been bugging me. I have the hour, so I 
was going to share something that has 
just been in my craw for a while.

March 19, 2021 
Do we all remember a few years ago— 
ancient history; in politics, we seem to 
have, shall we say, the attention span 
of a gnat—one of the pop culture de-
bates we on the right and left were 
having was something called net neu-
trality? The Democrats were all into 
net neutrality, even though, I will de-
bate, most of this body had no idea 
what net neutrality was. I want to sort 
of argue that thank heaven and thank 
the internet gods that the Democrat 
net neutrality push only lasted 1 year 
or think about how miserable this last 
year would have been. 
We should be held accountable for 
our policy beliefs. This is an occasion 
where I have heard no one get up here 
and talk about what society would 
have looked like in the United States 
during the pandemic if the Democrats’ 
net neutrality policy—remember, they 
did it for 1 year, through regulatory 
fiat. 
The only reason I show this chart is, 
do you see, Madam Speaker, the crash 
here in spending? It was scheduled to 
continue to crash in spending. That 
spending was the internet—the pipes, 
the robustness, the speed, and the car-
rying capacity of the internet—which 
crashed during the Democrat adminis-
tration’s FCC 1 year of functionally 
doing an administrative fiat of net neu-
trality. 
If that line had continued, how many 
of you were educating your kids on 
Zoom? How many of you were holding 
meetings on the internet? How many of 
you had to work from home? How 
many of us in this body were doing 
committee hearings over the internet? 
Yet, the internet in the United 
States in 2017, 2018, and 2019 actually 
got dramatically more robust and dra-
matically faster. In many commu-
nities—particularly on the East Coast, 
oddly enough—there are communities 
that doubled their speed and the 
robustness of the pipes. 
b 1330 
It happened because of the massive 
investment because, thank heaven, the 
crazy policy of what was net neutrality 
was taken away. 
We need to be honest. Sometimes one 
needs to be willing to walk up and 
admit, hey, that was a really stupid 
idea. The one reason this country was 
able to have this disruption and trans-
fer to basically a knowledge-based, 
web-based, internet-based economy was 
because the crazy policies that came 
with net neutrality of having a robust 
internet only lasted 1 year. 
You can actually see that this is 
what happened. This is us. This is 
America trying to survive economi-
cally and educationally. When you see 
these charts, this was not possible. If 
that trend, regulatorily, and then 
therefore investment-wise that started 
in 2016, when the policy shift happened, 
if it had lasted more than a year, this 
year would have been a lot different. 
It is just an occasion where 4 years 
ago, 5 years ago, some of us would get 
up here and try to explain what it 
would mean to the efficiency, the 
robustness, the opportunity for even 
gamers being able to use the internet, 
and we would get great rhetorical com-
ments back, often having nothing to 
actually do with how the internet 
worked. Thank heaven another bad pol-
icy only lasted a short time. 
BUILDING A ROBUST ECONOMY 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
the other thing I also want to talk 
about is why so many of us who actu-
ally own calculators are intensely con-
cerned about the left’s policy in the 
last couple of months. 
This is one of those things that I 
genuinely believe both sides here pas-
sionately care about and want society 
to do well, to have opportunity, the 
working poor to become less poor, the 
poor to become less poor, the middle 
class to be able to thrive; but we just 
see the basics of economics differently. 
I want to spend just a couple of mo-
ments and walk through what is fact, 
and we have the facts. Now, first off, 
how many times over, and over, and 
over do we hear, Hey, post-tax reform, 
the rich are getting richer; the poor are 
getting poorer? 
That is mathematically absolutely 
not true. It is a lie. 
It turns out, policies like we have 
been engaged in just recently make the 
wealthy wealthier. It is a simple 
thought. When you pump massive 
amounts of liquidity into a society, 
into an economy, those people who own 
assets get richer. Their stocks go up, 
their house values go up, and other as-
sets they have go up. 
But if you are part of the poor or 
working poor, how many stocks do you 
own? How much real estate do you 
own? 
Yet the basic economic principles 
that you get to look at over and over, 
the $1.9 trillion spending bill violated 
almost all of the principles. 
So you say, okay, so we are going to 
deliver actual checks. Great. Okay. 
That will have an impact for several 
months. It will reduce poverty for sev-
eral months, but it doesn’t change the 
base. 
A year later, are you being paid 
more? Are there more job opportuni-
ties? Is your labor valuable? 
Because the remarkable thing that 
happened in 2018 and 2019 is the work-
ing poor, their labor became valuable. 
They became essential to the society, 
to economic growth. 
I sat through joint economic hear-
ings in previous years and listened to 
the arrogance of the economists, the 
arrogance of the political class who 
said: Well, they didn’t finish high 
school. They are going to be part of the 
permanent underclass. We will just find 
a way to subsidize them and write 
them off in society instead of making 
them valuable. 
And that is what we have gone back 
and done again. And the problem is 
that we have done it in a way where we 
think we have big hearts. We are going 
to send checks. 
But what about the year after? Did 
they make their labor, their skill sets, 
or their lack of skill sets, desirable in 
the economy? 
So a simple point—and if I actually 
even had better data, this would even 
be more dramatic—in 2013 to 2019, you 
can see the orange there, and that is 
actually pretty much the wealthy in 
our country. 
Under the previous administration, 
you can see—and when I say ‘‘pre-
vious,’’ 
I 
am 
talking 
Obama—the 
wealthy got substantially wealthier 
than the poor, and it is because the 
lack of understanding of what creates 
economic vitality. This here is almost 
solely 2018 and 2019. The poor got 
wealthier; not the rich, the poor. 
The working poor moved up dramati-
cally faster than the rich. 
Why? 
Well, it turns out, tax reform moved 
lots of capital into making plants and 
equipment more efficient, meaning you 
pay people more. 
You all remember your basic eco-
nomics class. What are the two things 
that raises someone’s wages? 
Inflation—which 
means 
you 
paid 
more, but you didn’t get anything 
more—and productivity. 
When you raise a business’s, the soci-
ety’s, the community’s productivity, 
people get paid more. That is what was 
happening here. We made the working 
poor less poor through tax; regulatory; 
and immigration policy, which is some-
thing I will touch on at the end be-
cause it is very uncomfortable for a lot 
of people to talk about. 
Immigration policy is complex from 
an economic standpoint, but if you love 
and care for those who are just strug-
gling and trying to survive, they may 
not have had the opportunity to go to 
grad school or college. They may not 
have even graduated high school, but 
they are out there trying to provide for 
themselves and their families and the 
people they love and care for. 
Why do we adopt policies like this 
that don’t make their labor valuable, 
and then we choose to flood the market 
with similar skill sets to devalue the 
labor? 
There is this weird duplicity that 
happens here, where we talk about 
helping those who need help, and then 
we engage in policies, whether it be im-
migration policy, regulatory policy, 
particularly tax and spending policy, 
that ends up crushing the very people 
we claim we are trying to help. 
I know charts are annoying, but the 
math is the math. If you look at this 
one, you start to see the percentage of 
American households that were in pov-
erty. We had substantially plateaued. 
We weren’t getting better as a society. 
And then all of a sudden over here, you 
see we started doing what was nec-
essary to expand, create opportunity. 
And, yes, it meant getting businesses 
to have to compete with each other by 
putting money into more efficient 
equipment and doing things that lifted 
Americans and created value for labor, 
even the very low-skilled labor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1608 
March 19, 2021 
You start to see in 2018 and 2019, 
America hitting its lowest poverty 
rates ever; income, food insecurity, the 
lowest ever. The working poor’s labor 
became valuable. And if you actually 
want to go into the subsets—which I 
have chart after chart after chart—if 
you claim you care about African- 
American females or this subset or 
that subset, you see that some of those 
subsets have movement in the value of 
their talents and their labor, which 
was remarkable. 
We had, I think, a quarter in early 
2019, or it was late 2018, where African- 
American women had almost a double- 
digit rise in wages in an entire year. It 
was like a 7.3 percent rise in wages. 
I know, as a Republican, we have this 
bad habit of sounding like accountants 
on steroids, but these numbers really 
do mean something. It is people. It is 
how they feed their family, how they 
save for retirement, how they have an 
opportunity. 
There 
were 
amazing 
things happening. 
We talk a lot about income inequal-
ity, which I actually have a personal 
fixation on this. And if you actually 
look at the first time we had major 
movement in the drop of income in-
equality in this society, it was 2018 and 
2019. And it wasn’t because rich people 
got less rich. It was because the poor, 
the working poor got dramatically less 
poor. 
We adopted policies that made their 
labor valuable. Then the pandemic hit 
and we had to rebuild. 
But are we rebuilding in a way that 
makes their labor valuable? 
I am going to make an argument 
that what we just did, we are going to 
get a nice little sugar high, but for a 
very short time. 
And then the next day, what are 
their job prospects? 
If you are someone who didn’t finish 
high school, but you are willing to 
work your heart out, you are willing to 
learn, what opportunities did the last 
spending bill provide for that person? 
How many new jobs did it help create? 
How much economic expansion? How 
many capital expenditures to make 
their jobs more productive so they can 
be paid more? 
Instead, what we did is we said: Here 
is some money, and, oh, by the way, we 
are going to raise taxes over here com-
ing later this year and those things, so 
your job prospects—it is a technical 
economic term—you are screwed in the 
future. 
Do we think more than just the next 
election cycle? 
If we are going to make the poor less 
poor in this country, you need oppor-
tunity. We just spent $1.9 trillion and 
not a dime of it creates opportunity, 
creates what the future should look 
like. 
So we say we care. We both care. The 
problem is, I have the numbers that 
show what worked. The other side has 
decades of doing the same thing and in-
come inequality and poverty didn’t get 
better. They are blips. But those blips 
were from direct cash, unless the plan 
is just, hey, we are going to do direct 
cash forever and ever and ever, and 
that is really going to be great for soci-
ety and the psyche of our society. 
Once again, I am sorry to do this, and 
I hate this term, but it is the only one 
the economists around here all use, 
which is ‘‘quartiles.’’ Here is the lowest 
income quartile. Take a look at 2019, if 
you are willing to embrace math. 
I always thought that would be the 
great Christmas gift around here, is to 
buy everyone a calculator. A family 
joke is: Daddy works in a math-free 
zone. 
It was a remarkable change in the 
value of those workers and what they 
were paid, and it is because their tal-
ent, their labor that they had to offer 
became more valuable. 
Look at what happened in 2019. That 
is what changes a society, because the 
idea is, you build a base, and then the 
next year you build on it, and then the 
next year you build on it, and the next 
year you build on it. That is one way to 
remove lots of your society out of pov-
erty. 
The other is to do what the Demo-
crats are doing right now and saying: 
We are going to send you a check. 
Okay. What happens the day the 
check is gone? Did you make society 
more prosperous? Did you take the 
working poor of our country and make 
it so the value of their labor that they 
offer is more valuable the next day, 
and the next day, and the next day? 
You didn’t. The only way you basi-
cally have to backfill is you have got 
to send another check. It is just soci-
etal suicide and lunacy. 
I understand pandering and politics, 
but at some point you wish you had a 
quiet room with some economists to 
say: How do we have a revolution in 
our society that we have dramatically 
less poor and the working poor are dra-
matically less poor? And how do we get 
there? And how do we do this over the 
next decade? 
Because I will make you the argu-
ment that what was happening particu-
larly in 2018 and 2019 were remarkable 
numbers. So let’s go to the next quar-
tile up. It turns out the same thing was 
happening. 
And when you actually look at the 
stratification of these quartiles—I am 
sorry, it is geeky—the lowest quartile, 
a traditionally very, very low skill set. 
Second quartile, up some skill set. And 
you actually see remarkable—I mean, a 
$2,600 increase in the value of their 
labor for the second quartile, which is 
still poverty. It is working poor, but 
this quartile, if you look at that, that 
is remarkable. 
This is actually accounting for earn-
ing of tax credit and transfer pay-
ments, working through what was eco-
nomic, and it was the value of their 
labor. 
b 1345 
Once again, for all of us that keep 
coming behind these microphones— 
and, you know, particularly the dark-
ness of this body right now, we see so 
much of the debate being about the 
pigment of someone’s skin instead of 
the economic circumstances, the class, 
as Dr. Wright would often refer to, and 
what we do to create opportunity. 
And this chart here basically is just 
pure salary. What happened to the 
mean weekly, real earnings? Now, re-
member, these are inflationary ad-
justed. So I do my best to make sure 
the math is as honest as possible. And 
when you actually start to see the 
quartiles of African-American wages 
taking a huge spike up in 2018 and 
2019—Anglos, 
Hispanics—really 
the 
growth rate in their wages was remark-
able. And there are some other charts, 
which are really hard to read, that are 
a little geeky, that say, okay, here is 
the level of skill set, educational at-
tainment, those things. 
It turns out, we had such a robust 
economy that those who are often at 
the tail end of educational attainment 
actually had the fastest growth in 
wages. 
So you go back to the earlier chart, 
saying, turns out the working poor got 
substantially less poor, the rich got 
richer, but nothing at the same per-
centages. And that is why the eco-
nomic inequality shrank. That is the 
honest math. Yet, you don’t hear it in 
the rhetoric here, because the rhetor-
ical divide of our society is so much 
more powerful and desired, because it 
is about winning the next election than 
actually doing what is important to 
make society great. 
So right now—and this is a hard one 
to talk about, because we have so po-
liticized it that trying to look at it 
through an economic lens is really 
hard. I will get folks—whenever I start 
to walk through these numbers, folks 
will send me crazy stuff. And I am try-
ing to say this isn’t about ethnicity; 
this is—I am doing labor economics. 
Janet Yellen is supposed to be a bril-
liant labor economist, yet when you 
hear her speeches recently—or now 
that she is Treasury Secretary—it rips 
your heart out, saying, at least take a 
breath and compliment what happened 
in the previous couple of years, but 
that would mean saying something 
nice to free market economics. 
Right now, we estimate—and this is 
the best number I can get my hands 
on—that about 41⁄2 percent of the labor 
force is undocumented. 
In a society right now where, if you 
actually really dive into labor force 
participation numbers, unemployment 
is probably double the number we post. 
You know, people who should be in the 
labor pool aren’t there, the folks who 
were the miracle of, particularly, 2018 
and 2019, the number of folks who came 
back into the labor force—remember, 
we actually had some quarters there 
with some weird numbers where unem-
ployment actually sort of flatlined, but 
the number of workers in the United 
States exploded. How does that hap-
pen?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1609 
March 19, 2021 
It means you have such a robust 
economy that you are drawing people 
back in. 
The crisis we live in today is so many 
Americans, particularly female work-
ers, are now out of the labor force, with 
almost no intention of coming back in. 
What is devastating about that is we 
just passed legislation here that will 
reinforce the incentive not to come 
back in. Because, instead of designing 
the Democrat’s $1.9 trillion spending 
bill 
saying, 
We 
are 
going 
to 
incentivize; we are going to help you; 
you can keep some of this money; and 
we are going to incentivize an em-
ployer to hire you, building that type 
of economy. It is, Here is something; 
you can have it if you work; you can 
have it if you just choose to stay home. 
There is no incentive there to come 
back into the labor market. 
And why is this so darn important? 
Why do I fixate on this? 
Post-tax reform, if you actually 
looked at the changes in revenues—re-
member, we had the second and third 
highest, adjusted for inflation, tax re-
ceipts in U.S. history post-tax reform, 
post the lower rates. It is because the 
economy, the pie, got so much bigger. 
But what was so special about that is 
the trust funds that so many of us had 
worked on, that—we were really wor-
ried how fast the Medicare trust fund 
was collapsing, the Social Security 
trust fund was collapsing. The actu-
arial life of them popped, it got longer. 
It is because we had so many more 
workers who were paying into it. 
Remember, we have a pay-as-you-go 
system. When you hear the words 
‘‘trust fund,’’ there is really very little 
cash in those trust funds. 
If you care about protecting Social 
Security, if you care about protecting 
Medicare, if you care about society and 
these promises we have made, you 
would think the economics, the policy 
we are adopting here, are about maxi-
mizing opportunity employment, not 
trying to patch over pain that we are 
suffering right now in a way that 
makes the next day painful again. 
So the last thing—and it actually 
does tie in. I am going to personalize 
this a little bit. I am blessed to live in 
a community where my school is open. 
The greatest gift that has ever been 
given to me in my life, and my wife, is 
we have a little girl. Many know we 
struggled for years, and we were able 
to adopt a little girl. She is the great-
est joy you can imagine. 
She is in higher education now. She 
is in kindergarten. And this summer, 
for her first month—this is back in Au-
gust—she had to sit at home behind a 
little laptop doing Zoom class, as a 
kindergartner. At that time she was 
43⁄4. She tested in early. 
And she was miserable. I had a little 
girl—I didn’t know this could happen, 
that a child that young could be de-
pressed. She was miserable. 
‘‘Daddy, can I go to Washington with 
you?’’ 
‘‘Daddy, can I go to work with you?’’ 
‘‘Daddy, don’t make me sit behind 
the computer.’’ 
‘‘Daddy, I don’t like this.’’ 
And then after about 31⁄2 weeks, the 
school district actually followed the 
science. Not the politics; they followed 
the science. Not the teachers’ union; 
they followed the science. They started 
letting the little people into school. 
They took the proper precautions, and 
my little girl wears a mask and they 
sterilize their hands. They follow ra-
tional precautions. 
Within just days, it is like I had a 
different little girl. She was joyful. She 
was happy. She announced she had a 
boyfriend. Daddy is not happy about 
that. 
If that is my personal experience, 
what have we done to our society? 
What have we done to the next genera-
tion? 
I came here last week and did a series 
of presentations of what we have done 
to individual future earning power, 
particularly the categories we just 
talked about, the working poor, their 
future earnings, their future income. 
We have crushed them, because today’s 
success builds on the next. What hap-
pens when you take an entire year 
away from so many people’s career 
paths, from building their base? 
Now, this is international, but we 
came across this; it is a sense of well- 
being of young people and older people 
from around the world. 
We all saw that article from about a 
month ago about Las Vegas County 
and the number of suicides of children. 
And this one, when you look at it, it is 
our kids. We have devastated our kids. 
My fear is we are going to spend dec-
ades making up for the schools being 
closed, the access to nutrition, the ac-
cess to counseling, and the access to 
just human relationships. Why would 
we ever allow our public policy to do 
this sort of violence to the health and 
well-being and psyche of the children 
that we claim we care about, because 
the teachers’ union has a different 
agenda? 
I hope we, as Members, and I hope 
America remembers what happened 
here. I also hope the next time the left 
comes with a massive spending bill, 
they understand how much that money 
needs to go into repairing the damage 
we have done to our children, to the 
next generation, and being willing to 
recognize that we didn’t follow the 
science; we followed the politics. 
Madam Speaker, I wish us all a fine 
time at home. I hope now that the 
world is getting healthier, we can 
spend time with our constituents. 
Maybe when we come back in a couple 
weeks, we can still be partisan, we can 
still duke it out, but we actually make 
policy by rational math instead of the 
wedge of politics. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
FELLOWSHIP 
FREE 
WILL BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Fellowship Free Will Bap-
tist Church of Park Hills, Missouri on the occa-
sion of their 75th anniversary. 
The church was founded in 1946 when a 
group of about 50 believers gathered to wor-
ship at the old Buckley Store building. Roughly 
three months later Fellowship Church voted to 
purchase the property at 601 Buckley Street, 
where the sanctuary stands today. The pur-
chase was made on August 12, 1946, and 
ground was broken just 14 days later. 
In the heart of the mining community, a 
group of lead miners on strike, volunteered 
their manpower and resources to build the 
sanctuary. Only eight months later, the first 
service was held in the new church on Easter 
Sunday, April 17, 1949. 
It has been the mission of Fellowship Free 
Will Baptist Church to help people find their 
greatest joy in Jesus by helping them to 
‘‘Know God, Grow in Truth, Connect in Com-
munity, and Serve Others.’’ 
It is my great pleasure to honor Fellowship 
Free Will Baptist Church of Park Hills, Mis-
souri on their 75th anniversary today, before 
the United States House of Representatives.

HONORING THE GAY AND LESBIAN 
ACTIVISTS ALLIANCE OF WASH-
INGTON, D.C. 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, as the 
member representing the District of Columbia 
in Congress, I am proud and honored that the 
District has the oldest continuously active 
LGBTQ civil rights organization in the nation, 
the Gay and Lesbian Activists Alliance of 
Washington, D.C. (GLAA). 
GLAA has worked tirelessly for LGBTQ peo-
ple in D.C. since its founding in April 1971. 
April of this year marks GLAA’s 50th anniver-
sary. This is an incredible milestone in the his-
tory of D.C.’s premier LGBTQ organization. 
Over the past 50 years, GLAA has worked 
tirelessly for the passage of many important 
legislative and policy measures that affect 
LGBTQ Americans, especially in the District. 
Equality for all Americans has always been 
a priority for me in Congress, but equal treat-
ment for LGBTQ people has long held even 
greater significance to me. Congressional op-
ponents of equality for LGBTQ people have 
used D.C.’s unique status as a weapon 
against LGBTQ people in D.C. For example, I 
had to defeat many bills and amendments that 
would have blocked D.C.’s marriage equality 
law. 
I was pleased to celebrate GLAA’s work to 
help pass the D.C. Religious Freedom and 
Civil Marriage Equality Amendment Act in 
2010, which removed any doubt in the District 
of the right of same-sex couples to marry. The 
act served to recognize same-sex marriages 
five years before the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion in Obergefell v. Hodges. This remarkable 
effort exhibits the dedication and success that 
GLAA has displayed throughout its history. Its 
work extends well beyond this and includes a 
commitment to strengthen and enforce the 
D.C. Human Rights Act of 1977 to include pro-
tections for LGBTQ seniors and transgender 
Washingtonians. 
GLAA has done extensive coalition-building 
and continues to defend the rights of LGBTQ 
youth and seniors, particularly when it comes 
to issues surrounding policing, healthcare, 
housing and consumer protection. What GLAA 
has done, and continues to accomplish, in 
these very personal and meaningful areas of 
life for LGBTQ residents should be applauded 
and uplifted. I have confidence that the future 
will bring even more success with GLAA’s 
presence in our community, for which we 
should all be grateful. 
I ask the House to join me in honoring 
GLAA and celebrating GLAA’s 50 years of re-
markable, distinguished service to and advo-
cacy for the LGBTQ community in the District 
of Columbia.

CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 17, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, Women’s History 
Month is a time to appreciate the achieve-
ments of women and the many strides we’ve 
made to create a more equal society and an 
inclusive world for our children. 
Women’s History Month began as a des-
ignated week in California in 1978. It soon be-
came a week nationwide, and a decade later 
it was expanded to include the entire month of 
March. 
Women have had to fight for voting rights, 
equal treatment, equal pay, and much more, 
often at great costs, but we have achieved so 
much. In the 1970s, women were not allowed 
to get credit or loans in their own name. 
Today, women make up the majority of the 
college-educated workforce. 
Because of the actions and sacrifices of 
those who came before us, the new Congress 
has 144 women serving in it, the highest num-
ber in American history and we have the first 
female Vice President in our history. 
While much has been accomplished, there’s 
so much more to be done. We must reauthor-
ize the Violence Against Women Act, secure 
equal pay, tackle maternal mortality rates, stop 
the relentless attacks on reproductive health, 
and guarantee paid family leave. 
The pandemic has had a devastating and 
disproportionate impact on women. In Sep-
tember of 2020, more than a million Ameri-
cans left the workforce, with 80 percent being 
women. Three months later, 140,000 jobs of 
women were lost. 
To all the women who are struggling during 
this pandemic, I see them. I stand with them 
and I will fight for them always.

IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF NA-
POLEON HIGH SCHOOL WINNING 
THE DIVISION II STATE GIRLS 
BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding high school 
basketball team in Ohio’s Fifth Congressional 
District. The young women of the Napoleon 
High School girls’ basketball team have rep-
resented their school ably on their way to 
achieving the Division II State Girls Basketball 
Title. In their effort to surpass all other teams 
in the Division II State Basketball Playoffs, the 
Napoleon Wildcats overcame the challenges 
posed by intense competition. 
In pursuing the State Championship, the 
Napoleon Lady Wildcats defeated the Vinton 
County Vikings to win their first state basket-
ball championship. The members of this very 
special team have shown that their sport re-
quires an individual effort for a team result. 
Their hard work and dedication, both on and 
off the court, in achieving this accomplishment 
is truly outstanding. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to the Napoleon 
High School girls basketball team. On behalf 
of the people of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am 
proud to recognize this great achievement.

CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 17, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the women of our nation and my home 
state of Hawaii past, present and future as we 
again celebrate Women’s History Month. 
Each year during the month of March, we 
remember and honor the extraordinary Amer-
ican women who have made such lasting con-
tributions to our culture, history and society. 
Long before they finally gained the right to 
vote in elections and before they broke 
through glass ceilings throughout our society, 
generations of women worked to expand the 
rights and opportunities previously denied to 
them. Women from all across America revolu-
tionized their respective fields, setting the 
stage for the next generation, and the next, to 
pursue and attain equality. 
It is my honor to share with you today the 
stories of three remarkable women from Ha-
waii who made indelible contributions in edu-
cation, science and politics. 
When Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop was 
born in 1831, the Native Hawaiian population 
in the islands numbered about 124,000. By 
the time she wrote her will in 1883, only 
44,000 Native Hawaiians remained. In re-
sponse to these dramatic changes facing Ha-
waii, she committed her life to those who were 
suffering and struggling in her homeland. She 
saw that education would allow her people to 
adapt to a changing world while preserving 
their language, culture and identity, so she 
dedicated her royal inheritance to establish 
Kamehameha Schools, with the mission of 
educating the children of Hawaii. Today, Ka-
mehameha Schools is the largest independent 
school system in the U.S., with a current en-
rollment of 6,900 students within its Pre-K– 
12th grade program, and countless alumni 
who have bettered Hawai‘i and our nation in 
countless ways. 
Born in remote Ha˜na, Maui in 1919, Dr. Isa-
bella Kauakea Tau Yung Aiona Abbott was 
the first Native Hawaiian woman to receive a 
PhD in science. Abbot spent much of her 
childhood at the seashore with her mother, 
collecting seaweed and algae. From her moth-
er, as her mother from hers and on back, she 
learned to distinguish the different types of ed-
ible seaweed and how to use them in tradi-
tional Hawaiian cooking. These practices, 
passed from mother to daughter over genera-
tions, catalyzed Abbott’s career in natural 
science. She went on to get her PhD in bot-
any from the University of California at Berke-
ley. In 1960, she became a lecturer in the Bi-
ology Department at Stanford, and in 1971 
she became the first woman on Stanford’s bio-
logical sciences faculty. Abbot made unparal-
leled contributions to marine science, author-
ing eight books and over 150 research papers. 
She is credited with discovering over 200 dif-
ferent species of algae, many of which have 
been named after her, including a genus of 
the 
red 
algae 
family, 
which 
is 
called 
Abbottella, or ‘‘little Abbott.’’ 
Patsy Mink was the first Asian-American 
woman to be elected to the U.S. House of 
Representatives. Although her list of accom-
plishments is extensive, Mink faced many ob-
stacles early in her career from those who did 
not believe in gender equality. After earning 
her bachelor’s degree at the University of Ha-
waii, Mink applied to 12 medical schools and 
was rejected by all of them. She pivoted to 
study law at the University of Chicago. After 
graduating, she was denied the opportunity to 
take the bar examination in Hawaii due to her 
gender and marital status. She challenged the 
statute, won her case, and later passed the 
bar only to find that she could not get a job 
because she was married and had a child. 
She opened her own practice and focused on 
ending discriminatory laws. During her political 
career over the subsequent years, she broke 
many glass ceilings, winning positions in the 
State House of Representatives, the State 
Senate and eventually the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, where she served for 12 terms. 
During her 24 years in Congress, she intro-
duced and won passage of many impactful ini-
tiatives, most notably the Title IX amendment 
that ended discrimination in education due to 
gender, religion or race. In recognition of the 
tremendous impact Title IX has had for mil-
lions of girls and women over the past four 
decades, Congress renamed Title IX the Patsy 
T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act 
following her passing. 
I could tell countless other stories of other 
women of Hawaii as we celebrate Women’s 
History Month, stories that serve as an inspira-
tion as we look to honor the tremendous con-
tributions of the women who challenged the 
status quo and courageously fought for equal-
ity in every state of our nation. They truly 
paved the way for the equally inspiring women 
that we are privileged to witness advancing 
gender equity today. 
There is still so much work to be done for 
women in the U.S. and around the world. With 
the rest of my colleagues in Congress, I am 
inspired this month to continue the work that 
brings us closer each day to our nation’s high-
est ideals of freedom and equality for all.

RECOGNIZING COLORADO’S 
LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the hard-working Coloradans who 
form the bedrock of my state’s livestock indus-
try. In Colorado’s 4th District, the livestock and 
agriculture industries account for more than 
11,000 jobs, which contributes to the $41 bil-
lion economic impact these industries have 
statewide. During last fiscal year, 82 percent 
of Colorado’s agriculture sales came from 
Colorado’s 4th District. Meat and poultry sup-
pliers, as well as other agricultural producers, 
are essential to the communities across the 
Eastern Plains and are foundational to Colo-
rado’s economy. Despite the many supply 
chain disruptions imposed on Coloradans by 
the pandemic, the agriculture community has 
come together to focus on feeding Americans 
during these challenging times. 
These dedicated men and women serve our 
communities in countless ways every day. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to recognize 
their hard work and determination.

IN RECOGNITION OF KARL 
PIETRZAK 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Karl Pietrzak on 
his new role as President and Chief Executive 
Officer of Destination Gettysburg. 
Mr. Pietrzak was raised in Adams County 
and is returning to the region to assume this 
new position. Before joining Destination Get-
tysburg, he served as Vice President of Visit 
Pittsburgh. In that role, he helped Pittsburgh to 
generate over one $1 billion in direct spending 
revenue. Mr. Pietrzak has immense experi-
ence in the tourism and hospitality industries, 
and he will be a great addition to the Adams 
County community. 
As visitors travel to Gettysburg and the 
Adams County region, Mr. Pietrzak will be an 
incredible partner to small businesses and the 
tourism 
community. 
I 
congratulate 
Karl 
Pietrzak on his new role and look forward to 
working alongside him to serve Adams Coun-
ty.

HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
UTE 
TRIBAL ELDER, THOMAS HOUSE, 
SENIOR 
HON. LAUREN BOEBERT 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, last 
month Colorado said farewell to Ute Tribal 
Elder, Thomas House, Senior. Mr. House was 
the remaining son of Chief Jack House, the 
last traditional chief of the Ute Mountain Ute 
tribe in Southwestern Colorado. 
Mr. House served as a tribal elder in the 
Ute Mountain Ute tribe who lived his life with 
honor and dedicated his life to representing 
his community and preserving traditional Ute 
values. 
A man of many roles and responsibilities, 
Mr. House served as a natural resources di-
rector, rancher, respected spiritual leader, and 
even organized horse races at the Ute Moun-
tain rodeo grounds. His exceptional, lifelong 
dedication to his community and the Ute 
Mountain Ute Tribe will live on through those 
he served and the remarkable family he left 
behind. 
People don’t have to look farther than his 
home to see Mr. House’s love for his commu-
nity. Mr. House and his wife were known for 
taking in foster children who had no place to 
go. 
Thomas House never hesitated when called 
upon to serve, and many of his children and 
grandchildren have taken on leadership posi-
tions themselves, continuing his legacy and

TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF 
BAHRAIN’S PEACEFUL PROTESTS 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. 
MCGOVERN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
last 
month marked the tenth anniversary of peace-
ful protests that spurred great hope for change 
in Bahrain, only to have those hopes dashed. 
On February 14, 2011, thousands of Bah-
rainis took to the streets in peaceful protests 
throughout the country to call for democratiza-
tion and social and economic reform. 
Bahraini security forces attacked the peace-
ful protesters, first with pepper spray and 
flash-bangs, then with rubber bullets and fi-
nally with shotguns. 
The protesters remained peaceful, and in 
the days that followed, the protests grew. 
The Pearl Roundabout in the capital city, 
Manama, became the hub with hundreds 
camping there and sharing food. 
Then came ‘‘Bahrain Bloody Thursday.’’ 
At about 4:00 a.m. on February 17, 2011, 
while protesters including women and children 
were sleeping, security forces stormed the 
area with tear gas. They threw stun grenades 
and fired shot guns at the terrified people. 
Bahraini and international media were at-
tacked. 
Paramedics and ambulance drivers who re-
sponded were also reportedly attacked and 
told not to help injured protesters. 
Four protesters were killed and as many as 
300 were injured. 
Hundreds were detained, including medical 
personnel, and the police pursued others to 
nearby villages to arrest them as well. 
Following ‘‘Bahrain Bloody Thursday,’’ Nich-
olas Kristof wrote in the New York Times, 
‘‘When a king opens fire on his people, he no 
longer deserves to be ruler.’’ 
As leaders from around the world con-
demned the violence, it seemed at first that 
the door to reform had been opened. The 
King’s acceptance of the recommendations of 
the Bahrain Independent Commission of In-
quiry kept hope alive for quite some time. 
But ten years later little has changed for the 
Bahraini people. 
I welcomed the release of Nabeel Rajab in 
June 2020, who spent nearly eight of the past 
nine years imprisoned for peaceful protest and 
criticizing government policies. 
But many prisoners of conscience remain 
behind bars, and it is well past time to release 
everyone else imprisoned for exercising their 
fundamental rights. These include human 
rights defenders Dr. Abduljalil Al-Singace, 
Abdulhadi Alkhawaja, Ahmed Humaidan, and 
Naji Fateel, and Sheikh Ali Salman. 
Brave human rights and opposition leaders 
continue to call for the release of prisoners, 
accountability for grave human rights viola-
tions, and political reform. 
Madam Speaker, the people of Bahrain 
have been waiting ten long years for a sign 
that the arc of justice is bending toward them. 
I am tremendously heartened by statements 
made by Biden Administration officials con-
firming that the U.S. commitment to human 
rights will be reflected in our foreign policy. 
We cannot serve as a beacon of hope while 
turning a blind eye to human rights violations. 
What should that mean when it comes to 
Bahrain? Here are some ideas. 
The U.S. should pause arms sales to Bah-
rain. 
The Department of Defense should develop 
a contingency plan for relocating the U.S. 5th 
Fleet out of Bahrain. 
The Administration should make full use of 
Global Magnitsky authorities to sanction Bah-
raini officials who are known to have com-
mitted terrible human rights abuses and have 
suffered no consequences for their actions. 
Accountability must return to the bilateral 
agenda. 
The State Department should work for the 
release of all prisoners of conscience. And the 
State Department should put reforms back on 
the bilateral agenda. What reforms are we 
talking about? 
To start with, the Bahraini government 
should: end the prohibition on political soci-
eties, decriminalize all speech, allow national 
and international press to operate without 
state intervention, stop rendering its citizens 
stateless, strip the National Security Agency of 
its power to arrest, bring its anti-terrorism leg-
islation into line with international human rights 
standards, integrate its security forces, and 
end discrimination against the majority Shi’a 
population everywhere it exists. 
Taking these steps would not transform 
Bahrain into a democracy. But they would go 
some way toward improving the country’s do-
mestic human rights situation. 
I look forward to working with the Biden Ad-
ministration on these and other ideas to make 
sure that U.S. policy toward Bahrain truly pro-
tects the human rights of the Bahraini peo-
ple—and therefore truly contributes to Amer-
ica’s security.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
HOUSTON- 
TOWN AREA VOLUNTEER FIRE 
COMPANY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the Houstontown Area 
Volunteer Fire Company for its dedication and 
service to our community. 
Dating back to its establishment in 1966, the 
Houstontown Area Volunteer Fire Company 
has a long history of serving the community. 
As an act of kindness amid the ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic, the department assem-
bled and distributed 648 boxes of food, includ-
ing fresh produce, milk, dairy, and cooked 
meats, to the Houstontown community. Fire-
fighters 
generously 
delivered 
boxes 
to 
Houstontown residents who are homebound 
and could not participate in drive-through op-
portunities. 
This vital food drive was made possible 
through the USDA Farmers to Families pro-
gram, which was established as part of the 
CARES Act. The fire company humbly noted 
the food distribution was a small thank you to 
the community who has continued to offer 
their support throughout this past year. 
During these trying times, I am grateful for 
the work of the Houstontown Area Volunteer 
Fire Company and pray for their continued 
safety and success.

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 17, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I voted with 
great pride for the Violence Against Women 
Act when it originally passed the House in 
1994. Since then we have made great strides 
to end gendered violence, but our work is not 
done. 
This reauthorization supports critical efforts 
to end the scourge of violent acts committed 
against women by bolstering resources for 
survivors, strengthening healthcare for sur-
vivors, improving conditions for women in cus-
tody, closing the law enforcement consent 
loophole, and much more. 
We are debating this bill during a particu-
larly difficult time for women because the pan-
demic has forced victims to be home with their 
abusers. 
This reality underscores the urgency with 
which Congress must act by fully funding and 
reauthorizing VAWA.

TAWA-GLANDORF HIGH SCHOOL 
AS

DIVISION

STATE 
GIRLS BASKETBALL CHAMPION-
SHIP RUNNER-UP 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding high school 
basketball team in Ohio’s Fifth Congressional 
District. The young women of the Ottawa- 
Glandorf High School girls basketball team 
have represented their school ably on their 
way to becoming the Runner Up in the Divi-
sion III State Girls Basketball Championship 
tournament. The Ottawa-Glandorf Titans over-
came the challenges of intense competition on 
the path to reach the championship playoffs, 
capping off an outstanding season with their 
noteworthy performance. 
In the state final game, the Ottawa-Glandorf 
Titans faced the Hiland Hawks. The Titans 
played an impressive final game that high-
lighted the teamwork they have demonstrated 
throughout their trip to the playoffs. Each 
member of this very special team has shown 
the individual effort that their sport requires for 
a successful team result. As a direct con-
sequence of their hard work and dedication, 
both on and off the court, they achieved an 
impressive season record that brought pride to 
their community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to the Ottawa- 
Glandorf High School girls basketball team. 
On behalf of the people of the Fifth District of 
Ohio, I am proud to recognize this great 
achievement.

HONORING AMBASSADOR H. 
DOUGLAS BARCLAY 
HON. ANDREW R. GARBARINO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the incredible life and legacy of 
former New York State Senator and former 
U.S. Ambassador, H. Douglas ‘‘Doug’’ Bar-
clay. 
Ambassador Barclay dedicated his life to 
private and public service to New Yorkers, 
Americans, and citizens of the world. Born and 
raised in the Empire State, Ambassador Bar-
clay attended St. Paul’s School and Yale Uni-
versity before serving in the U.S. Army. Fol-
lowing his honorable discharge from the 
armed services, Ambassador Barclay grad-
uated from Syracuse University College of 
Law, and practiced law at a Syracuse law firm 
before pursuing a life of public service. 
First elected to the New York State Senate 
in 
1964, 
Ambassador 
Barclay 
honorably 
served for twenty years, championing efforts in 
criminal justice, court reform and economic 
development. In 2003, President George W. 
Bush nominated, and the U.S. Senate con-
firmed him as U.S. Ambassador to the Repub-
lic of El Salvador. 
I will always cherish the times I spent with 
Ambassador Barclay and his son Will, a dear 
friend of mine. Whether meeting up at political 
functions in New York City or having lunch 
with Will at our favorite Thai restaurant in Al-
bany, I always enjoyed hearing Ambassador 
Barclay share his inspiring stories from a life-
time of service. 
Whether serving in uniform, in the New York 
State Senate, or as an Ambassador, Ambas-
sador Barclay always put the interest of New 
Yorkers and Americans first. Ambassador Bar-
clay was a true statesman and a once-in-a- 
generation example of what it means to be a 
public servant. I join the State of New York in 
mourning the loss and celebrating the im-
mense legacy of one of our state’s greatest.

HONORING THE IDAHO NATIONAL

HON. RUSS FULCHER

provided to our Nation’s Capital by the men 
and women of the Idaho National Guard. The 
presence of ldaho’s Army and Air Guard con-
tributed to the safety of our legislative process. 
I am so thankful to be blessed by the always 
optimistic American spirit that guides this di-
vinely inspired country. Not only did our Guard 
protect the U.S. Capitol, they also protected 
the Members, staff, and employees of the leg-
islative branch, and the constitutional process 
we follow. Idaho’s National Guard worked 
alongside the Capitol Police and other law en-
forcement personnel to ensure that constitu-
tional process could move forward uninter-
rupted. I extend my gratitude and include in

COMMEMORATING THE 20TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF MYFICO.COM 
HON. DEAN PHILLIPS 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of 
myFICO.com. 
Two decades ago, on March 19, 2001, 
FICO, a pioneer in the development of credit 
scoring, 
launched 
an 
online 
website, 
myFICO.com, recognizing the need for greater 
transparency and education in the consumer 
credit empowerment space. my FICO.com 
quickly became a go-to destination for con-
sumers accessing their credit reports, FICO 
Scores and FICO Score explanation. More im-
portantly, the site became a resource for any 
consumer to receive free educational informa-
tion and tools that help individuals better un-
derstand what actions impact their overall 
credit health. 
Over this time, the site developed myFICO 
Forums, a robust crowd source community, 
which has become a valuable free resource 
for consumers to get unfettered credit-related 
information from their peers. The site now 
contains a popular blog as well as a series of 
credit education videos. 
Understanding credit scores and developing 
financial literacy is not an easy pursuit. For 20 
years, myFICO has been assisting millions of 
people become educated consumers and gain 
access to credit to enhance their lives. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating myFICO’s twenty years of 
contributions to our constituents and commu-
nities.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF ROD 
SLYHOFF, 
PRESIDENT/CEO, 
PUEBLO 
CHAMBER 
OF 
COM-
MERCE 
HON. LAUREN BOEBERT 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, on Mon-
day, March 1, 2021, the city of Pueblo lost a 
community leader and business champion with 
the passing of Rod Slyhoff. Mr. Slyhoff started 
at the Chamber in 1988 and served as an ac-
count representative, membership director, 
Vice President of Membership and Small Busi-
ness Development, and later became Presi-
dent/CEO in 1994. 
As one of the city’s best advocates and 
greatest boosters, he oversaw a period of 
growth for the Chamber with membership ex-
panding from 800 to more than 1,300 mem-
bers. 
Mr. Slyhoff’s accomplishments were remark-
able, and he led the Pueblo Chamber to be-
come a model for others across the West. He 
helped strengthen Pueblo’s relationship with 
one of its sister cities—Chihuahua, Mexico— 
by developing trade exchanges of business 
and tourism. He also advanced Pueblo’s busi-
ness agenda at the State Capitol and offered 
solutions for improving the workforce to the 
National Education Trust Conferences. 
Always an advocate for others, Rod in-
creased the Chamber’s involvement with the 
El Pomar Foundation and the Black, Latino 
and Asian Emerging Leadership programs. He 
also served as President of the Colorado 
Chamber of Commerce Executives, a member 
of the United Way of Pueblo board, and chair-
man of the Southern Colorado Business Part-
nership. 
Mr. Slyhoff was recognized for his heartfelt 
service to the community, and he was award-
ed the United Way Ambassador Award for Ex-
cellence, the Southern Colorado Press Club 
Mel Harmon Community Award, and the Colo-
rado State University-Pueblo President’s Me-
dallion for Distinguished Service. 
Rod Slyhoff encouraged local engagement, 
facilitated cultural development, and spread 
joy throughout the community by founding the 
Pueblo Chile & Frijoles Festival in 1994 which 
has brought as many as 150,000 people to 
Pueblo annually. Because of Rod, the ‘‘Pueblo 
Chile’’ is known throughout the world, and his 
legacy will endure through the Festival every 
year. 
Mr. Slyhoff had a quick wit, was kind to ev-
eryone, and was beloved by his community. 
He was quick to give a listening ear and offer 
gentle advice. I want to take this opportunity to 
celebrate his life and legacy and to offer my 
deepest sympathies to his wife Alice, daugh-
ters Katrina and Marcy, and the rest of Rod’s 
family and friends. May they find comfort in 
the words of Scripture, ‘‘the Lord is close to 
the brokenhearted.’’ God bless the memory of 
Rod Slyhoff.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Steven Gautsch 
on winning the Silver Key and an Honorable 
Mention Award at the 2021 Central PA Scho-
lastic Art and Writing Competition. 
Steven attends Bermudian Springs High

teenage artists and writers. 
Congratulations to Steven on this remark-
able achievement, and I wish him continued 
success as he pursues his love of art.

HONORING MATT CONSTANTINE’S 
RETIREMENT AS DIRECTOR OF 
PUBLIC 
HEALTH 
SERVICES 
IN 
KERN COUNTY 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, along with my colleague DAVID G. 
VALADAO, to honor Matthew Constantine for 
his nearly three decades of public service to 
our community. After dedicating 27 years of 
his life to government service, and protecting 
the health and safety of the people of Kern 
County, an area that I represent, Matt is con-
cluding his tenure this month as the Director 
of Kern County Public Health Services Depart-
ment for Kern County, a position he has held 
since 2009. 
Matt was born and raised in Bakersfield, 
California and earned both his bachelor’s and 
graduate degree from California State Univer-
sity, Northridge. His family has had roots in 
Bakersfield for five generations, and he has 
worked at various levels of government, in-
cluding with the Federal Indian Health Service 
and the State of California. In 2006, he was 
hired as Kem County’s Director of Environ-
mental Services. In 2009, Matt spearheaded 
the merger between two different departments 
and became the Director of Public Health 
Services for the county. 
Matt had already informed the Kern County 
Board of Supervisors of his intent to retire as 
the Director of Public Health Services when 
the Coronavirus pandemic hit. But instead of 
retiring, Matt stayed on to serve our commu-
nity and began crafting a plan to reduce pa-
tient caseloads at local hospitals and keep the 
people of Kern County healthy and safe. Dur-
ing his time with the Department of Public 
Health Services, Matt always displayed leader-
ship, especially over the course of this stress-
ful past year, by balancing local needs with 
state mandates while never shying away from 
making tough decisions. Despite many early 
days and long nights, Matt’s work ethic has 
been critical for our local response to the 
COVID–19 pandemic. This was exemplified by 
the routine COVID–19 updates he gave to the 
residents of the county over the last 12 
months, and despite the State of California’s 
constantly changing guidance for residents 
and public health officials, Matt always had 
one goal in mind—to create and execute a 
plan to combat the transmission of the virus in 
our community and keep mortality rates in 
Kern County down until a vaccine was able to 
be offered to every resident who wanted one. 
Matt is more than just the leader of our local 
public health response; he is an active mem-
ber of the Kern County community. He serves 
on the board of the Greater Bakersfield Cham-
ber of Commerce and the Kern County Net-
work for Children, where his vision and exper-
tise have been influential in making decisions 
and impacting others. 
I always appreciated Matt’s insight and wis-
dom on the public health matters affecting our 
community, and although we are going to miss 
Matt, I am confident that his record of success 
will continue to benefit our county for years to 
come. On behalf of the people of the 23rd 
Congressional District of California, and the 
people of Kern County as a whole, I want to 
thank Matt for his service to our community, 
and I wish him only the best as he embarks 
on the next chapter in his life.

CONDEMNING MILITARY COUP IN 
BURMA 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H. Res. 134, Condemning the mili-
tary coup that took place on February 1, 2021, 
in Burma and the Burmese military detention 
of civilian leaders, calling for the release of all 
those detained and for those elected to serve 
in Parliament to resume their duties, and for 
other purposes. I’m proud to be an original co-
sponsor of this important resolution. 
On February 1st the Burmese military 
shocked the world when it launched a coup 
against the democratically elected government 
of State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi, de-
clared a national state of emergency, and ar-
rested civilian members of the government. 
Since the coup, chaos has gripped the 
country. The military shut down the internet 
and imposed martial law. The Burmese peo-
ple, insistent that their country continue down 
the path toward democracy, have taken to the 
streets to protest the military’s actions, and the 
military has responded by killing at least 200 
civilians, including more than 60 on Sunday, 
March 14th, and arresting thousands. 
As the oldest democracy in the world, the 
United States must clearly and unequivocally 
condemn the Burmese military’s brutal and au-
thoritarian crackdown and violence against its 
own people. Burma has made significant 
progress in transitioning toward democracy in 
recent years, and it is heartbreaking to see 
this progress squandered in the blink of an 
eye. 
I echo President Biden’s call for the Bur-
mese military to immediately relinquish power, 
release detained officials, and refrain from 
using violence against peaceful protesters. I 
also support President Biden’s decision to im-
pose sanctions on military leaders in Burma

and freeze $1 billion of their assets that are 
held in the U.S., denying them access to 
these funds. 
This resolution not only condemns the Bur-
mese military, it sends a powerful message 
that the House of Representatives, the peo-
ple’s house in the United States Congress, 
stands firmly behind the courageous people of 
Burma as they struggle to wrest democracy 
and freedom from the hands of their authori-
tarian and corrupt military. 
I’m proud to support this resolution and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same.

SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
PETER COLE BEING NAMED THE 
OHIO PRINCIPAL OF THE YEAR 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Mr. Peter Cole, Principal of Carey 
Junior High and High School, for being named 
the Ohio Principal of the Year by the Ohio As-
sociation of Secondary School Administrators 
(OASSA). Mr. Cole, who is a former President 
of the Board of Directors for the OASSA, is 
characterized by fellow principals as a leader 
who sees himself as a servant, not only for 
Carey schools, but a vast number of school 
districts as well. 
Peter Cole graduated from Carey High 
School in 1993. He received his bachelor’s de-
gree in music and a Master of Education in 
Administration and Supervision from Bowling 
Green State University. Principal Cole went on 
to receive his Superintendent’s License from 
the University of Findlay and Ashland Univer-
sity. Before becoming principal at Carey in 
2007, he was band director at Hopewell- 
Loudon and Oak Harbor schools. 
During his time as an educator, Principal 
Cole has strived to think outside the box and 
create an environment for students to suc-
ceed. He promotes new ideas, rather than al-
ways relying on traditional methods to educate 
his students. Principal Cole uses the term 
‘‘servant leader’’ to describe his position at the 
school because he feels his role is to serve 
the students. He focuses on ensuring all of his 
students are having a good experience during 
their time at Carey schools. Principal Cole’s 
contribution to Carey Junior High and High 
School is seen in every action that he takes 
for his school. His dedication is an example 
for all of Ohio’s educational leaders. 
Congratulations to Principal Peter Cole, on 
being named the Ohio Principal of the Year.

IN RECOGNITION OF ELLA BLOOM 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Ella Bloom on 
winning the Gold Key Award at the 2021 Cen-
tral PA Scholastic Art and Writing Competition. 
Ella attends Bermudian Springs High School 
near York Springs, Pennsylvania and is pas-
sionate about art. Her drawing and illustration 
of a French Horn garnered her the top award 
at the 2021 Central PA Scholastic Art and 
Writing Competition, which was first estab-
lished in 1923 to support teenage artists and 
writers. 
Congratulations to Ella on this remarkable 
achievement, and I wish her continued suc-
cess as she pursues her love of art.

HONORING DR. MARGARET C. 
‘‘PEG’’ SNYDER 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to acknowledge and memorialize the leg-
acy of Dr. Margaret C. Snyder, referred to as 
the ‘‘United Nations’ First Feminist’’, who died 
on January 26, 2021 at the age of 91. I share 
my sincere condolences and prayers with her 
family, including her brother, Thomas Snyder. 
Dr. Snyder, who went by ‘‘Peg’’, was a trail-
blazer whose passion and determination to 
empower women transformed the U.N.’s 
mechanisms of global development aid to in-
clude millions of women in Africa, Asia, and 
Latin America. Dr. Snyder also worked to sup-
port women at the UN to move beyond being 
restricted to secretarial roles to rise to join the 
professional ranks within the organization. 
Dr. Margaret Cecilia Snyder was born the 
youngest of three children on January 30, 
1929, in East Syracuse, New York. Her father, 
Matthias, was a doctor, and her mother, 
Cecilia (Gorman) Snyder, taught Latin and 
German in a local high school. Peg graduated 
from the College of New Rochelle in West-
chester County, New York in 1950. Two years 
later she received a master’s degree in soci-
ology from the Catholic University of America 
in Washington, D.C. 
While working as the Dean of Women at Le 
Moyne College, in Syracuse, she followed 
John F. Kennedy’s call for young Americans to 
volunteer overseas by taking a one year sab-
batical to work with volunteer organizations in 
Tanganyika (which merged with Zanzibar to 
become Tanzania in 1964) and Uganda. 
Among other tasks, she arranged for African 
students to attend college in the United 
States—part of an effort known as ‘‘Kennedy 
airlifts.’’ 
When her year ended, she quit her job at Le 
Moyne and stayed in Africa, but she moved 
home in 1965 to help run the East African 
Studies program at Syracuse University. She 
advised students from the region on their 
graduate work, many of whom went on to hold 
leadership positions in their countries—the first 
threads of her continentwide network of part-
ners. In 1970, she returned to Tanzania to 
complete her Ph.D. in sociology at the Univer-
sity of Dar es Salaam, having started pursuing 
her degree in 1964. 
Upon graduation in 1971, Peg joined the 
United Nations Economic Commission for Afri-
ca (UNECA) as a co-founder of what became 
the African Training and Research Center for 
Women—the UN’s first major program di-
rected specifically at improving economic op-
portunities for women. 
In 1978, she moved to New York City, 
where she was put in charge of a develop-
ment fund focused on women, funded by vol-
untary contributions from member states. She 
built the organization (renamed the U.N. De-
velopment Fund for Women or UNIFEM) from 
operating on a shoestring budget to a global 
powerhouse that served women not just in Af-
rica but across the developing world. By the 
end of the 1980s, it had supported the cre-
ation of women’s development commissions in 
30 countries, through which the U.N. chan-
neled millions of dollars to grassroots women’s 
projects. It is now known as U.N. Women. 
One of her first grants went to Kenya’s 
Green Belt Movement, an anti-deforestation 
initiative led by the late 2004 Nobel Laureate 
for Peace and eventual close friend Wangari 
Maathai. 
After retiring from the United Nations in 
1989, Dr. Snyder was a Fulbright Scholar in 
Uganda and a Visiting Fellow at the School of 
Public and International Affairs at Princeton 
University. She also wrote or co-wrote three 
books on women’s economic development in 
Africa. 
Peg continued to serve as an informal ad-
viser to the U.N. and advocate for a long list 
of women activists and organizations, many of 
whom she hosted at her apartment in New 
York City. It was there, in 2006, that she 
helped organize the Sirleaf Market Women’s 
Fund, a program to rebuild markets across 
post-civil war Liberia, named for Liberia and 
Africa’s first female President Ellen Johnson 
Sirleaf. 
Dr. Peg Snyder’s legacy continues to bear 
fruit. In 2021, women make up a significant 
portion of the U.N. professional staff, and 
women’s issues, including development, re-
main one of the organization’s focal points. In 
her tribute to Dr. Snyder, Phumzile Mlambo- 
Ngcuka, the Executive Director of UN Women, 
assured the continuation of Peg Snyder’s leg-
acy for generations to come: ‘‘Her passing 
comes at a point where the importance of 
bringing women’s voices and skills to the fore-
front has never been more important for the 
world’s ability to move ahead resiliently and 
creatively. We thank her, honour her countless 
contributions to women across the world, and 
take forward her legacy.’’ 
We in the United States Congress com-
memorate Dr. Snyder’s work and legacy, and 
stand ready to help carry on her work to help 
women everywhere claim their rights and lift 
up themselves, their communities and nations.

HONORING THE LIFE OF NORBERT 
‘‘BUD’’ FAY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 19, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to observe and mourn the passing of a 
talented businessman, veteran, husband, fa-
ther, and a patriotic Nutmegger through and 
through—Norbert ‘‘Bud’’ Fay, of Groton, Con-
necticut. A pillar of southeastern CT, Bud 
passed away at the age of 94 at his residence 
on January 9, 2021. 
While Bud has moved on—we now cherish 
his life and the positive impact he had on the 
lives of others and his hometown of Groton. 
Born in 1927, Bud was civic minded early in 
life and was always willing to lend a hand to 
anyone in need. Bud’s commitment to his

community and country translated into his en-
listment in the United States NAVY, serving 
with the greatest generation in World War II as 
a member of a Gun Crew on Merchant Tank-
ers. During the war, Bud flew for two compa-
nies that rebuilt war surplus aircraft. His her-
oism and iron will during World War II will al-
ways be remembered by us here in eastern 
Connecticut and we cannot thank and appre-
ciate Bud enough for his commitment and sac-
rifice to our nation. 
Upon his retirement from the military, Bud 
set his sights on doing business in eastern 
Connecticut—and the rest is history. With the 
same vigor and passion he used to serve his 
country—Bud quickly developed an entrepre-
neurial flare and started his first business, a 
car dealership in Waterford. A natural busi-
nessman—Bud develop a rapport with the 
local business community and even helped ini-
tiate the Groton Business Association which 
exists to this day. With his ever-expanding 
business acumen, Bud found his way into 
working for Davis Standard in Pawcatuck and 
joined the team that pioneered the early devel-
opment of plastic product machinery. Bud hit 
the ground running as soon as he retired from 
the NAVY. As testament to his energy and 
hard work, he was once named National As-
sociation of Independent Businessmen’s New 
England’s Small Businessman of the Year. 
Later in life, Bud would go on to open a res-
taurant, laundromat, and other businesses 
which he operated on Route 12 in Groton for 
22 years. His restaurant ‘‘Pop and Mum’s’’ 
was a place where members of the NAVY 
could grab a bite to eat and have a warm con-
versation with Bud where he would regale of 
his experiences in the military and offer a 
friendly ear. Bud was always there for the 
local NAVY sailors when they needed him. 
But to his core, Bud was a fighter for his 
community. This was demonstrated in his fight 
to save the century old Naval Submarine Base 
New London, which the Pentagon under the 
Bush administration added to a list of bases 
recommended for permanent closure in 2005. 
A eastern Connecticut with no sub-base would 
have spelt economic disaster for so many in 
the Second District, not to mention the thou-
sands of NAVY personnel who were stationed 
at the base and who’s children made up a sig-
nificant portion of the area’s schools. Bud 
fought like hell to ensure that this would not 
happen and through his voice and the collec-
tive voice of all of eastern Connecticut—the 
base was taken off the list and flourishes to 
this day. Bud was never asked or obligated to 
do his part in saving the livelihoods of so 
many here in Connecticut but did so out of his 
own sheer will and we will never forget his 
commitment to save the base. 
Many in Groton and the surrounding also 
knew Bud as ‘‘Pop’’ because he was a beacon 
of wisdom and was someone who would al-
ways be there if you needed him. Bud was a 
humble man and was as down to earth as 
they came. He understood that life required 
positivity and he always said, ‘‘life’s a learning 
experience—enjoy every minute.’’ When Bud 
wasn’t running his businesses or leading a 
community initiative—he enjoyed visiting folks 
at the Fairview retirement community, using 
his flying simulator, or reading. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
and this Chamber join me in expressing our 
deepest respect for Bud’s life and that we 
send our deepest condolences to his Family. 
Bud was predeceased by his first wife Muriel 
Fay. He remarried Barbara Nelson who he 
leaves 
behind 
alongside 
two 
daughters, 
Sharlene Aspinwall and Daurene Graf, two 
stepdaughters Cheryl Elci and Laura Nelson, 
eight grandchildren and 10 great grand-
children. Bud will forever remain a symbol of 
love and patriotism in southeastern Con-
necticut and we will use his life as an inspira-
tion to do good for our community.
