PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
All that we are and all that we have 
comes from You, O God. You have 
graced us with life, abundant with love 
and abounding with opportunity. All 
we need do is look around and we can, 
with our whole being, see, hear, smell, 
taste, and touch Your generous gifts 
and know of Your extraordinary faith-
fulness to us. 
With the psalmist, we sing Your 
praises: 
Our love, Lord, reaches to the heav-
ens, Your faithfulness to the skies. 
Your righteousness is like the highest 
mountains, Your justice like the great 
deep. 
You, Lord, preserve both people and 
animals. How priceless is Your unfail-
ing love, O God. People take refuge in 
the shadow of Your wings. They feast 
on the abundance of Your house. You 
give them drink from Your river of de-
lights, for with You is the fountain of 
life. In Your light, we see light. 
Lord, hear our deepest and heartfelt 
gratitude for all You have done for us 
and who You have made us to be. 
May we live faithfully into these 
gifts. 
By the power of Your name, we pray. 
Amen.

TRIBUTE TO HOMETOWN HERO 
RONALD CRONIN 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a 15-year Dallas Police De-
partment veteran, Officer Ronald Cronin. 
Officer Cronin was recently presented with a 
Life-Saving Award from the Sons of the Amer-
ican Revolution for his courageous actions 
that stopped an active shooter at Dallas Love 
Field Airport in July. 
Thinking of others before himself, Officer 
Cronin took swift action and put his life on the 
line to ensure the hundreds of Love Field trav-
elers around him lived another day. 
Just as the shooter pulled her firearm, Offi-
cer Cronin was on the scene, giving her loud 
verbal commands to drop the weapon. 
Disregarding the verbal commands, she 
began firing her weapon at Officer Cronin and 
innocent bystanders. He quickly returned fire, 
hit the shooter, and held his position until fel-
low officers arrived to take the shooter into 
custody. 
If it weren’t for Officer Cronin’s selfless acts 
of courage, this disturbing incident could have 
ended in tragedy. On behalf of the entire Dal-
las-Fort Worth community, I thank Officer 
Cronin for his actions that day and his 15 
years of service with the Dallas Police Depart-
ment.

RECOGNIZING RUTH ELLIS 
CLAIRMOUNT CENTER 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I want to 
recognize the outstanding work of the Ruth 
Ellis Center, based in Highland Park, Michi-
gan, as they celebrate the grand opening of its 
Ruth Ellis Clairmount Center in Detroit. This 
expansion will allow Ruth Ellis Center to ex-
pand housing, access to healthcare, and com-
munity 
space 
for 
our 
most 
vulnerable 
LGBTQI+ youth in our district. 
Founded in 1999, Ruth Ellis Center has es-
tablished a national reputation for quality and 
innovation in providing trauma-informed serv-
ices 
for 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bi-attractional, 
transgender and questioning (LGBTQ+) youth, 
and young adults, with an emphasis on young 
people of color, experiencing homelessness, 
involved in the child welfare system, and/or 
experiencing barriers to health and wellbeing 
for residents in Detroit. Its mission has re-
mained true and continues to uplift and serve 
our communities. Ruth Ellis Center has imple-
mented safe and supportive environments 
around young people to build their vision for a 
positive future. The Clairmount Center ex-
pands on that vision by providing an inte-
grated health clinic at the housing center, 
while including access to a library, technical 
center, and much more. The Ruth Ellis Center 
goes above and beyond in its mission to ensu-
ing access to holistic care and support serv-
ices to one of the most underserved commu-
nities. I am proud to have secured direct in-
vestment for this critical work and project and 
I look forward to the continued partnership in 
serving our underserved. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the Ruth Ellis Center’s numerous con-
tributions on behalf of the people of southeast 
Michigan and the 13th District Strong as we 
congratulate them on the grand opening of the 
Clairmount Center.

HONORING STEVE KERR 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Steve Kerr in 
recognition of his contributions to gun violence 
prevention. 
Mr. Kerr was born in Lebanon in 1965. His 
father Malcolm served as President of the 
American University of Beirut but was shot 
and killed by a militia known as Islamic Jihad 
in 1984. At only 18 years old, this event had 
a profound effect on Mr. Kerr and inspired his 
activism. 
For over 30 years, Mr. Kerr has led an his-
toric career in professional basketball, both as 
a player and a coach. In 1986, while attending 
the University of Arizona, Mr. Kerr competed 
in the FIBA World Championship and was 
drafted by the Phoenix Suns in 1988. Over the 
next 15 years, he played on seven teams and 
won five NBA titles. Mr. Kerr retired as a play-
er in 2003 but returned to the NBA in 2014 as 
head coach of the Golden State Warriors. 
Since then, he has led the team to six NBA 
Finals and four championships—the most suc-
cessful run in franchise history. 
As someone well aware of the impact gun 
violence can have on families, Mr. Kerr has 
been especially involved in gun violence pre-
vention. In the wake of mass shootings, in-
cluding those in Parkland, Boulder, and At-
lanta, Mr. Kerr used his platform as a leading 
figure in American sports to call for congres-
sional action. During an NBA press con-
ference in May 2022, Mr. Kerr once again 
spoke out to address the shooting at Robb El-
ementary School in Uvalde, Texas. He re-
ferred to gun violence as ‘‘a public health 
issue’’ in desperate need of both recognition 
and treatment. He has supported charities and 
organizations focused on passing legislation to 
reduce gun violence such as the Giffords Law 
Center, Brady, and Sandy Hook Promise. Mr. 
Kerr has been an important part of Rock the 
Ride, a benefit bike ride and walk to help end 
gun violence. He has also dedicated much of 
his time to the East Bay chapter of Live Free, 
a national racial justice network that has 
worked to reduce gun violence in Oakland. 
Mr. Kerr is a proud father of three children, 
Nick, Maddy and Matthew, and a devoted hus-
band to his wife, Margot. 
Madam Speaker, we thank Mr. Kerr for his 
unwavering dedication to the fight against gun 
violence. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that 
we honor him here today.

HONORING TREVOR BRUNELL 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I had the pleasure of attending a cere-
mony and reception for Wounded Warrior 
Week in Mays Landing, South Jersey. At the 
event, Staff Sergeant Trevor Brunell, a United 
States Army Ranger, was honored for his 
service to our nation. 
Trevor was born in Pennsylvania in 1993 
and was raised in Maryland, where he grad-
uated top of his high school class. After at-
tending community college for a few months, 
he enlisted in the United States Army with a 
contract for training to become an Army Rang-
er. Following the basic ranger training, Trevor 
attended airborne school and then the Ranger 
Assessment and Selection Program. In the 
spring of 2014, once he had completed all the 
required trainings, he was assigned to Fort 
Benning, Georgia. 
Trevor was deployed in the winter of 2014 
to bravely serve our great nation in Afghani-
stan. In 2016, he sustained injuries in Afghani-
stan and underwent 33 surgeries, had a pros-
thetic leg installed below the knee, and spent 
6 months bedridden. Miraculously, Trevor re-
gained his strength and returned to Afghani-
stan in the winter of 2017. During his final de-
ployment, he reinjured parts of his knee and 
underwent 10 more surgeries. In August of 
2022, Trevor was medically discharged from 
the Army due to these injuries. 
SSG Trevor Brunell is a brave and resilient 
patriot, and I want to thank him for his heroic 
service to our great nation. God Bless SSG 
Trevor Brunell, and God Bless our America.

key states while strengthening the political 
power of the Latinx community. As the daugh-
ter of immigrant parents, Yadira grew up in a 
mixed-status home and learned about the 
inner workings of her community’s upward bat-
tle. Her passion to advocate for families like 
hers led her to champion the work she is 
doing today in Florida and beyond, being a 
fierce advocate for economic, environmental, 
and immigrant justice. 
Poder Latinx launched its efforts in 2019 in 
Orlando, Florida, and today has operations in 
four states. Since 2019, Poder Latinx has 
knocked on doors across Central Florida for 
voter registration and mobilization efforts, 
hosted community events and information ses-
sions on economic, environmental, and immi-
grant justice, and tailored a culturally and lan-
guage accessible message to inform and mo-
bilize Central Florida’s Latinx community. Most 
recently, the organization opened a second of-
fice in Central Florida located in Kissimmee to 
expand accessibility to the Latinx community. 
Yadira’s steadfast commitment to Central Flor-
ida is present through all of the programs 
Poder Latinx executes. 
Yadira earned her bachelor’s degree from 
the University of California at Santa Barbara, 
and her master’s degree from the George 
Washington University. She previously served 
as the development director for Mi Familia 
Vota, where she helped raise over $20 million 
and expanded strategic partnerships with 
major organizations to increase year-round 
civic participation efforts within the Latinx com-
munity. She was also proud to support the 
Fast for Families campaign for immigration re-
form during her time in the immigration depart-
ment at the SEIU.

TRIBUTE TO MARK KELLAM 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in memory of a constituent of mine, Mark 
Kellam, who passed away on September 27, 
2022. Mark was one of my district’s pre-
eminent newsmen—a veteran chronicler and 
good government watchdog, but most impor-
tantly, a neighbor, mentor and friend who 
fiercely loved his community and was deeply 
kind. 
Mark was born in New Castle, Indiana, to 
the late Josephine and James Kellam, and 
from the very beginning appeared destined for 
a career in storytelling. At Tri Junior Senior 
High School, he excelled in just about every 
expression of the narrative form: as a theater 
kid, a prizewinning speech competitor, and 
editor of the yearbook. While his talents and 
passions varied widely, his callings ultimately 
coalesced around a bachelor’s degree in jour-
nalism, which he obtained from Indiana Uni-
versity in 1984. 
After more than a decade of reporting for 
his hometown paper and throughout the Mid-
west, Mark’s yearning for adventure drew him 
westward to Chino, California. It was in Cali-
fornia that Mark met the love of his life, Jeffrey 
Waack, and in 2004 Mark moved to West Hol-
lywood to be with him. This cultural capital in 
my district was the setting for their many 
beautiful years together, including spending 
time in landmark establishments like Micky’s, 
the Revolver Video Bar, and Basix. The latter 
is where Mark proposed to Jeff, and as soon 
as same-sex marriage became legal in Cali-
fornia in 2008, they were wed at Kings Road 
Park. 
As a new Angeleno, Mark quickly rose 
through the ranks of esteemed local publica-
tions like the Los Angeles Daily News and the 
Los Angeles Times Community News, where 
he was the city editor for the Glendale News- 
Press and Burbank Leader leading a team of 
reporters and editors, and mentoring many 
young staff who came through its doors. Most 
recently, he took the helm locally for the Out-
look News Group. It was during these times 
that I got to know and talk with Mark often, 
and came to appreciate the intense kindness 
and heart he applied to his craft. Journalism— 
especially local journalism—is a hard busi-
ness, but Mark made it seem effortless de-
spite the hours he spent behind the scenes 
bringing countless stories to life. 
Though his journalism career was leg-
endary, so too were his pursuits of those 
many talents and passions acquired in his 
youth. Mark was a renowned karaoke singer, 
a longtime member of the L.A. Wranglers 
country dance group, and a wonderful play-
wright whose work was produced in New 
York, Dayton, and Indianapolis. He loved cats, 
the ocean, and traveling with Jeff and their 
friends. 
Mark’s legacy will live on through his mas-
terful stories, as well as those of the many 
young reporters he mentored over the years. 
And it will live on through all those whose lives 
he touched with his unwavering warmth, 
humor, and heart. 
Madam Speaker, I ask all Members to join 
me in offering my sincerest condolences to 
Mark’s husband, Jeff, and his loving family, 
friends, and readers across my district, and in 
remembering Mark Kellam for his service to 
West Hollywood, Glendale, Burbank, Los An-
geles, and beyond.

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF UT HEALTH SAN ANTO-
NIO’S 
GRADUATE 
SCHOOL 
OF 
BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the 50th anniversary of UT 
Health San Antonio’s Graduate School of Bio-
medical Sciences (GSBS). For decades, 
GSBS has led our nation in educating future 
biomedical professionals. Please join me in 
recognizing its extraordinary achievements. 
Since October 21, 1972, GSBS has pro-
duced more than 4,000 graduates who are 
working worldwide in academia, the sciences, 
and other key industries. The school offers 21 
academic programs and serves students from 
across the nation, with a particular focus on 
students from underrepresented backgrounds 
and 
economically-disadvantaged 
groups. 
GSBS programs are designed to provide a 
foundation of knowledge and scientific inquiry 
in the pursuit of educating students in contem-
porary areas of the biomedical sciences. 
GSBS faculty work on cutting-edge research 
in areas such as cancer, heart disease, and 
neurogenerative disorders. GSBS is one of 
only 11 institutions with National Institutes of 
Health (NIH)-funded Doctor of Dental Surgery/ 
Doctor of Philosophy and Doctor of Medicine/ 
Doctor of Philosophy combined degrees. 
Madam Speaker, UT Health San Antonio’s 
Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences 
(GSBS) is a pillar of our extraordinary commu-
nity. GSBS will continue to remain at the fore-
front of scientific exploration. I congratulate 
GSBS on their 50th anniversary year. I look 
forward to seeing the many great things GSBS 
and its students will accomplish in the years to 
come.

RECOGNIZING PRESIDENT BARRY 
DUNN 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
President Barry Dunn of South Dakota State 
University for winning the Harold W. McGraw 
Jr. Prize in Education. This award is a testa-
ment to the progress President Dunn has 
made during his tenure to improve academic 
access and success in Indian Country through 
the Wokini Initiative and the New Beginnings 
Initiative. Education is an undisputed path to 
better career prospects and is vital to those in 
Indian Country facing staggering unemploy-
ment rates. 
Investing in recruitment, retention, and grad-
uation of Tribal students is a critical step to 
helping them participate in the American econ-
omy and the American Dream. I am proud that 
I, along with my colleagues, have been able to 
successfully secure Federal funding for the 
New Beginnings Initiative during my time in 
Congress. 
Madam Speaker, the Harold W. McGraw, Jr. 
Prize in Education is one of the most competi-
tive and prestigious awards in education. I ask 
that my colleagues join me in congratulating 
President Barry Dunn for this remarkable 
achievement.

CELEBRATING 25 YEARS OF 
AMIGOS BLOCK WATCH 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Amigos Block Watch, 
which will celebrate its 25th anniversary this 
month. 
Amigos Block Watch was formed by a group 
of community members in Phoenix who work 
together to minimize crime in their neighbor-
hoods. For 25 years, Amigos Block Watch has 
hosted community meetings where individuals 
can voice their concerns or questions, helping 
provide resources from community action offi-
cers and keeping the Phoenix City Council in-
formed. Amigos Block Watch also hosts 
events that bring the community together, 
building a more inclusive city. They are also

impactful safety issues. 
For so many years, Amigos Block Watch 
has been ensuring everybody feels safe in 
their community. They have lived up to their 
message of ‘‘One Neighborhood, One Family’’. 
Their community efforts continue to provide 
free resources and support to those in need, 
and they continue to advocate for the mem-
bers of the community while never backing 
down from the fight to create neighborhoods 
where all feel safe. 
I would like to again congratulate Amigos 
Block Watch on their 25th anniversary. I hope 
Phoenix has this incredible organization for 
decades to come.

HONORING 
THE 
45TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY 
COLLEGE 
HON. CONNIE CONWAY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Ms. CONWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize San Joaquin Valley College 
for its 45 years of service in the State of Cali-
fornia. 
San Joaquin Valley College (SJVC) was es-
tablished in 1977 by Shirley and Robert Perry. 
Shirley earned medical assistance certifi-
cations despite training programs being un-
available, while Robert worked in a tire fac-
tory. Their early struggles, which were similar 
to those of many San Joaquin Valley families, 
inspired the Perrys to address the regional 
need for local, quality career training. 
SJVC first opened in the City of Visalia, 
California, offering a medical assisting class. 
When only three students attended, Shirley 
went to work building relationships with com-
munity stakeholders and doing publicity, even 
putting fliers on cars at grocery stores. This 
commitment eventually paid off, as SJVC ex-
panded rapidly in the succeeding decades. 
Today, SJVC serves thousands of students 
on seventeen campuses and online. Its reach 
has expanded outside the Central Valley, with 
locations in both Northern and Southern Cali-
fornia. SJVC’s programs have grown far be-
yond the initial medical assisting certification, 
offering more than twenty accelerated certifi-
cate and Associate of Science degree pro-
grams in the medical, business, and technical 
fields. Its emphasis on balancing hands-on 
training and academic instruction has been 
fruitful—as of 2021, SJVC has awarded more 
than seventy-two thousand certificates and de-
grees. 
SJVC has maintained its heart for commu-
nity service amid its expansion. Since 1998, 
the college has provided more than $7 million 
in free dental services to more than twenty- 
thousand patients in underserved commu-
nities. 
While SJVC earns many accolades and 
awards, it is most proud of its identity as a 
second-generation, family run institution. Shir-
ley and Robert’s sons, Mark and Mike, took 
over operations in 1995 and today lead the 
college as Chairman and Chief Executive Offi-
cer/President, respectively. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to 
join me in commending San Joaquin Valley 
College for 45 years of service to the Valley 
community and for many more decades of 
growth and success to come.

HONORING THE OPENING OF 
VICTORY GARDENS 
HON. JOSH HARDER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the opening of Victory 
Gardens in French Camp, California. Upon its 
opening, Victory Gardens will deliver housing 
and access to crucial resources for over forty 
homeless veterans in our community, thus 
providing a stable foundation that our local he-
roes deserve. 
Veteran homelessness is an issue that im-
pacts every corner of this country, and our 
community is not immune to this problem. No 
one who fought for our freedom should ever 
have to spend a night on the streets. Victory 
Gardens works towards solving this problem, 
as it has 48 units earmarked specifically for 
veterans struggling to find permanent housing. 
Victory Gardens will do more than provide 
housing, as the development is focused on 
helping our veterans with their mental and 
physical health as well. In line with this goal, 
the community will include a garden, common, 
computer room, and is located near San Joa-
quin General Hospital. 
This life changing project has been made a 
reality thanks to the hard work, collaboration, 
and genuine care of so many in our commu-
nity. Advocacy for this development came 
from the federal, state, and local levels in the 
form of letters, official applications, and lob-
bying. The funding comes from organizations 
and agencies like the State Veteran Housing 
and Homelessness Prevention fund, Low In-
come Housing Tax Credits, and much more. 
Finally, DFA Development and the Housing 
Authority of San Joaquin County worked to-
gether and saw this project through to comple-
tion. Though the problem of veteran home-
lessness persists, Victory Gardens is a major 
step towards our collective goal of ensuring 
that each and every veteran has a secure 
place to live. 
Our way of life is only made possible thanks 
to the immense sacrifices of our men and 
women in uniform. It is our obligation to be 
there when they need us, and that is exactly 
what Victory Gardens does. I am grateful for 
the work done by those in our community to 
make this project a reality, and immensely 
proud to honor the opening of Victory Gar-
dens.

HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY TO WIL-
LIAM LEUCHTENBURG, EMINENT 
HISTORIAN 
HON. DAVID E. PRICE 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor the life and work of 
Professor William (Bill) Leuchtenburg, who 
celebrated his 100th birthday on September 
28 and will be feted by his friends in Chapel 
Hill, North Carolina, the hometown we share, 
this weekend. Bill is a distinguished scholar, 
devoted educator, and friend and counselor to 
many, including myself. 
In fact, reading Bill’s ‘‘The Perils of Pros-
perity, 1914–32’’ as an undergraduate 62 
years ago helped attract me to completing a 
history major at UNC-Chapel Hill. In the 
1980s, I assigned successive editions of ‘‘In 
the Shadow of FDR’’ to my classes in Amer-
ican Political Thought. In the meantime, I had 
gotten to know Bill personally through his fel-
lowships at the National Humanities Center 
and his assumption—after a distinguished 30- 
year career at Columbia University—of a 
Kenan professorship at the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
Bill won the Bancroft Prize and the Parkman 
Prize of the Society of American Historians for 
‘‘Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, 
1932–1940.’’ with Samuel Eliott Morrison and 
Henry Steele Commager, he took the two-vol-
ume ‘‘The Growth of the American Republic’’ 
through two editions. He dealt with key as-
pects of the Roosevelt era in ‘‘The Supreme 
Court Reborn: The Constitutional Revolution in 
the Age of Roosevelt’’ and ‘‘The FDR Years: 
On Roosevelt and His Legacy.’’ His published 
articles range from ‘‘The Needless War with 
Spain’’ to ‘‘Court Packing Plans,’’ ‘‘Jimmy Car-
ter and the Post-New Deal Presidency,’’ and 
‘‘The Boston Red Sox, 1901–1946.’’ 
Bill’s long, varied, and impactful bibliography 
earned him his first Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. 
Prize for distinguished writing in American his-
tory of enduring public significance, awarded 
by the Society of American Historians. But the 
printed record only begins to reveal Bill 
Leuchtenburg’s impact on America’s self-un-
derstanding and public life. By virtue of his ef-
fervescent personality, boundless energy, and 
strong ethic of civic engagement, Bill’s range 
of activities and their impact are remarkable 
even for a 100-year life span. His political en-
gagements go back to the 1940s, when he 
was a state director for the Americans for 
Democratic Action, field staff for the A. Philip 
Randolph Institute, and an organizer for Rich-
ard Bolling’s first campaign for the U.S. 
House. In 1987, he joined Walter Dellinger 
and John Hope Franklin in testifying against 
Robert Bork’s appointment to the Supreme 
Court. He served over many years as an elec-
tion analyst and commentator on presidential 
inaugurations for national networks. He has 
advised and appeared in many of Ken Burns’ 
acclaimed documentaries on topics including 
the Civil War, the Roosevelts, the Vietnam 
War, National Parks, baseball and country 
music. 
When Bill’s international colleagues honored 
him at Cambridge University upon the 30th 
anniversary of ‘‘Franklin D. Roosevelt and the 
New Deal,’’ they entitled the session ‘‘In the 
Shadow of Leuchtenburg,’’ a takeoff on the 
title of the book on FDR’s impact that he took 
through six editions. Indeed, Bill casts a long 
shadow with works translated into multiple lan-
guages, a teaching and lecture circuit that in-
cludes most of the U.S. and Western Europe, 
Russia, Israel, and South Africa, and a huge 
worldwide network of students, colleagues, 
collaborators, and admirers. 
I am privileged to count myself in that circle 
of colleagues and friends, and North Carolina 
is exceedingly grateful and proud that this pre-
eminent scholar and exemplary citizen has

RECOGNIZING TEDDY TENDLER 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an outstanding constituent 
in my district, Teddy Tendler. Teddy is an 
eight-year-old student at Congregation Kol 
Emet in Yardley, Pennsylvania. In April, Teddy 
decided to incorporate her passion for tech-
nology towards supporting her community. 
With the support of her parents, Jared and 
Corey, Teddy launched a Facebook campaign 
as a service project for Hebrew School. Her 
goal was to donate laptops to Family Service 
Association of Bucks County, which operates 
an emergency homeless shelter. Teddy was 
able to provide six laptops, six sets of head-
phones, a printer, paper, and ink to Family 
Service Homeless Shelter residents in Levit-
town, Pennsylvania. Whether they are used 
for education or just playing games and being 
a kid like Teddy, these computers will make a 
large impact for both homeless kids and 
adults. In August, Teddy was awarded the 
‘‘6ABC Hometown Hero Award’’ from Family 
Service Association to recognize her fund-
raising efforts. We are incredibly grateful for 
the positive impact Teddy has had on our 
community. I wish her continued success in 
her future endeavors.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO 
CONSTANTINE P. KIAMOS, JR. 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I had the pleasure of attending the 
Dorothy Volunteer Fire Company’s presen-
tation of their 50-years of service plaques. At 
the event, Constantine Kiamos, Jr. was hon-
ored with a plaque for his dedicated service to 
the company. 
Constantine is a lifelong South Jersey resi-
dent who graduated from Vineland High 
School in 1971. He joined the Dorothy Volun-
teer Fire Company right after his high school 
graduation in 1972 and has been an active 
member ever since. In addition to serving in 
the fire company, Constantine also served the 
South Jersey community as an EMT, Deputy 
Emergency Management Coordinator, and as 
a Crew Member with the NJ Forest Fire Serv-
ice. His only break from actively working at the 
Dorothy Volunteer Fire Company was when 
he was an Active-Duty member of the United 
States military. 
Constantine should be proud of his dedica-
tion to both the fire company and our country, 
and I want to sincerely thank him for his serv-
ice. God Bless Constantine, and God Bless 
our America. 
HONORING WARDEN JEFFREY E. 
KRUEGER 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Warden Jeffrey E. Krueger of the United 
States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners 
(USMCFP) in Springfield, Missouri. 
Warden Krueger started his career with the 
Bureau of Prisons as a Correctional Officer at 
the United States Penitentiary Terre Haute, In-
diana, in 1989. He has since served as a 
Lead Foreman at FMC Lexington, Computer 
Services Manager at FDC Oakdale and FCI 
Pekin, Management Analyst-Program Review 
Division in the Central Office, Regional Com-
puter Services Manager in the North Central 
Regional 
Office, 
Associate 
Warden 
at 
USMCFP Springfield, Warden at FDC Duluth, 
Warden at FCI Schuylkill, Warden at FCI 
Pekin, Complex Warden at FCC Terre Haute, 
Regional Director for the North Central Re-
gion, and finally as the Warden at USMCFP 
Springfield. He currently serves in Senior Ex-
ecutive Service. 
In September of 2020, Warden Krueger 
asked the Bureau of Prisons to end his career 
at USMCFP Springfield after serving as Re-
gional Director for the North Central Region. 
He will be retiring in December 2022, and is 
building his new home in Nixa, Missouri. Dur-
ing his two stints at USMCFP Springfield, 
Warden Krueger has become involved in the 
local community and the Ozarks in general. 
Madam Speaker, Warden Krueger has loy-
ally served the Bureau of Prisons in a variety 
of roles for 33 years. I would like to thank him 
for his dedicated service and congratulate him, 
his wife, Dawn, and his son, Drake, on his re-
tirement.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF BILL JIMMERSON 
HON. MATTHEW M. ROSENDALE, SR. 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to a dedicated public servant and 
Montana legend, Bill Jimmerson, who passed 
away last week at the age of 74. Bill will best 
be remembered for his outsized impact in 
Montana. As a well-known Montana State FFA 
advisor and an agricultural educator, Bill 
taught and influenced thousands of agriculture 
advocates, government officials, and aspiring 
students over his 32 years of service. 
Bill drew his inspiration for agriculture from 
his father, who was the FFA advisor for 
Lewistown, Montana. His father corralled him 
one day and asked a young Bill if he wanted 
to stay in Winifred to play sports or go to 
Lewistown to receive an education. Bill, inter-
ested in agriculture at the time, decided to go 
to Lewistown with his father and embark on a 
journey that would change his life forever. 
His time in Lewistown would eventually lead 
to a career in teaching in Conrad, Montana. In 
1980, he began teaching at Conrad High 
School, providing students with the knowledge 
and skills needed to start their own careers in 
state agricultural sales and management. In 
2003, he concluded his teaching career and 
became an Agricultural Loan Officer for Stock-
man Bank. Bill then served as Montana State 
FFA Advisor from 2005 to 2013. During his 
tenure, he was widely known for the breadth 
and depth of his knowledge: he was familiar 
with every parcel of land and had a grasp on 
agricultural issues facing the entire state. 
Many drew inspiration from Bill and often 
sought his advice. 
Bill was known as an architect of Montana 
agriculture. In 2012 he developed a national 
program for Native American FFA members, 
earning recognition from the White House and 
laying the groundwork for more improvements 
across the state. His national program encour-
aged many Native Americans to become more 
immersed in agriculture, allowing more Mon-
tanans to invest in their state and its policies. 
Bill Jimmerson will be missed, not just by 
family and friends, but by all Montanans who 
were touched by his service. His impact will 
continue to be felt as the next generation pre-
pares to tackle Montana’s most pressing agri-
cultural issues. Bill has left an indelible mark 
on his community and Montana agriculture— 
he will be remembered fondly.

RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF UTAH 
STATE REPRESENTATIVE KEVEN 
STRATTON 
HON. JOHN R. CURTIS 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD the following op-ed: 
[From the Deseret News, Sept. 27, 2022] 
OPINION: THIS UTAH CLIMATE ACTION IS A WIN 
FOR ALL SIDES 
(By Keven Stratton) 
The recent divisive partisan fight in Wash-
ington over the Democrats’ controversial 
$369 billion climate legislation was dis-
appointing to watch. 
Equally troubling is how the climate and 
energy provisions in the bill are being 
‘‘scored’’ as a ‘‘zero-sum game.’’ Renewable 
energy provisions are deemed a ‘‘win’’ for cli-
mate, while provisions supporting fossil fuel 
use are viewed as a ‘‘loss.’’ 
A much better public policy approach is to 
develop the broadest bipartisan consensus on 
as many issues as possible. Utah has shown 
that on important climate questions not 
only can we achieve this but that unanimity 
is even possible. 
In the last legislative session, we unani-
mously passed and Gov. Spencer Cox signed 
HCR1, ‘‘Concurrent Resolution to Work To-
gether to Address the Climate, Public Lands, 
and Carbon Sequestration,’’ which lays out a 
win-win strategy for protecting and improv-
ing our natural resources and the environ-
ment while also significantly controlling 
greenhouse gases. 
The underlying approach in HCR1 is to pro-
tect the atmospheric carbon now being 
stored in natural systems like forests and 
rangeland soils while also sequestering addi-
tional CO2 by better harnessing the proc-
esses 
nature 
has 
perfected 
and 
proven 
throughout the ages. 
Everyone understands how forest fires 
massively contribute to air pollution and 
produce greenhouse gases. Less well under-
stood is the importance of rangeland and soil 
health, and HCR1 also highlights this. The 
proven potential here is enormous, as several 
examples illustrate. Dr. Fred Provenza, 
world-renowned emeritus professor at Utah 
State University, and several colleagues 
have estimated that simply restoring the 
soil health of the world’s historic grasslands 
could ‘‘lower greenhouse gas concentrations 
to pre-industrial levels in a matter of dec-
ades.’’ 
The Rodale Institute has done extensive 
surveys and conducted field trials of organic 
and regenerative agriculture practices in the 
U.S. and abroad. Based on this they con-
clude: ‘‘We have proven that organic agri-
culture and, specifically, regenerative or-
ganic agriculture can sequester carbon from 
the atmosphere and reverse climate change 
. . . . With the use of cover crops, compost, 
crop rotation and reduced tillage, we can ac-
tually sequester more carbon than is cur-
rently emitted, tipping the needle past 100% 
to reverse climate change.’’ 
This approach is also a win-win because 
these natural sequestration processes also 
generate many valuable ‘‘co-benefits.’’ These 
include improved water quality and quan-
tity, better fish and wildlife habitat, in-
creased biodiversity, improved food and com-
modity yields using far less chemicals, bet-
ter drought resiliency, reduced flooding and 
danger of catastrophic wildfire, as well as 
stronger and more prosperous rural econo-
mies, among others. 
HCR1 focuses primarily on improving fed-
eral forest management to better prevent 
catastrophic wildfires but its basic principles 
are broadly applicable. While the federal 
government is beginning to incorporate some 
of its recommendations in managing forests 
and rangelands, these efforts are pitifully in-
adequate in light of the magnitude of both 
the problems and the potential for remedi-
ation. 
One 
of 
HCR1’s 
most 
significant 
rec-
ommendations is that the federal govern-
ment adopt a ‘‘social benefits of carbon con-
trol’’ test to rank climate policy options. 
Since many different policies can lower 
greenhouse gas levels, it is only common 
sense 
and 
responsible 
policy-making 
to 
choose the most co-beneficial ones. Applying 
this test would allow us to transition to the 
energy sources of the future more gradually, 
rationally, economically and responsibly 
while still addressing climate concerns. It 
would mean we could still provide the afford-
able, abundant and reliable energy that is so 
essential to improving and maintaining our 
quality of life. Rather than engaging in a 
zero-sum game, we could choose a win-win 
solution. HCR1 passed unanimously because 
it incorporates such a ‘‘climate-smart’’ ap-
proach. It teaches an important lesson that, 
sadly, Washington has yet to learn.

HONORING JOSH NASS 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to acknowledge someone I have the privilege 
of calling both a friend and close colleague. 
Josh Nass is a leader in both the Jewish and 
pro-Israel communities, and someone whose 
contributions to strengthening our nation’s alli-
ance with the State of Israel has been critical 
to fostering the US-Israel relationship. 
As Israel finds itself under constant attack 
on the battlefield, it is incumbent upon mem-
bers of this chamber to speak out in her de-
fense. But sadly Israel is not just the subject 
of a military war; but also facing a continuous 
onslaught of attack in the public domain. 
Intellectually dishonest movements such as 
the Boycott Divestment & Sanctions campaign 
have exposed Israel’s detractors for their un-
mitigated hate toward a country whose con-
tributions to the Western world are enumer-
able. For that reason I believe it to be fitting 
for leaders such as Josh who fearlessly stand 
up for our nation’s lone friend and ally in the 
Middle East to be recognized for having the 
courage of their convictions to speak truth to 
power. 
For his fearless advocacy on Israel’s behalf, 
Josh was recently honored alongside Sec-
retary of State Pompeo with the Builder of Je-
rusalem Award. Among the distinguished gov-
ernment officials who recognized him for his 
award was The State Department’s former 
Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy 
and Public Affairs, Heather Nauert. 
Josh is also involved in a myriad of social 
and public policy endeavors designed to ad-
vance a more muscular American foreign pol-
icy, while ensuring our nation’s steadfast sup-
port for Israel remains unwavering. Among 
these commitments is his service as the 
Treasurer of The Israel Heritage Foundation, 
an organization dedicated to strengthening 
Israel’s security and combatting bigotry and 
antisemitism in all forms.

HONORING HAPPY TRAILS RIDING 
ACADEMY 
HON. CONNIE CONWAY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Ms. CONWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Happy Trails Riding Acad-
emy for decades of service in the San Joaquin 
Valley of California. 
Happy Trails was founded in 1984 as a 
small, backyard program in Tulare, California, 
providing therapy through horseback riding. 
While the academy began by serving only a 
few riders, its operation has expanded into a 
beautiful facility serving thousands of rides 
each year. 
The sole, fully accredited therapeutic riding 
center in the San Joaquin Valley between Mo-
desto and Bakersfield, Happy Trails serves 
people of all ages, but mostly children. 
Through horseback riding, the academy pro-
vides an alternative to traditional therapy for 
people suffering from physical, cognitive, and 
emotional disabilities including Cerebral Palsy, 
ADD, ADHD, head trauma, brain injury, sight 
and hearing impairments, Autism, and Down 
Syndrome. 
Aside from physical improvements, Happy 
Trails is proud of the psychological benefits 
their therapy provides, including improved self- 
confidence, increased interest in the outside 
world, emotional control, self-discipline, and a 
sense of normality. The social improvements 
are also worth noting: riders gain new friends 
and a sense of joy they’ve often lost in life. 
Happy Trails is volunteer driven—an aver-
age of seventy-five people volunteer each 
week, donating more than eleven-thousand 
hours of service yearly. The academy also 
partners with major community organizations 
including Tulare Youth Service Bureau, Tulare 
County Mental Health, United Way, and 
Kaweah 
Delta 
Rehabilitation 
Center 
of 
Kaweah Delta Hospital. Appreciative of the 
support the community provides, Happy Trails 
reciprocates by opening its facility for events 
by other nonprofits.

TRIBUTE TO HOMETOWN HERO 
LORI CERAMI 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Lori Cerami, a North Texan 
who took an unimaginable tragedy and turned 
it into a lifesaving difference for our commu-
nity. 
After her daughter Elise fatally drowned dur-
ing swim practice, Lori took this tragedy and 
created the Swim4Elise Foundation to ensure 
no other child suffers the same fate. 
Every summer, the Swim4Elise Foundation 
provides free water safety classes to more 
than 5,000 daycare children in North Texas. 
They also provide full scholarships for Amer-
ican Red Cross lifeguard training programs so 
trained swimmers are always on alert. 
Because of her efforts—and immense love 
for her late daughter—mothers and fathers 
across North Texas may rest easy knowing 
their children are in good hands. On behalf of 
our entire community, I thank Lori for taking 
her family’s tragedy and turning it into a beau-
tiful act of public service.

HONORING MAGGIE SALINAS 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Maggie Salinas, 
a native of Kingsville, Texas, who served her 
community for over 70 years. Ms. Salinas was 
a member on over two dozen boards and 
committees 
that 
helped 
the 
people 
of 
Kingsville across many different areas of life. 
In 1951 at the age of 17, Ms. Salinas was 
the first and youngest Hispanic woman hired 
by Kleberg County. She started her career 
with the Kleberg Welfare Department as a so-
cial worker, helping people achieve independ-
ence. In April of 1957, she worked with county 
officials and automotive industry experts to get 
the ‘‘Safety Belt’’ Seal adopted which certified 
seat belts. She later moved on to work for 
Duval County as a social worker, all the while 
helping Nueces County administer the polio 
vaccine and tuberculosis screenings. 
Ms. Salinas has sponsored 4 Girl Scout 
troops and served as a member of the 
Kleberg County Parks and Recreation Board. 
She has served as the Chairwoman of the 
Kleberg County Historical Development Board 
since 1999, preserving the rich history of 
South Texas. In 2005 she received a Local 
Committee of Honor Award from the Smithso-
nian Center for Latino Initiatives Centro Ala-
meda, the University of Texas at San Antonio 
Institute of Texas Cultures and was recog-
nized for her participation with ‘‘Our Journeys/ 
Our Stories: Portraits of Latino Achievement’’ 
from the Smithsonian U.S. Traveling Exhi-
bition. 
Ms. Salinas currently serves as the Texas 
A&M University-Kingsville Engineering Depart-
ment Advisory Committee Chairwoman. As 
Chairwoman, she works with Texas A&M Uni-
versity-Kingsville engineering professors and 
students to compile information for the Calle 
Siete Project. This data will be utilized in po-
tential economic revitalization and tourist op-
portunities of the historic Kingsville area, es-
tablishing a cultural zone. One revelation from 
the Calle Siete Project was the unveiling of 
the ‘‘Los Kinenos Trail’’. The Los Kinenos Trail 
honors the King Ranch Kinenos who played a 
role in founding the historic King Ranch. Her 
dedication to community and culture is seen in 
her founding role of ‘‘La Posada’’, a Christmas 
tradition event, in 1990, her work redesig-
nating over 80 historical streets in La Colonia 
Mexicana to include their original names, and 
her instrumental role in the restoration of the 
Mother Julia Chapel and Museum. 
A true humanitarian, Ms. Salinas has 
planned and led fundraising events for the Na-
tional Kidney Foundation. American Cancer 
Society, and the American Heart Association. 
She was also awarded the American Heart 
Association Texas Affiliate Leadership Award 
in recognition of volunteer service in a leader-
ship role and expanding role of the American 
Heart Association—to name one of many 
awards she has been honored with. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Maggie Salinas is an 
incredible leader with an unwavering commit-
ment to the development of the Kingsville 
community. Her legacy will have a lasting im-
pact on South Texas.

COMMENDING 
KAZAKHSTAN 
FOR 
HOSTING 
THE 
SEVENTH 
CON-
GRESS ON WORLD AND TRADI-
TIONAL RELIGIONS 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, today I 
would like to commend President Kassym- 
Jomart 
Tokayev 
and 
the 
Republic 
of 
Kazakhstan for hosting the seventh Congress 
on World and Traditional Religions. 
This year was the largest such forum to 
date with more than 100 delegations from over 
50 nations, with a focus of a post-pandemic 
world. It was a historic event and included rep-
resentatives from most major faiths including 
Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, and 
others. Notably, Pope Francis made his first 
appearance at the Congress on World and 
Traditional Religions and Israel’s Ashkenazi 
Chief Rabbi David Lau attended. 
Madam Speaker, at a tumultuous time in the 
world, this event was an important opportunity 
for faith leaders to work to promote and pro-
tect freedom of religious expression and wor-
ship in all nations. 
Notably, it included a panel that focused on 
the role faiths play in supporting the social sta-
tus of women; the panel specifically discussed 
ways faiths around the world can bolster 
women and families. The opportunity to dis-
cuss these very important issues was a wel-
come addition. 
I would also like to acknowledge the Dec-
laration of VII Congress of the Leaders of 
World and Traditional Religions, which was 
adopted at the Congress on September 15th. 
I commend these types of gatherings and 
the Republic of Kazakhstan for again hosting 
this event and promoting a robust and mean-
ingful dialogue among many faith leaders from 
around the world.

HONORING TERESA FOSTER 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Teresa Foster 
for over 30 years of service to the Latino 
Community. Her dedication to serving others 
is clear through her work as an immigration 
consultant and community activist. 
Ms. Foster was born in Mexico City to a 
family of 10 children. She went to school in 
Mexico City with the goal of becoming a bilin-
gual executive administrative assistant. She 
became a U.S. citizen over 25 years ago, and 
made her way to Napa, California. 
After coming to the United States, Ms. Fos-
ter remained focused on helping the immigrant 
community. She supported hundreds of fami-
lies as an immigration consultant and pro-
duced ‘‘Crossing the Line’’, a bilingual column 
that appeared in newspapers throughout 
Northern California, and focused on helping 
readers understand immigration issues. Cur-
rently, she is the host of Charlando con Te-
resa Foster, a TV show that includes guests 
from diverse backgrounds. 
Ms. Foster is an active member of the Napa 
community. She was President of the Napa 
County Hispanic Network, where she received 
a ‘‘Lifetime Achievement’’ and ‘‘Friend of the 
Network’’ award. Ms. Foster was the President 
or Chair of the Board of Directors for four or-
ganizations and a member of many others, in-
cluding the Latino Advisory Board. Currently, 
she maintains leadership positions in three or-
ganizations, including the Women’s Club of 
Napa Valley. 
Ms. Foster is well-known by others in her 
community as someone who embodies per-
sistence, kindness, and selflessness. She is 
incredibly driven and has found great success 
as a leader who works to bring individuals to-
gether for a common goal. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Teresa 
Foster has dedicated her life to serving others 
in the Napa community and beyond. There-
fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today.

the goal of a breast cancer-free world for all. 
The initiative has inspired hope in millions of 
Americans and has helped save countless 
lives. 
The Este´e Lauder Companies’ Breast Can-
cer Campaign has, in conjunction with the 
Este´e Lauder Companies Charitable Founda-
tion, dedicated more than $108 million to sup-
port research, education, and medical serv-
ices. This includes more than $86 million in 
funding for medical research grants through 
the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The 
Campaign has also helped to improve the 
early detection of breast cancer, which is es-
sential for treatment. Since 1989, increased 
use of early detection and more effective treat-
ments have caused the breast cancer death 
rate in the U.S. to fall by 41 percent. 
Despite these gains, the work of The Cam-
paign is still needed, as breast cancer con-
tinues to affect millions of people around the 
world every year. In 2022, it is estimated that 
287,850 cases of invasive breast cancer will 
be diagnosed, and 43,250 women are ex-
pected to lose their lives. In Western New 
York, it is estimated that more than 1,450 peo-
ple will be diagnosed with breast cancer this 
year. 
Institutions in Western New York continue to 
lead in the field of breast cancer research, 
prevention, and treatment. Roswell Park Com-
prehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo continues 
to be one of the top-ranked cancer treatment 
centers in the world, with breast cancer sur-
vival rates higher than national outcomes. 
I applaud the work that the Este´e Lauder 
Companies’ Breast Cancer Campaign has 
done in America and Western New York. It is 
more important than ever that we remain com-
mitted to making strides toward a breast can-
cer-free world.

RETIREMENT OF DR. EDWARD 
HOLUB II 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an outstanding constituent 
from my district, Doctor Edward J. Holub II, 
M.D. Dr. Holub obtained his bachelor’s degree 
in Biology from Loyola College in 1973 and his 
doctorate from Georgetown University in 1977. 
He then did two years of Surgical residency at 
Georgetown University, then a year of resi-
dency in the newly founded Emergency Medi-
cine residency at Medical College of Pennsyl-
vania. After finishing residency, Dr. Holub 
began working in the Emergency Department 
at Germantown Hospital in Philadelphia. A 
year later, in 1981, he started working at St. 
Mary Medical Center in Langhorne, Pennsyl-
vania. Now after 41 continuous years as a 
dedicated Emergency Physician at St. Mary 
Medical Center, Dr. Holub is retiring. I am 
proud to recognize and celebrate Dr. Holub’s 
service to the citizens of Bucks County. Dr. 
Holub brought the first ‘‘Command Physician’’ 
course, now mandatory for all Emergency 
Physicians, to Bucks County. Dr. Holub has 
been a Command Physician for 41 years. He 
is widely respected in the Hazardous Materials 
(Hazmat) community and has been the Bucks 
County Hazmat Medical Command Physician 
since 2000. Dr. Holub is a Life Member of the 
American College of Forensic Examiner’s 
International and holds Board Certification in 
Homeland Security as a CHS III. He has been 
involved in local rescue squads as a physician 
advisor. Dr. Holub is also a Certified Wilder-
ness Medical Command Physician. Dr. Holub 
has also worked tirelessly during the COVID– 
19 pandemic. 
We are incredibly grateful for the positive 
impact Dr. Holub has had through his long ca-
reer of public service. We wish Dr. Holub 
countless blessings during his retirement. We 
thank Dr. Holub for a job well done.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
EDDIE DANIEL DIXON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize the life of Marshall County 
District 2 Supervisor Eddie Daniel Dixon. He 
was well-known throughout Marshall County 
for his integrity and steadfast commitment to 
public service. 
During his 40-year career with the Marshall 
County School District, Mr. Dixon wore many 
hats—from educator to school bus driver. He 
taught trade skills at H.W. Byers High School 
with high hopes for his students to find work 
and raise a family in Marshall County. Mr. Dix-
on’s strong desire to improve the quality of life 
for all residents led him to seek a seat on the 
Marshall County Board of Supervisors in 2000. 
His calm demeanor and thoughtful remarks 
earned him many supporters and a lengthy 
stay in office. Mr. Dixon served four and a half 
terms for the residents of District 2. 
The South Reporter, a newspaper in Holly 
Springs, published an article that included a 
quote from Marshall County Sheriff Kenny 
Dickerson. ‘‘Eddie’s been an icon to work with 
as 
far 
as 
county 
government,’’ 
Sheriff 
Dickerson said. ‘‘He was compassionate, yet 
firm when he needed to be. He loved H.W. 
Byers. He’s going to be missed.’’ 
Mr. Dixon, a lifetime believer in the impor-
tance of education, graduated from Alcorn 
State University. His accomplishments also in-
cluded serving as president and vice president 
of the Marshall County Board of Supervisors. 
He also served as president of the Mississippi 
Association of Supervisors. Mr. Dixon served 
as director of the board of the Northeast Mis-
sissippi Planning and Development District. He 
also played a central role in the development 
of the Marshall County Workforce Training 
Center. Mr. Dixon was a parishioner at St. Jo-
seph Catholic Church, a member of the 
Knights of Columbus, and a member of the 
Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity. 
Mr. Dixon is survived by his wife, Maxine 
Howard 
Dixon, 
and 
their 
four 
children: 
Brignetta Dickerson, Wanda Dixon-Beasley, 
Eddie Dixon, Jr., and Trevan Dixon. He is also 
survived by two brothers, Floyd Dixon and 
James Dixon. Survivors also include four 
grandchildren. 
Mr. Dixon was devoted to God, family, and 
to the citizens of Marshall County. His service 
will always be remembered.

HONORING CLAUDIA MAE TAYLOR 
DONALSON 
HON. SCOTT DesJARLAIS 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the memory of Claudia Mae 
Taylor Donalson. Claudia is the most recent 
honoree of the Women of Lincoln County 
Committee—a group that has joined together 
to recognize and honor influential women that 
have played such a significant role in the 
County’s history. 
Claudia was a lifelong Lincoln County resi-
dent born April 13, 1916. She was the only 
child to her proud parents Jessie and Mary 
Lacy Taylor. She was educated in Fayetteville 
public schools where she would later return as 
a teacher. Donalson attended Tennessee 
State University in Nashville for her under-
graduate degree and Alabama A&M University 
in Huntsville for her graduate studies. 
She was married in 1944 to a prominent 
Lincoln County community member, Dr. Latha 
Mitchell Donalson, known as L.M., who was a 
surgeon and hospital administrator. After Clau-
dia retired from teaching, she worked as a di-
etician for her husband who founded Donalson 
Hospital now known as Donalson Nursing 
Home. 
One of the greatest joys of her life was 
being an educator. She spent thirty years 
working to better the lives of children as a 
teacher in both the Fayetteville and Lincoln 
County school systems. 
Claudia was a woman of great faith. She 
was baptized as a child and became a lifetime 
member of the St. Paul A.M.E. Church in Fay-
etteville. She served her church in many ca-
pacities as Trustee, Vice President of the 
Women’s Missionary Society, the Layman’s 
Organization, and the Kitchen Committee. 
A woman with a true servant’s heart, she 
was incredibly active in making her community 
a better place. She was a member of the Ten-
nessee Retired Teachers Association, the 
NAACP, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., the Advi-
sory Board of First National Bank-Pulaski, the 
Fayetteville and Lincoln County Child Develop-
ment Center, Lincoln Medical Center Auxiliary, 
Lincoln County Historical Society, Hannah’s 
House, and the R.F. Boyd Auxiliary at Meharry 
Medical Hospital. She was also a Volunteer 
Hostess for the Fayetteville/Lincoln County 
Museum and Civic Center. 
In her free time, she enjoyed traveling with 
her husband abroad, gardening, reading, refin-
ishing furniture and mastering her needlework 
skills. She passed away on October 2, 2007. 
I hope that the Congress will join me in rec-
ognizing the life of Mrs. Donalson, and I con-
gratulate the efforts of the Women of Lincoln 
County Committee for their work in recog-
nizing and adding to the historical records of 
the women who have helped shaped the his-
tory of their county.

HONORING 
THE 
80TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BURCHELL NURS-
ERY 
HON. JOSH HARDER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the 80th anniversary 
of the Burchell Nursery. Located in Oakdale, 
California and perfectly nestled within our 
beautiful Central Valley, Burchell Nursery has 
been a pioneer in the industry and is now one 
of the leading fruit and nut tree nurseries in 
California. 
Founded in 1942 by Irvin Burchell, Burchell 
Nursery has, from the start, lived out Irvin’s vi-
sion: ‘‘To grow trees of the highest quality, sell 
trees with the highest integrity, and represent 
them honestly.’’ It is this core vision that has 
led Burchell Nursery to where it is today, as it 
has grown to more than 1,000 acres and has 
over 150,000 square feet of greenhouse 
space. Every year, this independent nursery 
provides more than three million fruit and nut 
trees 
to 
farmers 
across 
America. 
The 
nursery’s influence can also be felt across the 
globe, as it collaborates with nurseries in 
Chile, Australia, South Africa, and Europe. 
Like 
any 
fruitful 
endeavor, 
Burchell 
Nursery’s success is a direct result of the hard 
work and dedication of its staff and leadership. 
Today, following in the footsteps of his father 
and grandfather, Tom Burchell leads the nurs-
ery, serving as president of the company. 
Continuing the family tradition, Tom has made 
sure that Burchell Nursery remains innovative 
and ready for what comes next. This can be 
seen through the nursery’s development of nut 
trees designed to excel in our changing envi-
ronment. Mr. Burchell has also been focused 
on the future through his community involve-
ment, as Tom serves on advisory boards and 
is working to mentor the next generation 
through classroom, FFA, and 4–H programs. 
Over the last 80 years, Burchell Nursery has 
done more than just withstand changes in the 
industry. Rather, under the leadership of the 
Burchell family, the nursery has seen every 
challenge as an opportunity for innovation and 
has consistently met the moment. I am incred-
ibly proud to honor this remarkable achieve-
ment and wish the Burchell Nursery and 
Burchell family continued success.

RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF THE 
UTAH STATE LEGISLATURE ON 
CLIMATE AND ENERGY INITIA-
TIVES 
HON. JOHN R. CURTIS 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD the following Utah State Legisla-
ture Resolution: 
CONCURRENT RESOLUTION TO WORK TOGETHER 
TO ADDRESS THE CLIMATE, PUBLIC LANDS, 
AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION, 2022 GENERAL 
SESSION, STATE OF UTAH 
Chief Sponsor: Keven J. Stratton 
Senate Sponsor: David P. Hinkins 
LONG TITLE 
General Description: This resolution recog-
nizes and encourages best management prac-
tices to reduce carbon 12 emissions while 
also preserving and expanding forests and 
other lands to improve climate outcomes. 
Highlighted Provisions: This resolution: 
recognizes certain challenges and concerns 
with current land and forest management 
practices and how those practices conflict 
with goals to slow and reverse climate 
change; and encourages improved land man-
agement practices, including coordination 
with all relevant parties, to reverse trends of 
carbon emissions with new and evolving 
technology, expand natural carbon seques-
tration, and improve health, safety, and for-
est and ecosystem vitality. 
Be it resolved by the Legislature of the 
state of Utah, the Governor concurring 
therein: 
Whereas, in his January 27, 2021, Executive 
Order, President Biden stated that ‘‘the 
United States and the world face a profound 
climate crisis’’ and to deal with it he pledged 
‘‘to implement a government-wide approach 
that reduces climate pollution in every sec-
tor of the H.C.R. 1 economy, increases resil-
ience to the impacts of climate change, pro-
tects public health, and conserves our lands, 
waters, and biodiversity’’; 
Whereas, at the recent United Nations COP 
26 climate meeting in Glasgow, Scotland, 
President Biden announced ‘‘a new plan to 
conserve global forests, halt forest loss, re-
store critical carbon sinks, and improve land 
management,’’ and committed the United 
States to an international declaration to re-
verse global deforestation by protecting for-
ests and mitigating wildfire damage and re-
storing degraded land by 2030; 
Whereas, many people are concerned that 
rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and 
green house gases (GHGs) resulting from the 
continued use of fossil fuels are causing cli-
mate changes that threaten human health 
and wellbeing through more frequent ex-
treme weather events, damage to critical 
ecosystems, threats to food supplies, and 
other harms; 
Whereas, the primary approaches to slow 
or reduce the levels of CO2 and other GHGs 
being pursued by climate policy advocates 
would rapidly replace the current ‘‘all-of- 
the-above’’ energy mix with an increasingly 
heavy reliance on renewable sources; 
Whereas, there is wide concern over some 
of these proposed climate policies, including 
that the policies would increase energy 
costs, damage the economic competitiveness 
of the United States, and undermine na-
tional security; 
Whereas, the national debate over climate 
change policy is becoming increasingly heat-
ed and divisive; 
Whereas, in contrast, the state of Utah has 
adopted an ‘‘all-of-the-above’’ energy ap-
proach policy and goals as Utah’s strategy to 
ensure that energy is affordable and reliable; 
Whereas, in such a policy environment, the 
wisest course is to emphasize first adopting 
the most efficacious elements of the various 
proposed responses to climate change on 
which there is wide agreement; 
Whereas, national and international poli-
cies, agreements and reports, including spe-
cific mention in the Paris Accords, multiple 
reports by the United Nations Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change, the inter-
national ‘‘4 per 1,000 Initiative’’ and Presi-
dent Biden’s proposed climate policy, among 
others, all recognize the importance of nat-
ural systems in removing and sequestering 
GHGs and call for these natural sinks to be 
protected and expanded where possible; 
Whereas, forests and rangelands, including 
those managed by the federal government in 
Utah and nationally, can either be sinks for 
atmospheric carbon or emitters of CO2 and 
other GHGs, largely depending on how they 
are managed; 
Whereas, for a number of reasons, feder-
ally-managed land in Utah and nationally 64 
that had been functioning as carbon sinks 
are increasingly becoming emitters of CO2 
and other GHGs; 
Whereas, the same conditions that convert 
carbon sinks into GHG emitters, such as 
wildland fire and soil erosion, also create a 
wide range of economic, health, social, and 
environmental problems; 
Whereas, a growing body of scientific re-
search, 
practical 
application, 
and 
dem-
onstrated results on tens of millions of acres 
in the United States and around the world 
prove that in many cases degraded natural 
systems can be restored as vitally important 
carbon sinks and that the sequestration po-
tential of existing sinks can be vastly in-
creased by applying proven land manage-
ment practices; 
Whereas, while the importance of natural 
systems functioning as sinks for GHGs is 
widely accepted, their true potential is often 
not recognized; 
Whereas, some scientists have calculated 
that globally applying these widely dem-
onstrated and proven best management prac-
tices to forests, rangelands, and agricultural 
lands could sequester all of the CO2 produced 
by human activities from the beginning of 
the Industrial Revolution and continue to se-
quester enough to achieve not just net zero 
emissions but net negative emissions for dec-
ades to come; 
Whereas, this research and practical expe-
rience have also shown that these same ad-
vanced and proven sequestration and man-
agement 
techniques 
also 
simultaneously 
produce a cascade of valuable and significant 
environmental and economic co-benefits, in-
cluding greater overall ecosystem integrity 
and productivity, increased biodiversity, im-
proved water quantity and quality, better 
fish and wildlife habitat, greater drought re-
silience, reduced flooding risk, H.C.R. 1 more 
and better forage for wildlife and livestock, 
sustainable timber, and enhanced recreation 
opportunities, among others; 
Whereas, these associated co-benefits are 
so valuable and cost effective in their own 
right that tens of millions of acres in the 
United States and around the world are 
being managed solely to generate them and 
not to achieve any climate-related goals; 
Whereas, at a minimum, responsible land 
stewardship requires employing the best pos-
sible practices to protect, and enhance where 
possible, the land and resources over which 
the steward has responsibility; 
Whereas, because some previous carbon 
sinks may not be repairable for decades or 
even centuries, if at all, prudent stewardship 
dictates putting primary emphasis on pro-
tecting them from degradation to the max-
imum possible extent; 
Whereas, for a number of reasons, the fed-
eral government has not met this minimal 
standard of stewardship in its management 
of much of the public lands and resources in 
Utah and across the country; 
Whereas, by failing in this stewardship re-
sponsibility, the federal government has 
caused a wide range of environmental and 
economic harm while at the same time also 
converting what had previously been effec-
tive carbon sinks into emitters of CO2 and 
other GHGs; 
Whereas, protecting and enhancing natural 
carbon sinks is clearly a non-controversial 
win-win solution in the climate change de-
bate because it addresses the concerns about 
rising GHG levels while at the same time 
largely alleviating the concerns of those re-
sistant to many of the other approaches 
being considered to achieve this goal; Where-
as, in addition to helping control the rise in 
GHG emissions, the many co-benefits gen-
erated by adopting this win-win approach in-

change and better allows for adaptation and 
mitigation; 
Whereas, because of these many recognized 
co-benefits that carbon sinks generate, fos-
tering them should bring an important meas-
ure of unity among all parties in the climate 
policy debate since all can agree on the 
value of this approach; 
Whereas, research is revealing significant 
human health impacts from exposure to 
wildfire smoke and small particulate matter, 
including respiratory and heart issues and an 
increase in premature births, among others; 
Whereas, the Salt Lake City metropolitan 
area has had a number of days in 2021 with 
the worst or close to the worst air quality of 
any metropolitan area in the world, and 
studies have found that wildland fire smoke 
contributes close to half of the concentra-
tion of these pollutant levels in western 
states; and 
Whereas, efforts to protect and enhance 
natural carbon sinks are easily and rapidly 
scalable in Utah and nationally and would 
provide numerous and immediate benefits: 
Now, Therefore, be it resolved that the Leg-
islature of the state of Utah, the Governor 
concurring therein, challenges the Biden Ad-
ministration and Congress to make meeting 
the federal government’s stewardship respon-
sibility in managing the federal public lands 
their highest priority in implementing any 
climate policy, thereby protecting and en-
hancing natural carbon sinks and, further, 
that they undertake this effort while recog-
nizing Utah’s state sovereignty and their 
statutory mandates under the Federal Land 
Policy and Management Act and the Na-
tional Forest Management Act to fully co-
ordinate and integrate these activities with 
the relevant land management and resource 
management plans of the state of Utah, Na-
tive American tribes, and local governments. 
Be it further resolved the Legislature and 
the Governor find that the standard of re-
sponsible federal land and resources steward-
ship should be to achieve on federally-man-
aged public lands the highest level of soil 
and ecosystem health and productivity that 
is being achieved on comparable land by 
tribal, state, local, and private managers or 
make a public report on why the agency is 
unable to restore this level of ecosystem 
health and productivity. 
Be it further resolved that the Legislature 
and the Governor recognize that while in-
creased funding and attention is being pro-
posed, also challenge the Biden Administra-
tion and Congress to urgently initiate and 
fund emergency efforts to expand forest and 
rangeland fuel reduction and other fire pre- 
suppression activities to the maximum acre-
age H.C.R. 1 of federal land as quickly as pos-
sible to prevent the harm and damage now 
being caused on millions of acres annually. 
Be it further resolved that the Legislature 
and the Governor declare that until adequate 
funding is provided for such an emergency ef-
fort to protect and enhance natural sinks on 
federally-managed land, no funding for such 
purposes should be provided for similar ac-
tivities in other countries unless the federal 
government first provides a detailed analysis 
justifying spending those funds abroad in-
stead of spending them to further improve 
the health and fire resistance of forests and 
rangelands in this country. 
Be it further resolved that the Legislature 
and the Governor find that the federal gov-
ernment should apply a social benefits of 
carbon control cost-benefits funding test to 
identify and compare the co-benefits of pro-
tecting, rehabilitating, and expanding car-
bon sinks in natural systems on federally- 
managed land as a mechanism to control 
GHGs with the co-benefits that might be 
generated with any other alternative ap-
proach and make those calculations avail-
able to the public. 
Be it further resolved that the Legislature 
and the Governor urge Congress to request 
that the U.S. Government Accountability Of-
fice analyze the potential capabilities of fed-
eral land management agencies to protect, 
enhance, and expand carbon sinks on feder-
ally-managed land in response to a max-
imum effort directive and estimate the an-
nual costs of doing so, and, further, request, 
and provide funding if necessary, for several 
appropriate professional organizations such 
as the National Association of State For-
esters and the Society for Range Manage-
ment to undertake a similar analysis and in-
clude any recommendations for changes in 
federal policy, adoption of new management 
techniques, and any other suggestions that 
would improve the effectiveness and effi-
ciency of such a maximum effort. 
Be it further resolved that the Legislature 
and the Governor urge all state agencies 
with authority to manage state-managed 
public lands to continue to manage them in 
ways that increase soil carbon sequestration 
and to the extent they can, to encourage 
greater soil carbon sequestration on private 
lands. 
Be it further resolved that a copy of this res-
olution be sent to the President of the 
United States, the Majority Leader of the 
United States Senate, the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives, the 
United States Secretary of the Interior, the 
United States Secretary of Agriculture, the 
United States Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, the United States Sec-
retary of Housing and Urban Development, 
the United States Secretary of Commerce, 
the United States Secretary of Energy, the 
United States Secretary of Transportation, 
the United States Environmental Protection 
Agency, the leader of each legislative house 
in each of the other states, and the members 
of Utah’s congressional delegation.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO CHARLES 
‘‘SANDY’’ WENTZELL 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 7, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I had the pleasure of attending Charles 
‘‘Sandy’’ Wentzell’s 100th birthday celebration. 
Sandy is the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 
253’s oldest surviving World War II and Ko-
rean war veteran. In the Army Air Corps, he 
served as a technical sergeant and flew 34 
missions over Berlin in a B–17 Superfortress 
during World War II. Then, Sandy joined the 
newly formed U.S. Air Force as a ground air 
controller with South Korean forces. During 
this time, he was captured and taken prisoner. 
However, Sandy bravely escaped captivity in 
the middle of the night during freezing cold 
temperatures. It is truly remarkable that he 
was able to flee, and it was such an honor to 
be able to meet him. 
Sandy should be so proud of his bravery 
and successful escape, and I want to thank 
him for his heroic service to our country. God 
Bless Sandy, and God Bless our United 
States of America.
