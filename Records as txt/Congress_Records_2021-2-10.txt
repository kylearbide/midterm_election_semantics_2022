ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, for 
the information of all Senators, no mo-
tions were filed this morning. So we 
will proceed to the House managers’ 
presentation. We anticipate two 10- 
minute breaks and a 45-minute dinner 
break around 6 p.m. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pur-
suant to the provisions of S. Res. 47, 
the managers for the House of Rep-
resentatives have 16 hours to make a 
presentation of their case. 
The Senate will now hear you. We 
recognize Mr. Manager RASKIN to begin 
the presentation of the case for the 
House of Representatives. 
Mr. RASKIN. 
MANAGERS’ PRESENTATION 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you 
very much, Mr. President. 
Members of the Senate, good morn-
ing, good day. 
Some people think this trial is a con-
test of lawyers or, even worse, a com-
petition between political parties. It is 
neither. It is a moment of truth for 
America. 
My late father, Marcus Raskin, once 
wrote: 
Democracy [needs] a ground to stand upon. 
And that ground is the truth. 
America needs the truth about ex- 
President Trump’s role in inciting the 
insurrection on January 6 because it 
threatened our government, and it dis-
rupted—it 
easily 
could 
have 
de-
stroyed—the peaceful transfer of power 
in the United States for the first time 
in 233 years. 
It was suggested yesterday by Presi-
dent Trump’s counsel that this is real-
ly like a very bad accident or a natural 
disaster, where lots of people get in-
jured or killed, and society is just out 
looking for someone to blame. And 
that is a natural and normal human re-
action, according to the President’s 
counsel, but he says it is totally unfair 
in this case. 
President Trump, according to Mr. 
Castor, is essentially an innocent by-
stander who got swept up in this catas-
trophe but did nothing wrong. In this 
assertion, Mr. Castor unerringly echoes 
his client, ex-President Trump, who de-
clared after the insurrection that his 
conduct in the affair was ‘‘totally ap-
propriate,’’ and, therefore, we can only 
assume he could do and would do the 
exact same thing again because he said 
his conduct was totally appropriate. 
So now the factual inquiry of the 
trial is squarely posed for us. The juris-
dictional constitutional issue is gone. 
Whether you were persuaded by the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S616 
February 10, 2021 
President’s constitutional analysis yes-
terday or not, the Senate voted to re-
ject it. And so the Senate is now prop-
erly exercising its jurisdiction and sit-
ting as a Court of Impeachment con-
ducting a trial on the facts. We are 
having a trial on the facts. 
The House says ex-President Donald 
Trump incited a violent insurrection 
against Congress and the Constitution 
and the people. The President’s lawyers 
and the President say his conduct was 
totally appropriate and he is essen-
tially 
an 
innocent 
victim 
of 
cir-
cumstances, like the other innocent 
victims that we will see getting caught 
up in all of the violence and chaos, over 
the next several days. 
The evidence will be for you to see 
and hear and digest. The evidence will 
show you that ex-President Trump was 
no innocent bystander. The evidence 
will show that he clearly incited the 
January 6 insurrection. It will show 
that Donald Trump surrendered his 
role as Commander in Chief and be-
came the ‘‘inciter in chief’’ of a dan-
gerous insurrection, and this was, as 
one of our colleagues put it so cogently 
on January 6 itself, ‘‘the greatest be-
trayal of the presidential oath in the 
history of the United States.’’ 
The evidence will show you that he 
saw it coming and was not remotely 
surprised by the violence. And when 
the violence inexorably and inevitably 
came as predicted and overran this 
body and the House of Representatives 
with chaos, we will show you that he 
completely abdicated his duty as Com-
mander in Chief to stop the violence 
and protect the government and pro-
tect our officers and protect our peo-
ple. 
He violated his oath of office to pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitu-
tion, the government, and the people of 
the United States. 
The evidence will show you that he 
assembled, inflamed, and incited his 
followers to descend upon the Capitol 
to ‘‘Stop the Steal,’’ to block Vice 
President Pence and Congress from fi-
nalizing his opponent’s election victory 
over him. 
It will show that he had been warned 
that these followers were prepared for 
a violent attack, targeting us at the 
Capitol through media reports, law en-
forcement reports, and even arrests. 
In short, we will prove that the im-
peached President was no innocent by-
stander whose conduct was totally ap-
propriate and should be a standard for 
future Presidents, but that he incited 
this attack, and he saw it coming. 
To us, it may have felt like chaos and 
madness, but there was method in the 
madness that day. This was an orga-
nized attack on the counting of the 
electoral college votes in joint session 
of the U.S. Congress under the Twelfth 
Amendment and under the Electoral 
Count Act to prevent Vice President 
Mike Pence and to prevent us from 
counting sufficient electoral college 
votes to certify Joe Biden’s victory of 
306 to 232 in the electoral college—a 
margin that President Trump had de-
clared a landslide in 2016. 
When 
my 
colleague 
Mr. 
NEGUSE 
speaks after me, he will set forth in de-
tail the exact roadmap of all the evi-
dence in the case. My fellow House 
managers and I will then take you 
through that evidence step-by-step so 
everyone can see exactly how these 
events unfolded. 
But I want to tell you a few key rea-
sons right now that we know this case 
is not about blaming an innocent by-
stander for the horrific violence and 
harm that took place on January 6. 
This is about holding accountable the 
person singularly responsible for incit-
ing the attack. 
Let’s start with December 12. You 
will see during this trial a man who 
praised and encouraged and cultivated 
violence. ‘‘We have just begun to 
fight!’’ he says more than a month 
after the election has taken place, and 
that is before the second Million 
MAGA March, a rally that ended in se-
rious violence and even a burning of a 
church. And as the President fore-
casted, it was only the beginning. 
On December 19, 18 days before Janu-
ary 6, he told his base about where the 
battle would be that they would fight 
next. January 6 would be ‘‘wild,’’ he 
promised. ‘‘Be there, will be wild!’’ said 
the President of the United States of 
America. And that, too, turned out to 
be true. 
You will see in the days that fol-
lowed, Donald Trump continued to ag-
gressively promote January 6 to his 
followers. The event was scheduled at 
the precise time that Congress would 
be meeting in joint session to count 
the electoral college votes and to final-
ize the 2020 Presidential election. 
In fact, in the days leading up to the 
attack, you will learn that there were 
countless social media posts, news sto-
ries, and, most importantly, credible 
reports from the FBI and Capitol Po-
lice that the thousands gathering for 
the President’s Save America March 
were violent, organized with weapons, 
and were targeting the Capitol. This 
mob got organized so openly because, 
as they would later scream in these 
halls and as they posted on forums be-
fore the attack, they were sent here by 
the President. They were invited here 
by the President of the United States 
of America. 
And when they showed up, knowing 
of these reports that the crowd was 
angry and they were armed, here is 
what Donald Trump told them. Presi-
dent Trump whipped the crowd into a 
frenzy, exhorting followers: 
If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not 
going to have a country anymore. 
And then he aimed straight at the 
Capitol declaring: 
You’ll never take back our country with 
weakness. You have to show strength, and 
you have to be strong. 
He told them to ‘‘fight like hell,’’ and 
they brought us hell on that day. 
Incited by President Trump, his mob 
attacked the Capitol. This assault un-
folded live on television before a horri-
fied nation. 
According to those around him at the 
time, this is how President Trump re-
portedly responded to the attack that 
we saw him incite in public: Delight, 
enthusiasm, confusion as to why others 
around him weren’t as happy as he was. 
Trump incited the January 6 attack, 
and when his mob overran and occupied 
the Senate and attacked the House and 
assaulted law enforcement, he watched 
it on TV like a reality show. He reveled 
in it, and he did nothing to help us as 
Commander in Chief. Instead, he served 
as the ‘‘inciter in chief,’’ sending 
tweets that only further incited the 
rampaging mob. He made statements 
lauding and sympathizing with the in-
surrectionists. 
At 4:17 p.m.—over 3 hours after the 
beginning of the siege—for the very 
first time, he spoke out loud—not on 
Twitter. He spoke out loud to the 
American people. Here is what he said: 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6- 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. I know your pain. I 
know you’re hurt. 
So you might be saying: All right, 
the President is going to console us 
now. He is going to reassure America. 
He knows our pain. He knows we are 
hurt. We have just seen these horrific 
images of officers being impaled and 
smashed over the head. We have just 
been under attack for 3 hours. But here 
is what he actually goes on to say: 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6- 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. I know your pain. I 
know you’re hurt. We had an election that 
was stolen from us. It was a landslide elec-
tion, and everyone knows it, especially the 
other side. 
So you would think he is about to 
decry the mayhem and violence, the 
unprecedented spectacle of this mob 
attack on the U.S. Capitol, but he is 
still promoting the big lie that was re-
sponsible for inflaming and inciting 
the mob in the first place. 
If anyone ever had a doubt as to his 
focus that day, it was not to defend us; 
it was not to console us. It was to 
praise and sympathize and commis-
erate with the rampaging mob. It was 
to continue to act as ‘‘inciter in chief,’’ 
not Commander in Chief, by telling the 
mob that their election had been stolen 
from them. 
Even then, after that vicious attack, 
he continued to spread the big lie. And 
as everyone here knows, Joe Biden won 
by more than 7 million votes and 306 to 
232 in the electoral college. But Donald 
Trump refused to accept his loss even 
after this attack, and he celebrated the 
people who violently interfered with 
the peaceful transfer of power, for the 
first time in American history, and did 
that at his urging. 
And when he did, in this video, fi-
nally tell them to go home in peace, he 
added this message: 
We love you. You’re very special.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S617 
February 10, 2021 
Distinguished Members of the Sen-
ate, this is a day that will live in dis-
grace in American history; that is, un-
less you ask Donald Trump because 
this is what he tweeted before he went 
to bed that night at 6:01 p.m.—not con-
soling the Nation, not reassuring ev-
eryone that the government was se-
cure, not a single word that entire day 
condemning the violent insurrection. 
This is what he says: 
These are the things and events that hap-
pen when a sacred landslide election victory 
is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped 
away from great patriots who have been 
badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go 
home with love & in peace. Remember this 
day forever! 
‘‘These are the things and events 
that happen when a sacred landslide 
election victory is so unceremoniously 
& viciously stripped away from great 
patriots. . . . ’’ In other words, this was 
all perfectly natural and foreseeable to 
Donald Trump. At the beginning of the 
day, he told you it was coming. At the 
end of the day, he basically says: I told 
you this would happen. And then he 
adds: ‘‘Remember this day forever!’’ 
But not as a day of disgrace, a day of 
horror and trauma, as the rest of us re-
member it, but as a day of celebration, 
a day of commemoration. 
And if we let it be, it will be a day of 
continuation, a call to action, and a 
rallying cry for the next rounds of in-
surrectionary justice because all of 
this was totally appropriate. 
Senators, the stakes of this trial 
could not be more serious. Every Amer-
ican—young and old and in between—is 
invited to participate with us in this 
essential journey to find the facts and 
share the truth. Trials are public 
events in a democracy, and no trial is 
more public or significant than an im-
peachment trial. 
Because the insurrection brought 
shocking violence, bloodshed, and pain 
to the Nation’s Capitol, and we will be 
showing relevant clips of the mob’s at-
tack on police officers and other inno-
cent people, we do urge parents and 
teachers to exercise close review of 
what young people are watching here, 
and please watch along with them if 
you are allowing them to watch. 
The impeachment managers will try 
to give warnings before the most 
graphic and disturbing violence that 
took place is shown. 
We believe that the managers’ com-
prehensive 
and 
meticulous 
presen-
tation will lead to one powerful and ir-
resistible conclusion: Donald Trump 
committed a massive crime against our 
Constitution and our people and the 
worst violation of the Presidential 
oath of office in the history of the 
United States of America. For this, he 
was impeached by the House of Rep-
resentatives, and he must be convicted 
by the United States Senate. 
Before I close, I want to address a 
constitutional 
issue 
still 
lingering 
from yesterday’s argument. The Presi-
dent, obviously, is still exploring ways 
to change the subject and talk about 
anything other than his responsibility 
for inciting the attack. 
We heard a lot yesterday about his 
claim that this incitement of the insur-
rection was perfectly appropriate be-
cause it is somehow protected by the 
First Amendment, and this little diver-
sion caught my eye because I have been 
a professor of constitutional law and 
the First Amendment for decades. 
And as we will demonstrate over the 
course of the trial, the factual premise 
and the legal underpinnings of that 
claim are all wrong. They present 
President Trump as merely like a guy 
at a rally expressing a political opinion 
that we disagree with, and now we are 
trying to put him in jail for it. That 
has nothing to do with the reality of 
these charges or his constitutional of-
fense. 
The 
particular 
political 
opinions 
being expressed are not why we im-
peached the President and have noth-
ing to do with it. It makes no dif-
ference what the ideological content of 
the mob was, and if we license and for-
give incitement to violent insurrection 
by militant Trump followers this week, 
you can be sure there will be a whole 
bunch of new ideological flavors com-
ing soon. 
As we will demonstrate with over-
whelming evidence, portraying Trump 
as a guy on the street being punished 
for his ideas is a false description of his 
actions, his intent, and the role that he 
played on January 6, when he willfully 
incited an insurrectionary mob to riot 
at the Capitol. 
Last week, 144 constitutional schol-
ars, including Floyd Abrams, a fero-
cious defender of free speech; Charles 
Fried, President Reagan’s Solicitor 
General; Steven Calabresi, the co-
founder of the Federalist Society, re-
leased a statement calling the Presi-
dent’s First Amendment arguments 
‘‘legally 
frivolous’’—‘‘legally 
frivo-
lous’’—adding: 
[W]e all agree that the First Amendment 
does not prevent the Senate from convicting 
President Trump and disqualifying him from 
holding future office. 
They went on to say: 
No reasonable scholar or jurist could con-
clude that President Trump had a First 
Amendment right to incite a violent attack 
on the seat of the legislative branch, or then 
to sit back and watch on television as Con-
gress was terrorized and the Capitol sacked. 
Incitement to violence is, of course, 
not protected by the First Amendment. 
That is why most Americans have dis-
missed Donald Trump’s First Amend-
ment rhetoric simply by referring to 
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’s handy 
phrase: You can’t shout ‘‘fire’’ in a 
crowded theater. 
But even that time-honored principle 
doesn’t begin to capture how off-base 
the argument is. This case is much 
worse than someone who falsely shouts 
‘‘fire’’ in a crowded theater. It is more 
like a case where the town fire chief, 
who is paid to put out fires, sends a 
mob not to yell ‘‘fire’’ in a crowded 
theater but to actually set the theater 
on fire; and who then, when the fire 
alarms go off and the calls start flood-
ing in to the fire department asking for 
help, does nothing but sit back, encour-
age the mob to continue its rampage, 
and watch the fire spread on TV, with 
glee and delight. 
So then we say this fire chief should 
never be allowed to hold this public job 
again and ‘‘you are fired, and you are 
permanently disqualified’’—and he ob-
jects. And he says we are violating his 
free speech rights just because he is 
pro-mob or pro-fire or whatever it 
might be. 
Come on. I mean, you really don’t 
need to go to law school to figure out 
what is wrong with that argument. 
Here is the key. Undoubtedly, a private 
person can run around on the street ex-
pressing his or her support for the en-
emies of the United States and advo-
cating to overthrow the United States 
Government. 
You have got a right to do that under 
the First Amendment, but if the Presi-
dent spent all of his days doing that, 
uttering the exact same words, express-
ing support for the enemies of the 
United States and for overthrowing the 
government, is there anyone here who 
doubts that this would be a violation of 
his oath of office to preserve, protect, 
and defend the Constitution of the 
United States and that he or she could 
be impeached for doing that? 
Look, if you are President of the 
United States, you have chosen a side 
with your oath of office, and if you 
break it, we can impeach, convict, re-
move, and disqualify you permanently 
from holding any office of honor, trust, 
or profit under the United States. 
As Justice Scalia once said, memo-
rably, ‘‘You can’t ride with the cops 
and root for the robbers.’’ And if you 
become ‘‘inciter in chief’’ to the insur-
rection, you can’t expect to be on the 
payroll as Commander in Chief for the 
Union. 
Trump was the President of the 
United States, and he had sworn to pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitu-
tion. He had an affirmative, binding 
duty, one that set him apart from ev-
eryone else in the country, to take care 
that the laws be faithfully executed, 
including all the laws against assault-
ing Federal officers, destroying Federal 
property, violently threatening Mem-
bers of Congress and the Vice Presi-
dent, interfering with Federal elec-
tions, and dozens of other Federal laws 
that are well known to all of you. 
When he incited insurrection on Jan-
uary 6, he broke that oath. He violated 
that duty. And that is why we are here 
today, and that is why he has no cred-
ible constitutional defense. 
I will tell you a final, sad story in 
this kaleidoscope of sadness and terror 
and violence. One of our Capitol offi-
cers who defended us that day was a 
longtime veteran of our force, a brave 
and honorable public servant who spent 
several hours battling the mob as part 
of one of those blue lines defending the 
Capitol and our democracy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S618 
February 10, 2021 
For several hours straight, as the 
marauders punched and kicked and 
mauled and spit upon and hit officers 
with baseball bats and fire extin-
guishers, cursed the cops and stormed 
our Capitol, he defended us, and he 
lived every minute of his oath of office. 
And afterward, overwhelmed by emo-
tion, he broke down in the Rotunda and 
he cried for 15 minutes and he shouted 
out: 
I got called an n-word 15 times today. 
And then he reported: 
I sat down with one of my buddies, another 
Black guy, and tears just started streaming 
down my face. [And] I said, ‘‘What the [F], 
man? Is this America?’’ 
That is the question before all of you 
in this trial: Is this America? Can our 
country and our democracy ever be the 
same if we don’t hold accountable the 
person responsible for inciting the vio-
lent attack against our country, our 
Capitol, and our democracy and all of 
those who serve us so faithfully and 
honorably? Is this America? 
Mr. NEGUSE will now provide a road-
map, a roadmap of our evidentiary 
case. 
Mr. Manager NEGUSE. Mr. Presi-
dent, distinguished Senators, counsel, 
like several of you, I am a child of im-
migrants. And as a son of immigrants, 
I believe firmly in my heart that the 
United States is the greatest Republic 
that this world has ever known. 
A hallmark of our Republic since the 
days of George Washington has been 
the peaceful transfer of power. For cen-
turies, we have accepted it as fact. 
Unfortunately, sadly, we know now 
that we can no longer take that for 
granted because, as Lead Manager 
RASKIN explained, on January 6, the 
peaceful transition of power was vio-
lently interrupted when a mob stormed 
this Capitol and desecrated this Cham-
ber. 
As you will see during the course of 
this trial, that mob was summoned, as-
sembled, and incited by the former 
President of the United States, Donald 
Trump, and he did that because he 
wanted to stop the transfer of power so 
that he could retain power, even 
though he had lost the election. And 
when the violence erupted, when they 
were here in our building, with weap-
ons, he did nothing to stop it. 
If we are to protect our Republic and 
prevent something like this from ever 
happening again, he must be convicted. 
Now, I want to be very clear about 
what we will show you during the 
course of this trial. As my fellow man-
agers present our case to you today, to-
night, and tomorrow, it will be helpful 
to think about President Trump’s in-
citement of insurrection in three dis-
tinct parts: provocation, the attack, 
and the harm. 
Let’s start with the provocation. We 
will show, during the course of this 
trial, that this attack was provoked by 
the President, incited by the President, 
and, as a result, it was predictable, and 
it was foreseeable. And, of course, that 
makes sense. 
This mob was well orchestrated. 
Their conduct was intentional. They 
did it all in plain sight—proudly, open-
ly, and loudly—because they believed, 
they truly believed that they were 
doing this for him; that this was their 
patriotic duty. 
They even predicted that he would 
protect them. And for the most part, 
they were right. In his unique role as 
Commander in Chief of our country and 
as the one person whom the mob was 
listening to and following orders from, 
he had the power to stop it, and he 
didn’t. 
Now, some have said that President 
Trump’s remarks, his speech on Janu-
ary 6, was just a speech. Well, let me 
ask you this: When in our history has 
a speech led thousands of people to 
storm our Nation’s Capitol with weap-
ons, to scale the walls, break windows, 
kill a Capitol Police officer? 
This was not just a speech. It didn’t 
just happen. And as you evaluate the 
facts that we present to you, it will be-
come clear exactly where that mob 
came from, because here is the thing: 
President Trump’s words, as you will 
see, on January 6 in that speech, just 
like the mob’s actions, were carefully 
chosen. Those words had a very specific 
meaning to that crowd. And how do we 
know this? Because in the weeks prior 
to, during, and after the election, he 
used the same words over and over and 
over again. You will hear over and over 
three things—you can see them on the 
screens—first, 
what 
Lead 
Manager 
RASKIN referred to as the ‘‘big lie,’’ 
that the ‘‘election was stolen, full of 
fraud, rigged.’’ You will hear over and 
over him using that lie to urge his sup-
porters to ‘‘never concede’’ and ‘‘stop 
the steal.’’ Finally, you will hear the 
call to arms, that it was his supporters’ 
patriotic duty to fight like hell. To do 
what? To stop the steal. To stop the 
election from being stolen by showing 
up in this very Chamber. To stop you. 
To stop us. 
I respectfully ask that you remember 
those three phrases as you consider the 
evidence today—‘‘The election was sto-
len,’’ ‘‘Stop the Steal,’’ and ‘‘Fight like 
hell’’—because they did not just appear 
on January 6. Let me show you what I 
mean. Let’s start with the ‘‘big lie.’’ 
You will see during this trial that 
the President realized, really by last 
spring, that he could lose, he might 
lose the election. So what did he do? He 
started planting the seeds to get some 
of his supporters ready by saying that 
he could only lose the election if it was 
stolen. 
In other words, really what he did 
was create a no-lose scenario: either he 
won the election or he would have 
some angry supporters—not all but 
some—who believed that if he lost, the 
election had to be rigged, and they 
would be angry because he was telling 
Americans that their vote had been 
stolen. And in America, our vote is our 
voice. So his false claims about elec-
tion fraud, that was the drumbeat 
being used to inspire, instigate, and ig-
nite them, to anger them. 
Watch this clip. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
President TRUMP. Because we are not 
going to let this election be taken away from 
us. That’s the only way they are going to 
win this. We are not going to let it happen. 
(Applause.) 
It is the only way we can be—it is the only 
way we can lose, in my opinion, is massive 
fraud. 
We all know what happened after 
that. He lost. He lost the election. But 
remember, he had that no-lose scenario 
that I referenced earlier. He told his 
base that the election was stolen, as he 
had forecasted, and then he told them: 
Your election has been stolen, but you 
cannot concede. You must stop the 
steal. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
President TRUMP: You can’t let another 
person steal that election from you. All over 
the country, people are together in holding 
up signs: ‘Stop the Steal.’ 
The Democrats are trying to steal the 
White House. You cannot let them. You just 
can’t let them. 
Now, while he is inciting his sup-
porters, he is also simultaneously 
doing everything he possibly can to 
overturn the election. 
First, he begins with the courts—a 
legitimate avenue, legitimate avenue— 
to challenge the election, but he ig-
nores all of their adverse rulings when 
all of his claims are thrown out. 
Then he moves on to try to pressure 
State election officials to block the 
election results for his opponent even 
though he had lost in their States. You 
will hear my fellow managers discuss 
that in detail. 
Then he tries to threaten State elec-
tion officials to actually change the 
votes to make him the winner, even 
threatening criminal penalties if they 
refused. 
He had the Justice Department in-
vestigate his claims, and even they 
found no support for those claims. So 
he tried to persuade some Members of 
his party in Congress to block the cer-
tification of his vote with attacks in 
public forums. 
When that failed, he tried to intimi-
date the Vice President of the United 
States of America to refuse to certify 
the vote and send it back to the States. 
None of it worked. So what does he 
do, with his back against the wall, 
when all else has failed? He turned 
back to his supporters. He had already 
spent months telling them that the 
election was stolen, and he amplified it 
further. He turned it up a notch. He 
told them that they had to be ready 
not just to stop the steal but to fight 
like hell. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
President TRUMP. We are going to fight 
for the survival of our nation. And we are 
going to keep on fighting. 
We will never surrender, we will only win. 
Now is not the time to retreat. Now is the 
time to fight harder than ever before. 
We have to go all the way. We are going to 
fight like hell, I will tell you right now. 
We will not bend, we will not break, we 
will not yield. We will never give in. We will 
never give up. We will never back down. We 
will never, ever surrender.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S619 
February 10, 2021 
You will see that in the months the 
President made these statements, peo-
ple listened. Armed supporters sur-
rounded election officials’ homes. The 
secretary of state for Georgia got death 
threats. Officials warned the President 
that his rhetoric was dangerous, and it 
was going to result in deadly violence. 
And that is what makes this so dif-
ferent, because when he saw firsthand 
the violence that his conduct was cre-
ating, he didn’t stop it. He didn’t con-
demn the violence. He incited it fur-
ther, and he got more specific. He 
didn’t just tell them to fight like hell; 
he told them how, where, and when. He 
made sure they had advance notice, 18 
days’ advance notice. He sent this 
‘‘save the date’’ for January 6. He told 
them to march to the Capitol and fight 
like hell on January 6, as Lead Man-
ager RASKIN said, the exact same day 
we were certifying the election results. 
What time was that rally scheduled 
for? The exact same time that this 
Chamber was certifying the election 
results in joint session. When did he 
conclude his speech? Literally mo-
ments before Speaker PELOSI had gav-
eled us into session. 
Many of us were in the House during 
that joint session of Congress. I was 
sitting two rows behind Leader SCHU-
MER and Leader MCCONNELL. I remem-
ber it vividly. And as we were standing 
there fulfilling our solemn oath to the 
Constitution, the President was fin-
ishing his speech just a couple of miles 
away. How did he conclude that infa-
mous speech? With a final call to ac-
tion. He told them to march down 
Pennsylvania Avenue, to come here; 
that it was their patriotic duty because 
the election had been stolen. And when 
they heard his speech, they understood 
his words and what they meant because 
they had heard it before. 
Let’s take just a minute and really 
look at his words on January 6 as he 
spoke at the Save America rally. Re-
member, I told you you would hear 
three phrases: ‘‘The election was sto-
len,’’ ‘‘Stop the Steal,’’ and ‘‘Fight like 
hell.’’ 
Let’s 
start 
with 
that 
first 
phrase. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. All of us here today do 
not want to see our election victory stolen. 
There has never been anything like this. It 
is a pure theft in American history. Every-
body knows it. Make no mistake, this elec-
tion was stolen from you, from me, and from 
the country. 
Now, of course, each of you heard 
those words before. So had the crowd. 
The President had spent months telling 
his supporters that the election had 
been stolen, and he used this speech to 
incite them further, to inflame them, 
to stop the steal, to stop the certifi-
cation of the election results. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. We will never give up, 
we will never concede. It doesn’t happen. 
You don’t concede when there’s theft in-
volved. And to use a favorite term that all of 
you people really came up with: We will stop 
the steal. 
We must stop the steal. 
Finally, 
the 
President 
used 
the 
speech as a call to arms. It was not 
rhetorical. Some of his supporters had 
been 
primed 
for 
this 
over 
many 
months. As you will learn, days before 
this speech, as Lead Manager RASKIN 
noted, there were vast reports across 
all major media outlets that thousands 
of people would be armed, that they 
would be violent. You will learn that 
Capitol Police and the FBI reported in 
the days leading up to the attack that 
thousands in the crowd would be tar-
geting the Capitol specifically, that 
they had arrested people with guns the 
night before the attack on weapons 
charges. 
And this is what our Commander in 
Chief said to the crowd in the face of 
those warnings, right before they came 
here. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. We will not let them si-
lence your voices. We’re not going to let it 
happen. Not going let it happen. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’) 
President TRUMP. Thank you. And you 
have to get your people to fight because 
you’ll never take back our country with 
weakness. You have to show strength, and 
you have to be strong. And we fight. We fight 
like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, 
you’re not going to have a country anymore. 
‘‘You have to get your people to 
fight,’’ he told them. 
Senators, this clearly was not just 
one speech. It didn’t just happen. It 
was 
part 
of 
a 
carefully 
planned, 
months-long effort with a very specific 
instruction: Show up on January 6, and 
get your people to fight the certifi-
cation. 
He incited it. It was foreseeable. And 
again, you don’t have to take my word 
for it. The President’s former Chief of 
Staff—he is a retired marine, four-star 
general, was confirmed by this body to 
be the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
overwhelming 
vote—that 
man 
was 
John Kelly. On the day after the insur-
rection, he said this: 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. KELLY. You know, the president 
knows who he’s talking to when he tweets or 
when he makes statements. He knows who he 
is talking to. He knows what he wants them 
to do. And the fact that he said the things, 
he has been saying the things he has been 
saying since the election, and encouraging 
people, there is no surprise, again, at what 
happened yesterday. 
No surprise. Think about that. No 
surprise. The President had every rea-
son to know that this would happen be-
cause he assembled the mob, he sum-
moned the mob, and he incited the 
mob. He knew when he took that po-
dium on that fateful morning that 
those in attendance had heeded the 
words and they were waiting for his or-
ders to begin fighting. 
And that, of course, brings me, my 
fellow managers, to what happened 
here in this building. As Lead Manager 
RASKIN stated, my colleagues are going 
to walk through the events of January 
6 and the evidence in very great detail. 
They are painful to watch and to re-
count, and I am not going to repeat the 
evidence now. 
But I do want to be clear about what 
also happened during that terrible at-
tack, and that is this: that President 
Trump, once again, failed us because 
when the violence erupted, when we 
and the law enforcement officials pro-
tecting you were under attack, as each 
of you were being evacuated from this 
Chamber from a violent mob, as we 
were being evacuated from the House, 
he could have immediately and force-
fully intervened to stop the violence. It 
was his duty as Commander in Chief to 
stop the violence, and he alone had 
that power, not just because of his 
unique role as Commander in Chief but 
because they believed that they were 
following his orders. They said so. 
(Text of videotape presentation.) 
President Trump! 
President Trump! 
Fight for Trump! 
Fight for Trump! 
Fight for Trump! 
We were invited by the President of the 
United States! 
I thought I was following my President. I 
thought I was following what we were called 
to do. President Trump requested that we be 
in DC on the 6th. 
You heard it from them. They were 
doing what he wanted them to do. They 
wouldn’t have listened to you, to me, 
to the Vice President of the United 
States who they were attacking. They 
didn’t stop in the face of law enforce-
ment, police officers fighting for their 
lives to stop them. They were following 
the President. He alone, our Com-
mander in Chief, had the power to stop 
them and he didn’t. 
You will hear evidence tonight, to-
morrow, throughout the trial, about 
his refusal as Commander in Chief to 
respond to numerous desperate pleas 
on the phone, across social media, beg-
ging him to stop the attack. And you 
will see his relentless attack on Vice 
President PENCE, who was at that very 
moment hiding with his family as 
armed 
extremists 
were 
chanting, 
‘‘Hang Mike Pence,’’ calling him a trai-
tor. 
You will see that even when he did fi-
nally, 31⁄2 hours into the attack, tell 
these people to go home in peace, he 
added, as Lead Manager RASKIN said, I 
will quote: 
You’re very special. We love you. 
Think for a moment—just a mo-
ment—of the lives lost that day, of the 
more than 140 wounded police officers, 
and ask yourself if, as soon as this had 
started, President Trump had simply 
gone onto TV, just logged onto Twitter 
and said ‘‘Stop the attack.’’ If he had 
done so with even half as much force as 
he said ‘‘Stop the steal,’’ how many 
lives would we have saved? Sadly, he 
didn’t do that. 
At the end of the day, the President 
was not successful in stopping the cer-
tification. That we know, thanks to 
the bravery of our law enforcement and 
to the bravery of the Senators in this

February 10, 2021 
room, each of you who still fulfilled 
your constitutional duty even under 
the threat of mortal peril. But there 
can be no doubt of the grave harm that 
he caused to our elected leaders; to us, 
our families; to all who work at the 
Capitol, our staff, your staff; to our 
brave Capitol police, who defend us 
tirelessly with little thanks, who be-
lieved that they had a Commander in 
Chief who would defend and protect 
them, instead put them in harm’s way; 
to those killed for heeding his com-
mand; to our democracy and the sys-
tem, which ensures that we have a 
President elected by the people; to our 
national security and our standing in 
the world. The harm was real. The 
damage was real. 
Five people lost their lives on that 
terrible, tragic day. A woman was shot 
dead 50 feet from where we later cer-
tified the election results. And for 
those who question just how bad it was, 
criminal complaints recently unsealed 
by the Department of Justice are more 
than revealing. You all see one of these 
documents on the screen. In the charg-
ing affidavit of one of the leaders of the 
Proud Boys, we learned that members 
of this group ‘‘said that they would 
have killed . . . Mike Pence if given 
the chance.’’ 
In another, we learned of the tweet in 
realtime while they were in the build-
ing stating: 
We broke into the Capitol . . . we got in-
side, we did our part. . . . We were looking 
for Nancy [Pelosi] to shoot her in the friggin’ 
brain but we didn’t find her. 
And for anyone who suggests other-
wise, these defendants themselves have 
told you exactly why they were here. 
You will see this in the trial, that in 
the halls of the Capitol, on social 
media, in news interviews, and in 
charging documents, they confirmed 
they were following the President’s or-
ders. You can see some of the state-
ments on that screen, one who said: 
Trump wants all able-bodied patriots. 
Another: 
President Trump is calling us to FIGHT! 
. . . This isn’t a joke. 
Another: 
I thought I was following my President. I 
thought I was following what we were called 
to do. 
Our President wants us here. 
We wait and take orders from [the] presi-
dent. 
He made them believe, over many 
weeks, that the election was stolen and 
they were following his command to 
take back their country. 
As I prepared for today—yesterday, 
this trial—one memory that I couldn’t 
shake: It was on the night of January 
6 and the feeling of walking back onto 
the House floor and seeing many of you 
there. I remember us finishing our task 
at 4 in the morning, and as I walked off 
the floor, I was so grateful—so grate-
ful—for the opportunity to thank the 
Vice President of the United States, 
Mike Pence, for his actions, for stand-
ing before us and asking us to follow 
our oath and our faith and our duty. 
We only got a couple of hours of sleep 
that morning. Early the next day, I 
called my dad, who came to this coun-
try, as I mentioned, as an immigrant 40 
years ago, and I told him that the 
proudest moment, by far, of serving in 
Congress, for me, was going back on to 
the floor with each of you to finish the 
work that we had started. 
I am humbled to be back with you 
today. And just as on January 6, when 
we overcame that attack on our Cap-
itol, on our country, I am hopeful that 
at this trial, we can use our resolve and 
our resilience to, again, uphold our de-
mocracy by faithfully applying the 
law, vindicating the Constitution, and 
holding President Trump accountable 
for his actions. 
Mr. 
Manager 
RASKIN. 
Senators, 
Representatives JOAQUIN
CASTRO
and 
ERIC SWALWELL will now show the evi-
dence of President Trump’s long cam-
paign to delegitimize his electoral de-
feat and to galvanize his supporters to 
help him retain his power at any cost. 
So we are going to go, at this point, 
step by step to explain the progression 
all the way up until the attack. 
Mr. Manager CASTRO. Good after-
noon, you all. My name is JOAQUIN CAS-
TRO. I represent San Antonio in the 
United States Congress. There is a say-
ing that ‘‘[a] lie can travel halfway 
around the world before the truth has a 
chance to put on its shoes.’’ That was 
before the internet. 
The point of that saying is the lie 
can do incredible damage and destruc-
tion, and that is especially true when 
that lie is told by the most powerful 
person on Earth, our Commander in 
Chief, the President of the United 
States. 
This attack did not come from one 
speech, and it didn’t happen by acci-
dent. The evidence shows clearly that 
this mob was provoked over many 
months by Donald J. Trump. And if 
you look at the evidence, his purpose-
ful conduct, you will see that the at-
tack was foreseeable and preventable. 
I will start by discussing President 
Trump’s actions leading up to the elec-
tion when he set up his big lie. Begin-
ning in the spring of 2020, President 
Trump began to fall behind in the 
polls, and by July, President Trump 
had reached a new low. He was running 
15 points behind his opponent, and he 
was scared. 
He began to believe that he could le-
gitimately lose the election, so he did 
something entirely unprecedented in 
the history of our Nation. He refused to 
commit to a peaceful transition of 
power. Here is what he said: 
(Text of videotape presentation.) 
Mr. WALLACE: Can you give a direct an-
swer you will accept the election? 
Mr. TRUMP. I have to see. Look, I have to 
see. No, I’m not just going to just say yes. 
I’m not going to say no. 
Mr. WALLACE. Do you commit to making 
sure that there is a peaceful transfer of 
power? 
Mr. TRUMP. Get rid of the ballots and 
you’ll have a very peaceful—there won’t be a 
transfer, frankly. There will be a continu-
ation. 
Senators, the President of the United 
States said: There won’t be a transi-
tion of power, frankly. There will be a 
continuation. 
President Trump was given every op-
portunity to tell his supporters: Yes, if 
I lose, I will peacefully transfer power 
to the next President. Instead, he told 
his supporters the only way he could 
lose the election is if it were stolen. 
In tweet after tweet, he made sweep-
ing allegations about election fraud 
that couldn’t possibly be true. But that 
was the point. He didn’t care if things 
were true. He wanted to make sure 
that his supporters were angry, like 
the election was being ripped away 
from them. 
On May 24, 6 months before the elec-
tion, he tweeted: 
It will be the greatest Rigged Election in 
history. 
How could he possibly know it would 
be the greatest rigged election in his-
tory 6 months before the election hap-
pened? 
And, on June 22, more of the same: 
RIGGED 2020 ELECTION: IT WILL BE THE 
SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES! 
Again—about an election that had 
not even happened. 
On July 30: 
2020 will be the most INACCURATE & 
FRAUDULENT Election in history. 
Again, just big words with nothing to 
prove them, but he wanted to make his 
supporters believe that an election vic-
tory would be stolen from him and 
from them. This was to rile up his base, 
to make them angry. 
Now, these were just a few of the 
many times President Trump tweeted 
about this, and he did it in speeches, in 
rallies, and on television, too. 
(Text of video presentation of 7–31– 
2020.) 
President TRUMP: This is going to be the 
greatest election disaster in history. 
Because the only way we are going to lose 
this election is if the election is rigged. Re-
member that. 
The only way they can take this election 
away from us is if this is a rigged election. 
We are going to win this election. 
It’s a rigged election. That’s the only way 
we are going to lose. 
But this will be one of the greatest fraudu-
lent—most fraudulent elections ever. 
This is clearly a man who refuses to 
accept the possibility or the reality in 
our democracy of losing an election, 
and there are dozens more tweets and 
speeches of Donald Trump spreading 
his lie, but you get the point. His sup-
porters got the point as well. They 
firmly believed that, if he lost, it was 
because the election was rigged. 
(Text of video presentation of 9–15– 
2020.) 
The Interviewer. Will you accept the result 
if Joe Biden wins? 
Unidentified Speaker. No. 
The 
Interviewer. 
Under 
any 
cir-
cumstances? 
Unidentified Speaker. No.

deceit and corruption.

days, if Biden winds up somehow becoming 
the winner—do you think it’s rigged? 
Unidentified Speaker. Oh, yes, very much 
so. 
The Interviewer. On election night— 
Unidentified Speaker. Yes. 
The Interviewer.—if it ends up that Joe 
Biden wins— 
Unidentified Speaker. Yes. 
The Interviewer.—in your opinion, would 
that be the only way that Trump could lose, 
that it would be a rigged election? Is that 
the only way Joe Biden could win? 
Unidentified Speaker. Absolutely. I agree 
with that because there’s no way in heck our 
President is going to lose, but, yes, it would 
be a rigged election. There will be—some 
type of cheating went on, what have you, and 
I firmly believe that. 
Now, all of us in this room have run 
for election, and it is no fun to lose. I 
am a Texas Democrat, and we have lost 
a few elections over the years, but can 
you imagine telling your supporters 
that the only way you could possibly 
lose is if an American election were 
rigged and stolen from you? 
Ask yourself whether you have ever 
seen anyone at any level of government 
make the same claim about their own 
election, but that is exactly what 
President Trump did. He truly made 
his base believe that the only way he 
could lose was if the election were 
rigged. 
Senators, all of us know and all of 
understand how dangerous that is for 
our country, because the most combus-
tible thing you can do in a democracy 
is convince people that an election 
doesn’t count, that their voices and 
their votes don’t count, and that it has 
all been stolen, especially if what you 
are saying are lies. 
Let us turn now to the election. 
As you know, the results were not 
fully reported on election night, which 
is not unusual in our Nation’s history. 
But by November 7, major news net-
works, including FOX News, reported 
that, once the remaining votes were 
counted, Joe Biden would be the likely 
victor. So President Trump began urg-
ing his supporters to stop the count. 
I would imagine that, if we went 
around this room, there would be folks 
sitting here who started down on elec-
tion night and ended up coming back 
up and winning their races. Perhaps 
that is why some of you are seated in 
this room today. 
But imagine if you were behind, and 
the results started coming in, and as 
you started pulling ahead, your oppo-
nent said: That’s not fair. Stop the 
count while I am still ahead. 
That is what Donald Trump did, but 
that is not how America works. Here, 
every vote counts. You don’t just stop 
counting when one person is ahead. We 
count every vote. 
And let’s be clear: President Trump 
knew that you just can’t stop counting 
votes, but he wanted to inflame his 
base. There was a purpose behind this— 
to truly make them believe that count-
ing votes would result in a stolen, 
rigged election. 
He said at 12:49 a.m. on election 
night: 
They are trying to STEAL the Election. 
We will never let them do it. 
A little over an hour later, at, rough-
ly, 2:30 in the morning, before all the 
votes were even close to being counted, 
he goes even further and actually de-
clares victory. Take a look. 
(Text of video presentation of 11–4- 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. This is a fraud on the 
American public. This is an embarrassment 
to our country. We were getting ready to win 
this election. Frankly, we did win this elec-
tion. 
‘‘Frankly, we did win,’’ rather than 
calmly saying: Let’s count the votes. If 
there are legal issues, we will go to 
court, and we will resolve them. 
Instead, he told his supporters that 
he had actually won the election and 
that the whole thing was a fraud. He 
said that on November 4, and he has 
never renounced that statement since. 
Despite President Trump’s pressure 
at the time, election officials around 
the country continued to carry out 
their duties, and as votes were counted 
and his loss became more certain, he 
riled up his base further. Take a look 
at these tweets. 
On November 5, he tweeted, in all 
capital letters, as if shouting com-
mands: 
STOP THE COUNT! 
STOP THE FRAUD! 
Senators, this is dangerous. 
I also want you to remember these 
tweets for another reason, because that 
is what it looks like when Donald 
Trump wants people to stop doing 
something. 
Bear in mind, this is not the Presi-
dent saying to his supporters that 
somebody stole your cup of coffee. This 
is the Commander in Chief telling his 
supporters ‘‘your election is being sto-
len, and you must stop the counting of 
American votes,’’ and it worked. His 
words became their actions. His com-
mands led to their actions. Take a look 
at this. 
The same day as those tweets—the 
same day as those tweets—around 100 
Trump supporters showed up in front of 
the Maricopa County elections center 
in Phoenix, some of them carrying ri-
fles, literally trying to intimidate offi-
cials to stop the count just as Presi-
dent Trump had commanded. Arizona 
Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said 
that protesters were ‘‘causing delay 
and disruption and preventing those 
employees from doing their job.’’ 
Let’s call this what it was. We were 
facing a global pandemic, and workers 
were risking their health to ensure the 
integrity of our elections. President 
Trump’s supporters were encircling 
them, trying to prevent them from 
doing their own jobs. This was dan-
gerous, it was scary, and it was a bla-
tant act of political intimidation. 
In Philadelphia, that same day, po-
lice investigated an alleged plot to at-
tack the city’s Pennsylvania Conven-
tion Center, where votes were being 
counted. Police took at least one man 
into custody who was carrying a weap-
on. This happened all over. In Atlanta, 
in Detroit, and in Milwaukee, his sup-
porters used armed force to try to dis-
rupt the lawful counting of votes be-
cause they bought into Trump’s big lie 
that the election was stolen from 
them. 
President Trump’s months of inflam-
ing and inciting his supporters had 
worked. They believed it was their 
duty to, quite literally, fight to stop 
the count. So they showed up at elec-
tion centers across the country to do 
just that. 
(Text of video presentation of 11–5- 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. This is a fraud on the 
American public. This is an embarrassment 
to our country. We were getting ready to win 
this election. Frankly, we did win this elec-
tion. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Yeah.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Stop the count.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘They ain’t taking it 
from us.’’) 
President TRUMP. We were winning in all 
the key locations by a lot, actually, and then 
our numbers started miraculously getting 
whittled away in secret. 
(People chanting: ‘‘They will pay. They 
will be destroyed because America is ris-
ing.’’) 
And there it is. They had bought into 
his big lie. President Trump told his 
supporters over and over again, nearly 
every day, in dozens of tweets, speech-
es, and rallies, that their most precious 
right in our democracy—their voice, 
their vote—was being stripped away, 
and they had to fight to stop that. 
They believed him, and so they fought. 
You may say: Well, he didn’t know 
that they would take up arms. But 
when he did know, when it was all over 
the news, President Trump didn’t stop. 
As Mr. SWALWELL will show, after Don-
ald Trump lost, he became even more 
desperate and incited his base even fur-
ther. He urged them again and again, 
with increasingly forceful language, to 
fight to stop the steal. Even as the cer-
tification got closer and he grew even 
more desperate, he gave them specific 
instructions on how, where, and when 
to fight to stop the steal. He told them 
to show up on January 6 and march to 
the U.S. Capitol to stop the certifi-
cation of the election results, and he 
told them to come here and fight like 
hell. 
You will see, clearly, that this vio-
lent mob that showed up here on Janu-
ary 6 didn’t come out of thin air. Presi-
dent Donald John Trump incited this 
violence, and that is the truth. 
Mr. Manager SWALWELL. Mr. Presi-
dent, distinguished Senators, my name 
is ERIC SWALWELL, and I represent Cali-
fornia’s 15th Congressional District. 
Manager CASTRO just told you about 
Donald Trump’s lies and acts before 
the election, but to paraphrase Win-
ston Churchill, that wasn’t the end of 
his efforts. That wasn’t the beginning 
of the end, but perhaps it was the end 
of the beginning. Here is what I mean. 
You saw President Trump prime for 
months his supporters to believe that, 
if the election were lost, it only could

February 10, 2021 
have been so because it was rigged, but 
that took time just like, to build a fire, 
it doesn’t just start with the flames. 
Donald Trump, for months and months, 
assembled the tinder, the kindling— 
threw on logs for fuel—to have his sup-
porters believe that the only way their 
victory would be lost was if it were sto-
len. So, that way, President Trump was 
ready, if he lost the election, to light 
the match. 
And on November 7, after all the 
votes were counted, President Trump 
did lose by 7 million votes. 
But for Donald Trump, all was not 
lost. He had a backup plan. Instead of 
accepting the results or pursuing le-
gitimate claims, he told his base more 
lies. He doused the flames with ker-
osene. 
And this wasn’t just some random 
guy at the neighborhood bar blowing 
off steam. This was our Commander in 
Chief. 
Day after day, he told his supporters 
false, outlandish lies that the victory— 
that the election outcome was taken 
and it was rigged. And he had abso-
lutely no support for his claims, but 
that wasn’t the point. He wanted to 
make his base angrier and angrier. 
And to make them angry, he was 
willing to say anything. On November 
15, he stated: 
I concede NOTHING! We have a long way 
to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION! 
He doesn’t say why the election is 
rigged. 
November 17, in a Twitter statement: 
DEAD PEOPLE VOTED. 
That is it. No evidence, just ‘‘DEAD 
PEOPLE VOTED.’’ 
November 28, Twitter statement: 
We have found many illegal votes. Stay 
tuned! 
This just wasn’t true. He never found 
illegal votes. He didn’t even try to pre-
tend that he had evidence for that. And 
‘‘stay tuned’’? Well, that was all about 
inciting his base, not about bringing le-
gitimate claims. It was about drama-
tizing the election to anger his sup-
porters. 
December 5, you see here he goes 
after the Governors of Arizona and 
Georgia, Governors from his own party, 
claiming that they weren’t with him. 
You see, Senators, he is casting this 
in combat terms; that either you are 
with him, making sure that he won the 
election, or you are fighting against 
him. 
These are just a few of the hundreds 
of Twitter statements that President 
Trump sent. And it wasn’t just Twitter 
statements. 
As you will see, he was dialing into 
meetings, holding rallies, appearing on 
television, continuing to spread the big 
lie that his election victory was stolen. 
(Text of video presentation of 12–2- 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. People that were dead 
were signing up for ballots. Not only were 
they jumping in and putting in a ballot, but 
dead people were requesting ballots, and 
they were dead for years, and they were re-
questing ballots. 
President TRUMP. Dead people voting all 
over the place. 
President TRUMP. The alleged Biden mar-
gin of victory in several states is entirely ac-
counted for by extraordinarily large mid-
night vote dumps. You saw them going up to 
the sky. 
Massive 
‘‘midnight 
vote 
dumps.’’ 
Dead people voting all over the place. 
He said there were votes ‘‘going up to 
the sky.’’ 
This was never about pursuing legiti-
mate claims. He was saying anything 
he could to trigger and anger his base 
so that they would fight like hell to 
overturn a legitimate election. 
And it worked. Just as Manager CAS-
TRO
showed you, President Trump’s 
supporters were taking up arms to stop 
the count. His message to ‘‘fight like 
hell’’ was having real consequences. 
In Michigan, you will recall that 
President Trump was attacking that 
State and its officials. He continued 
these attacks even after Michigan cer-
tified its votes. 
(Text of video presentation of 11–26– 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. Take a look at Michi-
gan. Take a look at what they did with re-
spect to counties, and then you get to De-
troit and it’s like more votes than people. 
Dead people voting all over the place. 
(Text of video presentation of 12–5- 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. You know I won almost 
every county in Michigan, almost every dis-
trict. 
President TRUMP. We should have won 
that state very easily. We have a similar 
type of governor, I think, but I’ll let you 
know that in about a week. 
He is literally telling them that 
there were more votes in Detroit than 
people. 
About 260,000 people voted in Detroit. 
There are roughly 500,000 registered 
voters in Detroit. There are approxi-
mately 670,000 people living in the city. 
So, again, not true. But he needed to 
make these outlandish claims to truly 
make his supporters believe that their 
victory was stolen from them. 
And it was working. A few days after 
these clips, on December 5, his sup-
porters surrounded the Michigan Sec-
retary of State’s home. 
(Text of video presentation of 12–6- 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. I’m just sharing our 
Secretary of State’s House and . . . 
(People chanting: ‘‘Stop the steal.’’) 
Unidentified Speaker. You are a threat to 
democracy. You are a threat to free and hon-
est elections. 
Nine o’clock at night, Secretary’s 
family is inside; protestors have sur-
rounded her home; and they are chant-
ing that she is a felon. 
And, 
as 
we 
saw, 
when 
armed 
protestors showed up to follow Presi-
dent Trump’s direction to stop the 
steal, this was not the first time that 
President 
Trump’s 
supporters 
used 
threats and intimidation. 
President Trump cannot say: I didn’t 
know what I was inciting. From what 
Manager CASTRO showed and what I 
just showed, there was plenty of evi-
dence that his words had consequences, 
and if he wanted to stop it, he could 
stop it. 
You saw Mr. CASTRO read statement 
after statement from our Commander 
in Chief saying, ‘‘Stop the count.’’ 
‘‘Stop the steal.’’ 
President 
Trump 
was 
never 
shy 
about using his platforms to try and 
stop something. He could have very 
easily told his supporters: Stop threat-
ening officials. Stop going to their 
homes. Stop it with the threats. 
But each time, he didn’t. Instead, in 
the face of escalating violence, he in-
cited them further. 
The next phase in the certification of 
results was the certification on Decem-
ber 14 of the electoral college votes. 
The night before, President Trump 
personally issued 14 Twitter state-
ments, with more false claims about 
the election being stolen and directing 
his supporters to make sure that ‘‘they 
cannot be certified.’’ 
He states here: 
The RINOS— 
The RINOS— 
that run the state voting apparatus have 
caused us the problem of allowing the Demo-
crats to so blatantly cheat in their attempt 
to steal the election, which we won over-
whelmingly. 
We will never give up! 
In the face of threats to elected offi-
cials, this is his message. 
And he calls them RINOS—Repub-
licans in name only—and tells them to 
never give up. 
President Trump, to him, it was his 
supporters against anyone who would 
not overturn the election results so 
that President Trump could win. 
But on December 14, despite all of 
President Trump’s efforts to stop, the 
electors cast their votes according to 
the will of the American people, and 
Joe Biden was certified as having won 
306 electoral college votes. 
The day after this occurred, Leader 
MCCONNELL recognized this, stating: 
Many of us hoped that the presidential 
election would yield a different result, but 
our system of government has processes to 
determine who will be sworn in on January 
20. The Electoral College has spoken. 
As Manager CASTRO said, no one here, 
no one among us wants to lose an elec-
tion. Sometimes there is a reason to 
dispute an election. Sometimes the 
count is close. Sometimes we ask for a 
recount or we go to court. That is en-
tirely appropriate. 
But what President Trump did was 
different. What President Trump did 
was the polar opposite of what any of 
us would do if we lost an election be-
cause once the outcome is clear and a 
judge rules, we concede. We recognize 
the will of the American people be-
cause we let the people decide. 
And that is what all of the courts, 
the Justice Department, and the 50 
States that had counted the votes— 
they said it was time for a peaceful 
transition of power because that is 
what our Constitution and rule of law 
demands.

February 10, 2021 
Except President Trump. He directed 
all of the rage that he had incited to 
January 6. That was his last chance to 
stop the peaceful transition of power. 
And that brings us to the attack. 
Manager CASTRO told you the power of 
the lie—especially when the lie comes 
from the most powerful person in the 
world, the Commander in Chief. 
It also helps if you spend millions of 
dollars to amplify that lie. You will see 
here, 
in 
mid-December, 
President 
Trump announced the release of ads, 
including ones entitled ‘‘The Evidence 
is 
Overwhelming—FRAUD!’’ 
‘‘STOP 
THE STEAL.’’ 
He spent $50 million from his legal 
defense fund on these ads to stop the 
steal and amplify his message. They 
were released nationally, played in 
video ads, online advertising, and tar-
geted text messages. 
They used the same words and 
phrases that President Trump had been 
spreading for months; that the election 
was full of ‘‘fraud,’’ to ‘‘stop the steal.’’ 
But now they had a specific purpose. 
How do we know that purpose? These 
ads were designed to run all the way up 
to January 5, and then they stopped. 
This was purposeful and deliberate 
planning to target his base to rally 
around that day. 
And it wasn’t just his ads. He contin-
ued to use his own platform. He told 
his supporters, who truly believed their 
victory had been stolen and were ready 
to fight, when, where, and how to stop 
what he believed was a steal. 
Donald Trump would issue a delib-
erate call to action, and just like in his 
ads, that action was centered around 
January 6. 
On December 19, at 1:42 in the morn-
ing, our Commander in Chief tweeted: 
Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be 
there, will be wild! 
‘‘Will be wild!’’ We know why he 
picked this day. It wasn’t random. It 
was his last chance to stop a peaceful 
transition of power, and he gave his 
supporters plenty of time to plan. 
This was the save-the-date sent out 
18 days before the event on January 6, 
and it wasn’t a casual one-off reference 
or a single invitation. 
For the next 18 days, Donald Trump 
would make sure to remind them over 
and over and over to show up on Janu-
ary 6. 
And he would tell them exactly what 
he wanted them to do. 
On December 26, he tweets: 
If a Democrat Presidential Candidate had 
an Election Rigged & Stolen, with proof of 
such acts at a level never seen before, the 
Democrat Senators would consider it an act 
of war, and fight to the death. Mitch & the 
Republicans do NOTHING, just want to let it 
pass. NO FIGHT! 
He is saying that the Republicans are 
doing nothing and have no fight be-
cause you are doing your job, taking on 
the constitutional process of certifying 
the electoral college results. 
And 
he 
also 
suggests, 
President 
Trump, that if this was the reverse and 
the Democrats had lost, it would be an 
act of war—an act of war. That is how 
Donald Trump prepared his supporters 
for January 6. 
He even stated again, 14 minutes 
later, to make sure his supporters un-
derstood: 
The ‘‘Justice’’ Department and the FBI 
have done nothing about the 2020 Presi-
dential Election Voter Fraud, the biggest 
SCAM— 
All caps. 
—in our nation’s history, despite over-
whelming evidence. They should be ashamed. 
And then he adds: 
History will remember. Never give up. See 
everyone in D.C. on January 6th. 
That phrase, ‘‘History will remem-
ber,’’ was the only time—the first 
time—Donald Trump had used it in his 
Presidency, and he sent this to 70-plus 
million Twitter followers the day they 
needed to show up and be ready to 
fight. 
On December 27, he reminds them 
again: 
Don’t miss it. Information to follow! 
A few days later, December 30, all 
caps, ‘‘SEE YOU IN DC!’’ This con-
tinues all the way up to January 6. 
On January 1, he states: 
The BIG Protest Rally in Washington . . . 
will take place at 11:00 A.M. . . . Locational 
details to follow. StopTheSteal! 
You will see that an hour later Presi-
dent Trump retweeted one of his Twit-
ter followers. That follower was Kylie 
Kremer, executive director of Women 
for America First, the group organizing 
the January 6 rally and the creator of 
the Facebook group, Stop the Steal. 
Kremer tweeted: ‘‘The [cavalry] is 
coming, Mr. President!’’ referring to 
the cavalry showing up on January 6. 
She also added a website for supporters 
to RSVP and made clear what the mes-
sage was: hashtag ‘‘Stop The Steal.’’ 
And what did President Trump say in 
response to hearing that the cavalry 
was coming? ‘‘A great honor!’’ he wrote 
back. 
This wasn’t just a single tweet. He 
and his organizers would do this over 
and over repeatedly. On January 3, an-
other supporter tweets: 
We have been marching all around the 
country for you Mr. President. Now we will 
bring it to DC on Jan 6 and PROUDLY stand 
beside you! Thank you for fighting for us. 
When President Trump reposted her 
tweet, she wrote back: 
BEST DAY EVER!!! Thank you . . . for the 
retweet! It has been an honor to stand up and 
fight for you and our nation. We will be 
standing strong on Jan 6th in DC with you! 
We are bringing the [cavalry] Mr. President. 
‘‘We are bringing the cavalry.’’ That 
was the consistent message. This was 
not just any old protest. President 
Trump was inciting something his-
toric. The cavalry was coming, and he 
was organized. 
In her post, Ms. Lawrence tagged 
Kylie Kremer, the organizer of the 
event, whose post we just saw Presi-
dent Trump retweet. Again, you see 
this is all connected. 
I won’t show you all the Twitter 
statements—and there are a lot—but 
here’s one more. 
President Trump retweeted another 
of Ms. Kremer’s posts, which had all 
the details of January 6 with the same 
hashtags: ‘‘March For Trump,’’ ‘‘Do 
Not Certify,’’ ‘‘Stop The Steal.’’ And in 
response, President Trump, he writes 
back: 
I will be there. Historic day! 
Before Congress, I prosecuted violent 
crimes in California as an Alameda 
County deputy district attorney. And 
when you investigate and prosecute 
violent crimes, you have to distin-
guish: 
Was 
this 
a 
heat-of-passion 
crime? Or was it something more delib-
erate, planned, premeditated? 
The evidence here on this count is 
overwhelming. President Trump’s con-
duct leading up to January 6 was delib-
erate, planned, and premeditated. This 
was not one speech, not one tweet. It 
was dozens in rapid succession with the 
specific details. He was acting as part 
of the host committee. In fact, when he 
had assembled his inflamed mob in DC, 
he warned us that he knew what was 
coming. 
This was President Trump’s state-
ment the night before the attack—I 
should say this was one of his dozens of 
statements on Twitter in the hours 
leading up to the attack: 
I hope the Democrats, and even more im-
portantly, the weak and ineffective RINO 
section of the Republican Party, are looking 
at the thousands of people pouring into D.C. 
They won’t stand for a landslide . . . victory 
to be stolen. @senatemajldr @JohnCornyn 
@SenJohnThune. 
‘‘Thousands of people pouring into 
D.C. [who] won’t stand for the landslide 
election to be stolen’’—it is all right 
there. And he tags Senators to pressure 
you to stop this, and he warns all of us 
that his thousands of supporters, whom 
you will see that the FBI had warned 
were armed and targeting the Capitol, 
won’t stand for us certifying the re-
sults of the election. 
This was never about one speech. He 
built this mob over many months with 
repeated messaging until they believed 
that they had been robbed of their 
votes and they would do anything to 
stop the certification. He made them 
believe that their victory was stolen 
and incited them so he could use them 
to steal the election for himself. 
(Text of videotape presentation.) 
President 
TRUMP. 
This 
election 
was 
rigged. 
Unidentified Speaker. This is tyranny 
against the people of the United States, and 
we are not standing for it any more. 
President TRUMP. If we don’t root out the 
fraud—the tremendous and horrible fraud 
that has taken place in our 2020 election, we 
don’t have a country anymore. 
The Left lies. They cheat, and they steal. 
They are ruthless, and they are hell-bent on 
getting power and control by any means nec-
essary. 
(People chanting and screaming.) 
(Police: ‘‘Move back. Move back.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Stop the steal.’’) 
President TRUMP. Can’t let it happen. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Stop the steal.’’) 
President TRUMP. The Democrats are try-
ing to steal the White House. You cannot let 
them.

(People chanting: ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’) 
‘‘You can’t let it happen.’’ ‘‘Never 
concede.’’ ‘‘Fight,’’ he told them in 
speech after speech. These crowds were 
ready to fight. This is what President 
Trump was inciting. He foresaw what 
was coming, and this is what he delib-
erately led to our doorstep on January 
6. 
I want to be clear. During this trial, 
when we talk about the violent mob 
during the attack, we do not mean 
every American who showed up at 
President Trump’s rally. Certain Amer-
icans came to protest peacefully, as is 
their right. That is what makes our 
country so great—to debate freely, 
openly, and peacefully our differences, 
just like all of you were attempting to 
do in this very room on January 6. 
But what President Trump did was 
different. He didn’t tell his supporters 
to fight or be strong in a casual ref-
erence. He repeatedly, over months, 
told them to fight for a specific pur-
pose. He told them their victory was 
stolen, the election was rigged, and 
their patriotic duty was to fight to 
stop the steal. And he repeated this 
messaging even after he saw the vio-
lence it was inciting. And when they 
were primed and angry and ready to 
fight, he escalated and channeled their 
rage with a call to arms: Show up on 
January 6 at the exact time the votes 
of the American people were being 
counted and certified, and then march 
to the Capitol, and ‘‘fight like hell.’’ He 
told this to thousands of people who 
were armed to the teeth, targeting us 
and determined to stop the electoral 
college count. 
What our Commander in Chief did 
was wildly different from what anyone 
here in this room did to raise election 
concerns. This was a deliberate, pre-
meditated incitement to his base to at-
tack our Capitol while the counting 
was going on. And it was foreseeable, 
especially to President Trump, who 
warned us he knew what was coming. 
This is what the evidence has over-
whelmingly shown and will show in 
this trial, and it is also the truth.

TED LIEU will now detail former Presi-
dent Trump’s increasingly desperate 
attempts to stop the steal. 
Ms. Manager DEAN. Mr. President, 
esteemed Members of the Senate, it is 
my solemn honor to be before you 
today. 
I am MADELEINE
DEAN, Congress-
woman from the Fourth Congressional 
District of Pennsylvania. I am a law-
yer. I am a former professor of writing. 
I am a sister. I am a wife. I am a moth-
er. I am a grandmother to three, with 
fourth on her way. I am a person of 
faith. And I am an American. 
Along with Manager LIEU, I will 
present the actions of a desperate 
President, and we will present evidence 
today of a class of public servants who, 
standing up to enormous pressure from 
the President of the United States, did 
the right thing and upheld their oaths. 
My colleagues just presented evi-
dence of President Trump’s months- 
long effort to incite his base, leading 
them to believe the election was sto-
len, that they needed to fight like hell 
to stop the steal on January 6. 
These 
weren’t 
President 
Trump’s 
only efforts to overturn the results. 
Manager LIEU and I will present evi-
dence of President Trump’s relentless, 
escalating campaign to fabricate an 
election victory by ignoring adverse 
court rulings, pressuring and threat-
ening election officials, attacking Sen-
ators and Members of Congress, pres-
suring the Justice Department, and fi-
nally bullying his own Vice President. 
President Trump and his allies filed 
62 separate lawsuits in Federal courts 
across more than half a dozen States 
and the District of Columbia, including 
Pennsylvania, my home State, as well 
as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Min-
nesota, Nevada, and Wisconsin. Of the 
62 postelection legal challenges, he lost 
61. Only one was successful, and that 
case involved ballot curing in Pennsyl-
vania and had no impact on President 
Biden’s 80,555-vote victory in our Com-
monwealth. 
To be clear, not a single court, not a 
single judge agreed that the election 
results were invalid or should be invali-
dated. Instead, court after court re-
viewing these challenges said these 
cases were ‘‘not credible,’’ ‘‘without 
merit,’’ ‘‘based on nothing but specula-
tion,’’ and ‘‘flat out wrong.’’ 
The judiciary resoundingly rejected 
Trump’s fraud allegations and upheld 
the election results, but it was more 
than that. The court said these cases 
were different; they were dangerous to 
our democracy. For an example, in an 
opinion 
by 
United 
States 
District 
Court Judge Matthew Brann from 
Pennsylvania, he said: 
[T]his Court has been presented with 
strained legal arguments without merit and 
speculative accusations. . . . In the United 
States of America, this cannot justify the 
disenfranchisement of a single voter, let 
alone all the voters of its sixth most popu-
lated state. Our people, [and] laws, and insti-
tutions demand more. 
Because this Court has no authority to 
take away the right to vote of even a single 
person, let alone millions of citizens, it can-
not grant Plaintiff’s requested relief. 
That decision by Judge Brann was af-
firmed on appeal by Judge Stephanos 
Bibas, a Trump appointee who agreed 
and wrote: 
The Campaign’s claims have no merit. The 
number of ballots it specifically challenges 
is far smaller than the roughly 81,000-vote 
margin of victory. And it never claims fraud 
or that any of the votes were cast by illegal 
voters. Plus, tossing out millions of mail-in 
ballots would be drastic and unprecedented, 
disfranchising a huge swath of the electorate 
and upsetting all down-ballot races. 
Similarly, as Judge Linda Parker of 
the 
Eastern 
District 
of 
Michigan 
framed it—she said: 
[S]tunning in its scope and breathtaking in 
its reach. If granted, the relief would dis-
enfranchise the votes of . . . more than 5.5 
million Michigan citizens who, with dignity, 
[and] hope, and a promise of a [vote], partici-
pated in the 2020 General Election. 
Donald Trump told his supporters: 
They are stealing the election. They 
took away your vote. It is rigged. 
That was not true. According to 
judge after judge, the truth was ex-
actly the opposite. 
Trump was not suing to ensure elec-
tion integrity; he was pursuing law-
suits that would, in effect, strip away 
American votes so that he could win. 
In other words, Donald Trump was ask-
ing the judiciary to take away votes 
from Americans so that he could steal 
the election for himself. 
Then, after losing in all the courts, 
Trump turned to another tactic: pres-
suring and threatening election offi-
cials. You saw what happened in Michi-
gan after Trump attacked the State 
and its election officials. His sup-
porters surrounded the secretary of 
state’s home, as you saw in the earlier 
slide, chanting, calling her a felon. 
On November 17, the Board of Can-
vassers for Wayne County, MI, home to 
Detroit, 
unanimously 
certified 
the 
election results for Biden. That same 
night, after their vote to certify the re-
sults, Trump called the two Republican 
members of that board, pressuring 
them to change their minds. The call 
worked. The next day, both Monica 
Palmer and William Heartmann, the 
Republican board members, attempted 
to rescind their vote to certify Michi-
gan’s election results, but they simply 
couldn’t. 
President Trump didn’t stop there. 
He then contacted majority leader of 
the Michigan Senate, Mike Shirkey, 
and the speaker of the Michigan House, 
Lee Chatfield, to lobby them to over-
turn Michigan’s results. Trump invited 
Mr. Chatfield and Mr. Shirkey to Wash-
ington to meet with him at the White 
House, where the President lobbied 
them further. 
Let’s be clear. Donald Trump was 
calling officials, hosting them at the 
White House, urging them to defy the 
voters in their State and instead award 
votes to Trump. The officials held 
strong, and so Trump moved on to a 
different State, my home State of 
Pennsylvania. I am certain my Sen-
ators, CASEY and TOOMEY, remember 
what happened there. 
In early December, as he did in 
Michigan, he began calling election of-
ficials, including my former colleagues 
in the Pennsylvania Legislature, Re-
publicans, Majority Leader Kim Ward

and Speaker of the House Bryan Cut-
ler. Majority Leader Ward said the 
President called her to ‘‘declare there 
was a fraud in the voting.’’ 
Then, on November 25, President 
Trump phoned in to a Republican State 
senate policy hearing, trying to con-
vince the Republican legislators, sen-
ators, and house members that there 
had been a fraud in the vote. He even 
had his lawyer hold a phone up to the 
microphone in that hearing room so 
the committee could hear him. Here is 
what he said: 
(Text of audio presentation.) 
President TRUMP. We can’t let that hap-
pen. We can’t let it happen for our country. 
And this election has to be turned around be-
cause we won Pennsylvania by a lot, and we 
won all of these swing States by a lot. 
This was a gathering—I have at-
tended many, I have to tell you, as a 
former State legislator, a lot of policy 
hearings. I have to say with some con-
fidence, that was likely the first time a 
President of the United States of 
America called in to a State legislative 
policy hearing. 
And, remember, here is the President 
saying he won Pennsylvania, and Penn-
sylvania had been certified, that Biden 
had won by more than 80,000 votes. 
Less than a week after calling in to 
that meeting, he invited multiple Re-
publican members of the Pennsylvania 
Legislature to the White House—the 
same scheme he had used on the Michi-
gan legislators. It didn’t work with 
those public servants either. 
Think about it. The President of the 
United States was calling public offi-
cials, calling from the White House, in-
viting them into the Oval Office, tell-
ing them to disenfranchise voters of 
their State, telling them to overturn 
the will of the American people. All so 
he could take the election for himself. 
And then in Georgia, a State Trump 
had counted on for victory, his conduct 
was perhaps the most egregious. On 
November 11, Republican Secretary of 
State Brad Raffensperger confirmed 
that he believed ballots were accu-
rately counted for Biden. 
Trump went on a relentless attack. 
Here are just a few examples. In all, 
Trump tweeted at Raffensperger 17 
times in the coming weeks—there are 
just a few—calling him a ‘‘disaster,’’ 
‘‘obstinate,’’ not having a clue, being 
played for a fool, and being a ‘‘so-called 
Republican,’’ all because Raffensperger 
was doing his job, ensuring the integ-
rity of our elections. 
And these attacks had consequences. 
Mr. Raffensperger and his family re-
ceived death threats: 
Your husband deserves to face a firing 
squad. 
You better not botch this recount. Your 
life depends [upon] it. 
The Raffenspergers should be put on trial 
for treason and face execution. 
Just some of the threats they re-
ceived. After these death threats, on 
November 25, Mr. Raffensperger wrote 
an op-ed, where he said: 
My family voted for [Trump], donated to 
him and are now being thrown under the bus 
by him. 
But he also noted: 
Elections are the bedrock of our democ-
racy. They need to be run fairly and, perhaps 
more [importantly], impartially. That’s not 
partisan. That’s just American. 
It is important to remember that 
this wasn’t just a random attack. 
Trump wasn’t just criticizing a politi-
cian over policy or saying he didn’t 
agree. Donald Trump was savagely at-
tacking a secretary of state because 
the official did his job and certified the 
State according to how the people in 
that State voted. 
Donald Trump was trying to under-
mine our elections by taking votes 
away from the American people so that 
he could remain President, and he was 
willing to blame and betray anyone— 
anyone—even his own supporters, if 
they got in the way. Remember, Sen-
ators, 
those 
threats 
were 
to 
Mr. 
Raffensperger’s family. 
So some may say Trump didn’t know 
his attacks against Mr. Raffensperger 
would result in death threats—except 
that all of this was very public. The 
secretary published his op-ed in USA 
TODAY, and major networks, including 
FOX, covered the threats against the 
Raffenspergers. 
What did Trump do? Did he stop? Did 
he say: No, no, supporters; that isn’t 
what I meant? No. He doubled down. 
Let’s see the evidence. 
(Text of audio presentation of 11–26– 
2020.) 
President TRUMP. This was a massive 
fraud. This should never take place in this 
country. We’re like a third world country. 
Look at—look at Georgia. But I understand 
the secretary of state who is really, uh, uh, 
he’s an enemy of the people. The secretary of 
state—and whether he’s Republican or not, 
this man, what he’s done. 
. . . this character in Georgia, who is a dis-
aster. 
Let that sink in. A Republican public 
servant doing his job, whose family had 
just received death threats, and the 
President of the United States labeled 
him ‘‘an enemy of the people.’’ 
And that is why this is different, be-
cause this was not just one attack or 
one comment. This was attack after at-
tack in the face of clear threats of vio-
lence. 
And on December 1, another official, 
Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who 
voted for Trump, made this point and 
appealed directly to our President to 
stop his dangerous conduct: 
(Text of audio presentation 12–1–20.) 
Mr. STERLING. Mr. President, it looks 
like you likely lost the State of Georgia. 
We’re investigating. There’s always a possi-
bility—I get it—and you have the right to go 
through the courts. What you don’t have the 
ability to do—and you need to step up and 
say this—is stop inspiring people to commit 
potential acts of violence. Someone’s going 
to get hurt, someone’s going to get shot, 
someone’s going to get killed. 
Mr. Sterling put this perfectly. In 
this country, we can appropriately 
challenge a close count or go to the 
courts or disagree with others or make 
bold statements, but what Trump was 
doing was different. 
Someone’s going to get hurt, someone’s 
going to get shot, someone’s going to get 
killed. 
Mr. Sterling saw what Trump’s con-
duct was fomenting. He warned him on 
live TV that violence was already hap-
pening and that more violence was 
foreseeable and inevitable. Sterling’s 
pleas were played over and over on 
every network. 
Rather 
than 
heed 
that 
warning, 
Trump escalated again. In early De-
cember, Trump called Brian Kemp, the 
Governor of Georgia, and pressured 
him to hold a special session of the 
State legislature to overturn the elec-
tion results and to appoint electors 
who would vote for Trump. 
A few weeks later, on December 23, 
Trump called the chief investigator for 
the Georgia Bureau of Investigations, 
who was conducting an audit, an audit 
of the signature-matching procedures 
for absentee ballots. Trump urged him, 
‘‘[F]ind the fraud,’’ and claimed the of-
ficial would be a ‘‘national hero’’ if he 
did. 
Let’s call this what it is. He was ask-
ing the official to say there was evi-
dence of fraud when there wasn’t any. 
The official refused, and the investiga-
tion was completed. And on December 
29, Raffensperger announced that the 
audit found ‘‘no fraudulent absentee 
ballots’’ with a ‘‘99 percent confidence’’ 
level. 
On January 3, Trump tweeted about a 
call he had with Georgia election offi-
cials the day before. He said: 
I 
spoke 
to 
Secretary 
of State Brad 
Raffensperger yesterday about Fulton Coun-
ty and voter fraud in Georgia. He was unwill-
ing, or unable, to answer questions such as 
the ‘‘ballots under the table’’ scam, ballot 
destruction, out of state ‘‘voters’’, dead vot-
ers, and more. He has no clue! 
On January 5, the Washington Post 
released a recording of that call which 
had occurred on January 2—remember, 
just 4 days before the attack on the 
Capitol. Here is what President Trump 
said: 
(Text of audio presentation of 1–2– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. It’s more illegal for you 
than it is for them because you know what 
they did and you’re not reporting it. That’s 
the—you know, that’s a criminal—that’s a 
criminal offense. And you know, you can’t 
let that happen. That’s—that’s a big risk to 
you and to Ryan, your lawyer. That’s a big 
risk. 
Let’s be clear. This is the President 
of the United States telling a secretary 
of state that if he does not find votes, 
he will face criminal penalties—and 
not just any number of votes. Donald 
Trump was asking the secretary of 
state to somehow find the exact num-
ber of votes Donald Trump lost the 
State by. 
Remember, 
President 
Biden 
won 
Georgia by 11,779 votes. In his own 
words, Trump said: 
All I want to do is this. I just want to find 
11,780 votes. 
He wanted the secretary of state to 
somehow find the precise number, plus 
one, so that he could win.

S626 
February 10, 2021 
Here is what he said. 
(Text of audio presentation of 1–2–21.) 
President TRUMP. So, look, all I want to 
do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, 
which is one more than we have. 
He says it right there, the President 
of the United States, telling a public 
official to manufacture the exact votes 
needed so he can win. 
Senators, we must not become numb 
to this. Trump did this across State 
after State, so often, so loudly, so pub-
licly. Public officials like you and me 
received death threats and calls threat-
ening criminal penalties, all because 
Trump wanted to remain in power. 
These public officials exercised great 
political and personal courage in the 
face of unprecedented pressure from a 
President of the United States. 
Senators, ours is a dialogue with his-
tory, a conversation with the past, 
with a hope for the future. 
Senators, I thank you today for your 
kind attention. 
Mr. Manager LIEU. Good afternoon. I 
am Congressman TED LIEU. My col-
league 
Congresswoman 
DEAN
went 
through President Trump’s efforts to 
overturn the election through the 
courts and, when that started failing, 
his deeply disturbing attacks on State 
and local officials. 
I am going to walk through President 
Trump’s extraordinary efforts remain-
ing until January 6, when he tried 
again to overturn the election. 
I first want to highlight Representa-
tive RASKIN’s question to all of you 
today: Is this America? 
Like all of you, I love this country. I 
am an immigrant. My parents came to 
Ohio, and we started off living in the 
basement of a person’s home. We were 
poor, and they went to flea markets to 
sell gifts to make ends meet. Over 
many years, they built a small busi-
ness, 
opened 
six 
gift 
stores, 
and 
achieved the American dream. 
That is one reason I joined the 
United States Air Force on Active 
Duty. I believe America is an excep-
tional country. I was trained as a pros-
ecutor at Maxwell Air Force Base in 
Alabama, and I remain in the Reserves 
because we are the greatest country in 
the world. 
But how did our exceptional country 
get to the point where a violent mob 
attacked our Capitol, murdering a po-
lice officer, assaulting over 140 other 
officers? How did we get to the point 
where rioters desecrated, defiled, and 
dishonored 
your 
Senate 
Chamber, 
where the very place in which you sit 
became a crime scene, and where Na-
tional Guard troops still patrol outside 
wearing body armor? 
I will show you how we got here. 
President Donald J. Trump ran out of 
nonviolent options to maintain power. 
After his efforts in courts and threat-
ening officials failed, he turned to pri-
vately and publicly attacking Members 
of his own party in the House and in 
the Senate. He would publicly bait Sen-
ators, naming them in social media. 
For example, on December 18, Presi-
dent Trump named ‘‘@senatemajldr 
and 
Republican 
Senators,’’ 
telling 
them they ‘‘have to get tougher’’ or 
they ‘‘won’t have a Republican Party 
anymore. We won the Presidential 
Election, by a lot. FIGHT FOR IT. 
Don’t let them take it away!’’ 
President Trump was suggesting to 
Members of this Senate that if they 
didn’t help him try to overturn the 
election, there would be consequences. 
On December 24, President Trump 
wrote: 
I saved at least 8 Republican Senators, in-
cluding Mitch, from losing in the last Rigged 
(for President) Election. Now they (almost 
all) sit back and watch me fight against a 
crooked and vicious foe, the Radical Left 
Democrats. I will— 
And in all capital letters he wrote— 
NEVER FORGET! 
President Trump was telling you 
that you owe him; that if you don’t 
help him fight to overturn the results, 
he will never forget and that there will 
be consequences. These are threats, 
just like the threats he made to State 
and local officials. 
And it continued. On December 29, 
President Trump tweeted: 
Can you imagine if the Republicans stole a 
Presidential Election from the Democrats— 
All hell would break out. Republican leader-
ship only wants the path of least resistance. 
Our leaders (not me, of course!) are pathetic. 
They only know how to lose! P.S. I got 
MANY Senators and Congressmen/Congress-
women Elected. I do believe they forgot! 
President Trump targeted Senators 
and Members of Congress on social 
media, calling them pathetic for let-
ting the election get ‘‘stolen’’ from 
them. 
On January 4, 2 days before the at-
tack, President Trump tweeted: 
The ‘‘Surrender Caucus’’ within the Repub-
lican Party will go down in infamy as weak 
and ineffective ‘‘guardians’’ of our Nation, 
who were willing to accept the certification 
of fraudulent presidential numbers! 
Now he is mocking some Republican 
Members as the ‘‘Surrender Caucus,’’ 
calling them ‘‘weak and ineffective 
guardians of our Nation’’ because they 
would not pretend that he had won 
when, in fact, he had not. 
And then, the very day before the at-
tack, President Trump’s threats were 
even more heated and specific toward 
Republicans that he considered to be 
part of that ‘‘Surrender Caucus.’’ 
Now, we have shown you this tweet 
before, but I want to draw your atten-
tion to how the President was not just 
inciting his base but how he was also 
calling out specific Senate Republicans 
at the end of this tweet. This is a spe-
cific warning to anyone who won’t help 
him overturn the results. Anyone who 
was against the President became an 
enemy. 
And let me be very clear. The Presi-
dent wasn’t just coming for one or two 
people or Democrats like me; he was 
coming for you, for Democratic and Re-
publican Senators. He was coming for 
all of us, just as the mob did at his di-
rection. 
In addition to going after Senators 
and Members of Congress, President 
Trump also pressured our Justice De-
partment 
to 
investigate 
the 
false 
claims that the election was stolen. At 
the President’s direction, Attorney 
General William Barr, a loyal member 
of the President’s Cabinet, authorized 
Federal prosecutors to pursue ‘‘sub-
stantial allegations of voting and vote 
tabulation irregularities.’’ 
Bill Barr pursuing these allegations 
sparked an outcry. Sixteen assistant 
U.S. attorneys in the Trump adminis-
tration urged the Attorney General to 
cease investigations because they had 
not seen evidence of any substantial 
anomalies. That means they did not 
find any evidence of real fraud. 
Attorney General Barr pursued the 
investigation anyway, and after his in-
vestigation, this is what he found: 
[W]e have not seen fraud on a scale that 
could have effected a different outcome in 
the election. 
Two weeks later, on December 14, the 
electors voted to give Joe Biden 306 
electoral votes and ensured his victory. 
The following day, Bill Barr resigned. 
Attorney General Barr had loyally 
served President Trump. He had never 
publicly come out against the Presi-
dent. But for Bill Barr, making up elec-
tion fraud claims and saying the elec-
tion was stolen was a bridge too far. 
Bill Barr made clear that attempting 
to overturn election results crossed a 
line. According to a news report, Bill 
Barr, the highest law enforcement offi-
cial in the land, told President Donald 
Trump to his face that his theories of 
election fraud were ‘‘bullshit.’’ 
When Bill Barr resigned, his former 
Deputy, Jeff Rosen, took his place. 
President 
Trump 
initially 
tweeted 
about Mr. Rosen that he was ‘‘an out-
standing person’’ when he announced 
that he would become Acting Attorney 
General, but when Rosen took over, 
President Trump put the same pressure 
on him that he had done with State of-
ficials and Members of Congress, U.S. 
Senators, and his former Attorney 
General. 
President Trump reportedly sum-
moned Acting Attorney General Rosen 
to the Oval Office the next day and 
pressured Rosen to appoint special 
counsels to keep investigating the elec-
tion, including unfounded accusations 
of widespread voter fraud, and also to 
investigate Dominion, the voting ma-
chines firm. 
According to reports, Mr. Rosen re-
fused. He maintained that he would 
make decisions based on the facts and 
the law and reminded President Trump 
what he had already been told by At-
torney General Bill Barr—that the De-
partment had already investigated and 
‘‘found 
no 
evidence 
of 
widespread 
fraud.’’ But President Trump refused to 
follow the facts and the law, so the 
President turned to someone he knew 
would do his bidding. He turned to Jef-
frey Clark, another Justice Depart-
ment lawyer, who had allegedly ex-
pressed support for using the Depart-
ment of Justice to investigate the elec-
tion results. Shortly after Acting At-
torney General Rosen followed his

duty—and the law—to refuse to reopen 
investigations, President Trump in-
tended to replace Mr. Rosen with Mr. 
Clark, who could then try to stop Con-
gress from certifying the electoral col-
lege results. 
According to reports, White House 
Counsel Pat Cipollone advised Presi-
dent Trump not to fire Acting Attor-
ney General Rosen. Department offi-
cials had also threatened to resign en 
masse if he had fired Rosen. 
President Trump’s actions time and 
time again made clear that he would do 
anything and pressure anyone if it 
meant overturning the election results. 
We watched President Trump use any 
means necessary to pursue this aim, fe-
verishly grasping for straws at retain-
ing his hold on the Presidency, but all 
his efforts prior to January 6 kept fail-
ing. 
Finally, in his desperation, he turned 
on his own Vice President. He pres-
sured Mike Pence to violate his con-
stitutional oath and to refuse to cer-
tify the vote. President Trump had de-
cided that Vice President Pence, who 
presided over the certification, could 
somehow stop it. 
As Pence later confirmed, the Vice 
President does not have that power in 
the Constitution. And President Trump 
never tried to explain why he thought 
the Vice President could block the cer-
tification of the election results; he 
just began relentlessly attacking the 
Vice President. 
Publicly, President Trump attacked 
Pence on social media and at rallies, 
getting his supporters to believe that 
Mike Pence could stop the certification 
on January 6. Here is what President 
Trump said in Georgia on January 4. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–4– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. And I hope Mike Pence 
comes through for us, I have to tell you. I 
hope that our great Vice-President, our 
great Vice-President comes through for us. 
He’s a great guy. Of course, if he doesn’t 
come through, I won’t like him quite as 
much. 
Behind 
closed 
doors, 
President 
Trump applied significant pressure to 
his second-in-command. Multiple re-
ports confirmed that President Trump 
used his personal attorneys and other 
officials to pressure the Vice President. 
Trump reportedly told almost anyone 
who called him to also call the Vice 
President. According to reports, when 
Mike Pence was in the Oval Office, 
President Trump would call people to 
try to get them to convince the Vice 
President to help him. 
And President Trump kept repeating 
the myth that Pence could stop the 
certification to his base to anger them, 
hoping to intimidate MIKE PENCE. 
On the morning of the rally on Janu-
ary 6, President Trump tweeted: 
All Mike Pence has to do is send them 
back to the States, AND WE WIN. Do it 
Mike, this is a time for extreme courage! 
President Trump later went on to at-
tack Pence nearly a dozen times in his 
speech at the Save America March. 
Privately, in person, before Pence 
headed to oversee the joint session on 
January 6, President Trump again 
threatened Pence. ‘‘You can either go 
down in history as a patriot,’’ Mr. 
Trump told him, according to two peo-
ple briefed on the conversation, ‘‘or 
you can go down in history as a pussy.’’ 
As a veteran, I find it deeply dishon-
orable that our former President and 
Commander in Chief equated patriot-
ism with violating the Constitution 
and overturning the election. 
You will see and hear the con-
sequences of President Trump’s re-
peated attacks on the Vice President, 
the chants of ‘‘Traitor’’ and the chants 
of ‘‘Hang Mike Pence.’’ 
Thankfully, 
Vice 
President 
Mike 
Pence stood his ground, like our other 
brave officials stood their ground. He 
refused the President and fulfilled his 
duty on January 6. Even after the Cap-
itol was attacked, even after he was 
personally targeted, even after his fam-
ily was targeted, Vice President Pence 
stood strong and certified the election. 
Vice President Pence showed us what 
it means to be an American, what it 
means to show courage. He put his 
country, his oath, his values, and his 
morals above the will of one man. 
The President had tried everything 
in his power to seize the—everything in 
his attempt to seize power from the 
rightful victor of the election. Presi-
dent Trump’s extraordinary actions 
grew increasingly more desperate. You 
saw him go from pursuing claims in the 
courts to threatening State and local 
election officials, to then attacking 
Members of Congress in the Senate, to 
compromising our Justice Department, 
and then to attacking the Republican 
Vice President. 
These great public servants were 
being pressured by our Commander in 
Chief to overturn the results. Some of 
them and their families got death 
threats. Thankfully, at every turn, our 
democratic processes prevailed, and 
the rule of law prevailed. It is only be-
cause all of these people stayed strong 
and refused President Trump that our 
Republic held fast and the will of the 
electorate was seen through. And at 
this point, President Donald J. Trump 
ran out of nonviolent options to main-
tain power. 
I began today by raising the question 
of how we got here. What you saw was 
a man so desperate to cling to power 
that he tried everything he could to 
keep it, and when he ran out of non-
violent measures, he turned to the vio-
lent mob that attacked your Senate 
Chamber on January 6. 
As you cast your vote after this trial, 
I hope each of you will think of the 
bravery of all of these people who said 
no to President Trump because they 
knew that this was not right, that this 
was not America. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Next, Rep-
resentative STACEY PLASKETT of the 
Virgin Islands will show in quite 
chilling detail, I should say, how Presi-
dent Trump was well aware of the 
threat of violence on January 6 and 
how he welcomed and amplified his 
supporters’ 
plans 
for 
insurrection 
against the Union. 
I should say as lead manager, this is 
a moment of special pride for me be-
cause Representative PLASKETT is not 
only the first delegate ever to be on a 
team of impeachment managers in 
American history, but she was also my 
law student at American University 
Washington College of Law. I hope I am 
not violating any Federal educational 
records laws when I say she was an A- 
student then, and she is an A-plus stu-
dent now. 
STACEY. 
Ms. Manager PLASKETT. Thank you 
so much. 
Hi. Mr. President, distinguished Sen-
ators, I am STACEY PLASKETT, and I 
represent the people of the Virgin Is-
lands of the United States. 
Over this past weekend, my 11-year- 
old daughter—I overheard her telling 
one of my sons: Mommy doesn’t seem 
really nervous about the impeachment 
trial, to which that son, sounding like 
an older brother, said: Taliah, you will 
learn that most of the time, Mommy 
really seems to have it under control. 
We know as parents that is not al-
ways the case, but I have learned 
throughout my life that preparation 
and truth can carry far, can allow you 
to speak truth to power. I have learned 
that as a young Black girl growing up 
in the projects in Brooklyn, a housing 
community on St. Croix, sent to the 
most unlikeliest of settings, and now, 
as an adult woman representing an is-
land territory, speaking to the U.S. 
Senate. And because of truth, I am con-
fident today speaking before you be-
cause truth and fact are overwhelming 
that our President, the President of 
the United States, incited a mob to 
storm the Capitol to attempt to stop 
the certification of a Presidential elec-
tion. 
My fellow managers have shown and 
will continue to show clear evidence 
that President Trump incited a violent 
mob to storm our Capitol when he ran 
out of nonviolent means to stop the 
election. Once assembled, that mob, at 
the President’s direction, erupted into 
the bloodiest attack on this Capitol 
since 1814. 
Some of you have said there is no 
way the President could have known 
how violent the mob would be. That is 
false because the violence—it was fore-
seeable. I want to show you why this 
violence was foreseeable and why Don-
ald Trump was different than any other 
politician just telling their fighters, 
their supporters to fight for something. 
The violence that occurred on Janu-
ary 6, like the attack itself, did not 
just appear. You will see that Donald 
Trump knew the people he was incit-
ing, he saw the violence that they were 
capable of, and he had a pattern and 
practice of praising and encouraging 
that violence, never ever condemning 
it.

February 10, 2021 
And you will see that this violent at-
tack was not planned in secret. The in-
surgents believed that they were doing 
the duty of their President. They were 
following his orders. And so they pub-
licized openly, loudly, proudly exact 
blueprints of how the attack would be 
made. 
Law enforcement saw these postings 
and reported that these insurgents 
would violently attack the Capitol 
itself. This was months of cultivating a 
base of people who were violent, prais-
ing that violence, then leading that vi-
olence—that 
rage—straight 
at 
our 
door. 
The point is this: By the time he 
called the cavalry of his thousands of 
supporters on January 6, at an event he 
had invited them to, he had every rea-
son to know that they were armed, 
that they were violent, and that they 
would actually fight. He knew who he 
was calling and the violence they were 
capable of, and he still gave the march-
ing orders to go to the Capitol and 
‘‘Fight like hell’’ to ‘‘Stop the Steal.’’ 
Make no mistake, the violence was 
not 
just 
foreseeable 
to 
President 
Trump; the violence was what he delib-
erately encouraged. As early as Sep-
tember, Trump set the precedent that, 
when asked to denounce violence, he 
would do the opposite and encourage it. 
Now, if the President had only said 
something once about fighting to stop 
the steal, and violence erupted, there 
would be no way to know he intended 
to incite it or saw it coming. But just 
as the President spent months spread-
ing his big lie of the election, he also 
spent months cultivating groups of 
people who, following his command, re-
peatedly engaged in real, dangerous vi-
olence. And when they did, when the 
violence erupted as a response to his 
calls to fight against the stolen elec-
tion, he did not walk it back. He did 
not tell them no. He did the opposite— 
the opposite. He praised and encour-
aged the violence so that it would con-
tinue. He fanned the flame of violence 
and it worked. 
You will see this over time. These 
very groups and individuals whose vio-
lence the President praised helped lead 
the attack on January 6. And that is 
how we know clearly that President 
Trump deliberately incited this and 
how we know he saw it coming. 
There are many examples where the 
President engaged in this pattern. I am 
just going to walk you through a few of 
them. 
Let’s start with President Trump’s 
incitement of the Proud Boys. Many of 
you have heard of this group, which 
since 2018 has been classified by the 
FBI as an extremist organization. 
Since that classification, the group has 
repeatedly engaged in serious acts of 
violence, including at pro-Trump ral-
lies. In one such act on September 7, 
the Proud Boys attacked a man with a 
baseball bat and then punched him 
while he was down on the ground. 
On September 29, during a Presi-
dential debate, President Trump was 
asked specifically if he was willing to 
condemn White supremacy and militia 
groups, if he was willing to tell them to 
stand down and stop the violence. Let’s 
watch. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. WALLACE. Are you willing tonight to 
condemn White supremacists and militia 
groups— 
President TRUMP. Sure. 
Mr. WALLACE. And to say that they need 
to stand down and not add to the violence at 
a number of these cities as we saw in Keno-
sha and as we’ve seen in Portland? 
President TRUMP. Sure. I’m willing to do 
that. 
Mr. WALLACE. Will you say that specifi-
cally? 
President TRUMP. I would say— 
Mr. WALLACE. Then go ahead, sir. Do it. 
Say it. 
President TRUMP. I would say— 
Let’s hear now the President’s re-
sponse. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. Chris WALLACE. Do it, sir. Say it. Do 
it. 
President TRUMP. Say it. Do it. Say it. 
You want to call them—what do you want to 
call them? Give me a name. Give me a name. 
Go ahead. 
Mr. Chris WALLACE. White supremacists 
and White proud— 
President TRUMP. Who do you want me to 
condemn? Proud Boys, stand back and stand 
by. 
When asked to condemn the Proud 
Boys and White supremacists, what did 
our President say? He said: 
Stand back and stand by. 
His message was heard loud and 
clear. The group adopted that phrase, 
‘‘Stand back and stand by’’ as their of-
ficial slogan. They created merchan-
dise with their new slogan, which they 
wore proudly across their backs at 
Trump’s rallies and they followed the 
President’s orders. 
You will see more about this later in 
the trial, but you will see in these 
photos to the left, Dominic Pezzola, 
and to the right, William Pepe, two of 
the leaders of the group heading to the 
Capitol on January 6. They were later 
charged with working together to ob-
struct law enforcement. 
As we go through this evidence, I 
want you to keep in mind these words 
by President Trump when asked to 
condemn violence: 
Stand back and stand by. 
And see example after example of the 
kinds of people, like the Proud Boys, 
who he had standing by on January 6. 
By October, as my colleagues Mr. 
CASTRO and Mr. SWALWELL showed you, 
Donald Trump was escalating his big 
lie that the only way he could lose the 
election was if it was rigged. So as 
election day neared, his supporters 
were frustrated and they were angry. 
They were prepared to ensure his vic-
tory by any means necessary. 
One of these violent acts was on Oc-
tober 30. Sometime after 12:30 p.m., a 
caravan of more than 50 trucks covered 
in 
pro-Trump 
campaign 
gear 
con-
fronted and surrounded cars carrying 
Biden-Harris campaign workers and a 
Biden-Harris campaign bus as they 
were traveling down Interstate 35 from 
San Antonio to Austin. 
(Video presentation.) 
According to witnesses, this caravan 
repeatedly tried to force the bus you 
saw and you see in that video to slow 
down in the middle of the highway and 
then to run it off the road. What that 
video you just saw does not show is 
that the bus that they tried to run off 
the road was filled with young cam-
paign staff, volunteers, supporters, sur-
rogates—people. 
As the Trump supporters closed in on 
the bus, a large black pickup truck 
adorned with Trump flags suddenly and 
intentionally swerved and crashed into 
a car driven by a Biden-Harris volun-
teer. News of the event went viral on 
social media. The President of the 
United States, in a campaign, saw his 
own supporters trying to run a bus car-
rying his opponents’ campaign workers 
off the highway, to physically intimi-
date people in this country cam-
paigning. 
Here was his response the next day. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Three, two, one, go! 
Welcome to the Red Kingdom. 
Yeah. 
Red Kingdom. 
Welcome to the Red Kingdom. 
Yeah. 
Red Kingdom. 
Welcome to the place where we run it. 
The President of the United States 
tweeted a video of his supporters try-
ing to drive a bus off of the road. You 
will recall in that first video that I 
showed you there was no sound. Well, 
the one that he tweeted had a fight 
theme song placed to it that the Presi-
dent—the President—put that music to 
that video and he added at the top: ‘‘I 
LOVE TEXAS!’’ 
By the next evening, that tweet that 
he did had been viewed 12.6 million 
times. And it wasn’t just the tweet. 
On November 1, at a Michigan rally 
with a sea of supporters, the President 
talked about that incident again. Here 
it is. 
President TRUMP. You see the way our 
people, you know, they were protecting his 
bus yesterday because they’re nice. So his 
bus—they had hundreds of cars, ‘‘Trump,’’ 
‘‘Trump,’’ ‘‘Trump,’’ ‘‘Trump’’ and the Amer-
ican flag. You see ‘‘Trump’’ and the Amer-
ican flag. 
The President made a public joke of 
violence against campaigners in an 
American election. He made light of it. 
This was not a joke. In fact, it was so 
violent, it put so many people in 
harm’s way that the FBI investigated 
the incident and the criminal responsi-
bility of those who attacked these cam-
paign workers. 
Now, our President, Donald Trump, 
could have said: OK, I didn’t realize 
how bad that was. This was very vio-
lent. Please stop. 
But he didn’t. He saw the investiga-
tion and made a statement in defense 
of his supporters’ attack on the bus 
writing: 
In my opinion, these patriots did nothing 
wrong.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S629 
February 10, 2021 
Engaging in violence for him made 
them patriots to Donald Trump. For 
anyone who says Donald Trump didn’t 
know the violence he was inciting, I 
ask you to consider his supporters 
tried to drive a bus off a highway in 
the middle of the day to intimidate his 
opponents’ campaign workers, and his 
response was to tweet the video of the 
incident that had fight music, joke 
about it, and call those individuals in 
that incident patriots. 
And once again, Donald Trump’s 
praise worked to incite them further. 
Emboldened by that praise, they re-
mained ready to fight, ready to ‘‘Stand 
back and stand by.’’ This link is not 
hypothetical. 
Just like we saw the Proud Boys 
showing up in full force on January 6, 
Donald Trump’s encouragement of this 
attack made sure his supporters were 
ready for the next one. The caravan 
bus attack had been organized by a 
Trump supporter named Keith Lee. 
Leading up to the attack on our Cap-
itol of January 6, Mr. Lee teamed up 
with other supporters to fundraise to 
help to bring people to Washington, 
DC, for that date. 
The morning of the attack, he filmed 
footage of the Capitol, pointed out the 
flimsiness of the fencing, and then ad-
dressed his supporters before the at-
tack, saying: 
As soon as you all get done hearing the 
President, y’all get to the Capitol, we need 
to surround this place. 
During the attack, he used the bull-
horn to call out for the mob to rush in. 
He later went to the Rotunda, himself, 
and then back outside to urge the 
crowd to come inside. These are the 
people 
that 
President 
Trump 
cul-
tivated, who were standing by. 
I would like to look at another exam-
ple. After the election on December 12, 
Trump supporters gathered in mass to 
protest the ‘‘stolen’’ election in DC. It 
was billed by his loyalists as the sec-
ond Million MAGA March. The rally 
was organized by Women for America 
First, the same group that you will see 
later secured the permit for the Janu-
ary 6 rally. And who else was there? 
The Proud Boys, standing by. 
Donald Trump did not attend that 
rally, but he made sure to make clear 
to his supporters, throughout the day, 
how he felt about the event. At 8:47 
a.m., he sent out a tweet: 
WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!! 
And then the rally began. And Don-
ald Trump’s allies who spoke at the 
rally carried on his message of the sto-
len election and the importance of 
fighting to stop the steal. 
Here is Nicholas Fuentes, a commen-
tator who had organized a ‘‘stop the 
steal rally’’ in Michigan with Trump 
supporters. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. FUENTES. In the first Million MAGA 
March, we promised that if the GOP would 
not do everything in their power to keep 
Trump in office that we would destroy the 
GOP. 
(People chanting: Yeah. GOP.) 
Mr. FUENTES. And as we gather here in 
Washington, DC, for a second Million MAGA 
March, we’re done making promises. It has 
to happen now. We are going to destroy the 
GOP! 
(People chanting: Yeah. Yeah. Let’s go. 
Let’s go. Destroy the GOP. Destroy the GOP. 
Destroy the GOP.) 
Those words—that was Trump’s mes-
sage: Destroy anyone who won’t listen, 
who won’t help them take the election 
for Trump. 
And, as you will see, this was just the 
preview for Fuentes, who, like the 
Proud Boys and the Trump caravan or-
ganizers, would later heed the Presi-
dent’s call and come to Washington 
and be there on January 6. 
Later in the rally, a former Trump 
campaign spokeswoman, Katrina Pier-
son, also spoke. 
During her speech, she stated: ‘‘This 
isn’t over. This is just beginning,’’ re-
ferring to the fight to stop the steal. 
Then she added: 
We knew that both Republican and Demo-
crats were against we the people. We are the 
cavalry. No one’s coming for us. 
It is clear that Trump and some of 
his supporters saw this as war—a fight 
against anyone who was unwilling to 
do whatever it took to keep Donald 
Trump in power. ‘‘We are the cavalry.’’ 
President Trump continued to rein-
force the support of these messages 
throughout the day. At 1:48 p.m., after 
both speeches, he retweeted his Deputy 
Chief of Staff’s tweet, showing his 
crowd that he had flown over on Ma-
rine One, and he tweeted: 
Thank you, Patriots. 
These people were, as you can see, 
gathered en masse and being told by 
the President’s allies that their elec-
tion had been stolen, and they were 
told they were the cavalry; that no one 
else could do it. 
After hearing these speeches and see-
ing the President’s support, this is 
what Donald Trump’s cavalry was ca-
pable of. 
(Video footage of 12–12–2020.) 
What you just saw was the violence 
that ensued after that rally. 
The Proud Boys, after that rally, en-
gaged in serious acts of violence in 
downtown DC. Some Trump supporters 
and self-identified Proud Boys vandal-
ized churches after that rally. 
If we look at these events, it is clear 
how we got here because what did the 
President do after that? He turned 
right around, and a little over a week 
later, he began coordinating the Janu-
ary 6 Save America rally with the same 
people who had planned the second Mil-
lion MAGA March. 
You will recall that the Women for 
America First had organized that sec-
ond Million MAGA March. They had 
originally planned rallies for January 
22 and January 23, after the inaugura-
tion, but Donald Trump had other 
plans. 
On 
December 
19, 
President 
Trump tweeted his save the date for 
January 6. He told his supporters to 
come to DC for a ‘‘big protest’’ that 
day, billing it as ‘‘wild.’’ Just days 
later, Women for America First amend-
ed their permit to hold their rally on 
January 6, pursuant to the President’s 
save the date, instead of after the inau-
guration. This was deliberate. 
Reports confirm that the President 
himself, President Trump, became di-
rectly involved with the planning of 
the event, including the speaking line-
up and even the music to be played, 
just as he chose the music of his 
retweet of the caravan, driving the 
Biden-Harris bus off the road, with a 
fight song. 
He brought in the same people who 
spoke at the second Million MAGA 
rally to help as well. Trump’s cam-
paign adviser, Katrina Pierson, who 
you will recall said on December 12 
that this is only the beginning—‘‘we 
are the cavalry’’—also became directly 
involved in planning the event. They 
even sent out invitations together. 
This is Amy Kremer, one of the 
Founders of Women for America First, 
tweeting the invitation, tagging Don-
ald Trump and other organizers, invit-
ing the same supporters who had just 
engaged in serious violence at the sec-
ond Million MAGA rally to show up to 
the largest rally to stop the steal. 
President Trump seemed to have other 
plans for what was going to happen at 
that rally too. 
Women for America First had ini-
tially planned for the rally goers to re-
main at the Ellipse until the counting 
of the State electoral slates was com-
pleted, just like they had remained at 
the Freedom Plaza after the second 
Million MAGA March. In fact, the per-
mit stated, in no uncertain terms, that 
the march from the Ellipse was not 
permitted. It was not until after Presi-
dent Trump and his team became in-
volved in the planning that the march 
from the Ellipse to the Capitol came 
about in direct contravention of the 
original permit. This was not a coinci-
dence. None of this was. 
Donald Trump, over many months, 
cultivated violence, praised it, and 
then, when he saw the violence his sup-
porters were capable of, he channeled it 
to his big, wild, historic event. He or-
ganized January 6 with the same peo-
ple who had just organized the rally re-
sulting in substantial violence, and he 
made absolutely sure, this time, these 
violent rally-goers wouldn’t just re-
main in place. He made sure that those 
violent people would literally march 
right here, to our steps, from the El-
lipse to the Capitol, to stop the steal— 
his cavalry. This was deliberate. 
Because the President of the United 
States incited this, because he was or-
chestrating this, because he was invit-
ing them, the insurgents were not shy 
about their planning. They believed 
they were following the orders of the 
Commander in Chief. They were, as 
with the tweet we just saw, quite lit-
erally, his cavalry. So they posted 
exact blueprints of the attack openly, 
loudly, proudly, and they did this all 
over public forums. They were not just 
hidden posts on dark websites that

Trump would not have seen. Quite the 
opposite. We know that President 
Trump’s 
team 
monitored 
these 
websites. We know this because his ad-
visers confirmed it. 
An ‘‘ex-White House and campaign 
insider,’’ as you will read, ‘‘who has 
known both Scavino and the president 
for years, said there was no way that 
Scavino and the Trump social media 
operation would not have been aware of 
the plans circulating online to storm 
the Capitol’’ because the Trump ‘‘oper-
ation closely monitored the web’s 
darkest corners, ranging from main-
stream 
sites 
such 
as 
Twitter, 
Facebook, and Reddit, to fringe mes-
sage boards like 4chan and 8chan (now 
called 8kun) to TheDonald.win, an off-
shoot from a banned Reddit commu-
nity dedicated to rabidly supporting all 
things Trump.’’ They actively mon-
itored 
the 
exact 
sites, 
like 
TheDonald.win, on which these insur-
rectionists wrote their posts. 
So what would Trump and his team 
have seen when they were monitoring 
these sites? What would his supporters 
have said? They would have seen a 
clear roadmap of exactly what hap-
pened. 
This is an example of a post that was 
captured from one of the sites dedi-
cated to Donald Trump, that we just 
talked about, shortly before the site 
was taken down. 
The meme reads: 
The Capitol is our goal. Everything else is 
a distraction. Every corrupt Member of Con-
gress locked in one room and surrounded by 
real Americans is an opportunity that will 
never present itself again. 
Let that sink in. Think about that. 
The exact thing that happened on Jan-
uary 6—that was their goal, and they 
said it out loud on sites that the 
Trump administration was actively 
monitoring. 
A third-party site captured a post on 
TheDonald.win, where one user posted: 
This cannot simply be a protest. It has to 
be the establishment of the MAGA militia 
with command offices set up, with all further 
militia tactical missions spreading from 
there. 
Another user said in response: 
We will have to achieve an actual tactical 
victory like storming and occupying [the 
Capitol] to have the intended effect. 
That is what they understood Donald 
Trump to want—there it is in black 
and white—and they explained why 
they felt justified in this. 
Another 
poster 
on 
the 
forum 
TheDonald.win wrote on January 4: 
If Congress illegally certifies Biden . . . 
Trump would have absolutely no choice but 
to demand us to storm Congress and kill/beat 
them up for it. 
Donald Trump will have no choice. 
That was what he made them believe 
to the point his supporters felt justi-
fied even in carrying weapons and 
storming our Capitol. This was in post 
after post. 
Here is another. When discussing how 
to carry guns into DC, one noted: 
Yes, it’s illegal, but this is war, and we’re 
clearly in a post-legal phase of our society. 
What? They treated it as a war, and 
they meant it. 
On the morning of the attack, under 
a thread titled ‘‘Today, I told my kids 
goodbye,’’ one poster wrote: 
Today I had the very difficult conversation 
with my children, that daddy might not 
come home from DC. 
Within a matter of hours, that post 
amassed 4,000 ‘‘likes.’’ 
President Trump had truly made 
them believe that their election had 
been stolen and that it was their patri-
otic duty to fight to steal it back—‘‘pa-
triotic,’’ a term he gave those who use 
violence for him—and they were will-
ing to say goodbye to their children for 
this fight. 
These supporters didn’t just rely on 
entering the Capitol with guns hap-
hazardly. They had maps of this build-
ing. They talked through which tun-
nels to use and how to get to the Sen-
ate Chamber. Some posted specific 
floor plan layouts of the Capitol along-
side hopes of overwhelming law en-
forcement to ‘‘find the tunnels; arrest 
the worst traitors.’’ 
Posters also fixated on what they saw 
as their ability to easily overwhelm 
the Capitol Police as ‘‘there are only 
around 2k of them,’’ and, again, they 
urged ‘‘the capitol is our goal. Every-
thing else is a distraction.’’ 
There were hundreds of these posts— 
hundreds—monitored by the Trump ad-
ministration, and these posts were 
chillingly accurate right down to com-
munication devices. 
A new affidavit, filed by the FBI, de-
scribed preparations by the rightwing 
group, the Proud Boys, to storm the 
Capitol, including using earpieces and 
walkie-talkies to direct movements 
throughout the building. This hap-
pened. That is the level of planning in 
advance that occurred. They had ear-
pieces. On the slide, you will see Proud 
Boy member Dominic Pezzola has an 
earpiece in his right ear, consistent 
with the affidavit. In addition to these 
detailed posts, they made clear why 
they thought they could do this. It 
wasn’t just that they were doing it fol-
lowing the President’s orders; they 
thought he would help them. 
A third-party site captured a post on 
TheDonald.win—again, the site mon-
itored by Trump’s team. 
He [meaning Donald Trump in this in-
stance] can order the NAT guard to stand 
down if needed. Unfortunately he has no con-
trol over the Capitol Police . . . but there 
are only around 2k of them and a lot are use-
less fat asses or girls. 
It is all right there—the overall goal, 
maps of the Capitol, the weapons, com-
munications devices. They even said 
publicly, openly, proudly that Presi-
dent Trump will help them to com-
mandeer the National Guard so all 
they have to do is overwhelm the 2,000 
Capitol Police officers. 
This was reported in the NBC News 
and the Washington Post, with head-
lines like: ‘‘Violent threats ripple 
through 
far-right 
internet 
forums 
ahead of protest.’’ ‘‘Pro-Trump forums 
erupt with violent threats ahead of 
Wednesday’s rally against the 2020 elec-
tion.’’ 
FOX News also reported that the 
Proud Boys would come to the January 
6 rally prepared for violent action, even 
quoting a Proud Boy member who said 
they would be ‘‘incognito’’ and ‘‘spread 
across downtown DC in smaller num-
bers.’’ 
City officials, seeing these same 
warnings, also publicly warned about 
the violence and unlawful weapons at 
the event. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser 
cautioned residents of the District of 
Columbia to avoid the downtown area 
while the rally attendees were in town. 
Federal law enforcement warned of 
these threats also. On January 3, a 
Capitol 
Police 
intelligence 
report 
warned of a violent scenario in which 
‘‘Congress itself’’ could be the target of 
the angry supporters of 
President 
Trump on January 6. According to that 
report, obtained by the Washington 
Post: 
Supporters of the current president see 
January 6, 2021, as the last opportunity to 
overturn the results of presidential election. 
. . . This sense of desperation and dis-
appointment may lead to more . . . incentive 
to become violent. Unlike previous post-elec-
tion protests, the targets of the pro-Trump 
supporters are not necessarily the counter- 
protesters as they were previously, but rath-
er Congress itself is the target [for January 
6]. 
The day before the rioters stormed 
the Congress, an FBI office in Virginia 
also issued an explicit warning that ex-
tremists were preparing to travel to 
Washington to commit violence and 
‘‘war,’’ according to internal reports. 
The FBI report cited to an online 
post where the user declared that 
Trump supporters should go to Wash-
ington and get violent. The supporter 
said: 
Stop calling this a march, or rally, or a 
protest. Go there ready for war. We get our 
President or we die. 
These threat warnings were not just 
hypothetical. Actual arrests occurred 
in the days leading to the attack. 
On January 4, 2 days before the rally, 
one extremely well-publicized arrest 
was of a Proud Boy leader who de-
stroyed a church’s Black Lives Matter 
banner a month earlier during the De-
cember 
12, 
second 
Million 
MAGA 
March. The report emphasized that 
when he was arrested, he was carrying 
high-capacity 
firearms 
magazines, 
which he claimed were meant to be 
supplied to another rally attendee for 
January 6. 
By the night before the January 6 at-
tack, DC police had already made six 
arrests in connection with the planned 
protests on charges of carrying weap-
ons, ammunitions, assault, assaulting 
police. 
This is all in public view—all of it. 
The truth is usually seen and rarely 
heard. Truth is truth, whether denied 
or not, and the truth is, President 
Trump had spent months calling his 
supporters to a march on a specific 
day, at a specific time, in specific 
places to stop the certification.

S631 
February 10, 2021 
And leading up to the event, there 
were hundreds—hundreds—of posts on-
line showing that his supporters took 
this as a call to arms to attack the 
Capitol. There were detailed posts of 
the plan to attack online. Law enforce-
ment warned that these posts were real 
threats and even made arrests days 
leading up to the attack. 
And yet, in the face of all this—these 
credible warnings of serious, dangerous 
threats to our Capitol—when those 
thousands of people were standing in 
front of President Trump, ready to 
take orders and attack, this is what he 
said: 
We’re going to the Capitol. 
And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you 
don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have 
a country anymore. 
And that is why this is different. 
That is why he must be convicted and 
disqualified. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Representa-
tive DEAN will now return to the events 
of January 6 itself. She will dem-
onstrate President Trump’s repeated 
incitement of the crowd that morning, 
as he directed them to the Capitol in 
his last-ditch effort to retain his hold 
on power. 
Ms. Manager DEAN. For me and for 
many Americans, January 6 is forever 
etched in our memories. 
I went to work with a sense of excite-
ment—the start of my second term in 
Congress and the first time I would 
participate in the certification of a 
Presidential election. 
And then we all know what happened. 
I know many of us have similar experi-
ences from that day, but I will briefly 
share mine. I stood with colleagues in 
the Gallery above the House floor to 
observe the Arizona challenge. Mo-
ments later, police radios reported a 
breach of the Capitol grounds. Some-
one shouted up to us, ‘‘Duck’’; then, 
‘‘Lie down’’; then, ‘‘Ready your gas 
masks.’’ 
Shortly after, there was a terrifying 
banging on the Chamber doors. I will 
never forget that sound. Shouts and 
panicked calls to my husband and to 
my sons, instructions to flee, and then 
the constant worrying of the gas masks 
filtering the air—the Chamber of the 
United States House of Representatives 
turned to chaos. 
For Donald Trump, it was a very dif-
ferent day. Earlier, I showed you Don-
ald Trump’s desperate attempts to 
maintain power: ignoring adverse court 
rulings, attacking elected officials, 
pressuring his Justice Department, 
even attacking his own Vice President. 
You saw a man who refused to lose, 
who was desperate to retain power by 
any means necessary. You saw a man 
willing to attack anyone and everyone 
who got in his way, and you saw a man 
who thought he could play by different 
rules. 
He told his supporters, as my col-
league Ms. PLASKETT just showed you, 
exactly what he thought those dif-
ferent rules were—combat, fight, vio-
lence. 
This was not just one speech. This 
was weeks and weeks of deliberate ef-
fort by Donald Trump to overturn the 
election results so that he didn’t have 
to give up the Presidency. 
The speech on January 6 builds on, 
refers to, and amplifies that same pat-
tern—the pattern Trump had used and 
broadcasted for months: He refused to 
lose, his attacks on others, and his dif-
ferent rules. 
The only thing different about his 
speech on January 6 from all these 
other times that we went through was 
that he was no longer telling his base 
just that they had to fight to stop the 
steal. He was finally telling them: Now 
is the time to do it. Here is the place, 
and here is how. 
For weeks, he had urged his sup-
porters to show up at a specific time 
and place, and when they got there, he 
told them exactly what he wanted. 
Let’s start with his desperation. You 
saw how much planning went into Jan-
uary 6, and when the day arrived, Don-
ald Trump’s desperation was in full 
force. 
Between the time he woke up on Jan-
uary 5 and the start of the Save Amer-
ica March that next day, he had 
tweeted 34 times. When Donald Trump 
wants to get his message across, he is 
not shy, as you all know. These tweets 
were relentless. And these tweets all 
centered on his singular focus—his 
drumbeat to motivate, anger, and in-
cite his supporters—his big lie: The 
Presidential election had been rigged. 
It had been stolen from him, and they 
had to fight to stop it. 
And the timing was no coincidence. 
He sent 34 tweets because this was his 
last chance to rile up his supporters be-
fore the big, historic, wild event he had 
planned. 
Now, I won’t go through all of these 
tweets, but let me just highlight a few. 
At 1 in the morning, he tweeted: 
If Vice President [Mike Pence] comes 
through for us, we will win the Presidency. 
. . . Mike can send it back. 
This will look familiar to you be-
cause Mr. LIEU just showed you how 
Trump had privately been pressuring 
and publicly attacking his Vice Presi-
dent to stop the certification. 
And when Vice President Pence re-
fused, when he explained that the Con-
stitution simply does not allow him to 
stop certification, Donald Trump pro-
voked his base to attack him. The late- 
in-the-evening tweet was no different. 
It just got more forceful. 
Let’s be clear. What Donald Trump 
was saying—that Vice President Pence 
could send back the certification—was 
not true. 
For one thing, all 50 States had rati-
fied this election. And for another, 
Vice President Pence explained to him 
that he does not have the power to uni-
laterally overturn States’ votes and 
just send certification back. 
And Donald Trump knew this, but 
this was his last chance to get his Vice 
President to stop the certification, and 
so he was willing to say or do just 
about anything. 
These tweets—attacking the election 
as fraudulent, attacking his Vice Presi-
dent, and urging his supporters to 
fight—continued throughout the morn-
ing. 
Here is another example. At 8:17 a.m. 
he tweeted: 
All Mike Pence has to do is send it back to 
the States, AND WE WIN. 
‘‘And we win.’’ That is what he said, 
even though by then he had clearly 
lost. 
As Trump continued tweeting, the 
Save America March at the White 
House was now in full swing. The 
speakers who warmed up the crowd for 
Trump were members of his inner cir-
cle—family members, his personal at-
torney, people President Trump had 
deputized to speak on his behalf. 
Some of the speakers also spoke at 
the 
second 
Million 
MAGA 
March, 
which resulted in serious violence. 
The warmup acts on January 6 fo-
cused on promoting Donald Trump’s 
big lie. They stoked the same fears—a 
stolen election, of fraud, of ripping vic-
tory away from them. And the speak-
ers told them what to do about it. As 
the crowd erupted in ‘‘fight for Trump’’ 
chants throughout that morning, Don-
ald Trump Jr. urged: 
That’s the message! These guys better 
fight for Trump! 
The speakers lasted 3 hours, repeat-
ing President Trump’s message. And, 
finally, at about noon, Donald Trump 
took the stage with the seal of the 
Presidency on his podium and the 
White House as his backdrop. 
President Trump spoke for more than 
70 minutes. His narrative was familiar. 
It was the same message he had spent 
months spreading to his supporters: 
the big lie, the election was stolen; 
that they should never concede; and 
that his supporters should be patriots 
and fight much harder to stop the 
steal, to ‘‘take back our country’’—the 
same phrases he had spread for weeks. 
But now the message was immediate. 
Now it was just no longer just fight; it 
was ‘‘fight right now.’’ 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. All of us here today do 
not want to see our election victory stolen 
by emboldened radical-left Democrats, which 
is what they’re doing. And stolen by the fake 
news media. That is what they’ve done and 
what they’re doing. We will never give up. 
We will never concede. It doesn’t happen. 
You don’t concede where there’s theft in-
volved. 
Our country has had enough. We will not 
take it anymore, and that’s what this is all 
about. And to use a favorite term that all of 
you people really came up with: We will stop 
the steal. 
That set the tone. ‘‘Our country has 
had enough.’’ And ‘‘[w]e will not take 
it anymore.’’ 
He told them and us, right at the be-
ginning, that the only way to take 
back the country was to fight. Let’s 
look at what he said next. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. And, Rudy, you did a 
great job. He’s got guts. You know what?

He’s got guts, unlike a lot of people in the 
Republican Party. He’s got guts. He fights. 
Ms. PLASKETT showed you example 
after example of Donald Trump, when 
confronted with violence, praising it. 
We saw him instruct the Proud Boys, a 
violent extremist group, to stand back 
and stand by. That group was there on 
January 6. We saw him praise a cara-
van of his supporters after they tried 
to drive a bus belonging to the Biden 
campaign off the road. The organizer of 
that attack was there on January 6. 
And we saw him team up with the or-
ganizers of the violent second MAGA 
Million March to plan his rally on Jan-
uary 6. 
What does he do at that rally? He 
tells Giuliani he is doing a great job 
addressing the crowd, saying he has 
‘‘guts’’ to call for fighting. And to be 
clear, this is what he was praising. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Mr. GUILIANI. So let’s have trial by com-
bat. 
‘‘Trial by combat.’’ Donald Trump 
praised Rudy, said he did a good job, 
had guts for telling the crowd that we 
need trial by combat. 
Next, more attacks. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. All Vice President 
Pence has to do is send it back to the States 
to recertify, and we become President and 
you are the happiest people. 
This attack, like the tweets he sent 
that morning, had a purpose: con-
vincing his supporters that the future 
of our country, of our democracy, 
hinged on whether Vice President 
Pence would overturn the election— 
something he knew Pence could not 
and would not do. 
He called out Vice President Pence 
nine times that day, and each time, he 
got more forceful. Here is what he said 
at 12:15. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. And we’re going to 
have to fight much harder. And Mike Pence 
is going to have to come through for us. And 
if he doesn’t, that will be a sad day for our 
country, because you are sworn to uphold 
our Constitution. 
Now it is up to Congress to confront this 
egregious assault on our democracy. And 
after this, we are going to walk down—and 
I’ll be there with you. We are going to walk 
down. We are going to walk down any one 
you want, but I think right here, we are 
going to walk down to the Capitol. 
(Cheers and applause.) 
And we are going to cheer on our brave 
Senators and Congressmen and women, and 
we are probably not going to be cheering so 
much for some of them. Because you’ll never 
take back our country with weakness. You 
have to show strength and you have to be 
strong. 
‘‘We’re going to have to fight much 
harder. And Mike Pence will have to 
come through for us.’’ That is what he 
said, and he told the crowd what he 
meant and exactly what to do, literally 
commanding them to confront us at 
the Capitol. He even told them he 
would walk there with them, which, of 
course, was not true, and then he told 
them exactly what to do when they got 
to the Capitol. 
You’ll never take [your] country back with 
weakness. You have to show strength. 
And don’t forget who is standing 
there, the same people Ms. PLASKETT 
described to you, many people vio-
lent—violent people law enforcement 
had warned would be armed and would 
be targeting us. 
One of President Trump’s key de-
fenses focused on what he said for a few 
seconds, 15 minutes into the speech. 
(Text of videotape presentation of 1– 
6–2021.) 
President TRUMP. I know that everyone 
here will soon be marching over to the Cap-
itol building, to peacefully and patriotically 
make your voices heard. 
In a speech spanning almost 11,000 
words—yes, we did check—that was the 
one time, the only time President 
Trump used the word ‘‘peaceful’’ or any 
suggestion of nonviolence. The impli-
cation of the President’s tweets, the 
rally, and the speeches were clear. 
President Trump used the word ‘‘fight’’ 
or ‘‘fighting’’ 20 times, including tell-
ing the crowd they needed to ‘‘fight 
like hell’’ to save our democracy. 
We know how the crowd responded to 
Donald Trump’s words, and he knew 
how they responded to his speech. Here 
is the evidence of how the crowd re-
acted. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
(People cheering.) 
President TRUMP. We are going down to 
the Capitol— 
(People cheering.) 
President TRUMP. . . . weakness, you 
have to show strength— 
Unidentified Speaker. Yes. Right. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Take the Capitol.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Taking the Capitol 
right now.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Invade the Capitol.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Storm the Capitol.’’) 
President 
TRUMP. 
Make 
your 
voices 
heard. 
‘‘Storm the Capitol.’’ ‘‘Invade the 
Capitol.’’ ‘‘Fight, fight, fight.’’ ‘‘Take 
the Capitol right now.’’ These were the 
words of the crowd. Trump was telling 
them to fight, and he would keep tell-
ing them to fight throughout the rest 
of his speech. These are not only words 
of aggression, they are words of insur-
rection, and if you have any doubt, lis-
ten to what he says next. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. Today we see a very 
important event though, because right over 
there, right there, we see the events that 
will take place. And I am going to be watch-
ing, because history is going to be made. We 
are going to see whether or not we have 
great and courageous leaders or whether or 
not we have leaders that should be 
ashamed of themselves throughout his-
tory. Throughout eternity they will be 
ashamed. And you know what? If they 
do the wrong thing, we should never 
ever forget that they did. Never forget. 
We should never ever forget. 
The Commander in Chief points to 
Congress and tells those assembled: ‘‘I 
am going to be watching . . . history is 
going to be made.’’ This was clearly 
not just some rally or march or pro-
test; this was about Donald Trump try-
ing to steal the election for himself, 
claiming that the election was fraudu-
lent, illegitimate, so that his sup-
porters would fight to take it back. In 
fact, after stoking the crowd’s anger 
for nearly 40 minutes, after repeating 
false election conspiracy after false 
election conspiracy, he said this in no 
uncertain terms. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. You will have an ille-
gitimate President, that is what you’ll have. 
Any outcome besides him keeping 
the Presidency would be illegitimate. 
This was building on the big lie of a 
rigged and stolen election. 
And here is what he said a little later 
in his speech. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. When you catch some-
body in a fraud, you are allowed to go by 
very different rules. So I hope Mike has the 
courage to do what he has to do. 
‘‘When you catch somebody in a 
fraud, you are allowed to go by very 
different rules.’’ 
We told you that context matters. 
Here is the context: This was not just 
one reference or a message to sup-
porters by a politician to fight for a 
cause. He had assembled thousands of 
violent people, people he knew were ca-
pable of violence, people he had seen be 
violent. They were standing now in 
front of him. And then he pointed to 
us, lit the fuse, and sent an angry mob 
to fight the perceived enemy—his own 
Vice President and the Members of 
Congress as we certified an election. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. But I said something’s 
wrong here. Something’s really wrong. Can’t 
have happened. And we fight. We fight like 
hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re 
not going to have a country anymore. Our 
exciting adventures and boldest endeavors 
have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, 
for our world, for our children, and for our 
beloved country—and I say this despite all 
that’s happened—the best is yet to come. 
(Cheers and Applause.) 
So we’re going to—we’re going to walk 
down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsyl-
vania Avenue. And we’re going to the Cap-
itol, and we are going to try and give—the 
Democrats are hopeless. They never voted 
for anything—not even one vote. But we are 
going to try and give our Republicans—the 
weak ones, because the strong ones don’t 
need any of our help. We are going to try and 
give them the kind of pride and boldness 
that they need to take back our country. So 
let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. 
(Cheers and Applause.) 
President TRUMP. I want to thank you all. 
God bless you and God bless America. 
Thank you all for being here. This is in-
credible. Thank you very much. 
(Cheers and Applause.) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’) 
‘‘If you don’t fight like hell, you’re 
not going to have a country anymore.’’ 
And there was only one fight left, and 
it was a mile up the road. Donald

Trump, the President of the United 
States, ordered the crowd to march on 
Congress, and so the crowd marched. 
‘‘This is incredible,’’ we heard him say. 
That is how President Trump ended his 
speech. 
I would like to close with a very brief 
timeline of what was happening in par-
allel alongside the President as he 
spoke on the 6th of January. A little 
after noon, President Trump began his 
speech with a fiery refusal to concede. 
He commanded the crowd to fight and 
march down Pennsylvania Avenue, and 
around 12:20, some rally goers, some 
attendees, began marching. 
By 12:30, as President Trump contin-
ued to incite his supporters, large seg-
ments of the rally crowd had amassed 
at the Capitol. 
At 12:53, as the President’s speech 
was playing on cell phone broadcasts, 
the outermost barricades of the north-
west side of the Capitol were breached, 
and Capitol Police were forced back to 
the steps of the Capitol. 
At 1:10, the President ended his 
speech with a final call to fight and a 
final order to march to the Capitol. 
At 1:45, the President’s followers 
surged past Capitol Police, shouting: 
‘‘This is a revolution.’’ 
Just after 2:10, an hour after Presi-
dent Trump ended his speech, the in-
surrectionist mob overwhelmed Capitol 
security and made it inside the Halls of 
Congress, because the truth is, this at-
tack never would have happened but 
for Donald Trump. And so they came, 
draped in Trump’s flag and used our 
flag, the American flag, to batter and 
to bludgeon. 
And at 2:30, I heard that terrifying 
banging on the House Chamber doors. 
For the first time in more than 200 
years, the seat of our government was 
ransacked on our watch. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
I think this would be a good time for a

RECESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Yes. I ask unanimous 
consent that we recess until 4 p.m. 
There being no objection, at 3:43 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 4:08 p.m., 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the President 
pro tempore. 
MANAGERS’ PRESENTATION—CONTINUED 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Could 
we have order in the Senate, please. 
Mr. RASKIN. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. President. 
Members of the Senate, at this point, 
Representatives 
PLASKETT
and 
SWALWELL will take you through the 
actual day of the attack. They will 
recreate the attack as it unfolded, fo-
cusing on the threats to Vice President 
Pence, Speaker PELOSI, the joint ses-
sion, and law enforcement. 
I do want to alert everyone that 
there is some very graphic, violent 
footage coming, so people are aware. 
I am going to call, again, on Ms. 
PLASKETT, who I should also tell you 
went to work at the Department of 
Justice and was the senior counsel for 
Deputy 
Attorney 
General 
Larry 
Thompson 
under 
Attorney 
General 
Ashcroft. So she is a very well trained 
and experienced prosecutor, as you can 
tell. 
Ms. Manager PLASKETT. Mr. Presi-
dent, Senators, almost all of us were 
here on January 6, and we all have our 
individual experiences: what we felt, 
what we saw, what we heard. We have 
seen clips and reports in the media, but 
I have to tell you, it was not until pre-
paring for this trial that I understood 
the full scope and learned the informa-
tion that you are going to see that I 
understood the effort to attack our 
seat of government in order to carry 
out President Trump’s mission to pre-
vent the certification of a Presidential 
election. It was an attack to our Re-
public, to our democratic process. 
My colleagues, Manager SWALWELL, 
and I are going to walk you through 
the attack on the Capitol that day and 
the danger that it posed to the Vice 
President, to the Speaker of the House, 
to you all as Senators, my colleagues 
in the House, Capitol Police, and every-
one who works in and around this Cap-
itol. 
As you have heard, President Trump 
had been telling his supporters and his 
millions of Twitter followers that 
Pence had the ability to secure the 
Presidency for Trump; that Mike Pence 
alone had the power to overturn the 
election results if he would just do it. 
But at 12:55 p.m., on January 6, Vice 
President Pence formally refused the 
President’s demand. 
He wrote, and I quote: 
It is my considered judgment that my oath 
to support and defend the Constitution con-
strains me from claiming unilateral author-
ity to determine which electoral votes 
should be counted and which should not. 
Pence ended his letter with a passage 
including the words: 
I will do my duty. 
Even though the count resulted in 
the defeat of his party and his own can-
didacy, Vice President Pence had the 
courage to stand against the President, 
tell the American public the truth, and 
uphold our Constitution. That is patri-
otism. 
That patriotism is also what put the 
Vice President in so much danger on 
January 6 by the mob sent by our 
President. To the President and the 
mob he incited, that duty to our Con-
stitution was an all-out betrayal, and 
the Vice President was the direct tar-
get of that rage. 
At 12:53 p.m., Senators, Members of 
Congress, Vice President Pence were in 
their respective Chambers. Outside, ri-
oters, including some linked to the 
Proud Boys, broke through the outer 
barricade surrounding the lawn of the 
Capitol. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
(People chanting: ‘‘USA.’’) 
Unidentified Speaker. Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
Hey, hey, hey. 
Unidentified Speaker. Way to go. 
Unidentified Speaker. Break it down. 
Twelve minutes later, Vice President 
Pence began presiding over the joint 
session of Congress to certify the re-
sults of the Presidential election. You 
can see Vice President Pence gaveling 
in the joint session here. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Madam President, 
Members of Congress, pursuant to the Con-
stitution and the laws of the United States, 
the Senate and House of Representatives are 
meeting in joint session to verify the certifi-
cates and count the votes of the electors of 
the several States for President and Vice 
President of the United States. 
While Vice President PENCE presided 
over the joint session, Trump sup-
porters began their assault on our Cap-
itol. Radio communications from the 
Metropolitan Police Department high-
light how, during and following Presi-
dent 
Trump’s 
speech, 
Trump 
sup-
porters descended on the Capitol and 
became increasingly violent. 
What you are about to hear has not 
been made public before. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
The Officer. Multiple Capitol injuries. Mul-
tiple Capitol injuries. 
The Dispatcher. 1318. 
The Officer. Twelve to 50, we’re coming 
around from the south side. 
The Dispatcher. Be advised, the speech has 
ended. 
The Dispatcher. Intel 1, be advised you’ve 
got a group of about 50 up the hill on the 
west front just north of the stairs. They are 
approaching the wall now. 
The Officer. They’re starting to dismantle 
the reviewing stand. They’re throwing metal 
poles at us. 
The Officer. Cruiser 50, give me DSO up 
here now. DSO. Multiple law enforcement in-
juries. DSO, get up here. 
The Officer. All right. We’re 30 seconds out. 
The Officer. We need some reinforcements 
up here now. They’re starting to pull the 
gates down. They’re throwing metal poles at 
us. 
The Officer. Cruiser 50, DSO, get up here. 
The Officer. OK. We’re here. 
The Officer. Twelve to 50, we’re here. 
The Officer. We just had an explosion go on 
up here. I don’t know if they’re fireworks or 
what, but they’re starting to throw explo-
sives, fireworks material. 
After attempting to dismantle the 
outermost perimeter, the rioters did 
everything in their power to storm 
past the police and into the Capitol. 
They coordinated, moving metal barri-
cades the police were using to maintain 
distance. Listen to the yelling of ‘‘pull 
them this way’’ as they grabbed the 
barriers and attacked officers trying to 
hold the line. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Pull. Pull this way. 
Pull forward. 
Unidentified Speaker. No, no, no, no, no. 
No. No. No. No. 
At about 1:10 and 1:23 p.m., respec-
tively, Capitol Police sent out the first 
evacuation alerts of the day, telling 
people to evacuate the Madison Build-
ing and the Cannon Building, respec-
tively. Shortly after, at 1:45 p.m.,

February 10, 2021 
Trump supporters surged past Capitol 
Police protecting the Capitol’s west 
steps, the side that is facing the White 
House. 
In another radio communication be-
tween Metropolitan Police officers, you 
can hear an officer declare that there is 
a riot at the Capitol at 1:49 p.m. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
The Officer. Cruiser 50, we’re going to give 
riot warnings as soon as the LRAD is here. 
We’re going to give riot warnings. We’re 
going to try to get compliance, but this now 
is effectively a riot. 
The Dispatcher. 1349 hours. Declaring it a 
riot. 
The next video, as well as several vid-
eos that follow, have a model of the 
Capitol Complex. The video is from the 
west front of the Capitol on the Senate 
side, the side facing the White House. 
Watch the red dot, which moves up 
the lower steps of the Capitol, indi-
cating the approximate location of the 
rioters as they surge past the police. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. This is our fucking 
house. 
Unidentified Speaker. This is a revolution. 
Unidentified Speaker. Let’s go. Push. 
Unidentified Speaker. Go. Fuck you. Fuck 
you. 
While the mob that Donald Trump 
sent to stop the certification came 
closer and closer to breaching the Cap-
itol, just one floor below where we are 
now, Vice President Pence continued 
to preside over the session in the Sen-
ate Chamber above. 
At about 2:12 p.m., Secret Service 
quickly and suddenly evacuated Vice 
President Pence from the Senate floor. 
Here is the immediate reaction to that 
evacuation. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. No audio. They just 
cut out. It looks like they—and sometimes 
the Senate— 
Unidentified Speaker. It seemed like they 
just ushered MIKE PENCE out really quickly. 
Unidentified Speaker. Yes, they did. That’s 
exactly what just happened there. They ush-
ered Mike Pence out. They moved him fast. 
They were—yeah, I saw the motions too. 
While Vice President Pence was 
being 
evacuated 
from 
the 
Senate 
Chamber, rioters were at that time 
breaking into the Capitol. This next 
video shows their approach and the ini-
tial breach of the Capitol Complex. 
Remember to watch the red dot, 
which 
broke—has 
been 
tracking 
throughout this incident. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Let us in. 
Unidentified Speaker. Let’s go. 
Unidentified Speaker. Break the window, 
bro. 
Now we are going to show you, 
through security footage that has not 
been made public before, what that 
same breach looked like from the in-
side. Now, because this is security foot-
age, there is no sound. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Note, as the video begins, we are see-
ing the inside view as the mob ap-
proaches from outside and beats the 
windows and doors. You can see that 
the rioters first break the window with 
the wooden beam that you saw pre-
viously, and a lone police officer inside 
responds and begins to spray the first 
man who enters but is quickly over-
whelmed. 
I want you to pay attention to the 
first group of assailants as they break 
into the building. The second man 
through the window is wearing full tac-
tical body armor and is carrying a 
baseball bat. Others are carrying riot 
shields. 
Among this group are members of the 
Proud 
Boys—some 
of 
whom, 
like 
Dominic Pezzola, who was recently in-
dicted on Federal conspiracy charges— 
we will discuss later. 
You can watch where they are com-
ing on our model as well. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
When I first saw this model that was 
created for this, I thought back to Sep-
tember 11. I know a lot of you Senators 
were here. Some of you might have 
been Members on the House side. I was 
also here on September 11. I was a 
staffer at that time. My office was on 
the west front of the Capitol. I worked 
in the Capitol, and I was on the House 
side. 
This year is 20 years since the at-
tacks of September 11, and almost 
every day I remember that 44 Ameri-
cans gave their lives to stop the plane 
that was headed to this Capitol Build-
ing. I thank them every day for saving 
my life and the life of so many others. 
Those 
Americans 
sacrificed 
their 
lives for love of country, honor, duty— 
all the things that America means. The 
Capitol stands because of people like 
that—this Capitol that was conceived 
by our Founding Fathers, that was 
built by slaves, that remains through 
the sacrifice of service men and women 
around the world. 
And when I think of that, I think of 
these insurgents, these images, incited 
by our own President of the United 
States, attacking this Capitol to stop 
the certification of a Presidential elec-
tion, our democracy, our Republic. 
At the same time that that breach on 
this Capitol Building occurred, at ap-
proximately 2:13 p.m., just one floor up, 
while Senator LANKFORD was speaking 
on the Senate floor, Senator GRASSLEY, 
who had taken over for Vice President 
Pence, called an unscheduled imme-
diate recess of the Senate. 
A Senate aide approached Senator 
LANKFORD and informed him that the 
Capitol had been breached. Senator 
GRASSLEY is immediately escorted out 
of the Senate Chamber. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Protesters are in the 
building. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Thank you. 
Now, while this was going on, Officer 
Eugene Goodman responded to the ini-
tial breach. You all may have seen 
footage of Officer Goodman previously, 
but there is more to his heroic story. 
In this security footage, you can see 
Officer Goodman running to respond to 
the initial breach. 
(Video presentation of 1–6-2021.) 
Officer Goodman passes Senator MITT 
ROMNEY and directs him to turn around 
in order to get to safety. On the first 
floor, just beneath them, the mob had 
already started to search for the Sen-
ate Chamber. 
Officer Goodman made his way down 
to the first floor, where he encountered 
the same insurrectionists we just saw— 
watched—breach the Capitol. In this 
video, we can see the rioters surge to-
ward Officer Goodman. Recall that the 
rioters are in red, and Officer Good-
man, in this model, is in blue. Watch 
Officer Goodman, who backs up the 
stairs. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
(People chanting: ‘‘USA.’’) 
Unidentified Speaker. That’s my muffin. I 
paid for that. 
Unidentified Speaker. You work for us. 
Unidentified Speaker. Where is the meet-
ing at? 
Unidentified Speaker. Hey, where do they 
count the fucking votes? 
Unidentified Speaker. Hey! Hey! 
Unidentified Speaker. Do it! Do it! 
Unidentified Speaker. Where are they 
counting the votes? Where are they counting 
the votes? 
Unidentified Speaker. Right there. Hey. 
Unidentified Speaker. These people. These 
people. These people. We have no weapons. 
We have no fucking weapons. 
Unidentified Speaker. No, no. 
Unidentified Speaker. Motherfucker. 
Although they were shouting that 
they did not have any weapons, we 
know from the earlier video that that 
is not true. The second assailant 
through that breach was the one car-
rying a metal baseball bat. We know 
there were other weapons there that 
day. 
Did you hear the other shouts? 
We’re here for you. He’s one person, we’re 
thousands. 
And— 
Where do they count the votes? 
They were coming at the urging of 
Donald Trump to keep Congress—a sep-
arate branch of government—from cer-
tifying the results of a Presidential 
election. 
As the rioters reached the top of the 
stairs, they were within 100 feet of 
where the Vice President was shel-
tering with his family. And they were 
just feet away from one of the doors to 
this Chamber, where many of you re-
mained at that time. 
I also want to show you a different 
angle from the security footage of Offi-
cer Goodman’s acts. This video is on 
the second floor of the Senate wing of 
the Capitol. The red dot, as you recall, 
represents the insurrectionists. The 
blue dot is Officer Goodman, who led 
the mob away from the Chamber, just 
minutes earlier. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
On the left-hand side of the video, 
just inside the hallway is the door to

the Senate Chamber. And watch how 
Officer Goodman provoked the rioters 
and purposefully draws them away 
from the door to the Senate Chamber 
and toward the other officers waiting 
down the hall. 
The rioter seen carrying a baseball 
bat in this video is the same one we 
saw moments ago breaching the win-
dow on the first floor. 
While all of this was going on, Vice 
President Pence was still in the room 
near the Senate Chamber. It was not 
until 2:26 that he was evacuated to a 
secure location. This next security 
video shows that evacuation. 
His movements are depicted by the 
orange dot in our model. The red and 
blue dots represent the location where 
the mob and Officer Goodman were and 
where Officer Goodman led the mob 
away from the Chamber just moments 
ago. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
You can see Vice President Pence 
and his family quickly moved down the 
stairs. The Vice President turns around 
briefly as he is headed down. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
As Pence was being evacuated, riot-
ers started to spread throughout the 
Capitol. Those inside helped other riot-
ers break in through doors in several 
locations around this entire building. 
And the mob was looking for Vice 
President Pence because of his patriot-
ism, because the Vice President had re-
fused to do what the President de-
manded and overturn the election re-
sults. 
During the assault on the Capitol, ex-
tremists reportedly coordinated online 
and discussed how they could hunt 
down the Vice President. 
Journalists in the Capitol reported 
they heard rioters say they were look-
ing for Pence in order to execute him. 
Trump’s supporters had erected a 
gallows on the lawn in front of the Cap-
itol Building. Another group of rioters 
chanted: ‘‘Hang Mike Pence,’’ as they 
stood in the open door of the Capitol 
Building. 
You can hear the security alarm 
through the door in the background. 
And you can hear the mob calling for 
the death of the Vice President of the 
United States. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Hang Mike Pence.’’) 
This wasn’t an isolated area or inci-
dent where that was being told, where 
that was being said. It was going on ev-
erywhere. 
Here is another example of the crowd 
outside yelling: ‘‘Bring out Pence, 
bring him out.’’ 
(People chanting: ‘‘Bring him out.’’) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Bring out Pence.’’) 
After President Trump had primed 
his followers for months and inflamed 
the rally-goers that morning, it is no 
wonder that the Vice President of the 
United States was the target of their 
wrath after Pence refused to overturn 
the election results. 
Listen to this man explain. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified 
Speaker. 
While 
Congress, 
cowards, hid in their—inside, and were es-
corted away because of fear of the people. Of 
course they are cowards. They can’t face the 
people. They can’t do the right thing. Pence 
lied to us. He is a total treasonous pig. And 
his name will be mud forever. Now the real 
battle begins. And it looks like the American 
people are very pissed. So good luck with 
that. Peace out. 
‘‘Peace out.’’ 
Several 
insurrectionists 
described 
what they had planned to do if they en-
countered the Vice President or other 
lawmakers. One of them, Dominic 
Pezzola, also known as Spaz, is a mem-
ber of the Proud Boys, as we discussed. 
Pezzola came to the Capitol on Janu-
ary 6 with deadly intentions. He com-
mandeered a Capitol Police shield, used 
it to smash a glass window, entered the 
Capitol, and paved the way for dozens 
of insurrectionists. 
As you recall from an earlier video, 
Pezzola was one of the first wave of ri-
oters to breach the building. On the 
left, you can see a screen shot from the 
video of the break-in we showed ear-
lier. And on the right, you can see 
Pezzola in the mob chase Capitol Po-
lice Officer Eugene Goodman through 
the building. Pezzola is the man in the 
center of the photo with the gray 
beard. 
Pezzola has since been charged with 
eight Federal crimes for his conduct 
related to January 6. According to an 
FBI Agent’s affidavit submitted to the 
court, the group that was with him 
during the sack of the Capitol con-
firmed that they were out to murder 
‘‘anyone they got their hands on.’’ 
Here is what the FBI said: 
Other members of the group talked about 
things they had done that day, and they said 
that anyone they got their hands on they 
would have killed, including NANCY PELOSI. 
And, I quote: 
[T]hey would have killed [Vice President] 
Mike Pence if given the chance. 
They were talking about assassi-
nating the Vice President of the United 
States. During the course of the at-
tack, the Vice President never left the 
Capitol, remained locked down with his 
family—with his family—inside the 
building. Remember that as you think 
about these images and the sounds of 
the attack. 
The Vice President, our second in 
command, was always at the center of 
it. Vice President Pence was threat-
ened with death by the President’s sup-
porters because he rejected President 
Trump’s demand that he overturn the 
election. 
The mob also went after the Speaker 
of the House, who alongside the Vice 
President, was presiding over the joint 
session of the certification in the 
House Chamber. 
The chilling evidence shows that on 
January 6, armed and organized insur-
rectionists trained their sights on 
Speaker PELOSI. They sought out the 
Speaker on the floor and in her office, 
publicly declared their intent to harm 
or kill her, ransacked her office, and 
terrorized her staff. And they did it be-
cause Donald Trump sent them on this 
mission. 
As the insurrectionists got closer, 
Capitol Police rushed the Speaker from 
the House floor at 2:15 p.m., mere min-
utes 
after 
the 
Capitol 
was 
first 
breached. 
They 
recognized 
imme-
diately that she was in danger. The 
Speaker was not just rushed from the 
floor; the Capitol Police deemed the 
threat so dangerous that they evacu-
ated her entirely from the Capitol 
Complex, rushing her to a secure off-
site location. 
The insurrectionists’ intent to mur-
der the Speaker of the House is well 
documented in charging documents 
that are now available. We know from 
the rioters themselves that if they had 
found Speaker PELOSI, they would have 
killed her. 
I have already discussed Proud Boys 
member Dominic Pezzola, who has 
since been charged with eight Federal 
crimes for his conduct on January 6. As 
you will recall, according to the FBI 
agent’s affidavit submitted to the 
court, the group he attacked the Cap-
itol with confirmed that ‘‘anyone they 
got their hands on they would have 
killed, including NANCY PELOSI.’’ 
William Calhoun, a lawyer, from 
Georgia, also participated in the insur-
rection that day. And he, too, has been 
charged for his actions. This insurrec-
tionist detailed his criminal activity at 
the Capitol online. Calhoun wrote 
about his involvement on his own 
Facebook page. 
Here is the post. Calhoun stated: 
And get this—the first of us who got up-
stairs kicked in Nancy Pelosi’s door and 
pushed down the hall towards her inner sanc-
tum, the mob howling with rage—Crazy 
NANCY probably would have been torn into 
little pieces, but she was nowhere to be seen. 
‘‘Crazy NANCY’’—that is Trump’s nickname 
for the Speaker of the House. Then he ex-
plains that he and his group only abandoned 
their claim to the Speaker’s office when ‘‘a 
SWAT team showed up.’’ 
He writes: 
Then a SWAT team showed and we re-
treated back to the rotunda and continued 
our hostile takeover of the Capitol Building. 
‘‘Retreated,’’ ‘‘hostile takeover.’’ He 
is using military terms for this attack. 
The mob continued to look for NANCY 
PELOSI throughout the time they occu-
pied the Capitol, including invading 
her offices. 
Watch now how the mob searches for 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s 
office, 
which 
is 
marked in red, and the House Chamber 
itself. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Where are you, 
Nancy? We are looking for you? 
Unidentified Speaker. Nancy! Oh, Nancy! 
Nancy! Where are you, Nancy? 
During the siege, the Speaker’s staff 
took cover in her office, hiding in fear 
for their lives for hours, as rioters 
broke in and ransacked her office.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S636 
February 10, 2021 
As the rioters were breaking into the 
Capitol, her staff retreated into an in-
terior room. Eight of them gathered in 
a conference room. About the same 
time, Capitol Police announced the 
Capitol had been breached, Speaker 
PELOSI’s staff heeded the call to shelter 
in place. 
On our model, you can see the rioters 
in the Rotunda in red and the Speak-
er’s office, again, in orange. 
This is a security video, so there is 
no sound. 
(Video presentation.) 
As you can see, the staff moves from 
their offices through the halls and then 
enters a door on the right-hand side. 
That is the outer door of a conference 
room, which also has an inner door 
that they barricaded with furniture. 
The staff then hid under a conference 
room table in that inner room. This is 
the last staffer going in and then barri-
cading themselves inside the inner of-
fice. 
After just 7 minutes of them barri-
cading themselves and the last staffer 
entering the door on the right, a group 
of rioters entered the hallway outside 
and, once inside, the rioters have free 
rein in the Speaker of the House’s of-
fices. 
In this security video, pay attention 
to the door that we saw those staffers 
leaning into and going into. 
(Video presentation.) 
One of the rioters, you can see, is 
throwing his body against the door 
three times until he breaks open that 
outer door. Luckily, when faced with 
the inner door, he moves on. Another 
rioter later tried unsuccessfully to 
break through that inner door. At this 
point, the mob had already broken into 
the Speaker’s formal conference room 
that is in the back of the hall at the 
top of the video. 
I want to play some audio we have of 
the Speaker’s staff with the rioters at 
the door that day. You can hear the 
terror in their voices as they describe 
what is happening to them as they are 
barricaded in that conference room. 
Please listen carefully because the 
staffer is whispering into a phone as he 
hides from the rioters that are outside 
the door. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Unidentified Speaker. They’re in the hall. 
We need the Capitol Police to come into the 
hallway. They’re pounding on doors trying to 
find her now. 
You can hear the pounding in the 
background as that staffer is speaking. 
One of those staffers explained later 
that they could hear the mob going 
through her offices, breaking down the 
door and yelling: Where are you, 
Nancy? 
The mob also pillaged and vandalized 
the Speaker’s office and documented 
their crimes on social media. They 
stole objects, desecrated the office of 
the Speaker of the House of Represent-
atives of the United States. 
As you can see in these photos, riot-
ers broke down a door. They also shat-
tered a mirror. At 2:50 p.m., several ri-
oters, 
including 
Richard 
‘‘Bigo’’ 
Barnett, entered Speaker PELOSI’s of-
fice. The world is all now too familiar 
with the images from these slides. If 
you look closely, however, at the now- 
infamous pictures of Barnett with his 
feet on the desk, you might see some-
thing that you didn’t notice pre-
viously. Here is a better look. As this 
photo highlights, he is carrying a stun 
gun tucked into his waistband. The 
FBI identified the device as a 950,000- 
volt stun gun walking stick. The weap-
on could have caused serious pain and 
incapacitated anyone Barnett had used 
it against. 
Richard Barnett bragged about his 
actions. He was proud of the way he 
desecrated the Speaker of the House’s 
office. He left a note: 
WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN. 
Here is Barnett in his own words. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Unidentified Man. Where’d you get it? 
Mr. BARNETT. I didn’t steal it. I bled on 
it. And they were fucking macing me, and I 
couldn’t fucking see. And so I figure: Well, 
I’m in her office. I got blood in her office. I 
put a quarter on her desk even though she 
ain’t fucking worth it. And I left her a note 
on her desk that says: Nancy, Bigo was here, 
you bitch. 
Trump’s mob ransacked the Speaker 
of the House’s office. They terrorized 
her staff. Again, that is a mob that was 
sent by the President of the United 
States to stop the certification of an 
election. 
The Vice President, the Speaker of 
the House—the first and second in line 
to the Presidency—were performing 
their constitutional duties, presiding 
over the election certification. And 
they were put in danger because Presi-
dent Trump put his own desires—his 
own need for power—over his duty to 
the Constitution and our democratic 
process. President Trump put a target 
on their backs, and his mob broke into 
the Capitol to hunt them down. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
The Officer. We’re talking projectiles. 
Let’s go. We need units outside on the ter-
race ASAP. We need units. We’re surrounded. 
The Officer. Cruiser 50, they’ve breached 
the scaffolds. Let Capitol know they have 
breached the scaffolds. They are behind our 
lines. 
Mr. Manager SWALWELL. Shortly 
after 2 p.m., the Capitol Police and 
Metropolitan Police were overwhelmed 
by President Trump’s mob. Perimeters 
were broken. The Capitol had been 
breached. Those officers kept fighting 
back for hours and hours to hold the 
line. They fought to defend the Capitol 
Building and all of us within it. 
But they weren’t there just to pro-
tect us—and they did—and our staff 
and the custodial staff and all the peo-
ple who work so hard in this building. 
They were there to protect the votes of 
the American people that were being 
counted that day. I will show you more 
later about what that day was like for 
those brave officers. 
But first, let’s go back to what was 
happening where Manager PLASKETT 
left off in the House Chamber. Rioters 
who had entered the building through 
the Senate quickly spread out through 
the Capitol. Many headed toward the 
House and Senate Chambers. After 
Speaker PELOSI was ushered out, Chair-
man MCGOVERN was presiding in the 
House, attempting to keep the count-
ing process going. 
On our phones, Members were receiv-
ing security updates and watching so-
cial media to see the horror that was 
going on outside. We never thought it 
would make its way in. 
By 2:25 p.m., rioters who were already 
in the building opened the east side 
doors of the Capitol Rotunda to let 
more of the mob in. They quickly 
flooded 
through 
the 
doors, 
over-
whelming the officers. 
This is new security footage of those 
doors, and, as before, the mob is identi-
fied with the red dot on the model of 
the Capitol. If you look closely, you 
will see the first person through the 
door is holding the Trump flag. 
(Video presentation.) 
At the same time, just one floor 
below, the mob finally pushed through 
a line of Capitol Police officers and 
overtook the area. We all know that 
area in the Capitol as the Crypt. This 
is directly beneath the Rotunda at the 
very center of the Capitol. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Open up.’’) 
The Officer. No harm. No harm. 
Inside the House Chamber, a security 
officer suspended the floor debate to 
update Members. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
The Officer. We have a person with tear gas 
in the Rotunda. Please stand by. There are 
masks under your seats. Please grab a mask. 
Place it in your lap, and be prepared to don 
your mask in the event the room is 
breached. 
We were told there were tear gas 
masks underneath our seats and to be 
prepared to grab them. 
Determined to keep the count going, 
Chairman MCGOVERN called the House 
back into session, but only 4 minutes 
later, at 2:30 p.m., the House abruptly 
recessed. A new security announce-
ment was made. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
The Officer. Be prepared to get down under 
your chairs, if necessary. So we have folks 
entering the Rotunda and coming down this 
way. So we will update you as soon as we 
can, but just be prepared. Stay calm. 
As I heard that announcement on the 
floor, I saw the new House Chaplain, on 
just her fourth day on the job, walk to 
the front podium unannounced, and, 
amidst the chaos, she started to recite 
a prayer for peace. 
Uncertain what would happen next, I 
sent a text message to my wife: 
I love you and the babies, please hug them 
for me. 
I imagine many of you sent a similar 
message. 
What we could not see from inside 
the Chamber was that outside, the mob 
was growing larger and larger and ap-
proaching our doors. But we could hear 
them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S637 
February 10, 2021 
This security footage, which does not 
have sound, shows a closeup of Trump’s 
mob as they move toward the second 
floor of the House Chamber to stop the 
counting of votes. 
(Video presentation.) 
In the back of the group, you see one 
individual carrying a ‘‘Stop the Steal’’ 
sign. They get within footsteps of the 
House door. 
The next video is the viewpoint of 
the insurrectionists. It begins with the 
mob amassing and cuts ahead to show 
you their search to the House door. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
(People chanting: ‘‘We want Trump.’’) 
Unidentified Man. It’s a mob. They’re 
going. Just stop. Whoa, whoa. Dude, dude, 
dude, dude—you’re not helping. You’re not 
helping. You are going to get me hurt and 
other people. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Stop the steal.’’) 
Unidentified Man. All right, no violence. 
Unidentified Man. It’s too late for that. 
They don’t listen without that stuff. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Stop the steal.’’) 
Those doors, to orient you at home, 
are the doors that the President of the 
United States walks through when he 
or she gives the State of the Union Ad-
dress. 
You may have heard one man yell 
‘‘no violence’’ and another respond: 
It’s too late for that. They don’t listen 
without that. 
They were there to stop the certifi-
cation of the election. 
At this point, inside the House Cham-
ber, we can now hear the pounding on 
the doors. At 2:35 p.m., Members on the 
House floor were told that an evacu-
ation route was secure, and it was time 
to leave. This video shows Members of 
Congress exiting to the side of the po-
dium where we would go through the 
House Lobby and downstairs. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Because of coronavirus restrictions, 
congressional Members had been wait-
ing in the Gallery for their time to 
speak, just one level above the House 
floor. Representatives, staff, journal-
ists all took cover under their chairs, 
helped each other put on their gas 
masks, and held hands as rioters gath-
ered outside. 
Here, on this slide, you see Rep-
resentative JASON CROW comforting our 
colleague Representative SUSAN WILD. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
The rioters continued to surround 
the House Chamber, flooding the halls 
and kicking on the doors as they 
passed them. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
This security video shows Ashli Bab-
bitt, followed by others in the mob, 
turning the corner to the House Lobby 
doors where the Members were leaving. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Chairman MCGOVERN was one of the 
last Members to leave the floor. As he 
left through the House Lobby, just 
after 2:40 p.m., he was spotted by the 
mob. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Minutes later, at 2:44 p.m., Ashli Bab-
bitt attempted to climb through a 
shattered 
window 
into 
the 
House 
Lobby. To protect the Members in the 
Lobby, an officer discharged his weap-
on, and she was killed. I want to warn 
everyone that the next video, which 
shows her death, is graphic. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
He has a gun! He has a gun! He’s got a gun! 
Inside the Chamber, Representatives, 
staff, and journalists remained trapped 
in the Gallery, one floor above the 
House floor, and heard the gunshot. My 
colleague Representative DAN KILDEE 
produced this recording. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
What the fuck? Take your pins off. Pins 
off! 
Out of fear that they would be seen 
or taken by the mob, my colleagues 
were telling each other to take off 
their congressional pins. That buzzing 
sound that you hear in the background 
of these videos was the sound of the gas 
masks. 
It was not until approximately 2:50 
p.m., about 6 minutes after the shoot-
ing downstairs, that the remaining 
Members, staff, and journalists in the 
Gallery were finally able to flee. 
In this security footage video, you 
can see them exiting. Many Members 
are still wearing their gas masks. They 
walk just feet away from where the 
Capitol Police are holding an insurrec-
tionist at gunpoint. Just minutes ear-
lier, that insurrectionist had tried to 
open the Gallery door and, thankfully, 
was stopped by a tactical team. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Although Members were now being 
moved to another location, the mob 
continued to fight—to stop the count, 
to find the Members, to engage with 
the police. The building was not yet se-
cure. 
This security video from 2:56 p.m. 
shows the mob in the House of Rep-
resentatives’ wing on the second floor 
of the Capitol. Insurrectionists who are 
still inside the building are fighting 
with the police, who are overwhelmed 
in trying to get them out. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Throughout this presentation, we 
have been very careful to not share 
where Members of Congress were taken 
or the paths they followed to get out 
and off the floor, but that very issue 
was under discussion by the insurrec-
tionists 
themselves. 
One 
example 
comes from an FBI affidavit, which 
stated that a leader of a militia group 
known as the Oath Keepers received 
messages while he was at the Capitol. 
The leader was given directions to 
where Representatives were thought to 
be sheltering and instructions to ‘‘turn 
on gas; seal them in.’’ 
As you know, the threat to the Sen-
ate was no less than that of the Mem-
bers of the House. The mob approached 
the Senate with the same purpose: ful-
filling President Trump’s goal of stop-
ping the count; delaying the certifi-
cation of the electoral college votes of 
the American people. 
As 
you 
heard 
from 
Manager 
PLASKETT, Vice President Pence was 
moved away from the area near the 
Senate Chamber at around 2:25 p.m. By 
that time, rioters had breached several 
areas close to this Chamber, and they 
were flooding the hallways just outside 
and nearby. The Senate Chamber was 
not evacuated until 2:30 p.m. The mob 
had been in the building for more than 
15 minutes. 
This new security footage of the Sen-
ators and staff leaving the Chamber 
will be displayed on the screens. It is 
silent. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
You cannot see it in this footage, but 
quick-thinking 
Senate 
floor 
staff 
grabbed and protected the electoral 
ballots that the mob was after. 
Those of you who were here that day 
will recall that, once you left the Sen-
ate floor, you moved through a hallway 
to get to safety. That hallway was near 
where Officer Goodman had encoun-
tered a mob and led them upstairs and 
away from the Senate Chamber. You 
know how close you came to the mob. 
Some of you, I understand, could hear 
them, but most of the public does not 
know how close these rioters came to 
you. As you were moving through that 
hallway—I paced it off—you were just 
58 steps away from where the mob was 
amassing and where police were rush-
ing to stop them. They were yelling. 
In this security video, you can see 
how the Capitol Police created a line 
and blocked the hallway with their 
bodies to prevent rioters at the end of 
the hall from reaching you and your 
staff. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Because this is security footage that 
you have not seen before, I want to 
play it again. The top of the screen is 
the other end of that hallway where 
the mob has amassed and the officers 
are rushing to protect you. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Additional security footage shows 
how Leader SCHUMER and the members 
of his protective detail had a near miss 
with the mob. They came within just 
yards of rioters and had to turn 
around. Here, in this new video, you 
see Leader SCHUMER
walking up a 
ramp. In going up the ramp with his 
detail, he will soon go out of view. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Seconds later, they return and run 
back down the hallway, and officers 
immediately shut the door and use 
their bodies to keep them safe. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
At 2:45 p.m., shortly after Senators 
were ushered to safety from the Senate 
floor, insurrectionists reached the Sen-
ate Galleries. The following video was 
filmed by a New Yorker reporter. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Where the fuck are they? We’re here. 
Minutes later, the insurrectionists 
invaded and desecrated the Senate 
floor. These vandals shouted and rifled 
through the desks of this room. They 
took pictures of documents and of

themselves, celebrating that they had 
taken over the floor and stopped the 
counting of the electoral college votes. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Look at this. Take a 
picture. 
Unidentified Speaker. Here. Look. TED 
CRUZ’s objections. He was going to sell us 
out all along. 
Unidentified Speaker. Really? 
Unidentified Speaker. Objection to count-
ing the electoral votes of the State of Ari-
zona. 
Unidentified Speaker. All right. All right. 
There’s got to be something in here we can 
use against these scum bags. 
Unidentified Speaker. What happened to 
the phone, man? 
Larry Brock, who was arrested for 
his role in the insurrection, was photo-
graphed on the Senate floor, wearing a 
helmet, tactical gear, and carrying flex 
cuffs. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
This man, also in the Senate Gal-
leries, is Eric Munchel. Like Brock, he 
was dressed in what appears to be tac-
tical gear, also holding up flex cuffs. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
If the doors to this Chamber had been 
breached just minutes earlier, imagine 
what they could have done with those 
cuffs. 
After insurrectionists occupied the 
Capitol and stopped the joint session 
from counting the votes, the Capitol 
was in lockdown for 5 hours. 
As long as it took to get back to the 
Capitol, to get back to the certifi-
cation of the election, it could have 
been so much longer, or we might not 
have been able to resume at all. As hor-
rific as it was—140 officers injured, 3 of-
ficers who ultimately lost their lives— 
we all know that awful day could have 
been so much worse. The only reason it 
was not was because of the extraor-
dinary bravery of the men and women 
of the Capitol Police and the Metro-
politan Police Departments. For hours 
and hours, these insurrectionists were 
in hand-to-hand combat with these 
brave men and women. 
Like some of you, I come from a law 
enforcement family. My dad was a cop. 
My two brothers—my little brothers 
are cops who walk the beat today. I am 
proud of them. And like in every law 
enforcement family, when we hang up 
the phone, we don’t only say ‘‘I love 
you,’’ we say ‘‘Be safe.’’ 
So let’s focus now on the attack and 
what it was like for the officers defend-
ing the Capitol that day. And, again, I 
want to warn you that the following 
audio and videos are graphic and are 
unsettling, but it is important that we 
understand the extent of what oc-
curred. 
Here is an audio recording from the 
radio traffic of the DC Metropolitan 
Police Department describing the vio-
lence. 
(Text of audio presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Cruiser 50, I copy. We’re still talking 
rocks, bottles, and pieces of flag and metal 
pole. 
Cruiser 50, the crowd is using munitions 
against us. They have bear spray in the 
crowd. Bear spray in the crowd. 
1328. 
Multiple deployments U.S. Capitol with 
pepper spray. 
DSO, DSO, I need a re-up. I need a re-up up 
here. 
You hear the officer describe they are 
‘‘using munitions’’—they, the rioters, 
are ‘‘using munitions against us.’’ 
This video shows how the sprays that 
were described were used against the 
officers. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
In a separate Metropolitan Police De-
partment radio traffic recording, you 
can hear an officer when he realizes 
that the insurrectionists had over-
taken the police line. 
(Text of audio presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Cruiser 50. We lost the line. We’ve lost the 
line. All MPD, pull back. All MPD, pull back 
up to the upper deck. All MPD, pull back to 
the upper deck ASAP. All MPD, come back 
to the upper deck. Upper deck. Cruiser 50, 
we’re flanked. 10–33. I repeat 10–33 west front 
of the Capitol. We have been flanked and 
we’ve lost the line. 
The MPD officer calls out ‘‘10–33.’’ 
That is the code for emergency, officer 
in need of assistance; his words, ‘‘We’ve 
lost the line.’’ 
Hours after Members of the House 
and Senate had left this area on the 
west front of the building, the mob 
continued to grow, continued to beat 
the officers, as they tried to get in. 
In this new security video, you can 
see the mob attacking officers with a 
crutch, a hockey stick, a bull horn, and 
a Trump flag. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
I want to show you that same attack 
from the officer’s perspective, from his 
body camera footage. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
This body camera footage is from 4:27 
p.m., over 2 hours from when the Cap-
itol was first breached. The attack on 
police that afternoon was constant. 
Metropolitan Police Officer Michael 
Fanone, a 20-year police veteran with 
four daughters, was part of a line of of-
ficers protecting the Capitol. He was 
one of three officers whom the mob 
dragged down the stairs. When they 
dragged him, they stole his badge, his 
radio, his ammunition magazine, and 
they tased him, triggered a heart at-
tack. 
Here he describes his experience. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Officer Fanone. It looked like a medieval 
battle scene. It was some of the most brutal 
combat, you know, I have ever—ever encoun-
tered. At one point I got tased. People were 
yelling at me, ‘We got one. We got one.’ 
Officer Christina Laury, who regu-
larly serves in MPD’s Narcotics and 
Specialized Investigation Division, also 
protected the front Capitol entrance. 
Here is her experience. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Officer Laury. I mean, I can’t say enough 
about the officers that were there, the offi-
cers that were on the frontline. And when I 
say ‘the frontline,’ I mean, literally, officers 
that were in a line, stopping these people 
that were beating them with metal poles. 
They were spraying them with bear mace. I 
mean, they did everything in their power to 
not let those people in. And this was going 
on for hours. 
Around 4:30 p.m., hours into the Cap-
itol riots, Officer Daniel Hodges was 
protecting a west side Capitol en-
trance, when rioters who were trying 
to stop the certification trapped him 
between two doors. 
When Officer Hodges was interviewed 
later, this is how he described what 
was happening. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Officer Hodges. They threw down a huge 
metal object that hit me on the head. I was 
also knocked down. The medical mask I was 
wearing at the time got pulled up over my 
eyes, so I was on the ground and blinded, and 
they started attacking me from all sides. 
Rioters crushed Officer Hodges. He 
was wedged in the doorway, blood drip-
ping from his mouth. He was struggling 
to breathe, all while the insurrection-
ists hit him. 
Officer Hodges’ experience reminds 
you of what he and many other officers 
experienced that day, what they went 
through. 
We are also reminded of three offi-
cers who lost their lives: Capitol Hill 
Police Officers Sicknick, Liebengood, 
and Metropolitan Police Officer Smith. 
In many law enforcement families, 
we pray for our loved ones, and we 
know the scripture of Matthew 5:9, 
‘‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they 
shall be called the children of God.’’ 
I am sorry I have to show you the 
next video, but in it you will see how 
blessed we were that on that hellish 
day, we had a peacemaker like Officer 
Hodges protecting our lives, our staffs’ 
lives, this Capitol, and the certifi-
cation process. 
May we do all we can in this Cham-
ber to make sure that never happens 
again. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
RECESS 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we 
will now have a recess for dinner, and 
we will resume at 6:15. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the Senate stands 
in recess until 6:15 p.m. 
Thereupon, the Senate, at 5:25 p.m., 
recessed until 6:15 p.m. and reassem-
bled at 6:28 p.m., when called to order 
by the President pro tempore. 
MANAGERS’ PRESENTATION—CONTINUED 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. 
RASKIN. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
distinguished Members of the Senate, 
Managers CICILLINE and CASTRO will 
now remind us of what President 
Trump was doing during the attack. 
They will show how he continued to 
stoke the insurrection and refused to 
speak out against the violence or do 
anything to stop it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S639 
February 10, 2021 
Mr. CICILLINE. 
Mr. Manager CICILLINE. Mr. Presi-
dent, distinguished Senators, you just 
heard from my colleagues about the 
harrowing events that happened here 
at the Capitol on January 6 and saw 
that very disturbing video, and now I 
would like to turn your attention to 
what was happening on the other end 
of Pennsylvania Avenue at the White 
House. 
The truth is, the facts are that on 
January 6, Donald Trump did not once 
condemn this attack. He did not once 
condemn the attackers. In fact, on Jan-
uary 6, the only person he condemned 
was his own Vice President, Mike 
Pence, who was hiding in this building 
with his family in fear for his life. 
In the first crucial hours of this vio-
lent attack, he did nothing to stop it, 
nothing to help us. 
By all accounts, from the people that 
were around him, he was delighted. 
And here is the last thing Donald 
Trump said that day, and you might 
remember this from my motions pres-
entation earlier in the week. 
At 6 p.m. on January 6, after all the 
destruction that you just saw, Capitol 
Police and the National Guard fighting 
to secure this building, here is what 
Donald Trump tweeted: 
These are the things and events that hap-
pen when a sacred landslide election victory 
is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped 
away from great patriots who have been 
badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go 
home with love & in peace. Remember this 
day forever! 
He got what he incited, and accord-
ing to Donald Trump, we got what we 
deserve. Donald Trump’s incitement of 
this insurrection, including his derelic-
tion of his duty as Commander in Chief 
to defend the Capitol and the people in 
it, his complete refusal to condemn the 
attack while it was going on, and his 
continuing to incite the violence dur-
ing the attack require impeachment. 
Now, let’s turn to then-President 
Trump’s conduct that day. I want to 
start at the beginning, when he ad-
dressed his thousands of great patriots, 
as 
he 
called 
them 
that 
morning. 
Around noon, Donald Trump began 
speaking at his rally just down Penn-
sylvania Avenue. Even before Donald 
Trump finished speaking, his sup-
porters began to walk down toward the 
Capitol, and they were already starting 
to chant ‘‘stop the steal’’ and ‘‘storm 
the Capitol’’ and ‘‘invade the Capitol’’ 
and ‘‘fight for Trump.’’ 
And by 12:53 p.m., they had violently 
forced their way through the barri-
cades here at the Capitol. Now, about 1 
o’clock that day, with this chaos just 
starting, Speaker PELOSI, as the Con-
stitution 
requires, 
formally 
com-
menced the process by which this 
Chamber certifies election results. 
Within 10 minutes, at 1:11 p.m., as if 
almost on cue, Donald Trump con-
cluded his speech with his final re-
minder to the thousands gathered 
there: It was time to go to the Capitol. 
Let’s watch. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. We’re going to the Cap-
itol, and we’re going to try and give—and 
we’re going to try and give our Repub-
licans—the weak ones because the strong 
ones don’t need any of our help—we’re going 
to try and give them the kind of pride and 
boldness that they need to take back our 
country. 
So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. 
I want to thank you all. God bless you, and 
God bless America. 
Thank you all for being here. This is in-
credible. Thank you very much. 
(People chanting: ‘‘Fight for Trump.’’) 
Now, you have seen what happened 
when these supporters, following his 
orders, arrived here at the Capitol. But 
we want to look at what happened 
next. Now, you will recall, during the 
speech, President Trump said, ‘‘We’re 
going to the Capitol,’’ sort of sug-
gesting he was going to go with this 
crowd. Of course, that was not true. 
But let’s hear what he said. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. Now it is up to Con-
gress to confront this egregious assault on 
our democracy. And after this, we’re going 
to walk down, and I’ll be there with you. 
We’re going to walk down. We’re going to 
walk down. 
Any one you want, but I think right here. 
We’re going to walk down to the Capitol. 
This, of course, was not true. He did 
not go with them to the Capitol. He 
left and went back to the White House, 
and while he was en route to the White 
House, violence began to grow here at 
the Capitol. 
And 
within 
minutes 
of 
Donald 
Trump’s speech ending, there were sig-
nificant reports of escalating violence 
that began to surface. Buildings around 
the Capitol were starting to be evacu-
ated, and by 1:15, an explosive device 
had been found at the DNC, and a pipe 
bomb had been found at the RNC about 
15 minutes earlier. The House Sergeant 
at Arms had called for immediate as-
sistance. At 1:34 p.m., the mayor of 
Washington, DC, called for additional 
National Guard troops. 
I won’t go through all of the details 
of violence that unfolded here. You just 
saw that. But as we walk through what 
our Commander in Chief did that day, 
I want to be very clear about exactly 
what was happening here at the same 
time. 
For 40 minutes, while buildings were 
being cleared, pipe bombs were being 
found, and his supporters were literally 
breaching the perimeter of the Capitol 
and overwhelming law enforcement. 
You saw the violence that was occur-
ring. We heard nothing from the Presi-
dent of the United States. We didn’t 
hear anything from Donald Trump 
until 1:49 p.m., when, while all of this 
is unfolding, President Trump sent out 
a tweet. 
This was the first thing he did when 
he learned the U.S. Capitol, with all 
the Members of Congress and his own 
Vice President, was under violent at-
tack. What was that tweet? Nearly an 
hour after the rioters breached the 
Capitol 
perimeter 
at 
1:49, 
Donald 
Trump released a propaganda reel of 
his ‘‘Save America’’ speech that he had 
given an hour before. 
I want to be clear. The events I just 
described—the rioters breaching the 
Capitol, attacking law enforcement, 
the violence that is being broadcast all 
over the television for the whole world 
to see, including the President of the 
United States—I want to show you: 
This is what is happening right before 
Donald Trump sends that video out 
again and as he does it. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
President TRUMP. Our country has had 
enough. We will not take it anymore and 
that’s what this is all about. And to use a fa-
vorite term that all of you people really 
came up with: We will stop the steal. Be-
cause you’ll never take back our country 
with weakness. You have to show strength, 
and you have to be strong. 
Even if President Trump claims he 
didn’t know the extent of the violence 
that would follow his speech, it was 
now happening in plain view, broadcast 
on television. His supporters were at-
tacking law enforcement. The mayor 
and the police chief were calling for 
help. Members of Congress and the Vice 
President were inside scared for their 
lives. 
He doesn’t send help, and he doesn’t 
try to stop it. He doesn’t even acknowl-
edge the attack. Instead, our Com-
mander in Chief tweeted the video of 
the speech that he had given before, 
that included language like ‘‘our coun-
try has had enough. We will not take it 
anymore and that’s what this is all 
about. . . . You have to be strong.’’ 
Those around Donald Trump—this 
was later reported—were disgusted. His 
close aides, his advisers, those working 
for him, former officials, and even his 
family were begging him to do some-
thing. Kellyanne Conway, the Presi-
dent’s close adviser, called to ‘‘add her 
name’’ to the chorus of aides urging 
Donald Trump to take action. Ivanka 
Trump, the President’s own daughter, 
went to the Oval Office ‘‘as soon as’’ 
the rioting escalated, and as was con-
firmed by Senator GRAHAM, ‘‘trying to 
get [Trump] to speak out, to tell every-
one to leave.’’ 
Minority Leader KEVIN
MCCARTHY 
called Jared Kushner, ‘‘pleading with 
him to persuade Trump to issue a 
statement’’ or to do something. And 
Kushner, too, went down to the White 
House after that call. 
And it wasn’t just the people at the 
White House. Members of Congress 
from both parties, who were trapped 
here, were calling the White House to 
ask for help. Some Members even ap-
pealed 
directly 
to 
Donald 
Trump. 
These Members who had ‘‘been loyal 
Trump supporters and were even will-
ing to vote against the electoral col-
lege results, were now scared for their 
lives.’’ 
Minority Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY re-
peatedly even got into a screaming 
match as the attack was under way,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S640 
February 10, 2021 
demanding that Mr. Trump do some-
thing, issue a statement denouncing 
the mob. 
I imagine many of you sitting here 
today picked up your phone and tried 
to reach somebody at the White House 
to ask for help. This wasn’t partisan 
politics. These were Americans from 
all sides trying to force our Com-
mander in Chief to protect and defend 
our country. He was required to do 
that. 
Now, the extent of how many people 
tried to reach the President to get him 
to act is not known. But what is clear, 
what we know without any doubt, is 
that from the very beginning, the peo-
ple around Donald Trump lobbied him 
to take command. What is also clear is 
what Donald Trump, our Commander 
in Chief, did in those initial hours to 
protect us. Nothing. Not a thing. He 
knew it was happening. The attack was 
on TV. We all know that President 
Trump had the power to stop these at-
tacks. He was our Commander in Chief. 
He had the power to assess the security 
situation, send backup, and send help. 
He also had incited these violent at-
tacks. They were listening to him. He 
could have commanded them to leave, 
but he didn’t. 
The first critical hour and a half of 
this bloody attack, Donald Trump 
tweeted his rally speech and did noth-
ing else. And we know why. We know 
his state of mind that prompted his 
utter, complete refusal to defend us. It 
was reported by those around him. 
The President, as reported by sources 
at the time, was delighted. As he 
watched the violence unfold on tele-
vision, President Trump was reportedly 
‘‘borderline enthusiastic because it 
meant the certification was being de-
railed.’’ 
Senator BEN SASSE relayed a con-
versation with senior White House offi-
cials that President Trump was ‘‘walk-
ing around the White House confused 
about why other people on his team 
weren’t as excited as he was.’’ 
Mr. Trump’s reaction to this attack, 
reportedly, genuinely freaked people 
out. I understand why. We just suffered 
a very serious attack, an attack on our 
country. And we saw them—the people 
around him—do it. But when Donald 
Trump saw it, he was delighted. 
Now, what President Trump did next 
confirms why he was so delighted, why 
he wanted this, because it shows that 
his singular focus that day—the day we 
were attacked—was not protecting us, 
was not protecting you, was not pro-
tecting the Capitol, but it was stopping 
the certification of the election re-
sults. 
The evidence is clear. Shortly after 2 
p.m., as the siege was fully under way, 
then-President Trump made a call. 
This is the first call that we are aware 
he made to anyone inside the Capitol 
during the attack. He didn’t call the 
Vice President to ask how he could 
help defend the Capitol. He didn’t call 
the next two in line to succession of 
the Presidency to check on their safety 
or well-being. 
Instead, he attempted to call Senator 
TUBERVILLE. He dialed Senator LEE by 
accident. 
(Text deleted.) 
Let’s be clear. At roughly 2 p.m., 
when 
Donald 
Trump 
was 
walking 
around the White House watching the 
TV delighted and spent 5 to 10 minutes 
talking to Senator TUBERVILLE, urging 
him to delay the election results, this 
is what was happening in the Capitol. 
(Video presentation.) 
You saw Senator LANKFORD
stop 
speaking and leave the floor quickly in 
that clip because the insurgents had 
broken through the barricades and en-
tered the building. And as these armed 
insurrectionists banged on the doors, 
Members of Congress were told to put 
on their gas masks, to put bags over 
their heads for safety, and prepare to 
evacuate. And Donald Trump was call-
ing to ask the Senator to delay the cer-
tification process. Let that sink in. 
Donald Trump didn’t get to finish 
that call. It was cut off because the 
Senators had to move to another loca-
tion, for your security. And thank God 
they did because as the call was occur-
ring, the rioters got closer to the Sen-
ate Chamber, and as we all know now, 
but for the heroism of Capitol Police 
Officer Eugene Goodman and other law 
enforcement officers who took them in 
a different direction to the police line, 
they very likely would have gotten 
here. 
Think about that. Armed insurrec-
tionists with guns, weapons, zip ties, 
brass knuckles, they were coming for 
us. They were inside the United States 
Capitol, trying to stop the certification 
process. The police were outnumbered. 
And but for the grace of God, they 
would have gotten us, all of us. 
And our Commander in Chief makes 
a call about an hour after the siege 
began, not to preserve, protect, and de-
fend you and our country and the Cap-
itol but to join forces with the mob and 
pressure a Senator to stop certifi-
cation. We just can’t get numb to this 
kind of behavior. 
There can be no doubt as to the pur-
pose of Donald Trump’s call, that he 
was not calling to assess the security 
threats or to check on the well-being of 
you or anyone else. Indeed, later on 
that evening, while all of the destruc-
tion and damage still continued, dozens 
of officers were being treated for seri-
ous injuries. Deaths were confirmed. 
About 7 p.m., the President’s personal 
lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, made a call, and 
just in case you don’t think there was 
some coordination, he also called Sen-
ator LEE’s phone trying to reach Sen-
ator TUBERVILLE. We don’t have to 
guess as to what Rudy Giuliani said in 
that voicemail because we have it re-
corded. So let’s listen to what the 
President’s personal lawyer said on the 
night of this attack. 
(Text of audio presentation.) 
Mr. GIULIANI. Senator Tuberville—or I 
should say Coach Tuberville, this is Rudy 
Giuliani, the President’s lawyer. I’m calling 
you because I want to discuss with you how 
they’re trying to rush this hearing and how 
we need you, our Republican friends, to try 
to just slow it down. 
This was the singular focus of Donald 
Trump during this bloody, violent at-
tack on the Capitol: stopping the cer-
tification. 
Look, as I mentioned, I was a trial 
lawyer for 16 years. Sometimes, you 
have to ask a jury to use reasonable in-
ferences to piece together a defendant’s 
state of mind. We don’t have to do this 
here. While our country was violently 
attacked by an armed mob, President 
Trump not only refused to stop the at-
tack or even address the attack at all, 
he made clear his focus was on the 
same goal of the attackers he incited: 
to stop the certification process and 
prevent the peaceful transition of 
power. The only action we know that 
he took an hour into this attack was to 
call Senator TUBERVILLE to ask him to 
delay the certification. This is as clear 
evidence as I have ever seen of what 
Donald Trump really cared about that 
day. 
Now, look, the certification process, 
as we all know, includes debate and ob-
jections. Some of us disagreed, but we 
came here on January 6 to formally ad-
minister the certification process pur-
suant to our constitutional duties. At 
the end of it, Congress certified the re-
sults to ensure that we continue to be 
a country with leaders who are elected 
by the people for the people. 
Donald Trump’s objections to the 
certification are not on trial, but what 
is on trial is, while we were under 
armed attack and being evacuated, 
while our law enforcement officers 
were fighting for their lives, our Com-
mander in Chief was calling not to de-
termine how to best secure the build-
ing and the people in it but to continue 
to pressure Senators to stop the certifi-
cation process and a peaceful transfer 
of power, just as he incited the mob to 
do earlier in the day. This was a 
breathtaking dereliction of his duty 
and a violation of his oath as our Com-
mander in Chief. 
Senators, before I hand this over to 
Manager CASTRO to walk through the 
rest of the day, please let me make one 
final point. These attackers stood right 
where you are. They went through that 
rostrum. They rifled through your 
desks, and they desecrated this place. 
And literally, the President sat de-
lighted, doing nothing to help us, call-
ing one of you to pressure you to stop 
the certification. 
It can’t be that the Commander in 
Chief can incite a lawless, bloody in-
surrection and then utterly fail in his 
duty as Commander in Chief to defend 
us from the attack, to defend our law 
enforcement officers from that attack, 
and just get away with it. Donald 
Trump abdicated his duty to us all. We 
have to make this right, and you can 
make it right. 
Mr. Manager CASTRO of Texas. My 
fellow 
manager 
DAVID
CICILLINE 
showed you what President Trump did 
and did not do in those first critical 
hours of the attack.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S641 
February 10, 2021 
He sent a tweet at 1:49 p.m., where he 
reposted a video of the speech that in-
cited the attack, and he called a Sen-
ator to ask him to delay the certifi-
cation as the Senator was being evacu-
ated for his own safety. 
We left off around 2:15 p.m. At this 
point, insurgents were inside the Sen-
ate and the House, and the Senate had 
been evacuated for everyone’s safety. 
As you saw, Vice President Mike Pence 
and his family even had to be evacu-
ated for their safety. 
Now, you will recall Donald Trump 
had made Vice President Pence a tar-
get. He attacked the Vice President at 
the rallies, in speeches, and on Twitter. 
And during President Trump’s speech 
that morning of the attack, he ramped 
it up again. After privately pressuring 
Mike Pence in front of thousands in 
the crowd, he called Mike Pence out 11 
times, including saying: 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Mike Pence, I hope you’re going to stand 
up for the good of our Constitution and for 
the good of your country. And if you’re not, 
I’m [going] to be . . . disappointed in you. I 
will tell you right now. 
And this was the crowd’s response to 
Donald Trump’s days of relentless at-
tacks on his own Vice President: 
(Text of video presentation.) 
(People chanting: ‘‘Hang Mike Pence.’’) 
By 2:15 p.m., the crowd was chanting 
in unison ‘‘Hang Mike Pence’’ outside 
the very building he had been evacu-
ated from with his family. 
Now, even if President Trump didn’t 
know that his inflammatory remarks 
about his Vice President would result 
in chants of ‘‘Hang Mike Pence,’’ by 
2:15 p.m., he surely knew. The attack 
was all over television. They were 
doing this out in the open. This was a 
Vice President whose life, whose fam-
ily’s life, was being threatened by peo-
ple whom the President had summoned 
to the Capitol. And what did President 
Trump do in response? Did he stop? Did 
he tell his base: No, don’t attack my 
Vice President. Even when President 
Trump knew what his words were caus-
ing, he didn’t do any of those things to 
stop the crowd. In fact, he did the op-
posite. He fueled the fire. 
At 2:24 p.m., he tweeted: 
Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do 
what should have been done to protect our 
country and our Constitution. . . . USA de-
mands the truth. 
Over an hour and a half into the at-
tack, and this is what he tweeted. And 
he still, even at this point, did not ac-
knowledge the attack on the Capitol, 
let alone condemn it. Instead, he fur-
ther incites the mob against his own 
Vice President, whose life was being 
threatened. 
Well, some of you may say: Well, who 
was paying attention anyway? Well, 
that mob was paying attention. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Unidentified Speaker. Mike Pence didn’t 
have the courage to do what should have 
been done to protect our country and our 
Constitution, giving States a chance to cer-
tify or correct a set of facts, not (inaudible) 
defraud ones or inaccurate ones, which they 
were asked to previously certify. U.S. de-
mands the truth. 
Unidentified Speaker. Mike Pence, anar-
chist. Mike Pence, anarchist. 
Unidentified Speaker. (Inaudible.) Can I 
speak to Pelosi? Yeah, we’re coming, bitch. 
Oh, Mike Pence, we’re coming for you, too, 
fucking traitor. 
Unidentified Speaker. Donald J. Trump 
better (inaudible). 
Unidentified Speaker. Full house. 
Unidentified Speaker. (Inaudible) Mike 
Pence let us down. Mike Pence let us down, 
people. If you want to get something done, 
you are going to have to do it yourself. 
The insurgents amplified President 
Trump’s tweet attacking the Vice 
President with a bullhorn. They were 
paying attention, and they also fol-
lowed instructions. In fact, the insur-
gents were at one point, as you saw, 60 
feet away from the Vice President and 
the Vice President’s family. Some of 
these insurgents were heard saying 
‘‘that they hoped to find Vice Presi-
dent Mike Pence and execute him by 
hanging him from a Capitol Hill tree as 
a traitor,’’ and then they erected a gal-
lows with a noose. 
This is what Donald Trump incited. 
Please take a close look at that pic-
ture. It hearkens back to our Nation’s 
worst history of lynching. 
A President’s words have the power 
to move people to action, and these 
were the results. 
And why did the President incite 
such rage against the Vice President? 
He was fulfilling his constitutional 
duty, as we all were that day. Vice 
Presidents in this country have been 
carrying out this constitutional duty— 
overseeing the certification of election 
results—without incident, without con-
test, without a word, for the entirety of 
our Nation. It is part of our peaceful 
transition of power in the United 
States. 
The Vice President said he reviewed 
the Constitution and he could not 
block 
certification, 
as 
President 
Trump wanted him and was pressuring 
him to do. He told the President in a 
letter that morning, a few hours before 
President Trump’s tweet: 
[I will] approach this moment with [a] 
sense of duty and an open mind, setting poli-
tics and personal interests aside, and do [my] 
part to faithfully discharge our duties under 
the Constitution. I also pray that we will do 
so with humility and faith. 
And the President’s response to that 
statement was to attack Mike Pence 
while he was with his family under the 
threat of a violent mob. The Vice 
President was following his faith, his 
duty, and his oath to our Nation. 
The Vice President and I don’t agree 
on too much in politics, but he is a 
man who upholds his oath, his faith, 
his duty, and most of all upholds the 
Constitution. And Mike Pence is not a 
traitor to this country. He is a patriot. 
And he and his family, who was with 
him that day, didn’t deserve this, 
didn’t deserve a President unleashing a 
mob on them, especially because he 
was just doing his job. 
As this was unfolding and the crowd 
grew more violent, the President, of 
course, was not alone at the White 
House, and the people closest to him— 
his family and advisers—who saw this 
unfolding in realtime, begged him, im-
plored him to stop the attack. 
An aide to MARK MEADOWS, the Presi-
dent’s Chief of Staff, urged his boss to 
go see the President, saying: ‘‘They are 
going to kill people.’’ 
‘‘They are going to kill people.’’ That 
is what those around President Trump 
feared, and still nothing. It wasn’t 
until 2:38 p.m., nearly 2 hours after the 
start of the siege, that Donald Trump 
even acknowledged the attack. And 
when he finally did acknowledge the 
attack, here is what he said. 
On the right you will see what had 
been happening prior to that tweet and 
as he sent the tweet, and on the left 
you will see exactly what he tweeted. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. I’m going to stop 
you there for just one moment because we do 
have some breaking news. We want to bring 
in 
congressional 
correspondent 
Chad 
Pergram as this is all developing right now. 
Chad, I understand the Capitol is now on 
lockdown? 
Mr. Pergram. They’re definitely fired up. 
The chant, by the way, I heard the most 
today was ‘‘fight for Trump,’’ and that’s 
clearly what many of them feel they’re 
doing. 
Unidentified Speaker. Hold the line. 
(People singing: ‘‘O, the land of the free.’’) 
That is what our President saw un-
folding in realtime, broadcast all over 
television, and this is what he tweeted 
at 2:38 p.m.: 
Please support our Capitol Police and Law 
Enforcement. They are truly on the side of 
our Country. Stay peaceful! 
Much has been made of the fact that 
in this tweet he says, ‘‘Stay peaceful.’’ 
Senators, 
‘‘Stay 
peaceful’’? 
Think 
about that for a second. These folks 
were not peaceful. They were breaking 
windows, pushing through law enforce-
ment officers, waving the flag as they 
invaded this Capitol Building. This was 
a violent, armed attack. 
‘‘Stay peaceful’’? How about: Stop 
the attack. Stop the violence. 
‘‘Stay peaceful’’? How about you say: 
Immediately leave. Stop. 
And he said: ‘‘Please support our Law 
Enforcement.’’ How about he actually 
support our law enforcement by telling 
these insurgents to leave the Capitol 
immediately, which he never did. He 
didn’t because, the truth is, he didn’t 
want it to stop. He wanted them to 
stay and to stop the certification. And 
his failure had grave and deadly con-
sequences. 
By 2:45 p.m., the warnings were trag-
ically proven correct. Ashli Babbitt 
was shot by an officer as she tried to 
break through a glass door to reach the 
Speaker’s Lobby. 
At this point, the pleas to Donald 
Trump, publicly and privately, grew 
even more desperate. At 2:54 p.m., 
Alyssa Farah, a former strategic com-
munications director, begged the Presi-
dent:

At 3:06 p.m., Representative MCCAR-
THY appeared on FOX News. Here is 
what he said. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. I could not be sadder or 
more disappointed with the way our country 
looks at this very moment. People are get-
ting hurt. Anyone involved in this, if you’re 
hearing me, hear me very loud and clear: 
This is not the American way. 
He is saying on FOX News, which the 
President watches: This is not the 
American way. Stop the attack. 
Representative GALLAGHER, at 3:11 
p.m., while secured in his own office, 
posted a video to Twitter. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Mr. President, you have 
got to stop this. You are the only person who 
can call this off. Call it off. 
And then, when the President didn’t 
answer his pleas on Twitter, Represent-
ative GALLAGHER
went on live tele-
vision. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Mr. GALLAGHER. I mean, this is insane. I 
mean—I—I have not seen anything like this 
since I deployed to Iraq in 2007 and 2008. I 
mean, this is America, and this is what is 
happening right now. We need—the President 
needs to call it off. Like, call it off. Call it 
off. 
Representative GALLAGHER, you see 
there, said he had not seen anything 
like this since he was deployed in Iraq. 
The message around the President 
was clear, from everyone: You need to 
call this off. Stop it. 
But does he? No. His next tweet was 
not until about 3:13 p.m. Once again, it 
is important to consider what was hap-
pening between Donald Trump’s 2:38 
p.m. tweet and his next tweet at 3:13 
p.m. 
You will see footage from the attack 
during that time on the right and Don-
ald Trump’s tweet on the left. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Unidentified Speaker. We’ve been informed 
that protesters have penetrated the Capitol. 
Unidentified Speaker. This is my fucking 
building. 
Unidentified Speaker. I tell ya, the senti-
ment in the streets is really getting to a dif-
ferent level. This is spinning out of control. 
This is turning violent. This is getting dan-
gerous. 
Unidentified Speaker. Stand up for Amer-
ica. 
Unidentified Speaker. Don’t touch me. 
Unidentified Speaker. Don’t get in his way. 
Unidentified Speaker. Get the fuck out of 
here. 
This isn’t 10 minutes into the insur-
rection. This isn’t just after his speech 
earlier that day. That is what our Com-
mander in Chief saw happening, and 
that was his response. 
You will notice one of the things he 
says to his mob, to these insurrection-
ists, rather than to stop or to leave, 
was to say thank you. Thank you. 
Thank you for what? Thank you for 
shattering the windows and destroying 
property? Thank you for injuring more 
than 140 police officers? Thank you for 
putting in danger all of our lives and 
the lives of our families? 
How about, instead of ‘‘thank you,’’ 
Donald Trump, on that day, acted like 
our Commander in Chief and stopped 
this, as only he could, and told those 
people to leave. 
Here is what former Governor Chris 
Christie, his very good friend, said 
after that tweet. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Mr. Christie. It’s pretty simple. The Presi-
dent caused this protest to occur. He is the 
only one who can make it stop. What the 
President said is not good enough. The Presi-
dent has to come out and tell his supporters 
to leave the Capitol grounds and to allow the 
Congress to do their business peacefully, and 
anything short of that is an abrogation of his 
responsibility. 
He is right. Chris Christie is right. 
We know how Donald Trump acts on 
Twitter and otherwise when he has a 
message to convey. In fact, I asked you 
to remember those tweets earlier this 
morning when he yelled on Twitter: 
‘‘STOP THE COUNT.’’ 
When he wanted to incite his sup-
porters to show up on January 6, Presi-
dent Trump tweeted 16 times between 
midnight on January 5 and his noon 
rally/speech the next day—16 times to 
get them to do something he wanted. 
And his message in those 16 times was 
clear: ‘‘Fight.’’ ‘‘Stay strong.’’ ‘‘Be 
strong.’’ 
But when the violence started, he 
never once said the one thing everyone 
around him was begging him to say: 
Stop the attack. He refused to stop it. 
And as Governor Christie and Rep-
resentative KINZINGER and others made 
clear, only Donald Trump could have 
stopped that attack. 
(Text of video presentation of 1–6– 
2021.) 
Mr. KINZINGER. You know, a guy who 
knows how to tweet very aggressively on 
Twitter, you know, puts out one of the weak-
est statements on one of the saddest days in 
American history because his ego won’t let 
him admit defeat. 
He was not just our Commander in 
Chief. He had incited the attack. The 
insurgents were following his com-
mands, as we saw when they read aloud 
the tweet attacking the Vice Presi-
dent. They confirmed this during the 
attack too. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
Senators, ask yourselves this: How 
easy would it have been for the Presi-
dent to give a simple command, a sim-
ple instruction, just telling them: Stop. 
Leave. 
This was a dereliction of duty, plain 
and simple, and it would have been for 
any President who had done that. And 
that brings me to my next point. You 
heard from my colleagues that when 
planning this attack, the insurgents 
predicted that Donald Trump would 
command the National Guard to help 
them. 
There is a lot that we don’t know yet 
about what happened that day, but 
here is what we do know: Donald 
Trump did not send help to these offi-
cers who were badly outnumbered, 
overwhelmed, and being beaten down. 
Two hours into the insurrection, by 3 
p.m., President Trump had not de-
ployed the National Guard or any other 
law enforcement to help, despite mul-
tiple pleas to do so. 
President Donald Trump was at the 
time our Commander in Chief of the 
United States of America. He took a 
solemn oath to preserve, protect, and 
defend this country, and he failed to 
uphold that oath. In fact, there is no 
indication that President Trump ever 
made a call to have the Guard deployed 
or had anything to do with the Guard 
being deployed when it ultimately was. 
Shortly after 3:04 p.m., the Acting 
Defense Secretary announced that the 
Guard had been activated and listed 
the people he spoke with prior to this 
activation, including Vice President 
Mike Pence, Speaker PELOSI, Leader 
MCCONNELL, Senator SCHUMER, and 
Representative HOYER. But that list 
did not include the President. This 
omission of his name was reportedly 
not accidental. According to reports, 
‘‘Trump initially rebuffed requests to 
mobilize the National Guard and re-
quired interference by other officials,’’ 
including his own White House Coun-
sel. And later, ‘‘as a mob of Trump sup-
porters breached police barricades and 
seized the Capitol,’’ Trump reportedly 
was ‘‘disengaged in discussions with 
Pentagon leaders about deploying the 
National Guard to aid the overwhelmed 
U.S. Capitol Police.’’ President Trump 
was reportedly ‘‘completely, totally 
out of it. He made no attempt to reach 
[the National Guard.]’’ And it was Vice 
President Pence, still under threat for 
his life, who reportedly spoke to the 
Guard. 
President Trump’s conduct confirms 
this too. At no point on January 6 did 
Donald Trump even reference the Na-
tional Guard. The only thing that we 
heard connecting the President to the 
Guard was from his Press Secretary, 
who tweeted about the Guard being de-
ployed at the President’s direction over 
half an hour later, at 3:36 p.m. 
We have seen what Donald Trump 
does when he tries to take credit for 
something, and yet, even when the Na-
tional Guard was finally deployed, he 
didn’t even acknowledge it. In fact, he 
didn’t say a word about the National 
Guard the entire day. Think about 
that: the bloodiest attack we have seen 
on our Capitol since 1812 and our Presi-
dent couldn’t be bothered to even men-
tion that help was on its way. 
These insurgents had been attacking 
our government for over 4 hours by 
that point. And we may have been the

target, but it was the brave men and 
women who protect our Capitol who 
were out there combating thousands of 
armed insurgents in a fight for their 
lives, and that is who Donald Trump 
left entirely unprotected. 
(Video presentation of 1–6–2021.) 
This is hard to watch, but I think it 
is important to understand what the 
Capitol Police were facing, how se-
verely they were outnumbered while 
our Commander in Chief, whose job it 
was to protect and defend them, was 
just watching, doing nothing for hours, 
refusing to send help. If he wanted to 
protect these officers, if he cared about 
their safety, as he tweeted about, he 
would have told his supporters to 
leave. He would have sent help right 
away. 
One brave officer was killed. Others 
took their lives after the attack. More 
than 140 police officers were injured, 
including cracked ribs, smashed spinal 
discs. One officer will lose an eye. An-
other was stabbed with a metal fence 
stake. They were completely and vio-
lently overwhelmed by a mob and need-
ed help, and our Commander in Chief, 
President Trump, refused to send it. 
Senators, you have seen all the evi-
dence so far, and this is clear: On Janu-
ary 6, President Trump left everyone in 
this Capitol for dead. For the next hour 
after President Trump’s 3 p.m. tweet, 
he still did nothing. Not until 4:17 p.m., 
over 31⁄2 hours after the violence start-
ed, did our President send a message fi-
nally asking the insurgents to go 
home. 
On the right, you will see what hap-
pened that day in the hours leading up 
to his prerecorded video. On the left, 
you will see his message. Let’s watch. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
President TRUMP. I know your pain, I 
know you’re hurt, we had an election that 
was stolen from us. It was a landslide elec-
tion and everyone knows it, especially the 
other side. But you have to go home now. We 
have to have peace. We have to have law and 
order. We have to respect our great people in 
law and order. We don’t want anybody hurt. 
It’s a very tough period of time. There’s 
never been a time like this, where such a 
thing happened, where they could take it 
away from all of us. From me, from you, 
from our country. This was a fraudulent 
election, but we can’t play into the hands of 
these people. We have to have peace. So go 
home. We love you, you’re very special. 
We’ve seen what happens, you see the way 
others are treated that are so bad and so 
evil. I know how you feel. But go home and 
go home in peace. 
This is the first time our Commander 
in Chief spoke publicly at all since the 
attack began, over 31⁄2 hours after it 
started, and these are the entirety of 
the words the President spoke out loud 
to the American people or to the 
attackers that entire day. 
Nowhere in that video, not once did 
he say: I condemn this insurrection. I 
condemn what you did today. 
Nowhere did he say: I am sending 
help immediately. Stop this. 
Here is what he said instead: 
I know your pain, I know you’re hurt. We 
had an election that was stolen. 
Even after all the things we wit-
nessed, even after all of that carnage, 
he goes out and tells the same big lie, 
the same big lie that enraged and in-
cited the attack. He repeated this 
while the attack was ongoing and while 
we were still under threat. 
And here is what else he said: 
Go home in peace. 
We love you, you’re very special. 
Senators, you were here. You saw 
this with your own eyes. You faced 
that 
danger. 
And 
when 
President 
Trump had an opportunity to confront 
them as the leader of us all, as our 
Commander in Chief, what did he tell 
them? 
We love you, you’re very special. 
This was not a condemnation; this 
was a message of consolation, of sup-
port, of praise. And if there is any 
doubt that his supporters, these insur-
gents, took this as a message of sup-
port and praise, watch for yourselves. 
(Text of video presentation.) 
Mr. Angeli. Donald Trump asked every-
body to go home. He just said—he just put 
out a tweet. It is a minute long. He asked ev-
erybody to go home. 
Unidentified Speaker. Why do you think 
so? 
Mr. Angeli. Because we won the fucking 
day. We fucking won. 
Unidentified Speaker. How did we win? 
Mr. Angeli. Well, we won by sending a mes-
sage to the Senators and the Congressmen, 
we won by sending a message to Pence, OK, 
that if they don’t do as—as it is their oath 
do, if they don’t uphold the Constitution, 
then we will remove them from office, one 
way or another. 
I suspect you recognize that man. 
You will hear him say that ‘‘we won 
the day.’’ Who won the day? We know 
that at least five people lost their lives 
that day. The House and the Senate 
were in life-threatening danger, and so 
was the Vice President, and think of 
everyone else here as well. Who won on 
January 6? That is not a win for Amer-
ica, but it is a win for Donald Trump 
unless we hold him accountable. 
Now, a little over an hour after that 
video, the brave members of law en-
forcement secured the Capitol, and we 
as a Congress got ready to continue 
certifying the results of our free and 
fair election. 
A half hour after that, President 
Trump issued another tweet. In case 
there was any doubt as to whether he 
was happy with the people who did 
this, as to whether he had incited this, 
he commemorated what happened on 
January 6. 
At 6:01 p.m. on January 6, he tweeted: 
These are the things and events that hap-
pen when a sacred landslide election victory 
is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped 
away from great patriots who have been 
badly & unfairly treated for so long. 
Ending with: 
Remember this day forever! 
My 
colleague 
Manager 
CICILLINE 
started with this tweet because this 
tweet 
shows 
exactly 
how 
Donald 
Trump felt about what happened on 
January 6. ‘‘These are the things . . . 
that happen.’’ He is saying this was 
foreseeable. He is saying: I told you 
this was going to happen if you cer-
tified the election for anyone else, and 
you got what you deserved for trying 
to take my power away. 
[G]reat patriots. . . . Go home with love & 
in peace. Remember this day forever! 
He is saying to them: You did good. 
He is not regretful. He is not grieving. 
He is not sad. He is not angry about the 
attack. He is celebrating it. He is com-
memorating it. 
This is the entirety of what Presi-
dent Trump said to the public once the 
attack 
began—five 
tweets 
and 
a 
prerecorded video. On the day of the 
most bloody insurrection we faced in 
generations, our Commander in Chief, 
who is known for sending 108 tweets in 
a normal day, sent 5 tweets and a 
prerecorded video. That is the entirety 
of President Trump’s public statements 
from when the attack began until he 
went to bed on January 6. That is all 
he did despite all the people we know 
who begged him to preserve, protect, 
and defend. That was our Commander 
in Chief’s response. 
He began the day with ‘‘Our country 
has had enough, we will not take it 
anymore, and that’s what this is all 
about,’’ and he ended the attack with 
letting us know that we got what he 
forewarned that morning. 
We will, of course, each of us, remem-
ber that day forever, but not in the 
way that President Trump intended, 
not because of the actions of these vio-
lent, unpatriotic insurrectionists. I 
will remember that day forever be-
cause despite President Trump’s vi-
cious attempts throughout the day to 
encourage the siege and block the cer-
tification, he failed. At 8:06 p.m., the 
Senate gaveled into session, and the 
counting of the electoral votes contin-
ued. About an hour later, the House 
followed suit. And close to 4 a.m., after 
spending a significant part of the day 
evacuated or on the floor or hiding, 
this great body fulfilled the will of the 
people and certified the electoral col-
lege vote. 
And I am proud to be part of Con-
gress. I am proud that we ensured that 
the will of the American people finally 
prevailed on that day. And I am proud 
that I and everyone in this room abided 
by our oath of office even if the Presi-
dent didn’t abide by his. 
President Trump, too, took an oath 
as President. He swore on a Bible to 
preserve, protect, and defend. And who 
among us can honestly say they believe 
that he upheld that oath? Who among 
us will let his utter dereliction of duty 
stand? 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, 
the managers are prepared to recess for 
the evening and to finish our opening 
statement tomorrow.

the 
House 
impeachment 
managers, 
statements relating to the content of 
conversations between—a phone call 
involving President Trump and Sen-
ator TUBERVILLE—were not made by 
me, they are not accurate, and they are 
contrary to fact. I move, pursuant to 
rule XVI, that they be stricken from 
the record. 
UNIDENTIFIED SENATOR. Second. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pur-
suant to S. Res. 47, section 4, parties’ 
presentations are not limited to the 
record provided for in section 1 of that 
resolution. 
Mr. LEE. I appeal the ruling of the 
Chair. 
Mr. PAUL. I second. 
I ask for the yeas and nays. 
Mr. 
WICKER. 
Mr. President, we 
might as well hear clearly what the 
ruling of the Chair was, so if you would 
repeat that, sir. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Of 
course, I will. And pursuant to S. Res. 
47, section 4, the party’s presentations 
are not limited to the record provided 
for in section 1 of that resolution. 
The Senator from Utah has appealed 
that ruling; is that correct? 
Mr. LEE. Yes, I have. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
yeas and nays have been requested. 
Is there a sufficient second? 
Mr. WICKER. What is the question? 
Is it, Shall the ruling of the Chair be 
sustained? Is that the question? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes. 
Mr. LEE. What may I ask is the rul-
ing of the Chair? My point is not 
whether it is appropriate to make char-
acterizations; my point was to strike 
them because they were false. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
question is, whether the interpretation 
that S. Res. 47, section 4 applies is cor-
rect; that the party’s presentations are 
not limited to the record provided in 
section 1 of that resolution. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, that is not 
my motion. You have ruled on a mo-
tion—you ruled on something that was 
not what I moved. What I asked was, 
statements were attributed to me, re-
peatedly, as to which I have personal 
knowledge because I am the source. 
They are not true. I never made those 
statements. I ask that they be strick-
en. This has nothing to do with wheth-
er or not they are based on depositions, 
which they are not. It is simply based 
on the fact that I am the witness. I am 
the only witness. Those statements are 
not true, and I ask that you strike 
them. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
yeas and nays were asked for. The yeas 
and nays are requested. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Please let him ex-
plain, Mr. President. Why was it false? 
What was false about it? 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is 
not in order—under S. Res. 47, section 
4, the party’s presentation is not lim-
ited to the record provided for in sec-
tion 1 of the resolution, and that has 
been appealed. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Point of clarifica-
tion. 
What is the question? 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence 
of a quorum while we work this out. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. I ask that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we 
need order. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senate will be in order. 
Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent to 
vitiate the appeal—the request that I 
made. 
I withdraw the request for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection. 
Mr. 
SCHUMER. 
I 
withdraw 
the 
quorum call and call on the manager, 
Mr. RASKIN, for a brief statement. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. Thank you, 
Mr. SCHUMER. 
The 
impeachment 
manager, 
Mr. 
CICILLINE, correctly and accurately 
quoted a newspaper account, which the 
distinguished Senator has taken objec-
tion to, so we are happy to withdraw it. 
Mr. LEE. Because it is not true. 
Mr. 
Manager 
RASKIN. 
On 
the 
grounds it is not true, and we are—— 
Mr. LEE. CASTRO repeated it too. 
Mr. Manager RASKIN. We are going 
to withdraw it this evening without 
any prejudice for the ability to resub-
mit it, if possible. This is much ado 
about nothing because it is not critical 
in our case. 
Mr. LEE. You are not the one being 
cited as a witness, sir. 
Mr. SCHUMER. So the managers’ 
issue stands. Mr. LEE has withdrawn 
his request, and we may relitigate it 
tomorrow if we have to. 
f 
ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TOMORROW 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent the trial adjourn 
until 12 noon tomorrow, Thursday, 
February 11, and that this order also 
constitute the adjournment of the Sen-
ate. 
There being no objection, at 7:40 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, adjourned until Thurs-
day, February 11, 2021, at 12 noon.
