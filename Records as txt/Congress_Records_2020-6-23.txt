PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O, God, our shield, look with favor 
upon our Senators today. Guide them 
around the obstacles that hinder their 
progress, uniting them for the common 
good of this great land. 
Lord, free them from anxiety and 
fear as they put their trust in You. En-
able them to go from strength to 
strength, fulfilling Your purpose for 
their lives in this generation. Guide 
them to use their abilities and talents 
to accomplish Your holy will. Striving 
to please You, help them to stand for 
right and leave the consequences to 
You. 
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
we are taking a very important vote 
tomorrow on a bill called the JUSTICE 
Act. I am proud to cosponsor this po-
lice reform bill, and I also applaud Sen-
ator TIM SCOTT for his leadership in 
improving police accountability while 
at the same time preserving the essen-
tial service that law enforcement pro-
vides. These are the people who main-
tain the peace in the respective com-
munities around the United States. 
We are ready to work with Demo-
crats on police reform. I hope the 
Democrats finally are willing to come 
to the table. 
A successful vote to proceed to the 
JUSTICE Act speaks volumes. A vote 
against proceeding shows the American 
people that politics are more impor-
tant than people, talking points more 
important than change, and gridlock 
more important than solutions. 
Surely, Democrats want police re-
form. I hope Democrats will vote in 
favor of opening debate on the JUS-
TICE Act. George Floyd and countless 
others so murdered deserve the Sen-
ate’s action and consideration of this 
bill. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
2 weeks ago, I argued that civil dis-
course in America faces a crossroads. 
A major newspaper had buckled 
under pressure from the social media 
mob. They apologized profusely for 
publishing a policy argument from a 
U.S. 
Senator 
and 
made 
personnel 
changes to prove their penitence. I said 
that we could either recommit to our 
tradition of seasoned debate or let an 
angry mob run our culture. 
Recent days have reminded us that it 
is not just our present-day debates that 
far-left radicals want to overwhelm. 
They also want to rewrite the past. 
Back in 2017, when people wondered 
whether our important conversations 
over Confederate monuments would 
give the far left a broader taste for 
pulling down statues, major news-
papers and media figures literally 
mocked that concern. They said there 
were obvious differences between rebel 
generals and our Nation’s Founders. 
They said nobody would come gunning 
for Washington or Jefferson. Well, the 
far left missed the memo. 
A few days ago, in Portland, OR, a 
mob graffitied a statue of our first 
President, pulled it down, and burned 
an American flag over his head. This is 
George Washington. 
Another Washington statue was de-
faced in Baltimore. A statue of Thomas 
Jefferson was ripped down in Portland 
also. This is the general and first Presi-
dent who built our Nation and the au-
thor of the Declaration of Independ-
ence—genius statesmen who helped 
begin this grand experiment that has

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3132 
June 23, 2020 
brought freedom to hundreds of mil-
lions and saved the world a few times 
for good measure. 
Yet, a crazy fringe is treating their 
monuments like vanity statues of tin-
horn tyrants. Our Founding Fathers 
are being roped to the ground like they 
were Saddam Hussein. 
The list goes on: Saint Junipero 
Serra, the missionary settler whom 
Pope Francis celebrated here in Wash-
ington a few years ago to bipartisan 
applause, sided with native people over 
soldiers; Ulysses S. Grant, the general 
who crushed the Confederacy, the 
President who used Federal force to 
fight the Klan. They, too, have been 
placed on the historical hit list for this 
new Red Guard that nobody elected. 
There are more monuments toppled up 
and down the west coast. 
There could be no clearer sign that 
these far-left radicals have severed any 
connection to the righteous cause of 
racial justice. They have literally tried 
to succeed where Robert E. Lee failed 
and bring General Grant to the ground. 
Like any cultural revolution, this 
far-left anger is sparing some heroes of 
their own. I understand that in Seattle, 
a large statue of Vladimir Lenin stands 
quite untouched. Apparently, people 
claim with a straight face that this 
Communist statue has survived be-
cause it is located—wait for it—on pri-
vate property. So the Founding Father 
of the mass-murdering Soviet Union 
watches over Seattle streets, but our 
own Founding Fathers are dragged in 
the dirt. 
A small slice of our national elite has 
spent years cooking up highfalutin 
theories to justify the cheapest, basest 
forms of anti-Americanism. The absurd 
claim that America’s deepest founding 
principle is bigotry has escaped the 
ivory tower and begun seeping into so-
ciety. 
The United States of America can 
and should have nuanced conversations 
about our complex past. We can and 
should have discussions about our fu-
ture. We can and should have peaceful 
protests. But this lawlessness serves 
none of that. It is just an alliance of 
convenience between angry criminals 
who think it is fun to wreak havoc and 
a slice of elite society that profits off 
saying that our country is evil and de-
serves the abuse. Enough. Enough. 
The vast majority of Americans 
know full well that imperfect heroes 
are still heroes, that our imperfect 
Union is still the greatest Nation in 
world history. Americans know that 
our imperfect Framers built our Nation 
on moral truths that fueled improve-
ment beyond anything their generation 
could 
have 
built 
themselves. 
The 
American people know this. They also 
know that we cannot let angry mobs 
carrying ropes act outside the rule of 
law. 
It was central to the 14th Amend-
ment and the civil rights movement 
that law enforcement and local au-
thorities may not do their jobs selec-
tively. If ‘‘equal protection of the 
laws’’ means anything, it means may-
ors and Governors cannot selectively 
stand down because they would rather 
not pay the political price for con-
fronting a particular mob. But that is 
precisely what we are seeing in Demo-
cratic-governed cities all across our 
country. 
In Seattle, for weeks now, a mayor 
has let bands of people ban police from 
several square blocks. People have 
been shot. A teenager has died. But, ap-
parently, stopping this insanity has 
been deemed less politically correct 
than letting it continue. Night after 
night, Governors and mayors have 
stood down and watched criminals 
spray paint churches and topple stat-
ues. Public order is now totally op-
tional and depends on the lawbreaker’s 
politics. 
Here in Washington, last night, local 
police protected one monument from a 
memorial-hunting mob over near the 
White House. It is past time for that 
courage to be replicated in every city, 
every night, until Americans have the 
peace and the rule of law that all of our 
citizens deserve. 
It is no surprise that people who 
want to say our country is intrinsically 
evil are so frantic to erase history that 
they will break the law to do it. Eras-
ing history is the only way their 
claims could carry any water. 
Americans know that an imperfect 
nation built by imperfect heroes is still 
the most perfect Union the world has 
ever seen. We are proud to build stat-
ues of the geniuses who fought to found 
this country. We are proud to build 
statues to the leaders who have pre-
served it. We are proud to build statues 
of prophetic civil rights leaders who 
made the country confront gross injus-
tice. We thank God that all kinds of 
imperfect people have made us a more 
perfect Union. 
When the dust settles, it is never— 
never—the mobs or bullies whom we 
honor. It is the brave leaders who con-
front them. 
f 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on a totally different matter, last 
week, Senator SCOTT of South Carolina 
and a group of our colleagues rolled out 
the JUSTICE Act—a serious set of pro-
posals to move the ball for police re-
form across the country. 
This legislation identifies a number 
of smart levers that Congress can pull 
to advance and encourage smart re-
forms of law enforcement without 
steamrolling States’ and localities’ 
constitutional powers. 
It would step up transparency in re-
porting and recordkeeping. It would ex-
pand accountability and disciplinary 
measures needed to establish and re-
store community trust. It would di-
rectly address issues, such as choke 
holds and no-knock warrants, which 
have been in the news lately for rea-
sons that nobody believes are accept-
able. 
These are the subjects that the coun-
try needs us to address. Accordingly, 
these are the subjects Senator SCOTT’s 
proposal does address. 
The American people expect us to do 
our jobs, discuss, debate, and legislate 
on this subject that has captured the 
Nation’s attention—discussion, debate, 
and votes on amendments. 
Tomorrow, we will find out whether 
even these modest steps are a bridge 
too far for our colleagues on the Demo-
cratic side. 
Earlier this month, Senate Demo-
crats were telling everyone who would 
listen that we would be derelict in our 
duty if we did not have police reform 
legislation on the floor of the Senate 
this month. But then, as soon as the 
junior Senator from South Carolina ac-
tually published something concrete, 
their tune changed rather sharply. 
Now, suddenly, our Democratic col-
leagues are reportedly agonizing and 
debating whether to let the Senate 
have this discussion at all or whether 
to kill any chance of reform legislation 
before it can even taxi onto the run-
way. 
The American people deserve better 
than a partisan stalemate. The Amer-
ican people deserve for the Senate to 
take up this issue at this time. 
Senate Republicans want to have this 
discussion. We are ready to make a 
law, not just make a point. 
Tomorrow, we will find out whether 
our Democratic colleagues share our 
ambition or whether they choose to 
duck the issue and leave the country in 
the lurch.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3133 
June 23, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I speak for 
10 minutes, the Senator from New Jer-
sey for 10 minutes, and then the Sen-
ator from California for 10 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the 
past 
few 
months 
have 
been 
amongst the most wrenching and tu-
multuous 
in 
recent 
memory. 
The 
deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Tay-
lor, Ahmaud Arbery, as well as from 
the COVID–19 pandemic, have forced 
our country to reckon with not only 
the decades of long failure to reform 
our police departments and prevent un-
warranted 
brutality 
against 
Black 
Americans but also the centuries-long 
struggle against racial injustice. 
Here in Congress, the Democrats 
have sought to turn the anger and frus-
tration in our country—and, yes, some-
times despair—into real and meaning-
ful action. The Democrats wish to seize 
the moment. Three weeks ago, the 
Democrats announced a bill that would 
finally bring strong, comprehensive, 
and lasting change to police depart-
ments across America—the Justice in 
Policing Act, led by Senators BOOKER 
and HARRIs. The House of Representa-
tives will pass that bill this week, but 
here in the Senate, we have a much dif-
ferent story. 
Senate Republicans have responded 
to our comprehensive legislation by 
proposing a bill that is so much weaker 
on nearly every single count and, worse 
still, is completely silent on so many 
issues that scream out for action. 
Should police officers be held to great-
er account if they violate Americans’ 
constitutional rights? The Republican 
bill is silent. Should police depart-
ments continue to have easy access to 
military-grade equipment? The Repub-
lican bill is silent. Should police de-
partments be forced to change their be-
havior 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
racial 
profiling? Should they develop a better 
use of force standard? Should the Jus-
tice Department be empowered and en-
couraged to investigate police depart-
ments that have bad patterns and prac-
tices? Silent. Silent. Silent. 
In the place of real change and ac-
countability for police officers and de-
partments, the Republican bill pro-
poses a slew of studies and commis-
sions. We don’t need to study the prob-
lem of police misconduct and vio-
lence—we need to solve it. No doubt, 
these issues are complex, multifaceted, 
and difficult, but the Republican legis-
lation pretends as if the cancer of po-
lice brutality is, in reality, little more 
than a runny nose. 
The national conversation about po-
licing reform, which has been ongoing 
for several years, was renewed by the 
terrible killing of George Floyd—his 
windpipe crushed by an officer who 
kept his knee on Floyd’s neck for near-
ly 9 minutes. The bill my Republican 
friends have drafted would not even 
completely ban the type of brutal tac-
tics that led to George Floyd’s death. 
The Republican bill does not even fully 
prevent 
the 
kind 
of 
tactics 
that 
sparked this whole debate in the first 
place. 
Breonna Taylor, a first responder, 
was asleep in her bed in Louisville, KY, 
when she was killed by police who were 
executing a no-knock warrant. The Re-
publican bill does not ban no-knock 
warrants. It does not limit no-knock 
warrants or require police departments 
to provide more information before ob-
taining them from a court. It calls for 
more data on the use of no-knock war-
rants. After the tragic loss of Breonna 
Taylor, how could the Republican bill 
not even attempt to prevent the kind 
of events that led to her death? 
Imagine if President Johnson, after 
the bus boycotts and the march in 
Selma and the righteous movement for 
civil rights in America, had proposed a 
bill that had called for more data on 
the effectiveness of poll taxes and 
other voter intimidation techniques. 
Imagine if President Johnson, instead 
of the Voting Rights Act, had proposed 
a voting rights commission to have 
studied the issue a little bit more. 
There is no escaping the fact that the 
Senate Republicans have drafted a po-
licing bill that is deeply, fundamen-
tally, and irrevocably flawed, and the 
Democrats are not the only ones to say 
so. 
In this morning’s Washington Post, 
the Floyd family lawyer, Reverend 
Sharpton, and the NAACP Legal De-
fense and Educational Fund urged Sen-
ators to oppose the GOP reform bill. 
They called it a nonstarter. That is 
what we believe as well. 
Last night, the NAACP Legal De-
fense and Educational Fund said that 
it ‘‘cannot support legislation that 
does not embody a strong account-
ability framework for police officers 
and other law enforcement who engage 
in misconduct.’’ 
The lawyer for the families of George 
Floyd 
and 
Breonna 
Taylor, 
Ben 
Crump—one of the Nation’s most re-
nowned civil rights attorneys—wrote 
that the Republican legislation is ‘‘in 
direct contrast to the demands of the 
people’’ who have been protesting, and 
‘‘the Black community is tired of the 
lip service, and shocked that the [Re-
publican proposal] can be thought of as 
legislation.’’ That is from the lawyer 
for the families of Breonna Taylor and 
George Floyd. 
Let me repeat: The attorney rep-
resenting the families who are seeking 
justice believe the Republican bill is 
completely inadequate, lip service, and 
can hardly be thought of as legislation. 
How does Leader MCCONNELL respond 
to that charge? How does he respond 
when the families’ lawyer says his bill 
is a nonstarter? 
Civil rights groups—the noble guard-
ians of these issues for generations 
that want nothing more than to see 
meaningful legislation—are urging the 
Senate to reject the Republican pro-
posal. They see this bill for the futile 
and, maybe, cynical ploy that it is. 
Their opposition speaks louder than al-
most any other. 
Who does America believe when it 
comes to dealing with these issues— 
Leader MCCONNELL, who seems to be 
new to these issues, or the civil rights 
groups, which have been fighting for 
change for decades? Who does America 
believe? 
We 
Democrats 
are 
certain 
the 
McConnell plan will not—indeed, can-
not—result in any passing of legisla-
tion. It is clear the Republican bill, as 
is, will not get 60 votes. There is over-
whelming opposition to the bill in our 
caucus, and because the bill needs such 
large-scale and fundamental change, 
there is no conceivable way that a se-
ries of amendments strong enough to 
cure the defects in the bill could garner 
60 votes either. So no bill will pass as 
a result of this ploy by Senator MCCON-
NELL. The Republican majority has 
given the Senate a bad bill and pro-
posed no credible way to sufficiently 
improve it. 
Simply put, Leader MCCONNELL has 
created a cul-de-sac from which no leg-
islation can emerge. Leader MCCON-
NELL’s plan appears to be designed to 
get the burden of dealing with policing 
reform off the Republicans’ shoulders 
by setting up a process which is guar-
anteed not to result in successful legis-
lation. 
Again, Leader MCCONNELL is leading 
the Senate into a cul-de-sac—a process 
designed to fail. Yet there is a way out 
of this cul-de-sac. Yes, there is a way 
out. It is the same process that has led 
to success in the Senate time and 
again. It is a simple word—‘‘bipartisan-
ship.’’ 
This 
morning, 
Senators 
BOOKER, 
HARRIS, and I are sending a letter to 
Leader MCCONNELL, stressing the need 
for bipartisan talks to get a construc-
tive starting point on policing reform. 
If our two parties could get together to 
draft a bipartisan proposal—and even if 
we don’t agree on everything, we can 
agree to invoke a real amendment 
process—then we might produce a bill 
that has a real shot of passing. If the 
Republican leader would acknowledge 
the obvious need for these talks, there 
is a real chance we could produce legis-
lation that has a shot of passing. 
So we are pleading with Leader 
MCCONNELL: Instead of pressing for-
ward with this partisan bill that is de-
signed to make sure no bill passes, 
Leader MCCONNELL, pursue a path that 
is designed to produce real, meaningful 
policing reform. 
In the Senate, where 60 votes are re-
quired to achieve almost anything, a 
bipartisan process is the only way to 
move forward. 
My friends, this could be a moment 
for the Senate to rise to the occasion. 
There is certainly something hap-
pening out there in America. Hundreds

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3134 
June 23, 2020 
of thousands of protesters of every 
faith and color and age have taken to 
the streets to demand change. 
If Americans out in the country can 
together join in a righteous chorus 
calling for change, we in the Senate 
can at least try to come to deliver it, 
but it is going to take more than typ-
ical games here in the Senate that 
Leader MCCONNELL seems to be now 
playing. 
We are going to have to rise above 
the take-it-or-leave-it legislating that 
has trapped us in the status quo on so 
many issues. 
We were able to negotiate a $3 tril-
lion emergency aid package before 
bringing it to the floor of the Senate. 
We have done it on budgets and crimi-
nal justice reform, on the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act. A bipartisan group 
put together an immigration bill that 
passed the Senate with more than two- 
thirds votes on a very contentious 
issue because it was bipartisan. 
So on even thorny issues like police 
reform, we can—we can and we must— 
work with each other, and we need to, 
in order to achieve a bill that can actu-
ally pass the Senate. 
So let me repeat my request to Lead-
er MCCONNELL: Let us not retreat to 
partisan corners on such a vital issue. 
Let us appeal to the higher instincts of 
this Chamber and try to find a bill to-
gether. 
I yield to the Senator from New Jer-
sey. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
thank you for the recognition, and I 
thank the Democratic leader for his 
words. 
The Democratic leader talked about 
what is happening in our country. I 
have never seen something like this be-
fore in all my years, where hundreds of 
thousands of Americans have been out 
in protest—and not just certain sec-
tors. In all 50 States, in large cities and 
small towns, Americans from every 
background, race, religion, and polit-
ical party have joined together fol-
lowing the gruesome capture of the 
torture and murder of a fellow Amer-
ican. 
This is a profound moment. It is a 
moral moment. We know this is not a 
partisan moment because the good will 
of all Americans is evident, from na-
tional polling that shows that real re-
form is widely supported by people of 
both parties to just the voices of people 
who are saying that we are a nation 
formed around a fundamental idea of 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness, to have it so fundamentally vio-
lated. The call is for us to act, to come 
together as good men and women and 
do something to protect human lives. 
We have done that before on the Fed-
eral level in a bipartisan way, coming 
together to protect people against in-
discriminate violence—from the Vio-
lence Against Women Act to even the 
historic, bipartisan work that went on 
to get 99 Members of this body behind 
an anti-lynching bill. 
I am grateful for that aspect of our 
history, that this is a body that has 
acted multiple times to try and protect 
human life. 
Well, no one need watch a video of 8 
minutes and 46 seconds again to under-
stand that this body now holds a true 
moral choice of how will we act. What 
will we do in this moral moment in our 
country? Will we come together and 
protect life and liberty or will we do 
nothing and allow the violence to hap-
pen, the cycle in our Nation, the name 
after name after name after name that 
we know and the thousands of other 
names that we do not know—Black 
lives being abused, civil rights being 
violated, lives being lost because we 
have failed the moment in our Nation? 
A little over 2 weeks ago, Leader 
SCHUMER, Senator HARRIS, and I, along 
with colleagues in the House, intro-
duced an act that was narrowly focused 
on accountability. It zeroed in on what 
we could do to create accountability, 
to ensure oversight, to implement 
transparency, and to ban actions that 
people in this country, in both parties, 
widely believe should and must be 
banned. 
The bill that is being put forth by 
Leader MCCONNELL is wholly unaccept-
able to bring accountability, trans-
parency, and consequences when our 
common values as a country are vio-
lated. This is not about partisanship— 
a Republican bill and a Democratic 
bill. It is about taking meaningful ac-
tion that will create change. 
The bill Leader MCCONNELL wants to 
put on the floor is called the JUSTICE 
Act. It belies its name because it does 
not—in any way—even serve as a start-
ing point or even a baseline for nego-
tiations. 
The American people are not in the 
streets chanting ‘‘We want more data; 
we want more data.’’ The American 
people are not in the streets chanting 
‘‘Give us a commission; give us a com-
mission.’’ 
We know the data, and we have had 
commissions—from the Kerner Report 
all the way to the Task Force on 21st 
Century Policing. What we are hearing 
a demand for, from voices all over our 
country—including from leaders in po-
lice departments to mayors, to local 
leaders, to activists—is real account-
ability; that if you do something wrong 
in America, there will be consequences; 
that no one is above the law; that we, 
in this country, will make sure that 
those who represent law and enforce-
ment do so in a way that accords with 
our common values and our common 
ideals. 
In fact, we want to go further in this 
country. We have a greater moral 
imagination that does not have us 
trapped in the quicksand of the present 
but calls to us to rise to a higher 
ground; that we could be a nation that 
imagines ourselves having a larger def-
inition of law enforcement, a larger 
definition of public safety. We cannot 
get mired in this moment. This must 
be the start of climbing to that higher 
ground. 
The problem with the bill that Lead-
er MCCONNELL wants to put on the 
floor, it is not bold. It is not coura-
geous. There is no great imagination 
about what we can be. It doesn’t chal-
lenge us to come together. What it does 
is guarantee that the cycle of violence 
in our country, the cycle of the abuse 
of civil rights, the cycle of death that 
has so moved so many Americans will 
continue. 
If we don’t implement real measures 
of accountability for police officers in 
this country—as the Republican bill 
fails to do—it is not if but when we will 
be back here again after another police 
officer kills another unarmed Black 
person and faces no fear of Federal ac-
countability in the courts. 
If we don’t establish real trans-
parency measures with a national reg-
istry 
of 
police 
misconduct—which 
Leader MCCONNELL’s bill fails to do—it 
is not if but when we will be back here 
again, after another officer who has a 
record of inappropriate use of force will 
get fired from one town and hired in 
the next and end up hurting another 
citizen, violating their civil rights or— 
worse—killing them. 
If we do not end those harmful prac-
tices that Americans from all back-
grounds know are wrong, like racial 
and religious profiling, no-knock war-
rants in drug cases, and the use of 
choke holds—which this McConnell bill 
fails to do—it is not if but when we will 
be back here again after another 
Breonna Taylor is murdered in her own 
home after a no-knock warrant, after 
another Eric Garner is suffocated to 
death on a sidewalk with an inhumane 
choke hold. 
If we do not create a national use-of- 
force standard in America—which this 
Republican bill, again, fails to do—we 
will be back here again the next time 
another officer uses deadly force when 
they could have used deescalation be-
cause that deadly force was ‘‘reason-
able,’’ though not necessary. 
I hear the voices. We all hear the 
voices, the anguish, the agony, the 
pain, the trauma, the hurt. It has trig-
gered a nation to rise up like has never 
happened in the last 50 years. 
We are in a moment of profound pos-
sibility, but what do we face? We face 
it being shut down here in the Senate 
over an impotent bill that fails to meet 
this moment. 
The American people are demanding 
accountability, not commissions; they 
are 
demanding 
accountability, 
not 
study; they are demanding account-
ability, not data collection alone. We 
have to ask ourselves: Will we stand for 
a bill with zero accountability or will 
we rise? 
I am so frustrated because I have 
been here now for 6 years, and I have 
seen, from inside this body as a Mem-
ber to even before I came here, how the 
leader has done bipartisan efforts. I 
saw it on immigration reform. A Gang 
of 8 was formed, discussions were had, 
and they came to a bill. They put it on 
the floor, and they voted for it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3135 
June 23, 2020 
I have seen it in this COVID crisis. 
People met and worked on solutions. 
I have seen, time and again, when 
there is a sincere desire to come to a 
bipartisan consensus, how it works. 
But this is not how Leader MCCONNELL 
is acting now. 
Where is the good faith? Where is the 
yearning for justice? Where is the de-
sire to get something real done? 
There have been no hearings. He has 
called for no discussions. He has called 
for no meaningful engagement—in the 
way we have done in the past—from 
stakeholders and groups that have been 
working on this issue. He has not sent 
it to the appropriate committee of ju-
risdiction. 
This is not what the American people 
want. This is not what this moment 
calls for. This is shameful. This is a de-
sire to turn a page, to point a finger of 
blame, and to leave the calls for justice 
in this country falling upon the mute 
ears, the deaf ears, of a body that 
should be hearing, listening, and re-
sponding. 
There is no easy fix for the problems 
we face, but they do demand work. 
They don’t demand simple monologues; 
they demand real dialogue. This is not 
a time to retreat into our corners. It is 
a time to engage each other. 
I cannot, in any way, give any justice 
or sanction to what is going on in this 
body now. We will be back here again. 
We will see more video capturing the 
dark corners of our country that must 
be brought into the light and solved 
with the spirit of this Nation. 
I join CHUCK SCHUMER and KAMALA 
HARRIS
in urging Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL not to proceed in this way. 
It is not progress. It is an attempt to 
turn a page on history that we will 
have to revisit. Every minute, every 
hour, every day we do not act, Black 
lives are in danger; our fellow citizens 
are in danger; we as a Nation, our prin-
ciples and ideals are in danger. 
It is time that we come together and 
provide hope from this body that 
serves, truly serves, to honor what the 
public is calling for, which is action— 
not retreat but for us to try, in this 
body, to rise together. 
I yield to my colleague from Cali-
fornia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Ms. HARRIS. Madam President, the 
murders of George Floyd, Breonna Tay-
lor, and Rayshard Brooks are the latest 
in a long history of violence against 
Black people in America, but thanks to 
the advocacy, thanks to the courage of 
their mothers and fathers and relatives 
and all of the civil rights leaders, the 
lawyers, those who are marching in the 
streets—and 
smartphones—everyone 
can finally bear witness to the violence 
that has been happening in our country 
at the hands of police. 
Now, let’s be clear. This behavior is 
not new. Mothers have been crying 
over their dead children’s bodies for 
generations, yet no one would listen. 
No one would listen. 
Emmett Till’s mother had the cour-
age, as a leader, to say: The world will 
listen when they look at my baby’s 
body in that casket. Yet here we are, 
these many decades and generations 
later, and still we have not seen mean-
ingful change in America on this sub-
ject. 
It is time we act. It is time we act. 
And let us be clear: Sometimes some of 
the most courageous and important 
work that has happened in this U.S. 
Congress has happened not because 
there was leadership in the body but 
because the people demanded it and 
they would not relent until their gov-
ernment and elected leaders and rep-
resentatives listened to and answered 
their call for steps toward what we call 
a more perfect Union. 
It has been many a time the case 
that it is because of the people march-
ing in the streets that we had the Vot-
ing Rights Act and Civil Rights Act 
and the Fair Housing Act—because the 
people would allow nothing less than 
that we, as a government, be true to 
our stated ideals. 
Yes, over the last 31⁄2 years in our 
country, many of us have wondered 
whether the leaders of this country ac-
tually pay homage to and have any de-
sire to institute and to get closer to 
those ideals. 
This is a moment for the U.S. Senate 
to say we, as a body, will do that; that 
what is clear right now in this moment 
and in this movement is that there is 
still work that can be done—not just 
should be done but can be done—to 
come closer to those words inscribed 
across the street in the U.S. Supreme 
Court, to effectuate ‘‘Equal Justice 
Under Law.’’ It is within our grasp to 
do this. It is not just an imperative; it 
is within our grasp. In America today, 
people from every State, all 50 States, 
and in every walk of life are demanding 
that we take the problem of police bru-
tality seriously. We have this oppor-
tunity, and we should see it as such. 
Where before there may have been re-
luctance to go against the strength of 
the status quo, which is always reluc-
tant, if not hostile, to change, the peo-
ple in the streets of every race, every 
gender, every age, from every State, 
are not only giving us permission but 
demanding that their leaders finally 
make good on the American promise of 
‘‘Equal Justice Under Law.’’ They are 
demanding this change; they are not 
just asking for it. 
So we can’t answer the people’s de-
mand for accountability with watered- 
down politics and watered-down poli-
cies and obstructionist tactics to dis-
tract us from what we clearly know is 
necessary to meet the calls and the 
cries of this moment and this move-
ment. I will say that we cannot answer 
their demands with this Republican at-
tempt to obstruct real progress and 
real justice in our country. 
And for all of the pundits out there 
who want to entertain a conversation 
about 
whether 
Democrats 
actually 
want police reform, are you kidding 
me? Are you kidding me? We are re-
sponding to the cries in the street; we 
are taking them seriously; and we have 
proposed a prescription that actually 
responds to not just their demands but 
the specific cases and the bodies which 
have just most recently been buried, 
much less the generations of Black 
bodies which have been buried because 
of this issue. So don’t anyone dare sug-
gest we are standing in the way of 
progress. 
Let us all be clear about what is hap-
pening in the politics of this moment. 
The Republican bill has been thrown 
out to give lip service to an issue with 
nothing substantial in it that would 
actually save or would have saved any 
of those lives. Let’s not be distracted 
from the task at hand. I intend to vote 
against a motion to proceed tomorrow. 
I also intend to vote for a motion to 
proceed with real reform. I am not 
against a motion to proceed. We should 
proceed. Let’s proceed with action—not 
gestures—with action. 
Let’s talk about the Republican bill. 
I am a former prosecutor. I have per-
sonally prosecuted everything from 
low-level 
offenses 
to 
homicides. 
I 
worked almost my entire career with 
police officers. What I can tell you is 
this—and I am certain of it—police of-
ficers will tell you how difficult their 
job becomes when their colleagues and 
other police officers break the rules 
and break the law. They will tell you 
that. They will tell you that it affects 
the culture of their working environ-
ment. It affects the morale of where 
they work every day. It affects the in-
tegrity of their work. What they know 
is bad cops are bad for good cops. 
What we all know is that it is in the 
best interest of community safety and 
harmony when the people trust their 
government, and it is a reciprocal rela-
tionship. 
In addition to what our bill proposes, 
the Justice in Policing Act is about ac-
countability and consequence. It is also 
brought forward with a spirit of what 
we know is in the best interest of grow-
ing trust and the American people’s 
trust in their government. 
As a former prosecutor, I will also 
say that in the criminal justice sys-
tem, we also talk about and use this 
phrase 
‘‘accountability 
and 
con-
sequence.’’ We use it all the time, ac-
countability and consequence. There 
must 
be 
accountability 
and 
con-
sequence. Almost every time that 
phrase is invoked, it is directed at the 
person who was arrested and hardly 
ever is that phrase directed at the very 
system itself and the actors in that 
system. 
Where is the accountability and con-
sequence when a system fails the peo-
ple it is designed to protect? Where is 
the accountability and consequence 
when people who have been invested by 
the people with a gun and a badge—it 
is the power we give them—where is 
the accountability and consequence 
when they abuse that power, one must 
ask. Our bill is designed to address just

June 23, 2020 
that. I will tell you, there is not one 
component of the Republican bill that 
does the same. 
Let’s talk about the history of where 
we are today—just recent history, 
meaning in the U.S. Senate on this 
subject. On Monday June 9, in response 
to protests in all 50 States of these 
United States, Senator CORY BOOKER 
and I, along with our CBC and House 
Judiciary colleagues and a majority of 
our Senate caucus, announced the Jus-
tice in Policing Act. Over 1 week later, 
the people are marching in the streets. 
Let’s just remember this. People are 
marching in the streets every night, 
every day. Well, 1 week later, some-
body got the memo, and then what did 
they do? They came up with what they 
call the JUSTICE Act as a way to es-
sentially show that they have some-
thing but to basically obstruct what al-
ready had been put in place. They did 
it because they knew that the people 
were demanding something. What they 
put up, instead of meeting those de-
mands, was a tactic to obstruct the 
progress of the Justice in Policing Act. 
Then they are playing a political 
game around here saying: ‘‘Look, the 
Democrats won’t vote for policing re-
form.’’ No. We are actually fully pre-
pared to vote for policing reform, 
which is why a week earlier than you 
figured it out, we figured it out and put 
it on paper and presented it to the Na-
tion. 
Let’s not play political games today 
and tomorrow. Let us understand that 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, 
the 
majority 
leader, made it clear—you know, I say 
to the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. 
BOOKER, I wasn’t here for those days 
when he saw a lot of that bipartisan 
work. I did see it with other COVID 
bills, and I am thankful that did hap-
pen, but what I see most recently on 
this issue is that Senator MCCONNELL 
made it clear that he had no intention 
of passing bipartisan comprehensive 
legislation on policing reform. What we 
have seen is that instead of an ability 
for all of us in this Chamber to pass the 
Justice in Policing Act—which has al-
ready gained 227 cosponsors, enough to 
pass the House—instead, the Senate 
leader has scheduled this vote tomor-
row, not to solve the problem of police 
brutality in America but to solve his 
political problem, to which he has 
taken no stand and that caucus has 
taken no meaningful stand on an issue 
that has people in our streets marching 
for the last 3 weeks, and those march-
ing folks will go on. 
The proposal was carefully crafted 
that is being offered tomorrow for a 
vote. The Republican proposal was 
carefully crafted to deflect from real 
change by merely, as my colleague 
Senator BOOKER outlined and Senator 
SCHUMER outlined—by merely offering 
to study the problem without doing 
anything to solve it. 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
would the Senator yield for a question? 
Ms. HARRIS. When I am finished, I 
will. 
The Republican bill does not even 
provide a baseline for a discussion or 
amendment on police reform in that 
there are no mechanisms to hold law 
enforcement officers accountable in 
court for their misconduct. There is no 
transparency into police misconduct, 
which is necessary, of course, to enable 
communities to hold officers account-
able. There is no requirement of data 
collection on all use-of-force incidents 
or on racial or religious profiling. 
There is no ban on harmful policing 
policies and practices, such as racial 
and religious profiling and no-knock 
warrants in drug cases. We are not ban-
ning all no-knock warrants in drug 
cases because Breonna Taylor would be 
alive today had that been the case. 
There is no reform to the issues of 
choke holds or carotid holds in the Re-
publican bill that is being offered. 
There is no national standard for use of 
force. 
I am happy to entertain the question 
from the Senator from Texas. Then I 
will conclude my comments. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
wonder if the Senator would tell me, 
the JUSTICE Act that it sounds like 
the Democratic conference intends to 
block tomorrow includes the anti- 
lynching legislation that you and Sen-
ator BOOKER have championed; are you 
aware of that? 
Ms. HARRIS. The same one RAND 
PAUL obstructed a couple of weeks ago? 
Yes, I am aware of that. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, so 
the Senators are going to block their 
own anti-lynching bill by their vote to-
morrow. 
Ms. HARRIS. Absolutely not. I think 
it is important we not distract the 
American people from the task at 
hand. 
We cannot pull out a specific compo-
nent of this bill and leave everything 
else in the garbage bin. That is the log-
ical and actual and practical conclu-
sion of where you are going with the 
suggestion that we would sacrifice 
issues like no-knock warrants, issues 
like a national standard for use of 
force, issues like the need for inde-
pendent investigations of police mis-
conduct, issues like pattern and prac-
tice 
investigations 
with 
subpoena 
power for the Department of Justice 
for the sake of one. It is like asking a 
mother to save one of her children and 
leave the others. 
Mr. CORNYN. Would the Senator 
yield for another question? 
Ms. HARRIS. Absolutely. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the 
Senator certainly is familiar with the 
rules of the Senate, which allow Sen-
ators to offer amendments to improve 
legislation once we get on it, but if the 
Democratic conference is going to pre-
vent the Senate from actually getting 
on the bill, there is no opportunity for 
any Senator, you or any one of us, to 
offer amendments to improve it. 
I would further ask the Senator, 
aren’t you aware of the fact that there 
are 60-vote thresholds on the back end 
so that if we get on the bill and you 
don’t like the way it turns out, you can 
block it on the back end; is the Senator 
aware of those options you have? 
Ms. HARRIS. Senator CORNYN, we are 
honored to serve on the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, as does Senator BOOK-
ER and Senator DURBIN. We all serve on 
the Judiciary Committee. The two Sen-
ate officers serve with you on the Sen-
ate 
Judiciary 
Committee. 
As 
you 
know, because we have been present 
during our most recent hearings, we 
have asked that there would be a 
meaningful discussion of the Justice in 
Policing Act in that committee. None 
has occurred. 
If we are going to talk about process, 
let us look at all the tools that are 
available 
to 
well-intentioned, 
well- 
meaning legislators, if the goal is actu-
ally to solve and address the issue at 
hand. I have seen no evidence of that. 
I have seen no evidence. In fact, what I 
have seen in reading some of the news-
papers—sometimes 
they 
get 
things 
wrong, but if they got it right, the Sen-
ate leader says that he has no interest 
in engaging in that kind of discussion 
or debate before putting the bill on the 
floor for a vote tomorrow. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, may 
I ask one last question? 
Will the Senator yield? 
What I am trying to fathom is why 
the Senator would rather have these 
negotiations occur behind closed doors 
as opposed to here on the floor of the 
Senate with the American people to see 
broadcast on television? Don’t you 
think that sort of interaction and de-
bate and negotiation out in front of all 
330 million Americans would be bene-
ficial to healing our country and com-
ing to some consensus about what the 
appropriate reforms should be? 
Ms. HARRIS. Indeed. That is the 
beauty of the Judiciary Committee; 
our meetings are public meetings. 
I will conclude my remarks by saying 
that I do believe now is the time for 
Congress to pass legislation that will 
bring real change and real improve-
ment. It is time that we meet this mo-
ment and meet the movement that we 
are seeing outside of these doors. We 
are seeing people of every race, gender, 
age, and religion marching together in 
unison as Americans. We are seeing 
people putting their bodies on the line 
in the face of more excessive force and 
tear gas to stand for equality for all 
people. 
The bill that is being offered for a 
vote tomorrow does not, in any way, 
meet the needs of this moment and the 
longstanding needs America has had 
for reform. 
I will, therefore, join Senators SCHU-
MER and BOOKER in not only sending a 
letter to Senator MCCONNELL
this 
morning demanding the Senate vote on 
the Justice in Policing Act, but I will 
say I fully intend to vote against a mo-
tion to proceed until and unless we are, 
as a body, prepared to offer meaningful 
reforms upon which we can debate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3137 
June 23, 2020 
I will say also that one of the other 
problems with what is being offered by 
our colleagues across the aisle is it is 
not meeting the moment in terms of 
need for reform. It is simply, basically, 
they constructed a confessional, where 
there can be a confession of misdeeds 
after the fact, and that in no way 
meets the moment in terms of reforms 
that are necessary. 
In the immortal words of my great 
Uncle Sherman, God rest his soul, 
‘‘That dog don’t hunt.’’ 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. First, I want to thank 
my colleagues, Senators BOOKER and 
HARRIS. Thanks for your leadership and 
courage and the fact that have dedi-
cated yourself to this moment. 
Some would say we are fortunate; 
others would say we are blessed to be 
at this moment in this place in the 
roles that we currently have. Can you 
imagine across the United States of 
America how many people would like 
to be standing where we are standing 
today? Despite the frustration, we have 
a voice. We have an opportunity. We, 
as U.S. Senators, have the power, if we 
use it, to do something about what 
threatens America. 
Imagine how 8 minutes 46 seconds 
could have such profound impact on 
this Nation of over 300 million people 
and the world, but then to realize that 
8 minutes 46 seconds merely reminded 
us of all of the other issues, all of the 
other cases, all of the other George 
Floyds who came before. 
I have just been stunned in my own 
home State of Illinois—which I dearly 
love and know fairly well—by what I 
have seen in the streets of towns large 
and small. In the city of Chicago, just 
this last Juneteenth weekend, there 
was an amazing display of unity on 
Black Lives Matter. The African-Amer-
ican ministers led it, but all the rest of 
us were happy to be part of it because 
it meant so much. 
Then you go downstate Illinois to 
towns like our capital city, Spring-
field, or Jerseyville, IL, and attend 
Black Lives Matter rallies there that 
were organized by two young women, 
African-American high school juniors. 
They organized 1,500 people in Spring-
field for a Black Lives Matter rally. 
Nykeyla Henderson and her twin sis-
ter Nykia Henderson said: Let’s call to-
gether 
students 
and 
friends 
about 
Black Lives Matter. Fifteen hundred 
people showed up. No windows were 
broken, no looting, no screaming, no 
shouting, no cursing. It was a textbook 
display 
of 
constitutional 
authority 
that each of us as a citizen has, and 
they used it so well. I salute them even 
to this day. 
Then, to go down to Jerseyville, a 
small rural community that I have rep-
resented over the years—which may or 
may not have a minority population at 
all—and to have, from 20 miles away, a 
high school junior, a young African- 
American 
woman 
whose 
name 
is 
Lay’lahny Davis, who did exactly the 
same thing: She called together hun-
dreds of people—in this case, some 350 
on the courthouse lawn in Jerseyville— 
to celebrate Black Lives Matter. 
I have never seen anything like this. 
I have never seen it reach this level of 
commitment. Trust me, these young 
women were doing this, knowing that 
some of the people standing on the pe-
rimeter were not their friends, but 
they had the courage to be there be-
cause they believed in what they were 
doing. 
Do we have the courage at this mo-
ment to speak up for real change? How 
many times in the history of this coun-
try can Senators come to the floor and 
say that it is within our grasp? We can 
make America better, and we can per-
fect this great Nation to even be great-
er with courage. 
What I hear from my colleagues— 
Senators HARRIS and BOOKER—I could 
not agree with more. I am going to 
vote against this motion to proceed to-
morrow. I believe, as they do, that we 
as a Senate can do better. We can do 
better in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, which throughout generations 
has been the place to go, the forum to 
visit, the last stop, if you will, on the 
most important issues of our day—the 
Senate Judiciary Committee—time and 
again. 
I have been blessed to serve there for 
over two decades, and I look back on 
the history of that body before I ar-
rived, and I think to myself: DURBIN, 
you are a lucky man to be on the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee of the U.S. 
Senate, particularly at this moment. 
This is not only our issue; this is our 
moment in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee and on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate. That is why Senator MCCONNELL’s 
tactic is so empty and so obvious. 
We 
understand 
how 
the 
Senate 
works. If you have been here 5 minutes, 
you know. He is the majority leader. 
He calls the shots. He decides what is 
coming to the floor, which amend-
ments will be offered, which will not be 
offered, which bills will move forward, 
and which bills will stop. It is his 
power to do it. It is a very powerful po-
sition. 
Instead of saying to us: Start in the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, find a bi-
partisan measure to bring to the floor, 
and then let’s work together to have 
meaningful amendments but to have it, 
in fact, enacted—instead of that, he 
said: Take our bill or leave it. If you 
don’t want to vote for the Republican 
bill on this subject, go home and defend 
your vote. I am prepared to and I think 
my colleagues are too. 
Listen to what the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People Legal Defense Fund said about 
this bill today. This organization is an 
incredible organization, and if you 
don’t know much about it, read ‘‘Devil 
in the Grove,’’ a story of Thurgood 
Marshall in the late 1940s and 1950s, 
risking 
his 
life 
defending 
African 
Americans who were facing criminal 
charges across the United States. 
The NAACP Legal Defense Fund said: 
‘‘In this moment, we cannot support 
legislation that does not embody a 
strong accountability framework for 
police officers and other law enforce-
ment who engage in misconduct as well 
as needed reforms to policing prac-
tices.’’ 
The group wrote in a letter, a copy of 
which was sent to Members of the Sen-
ate, and they went on to say: ‘‘We urge 
you to vote no on the motion to pro-
ceed with consideration of the JUS-
TICE Act’’—which is the Republican 
bill—‘‘and 
instead 
advance 
reforms 
that will hold law enforcement ac-
countable and offer more transparency 
of policing practices such as those em-
bodied in S. 3912, the Justice in Polic-
ing Act of 2020’’—a bill which I am hon-
ored to cosponsor with my friends, Sen-
ators BOOKER and HARRIS. 
This morning I sat down and decided 
to read in detail the analysis of these 
two bills. It is night and day in terms 
of the direction they take. Something 
as fundamental as choke holds—does 
America know what a choke hold is? 
We saw it and will never forget it. We 
saw that knee on George Floyd’s neck, 
and we watched the minutes pass by 
and his life ebb away. Can we be any-
thing less than resolute on the issue of 
choke holds? Our bill is. It bans them. 
It bans them. The restriction of blood 
or oxygen or the carotid artery—we are 
specific; we are specific. Sadly, the Re-
publican bill is not. 
We also defined ‘‘deadly force’’ and 
what is less than ‘‘lethal force.’’ We 
specifically defined it. What does the 
Republican bill do? It calls on the At-
torney General of the United States to 
develop a policy—to develop a policy— 
Attorney General William Barr. 
On no-knock—I thank Senator HAR-
RIS for raising that—we have direct 
legal limits on the use of no-knock, 
which was, in fact, the procedure fol-
lowed that led to the death of Breonna 
Taylor in Louisville, KY. What does 
the Republican bill have? A reporting 
requirement—a reporting requirement. 
Body cameras? We require them. We 
put penalties in the law for those who 
don’t use them. We also require that 
they be on vehicles, law enforcement 
vehicles. The Republican bill does not 
require them. It offers grants to police 
departments that want to buy them 
and then asks from those departments 
‘‘assurances’’ that they are using them. 
On the misconduct registry, we es-
tablish public access to the misconduct 
registry when it comes to police mis-
conduct. But there is no public access 
in the Republican bill. 
Yes, it is true, as was noted earlier 
by the Senator from Texas, there is 
commonality on issues like anti-lynch-
ing—thank goodness—a mere century 
after we started debating it in the U.S. 
Senate. We have reached that point, 
and I am glad we have. 
When it comes to training, data, and 
demographics, there are many areas of 
commonality, but there are specific 
areas that this bill—the one we have

introduced—includes that are not in-
cluded in the Republican bill: Criminal 
liability under the Civil Rights Act— 
we changed the standard to make it 
truly an attainable standard on the 
Democratic bill; qualified immunity; 
civil rights investigations; the power of 
subpoena, which we give to the Depart-
ment of Justice; the use-of-force inves-
tigation; grants for independent inves-
tigation; and—this is a measure I have 
worked on for a while and am so glad it 
is 
included 
here—banning 
racial 
profiling once and for all. 
I want to salute a former colleague 
from Wisconsin, Russ Feingold. He was 
one of the earliest on this whole issue 
of profiling, a courageous position on 
his part at that moment in history. Fi-
nally, we include it in our bill. 
It is not included in the Republican 
bill. Instead, what they offer are com-
missions, data collection, and a couple 
of other criminal offenses, each of 
which is worthy of consideration but 
should not be enough to divert us from 
our goal. 
I am going to conclude by saying 
this. I feel blessed to be here in the 
U.S. Senate at this moment in history. 
I feel fortunate to have a chance, with 
my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, to change the history of this 
country in the right direction. My 
goodness, it is so long overdue. After 
all of the 400 years of slavery, when it 
first came to our shore, and the greed 
and racism that fed it as that insidious 
original sin of our country, now is our 
chance to do something in our genera-
tion to make a difference for those fu-
ture generations that march in the 
street and look to us for real change. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii is recognized. 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I 
share the strong words and position 
and perspective of my wonderful col-
leagues, colleagues who spoke before 
me just now—Senators HARRIS, BOOK-
ER, and DURBIN—calling for real polic-
ing reform, not the bill that is coming 
before the floor tomorrow. 
THE EQUALITY ACT 
Madam President, this morning I 
would like to turn to another issue 
that should concern all of us and that 
deserves our attention. On December 
17, 1990, Genora Dancel and Ninia Baehr 
walked into the Hawaii Department of 
Health in Honolulu to apply for a mar-
riage license. 
They had met earlier that year in a 
Honolulu parking lot and felt an imme-
diate 
connection. 
Their 
first 
date 
lasted for 9 hours. They eventually fell 
in love and got engaged, despite know-
ing that the law prohibited their mar-
riage. 
They faced a choice: Give up their 
dream of getting married or take their 
fight to court to demand that they be 
treated equally. Although, up to that 
point, Ms. Dancel had led a private life 
and her family was unaware of her sex-
ual orientation, for her the choice was 
clear. She later recalled: ‘‘I had been 
discriminated against and was living as 
a second-class citizen. All of that, emo-
tionally, came to mind. For me it was 
a no-brainer decision. This was some-
thing I had to fight for, and I had to do 
my part.’’ 
The courts in Hawaii agreed with Ms. 
Dancel and Ms. Baehr. On May 5, 1993, 
the Hawaii Supreme Court issued a his-
toric decision that changed the course 
of the LGBTQ rights movement. It 
ruled that denying same-sex couples 
the right to marry violates the equal 
protection clause of the Hawaii con-
stitution unless the State could prove 
a compelling State interest. 
This ruling sparked a chain reaction 
that eventually resulted in the U.S. 
Supreme 
Court’s 
2015 
decision 
in 
Obergefell v. Hodges, which affirmed 
the right of same-sex couples to marry. 
It was a hard-won victory for the 
LGBTQ community in its long fight for 
equality. 
In July 2017, the Trump administra-
tion sought to undermine this victory 
for equality. It intervened in a court 
case to argue that LGBTQ individuals 
are not protected from employment 
discrimination based on their sexual 
orientation. This position directly con-
tradicted the position of the Equal Em-
ployment 
Opportunity 
Commission, 
which had made clear in 2015 that dis-
crimination based on sexual orienta-
tion was illegal. 
Last Monday, the Supreme Court re-
jected the Trump administration’s ef-
forts and held that the Federal civil 
rights statute prohibiting employment 
discrimination—title VII—does protect 
LGBTQ individuals. While the decision 
was another major victory for equality, 
the fight is far from over. 
The Trump administration has not 
only sought to undo protections for 
LGBTQ individuals before the court, 
but Donald Trump and Senator MCCON-
NELL have also been busy working to 
undermine LGBTQ equality through 
the judges—the judges whom this Sen-
ate confirms—themselves. 
Over the past 3 years, Donald Trump 
and Senator MCCONNELL
have been 
busy packing the court with judges 
who have demonstrated hostility to-
ward the rights of LGBTQ individuals. 
In fact, so far, about 40 percent—40 per-
cent—of Trump’s circuit court judges 
have anti-LGBTQ records, and another 
one, Cory Wilson, is set to be confirmed 
this week. As a State legislator, Wilson 
voted for a bill that would allow busi-
nesses and people to deny services to 
LGBTQ individuals. The Human Rights 
Campaign called that bill ‘‘the worst 
anti-LGBTQ state law in the U.S.’’ 
Another 
example: 
Recently 
con-
firmed to the Ninth Circuit, Trump 
Judge Lawrence VanDyke previously 
claimed that ‘‘same-sex marriage will 
hurt families, and consequentially chil-
dren and society.’’ His actions have re-
flected these views. He has opposed 
same-sex 
marriages 
and 
supported 
businesses that discriminate against 
same-sex couples. 
Similarly, 
Trump 
Judge 
Stephen 
Menashi in the Second Circuit and 
Trump Judge Andrew Brasher, Elev-
enth Circuit, have argued for the right 
of businesses to discriminate against 
LGBTQ individuals. 
With the Federal courts stacked with 
Trump judges like these, it is critical 
that Congress act now to fully enshrine 
equality and protections for LGBTQ in-
dividuals into law. 
The Supreme Court has now made 
clear that employers cannot discrimi-
nate against LGBTQ people in the 
workplace. But other legal protections 
against discrimination, such as in 
healthcare, education, housing, and fi-
nancial credit, are at risk of being 
eroded by the Trump administration 
and Trump judges. 
In fact, the Trump administration is 
doing just that. Just 2 weeks ago, it fi-
nalized a rule that eliminated non-
discrimination protections under Fed-
eral law for LGBTQ people receiving 
healthcare and obtaining health insur-
ance. 
Last month, the Trump administra-
tion issued a letter ruling that title IX 
requires schools to ban transgender 
students from participating in school 
sports based on their gender identity. 
In 2002, Congress renamed title IX in 
honor of my friend, Congresswoman 
Patsy T. Mink. Patsy was a champion 
for gender equality and nondiscrimina-
tion and would certainly be appalled by 
the Trump administration’s interpreta-
tion of title IX. 
The Trump administration has al-
ready banned most transgender people 
from serving in the military. It has re-
scinded protections for transgender 
students that allowed them to use 
bathrooms corresponding with their 
gender identity. 
The Trump administration’s attacks 
against LGBTQ equality make it all 
the more urgent that Congress needs to 
make explicit that Federal law pro-
tects against discrimination based on 
sexual orientation and gender identity. 
More than a year ago, the House did 
that by passing the Equality Act with 
bipartisan support. The Equality Act 
would prevent the Trump administra-
tion from exploiting any ambiguity in 
the law by adding clarifications in ex-
isting civil rights laws to make ex-
plicit that sexual orientation and gen-
der identity are prohibited bases for 
discrimination. This includes the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing 
Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 
the Jury Selection and Services Act, 
and other civil rights statutes. 
The Equality Act would also amend 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to prohibit 
discrimination in public places and 
services and federally funded programs 
on the basis of sex, including sexual 
orientation and gender identity. 
In addition, the Equality Act would 
update the types of public spaces and 
services covered under current law to 
expressly include stores, shopping cen-
ters, online retailers, banks, and places 
that provide legal services, transpor-
tation services, and other types of serv-
ices.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3139 
June 23, 2020 
The Equality Act is a critical safe-
guard against an administration deter-
mined to erode the rights of LGBTQ 
people. The Senate must do its job and 
pass the Equality Act without delay. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
complete my remarks before we recess 
for the lunch hour. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the 
last several weeks, Americans have 
marched, protested, and demanded jus-
tice not just for George Floyd but for 
Breonna Taylor and a long list of indi-
viduals who, unfortunately, had been 
killed while in police custody. While 
the energy behind this movement is 
not new, the problems that created it 
are also not new. We know that the ra-
cial injustices that have existed for 
generations and that originated during 
our country’s founding have created a 
whole range of problems that have con-
tinued to persist in our society—in ev-
erything 
from 
education, 
to 
healthcare, to housing. 
While I hope and expect we will have 
ongoing discussions about the most ef-
fective way to root out these inequal-
ities and provide equal justice, which is 
our Nation’s mantra and aspiration, 
one of the most important places to 
begin delivering these reforms is in our 
police departments. 
Across America, we have about 18,000 
Federal, State, county, and local law 
enforcement agencies. Some of these 
agencies have one officer, and some 
have as many as 30,000. It is safe to say 
that a one-size-fits-all approach would 
not work for all of them. The policies 
and practices that make sense for the 
Houston Police Department, for exam-
ple, are going to look a lot different 
than those of a small town out in West 
Texas. 
Yet there are basic practices and 
principles—best practices—that should 
be standard across the board, and they 
are something that Congress can help 
with. There are steps we can take to 
make our police forces more trans-
parent, more accountable, and better 
trained so as to, hopefully, avoid en-
counters like we saw with George 
Floyd and the Minneapolis Police De-
partment. While there are differences 
of opinion on the best way to deliver 
those changes, the good news—and 
there actually is good news—is that 
both Republicans and Democrats share 
this overarching goal. That is a strong 
start. 
A couple of weeks ago, our Demo-
cratic 
colleagues 
introduced 
their 
version of a police reform bill, and, last 
week, the Republicans introduced ours. 
While our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle seem interested in focusing 
on the differences, the truth is there is 
a whole lot in common, a whole lot of 
overlap. 
First are the changes in policing 
practices. As I mentioned, a one-size- 
fits-all approach isn’t the right meth-
od, but in some areas, there is a clear 
need for uniformity. One great example 
is training. Many police departments 
already require deescalation training 
and give them an array of tactics to 
cool down a potentially dangerous en-
counter. Both Republicans and Demo-
crats agree this should be the standard, 
and it is included in both bills. On the 
flip side, there are certain practices 
that should never be used, like choke 
holds. That is already the case in most 
major police departments—they ban 
choke holds. This bill ends that across 
the board. 
Reforming police practices is only 
part of the equation. In order to re-
store the broken trust between law en-
forcement and our communities, we 
need accountability, and these two 
bills take similar steps there too. They 
include a focus on diversity hiring so 
that police forces look a lot more like 
the communities they serve. They im-
prove hiring practices so that depart-
ments can move to effectively weed out 
weak or bad candidates and ensure that 
we have the best possible talent among 
our men and women in blue. 
Both of these bills take steps to bet-
ter educate officers on racial bias and 
the systemic challenges that face com-
munities of color. They take steps to 
promote transparency and to give the 
public greater access to information 
about America’s law enforcement ac-
tivities. 
Both bills require public reporting on 
use of force and require better informa-
tion on how law enforcement agencies 
are being run. They both prioritize re-
lationship building between law en-
forcement and the communities they 
serve. 
While there are some differences in 
the methods of achieving these shared 
goals, that doesn’t change the fact that 
we largely agree on the problems that 
exist, and that alone is not insignifi-
cant. 
Two weeks ago, Senator SCHUMER, 
the Democratic leader, called on Lead-
er MCCONNELL to bring a police reform 
bill to the floor before July 4, and, to-
morrow, we will do exactly what Sen-
ator SCHUMER requested. Now I hear 
that our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle aren’t interested in passing 
the JUSTICE Act as is, and I get that, 
but I have also been surprised by re-
ports that suggest they may just block 
us from proceeding to the bill alto-
gether, which, obviously, is not condu-
cive to our passing any police reform 
bill. 
Speaker PELOSI has made comments 
that I view as encouraging. She said 
she is interested in going to conference 
between the House and the Senate on a 
police reform bill. It is clear that our 
colleagues in the House are willing to 
work with us to come up with a con-
sensus bill, but that means the ball is 
now in the Senate Democrats’ court. 
The way I see it, they have two op-
tions. One is to work with us on a bi-
partisan basis. If the Democrats vote 
tomorrow to begin debating the JUS-
TICE Act, we can spend time looking 
at all of the areas in which we have 
overlapping goals and nail down spe-
cific solutions, and we can do what the 
Senate was built to do, which is to be 
a forum for debate, for offering amend-
ments, and for voting on those amend-
ments, which would, hopefully, im-
prove the product. If we are going to be 
successful in getting a bill to the Presi-
dent’s desk and delivering on the re-
forms we are after, we have to get on 
the bill tomorrow. 
Option No. 2 is for the Democrats to 
do nothing—to tell the American peo-
ple, even though they have said for 
weeks that they are desperate for ac-
tion, that they themselves are the ones 
preventing that action. I think the 
choice is pretty obvious, and I can’t 
imagine it is not obvious to our Demo-
cratic colleagues. These past several 
weeks have shone a light on the prob-
lems that exist within some of our po-
lice departments, and we have an op-
portunity to work together and show 
the American people we are capable of 
working together to try to address this 
national priority. We can officially 
begin this process with a simple ‘‘yes’’ 
vote here on the floor tomorrow. 
My simple request to our Democratic 
colleagues is to, please, please, work 
with us. Let’s debate the bill and con-
tinue to try to find common ground, 
and let’s get something we can be 
proud of on the President’s desk that 
he can sign into law without there 
being any more delay. 
Over the last several weeks, the 
American people have marched, pro-
tested, and demanded action. This 
week, we have an opportunity to de-
liver the changes they are requesting 
and ensure that ‘‘Equal Justice Under 
the Law’’ is more than just a phrase 
engraved on the Supreme Court build-
ing across the street. I am proud of the 
work we have been able to do in work-
ing with Senator SCOTT, who has led 
our efforts in the Senate. I thank him 
and Senator MCCONNELL for their com-
mitment to taking action and for Sen-
ator MCCONNELL’s willingness to do 
precisely what Senator SCHUMER
re-
quested in getting a police reform bill 
on the floor of the Senate before July 
4. 
We will have the opportunity tomor-
row to begin debating the JUSTICE 
Act. I can only hope our Democratic 
colleagues will make the right decision 
and commit to working with us to de-
liver real reforms. 
I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

NOMINATION OF CORY T. WILSON 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam Presi-
dent, it is an honor to speak on behalf 
of Judge Cory Wilson of Mississippi and 
in support of his nomination to the 
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
I have known Judge Wilson for many 
years. His experience and legal knowl-
edge make him an excellent choice to 
serve on the appellate court. Numerous 
colleagues of Judge Wilson’s from dif-
ferent backgrounds and political affili-
ations have risen in support of his 
nomination and spoken to his personal 
qualities. 
After 
his 
impressive 
nomination 
hearing and an outpouring of support 
from Mississippians, who know him 
best, there is no question that Judge 
Wilson will be a fair and impartial 
judge who follows the rule of law. 
Judge Cory Wilson will serve on the 
Fifth Circuit with honor, dedication, 
and distinction. 
I am also pleased a judge from Mis-
sissippi will mark a historic day as the 
200th Federal judge to be confirmed by 
the U.S. Senate during the Trump ad-
ministration. Judge Wilson’s confirma-
tion represents a pivotal point in the 
President’s work to ensure there are 
more smart, conservative jurists in the 
Federal judiciary. Under the leadership 
of President Trump and Leader MCCON-
NELL, the Senate has prioritized con-
firming bright, well-qualified men and 
women who will serve our country for 
years to come. 
I am proud to support Judge Cory 
Wilson and urge my colleagues to ap-
prove his nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4033 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I come to the floor today to urge the 
Senate to address the threat the 
coronavirus poses to our elections and 
to take immediate action to pass my 
legislation to ensure voters do not have 
to choose between their right to vote 
and their own health. 
Today is Election Day in Kentucky 
and in New York and in Virginia. There 
are runoff elections in North Carolina 
and in Mississippi, as well. As we 
speak, voters in the States are experi-
encing what it is to vote in the middle 
of a global pandemic. If the past few 
months are any indication, for many, 
casting a ballot today will not be safe, 
and 
it 
will 
not 
be 
easy. 
The 
coronavirus has caused unprecedented 
disruptions in the daily lives of Ameri-
cans. 
In order to protect voters and poll 
workers, this pandemic has forced us to 
make changes to how we vote. Sixteen 
States postponed their Presidential 
primaries or have transitioned their 
primaries to almost entirely voting by 
mail. We have seen Democratic and Re-
publican Governors across the country 
issue waivers allowing all voters to 
cast their ballots by mail during the 
pandemic. This includes States like 
New Hampshire, with a Republican 
Governor, and States like Ohio, where 
they have a Republican Governor who 
is focused on vote by mail, and States 
like Maryland, where the Governor has 
been devoted to vote by mail, and 
States like Missouri. 
While it is important that individual 
States are taking action to protect 
voters during this pandemic, we must 
remember that, in the end, this is a na-
tional pandemic. It is not just a pan-
demic in Vermont or in Utah; it is na-
tional. 
It is the responsibility of this Nation, 
of this Nation’s government, and of 
this Congress to ensure that States 
have the funds they need to make our 
elections more resilient and to make 
sure voters don’t have to risk their 
health to cast their ballots. 
When we have a national threat or 
international conflict, we do not expect 
an individual State to be able to re-
spond. In World War II, when Pearl 
Harbor was bombed, we didn’t say: Oh, 
Hawaii, you go deal with that yourself. 
We, in this Congress, have acknowl-
edged that this pandemic has national 
consequences in how we responded with 
the CARES Act and how the House has 
responded with the Heroes Act, which I 
hope we will consider very soon in this 
Congress, and just the fact that, when 
it comes to voting, this Congress, with 
bipartisan support—this Senate voted 
to give over $400 million originally to 
the States. 
There were some issues with how 
that money was given out that we are 
trying to fix, but, nevertheless, it was 
a downpayment on the fact that even 
in the beginning of the pandemic, based 
on what we had seen in Wisconsin, we 
anticipated that there were going to be 
problems for voting and that there was 
going to be a massive change in how 
our elections were held. 
You have States like New York State 
where only 5 percent of people have 
voted by mail in the past few Federal 
elections and States like my own State 
of Minnesota where, despite having the 
highest voter turnout in the country, 
only 25 percent of people on average 
voted by mail. Now you are seeing 
switch overs where 50 percent, 60 per-
cent of the people in every single State 
in the Nation are asking to vote from 
home or, in the alternative, they are 
asking for safe voting places by keep-
ing voting places open longer for early 
voting, by training poll workers so we 
do not depend on our senior citizens to 
be staffing the polling locations when 
they are the most vulnerable to the 
coronavirus. This is common sense. 
This is why you see Republican Gov-
ernors and Republican secretaries of 
state joining Democratic Governors 
and Democratic secretaries of state all 
across the Nation to ask for help from 
Washington. 
Today, in Kentucky, New York, and 
Virginia, election officials are putting 
more than $36 million of Federal fund-
ing to good use—funding to recruit and 
train new poll workers, to provide 
those workers with protective equip-
ment and sanitizing supplies; funding 
to pay for postage for mail-in ballots, 
purchase additional equipment, and 
cover the costs of moving poll loca-
tions to accommodate more people. I 
am proud of having fought to secure 
that funding. 
I appreciate Senator BLUNT, my col-
league, who I know is going to be here 
shortly and is the chair of the Rules 
Committee, for assisting in making 
sure that funding was designated, as 
well 
as 
Senator 
SHELBY, 
Senator 
LEAHY, Senator COONS, and so many 
others who have worked on this impor-
tant issue. 
It is a good first step, but let us re-
member these are still the primaries in 
a few States. If you talk to election of-
ficials across the country, they will 
tell you that it wasn’t enough and that 
they desperately need more resources 
for the general election when so many 
more people vote. Support from the 
Federal Government is vital because 
we have seen States struggle when it 
comes to administering elections dur-
ing the pandemic. We also know it is 
not as if they have a reservoir of fund-
ing right now to deal with, which is 
one of the reasons we want to pass the 
Heroes Act. 
Many of our State and local govern-
ments are struggling right now. That is 
why it is so important to designate 
funding as we move forward—and I 
hope we will soon discuss the Heroes 
Act—to be able to help pay for elec-
tions. 
Support from the Federal Govern-
ment is vital because we have seen 
States struggle when it comes to ad-
ministering elections. With fewer than 
6 months left before the general elec-
tion, Congress must act now to ensure 
that States have the resources and 
funding that they need. 
A lot of times you hear: Well, it is 
only 6 months, so why would we do 
funding now? Look at the fact that we 
were able to at least assure the States 
that the money was going to be out 
there for them a few months ago for 
the primaries, and they were able ei-
ther to spend their own money because 
they knew that money was coming or 
to spend designated money. That is 
how this works. 
We are no longer in a normal situa-
tion. We are in a situation where 
States are having to rearrange how 
they do elections all over the country 
to make it safe and to allow people to 
vote from home. We have seen the

chaos and disenfranchisement that will 
happen if we don’t act soon. 
The Wisconsin primary will forever 
be etched in the memory of our Nation. 
Voters stood for hours in the cold and 
rain, wearing garbage bags and home-
made masks, just to be able to exercise 
their right to vote. In Milwaukee, 
there were just five polling locations 
open instead of the usual 180. Almost 
600,000 people live in Milwaukee, in-
cluding one-third of that State’s Afri-
can-American population. The closure 
of so many polling places made it even 
harder for people without easy access 
to transportation to get to a polling lo-
cation, 
and 
it 
caused unnecessary 
crowding, with lines to vote wrapping 
around blocks. As a result, voters were 
disenfranchised, and some even con-
tracted the coronavirus. According to 
local health officials, nearly 70 people 
in Wisconsin who either voted in per-
son or served as poll workers con-
tracted the virus as a result of that 
election. 
Earlier this month in Georgia, thou-
sands of people went to the polls and 
were also met with long lines and con-
fusion. Reports from Atlanta indicate 
voters faced malfunctioning machines, 
and some voters never received the 
mail-in ballots they requested. Instead 
of being able to safely vote from home, 
many were forced to show up in person 
on election day. I was particularly 
struck by the words of Anita Heard, an 
80-year-old woman from Atlanta who 
actually marched with Dr. King. She 
was the first person in line at her poll-
ing location at 6 a.m. waiting to vote 
this year. Anita called the long lines 
and waits unfair and ridiculous. She is 
right. 
In Fulton County, one voter, who is a 
mom, sat on a lawn chair holding her 
infant son in one hand and umbrella in 
another. She waited more than 3 hours 
to vote. She wasn’t leaving because it 
was important to her and her son that 
one day she would be able to tell him 
she waited to vote for him. 
In America, people should not have 
to wonder if voting machines will be 
operational or if they are going to be 
able to receive their ballot on time to 
make it count. 
Jose Andres—the remarkable chef 
who helps feed people in areas struck 
by natural disasters—announced a plan 
to provide food, water, and resources to 
help people standing for hours in line 
on election day. He is doing his part to 
address this issue, as are so many peo-
ple across this country, including, as I 
mentioned, Democratic and Republican 
secretaries of state and Governors. 
I appreciate that Senator BLUNT, the 
chairman of the Rules Committee, is 
here. As I said, he worked to help us 
get that initial funding. Experts have 
warned that today in Kentucky we may 
see a repeat of the chaos that we have 
seen in early primaries. Reports indi-
cate fewer than 200 polling places are 
open in the entire State, down from the 
3,700 in a typical election year. We are 
glad that Kentucky has voted by mail 
and a number of people have voted 
from home. 
I think we also know, just based on 
what we have seen in these other 
States—this is just based on facts, not 
on partisanship—that 200 polling loca-
tions in a State of that size will not be 
enough in the primary and certainly 
will not be enough in a general elec-
tion. In order to protect the right to 
vote, we have to learn from States that 
are taking steps to make voting safe 
and easy. 
Primary turnout this year has bro-
ken records in many States, especially 
when it comes to voting by mail. 
States like Nebraska, Iowa, South Da-
kota, New Mexico, Idaho, West Vir-
ginia, and North Dakota have all held 
successful elections this year by rely-
ing heavily on voting by mail. Again, 
that is in a primary where some of 
these States have fewer voters—not all 
of them—because they are smaller pop-
ulation States, and many of them are 
not dealing with a general election. 
In West Virginia, mail-in ballots in-
creased from just 25,000 in 2018 to over 
200,000 this year. In Pennsylvania, the 
number of mail-in ballots cast in-
creased from 80,000 in 2018 to over 1.5 
million this year. Voters and election 
officials across the country in Red 
States and Blue States are turning to 
casting a ballot from home. 
In addition to the five States that al-
ready hold their elections mostly by 
mail, which are Utah, Oregon, Colo-
rado, Hawaii, and Washington—and I 
note that those States are not all Blue 
States, including, particularly, Utah, 
and Colorado, which is known as a Pur-
ple State—three States, including Cali-
fornia, Nevada, New Jersey, and also 
the District of Columbia have decided 
to send all voters absentee ballots for 
elections this year. There are 13 States 
that have decided to send all voters ab-
sentee ballot applications. 
These decisions weren’t made, as I 
note, on a partisan basis. Both Repub-
lican 
and 
Democratic 
officials 
in 
States have decided to implement 
these policies to protect their voters. 
I will also note that none of the five 
States that held their elections pri-
marily by mail this year have had 
major 
voter 
fraud 
scandals 
since 
transitioning to vote by mail. As the 
New York Times editorial board an-
nounced, States who use vote by mail 
encountered essentially zero fraud. 
Oregon, the pioneer in this area, has 
sent out more than 100 million mail-in 
ballots since 2000 and has documented 
only about a dozen cases of proven 
fraud. Rounded to the seventh decimal 
point, that is 0.0000001 percent of all 
votes cast. 
We have all seen the President’s 
tweets on this. We know these tweets 
are meant to hurt our democracy, and 
people shouldn’t fall for it because I 
just gave you the facts: 0.000001 percent 
of all votes cast in the States that have 
been using this forever involved any 
fraud. 
We must set the record straight. I ap-
preciate that Senator ROMNEY recently 
noted that nearly everyone, in what he 
called his very Republican State of 
Utah, votes by mail, and, in his words, 
it works very, very well. 
Now is the time to reject efforts to 
undermine our political system and 
mostly undermining people’s attempts 
to exercise their fundamental right to 
vote safely. What are you going to tell 
a veteran who has a preexisting condi-
tion, like the guy who wrote me who 
served in Vietnam and said what is he 
supposed to do now? We have to allow 
them to vote from home. 
In the midst of this pandemic, we 
need to make sure no voter has to 
choose between their health and exer-
cising their right to vote. That is why 
I am urging my colleagues to support 
my 
legislation 
with 
Senator 
RON 
WYDEN, which is cosponsored by 35 
other Senators, the Natural Disaster 
and Emergency Ballot Act, to help 
State election officials meet this pan-
demic head-on. 
Our legislation doesn’t require us to 
reinvent how we vote. Instead, our bill 
would overcome the challenges posed 
by the coronavirus by expanding exist-
ing election practices like voting by 
mail and early voting. It starts with 
guaranteeing every American the op-
tion to vote by mail. Sixteen States re-
quire voters to provide an excuse if 
they want to cast a ballot by mail. But 
during the pandemic, 13 of these States 
are allowing all voters to cast a ballot 
by mail without needing to provide an 
excuse—Democratic 
and 
Republican 
Governors and secretaries of states. 
That is progress. 
I would say, while we still have three 
States that are still denying all voters 
the option to vote by mail—forcing 
them to choose between their health 
and their constitutional right and go 
through these hoops to do it—why not 
put a standard in place on the Federal 
level? That is what our bill does. 
Our legislation would also get help to 
the States. Again, my friend, Senator 
BLUNT, is here, and I appreciate—while 
he hasn’t put a dollar amount on it, his 
interest in looking at funding for this 
beyond this bill, I think, is very help-
ful. 
Our bill called for $3.6 billion, which 
is what is in the Heroes Act, of funding 
to safely administer elections. It would 
knock down barriers, this bill, to safely 
vote, like the requirement to have your 
ballot signed by a witness or a notary. 
These are requirements that dispropor-
tionately hurt minority voters—people 
without as much money. 
There is one story of a person sitting 
in a hospital room trying to get some-
one to notarize a primary ballot 
through a glass window—someone who 
has coronavirus. Are we really going to 
require them to do that? Are we really 
going to do that? That is what you 
have to ask yourself, colleagues. The 
bottom line is, it shouldn’t be this hard 
to vote. 
I am proud that this bill has been en-
dorsed by more than a dozen organiza-
tions, including the group founded by

former First Lady Michelle Obama, in-
cluding Voto Latino, including the 
Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights, 
the National Urban League, Common 
Cause, the Leadership Conference for 
Civil and Human Rights. 
As I noted, the CARES Act included 
funding. It didn’t include the standards 
that I think are necessary but included 
the funding. That is just the beginning. 
That was a downpayment—negotiating 
in the middle of the night. I know that 
because I was talking to my colleagues 
back then. 
This is the real deal, to be able to 
help States in the general election. 
This money was included in the Heroes 
Act. Public health experts have warned 
over and over again of the possibility 
of a new wave of this virus in the fall. 
We have to be ready. States are having 
this happen anyway, and we should 
make sure that they have the funding 
to do it. 
I know we are going to be discussing 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act in the next few weeks, at some 
point. I think about that. Our defense 
is important, but, remember, this is 
about the defense of our democracy. 
The simple idea that this was a democ-
racy; that it is not a dictatorship; that 
people should be able to go out there 
and exercise their right to vote no mat-
ter how they are going to vote, no mat-
ter what party they are going to vote 
for, and this is the moment—and be-
cause of this pandemic, we need to do 
it. 
The last thing I will mention, three 
polls released in the last couple of 
months show an overwhelming major-
ity of voters—over 80 percent favor 
measures to make voting safe and easy. 
One of the polls conducted in six bat-
tleground States showed that 74 per-
cent of voters wanted their Senators to 
support legislation in Congress to im-
plement voting reforms, including a 
majority of Republican voters. Think 
about that. Voters across party lines 
want Congress to pass legislation that 
would guarantee the right to vote by 
mail and provide funding to States and 
make sure it is safe to vote. That is 
what this is about. 
Again, I thank my colleague, Senator 
BLUNT, for all he has done and the fact 
that he was able to work with us when 
we did negotiate the CARES Act to 
make sure there was some funding in-
cluded, as well as I mentioned Senator 
SHELBY, 
Senator 
COONS, 
Senator 
LEAHY, and others. Now is the time to 
prepare for what we have ahead; that 
is, making sure everyone can vote safe-
ly. 
Madam President, as in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Rules Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 4033, 
the Natural Disaster and Emergency 
Ballot Act of 2020, and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration. I 
further ask that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed and the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table, with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object and with 
great consideration for Senator KLO-
BUCHAR’s dedication on these issues, 
many of which, as she has pointed out, 
we have worked together on, and I 
think we will continue to, I just don’t 
think this is the time to make this 
kind of fundamental change. 
I will admit that at its very first leg-
islation after the 2018 elections, the 
House passed a bill, but, again, it was a 
bill that would provide the Federal 
Government with unprecedented con-
trol over elections in this country, de-
spite the fact that for almost 250 years 
now, the States have been responsible 
for this particular government respon-
sibility. To quote yet another time, 
Senator and then-President Obama, in 
October of 2016, pointed out that the 
very strength of our system was the di-
versity of the system. I think one of 
the strengths of the system is the 
amount of local responsibility and 
local answerability, frankly, for how 
the system works on election day. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR pointed out that 
we are fewer than 6 months until the 
election. As a matter of fact, in our 
committee, I intend to hold a hearing 
next month on the problems we have 
seen develop with this move toward 
more people wanting to vote not at the 
polling place on election day and how 
some States have dealt with those 
problems effectively and how others 
haven’t. 
I will also say, to follow up on one of 
Senator KLOBUCHAR’s points, I think 
funding is one thing. Helping the 
States help themselves is something I 
think we can still do. We have done a 
considerable amount of that up until 
now, since the 2016 elections, with a big 
commitment in the CARES Act to 
make money available for States to 
regulate their elections and be able to 
afford to do that. I think we can, will, 
and should take another look at that, 
but 6 months before an election is a 
dangerous time to change responsi-
bility. 
I think, to be absolutely clear, that 
at any time, this is a responsibility 
that is better done at the local level. 
But when you implement a new voting 
system with a big first election, that is 
a problem. 
We saw that in Georgia recently. 
Georgia was complying with the re-
quest that both Senator KLOBUCHAR 
and I and others had made to get a sys-
tem in place that has an auditable bal-
lot trail—an absolutely worthy goal. 
Georgia followed up, but even then, it 
might have been better if they could 
have followed up on an election that 
wasn’t quite the same high-profile, 
high-turnout election that their first 
experience had. 
The responsibility for changing the 
system is hard enough in the best of 
times. I think the States have had lots 
of time. My State and other States 
have changed their law to allow more 
access to absentee ballots in some 
States—and as a matter of fact, not 
even absentee ballots. I got corrected 
by that with one of our election offi-
cials the other day. Really, now we call 
them mail-in ballots. In Missouri, up 
until now, we always called them ab-
sentee ballots. Though, one of the ab-
sentee excuses had always been ‘‘un-
able to get to the polls because of 
health.’’ But in the mail-in ballot abil-
ity, in our State, to eliminate, for 
some ballots because of COVID–19 or 
health—eliminate the notary require-
ment, States have done this. They had 
a lot of time. They had a lot of notice. 
Most of them dealt with this. More im-
portantly, if it works, they get the 
credit. If it doesn’t work, they don’t 
have anybody else to blame. They are 
working really hard because of that to 
make it work. 
The House bill was offered the first 
time in this body not long after it 
passed. In March of 2000, I objected, 
again, to the federalization of the elec-
tion process—not the assistance, not 
the help but the federalization of the 
process. 
In May of 2020, the House passed yet 
another bill. I think that is the bill we 
are talking about today or something 
like it. This time, it was a bill that 
Democrats said would assist States 
with the pandemic. First, we were 
going to assist States because of ballot 
security. Now we are going to assist 
States because of the pandemic. 
There has been a real desire at the 
Federal level to take over the election 
process again. I don’t think that is a 
good idea. If it was a good idea, it 
wouldn’t be a good idea 6 months be-
fore the election. 
The provisions in the new bill are 
about the same as the provisions in the 
old bill. They would provide the Fed-
eral Government with unprecedented 
control over elections in this country. 
This bill represents a one-size-fits-all 
Federal answer to a problem that I 
think the Federal Government is not 
the best place to answer. 
The estimated money needs of the 
States are something I am willing to, 
and think we should, continue to talk 
about. But funding to accept the new 
situation they find themselves in is dif-
ferent than centralizing the process. 
Instead of providing States with 
flexibility to deal with emergency situ-
ations, for instance, this bill does just 
the opposite. This bill tells States how 
to run virtually every aspect of their 
election. It takes away authority to 
the States to determine their own 
process for voter registration. In fact, 
it requires all States to institute on-
line voter registration at a time when 
we are more concerned than we used to 
be about what can happen to elections 
online. 
This bill tells States how many days 
of early voting they must have and 
where the early voting locations need 
to be. It requires that all States accept 
online absentee ballot requests. You

have online voter registration. Then 
you have online absentee ballot re-
quests and offers the requirement for 
no-excuse absentee ballots, which I 
guess, according to my friend, the elec-
tion administrator, would be mail bal-
lots. I am going to get better at ex-
plaining that phrase. It tells States 
how and when their ballots must be de-
livered. It tells them when they have 
to be counted. It requires States to per-
mit ballot harvesting. 
Ballot harvesting is the only thing, I 
think in a decade, that a candidate 
elected to the House of Representatives 
was not seated because the House—this 
House, the current House of Represent-
atives—decided that ballot harvesting 
was the reason that person shouldn’t be 
seated; that people went around, col-
lected 
ballots, 
apparently 
decided 
which ballots they were going to mail 
in and which ballots they were not 
going to mail in—if you look at the 
House determination that this person 
wasn’t lawfully elected. But this bill 
actually requires States to allow indi-
viduals to go and collect ballots and 
turn them in, in groups rather than 
some other way. 
If States want to do that, they can do 
that. But apparently, it was not good 
enough to seat a Member of the House 
of Representatives from my party. It 
tells States how they must authen-
ticate their ballots. It prohibits them, 
however, from using any form of voter 
identification to authenticate who the 
person is. It tells States what kind of 
envelopes they have to use to put their 
ballots in. 
What doesn’t it do? It doesn’t recog-
nize, again, that for almost 250 years, 
States have successfully run elections 
in this country. If the returns were in 
question, the people who were the local 
election officials and the State election 
officials were the people who were 
questioned. There was no ability to say 
‘‘Well, that is out of our hands’’ or 
‘‘Well, we don’t really have anything to 
say about that. Some person in Wash-
ington tells us what we have to do 
about that.’’ 
States have successfully run elec-
tions during national disasters. States 
have successfully run elections during 
pandemics. States have successfully 
run elections during wartime. 
On March 3, 2020, on Super Tuesday, 
early that morning, a tornado struck 
three counties in Tennessee. Election 
officials were able to use the flexibility 
they had as State officials to, No. 1, ad-
just the polling location and, No. 2, 
move election equipment and carry out 
the primary election successfully and 
without challenge. None of that, in my 
view would have been allowed if this 
bill had been in effect. 
Similarly, in response to the pan-
demic, many States, as I suggested 
Missouri has, have changed their law 
and looked for ways to make this proc-
ess work. They have had a chance to 
try—in most cases already in the pri-
mary or in some other elections, States 
have changed their primary dates; they 
have expanded absentee balloting; they 
have expanded early voting; they have 
altered polling place procedures to en-
sure cleaning and sanitizing; and they 
have worked to recruit more workers. 
This bill, in my view, doesn’t ac-
knowledge 
the 
important 
responsi-
bility and answerability that local and 
State officials have on election day. 
That was a job I had for about 20 years, 
part of that as the chief election offi-
cial in the State. I will just state that 
on election day nothing is more impor-
tant than voters feeling like their vote 
was cast in the right way and counted 
in the right way, and there was nobody 
but me to blame at the county level 
and then again at the State level if 
that didn’t happen. 
So I think my friend Senator KLO-
BUCHAR’s comments are well-intended 
and well-motivated. I just think we 
have a fundamental difference on who 
makes these decisions. I would rec-
ommend to all of my colleagues that if 
we ever make these kinds of changes, 
we should make them long before 6 
months before a Presidential election. 
If this bill were law, State and local of-
ficials would not only lose the flexi-
bility they now have, but they would 
have a new place to pass the buck. 
This is one of the desks that Harry 
Truman used on the Senate floor, and 
he didn’t have a ‘‘pass the buck’’ sym-
bol yet, but he famously had behind his 
desk, as President, a sign that said 
‘‘The buck stops here.’’ On these issues, 
the buck stops with the person you 
have chosen locally and statewide to 
run your elections. I think that con-
tinues to be the best course for us to 
follow. 
Madam President, I object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I want to thank my colleague for his 
work and his friendship. We obviously 
don’t agree on every aspect of this. I 
did enjoy hearing his desk story. I 
didn’t know he had Harry Truman’s 
desk. When I got to the Senate, I asked 
for the desk of Hubert Humphrey, the 
‘‘happy warrior,’’ and about 8 months 
later, the desk arrived, and they had 
accidentally given me the desk of Gor-
don Humphrey, the former Senator 
from New Hampshire, and I had it for 
quite a while. In a new Senate, I one 
day opened up the desktop and saw 
that they had replaced it with the desk 
of Hubert Humphrey. So I would give 
these comments in the spirit of the 
‘‘happy warrior’’; that is, while you and 
I disagree on setting these standards, 
at this moment I think we should; I 
think if not now, when? 
When it comes to things such as not 
having notaries for getting a ballot and 
things like that, I am heartened by the 
fact that, No. 1, we have a hearing, 
which has been asked for—I think it is 
really important, and I appreciate 
that—on this upcoming election. 
No. 2, you continue to be open to dis-
cussing with me and with the Appro-
priations Committee the funding as we 
go into November. I think that is real-
ly going to be important for all voters, 
whether in red, blue, or purple States. 
We know that so many people vote by 
mail, including the President of the 
United States with a ballot from Palm 
Beach, FL. We all want to have that 
ability and make sure people in our 
States have an ability to either vote by 
mail or vote safely at the polling 
places this fall. 
Thank you very much. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today on the eve of 
what should be a routine vote in the 
U.S. Senate. Tomorrow the Senate is 
scheduled to vote on a motion to pro-
ceed to the justice reform legislation 
that we ought to be considering in the 
U.S. Senate. 
It is important to point out to the 
American people what that means. 
This isn’t a vote yet on passage of the 
bill. It is not a vote to end debate. It is 
not a vote to amend the debate. Any 
Senator can amend, vote no, or offer 
different substitutes for the bill. This 
isn’t any of those things. The motion 
to proceed is a simple and rather rou-
tine agreement to begin debate on a 
bill. Yet, here we are. It has turned out 
to be anything but routine. 
Senators on the other side of the 
aisle in this very Chamber are threat-
ening to filibuster the motion to pro-
ceed—filibuster even allowing us to de-
bate a bill of great importance to the 
Nation. 
In terms the American public might 
better recognize, the Democrats are 
threatening 
to 
filibuster 
the 
very 
issue—the very issue—that they claim 
to care about. If you listen to them on 
television, if you see them in the 
streets, talking to groups, they claim 
to care about it. Welcome to the bi-
zarre world of partisan politics and 
bankrupt leadership on that side of the 
aisle. 
On the same day that the minority 
leader will come to the floor to urge 
the Senate to pass justice reform legis-
lation, he will also attempt to rally his 
Democratic caucus to block even start-
ing a debate, and they seem to be fol-
lowing him, refusing to even debate an 
issue which is so key in the minds of 
the American people. He is telling his 
Members to filibuster the bill. 
Madam President, the JUSTICE Act 
deserves a debate. It deserves a debate 
for the American people to see and to 
hear and to watch on television. The 
American people deserve that. What 
they don’t deserve is partisan obstruc-
tion. What they don’t deserve is a fili-
buster. They need a debate. Amend the 
bill if necessary and then pass it. We 
want to try to stop what happened to 
George Floyd—a murder that we all 
witnessed—from ever happening again 
in America. 
The American people know that. 
They took to the streets, and now they

S3144 
June 23, 2020 
are turning their heads to Washington, 
to the Capitol, and saying: What can 
you do to make sure that something 
like this never happens again? 
We have a bill that addresses all of 
these issues, a bill that is ready to 
come for a debate. Yet, again, the 
Democrats are threatening and are 
likely tomorrow to vote one after an-
other after another to go up and vote 
no to even beginning debate on the bill. 
Incredibly, they began knocking this 
bill authored by Senator TIM SCOTT of 
South Carolina with many of us as 
original 
cosponsors—they 
began 
knocking this bill before they ever 
read it, before they knew what was in 
it. They attacked it before it was re-
leased. While the bill was still in the 
process of being written, they were at-
tacking it. Then Senator TIM SCOTT 
unveiled the legislation, and almost 
immediately the Democrats decided to 
agonize over whether to block it. They 
were agonizing over allowing a debate 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate—agoniz-
ing over a debate. I mean, you could 
hear them in the halls: I don’t know. 
Should we get on it? Shouldn’t we get 
on it? 
What was the issue? Racial justice. 
We need to be focusing on that and dis-
cussing it and passing meaningful leg-
islation that will make measurable 
progress. It shouldn’t be a tough call. 
Senator SCHUMER came and said: We 
should have a bill on the floor by July 
4. Here we are; it is before July 4. We 
brought the bill. It has a 70-percent 
overlap and agreement with what the 
House has to offer. 
Here we are, yet Senator SCHUMER is 
telling his Democrats to line up, one by 
one by one, and say: No, we don’t want 
to debate or even discuss your bill even 
though it has a 70-percent overlap in 
agreement with what the House of Rep-
resentatives is offering as a meaningful 
solution to a concern that all of us 
have. 
I don’t say this often, but Senator 
SCHUMER
ought to listen to NANCY 
PELOSI because the Speaker knows we 
are not that far apart. The Pelosi and 
the Scott bills share many of the same 
goals—much of the same underlying 
legislation. Senator SCOTT says that 
they agree 70 percent of the time on 
the issues. At one point, Speaker 
PELOSI said that she would love to go 
to conference with what we have going 
on in the Senate. The Wall Street Jour-
nal, last Wednesday, published a chart, 
and it showed just how similar the two 
bills are—the JUSTICE Act in the Sen-
ate and the bill that the House is work-
ing on as well. 
The Scott bill ensures that both Afri-
can-American communities and law en-
forcement communities are protected. 
This is precisely why the JUSTICE Act 
can and should become law. Without a 
doubt, this is our Nation’s best chance 
for change—best chance in 25 years. It 
is the best chance to put the 1994 Biden 
crime bill in the rearview mirror. It is 
a chance to pass meaningful reforms 
and a chance to make a law that actu-
ally makes a difference—a difference in 
communities all across the country 
and in the lives of people all around 
America. 
So Democrats will be asked to vote 
tomorrow, and they have a choice to 
make. They can continue to filibuster, 
to say ‘‘No, no, no, we don’t even want 
to get on the bill to debate it’’ or to 
offer amendments to improve upon it, 
to look for common ground. Or they 
can do what apparently they want to 
do, which is to continue the status quo, 
which is not what we need in America 
today. They ought to be embracing bi-
partisan reform. 
The JUSTICE Act is not—as one 
Democrat on this very Senate floor 
sadly described—a token. That is what 
he said on this Senate floor. This re-
form bill is serious. This reform bill is 
significant. This reform bill is substan-
tial, and we should pass it. At a min-
imum, we should at least debate it on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Democrats plan to filibuster simply 
debating the bill. They should be held 
accountable by the very American peo-
ple that they claim they are looking to 
help—claim they are looking to help. 
Well, they have an opportunity to help 
all American people when we vote to-
morrow. 
So I urge my Senate Democratic col-
leagues: Do not filibuster this historic 
bill. This is a wonderful opportunity to 
move our country ahead. We can build 
on the progress of the last 4 years—op-
portunity zones, permanent funding for 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities, the FIRST STEP Act. Let’s 
build on this record. Let’s debate it. 
Let’s amend it as we see fit, and then 
let us pass the JUSTICE Act and send 
it to the conference committee that 
Speaker PELOSI talks about, and then 
send a bill to the President of the 
United States and have it signed into 
law and help our country move ahead. 
Thank you, Madam President.

PROTESTS 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
the late historian, Arthur Schlesinger, 
Jr., said this: ‘‘Self-righteousness in 
retrospect is easy—also cheap.’’ The 
late Samuel Huntington, who was a 
Harvard professor of U.S. history and 
politics, wrote, in effect, that most of 
our politics is about setting great goals 
for ourselves—we, the American peo-
ple—and then the struggle we have 
with the disappointment we feel when 
we don’t reach those high goals, like 
‘‘all men are created equal.’’ 
Ben Hooks, who was from Memphis 
and a well-known citizen of our State 
and a good friend and once president of 
the NAACP, used to tell his students at 
the University of Memphis: 
Remember that our country, America, is a 
work in progress. We’ve come a long way, 
but we have a long way to go. 
It is in light of those three comments 
that I would like to discuss the effort 
that some people made last night to 
tear down President Andrew Jackson’s 
statue in Lafayette Square across from 
the White House. 
I believe it is always appropriate to 
review the monuments and the places 
that we name to see if there is a more 
appropriate name in the context of to-
day’s times. For example, in this Cap-
itol, every State has two statues. From 
Tennessee, it is Andrew Jackson and 
John Sevier. 
Senator BLUNT, who is the chairman 
of our Rules Committee, tells us that, 
at any given time, some of those stat-
ues are in rotation because the State of 
Mississippi or Tennessee or Oregon or 
some other State may have decided, in-
stead of those two individuals, we 
would like to send up another statue. 
We would like, in the context of to-
day’s times, to name somebody else. 
As we think about statues that are 
already named for generals in the Con-
federacy or the Union—a war that was 
fought a long time ago—it is appro-
priate, I think, to keep in mind that we 
have had a lot of wars since then: two 
World Wars, Korea, Vietnam. We have 
had a lot of very distinguished gen-
erals. We have had courageous Congres-
sional Medal of Honor winners. Maybe 
in the context of today’s times, there is 
a place for Camp MacArthur or Camp 
Eisenhower or Alvin C. York, who is a 
Congressional Medal of Honor winner 
and hero from Tennessee. It is always 
appropriate to review the places that 
are named and the monuments we put 
up to see if there should be a better 
name or a better place for a monument 
in the context of today’s times. 
But what about Andrew Jackson, 
whose statue is one that the State of 
Tennessee has sent here, whose statue 
is of him on a horse outside the White 
House at Lafayette Square? The simi-
lar statue is in Jackson Square in New 
Orleans. What about Andrew Jackson? 
Let’s make the case for Andrew Jack-
son. 
Presidential historians, almost with-
out exception, put him in the top 10 of 
America’s Presidents. They see him as 
the sophisticated, often subtle political 
actor that he really was. What they re-
alize—and, unfortunately, what only 
dedicated students of the American 
Presidency often realize—is that Jack-
son was arguably the most important 
American President between Thomas 
Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln be-
cause, much like Lincoln, he preserved 
the Union. If not for Jackson’s devo-
tion to the Union against his own local

political interest, the Union might well 
have fallen apart in 1832 and 1833. 
Jackson risked everything to keep 
our Union together instead of siding 
with South Carolina’s U.S. Senator 
John Calhoun’s doctrine of nullifica-
tion. When a serious conflict of crisis 
arose, when South Carolina decided 
that, following Calhoun’s doctrine of 
nullification, it could decide which 
Federal laws it could follow, it was 
Jackson who stood up and said: Our 
Federal Union must be preserved and 
Jackson who had the political will and 
the skill to make sure it was preserved. 
Jackson’s decisions as President gave 
us an additional three decades to form 
what Lincoln eventually called ‘‘the 
mystic chords of memory’’ in his first 
inaugural address. Surely—surely that 
is worth recognition. 
Andrew Jackson was our first non-
aristocratic President. When he was 
born in 1767, it was not possible or 
plausible that the young boy, orphaned 
at 14, could someday rise in an emerg-
ing Republic. Jackson wasn’t born rich. 
He wasn’t born into privilege. He 
fought for everything he had, and he 
rose to our government’s highest office 
through the sheer force of personality 
and political courage. That is the case 
for Andrew Jackson. 
Let us also recognize that Andrew 
Jackson was not perfect. In fact, he 
was at the center of the two original 
sins of this country: slavery and the 
treatment of Native Americans. But if 
we are looking for perfection, we are 
not likely to find it in American his-
tory or the history of almost any coun-
try or in human nature. 
The historian Jon Meacham, who 
won a Pulitzer Prize for his biography 
of Jackson and who wrote a biography 
of Thomas Jefferson, said that when 
Jefferson wrote the words, ‘‘all men are 
created equal,’’ he was almost cer-
tainly writing about all White men. 
Those were the context of the times for 
Thomas Jefferson. 
So what do we do about Jefferson if 
he was writing that all White men are 
created equal in the context of those 
times? What do we do about Jefferson, 
who—the only slaves that he freed, ap-
parently, were those that he fathered 
with his slave mistress, Sally Hemings? 
What do we do about George Wash-
ington and Mount Vernon and the 
slaves that he owned? What do we do 
about Abraham Lincoln, who some peo-
ple say was slow to act on emanci-
pation? What about Franklin D. Roo-
sevelt and his internment of American 
citizens who were Japanese in camps 
during World War II or, more recently, 
what do we do about Bill Clinton, who 
signed the Defense of Marriage Act, 
which would not be in the context of 
today’s times, if two recent Supreme 
Court decisions are to be followed, as 
they will be? 
Let’s not just pick on our Presidents. 
What are we going to do about the Con-
gress, the Senators, and the Members 
of the House? They approved the Trail 
of Tears, Andrew Jackson’s removal of 
the Cherokees to Oklahoma. The Con-
gress did. And they approved the laws 
requiring segregation. Congress did. 
And what about the people who elected 
the Congress? They approved those 
Members of Congress who approved of 
segregation, who approved of the in-
ternment of Japanese in camps. 
What are we going to do about us, the 
people of the United States? Do we pre-
tend that we didn’t exist during that 
history, when decisions were made that 
we would not make today or we would 
not approve of today, some of which 
would be abhorrent today? Do we try to 
burn down all the monuments, burn 
down Mount Vernon, burn down the 
Jefferson Memorial, Hyde Park, home 
of Franklin D. Roosevelt? Do we try to 
erase all of that from our history? That 
is not what we should do. We should 
not try to erase our history. We should 
not try to pretend it doesn’t exist. We 
shouldn’t ignore our history. 
Here is what I think we should do. 
No. 1, as I said earlier, recognize that it 
is always appropriate to review the 
places that we have named or the 
monuments that we put up—just like 
the monuments of States in here—to 
see if there is a more appropriate 
monument or named place that is ap-
propriate in the context of today’s 
times. Remember, as Ben Hooks said: 
America is a work in progress. It is al-
ways changing, and our monuments or 
the places we name can change with 
that. That is an appropriate, healthy 
exercise to go through. That is No. 1. 
But, No. 2, with the history that in-
cludes things we today abhor, we 
should try to learn from those things 
and build a better future. Let me give 
an example. 
Each year, I bring onto the floor of 
the Senate teachers of American his-
tory who have been selected to attend 
the Academy for Teachers of American 
History that I helped to create when I 
first came to the Senate. I thought it 
was important to learn American his-
tory so children can grow up knowing 
what it means to be an American. 
When they come to the floor, they 
look for the various desks because the 
desks of the Senate are what best de-
scribe them. They will go to find Dan-
iel Webster’s desk, which is still there. 
They will go to the back over there and 
find the desk that the three Kennedy 
brothers used, where they sat. The ones 
from Tennessee will come here because 
Howard Baker had my desk and so did 
Fred Thompson, the desk I now have. 
They are interested in the desks of 
Senator MCCONNELL and Senator SCHU-
MER because they are the leaders, and 
they go to Jefferson Davis’s desk. 
Jefferson Davis was a U.S. Senator 
who had a great deal to do with the 
building of this Capitol. But he, like 
many other U.S. Senators in the South, 
resigned from the Senate and joined 
the Confederate Army. Jefferson Davis 
became President of the Confederacy. 
When I take them to Jefferson 
Davis’s desk, these teachers of Amer-
ican history, this is what I tell them; 
that there is on that desk what looks 
like a chop mark. The story that is 
told is that it was created by a Union 
soldier who came into this Chamber 
when 
the 
Union 
soldiers 
occupied 
Washington, DC, and began to destroy 
the desk of a man who was the presi-
dent of the Confederacy, Jefferson 
Davis, until he was stopped by his com-
manding officer, who told him: Stop 
that. We are here to save the Union, 
not to destroy it. 
What do we do with Jefferson Davis’s 
desk? I say keep it there. I say to learn 
from it, to learn from the fact that 
there was a Civil War; that there was a 
Confederacy; that Senators left this 
body; that Union soldiers were here; 
that one wanted to chop it up and an-
other one would say, his commanding 
officer: Let’s bring a better future. 
Stop that. We are here not to destroy 
the Union but to save it. 
There are lessons in American his-
tory. There are lessons that we should 
learn. The lesson of Ben Hooks: We are 
a work in progress. We have come a 
long way. We have a long way to go; 
the lesson of Samuel Huntington, that 
most of our politics is about setting 
high goals for ourselves, that all men 
are created equal, and then dealing 
with the disappointment, struggling 
with the disappointment of not reach-
ing those goals, deciding what to do 
about it. 
Do we dishonor Andrew Jackson’s ef-
fort to keep our country together be-
tween Jefferson and Lincoln? Do we 
dishonor 
Thomas 
Jefferson’s 
elo-
quence? Do we dishonor George Wash-
ington’s probity in character or Lin-
coln’s courage or FDR’s grand leader-
ship during World War II all because 
they weren’t perfect, all because they 
did things and lived things and said 
things that today we wouldn’t say? I 
think not. Doing any of this would be a 
terrible misunderstanding of American 
history and of human nature. It would 
be ahistorical. 
In his first inaugural address, Abra-
ham Lincoln appealed to the better an-
gels of our nature. If there are better 
angels of our nature, I guess that 
means there must be worse angels in us 
as well, not just in Washington and 
Jefferson and Jackson and Roosevelt 
and great men or great women but in 
all of us. There are the better angels, 
and there are the worst angels. In this 
country, our goal is to bring out the 
best in us, which does not mean ignore 
the worst. 
We need to be honest about our 
weaknesses. We need to be proud of our 
strengths. We need to learn from both 
to create a better future for the United 
States of America.

consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
South 
Carolina. 
Madam President, I come to the floor 
to continue a conversation, a dialogue, 
about the importance of moving for-
ward on the motion to proceed on the 
JUSTICE Act. 
It was just an hour and a half ago, in 
front of the entire press corps, when I, 
Leader MCCONNELL, and the leadership 
team on the Republican side had a very 
open conversation with the press about 
fact that voting for this motion to pro-
ceed is voting for an open process. He 
said—and I agree—that this process 
must be open. I have asked that we 
have amendments, and the leader has 
said yes. 
So, to my friends on the other side 
who believe that somehow—in some 
way—this does not include an actual 
open process, wherein you have a 
chance over several days, in the sight 
of the public, to talk about and offer 
your amendments, that is wrong. If you 
want a process whereby you will have 
an opportunity to persuade those in 
this body and the American people 
about the value of your amendments, 
this motion to proceed is a motion you 
should vote for. More importantly, 
rather than persuading the American 
people that this is a motion to proceed 
that you should vote for, if you really 
want to get into police reform, we will 
need a vehicle with which to get there. 
The JUSTICE Act is that vehicle. 
Speaker PELOSI herself said—and I do 
not often quote Speaker PELOSI or even 
paraphrase 
Speaker 
PELOSI
about 
something that she and I might agree 
on, but I agree here—that it would be 
important for us to have a conference, 
which would require this body to pass 
legislation. Then it would go to con-
ference with the House. The only way 
we will pass legislation in this body is 
for there to be a bipartisan coalition of 
Republicans and Democrats, working 
together, because a majority of the 
Senate is not 51 out of 100. From a leg-
islative purpose, the majority of the 
Senate is 60 votes. That means we re-
quire 60 votes to even start the process 
of saying to little boys and girls in 
communities of color around this coun-
try: We see you. We hear you. 
I grew up in some impoverished com-
munities and in a single-parent house-
hold—mired in poverty. I understand 
how it feels to leave your home, get in 
a car, and be afraid of being stopped. I 
get that. I have spoken about that too 
many times already. What I will say is 
that this body has a chance to say to 
those kids: We see you. We hear your 
concerns. 
A motion to proceed is simply a pro-
cedural motion that says: Let’s debate 
the underlying bill. Let’s have a con-
versation in front of all of the Amer-
ican people about the importance of 
doing police reform the right way. If 
you don’t trust the Republicans or if 
you don’t trust the Democrats, you get 
to watch the process play out right 
here, within the world’s greatest delib-
erative body—you can watch it play 
out right here, live on C–SPAN—and 
come to your own conclusions about 
the seriousness of this issue. Yet if we 
miss that golden opportunity—if we 
miss the opportunity to debate the un-
derlying issues—all you will wind up 
with will be talking points and cam-
paigns. 
You see, some believe that one side 
would rather campaign on police re-
form than solve police issues. I believe 
that both sides of the aisle have vast 
majorities of people who are willing to 
come to the table to have a serious de-
bate on the underlying issues that have 
brought combustion into this Chamber 
and solve them, not have them explode. 
All of us do not have to tackle the 
issues like I did when I was 16 and 17 
and 18 and 25 and 26 and 30. We are all 
here now on this sacred ground, and we 
have the ability to say to that young 
man and to that young lady: We didn’t 
just see you. We didn’t just hear you. 
We acted on it. By doing so, I believe 
we can make a difference in the lives of 
Americans whom we actually save. 
There have been some criticisms. I 
sat in my office and listened to some of 
the criticisms about our JUSTICE Act 
by my friends on the other side. One of 
the criticisms was that the JUSTICE 
Act does not require new reporting 
measures on use of force. What? I sat in 
my office, speechless, because our leg-
islation 
absolutely, 
positively, 
un-
equivocally requires more information. 
The House bill has a 10-percent pen-
alty, and our legislation has a 20-per-
cent penalty, or twice the penalty. 
I heard that our legislation does not 
ban no-knock warrants, which is criti-
cally important because, in Louisville, 
KY, the conversation around no-knock 
warrants took a drastic turn in the 
wrong direction that led to the killing 
of Breonna Taylor. My friends were 
talking about how the House bill— 
their bill—bans no-knock warrants in 
drug cases, but when you open the leg-
islation and read the pages, what it 
does ban are no-knock warrants for 
Federal agents. In Louisville, KY, 
those were not Federal agents. So the 
complaint and the concerns about what 
actually helps situations in places like 
Louisville, KY, aren’t answered by the 
House bill. 
I will be honest. In our legislation, 
we want to get the data around no- 
knock warrants so that we can actu-
ally direct the resources and the deci-
sions in the right way. So, yes, you 
could say ours allows for a more delib-
erative process. Well, let’s debate that, 
and let’s come to an agreement. 
Next, I heard that the JUSTICE Act 
would not end choke holds and that 
their legislation would actually ban 
choke holds. Let’s take a closer look. 
That is false. With strict penalties fac-
ing local police departments, they go 
after choke holds by holding off on 
grant dollars for local agencies and 
State agencies. Our legislation does the 
exact same thing. We go after local de-
partments and State agencies by with-
drawing some grant dollars. 
What theirs says about the ban on 
choke holds applies only to Federal 
agents. That is really important. Why 
is that important? When you are 
watching at home, you hear there will 
be a ban on choke holds, but you don’t 
necessarily make the correlation or 
have the information to reach the con-
clusion that they are talking only 
about Federal agents. Why is that im-
portant? Because Eric Garner’s was not 
an incident with a Federal agent. It 
was not. 
For 700,000 of the 800,000 law enforce-
ment officers, the ban would not apply. 
That is really important information 
to share with the American people. 
Why is this so? It is called the Con-
stitution. It is a pesky, little thing 
sometimes, but it is a fact. The Con-
stitution does not allow for the Federal 
Government to dictate to those in local 
law enforcement what they can and 
cannot do. So they use the inducement 
of resources at the Federal level. 
I talked to 10 Democratic Senators 
today, and I told them all the same: 
Let’s get on the floor and amend the 
bill and see what happens. By the way, 
our legislation says the same thing. We 
instruct the AG to figure out how to 
ban it for Federal officers, and we re-
duce money and take money away as a 
penalty for those departments that 
have not banned choke holds. 
The President’s Executive order says 
that the certification process must in-
clude being certified by a governing 
agency that doesn’t look favorably on 
choke holds. So whether you are in the 
House or whether you are a Senate 
Democrat or Republican or are in the 
White House, we are all closing in on 
the same outcome. 
Here is what may be just as impor-
tant as the distinctions that, I hope, I 
have cleared up as to the differences 
that are not necessarily the biggest dif-
ferences on the important issues of 
what they said this morning was not 
what we were doing. I think selling 
something is important, but you can 
sell by manipulating or you can sell by 
motivating. I want to be clear that our 
legislation says what it says, not what 
others say it doesn’t say. 
Why am I so passionate about this 
issue? Beyond my 18 stops as a person 
of color, beyond my issues here in the 
Senate, beyond the fact that I am the 
one who grew up in poverty, in a sin-
gle-parent 
household—beyond 
that 
point—in my legislation, which is the 
Senate Republican legislation, and the 
House legislation, there is so much 
common ground on which we can work, 
and to lose this moment for the kids 
and the young adults who are watching 
this process would be terrible. Let me 
give you a couple of examples of what 
I mean by the things that we have in 
common. 
Both sides agree on more deescala-
tion training and on duty-to-intervene

training. Both sides agree on ending 
choke holds. Both sides agree on pass-
ing anti-lynching legislation. Oh, by 
the way, I and Senator GRASSLEY—the 
then-chairman of the Committee on 
the Judiciary—worked with Senator 
HARRIS and Senator BOOKER to get it 
passed not once in this Chamber but 
twice. It stalled in the House before it 
stalled over here. We got it done twice, 
and it is another area of agreement. 
Both sides agree on the importance of 
more minority hiring in law enforce-
ment. Both sides agree that more body- 
worn cameras are a good thing. We ac-
tually go further and have penalties for 
not having the body cameras on, but 
both sides agree. Both sides agree on 
the creation of a National Criminal 
Justice Commission, which, by the 
way, was the No. 1 recommendation of 
President Obama’s Task Force on 21st 
Century Policing. 
So why can’t both sides agree on a 
motion to proceed? If there is that 
much commonality in the underlying 
legislation, if we are all watching the 
same pictures that we have all found 
disgusting and unbelievable, why can’t 
we agree on tackling the issues in a 
substantive way here on the floor of 
the world’s greatest deliberative body? 
That is what we are supposed to do 
here. We debate the issues. I want the 
Nation to see; I want the public to see; 
I want the world to see; I want all of 
America to see our debating this issue. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. 
WYDEN. 
Madam 
President, 
across the country, there has been a 
national outcry for justice and for real 
changes in law to address police bru-
tality and reflect the undeniable truth 
that Black lives matter. 
This week should be our opportunity 
in the U.S. Senate to come together— 
Republicans and Democrats—to begin 
to fix our broken policing system, 
which is what so many people in big 
cities and small towns in Oregon and in 
every State across America are de-
manding of us. Yet, instead of allowing 
that kind of bipartisan discussion, 
Leader MCCONNELL is plowing ahead 
with partisan business, as usual, on a 
bill that falls very short of what the 
Senate ought to accomplish. 
I see my friend on the floor, Mr. 
SCOTT, the distinguished Senator from 
South Carolina. I want to make it clear 
that I have great respect for Senator 
SCOTT. He is an important member of 
the Senate Committee on Finance, on 
which both of us serve. I appreciate 
every opportunity to work with him. In 
fact, I think a fair number of people 
around the country will note the work 
we have just done in the last few weeks 
on nonprofit organizations. So we will 
be working together, I know, in the 
days ahead. 
Unfortunately, the majority leader is 
giving short shrift to this debate on 
ending systemic racism by putting for-
ward an inadequate bill and essentially 
daring the other side to oppose it. That 
is not the way you bring together both 
sides to address big, important na-
tional challenges. 
Let me take just a few minutes to 
talk about some of the specific short-
comings of the legislation that Senator 
MCCONNELL wants to bring to the floor. 
For example, how can 100 Senators not 
agree that choke holds are wrong and 
ought to be banned? That is what my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
and 
I 
have 
called for: a nationwide ban on choke 
holds, period—full stop. 
The Republican bill does not take 
that same strong, firm position. In my 
view, you cannot equivocate when it 
comes to a reform as basic as banning 
the choke hold. Anything short of a 
ban creates loopholes for the use of 
choke holds, and that is the wrong way 
to go for our country. 
Second, this bill doesn’t create any 
real accountability for police mis-
conduct. It doesn’t set up independent 
investigations for prosecutions of po-
lice abuses. It doesn’t create national 
standards for law enforcement. It does 
not end qualified immunity. 
Those issues are right at the center 
of the challenge of reforming policing 
in America, and they are the issues the 
American people want to see addressed 
head-on. 
A lot of what the majority’s bill— 
Senator MCCONNELL’s bill—does with 
respect to police conduct is essentially 
collecting data. Nobody is protesting 
collecting data. What people are pro-
testing on is they want to save lives. 
The Senate ought to do better and 
make those real changes that improve 
public safety. 
Third, the extreme militarization of 
our police forces in recent years. It is 
actually an issue that goes back more 
than a few years, but the danger of a 
military mindset in domestic law en-
forcement was never more clear than 
when Trump officials started talking 
about ‘‘dominating the battle space.’’ 
Our communities are not war zones; 
our citizens are not enemy combatants; 
and our police officers should not be 
occupying forces, so why has the 
United States undergone this years’ 
long military mobilization on its own 
streets, against its own people? 
It is long past time for this to end 
and for all our communities to insti-
tute 21st century community policing 
policies, but the Republican bill does 
not do that either. 
The truth is, Senator SCOTT’s bill 
does take a few good steps, like estab-
lishing the duty to intervene and mak-
ing lynching a Federal crime. Those 
are issues that I and other Democrats 
would like to work on with Senator 
SCOTT
on a comprehensive bill, but 
that is not what Senator MCCONNELL 
has put on offer this week. 
My concern is that if the Senate 
takes up the McConnell bill, it is going 
to just be business as usual under the 
Republican leader: a short debate cut 
off arbitrarily, not enough votes, and 
not enough improvements to the actual 
bill. I just don’t believe that, when mil-
lions and millions of Americans are de-
manding more, that business as usual 
is somehow acceptable. 
That video of the murder of George 
Floyd at the hands of police stirred a 
part of America’s national conscious-
ness. There have been peaceful protests 
in all 50 States over the last few weeks 
calling for us to stamp out racial injus-
tice—people of all ethnicities, of all 
ages, all genders. It has been a rare dis-
play of common purpose and common 
engagement in America. 
As Senators, we have an obligation 
to respond to that call with something 
significantly better than business as 
usual. I know that Senator SCOTT 
wants to get there. I know that my 
Democratic colleagues and I want to 
get there. 
I am proud to support Senator BOOK-
ER and Senator HARRIS, who have been 
doing outstanding work on this issue, 
and I know that, regardless of the out-
come of tomorrow’s vote, we are going 
to keep working. 
As for this week, the Senate would be 
wrong to just rush this process and just 
check the box with a partisan process, 
a partisan approach, before shrugging 
its shoulders and moving on to the 
task of dealing with more far-right 
judges. 
So I am going to vote against clo-
ture. I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Min-
nesota. 
VOTING 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today and thank my colleague 
from Oregon and also thank him for his 
work on the voting bill. We just had a 
discussion with Senator BLUNT about 
that, and while we didn’t agree on the 
bill, there is a discussion that is ongo-
ing—as we head into another COVID 
package, possibly, which we really be-
lieve we need to—on working on some 
funding issues for the States as we look 
at more and more balloting from home 
and how important that is. 
I want to thank Senator WYDEN for 
his leadership for so long on that issue. 
I brought up his home State in a 
speech about an hour or so ago and the 
work that Oregon has done with ballot- 
by-home and, I think, ballots from 
home. 
I actually think I used the number of 
percentage of fraud as 0.0000001, or 
something like that, to show that what 
the President said is not true; that we 
have had, actually, in many States 
across the country—including Utah, a 
redder State—a big success with voting 
from home. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. President, I rise today on an-
other matter, and that is to urge the 
Senate to consider meaningful, com-
prehensive legislation to make sys-
temic changes to our justice system 
that will save lives—save lives in the 
Black community and save lives in all 
communities of color that have experi-
enced injustice for far too long.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3148 
June 23, 2020 
I am deeply concerned that the bill 
on the floor this week fails to meet 
this moment. It has been nearly 1 
month since George Floyd was mur-
dered in my State. We all watched as 
his life evaporated before our eyes. It 
was a horrible thing. 
People who watched it, whether they 
were in law enforcement or whether 
they were just regular citizens who saw 
this, it hit home to many of them for 
the first time—and many of them, 
sadly, in the African-American com-
munity for many, many times before 
that—how truly unjust this is and how 
immoral this is. 
His death was horrifying and inhu-
mane, and it galvanized a nationwide 
movement for justice. 
As Members of the U.S. Senate, we 
have a responsibility to respond to that 
call with action, and that means, when 
you have systemic racism, that you 
must address it with systemic change. 
Some of that is happening in our 
State and local governments. That is a 
good thing. But some of that must also 
happen here. This is not just an issue 
for one city or one State—my home 
State—nor is it an issue at just the 
local level. There is a lot of work that 
needs to be done at the local level, and 
that has been acknowledged by mayors 
and police chiefs across the country. 
There is also really important work 
that we must do here. I was proud to 
join my colleagues in introducing the 
Justice in Policing Act, led by Sen-
ators BOOKER and HARRIS, which makes 
comprehensive changes to our justice 
system that are long overdue. 
These reforms—including police offi-
cers being held accountable for mis-
conduct, reforming police practices, 
and improving transparency—will be 
good for our Nation. The Justice in Po-
licing Act will help to prevent more 
tragedies like those we have seen—pre-
vent murders. 
It is widely supported by groups like 
the NAACP, the Leadership Conference 
on Civil and Human Rights, and the 
National Urban League. 
The House is expected to pass the bill 
this Thursday. Then it comes over 
here. But instead of taking up that bill, 
the Justice in Policing Act, Leader 
MCCONNELL has brought a different bill 
to the Senate floor: the JUSTICE Act. 
My problem with it is, despite the 
name and despite a lot of the words 
that we are hearing on the other side, 
it doesn’t get us to where we need to 
be. In this moment, as people are still 
marching and demanding change, we 
cannot confront these urgent issues 
with half measures or equivocation. 
I have serious concerns that this bill 
does not respond to the nationwide call 
for justice. Unlike the Justice in Polic-
ing Act that is going to pass the House, 
the bill we are considering here in the 
Senate 
lacks 
critical 
reforms 
to 
strengthen Federal pattern-and-prac-
tice investigations, a reform that is ur-
gently needed after we all saw the 
video of the police officers standing 
right next to each other with George 
Floyd pinned down—pinned to the 
ground. 
I have called on the Department of 
Justice, with 26 other Senators, to con-
duct a full-scale investigation into the 
patterns and practices of the Min-
neapolis Police Department, and any 
bill that we consider should make sure 
the Civil Rights Division has the au-
thority and the resources they need to 
conduct a thorough investigation. 
By the way, our calls have still gone 
unheeded. During the Obama Justice 
Department time period, 25 of these 
cases—pattern-and-practice investiga-
tions—were brought. During the Trump 
Justice Department time period, just 
one unit of the Springfield, MA, Police 
Department went through a pattern- 
and-practice investigation. 
I don’t know what more proof we 
need than the fact of the video and the 
fact that there were other officers 
standing nearby, the fact that we have 
called for this with 26 Senators but, 
still, we await any final word from the 
Justice Department. 
They have informed us that they are 
still looking at this, but in the mean-
time, our Department of Human Rights 
in the State of Minnesota is stepping in 
to fill the void. I don’t think that is 
the ideal way to do it. You would like 
a Justice Department that has experi-
ence doing this in other jurisdictions, 
but our State’s Department of Human 
Rights is now stepping in and con-
ducting its own pattern-and-practice 
investigation. 
The bill on the floor fails to help 
States conduct their own investiga-
tions, as I just mentioned, to address 
systemic problems in culture, training, 
and accountability at police depart-
ments, like what the Minnesota De-
partment of Human Rights is now con-
ducting. By the way, with the proper 
resources and the experience they are 
gleaning from former Justice Depart-
ment officials and the like, this is one 
way to handle some of this, in addition 
to the Justice Department. 
At a time when our Justice Depart-
ment has failed to take up these inves-
tigations, this provision that is in the 
Justice in Policing Act is even more 
critical. 
We must also take action to put an 
end to practices that unnecessarily put 
people’s lives at risk. I worked with 
Senator GILLIBRAND and Senator SMITH 
of my State on provisions in the Jus-
tice in Policing Act to ban Federal law 
enforcement officers from using choke 
holds and other neck restraints and to 
prohibit States from receiving certain 
Federal 
funding 
unless 
they 
have 
passed laws to ban these practices. 
We have used this method in the 
past, and if there is significant funding 
attached to it, States will react. 
The bill on the floor this week from 
our Republican counterparts only bans 
certain types of choke holds—those 
that restrict airflow but not blood 
flow—and only in certain situations. 
This does not go to the point that we 
need it to go to get the kind of sys-
temic change we need in our criminal 
justice system. 
Critically, the Republican proposal 
does not include necessary changes to 
hold individual officers accountable for 
misconduct, like making records of po-
lice misconduct public. Real change 
comes with accountability and, as 
drafted, the Republican bill does not 
provide it. That is why it is opposed by 
civil 
rights 
and 
criminal 
justice 
groups, and it is why the attorney for 
George Floyd’s family—and I had the 
honor of speaking with George Floyd’s 
family—has said that this bill is ‘‘in di-
rect contrast to the demands of the 
people.’’ 
So where do we go from here? Well, 
we can start by calling up the bill that 
will be coming over from the House. We 
can start by agreeing to work together. 
Let’s have a bipartisan process to de-
velop the consensus bill that we need 
based on the bill that is going to be 
coming over from the House. 
As a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I have seen what happens when 
we work together to get something 
done. That is how we passed the FIRST 
STEP Act, which passed the Senate 
with a vote of 87 to 12 by reaching 
across the aisle and by actually doing 
something—not just a bill full of plati-
tudes or studies but actually doing 
something, which is what the people 
are calling out for now. 
By the way, there are a lot of good 
police officers out there, including ones 
who work around us, and when you put 
strong standards in place, they meet 
those standards. 
To allow that conduct that we saw on 
that video to go without national 
changes to our policing would be just 
to say, well, it is just this incident in 
Minnesota, which, of course, is being 
prosecuted by our attorney general, 
Keith Ellison. That is how you could 
resolve it if you thought it just hap-
pened once and it just happened in one 
State, but we know that is not true, 
my colleagues. We know that is not 
true. That is why it is so important to 
take action and pass the actual bill. 
We already started this process in 
the Senate Judiciary Committee. Last 
week, we held a hearing on these 
issues. We heard testimony from local 
leaders like St. Paul Mayor Melvin 
Carter and law enforcement officers 
from across the country. 
I heard a lot of agreement among 
many of those who testified—not all of 
them but many of them: support for 
banning choke holds, establishing a na-
tional use-of-force policy—these are 
police chiefs—creating a public data-
base of public misconduct, and ensur-
ing independent investigations of po-
lice-involved 
deaths, 
something 
I 
pushed for in my former job. 
You cannot have the police depart-
ment that the officer works for inves-
tigating this conduct. That is wrong, 
as I said publicly years ago. 
There are areas where we can find 
agreement, but we have to mean it.

that he hopes the Judiciary Committee 
could consider what has been proposed 
and ‘‘come up with something in com-
mon.’’ 
Well, we start with the bill that is 
going to be coming over from the 
House, the bill that has been sponsored 
in the U.S. Senate by Senators BOOKER 
and HARRIS. 
Instead, Leader MCCONNELL is asking 
us to consider a bill that was drafted in 
their caucus, yes, but without the 
input of so many of us who have seen 
firsthand the damage that has been 
done here. He is, then, moving that bill 
directly to the floor instead of letting 
the Judiciary Committee consider it. I 
think that fails to make the kind of 
meaningful change we need in our sys-
tem. 
This is a moment for urgent action, 
but it is also a moment for funda-
mental change. If we respond to all of 
those people out there and the family 
of George Floyd—whom I got to meet 
and sat across the pews from at that 
memorial service—if we respond with 
silence, then we are complicit. If we re-
spond as the President has suggested, 
with dominance and by waving a Bible 
in front of a church for a photo op, 
then we are monsters. 
If we respond with action—meaning-
ful action—colleagues, then we are law-
makers, and that is what the people of 
our State sent us to do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
want to thank the Senator from Min-
nesota for her ongoing leadership on so 
many issues and, certainly, this is one 
of them. We greatly appreciate and 
need your voice. 
Mr. President, for over the past 
month, Americans in all parts of our 
country and from all walks of life have 
once again been marching for the cause 
of justice. They are raising their voices 
and raising the names of those killed 
by police violence: Eric Garner, Mi-
chael Brown, Freddie Gray, Breonna 
Taylor, George Floyd, and Rayshard 
Brooks. 
Americans aren’t marching because 
of politics. They are not marching be-
cause they want the Senate to pretend 
to address this issue and hope it goes 
away. Americans aren’t marching be-
cause they want more studies and re-
ports. No. Americans from all walks of 
life—young and old, people of all back-
grounds, religions, and nationalities— 
are marching because they are sick and 
tired of learning about more names. 
They want the people who represent 
them here in this Chamber to finally 
confront this deadly serious issue with 
the seriousness it deserves. 
It is time we meet their expectations 
in this historic moment. This really is 
a historic moment. It is a historic op-
portunity for all of us to come to-
gether. It is past time to do something 
to stop the violence. It is time to come 
together and to do something big and 
consequential, and it is going to take 
all of us to be able to do that. 
Just think about the big things we 
have been able to get done in the past 
decade or so. I am not trying to equate 
this current moment and this serious-
ness, but I know we know how to do 
other big things. The Presiding Officer 
knows that too. We do things across 
the aisle. We work across the aisle 
when we want to get things done. 
I think about passing a farm bill, a 5- 
year farm bill. A lot of people said we 
couldn’t get it done because of all the 
different interests—the interests of 
families and food assistance, the inter-
ests of farmers and ranchers and so on. 
I had my doubts during those times, 
but we kept on working in a bipartisan 
way, and in the end we got a bipartisan 
bill that was good for farmers and our 
families, good for our environment, 
good for our economy. In fact, we 
passed it with an 87-to-13 vote, which is 
the most votes we have ever had in the 
Senate for a farm bill. 
Police violence and the systemic rac-
ism that is behind it deserves at least 
the same bipartisan effort that we gave 
the farm bill. In much the same way, 
the Senate came together across the 
aisle and got comprehensive immigra-
tion reform done. That only happened 
because people sat down together with 
different 
views—Republicans 
and 
Democrats—and worked through the 
complicated issues that were standing 
in our way, and we got it done in the 
Senate. 
Police violence and the systemic rac-
ism behind it deserve at least that 
same bipartisan effort. 
More recently, there was the CARES 
Act. 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
worked day and night to come together 
in agreement on the most effective way 
to meet the needs of Americans during 
an unprecedented health and economic 
crisis—which, by the way, we need to 
do again because we are not done. 
Police violence and the systemic rac-
ism behind it deserve at least that kind 
of effort. This is a huge crisis that 
pulls at the very soul of America. This 
issue certainly deserves the best of all 
of us right now, the best of what we 
can do. 
Systemic racism and related police 
violence certainly deserve, at min-
imum, the same kind of bipartisan ef-
fort we have focused on other issues 
that have not had the life-and-death 
consequences of this issue. 
The people who are marching and 
who are crying out for justice deserve a 
serious response at a serious moment. 
Leader MCCONNELL needs to take this 
issue seriously and support a bipar-
tisan process, instead of just moving to 
a weak, flawed, Republican bill just to 
pretend that he tried to do something. 
The House of Representatives are se-
rious. They are passing a bill this week 
and sending it over to us. It is a serious 
bill. I am proud to be a cosponsor of 
the Senate version with our leaders 
Senator BOOKER and Senator HARRIS. 
They are serious about passing the Jus-
tice in Policing Act. 
Senate Democrats are serious. MITCH 
MCCONNELL
and Senate Republicans 
must be serious too. This is the mo-
ment. This is the moment for us to be 
serious together and address this in a 
big, profound, systemic way. 
Eric, 
Michael, 
Freddie, 
Breonna, 
George, Rayshard, and all of those who 
are no longer with us, as well as all of 
those marching, marching, marching 
and speaking out deserve nothing less 
than our best at this moment. They de-
serve a serious bipartisan effort. That 
is what I support. That is what my 
Democratic colleagues support. 
We know it takes sitting down and 
listening to each other. It takes work-
ing out differences. That is the only 
way change happens. We are willing to 
put in whatever time and effort it 
takes to make this happen, and that is 
what we are going to continue to fight 
for. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, if 
you walk outside this building and 
take a few steps toward the White 
House, you can almost hear the cries 
for justice still ringing out through the 
air; you can almost still smell the tear 
gas lingering over our Nation’s Capital. 
Listen closely and you might still be 
able to catch the echoes of the peaceful 
protesters 
chanting 
the 
name 
of 
Breonna Taylor, who was killed in her 
own home after police executed a no- 
knock warrant; or the name of George 
Floyd, who was forced to beg for his 
life until he couldn’t beg any longer, 
held down under the knee of a police 
officer who swore an oath to protect 
and serve; or Rayshard Brooks, who 
was shot in the back just 11 days ago, 
even as this moment of national reck-
oning over police brutality was already 
under way. 
For nearly a month now, Americans 
have been lying down, standing up, 
kneeling, marching, and mourning in 
the streets. They have been tugging at 
and prodding our country, trying to 
drag it forward until it lives up to the 
words of its Pledge of Allegiance that 
in this Republic, there is ‘‘liberty and 
justice for all.’’ 
So far, this Nation has failed to make 
the promise a reality for Black Ameri-
cans. It has failed the families of 
Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and 
Rayshard Brooks. It has failed every 
Black child who knows that playing on 
a jungle gym could be a death sen-
tence. It has failed every Black parent 
who kisses the top of their child’s head 
before school each morning as their 
heart breaks with the knowledge that 
this time could be the last. 
I know that I would never be able to 
fully comprehend the fear and trauma

June 23, 2020 
that Black Americans experience every 
day. But what I do know is that the 
burden of this pain can’t fall on them 
alone. The responsibility, the work of 
bending the moral arc of the universe 
toward justice can’t just be put on the 
backs of those who have been feeling 
its weight this whole time. Rather, it 
is on all of us—Black, White, Asian, 
Latinx, you name it—to help those 
families and communities finally re-
ceive the justice they deserve. 
But I come to the floor today because 
my Republican colleagues are trying to 
force through a bill that barely even 
pays lip service to the crisis at hand. In 
some ways, it doesn’t even accomplish 
that. In spite of its name, the JUSTICE 
Act wouldn’t begin to bring any sem-
blance of real justice to the victims 
from Minneapolis to Atlanta to Louis-
ville and beyond. 
It should be obvious by now that the 
epidemic of police brutality will not be 
fixed by some bandaid bill. We need to 
reckon with the real, deep, uncomfort-
able realities and systemic biases that 
have marred our country for years. We 
need to bring systemic change to our 
law enforcement agencies. We need to 
force a seismic shift in how we root out 
and respond to police brutality, includ-
ing banning choke holds and no-knock 
warrants in drug cases at the Federal 
level. My friend Senator BOOKER has 
introduced legislation that would do 
just that; the Republican bill would 
not. 
We need to hold accountable officers 
who break the laws they were trusted 
to enforce, ensuring that independent 
prosecutors review police uses of force 
and prosecute officers who act irre-
sponsibly, recognizing that local pros-
ecutors often have a conflict of interest 
because they rely on the same police 
departments to win other cases. I have 
written legislation to do just that, 
which has been included in the Demo-
cratic bill, but the Republican bill 
would not do anything close. 
We need to amend Federal law on 
qualified immunity so that officers 
can’t just violate Americans’ constitu-
tional rights with mere impunity, and 
we need to mandate anti-bias Federal 
law enforcement training. Democrats 
have put forward policy that would do 
all of that. The Republican bill refuses 
any such attempt at accountability 
and wouldn’t even ban racial profiling. 
It comes down to this: Real justice, 
real accountability requires these re-
forms. Yet the JUSTICE Act itself is 
silent on so many of them. The so- 
called ‘‘reform’’ bill aims more at re-
forming public opinion than actually 
reforming the policies that got us here. 
The families grieving today deserve 
better, as George Floyd’s family made 
it clear when they themselves spoke 
out against the bill. They know that 
those who had a loved one stolen from 
them deserve more than just lip serv-
ice. They deserve for their Senators, 
for the officials elected to represent 
them in what is supposed to be the 
world’s greatest deliberative body to 
try to pass legislation that would actu-
ally address the issues in question and 
the crisis at hand. 
Look, next week our country will cel-
ebrate its Independence Day. What 
does freedom for any one of us mean if 
so many of our neighbors still are not 
free to walk down the street or sleep in 
their own homes without fearing for 
their lives? Until every Black Amer-
ican can breathe without a knee on 
their neck, no American should feel as 
if we are truly able to take a breath 
ourselves. 
The Republican bill that we are ex-
pected to vote on tomorrow isn’t just a 
disappointment. It leaves Black Ameri-
cans in unnecessary danger. And set-
tling for lip service when lives are at 
stake isn’t just inadequate. It is cruel 
too. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my friends, KAMALA HARRIS 
from California and CORY BOOKER from 
New Jersey, for leading us in this fight 
for so many years. 
I remember well when I first went to 
work for the city and county of Den-
ver. One of the first tragedies that we 
had in the city at that time was the 
shooting of a young man named Paul 
Childs in Park Hill by police under cir-
cumstances that should never have 
happened. That was almost 20 years 
ago, 
but 
these 
headlines 
haven’t 
stopped. If anything, matters have got-
ten worse. 
As the country has grappled with the 
pandemic over the last few months, I 
heard a lot of people talk about how it 
has revealed a profound sense of in-
equality in our country, how it has ex-
posed all this injustice in the United 
States of America. 
We should not have needed a pan-
demic to expose the injustice that ex-
ists in the United Stated of America. It 
should not have taken a pandemic to 
alert people to the injustice in our 
country. If you have been paying any 
attention, if you have listened at all to 
the Black voices in the United States 
of America, then you know these injus-
tices have been with us for generations. 
In the case of our law enforcement 
system, they have literally had life- 
and-death 
consequences 
for 
Black 
Americans, and it just keeps hap-
pening. One reason it keeps hap-
pening—the one reason it happened to 
Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, or 
George Floyd—is that what happened 
to them would never happen to my 
three daughters; what happened to 
them would never happen to me. It has 
never occurred to me once, when I am 
walking around my neighborhood in 
Denver, that what happened to them 
could happen to me or my children. 
That is what is meant, in part, by 
White privilege—a privilege that al-
most everybody in this Chamber en-
joys. 
I think we can never accept that we 
live in a country where one group of 
people is less safe than another for no 
reason other than the color of their 
skin. We have to refuse to accept it, 
but that is the country in which we 
live. 
We have to acknowledge, finally, 
what KAMALA HARRIS and CORY BOOKER 
and others have been telling us, which 
is that our criminal justice system in 
this country is broken. 
Our long history of unequal treat-
ment of poor and minority criminal of-
fenders—especially Black Americans— 
has evolved into a system of mass in-
carceration unlike that of any other 
developed democracy. A network of 
dystopian, privatized prison spreads 
across the land to house people who, in 
many cases, shouldn’t even be behind 
bars, who were convicted for infrac-
tions relating to things that are legal 
in the State of Colorado today. 
According to Ta-Nehisi Coates’ defin-
itive article on the subject of the U.S. 
mass incarceration, our country ac-
counts for less than 5 percent of the 
world’s population but 25 percent of 
those who are incarcerated. Our closest 
competitor—and it is hard to find one— 
is Russia, a virtual police state. 
In our country, there is nothing 
equal about who is incarcerated. Black 
males between the ages of 20 and 39 are 
incarcerated at a rate 10 times the rate 
of their White peers. Every one of these 
issues needs to be reexamined and 
formed not by ideology but by prag-
matism 
and, 
most 
important, 
the 
moral commandments of a just society. 
That is what the patriotic Americans 
in our streets in downtowns demand. 
They are not calling for one more com-
mission. They are not calling for one 
more study. They are calling for real 
reform. That is what people mean when 
they say: This moment calls for real 
reform. That is what the people are 
saying in the streets. 
With respect to my colleagues on the 
other 
side, 
the 
proposal 
Senator 
MCCONNELL
has put forward doesn’t 
come close to meeting that test. His 
bill, his proposal, which is meant to 
paper this over and get through to an-
other chapter, not address the issue— 
his bill still allows the use of choke 
holds, the same choke holds that suffo-
cated the life from Eric Garner. It 
doesn’t ban no-knock warrants, the 
same practice that led police to break 
down Breonna Taylor’s door and shoot 
her eight times in her own apartment. 
It doesn’t make it easier for families 
like the family of George Floyd to seek 
justice when their loved ones have been 
victimized 
by 
police 
brutality. 
It 
doesn’t even ban racial profiling. There 
is virtually nothing in this bill to re-
spond to the families calling for justice 
or to save lives from police practices 
that have no place in America in the 
year 2020. 
This is not a time for half measures, 
for one more attempt to use talking 
points and legislative tricks to make it 
seem like we are doing something when 
we are not. The idea that the country 
isn’t ready for a comprehensive ap-
proach is not true.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3151 
June 23, 2020 
I will yield to my colleague from 
Connecticut in just a minute. 
Last week in Colorado—my State, a 
Western State, a purple State—we be-
came the first State in America to pass 
a sweeping police accountability bill 
into law. It is almost exactly like the 
one we have proposed here. We passed 
that bill 52 to 13 in the State House and 
32 to 2 in the Senate—32 to 2. Only two 
Republicans 
in 
the 
Senate 
voted 
against that bill. Every single Demo-
crat voted for that bill. And that is 
Colorado, out in the middle of the 
country. It sets a standard for what we 
need to do in Washington, which is to 
pass the Justice in Policing Act that 
Senator HARRIS and Senator BOOKER 
have put forward because we will never 
heal as a nation, as a country, unless 
we confront and dismantle the sys-
temic injustice and the systemic rac-
ism that still plagues America, running 
as it does in a straight line from slav-
ery to Jim Crow, to the redlining of 
our housing and banking system, to the 
mass incarceration that we have, to 
the prisons that Ta-Nehisi Coates re-
fers to as ‘‘The Gray Wastes.’’ 
As I said on the floor the other day, 
anyone who studied the history of our 
democracy knows how tough it is to 
make progress. The struggle has al-
ways been a battle from the very begin-
ning of our founding, between our high-
est ideals and our worst instincts as a 
country. More often than not, the ful-
crum of that battle from the founding 
until today has been race. Progress on 
these lines has never been easy. It has 
never come easy. 
Among us are still people whose poli-
tics are aimed at stripping some citi-
zens of their rights and opportunity, 
who despise pluralism, who succumb to 
fearful hatreds like racism or who care 
nothing for anyone but themselves. 
Their presence means that the rest of 
us, most of us, who Martin Luther 
King, Jr., called the great decent ma-
jority, must share an even deeper un-
derstanding of our patriotic obligation 
to our fellow Americans and to our Re-
public. Right now, that obligation 
means doing everything in our power 
to answer the call of Americans in our 
streets and downtowns, from DC to 
Denver, and beyond, who are calling for 
an America where no one is denied pro-
tection of the law or justice or their 
own life because of the color of their 
skin. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
have been doing a lot of listening over 
these past months. Like Americans 
across this country, I have been doing 
a lot of listening to the dedicated and 
passionate people, our fellow Ameri-
cans, who have marched in the streets 
and our communities with passion, but 
peacefully, in their cries for justice. In 
fact, I have marched with them in 15 or 
more demonstrations in Connecticut— 
big cities, Hartford, Stamford, New 
Haven; smaller cities, Lyme, Marl-
borough, Trumbull, Windsor, Glaston-
bury; and then places like Torrington, 
East Hartford, Danbury—all across the 
State, proud to be with people from 
Connecticut, led by our young people, 
as are many great social movements 
and revolutions of our time led by 
young people who have the audacity 
and hope to cast aside the normal and 
say: There is no going back. There is 
no rolling back to the old normal. 
What we need is action. 
That has been the common theme in 
these cries for justice—the demands for 
accountability, the pleas for an end to 
racism, generations of racial justice, 
and racism with historic roots in so 
many of our institutions, including 
some of our law enforcement. But they 
are demanding more than just our lis-
tening and more than just our speak-
ing. They are demanding action—real 
action, real reform, real change with 
real teeth and new laws. 
The time has come for us in this Con-
gress to heed those calls. We need leg-
islation that honors the memories and 
the lives of those who have lost their 
futures: Michael Brown, Philando Cas-
tile, Sandra Bland, and countless oth-
ers added to George Floyd, Breonna 
Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and Rayshard 
Brooks. Some are in the headlines. 
Some of their deaths have been caught 
on video—but so many thousands never 
on video, never publicized, and never 
known to the public. 
In their memory, but also for the 
sake of our future, we should move for-
ward with action. We are here today 
because, simply and starkly, the Re-
publican JUSTICE Act fails to meet 
this moment. It fails that test. 
I have been listening not only to the 
folks in the streets and our commu-
nities but also to my great colleagues 
CORY
BOOKER
and KAMALA
HARRIS. 
Clearly, from what we have heard from 
them and the work they have done, 
along with many of us, to fashion the 
Justice in Policing Act, the Republican 
proposal is a shadow of what it should 
be—unacceptably 
weak, 
nibbling 
around the edges of this problem, with-
out any guarantee that Black Ameri-
cans will not again ask us whether 
their lives are worth $20. 
The JUSTICE Act fails completely to 
address the harmful policing practices 
that we know have cost lives. The 
deaths of Breonna Taylor and Eric Gar-
ner are not anomalies. Choke holds and 
no-knock warrants are known to be 
costly. They have cost Black lives. The 
JUSTICE Act ignores this truth. 
Americans are not marching in the 
streets so we might ‘‘study’’ these phe-
nomena. They are not begging us to de-
sign programs ‘‘disincentivizing’’ prac-
tices that are literally killing Ameri-
cans—Black 
Americans—Americans 
who deserve justice. 
The notion we could respond to this 
moment with a commission or several 
commissions and incentives to do bet-
ter is insulting to all of us. We need 
legislation that explicitly bans the use 
of choke holds and no-knock warrants 
in drug cases so we can credibly tell 
the American people we hear you, and 
we will act. 
Communities of color must be able to 
trust that law enforcement will be held 
accountable if they commit criminal 
acts. The Republican JUSTICE Act 
completely lacks any mechanism to 
hold law enforcement officers account-
able in court for their misconduct. It 
makes no change to section 242 of title 
XVIII, which makes it a Federal crime 
to willfully deprive a person of con-
stitutional rights. 
This criminal statute can be used to 
hold officers accountable for the use of 
excessive 
force—something 
we 
all 
know led to the deaths of far too many 
Black and Brown people in this coun-
try. I believe that criminal liability is 
a critical tool in the law enforcement 
accountability toolbox but only if it is 
used. 
Right now, civil liability is available, 
albeit an inadequate remedy so long as 
a qualified immunity is not reformed. 
But very often, in 99 percent of the 
cases, any civil remedy involves indem-
nification by the municipal govern-
ment. Indemnification means the indi-
vidual officer feels no financial penalty 
and very often little other penalty. 
Criminal liability involving potentially 
prison concentrates the mind. It is a 
strong deterrent. 
As I said in a hearing that we con-
ducted in the Judiciary Committee, we 
need change to make it a real remedy 
and a real deterrent. When Officer 
Chauvin held his knee on George 
Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes 46 seconds, 
he looked straight into those cameras 
with impunity because he assumed he 
would never be prosecuted criminally. 
He never imagined that justice would 
find him, and justice still must find 
him in a criminal court. He ignored the 
pleas of bystanders telling him to stop. 
He ignored George Floyd, as he begged 
for his life. 
These kinds of actions by an indi-
vidual in a system that has shielded 
people like them simply encourage 
more of them. Section 242’s change in 
the standard of criminal intent will 
provide real criminal culpability for 
police who deserve it. 
The Republican JUSTICE Act relies 
mainly on data collection, which may 
be used to inform policy proposal at 
some later time. It pushes down the 
road any real action. 
We already have statistics. Since 
2015, there have been 5,000 fatal shoot-
ings by on-duty police officers. In the 
past year, over 1,000 people have been 
shot and killed by police. Black Ameri-
cans account for less than 13 percent of 
the country’s population, but they are 
killed at more than twice the rate of 
White Americans. 
Data is important. In fact, I was the 
lead sponsor of the Death in Custody 
Reporting Act, passed about 6 years 
ago. Regrettably and inexcusably, that 
measure has never been enforced so 
that it has never really been effective. 
We must make it so. But it shows the

limitation of any data collection sys-
tem. The fact is, systematic racism law 
enforcement has gone unchecked for 
too long. The time for accountability is 
now. It is long overdue. 
Let me say, finally, for most of my 
professional career, I have helped to 
enforce the laws. I have been a trial 
lawyer, yes, but I also served as the 
chief Federal prosecutor—the U.S. at-
torney—for Connecticut for 41⁄2 years 
and then as attorney general of my 
State for 20. I have seen some of the 
best in law enforcement and some of 
the worst. 
We need a higher standard, not just 
in words or paper but in fact. We need 
a standard that is worthy of the people 
who have marched and cried for justice 
throughout 
American 
history, 
who 
have tried to dream of a better system 
and a fairer country. There is so much 
work for us to do. At this moment, we 
must seize the opportunity, a point of 
consensus, to come together and act in 
a way that is worthy of this great Na-
tion. We have proposed exactly that ac-
tion in the Justice in Policing Act. We 
should be moving forward on it now, 
not on a bill that is truly unacceptably 
weak and inadequate and unworthy of 
this historic moment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
THE JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. Thousands of Americans are pro-
testing in communities across our 
country demanding that our country 
be better. The protests are an expres-
sion of grief for Ms. Taylor and Mr. 
Floyd and Mr. Arbery and Mr. Brooks 
and so many other Black Americans 
murdered by the people who are sup-
posed to protect them. They are an ex-
pression of frustration and anger. It is 
2020. It is the year 2020, a century and 
a half after the official end of slavery, 
five and a half decades after the pas-
sage of the Civil Rights Act, and still 
Black Americans are fighting the same 
fight. They are also an expression of 
hope against racism. We demand that 
our country do better. Demanding that 
we live up to our founding ideals is one 
of the most patriotic things anyone 
can do. 
We need to listen to the Black voices 
leading these calls for justice and take 
real action. That is what Democrats 
want to do, and my colleagues Senator 
HARRIS and Senator BOOKER and the 
Congressional Black Caucus in the 
House have led bicameral efforts and 
have a serious plan, the Justice in Po-
licing Act. Everybody knows it is a se-
rious plan—everybody. It would imple-
ment real, meaningful reform. It would 
actually hold police accountable. It 
makes clear: no more choke holds, no 
more unchecked police misconduct, no 
more militarization of police. 
Of course, we know this isn’t the only 
thing we need to do. Policing didn’t 
create institutional racism; it is a 
product of it and often reinforces it. We 
have a lot of work to do beyond this, 
but these reforms are an important 
start to making policing in our coun-
try more just. 
The Justice in Policing Act would 
create real change in our justice sys-
tem, and communities across the coun-
try can’t afford for us to not act on 
this meaningful legislation. What we 
cannot do is pass something just called 
police reform that does so little to ac-
tually reform policing and then turn 
around and tell Black mothers and fa-
thers whose children who have been 
slain: See, we solved it. Our work here 
is done. 
I respect Senator SCOTT, and I appre-
ciate his coming to the table and tak-
ing on this issue. I know he is fighting 
an uphill battle with his own caucus. I 
know that. So many on his side of the 
aisle don’t want to do anything, but 
they think they need to check the box. 
I want to work with Senator SCOTT 
and with anyone of either party on real 
solutions. All of us on our side do. But 
I am not willing to participate in a po-
litical charade to vote on something 
that has no chance to lead to real 
change. It just checks a box and pro-
vides politicians with a talking point. 
It is an insult to Black families who 
have been fed empty promise after 
empty promise, year after year, decade 
after decade, generation after genera-
tion. 
We need to listen to the communities 
that suffer the most at the hands of po-
lice violence. They all agree that the 
Senate Republican bill is simply not 
serious. It will not fix the problems. We 
will be right back here sooner rather 
than later. Virtually every major civil 
rights group opposes this bill: the 
NAACP Legal Defense Fund; the Urban 
League; the Young Women’s Christian 
Association, one of the most important 
civil rights and women’s rights organi-
zations in the country. 
It doesn’t ban no-knock warrants; 
the Justice in Policing Act does. It 
doesn’t stop the militarization of po-
lice departments; the Justice in Polic-
ing Act does. It doesn’t create a na-
tional misconduct registry; the Justice 
in Policing Act does. It doesn’t ban 
choke holds; the Justice in Policing 
Act does. These are all steps that civil 
rights groups have said are critical to 
any reform effort. It is the bare min-
imum. 
All this bill offers is more studies of 
questions we already know the answers 
to. We don’t need more studies. We 
don’t need more task forces. We don’t 
need, as Senator MCCONNELL special-
izes in, more delaying tactics. We need 
accountability. The JUSTICE Act even 
puts us in danger of moving in the op-
posite direction by providing more 
funding for policing without adequate 
rules and regulations and without a 
similar investment in community sup-
port. 
The NAACP says this bill ‘‘ignores 
the public demands to reimagine public 
safety by shrinking the purview of law 
enforcement and providing better fund-
ing to agencies equipped to address the 
critical needs of communities such as 
social services, mental health services, 
and education.’’ 
The Urban League says this Scott 
bill ‘‘dances around the edges in a show 
of political posturing.’’ 
We refuse to engage in that political 
posturing. We refuse to act like it is 
just a box we check and then we can 
move on. We refuse to insult Black 
Americans by pretending—pretending— 
this is a serious effort. People have suf-
fered too long for that. 
We have been here before. This isn’t 
the first wave of protests or the second. 
In 2014, after the murders of Tamir 
Rice in my city of Cleveland and Mi-
chael Brown in Ferguson, MO, Presi-
dent Obama’s legislation laid impor-
tant groundwork for reform. They 
studied what reforms would be most ef-
fective. They instituted consent de-
crees with cities to hold departments 
accountable, and they created a road-
map we could follow. But President 
Trump undid much of the progress the 
Obama administration made. 
The Urban League put out a plan for 
reform around the time of the murder 
of Tamir Rice after Michael Brown’s 
murder in 2014. Since then, nearly 1,300 
Black men and women—think of that— 
more than 1,300 Black men and women 
have been fatally shot by the police 
since the deaths of Michael Brown and 
Tamir Rice 6 years ago. This bill does 
nothing to stop the practices that 
killed them. 
Black Americans know their lives are 
put in danger by police every day. We 
must listen to them. People all around 
the country—Black and White and 
Brown, in small towns and big cities, 
young and old—are listening, waking 
up, and joining the calls for change. 
The peaceful demonstrations and pro-
tests all over my State in Black and 
White neighborhoods and integrated 
communities and small towns and 
rural Ohio, in big cities, in suburbs ev-
erywhere—let’s follow their lead. Let’s 
actually hear the voices that have been 
silenced for too long. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no and, 
instead, to work with us on real, mean-
ingful reform to transform our public 
safety system into one that actually 
keeps people safe. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to address the nationwide 
call for reasonable, sensible police re-
forms. Last month, the American peo-
ple watched in horror as a police officer 
kneeled down on the neck of George 
Floyd for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, 
killing him. 
‘‘I can’t breathe.’’ It was a slow exe-
cution caught on video, a metaphor for 
the systematic racism and injustices 
Black and Brown communities endure 
every day. But unlike other horrific 
videos of police killings that have 
sparked protests, this feels different. 
This is a moment when people of all 
races and walks of life have taken to

the streets in cities and communities 
across the country. They are crying 
out: Enough is enough. 
It is time for us to address the insti-
tutional racism, economic, societal, 
and environmental inequities and in-
justice that have plagued this Nation 
since its founding. The American peo-
ple are demanding real, meaningful 
change—bold, 
comprehensive 
action 
that starts by reforming our police sys-
tem that has historically dealt a heav-
ier hand toward communities of color. 
What did the Republican majority do 
to answer the public’s plea? They have 
offered the American people the JUS-
TICE Act. They call it justice, but jus-
tice for whom? This bill fails to meet 
this moment in history before us. It of-
fers only lip service to the families of 
George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and 
Tamir Rice and Eric Garner and all of 
those tragically lost at the hands of 
the police. 
The Republican JUSTICE Act is 
nothing more than a glorified sugges-
tion box filled with half measures and 
placations that sound good on paper 
but simply will not deliver the real 
change the American people are de-
manding from this body. There is no 
justice in the JUSTICE Act; rather, it 
is a wholly inadequate response to the 
injustices faced by Black and Brown 
communities at the hands of the police. 
It merely asks, suggests, recommends, 
and encourages. It says to law enforce-
ment: Hey, would you mind? Could you 
kindly? Do you think you might be 
able? 
Nowhere in this bill does it compel, 
require, mandate, or insist upon the 
commonsense structural reforms the 
American people are demanding. The 
JUSTICE Act calls for reports and a 
commission, but we have had 400 years 
to study the stain of slavery and insti-
tutional racism in this country. We 
don’t need a study to tell us that too 
many young Black men are dying at 
the hands of the police or that you are 
more likely to be shot and killed by 
the police if you are Black than White. 
A commission will not save the life of 
the next George Floyd. 
My Republican colleagues may think 
that the American people will praise 
them for passing an empty bill named 
‘‘JUSTICE’’ that does no justice to the 
deep-seated, systemic failures in our 
policing system. They are mistaken. 
Indeed, I would encourage my Repub-
lican colleagues to consider the Justice 
in Policing Act, led by Senators BOOK-
ER and HARRIS, which I am proud to co-
sponsor. It requires a comprehensive 
set of reforms designed to increase po-
lice 
accountability, 
improve 
trans-
parency, and invest in training. The 
Justice in Policing Act bans no-knock 
warrants in drug cases, the kind that 
led to Breonna Taylor’s death. It estab-
lishes a national public registry on po-
lice misconduct so that the bad actors 
who make it harder for the good cops 
to do their jobs can’t just move from 
department to department. Our bill re-
quires data collection and publication 
on the use of force. The Republican bill 
does none of those things. While the 
Justice in Policing Act bans deadly 
choke holds and other tactics that re-
strict blood flow to the brain, the Re-
publican bill stops short of any such 
ban. 
The JUSTICE Act is also silent on 
racial profiling and the militarization 
of local police departments. It is silent 
on funding independent investigative 
channels 
to 
prosecute 
police 
mis-
conduct and fails to strengthen pattern 
and practice investigations. It fails to 
establish national standards for police 
misconduct. While it would provide ad-
ditional money to law enforcement, it 
does so without actually requiring any 
substantive change, so it fails us. The 
JUSTICE Act fails to create a system 
of policing that is about community 
safety and equal application of the law. 
So, again, I ask my friends on the 
other side of the aisle: Where is the ac-
tual justice? Where is the justice for 
Breonna Taylor, George Floyd? Where 
is the justice for those murders that 
were not captured on video? Where is 
the justice for thousands of Black men 
sitting in prison, victims of over-
policing and racial profiling? 
Senator MCCONNELL would have us 
think that the JUSTICE Act is our 
only option, that if we don’t acquiesce 
to these half measures, then we don’t 
really want reform. That is simply not 
true. 
It seems to me that the Republicans 
and the President don’t want real re-
form. They want window dressing and 
fresh paint instead of fixing the very 
foundation on which our policing sys-
tem stands. They want to say that they 
did something without actually doing 
anything meaningful. They want to 
blame Democrats for holding out for 
real justice and refusing to play these 
political games with people’s lives. 
The House is going to pass the Jus-
tice in Policing Act on Thursday. I 
urge Senator MCCONNELL to take up 
that bill so that we can have the mean-
ingful conversation on police reform 
our constituents and the Nation are de-
manding. 
We know that reform can work. Cam-
den, NJ, offers us concrete evidence 
about what we can accomplish when we 
get serious about making real changes. 
With one of the highest murder rates in 
the Nation, excessive force complaints 
were dramatically reduced, both in 
terms of homicides and excessive force 
issues. 
So before I close, let me make per-
fectly clear the profound respect that I 
have for the men and women in law en-
forcement. Policing is a very tough job, 
and the vast majority of officers go out 
and perform their jobs every day with 
dignity and professionalism and care 
for the people in the communities in 
which they serve. I am deeply grateful 
for their service throughout the State 
of New Jersey and, indeed, throughout 
the Nation. These officers, who do their 
jobs with dignity and respect for the 
people they serve, share our demands 
for real change. In fact, in Camden 
itself, a White chief of police joined 
with hundreds of protesters who were 
marching for change. 
Across the country, tens of thousands 
of Americans did not brave a pandemic 
and endure being shot at with rubber 
bullets and tear gas just so that Con-
gress could create another commission 
and mandate another report. They de-
mand that their elected officials in 
Washington meet this moment in his-
tory and actually do something that 
lives up to the American promise of a 
nation where every man and woman, 
regardless of their race, ethnicity, gen-
der, or orientation, is treated equally— 
equally under the law. 
I will just close by saying that the 
Nation will rue the day it answered the 
call for reform with business as usual. 
There will be a rude awakening. Who 
among us—who among us, if this were 
our daily experience, would be satisfied 
with the counsels of patience and 
delay? Who among us? 
The American people are calling for 
real justice. We should listen. We 
should act, and we should deliver real 
justice. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

PROTESTS 
Mr. 
RUBIO. 
Mr. 
President, 
Mr. 
Floyd’s horrific murder at the hands of 
a man sworn to uphold the law, our Na-
tion has seen justified anger. As I said 
here 2 weeks ago, it is a moment that 
calls for not just police reform, it calls 
for a full reckoning with racial inequi-
ties that still plague our Nation. 
There is, in my mind, nothing more 
un-American than racial discrimina-
tion. Our Nation was founded on the 
revolutionary truth that every human 
being is created equal and that our 
rights do not come from our govern-
ment or from our leaders or even our 
laws; our rights come from our Cre-
ator. 
It is true that the man who authored 
these words and gave birth to the 
young Nation did not fully live up to 
these principles, but it is also true that 
every single great fight for equality in 
this country’s history has come from a 
direct appeal to those powerful prin-
ciples. Slavery, segregation, discrimi-
natory impediments to voting—all of 
these came to an end, not from efforts 
to overthrow our values but from de-
mands that we fulfill them, for these 
evils could not exist in a country, in a 
nation, built upon the idea that all 
people are created equal with rights 
granted to them by God. 
Slavery and racial discrimination 
are, indeed, a tragic part of our his-
tory, but the long and the steady and

the perpetual march toward equality, 
that is part of our heritage as well. 
Today, a new generation of Ameri-
cans is reminding us that while we 
have traveled far on the quest for a 
more perfect Union, the final miles of 
that journey still lie ahead. The over-
whelming and vast majority of these 
Americans on our streets are peace-
fully reminding us that, yes, Black 
lives matter. They are not asking that 
we destroy America; they are demand-
ing that we be more American; that we 
more fully become a nation with lib-
erty and justice for all. But it is now 
also clear that there are others with a 
different agenda who have taken to our 
streets as well. 
They are the ones who argue that be-
cause the men who wrote our Declara-
tion of Independence and our Constitu-
tion were imperfect and, in some cases, 
racists, that the Nation their words 
gave birth to is beyond redemption; 
that America cannot be improved or 
saved; and that therefore it must come 
to an end. 
These radical views are not new. 
From the crazy professor whom no one 
took seriously to the nut job running 
for office with no chance of winning, 
they have operated on the fringes of 
our politics for decades. The difference 
is that, in recent years, they have 
begun to move out from the fringes, 
and now these radicals are capitalizing 
on a legitimate movement to force 
their madness even further into the 
mainstream. Now their violence, their 
vandalism, their anarchy are excused, 
tolerated, sometimes even celebrated 
by some, and their radical agenda is 
shielded, increasingly, from scrutiny 
by an emerging speech code that con-
demns as hate speech and as racism 
any criticism of these anti-lynching 
American radicals. 
The self-proclaimed guardians of free 
speech in media now apologize for 
printing the opinions of a U.S. Senator 
and actively cajoled tech companies to 
censor 
conservative 
voices. 
Social 
media companies, which owe their very 
existence to freedom of expression, now 
threaten to block the accounts of 
American politicians in publications 
here at home, while eagerly complying 
with the demands of totalitarian racist 
regimes abroad. 
Online mobs not only decide what is 
acceptable speech but are empowered 
to destroy the reputation and career of 
anyone they believe has violated their 
standards. Celebrities and large cor-
porations are so eager to proactively 
shield themselves from being canceled 
that they raise money to bail out 
arsonists, but they do not raise a single 
cent to help the small business owners, 
oftentimes 
minorities 
themselves, 
whose life work was looted and burned 
to the ground by the radicals. 
This radicalism, this anarchy, isn’t 
just annoying; it is destructive, and it 
is dangerous. It is destructive to bed-
rock institutions in our country and 
their legitimacy in the eyes of our peo-
ple. 
Why would people trust public health 
experts who told them they had to lose 
their job or their business, that their 
kids couldn’t have a graduation, that 
their grandmother couldn’t have a fu-
neral but are afraid to say anything 
about crowds of people setting fires and 
looting businesses? 
Why would people trust local leaders 
who will close your business for having 
too many customers or threaten to ar-
rest you for going to a park or to a 
church but who stand by and do noth-
ing when a mob vandalizes a monu-
ment, tears down a statue, or takes 
over an entire section of a city? 
Why would people trust the media 
that will shame them for going to the 
beach, for not wearing a mask in public 
but portrays a mob of White anarchists 
attacking African-American police of-
ficers as just frustrated racial justice 
activists? 
This radicalism is also dangerous be-
cause, if it is OK for a violent mob to 
tear down a statue, then what is to 
stop another violent mob from showing 
up to defend it? If it is OK to set a po-
lice car on fire, what is going to stop 
someone upset at activist judges from 
burning down a courtroom? Where does 
it end? It will not end because there is 
no way to satisfy radicals who only 
seek destruction. 
Just ask a clergy at the historical St. 
John’s Episcopal Church. Three weeks 
ago, they expressed their support for 
and solidarity with the protesters, even 
after some agitator tried to burn down 
the church. Last night, radicals van-
dalized their church, calling for an au-
tonomous zone here in Washington. 
Just ask the mayor of Seattle. Just a 
few days ago on national TV, she was 
saying that the so-called autonomous 
zone in her city would lead to a ‘‘sum-
mer of love.’’ Now they have an-
nounced that they are going to move in 
and retake the area after multiple peo-
ple were shot over the weekend. 
The anti-American radicals don’t 
care about racial equality, and they 
will not stop as long as everyone is 
afraid to call them out for who and for 
what they are. As long as we fail to 
point out that those seeking racial 
equality and these radicals are not the 
same people; that the people commit-
ting this violence and carrying out this 
anarchy and this chaos are not the 
same people as the people who are 
rightfully asking for us to address ra-
cial inequality, as long as we fail to 
point that out, they will continue to 
hide behind this important and legiti-
mate movement. 
It is time we stop—we stop being 
afraid to express the common sense of 
Americans of every race, of every back-
ground. Yes, we must address racial in-
equality. Yes, Black lives must matter. 
But the vandalism, the arson, and the 
anarchy on our streets have nothing to 
do with this important cause. 
Yes, some police departments need to 
be reformed, and bad police officers 
need to be fired. And if they committed 
crimes, they need to be arrested, and 
they need to be prosecuted. But, no, we 
are not going to abolish or defund po-
lice departments. 
Yes, racial disparities must be ac-
knowledged, and they must be ad-
dressed but not by giving in to a bunch 
of crazy radicals who hate and want to 
destroy this country of ours. This is 
what the overwhelming majority of 
Americans of every race and back-
ground believe, and this is what so 
many are afraid to say for fear of being 
destroyed by an online mob and their 
accomplices. 
For over 200 years, each generation of 
America has moved us ever closer to 
fulfilling the powerful truths upon 
which this Nation was founded. Now it 
is our turn to do the same, not by de-
stroying America but by becoming 
more fully American, not by aban-
doning our founding principles but by 
moving us closer to becoming the one 
Nation under God with liberty and jus-
tice for all that we have pledged our al-
legiance to.

NOMINATION OF CORY T. WILSON 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in opposition to the nomina-
tion of Cory Wilson to a Mississippi 
seat on the Fifth Circuit. Judge Wilson 
has a troubling record on a number of 
critically 
important 
issues. 
That 
record makes clear Judge Wilson is far 
outside of the judicial mainstream. I 
believe that record is and should be dis-
qualifying. 
First, Judge Wilson has a long record 
of working to undermine voting rights. 
He has been a longtime proponent of 
voter ID laws—which disproportion-
ately harm communities of color, stu-
dents, voters with disabilities, and the 
elderly—and has made false claims 
about the prevalence of voter fraud. 
He has likewise expressed opposition 
to enforcement of the Voting Rights 
Act and has made unsubstantiated 
claims that voter suppression is non-
existent. As I have noted before, Judge 
Wilson’s troubling record on voting

rights is highly relevant to his nomina-
tion. The Fifth Circuit is a majority- 
minority circuit; 55 percent of those 
who live in the circuit are people of 
color. The Senate should not confirm a 
nominee who would work to further re-
strict the right to vote from the bench. 
Second, Judge Wilson has been a 
staunch opponent of the Affordable 
Care Act. He referred to the ACA’s pas-
sage as ‘‘perverse’’ and ‘‘illegitimate.’’ 
He called upon the Supreme Court to 
strike down the law, writing: ‘‘For the 
sake of the Constitution, I hope the 
Court strikes down the law and rein-
vigorates some semblance of the lim-
ited government the Founders in-
tended.’’ 
As of June 22, more than 120,000 
Americans have died from COVID–19, 
and nearly 2.3 million have been in-
fected. Now is not the time to advance 
a judicial nominee whose opposition to 
the ACA would strip tens of millions of 
Americans of healthcare, including 
those with preexisting conditions. 
Third, Judge Wilson has made ex-
treme partisan comments that call 
into question his ability to rule fairly 
and impartially. In op-eds in a Mis-
sissippi newspaper, he likened Presi-
dent Obama to ‘‘a fit-throwing teen-
ager’’ and called him ‘‘King Barack’’ 
and 
‘‘President 
Make-Believe.’’ 
In 
tweets that he has kept public even 
while serving as a State court judge, 
Judge Wilson called Hillary Clinton 
‘‘Crooked Clinton’’ and said she was 
‘‘criminal and clueless.’’ He also called 
Congresswoman ALEXANDRIA
OCASIO- 
CORTEZ
a 
‘‘claptrap.’’ 
The 
Senate 
should not confirm a nominee who can-
not be trusted to put aside extreme 
partisanship to rule in an unbiased and 
impartial manner. 
Fourth, Judge Wilson has sought to 
undermine the rights of LGBT Ameri-
cans. In 2016, while serving in the Mis-
sissippi legislature, Judge Wilson sup-
ported HB 1523, a bill providing legal 
cover for businesses to deny services to 
individuals on the basis of their sexual 
orientation. In a 2012 op-ed, Judge Wil-
son argued that ‘‘gay marriage is a 
pander to liberal interest groups and 
an attempt to cast Republicans as in-
tolerant, uncaring and even bigoted.’’ 
Judge Wilson’s past support for anti- 
LGBT legislation and his comments de-
meaning the fight for marriage equal-
ity raise questions about his ability to 
rule objectively on any case impli-
cating LGBT rights. 
Finally, Judge Wilson has been an ar-
dent opponent of women’s reproductive 
rights, making it abundantly clear 
that he supports ‘‘the complete and im-
mediate reversal of the Roe v. Wade 
and Doe v. Bolton decisions.’’ 
Judge Wilson will be the 200th Arti-
cle III judge appointed by this Presi-
dent and confirmed by this Senate. Un-
fortunately, Judge Wilson’s record of 
hostility to voting rights, the ACA, the 
rights of LGBT Americans, and wom-
en’s reproductive rights is not unique 
to him. In fact, it is clear that so many 
of this administration’s judicial nomi-
nees have been selected precisely be-
cause of those viewpoints. This is not 
something to celebrate. After all, those 
who have gained healthcare because of 
the ACA deserve the security of know-
ing their coverage is not at risk from 
the Federal judiciary. 
And those who seek to vindicate 
their rights—to vote, to make their 
own reproductive healthcare decisions, 
and to be free from discrimination on 
the basis of sexual orientation or gen-
der identity—deserve a judiciary that 
will rule fairly and impartially. 
I will vote against Judge Wilson’s 
nomination, and I urge my colleagues 
to do the same. Thank you.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING ED PINEGAR 
∑ Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to 
spend a few moments talking about a 
man who has been one of my closest 
friends for a long time. Springfieldian 
Ed Pinegar passed away on May 23, 
2020, at the age of 74. He was the kind 
of person that many people will re-
member as one of their best friends. 
Ed loved his family, his church, and 
his community. He grew up in Willard, 
attended Missouri State University, 
and became one of the most successful 
auto and truck dealers in the middle of 
our country. Never forgetting his rural 
roots, 
he 
eventually 
established 
Pinegar Land and Cattle and became 
the leading breeder of Limousin Cattle 
in North America. As with everything 
he did, this was an extremely success-
ful business. 
Ed never forgot where he was from. 
For the last several years, one of my 
favorite things was to go to Ed’s farm 
with him early in the morning to see 
what his plans were for the farm and 
catch up on what was happening with 
the business and his family and friends. 
I will miss those visits, but I am so 
glad to have shared those times with 
Ed. 
Ed’s life of service is too long to list, 
as are the recognitions he received 
along the way. He served on the Mis-
souri State University board of gov-
ernors and their board of trustees, was 
inducted into the Missouri Limousin 
Breeders Association Hall of Fame, 
honored by the Ozark Empire Fair 
Ground Gold Buckle Gala for his dedi-
cation to youth, and with his wife 
Carol received the outstanding Willard 
Alumni Award. He recently received 
the 2019 AFP Outstanding Philan-
thropist of the Year Award. 
Ed was dedicated to his family, his 
community, athletics, and his faith. He 
was a loyal friend with a great sense of 
humor and an even better perspective 
on life. He was a devoted Christian, ac-
tive in his church, and used the bless-
ings of his work to invest in the places 
and people he loved. He was generous 
in his giving and generous in spirit. 
The Pinegar Arena is an indoor horse 
center and classroom that is part of 
Missouri State’s agricultural center. 
This is one of many examples of how 
Ed gave of his time and resources in-
vesting in people and things to help 
others. 
Much too soon, Ed suffered a stroke, 
which took a serious toll on his health 
and quality of life. Abby and I were en-
couraged by his early recovery from 
those challenges and inspired by his 
family’s dedication to him as each of 
them, with Carol in the lead, loved and 
cared for him. Much of his legacy will 
continue to live on through Carol and 
their children Angela, Tad, Amy, and 
Abigail. Ed also leaves behind nine 
grandchildren, who were lucky enough 
to spend time with their grandfather 
who, 
despite 
his 
busy 
schedule, 
prioritized games, events, and school 
performances. 
I am grateful to have known Ed 
Pinegar and thankful for his impact on 
my own life and that of those who 
knew him.∑

S3156 
June 23, 2020 
Whereas, the impact of the LaVetCorps 
program is significant, providing practical 
assistance in life-changing ways as in the 
current year, LaVetCorps navigators have 
served more than two thousand veterans and 
military-connected students, with more than 
one hundred of these referrals directly con-
necting to earned federal VA benefits; and 
Whereas, LaVetCorps navigators have pro-
vided direct assistance through the LDVA 
and outside community agencies that has 
prevented evictions, prevented unnecessary 
student debt and provided critical immediate 
support for veteran students in crisis; and 
Whereas, LaVetCorps has raised military 
awareness on campuses statewide while pro-
viding peer mentoring and has been respon-
sible for organizing more than two hundred 
volunteers in various community service 
projects around the state; and 
Whereas, LaVetCorps is viewed by higher 
education officials as an essential invest-
ment in veteran students and navigators pro-
vide a critical level of support to recruit, re-
tain, and support veterans in their academic 
and personal journeys: Now, therefore be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
memorializes the Congress of the United 
States to fully fund the Corporation for Na-
tional and Community Service (CNCS) and 
its programs in FY 2021; and be it further

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. 
CORNYN, 
Ms. 
CORTEZ 
MASTO, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. 
MARKEY, and Ms. ROSEN): 
S. 4043. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of Defense to develop a com-
prehensive database and repository on 
military aviators and conduct a study 
on such aviators to determine the inci-
dence of cancer diagnosis and mor-
tality among such aviators, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Armed Services. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of the ‘‘Mili-
tary Aviators Cancer Incidence Study 
Act,’’ which I introduced today. 
This legislation would require the 
Department of Defense to conduct a 
study to determine if there is a higher 
incidence of cancers occurring in mili-
tary aviators as compared to similar 
age groups in the general population. 
It has been reported that the preva-
lence of cancer is particularly high 
among military aviators, particularly 
among fighter pilots in the United 
States Air Force, Navy, and Marine 
Corps. 
There have been several alarming 
clusters of cancer diagnoses at military 
installations, including at Naval Air 
Weapons Station China Lake in Cali-
fornia and Seymour Johnson Air Force 
Base in North Carolina. 
Four 
commanding 
officers 
who 
served at Naval Air Weapons Station 
China Lake have died of cancer. Each 
officer had completed thousands of 
flight hours in advanced jets. 
According to a study by the U.S. Air 
Force in 2008 titled ‘‘Cancer in Fight-
ers,’’ six pilots and weapons systems 
officers for the F–15E Strike Eagle at 
Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, aged 
33 to 43, were diagnosed with cancer be-
tween 2002 and 2005. Each officer had 
completed at least 2,100 flight hours. 
A study by the U.S. Air Force in 2010 
reported on a cluster of seven members 
of the Air Force Special Operations 
Command diagnosed with brain cancer 
among crew members of the C–130 be-
tween 2006 and 2009. The individuals af-
fected were three C–130 pilots, two 
flight engineers, one loadmaster, and 
one navigator assigned to different in-
stallations around the world. 
And yet, there has been no com-
prehensive study conducted of cancer 
rates among military aviators. 
One challenge of extracting findings 
from previous studies by the Navy or 
the Air Force on cancer rates is that 
each study focused on pilots who are 
active duty members of the Armed 
Forces and did not include the medical 
records of former pilots who are vet-
erans, which is the population in which 
cancer most often appears. 
Members of the Armed Forces who 
serve full military careers are not like-
ly to be counted in data captured by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Members who served 20 years or more 
are eligible for health care under the 
TRICARE program, which is managed 
by the Department of Defense. 
Also, many members pursue private 
sector jobs after separating from the 
Armed Forces and receive health care 
outside of the Federal Government. 
Those factors have made it difficult to 
see if the health issues that families of 
military aviators are experiencing are 
part of larger trend. 
HOW THE BILL WOULD HELP 
Our bill would require the Depart-
ment of Defense in conjunction with 
the National Institutes of Health, the 
National Cancer Institute, and the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs to con-
duct a study across the United States 
Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps to 
determine whether there is a higher in-
cidence of cancers occurring among 
military aviators as compared to simi-
lar age groups in the general popu-
lation. 
If the study determines a higher rate 
of cancer among military aviators, the 
Department of Defense would then 
move into a second phase of the study 
and report to Congress on the fol-
lowing: 
Carcinogens associated with military 
flight operations; 
The operating environments where 
aviators might have been exposed to 
increased radiation; 
Duty stations, dates of service, air-
craft flown, and additional duties that 
could have increased the risk of cancer 
for each affected military aviator; 
Locations where a military aviator 
served or additional duties of a mili-
tary aviator associated with higher 
incidences of cancer; 
Potential exposures due to service in 
the Armed Forces that are not related 
to aviation, such as exposure to burn 
pits or toxins in contaminated water; 
and 
The appropriate age to begin screen-
ing military aviators for cancer based 
on several variables. 
CONCLUSION 
Military aviators take enough risks 
while serving our country without also 
having to worry about contracting can-
cer from radiation exposure. 
The high prevalence of cancer among 
these pilots is deeply concerning, par-
ticularly the clusters of cases at China 
Lake. 
We must determine why these avi-
ators are getting cancer and if their 
jobs are exposing them to dangerous 
carcinogens. 
The study is an important step to 
help us understand what is happening 
and how we can better protect our 
military men and women. I hope my 
colleagues will join me in support of 
this bill. 
Thank you Mr. President. I yield the

Mr. GRAHAM submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 636 
Whereas May 14, 2020, marks the 75th anni-
versary of the commencement of continuous 
operations, in service to the military com-
munity of the United States, of Stars and 
Stripes in the Pacific, a military newspaper 
established in Honolulu to provide an inde-
pendent, uncensored news source for mem-
bers of the Armed Forces fighting in World 
War II; 
Whereas Stars and Stripes was heralded for 
indispensable service when it was initially 
established during the Civil War and again 
during World War I, when General John J. 
Pershing reestablished Stars and Stripes to 
provide news and information as an impor-
tant morale-building force for soldiers serv-
ing in the American Expeditionary Force; 
Whereas, after its permanent formation in 
World War II, Stars and Stripes started 
printing in Tokyo, Japan, on October 3, 1945, 
working in requisitioned space formally oc-
cupied by the Japan Times, and excelled in 
its mission across every theater of war, lead-
ing President Harry S. Truman to say later, 
‘‘In Africa, Europe and the Pacific, The Stars 
and Stripes has established itself as a cher-
ished and important soldier’s institution.’’;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3159 
June 23, 2020 
Whereas Stars and Stripes has continu-
ously covered news ‘‘about the military, for 
the military’’ in conflicts from World War II 
to Korea to Vietnam to Bosnia and Kosovo 
to Iraq and Afghanistan; and 
Whereas, while readership of newspapers 
has declined in recent years and technology 
has evolved, Stars and Stripes has innovated 
in finding new ways and products to deliver 
the ‘‘hometown news’’ to the broadest por-
tion of the military community, and through 
internet versions of the newspaper, social 
media, and other products, Stars and Stripes 
is now reaching 1,300,000 readers each day: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate, on the occasion 
of the 75th anniversary of the commence-
ment of continuous operations of Stars and 
Stripes in the Pacific— 
(1) commemorates this important mile-
stone in the history of an important institu-
tion of the United States; and 
(2) congratulates and honors the men and 
women of Stars and Stripes, past and 
present, who have so diligently served the 
United States military community.

RESOLUTION 
637—COM-
MEMORATING 
THE 
35TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
UNITED 
STATES 
BROADCASTING TO CUBA 
Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. MENEN-
DEZ, and Mr. SCOTT of Florida) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations.: 
S. RES. 637 
Whereas the Radio Broadcasting to Cuba 
Act (Public Law 98–111) passed by a wide 
margin in the House of Representatives on 
September 29, 1983, and passed unanimously 
by voice vote in the Senate on September 12, 
1983; 
Whereas, upon signing the Radio Broad-
casting to Cuba Act into law on October 4, 
1983, President Ronald Reagan said that the 
law ‘‘responds to an important foreign policy 
initiative of my administration: to break 
Fidel Castro’s monopoly on news and infor-
mation within Cuba’’, further explaining 
that the purpose of providing impartial news 
to the Cuban people was so that they ‘‘will 
be in a better position to make Cuba’s lead-
ers accountable for their conduct in foreign 
policy, economic management, and human 
rights.’’; 
Whereas radio service into Cuba was 
named ‘‘Radio Marti’’ after renowned 19th 
century Cuban patriot Jose Martı´; 
Whereas, on May 20, 1985, the 83rd anniver-
sary of Cuba’s Independence Day, Radio 
Martı´ began its first broadcast into Cuba; 
Whereas, in 1990, Congress passed and 
President George H.W. Bush signed into law 
the Television Broadcasting to Cuba Act 
(Public Law 101–246), which expanded broad-
casting to include television, and ‘‘Tele-
vision Martı´’’ commenced broadcasting later 
that year; 
Whereas President William Jefferson Clin-
ton signed into law the Omnibus Consoli-
dated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 
1996 (Public Law 104–134), which required the 
relocation of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting 
from Washington, D.C., to South Florida; 
Whereas the Office of Cuba Broadcasting 
was relocated to Miami, Florida in 1998, 
ahead of schedule and under budget; 
Whereas United States broadcasts to Cuba 
were initiated to pierce the Castro regime’s 
information blockade and to provide timely, 
accurate, uncensored, and reliable informa-
tion to the Cuban people; 
Whereas the Office of Cuba Broadcasting at 
the United States Agency for Global Media 
(USAGM) oversees Radio and Television 
Martı´; 
Whereas Radio and Television Martı´ are 
multimedia hubs of news, information, and 
analysis that provide the people of Cuba with 
interactive programs 7 days a week through 
satellite television, shortwave and AM radio, 
and digital platforms, including its website, 
flash drives, emails, DVDs, and SMS text; 
Whereas Radio and Television Martı´ aim to 
inform and engage the people of Cuba by pro-
viding credible news and information rooted 
in respect for fundamental freedoms, demo-
cratic 
principles, 
and 
universal 
human 
rights; 
Whereas the Office of Cuba Broadcasting 
facilitates critical technology services, al-
lowing Cubans across provinces to connect, 
and linking Cuban pro-democracy activists 
with an expanding worldwide network of ac-
tivists engaged in their own struggles for 
freedom and human rights in their respective 
countries; 
Whereas, on July 14, 2011, independent 
journalist and former political prisoner Jose 
Daniel Ferrer said, ‘‘the particular stories, 
the news selected for A Fondo [a joint Voice 
of America and Radio Martı´ program], is 
what gives the show its quality, very profes-
sional. I listened to the show in prison on a 
daily basis.’’; 
Whereas Karen Caballero of Radio and Tel-
evision Martı´
received the David Burke 
Award in 2012 for her inspired coverage of the 
‘‘Lights of Liberty Flotilla’’, a small group 
of boats with a mission to sail across the 
Florida Strait to bring attention to the soli-
darity between Cuban exiles and those on the 
island, and to the human rights abuses per-
petrated by the regime in Cuba; 
Whereas, on August 13, 2013, Afro-Cuban 
activist and former political prisoner Jorge 
Luis Garcı´a-Pe´rez stated, ‘‘In the 17 years 
that I spent behind bars, Radio Martı´ was, at 
times, my ‘everything’. It was my lifeline.’’; 
and 
Whereas, in 2017, Television Martı´’s ‘‘Alas 
de Libertad’’ (Wings of Freedom), which doc-
umented the activities of the Brigade 2506 
Air Force division during the 1961 Bay of 
Pigs invasion, received the Suncoast Re-
gional Emmy Award from The National 
Academy of Television Arts & Sciences: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) celebrates the 35th anniversary of Radio 
Martı´ and the 30th anniversary of Television 
Martı´; 
(2) recognizes the vital role that inde-
pendent broadcasting to Cuba has served in 
providing uncensored, reliable, and accurate 
information to the Cuban people for the past 
35 years; 
(3) honors the journalists, programming 
editors, technical support, and many other 
employees at Radio and Television Martı´, 
administered through the Office of Cuba 
Broadcasting, who commit to high journal-
istic standards, tenacity, and providing unbi-
ased, objective information to the Cuban 
people; 
(4) remembers the deep and lasting con-
tributions that the free flow of information, 
including broadcasting, to Cuba has provided 
to the Cuban people in bolstering Cuba’s pro- 
democracy movement; and 
(5) reaffirms the importance of the United 
States strengthening policies in support of 
promoting democracy, promoting freedom of 
the press, and supporting the transmission of 
external, reliable, objective information to 
some of the most repressed parts of the 
world. 
SENATE 
CONCURRENT 
RESOLU-
TION 
40—EXPRESSING 
THE 
SENSE 
OF 
CONGRESS 
THAT 
UNDUE RESTRICTIONS ON THE 
RIGHT 
OF 
LAW-ABIDING 
GUN 
OWNERS TO CARRY A FIREARM 
FOR SELF-DEFENSE OUTSIDE OF 
THE HOME VIOLATE THE SEC-
OND AMENDMENT TO THE CON-
STITUTION 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
Mrs. LOEFFLER submitted the fol-
lowing concurrent resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. CON. RES. 40 
Whereas the Second Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States (referred 
to in this preamble as the ‘‘Second Amend-
ment’’) states, ‘‘[a] well regulated Militia, 
being necessary to the security of a free 
State, the right of the people to keep and 
bear Arms, shall not be infringed.’’; 
Whereas the right to ‘‘bear Arms’’, in plain 
language, means the right to carry arms; 
Whereas, based on this plain language, the 
Second Amendment clearly provides indi-
vidual citizens with a right to carry arms for 
the purpose of self-defense; 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United 
States has held that the Second Amendment 
is 
incorporated 
under 
the 
Fourteenth 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States and thereby protects the right 
of an individual under the Second Amend-
ment from infringement by State and local 
governments; 
Whereas several States have enacted laws 
that unduly inhibit and infringe upon the 
rights of a law-abiding individual to carry a 
firearm outside of the home, unless the indi-
vidual can demonstrate a special need to 
carry the firearm; 
Whereas these State laws are inconsistent 
with the plain meaning of the right to bear 
arms and the rights granted to individuals 
by the Second Amendment; and 
Whereas established Federal processes and 
procedures regulating the right to purchase 
and possess a firearm are sufficient to pro-
vide for the interests of public safety: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That it is the sense 
of Congress that undue restrictions on the 
right of law-abiding gun owners to carry a 
firearm 
for 
self-defense 
outside 
of 
the 
home— 
(1) violate both— 
(A) the intent of the Founding Fathers, as 
expressed by James Madison in The Fed-
eralist No. 46; and 
(B) the clear meaning of the Second 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States ‘‘to keep and bear Arms’’; and 
(2) are unlawful infringements of the rights 
granted by the Second Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States.
