PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God of abundant grace, thank You 
for the bounty of gifts You have 
showered upon us. It is You who have 
supplied seed for the sower and bread 
for food. If only we take time to look, 
we discover that You have given us all 
that we require. You have enriched us 
in every way, and we come before You 
overflowing with gratitude. 
Now, as we have so richly received, 
may we richly give. 
As we savor the supply and enjoy the 
increase of our welfare, may we look 
for every occasion to be unsparing to 
those who do not experience those 
same privileges. 
As we have been enriched by the har-
vest of Your righteousness made avail-
able to us, may we show our thanks-
giving to You through our generosity 
of spirit and collegiality with those to 
whom You have called us to serve. 
God, cause us to pause and realize 
how profoundly we have been blessed. 
May we be intentional, even deliberate, 
this day in sharing Your surpassing 
grace. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

Ms. FOXX led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows:

United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

THE CHILD TAX CREDIT IS 
SLASHING CHILD POVERTY 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of a bold build back better 
agenda that invests in addressing cli-
mate change, grows our economy, in-
vests in children and education, and 
makes sure that every American has 
healthcare. We face a once-in-a-life-
time opportunity, and we have to move 
forward. 
We have to invest in our children, 
and we cannot allow for an obstinate 
few to threaten to squander any of this 
for their own vanity. 
We have to come together to find a 
center path forward. It is not this side 
or that side, but it is, rather, let’s work 
together for progress that improves the 
security and the prosperity of the peo-
ple we represent. 
Already, we have seen the immense 
good that policies like the expanded 
monthly child tax credit can do. The 
child tax credit is slashing child pov-
erty. 
I recently spoke with Amanda Doug-
las, a single mother in my district with 
two young children, Axel and Avery. 
With the child tax credit, Amanda said 
that she no longer feels unbearable 
stress on a daily basis, that she is able 
to pay her bills and provide for her 
sons. So for Amanda, Axel, and Avery, 
for every family striving to realize the 
American Dream, we need to be invest-
ing in our families and young people to 
ensure that every child has the oppor-
tunities they deserve, not playing po-
litical games or holding people’s fu-
tures hostage.

BRING 
HOME 
THE 
17 
MISSION-
ARIES TAKEN HOSTAGE IN HAITI 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, this weekend, 17 Christian 
missionaries were taken hostage in 
Haiti. 
I have spoken with their family 
members. To hear their story is heart-
breaking. These men and women went 
to Haiti because they felt called to 
serve. They said: ‘‘Here I am, Lord, 
send me.’’ 
We cannot allow for Americans to be 
kidnapped abroad. When these mission-
aries went to serve, they were met with 
violence. Attacks like this prove that 
we must remain committed to the safe-
ty and the security of Americans 
abroad. We must never capitulate to 
those who wish us harm. Whether it is

in Haiti, in Afghanistan, or even on our 
southern border, Americans must al-
ways be protected. 
Now is the time to bring these Amer-
ican missionaries safely home. I urge 
all of my colleagues to join with me in 
prayer for the safe return of our mis-
sionaries. 
f 
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S 
ATTACK ON PARENTS 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, Democrats 
are politicizing the Justice Depart-
ment and embarking on a witch hunt, 
this time to go after parents. 
Parents across the country are brave-
ly taking a stand to protect their chil-
dren against overly restrictive COVID– 
19 mandates and identity politics in-
doctrination. In response, the Biden ad-
ministration is weaponizing law en-
forcement agencies to intimidate them 
into silence. 
Some parents have crossed the line. 
Harassing and threatening school offi-
cials is unacceptable. 
But there is no evidence that parents 
pose a widespread threat to school ad-
ministrators. Yet, the National School 
Boards Association is asking the Biden 
administration to treat these parents 
like domestic terrorists. 
Attorney General Merrick Garland’s 
outrageous memo, giving credence to 
these accusations, shows the Biden ad-
ministration cares more about appeas-
ing special interests than Americans 
concerned about their children. 
This attack on the First Amendment 
cannot continue. Parents must be al-
lowed to stand up for their kids. 
f 
RUGBY IN THE U.S.A. 
(Mr. MOONEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, as co- 
chair of the Congressional Rugby Cau-
cus, along with D.C. Delegate ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON, I am very excited to 
see the legendary New Zealand All 
Blacks take the pitch against the 
U.S.A. men’s national rugby team 
when they face off this Saturday, Octo-
ber 23. We hope to pack FedExField 
here in the D.C. area. 
The All Blacks of New Zealand are 
the world’s most famous rugby club. 
They strike fear in their opponents 
with their world-famous traditional 
pregame war dance, called the haka. 
As a bonus, the Army Black Knights 
will face off against the U.S. Naval 
Academy Midshipmen in the curtain- 
raiser match. 
Men’s and women’s rugby are fast- 
growing sports in America and give us 
all a chance to put partisan politics 
aside. That is why bringing an inter-
national event of this magnitude to the 
D.C. area is a tremendous accomplish-
ment for U.S.A. Rugby, Events D.C., 
and Left Field Live. The match is an 
important barometer of the United 
States’ ability to host future world- 
class 
events, 
including 
the 
Rugby 
World Cup. 
Please support the game of rugby by 
joining me this Saturday, October 23, 
here in D.C. at FedExField. 
f 
INFLATION IS AT A 30-YEAR HIGH 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today on behalf of 
American families and small busi-
nesses in North Carolina who are hav-
ing to confront not only the pandemic 
but President Biden’s truly disastrous 
and shortsighted economic policies. 
Inflation is at a 30-year high. Gas 
prices are up 42 percent. Hell, even the 
cost of bacon has gone through the 
roof. 
We are hurtling backwards under lib-
eral control, and the fact that Demo-
crats are trying to sell a free $5.5 tril-
lion package as the solution is an em-
barrassment and a snake oil lie to the 
American people. 
Let’s be clear. Most liberal elites and 
progressives in Washington have never 
run a business. They have never signed 
both sides of a paycheck, and they have 
never had to make the heartbreaking 
decision between feeding their families 
and keeping their businesses open. 
At a small business roundtable, one 
local bakery owner said that crippling 
inflation, the self-induced labor short-
age, and supply chain disruptions have 
created such a fragile environment 
that he is one worker away from bank-
ruptcy. 
This bakery owner even raised his 
own employee pay by $4 an hour and 
took a second job to make ends meet, 
and he still cannot fill job vacancies. 
f 
CELEBRATING MINNESOTA’S BLUE 
RIBBON CITY 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Moose Lake, Min-
nesota, as they become the second Blue 
Ribbon City in the world, thanks to the 
leadership of Moose Lake Elementary 
teacher Brad Hubred and his student 
Piper Nielson. 
For the last 13 years, Brad has taken 
the time to write every one of his stu-
dents a personal, handwritten letter 
highlighting all of the positives he sees 
in them in an effort to reduce suicide. 
Recently, Brad teamed up with sixth- 
grade student Piper Nielson to take 
part in the Standing Strong Together 
class through the nationwide Blue Rib-
bon 
Program, 
where 
they 
learned 
methods to inspire and uplift others. 
As ambassadors of the Blue Ribbon 
Program, both Brad and Piper decided 
to take what they learned in the class-
room and put it into action by ordering 
5,000 blue ribbons for all of the resi-
dents of the Moose Lake community to 
remind them of their worth and value. 
I applaud both Brad and Piper for 
joining such a wonderful, important 
movement. Minnesota’s Eighth Dis-
trict is a better place because of their 
ongoing effort, and it is the honor of a 
lifetime to represent such honorable 
people in Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Brad, 
Piper, and the entire Moose Lake com-
munity on becoming a Blue Ribbon 
City, and I wish them all the best as 
they continue to support one another. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO JOHN G. 
STEWART 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to pay tribute to John G. Stewart, who 
passed away in September at the age of 
86 years. 
John led an accomplished public 
service career, Mr. Speaker. It was 
highlighted by his work on the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 as an aide to then- 
Senator Hubert Humphrey. When Hum-
phrey became Vice President in 1965, 
John joined him in President Lyndon 
Johnson’s administration. 
John left Washington for Knoxville 
in 1980, continuing his career at the 
Tennessee Valley Authority as an as-
sistant general manager and vice presi-
dent for economic and community de-
velopment. He retired from TVA in 
1994. John also founded the Georgian 
Institute of Public Administration in 
the Republic of Georgia and served as a 
consultant on NASA’s Aerospace Safe-
ty Advisory Panel. 
All who were close to John can attest 
that he cared about people in an ex-
traordinary way. For example, after 
the 2008 Kingston coal ash spill, John 
and Nancy raised funds for workers 
whose health was severely harmed dur-
ing the cleanup effort. 
John also fought for the people who 
couldn’t 
fight 
for 
themselves 
and 
looked out for the little guy. His gen-
erous spirit touched everyone in his 
life, and he will be missed by all who 
knew him. John is survived by his wife 
of 64 years, Nancy, and two children, 
Mike and Cara. 
It is not in my notes, but on a per-
sonal note, John helped me when I was 
in the State senate to abolish Ten-
nessee’s sales tax on food. He will be 
missed.

OF DR. STUART WEINSTEIN 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and

professional in my district. Recently, 
Dr. Stuart Weinstein, the Ignacio V. 
Ponseti 
chair 
and 
professor 
of 
orthopaedic surgery and professor of 
pediatrics at the University of Iowa, 
was awarded the Lifetime Achievement 
Award from the Scoliosis Research So-
ciety for his incredible work studying 
pediatric spinal deformity. 
Since joining the Department of 
Orthopaedic Surgery at the University 
of Iowa in 1976, Stu has worked to 
make our community and the whole 
world a better place. 
Stu has published over 250 scientific 
articles in some of the most well- 
known and prestigious peer-reviewed 
journals. His research has focused on 
spinal deformity in children and the 
natural history and long-term outcome 
of pediatric musculoskeletal disorders. 
Listing and discussing all of Stu’s ac-
complishments 
would 
take 
much 
longer than one minute, so I will close 
by saying how grateful I am to have 
people like Stu living in Iowa’s Second 
District. I also tell anyone I meet that 
Iowa is the best place to live, work, 
and raise a family. With outstanding 
citizens like Stu, we will continue to 
hold that title. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to ex-
tend my enthusiasm with a happy 
birthday to our colleague from Cali-
fornia, 
the 
Honorable 
YOUNG
KIM. 
Happy birthday to YOUNG.

REMEMBERING KENNETH BAKER 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Lee Center 
Fire Chief Kenny Baker, who passed 
away recently after a long-fought bat-
tle due to complications of a brain 
tumor. 
Ken was known by all as a noble, car-
ing, and loving man. He joined the Lee 
Center Volunteer Fire Department at 
the age of 30 and served for 48 years 
straight. For 28 of those years, Ken was 
the chief, the longest tenure in the de-
partment’s history. 
Ken also served in the U.S. Navy and 
was the former president of the Oneida 
County Fire Chiefs Association. 
But 
most 
importantly, 
Ken 
was 
known for his tremendous family and 
his love for his family, particularly his 
wife, Patti, who was his guiding light. 
His son, Joseph Baker, succeeded him 
as the fire chief, and Ken’s grand-
daughter, Ashley, and grandson, Tyler, 
followed their grandfather into the fire 
service with the Lee Center Fire De-
partment. 
I considered Ken a great friend. He 
was a courageous, principled, and tena-
cious man. He was a hometown hero 
and a role model for many, including 
me. And, boy, was he fun. 
Ken, I just want to say thank you to 
you for your friendship and your pro-
found legacy of service to our commu-
nity. May you rest in peace. 
God bless his family.

$5 TRILLION SPENDING-PALOOZA 
(Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to oppose the nearly $5 tril-
lion spending package the Democrats 
have tied together. 
This package would massively ex-
pand the role of the Federal Govern-
ment into the lives of every American, 
and it would significantly raise taxes 
on people and businesses in Michigan. 
There is no doubt we need to invest 
in roads, bridges, runways, harbors, 
and rural broadband, but tax increases 
in this package will make America less 
competitive. 
We need a tax structure that attracts 
businesses so that there are more jobs 
in America, more products are made 
here, and our supply chains are more 
secure. 
This $5 trillion spending package will 
do just the opposite. It will raise taxes, 
make our country less competitive, 
and increase the overall cost of living 
and doing business in America. 
These costs will be passed on to all of 
us, increasing inflation and hurting 
families and seniors across the coun-
try. I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’

JOHN FARR’S 898-MILE 
FUNDRAISER 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
John Farr of DuBois, Pennsylvania. 
John recently completed a 16-day, 
898-mile bike ride to raise awareness 
and support for Habitat for Humanity 
of Clearfield County. 
On October 4, he arrived in Wash-
ington, D.C., for a much-needed rest 
day before completing the final leg of 
his journey to Clearfield. 
John started his cycling fundraising 
in 2001 when he signed up for a 2-day, 
150-mile fundraiser sponsored by Habi-
tat for Humanity New York. Since 
then, he has completed 20 excursions. 
John has always been involved in his 
community, from tutoring students 
when he was in college to coaching 
sports. He enjoys giving back. 
He joined Habitat for Humanity in 
1994, originally donating monthly, to 
eventually joining the board and serv-
ing as president. 
His cycling fundraisers have taken 
him across the United States and even 
across the Canadian border. His rides 
have led him to raise more than 
$150,000 for Habitat for Humanity. 
Mr. Speaker, John’s passion for help-
ing others is admirable. Congratula-
tions on completing this journey.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4369. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I 
on the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee have been working on legisla-
tion to invest in and support American 
pharmaceutical manufacturing to re-
duce our dependence on items produced 
abroad, such as active ingredients and 
raw materials. As the COVID–19 pan-
demic has made clear, domestic phar-
maceutical manufacturing is critical 
to our Nation’s public health and glob-
al economic competitiveness. 
The bill before us now, H.R. 4369, 
would leverage the expertise and inge-
nuity of academic institutions in the 
United States to help support and de-
velop advanced manufacturing tech-
nologies right here at home. The legis-
lation will improve the quality of our 
pharmaceuticals, reduce drug short-
ages, and help to produce more nimble 
and efficient manufacturing processes 
that could be replicated throughout 
the Nation. 
Specifically, H.R. 4369 would direct 
the Food and Drug Administration to 
designate a number of American aca-
demic institutions as national centers 
of excellence. It then provides funding 
to these centers to develop advanced 
and continuous manufacturing. 
Now, continuous manufacturing is an 
emerging technology whereby a fin-
ished product is produced in a contin-
uous stream, making it more efficient 
than the current so-called batch model 
that can be slow and may be subject to 
the risk of defects or errors during the 
manufacturing process. 
The centers would be required to 
work closely with the FDA and indus-
try to support regulatory guidance and 
expertise, catalyze research and devel-
opment in advanced and continuous 
manufacturing technologies, and cul-
tivate an advanced pharmaceutical 
manufacturing workforce here in the 
United States. 
The legislation requires that the ma-
jority of the $100 million in funding be 
awarded directly to the designated cen-
ters of excellence, while also providing 
resources for FDA technical assistance, 
guidance, or training. 
H.R. 4369 sets us on the right track 
for advanced manufacturing here at 
home. 
This legislation passed the House last 
Congress but was not taken up in the 
Senate. If we are to meet the goal and 
demand for uninterrupted access and 
supply of critical drugs and active 
pharmaceutical ingredients, the time 
to act is now. 
I want to thank our Health Sub-
committee Ranking Member GUTHRIE 
for working with me on this legisla-
tion, as well as full committee Rank-
ing Member RODGERS and Health Sub-
committee Chairwoman ANNA ESHOO. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
4369, and I hope the Senate will follow 
suit so that we can finally expand ad-
vanced and continuous manufacturing 
technology here in the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4369, the National Centers 
of Excellence in Advanced and Contin-
uous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing 
Act, a bill I introduced with my col-
league, Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee Chairman FRANK PALLONE. I en-
joyed working with him on this bill. 
In 2016, I was proud to work with my 
fellow committee members on the 21st 
Century Cures Act, which included leg-
islation to issue grants for institutions 
of higher education to study the proc-
ess of continuous pharmaceutical man-
ufacturing. 
H.R. 4369, which we are considering 
today, builds on this partnership estab-
lished in the Cures Act. Advanced and 
continuous manufacturing for pharma-
ceuticals is a new technology that al-
lows for drugs to be produced in a con-
tinuous stream, helping drugs get into 
the market faster. 
This is something that has become 
increasingly 
important 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. We need to ensure 
that our drug supply chain does not de-
pend too heavily on other countries, 
such as China. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
4369, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers. I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, this 
is an important bill. We have all seen 
what happened with COVID–19, our de-
pendence on the global supply chain, 
particularly in pharmaceuticals. It is a 
national security issue that we have 
our own production here. 
As we saw, we have had shortages 
during the height of the pandemic, and 
we are still experiencing other supply 
chain issues. As we know, those will 
work themselves out. 
Having access to our own pharma-
ceuticals is not a luxury that we have 
time for them to work out themselves. 
We are hopeful that we will get things 
moving again in a normal supply chain, 
but we absolutely must take the action 
necessary to make sure that we make 
it in America, and we don’t depend on 
countries such as China. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the passage 
of this bill. I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I, 
too, would say this is an important 
bill, both from the point of view of 
moving toward more domestic manu-
facturing and addressing the supply 
chain shortages that we saw during 
COVID–19 for drugs. 
Madam Speaker, I ask for Members 
to support this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4369, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
STATE OPIOID RESPONSE GRANT 
AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2379) to amend the 21st Cen-
tury Cures Act to reauthorize and ex-
pand a grant program for State re-
sponse to the opioid use disorders cri-
sis, and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 2379. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2379, the State Opioid Response 
Grant Authorization Act of 2021. 
The substance use and opioid crisis 
continues to be a public health emer-
gency and has evolved into a dev-
astating dual threat when combined 
with the impacts of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Opioids are the leading cause of drug 
overdose deaths in the United States. 
Tragically, last year, more than 93,000 
Americans died from an opioid over-
dose. That is the highest 12-month 
death toll since the beginning of the 
opioid epidemic. 
Now, 
experts 
suspect 
that 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic only exacerbated 
this terrible record last year. Overall, 
it is estimated that more than 20 mil-
lion Americans have a substance use 
disorder. While treatment and services 
are available, many do not have access 
to or are not aware of the care in their 
communities. 
H.R. 2379 basically supports our ongo-
ing work to combat the opioid crisis, 
and the legislation enhances our efforts 
in the 21st Century Cures Act and the 
SUPPORT for Patients and Commu-
nities Act. It does this by authorizing 
the 
Substance 
Abuse 
and 
Mental 
Health Services Administration State 
Opioid Response grant program, better 
known as SAMHSA’s SOR grant pro-
gram. 
The bill also aligns the authorization 
with authorities included in the 21st 
Century Cures Act. 
Although the SAMHSA grant pro-
gram has been funded through the ap-
propriations process since 2018, it does 
not have a statutory authorization. 
This legislation provides that impor-
tant authorization and ensures future 
funding. 
Today, the SOR grants are used to 
enhance prevention and recovery ac-
tivities across the States, including 
support services to address stimulant 
misuse and use disorders. These grants 
also reduce barriers to medication-as-
sisted treatment for opioid use dis-
order, which is critical to addressing 
the treatment gap and reducing the 
number of overdose deaths. 
This bill also provides Congress more 
information and transparency about 
existing funding, including the formula 
used to make allocations to States. 
This information will allow us to ex-
amine how changes to these allocations 
impact the progress States are making 
to address the opioid crisis. 
It is important for this program to 
direct resources to communities most 
in need or where surges in opioid or 
stimulant use are occurring, and this 
information will help us make sure 
that resources are getting to where 
they are needed the most. 
I want to thank the sponsor of the 
bill, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
TRONE), for his leadership on this issue. 
I also want to thank my Republican 
committee colleagues for their support 
on this legislation, as we continue our 
work to address the substance use cri-
sis in this country. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
bill 
unani-
mously passed the House last year. I 
urge my colleagues to support it once 
again today. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2379, the State Opioid Re-
sponse Grant Authorization Act. This 
important bill authorizes the appro-
priations for the State Opioid Response 
grant program administered by the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration. 
The United States still remains in 
the midst of an opioid crisis that has 
only been exacerbated by the COVID–19 
pandemic. Federal grants have pro-
vided a substantial level of support to 
States that are on the front lines of ad-
dressing substance use disorders, in-
cluding opioid and stimulant use dis-
orders. 
H.R. 2379 would ensure continued, 
predictable support for substance use 
disorder prevention, treatment, and re-
covery efforts for several years. I sup-
port passage of this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
TRONE), the author of the bill. 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to support 
my bill, the State Opioid Response 
Grant Authorization Act. 
This bipartisan bill directly address-
es the worsening opioid crisis by au-
thorizing $10.5 billion over 6 years in 
grants to States and Tribes. This fund-
ing will prevent and treat those suf-
fering from addiction. 
During Recovery Month last month, I 
met with several healthcare providers 
to discuss the challenges faced by those 
in recovery. We hear time and time 
again how individuals in recovery often 
struggle to access the resources they 
need. 
This bill meets the moment by giving 
States and Tribes the consistent, nec-
essary funding they need to meet their 
specific needs. 
I want to thank Energy and Com-
merce Chairman PALLONE and Ranking 
Member 
MCMORRIS
RODGERS, 
and 
Health 
Subcommittee 
Chairwoman 
ESHOO, and my friend, Subcommittee 
Ranking Member GUTHRIE, for consid-
ering this bill. 
I thank our bipartisan sponsors. In 
particular, I want to thank Congress-
woman SHERRILL, Congressman BAIRD, 
and Congressman ARMSTRONG for their 
advocacy. I am so grateful to the mem-
bers of the Bipartisan Addiction and 
Mental Health Task Force for helping 
us get this over the finish line. 
When we put aside partisan politics 
and focus on the real issues and work 
hard, we can make a difference. For 
these reasons, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the State Opioid Response Grant Au-
thorization Act. 
b 1615 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Maryland for the 
kind words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS), 
my friend and an important member of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 2379, the State 
Opioid Response Grant Authorization 
Act. 
This legislation provides critical re-
sources to State and local governments 
combating the opioid crisis that has 
crippled 
communities 
across 
the 
United States, including Utah. 
This legislation will give State and 
local governments flexibility in ad-
dressing this tragic epidemic in their 
communities. 
For example, in Utah there are sig-
nificant socioeconomic differences be-
tween Price and Orem, two commu-
nities I represent that are both fight-
ing addiction. 
We have to allow experts on the 
ground to address these challenges ac-
cordingly, which is why I strongly sup-
port this legislation. 
Equally as important is ensuring we 
have the workforce to treat individuals 
suffering with addiction. 
That is why I recently introduced the 
Helping Enable Access to Lifesaving 
Services Act, or the HEALS Act. 
The HEALS Act would complement 
the State opioid response grants with 
targeted Federal dollars to help train 
future behavioral healthcare workers 
in areas of high need. 
Taken together, these are the nec-
essary steps to fight addiction in com-
munities across our country, which has 
taken the lives of nearly 100,000 Ameri-
cans in this past year alone. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
2379 and my legislation, the HEALS 
Act. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DEUTCH). 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from New Jersey 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2379 to extend and broaden our ef-
forts to help Americans with substance 
use disorder get the help they need to 
help prevent addiction and to save 
lives. 
I thank my friends, Mr. TRONE and 
Ms. SHERRILL, for their leadership. 
Earlier this year, the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration and Centers for Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention

that opioid response grantees will now 
be able to use these funds to expand ac-
cess to fentanyl test strips. 
Tragically, that announcement came 
just 1 month after the death of my dear 
nephew, Eli Weinstock. 
At just 20 years old, Eli died of an un-
intentional fentanyl overdose after in-
gesting a legal herbal supplement 
tainted with fentanyl. 
Out of our grief, Eli’s family created 
an organization, BirdieLight, to in-
crease awareness of fentanyl risks and 
the tools like fentanyl test strips need-
ed to save lives. 
From 2019 to 2020, overdose deaths 
spiked by over 22,000 to a record 93,331 
Americans who died of overdose in 2020. 
Young people aged 15 to 24 saw a 
nearly 50 percent increase in 1 year. 
Last month, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration issued its first public 
safety alert in 6 years to warn of the 
surge of counterfeit pills laced with 
fentanyl. 
The DEA has seized over 11.3 million 
fake pills over the past year, more than 
the previous 2 years combined. 
Fentanyl has been found in fake imi-
tations of real prescription medica-
tions, including oxycodone, Xanax, and 
stimulants like Adderall. 
These substances are easily acquired 
on social media platforms or from 
friends who have no idea where they 
came from or what is in them. 
We need to talk about this. We need 
to change this. We need to act. 
We need to do it for Eli and for the 
hundreds of Americans who die of over-
dose every day in this country. 
This legislation is an important first 
step. I urge my colleagues to vote for 
it. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Across the country, the opioid epi-
demic is devastating families and com-
munities. 
In Rhode Island, the COVID–19 pan-
demic is only worsening this crisis. In 
2020 alone, accidental overdose deaths 
in Rhode Island increased by 25 per-
cent, with most involving opioids. 
State Opioid Response funding has 
been critical to combating this deadly 
epidemic and helped provide Rhode Is-
landers with the resources we need to 
combat drug abuse, prevent overdoses, 
and save lives. 
The majority of Rhode Islanders who 
lost their lives to an opioid overdose in 
recent years had a history of substance 
abuse without treatment, and we need 
resources to intervene now. 
State Opioid Response funding has 
helped provide the support and treat-
ment people suffering addiction need so 
desperately. 
It means access to naloxone and 
training on how to use it. It means 
paths to recovery. And it means saving 
lives. 
I thank Representative TRONE for in-
troducing H.R. 2379, the State Opioid 
Response Grant Authorization Act of 
2021 to support States in their fight 
against this opioid epidemic. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
critical legislation and save lives. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
think this is a good bill. It is an impor-
tant bill. 
All of our States have been affected 
by the opioid crisis, so it is good that 
we are here today focusing on this in a 
bipartisan way working together. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the support 
of this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
PALLONE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
again, this is a very important bill ad-
dressing the opioid epidemic with these 
various grant programs. 
Madam Speaker, I would ask for sup-
port on a bipartisan basis, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2379, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES 
PANDEMIC RELIEF ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 654) to provide the Adminis-
trator of the Drug-Free Communities 
Support Program the authority to 
waive the Federal fund limitation for 
the Drug-Free Communities Support 
Program, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 654 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Drug-Free Com-
munities Pandemic Relief Act’’. 
SEC. 2. WAIVER OF FEDERAL FUND LIMITATION 
FOR THE DRUG-FREE COMMUNITIES 
SUPPORT PROGRAM. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subsection (b), if 
the Administrator of the Drug-Free Communities 
Support Program determines that, as a result of 
the public health emergency declared pursuant 
to section 319 of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 247d) as a result of COVID–19, an eli-
gible coalition is unable to raise the amount of 
non-Federal funds, including in-kind contribu-
tions, agreed to be raised by the coalition for a 
fiscal year under an agreement entered into 
with the Administrator pursuant to paragraph 
(1)(A) or (3) of section 1032(b) of the Anti-Drug 
Abuse Act of 1988 (21 U.S.C. 1532(b)), the Ad-
ministrator may, notwithstanding such para-
graphs, provide to the eligible coalition the 
grant or renewal grant, as applicable, for that 
fiscal year in an amount— 
(1) with respect to an initial grant or renewal 
grant described under paragraph (1)(A) or 
(3)(A) of such section, that exceeds the amount 
of non-Federal funds raised by the eligible coali-
tion, including in-kind contributions, for that 
fiscal year; 
(2) with respect to a renewal grant described 
under paragraph (3)(D)(i) of such section, that 
exceeds 125 percent of the amount of non-Fed-
eral funds raised by the eligible coalition, in-
cluding in-kind contributions, for that fiscal 
year; and 
(3) with respect to a renewal grant described 
under paragraph (3)(D)(ii) of such section, that 
exceeds 150 percent of the amount of non-Fed-
eral funds raised by the eligible coalition, in-
cluding in-kind contributions, for that fiscal 
year. 
(b) LIMITATION.—The Administrator may not 
provide a grant or renewal grant to an eligible 
coalition in an amount exceeding the amount of 
funds initially agreed to be provided by the Ad-
ministrator under the applicable agreement. 
SEC. 3. RAISING CAP ON ADMINISTRATIVE EX-
PENSES UNDER ANTI-DRUG ABUSE 
ACT OF 1988. 
Section 1024(b) of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 
1988 (21 U.S.C. 1524(b)) is amended by striking 
‘‘8 percent’’ and inserting ‘‘12 percent’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 654. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 654, the Drug-Free Communities 
Pandemic Relief Act. 
Since 1998, the Drug-Free Commu-
nities Program has been a pillar of our 
Nation’s drug, alcohol, and tobacco 
prevention efforts. 
The program is designed with com-
munity-based approaches in mind to 
reach at-risk communities, including 
racial and ethnic minorities and the 
LGBTQ community. It is estimated 
that one in five Americans live in a 
community with a Drug-Free Commu-
nities Coalition, and over 300,000 part-
ners are engaged in prevention efforts. 
Like many mission-driven, commu-
nity-service organizations, Drug-Free 
Communities Coalitions have faced un-
precedented 
challenges 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Many have had 
trouble sustaining their programming 
amid increasing rates of substance use. 
This is in part due to an inability to 
meet the matching fund requirements 
required of those receiving Drug-Free 
Communities grants. 
H.R. 654 would allow the Drug-Free 
Communities 
Coalitions 
to

matching fund waivers and resume 
their work to enhance drug, alcohol, 
and tobacco prevention efforts. The 
legislation also allows additional funds 
to be made available for expanded tech-
nical assistance by the Drug-Free Com-
munities Program, as requested in the 
administration’s fiscal year 2022 budg-
et. This additional support would pro-
vide critical resources to the Drug-Free 
Communities 
Coalitions 
facing 
the 
greatest challenges posed by the pan-
demic. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
654, a bipartisan bill that will allow im-
portant work to continue in our com-
munities. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 654, the Drug-Free Commu-
nities Pandemic Relief Act, which was 
introduced by Representatives JOYCE 
and KILMER. 
The Drug-Free Communities Support 
Program funds community-based coali-
tions that work to prevent youth sub-
stance use disorders. Their work at the 
local level is important, especially as 
we sadly saw a record in overdose 
deaths last year. 
We all know that the economic con-
sequences of the pandemic have im-
pacted many sectors, and that includes 
the sustainability of the Drug-Free 
Communities Support Program. Under 
current law, coalitions that receive 
Federal grants must match part of the 
funding with non-Federal funds. But 
the economic consequences of the pan-
demic have left many coalitions strug-
gling to meet the matching require-
ment. 
H.R. 654 temporarily permits the Of-
fice of National Drug Control Policy to 
waive the local matching requirement 
if a coalition is unable to fulfill this re-
quirement due to the pandemic. Pro-
viding targeted relief for these coali-
tions will help them continue to imple-
ment local strategies to address the in-
creases in substance use disorders and 
overdose deaths in our communities. 
I thank Representatives JOYCE and 
KILMER for leading the support initia-
tive, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JOYCE), who is the primary 
sponsor of this piece of legislation. 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of my bill, the 
Drug-Free Communities Pandemic Re-
lief Act. 
The unfortunate reality is that while 
the COVID–19 pandemic ravaged our 
Nation last year, so did the opioid cri-
sis. 
More than 93,000 overdose deaths 
were reported in 2020. 
Meanwhile, enough fentanyl has been 
seized at our southern border this year 
to kill the entire U.S. population seven 
times over. 
And just the other week, the DEA 
warned that counterfeit pills laced 
with this deadly synthetic opioid are 
spreading across all 50 States. 
These statistics are harrowing, and 
the stories of loss they cause are heart-
breaking. All of us have loved ones, 
friends, or neighbors in our commu-
nities that have been impacted. 
As a former Geauga County pros-
ecutor, I saw firsthand how addiction 
has devastated communities in north-
east Ohio and know how important it 
is to support local efforts that reduce 
and prevent youth drug use. 
That is why I introduced the Drug- 
Free Communities Pandemic Relief 
Act with my friend and colleague on 
the other side of the aisle, Congress-
man KILMER. 
Recognizing that local problems need 
local solutions, the Drug-Free Commu-
nities Program provides funding to 
local coalitions that engage multiple 
sectors of their communities in order 
to reduce and prevent substance abuse 
disorder among younger Americans. 
No other drug prevention program 
has consistently achieved the same re-
duction in youth drug use than the 
Drug-Free Communities Program has. 
However, hundreds of coalitions have 
been unable to meet the program’s 
local matching requirements due to fi-
nancial 
difficulties 
caused 
by 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
My bipartisan legislation will address 
that challenge and ensure these coali-
tions have the resources and flexibility 
they need during these difficult times 
to combat the crisis of addiction grip-
ping our country. 
With more Americans dying from 
drug overdoses than ever before, it is 
critical that we do everything we can 
to support and empower those working 
on the front lines in our communities 
to reduce and prevent addiction among 
our children. 
I strongly urge all my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill today.

Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, my friend from Ohio 
said it best. Local solutions to commu-
nity problems. It is a national problem. 
It is a statewide problem. But it is hap-
pening in each community, and so local 
solutions are part of the strategy mov-
ing forward. And giving these coali-
tions the opportunity to participate in 
these grants as they have seen some 
other funding and other resources dry 
up due to the pandemic, it is something 
that is important for us to continue 
and move this forward. I appreciate my 
friend from Ohio and my other good 
friend from Washington State for mov-
ing this forward. 
Madam Speaker, I urge its passage, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
urge support for this bill. It is very im-
portant in terms of trying to promote 
these coalitions at a local community 
level to prevent drug overuse. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 3635. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 3635, the Strengthening 
America’s Strategic National Stock-
pile Act of 2021. 
This bill makes long-overdue im-
provements to the Strategic National 
Stockpile to ensure we have access to 
critical lifesaving medical supplies dur-
ing public health emergencies. Since 
the beginning of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, there has been a lot of attention 
around the Strategic National Stock-
pile and our preparedness for this pan-
demic. 
The stockpile was not stocked as it 
should have been and this bill makes 
important improvements to correct 
that for the future. The bill will ensure 
that the Strategic National Stockpile, 
also known as SNS, is operating at its 
highest potential moving forward in 
order to continue to respond to COVID– 
19, and also to prepare for the next pub-
lic health emergency. 
This bipartisan bill seeks to reduce 
America’s 
dependence 
on 
foreign 
sources of critical medical supplies, in-
cluding personal protective equipment. 
It does this by boosting domestic man-
ufacturing to make those supplies in 
the United States and promoting pri-
vate-public partnerships to ensure a co-
ordinated response. The legislation 
also makes needed improvements to 
the Strategic National Stockpile to en-
sure it is fully equipped with medical 
supplies that are safe and in working 
order. 
Importantly, the bill also improves 
transparency around the readiness of 
the Strategic National Stockpile and 
how requests from States and Tribes 
are being managed. It also directs the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services to develop and implement im-
proved, transparent processes for these 
types of requests moving forward. This 
will be critical for ensuring adequate 
supplies within the Strategic National 
Stockpile, as well as informing readi-
ness efforts in the States and also at 
Tribal levels. 
As healthcare systems all across our 
Nation continue to be stretched to the 
limit combating the COVID–19 Delta 
variant, we need to continue to push 
solutions 
that 
support 
our 
public 
health and national security response 
capability. The improvements to the 
Strategic National Stockpile put for-
ward in this bill are critical to pro-
tecting our frontline workers and pa-
tients with the supplies that they need 
to stay safe. 
Madam Speaker, I commend the bi-
partisan leadership of Representatives 
SLOTKIN and HUDSON in preparing this 
bill. This bipartisan bill was passed out 
of the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce and by this House unanimously 
last Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to once again join me in strong 
support of this important bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 3635, Strengthening America’s 
Strategic 
National 
Stockpile 
Act, 
which was spearheaded by Representa-
tives HUDSON and SLOTKIN. This legisla-
tion includes several critical initia-
tives that will improve the Strategic 
National Stockpile, or SNS. 
First, the bill allows the SNS to 
transfer products between federal agen-
cies and to ensure they are used before 
their expiration. 
Second, the bill directs the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services to exam-
ine user fee agreements, ensure the 
SNS products are in working order, and 
allows agreements with domestic pro-
ducers to improve the supply chain to 
refresh and replenish existing stocks. 
Third, the bill directs the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention to report on distributions 
from the SNS, as well as requests for 
supplies from State, local, Tribal, and 
territorial agencies. 
Finally, the bill authorizes a pilot 
program to establish State stockpiles. 
We must ensure our country is pre-
pared to combat the next health crisis, 
no matter if it is from a disease, dis-
aster, or terrorism. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan leg-
islation to improve and sustain the 
Strategic National Stockpile, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON), my col-
league, and a primary sponsor of this 
piece of legislation. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 3635, Strengthening 
America’s Strategic National Stock-
pile Act of 2021, a bill I am proud to 
have introduced along with Represent-
ative SLOTKIN. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed 
the dangers of relying on foreign coun-
tries for needed medical supplies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5654 
October 19, 2021 
H.R. 3635 will reduce our dependence 
on foreign sources of supplies like PPE 
by boosting domestic manufacturing to 
make these products here in the United 
States. It would also make critical im-
provements to our Strategic National 
Stockpile to ensure it is full and items 
are ready to be deployed when needed. 
Strengthening our stockpile of PPE 
and domestic manufacturing has never 
been more important for our economy 
and our national security. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation 
so we can be better prepared for the 
next public health emergency. 
Madam Speaker, additionally, I am 
proud to have introduced H.R. 4032, the 
Open RAN Outreach Act, a bill that 
will also be considered by this House 
today. 
The Open RAN Outreach Act will 
strengthen 
our 
telecommunications 
supply chains and help protect small 
and rural communications providers 
from Chinese-backed companies. Pro-
tecting our supply chains and pushing 
back against China are more critical 
than ever before, especially for our vul-
nerable telecommunications networks. 
Providers backed by the Chinese Com-
munist Party have tried to undercut 
the market and expand their outreach, 
particularly in our underserved rural 
communities. 
By passing H.R. 4032, we can encour-
age a competitive market of trusted 
vendors to expand network access 
across our country. Just like H.R. 3635, 
this bill is also critical not just for our 
economy, but for our national security. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support it as well. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI), a mem-
ber of the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 3635, the 
Strengthening America’s Strategic Na-
tional Stockpile Act. A key lesson 
from the pandemic has been the abso-
lute need to end our dependence on the 
Chinese Communist Party for the pro-
duction of medicines, personal protec-
tive equipment, and other critical med-
ical supplies. 
Now more than ever, we know that 
secure and resilient supply chains are 
vital to the safety and success of the 
American people. It is so critical to 
focus on breaking our dependency on 
China and move domestic manufac-
turing of PPE products back home to 
the U.S. 
Early on in the pandemic, the De-
partment of Homeland Security con-
cluded that China ‘‘intentionally con-
cealed the severity’’ of this virus so 
they could hoard PPE by blocking ex-
ports and buying it up through its 
state-owned enterprises, a theory that 
has been confirmed time and time 
again. 
In March of 2020, the New York 
Times reported that factories in China 
were not authorized to export masks, 
and all the while bought up much of 
the world’s supply first. In February of 
last year, Chinese entrepreneurs and 
aid groups visited pharmacies in afflu-
ent countries and emerging markets, 
buying masks in bulk to send to China. 
Similarly, the Sydney Morning Her-
ald reported that the Greenland Group, 
a Chinese government-backed property 
giant, instructed its employees world-
wide—even accountants and reception-
ists and their HR teams—to stop what 
they were doing and bulk buy as many 
medical supplies as they could in Janu-
ary and February of 2020. 
It is quite simple. We must not trust 
the Chinese Communist Party. The bi-
partisan legislation before us today is a 
strong step in the right direction to-
ward strengthening American manu-
facturing of PPE in Indiana and across 
the rest of the country. 
Specifically, it includes the Medical 
Supplies for Pandemics Act I led with 
Congresswoman DINGELL, that would 
enhance medical supply chain elas-
ticity, improve the domestic produc-
tion of PPE, and partner with private 
industry to refresh and replenish exist-
ing stocks of medical supplies. 
Our legislation takes other impor-
tant measures, such as supporting 
State efforts to expand and maintain 
our own stockpiles, improving mainte-
nance of the national stockpile to en-
sure it is in good working order and 
allow the transfer of stockpile items 
nearing their expiration dates to other 
federal agencies. 
To prepare for the next crisis and 
better 
protect 
frontline 
healthcare 
workers, we need to boost U.S. manu-
facturing of PPE and strengthen the 
Strategic National Stockpile. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support, and 
I thank my colleagues. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support of 
this piece of legislation. 
Fortunately, the last big pandemic 
that came across the country was in 
1918, the flu pandemic, so over 100 
years. What we learned, although it 
was well-planned and all, the Strategic 
National Stockpile, until you really 
face a pandemic like we have, you 
don’t truly understand exactly every-
thing you need to do, although the 
Strategic 
National 
Stockpile 
was 
there, it was drawn from, it was used. 
There were a lot of lessons learned. 
Madam Speaker, it is important that 
we apply these lessons. I appreciate my 
colleagues for doing this, moving for-
ward. Hopefully, it will be another 100 
years or more before we have to use the 
Strategic National Stockpile, but it 
certainly is prudent that we are ready. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the passage 
of this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
agree with my colleague that what this 
bill does is basically take the lessons 
that we learned from the pandemic 
about what can be done to improve the 
Strategic National Stockpile for the 
future. 
Madam Speaker, I ask everyone to 
support the bill on a bipartisan basis, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3635. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
SECURE EQUIPMENT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3919) to ensure that the Fed-
eral Communications Commission does 
not approve radio frequency devices 
that pose a national security risk, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3919 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 3919. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 3919, the Secure Equipment Act of 
2021. 
Two years ago, we came together on 
a bipartisan basis to enact the Secure 
and Trusted Communications Act, leg-
islation that I proudly authored. That 
bill was an important first step toward 
securing commercial communications 
networks in the United States from 
untrusted foreign adversaries. Among 
other things, it prohibits certain funds 
provided by the Federal Communica-
tions Commission from being used to 
purchase or obtain network equipment 
and services from certain untrusted 
vendors. 
While that legislation established an 
important foundation and has made 
great strides in helping secure our 
communications networks, we have the 
opportunity today to take the next 
step by applying those same principles 
to the FCC’s equipment authorization 
process. We know our adversaries will 
use any and all potential avenues to 
weaken our networks, and therefore, 
we must remain vigilant and prevent it 
before they can do so. 
H.R. 3919 simply requires the FCC to 
update its equipment authorization 
rules so that, going forward, the agen-
cy will no longer review or approve any 
application for equipment from ven-
dors that have been determined to be a 
threat to our national security. 
Importantly, while this bill focuses 
only on the applications that the agen-
cy is in the process of reviewing or will 
receive in the future, it does not pre-
vent the FCC from later studying 
whether it should review equipment 
previously authorized but which is now 
known to pose a threat. 
Over the past several years, the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee has 
worked, on a bipartisan basis, on im-
portant security issues, and I commend 
Representatives Eshoo and Scalise for 
continuing in that tradition through 
their leadership and bipartisan work on 
this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the Secure Equip-
ment Act of 2021, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairman PALLONE and Ranking Mem-
ber RODGERS of the full committee, as 
well as Ranking Member LATTA and 
Chairman DOYLE of the Communica-
tions and Technology Subcommittee, 
for helping bring my bill, H.R. 3919, the 
Secure Equipment Act, to the House 
floor. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to espe-
cially thank Congresswoman ESHOO for 
partnering with me on this bill. We 
have worked on a number of tele-
communications laws, and this is yet 
another example of Congresswoman 
ESHOO and I coming together, and our 
staffs, to address a very important 
threat to American families. 
Madam Speaker, my bill is about one 
thing, and that is stopping the Chinese 
Communist Party and Chinese compa-
nies that act on their behalf from com-
promising 
our 
telecommunications 
networks and stopping them from jeop-
ardizing American national security 
and the important data that all Ameri-
cans hold sacred. 
H.R. 3919, the Secure Equipment Act, 
puts a full stop to China infiltrating 
our networks by prohibiting the FCC 
from issuing equipment licenses to Chi-
nese 
telecommunications 
equipment 
companies that are identified as na-
tional security threats. 
This legislation builds off the impor-
tant work of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee when it came together in a 
bipartisan manner in 2019, as Chairman 
PALLONE mentioned, on his critical leg-
islation that will address the threat of 
China by getting the Secure and Trust-
ed 
Communications 
Networks 
Act 
signed into law. 
One of the requirements of that act 
instructed the FCC to publish a list of 
telecommunication equipment compa-
nies deemed to be national security 
threats. In fact, earlier this year, the 
FCC published that list of companies. 
As you can see, five companies ended 
up on that list. All of these companies 
are Chinese companies that are either 
partly or wholly owned by the Chinese 
Government and that have ties to the 
CCP. 
Madam Speaker, we know all too 
well that the CCP wastes no time and 
no opportunity to expose American 
vulnerabilities and to try to undermine 
our national security. There are way 
too many examples of that. 
Since all Chinese companies are sub-
ject to Chinese national security laws, 
at any point the CCP could choose to 
exploit these listed companies and re-
quire them to tap into their access in 
American networks to gain critical, 
sensitive data, both from individuals as 
well as sensitive government informa-
tion. 
While the 2019 law made great strides 
in thwarting the threat of China in our 
networks, U.S. carriers can still pri-
vately purchase equipment from these 
listed companies on the open market. 
By prohibiting the FCC from issuing 
any equipment licenses to these com-
panies that are listed as national secu-
rity threats, our bill seeks to close the 
gap in existing law and slam the door 
on jeopardized Chinese equipment from 
threatening our American networks 
and from threatening the privacy and 
data of American families. 
Madam Speaker, the time has never 
been more urgent. It is important that 
this body do all it can to stop the 
undue and malign influences of the 
CCP from infiltrating our data and our 
telecommunications network. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. LATTA), the ranking member 
of the Communications and Tech-
nology Subcommittee. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana, my 
good friend, the whip of the Republican 
Party here in the House, for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 3919, the Secure Equip-
ment Act of 2021, which was introduced 
by Representatives Scalise and Eshoo. 
This bill takes an important step to 
strengthen the security of our commu-
nications network from bad actors like 
Huawei. The Communist Chinese Party 
and its allies have been working for 
years to find ways to access American 
networks and enter our markets. Our 
national security agencies agree that 
Huawei and other untrusted vendors 
pose an unacceptable risk to our na-
tional security. Today, we are sending 
another strong signal that America 
will hold China accountable. 
Last Congress, we passed the Secure 
and Trusted Communications Act into 
law, which took a great first step to se-
cure our networks by prohibiting Fed-
eral funds to be used to purchase 
untrusted equipment and services, still 
allowing untrusted vendors to enter 
our market if purchased by private dol-
lars. 
H.R. 3919 would strengthen our na-
tional security and close this loophole 
by prohibiting the FCC from licensing 
any communication equipment by an 
entity on the Commission’s covered 
list, regardless of whether it was 
bought using public dollars. 
It is critical that we work to stay one 
step ahead of our adversaries, and this 
bill would advance our security as 5G is 
deployed across the country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from

Indiana (Mr. PENCE), my friend and 
also a member of the committee. 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
staunch support of the bipartisan Se-
cure Equipment Act of 2021. 
Hoosiers back home in my home 
State 
of 
Indiana 
rely 
heavily 
on 
telecom companies to connect them 
with the critical services they need, 
particularly healthcare through tele-
health. When foreign adversaries, like 
Communist China, try to prey upon 
these companies, they are in turn at-
tempting to prey upon hardworking 
Americans like my constituents. That 
is why I am proud today to join my col-
leagues in supporting this vital legisla-
tion that would ensure the Federal 
Government prevents any further Chi-
nese 
state-backed 
equipment 
from 
being used here in the United States. 
This bill is vital to our national secu-
rity, and I urge my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, does 
the whip have any additional speakers? 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, the 
gentleman does not, and I am prepared 
to close. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I would just again 
join, along with my colleague, ANNA 
ESHOO from California, in urging all 
Members of the House to pass the Se-
cure Equipment Act and protect the 
privacy of data from Americans as well 
as that sensitive information that 
flows across networks that is also held 
by the government. 
Let’s delist and not certify compa-
nies that have already been deemed by 
the 
FCC 
to 
be 
national 
security 
threats. I urge all of my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
would urge, again, bipartisan support. 
This is an important next step in our 
effort to try to secure our equipment 
and prevent foreign actors, such as the 
Chinese, from interfering with our na-
tional security, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 3919, the Secure 
Equipment Act of 2021, as amended. 
For over a decade, I have raised concerns 
about how the vulnerabilities in our tele-
communications infrastructure directly impact 
our national security. On November 2, 2010, I 
wrote to the Chairman of the Federal Commu-
nications Commission (FCC) expressing grave 
concerns about Huawei and ZTE, which have 
opaque relationships with the Chinese govern-
ment. 
Sadly, in the intervening eleven years, tele-
communications companies have invested 
hundreds of millions of dollars in equipment 
made by Huawei and ZTE because the equip-
ment is the cheapest available. 
On March 12, 2020, Congress passed and 
the President signed into law the Secure and 
Trusted Communications Networks Act of 
2019 (STCNA), which directed the FCC to: (i) 
establish a list of companies deemed to be a 
national security threat; (ii) prohibit the use of 
federal funds for purchasing equipment made 
by those companies; and (iii) authorize funding 
for U.S. carriers to rip and replace equipment 
made by those companies. The FCC’s list in-
cludes Huawei, ZTE, and other companies 
linked to the Chinese government. 
STCNA was a significant step forward for 
our national security. However, U.S. compa-
nies can still privately purchase equipment 
from these companies. This allows potentially 
vulnerable equipment into our wireless sys-
tems which is a threat to our national security 
because compromised equipment can include 
hard-to-detect surveillance capabilities. 
On June 15, 2021, Representative STEVE 
SCALISE and I introduced H.R. 3919 to prohibit 
the FCC from approving any telecommuni-
cations 
equipment 
made 
by 
companies 
deemed to be a national security threat. Sen-
ators MARCO RUBIO and ED MARKEY have 
companion legislation in the Senate. The leg-
islation is supported by the FCC’s Democratic 
Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel and 
Republican Commissioner Brendan Carr. 
The bill was considered and favorably ad-
vanced by voice vote, first by the House Sub-
committee on Communications and Tech-
nology and then by the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce. The companion bill was favor-
ably advanced by the Senate Committee on 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 
As I stated when STCNA was being consid-
ered by our chamber, no one bill can fully pro-
tect our telecommunications networks. The 
threats we face are constantly evolving, and 
Congress must remain diligent in ensuring our 
communications are secure, private, and reli-
able. 
H.R. 3919 is a highly important and nec-
essary complement to STCNA and I urge my 
colleagues to vote for it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3919, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

OPEN RAN OUTREACH ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 4032) to provide outreach and 
technical assistance to small providers 
regarding the benefits of Open RAN 
networks, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4032 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4032. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-

Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4032, the Open RAN Out-
reach Act. 
Open RAN, or Open Radio Access 
Network, technology is an emerging 
wireless network architecture that has 
the potential to drive 5G innovation 
forward. But like any new technology, 
we still have much to learn about the 
possibilities, complexities, and chal-
lenges of Open RAN. This is especially 
true for smaller communications pro-
viders. 
This bill steps up to the challenge by 
providing small communications pro-
viders with the support they need to

determine whether Open RAN is an ap-
propriate network solution for them. 
Under the bill, the Assistant Secretary 
of the National Telecommunications 
and Information Administration, or 
NTIA, will be required to engage in 
outreach and provide technical assist-
ance to small communications pro-
viders concerning the uses, benefits, 
and challenges of Open RAN and other 
open network architectures. 
NTIA will also inquire about the pro-
viders’ participation in the Wireless 
Supply Chain Innovation Grant Pro-
gram, which was established in the fis-
cal year 2021 National Defense Author-
ization Act. 
Madam Speaker, I commend Rep-
resentatives 
ALLRED, 
O’HALLERAN, 
GUTHRIE, and HUDSON for their bipar-
tisan work on this bill. This is a good 
bill, as it ensures that our country’s 
small communications providers have 
the necessary help to make informed 
decisions about the need for new tech-
nology in their wireless networks. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill in a bipar-
tisan manner, and I look forward to its 
consideration in the Senate. I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1700 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, again, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 4032, the Open RAN 
Outreach Act, which was introduced by 
Representatives 
ALLRED, 
GUTHRIE, 
O’HALLERAN, and HUDSON. 
Open RAN compatible technology 
will play an important role as commu-
nications networks evolve over the 
coming decade. While most networks 
today are limited to integrated sys-
tems provided by one or two vendors, 
the deployment of Open RAN compat-
ible technology will encourage innova-
tion, competition, and new entrants in 
the communications marketplace. 
By encouraging a robust market for 
Open RAN compatible technology, the 
cost of trusted equipment is expected 
to decrease over time. These lower 
costs will help smaller wireless pro-
viders deploy mobile broadband cost ef-
fectively without having to turn to 
untrusted vendors like Huawei. 
As small, and often rural, providers 
upgrade to 5G and replace untrusted 
Huawei or ZTE equipment, we must 
keep in mind the difficulty these pro-
viders may have in taking advantage of 
some of the programs offered in Wash-
ington. 
H.R. 4032 would require NTIA to con-
duct outreach and technical assistance 
to these small and rural providers to 
make sure they have the information 
necessary if they choose to take advan-
tage of Open RAN compatible tech-
nologies. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
ALLRED). 
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, our 
Nation’s future depends on protecting 
our wireless networks from vulnerabili-
ties and untrusted vendors like Chi-
nese-backed companies. That is why 
today I rise in support of my bipartisan 
bill, the Open RAN Outreach Act. 
This bill encourages the administra-
tion to provide outreach and technical 
assistance to small communications 
network providers regarding how to 
use Open Radio Access Networks, or 
Open 
RAN 
technologies, 
including 
those produced in my district in north 
Texas. 
Many carriers use a closed or propri-
etary network, meaning that they need 
to use one vendor or manufacturer. 
This can place a substantial cost bur-
den on smaller carriers to reduce costs, 
potentially by using cheaper, Chinese- 
owned alternatives like Huawei. 
Open RAN allows different compo-
nents to be produced by different com-
panies, leading to a more diverse and 
competitive supply chain. My legisla-
tion ensures smaller carriers have the 
tools they need to deploy Open RAN if 
desired, helping secure our wireless 
networks. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ in support of this 
bill. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. GUTHRIE). 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 4032, the Open 
RAN Outreach Act. 
Untrusted telecommunication com-
panies, such as Chinese Communist 
Party-backed Huawei, are able to offer 
low-cost equipment to small and rural 
providers across the globe due to the 
Chinese Government subsidizing them. 
Due 
to 
congressional 
action, 
untrusted vendors can no longer pro-
vide telecommunications equipment in 
the U.S., and bills I have supported, 
such as Secure and Trusted Commu-
nications Networks Act and USA Tele-
communications 
Act, 
help 
remove 
untrusted equipment to secure our net-
works and promote competition. 
The Open RAN Outreach Act further 
builds on our efforts to strengthen our 
supply chain and ensure untrusted 
equipment is kept out of American 
telecommunications networks. 
Open RAN technology can help diver-
sify 
telecommunications 
technology 
and help increase competition. This 
technology is an open network infra-
structure that can have multiple com-
ponents from multiple manufacturers. 
The Open RAN Outreach Act requires 
the National Telecommunications and 
Information Administration to provide 
small and rural providers information 
on the opportunities and challenges of 
implementing Open RAN compatible 
technology. 
If providers would like to use this 
technology, this bill also requires 
NTIA to support implementation of 
Open RAN technologies. Promoting a 
more competitive market of trusted al-
ternative vendors to provide 5G equip-
ment remains an important component 
in the strategy to protect U.S. net-
works. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Representatives ALLRED, HUDSON, and 
O’HALLERAN for working with me on 
this legislation, and I encourage my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I yield my-
self the balance of my time to close. 
Madam Speaker, I know we had the 
hearing on Open RAN in committee, 
and I heard the testimony that day, 
and how we can expand our networks 
across the country is absolutely essen-
tial. As we know, as we go into the dif-
ferent types of technologies, we are 
going to need as much as we possibly 
can, and so this bill is going to help. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
sponsors for bringing it before us 
today. I urge support of the legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, I would ask that Members sup-

munications providers, and I yield back

will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4067. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4067, the Communications 
Security, Reliability, and Interoper-
ability Council Act. 
As we have seen throughout the 
COVID–19 pandemic, our Nation’s com-
munications networks play an impor-
tant role in our daily lives. Indeed, 
these networks have helped us remain 
connected when we were not able to see 
family and friends in person. It is vital 
that we continue to do all we can to 
protect this critical infrastructure and 
ensure it is reliable and available to all 
Americans. 
The Federal Communications Com-
mission’s Communications Security, 
Reliability, and Interoperability Coun-
cil, or CSRIC, is meant to do just that. 
It is made up of government leaders at 
the Federal, State, and local levels, 
and includes thought leaders from in-
dustry and public interest organiza-
tions. The council provides the FCC 
with recommendations on the best 
practices and actions the agency could 
take so that our communications net-
works are secure, reliable, and compat-
ible with each other. 
CSRIC has been in existence since 
2009 and was recently rechartered by 
acting FCC Chairwoman Rosenworcel 
for another 5 years. 
CSRIC has served the FCC well by op-
erating in a collaborative manner with 
representatives from private industry, 
government, and other key stake-
holders. This year the council will be 
cochaired by the Cybersecurity and In-
frastructure Security Agency and will 
include even greater participation from 
the public interest community. 
But given the important objectives of 
CSRIC, we should not leave it to the 
FCC’s discretion on whether to rechar-
ter this council or not every 2 years. 
Instead, CSRIC must become a perma-
nent fixture at the FCC. 
H.R. 4067 requires the Federal Com-
munications Commission to do just 
that. Under this bill, the FCC would be 
required to establish a permanent 
council to advise the agency on the se-
curity, reliability, and interoperability 
of communications networks within 90 
days. This council would include rep-
resentatives from trusted communica-
tions companies, public interest orga-
nizations, academic institutions, as 
well as Federal, State, local, and Trib-
al governments for a term of 2 years. 
This bill also requires the council 
and its working groups to submit re-
ports offering their recommendations 
to the chair of the FCC every 2 years. 
In turn, the FCC must make these re-
ports publicly available on its website. 
I want to thank Representatives 
SCHRADER and SLOTKIN for their leader-
ship on this bill, as well as Representa-
tive WALBERG for working with us to 
move this bill through the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. This bill is an 
important step in protecting our com-
munications networks from bad actors 
and foreign adversaries. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, I look 
forward to its consideration by the 
Senate, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4067, the Communications 
Security Advisory Act of 2021, which 
was 
introduced 
by 
Representatives 
WALBERG, SLOTKIN, and SCHRADER. 
This bill takes an important step in 
preserving and strengthening the FCC’s 
existing Communications Security, Re-
liability, and Interoperability Council, 
or CSRIC, which plays an important 
role facilitating collaboration between 
the private sector and the FCC. 
CSRIC maintains an important role 
that ensures our emergency alerting 
system and 911 systems remain reliable 
in times of emergency. CSRIC has also 
adopted voluntary recommendations to 
improve wireless security. These ef-
forts have focused on how best to plan 
for and address vulnerabilities in 5G 
networks. 
Together, 
technical 
experts 
from 
across different parts of the commu-
nications industry leverage their dec-
ades of experience to help advance con-
tinued U.S. technological leadership 
and sound policymaking. CSRIC’s sup-
port of these important FCC missions 
will only become more important as we 
continue to deploy 5G, next-generation 
television, and other wireless tech-
nologies. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Ohio for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 4067, the Com-
munications Security, Reliability, and 
Interoperability Council Act. I would 
like to thank my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives SLOTKIN
and SCHRADER, 
for joining me in leading on this impor-
tant legislation. 
Though we don’t agree on every 
issue, I am proud of our bipartisan 
record when it comes to securing our 
Nation’s 
communications 
networks

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5659 
October 19, 2021 
and maintaining our leadership in 
next-generation wireless technology. 
H.R. 4067 codifies an existing FCC 
council advisory council, the Commu-
nications Security, Reliability, and 
Interoperability Council, better known 
as CSRIC. 
First established in 1992 under its 
previous name as the Network Reli-
ability Council, CSRIC makes key rec-
ommendations to the FCC on a range 
of public safety and national security 
issues—everything 
from 
deploying 
next-generation 911 systems to emer-
gency alerting during storms and disas-
ters, to addressing threats from foreign 
adversaries. 
At a legislative hearing earlier this 
year, we heard from cybersecurity ex-
perts who said that CSRIC is one of the 
‘‘crown jewels’’ of our Government and 
that there would be tremendous, long- 
term value in backing it up statutorily 
while retaining its flexibility to tackle 
the new challenges of the day. 
Another former CSRIC panel member 
spoke to how other countries around 
the world look to this body to imple-
ment best communications and secu-
rity practices. He said—and I agree 
with him—that CSRIC is one of the 
unique platforms which enables the 
U.S. to lead the rest of the world in 5G, 
6G, and beyond. 
As the world becomes increasingly 
digital and our communications sys-
tems advance toward open-source soft-
ware 
platforms, 
cyberattacks 
and 
threats are only going to increase. We 
have to be prepared as a nation to meet 
this moment, and CSRIC helps us do 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4067. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I ask the gen-
tleman from Ohio if he has any addi-
tional speakers. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, that 
was my last speaker. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time to close. 
Madam Speaker, I think what we are 
seeing today, we have a theme, espe-
cially coming from the Energy and 
Commerce Committee’s Communica-
tions and Technology Subcommittee 
that we are talking about security, re-
liability, and interoperability of our 
systems out there and the importance 
of it. 
As we look back over the last year 
and a half, where would we have been if 
we didn’t have the systems that we had 
to make sure as we went through 
COVID for everything from telehealth 
to education to manufacturing to busi-
ness and people just communicating 
back and forth with one another, but 
we have to make sure these systems 
are secure. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation will 
help that. I urge support of the House 
on the legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. 
PALLONE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
again, I ask Members to support this 
bill as another step in helping us with 
our communications security as well as 
reliability. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4067, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, on that I demand the 
yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4028. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4028, the Information and Commu-
nication Technology Strategy Act. 
This bill would help ensure the 
United States remains a global eco-
nomic power by providing Congress 
with valuable insights on the informa-
tion and communication technology 
supply chain and a strategic roadmap 
for the entire Federal Government to 
strengthen 
the 
competitiveness 
of 
trusted information and communica-
tion technology vendors. 
The bill accomplishes these impor-
tant objectives by requiring the Sec-
retary of Commerce to report to Con-
gress on the technology most critical 
to ensuring the continued economic 
success of the United States. It is also 
supposed to examine the ability and ca-
pacity of American manufacturers and 
other trusted vendors to produce this 
technology. 
The report will be completed through 
the 
Department’s 
National 
Tele-
communications and Information Ad-
ministration. It will also identify how 
many of our country’s communications 
providers depend upon untrusted ven-
dors of this technology, and then it 
will outline actions the Federal Gov-
ernment can take to increase the sup-
port of trusted vendors and eliminate 
the support of untrusted vendors. 
Finally, the legislation calls for the 
Secretary of Commerce to develop a 
whole-of-government strategy, along 
with recommendations based on the re-
port. The strategy is meant to enhance 
the economic growth of trusted infor-
mation and communication technology 
vendors, both in the United States and 
abroad. 
Madam Speaker, the bill requires 
that the Secretary of Commerce con-
sult with a wide variety of trusted in-
formation and communication tech-
nology vendors. It also requires the 
Secretary to consult with the heads of 
several government agencies, including 
the Secretary of State, the Secretary 
of Homeland Security, the Attorney 
General, the Director of National Intel-
ligence, and the Chair of the FCC. 
By enhancing the global supply chain 
for trusted information and commu-
nication technology vendors, this bill 
would help strengthen the American 
economy and protect our country from 
nontrusted parties seeking to disrupt 
America’s competitiveness in the infor-
mation and communication technology 
industry. 
Madam Speaker, I want to commend 
Representatives SPANBERGER, MCNER-
NEY, LONG, and CARTER for their bipar-
tisan efforts on this legislation. I hope 
we can come together to move the bill 
forward. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4028, the Information and 
Communication Technology Strategy 
Act, which was introduced by Rep-
resentatives 
LONG, 
CARTER, 
SPANBERGER, and MCNERNEY. 
For decades, U.S. companies and 
their trusted partners have been at the 
forefront of wireless technology inno-
vation. We led the world in developing 
4G, and we are now in the process of de-
ploying and refining 5G technology. 
While this work continues, we must en-
sure supply chain security is at the 
forefront. 
China and other adversaries have 
made a concerted effort to dominate 
critical components of the communica-
tion supply chain. We have already 
seen how bad actors like China are try-
ing to seed their equipment across the 
globe, create technological depend-
encies, and steal sensitive data to ad-
vance their own interests. 
This bill, H.R. 4028, would direct the 
National Telecommunications and In-
formation Administration, NTIA, to 
study the economic competitiveness of 
trusted information and communica-
tions technology vendors. NTIA would 
be charged with leading a whole-of-gov-
ernment strategy to ensure the eco-
nomic competitiveness of trusted ven-
dors and prevent us from being depend-
ent on companies controlled by the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
Only with a comprehensive under-
standing of the problems we face, along 
with the strategy to address these 
problems, will we be able to secure our 
networks and ensure continued U.S. 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. LONG), the sponsor of this 
legislation. 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 4028, 
the Information and Communication 
Technology Strategy Act. 
Currently, far too many U.S.-based 
information and communications ven-
dors rely on technology from foreign 
sources. The Information and Commu-
nication Technology Strategy Act will 
require the Department of Commerce 
to assess the dependence of informa-
tion and communications vendors on 
foreign 
technologies 
and 
create 
a 
whole-of-government strategy that will 
bolster the economic competitiveness 
of U.S. information and communica-
tions vendors and reduce their reliance 
on foreign resources. 
With all the supply chain disruptions 
we have seen this past year, it is im-
portant to know how our domestic pro-
duction of this crucial equipment can 
be strengthened in the future. 
If passed, this piece of legislation 
brings us one step closer to making 
sure our Nation’s information tech-
nology supply chains are secure and 
free from dependence on foreign coun-
tries, such as China. 
We need to continue to work in a bi-
partisan manner to ensure that the 
whole-of-government strategy that is 
created through this legislation is 
properly implemented. I look forward 
to working with my colleagues in the 
Senate to ensure this legislation be-
comes law. 
I thank all of my friends across the 
aisle for helping us get to this point, 
and I look forward to getting this bill 
across the finish line. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 4028. This is leg-
islation that I was proud to originally 
cosponsor with my good friend, the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. LONG). 
Madam Speaker, my colleagues on 
this side of the aisle are leading to se-
cure our communications technology 
and supply chains with proposals like 
this, which would create a whole-of- 
government strategy. We need to make 
sure information technology supply 
chains are secure, and we need to know 
how dependent U.S. information and 
communications technology companies 
are on foreign countries like China. 
To accomplish this goal, we must se-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5661 
October 19, 2021 
We know that investment in innova-
tion and preparation for the security 
challenges of tomorrow’s technologies 
are critical. Our Nation has, unfortu-
nately, seen firsthand the disruption 
caused by attacks on American supply 
chains, critical infrastructure, and gov-
ernment computer systems in recent 
years. 
That is why H.R. 4028 is so impor-
tant. This legislation would direct the 
National Telecommunications and In-
formation Administration to not just 
conduct a study but would require it to 
come up with a real solution to secur-
ing this critical supply chain. 
This legislation would not only iden-
tify the risk but also develop a strat-
egy to secure supply chains for infor-
mation 
and 
communications 
tech-
nology. We must take our communica-
tions and technology supply chain seri-
ously, and this legislation would do 
just that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge swift passage 
of H.R. 4028. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask if the gentleman is prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. 
As we have heard from our speakers 
today, it is absolutely essential that 
the United States leads when we are 
talking about telecommunication serv-
ices and the supply chain because it is 
absolutely essential for national secu-
rity. 
I urge passage of the legislation in 
the House, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
PALLONE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
again, this is part of our effort to en-
hance economic growth with regard to 
trusted communications vendors both 
here and abroad. I urge my colleagues 
to support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4028, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, on that I demand the 
yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until ap-
proximately 6:30 p.m. today. 
Accordingly (at 5 o’clock and 26 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b 1830 
AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker pro 
tempore (Mr. PERLMUTTER) at 6 o’clock 
and 30 minutes p.m. 
f 
FREE VETERANS FROM FEES ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-
ished business is the vote on the mo-
tion to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 1029) to Waive the application 
fee for any special use permit for vet-
erans’ special events at war memorials 
on land administered by the National 
Park Service in the District of Colum-
bia and its environs, and for other pur-
poses, on which the yeas and nays were 
ordered. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

FORMER 
CONGRESSMAN 
DALE 
KILDEE 
(Mr. KILDEE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, last 
week I lost my uncle, and the people of 
my State and this country lost a lead-
er, former Congressman Dale Kildee. 
Our hearts go out to my Aunt Gayle, 
and to my cousins David, Paul, and 
Laura, who are experiencing the kind 
of loss that I and so many of us know 
far too well. 
He served here for 36 years, and he 
believed that this place, this Congress, 
and our government could be a force 
for good. 
During that time, he had many, 
many 
legislative 
accomplishments 
around education, the environment, 
things that he cared deeply about, but 
I think perhaps his greatest contribu-
tion was the fact that he served here so 
long and left with so many friends be-
cause he served here with dignity, with 
kindness to everyone, with respect for 
everyone regardless of their position or 
their point of view. 
I hope we can remember him for that, 
and I hope we all take note of that. It 
is an important message, especially 
now. 
He believed that the role of govern-
ment was to preserve, to protect, to de-
fend, and to enhance human dignity. 
His life was a testament to that prom-
ise. 
I would ask all present to join us in 
a moment of silence for my Uncle Dale.

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
FORMER CONGRESSMAN DANIEL 
BENISHEK 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Dr. Daniel Joseph Benishek, or as he 
was better known to those of us in 
Michigan, Dr. Dan. 
On Saturday, October 15, after a life-
time of service to the First District 
and the State of Michigan, Dr. Dan 
passed away.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5664 
October 19, 2021 
Through his dedication to his pa-
tients 
and 
constituents, 
Dr. 
Dan 
changed 
the 
lives 
of 
countless 
Michiganders and was an indispensable 
part of our entire community. 
From his decades of service as a doc-
tor, to his 6 years fighting for the First 
District in Congress, he embodied serv-
ant leadership and was an ally to all 
our veterans and all who were blessed 
to call Michigan’s First District home. 
Dr. Dan’s passing is a significant loss 
to our State. Those of us who call 
Michigan home have each benefited 
from his life and service and are grate-
ful for the impacts he made. He did 
make a difference. 
He loved the outdoors like no one 
you would believe, and he loved to tell 
the stories of how his cabin was com-
pletely off the grid and that he ate 
what he caught or hunted. He was a 
man truly of the Upper Peninsula. 
We all send our deepest condolences 
to his dear wife, Judy, and the entire 
Benishek family and all of Team 
Benishek. 
Please join me in a moment of si-
lence to honor the memory of Con-
gressman Dr. Dan Benishek.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H. CON. RES. 33 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
hereby remove my name as cosponsor 
of H. Con. Res. 33. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. JA-
COBS of California). The gentleman’s 
request is accepted. 
f 
WE MUST PROTECT THE RIGHT TO 
VOTE 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, our sa-
cred right to vote is in jeopardy. Led 
by the divisive voice of a twice-im-
peached, failed, former President, 17 
States across this Nation have enacted 
28 laws to make it harder for Ameri-
cans to vote. 
Tomorrow, the Senate has the oppor-
tunity to pass the Freedom to Vote 
Act. The pandemic has shown us we 
can adapt and modernize our elections 
to reflect the 21st century and our elec-
torate through same-day registration, 
making election day a national holi-
day, transparency on dark money, and 
more. 
Legislators must be the voice of the 
people and give voice to the people, and 
our voices are strongest at the ballot 
box. That is why we must do all we can 
to ensure equal access for all Ameri-
cans. 
I urge the Senators to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
the Freedom to Vote Act. Our Republic 
can’t afford anything less. 
We are voted for by the people and 
for the people, and we must protect the 
right to vote for the people. 
JACOB DAVIS, JR., TURNS 100 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Jacob Davis, Jr., of Pierce County, 
Georgia, for his 100th birthday on Octo-
ber 6. 
A lifelong resident of Georgia’s First 
Congressional District, Jacob has de-
voted his life to his community and his 
country. 
He was drafted into the United 
States Navy in 1943 and was stationed 
in Great Lakes, Illinois. He served as a 
fireman on an aircraft carrier that per-
formed test flights for the military. 
After being discharged from the mili-
tary in December 1945, Jacob returned 
to his family farm and married the love 
of his life, Jenny Henderson. 
Over Jacob’s lifetime of farming, he 
has accumulated over 1,000 acres of 
farmland. To this day, he continues his 
work on his pecan orchard. If the Sun 
is shining, Jacob can be found outside 
working. 
Although he has worked hard his en-
tire life, Jacob was, and continues to 
be, a devoted and loving father, grand-
father, and great-grandfather. 
I am proud to rise today to recognize 
Jacob’s birthday and his lifetime of 
service and leadership to Georgia’s 
First Congressional District.

HONORING 
TARRANT 
COUNTY 
SHERIFF BILL WAYBOURN AND 
HIS DEPUTIES 
(Ms. VAN DUYNE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Tarrant County 
Sheriff Bill Waybourn and his deputies. 
Earlier this month, Sheriff Waybourn 
announced the weeks-long investiga-
tion known as Operation Buyer Be-
ware, which focused on the demand 
driving human trafficking. 
Together, Texas DPS, Fort Worth 
Police, Arlington Police and the De-
partment of Homeland Security suc-
cessfully arrested a total of 115 men 
over the course of 1 week, many of 
them repeat offenders. Those arrested 
were attempting to solicit sex from mi-
nors. 
With this operation, the Tarrant 
County Sheriff has sent a clear signal 
to offenders in the community that the 
safety and well-being of our children is 
paramount, and acts of harm and vio-
lence will not be tolerated. The sher-
iff’s department stepped up to make 
use of the recent changes to State law 
that will increase jail time for solicita-
tion. 
We applaud our law enforcement and 
those dedicated to keeping Texas-24 
safe. Madam Speaker, I thank Sheriff 
Bill Waybourn and Tarrant County law 
enforcement for executing this oper-
ation and making strides to protect 
our community.

CALLING 
ATTENTION 
TO 
THE 
NEEDS OF THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
this evening to call attention to the 
needs of our Great Lakes region, in-
cluding communities I represent like 
Lorain, Ohio, which my colleagues on 
the Select Committee on Economic 
Disparity and Fairness in Growth vis-
ited yesterday afternoon on a bipar-
tisan basis. 
During the hearing, we heard from 
union members, the business commu-
nity, community leaders, and local of-
ficials about how decades of under-
investment and outsourcing have dev-
astated our region; 10,000 steel jobs 
gone just in that industry. 
As we advance our Build Back Better 
agenda, it is vital we deliver robust re-
sources and support to these commu-
nities, ones that too often have been 
left behind. 
These historic investments in infra-
structure and good-paying jobs must 
reach every corner of our Nation, espe-
cially those where middle-class work-
ers and their families have been denied 
full participation in the American 
Dream. 
Let’s make sure that these commu-
nities and those in the Great Lakes re-
ceive their fair share and are set upon 
a path for a more prosperous tomor-
row.

RECOGNIZING STAFF SERGEANT 
PAUL LINCOLN OLMSTEAD 
(Mr. MOORE of Utah asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of 
Staff Sergeant Paul Lincoln Olmstead, 
who passed away on September 21, 2021. 
Born with an instinct to protect and 
defend others, Lincoln embodied the 
Green Beret motto to ‘‘de oppresso 
liber’’ or ‘‘to free the oppressed.’’ 
Lincoln served as a special forces en-
gineer in the Utah National Guard’s 
19th Special Forces Group. This elite 
group of operators serves as the tip of 
the spear of the greatest fighting force 
the world has ever known. 
Just 5 years into his service, Ser-
geant Olmstead had become a Green 
Beret and a special forces sniper. 
Lincoln will always be known as a 
disciplined professional with a stead-
fast commitment to the mission at 
hand. Lincoln proudly served his coun-
try, and we owe him our deepest grati-
tude. Lincoln will be remembered as a 
loving husband to his wife, Danaya, 
and a dedicated father to his son, 
Tavian, and daughter, Alexa.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5665 
October 19, 2021 
IN OPPOSITION TO DEMOCRATS’ 
RECONCILIATION PACKAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. HERN) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and submit 
extraneous material. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, tonight 
we are going to hear the truth about a 
truly bad bill. 
Biden’s failed leadership has created 
an 
America 
where 
grocery 
stores’ 
shelves are empty, gas stations are 
running out of gas, and crime is sky-
rocketing, our schools are failing, and 
our borders are wide open so that car-
tels can have complete control of what 
is going on at our southern border. 
This isn’t the America any of us 
want. Whether we succeed or fail, we 
do it as one. Republican or Democrat, 
our future is the same. That is why it 
is so important to point out the truth 
of what is in this reconciliation pack-
age. 
The Biden administration has ig-
nored crisis after crisis, putting all 
their eggs into this build back broke 
basket. So how come no one actually 
knows what is in it? 
We spent over 40 hours in Ways and 
Means marking up the build back 
broke plan last month and several 
other committees did the same, but we 
already know that the policies have 
changed since then. 
Democrats are adding radical unnec-
essary provisions while the American 
people aren’t looking. For example, 
they are trying to make the IRS spy on 
American 
families’ 
bank 
accounts. 
That is right, they want banks to give 
information to the IRS on any trans-
action over $600. This is a giant step to-
wards living in a surveillance state. 
My constituents are horrified at 
what has happened to our country in 
just 9 months of Democratic control. 
They are worried that the freedoms we 
have held dear for the last 245 years 
will be stripped away right before their 
eyes. 
Tonight, we will hear from my col-
leagues about the dangerous provisions 
included in the build back broke plan, 
the honest truth about what our Demo-
cratic colleagues are trying to hide 
from the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER), my dear friend, a fresh-
man, a fellow businessperson, and a 
person that I coauthored an op-ed with 
yesterday about our failing supply 
chain. 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to condemn the 
reckless and irresponsible proposed 
spending by the radical left. 
This reconciliation bill is nothing 
more than a socialist wish list. 
It disincentivizes people from work-
ing and it is littered with Green New 
Deal items we cannot afford. 
The Biden administration has out-
rageously claimed this bill costs zero, 
nada, nothing, zilch. If you believe 
that, then I have got a nice piece of 
oceanfront property to sell you in east 
Tennessee where I come from. 
This deficit spending is a wrong pre-
scription for our country. 
Instead of calling this the build back 
better, they should call it the build 
back broke. 
It would raise inflation—you have to 
remember, inflation is taxation—mak-
ing everyday necessities even more ex-
pensive than they have already become 
under the Biden economy; that is, if 
you can even get the items you need 
due to the supply chain disruptions. 
And it will fail to incentivize Ameri-
cans to get back to work. 
What we need to focus on are real so-
lutions to restarting our great Amer-
ican economy, not on increasing debt 
and government reliance. 
I urge my colleagues in joining me in 
opposing this out-of-control spending. 
Our country’s future depends on it 
and the future of east Tennessee de-
pends on it. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. JOYCE), my dear friend and a 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee and a fellow classmate. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Oklahoma for hosting this Special 
Order this evening. 
The reconciliation package that my 
colleagues are pushing for may play 
well to focus groups in liberal cities, 
but in Pennsylvania, the energy poli-
cies being introduced in this legisla-
tion would be a death sentence for 
thousands of family-sustaining jobs. 
It is clear that this administration is 
openly hostile to the energy industries 
that are critical in our State and that 
provide the baseload power that our 
Nation relies on. 
At a time when gas prices just 
reached a 7-year high, this legislation 
would create new taxes on the oil and 
natural gas industries. 
These regressive taxes would directly 
harm our middle-class citizens. They 
would harm the rural Americans who 
have to drive further distances and 
take longer commutes in order to get 
to work. 
This administration claims these 
taxes would pay to support working 
families. That is false. 
In reality, these taxes would pay to 
enact radical policies like creating 
green workforce tax credits that cost 
over $10 billion. 
These taxes would pay to give kick-
backs to liberal companies that pro-
mote the false solutions offered by the 
Green New Deal energy agenda. 
Let’s be clear: These taxes do not 
benefit the American people. This ad-
ministration is willing to raise taxes 
on working Americans for the sake of 
their socialist energy policies. 
This is not responsible government. 
It is not a government that is working 
to improve the quality of life for all 
citizens. 
It is disappointing to see the admin-
istration lying about what this legisla-
tion does. 
This bill would bankrupt our energy 
producers and send prices soaring even 
higher. 
This legislation would not help to 
build our economy, it would not help to 
build our workforce, and it would not 
protect the American energy con-
sumers. 
The truth is simple: We cannot afford 
this legislation. We must vote against 
it. 
I thank the gentleman from Okla-
homa for organizing this Special Order. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
DONALDS), a freshman, who is certainly 
not shy about getting out there and 
getting his feet wet and speaking out 
here, so we appreciate that. 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, it is important that 
we are here this evening because the 
President of the United States and the 
majority party has never actually 
talked about what is in this bill. They 
would like to throw out their catch 
phrase build back better, they like to 
talk about how they are helping the 
children and helping our economy 
transform, but what they never talk 
about is what they are actually going 
to do. 
What the American people don’t 
know, Madam Speaker, is that in this 
bill is a $1.3 billion provision to give 
newspapers $12,500 per employee for 
local newspapers all across the United 
States. I don’t know about you, but I 
don’t know how that helps anybody 
build back better when we are giving 
tax dollars to newspapers. 
In this bill, it gives $42 billion in tax 
credits to the rich to buy electric cars. 
The reason why they are tax credits for 
the rich is because working families, 
middle-class families don’t have the 
disposable income to buy electric cars; 
only the wealthy buy them. But that is 
in this bill. 
The administration wants to give the 
IRS access to your checking accounts. 
This is outrageous. This completely 
eliminates due process. It makes every 
American guilty until proven innocent. 
And the White House wants this provi-
sion in the bill because they can’t tax 
the American people enough to pay for 
all their radical spending, so they have 
to go find every piece of change in the 
couch cushions. 
The only time in American history 
we unleashed the IRS on checking ac-
counts and on bank accounts was when

we allowed for currency transaction re-
ports to track drug cartels and busi-
nesses breaking the law from laun-
dering money in the United States be-
cause of drugs and terrorism. That is 
when we unleashed currency trans-
action reports on transactions in the 
United States. It has never been done 
in any other time, but Joe Biden wants 
to do it to every American. And make 
no mistake, America, it is to every 
American. 
In this bill it raises taxes radically in 
our corporate sector, makes us the 
highest corporate tax income country 
in the world, higher than China. You 
know, China, the country that is our 
economic rival. And it raises those 
taxes. It makes us less competitive. 
But that is supposed to help us build 
back better? 
And let’s talk about spending be-
cause in this very bill, one of the key 
proponents that Joe Biden and the 
Democrats want is to expand and con-
tinue the child tax credit, which pays 
$300 per child. But what they will never 
tell you is there is no provision in the 
bill to actually track based upon So-
cial Security numbers to make sure 
that even if you are going to give a 
benefit—which, by the way, we should 
not give—that anybody in the United 
States can get it. And I stress anybody 
in the United States because by the 
end of this year there will be easily 2.3 
to 2.5 million people who have crossed 
our borders illegally. 
This bill is a catastrophe. This bill 
spends far more money than we pos-
sibly have. It will create more—and I 
stress ‘‘more’’—inflation in our soci-
ety, which is already crippling poor 
people. It is already crippling working 
families. It is not going to help our 
country. 
You know, back in February when we 
told the administration do not extend 
Federal unemployment benefits be-
cause it was going to pay people to 
stay home, Joe Biden said, no, it won’t, 
everything is going to be A-okay. 
Well, look at our economy today. Ev-
erything is not okay. Everything is 
screwed. And if we listen to Joe Biden, 
somebody, frankly, who has never been 
right, somebody who has never had a 
job one day in his life about what it is 
going to take to actually allow our 
economy to thrive and prosper, our 
country is going to see its last great 
days. 
Madam Speaker, the reason why you 
guys can’t get the votes is because 
even Democrats in your own party re-
alize how destructive this will be to the 
small business owners in their dis-
tricts, how destructive this will be to 
the economic vitality of the people in 
their districts. You can’t get the votes. 
It is time to stand down. This bill is a 
disaster. 
b 2000 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON), 
my dear friend from the food, fuel, and 
fiber district of West Texas, Texas’ 19th 
District. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Oklahoma 
for yielding, and he almost got there— 
the food, fuel, and fiber capital of the 
world in West Texas. But we are proud 
to be partners with our friends in Okla-
homa who produce a little oil and gas 
and a little food and fiber themselves. 
But the gentleman from Florida is 
exactly right. I don’t think that there 
is enough Democrats to support this 
gargantuan tax-and-spend bill on the 
American people because it would be 
their political death warrant, quite 
frankly. Because they represent people, 
working families, who will no doubt 
feel the burden. Even the most liberal 
tax policy experts say that the cor-
porate taxes, in large part, will be 
borne by working families with lower 
wages and higher cost of goods and 
lower benefits. 
That is what taxing American job 
creators will do, as well as run those 
jobs right back to overseas where we 
brought millions back when we cut 
taxes. We will ruin America’s competi-
tive position, and we will no doubt be 
in a far worst situation than we are 
today, with runaway inflation, with 
labor locked out by foolish policies to 
pay people more to be on unemploy-
ment than to be at work. 
This is the largest tax bill, the larg-
est spending bill, the largest expansion 
of government, the largest redistribu-
tion of wealth in the history of the 
United States of America—in the his-
tory. 
And part of this bill—and it is hard 
to know where to end and begin be-
cause the Democrats have had sort of a 
shock and awe strategy where it is 
hard to unpack all of the disastrous 
provisions—but they expand the wel-
fare system in this country and trap 
millions more people on government 
dependency. And they will trap genera-
tions in a cycle of poverty because of 
new cash entitlements without any re-
gard for personal responsibility or 
work requirements. 
The refundable child tax credit is ex-
hibit A. It is half a trillion dollars in 
its current temporary form. But I guar-
antee you, if it goes into place, in any 
form, it will be made permanent. It is 
over a trillion dollars, and people will 
be paid cash per child with no regard 
for their ability to work, their respon-
sibility to look for a job. Work-capable 
people with no responsibility. 
This will also enact the green new 
economic disaster. This is a climate 
alarmist utopian fantasy that will 
break the bank of our American cof-
fers. It will ruin our economic pros-
pects of recovery. It will certainly un-
dermine, if not flat out destroy, Amer-
ica’s energy independence and give the 
keys to China in terms of the future 
global economic leadership. 
But what is not discussed enough, be-
cause Democrats claim in their rhet-
oric that this is a tax on the rich; this 
is a tax on corporations. Well, first of 
all, the facts are, out of the 1.7 organi-
zations, job creators organized as C- 
Corps, $1.4 million are small busi-
nesses. Small businesses in their pro-
posal would be death by a thousand tax 
increases and mandates and regula-
tions; marginal tax increases; a cut in 
the small business deduction; you have 
Obama surtaxes. 
Madam Speaker, in 41 States, small 
businesses under this proposal will pay 
more than 50 percent of their income to 
the government. On top of that, they 
have expanded powers for regulators 
like OSHA to increase their penalties 
upwards of 500 percent, increase their 
Fair Labor Standards Act penalties by 
900 percent, empower regulators to fine 
small businesses upwards of $700,000 for 
not enacting, implementing the Biden 
vaccine mandate. 
Madam Speaker, to my friend from 
Oklahoma, this is riddled with horrible 
provisions, and to suggest that small 
businesses get a pass is more than dis-
ingenuous. Again, in addition to the 
tax increases, they have got mandates 
on 
government-approved 
retirement 
plans. They will be forced to unionize 
their workforce; taxpayers will sub-
sidize union dues; unions will be able to 
funnel billions of dollars to Democrat 
organizations. 
So in addition to the progressive 
wish list part 2, after ‘‘COVID relief,’’ 
in addition to amnesty and citizenship 
for people who came into this country 
illegally, they have got a whole list of 
goodies for their union buddies and 
bosses, not the least of which is Ameri-
cans get a higher tax break if they buy 
their electric bicycles and electric ve-
hicles from unionized corporations. 
So this is a parade of horrible poli-
cies. It is an economic disaster. And as 
we unpack it, I hope and pray that the 
American people and our colleagues on 
the Democrat side of the aisle will do 
the right thing for our country and 
keep America in that pole position for 
future prosperity. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from the food, fuel, and 
fiber capital of the world. I appreciate 
it very much. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
BURCHETT), congressman from Ten-
nessee’s Second District, also spent 
time in the Tennessee State House, the 
Tennessee State Senate, and the mayor 
of Knox County, my dear friend who I 
served on the Committee on Small 
Business with, and a fighter for real 
America. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman HERN for that wonder-
ful and accurate introduction, and 
thank him for being my friend. 
Madam Speaker, Joe Biden, NANCY 
PELOSI, and the far-left Democrats are 
playing the American people for fools. 
They are claiming their insane multi- 
trillion dollar agenda will cost nothing. 
Nothing. 
Madam Speaker, our constituents are 
not stupid. They know nothing Wash-
ington puts out is free, and they know

that the doggone Democrats want to 
tax them for this socialist scheme. 
Earlier today, the nonpartisan Con-
gressional 
Budget 
Office 
confirmed 
Democrats are lying about the cost of 
Biden’s agenda. The CBO found that 
the healthcare provisions alone would 
increase the Federal deficit by half a 
trillion dollars. Let me repeat that: 
Half a trillion dollars. 
It doesn’t matter if the healthcare 
spending in this bill occurs over 1 year 
or over 10 years, we never should blow 
up the deficit like this. 
On top of the actual healthcare costs, 
the CBO also revealed the healthcare 
policies would force millions of Ameri-
cans into one-size-fits-all government 
healthcare 
programs. 
Forget 
about 
keeping your employer-sponsored plan 
or personalized care. Under progressive 
care, as we like to call it in my office, 
Americans will get to rely on the slow- 
moving Federal bureaucracy for meet-
ing their healthcare needs. 
Madam Speaker, Democrats have 
fought amongst each other for months 
over this big government boondoggle. 
The American public now knows what 
the Democrat-controlled Congress has 
been up to while our economy has 
tanked. Instead of trying to jam 
through trillions of dollars on the 
backs of American taxpayers, Demo-
crats need to clean up this messy econ-
omy. Crucial shipping ports along our 
coasts don’t have enough staff to main-
tain normal operating hours, creating 
a broken supply chain. 
I saw today where Florida, in fact, is 
in the market for that prestigious mar-
ket. 
Some retail shelves have sat empty 
for weeks. Things have gotten so bad 
there that there is talk that some 
goods will not be available for the holi-
day season. Lacking supplies of certain 
goods have made the inflation crisis 
President Biden started even worse. 
Skyrocketing prices are a direct re-
sult of the blue State stimulus package 
Democrats passed back in March, an-
other bill that cost trillions of dollars. 
Thanks to that legislation, too many 
folks are getting paid more to stay at 
home instead of going to work, which 
is contributing to our current supply 
chain woes. 
Joe Biden, NANCY PELOSI, and this 
Democrat-controlled 
Congress 
are 
guiding our economy straight into the 
ground. Time and time again, Congress 
has proved that throwing money at the 
country’s problems always makes the 
situation worse. It already happened 
once this year. It is time for Congress 
to abandon this big government social-
ism agenda before it is too late to save 
our economy. 
As I said at the beginning, our con-
stituents are not stupid. They know 
they are the ones who always pay, ei-
ther through inflation or taxes. Ameri-
cans will not forget it was Democrats, 
driven by the far-left political agendas 
who destroyed this economy. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Tennessee. I appre-
ciate him so much, as always. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
MEUSER), my dear friend, who spent 2 
years on the Committee on Small Busi-
ness, a fellow colleague from Penn-
sylvania’s Ninth District, a gentleman 
that has been in business his entire 
life; his family has been in business 
their entire lives; have been on the re-
ceiving end of these failed past policies 
when you go after small business, so I 
think he is what I consider to be an ex-
pert in this area to talk to this. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my very good friend, the gen-
tleman, Mr. HERN, of the great State of 
Oklahoma for yielding some time to 
me this evening. 
Madam Speaker, last year, we collec-
tively spent $5.6 trillion of the Amer-
ican taxpayer money for COVID relief 
and recovery and to create a vaccine, 
all the while enormously increasing 
our debt, but we were in a serious pan-
demic, a serious crisis. 
Despite the effectiveness of this re-
lief, the improving GDP and produc-
tivity taking place in our economy, the 
Biden administration and the Demo-
crat Caucus passed the so-called rescue 
bill that was about three times more 
expensive than anyone thought needed. 
This and other erroneous policies set 
the stage for the havoc infecting our 
economy today. 
We have a serious workforce short-
age, hyperinflation—high demand and 
low 
supply—strong 
consumer 
pur-
chasing but no ‘‘Made in the USA’’ 
goods to fulfill that demand. This is 
the primary cause of the supply chain 
bottleneck at our ports. Add to it this 
administration’s not-so-subtle attack 
on domestic energy production, and 
you have shortages and inflation not 
seen since the 1970s. 
Worse, it is not the high-earners or 
the well-off who are suffering from the 
Biden administration’s decisions, it is 
middle income, working families and 
small businesses that are feeling the 
brunt of these ill-conceived ideas. 
Madam Speaker, small businesses in 
Pennsylvania are breathless with anx-
iety and concern. Literally, every day I 
have a phone call with breathless con-
stituents. They are rattled. Every one 
of them has a ‘‘Help Wanted’’ sign 
hanging on their door, offering $20 an 
hour plus while the cost of everything 
goes up daily. 
What is the Biden administration’s 
and the progressives in this House an-
swer? 
Let’s spend $3.5 trillion on programs 
that create more demand but do noth-
ing to increase productivity and the 
supply of American-made goods, and 
then somehow calling it ‘‘Building 
Back Better.’’ 
I would think it would be called 
breaking backs better because that is 
what it is doing—breaking the backs of 
hardworking Americans. 
Madam Speaker, this defines the 
Biden administration and the Demo-
cratic Caucus’ economic strategy: Big 
taxes, big spending, big government. 
My constituents and I call it eco-
nomic madness. We must defeat—not 
reduce, 
but 
defeat—this 
economy- 
wrecking conciliation. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
KELLY), my dear friend, a man that has 
a tremendous passion in this area, 
whose family has spent a lifetime in 
business, a member on the Committee 
on Ways and Means, and a gentleman 
who also played football at Notre 
Dame. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I thank 
the gentleman from Oklahoma, and we 
do sit on the Committee on Ways and 
Means together. 
Madam Speaker, I just think that 
where we look at today, I have heard so 
much in the last couple weeks about 
looking at this as kitchen table eco-
nomics. 
Madam Speaker, if you want to talk 
about it in real terms that every single 
American would understand, people 
who actually do their bills at their 
kitchen table, that figure out what 
their future looks like at their kitchen 
table, then we need to start talking in 
terms that they understand. 
So when we talk about what America 
gains in revenues, what this Federal 
Government gains in revenues each 
year is $3.5 trillion. This Federal Gov-
ernment spends $6.5 trillion. 
b 2015 
Now, people say, well, that is not too 
bad. That is only a $3 trillion dif-
ference. But what it comes down to, if 
you want to use kitchen table econom-
ics, let’s talk about what it means to 
people who actually sit at a kitchen 
table, sometimes work two jobs, some-
times not only the father but the 
mother gets up and go to work every 
day to put food on the table and put a 
roof over the head of their children and 
plan for the future. 
Let’s talk about kitchen table eco-
nomics, and let’s reduce it down to 
terms that people actually understand: 
A person making $35,000 a year thinks 
it is okay to spend $65,000 a year. 
Nobody with any type of economic 
sense or common sense would say: I 
think that is okay. I think that is the 
way I should live my life. I think that 
is the way I should plan for the future 
because I think it is going to be really 
great for my kids and grandkids going 
forward. 
$3.5 trillion in revenue from tax-
payers, and the government is spending 
$6.5 trillion. That is a difference of 
$30,000 a year for the average person on 
their kitchen table who is spending 
$30,000 more a year than they bring in. 
That is lunacy. Nobody would tell their 
sons or daughters to plan their life 
that way. 
The reason I brought this picture of 
this iceberg is because I believe Amer-
ica right now is facing a Titanic mo-
ment. The truth of the matter is, we 
can’t really see what our total debt is.

October 19, 2021 
It is below the surface. Funded and un-
funded liabilities right now, which the 
American taxpayers are responsible 
for, is $130 trillion. 
It is truly a Titanic moment. We are 
steaming toward an iceberg that is 
going to sink the ship. We sit back and 
talk about these things in terms that 
don’t really matter. We talk about tree 
equity. We talk about this equity and 
that equity. What we don’t talk about 
is the equity to hardworking American 
taxpayers. 
We don’t talk the truth to them, and 
we hope that we will pass a bill that 
they can’t possibly imagine it can’t 
possibly be paid for by only those mak-
ing $400,000 or more a year. 
The constituents that I represent in 
Pennsylvania’s 16th Congressional Dis-
trict know what it is like when they go 
to get a gallon of gas. They know what 
it is like when they have to heat their 
home this winter and know that it is 
probably going to be 50 to 60 percent 
more this winter than it was last win-
ter. 
Their gas, their groceries, everything 
that they consume is going up at a rate 
that they can’t possibly imagine. And 
they can’t imagine it because they are 
not being told the truth. 
We are talking about we are going to 
build it back better. We are going to 
ruin the greatest Nation the world has 
ever known by unsustainable spending 
and by an administration that fails to 
tell the whole truth and what is below 
the surface and what is going to sink 
the ship. 
The tip of the iceberg is the only 
thing the American people see right 
now. The truth lies below the surface. 
Getting the truth out is almost impos-
sible, especially in this House, in the 
people’s House on this floor. 
Madam Speaker, I am sorry to inter-
rupt you. I know you are busy reading 
something 
there, 
but 
perhaps 
you 
ought to read that bill. You ought to 
see exactly what is being proposed. I 
don’t believe the majority has read 
that bill. I don’t believe the majority 
really believes in that bill. But I do 
know the majority will continue to 
keep their heads down, read their 
phones, read their cards, and listen to 
a false narrative coming out of the 
White House and a complicit media 
that refuses to tell America the truth. 
We are at a Titanic moment. We are 
facing debt we cannot possibly sustain. 
We are taking ourselves out of a posi-
tion to be the strongest country in the 
world, and we are doing it right here in 
the people’s House. We are discussing 
taxes and cost of living that are off the 
charts, that we have never seen in our 
life before. And we can continue to 
read our phones, read the teleprompter, 
and whisper to people: Just pay your 
fair share. 
Really? Really? Is that the way we 
are going to run it? Is that the way we 
are going to go forward? Are we going 
to go home to our home districts and 
say: Look, you are just going to have 
to pay your fair share. 
That is what we are going to keep 
telling them. We will whisper our way 
through this crisis, and it will end up 
as a disaster. 
How anybody can sit on the floor of 
this House representing their home dis-
tricts, three-quarters of a million peo-
ple is what most of us represent, and go 
back home and tell them: I did what 
was right for you. 
Never before has this country ever 
faced the crisis it is facing now. It is 
not because of a foreign power. It is not 
because of somebody trying to take us 
over. It is the rotting that is taking 
place right inside this House in this 
session. 
Madam Speaker, I would implore 
every single Member of the House—I 
don’t care if you are a Democrat; I 
don’t care if you are Republican; I 
don’t care if you are liberal or you are 
a conservative, just stop being stupid 
because there ain’t no fixing stupid. 
The path we are on right now is a 
complete disaster. Everybody knows it. 
Not everybody speaks it because they 
just don’t want to break ranks. 
This is a Titanic moment. This is 
what America is facing. I would im-
plore each Member of this House to 
wake up and do what is right for the 
American people. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania for 
his passion on this subject. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Utah’s First Congres-
sional District (Mr. MOORE), a fellow 
baseball player who had the distinction 
of hitting an in-the-park home run at 
our big win 2 weeks ago. I really appre-
ciate that. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to highlight one specific dan-
ger of the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion rec-
onciliation package. My colleagues 
have highlighted many concerns and 
many issues that this tax-and-spend 
monstrosity will advance, partisan pri-
orities like taxpayer-funded abortions, 
the Green New Deal, a $2.1 trillion tax 
increase 
on 
businesses 
and 
hard-
working American families. The provi-
sion that I am speaking of specifically 
threatens our individual freedoms and 
personal privacy. 
This provision is an expansive IRS 
mandate that would give the govern-
ment unprecedented access into our 
wallets and spending patterns. This 
provision would force our neighborhood 
banks and local credit unions to hand 
over constituents’ private financial in-
formation directly to the IRS. 
This decree levies an outrageous 
compliance cost on the credit unions 
and banks that serve my community, 
meaning higher fees and lower saving 
yields for First District families. 
More importantly, this intrusion into 
our transactions poses extraordinary 
privacy concerns and subjects Utahns’ 
financial information to hacking, po-
litical targeting, and government sur-
veillance. This abusive provision will 
collect massive amounts of personal fi-
nancial data on middle-class families. 
Imagine the ways that any adminis-
tration, Democrat or Republican, could 
be tempted to use that information and 
to intrude on our private businesses 
and lifestyle choices. 
Even still, this will not close the tax 
gap. This provision isn’t targeting 
wealthy tax evaders, as President 
Biden claims. It is targeting normal, 
working-class, 
everyday 
Americans. 
$3.5 trillion, and for President Biden to 
say it is not going to cost us anything? 
Democrats 
know 
they 
can’t 
tax 
enough to make up that difference, so 
they are finding these unique, obscure 
ways to employ or to basically deploy 
the IRS on everyday working Ameri-
cans in their regular checking ac-
counts. 
I condemn this unconstitutional and 
invasive Federal overreach, and I stand 
with Utah families who depend on the 
security and privacy that their finan-
cial institutions provide. 
I encourage my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to oppose this 
provision, and I look forward to voting 
against 
the 
entirety 
of 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s reconciliation package. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Wisconsin’s 
Sixth District (Mr. GROTHMAN), who 
serves on the Budget Committee and is 
an advocate for workforce development 
and welfare reform. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
hope the American public is paying at-
tention as we have three bills moving 
through here, including the reconcili-
ation bill. 
In the year that we just finished, 
which included some supposedly once- 
in-a-lifetime COVID spending bills, 41 
percent of the money spent by the gov-
ernment 
was 
borrowed. 
President 
Biden has laid out his dream for what 
will happen in fiscal year 2022, and now 
that we are back to normal, he still is 
borrowing 31 percent of the budget. 
Think about that. 
That would be like saying if you are 
making $60,000 a year, next year I am 
going to spend $90,000 a year. The top 
line numbers on this are just unbeliev-
able. And these numbers are without 
taking into account the almost certain 
increases in interest rates that we are 
going to have to pay on our Federal 
debt. 
I would say there are so many hor-
rible parts of this bill, but I think the 
most dangerous part is, in addition to 
not funding the southern border, there 
are provisions in here clearly designed 
to have a dramatic increase in the 
number of illegal immigrants, which 
will turn into legal citizens. 
Right now, America is used to having 
about 800,000 a year sworn in as new 
citizens. Pro-immigration groups sug-
gest that this bill would add, in one 
shot, over 10 million new immigrants. 
Just disastrous. 
Among other carrots to get more im-
migrants here, we are giving away free 
Pell grants, which is to say free schol-
arships if you come here illegally. That

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5669 
October 19, 2021 
that the average American, middle- 
class kid is paying $20,000, $30,000, 
$40,000, $50,000 in debt to get his college 
degree and is going to wind up in debt 
into his forties. 
If you come here illegally under this 
crazy bill, we are going to give you free 
college. 
Unbelievable. 
Permanently 
changing America to say the govern-
ment should take care of 3- and 4-year- 
olds when there is no evidence or scant 
evidence that this will improve the 
outcomes for American children and 
their education system, all you are 
doing is, I think, following an absolute 
horrible ideology that says that the 
government ought to be the ones tak-
ing care of the children. 
As far as families are concerned—in-
creasing the marriage penalty, be it in-
crease the marriage penalty for the 
earned income tax credit, increase in 
the marriage penalty on Pell grants, 
putting out more low-income housing, 
which is also designed to break down 
the families and further erode the sta-
bility of future generations. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to vote no on the massive 
increase in the number of citizens here, 
the massive increase and the role the 
government plays in American life, and 
begin to restore themselves to some 
fiscal competence. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Wisconsin. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Alabama’s First Congres-
sional District (Mr. CARL), a new fresh-
man and a fellow small business owner. 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to object to this ridiculous, 
wasteful spending that my colleagues 
from across the aisle are trying to ram 
through with this proposed $3.5 trillion 
reconciliation bill. 
We have real needs in this country, 
but instead of addressing them, the 
Democrats are attempting to spend 
somewhere around $3.5 trillion on so-
cial programs, Green New Deal man-
dates, and all kinds of junk that adds 
up. 
If you were to take and stack up $3.5 
trillion in $1 bills, you would have a 
total of 250,000 miles of bills. That is 
how tall it would be. 
This is unacceptable. It is totally ri-
diculous. It is absolutely absurd to con-
sider spending that much money in an 
area that we are just beginning to get 
involved in, which is green energy. 
It would be one thing if money was 
going to actually improve this country 
in a massive way. You might see some 
support from the Republican side. You 
might even see some of your own 
Democrats coming back to your own 
party. But as we all know, there are 
things in this bill that are horrible. 
b 2030 
I want to just mention three of them 
very briefly: 
One, we are throwing trillions of dol-
lars at this ridiculous Green New Deal 
mandate. We are going to mandate 
things on corporations and on people 
they cannot afford. We are going to 
break the back of small businesses. It 
is coming. 
Two, we are spending billions of dol-
lars to expand the numbers in the 
IRS—88,000 new IRS agents. Those 
agents aren’t going to separate us from 
being Democrats and Republicans. All 
they are looking at is a dollar figure. 
Madam Speaker, I propose to you 
there is going to be some blowback on 
that. You are giving them the right to 
spy on every American in this country, 
and that is wrong. It is wrong. We 
shouldn’t fear our government. We 
shouldn’t fear the IRS. They should 
fear us because we are the taxpayer; we 
are the people. 
Three, it will direct taxpayers’ dol-
lars directly to perform and to promote 
abortion. Never has that ever been 
done in this country before. That is 
going to be a game changer. 
Madam Speaker, I suggest to you 
there is a tsunami coming up in 2022 
because the American people are upset. 
This bill will also increase taxes and 
the cost of living of everyday, hard-
working Americans. Again, this is un-
acceptable. 
We are nearly $30 trillion in debt. In-
flation has risen every month that 
President Biden has been in office, and 
Americans across this country are see-
ing their cost of living skyrocket. In 
my small community I am looking at 
gas at $1 more a gallon. You can’t 
reach into a hardworking American’s 
pocket, Madam Speaker, without feel-
ing their gas money, and when they 
have to give a dollar more a gallon, 
they are going to remember that. 
Let me just remind my colleagues 
from across the aisle, the American 
people are fed up with this foolishness. 
I promise you, Madam Speaker, they 
will remember in 2022. That tsunami is 
coming. I have spent a lot of time try-
ing to make a lot of friends on the 
Democratic side. I think it is ex-
tremely important for this House to 
work together and not against one an-
other, but if you follow this adminis-
tration off this cliff, there is no return. 
The American people are going to turn 
on the people who voted for it. It is 
time to get serious about fiscal respon-
sibility and learn to live within our 
means. 
Or is it too late? 
Our children and our grandchildren 
deserve better than this, and I will not 
stand by and watch this country mort-
gage our future. 
Washington has a spending problem, 
not a revenue problem. We collect plen-
ty of money, it is just how we spend it. 
We have got to learn to cut back. It is 
reckless and irresponsible for this body 
to continue throwing trillions of dol-
lars around like there is nothing to it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to op-
pose this terrible $3.5 trillion wreck 
bill, as I love to call it. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from the 21st District 
of Texas (Mr. ROY). My dear friend, 
CHIP ROY, has extraordinary passion 
about 
constitutional 
accountability 
and fiscal responsibility. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oklahoma for 
yielding. I have no ill will about what 
happened at the Cotton Bowl last 
week. But I will say that on the floor 
of the House of Representatives last 
week I was entertained by listening to 
the majority leader brag—brag—about 
voting 49 times to raise the debt ceiling 
in his career, the debt going up from $1 
trillion to now $281⁄2 trillion. 
What do my illustrious colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle want to do 
now? 
Throw another $31⁄2 trillion on top of 
massive inflation, people getting paid 
not to work, and an economy getting 
absolutely crushed. That is where my 
Democratic colleagues want to take us. 
But the thing is, it is not about the 
$281⁄2 trillion. That is horrible—under-
mining the dollar, undermining the 
economy, racking up debt, printing 
money, and making us weak compared 
to China. 
But it really isn’t that. It is that my 
Democratic colleagues want to spend 
that money to come after you, the 
American people. That is what that 
money is for. It is to go after the 
American people. It is to fund the FBI 
to go after parents at school boards; a 
school board where this summer a dad 
went to talk to the school board and 
exercise his First Amendment rights 
because his daughter was raped in a 
bathroom. 
And what do the illustrious geniuses 
of the Loudoun County School Board 
do? 
What do the school board administra-
tions across this country do, the asso-
ciation? 
They said that we should call them 
domestic terrorists. 
What does the Biden administration 
do? 
They come out and say that we are 
going to fund the Department of Jus-
tice, we are going to say we should 
have people going after parents—going 
after parents—for speaking at a school 
board where his little girl—his ninth 
grade girl—was raped in a bathroom by 
a dude wearing a skirt. 
What in the world is happening to 
our country? 
That is what my Democratic col-
leagues want to do. They want to fund 
bureaucrats to go after the American 
people. They want to fund OSHA. They 
want to give more money to OSHA, in-
creasing the max for OSHA penalties 
for repeat offenders of violating the 
President’s 
illegal, 
unconstitutional 
vaccine 
mandate 
from 
$70,000 
to 
$700,000 minimum penalty, from $500 to 
$50,000 going after businesses who dare 
to say they don’t believe it is their role 
to tell their employees that they must 
get vaccinated. 
But in the infinite wisdom of this 
President, he thinks he has the power 
to go after the American people. 
Well, God bless the pilots of South-
west, and God bless the employees out

there saying ‘‘no’’ and saying: You 
don’t get to do that. 
But what do my Democratic col-
leagues want to do? 
They want to fund more bureaucrats 
to go after private citizens and private 
businesses who do not want to bow 
down to the edict of the President of 
the United States issuing an unlawful, 
illegal mandate. They want to fund 
more Federal Government restricting 
rights to work, $835 billion in welfare 
through the Tax Code, expand Federal 
Government control over local zoning, 
empowering the IRS, as my colleagues 
have already eloquently spoken about, 
and going after your ability to have 
the energy to fuel your businesses, fuel 
your homes, and making the American 
people subject to energy poverty. 
That is what our Democratic col-
leagues have in mind. 
Finally, giving billions of dollars to 
woke colleges, wealthy liberals, and 
the rest of the left’s political base. 
That is the direction my Democratic 
colleagues want to take this country. 
I think the American people know 
this is the wrong direction. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this disastrous legis-
lation, and I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from the Fourth Dis-
trict of Indiana (Mr. BAIRD). 
Mr. BAIRD is a decorated Vietnam 
veteran who was recognized with two 
Purple Hearts for the wounds he re-
ceived while protecting our freedoms. 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank KEVIN for coordinating this 
Special Order, and I thank the gen-
tleman for doing that. 
Madam Speaker, this multitrillion 
dollar Big Government spending pack-
age proposed by the Democrats isn’t 
going to help our country. In fact, it is 
going to be fundamentally harmful for 
generations of Americans to come. 
Right now, America is saddled with 
skyrocketing inflation rates that have 
left American families paying more for 
everything, and supply chain shortages 
threaten to make the holiday shopping 
season more difficult and expensive 
than ever. 
Democrats are promising a package 
that will prolong labor shortages and 
consequently inflation rates by con-
tinuing welfare benefits without work 
requirement 
for 
able-bodied 
adults 
without dependents at a time when 
there are over 10 million jobs available. 
How can we resolve labor shortages 
and rising inflation rates when the 
Democrats continue to champion poli-
cies that encourage people to remain 
unemployed? 
Instead of addressing pressing issues 
that are having a true impact on Amer-
ican families, Democrats continue to 
push partisan initiatives that are non-
starters for many Americans, like 
mandating that taxpayers fund abor-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, this package proves 
that many Democrats are out of touch 
with both the needs and the values of 
the American people, and I am proud to 
join my colleagues in standing in oppo-
sition to this legislation. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from the Eighth Dis-
trict of Florida (Mr. POSEY). 
I would also like to say he serves on 
the 
Financial 
Services 
Committee 
which has a big part in the jurisdiction 
of this bill that we are discussing. 
I would also like to point out the dis-
tinction he had in working and serving 
in the Florida Senate when we had the 
election laws. Much was spoken about 
that today in some of the 1-minute 
speeches. He worked in the Florida 
Senate and helped work on the reform 
laws regarding what happened with the 
2000 Presidential race. 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, iron-
ically, it was my bill, the Election Re-
form Act of 2001—after the closest 
Presidential election in history, de-
cided by about 350 votes—and my Elec-
tion Reform Act, after all that hos-
tility, passed 38–2 in the Senate and 
120–0 in the Florida House, and that is 
how election reform bills should pass. 
If they don’t pass with an over-
whelming majority of both sides, they 
are not fair and they shouldn’t be en-
forced. 
Americans are feeling the rise in 
prices at the gas pump and in our gro-
cery stores. Favorite products are in 
short supply, and some are even not 
available. To make matters worse, 
they are discovering that the resolu-
tion before us is full of wasteful spend-
ing and big tax increases. 
The administration only responds to 
our economic crisis by making excuses 
and pointing fingers. Claiming supply 
chain disruptions and inflation are just 
high-class 
problems 
is 
incredibly 
wrong. 
Madam Speaker, you can call it what 
you want on TV, but at the end of the 
day, it is just, plain and simple, bad 
policy. All this resolution does that we 
are asked to vote for is to green-light 
more of it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, may I 
ask how much time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oklahoma has 8 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to give one last shout-out to Re-
publican Study Committee Chairman 
JIM BANKS. He has been fighting this 
ridiculous spending from the get-go. It 
is largely due to JIM’s leadership that 
so many Americans know just how bad 
this reconciliation bill really is. 
I would like to thank everyone who 
participated in tonight’s Special Order. 
We heard really compelling stories 
from our colleagues about the dangers 
of 
Biden’s 
out-of-control 
socialist 
spending. Our Nation is still recovering 
from forced lockdowns that killed 
small businesses across this country 
and wreaked havoc on the intellectual 
development of an entire generation of 
students. 
Our number one priority should be 
empowering job creators to grow and 
succeed and growing their local econo-
mies with them. Biden’s build back 
broke plan kills small businesses and 
increases our reliance on cradle-to- 
grave welfare systems. I am living 
proof that never-ending handouts sim-
ply do not work. They only increase 
the dependence on the system that will 
never help individuals become self-suf-
ficient. 
To quote my favorite President, Ron-
ald Reagan, the greatest social pro-
gram in the world is a job. 
We need more people in jobs, not less. 
All that the Biden administration has 
to show for 9 months in power is an 
abysmal 
unemployment 
rate 
and 
record high inflation. It is simply not 
working. It is time to give fiscal re-
sponsibility a serious try. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Representative HERN for 
leading this entire session and the op-
portunity to close. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to close 
today’s session by remembering the 
sacrifice and heroism of Staff Sergeant 
Taylor Hoover who bravely gave his 
life while defending Abbey Gate from 
violent extremists in Kabul, Afghani-
stan, on August 26, 2021. 
After the tragic events of September 
11, 2001, Staff Sergeant Hoover knew he 
wanted to be a marine. At the time of 
his death, Staff Sergeant Hoover had 
served as a marine for 11 years and was 
on his third tour in Afghanistan. 
In Utah we have been devastated by 
this news. 
On Sunday after the attacks, I joined 
hundreds of Utahns gathered at the 
State capitol for a memorial vigil to 
honor Staff Sergeant Hoover. I also at-
tended his funeral service before being 
laid to rest in Arlington National Cem-
etery and was overwhelmed by memo-
ries shared by his family and friends. 
He was treasured, loved, and admired, 
and he gave all for our freedoms. 
Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover will 
rightly be remembered as a hero in the 
Halls of Congress, in Utah, and across 
the Nation that he served. 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his recognition of 
such heroism. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

Eternal God, touch the secret place 
inside each of us and know our hearts. 
In the stillness of this prayer moment, 
make us so transparent that we shall 
connect to Your power. 
Lord, strengthen our lawmakers by 
the power of Your Holy Spirit, as the 
light of Your wisdom illuminates the 
recesses of their hearts. Lord, give our 
Senators the wisdom to be quick to lis-
ten, slow to speak, and slow to anger. 
When this day is done, may they look 
back with the realization that they 
have accomplished Your purposes. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last 
night, I began the process for the Sen-
ate to hold a vote on the Freedom to 
Vote Act, a commonsense proposal 
that would make it easier for every eli-
gible American to participate in free 
and fair elections. 
The bill, which my colleagues, in-
cluding yourself, very diligently have 
worked on for months to put together 
will set basic standards to improve bal-
lot access across the country, end par-
tisan gerrymandering, and fight the in-
fluence of dark money and special in-
terests in our politics. It will go a long 
way toward restoring people’s faith in 
our democracy while respecting the 
role of States in administering elec-
tions. 
Every Senate Democrat has united 
around this legislation, and I thank all 
of my colleagues, including you, Mr. 
President, who worked so hard on this 
bill. I especially want to thank my 
friend Senator MANCHIN, who has spent 
weeks reaching out to our Republican 
colleagues in an effort to find common 
ground. I applaud him for his commit-
ment to trying to get something done 
on this issue in a bipartisan way if we 
can. 
The clock is ticking for this Chamber 
to take meaningful action to protect 
Americans’ right to the franchise. So, 
tomorrow, the Senate will vote on clo-
ture on the motion to proceed to the 
Freedom to Vote Act. 
Every Senator will have to answer a 
straightforward question: Should the 
Senate be allowed to simply begin a de-
bate on voting rights, as has been done 
many times throughout our history? 
That is what tomorrow’s vote is about: 
Do the Members of this Chamber think 
protecting our democracy is worthy of 
even a debate in the Senate? 
Senate Democrats think it abso-
lutely is. If our Republican colleagues 
don’t like our ideas for fighting voter 
suppression and guarding against elec-
tion subversion, then they ought to tell 
us what they have in mind. If they are 
so confident of their position, then 
let’s debate the issue on the Senate 
floor. What is there to be afraid of by 
allowing simply a debate? 
Democrats are ready to work with 
Republicans in good faith if they vote 
to begin a debate on voting rights. We 
know disagreements run deep. We don’t 
hide from that. But if our Republican 
colleagues have good ideas, we will 
work with them. We will listen to 
them, and if these ideas are truly 
aligned with the goals of this bill to 
protect our democracy, we will work to 
include them in the final text.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7038 
October 19, 2021 
What Republicans should not do— 
what they must not do—is squelch any 
chance for the Senate to debate some-
thing as critical and sacrosanct as the 
right to vote, nor should they pretend 
like the Federal Government has no 
role to play in protecting our democ-
racy. On the contrary, throughout his-
tory, the Federal Government has 
sometimes been the only remedy when 
States try to suppress the vote. And no 
honest observer can look at the way 
the States have changed election laws 
this last year and pretend that there is 
nothing malicious afoot. 
As Senator MANCHIN said earlier this 
year regarding congressional action on 
voting rights, inaction is not an op-
tion. Let me repeat that because this is 
one place where Senator MANCHIN and I 
agree. As Senator MANCHIN said earlier 
this year regarding congressional ac-
tion on voting rights, ‘‘Inaction is not 
an option.’’ Inaction is not an option. I 
agree. All 49 other Democrats agree 
with Senator MANCHIN. Inaction is not 
an option. 
The Senate can rise to the task if 
given the chance, but its Members 
must vote to begin debate first. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. President, now on Build Back 
Better, for decades now, millions of 
families in this country have found the 
basic American promise that if you 
work hard, then you can have a better 
life for yourselves and your loved ones, 
the proverbial American dream—Amer-
icans have found it is getting harder to 
reach. That is what creates a sourness 
in the land. That sunny optimism so 
crucial to our identity has receded 
away from view. 
Democrats 
have 
promised 
to 
do 
something 
about 
it. 
When 
Senate 
Democrats secured our majority this 
year, we committed to delivering on 
the trust that the American people 
placed in us and to respond to the chal-
lenge of our times. That is why we im-
mediately set to work and passed the 
American Rescue Plan to propel our 
economy out of the crisis of COVID. 
And that has been the driving force be-
hind our efforts to make President 
Biden’s Build Back Better agenda into 
law. 
Last night, I continued my discus-
sions with Speaker PELOSI and Presi-
dent Biden as we work to an agreement 
on legislation we can bring to the floor. 
I know that, throughout the day, the 
President will meet with a number of 
Members from both Chambers, and, as 
the week progresses, I will continue to 
hold talks with my colleagues as we 
move forward to the finish line. 
Here is what matters: Build Back 
Better legislation is going to dramati-
cally improve the lives of tens of mil-
lions of American families for years to 
come. Something that impactful is not 
an easy feat, but we are going to keep 
working. By passing this legislation, 
we can create good-paying jobs for this 
generation and the next; we can lower 
costs and cut taxes for American fami-
lies while taking overdue steps to 
meaningfully address the climate cri-
sis. 
We still have work to do, but we are 
going to continue at it until—until the 
job is done. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
every day, American families are feel-
ing real pain because of the reckless 
and inflationary policies that Demo-
crats have already rammed through. 
The American people are facing the 
highest inflation in more than 10 years. 
They are paying an extra dollar a gal-
lon at the pump and soaring prices at 
the grocery store. Real wages are 
down. Rising prices are wiping out 
raises and bonuses. Last month’s jobs 
report was another huge disappoint-
ment, showing less than half the hiring 
that had been expected. 
But, amazingly, the Biden adminis-
tration and many of our colleagues 
seem to think the cure for this infla-
tion hangover is the hair of the dog. 
They are trying to exploit the eco-
nomic anxiety they have created by 
pitching yet another multitrillion-dol-
lar socialist spending spree. They want 
to try to inflate their way out of infla-
tion. 
Oh, and get this: The Biden adminis-
tration is simultaneously saying that 
their latest spending spree will cost 
zero dollars. 
Let me say that again. The Biden ad-
ministration is simultaneously saying 
their latest spending spree will cost 
zero dollars—it will be totally free— 
and it will come with massive, historic 
tax hikes in order to pay for it. 
All this socialism is going to be to-
tally free of charge—but it also needs 
the biggest IRS cash grab in decades in 
order to pay for it. Go figure. The 
Democrats’ plan contains more than 40 
separate tax hikes on the American 
people—40 separate tax hikes on the 
American 
people. 
These 
increases 
would impact taxpayers at every in-
come level. Small business owners and 
family farmers would feel yet another 
pinch. Even the tax hikes that are os-
tensibly aimed at Washington Demo-
crats’ favorite punching bag, American 
industry, would find their way back 
down to working families. 
Democrats’ war on affordable Amer-
ican energy would hit pocketbooks just 
in time to spike winter heating bills 
and the prices of made-in-America 
goods. Their corporate tax hikes would 
leave American businesses paying a 
higher tax rate than businesses—listen 
to this—in communist China. As the 
Joint Committee on Taxation has 
shown, two-thirds of the burden of 
Democrats’ proposed new taxes on 
businesses would fall on lower and mid-
dle-income Americans—two-thirds. 
But Washington Democrats aren’t 
just laying out massive new tax hikes 
in the light of day; they also want to 
hand the IRS new snooping powers to 
start digging through individual Amer-
icans’ bank accounts. They want to 
pay 
for 
their 
reckless 
taxing-and- 
spending spree by treating normal 
American households like everybody is 
under audit. They want to treat nor-
mal American households like every-
body is under audit. 
So, to review, this has been the story 
of Democrats’ unified control of gov-
ernment in 2021. Here is what they have 
done: First, they knee-capped our eco-
nomic recovery with stifling spending, 
including to pay Americans more to 
stay on the sidelines than to rejoin the 
workforce. Then, as working families 
feel the pinch of runaway prices, they 
are putting forward even more spend-
ing and also massive tax hikes. As 
icing on the cake, they have schemed 
for even greater access to Americans’ 
personal finances so Washington bu-
reaucrats can spy—can spy—on citi-
zens’ routine transactions. 
This is not what American voters 
signed up for, and it won’t earn a shred 
of support from this side of the aisle. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. President, now on another mat-
ter, last week, Washington, DC, was 
again the site of illegal political vio-
lence from the radical left. A mob of 
environmental extremists set upon the 
Department 
of 
the 
Interior. 
They 
shoved through blocked doors. They 
hurt the police and security personnel 
who tried to hold the line. These radi-
cals put one law enforcement officer 
actually in the hospital. 
Political violence and attacks on 
government 
buildings 
are 
flatout 
wrong no matter who is perpetrating 
them or what they claim to believe. 
That is why it is puzzling that last 
week’s incidents attracted so little at-
tention and condemnation. The White 
House was directly asked about the 
day’s demonstrations just a few hours 
after the violence and the break-in oc-
curred. Instead of condemning the radi-
cals, the Biden administration actually 
praised them—praised them. 
The White House Press Secretary was 
asked about the protests multiple 
hours after the violence and the break- 
in and said—this is a direct quote—‘‘Of 
course we’re listening to advocates and 
people who have been elevating the 
issue of climate for decades. They have 
important voices.’’ 
So that is how the Biden administra-
tion officially described the demonstra-
tors who put a cop in the hospital— 
‘‘important voices.’’ This is just ab-
surd. But those weren’t just regret-
table comments; they capture the po-
liticized and selective approach to law 
enforcement that increasingly defines 
the Democratic Party. 
Last year, our Nation saw a 30-per-
cent jump in homicides—the biggest 
jump in the murder rate in modern his-
tory; the worst spike in the homicide 
rate in modern American history. The 
head of the National Center for Health 
Statistics says it was the worst in-
crease in more than 100 years, since at

least 1905. Actually, he went on to say 
that even 1905 wasn’t comparable be-
cause that was likely a clerical matter. 
So the experts don’t really know the 
last time the murder rate shot up this 
much, but we know it was before the 
average American family had elec-
tricity or indoor plumbing. That was a 
long time ago. 
Responding to this terrible trend 
should be very simple. It should be a 
no-brainer for elected officials at every 
level: more and better resources for 
more and better policing for more and 
better community safety. 
Instead, liberal local officials across 
the country from city halls and city 
councils to right here in Congress have 
gotten caught up in the radicalism of 
‘‘defund the police.’’ 
As one leftwing House Member put it, 
‘‘Not only do we need to disinvest from 
police . . . we need to completely dis-
mantle’’—‘‘dismantle’’—her local po-
lice department.’’ That was a Member 
of the Congress. 
Another declared, ‘‘Policing in our 
country is inherently and intentionally 
racist.’’ 
One news story from last weekend re-
ported that ‘‘a crowd of 100 people 
wreaked havoc in downtown Portland, 
Oregon, this week—smashing store-
front windows, lighting dumpsters on 
fire and causing at least $500,000 in 
damage—but police officers didn’t stop 
them. Portland Police Bureau officials 
say that’s because of legislation passed 
by Oregon lawmakers this year, which 
restricts the tools they can use to con-
front people vandalizing buildings and 
causing mayhem.’’ So apparently it is 
OK in Portland to do those kinds of 
things because of legislation they 
passed out in Oregon. 
While all of this is percolating, what 
is the Department of Justice focused 
on? 
Where is the Attorney General train-
ing his firepower? 
Well, here is the answer: Two weeks 
ago, Attorney General Garland pub-
lished a special memorandum directing 
Federal law to focus specifically on 
parents 
who 
are 
dissatisfied 
with 
‘‘woke’’ school boards and far-left in-
doctrination. You get the picture here. 
The worst spike in the murder rate in 
over a century and the Attorney Gen-
eral wants main justice laser-focused 
on—listen to this—parents who are 
asking questions about their kids’ cur-
riculum. It is beyond parody. 
To be perfectly clear, I never offered 
anything but condemnation for vio-
lence and threats in the political 
square, but local law enforcement is 
fully capable of handling isolated inci-
dents where crimes are committed. 
There is absolutely no reason—none— 
for Attorney General Garland to pull 
this J. Edgar Hoover act on American 
parents. But these strange and warped 
priorities are defining the Biden ad-
ministration’s approach: soft on crime; 
heavy on indulging far-left fads. 
Currently deadlocked in the Judici-
ary Committee is the nomination of 
Rachael Rollins, a would-be U.S. Attor-
ney who has a national reputation for 
being soft on crime during her time as 
a prosecutor. In her current role as dis-
trict attorney, the nominee has said 
that prosecutors in her jurisdiction 
should—listen to this—decline to pros-
ecute a whole laundry list of crimes— 
just decline to prosecute them. From 
shoplifting to trespassing, to drug pos-
session with the intent to distribute, 
Ms. Rollins wants her county to be a 
place where these crimes get free 
passes. 
And the Biden administration re-
wards this with a big promotion? 
Mr. President, support for equal jus-
tice, support for law enforcement, and 
support for the innocent people they 
protect go hand in hand. It is time for 
the Biden administration to get serious 
about the rule of law. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as if in 
morning business. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
REMEMBERING TIMUEL BLACK 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it was 
December 7, 1941, a young African- 
American man from the South Side of 
Chicago was celebrating his 23rd birth-
day. He was in a neighborhood tavern, 
and somebody bolted through the front 
door and cried out that the Japanese 
had attacked Pearl Harbor. 
In 1943, that same young man was in-
ducted into the U.S. Army, a seg-
regated institution at the time. He 
landed in Normandy within days of D- 
day. He fought across France in the 
Battle of the Bulge. While his unit re-
grouped, they heard rumors—horrible 
rumors—about a camp near Weimar, 
Germany. This young soldier and his 
commanding officer hopped into a jeep 
to see for themselves. What he wit-
nessed at Buchenwald, the Nazi death 
camp, changed this man forever. 
As he recalled in his memoir, his first 
thought was ‘‘this is what happened to 
my ancestors.’’ This is what happens 
when human beings see others as less 
than human. 
Then he made a vow to himself. He 
said: 
I made an emotional decision that when I 
returned from the Army, the rest of my life 
would be spent trying to make [the place] 
where I live, and the bigger world, a place 
where all people could have peace and jus-
tice. 
That soldier’s name was Timuel 
Black. He kept that vow faithfully for 
76 years. Tim Black was a foot soldier 
for justice. He died last week at the age 
of 102, living in the neighborhood that 
had been his home nearly all his life, a 
place that he personally called a ‘‘Sa-
cred Ground,’’ the South Side of Chi-
cago. 
His passing is our loss—to our city, 
our State, and our Nation. If you are 
not from Chicago, you may not know 
his name, but we all live in an America 
that is better because Timuel Black 
helped shape it. He was a living link to 
some of our Nation’s worst sins and our 
greatest achievements. 
All four of Tim Black’s grandparents 
were born into slavery. When he was a 
year old, Tim Black and his parents 
left Alabama and the terrorism of Jim 
Crow and headed to Chicago, part of 
the first wave of America’s Great Mi-
gration. They settled on the South 
Side in a then-segregated neighborhood 
now known as Bronzeville. 
After he served in World War II, Tim 
Black returned to Chicago. He grad-
uated 
from 
Roosevelt 
University, 
earned a master’s degree in history 
from the University of Chicago. He was 
teaching history in Chicago public 
schools in 1955 when he heard a young 
minister speaking on television, he was 
so moved that he decided, at his own 
expense, to fly to Montgomery, AL, to 
meet this man, a man by the name of 
Martin Luther King, Jr. 
In 1963, Dr. King and the great Afri-
can-American labor leader A. Philip 
Randolph called on Tim Black. They 
asked him to organize Chicago’s con-
tingent to come to Washington for the 
great March on Washington. Three 
years later, Tim Black asked them to 
return the favor and he persuaded Dr. 
King to bring his campaign for racial 
justice to Chicago. Together, they 
pressed for an end to discriminatory 
housing laws that squeezed many of 
the city’s Black residents into over-
priced, ramshackle apartments in un-
safe, segregated neighborhoods with 
few jobs and failing schools. 
In 1975, after decades working at high 
schools, Tim Black became a professor 
of sociology, anthropology, and Black 
history at what is now known as Har-
old Washington College. He was the 
Griot of Chicago, who preserved the 
rich history of the Great Migration and 
Bronzeville. He was also a brilliant po-
litical strategist who understood how 
to use his power to help others. 
So, in 1982, Harold Washington, who 
had been his friend since they were 
children, was representing their neigh-
borhood in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. Professor Black and a few 
others went to Harold Washington and 
said: You have to run for mayor of Chi-
cago. 
Washington replied: ‘‘Sure. If you get 
50,000 new Black voters and raise 
$100,000, then I’ll consider it.’’ 
Washington figured that was the end 
of it; they would never reach those 
goals. But Professor Tim Black started 
a fundraising drive and helped organize 
a voter registration campaign that ul-
timately registered not 100,000, not 
50,000, but 263,000 new voters in Chi-
cago, and he raised more than $1 mil-
lion for the Harold Washington cam-
paign. 
In 1983, with the support from voters 
from all backgrounds—Black, White, 
and Brown—Harold Washington be-
came Chicago’s first Black mayor. 
A decade later, a young lawyer by 
the name of Barack Obama sought out

Professor Tim Black’s guidance when 
he first considered running for office. 
Last month, President Obama returned 
to the South Side to break ground on 
the 
Obama 
Presidential 
Center 
in 
Jackson. Although Professor Black’s 
failing health didn’t allow him to at-
tend in person, it is a good bet that 
ceremony couldn’t have happened with-
out him. 
Mr. President, I was blessed to know 
Tim Black. When Barack Obama, my 
Senate colleague from Illinois, was 
elected President, I was given a hand-
ful of tickets to the inauguration. The 
first name that came to my mind was 
Tim Black. He had to be there, and his 
wife Zenobia Johnson-Black, a personal 
friend who volunteered to drive me in 
my first Senate campaign. Zenobia is a 
wonderful person. She is an exciting 
driver, and we had many escapades to-
gether. 
So I invited Tim and Zenobia to come 
and sit in the best seats that I had for 
the inauguration of Barack Obama, the 
first African-American President from 
the South Side of Chicago. 
I was fortunate I knew Tim Black. I 
counted him as a friend. I was there 
sitting next to him at his 100th birth-
day party. It was a great night, and the 
man still had it all together and a 
great sense of humor. 
Loretta and I send our condolences to 
his beloved wife of 40 years, Zenobia 
Johnson-Black, his daughter Ermetra, 
and his countless friends and students. 
A great man has left us. He will be 
missed. 
FREEDOM TO VOTE ACT 
Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate 
will vote on whether to protect free 
and fair elections in America. 
A big question we have to ask in the 
U.S. Senate is whether the right to 
vote and free and fair elections are 
worth any of our time. 
You see, the first vote we have here 
is what is known as a motion to pro-
ceed. It is a basic question in the Sen-
ate: You want to talk about some-
thing? Is it important enough for your 
time? You want to bring it up here and 
say a few words about the right to vote 
in America? 
That is the first vote. I think it is 
pretty simple. 
Why wouldn’t we, at this moment in 
history, with everything that is going 
on, spend some time talking about the 
right to vote? 
Senator MCCONNELL, the Republican 
leader, says, no, we shouldn’t take any 
time to discuss the right to vote in the 
United States of America. He and 
many of our Republican colleagues are 
threatening to use the age-old weapon 
against civil rights, the filibuster, to 
stop even a conversation on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate about the right to 
vote. 
That would make it the third time 
this year that Senate Republicans have 
used the filibuster to kill voting rights 
legislation. They filibustered For the 
People Act twice this year after it 
passed the House. They said then they 
support voting rights, but not that vot-
ing rights bill. They said more com-
promise was needed. You can’t reach 
compromise on anything until you talk 
about it. 
We are going to have a motion to 
proceed to talk about voting rights on 
the floor of the Senate tomorrow. If 
they want to offer a compromise, if 
they want to get into a conversation or 
debate, that is the moment. 
This 
empty 
Chamber—I 
wonder 
sometimes why we leave it the way it 
is. This would be a great meeting hall. 
We could rent it out for wedding recep-
tions and have something productive 
happen on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
But instead, this empty Chamber, day 
after day, finds ways to avoid the im-
portant issues of our time. That is sad. 
There are very few of us who have 
been given this great honor and oppor-
tunity to serve in the Senate. We are 
supposed to come and talk about the 
things that matter in America. 
Isn’t the right to vote one of the 
most important things that matters in 
this country? 
The Freedom to Vote Act is a com-
promise itself. It is based on a set of 
principles offered by Senator MANCHIN 
of 
West 
Virginia. 
Now, 
Senator 
MANCHIN has not concealed the fact 
that he didn’t agree with the original 
bill, but in fairness to him, he sat down 
in good faith and bargained a com-
promised bill. He has worked exhaus-
tively for months with Democrats, Re-
publicans, and Independents to find 
some common ground. I salute him for 
that. That is what we all should be 
doing. 
The Freedom to Vote Act includes 
reasonable national standards for a 
voter ID in States that require identi-
fication for in-person voting. Now, that 
is a big concession from the Demo-
cratic side because, although many of 
our States have a photo voter ID re-
quirement, many do not, and we be-
lieve in some cases in the past it has 
been abused. 
With the fundamental concept of a 
voter ID, I don’t have any objection to, 
as long as it is managed and adminis-
tered fairly. That is what we are set-
ting out to do. 
If our Republican colleagues are real-
ly worried about election integrity and 
making sure voters are who they say 
they are, wouldn’t you think that they 
would at least vote to start the debate 
on the Freedom to Vote Act? That we 
would have a conversation in this 
empty Chamber that might even at-
tract a handful of Senators on both 
sides of the aisle to talk about the 
right to vote in America in the year 
2021 and beyond? 
That just seems so basic. 
Well, what the Republicans say is the 
Freedom to Vote Act is much more 
than just a debate topic; it is a Federal 
takeover of our elections. 
That simply is not the case. The 
Freedom to Vote Act does not create 
any undue burden on any State. In-
stead, it sets reasonable, minimum 
standards for voting access in all 
States, including automatic and same- 
day voter registration, 2 weeks of early 
voting, no-excuse mail-in voting. It es-
tablishes election day as a Federal hol-
iday. 
(Mr. PADILLA assumed the Chair.) 
All of these proposals are consistent 
with the clear language of the Con-
stitution. It will protect nonpartisan 
election officials from undue pressure 
and prevent politicians from over-
turning elections if they don’t agree 
with voters’ choices. 
The Freedom to Vote Act makes it 
harder for billionaires and powerful 
corporations to buy elections. Let’s be 
real honest, Members of Congress and 
others who run for office and set out to 
raise money, but the important fund-
raising is taking place in a mystery, in 
secret, with dark money that comes 
into an election with no indication of 
its source. 
The Freedom to Vote Act is going to 
prevent the flow of foreign money into 
U.S. elections. Is there anybody who 
wants to argue for the premise that we 
should allow foreigners to invest in our 
election results or to try to influence 
the electorate, sometimes with misin-
formation and outright lies? I don’t 
think they have any business inter-
fering in our elections. I think most 
Americans agree with that. That is 
what the Freedom to Vote Act says. 
In addition to that, dark money 
needs to get out of politics. If you want 
to stand up and support a candidate, so 
be it. But for goodness’ sake, say who 
you are; identify yourself; let the 
American people know who is pushing 
one candidate or the other. 
Organizations engaged in political 
spending will be required to tell the 
public who is giving them how much 
money. That is pretty simple, pretty 
obvious. There was a time when that 
level of disclosure was supported by the 
Republican minority leader in the Sen-
ate. I remember his speeches well on 
floor of the Senate. He shifted 180 de-
grees on the topic now. 
Last fall, 2020, Americans braved a 
pandemic to vote in record numbers, 
but supporters of the former President 
nonetheless exhausted legal challenges 
and recounts seeking to validate the 
outrageous lie of election fraud, and 
their efforts went nowhere. Former 
President Trump went to 50 or 60 dif-
ferent courts to argue that Joe Biden 
didn’t win the election. He couldn’t 
produce a shred of evidence. All he had 
were the ramblings and gossip and fake 
news, if you will, on the internet. It 
didn’t work. 
Rudy Giuliani came up with some 
hair-brained 
schemes 
on 
behalf 
of 
President Trump: ‘‘Italy-gate,’’ that 
somehow the Italians had satellites 
that controlled America’s voting ma-
chinery. Ridiculous things. 
When that didn’t work, the former 
President decided he would just take 
over the Department of Justice. Our 
Judiciary Committee, which I serve on, 
Mr. President, went into extensive in-
vestigation of that and came up with

detailed information, which we re-
leased to the public 2 weeks ago. And 
the Republicans were in on all of our 
investigation. They were invited to 
question the witnesses, to be present, 
to even see our majority report in ad-
vance. 
We wanted to make this bipartisan 
and fair, and we did. And what we 
found was the President’s failed at-
tempt to take over the Department of 
Justice—to force them to go to the 
States and say: Don’t validate the 2020 
election. 
A few people stood up and showed 
courage at the Department of Justice 
and said they were prepared to resign 
before they bent to President Trump’s 
pressure, and that was a fact. 
That is what we are faced with now— 
this former President still marketing 
his lies across America about the out-
come of the 2020 election, and we will 
not even take the time to discuss elec-
tions and voting. The Republicans will 
stop us with a filibuster. 
Many politicians in many States con-
tinue to use the Big Lie of the stolen 
election to try to make it harder for 
citizens to vote in future elections. 
According to the Brennan Center for 
Justice, 19 States passed 33 bills to 
make it harder for citizens to vote, so 
far this year. 
Hundreds of similar bills have been 
proposed in 49 States. These laws and 
proposals are a dagger at the heart of 
America’s democracy. 
The Freedom to Vote Act, which we 
want to start the conversation on, just 
the conversation and debate on tomor-
row, is America’s democracy defense 
act. 
I want to commend the bill’s spon-
sors: Senator AMY KLOBUCHAR. I don’t 
know anybody who has worked harder 
than she has as chair of the Senate 
Rules Committee; Senator MANCHIN, he 
has been involved in the compromise; 
Senators TIM KAINE, ANGUS KING, and 
Rev. RAPHAEL WARNOCK. 
And particularly I want to acknowl-
edge our majority leader, CHUCK SCHU-
MER, for his leadership in this effort. 
He has worked hard at it, trying to 
bring this matter before the American 
people and on the floor. 
We have also been engaged in a simi-
lar process on an equally critical piece 
of legislation, the John R. Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. 
I have been here long enough to re-
member a time when the Voting Rights 
Act came before the U.S. Senate and 
got 98 votes—virtually all the Demo-
crats, all the Republicans voted for it. 
No controversy. They believed that 
this product of the 1960s civil rights de-
bate was fair. It said that in certain 
States with a proven history of dis-
crimination against minority voters, 
when they proposed changes in election 
laws, we would examine them, preclear 
them, as they say. 
The Supreme Court tossed out that 
section, and we have tried to restore it. 
I think the Supreme Court was wrong 
and maybe even naive in believing that 
voter discrimination could not take 
place in the future. 
When there was a voter suppression 
law passed in North Carolina and it 
was taken to a Federal court, the court 
said, and I paraphrase: They worked 
with ‘‘surgical precision’’ to violate the 
voting rights of minority voters. 
The Freedom to Vote Act is the first 
of two crucial steps to take what our 
friend and colleague John Lewis said is 
a ‘‘precious, almost sacred’’ right, and 
I hope we take similar action on the 
Voting Rights soon. 
Like the Freedom to Vote Act, the 
Voting Rights Act extension that Ron-
ald Reagan signed in 1982 was the re-
sult of a compromise. In signing it, 
President Reagan said the final bill 
‘‘prove[d] that differences can be set-
tled in good will and good faith.’’ 
Wouldn’t that be nice to have that 
happen on this empty floor of the Sen-
ate tomorrow? That is all we ask of our 
Senate colleagues. Don’t use the fili-
buster, the weapon of Jim Crow, to 
abet the attacks we are seeing on 
Americans’ voting rights. 
Offer amendments if you like, but 
work with us in good will and good 
faith to protect the voting rights which 
so many have sacrificed for. 
INFLATION 
Mr. President, the Republican minor-
ity leader came to the floor a few min-
utes ago and once again spoke about 
inflation. And of course we are con-
cerned about it, and we are watching it 
closely. 
We are in an unusual place where we 
are recovering from a pandemic and 
the economy is getting back on its 
feet. And, yes, there are problems. We 
see supply chain problems addressed by 
President Biden just this week. We 
know things are stacked up trying to 
get into the United States. 
That was possibly unavoidable in the 
midst of a pandemic, when customer 
demand cratered, and now it is recov-
ering and our demand outstrips the 
supplies that are flowing into our coun-
try. 
But I also want to remind the Repub-
lican leader from Kentucky that his 
opposition to extend the debt ceiling, 
unfortunately, is also a problem when 
it comes to inflation. If there is uncer-
tainty as to whether this Nation will 
pay its just debts, obviously that will 
be reflected in the financial markets 
and higher interest rates. So the strat-
egy of Senator MCCONNELL, when it 
comes to the debt ceiling, is pro-infla-
tionary itself. 
Also, he talks about the ‘‘socialist 
spending spree’’ of the reconciliation 
bill, Build Back Better. And he says in 
critical terms that the Democrats 
argue that the cost of this will be ‘‘zero 
dollars.’’ He says that what Democrats 
don’t say is they have to impose mas-
sive tax hikes for this to happen. 
Well, I might say to the Senator from 
Kentucky, we have been very open 
about what our tax policy would be to 
pay for Build Back Better. 
That policy would say those making 
over $400,000 a year in income would 
have to pay higher taxes. Yes, we have 
said it. Those people would have to pay 
higher taxes. And corporations that are 
escaping their just tax liability would 
now have to pay their fair share, too. 
In those two instances, we are raising 
taxes, but the taxes don’t touch the 
working people in this country or those 
in lower income categories. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. President, he says—these are his 
words—Democrats are waging a war on 
affordable energy. I want to just reflect 
on the words ‘‘affordable energy.’’ It is 
true that we have ample energy re-
sources in most places in America, but 
to argue that they are affordable is to 
fail to take into account what the 
costs of climate change are in America 
and around the world. 
It is not affordable for us to have so 
many greenhouse gas emissions and 
fossil fuels that we are creating ex-
treme weather events all across the 
world. And we have seen them here in 
the United States. We have seen the 
fires in your State of California and in 
the Northwest; we have seen the flood-
ing all across the country, including 
the Midwest; we have seen violent 
weather occurring at times of the year 
when historically it never occurs; and 
we are paying a heavy price for climate 
change, global warming, and the fact 
that we are so dependent on fossil 
fuels. 
So when the Democrats—it used to 
be another bipartisan issue—and it no 
longer is—but when the Democrats 
sound the alarm about climate change 
and global warming, it is because cur-
rent energy sources are not affordable 
in terms of the future of our planet. We 
have to find a better way. 
I am sorry to see so many current 
politicians unable or unwilling to ac-
cept their responsibility to change this 
country and the world for the better 
and to leave an Earth, a planet, an en-
vironment that our kids can live in. I 
don’t think that is too much to ask, 
and I think we ought to do our part. 
IRS 
Mr. President, the last thing Senator 
MCCONNELL
went into this morning 
was giving new powers to the IRS to 
snoop. 
Well, I guess that is true in some re-
spects. We believe that people who owe 
taxes ought to pay them, and the vast 
majority of American families are hon-
est; they want to do their civic duty. 
They file their taxes on time and try to 
pay every penny they are supposed to— 
not more, but every penny they are 
supposed to. 
And yet there are many hiding their 
assets, hiding their profits, hiding their 
revenues, and hiding their money from 
the IRS. They should be held account-
able. 
Why should the average American 
family be held to a higher standard of 
honesty than the richest people in this 
country? I think it is only fair that ev-
eryone be held to the same standard.

SCHOOL BOARDS 
Mr. President, finally, I want to say 
this about a memorandum by the At-
torney General, Merrick Garland, that 
Senator MCCONNELL referred to earlier. 
He suggested that we are going after 
parents, that we want to somehow har-
ass, intimidate, and arrest parents who 
are appearing before school boards. 
I went back to read this memo-
randum. It is very explicit. 
Those who engage in violent conduct 
at school board meetings are going to 
be stopped. They are violating the law, 
and they are violating the spirit of 
those meetings where communities 
come together and decide the fate and 
future of public education. 
I think the Attorney General is right, 
we should have safety in that environ-
ment, just as we demand it here on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate—nothing more 
and nothing less. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as I begin 
this morning, let me just start by re-
acting to a couple of things that have 
been said here on the floor this morn-
ing already by my Democrat col-
leagues. 
You know, the leader, Republican 
leader, when he was down here earlier, 
talked about the impact of inflation on 
the economy, and I have to tell you, 
that is very real. The inflationary im-
pact is being felt all across this coun-
try. Energy costs are up, gasoline costs 
are up by huge amounts. Food costs are 
up in this country. Housing costs are 
up. 
There isn’t hardly any area of our 
economy where people aren’t being im-
pacted by inflation, meaning that the 
dollars that they earn are stretching 
less all the time. That is not a fake 
thing; it is not a temporary thing; it is 
a real thing. People are experiencing it 
in their economic lives on a daily basis, 
and to hear the Democratic leader say, 
well, you know, all the spending they 
are going to do is not going to cost 
anything, that it is going to be covered 
by tax increases and those tax in-
creases are just going to hit people in 
the higher income categories, also is 
something that just isn’t accurate. 
Now let me just for a minute suggest 
something that I think is sort of funda-
mental when it comes to economics, 
and that is, when you have too many 
dollars chasing too few goods, you get 
inflation. The demand for a product 
goes up, and when the demand goes up, 
the price usually follows along with it. 
Well, we have right now a lot of gov-
ernment dollars that have been swirl-
ing around the economy for some time, 
which is why I think in many respects 
we are seeing this inflation—the high-
est inflation that we have seen lit-
erally in 30 years in this country, af-
fecting, as I said earlier, kind of all 
sectors of the economy and things that 
people have to purchase in their daily 
lives. 
If you put more dollars out there, 
which is what is being talked about by 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues—another 
$3.5 trillion that would flood the econ-
omy—I think the expectation is a very 
real one that you are going to see that 
inflationary pressure accelerate, inten-
sify, because when you have that much 
money, that many dollars chasing too 
few goods, inflation is an inevitable re-
sult. The idea that we need to spend 
another $3.5 trillion and that somehow 
that is going to be a solution right now 
also is not consistent at all with the 
facts and the data. 
We saw here just recently the Con-
gressional Budget Office come out with 
a report that suggested that govern-
ment revenues are at the highest 
level—biggest increase, I should say, 
year over year since 1977. We are now 
over $4 trillion this last year in reve-
nues—$4 trillion. It has never happened 
before in this country. It is the biggest 
1-year increase in revenues since 1977, 
paid for largely by corporate tax re-
ceipts, which were up 75 percent year 
over year, and also by individual in-
come tax receipts, much of which was 
coming from high-income earners. A 
lot of that increase that we have seen 
in income tax receipts in this country 
in government revenues comes from 
those people who are high-income earn-
ers. 
All that to say, if you have that 
much revenue coming in to the govern-
ment in this country, why, then, would 
you need to go out and raise taxes even 
more and spend even more when you 
have an economy that is in the process 
of recovering and people concerned 
about inflation? And the Democrats’ 
solution to that is to spend more, put 
more money out there, and raise taxes 
even higher at a time when you have 
historic revenue coming in to the Fed-
eral Government. It is the first time 
ever—ever—in our Nation’s history 
that we have had over $4 trillion in rev-
enue come in. 
The other thing that was mentioned 
by my colleague from Illinois just a 
minute ago is that the issue of the tax 
gap, which was alluded to earlier this 
morning on the floor by, again, the Re-
publican leader—the Democratic solu-
tion is to go after people, essentially 
shake them down, and get them to pay 
more in taxes. 
I am not suggesting for a minute 
that there aren’t people out there who 
aren’t paying the taxes that they 
should under the law and that the law 
needs to be enforced. What I am sug-
gesting is that in the effort to close 
that so-called tax gap, there are huge 
differences of opinion about what effect 
that would have, how much could be 
generated, and who is ultimately going 
to pay for that. 
Well, now there is additional re-
search out coming from the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation that, in fact, the 
Democratic efforts to close the tax gap 
will hit lower income taxpayers the 
most. 
To say that none of the tax increases 
or none of the tax policies that are 
being proposed by the Democrats in 
their 
$3.5 
trillion 
tax-and-spending 
spree proposal won’t harm people who 
are making less than $400,000 a year is 
laughable under any—any—plausible 
review of these tax policies and pro-
posals, but this one in particular hits 
hardest at low-income taxpayers. 
According to the Joint Committee on 
Taxation, people making less than 
$50,000 a year will pay anywhere from 
40 to 57 percent off all the revenue that 
is generated off of that one proposal. 
People making less than $100,000 a year 
will pay somewhere between 65 and 78 
percent of all the taxes that are gen-
erated under that particular proposal 
in the Democratic plan. People making 
less than $200,000 a year would pay up 
to 90 percent of the amount generated 
under that particular proposal in the 
Democrats’ plan. So people making less 
than $200,000 a year are going to be 
paying tens of billions of dollars more 
in taxes just on that one proposal 
which is out there, allowing the IRS es-
sentially to snoop into people’s per-
sonal transactions up to the $600 level. 
I don’t think there is any way you can 
get around the fact that under that 
scenario, people in the lower income 
categories are going to end up paying 
the lion’s share of the cost of that. 
So this isn’t going to be without cost. 
This isn’t going to be without con-
sequence. This is not going to be with-
out impact on lower income taxpayers 
in this country. They are going to get 
hit and they are going to get hit hard 
under this Democratic proposal. 
So when we talk about it, we are 
talking about real impacts, real eco-
nomic impacts on the American peo-
ple’s lives. And we are going to con-
tinue to do everything we can to fight 
against really bad tax policies being 
put 
in 
place 
to 
finance 
massive 
amounts of spending, expansion, and 
growth of government at a time when 
government revenues just hit a historic 
high; never seen before; biggest year- 
over-year increase in revenue since 
1977. And Democrats want to raise 
taxes—taxes—on everybody, including 
those in the lower income categories. 
BORDER CRISIS 
Mr. President, the Biden border crisis 
continues unabated. In August, U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection en-
countered 208,887 people attempting to 
illegally cross our southern border, a 
318-percent increase from August of 
2020. Now, for context, that number is 
bigger than the population of Sioux 
Falls, SD, the largest city in my home 
State. 
At this point, ‘‘crisis’’ is too mild of 
a description. Things at the border are 
out of control, and there is little to 
suggest that things will improve any-
time soon as the Biden administration 
continues to permit an influx of mi-
grant entries and has sought to install 
appointees who have lax views about 
enforcing our immigration laws. 
In yet another sign of how bad things 
are, dozens of National Guard members 
from South Dakota recently deployed

to our southern border. I know these 
South Dakotans are always ready to 
serve wherever and whenever they are 
needed, and I am grateful for their 
service. 
You would think that the border cri-
sis would be at the top of the Demo-
crats’ priority list here in Washington, 
DC, particularly when they have to call 
in the National Guard from States 
around this country, but you would be 
wrong. In fact, the border crisis seems 
like barely a blip on the Democrats’ 
radar, and it is not the only crisis they 
are ignoring. 
Our national security situation is 
taking a giant step backward with the 
President’s 
disastrous 
Afghanistan 
withdrawal and the Taliban takeover 
of Afghanistan. Here at home, inflation 
is becoming a serious and a long-term, 
not a temporary, problem. Americans’ 
purchasing power is shrinking as they 
have to stretch their paychecks to 
cover increases in everything from the 
price of groceries to the high price of 
gasoline. 
But none of that really seems to mat-
ter to Democrats. Their main priority 
seems to be forcing through a $3.5 tril-
lion partisan tax-and-spending spree 
that would permanently expand the 
reach of government into Americans’ 
lives. 
Where to start when it comes to 
Democrats’ 
tax-and-spending 
spree? 
Well, there are tax hikes that would 
put American businesses at a disadvan-
tage on the global stage and shrink 
jobs and opportunities for American 
workers. There is a death tax expan-
sion that could put a lot of family 
farms 
and 
businesses 
in 
jeopardy. 
There are the major new entitle-
ments—free college, free preschool, 
subsidized daycare, paid leave. Yes, one 
of the major existing entitlement pro-
grams, Medicare, is rapidly heading to-
ward insolvency. Yet, instead of shor-
ing up that program, Democrats are ex-
panding entitlements and putting the 
government 
on 
the 
hook 
for 
an 
unsustainable level of spending. 
Then there are items that get less at-
tention, but they are just as troubling. 
Traditionally in the United States, in-
dividuals have picked the winners and 
losers through the free market, but the 
more you insert government into eco-
nomic and family life, the more gov-
ernment ends up being the one making 
the decisions. Government ends up 
picking the winners and the losers. 
Take the Democrats’ childcare ben-
efit. A 2020 Bipartisan Policy Center 
survey found that among working fam-
ilies who used center-based childcare, 
53 percent used a faith-based center—53 
percent. But now Democrats are com-
ing in with their childcare subsidies 
and in the process changing decades- 
old childcare funding programs to favor 
secular childcare providers who provide 
care at daycare centers. So if you are 
one of the 53 percent who chooses a 
faith-based provider for your child, you 
could be out of luck, not because you 
changed your childcare preferences but 
simply because Democrats have set up 
their benefit to favor secular center- 
based childcare providers. 
Democrats are repeating this pattern 
of picking winners and losers through-
out their bill. Labor unions win under 
this bill. Democrats have included a 
special benefit that would expressly 
allow union members to deduct their 
union dues on their taxes. Meanwhile, 
nonunion workers can expect to pay 
their usual tax bills. You only get spe-
cial privileges if you are a union mem-
ber. If you are one of the 90 percent of 
American workers who don’t belong to 
a union, then you are not going to see 
say help as they subsidize the dues of 
those who do belong to a union. I guess 
Democrats want to make sure that 
they get those union votes to come out 
at election time. 
Of course, that is not the bill’s only 
benefit for unions. There is funding for 
electronic voting systems for union 
elections and incentives to purchase an 
electric car from a union factory. 
Unions, of course, are not the only 
winner. Electric vehicle manufactur-
ers, for one, also win. The bill clearly 
endorses electric vehicles as the—the— 
climate change solution for the trans-
portation sector. Other clean energy 
technologies—notably, biofuels—take a 
back seat in this bill. 
I could go on all day when it comes 
to the spending priorities in this bill, 
like the fact that the bill dedicates 
more than $200 million—$200 million— 
to urban agriculture. That is right— 
urban agriculture. I am not saying that 
you can’t have a garden if you live in 
a city, but urban gardens are never 
going to produce the volume of food 
needed to feed our country, and anyone 
who thinks they will doesn’t know 
much about agriculture, which may be 
the problem here. 
Democrats’ tax-and-spending spree 
reads like the product of too much so-
cialist daydreaming and not enough 
time spent learning about how things 
like agriculture, energy, and econo-
mies actually work. Speaking of which, 
I haven’t mentioned the Democrats’ 
tree equity measure—yes, tree equity. 
Democrats have allowed $3 billion 
prioritized for what they recently re-
ferred to and have been referring to as 
tree equity. Now, I support and encour-
age planting trees, but I don’t think 
the Federal Government can afford to 
spend $3 billion on tree equity, espe-
cially when Democrats are planning to 
spend $200 million—yes, $200 million— 
for a park in House Speaker PELOSI’s 
district that features luxury housing 
and a golf course and provide tax bene-
fits for Ivy League universities and 
other well-funded colleges, including a 
new tax credit for higher education in-
stitutions for teaching ‘‘environmental 
justice’’ programs. 
Then there are the tax credits for 
electric bicycles—bicycles that can 
cost up to $8,000. It may be just me, but 
if you can afford an $8,000 bicycle, I am 
not sure you need a tax credit for it 
from the Federal Government. 
Then, of course, Democrats are plan-
ning to provide billions of dollars to 
fund a Civilian Climate Corps to pro-
vide government jobs for climate activ-
ists and $20 billion for the creation of a 
National Climate Bank to fund Demo-
crats’ pet environmental projects. 
Now, as you can see, this list goes on 
and on and on. The more you read the 
Democrats’ bill with its massive expan-
sion of government and historic tax 
hikes and its payoffs to liberal con-
stituencies, the more you realize that 
there is pretty much no area of life the 
Democrats think wouldn’t be better 
run by the Federal Government. 
But my fellow Republicans and I still 
believe in a vibrant, private economy, 
and in the right of individuals and fam-
ilies to run their lives as they see fit. 
So we will continue to oppose Demo-
crats’ social spending spree, and con-
tinue to fight to secure a future of 
prosperity, opportunity, and freedom— 
freedom—for each and every American. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I and Senator 
CORNYN be able to complete our re-
marks prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I just 
want my colleagues to know that the 
Senate Appropriations Committee, yes-
terday, released nine appropriations 
bills. 
They 
allocate 
important 
re-
sources and they help to address the 
pressing priorities of America’s fami-
lies and communities, but they also 
promote U.S. national security. 
For more than a decade, this country 
has underinvested in our children, in 
our infrastructure, in science, and in 
public health. Frankly, that means we 
underinvested in our future. 
These bills include historic increases 
to educate our Nation’s children, to 
combat climate change, promote af-
fordable 
housing, 
and 
improve 
healthcare. I am proud of the work of 
the committee in producing these bills, 
and I commend each of the sub-
committee chairs for their commit-
ment to America’s future. 
Now, the bills comply with the 
topline spending allocation contained 
in the fiscal year 2022 budget resolution 
passed by both the House and the Sen-
ate earlier this year. 
So you combine this with the three 
bills reported from the Appropriations 
Committee in August, the bills provide 
a 13-percent increase for nondefense 
discretionary programs and a 5-percent 
increase for defense programs com-
pared to what fiscal year 2021 enacted. 
The 5-percent increase for defense 
programs, that is consistent with the 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
NDAA, which was reported by the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee on an 
overwhelming bipartisan vote, and it 
passed the House last month again 
with overwhelming bipartisan support.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7044 
October 19, 2021 
The Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices, and Education bill makes long 
overdue investments to help care for 
and educate our Nation’s children, in-
cluding doubling the funding for Title 
I-A grants to local educational Agen-
cies. That program I mentioned is the 
foundation 
of 
Federal 
support 
to 
schools across this country. 
It also increases funding for the Child 
Care and Development Block Grant by 
23 percent, and Head Start by 11 per-
cent. We do this to provide high-qual-
ity childcare and education to working 
families across the Nation. 
It provides a 24-percent increase over 
last year for the Centers for Disease 
Control. That is done to strengthen 
U.S. public health infrastructure. We 
know we have to do that in the wake of 
a global pandemic that has created ter-
rible problems in that area. 
The Commerce, Justice, Science bill 
provides historic funding levels for the 
Department 
of 
Justice 
Violence 
Against Women Act programs. That is 
a 48-percent increase over the last fis-
cal year. It is the largest appropriation 
for the Violence Against Women Act 
since its creation. 
The Transportation, Housing, and 
Urban Development bill includes sig-
nificant increases to reduce homeless-
ness and improve housing conditions 
and increase affordability—something 
that touches all 50 of our States. 
The Interior bill includes significant 
resources to promote conservation, to 
preserve our natural infrastructure, 
and to protect our Federal lands. And 
we made climate change front and cen-
ter when drafting these bills, and each 
contains new and critical funding to 
help combat this challenge. 
For example, for the first time ever, 
we invested $54 million in a new Cli-
mate Conservation Corps; and we pro-
vide historic increases, 46 percent over 
last year, for EPA’s air and climate 
program. And, for the first time in 4 
years, the U.S. will contribute to the 
Green Climate Fund and the Clean 
Technology Fund, rejoining the inter-
national fight—it has to be an inter-
national 
fight—against 
climate 
change. We had a global retreat with 
the last President. The United States 
is standing up again and is back in the 
game. 
We also make historic investments in 
medical research. I don’t know any-
body who doesn’t want us to always 
improve our medical research. It en-
sures that America remains on the cut-
ting edge of advanced medical science 
and research. So we put a 6-percent in-
crease for the National Institutes of 
Health, and $2.4 billion to create the 
first ever Advanced Research Projects 
Agency for Health, and that is because 
of the President’s bold and promising 
proposal to accelerate the pace of 
breakthroughs in medicine. 
And, finally, the bills contain critical 
funding increases for mental and be-
havioral health services and to combat 
substance abuse—something that is a 
problem in every single State. These 
funds are desperately needed, as we saw 
the rates of anxiety and depression 
soar during the COVID–19 pandemic 
and drug overdose deaths are expected 
to reach their highest levels to date. 
Now, these are just some of the high-
lights of the important programs fund-
ed in the nine bills we released yester-
day. They make a real difference in the 
lives of millions of Americans, espe-
cially after the tough year and a half 
we faced with COVID–19. These bills 
demonstrate the good work we can do 
with a topline in fiscal year 2022 budget 
resolution, which was passed by the 
Senate and the House earlier this year. 
Now, I wish we could have followed 
regular order and done these bills in 
committee, but our Republican col-
leagues said they would prevent any 
additional consideration of bills until 
we have a negotiated topline. I cannot 
and will not allow that to stop our 
work. It would be irresponsible. We 
need to move the ball forward. In post-
ing these bills, we show the American 
people what we are for. 
Now, some on the other side of the 
aisle may characterize these bills as 
partisan. That is simply not true. In 
the spirit of comity and bipartisanship, 
which is the tradition of our Appro-
priations Committee, we worked hard 
to accommodate the funding priorities 
of all Members, both Democrats and 
Republicans. And the posted bills re-
flect that effort with many, many, 
many of the priorities of Republicans 
and many of the priorities of Demo-
crats. 
I am proud of the work of this com-
mittee in producing these bills, but our 
job is not done. The Federal Govern-
ment is existing under and operating 
under a continuing resolution only 
until December 3. Time can go by very 
quickly around here. Between now and 
then, it is imperative that we make 
progress on negotiating a topline—one 
that is bipartisan and bicameral—so we 
can enact these bills into law. 
I think we struck the right balance 
with the bills we produced and made 
public this week. As with everything in 
Congress, we rarely end where we 
begin. 
So I look forward to working with 
Chair 
DELAURO, 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER, and Vice Chairman SHELBY 
to move this process forward with the 
goal of enacting all 12 bills by Decem-
ber 3. 
If we fail to do that, then we face a 
long-term continuing resolution, which 
would lock in outdated spending prior-
ities that will not serve the American 
people, will not meet the challenges of 
today, and, unfortunately, will not 
contain those things that both Repub-
licans and Democrats have asked and 
were submitted and included in the 
bills that we have put in. 
I know that my friend and colleague 
from Texas is waiting to speak. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank 
my friend, the senior Senator from 
Vermont, for his courtesy. 
Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on 
the latest iteration of what has come 
to be known as the Democrats’ par-
tisan power grab over our elections 
conducted 
overwhelmingly 
by 
the 
States—actually, exclusively at the 
State and local level. 
The legislation that prompted this 
discussion first popped up in 2019, when 
the newly elected majority in the 
House went on a messaging bill spree. 
Over the last 2 years, they have tried a 
number of different marketing strate-
gies to convince the American people 
that this overhaul was needed. 
This latest version is proof that Con-
gress isn’t buying what they are sell-
ing, and that is for good reason. 
Those who were advocating for a na-
tional takeover of our State-run elec-
tions, at one point they said it was a 
matter of election security. Then they 
said this was designed to help restore 
voter confidence. Then they said this is 
a way to remove obstacles that pre-
vented people from voting. 
But facts are stubborn things. In 2020, 
we saw record turnout. Two-thirds of 
eligible voters cast a ballot, and that 
was the highest turnout in 120 years. 
I was on the ballot in 2020. The last 
time I had been on the ballot, 6 years 
previously, there were 4.8 million vot-
ers in Texas. In 2020, there were 11.3 
million voters in Texas. Compared to 
the 2016 Presidential election, 17 mil-
lion more Americans cast a vote, and 
we saw historic turnouts by Black, 
White, Asian, and Hispanic voters. 
So facts being stubborn things, clear-
ly it is time for the advocates for this 
Federal takeover to come up with a 
new sales pitch. So our Democratic 
friends 
attacked 
election 
integrity 
bills being passed by State legislatures, 
like Texas, all across the country. 
The Constitution itself gives States 
the power to determine how their elec-
tions should be run, and States are 
using that authority to make it easier 
to vote and harder to cheat. 
Our Democratic friends have tried to 
frame these new State laws as some-
how suppressing voting rights. As we 
have seen, if that is the objective, they 
certainly are doing a lousy job at it be-
cause people are voting in unprece-
dented numbers. 
Well, it is interesting to contrast 
some of the changes that our Demo-
cratic 
colleagues, 
including 
the 
Merrick Garland’s Department of Jus-
tice, comparing the reforms they have 
attacked and those that they believe 
are just fine. 
The Georgia law, which the Depart-
ment of Justice has sued under section 
2 of the Voting Rights Act, actually ex-
panded early voting in person to 17 
days. But if you live in Massachusetts, 
you can only vote for 11 days. I haven’t 
heard many complaints about the Mas-
sachusetts voting laws restricting peo-
ple’s access to the polls. And the Presi-
dent’s home State of Delaware, they

October 19, 2021 
don’t even offer in-person early voting, 
but they will in 2022. But even then, 
they are even more restrictive than 
Massachusetts. It will only be for 10 
days. 
So somehow a short period of early 
voting in Delaware is acceptable—actu-
ally, currently is not available but 
soon to be acceptable for 10 days—but 
17 days of early voting in Georgia is an 
assault on voting rights. Both cannot 
be true. 
Of course, our Democratic friends be-
lieve the only answer to this manufac-
tured assault is an unconstitutional, 
partisan power grab that they have 
been pushing for years, as I said. Well, 
the initial iteration of this came up for 
a vote in June, and it was sadly re-
jected, for good reason. The bill would 
have turned the bipartisan Federal 
Election Commission into a Democrat- 
controlled Commission. This is sup-
posed to be evenly split and non-
partisan, but that would change under 
the proposal that we voted on in June. 
It would have also allowed ballot har-
vesting—a dubious practice that is a 
recipe for mischief and wrongdoing, as 
a ballot could be harvested by paid 
campaign staffers, political operative, 
or anyone who had a stake in the out-
come of the election. Just go to your 
closest nursing home or community 
center, get people to sign a ballot, and 
harvest away. That would have been 
permitted. And, actually, prohibitions 
against ballot harvesting would have 
been prohibited under the Democrats’ 
bill. 
And 
the 
bill 
would 
have 
com-
mandeered States’ constitutional au-
thority to draw their own congres-
sional districts. The only thing this 
proposal would have done for the peo-
ple, as it is called, would be to help 
make sure that the outcome of vir-
tually every future election meant that 
Democrats win and Republicans lose; 
thus, Republicans would be relegated 
to a permanent minority status. That 
was the goal. 
If this bill weren’t so dangerous, it 
would have been laughable. Nobody 
would have taken it seriously. It is no 
surprise that the only thing bipartisan 
about this legislation is the opposition. 
In both the House and the Senate, Re-
publicans and Democrats voted against 
this legislation. 
Still, our Democratic colleagues—I 
admire their perseverance—they re-
fused to throw in the towel. They de-
cided to work on what they now call a 
compromise. 
Well, generally, a compromise indi-
cates that you have found common 
ground with somebody who holds a dif-
ferent view. But the so-called com-
promise bill we are scheduled to vote 
on tomorrow isn’t the result of nego-
tiations 
between 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats; it is a compromise between 
the left and the radical left. You really 
can’t call something a compromise 
when your negotiating partner is sit-
ting on the same side of the table with 
you. 
All this is done to create the illusion 
or a narrative that the partisan pieces 
have been stripped out of the bill and it 
now includes mainstream reforms. But 
that is far from the truth. 
Just like its predecessor, this bill 
seizes States’ constitutional authority 
to make decisions on matters like 
voter registration and early voting. It 
contains invasive disclosure require-
ments that would undermine citizens’ 
privacy and chill free speech. It places 
Federal standards on States for redis-
tricting, and threatens action from the 
Democratic-controlled Attorney Gen-
eral’s Office if those standards aren’t 
met. And it makes it harder to root out 
election fraud, and easier to cheat. 
If that is not bad enough, it also 
takes tax dollars from the American 
taxpayer and would require it be given 
to candidates for public office that 
those taxpayers disagree with. They 
call that public funding of elections. 
Nothing about the bill is a com-
promise. They may have stripped out 
some of the most outrageous provi-
sions, but certainly overtly partisan 
provisions remain. 
Republicans uniformly oppose the 
first attempt at this partisan power 
grab, and it is no surprise we will op-
pose this one as well. 
This is not a good-faith attempt to 
ensure our elections are secure from 
fraud and interference and accessible 
to all eligible voters. It is rather a po-
litical stunt and statement designed to 
mislead the American people and ap-
peal to the most radical members of 
the Democratic base. 
I am certainly not one to tell the ma-
jority leader how to do his job, but it 
seems like show votes ought to be pret-
ty low on our list of priorities. 
Our Democrat colleagues narrowly 
averted a debt crisis 2 weeks ago, and 
they have less than 2 months to figure 
out how to increase the debt ceiling 
and avoid an economic disaster. 
In the coming months, the Senate 
needs to do what has become an annual 
tradition, which is to pass the National 
Defense Authorization Act to give our 
troops the support they deserve and 
our 
commanders 
the 
predictability 
they need for the future. And we need 
to pass a full slate of appropriations 
bills to avoid a government shutdown 
just before the holidays. Those are the 
things we need to do, at a bare min-
imum. 
We should also be advancing legisla-
tion to avert—or to address the border 
crisis, which has been raging on since 
January. We need to reauthorize the 
Violence Against Women Act. We need 
to bring down sky-high drug prices, 
and approve accountability and trans-
parency in policing. 
There is a lot we should be doing to 
solve real problems that deserve action 
from the country and which our con-
stituents deserve as well. 
There is a strong appetite for bipar-
tisan work on both sides of the aisle, 
but the leadership of the Democratic 
Party has effectively stonewalled bi-
partisan legislating in favor of a com-
pletely partisan approach. It is really a 
head-scratcher. 
Our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
don’t 
have the kind of majorities that FDR 
had during the New Deal. We have a 50– 
50 Senate, with the Vice President as 
the tie-breaker. Common sense ought 
to tell you that that demands and re-
quires bipartisan legislating, not these 
kinds of show votes. 
We have a long list of tasks that are 
far more important than virtue sig-
naling. So I hope our colleagues will re-
evaluate the wisdom of this parade of 
partisan bills and spend time working 
with us to find where we have common 
ground, where we can actually pass leg-
islation and make a difference for our 
country. 
Until that time, we will continue to 
oppose partisan attacks on our Na-
tion’s elections and any other dam-
aging, 
politically 
motivated 
bills 
Democrats bring to the Senate floor. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, with regard 
to the comments of the esteemed Sen-
ator from Texas, I say to the Senator: 
I would suggest, if your colleagues are 
interested in election reform and elec-
tion laws, that we have a dialogue and 
that we have some discussion. I would 
welcome a proposal from your side of 
the aisle on election laws and how we 
deal with efforts to suppress the vote 
in other parts of the country, and also 
to change the Electoral Count Act. 
Is the Senator interested in those 
and entering into such discussions? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, if I may 
respond to the Senator from Maine. 
I am always interested in working on 
bipartisan bills and finding common 
ground. I think my record—and as the 
Senator knows, we have worked to-
gether on a number of things. The fun-
damental problem with our Democratic 
friends’ approach to election reform is 
they want to nationalize the election. 
They want to take the authority away 
from the States, which is clearly given 
to the States under the Constitution. 
But if we can take that off the table 
and talk about some other areas, we 
could work together in that area, I 
would be more than happy to work 
with my friend from Maine. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Mr. KING. Not to prolong the discus-
sion, but Article I, Section 4 of the 
Constitution 
makes 
it 
abundantly 
clear that the responsibility for elec-
tion administration is a joint one be-
tween the States and the Congress, and 
that the Congress, at any time, can 
alter regulations or the efforts to con-
trol the vote in a particular State. 
That has been true ever since the 
drafting of the Constitution. It was 
true at the time of passage of the 15th 
Amendment. It was true at the time of 
the passage of the Voting Rights Act.

NOMINATION OF CHRISTINE P. O’HEARN 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
today I rise in support of the confirma-
tion of Ms. Christine O’Hearn to the 
U.S. District Court for the District of 
New Jersey. I was proud to recommend 
Ms. O’Hearn for this nomination. She 
has the qualifications, intellect, and 
the temperament necessary to make an 
excellent and impartial Federal judge, 
and I am confident that she will serve 
the U.S. District of New Jersey well. 
A proud South Jersey native, Ms. 
O’Hearn was born in Camden, grad-
uated from the University of Delaware, 
and earned her juris doctor from Tem-
ple University’s Beasley School of Law 
in Philadelphia. She is an expert in em-
ployment and labor law who has 
worked on behalf of both employers 
and workers during her impressive ca-
reer. 
She is currently a partner at the firm 
of Brown & Connery in Westmont, NJ, 
where she is highly regarded by her 
colleagues for her keen insight and 
confident command of the issues at 
hand in every case she takes on. Twice 
she was named one of the Top 40 attor-
neys under 40 in New Jersey. She has 
also been featured in New Jersey Law 
Journal’s ‘‘Women and Minorities in 
the Profession.’’ Ms. O’Hearn also pre-
viously served as an adjunct professor 
at Rutgers University School of Law in 
Camden. 
In 2020, Ms. O’Hearn was appointed to 
the U.S. Magistrate Judge Selection 
Committee and has served on various 
distinguished boards, including the 
New Jersey State Committee of the 
American College of Trial Lawyers and 
the New Jersey Court’s District IV 
Ethics Committee. 
And this year—this gives you an in-
sight of the person that she is beyond 
her competence and capability and in-
tellect—she has spent more than 85 
hours volunteering as a pro bono attor-
ney for newly arriving Afghan refugees 
in Fort Dix, NJ, informing them of 
their rights and helping them navigate 
our complicated immigration laws. She 
described this work as immensely ful-
filling and humbling, and I hope it in-
spires others in the legal profession to 
lend a hand to the nationwide refugee 
resettlement effort. 
Ms. O’Hearn’s professional creden-
tials, combined with her compassion 
and commitment to the fair and impar-
tial administration of justice, will 
make her an outstanding judge. 
Finally, I would like to remind my 
colleagues that the U.S. District of 
New Jersey is one of the busiest courts 
in all of America. As of last year, more 
than 46,000 cases were pending before 
it, many of them among the most com-
plex and challenging cases in the Na-
tion. 
Yet multiple vacancies on the court 
have left its seated judges with some of 
the highest caseloads in the country, 
prompting the Judicial Conference of 
the United States to declare them judi-
cial emergencies. 
Now, we have made some encour-
aging progress on that front in recent 
months. However, the people of New 
Jersey deserve nothing less than a 
fully staffed district court, not to men-
tion all of the parties with business 
pending before it. 
I am confident that Ms. O’Hearn’s ex-
perience and intellectual rigor will be 
an asset to the U.S. District Court of 
New Jersey, and I urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to join me in 
support of her swift confirmation. 
I yield the floor.

VOTING RIGHTS 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
rise today in defense of the most sacred 
right we have in this country, and that 
is the right to vote. This right is funda-
mental to our democracy. It is the 
right to make your voice heard in our 
government. 
But this right is under attack by ul-
traconservative State lawmakers who 
are restricting access to our ballot 
boxes—the same people who continue 
to cast unserious, faceless and dan-
gerous doubts on the results of the 2020 
election. 
I am not being hyperbolic when I say, 
if these attacks succeed, there will be 
grave consequences for our democratic 
system not just in those States, but 
throughout our country. 
So as I have said time and again, we 
must pass strong Federal voting rights 
protections into law, because doing so 
is essential to making sure that our de-
mocracy stays a democracy. Democrats 
are rightfully exploring every potential 
avenue to ensure Americans’ funda-
mental right to vote is not restricted. 
We are voting on legislation this 
week—the Freedom to Vote Act—that 
has been the result of extended nego-
tiations and discussions. And I appre-
ciate all my colleagues who are work-
ing to craft a bill all of us can agree to, 
one that ensures that voters have equal 
access to the ballot box; that promotes 
best practices for voter registration 
and administration; and protects our 
elections from the very real threat of 
interference, both foreign and domes-
tic. 
This is a reasonable bill by any 
stretch of the imagination. And I chal-
lenge anyone to tell me what could be 
more controversial about making elec-
tion day a public holiday or ensuring 
everyone has the opportunity to vote 
early, making sure everyone can re-
quest a vote-by-mail ballot. 
These are simple measures to ensure 
that every American’s voice can be 
heard. And I am glad that this bill in-
cludes protections so it will help give 
power back to the people in our govern-
ment, making sure people pick their 
representatives rather than representa-
tives picking their voters; by stopping 
special interest money from drowning 
out Americans’ voices and votes; and 
by protecting and securing each Amer-
ican citizen’s right to cast their ballot. 
Again, nothing in this bill should be 
controversial if you care about the 
health of our democracy. So I hope our 
Republican colleagues will join us in 
supporting it, because I strongly be-
lieve protecting every American’s right 
to vote should not be a partisan issue. 
And my Republican colleagues will 
have a chance this week to inspire con-
fidence in our elections and make sure 
they are secure by voting for this com-
monsense legislation. 
But if there are some who want to 
stand between voters and their due 
right to the ballot box, we cannot, as 
public servants, simply throw up our 
hands and say: Oh, well, we tried. 
So Republicans choose to look the 
other way on implementing Federal 
voting rights protections because voter 
suppression tactics might benefit them 
politically. 
Democrats must use every legislative 
tool needed to get the Freedom to Vote 
Act to President Biden’s desk, includ-
ing an exemption to the filibuster, be-
cause, as I have said, of all the critical 
things we will vote on this Congress— 
and many are so important to our 
workers and families—this is the most 
important. It is about the future of our 
democracy. 
And if our Republican colleagues are 
not willing to stand up for our democ-
racy, we can’t let them hide behind 
Senate rules and block Democrats from 
doing so on our own. The stakes are 
really simply too high to fail. One way 
or another, this Senate has to pass the 
Freedom to Vote Act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
ENERGY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
what Americans are talking about all 
across the country, and that is the fact 
that energy prices are rising and doing 
it dramatically. 
Energy is called a master resource 
for a reason. It powers our commu-
nities, our homes, our military, and 
our economy. It fuels the trucks that 
bring goods and groceries to market. It 
keeps the lights on at small businesses 
all across the country, and it heats our 
homes. This is the reason why higher 
energy prices mean higher prices in 
every other part of our life. 
Now, over the last 9 months, people 
have been seeing this all across the 
country. Energy prices have gone up, 
and not just by a little. They have gone 
up a lot. It has contributed to higher 
prices for just about everything we do 
and everywhere we go. 
The cost of a tank of gas is about a 
dollar higher now than it was when Joe 
Biden came into the White House. As a 
result, if you go to fill up at your local 
gas station, it is about $25 more to fill 
your tank today than it was back in 
January, on the 20th, when Joe Biden 
took the oath of office. 
Now, it is not just gasoline that has 
gone up; it is the gas we use to heat our 
homes. Natural gas powers over half of 
the homes that are heated across 
America. And the price is now at a 7- 
year high. So as a result, families are 
going to pay a lot more not just to 
drive, but also to heat their homes this 
winter. 
And it is interesting because here in 
America, we have the energy resources 
we need; we are just not able to use 
them because of this administration. 
Under the last administration, Amer-
ica became the largest producer of oil 
and natural gas in the world—in the 
world—America. 
America’s 
energy 
dominance worked to help us reduce 
our trade deficit. It brought home more 
jobs, brought industries home to Amer-
ica. It fueled the best economy in my 
lifetime here at home in America. And 
as a nation, we became energy inde-
pendent for the first time in 70 years. 
Well, these were historic achieve-
ments by America’s energy workers. In 
my home State, the State of Wyoming 
was proud to play a major role in these 
achievements. Wyoming is America’s 
No. 1 per-capita exporter of energy. We

produce it in Wyoming, and we send it 
around the country and around the 
world. We power America and we power 
the world. 
Yet, ever since Joe Biden became 
President, it has become a lot harder. 
Now, I talk to energy workers at home 
all of the time in Wyoming, all across 
the State, and what they continue to 
tell me is it has never been more dif-
ficult than it is right now. In just 9 
months, Joe Biden has already become 
the most anti-American energy Presi-
dent in our Nation’s history. 
On his first day in office, he drew a 
target on the back of American petro-
leum energy, and he pulled the trigger. 
He killed the Keystone XL Pipeline, 
and that ended thousands of good-pay-
ing jobs at the height of a pandemic. 
President Biden also shut down oil and 
gas exploration near the Arctic. He 
banned oil and gas leasing on Federal 
land. 
This has been devastating to Western 
States: Wyoming, Colorado, Nevada, 
and New Mexico. 
Nearly half of Wyoming is Federal 
land, and now Joe Biden says that land 
is off limits to Wyoming energy work-
ers. 
Because of Joe Biden’s radical anti- 
energy agenda, people in every corner 
of this country are paying higher 
prices for energy. We are paying more 
at the pump, paying more at the gro-
cery store—paying all around. 
Even one of the Democrats’ favorite 
economists, Mark Zandi, says the 
American people are now paying $175 
more every month—$175 every month— 
more than they were a year ago. That 
includes gas, groceries, rent. Joe Biden 
inflation—it is equivalent to $2,100 a 
week. That is a heck of a paycheck cut 
for American workers. 
So who gets hurt by this? 
Well, it is struggling families. It is 
seniors. It is people living on a fixed in-
come. 
Polls show that about half of the 
country lives paycheck to paycheck. 
Forty percent of the country says they 
couldn’t afford to cover an emergency 
if the cost were above $400. 
Well, in the Joe Biden economy, peo-
ple 
are 
paying 
five 
times 
that 
amount—the amount they can’t handle 
for an emergency—just in the cost of 
annual inflation. 
The Biden White House doesn’t seem 
to care very much about it, doesn’t un-
derstand it—clueless. Last week, the 
White House Chief of Staff retweeted a 
message which said inflation is a ‘‘high 
class problem.’’ 
He couldn’t be more wrong. If the 
White House believes this, they are 
woefully—woefully—at a loss for un-
derstanding what is happening in this 
country, because what is happening is 
exactly the opposite of what the White 
House thinks. The White House Chief 
of Staff clearly doesn’t understand the 
struggles of working families all across 
this country. 
Now, the big Democrat donors in 
CHUCK
SCHUMER’s Brooklyn, NY, or 
NANCY
PELOSI’s San Francisco—they 
are going to be just fine. It is the work-
ing families in rural America who are 
getting hurt the most. 
And as winter is coming, energy 
costs are going to go up significantly. 
The U.S. Energy Information Adminis-
tration—branch of the government— 
says energy bills will be up dramati-
cally this winter compared to last. 
This inflation nightmare is abso-
lutely at a point where there is still no 
end in sight. The American people be-
lieve it is going to continue and it is 
going to get worse. 
Democrats have finally been hit with 
the reality that people are worried 
about the high cost of energy. So what 
have they decided to do about it? What 
will the White House do about it? What 
will the administration do about it? 
Astonishingly, in August, the Na-
tional Security Advisor begged Russia 
and OPEC and the oil cartel to pump 
more oil. It is hard to believe that real-
ly happened. It is also hard to believe— 
my friend and colleague the senior Sen-
ator from Alaska told us in the Energy 
Committee that the United States is 
using more oil from Russia than we are 
from Alaska right now. 
If you don’t believe it in terms of the 
fact that the administration is asking 
OPEC and Russia to produce more oil 
to help lower the costs in the United 
States, just go to the White House 
website. They put it on the White 
House website. 
Joe Biden would rather buy energy 
from our enemies and send American 
dollars overseas than produce it here at 
home. He would rather send American 
dollars overseas to our enemies than 
explore for American energy and the 
resources that we have, where we have 
the capacity to lead the world. 
Last week, the Biden administration 
made an off-the-record call to U.S. en-
ergy-producing companies. The admin-
istration had the nerve to ask them to 
lower their prices at the same time 
that this administration has forced 
them to lower their production. It is 
economics 101: supply and demand. It is 
basic arithmetic. 
And now the Energy Secretary says 
that we might have to use the Stra-
tegic Petroleum Reserve to try to 
bring more energy onto the market to 
help deal with the costs that have gone 
up as a result of the Biden policies. We 
went to the Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve during the first Iraq war and 
after Hurricane Katrina and during the 
Arab Spring. In other words, this is 
something we do in a crisis. 
The Biden administration won’t say 
it out loud yet, but let’s admit it; there 
is a crisis, and it is one that Joe Biden 
and this administration have created. 
It is a crisis of Joe Biden’s own mak-
ing, and it is a crisis that Joe Biden 
could end tomorrow because we have 
the capacity at home to do it. 
Instead, what are the Democrats 
doing? Well, they are threatening to 
make it even worse. Democrats in the 
Senate are pushing a $3.5 trillion reck-
less 
tax-and-spending 
spree. 
Last 
month, one Commissioner of the FERC, 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission, told us at the Energy Com-
mittee that to pass this $3.5 trillion 
bill would be ‘‘like an H-bomb’’ on 
America’s energy markets. That is be-
cause the bill contains huge portions of 
what has become known to be the dis-
astrous ‘‘green bad deal.’’ 
Here are just a few of the examples 
that are included in this $3.5 trillion 
Democratic bill in the House right 
now: $8 billion for a so-called Civilian 
Climate Corps. These are taxpayer- 
funded climate police. They will get 
free housing, free clothing, free college 
tuition, free childcare to go out and po-
lice the environment based on the cli-
mate. 
The Democrat spending spree also in-
cludes $10 billion for what the Demo-
crats call environmental justice in 
higher education. The bill includes $105 
billion for what the Democrats call cli-
mate justice and then green energy 
subsidies. 
Let’s take a look at the subsidies. 
These subsidies include huge subsidies 
for people who buy and drive electric 
vehicles. And who buys and drives elec-
tric vehicles? Basically, people with 
lots of income, not the average Amer-
ican. The government is already giving 
billions of taxpayer dollars to electric 
vehicle 
manufacturers 
and 
owners. 
Nearly 80 percent of the tax credits go 
to households making at least $100,000 
a year. That is who this administration 
is beholden to. The spending spree 
would give up to $12,500 to married cou-
ples to buy electric vehicles. A single 
person earning up to $400,000 a year 
could get a subsidy. A married couple 
earning up to $800,000 a year could get 
a subsidy. 
Now, how are the Democrats going to 
pay for all these things, all these hand-
outs? Well, they want to put more 
taxes on producing natural gas. What 
is that going to do to the average per-
son trying to heat their home this win-
ter? It is going to raise natural gas 
prices even higher. Oh, and at the same 
time, we would eliminate 90,000 Amer-
ican energy jobs. It is going to raise en-
ergy costs for people all across the 
country. 
The administration’s answer is the 
last thing we need in this country right 
now. We in this country have the best 
energy resources in the world. We also 
have the best energy workers in the 
world. It is time to let these good men 
and women do their jobs. American 
people don’t need trillions of dollars 
more in taxes and spending and debt. 
We need more American energy. It is 
time for Joe Biden and the Democrats 
to get out of the way of affordable 
American energy. The people of this 
country need it badly. 
I yield the floor.

October 19, 2021 
law enforcement officers. This past 
weekend, Americans here in our Na-
tion’s Capital and around the country 
participated in National Police Week-
end. 
Being a law enforcement officer is 
one of the toughest and most dan-
gerous jobs that there is. I think people 
on both sides of the aisle in this Cham-
ber would agree with that. Law en-
forcement officers serve as a boundary 
between a functioning society and a 
lawless one. And, sadly, during the 
course of their vital duty to serve and 
protect our communities, some pay the 
ultimate price. 
Alabama has lost four individuals in 
the line of duty to date this year: Dep-
uty Sheriff William H. Smith, of the 
Baldwin County Sheriff’s Office; Police 
Officer Marquis Dewon Moorer, of the 
Selma Police Department; Corrections 
Officer Maurice ‘‘Reese’’ Jackson, of 
the Robertsdale Police Department; 
Sergeant Nick Risner, of the Sheffield 
Police Department. 
And our State has lost five individ-
uals this year from COVID: Lieutenant 
Jeff Bain, of the DeKalb County Sher-
iff’s Office; Police Officer Juan Manuel 
Gomez-Lopez, of the Pelham Police De-
partment; 
Deputy 
Sheriff 
Harry 
‘‘Buddy’’ Hutchinson, of the Blount 
County Sheriff’s Office; Police Officer 
Brandon Ard, of the Orange Beach Po-
lice Department; Investigator Richard 
Wendell Humphrey, of the Baldwin 
County District Attorney’s Office. 
These nine individuals deserve our 
honor. They got out of bed each morn-
ing, put their uniform on, and went to 
work for our communities across this 
country. 
To their friends and families, thank 
you for your sacrifice. It is a tough 
task, loving and supporting someone 
who goes to work each day, putting 
their life on the line to protect people 
they don’t even know. They know only 
that they are fellow Americans. 
And to every Alabamian who wears a 
badge and a uniform, thank you for all 
you do for our communities. 
It is an unfortunate truth that many 
officers are being driven out of their 
profession by a wave of anti-police 
rhetoric on the heels of bad actors who 
operated outside their training. The 
Biden administration had jumped at 
every opportunity to demonize and de-
mean the entire law enforcement pro-
fession. The President has shown that 
if the optics are bad enough, law en-
forcement will pay. 
This was the case with Border Patrol 
agents on horseback in the Del Rio 
Sector in Texas just a few weeks ago. 
Reports of the agents whipping people 
turned out to be completely and ut-
terly false. 
We shouldn’t be surprised. When 
their policies have failed and created 
chaos, the Biden administration has 
had a choice between doing what is 
right and making our government 
work better or shaming those expected 
to do more with less. The Biden admin-
istration has always chosen the latter. 
The administration routinely chooses 
to hide behind platitudes and broken 
promises instead of addressing the cri-
ses of their own making. 
And 
because 
of 
that, 
the 
con-
sequences of this administration’s il-
logical and inconsistent policies will be 
felt by Americans for decades. If we 
didn’t think it could get even worse, 
this administration’s weak border poli-
cies impact every aspect of our Na-
tion’s immigration system. 
But the problems go far beyond the 
crisis we have seen unfold over the last 
9 months at the southwest border. Just 
last week, Department of Homeland 
Security Secretary Mayorkas issued 
guidance ending worksite enforcement 
operations, which is the authority the 
U.S. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement, better known as ICE, uses 
to crack down on businesses who em-
ploy illegal immigrants and to process 
illegal immigration workers for re-
moval. 
Without the threat of removing ille-
gal workers, this new guidance creates 
a pull factor, or a magnet, attracting 
more people to the United States 
through illegal means. Illegal immi-
grants come with the knowledge that 
the consequences for breaking our laws 
under President Biden is minimal or 
nonexistent. 
But this is a departure from what 
Democrats used to think. In 2005, then- 
Senator Barack Obama said: 
We simply cannot allow people to pour into 
the 
United 
States 
undetected, 
undocu-
mented, unchecked, and circumventing the 
line of people who are waiting patiently, dili-
gently, and lawfully to become immigrants 
in this country. 
In 2009, Senator CHUCK SCHUMER said: 
Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and 
simple . . . people who enter the United 
States without permission are illegal aliens 
and illegal aliens should not be treated the 
same as people who enter the U.S. legally. 
And then, in 2006, then-Senator Joe 
Biden said: 
Let me tell you something, folks, people 
are driving across that border with tons, 
tons—hear me, tons—of everything from by-
products from [drugs] to cocaine to heroin, 
and it’s all coming up through corrupt Mex-
ico. 
So why the change? It is politics. 
They are bending to the pressure from 
the far left to abandon enforcement of 
our laws in this country. And just look 
where it got us. How about the allega-
tions of poor living conditions, ramp-
ant COVID–19 infection, and sexual 
misconduct 
between 
unaccompanied 
alien children and Federal contractors 
at Department of Health and Human 
Services housing facilities? 
Nearly 2 weeks ago, I sent a letter to 
the Secretary of the Department of 
Health and Human Services regarding 
the countless reports of mistreatment 
of unaccompanied minors while in 
Health and Human Services custody 
until released to a parent or legal 
guardian. 
Because our country continues to 
face public health emergencies brought 
on by the COVID–19 pandemic, Presi-
dent Biden kept title 42 in place at the 
border except for one piece. He made a 
huge politically driven exception: Un-
accompanied children could be admit-
ted regardless of public health emer-
gency. This decision led to an on-
slaught of unaccompanied minors ar-
riving at the border. 
This administration has been so con-
sumed by ensuring that the President 
receives constant good press that they 
rushed tens of thousands of children 
through processing facilities and into 
the hands of adults who hadn’t under-
gone background checks. What is more 
is Health and Human Services failed to 
conduct background checks on the con-
tractors working at the housing facili-
ties where unaccompanied minors stay 
before being released to parents. 
The administration repeatedly cut 
corners and endangered the lives of 
children just so they could provide pic-
tures of empty Customs and Border 
Protection processing facilities to the 
press. 
At every turn, it has been about 
headlines over sound policy, and it has 
backfired. That is absolutely no way to 
go. 
Oh, and by the way, I have yet to re-
ceive a response from Health and 
Human Services Secretary Becerra on 
my questions. It has been weeks. 
Now there are reports of yet another 
memo coming out of DHS, one that 
would protect those who acquired U.S. 
citizenship by fraud. 
U.S. citizenship is the most valuable 
status that we have in this country, 
and it is coveted all around the world. 
It is the reason millions of people im-
migrate to the United States every 
year and have done so for many, many 
generations. They come here with the 
hope to capitalize on the opportunities 
that this country provides, the free-
doms and liberties afforded to its citi-
zens. 
Allowing people to be naturalized 
through fraudulent methods devalues 
our sacred privilege. It cheapens the in-
herent principles of our great country. 
I sincerely hope the administration 
will not actually consider such a dras-
tic change in policy. But based on what 
we have seen so far, I wouldn’t be sur-
prised. 
By the end of 2021, Customs and Bor-
der Protection will have apprehended 
nearly 2 million people attempting to 
illegally cross into the United States. 
July and August each saw apprehen-
sions of up to 200,000 per month. 
Folks, that is astounding. That is 2 
million people who decided the dan-
gerous journey through South and Cen-
tral America was worth the risk to ille-
gally enter the United States through 
our southwest border, rather than to 
adhere to the laws and regulations we 
instituted for legal means of immigra-
tion. 
These numbers negatively impact the 
U.S. job market and our economy. 
They put a burden on the taxpayer 
through increased spending of Federal 
benefits. These numbers overwhelm—

October 19, 2021 
and I am talking ‘‘overwhelm’’—our 
public schools and our hospitals, which 
are already maxed out. 
Also, wide open borders are also an 
issue of national security, and you can 
bet that the longer the border remains 
open, the more drugs make their way 
into the United States. Customs and 
Border Protection has seized over 10,000 
pounds of fentanyl this year, more 
than the last 3 years combined. Imag-
ine the amount of illicit drugs Presi-
dent Biden’s open border policy have 
added to our opioid epidemic. 
And while the U.S. economy con-
tinues to suffer due to the actions 
taken by the Biden administration in 
response to COVID, the cartel economy 
is booming. 
Earlier this year, CBP estimated the 
cartels make about an average of $14 
million per day smuggling people and 
drugs into the United States. The car-
tels are running a multibillion-dollar 
business along our border, and the 
President is just letting it happen. 
Never before have we experienced il-
legal immigration on this scale, and it 
can all be tracked back to the bad pol-
icy decisions of this President. 
U.S. law allows for legal immigra-
tion, as well as pathways to work with-
in the U.S. economy. When we allow 
people to continuously break our laws, 
we should not be surprised when more 
people join in. We should not be sur-
prised when our laws no longer carry 
weight or authority in our country. 
The fact that this administration is 
not only disregarding current law and 
regulation but actively advertising 
ways around them is incredible. It is 
lawless. 
President Biden, or whoever in the 
White House is making these decisions, 
should be ashamed of themselves, put-
ting people’s lives in danger. The Presi-
dent could stop this today if he wanted 
to, but reverting to the policies put in 
place by the Trump administration 
would be an admission that those poli-
cies actually worked. 
We should all pray that when the 
consequences of these bad policies 
trickle 
down 
to 
our 
communities 
across this country, our law enforce-
ment officers are still there to clean up 
President Biden’s senseless mess. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2997 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 2997, which is at the desk. 
Further, I ask unanimous consent that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 
reserving the right to object, the Sen-
ator will speak further about what he 
is attempting to do, but I want to 
make it clear, first of all, that this bill 
isn’t about protecting access to food 
assistance for moms and babies or en-
suring children continue to receive 
healthy school meals. This actually is, 
unfortunately, a bill that is in search 
of a problem. 
And if my colleague Senator SCOTT 
wants to work with me on eliminating 
barriers to access to SNAP or the WIC 
Program or school meals, I would be 
more than happy to work with him on 
it. 
But let me just say this: This bill, 
again, is in search of a problem because 
there is no rule requiring vaccinations 
for families to receive food assistance, 
and no one in the administration is 
proposing that. 
So let me just say that again: There 
is no rule requiring vaccinations for 
families to receive food assistance, and 
no one in the administration is pro-
posing that. 
So if we want to work together on 
how to support families in our country 
to help make sure children have the 
healthy food that they need in schools, 
that is terrific. But rather than spend-
ing time on bills like this, we should be 
encouraging people to get vaccinated 
to protect their families, protect them-
selves, and protect their community. 
But this bill addresses something 
that is just not real nor will it be real. 
And so I would object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, this time last year, we still didn’t 
know how much longer this pandemic 
would last. We didn’t know when the 
vaccine trials would be completed. 
Thankfully, by December, the vaccine 
had been approved and brought nor-
malcy back to the lives of many Amer-
icans. 
The 
Trump 
administration 
worked with public and private part-
ners, doctors and scientists across our 
country to develop a safe and effective 
vaccine in record time. It was a feat of 
science, and it was an example of what 
Americans can do when we are working 
together. 
I had COVID, and I am grateful that 
I was able to get vaccinated. I hope 
that all Americans talk with their doc-
tors and consider making the same de-
cision. It is a personal decision every 
individual gets to make. 
That is not how President Biden sees 
it. Lately, the Biden administration 
has decided to try and take this deci-
sion out of the hands of the American 
people. With this recently announced 
unconstitutional vaccine mandate for 
private businesses, King Biden again is 
saying that government knows best 
and has taken choice away from fami-
lies in Florida and across the country. 
That is not what the American peo-
ple expect government to do. Govern-
ment’s role is to give Americans all the 
information and data it has so they can 
make the right decision for their indi-
vidual family. 
That is exactly what I did when I was 
Governor of Florida. In the face of life- 
threatening hurricanes, I made sure 
Florida families were informed. I went 
out and made sure everyone knew ex-
actly what to expect and how dan-
gerous the storm could be, but I didn’t 
issue mandates because that is not 
what governments should do. 
When I was Governor of Florida, we 
had the Zika healthcare crisis, which 
impacted newborns. Rather than plac-
ing mandates on pregnant women or 
restricting their travel to areas with 
local transmission of Zika, we simply 
informed Floridians, worked to be as 
transparent as possible, and offered 
free Zika testing to all pregnant 
women in Florida. 
But, again, that is not the approach— 
that is not the approach—Joe Biden 
has decided to take. President Biden 
has decided that threatening corpora-
tions and businesses and misleading 
the American people is a better option. 
It is dishonest and authoritarian, and 
it is no way to lead a nation. Ameri-
cans should be free to make choices 
they feel are in the best interests of 
their own health and the health of 
their loved ones. 
In December, President Biden prom-
ised he would not require Americans to 
be vaccinated or require that they 
carry vaccine passports. But here he is, 
less than 10 months into his Presi-
dency, breaking promise after promise 
and going back on his word. 
How can the American people believe 
anything he says? Americans are sick 
and tired of the government telling 
them what to do and are more than ca-
pable of making the right choices to 
protect themselves, their family, and 
their neighbors. 
But even as there are some of us in 
this Chamber who disagree about na-
tional vaccine mandates for private 
businesses, I wanted to try to find 
some common ground. Food stamps, 
supplemental assistance for women, in-
fants, and children, and free and re-
duced lunch programs are programs 
run through the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture and provide food to hungry 
families and are some of the most basic 
of programs our government provides 
to those in need. 
For kids who are at school and who 
come from families who are struggling, 
I am saying you shouldn’t have to be 
vaccinated in order to eat. Or for fami-
lies who have trouble putting enough 
food on the table, I am saying you 
shouldn’t have to be vaccinated to get 
groceries. 
I wish—I hoped—my colleague would 
agree. I offered a simple bill to say that 
families who need food stamps and ad-
ditional support for women, infants,

and children shouldn’t have to be vac-
cinated in order to have a full stomach. 
I was a poor kid growing up. My par-
ents struggled to put food on the table, 
but my colleague is telling families 
like mine growing up that they don’t 
care about their personal choices: If 
you want to be able to eat, you have to 
get a shot. 
This is ridiculous. This is un-Amer-
ican. This is an attempt by President 
Biden to take over every aspect of your 
life. I am not going to stand for it. The 
American people are not going to stand 
for it. 
I hope every household in America 
sees what happened on the floor today. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to talk about two things 
as we are waiting for Senator WYDEN. 
First, I have been hearing all across 
the State of Florida, people are really 
concerned about the Democratic pro-
posal basically to look at everybody’s 
bank accounts. 
The latest is that the proposal will 
take it from looking at every $600 
transaction or $600 account to $10,000. 
Well, if you look at it, almost every-
body has a $10,000 account because 
what they are talking about is cumu-
lative dollars. 
So why does the IRS want to look at 
everybody’s accounts? 
It is for one reason. The one reason is 
to take more dollars out of somebody’s 
pocket. 
We can’t let this happen. We have a 
right to privacy in this country. We 
should be able to not have to tell the 
government everything we buy. If you 
want to buy a sofa or anything, you 
shouldn’t have to tell the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
So I completely oppose this signifi-
cant overreach by the Democrats try-
ing to look into everybody’s bank ac-
counts, because that is exactly what it 
would do. 
SUPPLY CHAIN 
Madam President, the second thing I 
want to talk about is the supply chain. 
We have a significant problem in the 
supply chain. Not only do we have a big 
problem, but if you look at what is 
going to happen with regard to the vac-
cine mandate, it is going to cause even 
more problems. 
My dad was a truck driver. If he had 
to choose, he would have a tough 
choice if he wasn’t comfortable, for 
whatever reason, getting the vaccine— 
and I took the vaccine and I had 
COVID—then he is going to lose his 
job, which is going to impact a lot of 
American families. It is going to cause 
the supply chain to be in worse shape, 
and it is going to cause even more in-
flation. 
So with President Biden’s recently 
announced 
unconstitutional 
vaccine 
mandates for private businesses, the 
President is saying government knows 
best and is taking choice away from 
families all across our country, but 
clearly my State of Florida. 
That is not what the American peo-
ple expect government to do. The gov-
ernment’s role is to give people infor-
mation. Give them the information and 
let them make good choices. They will 
make good choices. 
My parents didn’t have much of an 
education, but they could make good 
choices. They figured out what was 
good for our family. 
These decisions should be up to indi-
viduals, not government. That’s why I 
asked consent to pass S. 2997, and, un-
fortunately, the Senate Democrats ob-
jected. I hope we can find some com-
mon ground. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2998 
Madam President, I hope everyone 
here believes you should not have to 
receive a vaccine in order to obtain a 
Social Security check or Social Secu-
rity disability check. Forcing families 
to choose between receiving Social Se-
curity and choosing to get vaccinated 
is a terrible choice. 
That is why I introduced legislation 
to protect Social Security recipients 
and ensure that Biden won’t be able to 
strong-arm them into compliance with 
his unconstitutional mandate. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 2998, which is at the desk. I 
further ask that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed, and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry, 
Madam President. I am trying to jug-
gle two things at once. 
We are talking about the Social Se-
curity UC; is that correct? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is 
correct. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I re-
serve my right to object. 
As chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee and as a former director of 
the Oregon Gray Panthers, I take a 
backseat to no one when it comes to 
protecting Americans’ earned Social 
Security benefits. 
Now, we know Halloween is right 
around the corner and families are get-
ting ready for festivities—decorating 
their houses, picking out costumes, 
and watching scary movies. My col-
league from Florida seems to be get-
ting into the spirit of all this by telling 
the American people scary stories 
about vaccines threatening their Social 
Security benefits. I don’t believe the 
American people are so easily tricked. 
This idea is as fantastical and ridicu-
lous as a vampire living under your 
bed. 
The fact that Republicans are trying 
to scare folks for political gain I think 
is just very, very disappointing. These 
bills that are rooted in political mes-
saging aren’t going to help to end this 
pandemic or take concrete steps to ad-
dress actual challenges facing many of 
our constituents. 
With that, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
well, clearly I am pretty shocked. By 
objecting to this bill, my colleague is 
suggesting that it is acceptable for the 
government to deny Social Security 
checks to American seniors and checks 
to those who are physically disabled 
because they have made a personal 
medical choice to not receive the vac-
cine. 
This is not farfetched. The Biden ad-
ministration is already doing it to 
companies, and people are out of a job. 
The Social Security system is meant to 
help those who have spent their lives 
working in this country, and disability 
checks are designed to help those who 
cannot work. These checks are not a 
tool for government to impose its will 
on the people, just as it shouldn’t be 
the position of the Biden administra-
tion to require companies to enforce 
the vaccine mandate. 
But if you are on Social Security or 
your parent is receiving Social Secu-
rity checks, this is what my colleague 
is suggesting by blocking this legisla-
tion: Get the vaccine or go broke. 
As we all know, prices are going up, 
and the Social Security Administra-
tion just announced a record cost-of- 
living increase in benefits to keep up 
with Biden’s inflation crisis. Individ-
uals dependent on Social Security still 
need to get gas and groceries to sur-
vive. By objecting to this simple bill, 
my colleague is comfortable offering 
an ultimatum: Get the vaccine or go 
broke. It is wrong—it is wrong to the 
core—and the American people know 
it. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2999 
Mr. President, perhaps my colleague 
may agree with me on a different 
point—that 
vaccine 
mandates 
shouldn’t be tied to participation in 
Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP. There are 
more than 60 million Americans on 
Medicare and more than 80 million 
Americans receiving Medicaid or CHIP 
assistance. These programs are impor-
tant for ensuring that our families, our 
seniors, and our kids can stay healthy 
and have access to a doctor. No one 
should be deprived of healthcare be-
cause they have chosen not to receive 
the vaccine. It would be simply uneth-
ical to do so. It seems like pretty com-
mon sense. 
My proposal would protect individ-
uals on Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP 
from any overreaching vaccine man-
dates, like the President has done with

companies, and ensure that a personal 
medical decision does not strip them of 
the access to healthcare they need. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 2999, which is at the 
desk. I further ask that the bill be con-
sidered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, again, this deals 
with an area that is in the province of 
the Senate Finance Committee. There, 
I made a special priority of ensuring 
that Americans who count on Federal 
healthcare programs can actually get 
the care they need. The notion that 
Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP coverage 
could be subject to vaccination status 
is just nonsense. 
Contrary to Republican views that 
Federal coverage should be contingent 
on filing extensive paperwork, as con-
servative Governors have pushed in 
States from sea to shining sea, Demo-
crats believe healthcare is a basic 
human right and should be available to 
all. 
Millions of Americans have received 
the COVID–19 vaccine through the 
Medicare and Medicaid Programs. That 
ought to be celebrated as a success 
rather than scaring people about their 
earned benefits being taken away. 
These bills—now two of them—are 
thoroughly about political messaging 
and aren’t going to help to end this 
pandemic or do anything to address 
challenges facing so many of our con-
stituents. 
With that, again, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
first of all, let’s remember that the 
President is requiring a vaccine man-
date if you have a job. So there are 
people there who are going to lose their 
job because they, for whatever reason, 
are uncomfortable getting the vaccine. 
So this is not farfetched. 
I thought my colleagues had gone too 
far by suggesting it would be accept-
able for the government to tie vaccines 
to Social Security checks, but this is 
another level of insanity. My colleague 
is comfortable denying healthcare to 
someone because of their vaccine sta-
tus. It is really quite ironic because for 
the past 10 years, we have had Demo-
crats falsely claim Republicans want 
insurance companies to be able to deny 
coverage based on preexisting condi-
tions. But here we have it right here on 
the Senate floor—Democrats are doing 
exactly what they have falsely accused 
Republicans of. They want to be able to 
deny healthcare to Americans who 
have not received the vaccine. 
Does anyone really think that deny-
ing healthcare to people who don’t 
want to get the vaccine for whatever 
reason is truly in the best interest of 
public health? What do you do when 
someone is a bit hesitant on the vac-
cine? And we all have met people like 
that. For my Democratic colleagues, 
the answer is simple: Take away their 
healthcare. 
Do you need to refill your arthritis 
prescription? It seems Democrats want 
to make sure that pharmacists charge 
you more unless you get the shot. 
Maybe it is time to get your physical. 
If you have been on Medicaid, you are 
left with two options: Either get the 
shot or go home because the Democrats 
don’t want you to get your ears 
checked or your blood work completed 
unless you have met their standard of 
getting the shot. 
Whether you like it or not, some peo-
ple are not comfortable. It doesn’t mat-
ter how poor you are; they are willing 
to strip you of your health insurance 
and take away your ability to get your 
prescriptions unless you get the vac-
cine. 
The American people know these 
choices are wrong, and the fact that 
my colleagues stand by their decision I 
think is outrageous. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3000 
Mr. President, now, hopefully, we can 
get to some common ground. I think 
our colleagues disagreed on some of 
these things, but let’s see if we can find 
another one they will agree on, and 
that is access to housing. 
The Department of Housing and 
Urban Development provides a wide va-
riety of housing programs meant to 
help individuals and families in need of 
a home and those who are struggling 
and down on their luck. They help with 
everything from loans to first-time 
home buyers to homeless shelters and 
housing assistance. More than 5 mil-
lion people currently receive some kind 
of housing assistance from HUD. 
I can’t imagine anyone would think 
that the government should mandate 
vaccines for Americans who need to 
have basic access to housing or be able 
to limit, if you don’t want to get the 
vaccine, your access to housing. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of S. 3000, which is at the 
desk. I further ask that the bill be con-
sidered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. BROWN, reserving 
the right to object, I don’t want to 
laugh. This is too serious. But we have 
the chairman of the Republican Senate 
campaign committee who comes down 
to the floor—he knows better. I mean, 
he just knows better. He knows this is 
a political stunt. It is what he does. 
I don’t think the chair of the Senate 
Republican campaign committee gets 
paid extra to do this kind of stuff, but 
it is just clearly a political stunt. He 
knows. He doesn’t really know—I don’t 
know what he knows, but I do know 
that I haven’t seen his interest in hous-
ing since he has been in the Senate. I 
am the chair of the Housing Com-
mittee. When I was ranking member 
with Senator CRAPO, for whom I have 
great respect, I didn’t see any. But all 
of a sudden, he has this interest in low- 
income people’s housing to make sure 
that they have safe, accessible, afford-
able places to stay. 
He knows—he should know; I don’t 
know how he would not know—that 
HUD is not requiring proof of vaccina-
tion for people to use their services. 
There is no hint of any of us—I mean, 
because I am lucky enough to be chair 
of this committee, I do more in housing 
than perhaps anybody in this body—at 
least one of the three or four who do 
the most—and I don’t know anybody 
who is saying we are going to require 
proof of vaccine. So it is just a polit-
ical stunt. 
I don’t know if the Senator from—I 
think it is Florida; I am not sure—the 
Senator from Florida is going to, as 
soon as this is over, take down these 
debates and show how he is standing up 
for people’s access to housing, espe-
cially low-income, but he is proposing 
that the Senate take up and pass a bill 
to address a problem that just isn’t 
happening. 
The sad part is, we know how real 
housing issues are in this country. It 
isn’t a stunt for people trying to figure 
out how they are going to pay the rent. 
We know that before the pandemic, 25 
percent of renters in this country were 
paying more than half their income for 
rent. That means if the car breaks 
down, it means if their child gets sick, 
it means if they have a minor work-
place injury and they miss a week of 
work, it means that then their lives 
are turned upside down because they 
are evicted. 
I wish I saw my colleague and the 
other officers of the Republican Senate 
campaign committee out on this floor 
fighting for those renters, fighting for 
those low-income people who are pay-
ing $700 or $800 a month in rent in 
Hartford or in Cleveland and could pay 
less if they owned a home, but they 
don’t have the downpayment. It would 
be great to see them come out on the 
floor and work with us—work with us— 
the Senator from Connecticut and me 
and others, to help low-income people 
come 
up 
with 
that 
downpayment. 
There are 27,000 Floridians who were 
experiencing homelessness even before 
the pandemic. 
So I just wish I saw this concern and 
these concerns in other ways. Housing 
is a foundation for opportunity. It is 
the biggest cost most families face. 
The cost is way too high. We can’t 
build an economy that works for every-
one when housing prices eat up more of 
families’ budgets year after year. We 
can work to fix that. 
I encourage the Senator from Florida 
to join us to fix the real problems in

rural areas, in big coastal cities, in 
small towns on Lake Erie or the Atlan-
tic Ocean. It is a national problem that 
needs a national response and a na-
tional, significant investment. Let’s 
take housing problems seriously. Let’s 
stop the political stunts. Let’s work to-
gether for the people whom we serve. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
well, first off, the Senator might not 
know I grew up in public housing, so I 
do have a little bit of knowledge about 
public housing, and we had public hous-
ing for my constituents as Governor of 
Florida. So I watched my friends strug-
gle to make do. 
Let’s all remember that President 
Biden promised us that he would not 
require anybody to get the vaccine or 
require vaccine mandates, and that has 
clearly changed. 
So, you know, my parents didn’t have 
much of a formal education, but they 
worked hard, and they made the best 
choices they could with the informa-
tion they had, and they focused on the 
well-being of our family. So it is baf-
fling to me that my colleague might be 
willing to tell a family like mine that 
a vaccine was a precondition to have a 
roof over their head. I am surprised 
that Senate Democrats are willing to 
look in the eyes of struggling families 
and say: We can’t help you unless you 
have been vaccinated first—which is 
actually going on right now when you 
are telling people in this country that 
if you don’t get vaccinated, you lose 
your job. You will lose your job, so you 
will not be able to pay the rent; you 
will not be able to afford your house; 
you will not be able to afford to put 
food on the table. That is exactly what 
is going on. So this is not farfetched. 
These HUD programs were not meant 
to be used to force somebody to get a 
vaccine. So I am shocked that my col-
league would object. 
My colleagues have objected to sev-
eral proposals. All my proposals are de-
signed to make sure that there is no 
government overreach. Why is this im-
portant? Because let’s remember, Joe 
Biden promised he would not require 
anybody to get a vaccine, and he went 
back on that promise. I don’t believe 
anybody sitting on this floor should 
ever be in a position to say that they 
are OK with somebody not getting in a 
government 
program 
because 
they 
haven’t had a vaccine—food assistance, 
Social Security, healthcare, or hous-
ing, any of them. 
Now, look, I want to be clear. I had 
COVID. I got the vaccine, and I hope 
every American will consider getting 
the vaccine. But it is a decision that 
every American gets to make. They 
should talk to their doctor and make a 
decision for their family, and our gov-
ernment should never be in a position 
to tell somebody to get a vaccine. 
We can’t give people an ultimatum to 
comply with unconstitutional man-
dates or go without anything—Social 
Security, healthcare, housing, food 
benefits, or a job—which is going on all 
across this country right now. It is a 
gross overreach by the Federal Govern-
ment at a time when we need more in-
formation and more compassion, not 
mandates from an administration more 
focused on advancing its socialist agen-
da than looking out for every Amer-
ican. 
So, unlike Joe Biden and Democrats 
in Washington, I don’t believe the gov-
ernment knows best. I grew up in a 
family—and my parents didn’t have 
much of an education, but they did the 
best they could for our family. They 
worked hard. They made choices to 
make sure we all stayed safe. They 
didn’t rely on a government program 
other than to get information. They 
were trying to get good information 
from the government and make their 
own choices. 
So with that, I am very disappointed 
that my colleagues would disagree. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
CHILD TAX CREDIT 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I have a 
message for Ohio voters, my great 
State of 12 million people. 
To Ohio voters, to parents, I say: 
Check your bank accounts. 
On Friday, most Ohio parents—the 
parents of more than 2 million chil-
dren, 92 percent of children in our 
State—most Ohio parents, once again, 
saw $250, or $300, or $600 in tax cuts di-
rectly deposited in their banks ac-
counts, or maybe they got the check in 
their mailbox. 
To parents, I say: We know how hard 
you work at your jobs and raising your 
children. 
Any parent—any parent—knows how 
much work it is to take care of chil-
dren, especially young children. 
I am the lucky, proud grandparent, 
grandfather of eight grandchildren. I 
watch my children—five of our grand-
children live in Ohio; three of them 
live out of State not too far away. I 
watch them. I watch how hard they 
work, how difficult it is to take care of 
young children. And it has only gotten 
harder, of course, we know, over the 
last year and a half. 
So often I say to these parents: Your 
hard work doesn’t pay off like it 
should. 
We have seen what happened over the 
past few decades: productivity goes up, 
stock prices have soared, executive 
compensation is off the charts; yet 
wages have barely budged. 
Meanwhile, you know how expensive 
it is to raise children: healthcare, 
school lunch, diapers, clothes, school 
supplies, braces, sports fees. The list 
never seems to end. One of the biggest 
expenses, of course, for so many fami-
lies is childcare. 
Parents feel like they are stuck. The 
more they work, the more expensive 
childcare is. You feel like you can’t 
keep up, no matter how hard you work. 
It is why we passed the child tax 
credit—the largest tax cut for working 
families ever. It is about finally, fi-
nally, making your—Ohio parents— 
your hard work pay off so you can keep 
up with those extra expenses that keep 
coming when you are raising a family. 
Stories pour into our office from par-
ents from Sandusky to Portsmouth, 
from Ashtabula to Middletown and 
Hamilton, from Toledo to Gallipolis— 
stories we hear over and over about 
these tax cuts; stories about how ex-
pensive childcare is, how parents are 
using their money to afford childcare 
so they can go back to work or, in 
some cases, work overtime. 
Kristen of Columbus said she is using 
this to pay for ‘‘Daycare. For two kids 
[at] $600/wk.’’ 
Brittany said, ‘‘Daycare.’’ 
Ellie said, ‘‘Daycare.’’ 
Alex in Cleveland: ‘‘Every penny goes 
to daycare. 4 kids in daycare . . . $800/ 
week.’’ 
These tax cuts mean more parents 
are in the workplace. They can afford 
to go to work. It is that simple. 
And let’s be clear. Getting $300, get-
ting $600 a month per child in tax cuts 
doesn’t discourage anyone from getting 
a job, or doesn’t cause any of them to 
quit. 
I am going to leave my job that pays 
$30,000 a year because I am getting 
$3,000—said no one ever to us. 
There is no way you could afford to 
raise a family on that. You still need a 
job. These tax cuts help parents afford 
that job. 
It is all about dignity of work. I can’t 
count the number of families that said: 
You know—I said on this floor a few 
minutes ago that 25 percent of renters 
in this country spend half their income 
on rent. So we know how anxious those 
families are on the last week of the 
month. 
One of the things I have heard per-
haps more than anything else about 
this child tax credit is: The last week 
of the month, we don’t have to deny 
our kids dessert, or we don’t have to 
cut something else because some of 
that anxiety has been lifted off our 
shoulders because we are getting $250 
per child in the child tax credit. 
It makes a huge difference in just 
their lives. As I said, it is about the 
dignity of work. All work has dignity, 
whether you punch a clock or swipe a 
badge, whether you work for tips, 
whether you are on salary, whether 
you are caring for children, whether 
you are taking care of a sick parent. 
Raising children is work. Raising 
kids is a hell of a lot more work than 
moving money from one overseas bank 
account to another, or than checking 
your balance in your stock portfolio. 
That didn’t stop MITCH MCCONNELL 
from rewarding the wealthiest CEOs 
and hedge fund managers and Swiss 
banks account owners. We remember 
what happened. We looked down the 
hall in Senator MCCONNELL’s office, 
just 100 feet or so down there, and you 
see—particularly 3 or 4 years ago, you

October 19, 2021 
saw the lobbyists lining up there as he 
was dolling out to the wealthiest CEOs 
and the hedge fund managers and the 
Swiss bank accounts holders and the 
politicians, doing their bidding: pass 
that tax cut for the wealthy and for 
corporations and outsource jobs. 
Don’t think a lot of those CEOs 
didn’t take the tax cut, outsource jobs, 
set up manufacturing in those coun-
tries, and sell back in the United 
States. And then they took part of the 
tax cut and did stock buybacks to 
make themselves richer. 
Senator MCCONNELL and the leaders 
in this body all knew that is what that 
was all about. But when it comes time 
for a tax break for families making $10- 
or $20- or $50- or $75,000 a year, they are 
absent. 
We know that it was a partisan vote. 
Every Democrat voted for the biggest 
tax cut in American history. Every Re-
publican voted against the biggest tax 
cut in American history. Fortunately, 
there were more of us than there are of 
them. It was 51 to 50. 
They promised their tax cuts for the 
rich would trickle down. We know they 
never do. They keep the money for 
themselves. They spent that money on 
stock buybacks. 
Now, as I said, without a single vote 
from Republicans—I don’t like to be 
partisan around here. I represent a 
State that leans Republican. A lot of 
Republicans vote for me because I work 
with them and want them to succeed, 
as I want everybody to succeed. But we 
also know this tax cut shows whose 
side you are on. 
It is a pretty simple contrast—are 
you on the side of workers, or are you 
on the side of these big corporations 
that outsource jobs? Do you want tax 
cuts 
for 
billionaires 
and 
decamillionaires, or do you want tax 
cuts for working families? 
Overwhelmingly, Americans from all 
over the country, from all kinds of 
backgrounds agree with that. Everyone 
is lining up behind extending the child 
tax credit expansion: the faith commu-
nity, the civil rights community, the 
children’s 
advocacy 
community, 
Catholic 
Charities, 
Bread 
for 
the 
World, RESULTS, the Coalition on 
Human Needs, Leadership Conference 
on Civil and Human Rights, the Chil-
dren’s Defense Fund. 
So many others are writing us in the 
last week in support of keeping these 
checks going, in support of extending 
the child tax credit 1 year, 2 years, 3 
years, 5 years, 10 years, making it per-
manent, because every single month we 
show parents and workers we are on 
your side. 
So count on it. Starting July 15, first 
check; a month later, mid-August, sec-
ond check; a month later, mid-Sep-
tember, third check; just last week, the 
fourth check. Two hundred and fifty 
dollars if your child is between the 
ages of 6 and 17; $300 per child if your 
child is under 6. It has been like clock-
work. It has made a difference. 
We haven’t quite reached everybody 
in my State—2.5 million children are 
eligible, 2.4 million. We have reached 
about 2.3 million of them. So we are 
still working to find those other par-
ents who don’t know about this for 
their children. 
But think of what that has done for 
92 percent of my State’s children. Nine-
ty-two percent of the kids in my State, 
their parents are benefiting from this. 
One man said to me: You know, for 
the first time ever, I can buy my 
child—I can buy my daughter fastpitch 
softball equipment. 
At the same meeting, a woman, a 
mother, told me: You know, for the 
first time ever, my son can go to sum-
mer camp now, first time ever. 
Other parents were talking about 
childcare. One family said: You know, 
we can put aside $100 a month so my 
daughter can go to Sinclair State Com-
munity College, or maybe the Univer-
sity of Dayton, or maybe Ohio Univer-
sity. 
Other families talk, as I said, Mr. 
President, about rent, the anxiety they 
feel at the end of every month to come 
up with that rent check so they don’t 
get evicted. 
Every single month, we are showing 
parents and we are showing workers we 
are on your side. We will keep doing 
that. I hope more Republicans join us 
and we can do this bipartisan, but, ei-
ther way, we will not stop fighting to 
make sure parents’ hard work pays off 
for years to come. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
IRS 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in the 
past few weeks, I have been working 
with my colleagues in the Senate to 
draw attention to the privacy concerns 
of requiring all financial institutions 
to report to the IRS on the inflows or 
outflows on every checking, loan, and 
investment account above a certain 
threshold. 
Under the guise of closing the tax 
gap, Democrats have proposed to dras-
tically expand the powers of the IRS 
and turn banks and credit unions into 
private investigators for law-abiding 
Americans. The proposal as it origi-
nally came out in the ‘‘Green Book’’ 
from the White House required that 
every single financial account—not 
just bank accounts, not just credit 
union accounts, but all financial ac-
counts that have more than $600 worth 
of inflow or $600 worth of outflow in a 
given year would have to have that re-
ported to the IRS. 
We have been pointing this out to 
people across America now for several 
weeks, and the uproar is loud. The mes-
sage has been getting heard obviously 
because now the administration and 
the IRS are saying: Well, we didn’t 
really mean just everybody who has a 
$600 inflow or outflow of their account. 
We are willing to raise that to $10,000— 
so that you don’t have to have the IRS 
snooping on your financial data in your 
financial accounts unless you have 
more than $10,000 worth of income or 
more than $10,000 worth of outflow in 
your account. 
And they said: And we are not even 
going to count wages or interest or 
government benefits in that. 
Well, let’s see what that really 
means. Does that really reduce the 
scope of this spying on Americans’ fi-
nancial accounts, this dragnet, letting 
the IRS have access to everybody’s ac-
count? How many people don’t have 
$10,000 worth of income or outflow in 
their account? 
Let me just give you a few data 
points. From the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, the average household in Amer-
ica—the average taxpayer in America 
spends about $61,000 a year. What do 
they spend that on? The average is 
housing, $20,000; transportation, $9,700; 
personal insurance and pensions, $7,296; 
healthcare, $4,968; groceries, $4,464; res-
taurants and other meals, $3,459; enter-
tainment, $3,226; other, $2,030; cash con-
tributions, $1,888; apparel and services, 
$1,866; education, $1,407; and personal 
care, $768—for a grand total of the av-
erage 
American 
running 
$61,224 
through their personal accounts in a 
year. 
So does raising the total to $10,000 
really stop the IRS from accessing very 
many people’s accounts? No. The IRS 
today, because of the pressure that we 
have been putting on them, said today: 
Well, you know, we already have data 
from everybody’s account on their pay-
checks; and we already have data on 
their interest that they get on their 
various accounts, which has to be re-
ported to us; and we already have data 
on Federal benefits, like the COVID 
payments that have been made to peo-
ple. So we don’t need to have those 
data points collected in this new, mas-
sive privacy violation. We can leave 
those out. But we need—and this is 
what the IRS said today, trying to de-
fend this: But we need to have access 
to the other sources of income that 
people have. 
Now, in that very same document, 
the IRS said: Well, we are not going to 
audit anybody who makes less than 
$400,000 a year. Well, that wasn’t what 
the Green Book said. They didn’t say 
we will change our proposal to forbid 
us from auditing anybody who makes 
less than $400,000 a year. All they said 
was: Take our word for it. We promise. 
We will only audit rich, rich people 
who are billionaires. 
Well, if that is really the position 
they are taking, then why don’t they 
put it in the bill? Why don’t they put it 
in the proposal? Why don’t they put 
right in the proposal that they cannot, 
secretly or publicly, access the data of 
private individuals in their private ac-
counts if they make less than $400,000 
per year? It would be really simple, 
wouldn’t it? 
But the IRS didn’t say that, and the 
reason they didn’t say that is because 
that is not what they intend to do. Re-
member, they started out at $600. That 
tells you what they wanted. Now, they 
said: Well, we think we can get away 
with $10,000—because they know that 
still covers everybody.

S7055 
October 19, 2021 
Think of a family that doesn’t spend 
more than $10,000—yeah, that spends 
less than $10,000 in a year in their fi-
nancial accounts. Think of a small 
business in America that doesn’t run 
more than $10,000 a year of income and 
expense through their accounts. It will 
pick up every small business in Amer-
ica; it will pick up, I think, every fam-
ily in America; and nothing will be 
changed. The IRS will have data on 
every American’s account. 
Then they say: Well, OK, but it is 
only two numbers. It is just the total 
of your income and the total of your 
outflow. 
Well, everybody can kind of intu-
itively tell that that doesn’t make 
sense. What would they do with those 
two numbers? What they will do with 
those two numbers is use their algo-
rithms to figure out which taxpayers 
to audit—or which taxpayers that they 
don’t even need to audit; they will just 
send them a notice of deficiency and 
say: Well, we think you should owe 
more taxes, and this is what we think 
you should owe us. 
And if the taxpayers don’t comply, 
then the IRS can go ahead and audit 
them. And guess what happens when 
they audit them? They get access to 
every single transaction in their ac-
count. 
I asked the IRS Commissioner about 
whether this proposal involved trans-
actional data or just totals, and he 
said: Well, we already have access to 
their transactional data if we want it. 
That is not a direct quote, but that is 
the essence of what he said. And it is 
true. If they want to audit you, they 
can get access to your bank accounts 
already. 
So the question is: Who are they 
going to audit? Now, today, those who 
are trying to defend this say: Well, we 
are only going to audit people who 
have, as they said, $10,000 worth of in-
flow or outflow, and we will even ex-
clude wages, which are already re-
ported, and we will exclude government 
benefits, which are already reported, 
and we will exclude interest, which is 
already reported, and we won’t look 
into anybody’s account if they make 
under $400,000. 
Well, that is actually not true. They 
just said they wouldn’t audit those ac-
counts. How can they make the money 
they are trying to make out of this 
proposal if they don’t? 
Let’s look at this in another perspec-
tive. We asked the Joint Committee on 
Taxation to tell us what they think the 
distribution of audits and tax collec-
tions would be from Americans in all 
income brackets of this proposal, and 
the Joint Committee on Taxation said: 
Well, you know, we can’t tell you that 
because they haven’t given enough de-
tail on their proposal. So we can’t tell 
you what their proposal is going to do 
because they haven’t told us just the 
details of how their proposal is going 
to work. 
But Joint Committee on Taxation 
did say: You know, what we can do is 
look at the tax gap, which this is sup-
posedly aimed at addressing, and we 
can tell you where that tax gap falls 
among the various income cohorts. So 
we asked them to do that. 
They indicated that the tax gap falls 
mostly in ineffective or less than accu-
rate reporting on schedules C and 
schedule E. So they went through and 
they looked at this. So if you look at 
the Joint Committee on Taxation’s re-
port and the tax gap that is available 
for the IRS to go get, here is what 
would happen: 40 to 57 percent of the 
tax gap collections would come from 
taxpayers making $50,000 or less. If you 
add in up to $100,000, 65 to 78 percent of 
those making less than $100,000 would 
be part of the tax gap that they would 
be going after; 78 to 90 percent from 
those making less than $200,000; and 
only 4 to 9 percent would come from 
those making $500,000 or more. 
So if you want to know what the IRS 
wanted, you can look at this data on 
the tax gap; you can look at the data 
on where the tax gap lies; and you can 
look at their very first proposal that 
was down as low as $600. And you know 
then what the IRS is seeking to get. 
Americans should be outraged that 
the IRS is seeking to make banks, 
credit unions—I don’t know—Venmo, 
PayPal, credit card companies, every-
body who handles financial trans-
actions, report to them, if you hit some 
level, whether it be $600 or $10,000 of ei-
ther income or expenditure. And then 
the door is open. Then the IRS can use 
its algorithms and decide whether to 
do a deeper dive on you. 
And if they use the data from the In-
ternal Revenue Code and from the tax 
reporting that has already gone on, 90 
percent or more will come from people 
making $200,000 or less. Or the IRS will 
have to forgo that; in which case, they 
will be trying to collect on only 4 to 9 
percent, which is the people making 
over $500,000. 
Either way you look at it, either 
they 
are 
going 
to 
be 
collecting 
money—and that is billions and bil-
lions of dollars—from people who make 
less than $400,000 and mostly less than 
$200,000 or $100,000—or they won’t make 
the tax collections that they are claim-
ing they are going to get to justify the 
spending they want to make in their 
spending spree, in this big tax-and- 
spending spree that they are trying to 
cram down through Congress. 
Let’s look at it from another way. 
Does Treasury envision gathering in-
formation on all of a—let’s take a 
teacher. So if you have a teacher, does 
Treasury envision gathering informa-
tion on all of the teacher’s savings, 
checking, PayPal, Apple Pay, and 
Venmo accounts and somehow expect 
financial institutions to crosscheck 
these transfers to see if the threshold 
has been tripped? And at which point 
must additional reporting be done? 
It is very important to point out 
here: When I said earlier the White 
House and Treasury haven’t really said 
what their plan is, it is because they 
don’t want people to know what the 
real plan is. 
There is a telling sentence in the 
Green Book, put out by the White 
House, about this plan. It says that 
broad powers will be given to Treasury 
Department to issue by rule and regu-
lation the details of how they are going 
to utilize and access this data. 
So if you have got a Treasury De-
partment which has already proven it 
can’t keep the data it has safe and that 
its data will be hacked; if you have a 
Treasury Department that has already 
proven that it will not avoid utilizing 
the data it has for political purposes, 
that it will not weaponize the data it 
collects to punish or try to diminish 
the effect and influence of people with 
different political points of view; if you 
already have an IRS that has proven 
that it will take those kinds of actions, 
and that it is available to be accessed 
for its private data to be hacked, what 
can Americans expect from that? 
Again, those today who have talked 
about it said they have fixes that, as I 
see it, don’t really fix the proposal be-
cause it has fundamental flaws. The 
IRS does not need to have access to the 
accounts of every American who spends 
more than $10,000 or every American 
who has income of over $10,000. 
Industry has already spoken up about 
these 
changes 
that 
were 
proposed 
today. The American Bankers Associa-
tion says that even with the modifica-
tions announced today, this proposal 
goes too far by forcing financial insti-
tutions to share with the IRS private 
financial data from millions of cus-
tomers not suspected of cheating on 
their taxes. 
The exclusion of payroll and Federal 
program beneficiaries does not address 
millions of other taxpayers who will be 
impacted by this proposal. Not every 
nonwage worker is a millionaire. How 
about self-employed hair stylists, con-
venience store owners, and farmers, 
just to name a few? 
If enacted, this new proposal would 
still raise some of the same privacy 
concerns; 
increase 
tax 
preparation 
costs for individuals and small busi-
nesses; and create significant oper-
ational challenges, particularly for 
community banks. The list goes on. 
Americans must speak up loudly and 
say ‘‘no.’’ 
When asked if she was going to put 
this in the next bill, NANCY PELOSI 
said: ‘‘Yes, yes, yes, yes.’’ 
Americans should say ‘‘No, no, no, 
no.’’ 
I yield to Senator GRASSLEY. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Senator 
CRAPO, for leading this effort to point 
out what is wrong with this $4.2-tril-
lion reckless tax-and-spending spree. It 
is a massive government intrusion into 
the daily lives of American families. 
Under their vision for America, there 
isn’t any aspect of life in which the 
government shouldn’t perform a lead-
ing 
role. 
From 
cradle 
to 
grave, 
childcare to healthcare, college to ca-
reer, the Federal Government will be

there in your lives, shaping your every 
decision. 
Their plans go well beyond shoring 
up the social safety net to prevent 
those in need from falling through the 
cracks. And everybody agrees that peo-
ple that have needs, there is a role for 
government. But that doesn’t include 
320 million Americans. 
No longer, then, will the Federal 
Government’s primary role be about 
lending a helping hand so individuals 
can get back on their own feet. Instead, 
government would be the ultimate hel-
icopter parent, constantly hovering, re-
gardless of need. 
Even wealthy households would be in 
line for generous handouts to procure 
Federal 
Government-approved 
childcare, send their kids to a Federal 
Government-structured preschool, pur-
chase 
Federal 
Government-approved 
health insurance on the individual 
market, and obtain Federal Govern-
ment-provided paid family leave. 
Isn’t that a staggering list of things 
that the Democrats are proposing in 
this 4.2 tax-and-spending spree they are 
pushing? 
On the one hand, my Democratic col-
leagues rail against the wealthy paying 
too little tax. On the other hand, they 
want to shower the wealthy with gov-
ernment benefits, not to mention hand 
the wealthy, for instance, $12,500 to 
purchase a luxury electric car and 
make Federal taxpayers subsidize the 
State tax bills of millionaires. 
Can you believe the inconsistency of 
their arguments? 
Tax the wealthy; give to the wealthy. 
At the same time, Democrats have de-
cided that the best way to crack down 
on billionaires evading taxes is to 
snoop on the middle class. You just 
heard Senator CRAPO speak at length 
about that. Under their proposal, every 
American’s bank account with $600, or 
even if it is $10,000, of annual taxations 
would be subject to the peering eyes of 
the IRS. 
Democrats are betting the promise of 
free gifts will be too enticing for Amer-
icans to resist. However, Americans 
understand anything advertised as free 
comes with strings. Particularly, if it 
is free from the government, there is 
going to be strings attached. Those 
strings include higher taxes today and 
in the future and any loss of control 
over intimate family decisions. 
Liberal Democrats, in their progres-
sive bubble, are under the mistaken 
impression the general public is clam-
oring for evermore government pro-
grams. Now, in reality, Americans have 
long held a healthy skepticism of Big 
Government. A recent Gallup poll 
shows this continues to be true to this 
very day. According to Gallup—I think 
it was a weekend poll—nearly 80 per-
cent of Americans say that they prefer 
lower taxes and less government, or 
would like to see no change in either. 
Only 19 percent said they wanted more 
taxes and more government. 
President Clinton—up until 21 years 
ago, 
the 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States—understood this well when, in 
1996, he declared in a State of Union 
message, ‘‘the era of big government is 
over,’’ and then worked with Repub-
licans on comprehensive welfare re-
form. 
Why can’t those things go on today? 
Hopefully, President Biden and Sen-
ate Democrats come to their senses 
and realize this before taking our Na-
tion down the path of fiscal ruin. And 
I would define ‘‘fiscal ruin’’ by a Demo-
crat by the name of Larry Summers, 
former Secretary of the Treasury in 
the 
Clinton 
administration—and 
I 
think he also had some posts in the 
Obama 
administration—anyway, 
he 
told us in January, he told us in April, 
he told us in August, and I saw it again 
on television just last week: Spending 
all this money is feeding the fires of in-
flation like gasoline on that fire, and 
we ought to learn not to go through 
what we did in the seventies and 
eighties with inflation out of control. 
Listen to that, fellow Democrats, 
today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, Hoosiers 
have heard me talk about the size of 
the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spend 
bill—$3.5 trillion, and possibly growing 
in the House of Representatives. They 
have heard me talk about how this 
reckless proposal will raise tax on the 
American people. 
When I am talking about this legisla-
tion back home, I don’t have to go 
much past the $3.5-trillion figure. Peo-
ple are against it. All told, Democrats 
have proposed $7 trillion in spending 
this year alone—$7 trillion. 
Let me try to put that in perspective. 
Seven trillion dollars is roughly the 
mathematical equivalent of putting $1 
million of credit card debt on every 
man, woman, and child in the State of 
Indiana. 
Now, Hoosiers know this is some-
thing we simply cannot afford. Beyond 
the 
massive 
multitrillion-dollar 
pricetag, we should examine exactly 
what the Democrats are proposing, be-
cause this bill isn’t just a number on 
one side of a ledger sheet. This spend-
ing package—the largest in American 
history—represents a massive leftward 
shift in the way our country operates. 
And Hoosiers and, I think, all Ameri-
cans need to know what is in it. 
Well, thankfully, I sit on the Senate 
Finance Committee, and in the Senate 
Finance Committee we are charged 
with overseeing matters related to tax-
ation and entitlement programs. So if 
anyone has insight into the particulars 
of this legislation, it would be a mem-
ber of the Senate Committee on Fi-
nance. 
If any legislation this large and this 
consequential were to pass, it would 
surely go through the Senate Finance 
Committee. But the full Finance Com-
mittee hasn’t held a policy hearing in 
months. 
Tomorrow, we will hold our first full 
committee hearing since July. That 
hearing will be on a topic only re-
motely connected to the Democrats’ 
reckless tax-and-spend proposal. And 
to my knowledge, no Senate com-
mittee has held any hearing whatso-
ever on this bill at all. 
You see, this reckless tax-and-spend 
bill has all been done, largely, in se-
cret, behind closed doors. I read about 
it in the newspapers. I will hear rumors 
about it from my colleagues. 
So it is worth asking: What is the 
other side trying to hide? What have 
Democrats put in this mother of all 
bills? 
Well, let’s start with what the Wall 
Street Journal recently called ‘‘Enti-
tlements for the Affluent.’’ This is the 
Wall Street Journal’s way of saying 
‘‘handouts for the rich,’’ which is accu-
rate because so few of the new and ex-
panding government giveaways in this 
bill are targeted in ways that I might 
support to actually help Americans of 
modest needs. 
Now, for reference, the U.S. median 
income for a family of four in this 
country is about $90,000. But, under 
this bill, a family can make $400,000 a 
year and get an $8,000 child tax credit 
from Washington. 
How about ObamaCare subsidies? 
The original eligibility limit for 
ObamaCare subsidies is 400 percent of 
the Federal poverty level—or about 
$106,000 for a household of four. Their 
bill completely removes the eligibility 
limit. This means much wealthier 
Americans would be eligible for tax-
payer-subsidized health insurance. 
If Speaker NANCY PELOSI gets her 
way, wealthy elites on the coast will 
get a massive tax write-off for their 
mansions in high tax cities, like San 
Francisco; or high tax States, like New 
York. 
Now, what else is in the bill? How 
about $80 billion more for the IRS? 
Yes, Democrats want to add a man-
date that banks turn over to the IRS 
personal, confidential bank informa-
tion from rank and file Americans. 
You see, if you make or spend more 
than $600 in a year, they want your pri-
vate information. They want to know 
what you are spending money on, how 
you earned your money. I have called 
on Leader SCHUMER to abandon this un-
precedented proposal. If you thought 
the IRS was a political weapon before, 
you ain’t seen nothing yet. 
What else is in this bill? How about 
$3 billion for tree equity—tree equity— 
whatever that means. You can’t make 
this stuff up. Some of the provisions 
that are supposed to be about climate 
change are really handouts to Demo-
cratic constituencies. 
The spending bill raises the electric 
vehicle tax credit by up to $5,000, 
among other expansions, with the 
pricetag of $42 billion. Did you know 
you only get part of this credit, this 
electric vehicle tax credit of up to 
$5,000, if your electric vehicle comes 
from a unionized plant? I represent a 
lot of quality union members, great 
Americans. They are patriots. But

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7057 
October 19, 2021 
under this proposal, plants like the 
Toyota or Honda or Subaru factories in 
my State of Indiana are told to take a 
hike because they are located in large-
ly red States with nonunion employ-
ees—by choice. 
I haven’t even talked about the tax 
increases supported by the other side 
that will raise taxes on lower and mid-
dle-income households. Some of these 
households make under $30,000 a year. 
This is a clear violation of President 
Biden’s tax pledge—a pledge that 49 out 
of 50 of my Democratic colleagues for-
mally voted to uphold just 2 months 
ago when we considered the budget. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this reckless 
tax-and-spending spree is full of give-
aways to the wealthy and handouts to 
Democratic constituencies. I stand for 
the working men and women of this 
country. The Republican Party stands 
for the working men and women of this 
country. We will stand united against 
these giveaways to the rich. It is offen-
sive. It is too much money, and it must 
be stopped. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator yields back. Any 
other Senators seeking recognition? 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, that con-
cludes the Finance Committee Mem-
bers’ discussion today. 
I just want to thank Senator GRASS-
LEY and Senator YOUNG for joining me 
to help to continue to make the Amer-
ican people aware of what is going on 
here in Washington with this reckless 
tax-and-spending spree and this mas-
sive dragnet of IRS access into people’s 
individual bank accounts and other fi-
nancial accounts. 
I hope Americans across the country 
will speak out loudly in opposition to 
these terrible ideas that are now being 
crammed down in both the House and 
the Senate. 
I yield back our time. 
I believe Senator GRASSLEY is here to 
speak on other matters. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
hear about rising costs of prescription 
drugs at nearly every one of my town-
hall meetings. 
Three years ago, I began a bipartisan 
effort to lower prescription drug costs. 
Following 
our 
Finance 
Committee 
hearings at that time, we had a mark-
up, and we had bipartisan negotiations. 
Senator WYDEN, now chairman of the 
Finance Committee, and I introduced, 
at that time, the Prescription Drug 
Pricing Reduction Act. 
The bill caps yearly out-of-pocket 
drug costs for seniors at $3,100. It pre-
vents drug costs from growing faster 
than the consumer price index on a 
yearly basis. It ends uncapped tax-
payer-funded subsidies to Big Pharma. 
It creates more sunshine, more com-
petition, and it even has oversight into 
the world of drug pricing. It brings 
meaningful reform while driving down 
costs. It has $72 billion in savings for 
seniors—that is out-of-pocket costs to 
them—and $95 billion savings of tax-
payers’ money through Medicare. 
An important goal that we accom-
plish in our bill is lowering drug costs 
without hurting innovation. We did 
this by keeping government out of the 
business of setting prices and indi-
rectly keep the government out of your 
medicine cabinet. 
Democrats have proposed the irre-
sponsible idea of government dictating 
drug prices. They would do this by get-
ting rid of the noninterference clause 
in the Part D part of Medicare. It is 
better known as so-called drug price 
negotiations, but it is not negotiation; 
it is dictating prices. 
Eighteen years ago, I was the prin-
ciple architect of the Medicare Part D 
Program. Adding a prescription drug 
benefit for seniors was the right thing 
to do then, and it is still the right 
thing to do, but it needed to be done in 
the right way, and that right way is for 
the patients. 
In creating Part D, we enacted a very 
key policy: keeping the government 
out of the business of dictating drug 
prices. Governments don’t negotiate; 
they dictate. Competition is the only 
thing that drives innovation, curbs 
costs, expands coverage, and improves 
outcomes. 
The Congressional Budget Office has 
consistently stated that government 
negotiations of drug prices would not 
achieve greater savings than the cur-
rent market-based system, unless you 
restrict the formulary or dictate the 
price through reference pricing based 
upon what socialist healthcare systems 
pay in other countries. That is the out-
come. The government gets between 
you and your doctors prescribing. 
Democrats propose so-called drug 
price negotiations in their reckless 
tax-and-spending spree to save hun-
dreds of billions of dollars. Who is hurt 
by this policy? Of course, patients are. 
The Democrats would have govern-
ment dictate drug pricing based upon 
an 
international 
reference 
pricing 
index. Study after study has shown so- 
called drug pricing negotiations will 
reduce the number of new drugs pro-
duced. What your doctor wants to pre-
scribe for you might not be on that for-
mulary. 
This policy would be devastating if 
one of those drugs was the cure for Alz-
heimer’s or diabetes or cancer. I don’t 
believe that is what Americans want. 
While Democrats attempt to advance 
their partisan drug pricing scheme, I 
hope common sense will prevail, and 
we pass a bipartisan prescription drug 
bill. I have engaged with colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle and in a bi-
cameral way. I did this so common 
sense would prevail, if we ever get to 
the point of Democrats realizing that 
the government dictating prices on an 
international basis of what the prices 
are in other countries will never get 60 
votes here in the U.S. Senate. 
All of the Republicans and Demo-
crats I have contacted have expressed 
eagerness to find a solution to mean-
ingfully lower prescription drug costs. 
Holding Big Pharma accountable has 
historically been a bipartisan effort. 
Delivering new reforms to fight price 
hikes should be no different. Demo-
crats should stop pursuing their reck-
less tax-and-spending spree that will 
hurt innovation and produce less cures. 
Instead, we should act by passing my 
bipartisan prescription drug bill. 
I think maybe there is an inkling of 
good news coming from the Speaker of 
the House—and I have had a chance to 
visit with her at least three times in 
the last 2 years on this very subject 
about my bill—when she said that she 
didn’t think—I don’t know whether she 
referred to the number H.R. 3, but that 
is the bill that has their main effort on 
reducing prescription drugs—when she 
said that she didn’t think that that 
would have the votes to get passed. 
I hope there is some awakening to 
the fact that we need to do something 
and that this bipartisan approach is 
the answer. 
TRUMP INVESTIGATION 
Mr. President, today I would like to 
discuss the media’s complete misrepre-
sentation of the Republican report on 
Senator DURBIN’s Trump investigation, 
in which my staff participated accord-
ing to Committee rules. 
I gave an October 7 speech on this 
subject, and you wouldn’t know that 
anybody read my speech based upon 
what has been reported on TV. But as 
I noted in that October 7 speech, Sen-
ator DURBIN publicly released a Demo-
cratic staff report on his investigation. 
We Republicans did the same thing 
that very same day. 
I came to the floor that same day to 
describe the Republican report. In so 
doing, I laid out what the available 
facts and evidence showed within the 
scope of the inquiry. That scope was 
from December 14, 2020, to January 3, 
2021. But TV seemed to think we were 
talking about what happened on Cap-
itol Hill on January 6. 
The Durbin investigation ended on 
January 3—or events leading up to 
January 3. I say that date range yet 
again because many reporters have 
wrongly conflated this investigation 
with the January 6, 2021, events here on 
Capitol Hill. We know all the damage 
that was done to the Capitol that day. 
So I want to repeat: The scope of the 
investigation stopped on January 3, 
not January 6, but you wouldn’t know 
it from the TV reports. 
I am not going to rehash my entire 
speech. I have incorporated it here by 
reference. However, I will note, yet 
again for the media, several key facts. 
This is not analysis, as I think TV was 
trying to do, just the facts. 
Fact 1. Records indicate that Presi-
dent Trump’s focus was on ‘‘legitimate 
complaints and reports of crimes.’’ And 
those words come from the transcript. 
Fact 2. Witnesses testified that Presi-
dent Trump’s main focus was making 
the Justice Department aware of the 
potential criminal allegations and to

ensure the Department did its job. 
Trump’s focus then wasn’t to direct or 
order specific investigative steps. And 
to that point, witnesses said that 
Trump’s focus was on the American 
people—not himself or his campaign— 
being harmed by what he believed to be 
widespread election fraud. 
Fact 3, these witnesses testified 
under 18 U.S.C. 1001, which makes it a 
crime to give false statements, that it 
was not unreasonable for President 
Trump to question what the Justice 
Department was doing to investigate 
election fraud and crime allegations. 
In fact, one witness testified under 
1001 that Trump had ‘‘no impact’’— 
those two words—on the Department’s 
actions to investigate election allega-
tions. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t also note 
that one witness testified under 1001 
that 
the 
Justice 
Department 
was 
‘‘dragging their feet and maybe more 
to keep these investigations from going 
forward.’’ 
Fact 4, my staff read former U.S. At-
torney for the Northern District of 
Georgia, BJ Pak, a press release from 
the Biden administration where Biden 
set policy for the Justice Department 
by prohibiting it from using subpoenas 
for records of reporters in criminal 
leak investigations. 
My staff then asked if any President 
has similar authority to set the De-
partment’s policy with respect to in-
vestigating and reviewing voter fraud 
and election crime allegations. This 
witness stated, ‘‘I would agree that the 
President has that duty.’’ 
And the last fact, 5, President Trump 
twice rejected firing Acting Attorney 
General Rosen, and twice rejected the 
notion of sending what is called the 
‘‘draft Clark letter.’’ 
Now, after giving you those facts, ac-
cordingly, 
on 
the 
basis 
of 
this 
foundational evidence, with respect to 
the scope of this investigation from De-
cember 14, 2020, to January 3, 2021, 
President Trump sought and followed 
the advice and also the recommenda-
tions of his senior advisers. I note with 
specific emphasis the fact that he fol-
lowed their advice and recommenda-
tions. This is a crucial fact. 
The report is entitled ‘‘In Their Own 
Words.’’ It is based on actual witness 
evidence, not CNN-style partisan anal-
ysis. I encourage everyone to read the 
report and the transcripts and draw 
your own conclusions. That is how I al-
ways approached my investigations in 
the years that I have been in the U.S. 
Senate. 
Now let’s go to how my speech was 
reported on TV. Some on CNN have 
said that I showed ‘‘fealty’’ to Trump 
by stating the facts. They called these 
facts that I just recited ‘‘delusional.’’ I 
have never had a problem following the 
facts wherever they lead, no matter 
who is in power. 
So I am going to refer to an inves-
tigation I did in the Trump administra-
tion, and it involved some people in the 
Trump—and close to President Trump. 
I ran a transcribed interview on Don-
ald Trump, Jr., during the Trump ad-
ministration. That was done as part of 
my Trump-Russia investigation when I 
was chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, which focused on the June 9, 
2016, Trump Tower meeting. 
I also subpoenaed Paul Manafort to 
appear at a hearing and provide testi-
mony. Instead of publicly testifying, 
Manafort voluntarily agreed to an 
interview with my and then-Ranking 
Member FEINSTEIN’s staff. But as the 
ranking member’s staff then refused to 
interview him and objected to my staff 
doing so without them there, that 
didn’t move forward. 
Notably, the committee never re-
ceived any—when I was chairman dur-
ing this investigation I am talking 
about, the committee never received 
any emails from the Democratic Na-
tional Committee or the Clinton cam-
paign, 
even 
though 
we 
repeatedly 
asked for them. Of course, the Demo-
crats wouldn’t support subpoenaing 
them, and you didn’t hear a lot about 
that from the media—the double stand-
ard media. The Trump campaign pro-
duced records. 
Just like there is a coverage vacuum, 
particularly by CNN, of Hunter Biden 
and James Biden and their connection 
with the communist Chinese Govern-
ment, my and Senator JOHNSON’s Sep-
tember 20 report on those financial 
connections and their potential crimi-
nality 
was 
attacked 
as 
Russian 
disinformation. Later on, Hunter Biden 
publicly admitted that he was under 
criminal investigation for financial 
matters. I don’t hear much about that 
on CNN. 
In my and JOHNSON’s report, we made 
clear that based upon deep financial 
connections between the Biden family 
and foreign governments, Hunter Biden 
is a counterintelligence and extortion 
concern. 
On 
that 
note, 
recently 
released 
emails have opened up the possibility 
that Joe Biden mixed bank accounts 
and funds with Hunter Biden. Other 
emails show that Joe Biden shared of-
fice space with individuals connected 
to the communist Chinese regime. 
Of course, my and Senator JOHNSON’s 
report was the first to prove that Hun-
ter Biden, James Biden, and other fam-
ily members had extensive financial 
and business relationships with indi-
viduals not just connected to the com-
munist Chinese regime, but its intel-
ligence and military services. 
About that Grassley and Johnson re-
port, POLITICO ran the off-base head-
line: ‘‘GOP Senators’ anti-Biden report 
repackages old claims.’’ 
In contrast, one of their own report-
ers just very recently confirmed the 
authenticity of some of Hunter Biden’s 
emails for a book that he was writing. 
One Washington Post columnist said: 
‘‘Even after accepting disinformation 
from Russian agents, Johnson and 
Grassley couldn’t come up with any-
thing new or interesting on Hunter 
Biden.’’ 
And NPR said about the New York 
Post Hunter Biden stories: ‘‘We don’t 
want to waste our time on stories that 
are not really stories, and we don’t 
want to waste the listeners’ and read-
ers’ time on stories that are just pure 
distractions.’’ 
Now, compare what I have said—how 
different Democrats and Republicans 
are treated; how investigations are 
done differently by Republicans and by 
Democrats—and then look at the state 
of journalism today. What I just said is 
so much for investigative journalism. 
Investigative journalism died without 
so much as a whimper. 
The media’s attack against the Re-
publican Trump report is essentially an 
attack on witness testimony received 
by the committee. Time and again, 
many in the media have failed to meet 
the facts head-on in order to fit their 
own biased story line. 
So I say to everybody, including jour-
nalists that don’t want to do hard 
work: Read the testimony of those peo-
ple that were taken on what went on 
between December 14 and January 3. 
Read what I say about it. Read what 
Senator DURBIN says about it. But at 
least read the testimony if you are 
going to make comments distorting 
what I said on October 7. In other 
words, stop screwing up. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTE ON MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that all remaining 
time be yielded back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
motion to discharge. 
The yeas and nays have been pre-
viously ordered.

The legislative clerk called the roll.

The motion was agreed to. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). Pursuant to S. Res. 27, and 
the motion to discharge having been 
agreed to, the nomination will be 
placed on the executive calendar. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I will be 
speaking in a moment. I had planned to 
deliver my remarks prior to making a 
unanimous consent request, but in def-
erence to my friend and colleague from 
Washington, I will be making the con-
sent request first, and then proceed to 
my prepared remarks. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2847 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 2847, and that 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration. Further, I ask unani-
mous consent that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed, and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, first, 
before I object, I would like to thank 
the Senator for his consideration. I 
really do appreciate that. 
Mr. President, reserving the right to 
object, here we go again. Even after 
700,000 deaths and rising, Republicans 
are coming up with new ideas to under-
mine our vaccination efforts and make 
it harder for us to safely reopen our 
country; and in this case, even make it 
harder for us to respond to future 
pandemics. 
Requiring basic precautions to keep 
people safe when traveling is nothing 
new in this country, nor are immuniza-
tion requirements, for that matter. 
And let’s be clear and remember, the 
vaccine requirements President Biden 
has enacted so far include tailored ex-
emptions for legitimate religious and 
medical conditions that have long been 
standard, and the emergency tem-
porary standard he has envisioned 
would allow testing as an alternative. 
Therefore, I would call on my Repub-
lican colleagues to remember this is a 
pandemic; it is not a political football. 
We need to treat it as a public health 
crisis. 
And, therefore, I do object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I have come 
here to the Senate floor six times now 
to oppose President Biden’s unconsti-
tutional actions, using the Federal 
Government and using the Oval Office, 
in particular, in order to force Ameri-
cans to get the COVID–19 vaccine. 
Now, as I have said before, as I have 
said each and every time I have spoken 
on this issue, I am not opposed to the 
COVID–19 vaccine. I have been fully 
vaccinated, as has every member of my 
family, with my encouragement. I en-
couraged my family, I have encouraged 
friends, everyone I know, to get vac-
cinated. 
I think the vaccine is a blessing, and 
it is one that has helped a lot of people. 
And I think it is one for which society, 
as a whole, has benefited. 
I 
have 
had 
and 
recovered 
from 
COVID–19 before I got vaccinated, and I 
can tell you that contracting COVID is 
not an experience that I would like to 
repeat, and it is not an experience that 
I want others to have. That is why I 
have had the vaccine and why I have 
encouraged others to do the same. 
I, nonetheless, raise my hand in this 
very Chamber each time I have been 
sworn into the office. Pursuant to the 
Constitution, I stood right there on 
those steps and I swore an oath to up-
hold and protect and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States. 
That inspired document limits the 
powers of government. It does so be-
cause government power is sacred. 
Government power is dangerous. Gov-
ernment power always involves the ac-
tual or threatened use of coercive 
force. It is what government is—the 
ability and the authority to use coer-
cive force and to do so on an official 
basis through law. It is for that reason 
that the Constitution carefully con-
tains the power of government and 
does so in a way that reflects its im-
mense capacity for harm. 
There are lots of other things that 
are useful that we have to be careful 
when handling. You know, fire, elec-
tricity, oxygen, water, these are all 
things that are necessary, that we de-
pend upon, that we need; and things 
that, if left uncontrolled, can inflict all 
sorts of harm, can hurt people, can kill 
people, can destroy life and property. 
So that is why the Constitution goes 
to great lengths to draw boundaries 
and assign authority not only to dif-
ferent branches of government, but 
also different levels of government. In 
fact, every single provision of the U.S. 
Constitution is itself a form of limita-
tion on government power. 
These protections were designed to 
prevent government from excessively 
burdening the American people, be-
cause we have seen over time the tend-
ency of governments to abuse that 
power and, in particular, the tendency 
of governments to become abusive 
when there is a dangerous accumula-
tion of power at the hands of a few. 
Tragically, and under the direction of 
Senates and Houses of Representatives 
and White Houses of every conceivable 
partisan combination, we have strayed 
far from the design of our govern-
ment—the design put in place by the 
Constitution, the very same Constitu-
tion to which we have all sworn an 
oath. 
And as a result of that, Americans 
are now forced to work many months 
out of every year just to pay their Fed-
eral tax obligations only to be told 
after the fact, by the way, that is not 
nearly enough because we are now 
nearly $30 trillion in debt in closing. 
The monetary printing presses are 
pumping out tsunamis of fiat currency 
that eats away at Americans’ savings 
and earnings. Government regulations 
cost trillions of dollars a year as a hid-
den back door, invisible, and highly re-
gressive tax on American productivity 
and on American development. 
And this is a tax that is borne dis-
proportionately by poor and middle- 
class Americans who find that every-
thing they buy—goods and services 
alike—become more expensive. And we 
find that they also pay for it with di-
minished wages, unemployment, and 
underemployment. 
Almost every aspect of American life 
is now inappropriately restricted, di-
rected, or taxed by the Federal Govern-
ment. President Biden’s recent man-
date adds yet another roadblock to 
millions of Americans just trying to 
get by, forcing them to choose between 
getting vaccinated on the one hand and 
having a job on the other hand. 
What it is doing is it is saying: Look, 
you don’t agree with the government 
position on this? Fine. You are going 
to lose your job. You are going to pay. 
You are going to lose your job. You are 
going to be rendered unemployed and 
effectively unemployable. Not only 
that, but we are going to do it in a way 
that many instances will render it ba-
sically impossible for you to recover 
unemployment benefits. 
One of the things that is particularly 
devious about this one is that the man-
date itself hasn’t been issued, and yet 
it has been now a month and a half or 
so since President Biden gave the 
speech announcing his intention to cre-
ate it. 
Had he created it, we would at least 
know what we were dealing with. We 
would know the precise source of au-
thority in the law that he was claim-
ing. We would know the contours of 
how it would be enforced. We would 
know the contours of any exceptions to 
the mandate. 
And because we would have an order, 
there would be something that people 
could challenge in court, where nec-
essary. But as of right now, we have 
none of those things. We have only this 
Damoclean sword hanging over the 
American people, who are forced to 
guess.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7060 
October 19, 2021 
And in the meantime, we have cor-
porate America—we have employers 
with more than 99 workers, under-
standably, scrambling in an effort to 
get ahead of this thing because they 
know that the penalties for noncompli-
ance with this are likely to be signifi-
cant. So many of them are trying to 
get ahead of it so they are not caught 
flat-footed and unable to comply. 
As a result, many of these have just 
tried to guess at what the mandate will 
say and adopted those policies, some-
times 
knowing 
that 
their 
policies 
might be more aggressive than what 
the Federal Government will require. 
But in the meantime, this leaves no 
one 
accountable. 
The 
corporations 
have 
the 
Federal 
Government 
to 
blame. And the Federal Government 
responds by saying there is no policy 
yet; there is nothing to sue on yet; 
there is nothing for the Federal courts 
to enjoin as unlawful, as unconstitu-
tional, as an improper exercise of Fed-
eral power generally—keeping in mind 
that the Federal Government is one of 
few and defined powers, as James Madi-
son described them in Federalist No. 
45. The powers reserved for the States 
are 
numerous 
and 
indefinite. 
We 
flipped that on its head here. There is 
nothing that gives the Federal Govern-
ment this power. 
My friend and colleague from Wash-
ington moments ago made the argu-
ment that vaccines are nothing new 
and that vaccine requirements are 
nothing new. Well, you know, they are 
new when it comes to a general man-
date issued by the Federal Government 
to do this. Yes, there have been man-
dates in the past, but insofar as they 
deal with the general population as op-
posed to military personnel or certain 
government workers. These are not 
Federal law issues. These have been 
State law issues. The Federal Govern-
ment has no general police powers. 
Even if there were power within the 
Federal Government to do this, which I 
assure you there is not, we know for 
certain that one person acting alone— 
even if that person is the President of 
the United States—has not the power 
to do this. 
This is, I believe, perhaps the most 
egregious example of Presidential over-
reach, the most shameless executive 
branch power grab since President 
Harry Truman seized all steel mills in 
the United States in the 1950s in order 
to support the Korean war effort. 
Now, President Truman did not get 
away with that. The Supreme Court 
appropriately struck that down as well 
outside Presidential powers. You see, 
nothing in the Constitution and noth-
ing in Federal statute gave President 
Truman the power to seize steel mills 
simply because he deemed them an im-
portant part of the war effort. 
Here, that hasn’t happened. Here, 
that can’t happen—at least not yet be-
cause we don’t have an order. The 
President, after making this announce-
ment about 6 weeks ago, hasn’t had the 
decency to even tell us what the source 
of his authority is. 
And I will let you in on a secret: He 
has none. He has not a single scintilla, 
not a shred of authority—not statu-
torily, not constitutionally—to do this. 
He does haven’t the power to do it. 
Now, lest you be deceived into think-
ing that this is an academic infringe-
ment of some esoteric liberty, it is not. 
Let’s be honest about what we are 
doing here. We are telling hard-work-
ing American moms and dads: If you do 
not succumb, if you do not heel, if you 
don’t obey the Presidential dictate at 
issue here, you are going to lose your 
job. 
We are making them decide between 
getting a vaccine to which they may 
have a medical or a religious or some 
other legitimate exemption on the one 
hand and on the other hand becoming 
unemployed and unemployable. And in 
many instances, they are unable to 
even attain unemployment benefits be-
cause you know what a lot of these 
companies are doing—again, in order to 
get ahead of the mandate—they are 
adopting their own draconian and ag-
gressive policies. They are already fir-
ing people. In some cases, they are not 
firing them. They are putting them on 
unpaid administrative leave, making it 
impossible for them to get unemploy-
ment. Is that really what we want to 
do? 
Look, I understand the COVID–19 
vaccine is a good thing. I consider it a 
medical miracle of sorts. What do you 
say to somebody whose religious beliefs 
make this an unacceptable choice for 
them? What do you say to someone 
with a genuinely serious medical con-
dition, someone who has been told by 
his or her board-certified medical doc-
tor, ‘‘Don’t get this vaccine. You, in 
your case, you shouldn’t get it because 
of medical condition X, Y, or Z’’? What 
do you say to that person? Do you real-
ly want to tell that person that them 
being brought to heel with the Federal 
directive issued by one person, in the 
absence of any statutory or constitu-
tional authority to do that, that is 
more important; that is so compelling, 
that they have to be rendered unem-
ployed, unemployable and ineligible, in 
many instances, even to collect unem-
ployment? Is that really what we have 
sunk to? I hope not. I don’t believe we 
have. 
The American people know better. 
They know that is not how we resolve 
disputes in this country. It is certainly 
not how we treat religious minorities 
or people with medical conditions that 
make them have a different set of con-
cerns than other people. That is not 
how we act. 
By the way, it is also a good reason 
why we don’t make law in this country 
through one person because, of course, 
Mr. President, a law like that would 
never pass. It would never pass here in 
the Senate or in the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
It 
couldn’t 
withstand 
that kind of scrutiny, not the way it 
has been laid out—not a chance. 
Deep down, the President of the 
United States perhaps knows this. I 
can only assume—of course, I can’t 
read another human being’s subjective 
mindset—but I can only assume that 
he would have brought it to Congress 
and given us the opportunity to con-
sider it and adopt it. He cut out the 
people’s elected representatives, the 
people’s elected lawmakers whose con-
stitutional obligation and authority it 
is to make the law so we can only 
make assumptions from them. 
But it is not as though he didn’t have 
time to do it. Six weeks have elapsed 
since he made the announcement. 
Meanwhile, I am hearing from count-
less people across America, including 
300 or so people from the State of Utah 
who are themselves being put in impos-
sible positions. 
Now, look, mind you, for most peo-
ple, this isn’t a big deal. Most people in 
America have chosen to get the vac-
cine, and I am glad they have, but 
there are a lot of people whose stories 
are heart-wrenching. 
Just this week, I heard from a flight 
attendant who works with a major U.S. 
airline. She has religious beliefs that 
make her opposed to getting this vac-
cine or any vaccine. She is a hard- 
working employee. She has been a 
faithful flight attendant, and it is a job 
that she has loved and she has enjoyed 
throughout her entire adult profes-
sional career. It is a job that has bene-
fited her and her family, allowed her to 
make a living, put food on the table. 
She is now being faced with this awful 
choice between, on the one hand, be-
traying her religious beliefs—which she 
is unwilling to do—and, on the other 
hand, losing a job which is her only 
means of earning a living, of feeding 
her family. How is this fair? How is 
this just? How is this constitutional? It 
is not. 
Troublingly, there are now signs that 
the White House isn’t satisfied with 
just making Americans who haven’t re-
ceived the vaccine unemployed and un-
employable. The administration is re-
portedly also considering a medical 
mandate for interstate travel. Such a 
move would be deeply constitutionally 
concerning, but it would also revoke 
yet another freedom and make yet an-
other group of American citizens sol-
idly second class. 
The privileges and immunities clause 
of the 14th Amendment, of course, pro-
tects the right to interstate travel. 
There is no precedent in our Nation’s 
history of a requirement of this nature 
for interstate travel. 
Even if those considerations were 
somehow untrue—they are not, but 
even if they were—Congress has cer-
tainly not granted such authority to 
the President of the United States to 
act unilaterally, nor would we ever. 
A mandate requiring people to get 
the COVID–19 vaccine in order to have 
the privilege, the benefit, which is ac-
tually just a right, one that the Amer-
ican people ought to be able to rely on 
to travel interstate within the United 
States, is truly unthinkable. 
But many of the Federal Govern-
ment’s actions over the last year have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7061 
October 19, 2021 
shown Americans the real threat it 
poses to freedom and simply to com-
mon sense. Remember, this is the ad-
ministration that has forced our 2- 
year-olds to wear masks for hours at a 
time on airplanes, buses, trains, and in 
bus depots, train stations, and air-
ports—2-year-olds. For any parent out 
there or for anyone who has ever actu-
ally 
interacted 
with 
a 
2-year-old 
human, you can certainly understand 
how absurd this is, especially when our 
peer nations have recognized there is 
no need to mask a 2-year-old. 
But back to the mandate for a 
minute. If we think through this dis-
turbing possibility of forced medical 
treatment as a condition precedent for 
visiting family in another State or 
traveling for business reasons or trav-
eling for any reason at all from one 
State to another, the impacts are 
clear, and they are devastating. Busi-
nesses already hard-hit by the pan-
demic—the travel and hospitality sec-
tors—would, 
of 
course, 
be 
further 
strained; collateral damage, I suppose, 
on the part of those who would push 
such an oppressive move. 
Individuals could be marooned in 
States or they couldn’t work, couldn’t 
go to restaurants, and couldn’t leave. 
And the social capital built from face- 
to-face interactions would be further 
set back. 
I believe vaccines are generally safe, 
and they help protect people from the 
harms of contracting COVID–19. I have 
in the past and I still now continue to 
encourage people to get the vaccine, 
but we must ask what ends this admin-
istration is willing to go to to cudgel 
Americans 
to 
this 
state-sponsored 
health edict. 
I am personally uncomfortable with 
such sweeping mandates, but, more im-
portantly, I am required by my oath to 
protect the Constitution of the United 
States to oppose this action. That is 
why I brought forward my latest 
iteration of my efforts against this un-
lawful, unconstitutional, and still in-
choate mandate. My Let Me Travel 
America Act would clarify the law and 
prohibit the Federal Government from 
mandating 
that 
Americans 
receive 
shots against COVID–19 as a pre-
requisite for interstate travel. 
I am grateful that my colleagues, 
Senators TUBERVILLE, BRAUN, and SUL-
LIVAN, have joined me as cosponsors of 
this bill. 
This is a commonsense, practical, 
reasonable bill, one that would simply 
provide assurance and protection to 
millions of Americans whose rights are 
under attack. 
Moments ago, I came here, and I 
asked unanimous consent that we pass 
this bill today with the understanding 
that I am going to continue to come 
back day after day, as long as it takes, 
to address what the President is doing. 
The Senate had a chance to protect 
the American people from yet another 
unconstitutional overreach. It is dis-
appointing to me, really, that my 
friend and colleague, the Senator from 
Washington, chose to object to its 
adoption. 
This shouldn’t be controversial. It is 
really not controversial among the 
American people. I guarantee you, you 
take a poll asking people should the 
Federal Government ever be able to 
tell you that you can’t travel inter-
state unless you receive a particular 
medical treatment, there is no way the 
American people would think that is a 
good idea because it is not, because it 
is absurd, and because it violates ev-
erything that we believe in. 
Now, my friend and colleague, the 
distinguished 
Senator 
from 
Wash-
ington, made the point that such meas-
ures can’t be enacted because, accord-
ing to her, they supposedly undermine 
vaccine efforts. Do you know what un-
dermines the vaccine effort? What un-
dermines the vaccine effort is when 
you try to use the overpowering cudgel 
of coercive force, a type and a level of 
coercive force that no other entity on 
planet Earth can wield more strongly 
than the Federal Government—you use 
that cudgel to tell people who haven’t 
gotten it yet: You must get this. 
Look, a lot of people have been get-
ting the vaccine. Yes, there are some 
holdouts, and they have their reasons 
for being holdouts. There are a lot of 
ways that you can convince someone to 
do something that they don’t currently 
want to do. One of the things that is 
going to make it far less likely that 
they get the vaccine is for them to be 
told that they are being threatened 
with their jobs. It is not how you win. 
Even if it were that we could somehow 
chalk this up as a win here, that is not 
who we are; that is not how we play. 
And this is unprecedented. Make no 
mistake, the Federal Government has 
never undertaken anything like this. 
States and political subdivisions of 
States—meaning cities, towns, coun-
ties, so forth—States and their subdivi-
sions 
have 
general 
police 
powers, 
meaning broad power to protect health, 
safety, and welfare; to protect life, lib-
erty, and property in whatever manner 
they deem appropriate, subject, of 
course, to such limitations as may be 
placed on them either by their State 
Constitution or by the U.S. Constitu-
tion. 
But States and their subdivisions 
have the ability to enact legislation 
like this—health, safety, welfare legis-
lation—in a way that the Federal Gov-
ernment doesn’t. We have to act pursu-
ant to one of the enumerated powers in 
the Constitution. 
I challenge anyone to identify what 
source of authority can fairly be said 
to give the Federal Government this 
kind of power. It doesn’t exist. We have 
never exercised this power with respect 
to the U.S. population at large. It is a 
different thing entirely to point to vac-
cine requirements that we have had for 
certain Federal personnel, including 
our military servicemembers. We have 
never done anything like this. If we 
were to ever consider something like 
this at a Federal level, I would have 
grave concerns with it because I don’t 
think it is the prerogative of the Fed-
eral Government. 
But I can tell you one thing, I am 
darn certain we would never give one 
person the authority to impose such a 
mandate. No, that is not how our con-
stitutional system works. There are a 
lot of reasons why we no longer fly the 
Union Jack. A lot of them had to do 
with what happens when you have a 
dangerous accumulation of power in 
the hands of a few. That is one of the 
reasons why we put in place a rigid set 
of requirements saying that before you 
change the legal status quo, before you 
pass a law, you have to run it through 
Congress. Any Federal law, assuming it 
is acting in an area within the Federal 
Government’s power and authority and 
jurisdiction, it can’t become law, Fed-
eral law, until you run it through the 
House, run the same language through 
the Senate. Then you present it to the 
President for an opportunity for veto, 
signature, or acquiescence. Without 
going through that process, you have 
not made a Federal law. 
Look, Harry Truman’s effort to seize 
the entire steel industry in the United 
States was unlawful. It was unconsti-
tutional. And, mercifully, the courts 
were able to dispense of that in a rel-
atively short period of time. 
We don’t even have the luxury of 
going to court in this instance because 
the President hasn’t had the decency 
to show us his work, to tell us what he 
is actually doing. 
Meanwhile, he is bullying corporate 
America to do his dirty work for him. 
Corporate America is dutifully com-
plying in some cases, perhaps out of al-
legiance or a desire to appear compli-
ant with the President’s wishes; in 
other instances, just for more practical 
reasons. They don’t want to be stuck 
with the heavy fines that may be levied 
against them if they are caught flat- 
footed and unprepared for what may be 
coming. So they are doing the Presi-
dent’s dirty work for him. They are 
doing the firing, rendering people un-
employed, unemployable, and in some 
cases ineligible even to receive unem-
ployment. 
Shame on him and shame on us if we 
don’t call this out for what it is, which 
is 
an 
aggressive, 
unconstitutional, 
baseless power grab. 
My friend and distinguished col-
league, the Senator from Washington, 
also pointed to what she referred to as 
tailored exemptions to the vaccine 
mandate. 
What exemptions? 
There is no mandate. There are no 
exemptions. Yeah, he has spoken in as-
pirational terms about certain exemp-
tions that would be available, but cor-
porate America doesn’t know what 
they are. And so corporate America, 
acting on the advice of counsel, is un-
derstandably being very aggressive, 
erring on the side of firing more people 
and rendering more people unemployed 
and unemployable, and in many cases 
rendering them incapable of receiving 
unemployment.

So, no. No. Don’t tell me these are 
tailored exemptions, when there aren’t 
even exemptions. In order for it to be 
an exemption, you have got to have a 
mandate. There is no mandate. There 
is just the threatened use of the man-
date that is making corporate America 
decide that it is in its best interest to 
do the President’s dirty work for him, 
and in a way that protects him from 
being questioned on legal, meritorious 
grounds in court. 
And if we can’t muster the legislative 
will to defend that power which is 
rightfully ours—not ours in the sense 
that we personally own it, but it has 
been given to the people, the power to 
make sure that laws are passed only by 
their elected Representatives and Sen-
ators—we can’t stand up for this, 
shame on us. 
And if we can’t stand up for even a 
further encroachment on that power 
and on the corresponding right that 
the American people have long come to 
depend upon, to be able to travel inter-
state without undue hindrance or in-
terference from their government, it is 
a sad outcome, one that I can’t coun-
tenance. That is why I am going to be 
back day after day, as long as it takes. 
The American people expect more. The 
American people deserve better.

JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
week, the Senate will consider Chris-
tine O’Hearn’s nomination for the U.S. 
District Court for the District of New 
Jersey. 
Ms. O’Hearn is eminently qualified to 
be a district court judge. 
She has nearly 30 years of experience 
as a litigator in private practice. Dur-
ing that time, she has tried numerous 
cases to verdict and has completed 
more than 150 trial days as lead coun-
sel. 
Ms. O’Hearn has worked on both the 
plaintiff and defense sides of complex 
civil litigation matters, with her core 
focus being employment law. 
In addition to representing individual 
clients, Ms. O’Hearn has represented 
both private and public entities, in-
cluding a number of county and munic-
ipal governments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7063 
October 19, 2021 
Throughout her career, Ms. O’Hearn 
has also given back to the legal com-
munity. For example, she has served on 
the New Jersey Supreme Court’s Com-
mittee on the Unauthorized Practice of 
Law; the U.S. Magistrate Judge Selec-
tion Committee for Camden, NJ; and 
the New Jersey Supreme Court District 
IV Ethics Committee. 
While serving on the New Jersey Su-
preme Court’s Ethics Committee, Ms. 
O’Hearn devoted hundreds of hours— 
pro bono—to prosecuting an attorney 
for violating the New Jersey Rules of 
Professional Conduct. After a 15-day 
trial before a Special Master, the attor-
ney was found to have violated mul-
tiple Rules of Professional Conduct. 
Ms. O’Hearn also briefed and argued 
the case on appeal, where the ruling 
was affirmed. 
Numerous groups and individuals 
have written letters of support for Ms. 
O’Hearn’s nomination, including: the 
New Jersey State Bar Association, the 
Camden County Bar Association, and 
dozens of New Jersey Fellows with the 
American College of Trial Lawyers. 
With her extensive experience, it is 
no surprise that Ms. O’Hearn was 
unanimously rated ‘‘well qualified’’ by 
the American Bar Association. 
Ms. O’Hearn has the strong support 
of her home state Senators, Senators 
MENENDEZ
and BOOKER, and she re-
ceived bipartisan support in the Judici-
ary Committee. 
With decades of legal experience on 
behalf of plaintiffs and defendants 
alike, Ms. O’Hearn is well prepared to 
serve with distinction in the District of 
New Jersey. 
I urge my colleagues to join me vot-
ing in support of her nomination.

REMEMBERING COLONEL JEFFREY 
B. JONES 
Mr. REED. Madam President, today I 
honor one of the most dedicated, self-
less, and accomplished leaders I have 
known, my late classmate, COL Jeff 
Jones. 
Jeff passed away in 2010 after a he-
roic battle with brain cancer, but his 
legacy will be engraved in steel this 
November when the Army names its 
new Psychological Operations Head-
quarters Building in Fort Bragg, NC, 
for him. Colonel Jones dedicated his 
life and career to our national defense, 
and this tribute could not be more fit-
ting. 
Jeff and I were classmates at West 
Point. When you first met Jeff, you 
knew he had special talents. While my 
other classmates and I were struggling 
just to pass inspection, Jeff was lead-
ing rifle drill and ceremony to perfec-
tion, honed by his years of military 
academy upbringing in Georgia. He was 
a natural, inspiring leader, and we all 
looked up to him. As cadets and later 
as officers, Jeff exemplified everything 
we strived to be as members of the 
Long Grey Line, always representing 
what was best and most noble about 
West Point, the Army, and America. 
He was the epitome of ‘‘Duty, Honor, 
Country.’’ 
We graduated together in 1971, and 
Jeff began his career as an infantry of-
ficer in the 509th Airborne in Germany, 
where he climbed the Matterhorn and 
trained with British and French air-
borne troops. He later commanded an 
infantry company at Fort Ord, CA, and 
met his wonderful wife Pamela along 
the way. His career moved swiftly, 
serving as aide-de-camp to some of the 
top generals of the day and earning ad-
vanced degrees from prestigious insti-
tutions. Presciently, while serving on 
the staff of the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for International Security Af-
fairs, he authored the study recom-
mending the creation of U.S. Central 
Command. 
Jeff also embarked on several inter-
national tours, including with the U.N. 
Truce Supervision Organization in Leb-
anon following the Beirut bombings 
and working with the U.S.-Soviet Nu-
clear Arms Control and Space Negotia-
tions in Geneva in the 1980s. 
He especially imparted his leadership 
through his command of the 8th Psy-
chological Operations Battalion and 
later the 4th PSYOP Group, both at 
Fort Bragg. Under his command, mili-
tary and civilian teams deployed across 
more than 60 countries on six con-
tinents, 
gathering 
key 
intelligence 
throughout peacetime, crisis, war, hu-
manitarian, refugee, and counterdrug 
operations. 
Jeff finally retired from Active Duty 
in 2001, after his final assignment as a 
defense attache in Paris, but his retire-
ment was short-lived as 9/11 struck just 
months later. He was requested to 
serve on the NSC in a civilian capacity 
in the Office of Combating Terrorism 
and subsequently in the Defense Policy 
and Arms Control Directorate, and he 
served with distinction. 
In 2006, Jeff was diagnosed with brain 
cancer. He battled for years, even as he 
continued to work and contribute to 
our national security. With Pam by his 
side, he passed away in 2010 and was 
posthumously inducted into the Spe-
cial Operations Command’s Commando 
Hall of Honor in 2013. 
Jeff had a quiet, fearless strength 
that was powerful when you were in his 
presence. I consider myself extremely 
fortunate to have served alongside him 
and to have learned from his intellect, 
skill, character, and his love and devo-
tion to Pam. And I am proud to have 
known him as my friend. 
The Army’s new ‘‘Colonel Jeffrey 
Jones Psychological Operations Head-
quarters’’ bears the name of a great 
man, and I know great things will be 
achieved there. 
I am proud to honor the legacy of 
Colonel Jones, and I know the Members 
of the Senate will join me in recog-
nizing the incredible contributions he 
made for our Nation.

TRIBUTE TO KOBYE NOEL 
Mr. 
OSSOFF. 
Madam 
President, 
today let the Senate recognize the re-
tirement of Ms. Kobye Noel, a public 
servant who has worked for 23 years in 
the U.S. Senate. 
Ms. Noel served for over a decade 
with the Senate Budget Committee. 
She has also worked for Senator Kent 
Conrad, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, Sen-
ator Doug Jones, and for me and for 
Senator Reverend RAPHAEL WARNOCK. 
Her leadership has shaped the work of 
the Senate for longer than most of us 
have been here. To that, we owe Ms. 
Noel a tremendous debt. 
Ms. Noel was instrumental in estab-
lishing Senator Reverend WARNOCK’s 
and my offices this year. Her expertise 
and hard work have served Georgians 
to the highest standard. 
For her colleagues, Ms. Noel has been 
a source of reassurance and generosity. 
She consistently lends a helping hand 
to others. 
Ms. Noel’s skill, commitment, and 
heart for service will be irreplicable on 
my team. Ms. Noel will be dearly 
missed, but has become a lifelong 
friend for so many of us. 
On behalf of the Senate, I express our 
heartfelt gratitude for Ms. Noel’s serv-
ice. 
Thank you for sharing your bril-
liance with us, Ms. Noel. You embody 
the promise and integrity that should 
define the U.S. Senate.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mrs. 
SHAHEEN, 
Mrs. 
GILLI-
BRAND, 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, 
Ms. 
HASSAN, and Mr. BLUMENTHAL): 
S. 
2994. 
A 
bill 
to 
list 
certain 
perfluoroalkyl 
and 
polyfluoroalkyl 
substances as hazardous air pollutants, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Environment and Public 
Works. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the Prevent Release of 
Toxics Emissions, Contamination, and 
Transfer Act. The PROTECT Act would 
add certain PFAS chemicals to the list 
of hazardous air pollutants under the 
Clean Air Act. 
The Environmental Working Group 
recently identified nearly 30,000 poten-
tial industrial dischargers of PFAS 
into the air and water. Yet there are 
currently no restrictions on industrial 
PFAS 
discharges 
under 
the 
Clean 
Water Act or the Clean Air Act, leav-
ing communities vulnerable to the dev-
astating impacts of PFAS pollution. 
While it is well documented how 
toxic PFAS chemicals are prevalent in 
the water supply, it is less well known 
that PFAS chemicals are also emitted 
into the air. 
This legislation would add PFOA, 
PFOS, PFBS, and GenX to the list of 
hazardous 
air 
pollutants 
regulated 
under section 112(b) of the Clean Air 
Act. It would also direct the EPA to 
create a list of categories of major 
sources and area sources that emit 
PFAS within 2 years and give the EPA 
a 5-year deadline to finalize the subse-
quent regulations. 
The EPA has acknowledged that ‘‘air 
emissions of PFAS from industrial 
sources is now recognized as a signifi-
cant route for PFAS releases to the en-
vironment and is evidenced by deposi-
tion as well as their presence in rain-
water.’’ Yet PFAS air emissions aren’t 
currently regulated under the Clean 
Air Act or any other anti-pollution 
law. 
Adding PFAS to the EPA’s hazardous 
air pollutants list would build upon 
work done by States to limit air emis-
sions from industrial facilities and 
greatly expand the number of facilities 
that would have to adopt technology to 
reduce PFAS emissions. 
I thank my colead Senator SHAHEEN 
for her tireless leadership fighting 
PFAS contamination and protecting 
vulnerable communities and Congress-
woman STEVENS for successfully shep-
herding this legislation through the 
House. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to enact the PROTECT Act 
as quickly as possible.

FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF OCTOBER 2021 
AS ‘‘NATIONAL YOUTH JUSTICE 
ACTION MONTH’’ 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 423 
Whereas the historical role of the juvenile 
court system is to rehabilitate and treat 
young people while holding them account-
able and maintaining public safety, and the 
juvenile court system is therefore better 
equipped to work with youth than the adult 
criminal justice system, which is punitive in 
nature; 
Whereas youth are developmentally dif-
ferent from adults, and those differences 
have been— 
(1) documented by research on the adoles-
cent brain; and 
(2) acknowledged by the Supreme Court of 
the United States, State supreme courts, and 
many State and Federal laws that prohibit 
youth under the age of 18 from taking on 
major adult responsibilities such as voting, 
jury duty, and military service; 
Whereas youth who are placed under the 
commitment of the juvenile court system 
are able to access age-appropriate services 
and education and remain closer to their 
families, which reduces the likelihood that 
those youth will commit offenses in the fu-
ture; 
Whereas every year in the United States 
an estimated 76,000 youths are tried, sen-
tenced, or incarcerated as adults, and most 
of those youth are prosecuted for nonviolent 
offenses; 
Whereas most laws allowing the prosecu-
tion of youth as adults were enacted before 
the publication of research-based evidence 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention and the Office of Juvenile Justice 
and Delinquency Prevention of the Depart-
ment of Justice demonstrating that pros-
ecuting youth in adult court actually de-
creases public safety as, on average, youth 
prosecuted in adult court are 34 percent 
more likely to commit future crimes than 
youth retained in the juvenile court system; 
Whereas youth of color, youth with disabil-
ities, and youth with mental health issues 
are disproportionately represented at all 
stages of the criminal justice system; 
Whereas it is harmful to public safety and 
to young people in the legal system to con-
fine youth in adult jails or prisons where 
they are significantly more likely to be 
physically and sexually assaulted and often 
placed in solitary confinement; 
Whereas youth sentenced as adults receive 
an adult criminal record that hinders future 
education and employment opportunities; 
Whereas youth who receive extremely long 
sentences deserve an opportunity to dem-
onstrate their potential to grow and change; 
and 
Whereas, in October, people around the 
United States participate in Youth Justice 
Action Month to increase public awareness 
of the need to protect the constitutional 
rights of youth, establish a minimum age for 
arresting children, remove youth from adult 
courts and prisons, and end the practice of 
sentencing children to life, and de facto life, 
without parole and to provide people across 
the United States with an opportunity to de-
velop action-oriented events in their commu-
nities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) acknowledges that the collateral con-
sequences normally applied in the adult 
criminal justice system should not auto-
matically apply to youth arrested for crimes 
before the age of 18; 
(2) expresses support for the designation of 
October 2021 as ‘‘National Youth Justice Ac-
tion Month’’; 
(3) recognizes and supports the goals and 
ideals of National Youth Justice Action 
Month; and 
(4) recognizes the importance of and en-
courages the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention of the Department 
of Justice to fully implement the Juvenile 
Justice Reform Act of 2018 (Public Law 115– 
385; 132 Stat. 5123) in a manner in keeping 
with the spirit and intent of the law.

ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. KING. Madam President, the 
United States of America is an anom-
aly in world history. We are a 245-year 
experiment in self-government, which 
is based upon an idea that was radical 
in 1776. It was tested at Gettysburg, 
Antietam, Shiloh, and the Wilderness. 
It was defended at Anzio, Iwo Jima, 
and Normandy, and was reaffirmed in 
1965. It is an idea that the people—all 
the people—are the ultimate source of 
power 
and 
can 
govern 
themselves 
through their elected representatives. 
That was a radical notion in 1776. 
The historical norm is just the oppo-
site—kings; pharaohs; dictators; czars; 
warlords; emperors; and, more re-
cently, presidents for life. Throughout 
most of human history, and right up to 
the present day, in most countries, the 
people have little or no say in the deci-
sions that determine their fate. And 
these rulers are rarely, if ever, benefi-
cent. In fact, again, the historical 
norm is just the opposite—pervasive 
corruption, the pursuit of power for its 
own sake, the crushing of dissent, 
sham elections, and the abuse or even 
elimination of anyone not sufficiently 
loyal or useful to the leader. That is 
the historical norm. 
There is nothing surprising about 
this because it reflects human nature. 
History fairly shouts at us that power 
corrupts, and absolute power corrupts 
absolutely. 
Given the consistent history of this 
experience—of 
warlords, 
dictators, 
czars, and the abuse of their author-
ity—it is clear that what we are doing, 
this experiment, is fragile. It is not the 
norm. It is an anomaly. What we have 
and take for granted is in no way guar-
anteed. As has been the case for demo-
cratic experiments throughout history, 
it can fail. Rarely can it fail from ex-
ternal attack. Almost always, demo-
cratic experiments fail from erosion 
from within. 
On the surface, our democratic sys-
tem protects us by resting upon our in-
genuous Constitution, the primary pur-
pose of which is to establish an effec-
tive government while at the same 
time dividing and dispersing power, 
and in Madison’s evocative phrase: 
Obliging the government to control 
itself. 
And of all the safeguards built into 
the Constitution—and there are many; 
two Houses of Congress, vetoes, divi-
sion of the war power, advise and con-
sent, enumerated powers, Federalism, 
the Bill of Rights—of all of those pro-
tections, the most fundamental and es-
sential is regular elections, the clear-
est expression of the people’s will. 
For most of my life, I have not really 
thought much about how elections ac-
tually work. You go to the town office 
or the school gym, they cross your 
name off on a list, hand you a ballot, 
and you go into a booth and make your

choice. You then put the marked ballot 
into a box or hand it to a clerk—usu-
ally it is a volunteer doing their civic 
duty in my hometown—and then they 
run it through a counter. Or you can 
get a mail-in ballot from your town 
clerk, mark it at home and send it in. 
Or in my town you can drop it in a drop 
box anytime of the night or day. It is 
out in the front of the town office. 
That is it until later that night, 
when the results—either from auto-
matic counters or from hand counting 
the ballots themselves—are announced, 
precinct by precinct, town by town, 
city by city, and State by State. 
And then you go to bed, happy or un-
happy, energized or discouraged, either 
reveling in the victory of your pre-
ferred candidates or determined to 
work harder next time. And thanks to 
the Framers, there always is a next 
time, usually in 2 years hence. 
The next day, you go about your 
business trusting—trusting—that the 
system was operating according to the 
rules and that the announced vote 
count accurately reflects the pref-
erence of you and your fellow citizens. 
The key word is ‘‘trust.’’ 
The miraculous result of this entire 
process is something we completely 
take for granted but is exceedingly 
rare—exceedingly rare—in human his-
tory: the peaceful transfer of power, 
whether it is the city council, the Con-
gress, or the Presidency itself. 
But two interrelated things are hap-
pening right now with regard to this 
system that are unprecedented in my 
lifetime and have caused me to worry 
as I never have before about the future 
of my country. These two things are 
profoundly dangerous to our fragile Re-
public. 
One is the breakdown of trust in the 
system itself and the other is an overt-
ly partisan attempt to use this loss of 
trust as a pretext to change the results 
of future elections by limiting the par-
ticipation of voters deemed unworthy— 
although that is rarely said out loud— 
or unlikely to vote for your particular 
political party. 
This discussion is usually framed in 
terms of election integrity—the pre-
vention of widespread voter fraud— 
which it is argued is tainting the out-
come of our elections. 
Unfortunately, these so-called elec-
tion integrity measures almost invari-
ably end up limiting the participation 
of a substantial number of voters, 
many of whom have historically been 
denied the right to vote by one device 
or another for over 100 years. It is lim-
iting that participation either as inad-
vertent collateral damage or, more 
likely, as stone-cold partisan voter 
suppression. 
When I used to interact with the 
main legislature either as a private cit-
izen for many years or as Governor, the 
inevitable first question from the chair 
of the committee was: What is the 
problem we are trying to solve here? 
You want to change the law; what is 
the problem we are trying to solve? In 
this case, is the problem really voter 
fraud, or is it election results the party 
in power in a particular State doesn’t 
like? 
The implicit burden that this ques-
tion puts upon those who would change 
a law is to demonstrate by some rea-
sonable and credible evidence that 
there is a problem in the first place. 
And simply saying—or endlessly re-
peating—that 
there 
is 
a 
problem 
doesn’t make it so. To put it another 
way, repeating a lie doesn’t make it 
true. 
Every objective study to try to de-
tect widespread voter fraud in this 
country has failed to produce credible 
evidence of anything but scattered and 
vanishingly rare cases. I am not saying 
it doesn’t exist, but they are scattered 
and vanishingly rare cases. 
Even the overtly partisan so-called 
‘‘audit’’ of the votes in Maricopa Coun-
ty, AZ, failed to find what they were so 
desperately looking for—failed to find 
what they were so desperately looking 
for. 
The key question is not whether such 
fraud exists at all but whether it is so 
widespread as to change the results of 
an election involving a substantial 
number of voters. 
In the wake of the 2016 election, the 
President convened a commission to 
assess this very question, but the com-
mission was disbanded within 8 months 
with no published finding of significant 
election fraud whatsoever. That was 
their mission—to find fraud—and they 
couldn’t find it. 
Further, as I mentioned, I know of no 
objective study that has ever concluded 
that such widespread fraud exists any-
where in our country. 
Even more compelling is that in spite 
of Herculean efforts by the former 
President and his supporters over the 
course of the months following the 2020 
election, no credible evidence has yet 
been produced to support his allega-
tions, and all of the allegations have 
been rejected by every court—more 
than 60. They have been rejected by 
every court that has considered it. The 
only fraud here is the allegations 
themselves. 
In other words, not only is there no 
evidence of substantial fraud, what evi-
dence there is reaches the opposite con-
clusion. But here is the problem; here 
is what is chilling. Fully, one-third of 
Americans and two-thirds of members 
of the Republican Party now believe 
that the 2020 Presidential election was 
not legitimate, that there was wide-
spread fraud, and that the election was 
somehow stolen—not based upon evi-
dence, because there isn’t any, but 
based upon the repeated assertions of 
the former President and his sup-
porters. 
The problem with this goes well be-
yond the wave of voter suppression leg-
islation that is sweeping the country. 
The deeper problem is the massive and 
unprecedented erosion of trust in the 
electoral system itself, the beating 
heart of our democracy. Of all the 
depravations of the former President, 
this is by far the worst. 
In relentlessly pursuing his narrow 
self-interest, he has grievously wound-
ed democracy itself. And, by the way, I 
mean ‘‘narrow self-interest’’ quite lit-
erally. He doesn’t give the slightest 
damn about any of us, about any of us 
in this body. He will cast any or all of 
us aside whenever it suits his needs of 
the moment. Everyone in this room 
knows this to be true. 
The reason this is so destructive is 
that if you can’t trust elections, what 
are your options? What are your op-
tions for making the transcendent de-
cisions upon which our society is 
based? 
One is to change the rules to discour-
age your perceived enemies from vot-
ing. Check—that is in the works. 
Another is to change the rules to 
give partisan legislators the power to 
override election results they don’t 
like. Check—also in the works. 
Another is to contrive pseudo legal 
arguments to justify the corruption of 
the counting of electoral votes and 
then to pressure the Vice President, 
who presides over the counting of the 
electoral votes, to join in the scheme. 
Check—we now know this was very 
much in the works in the days leading 
up to January 6. 
Or, finally, tragically, try to change 
the results if you don’t trust elections 
through violence or threats of violence. 
Check—January 6 and death threats to 
election officials of both parties across 
the country. 
January 6 was not a random day on 
the calendar. It was the day appointed 
by law to finalize the results of the No-
vember election. Many of those who 
came to Washington that day were not 
there to protest but were there with 
the explicit purpose of disrupting and 
stopping this crucial final step in our 
democratic process. 
The rallying cry that day was not 
‘‘protest the steal.’’ It was ‘‘stop the 
steal.’’ And that is exactly what was 
attempted in this room on January 6. 
It is important to remember that 
most failures of democracy, as we look 
at history, started with legitimate 
elections. But once in office, the leader 
manipulated the electoral process to 
consolidate their hold on power, just as 
was attempted last winter. And once 
power is seized, the control and reach 
of the modern surveillance state is 
truly terrifying, truly terrifying. Ask 
the Uighurs in China or members of the 
opposition in Russia, if you can find 
any alive. 
Russia, Turkey, Venezuela, and Hun-
gary are all examples of the slide from 
democracy into authoritarianism that 
has happened just in our living mem-
ory, just in our lifetimes. This is not a 
theoretical threat. We have seen it al-
ready happen in our lifetimes. Those 
countries still have elections, but they 
don’t mean much. 
And what if the current wave of voter 
suppression legislation succeeds and 
keeps tens or hundreds of thousands of

people from voting in 2022 or 2024? Or 
what if in 2024 a partisan legislature in 
a swing State—and they are giving 
themselves this power right now—votes 
to override the election results in their 
State and send their own preferred set 
of electors to Washington? Then it 
won’t just be Republicans who distrust 
elections, and we will be left with a 
downward spiral toward a hollow shell 
of democracy, where only raw power 
prevails and a peaceful transfer be-
comes a distant memory. 
There has been a great deal of talk in 
recent weeks and months of a possible 
constitutional crisis in 2022 or 2024. We 
don’t have to wait that long. We are in 
the midst of such a crisis right now. 
One of our great political parties has 
embraced the idea that our last elec-
tion was fraudulent, that our current 
President is illegitimate, that they 
must move legislatures across the 
country to ‘‘fix’’ the results—to ‘‘fix’’ 
the results—of future elections. 
Here is the part that I think is the 
most tragic. A substantial portion of 
our population has lost faith in our 
democratic system because they have 
been repeatedly told that something 
important was stolen from them, even 
though that is untrue. And that por-
tion of our population seems prepared 
to 
accept 
some 
version 
of 
authoritarianism. All but the most ex-
treme sources of information have been 
devalued, and violence bubbles just 
below the surface. 
But it doesn’t have to be this way. 
We in this body, perhaps more than 
anyone else in this country, have the 
power to change direction, to pull our 
country back from the brink, and to 
begin the work of restoring our democ-
racy, as we did in the Revolution, as we 
did in the Civil War, and as we did in 
the civil rights struggles of 60 years 
ago—first, by simply telling the truth 
and then by enacting a set of basic pro-
tections of the sacred right to vote. 
It won’t be easy, and it will involve 
risk. I am aware of that. I understand 
that. It will be particularly difficult 
when we are asked to speak hard truths 
that many of our most ardent sup-
porters don’t want to hear. But the al-
ternative is worse, worse even than los-
ing your job in this body. The alter-
native is the loss of our identity as a 
people, the loss of the miracle of self- 
government, the loss of the idea of 
America. 
I don’t think it is an exaggeration to 
say that we are at a hinge of history, 
that circumstances have thrust us— 
those of us in this body—into a mo-
ment when the fate of the American 
experiment hangs in the balance. 
We are the heirs and trustees—I em-
phasize ‘‘trustees’’—of a tradition that 
goes back to Jefferson and Lincoln, to 
Webster, 
Madison, 
Margaret 
Chase 
Smith, and, yes, our friend John 
McCain. All of them were partisans in 
one way or another, but all shared an 
overriding commitment to the idea 
that animates the American experi-
ment, the idea that our government is 
of, by, and for the people—all the peo-
ple. 
Lincoln thought that the most im-
portant word in the Declaration of 
Independence was ‘‘all.’’ ‘‘All men are 
created equal’’—all, all the people. 
Now is the moment that we are 
called upon to reach beyond our region, 
our State, our party, ourselves to save 
and reinvigorate the sputtering flame 
of the American idea. 
Yes, democracy is an anomaly in 
world history. We have to remember 
that what we have is unusual. It is 
rare, and it is fragile. It rests upon the 
Constitution and laws, to be sure, but 
it also rests even more on the trust our 
people place in our democratic system 
and in us. 
Deliberately undermining that trust 
for 
short-term 
political 
advantage, 
which is exactly what is happening 
right now—undermining that trust for 
political advantage in the short term is 
exactly what is happening right now— 
is a tragic and dangerous game. 
No election, no endorsement, no Sen-
ate seat, no Presidency is worth it. 
Nothing is worth destroying what our 
forebears fought and died for—nothing. 
Several 
weeks 
ago, 
a 
bipartisan 
group of us went to Gettysburg and 
walked the battlefield with two leaders 
from the Army War College. I have 
been there before but have never been 
so moved by the experience as I was on 
this trip. The stories of valor and su-
preme sacrifice—the 20th Maine on Lit-
tle Round Top, you know that I would 
mention that; the 1st Minnesota at the 
exposed center of the Union line; the 
Iron Brigade on the first day; the colos-
sal losses on both sides, unimaginable 
losses on both sides in a matter of 3 
days—were a sobering reminder of 
what it took to preserve this country. 
But we learned something else that 
day—that it was a near thing. If a 
Union officer named Strong Vincent 
had hesitated in moving those three 
regiments to the top of Little Round 
Top, or if an officer from Minnesota 
named William Colvill had hesitated in 
leading the 1st Minnesota on a suicidal 
charge—82-percent casualties, a suici-
dal charge—into the teeth of the Con-
federate advance, our country would 
have been lost. It was a near thing. It 
never had struck me so hard as it did 
at Gettysburg several weeks ago. 
And so it is today—a near thing— 
only, the test is not on the battlefield, 
and no one here is being asked to give 
up their lives. We are simply being 
asked to tell the truth, to recommit to 
the ideal of democracy, to keep faith 
with our history and our inheritance. 
And if we hesitate, all could be lost. 
This is not speculation. All could be 
lost. 
And we now know from the events of 
January 6 and the relentless attempts 
to subvert the results of the 2020 elec-
tion in the last days of the prior ad-
ministration, it was and still is a near 
thing. 
That is what is so chilling and fright-
ening. As it is in the old Protestant 
hymn I remember from my youth, so it 
is today: 
Once to every man and nation comes the 
moment to decide. 
I believe that this is that moment for 
each of us. The concluding words of 
Lincoln in his message to Congress in 
the dark winter of 1862 have never been 
more apt. They are eerily applicable to 
us today. Here is what Abraham Lin-
coln said: 
Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. 
We of this Congress and this administration, 
will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No 
personal significance, or insignificance, can 
spare one or another of us. The fiery trial 
through which we pass, will light us down, in 
honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. 
In honor or dishonor, to the latest 
generation. Indeed, destiny has placed 
us here at one of history’s fateful mo-
ments. Our response to it will be our 
most important legacy. Of all the other 
things that we have done, this moment 
will be our most important legacy. 
I believe we all know our responsi-
bility. And whether we like it or not, 
history will record whether we—each 
one of us—meets that responsibility. 
Madam President, may God, working 
through each of us, save the United 
States of America. 
I yield the floor.

THE ECONOMY 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am here on the floor this evening to 
talk about the troubling state of our 
economy today and what needs to be 
done to get it back on track. The Labor 
Department reported last week that 
the consumer price index, CPI, rose by 
5.4 percent on an annualized basis. 
That accounts for the largest year-to- 
year inflationary increase in 13 years. 
And we are feeling it. There is no 
question inflation is on the rise. We are 
paying more for everything—from gro-
ceries, to buying furniture, to cars, 
even pumpkins for Halloween. Yes, the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture just 
told us that pumpkins, year to year, 
are going to see an, on average, 15.7- 
percent increase in prices. So you 
might have to get a little smaller 
pumpkin this year. 
And, of course, we are paying more at 
the pump, on average, a staggering 42- 
percent increase this year—42-percent 
increase. This is both because of in-
creased demand but also because there 
is less supply as the new administra-
tion, the Biden administration, has put 
more 
regulations 
or 
handcuffs 
on 
American energy production. 
And don’t forget the higher heating 
bills, about 25 percent higher this year 
as compared to last year. Just as this 
cooler weather begins to come in, we 
are all going to be paying more on our 
utility bills, particularly for natural 
gas. 
If all this isn’t bad enough, workers’ 
wages are not keeping up with these 
price spikes. I love to see wages going

up, but honestly, if you look at the 
data, it says that since President Biden 
took office, wages after inflation, ad-
justed for inflation, are down almost 2 
percent—1.9 percent lower. 
Remember, 
before 
the 
pandemic 
started, in February of 2020, we had the 
19th straight month of wage increases 
of 3 percent or more on an annualized 
basis, well above inflation. Now, we are 
seeing just the opposite. This means a 
pay cut to the middle class. 
The damaging effect of this hidden 
inflation is, in part, the result of ac-
tions that were taken by the Biden ad-
ministration and by Democrats here in 
Congress to overheat the economy 
through unprecedented levels of gov-
ernment spending. 
What do I mean by that? Well, you 
will recall that economist and former 
Secretary of the Treasury in the Clin-
ton and Obama administrations, Larry 
Summers, said earlier this year, as 
Democrats were talking about this 
huge new spending bill that they ended 
up passing without a single Republican 
input or vote in March, he said: If you 
do this, it is going to cause inflation. 
He warned about it because he had seen 
this movie before. 
When you have got an economy that 
is already improving and you overheat 
it with massive amounts of stimulus— 
remember, the $1.9 trillion that was 
spent in March was the highest level 
ever spent. It was the biggest program 
ever passed by either House of Con-
gress, $1.9 trillion. We forget how much 
money that is. 
He recognized that this bill contained 
billions in stimulus money, social serv-
ice spending, the stimulus checks. And 
those were going to fuel the demand 
side of the economy. And they did—not 
just the stimulus checks but other 
things as well: COVID funds to all 
kinds of institutions, a continuing gen-
erous unemployment supplement that 
paid 42 percent of American workers 
more to go on unemployment than to 
go back to work. 
All of this added up to a huge influx 
of social spending, government spend-
ing—borrowed money but government 
spending—into the economy that ev-
eryone who was looking at it objec-
tively, I believe, knew was going to be 
a problem. 
Earlier this year, before the Demo-
crats passed this $1.9 trillion spending 
bill, 
the 
nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office here on Capitol Hill told 
us that the economy was already re-
covering, and that is what outside 
economists were saying as well. Every-
body was looking at the economy and 
saying, you know, in January, Feb-
ruary, going into March, the economy 
was improving nicely. In fact, the Con-
gressional Budget Office—again, non-
partisan group up here—said the econ-
omy is going to get back to its 
prepandemic level by midyear, by June 
30. And it did. 
The 
stimulus 
was 
really 
poorly 
timed. Instead of allowing the recovery 
to continue steadily, it effectively 
poured fuel on an already hot economy, 
which led to the surging inflation we 
are seeing now. The White House likes 
to say that the inflation we are experi-
encing is transitory. That is the word 
that they have been using; in other 
words, it will pass—as Congress passes 
more legislation to fix the economy, I 
suppose. Unfortunately, it has not been 
transitory. 
And I haven’t seen anybody who is 
looking at this objectively say that it 
will be transitory. In fact, I saw an 
analysis today from an outside group, a 
nonpartisan group, that said they are, 
unfortunately, 
convinced 
that 
this 
high inflation is going to continue next 
year as well. I hope that is not true, 
but that seems to be the consensus. 
Economists across the spectrum, even 
the International Monetary Fund, are 
now saying that rising inflation is 
dampening future economic growth. 
You would think all of this would 
cause a policy shift by the administra-
tion, a pulling back on the stimulus, 
doing things to actually help on the 
supply side of the economy. But rather 
than changing course from the policies 
that contributed to this high inflation 
and this demand-side stimulus, Demo-
crats want to double down with a $3.5- 
trillion-plus massive tax-and-spending 
spree that would spend trillions to fund 
social programs, expand government 
entitlements, and encourage more con-
sumer demand, fueling more inflation. 
What makes this proposal even more 
concerning is Democrats want to pay 
for it by hurting the economy more 
with big tax increases. Some say it is 
the biggest tax increase in 50 years. 
Some say it is the largest tax increase 
in history. It depends, I guess, where 
they end up. But we know it will in-
crease taxes on pretty much every-
body. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation 
has done an analysis and said, yes, it is 
going to increase taxes on middle-in-
come workers. Why? Because it in-
creases taxes on businesses and they 
say that about 70 percent of that tax 
increase will be borne by workers. That 
is, again, the nonpartisan Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation. So it is taxes not 
just on businesses, large and small, but 
it is also on workers, on farmers, on 
manufacturers. 
This increased spending, combined 
with job-killing tax increases, could 
lead to the kind of stagflation, low 
growth, high interest rates, high infla-
tion that we had back in the 1970s. We 
hoped never to see that again; yet if we 
don’t change course, we could be head-
ing toward that direction. It is the last 
thing our economy needs right now. 
But surging consumer demand is not 
the only factor driving our current in-
flation crisis. The other main culprit is 
that we are facing a shortage of goods 
due to a global supply chain crisis. Al-
most anyone you talk to will tell you 
they have had some kind of shipping 
delay due to these supply chain issues. 
There are contractors you probably 
know who can’t get lumber, can’t get 
steel to be able to finish a building, a 
home. 
There are plenty of parents out there 
right now waiting to get their kid a 
gift for their birthday, only to find out 
that, no matter how much they pay, it 
is going to arrive not for the birthday 
but maybe 2 or 3 months later. 
These issues are clearly visible if you 
look at our seaports, which are often 
the main connecter between our coun-
try and the main global supply chain, 
consisting of manufacturers often in 
Asia, sometimes in China. Just last 
week, there were about 60 or 70 ships in 
a holding pattern near the ports of 
Long Beach and Los Angeles, CA. 
Think about that: 60 or 70 huge con-
tainer ships just in a holding pattern, 
not being able to get in. 
And even when the shipping con-
tainers are taken on shore, by the way, 
there aren’t enough trucks to pick 
them up. So the containers are staying 
at the port. There aren’t enough truck 
drivers because of the labor shortage. 
By the way, that is driven in part by 
this increased demand but in part by 
some of the rules and regulations 
around those transportation logistics 
and truckers. 
Between bottlenecks and backlogs at 
our ports and challenges in trans-
porting freight, there is real trouble for 
our supply chains just as we come into 
the holiday season, which is typically, 
of course, when people do most of their 
shopping. One reason for this global 
supply chain crisis is the ripple effects 
of COVID–19. No question about that. 
When factories shut down their oper-
ations to stem the flow of COVID 
among their workers, assembly lines 
sometimes stopped working altogether 
and created the shortage of goods and 
materials. 
The companies that work in the ship-
ping industry also were hit hard by the 
pandemic and had some of their oper-
ations negatively impacted. But then 
the pent-up demand for goods and serv-
ices kicked in, and, again, much more 
demand was created by the $1.9 trillion 
spending bill in March of this year 
than would have been normal. 
So, yeah, you had some of these fac-
tories shutting down; you had essential 
workers still working; but you had less 
production and then all of a sudden 
this big surge and, therefore, the bot-
tleneck. 
Some in the Biden administration 
have said that this inflation and supply 
chain bottleneck is a problem for the 
rich. I don’t see it that way. If they 
think that, they ought to talk to the 
factory workers I talked to in Ohio 
whose wages are being eaten up by in-
flation. I think they should say that to 
the mother or father who is having to 
ask their kid what gift they want for 
Christmas 2 or 3 months ahead of time. 
In fact, it is too late already to get 
some gifts for Christmas even now. 
A recent college graduate who is try-
ing to fill her car up with gas to get to 
work—tell it to her that this is a prob-
lem for the rich—a 42-percent increase 
in gas prices this year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7086 
October 19, 2021 
The supply chain is like any other 
chain. If you have one weak link, it is 
enough to cause the whole thing to fall 
apart, and that is exactly what has 
happened, and it is happening at the 
worst possible time. Part of the near- 
term solution is to stop any new stim-
ulus spending. That is not what is 
needed right now in the economy. It is 
just terrible timing. 
And stop the new tax increases be-
cause that is also what we don’t need 
in our economy right now. We don’t 
want to make America and American 
workers less competitive; we want to 
do just the opposite. 
And part of the long-term solution to 
prevent a similar crisis from happening 
in the future is to shore up our supply 
chains. Instead of being so reliant on 
manufacturers from places like China, 
bring the manufacturing home; reshore 
it; invest more in production here in 
the United States. In the process, cre-
ate more domestic manufacturing and 
transport jobs and greater supply chain 
security. 
I think that is going to start hap-
pening. If you look at the cost to bring 
a product from Asia to the United 
States now, it has skyrocketed. That 
gives us a competitive advantage. The 
market is here. We ought to bring the 
manufacturing here as well. 
Another solution is to improve our 
Nation’s infrastructure. Targeted in-
vestments in increasing the capacity 
and operability of our ports, our water-
ways, fixing our roads and bridges, im-
proving our railways, that all makes 
sense. For decades, we have neglected 
our infrastructure needs. Every Presi-
dent, by the way, in modern times has 
said that. 
You know, the society of engineers 
who look at our infrastructure says 
that we have a grade of somewhere be-
tween D-plus and C-minus in this coun-
try. We are falling behind other coun-
tries. Other countries spend a lot more 
as a percent of their GDP on infra-
structure. And it has been recognized. 
Really, every President since from 
Bill Clinton to Donald Trump has said: 
Let’s make a significant investment in 
infrastructure. Yet we didn’t do it. We 
neglected our infrastructure. We have 
neglected our ports, and that is why 
they are so inefficient today in part 
and one reason we are having to pay 
the price. 
The good news is that right now 
there is a bipartisan infrastructure 
package awaiting passage in the House 
of Representatives to address this and 
other problems. It is called the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act. 
This is the bill that passed the U.S. 
Senate here in August with a 69-vote 
majority. That doesn’t happen very 
often around here, particularly with 
big, important legislation like that. 
It was bipartisan from the start. It 
was passed with the support of Repub-
licans here in this Chamber, Democrats 
in this Chamber, and, most impor-
tantly, the American people who think 
it is a really good idea. 
Economists think it is a good idea, 
too, because it improves the efficiency 
of our economy. Think about it. The 
bridge that is holding up traffic right 
now in my hometown of Cincinnati, 
OH, every day—a massive bridge where 
I–71 and 75 come together—it is a huge 
hit to our economy. It is also a huge 
safety problem. Fixing that bridge has 
been something people talked about for 
30 years. It is time to do it, and we will 
do it if we can get this infrastructure 
bill passed. 
It will also create hundreds of thou-
sands of good-paying jobs in industries 
ranging from construction and plumb-
ing to electrical engineering and soft-
ware development, with one recent 
study from the Association of Equip-
ment Manufacturers finding that the 
legislation will create about a half a 
million jobs. 
It will also help address issues at our 
ports by providing increased funding 
for the Port Infrastructure Develop-
ment Program, investments in our 
freight system through rail and water-
way and highway and air freight in-
vestments. So it actually addresses a 
real problem we have right now. 
By the way, these investments are 
long-term investments. It won’t be a 
lot of money spent in the next year or 
so; it will be a lot of money, though, 
spent over the next 5, 10, 15 years to 
improve this infrastructure. And they 
will be long-term assets that will last 
for decades. So it is a different kind of 
spending than the stimulus spending. 
All of this will help improve the 
movement of goods throughout our 
country. That is why every business 
group in America is supporting this 
legislation, not just the chamber of 
commerce but every group out there— 
by the way, as well as all the agri-
culture groups. Over 30 ag groups, in-
cluding the American Farm Bureau, 
are supporting this legislation. It is 
why a lot of the union members are 
supporting it too. In fact, the AFL–CIO 
Building Trades Council is strongly in 
support of this legislation because they 
know it is going to create good-paying 
jobs, good benefits, allowing people to 
get out there and build things. 
Even more importantly, to me, given 
the recent economic news we have 
seen, this proposal will not cause infla-
tion to increase. Why? Because it is 
spending on the supply side rather than 
the demand side of the economy, as 
economists would say. Conservative 
economist Doug Holtz-Eakin, who is 
the former Director of the Congres-
sional Budget Office, now head of the 
American Action Forum, and Michael 
Strain, who is the director of economic 
policy studies at the American Enter-
prise Institute, also a conservative 
scholar, have said that our bipartisan 
infrastructure package will slow down 
inflation. They said: 
Improving roads, bridges, and ports would 
make it less costly for businesses to operate, 
allowing them to increase their output per 
hour and putting downward pressure on con-
sumer prices. 
Again, this is long-term spending 
capital assets. It makes the economy 
more efficient; therefore, more produc-
tive. That is counterinflationary. So 
this is the right time to do this kind of 
project. 
To me, this bill makes all the sense 
in the world, given the trouble and un-
certain stage of our economy. It gets 
relief to our supply chains. It makes 
long-term investments in hard assets 
that do boost our productivity in this 
country. It has a counterinflationary 
effect on the economy. So why hasn’t 
it passed? What is the problem? Again, 
it got 69 votes here in the U.S. Senate. 
Well, unfortunately, the answer is poli-
tics. Democrats in the House of Rep-
resentatives want to do everything 
they can to tie their big $3.5 trillion- 
plus tax-and-spend bill we talked about 
earlier to the infrastructure invest-
ment because they know that is the 
only way their partisan bill is going to 
get the votes needed to pass. So they 
held it hostage. 
Hard-core progressives don’t like the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill because 
it doesn’t have the tax increases; it 
doesn’t haven’t the Green New Deal 
policies; it doesn’t have all the new so-
cial spending programs that are in this 
reconciliation bill that they really 
want. 
But holding this investment in infra-
structure hostage to this larger tax- 
and-spend bill is just wrong. It is play-
ing politics. And it is playing politics 
with the American people. 
It is also counter to the pledge that 
President Biden made to the bipartisan 
group that negotiated this agreement 
and made to the American people. 
President Biden supports this infra-
structure legislation. He said he didn’t 
get everything he wanted. Nobody did. 
But he supports it. He wants it to move 
forward. And he pledged to keep it sep-
arate—separate—from the $3.5 trillion 
tax-and-spend bill, and yet what you 
see in the House is just the opposite. 
It is not fair to the American people. 
They deserve to have the opportunity 
to have the infrastructure bill be voted 
on its own merits. Let it rise or fall on 
its own merits. Don’t tie it to some-
thing else. 
House Speaker NANCY PELOSI prom-
ised it would come to the House floor 
about 6 weeks ago. She promised that 
to the so-called Democrat moderates in 
the House, and it didn’t come to the 
floor. Then she promised it would come 
to the floor 3 weeks ago. It didn’t come 
to the floor for a vote. Now she said, on 
October 2, that October 31 is the date. 
That is Halloween. That is a Sunday. 
But that is fine. We can vote on Sun-
days, even on Halloween. It is so im-
portant, we ought to do it—and do it. 
It is past time to take this bill to the 
floor of the House and let it be judged 
on its own merits. If passed, it will 
strengthen our economy over the long 
term and have a positive impact on the 
lives of every single American. It is 
counterinflationary. 
It 
makes 
our 
economy more efficient. It adds to,

again, the supply side, allowing us to 
see not just a short-term boost but a 
longer term boost to our economy. 
And wouldn’t it be nice to pass some-
thing that makes sense around here 
that is bipartisan? Instead of jamming 
Republicans and the country with an-
other reckless spending bill and raising 
taxes on this uncertain economy, let’s

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT 
RICHARD W. YARLING 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to honor Lieutenant Richard W. 
Yarling, U.S. Navy, retired, of Jarrell, Texas as 
he celebrates his 100th birthday on October 
18. Throughout his long life, LT Yarling has 
exemplified not only the best in service to his 
country, but to his community as well. 
Many go through life wondering if they’ve 
made a difference. LT Yarling doesn’t have 
that problem. During WWII, he bravely served 
in the Navy aboard one of the 175 Fletcher 
Class destroyers, the U.S.S. Chauncey. His 
fearless support of our country’s interests 
abroad serves as a clear testament to his 
dedication to our great nation and to his com-
mitment to serving others. 
After completing years of tremendous serv-
ice to his country, he went on to graduate 
from law school. He continued to serve his 
community, retiring as a Judge Advocate Corp 
officer. His work speaks to the devoted and 
generous spirit of a man who puts the needs 
of others before those of himself. 
Over his incredible life, LT Yarling witnessed 
his nation’s brave soldiers defend freedom on 
foreign shores, watched a humble mid-
westerner take mankind’s first steps on an-
other world, and marveled at technological ad-
vances beyond any of his dreams. He saw 
how America has been defined by extraor-
dinary men and women who fought to make 
our nation a beacon of hope and freedom, al-
ways willing to learn from the past, confront 
the challenges of the present, and hopeful 
enough to embrace a better tomorrow. 
I join LT Yarling’s friends and family in ap-
plauding the work and service he has pro-
vided. I wish him the happiest of birthdays and 
nothing but health and prosperity in the years 
ahead.

HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize me Ali Rapps and her relay team 
for winning the Illinois High School Association 
State Title. 
Addison Pischke ran a strong first leg and 
passed the baton to Alison Bowers. Bowers 
handed the baton to third leg Annie Wirth, and 
the Leafs were in the lead. Wirth increased 
the lead slightly and when the baton came to 
Ali Rapps, she increased the lead and finished 
in 1:42.55, nearly two seconds ahead of the 
rest of the field. The team captured a state 
title in the relay and shattered the previous 
school record of 1:43.85. As a former athlete, 
I commend the determination and drive of 
these young women. They are a bright exam-
ple of the importance of team dedication and 
strong work ethic. I am proud to see them rep-
resent their community so well throughout the 
state and the country with their dedication and 
passion. 
It is because of student leaders like them 
that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally congratulate Ali 
Rapps and the relay team for their accom-
plishment.

REMEMBERING MR. ARTHUR M. 
NEWELL 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. Arthur M. Newell, of Struthers, Ohio, 
on receiving the French Legion d’honneur. 
The government of the French Republic, 
since the end of the Second World War, hon-
ors those liberators, who restored those lib-
erties with determination, sacrifice, duty, and 
honor, with the presentation of the Ordre na-
tional de la Le´gion d’honneur. 
Conceived over two centuries ago by 
Napole´on Bonaparte, First Consul of the First 
Republic of France, his Order was devised to 
reward eminent military and civil merits in the 
service of France. The award is still the high-
est distinction that can be bestowed upon a 
citizen of France or a foreigner who has done 
great deeds for France. 
Of his service, then Private First Class New-
ell recalls, ‘‘After arriving in Metz, France, our 
regiment joined others from Patton’s 3rd Army 
in an attempt to breach the Siegfried Line. 
Just to the east of Metz, we approached our 
first enemy pillbox. It appeared to be out of 
action until we were within about 100 feet from 
it. At that moment the Germans opened fire. A 
few of our men got hit and a few more 
stepped on mines or set off booby traps. We 
took cover. Our heavy weapons platoon came 
up to the front and with their machine guns 
and bazookas they took direct aim at the 
bunkers slotted openings and opened fire. As 
the battle progressed my buddies and I got 
close enough to lob grenades towards the for-
tification. The enemy within the pillbox fell si-
lent.’’ 
There is no doubt that Mr. Newell is a true 
American hero, emblematic of the service that 
characterizes the Veterans of Ohio’s 13th 
Congressional District, the state of Ohio, and 
the United States of America. 
I want to personally congratulate Arthur on 
this milestone and offer my sincerest gratitude 
for his unwavering dedication to our country. It 
is members of his generation upon which our 
Nation is built.

HONORING MARK BEHAN FOR RE-

J. 
WALTER 
JUCKETT COMMUNITY SERVICE 
AWARD 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mark Behan for receiving the 
32nd Annual J. Walter Juckett Community 
Service Award from the Adirondack Regional 
Chamber of Commerce. 
Mark Behan was born in Troy, New York, 
and moved to Glens Falls as a child. After 
graduating from Colgate University, Mr. Behan 
completed executive development programs at 
the Harvard Business School and the Harvard 
Law School. Following a successful career as 
a reporter, editor, and newspaper executive, 
Behan founded Behan Communications Inc., 
which counsels a variety of clients in public 
and community relations as well as crisis com-
munications. 
Additionally, Mr. Behan has been actively 
engaged in serving the North Country for dec-
ades. For 18 years, Behan was a member and 
vice chair of the Board of Governors of Glens 
Falls Hospital. He also served on the boards 
of Kelly’s Angels Inc., the Glens Falls Founda-
tion, Arrow Financial Corp., and many other 
charitable community organizations. Behan re-
cently led the Warren County Hospitality Com-
munications Group to enhance the tourism in-
dustry in Warren County and is working with 
the Warren County’s Economic Recovery Task 
Force. 
Mark Behan has led a life devoted to serv-
ice, charity, and leadership. It is clear why Mr. 
Behan was chosen as the recipient of the 
prestigious J. Walter Juckett Community Serv-
ice Award from the Adirondack Regional 
Chamber of Commerce. This award is the 
chamber’s most distinguished for community 
service and is named in honor of J. Walter 
Juckett, a remarkable businessman and civic 
leader. On behalf of New York’s 21st Con-
gressional District, I would like to congratulate 
Mark on this honor and thank him for his 
years of service in the North Country.

dedicated teacher, school administrator, and 
beloved coach, Dr. David C. ‘‘Butch’’ Mosely, 
Jr. Sadly, Dr. Mosely transitioned from labor to 
reward on Friday, October 8, 2021, at the age 
of 80. His funeral service was held at 11:00 
a.m. on Saturday, October 16, 2021, at Shady 
Grove Farm in Climax, Georgia. 
David 
Clark 
Mosely, 
Jr., 
affectionately 
known as ‘‘Butch’’, was born in Bainbridge, 
Georgia, on July 22, 1941, to the union of 
David Clark Mosely, Sr. and Rosalie Evans 
Mosely. Butch graduated from Climax High 
School in 1959 and started his post-secondary 
academic career in Americus on a basketball 
scholarship before attending Abraham Baldwin 
Agricultural College in Tifton, and the Univer-
sity of Georgia, where he earned his under-
graduate degree. He attended Valdosta State 
University, where he earned his Specialist De-
gree and Nova Southeastern University, where 
he earned his Doctorate. 
Aristotle once said, ‘‘Educating the mind 
without educating the heart is no education at 
all.’’ Accordingly, Butch, throughout his career, 
stressed not only achieving academic success 
in his students, but also building character. His 
impressive career spanned decades and im-
pacted teachers and students across the State 
of Georgia. He served as Physical Education 
teacher and Coach of boys and girls basket-
ball teams at Pelham High School and Prin-
cipal of Whigham Public Schools. He served 
as Superintendent of Schools in Decatur 
County, City of Vidalia, Glynn County, and 
Dougherty County. He served as Interim Su-
perintendent in Carrollton, Douglas, Camilla, 
and Dougherty. His passion for education and 
his straightforward approach to making things 
happen resulted in his being named 1999 Su-
perintendent of the Year by the Georgia Asso-
ciation of Education Leaders. 
But Madam Speaker, his commitment to 
public service did not end there. Butch was 
elected to represent his community of Climax, 
Georgia as a Decatur County Commissioner. 
He later worked with the Southwest Georgia 
Regional Educational Service Agency and was 
appointed to the State Board of Education 
where he continued to serve as a voice for 
both educators and students in the state. 
Butch was also a man of deep faith and 
served his God in various capacities at the Cli-
max United Methodist Church, where he vol-
unteered countless hours on various commit-
tees for many years. 
Butch accomplished much in his life, but 
none of this would have been possible without 
his enduring faith in God, and the love and 
support of his wife of 54 years, June Cox 
Mosely; his children, Sylena and John David; 
and a host of other family and friends, all of 
whom will miss him deeply. 
Shirley Chisholm often said that ‘‘Service is 
the rent that we pay for the space we occupy 
on this earth’’. Butch paid his rent and he paid 
it well. He gave so much to so many for so 
long and continued until he could give no 
more. He made students, teachers, and all 
those whose lives he touched better for having 
known him. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 people of Georgia’s Second Congres-
sional District, in honoring the life and legacy 
of The Honorable David C. ‘‘Butch’’ Mosely, 
Jr. for his remarkable service to humankind. 
Moreover, we extend our deepest condo-
lences to Butch’s family, friends, and all those 
who grieve his loss, during this period of be-
reavement. We pray that they will be consoled 
and comforted by an abiding faith and the 
Holy Spirit in the weeks, months, and years 
ahead.

HOMETOWN HEROES—CHRIS, 
JULIA, AND SOPHIA PENNY 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Chris, Julia and Sophia Penny, 
our Texas 24 Hometown Heroes of the week. 
The spring of 2020 when COVID was starting 
to cause fear and doubt for all Americans, 
Chris Penny and his two daughters, Julia and 
Sophia, brought light and positivity to their 
community in Grapevine, Texas, where they 
collected painted rocks from all over the coun-
try to place along the Parr Park Rock Art Trail. 
It started with a few rocks painted and scat-
tered by the Penny family, then they decided 
to create a Facebook post and share the idea 
with the rest of the community. They were on 
a mission to not only give back to their com-
munity, but lift spirits across the nation. As the 
Penny family began collecting works of art, 
their community and Parr Park Rock Art Trail 
were brightened with pieces from countless 
families and individuals wanting to spread the 
same happiness and positivity. 
Over the course of the pandemic, every 
family and child was looking for safe activities 
and ways to keep spirits high. The Penny 
Family showed such a great way to do just 
that. 
I thank Chris, Julia and Sophia Penny, for 
bringing light in our community that was so 
desperately needed during a time of stress 
and uncertainty.

Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Hermes Expo Awards Dinner on October 20, 
2021. Mr. Christopher’s contributions to the

ing of this award and this body’s recognition. 
Mr. Christopher embodies the American 
Dream and exemplifies the mission of Hermes 
Expo International. Born in Cyprus, Mr. Chris-
topher immigrated with his family to the United 
States as a young boy. Today, Mr. Chris-
topher is a successful businessman, esteemed

thropist. In addition to his professional work to 
strengthen the business connections between 
the U.S. and foreign companies, Mr. Chris-
topher is a tireless advocate of justice for Cy-
prus and his efforts to support the Greek Cyp-
riot community here and abroad are immeas-
urable. 
Founder, President and CEO of American 
Network Solutions LLC, Philip Christopher is a 
prominent leader in the business community 
with more than 30 years of experience in the 
industry, 
including 
leadership 
roles 
with

lends his professional expertise to various in-
dustry organizations and has served on nu-

HONORING PASTOR LOCK P. 
BEACHUM, JR. 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
and pay tribute to the memory of the late Pas-
tor Lock P. Beachum, Jr. In challenging times 
such as these, we are reminded of the hope 
that so many like Pastor Lock give to their 
communities. Even in his passing, his devotion 
leaves behind a legacy that continues to do 
good onto the people he positively impacted in 
life. 
Pastor Lock was born July 14, 1971, in 
Youngstown, to parents Lock Sr. and Janice 
Beachum. He was educated 
within 
the 
Youngstown School System during his ele-
mentary and middle school years. He was a 
proud 1989 graduate of Ursuline High School, 
where he was a standout football player. His 
talent on the field afforded him the opportunity 
to play on a football scholarship for Miami 
(Ohio) University, where he received his Bach-
elor of Arts degree in political science in 1992. 
Although he envisioned his life traveling down 
a different path that included a professional 
football 
career 
in 
the 
National 
Football 
League, it is evident God had another plan for 
his life. 
Lock was the Campus Pastor of Victory 
Christian Center, Liberty Campus, a significant 
and 
strategic 
multicultural 
and 
multi- 
generational ministry impacting culture locally 
and globally. His consistent lifestyle, his un-
compromising convictions and his clear vision 
exemplified one who sought to bridge the 
gaps of age, ethnicity, and gender. 
A deep compassion for people from all 
walks of life was exemplified in his ministry. 
Lock’s transparency, tenacious spirit, love, 
sense of humor, winning smile, and most of 
all, his spirit of humility and being a visionary 
were all an inspiration to those who wanted to 
know and live for God. Known for his char-
acter and integrity, he was a trailblazer and 
trendsetter who focused on relevance and in-
novation. Lock was the founder of ‘‘operation 
Impact’’ which consisted of services to the 
community—such as free giveaways, gro-
ceries, clothing and free lunches at the Phar 
Mor Building. During the holiday season, cloth-
ing, gifts and toys were donated to the com-
munity, as well as 150 families being blessed 
at Thanksgiving with complete groceries for 
the family dinner.

On June 1, 2008, he answered ‘‘the call’’ 
from his Spiritual Father and his Pastor, the 
former Bishop of Victory Christian Center, Inc., 
David L. Thomas, which changed his life for-
ever. By saying ‘‘Yes’’ to the call, thousands of 
lives have been positively impacted by his 
ministry. During his tenure at Victory Christian 
Center, he served as an Elder, Campus Pas-
tor, Chief Operating Officer, Director of Oper-
ations and served on the Board of Director of 
Legacy A Global Kingdom Alliance. 
Lock wanted to leave a legacy that would 
extend beyond his lifetime. ‘‘He fought the 
fight, finished the race and most of all re-
mained faithful to his calling. Well done thy 
good and faithful servant.’’ Pastor Lock’s hard 
work and devotion will continue to reverberate 
throughout our community, and his memory 
will live on forever.

HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the lives of New York State As-
semblyman and Assemblywoman John and 
Chloe Ann O’Neil on the occasion of their me-
morial dedication service. 
Prior to Mr. O’Neil’s time in the Assembly, 
he dedicated his life to teaching students at 
various universities throughout upstate New 
York, such as Canton College of Technology. 
He spent over twenty years working with the 
United University Professions to ensure pro-
fessors all over New York were well rep-
resented. Mrs. O’Neil spent her life dedicated 
to serving others through volunteer work at 
Canton-Potsdam Hospital and decades of 
teaching at the Parishville-Hopkins Central 
School. John and Chloe Ann were married in 
April of 1966 at Sacred Heart Church in Cic-
ero, New York and the loving couple had two 
children. 
John and Chloe Ann O’Neil were both dedi-
cated New York State assembly members. 
John was elected to the Assembly in 1980, 
representing the St. Lawrence County area. 
He served six terms, working up until his 
passing in 1992. Chloe Ann worked closely 
with John while he was in office and was sub-
sequently elected to John’s seat in a special 
election, serving from 1993 to 1998. Both 
John and Chloe Ann O’Neil were enthusiastic 
advocates for helping others and improving 
the quality of life for New York State residents. 
John O’Neil tragically died in a car accident 
in 1992 and Chloe Ann O’Neil passed away in 
a two-car collision in 2018. The O’Neils were 
true assets to the North Country and every 
New York State citizen has benefited from the 
immense civic commitment of this legendary 
couple. I am proud to honor the lives of John 
and Chloe Ann O’Neil on behalf of New York’s 
21st Congressional District.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
RED 
STEAGALL 
COWBOY 
HERITAGE 
AND RANCH RODEO 30TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 30th anniversary of the 
Red Steagall Cowboy Gathering. Established 
three decades ago, this multi-faceted event 
started at the Cowtown Coliseum in the Fort 
Worth Stockyards National Historic District. 
Named after famed American Western musi-
cian and poet Russell ‘‘Red’’ Steagall, this 
three-day gathering brings together more than 
30,000 people each year from across the 
globe. The first gathering began as a celebra-
tion of cowboy poetry, which grew from the 
tradition of cowboys telling stories over camp-
fires. 
The Red Steagall Cowboy Gathering that 
exists today still honors the roots of cowboy 
poetry, but it has evolved into a much larger 
celebration of music, poetry, and more. To 
kick off the gathering, one of the last authentic 
wagon 
trains 
is 
formed 
by 
participants 
throughout the state, travelling to various 
ranches across Texas until they arrive at the 
Fort Worth Stockyards to kick-off the festivi-
ties. The Western Swing Festival & Dance 
features musical performances each night of 
the event by artists such as Bobby Flores, 
Jake Hooker, and Red Steagall himself. 
Rodeo is also a major part of the heart and 
soul of this gathering, with multiple events fea-
turing competing ranches that battle for brag-
ging rights and the opportunity to showcase 
the skill and grit of the cowboys who work this 
lifestyle every day. One of the greatest accom-
plishments of the Red Steagall Cowboy Gath-
ering, however, is the scholarships provided to 
students interested in Western culinary arts, 
poetry, and swing music. To date, the gath-
ering has awarded more than $1 million in 
scholarships, with over $250,000 coming from 
the Youth Poetry Contest alone, to those stu-
dents who are looking to keep these traditions 
alive for generations to come. 
Our community owes a great deal to Red 
Steagall for hosting this gathering and helping 
shape the world-renowned event that it has 
become today. I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing the 30th anniversary of the Red 
Steagall Cowboy Gathering, and the executive 
producers, Mr. Red Steagall himself, Mr. 
Steve Murrin, Mr. Hub Baker and Mr. Jim Cal-
houn, Jr., along with the countless others who 
make this time-honored event possible, and all 
that this tremendous family event does to 
bring together Fort Worth and the entire state 
of Texas each year to share our mutual pas-
sion.

HONORING SARAH YOUNG 
GLACKIN 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and thank Sarah Young Glackin on 
her long and distinguished career as a staff 
member on the House Appropriations Com-
mittee as she prepares to leave us for new 
endeavors. 
Myself and my fellow colleagues—on both 
sides of the aisle—have relied extensively on 
Sarah’s expertise in many appropriations mat-
ters, most notably in the areas of defense and 
military construction. 
Sarah’s career began on the Subcommittee 
on Defense, with a portfolio that included 
Tricare and Defense Health Programs. 
Four years later, she moved to the Sub-
committee on Military Quality of Life and then 
Subcommittee on Interior and Environment. 
She soon returned to Defense, where she 
worked on Counterdrug and Narcotics, Missile 
Defense, Defense Health Programs, Military 
Medical Research, and TRICARE. For the last 
decade; Sarah has served on the Sub-
committee on Military Construction, Veterans 
Affairs, and Related Agencies. 
She was responsible for military construc-
tion across all components and services, the 
improvement 
of 
housing 
for 
our 
servicemembers and their Families, and the 
NATO security investment program. 
Oftentimes congressional staffers are not 
appropriately recognized for their service. 
However, they are the Americans from all over 
our Nation that represent the fabric of our 
country. Sarah has served in more ways than 
one. 
Madam Speaker, Sarah has been an institu-
tion on the Appropriations Committee since 
the moment I arrived there. My colleagues and 
myself will miss her dedication, her patience, 
and her deep reservoir of knowledge. I want to 
wish Sarah all the best as she pursues new 
adventures.

HONORING RON JACKSON FOR RE-
CEIVING THE FRANCISCA IRWIN 
AWARD FOR COMMUNITY SERV-
ICE 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Ron Jackson for receiving the 
Francisca Irwin Award for Community Service 
from the Essex Community Fund. 
For decades, Ron Jackson has selflessly 
served the North Country. Mr. Jackson has 
lived in Essex all his life, joining the local fire 
company at 16 before studying engineering at 
SUNY-Maritime and serving with the Merchant 
Marines. As town Supervisor for 10 years, Mr. 
Jackson worked to upgrade the community 
sewer and water systems and helped gather 
funds for Beggs Park. A pillar of the local EMS 
and fire units, he helped to both design and 
build the fire house. Following the events of 9/ 
11, he even led an ambulance crew to New 
York City to offer assistance. Mr. Jackson re-
mains a devoted community leader today and 
currently serves on the town board. 
The Francisca Irwin Award for Community 
Service is named for ‘‘Frisky’’ Paine Irwin, who 
was a devoted advocate for the Adirondack 
community. Based on Mr. Jackson’s decades 
of tireless service, he is undoubtedly deserv-
ing of this recognition. On behalf of New 
York’s 21st Congressional District, I thank Mr. 
Jackson for his service to the North Country 
and congratulate him on receiving this award.

HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Mr. Norvan D. McClure of 
Fort Wayne. Our Nation owes Norvan a tre-
mendous debt of gratitude for his service to 
our country in the United States Army during 
World War II. Serving in an Engineer Combat 
Battalion in the Europe, his sacrifices were 
critical to the defense of our homeland, of Eu-
rope and to the security and prosperity of mil-
lions. 
Most notably, Norvan’s service earned him 
the French Legion of Honour award, the high-
est distinction awarded by France. Established 
by Napoleon in 1804, the Legion of Honour 
known as Ordre national de la Legion 
d’honneur, is awarded only to the most excep-
tional of soldiers served in defense of the 
French Republic. As a combat engineer, 
Norvan was charged with most perilous tasks 
of any soldier during the war: removing mines 
and booby traps left behind by a retreating fa-
natical Wehrmacht. But for Norvan and his he-
roic actions, many more America have been 
killed and the Allied advance across Western 
Europe would been even more difficult and 
deadly than it was. 
Norvan’s unit continued into Germany, and 
then Austria, where it remained involved in 
combat operations until the end of the war in 
Europe in May 1945. Norvan returned to Indi-
ana. raised five children with his wife, 
Maryann, and became a Locomotive Engineer, 
a job he had for 44 years. I’m proud to honor 
him. On behalf of Congress, let me say: We 
hope Norvan’s heart is filled with joy knowing 
he has experienced our country’s blessings, 
including the affection of family, friends, and a 
grateful Nation, over a long and well-lived life. 
May God Bless Norvan, and may God Bless 
the United States.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 98TH 
TURKISH INDEPENDENCE DAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Turkish-American Cul-
tural Association of Michigan on the celebra-
tion of the 98th Turkish Independence Day on 
October 29, 2021. The Turkish-American Cul-
tural Association of Michigan has been a posi-
tive force in our community and this celebra-
tion is worthy of commendation. 
The Turkish-American Cultural Association 
of Michigan have been a strong voice for the 
Turkish people here in Michigan and their ef-
forts play a role in cultivating a meaningful re-
lationship between Turkey and the United 
States. The group serves as a bridge that uni-
fies our communities to promote, plan, and 
execute programs that improve humanitarian 
and cultural welfare of the Turkish community 
in Michigan and abroad. Their leadership and 
the sharing of their unique tradition and culture 
has made a difference here at home and in 
communities across the nation. 
As we celebrate the 98th Turkish Independ-
ence Day, I am proud to recognize the many 
Americans of Turkish descent who have made 
significant contributions to our state, especially 
those notable Turkish-Americans who reside 
in Michigan’s 12th Congressional District who 
tirelessly work towards innovation in the fields 
of academia, the arts, and technology. Turk-
ish-Americans enrich our communities through 
sharing their culture and continue to dem-
onstrate a steadfast commitment to making 
Michigan a more inclusive, vibrant, and pros-
perous place for all. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the 98th Turkish Independence 
Day. We thank the Turkish-American Cultural 
Association and their President, Dr. Mehmet 
Erdem Yaya, for their commitment to the bet-
terment of our state of Michigan and look for-
ward to celebrating this special anniversary for 
many years to come.

CONGRATULATING ILLINI BLUFFS 
HIGH SCHOOL’S SOFTBALL TEAM 
FOR WINNING IHSA CLASS 1A 
STATE CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Illini Bluffs High School soft-
ball team for winning the Illinois High School 
Athletic Association Class 1A State champion-
ship. 
The team won the state title in softball, com-
pleting a perfect 29–0 season. The Tigers fell 
behind 3–1, but rallied in the fifth inning. Tri-
ples from Zoe Eeten and Addie Welsh as well 
as timely base knocks from Ashley Aksun, 
Emma Hicks and Annabelle Fortin allowed the 
Tigers to score five unanswered runs and pick 
up a 6–3 win over Orangeville. As a former 
athlete, I commend the determination and 
drive of these young women. They are a 
bright example of the importance of team 
dedication and strong work ethic. I am proud 
to see them represent their community so well 
throughout the state and the country with their 
dedication and passion. 
It is because of student leaders like them 
that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally congratulate the 
Illini Bluffs’ softball team on their Class 1A 
State Finals championship.

TRIBUTE TO JEAN HALE 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize the remarkable career and 
astute leadership of my dear friend, Jean Hale 
of Pikeville, Kentucky, who plans to retire after 
dedicating 52 years in the banking industry in 
Central Appalachia, serving as Chairwoman, 
President, and Chief Executive Officer of 
Community Trust Bancorp for the last 23 
years. 
Jean Hale joined Community Trust in 1969 
and progressed through the officer ranks, 
working twice as hard to make her mark in a 
male-dominated industry. In 1992, she was 
named President and CEO of Community 
Trust Bank and seven years later, became 
president and CEO of Community Trust 
Bancorp. In 2005, Chairwoman was added to 
her growing list of leadership roles. During her 
tenure, the company’s total assets increased 
152 percent from $2.2 billion on December 31, 
1999, to $5.5 billion on June 30, 2021, with 
banking locations in Kentucky, West Virginia, 
and Tennessee. 
She credits her stellar work ethic to her par-
ents. Her father was a coal mining electrician, 
and she refers to her mother as a ‘‘home-
making engineer’’ for making their clothes, 
raising their garden and canning goods. To-
gether, they put Jean and her three siblings 
through college with no debt, moving from 
Grapevine to Pikeville so they could live at 
home and go to college, saving money on 
room and board. Jean has carried the same fi-
nancial wisdom and skills throughout her ca-
reer, even making her own suits when she 
first started working for Community Trust. 
Over the year, her counsel and expertise 
have been highly sought after among financial 
sector experts, leading her to become Chair-
woman of the Board of the Kentucky Eco-
nomic Development Finance Authority and a 
member of the Kentucky Economic Develop-
ment Partnership Board, the Commonwealth 
Seed Capital, LLC Board, the University of 
Pikeville Board of Trustees, the ARH Founda-
tion Board, and the Community Depository In-
stitutions Advisory Council of the Federal Re-
serve Bank of Cleveland. 
In addition to her work in the banking indus-
try, I am personally grateful for Jean’s commit-
ment to SOAR—Shaping Our Appalachian Re-
gion—a 
non-profit 
organization 
that 
she 
helped launch to revitalize rural communities 
in Kentucky’s Appalachian region as a result 
of the downturn of the coal industry. Jean was 
one of the first leaders that I personally asked 
to help establish SOAR. The initiative that 
started in 2013 is now a comprehensive re-
gional movement that is effectively shaping a 
brighter future for the people of southern and 
eastern Kentucky. Since day one, she has 
served on the SOAR Executive Committee 
and as Chair of the Development Committee 
and Finance Committee. Thanks to her leader-
ship, SOAR is a thriving, self-sustaining grass-
roots organization that is empowering eco-
nomic development and growth where we 
need it the most. 
The characteristic that sets Jean apart is 
her passion. She deeply loves Eastern Ken-
tucky and watching our region thrive despite 
our challenges. I count it a great honor to cel-
ebrate my friend, Jean Hale and the countless 
accomplishments that she has made on behalf 
of so many Central Appalachian families and 
businesses. May her retirement be blessed by 
many wonderful years with her family and be-
loved grandchildren.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
GERDA M. FITTS (KRUEGER) 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the steadfast service of one of 
Missouri’s World War II U.S. Cadet Nurses, 
Gerda Fitts (Krueger). 
Born in 1924, Gerda grew up during the 
Great Depression, where she helped on the 
family farm, read the Bible and helped with the 
chores around her family home. Gerda grad-
uated high school while America was engaged 
in World War II. Her father had served in 
World War I and seeing her brothers’ commit-
ment to fight for their country in World War II, 
encouraged a patriotic earning within her soul. 
Thus, determined to do her part, Gerda en-
listed in the United States Nursing Corps in 
1943. This was when God first called her to 
serve others, and the time spent doing His 
work set her on a path she has been following 
ever since. After getting out of the U.S. Cadet 
Nurse Corps, Gerda started working for the 
Wentworth Military Academy as the social di-
rector. She taught etiquette class to the young 
boys who attended Wentworth Military Acad-
emy. It was during this time that she met her 
now-husband, James ‘Jim’ Fitts, an Air Force 
veteran who had just retired after serving a 
dedicated 34 years. Gerda and Jim both re-
tired from Wentworth Military Academy, Gerda 
as the social director and Jim as the Academy 
Commandant. After their retirement, they 
moved to Hermitage, Missouri, where they 
have both continued serving their community. 
Gerda Fitts has been alive nearly a century. 
During this time, she has seen the world ad-
vance in ways she could have never dreamed. 
She had to live through the horrors of the 
Great Depression, a World War, and a Cold 
War. She has witnessed 17 Presidential ad-
ministrations and has watched as America had 
its ups and downs. Through it all, she remains 
the same humble, sweet, caring woman who 
never forgets to check on her friends, and who 
truly loves her community and country. 
Although the U.S. Cadet Nurse Corps is not 
recognized as a formal branch of service, it is 
important that women like Gerda are recog-
nized for their service to our country during 
World War II. Please join me in honoring 
Gerda Fitts for her steadfast service to our 
Nation.

CONGRATULATING 
BLACK 
HAWK 
COLLEGE ON ITS 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Black Hawk College for its 75th Anni-
versary. Black Hawk College has long been 
an excellent college in our district. 
Black Hawk College started off as Moline 
Community College in 1946, and was located 
at Moline High School. The College accommo-
dated World War II veterans seeking higher 
education and offered transfer, career, and 
adult education classes. In 1961 it became 
Black Hawk College, which was the first coun-
ty-wide junior college in Illinois. Black Hawk 
College expanded as neighboring school dis-
tricts petitioned to join its district. In 1965, with 
the passage of ‘‘The Illinois Public Junior Col-
lege Act,’’ Black Hawk College became part of 
the state’s system of higher education, com-
mitted 
to 
offering 
traditional 
liberal 
arts 
courses, occupational courses, and adult edu-
cation courses at its campus in Moline. I com-
mend Black Hawk College for all it has done 
for students and community colleges in our 
district. 
It is because of community leaders such as 
Black Hawk College that I am especially proud 
to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally 
recognize and congratulate Black Hawk Col-
lege for its 75th Anniversary.

POST 132 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor American Legion Post 132 of Or-
ange, California, an inspiring organization 
dedicated to supporting veterans, national se-
curity, Americanism, and our community and 
its young people. 
For more than ten decades, American Le-
gion Post 132 has helped veterans adjust to 
life after service. It has served as a second 
home for some, helped others find jobs, and 
offered many the chance to forge lifelong 
friendships. 
Post 132 was organized in 1919, the same 
year the American Legion was chartered by 
Congress as a patriotic veterans organization. 
Post 132 then received its temporary charter 
December 17, 1919 and its official charter Oc-
tober 1, 1920, making it one of the earliest

American Legion posts in California and the 
second oldest in Orange County. 
The newly formed Post 132 met for nearly 
a decade in the Orange City Hall basement 
until the Legion Hall was dedicated June 3, 
1928. For several years, the Legion shared 
the facility with the Orange Armory of the Na-
tional Guard, which used the basement for fir-
ing practice. The basement now houses a 
unique Military Museum that displays items 
from the American Civil War to present day. 
Not only is Post 132 one of the oldest 
American Legion posts in the country, it is one 
of the most active. Post 132 Legionnaires 
keep a full calendar of fundraising events for 
veteran causes, programs for holidays like 
Flag Day and Veterans Day, and outreach ac-
tivities to local schools and community groups 
to talk about the importance of honoring those 
who fought for our country. 
In support of developing future leaders, Post 
132 sends high school students to the annual 
Boys State and Girls State summer leadership 
and citizenship program. In addition, Post 132 
sponsors local Cub Scout and Boy Scout 
troops. 
Post 132 is a combination of four ‘‘families’’ 
that includes its veteran Legionnaires, an Aux-
iliary Unit that is part of the largest women’s 
patriotic service organization in the world, a 
Sons of the American Legion unit made up of 
descendants of parents or grandparents who 
served in the military, and a Riders Chapter, 
a group of motorcycle enthusiasts who partici-
pate in parades and other events that raise 
funds and foster camaraderie. 
The American Legion Post 132 family has, 
in all aspects, provided extensive service to 
our veterans and has fostered patriotism and 
good citizenship, especially for our youth. 
More than 500 veterans from throughout Or-
ange County belong to Post 132. Throughout 
its long history, its members past and present 
have fought in every war and major military 
conflict since World War I. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing the more than 100 years of outstanding 
service to our community by American Legion 
Post 132, and the service of the hundreds of 
veterans who are members of this patriotic or-
ganization.

HONORING 
COMMUNITY 
HEALTH 
OF 
SOUTH 
FLORIDA, 
INCOR-
PORATED 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, founded in 
the late 1960s, Community Health of South 
Florida, Incorporated was established in order 
to answer the call of service for members of 
the community. Many minority residents of 
Miami-Dade County lacked access to health 
care due to the existing segregation of med-
ical care in the South. Other migrant farm-
workers were uninsured, preventing them from 
obtaining preventative or ambulatory care. 
Doris Ison recognized the need to provide 
care for all, regardless of race or economic 
status, having been a farmworker herself who 
immigrated from the Bahamas. Inspired by the 
American dream, Mrs. Ison was a catalyst for 
action and inspired local leaders, organiza-
tions, and members from her church to estab-
lish Community Health of South Dade, Incor-
porated in April of 1971. 
Beginning as two trailers off U.S. Highway 
1, today, the mission has expanded to 11 
health centers. Additionally, 35 school-based 
centers were established in order to serve the 
needs of Miami-Dade and Monroe County’s 
underprivileged children. Community Health of 
South Florida, Incorporated offers services 
ranging from Primary Care, Urgent Care, Pedi-
atrics, Behavioral Health, Radiology, Dental, 
Vision, and many others. Community Health of 
South Florida, Incorporated again answered 
the call for service during the COVID–19 pan-
demic by providing testing and telehealth med-
ical services. True to Mrs. Ison’s vision, CHI 
provides care for the uninsured and low in-
come in Miami-Dade County, as well as the 
insured. 
In 2016, Community Health of South Flor-
ida, Incorporated received the Governor’s 
Sterling Award. They are designated as the 
second federally qualified health center in the 
nation to be a behavioral health medical 
home, are certified as a patient centered med-
ical home by the National Committee for Qual-
ity Assurance, and are accredited by the Joint 
Commission. To carry on the legacy of Mrs. 
Ison, the Brodes H. Hartley, Jr. Teaching 
Health Center helps to train the next genera-
tion of medical professionals. 
It is an honor to join the South Florida com-
munity in celebrating their 50th anniversary. 
As Community Health of South Florida, Incor-
porated celebrates this milestone, I am grate-
ful for all this organization has done to serve 
the needs of South Florida.

HONORING THE HEROIC LIFE OF 
CHARLES SMITH 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the heroic life of Charles Smith 
on the occasion of his passing. 
Mr. Charles Smith was born in Keene, New 
York in 1924 to Samuel and Elsie Smith. In 
1943, he was drafted to fight in World War II 
and joined the U.S. Army’s 10th Mountain Di-
vision. Mr. Smith had grown up skiing during 
intense winters in Upstate New York and de-
cided to enlist as a ski trooper, soldiers spe-
cifically trained for mountainous warfare. His 
unit was sent to Italy where they fought in the 
Apennine Mountains and the Po Valley, at one 
point fighting for 20 continuous days and 
crossing 120 miles. Facing snipers, mines, 
and machine guns, his unit experienced the 
highest casualty count for their size and period 
in combat with 992 deaths and 4,000 wound-
ed. 
While bravely defending his country, Mr. 
Smith was injured by enemy shrapnel but cou-
rageously continued to fight alongside his unit. 
Mr. Smith was awarded the Purple Heart and 
Bronze Star for his heroic service to his coun-
try. 
After the war, Mr. Smith married his wife, 
Roberta Louisa Manley, and had three chil-
dren. He became a carpenter and worked on 
building Plattsburgh Air Force Base. Always 
dedicated to his community, he was also a 
proud volunteer at Champlain Valley Physi-
cians Hospital for over a decade. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I am 
honored to recognize the extraordinary life of 
Charles Smith, and his brave and selfless 
service to his country. It is my hope that his 
fearless spirit and bravery will be carried on by 
those who knew and loved him.

Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Belta

whose commitment to service and devotion to 
community has and continues to inspire gen-
erations throughout our island. We will fondly 
remember her as an innovative entrepreneur 
and tireless advocate that has helped shape 
the history and future of Guam. 
Widely known for her pioneering efforts in 
cultivating a new industry for the island, Belta 
is an icon of pageantry and performing arts. 
Following her reign as Guam’s 1961 Liberation 
Queen, she earned her associate’s degree in 
Education and Theater and bachelor’s degree 
in Education and Communication from the 
University of Guam and San Jose State Uni-
versity respectively. She then utilized her ex-
tensive training and background in the arts to 
establish the first John Robert Powers School 
in Guam and the Philippines. Providing formal 
training and mentorship to thousands of stu-
dents for over 50 years, Belta developed an 
institution that admirably encourages our youth 
to pursue their dreams, foster their talents,

and use their skills to leave a positive impact 
on society. 
In addition to her passion for connecting the 
People of Guam with greater opportunities, 
her personal mission to give back to others 
poured out into numerous other parts of com-
munity life. Over the years, Belta served as an 
Administrator for the Guam Department of 
Education, Instructor at the Academy of Our 
Lady of Guam, Marketing and Advertising Di-
rector at Foremost McKesson Guam, Writer at 
the Pacific Daily News, Columnist and Editor 
at the Guam Tribune, Producer and Host of 
Woman’s World at KUAM TV/Radio, Afternoon 
Show Host at KGTF, and Director for the Miss 
Hemisphere USA Pacific/Asia Area. As a de-
vout Catholic Daughter, she also dedicated in-
valuable time as both an active supporter of 
Catholic Social Services and the Alee Women 
and Children’s Shelter and mentor for the High 
School Continuation Program. 
With countless achievements that extend 
from being listed among the 1971 and 1976 
Outstanding Young Women of America, in-
ducted into the Modeling Association of Amer-
ica International Hall of Fame, and featured in 
Pageantry Magazine, to being granted a 
Guam Visitors Bureau Lifetime Achievement 
Award and recognized as the 1985 Guam 
Business Woman of the Year, 2018 and 2019 
National iPop School Director of the Year, and 
Guam Business Magazine’s 2019 Lifetime 
Business Woman, it is clear that Belta unique-
ly invested in and touched the lives of many 
through her work. 
Belta Torre Sgambelluri Perez was a 
woman of faith and an example of generosity 
who continues to inspire generations of men-
tors and leaders. I extend my deepest condo-
lences to her family and friends. and I join the 
People of Guam in remembering and cele-
brating her life and legacy of selfless service, 
empowerment, and holistic community growth. 
Belta will be deeply missed, and her love and

RECOGNIZING GRACE EPISCOPAL 
CHURCH’S 150TH YEAR OF SERVICE 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Grace Episcopal 
Church, which is celebrating its 150th year of 
service to the community of Mount Clemens, 
Michigan. 
In 1849, Michigan’s first Episcopal Bishop, 
the Right Reverend Samuel McCoskry, or-
dained Reverend Edward Magee in Mount 
Clemens. At the time, in the absence of a per-
manent house of worship, a small group of 
Episcopalians began meeting for services in 
the Macomb County Courthouse. In 1867, the 
early congregation obtained land for a church 
building, which was completed in 1871. 
Since 1895, the parish has honorably 
served the Mount Clemens community with 
outreach programs. Today, Grace Episcopal 
maintains a Women’s Prison Ministry, Sunday 
Soup Kitchen, and Wednesday Community 
Supper. The church also offers shelter to resi-
dents in need through partnerships with the 
Macomb County Rotating Emergency Shelter 
Team and the Macomb County Warming Cen-
ter. 
Grace Episcopal Church exemplifies ‘‘Be-
loved Community’’ by welcoming and assisting 
people of all backgrounds. The church website 
proudly states: ‘‘Among us are folks of great 
heart including the walking wounded of every 
sort: those suffering addiction and homeless-
ness, restless children, honored elders, surly 
teens, seekers, gays and lesbians, good 
Christians, hopeless sinners, dyed-in-the-wool 
traditionalists, & more.’’ 
I am proud to have the honor of recognizing 
Grace Episcopal Church today and to mark 
this sesquicentennial event for the congrega-
tion. I encourage my colleagues to join me in 
offering congratulations to the entire Grace 
Episcopal community as they celebrate one- 
hundred-and-fifty years of ministry and service 
in Mount Clemens.

CONGRATULATING JOE LUNA ON 
HIS 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
THE 
GALESBURG 
POLICE 
DEPART-
MENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Officer Joe Luna, who is retiring 
from the Galesburg Police Department after 
26 years of service. 
Since becoming an officer over two decades 
ago, Officer Luna has been an honorable 
steward of the city of Galesburg and a dedi-
cated public servant. As a detective, he inves-
tigated cases leading to criminal prosecution, 
and as Galesburg School District 205’s School 
Resource Officer, he was an invaluable mem-
ber of the community. Anyone who has 
walked the halls of Galesburg High School un-
derstands the impact Officer Luna had on stu-
dents of all backgrounds. During his tenure, 
he kept our children safe, listened to their sto-
ries, offered advice, and was an ever-friendly 
face to every student without reservation. 
It is because of determined and compas-
sionate leaders such as Officer Luna that I am 
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to, again, formally congratulate Officer Joe 
Luna on his well-deserved retirement and 
thank him for his 26 years of service to our 
community.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
SERGEANT MICHAEL RUDD 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life of Sergeant Michael 
Rudd. Immediately following his 2002 high 
school graduation, Sgt. Rudd served his coun-
try by enlisting in the U.S. Air Force before 
going on to join the U.S. Army National Guard. 
After his military service came to an end, Sgt. 
Rudd continued to serve his country and com-
munity. He then became a law enforcement 
officer for LaPaz County, where he would re-
main in service to his community until his 
passing. Sgt. Rudd worked tirelessly for the 
people of LaPaz County, hoping to soon be-
come a Lieutenant within the sheriffs office. 
His entire life was spent in service to the peo-
ple of his community, state, and country. 
Madam Speaker, I wish to offer my deepest 
condolences to Sgt. Rudd’s entire family. He 
is survived by his wife Amanda and their 6 
wonderful children. His contributions and pub-
lic service will never be forgotten by the state 
of Arizona or the people of LaPaz County.

HONORING JACQUELINE PRATHER 
FOR RECEIVING THE LIFETIME 
ACHIEVEMENT 
AWARD 
FROM 
THE GIRL SCOUTS OF NORTH-
EASTERN NEW YORK 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Jacqueline Prather for receiv-
ing the Lifetime Achievement Award from the 
Girl Scouts of Northeastern New York. 
Jacqueline Prather is the dedicated Child 
Care Director of the Plattsburgh YMCA Bright 
Beginnings. She embodies everything the 
YMCA stands for and always does her job 
with respect and care. In addition to her work 
at the YMCA, she is a military wife who has 
supported numerous community projects at 
every location her husband has been sta-
tioned. Her impact over the past 25 years has 
been exceptionally far-reaching. She has 
worked to ensure over 2,000 babies, toddlers, 
and preschoolers have a loving place to pre-
pare for kindergarten. 
Ms. Prather truly embodies the spirit of care 
present throughout the North Country. She is 
a wonderful role model for girls throughout the 
region. On behalf of New York’s 21st Con-
gressional District, I would like to thank Ms. 
Prather for her commitment to young people 
and her community, and congratulate her for 
this well-deserved recognition.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF DR. DANIEL JOSEPH BENISHEK 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the life and legacy of Dr. 
Daniel Joseph Benishek, who passed away 
recently after a lifetime of service to the First 
District and the state of Michigan. Through his 
dedication to his patients and constituents, 
Dan 
changed 
the 
lives 
of 
countless 
Michiganders and became an indispensable 
part of his community. 
A native Yooper, Dan was born in Iron 
River, Michigan, on April 20, 1952, and he 
spent his childhood in the western Upper Pe-
ninsula until his graduation from West Iron 
County High School in 1970. With an inherent 
drive to serve others, Dan furthered his edu-
cation at the University of Michigan and 
Wayne State University School of Medicine. 
After completing medical school, he returned

to the U.P. and went on to positively impact 
many Veterans’ lives during his two decades 
of service at the Iron Mountain VA Medical 
Center. 
After years of work on behalf of Yooper Vet-
erans, Dan was driven to become an advocate 
on behalf of all Michiganders when he ran for 
Congress in 2010. As a member of the House 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee, he continued his 
steadfast support of Veterans in his district 
while also working to pass legislation to pro-
tect our state’s most valuable landmarks as a 
member of the House Committee on Natural 
Resources—most notably the nationally-recog-
nized Sleeping Bear Dunes. I have been and 
continue to be greatly inspired by Dan’s self-
less work and dedication to our Veterans as 
well as his fellow Yoopers. He served the First 
District of Michigan for three terms from 2011 
to 2017, leaving a lasting mark in Washington, 
D.C. 
Dan’s passing is a significant loss to the 
Upper Peninsula, but Michigan and the United 
States have benefited immensely from his life-
time of public service. He is missed dearly by 
his family and friends, and his memory will un-
doubtedly live on for generations to come. 
Dan’s tireless devotion to the public good 
touched the lives of so many Michiganders, 
and the impact of his work cannot be over-
stated. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the life of Dr. Daniel Joseph 
Benishek. I was honored to call Dan a friend, 
and it is an honor to uphold his legacy in Con-
gress.

TRIBUTE TO TRAVIS L. THOMAS 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life of Travis L. 
Thomas who became an angel on September 
21, 2021. As we reflect on his extraordinary 
life, my thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily and friends during this difficult time. 
Travis dedicated his life to defending our 
country, keeping the streets safe, and improv-
ing his community. After fighting in the Korean 
War, Travis returned home and continued his 
life of service with the Department of Public 
Safety, serving in the Burnet police force be-
fore finishing his career as the police chief of 
both Georgetown and Luling. His devotion to 
law and order resulted in safer communities 
that residents are proud to call home. 
Travis was a stellar and committed volun-
teer following his retirement in 1998, contrib-
uting his considerable talents and energies to 
a broad array of causes. Travis will be espe-
cially remembered for how much he loved the 
City of Burnet where he was involved in a 
multitude of civic organizations that allowed 
him to use his abilities to make Burnet the 
pride of Central Texas. 
While I join Travis Thomas’s family and 
friends in mourning his passing, the positive 
impacts he had on the lives of others will re-
main in our hearts forever. His presence was 
a blessing for all who knew him. 
RECOGNIZING J.D. GROM 
HON. JAMES A. HIMES 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize J.D. Grom, the Executive Director of 
the New Democrat Coalition, who recently left 
us to serve his country in a new capacity at 
the Department of Commerce. 
As Democrats, we all have fight in us. 
That’s never been the hard part. We look at 
the world around us, see that things can be 
better, and know that smart people, working 
hard together can create a better future. But 
how do we best focus our efforts? It can seem 
easier, at times, to amplify our differences, 
drawing battle lines and characterizing our po-
litical opponents as existential threats. But that 
approach is rarely, if ever, in the best service 
of the nation. 
The more constructive path—one that I truly 
believe will lead to a more equitable, sustain-
able, and better future—requires not only a 
deep understanding of the policy challenges 
we face but the willingness to make progress 
where we can with allies we recruit and con-
vince along the way. 
J.D. Grom spent his time as the Executive 
Director of the New Democrats committed to 
this important mission. He never allowed par-
tisan politics to come before the essential 
work of helping the American people. Staying 
focused on this responsibility, while managing 
a large and diverse caucus of big personal-
ities, is no easy task. But it is one that J.D. 
carried out with the utmost competence, 
humor, and success, all while being a caring 
and present husband to Stacy and father to 
Jack and Emma. 
I wish him great professional success in the 
future, at Commerce and beyond. As he 
moves into this new phase, he should take 
pride in the fact that he has left the New Dem-
ocrat Coalition in a stronger position than he 
found it, and has set an inspiring example of 
leadership for his successors.

CONGRATULATING 
ANNIE 
WIRTH 
AND HER RELAY TEAM FOR WIN-
NING THE IHSA STATE TITLE IN 
TRACK 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Annie Wirth and her relay team 
for winning the Illinois High School Association 
State Title. 
Addison Pischke ran a strong first leg and 
passed the baton to Alison Bowers. Bowers 
handed the baton to third leg Annie Wirth, and 
the Leafs were in the lead. Wirth increased 
the lead slightly and when the baton came to 
Ali Rapps, she increased the lead and finished 
in 1:42.55, nearly two seconds ahead of the 
rest of the field. The team captured a state 
title in the relay and shattered the previous 
school record of 1:43.85. As a former athlete, 
I commend the determination and drive of 
these young women. They are a bright exam-
ple of the importance of team dedication and 
strong work ethic. I am proud to see them rep-
resent their community so well throughout the 
state and the country with their dedication and 
passion. 
It is because of student leaders like them 
that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to again formally congratulate Annie 
Wirth and the relay team for their accomplish-
ment.

Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Ellen Bouchard for receiving 
the

New York. 
Ellen Bouchard is a prime example of some-
one deeply devoted to serving her community.

ment Officer at Dannemora Federal Credit 
Union, she is a dedicated member of her local 
Rotary Club. She has served as a board

cation, she has received numerous awards in-
cluding the Rotary Paul Harris Award, Rotar-

munity, she has also served on the board of 
the Senior Citizens Council, Lake City Refer-
rals, Go Red for Women, PBS, and Business 
and Professional Women. Ellen Bouchard is 
an outstanding role model for Girl Scouts 
throughout Northeast New York. 
Ms. Bouchard truly embodies the spirit of

On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional

tion.

Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise

very happy 100th birthday on December 6, 
2021. Mrs. Horstman is a distinguished resi-
dent of Morton Grove, Illinois and a con-

Lieutenant who served in the U.S. Army Med-
ical Corps as a Physical Therapist during 
World War II. 
Bette Horstman was born on December 6, 
1921 in Hibbing, Minnesota and grew up in 
Chicago, Illinois with her younger sister and 
parents. Mrs. Horstman graduated from the 
University of Michigan in 1943 and was ac-
cepted into the Mayo Clinic’s Physical Therapy 
(PT) program.

Students in the program were visited by a 
U.S. Army recruiter who told them about their 
country’s need for their skills and service and 
she enlisted in the U.S. Army Medical Corps 
in 1944. Upon completing her training, she 
was sent on her first assignment at Tripler 
General Hospital in Oahu, Hawaii, and later 
3,700 miles west to Saipan, where her profes-
sional skills helped heal many soldiers during 
the war. She was discharged in 1946 and was 
honored for her service with a Meritorious 
Service Unit Citation with one Star, the Asi-
atic-Pacific Service Medal, and the World War 
II Victory Medal. 
In her post-service life, Mrs. Horstman 
helped establish the PT departments at three 
Chicago area hospitals. She was the first fe-
male in the state of Illinois to open up her own 
PT practice. She continued her education and 
received both a Master’s in Education and a 
nursing home administrator’s license. She was 
also a long-time member of the American 
Physical Therapy Association. 
Mrs. Horstman volunteers and gives back to 
the community to this day. She has worked 
with the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Amer-
ican Legion, and at the North Chicago VA as 
a post commander, where she has volun-
teered for nearly two decades. Before the 
onset of the COVID–19 pandemic, she volun-
teered for the bedside care program ‘‘No Vet-
eran Dies Alone.’’ 
Mrs. Horstman’s lifelong commitment to giv-
ing back to the community, her service to her 
country, her groundbreaking career, and her 
work healing people across the Chicagoland 
area are truly remarkable. I appreciate Mrs. 
Horstman’s service to the Chicago community 
and the country, and I wish her a very happy 
100th birthday.

WALTER SCOTT 
HON. JEFF FORTENBERRY 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, life-
long Nebraskan, CEO of Kiewit Construction, 
cofounder of Level 3 Communications, board 
member of Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the 
late Walter Scott, Jr., 90, was one of Amer-
ica’s leading builders and entrepreneurs. He 
will be best remembered, however, for his 
generous and wise philanthropy. Raised dur-
ing the Great Depression, grandson of an im-
migrant carpenter from Dundee, Scotland, 
Walter learned early on the importance of edu-
cation and of institutions that make it possible 
for a person to be educated. His philosophy 
was to enable others to achieve their own per-
sonal success. 
As friend Warren Buffett said, ‘‘Walter’s phi-
lanthropy is legendary, even though he 
doesn’t publicize it.’’ He left an indelible mark 
on Omaha and Nebraska: a new veterans’ 
care center, best-in-class exhibits at Omaha’s 
Henry Doorly Zoo, and the Scott Campus at 
the University of Nebraska at Omaha. His con-
tributions to Colorado State University and the 
University of Nebraska ensure that future gen-
erations of students at those institutions will go 
on to make their own marks as well. 
Walter’s vision and passion extended to 
service on the international stage. He was 
past Chair of the Open World Leadership Cen-
ter—now the Congressional Office for Inter-
national Leadership (COIL)—and a member of 
the Library of Congress Madison Circle. In 
both capacities, he was close friend to long- 
serving Librarian of Congress Dr. James H. 
Billington. Following Billington’s passing in 
2018, Walter provided long-term funding for 
the Billington Initiative at the Wilson Center’s 
Kennan Institute to continue Billington’s legacy 
of scholarship on Russian history and culture. 
Walter Scott had this advice to young peo-
ple: ‘‘The greatest thing you can do in life is 
to be a giver because the world already has 
plenty of takers.’’ May he rest in peace.

IN RECOGNITION OF POST 696 ON 
THE 75TH YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, it is with 
honor that I rise to recognize the American Le-
gion Gung Ho Post 696 as they celebrate their 
75th Anniversary. As the members of Post 
696 celebrate this milestone, I ask all of my 
colleagues to join me in honoring them for al-
ways providing exceptional services to WWII 
veterans and advocating for all veterans in the 
Sacramento Region. 
American Legion Gung Ho Post 696 was 
formed on April 11, 1946 by returning Chi-
nese-American veterans who were unable to 
join existing posts due to the prevailing preju-
dices of the time. The Gung Ho name honors 
the Chinese phrase Gong he, which means 
‘‘working together.’’ Despite having to form a 
segregated post, Post 696 wanted to honor 
these words and honor those who have died 
in service of the United States. The com-
monality of their Chinese heritage created a 
lasting legacy and a sense of brotherhood pro-
moting compassion and charity for all in Sac-
ramento. 
For seventy-five years, from the start of 
Commander Tim Jang to its succeeding and 
current commanders, Post 696 dedicated itself 
to promoting the mission, vision, and values of 
the American Legion in the Sacramento Re-
gion. Their long tradition of advocating on be-
half of all veterans and providing services to 
many individuals has been significant and con-
tinues today. 
Gung Ho Post 696 members are leaders in 
our Sacramento community and have advo-
cated for legislation and resources to benefit 
all veterans. They participate and represent 
Asian Americans by participating in the annual 
Memorial Day service and march in nearly 
every Veterans Day parade in Downtown Sac-
ramento. Today, Post 696 welcomes all vet-
erans to join and strive to promote goodwill in 
Sacramento. 
Madam Speaker, as the members of the 
Post 696 celebrate their 75th anniversary, I 
ask all colleagues to join me in honoring them 
for their service to our country and to the Sac-
ramento area.

AND 
HONORING 
SHRIMAD 
RAJCHANDRAJI 
DUR-
ING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 19, 2021 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to join the many devout followers of 
Jainism in honoring in the month of October 
the life of the remarkable Jain poet, scholar, 
religious leader, and philosopher Shrimad 
Rajchandraji, and to acknowledge his many 
writings, in particular his poetic spiritual mas-
terpiece, Atmasiddhi Shastra. 
Born in 1867 in the Indian port city of 
Vavania, Rajchandraji was drawn to a reli-
gious life from an early age. His spiritual odys-
sey led him to Jainism and its core belief of 
ahimsa or non-violence (the ethical principal of 
not causing harm to other living beings). 
Shrimad Rajchandraji scaled great spiritual 
heights and demystified the path to self-dis-
covery in an effortless manner relevant to the 
contemporary social environment. Even in a 
short life of 34 years, Rajchandraji gave the 
world a rich heritage that continues to guide 
generations of seekers. His life and works 
have been compiled and published in a vol-
ume titled Shrimad Rajchandra, the contents 
of which are an inspiration to turn within and 
discover life’s eternal truths. 
In his early spiritual and philosophical 
writings Rajchandraji wrote about the impor-
tance of women’s education and the practices 
that cultivate the essential mindset of non-at-
tachment, and authored many commentaries 
on spirituality and Jain religious beliefs. 
Shrimad Rajchandraji was a visionary who laid 
the foundations of Jain spirituality for a new 
era. He composed Atmasiddhi Shastra in the 
late 19th century to present the six spiritual 
truths and the path to self-realisation. The 
poem is revered by many seekers as a mas-
terpiece of spiritual enlightenment and guid-
ance. 
In 1891, Rajchandraji was introduced to a 
young Indian lawyer named Mohandas Gan-
dhi. This encounter led to a long friendship 
and mentorship between Rajchandraji and the 
future father of modern India. In his autobiog-
raphy, Gandhi paid homage to his spiritual 
mentor by noting that ‘‘[i]n my moments of 
spiritual crisis, Shrimadji was my refuge.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I also take this opportunity 
to commend Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshji, spir-
itual visionary and global humanitarian leader, 
who has devoted his life to sharing the wis-
dom of Shrimad Rajchandraji through the work 
of 
the 
Shrimad 
Rajchandra 
Mission 
Dharampur. Pujya Gurudevshri Rakeshji’s im-
pact in fostering peace and serving society, 
aligned with Rajchandraji’s philosophy, has 
been recognised by various prestigious forums 
and contemporary spiritual leaders globally. 
Madam Speaker, I want to recognize 
Shrimad Rajchandraji’s teachings on the im-
portance of nonviolence, truth, and peace, 
which are as relevant today as they were to 
Mahatma Gandhi over a century ago, and the 
guidance and comfort provided to his devo-
tees by the epic masterpiece, Atmasiddhi 
Shastra.

It was like being ‘‘tied to the whipping post’’ 
. . . The Allman Brothers, 
looking up all they saw was the back of his 
knees 
Armed with a cannon ‘‘Blue Skies’’ . . . 
Allman Brothers, 
as into the nets all his shots fast would fly 
‘‘It’s nature’s way, it’s nature’s way of tell-
ing you’’ goalies, 
‘‘something’s wrong’’ Spirit goodbye 
As the goal-keepers gave a big sigh of relief, 
saying, ‘‘if that had hit me it be my last’’ 
I’m a lucky guy 
While, Rog and his brothers Radebaugh and 
Urso, 
were the future look in the game of lacrosse 
to reach for the skies 
Like all Modern Day players built on Power, 
Strength, and Speed, 
and like the rest of the Terp Mid-fielders 
who broken the dye 
They trio were ‘‘The Good’’ ‘‘The Bad’’ and 
‘‘The Ugly’’, 
and of a player what more could you ask? 
While, all had the components of each I’ll let 
you sort it out I’ll take a pass 
Taking no prisoners, 
Roger and all The Maryland Lacrosse 
Players lived by a creed 
It was the need for Scoring and the need for 
Speed, 
and NCAA Championships to succeed 
And for all his strength, power and speed, 
Roger you were such a gentle giant we would 
see 
With your big smile going on for miles and 
miles into infinity, 
and as always so calm and cool as could be 
And we can’t remember you ever losing your 
temper Norm, getting angry 
It takes hell of a man, 
to be like you ROG with such a cool and 
calm and steady hand 
Roger my friend ‘‘I heard it in a love song’’ 
Marshall Tucker heaven is yours, 
Roger That! And it won’t be long 
Yea, Roger there are lacrosse teams in heav-
en to which you can belong 
And Coach Beardmore is already up there 
with Coach Renee, 
Rick, Tom, Alan, Mike, and George strong 
Don’t worry Rog, 
when you get your angel wings you’ll be 
back to your old speed moving on 
‘‘And if I leave here tomorrow will you still 
remember me’’ . . . Lynyrd Skynyrd 
Yes, we will Roger in our hearts you’ll never 
leave 
Like Rog ‘‘be a simple kind of man, 
oh be someone you love and understand’’ . . . 
Lynyrd Skynyrd 
‘‘Sun beams shining through his hair, ap-
pearing not to have a care, 
pick up your gear and gypsy roll on . . . roll 
on’’ The Allman Brothers
