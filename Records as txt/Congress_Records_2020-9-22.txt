INEQUALITIES IN COVID–19 
ASSISTANCE DISTRIBUTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the inequalities that 
persist in COVID–19 assistance dis-
tribution. 
Back in March, House Democrats rec-
ognized the global health crisis was 
causing an economic crisis. As Ameri-
cans struggled, we provided them with 
stimulus checks to help them make 
ends 
meet 
during 
these 
uncertain 
times. 
However, not everyone who was enti-
tled to these checks received them. 
The Senate wrongfully included a pro-
vision in the CARES Act that pre-
vented families with only one Amer-
ican citizen parent and another who is 
a tax-paying immigrant with an ITIN 
from receiving this financial assist-
ance. 
Let me repeat this. Citizens of the 
United States are being prevented from 
receiving stimulus checks because of 
whom they love. 
This blatant discrimination must be 
corrected. We need to help people like 
Lacey, an amazing, hardworking cit-
izen who works for the State govern-
ment and isn’t able to receive a stim-
ulus check. Lacey and her spouse have 
been together for 14 years and were 
married in 2010. They have raised six 
beautiful children, all of whom are U.S. 
citizens. 
For the past 7 years, Lacey has 
worked at the Illinois Veterans Home 
in Quincy, Illinois. She works long 
hours to make sure her veteran resi-
dents are safe, healthy, and happy, and 
in March, this job made her an essen-
tial, frontline worker. 
Lacey loves her job and loves her 
residents like they are her own family. 
Since the onset of COVID, she has con-
tinued her hard work and dedication to 
her job. Lacey has picked up overtime 
shifts to cover for coworkers who are 
sick and has worked hard to ensure the 
standards of care at the facility remain 
high. She is a United States citizen 
who works every day to care for our 
Nation’s veterans. 
Despite her service to our country 
and the fact that she and her children 
are American citizens, her family did 
not receive a check, all because her 
spouse is an immigrant using an ITIN 
and they file their taxes jointly. 
She has done everything in her power 
to speak out and advocate for herself 
and has connected with others like her 
in the Facebook group Mixed-Status 
Families United. 
She told me: ‘‘I am being punished 
for who I married. My husband and I 
work and we pay our taxes. Why are we 
being treated like second-class citi-
zens?’’ 
Her words resonate, because she is 
right. She is being treated like a sec-
ond-class citizen. 
I ask you, during a period of unprece-
dented challenges, when Americans are 
facing more than one crisis, when we 
are depending on essential workers 
more than ever, is it right for our 
country to treat people differently 
based on the immigration status of 
their loved ones? 
As a country, I believe we can and 
should do better. There is no scenario 
in which citizens should be denied the 
help they are entitled to. Likewise, 
tax-paying immigrants who are paying 
their fair share should not be denied 
assistance, left out on their own. 
I am pleased that the HEROES Act, 
which the House passed more than 100 
days ago, rectifies this issue and makes 
all tax-paying individuals eligible for a 
check. 
While I believe all taxpayers should 
receive a stimulus check regardless of 
their citizenship status, at the very 
least, we need to ensure that all U.S. 
citizens receive a check regardless of 
who their spouses are, and underscore 
the necessity of including a fix that 
corrects this provision retroactively 
and for any additional stimulus checks 
provided moving forward. 
We must stand with mixed-status 
families and continue to fight for them 
and their rights. Now, more than ever, 
we need to provide for people who are 
suffering due to this pandemic. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
taking swift action to resolve this 
issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4644 
September 22, 2020 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, after too long, Americans are 
waking up to the dangers of the Chi-
nese Communist Party. As we combat 
the economic and the health ramifica-
tions of the coronavirus, it has never 
been more important that we take on 
this hostile regime. 
It has been my honor to serve on the 
China Task Force and help expose the 
threats that the Chinese Communist 
Party poses to our national security 
and to the American people. 
Just 
yesterday, Congressman MI-
CHAEL MCCAUL released the House For-
eign Affairs Committee’s report into 
the origins of the coronavirus pan-
demic. Their evidence clearly confirms 
that the Chinese Communists covered 
up the coronavirus, enabling a local 
outbreak to become a pandemic. 
The Chinese Communist Party knew 
that the coronavirus could be spread by 
human-to-human transmission, and yet 
this regime hid findings from global 
leaders, public health experts, and even 
the World Health Organization. 
Leaders in the Chinese Communist 
Party knew that this virus could be 
catastrophic, and yet they deliberately 
chose to cover up their missteps rather 
than sound an alarm and warn the 
world that this virus was being un-
leashed. 
Their lies cost American livelihoods. 
Their lies cost American lives. This 
pandemic’s 
destruction 
could 
have 
been prevented. This didn’t have to 
happen. 
Now Americans are facing a choice. If 
we do not act now, who will stop the 
Chinese Communist Party from simply 
repeating this coverup? 
Inaction is not an option. America 
must prevent another pandemic from 
reaching our shores. 
And our work cannot stop there. 
Sadly, the Chinese Government’s mali-
cious acts extend far beyond the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
From 
cyberattacks on American citizens and 
blatant overreach into our virtual net-
works, to espionage in our academic in-
stitutions and illicit fentanyl that kills 
on American streets, we cannot ignore 
the Chinese Government’s pervasive 
threats to our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, this is no distraction; 
this is reality. For the safety of the 
American people, for the future of our 
Nation, the Chinese Communist Party 
must be held accountable. 
For months, the China Task Force 
has focused on researching these issues 
and exploring legislative solutions. We 
are currently working on a final report 
that will detail our findings and rec-
ommend a pragmatic path forward. 
While our work on this report is com-
ing to a close, our commitment to the 
cause will continue. 
During these busy days, I recognize 
that many issues are competing for 
America’s time; but to be fair, these 
threats require our action. The Chinese 
Government’s 
coverup 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic requires action. 
The Chinese Government’s persecution 
of Uighurs requires action. The Chinese 
Government’s monopoly of the medical 
supply chain requires action. The Chi-
nese Government’s attempts to control 
the world’s network requires action. 
Despite the challenges that we are 
facing at home, the American people 
must stand together against the Chi-
nese Communist Party. Our national 
security should never be a partisan 
issue. The health of the American peo-
ple should never be a partisan issue. By 
working together, we can strengthen 
our defenses, defend human rights, spur 
innovation, and equip Americans to 
lead the way in global innovation. 
Moving forward, it is imperative that 
America continues to strengthen our 
supply chain, to pursue fair trade deals 
with China, and, ultimately, to hold 
the Chinese Communist Party account-
able for its actions. 
Once again, it has been my privilege 
to serve the American people as a 
member of the China Task Force. I 
thank Leader MCCARTHY for the oppor-
tunity to serve, and I am grateful to 
Chairman MICHAEL
MCCAUL
for his 
leadership. 
This is a long road, but it is worth 
the fight. And as I always believe, 
America will win that fight. 
f 
ALOPECIA AREATA AWARENESS 
MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in solidarity with my fellow 
Americans with alopecia in recognition 
of 
September 
as 
Alopecia 
Areata 
Awareness Month. 
Today, like nearly 7 million Ameri-
cans, I live with alopecia, an auto-
immune disease that attacks the hair 
follicles. This common condition is 
highly unpredictable and cyclical. Hair 
can grow back in or fall out again at 
any time, and the course is different 
for each person. 
Alopecia areata disproportionately 
affects children and Black Americans, 
and particularly Black women. 
Some people may say that it is just 
hair, but for me and for many people 
living with alopecia, hair is intrinsi-
cally linked to our identity and our 
cultural expression. 
We all have our own unique stories 
with 
our 
alopecia 
diagnosis. 
Mine 
began nearly a year ago as my braider 
noticed a small patch of baldness. Very 
soon after, I was waking up to sinks 
full of hair. What started as a few 
small patches quickly spread. 
I remember the moment vividly. I 
was alone in my D.C. apartment, sepa-
rated from my family, on the same day 
that would have been my mother’s 72nd 
birthday and on the eve of an impeach-
ment vote. I was standing in the bath-
room, staring at my reflection in the 
mirror, and for the first time I was 
completely bald. 
For months, I had dreaded the mo-
ment when it would be all gone; but 
looking at myself in the mirror that 
night, I felt relief, peace, and accept-
ance. It was a moment of grace, and I 
thank God for that. 
In a matter of weeks, I would lose my 
eyelashes, eyebrows, and the rest of my 
hair and be diagnosed with alopecia 
universalis, one of three forms of alo-
pecia. 
I am still coming to terms with my 
new alopecia reality and the impact of 
my traumatic hair loss. Every day, 
thanks to the support of my family, 
my staff, the broader alopecia commu-
nity, and others who have experienced 
hair loss, I am making progress. 
I am making progress despite the 
hateful comments, the cruel and con-
stant online harassment about my 
baldness, the intrusive and ignorant 
questions on the elevators, the unsolic-
ited advice, and the stares, lots of 
stares. 
No doubt about it, a bald woman en-
tering a room or entering the floor of 
the U.S. House of Representatives 
makes people uncomfortable. Visually, 
it challenges every antiquated cultural 
norm about what is professional, what 
is pretty, what is feminine. 
But in the loss, the hurt, and the 
ache of it all, I have never lost sight of 
the following: I am Sandy and Martin’s 
daughter; I am Conan’s wife; I am 
Cora’s stepmom; and I am the Con-
gresswoman for the Massachusetts Sev-
enth Congressional District. 
Mr. Speaker, I am now bald, but I am 
in good health and in incredible com-
pany. I have received an outpouring of 
love from people across the globe who 
are living with alopecia. 
Early on, I received a note from an 
elementary school-aged girl with alo-
pecia. She wanted to give me some tips 
in navigating this new normal. She 
told me about the first time she walked 
into school after her diagnosis, ‘‘Just 
walk right up to your friends and tell 
them, ‘I’m still me,’ ’’ she wrote. 
Who couldn’t use a reminder like 
that as they navigate the world? Those 
little acts of kindness and solidarity 
have defined this experience, too. 
I am proud to be in the good com-
pany of those fighting for people living 
with alopecia. There is an entire com-
munity that has been working tire-
lessly to share their stories and to edu-
cate the public on the impact of alope-
cia areata. 
For three decades, the National Alo-
pecia Areata Foundation has been 
working to garner congressional sup-
port for research and treatment devel-
opment. My longtime friend and part-
ner in good, Congressman MCGOVERN, 
introduced legislation to allow medical 
wigs to be covered under the Medicare 
program so that every senior living 
with alopecia can afford wigs and other 
head coverings. 
This year, the House passed my 
amendment to provide an additional $5 
million in next year’s funding for the 
National Institutes of Health, which

will fund research to increase our un-
derstanding of the causes, impacts, and 
possible treatments of alopecia areata. 
I know that our work is far from 
over, and I will continue to fight. I will 
take my seat at the table. I will take 
up space, and I will create it, too; and 
with this space, we will make change. 
Every single person deserves to show 
up in the world exactly as they are 
without fear or discrimination. To my 
fellow alopecians wherever you may be, 
today I bring our story to the floor of 
the people’s House to say that we be-
long, our stories deserve to be heard, 
and we are absolutely beautiful and 
worthy.

THE REPUBLICAN COMMITMENT 
TO AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, maligned policies from Demo-
crats that seek to defund, destroy, and 
dismantle our country are dangerous. 
Quite frankly, these policies pose a 
threat to the liberties and freedoms 
that define the American dream as we 
know it. Republicans understand this 
threat, and we refuse to sit idly on the 
sidelines. 
That is why we have developed our 
Commitment to America. The message 
is simple. Restoring, renewing, and re-
building America is a mandate that we 
must work every day to uphold. We are 
fighting for families, for generations of 
Americans to come, and for a country 
that has always served as a beacon of 
hope to the world. 
In short, it is a blueprint that gets 
our country back on track. The Amer-
ican people deserve leaders who fight 
for freedom, the values that we hold 
dear, and the promise of the American 
Dream. 
Mr. Speaker, at such a pivotal mo-
ment in the history of our country, we 
must work to advance policies that are 
pro-growth, pro-family, and pro-Amer-
ica. Anything less is unacceptable. 
Time and time again Democrats have 
turned their backs on the American 
people with a ‘‘my way or the high-
way’’ approach to legislating. 
This year alone, the House of Rep-
resentatives has taken up a myriad of 
bipartisan messaging bills that do 
nothing to help our country. If any-
thing, these bills send a concerning 
message about the Democrat vision for 
America. 
Substantive 
legislation 
has 
been 
pushed to the back burner, the spirit of 
bipartisanship has been rendered vir-
tually nonexistent, and political pos-
turing has replaced meaningful con-
versations on pressing issues. We have 
had ample opportunities to work to-
gether, but Democrats have taken it 
upon themselves to prolong a partisan 
blockade that stifles progress. 
Mr. Speaker, that is wrong and that 
is not leadership. Leadership is fight-
ing for the American people at every 
turn. Leadership is defending the prom-
ises of the American Dream. Leader-
ship is advancing policies that raise 
America to new heights. 
I am proud to stand alongside Leader 
MCCARTHY
and my Republican col-
leagues as we chart a meaningful path-
way forward. The road ahead may seem 
uncertain, or even arduous, but we are 
confident that with steadfast leader-
ship and commonsense policies, Amer-
ica will flourish. 
f 
BIRTH OF THE HERO ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. BERA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the passage of my bipar-
tisan measure, H.R. 1646, the Helping 
Emergency Responders Overcome Act, 
or the HERO Act. 
The HERO Act is the best of what we 
do in this people’s House, which is ac-
cessible to our constituents and others, 
and that is why we love the House of 
Representatives. 
Over 21⁄2 years ago, two of my fire 
chiefs, Mike McLaughlin and Maurice 
Johnson, visited my office here in 
Washington to talk about some issues. 
In passing, they also talked about the 
number of firefighters and first re-
sponders that succumb to suicide, and 
the stresses of the job. 
We talked about it and we started to 
do a little bit of research. We realized 
we didn’t have good statistics on the 
actual incidence of firefighters or first 
responders that were succumbing to 
suicide. 
We started to talk to others, the 
International 
Association 
of 
Fire-
fighters, and we talked to law enforce-
ment. We realized the stresses that 
these individuals, men and women, who 
are out there protecting our commu-
nities every day, face. They see untold 
challenges that normal human beings 
don’t see. So we started talking about 
this. 
We looked for those statistics, talked 
to the Firefighter Behavioral Health 
Alliance founder, Jeff Dill, and again, 
realized we ought to challenge the CDC 
to collect these statistics, and we 
ought to do something about it. We 
ought to help relieve the suffering of 
these first responders, firefighters, law 
enforcement individuals. 
So we went about writing a bill and 
working with our partners. That was 
before the COVID–19 pandemic hit. 
What we have seen since the pandemic 
is untold pressures on our frontline 
healthcare workers, our nurses, the 
folks in the hospitals. And I want to 
applaud a fellow doctor, a Republican 
Member, MIKE
BURGESS, who is the 
ranking member on the Energy and 
Commerce Healthcare Subcommittee, 
he realized this fact. And working to-
gether with our staff, we amended the 
HERO Act to include and recognize the 
unique stresses that these frontline 
healthcare workers are facing. 
We talked about how they don’t need 
to suffer by themselves, how we could 
put in place peer-to-peer contacts 
where folks could reach out, create a 
space for some of these individuals that 
might be suffering alone to talk about 
what was going on. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank 
Chairman PALLONE and Ranking Mem-
ber WALDEN on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, as well as the chair-
woman of the Energy and Commerce 
Health Subcommittee, Ms. ESHOO, for 
helping get this bill to the floor and 
getting it passed yesterday evening. 
Again, the HERO Act demonstrates 
what we can do when we come together 
as Democrats and Republicans, when 
we listen to our constituents, and we 
work with those folks that are out 
there. 
I, again, want to applaud the front-
line 
healthcare 
workers, 
the 
fire-
fighters, the law enforcement individ-
uals, and emergency responders that 
are out there keeping us safe every 
day. You have got our back, we have 
got your back. So thank you to all of 
them.

RECOGNIZING THE SCHEDULER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to thank a group of courageous 
Federal employees: Matt Nordquist; 
Janet Hartman, now Schmautz; Jake 
Gibson; 
Carren 
Crossley; 
Virginia 
Mueller, 
now 
Partridge; 
Jordan 
Haverly; Joy Henrichs; Perry Ford 
Stamp; and Molly Mackenzie Harris. 
There is no more difficult job in 
Washington than that of a congres-
sional scheduler. My thanks and apolo-
gies go to those who served in my of-
fice these past 24 years. 
For me, being away from home was 
the worst part of the job. Who booked 
the flight and told me I had to get back 
to D.C.? The scheduler did. Who would 
meet me in the office at 7:30 a.m. to get 
me to a breakfast meeting at 8 a.m.? 
Who would hang around to pick me up 
at 9 a.m., just to race me to the Hill for 
a 9 a.m. meeting? The scheduler did. 
Who received an irate call from me 
wondering why no one was at the meet-
ing in HC–5, only to be told that if I 
had looked at my schedule, I would 
have seen that the meeting location 
had changed to the Capitol Hill Club? 
The scheduler did. 
Who took the frustrating call asking 
how I can be in a meeting in the Cap-
itol from 10:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., and then 
in my office in the Rayburn Building 
for an 11 a.m. meeting? The scheduler 
did. Who took the blame when I finally 
cried out that I needed a bathroom 
break 
after 
consecutive 
30-minute 
meetings? The scheduler did. Who 
picked me up after votes at 6:30 p.m. to 
hit a reception at 6:45 p.m., another

one at 7 p.m., and then dinner at an-
other location at 7:30 p.m.? The sched-
uler did. 
Who scheduled the flight to get me 
home, and then had to sweat as to 
whether I could make the early flight 
or not? Who received my continuous 
calls asking them if I thought I could 
make it? The scheduler did. Who wait-
ed in the car for that final vote just to 
see me run down the stairs and tell 
them, let’s go, just to get caught in 
traffic in the plaza, traffic on Inde-
pendence Avenue, and traffic on Inter-
state 395? The scheduler did. 
Who had to put up with the worst 
backseat driver in Washington, D.C.? 
The scheduler did. My schedulers took 
the brunt of my frustration as we tried 
to fit 36 hours of work into a 24-hour 
day. They took the barbs of criticism 
when I missed my family. 
If there was ever a single group that 
I need to apologize to, it is them. Hav-
ing said this, this group of workers pro-
fessionally conducted their job with 
poise, confidence, efficiency, and com-
passion. I can say without hesitation 
that because of me, the toughest job in 
my office is that of the scheduler. 
Matt, Janet, Jake Carren, Virginia, 
Jordan, Joy, Perry, and Molly, I thank 
you.

WE 
MUST 
ADVANCE 
URGENTLY 
NEEDED CORONAVIRUS ASSIST-
ANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TONKO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, this body 
must 
advance 
urgently 
needed 
coronavirus assistance. 
Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices Alex Azar said, ‘‘Every death we 
experience is a tragedy.’’ When he said 
it, the United States had just hit the 
grim milestone of 100,000 souls lost 
from the COVID pandemic. That was 
mid-May, around the same time Demo-
crats advanced the HEROES Act in the 
House. In the 4 months that followed, 
100,000 more Americans have died as 
the epidemic has spiraled out of con-
trol, and chaos has continued to reign 
from the White House. 
We have reached the breaking point. 
Plain and simple, it is time for the 
Senate to pass our comprehensive res-
cue package or offer a real alternative 
of their own. No more waiting. No 
more excuses. 
Throughout this crisis, the Senate 
majority has abdicated responsibility 
to this President’s insufficient leader-
ship and papered over his deadly short-
comings. For the lives and livelihood of 
every one of my constituents, I beg my 
colleagues on the other side of the Cap-
itol to seize this moment to follow a 
new guide. 
Let that guide be science. Let it be 
truth, because politics, really, truly 
bad politics, has brought America low 
in the face of this crisis. But it is not 
too late. 
On January 22, President Trump 
tweeted ‘‘China has been working very 
hard to contain the coronavirus. The 
United States greatly appreciates their 
efforts and transparency.’’ He made 
similar remarks again on January 30 
and on February 7. The very same day 
President Trump was privately admit-
ting to journalist Bob Woodward that 
the coronavirus is an airborne patho-
gen more deadly than the flu. 
Despite his full awareness of the dan-
ger, he kept going, praising China and 
publicly downplaying the coronavirus 
threat. Politico has found at least 15 
examples of President Trump publicly 
praising China’s coronavirus response 
during this period, including on Feb-
ruary 10, 13, 18, 23, 26, 27, and 29. He said 
it over and over. 
In the following weeks and months, 
he would repeatedly downplay the dan-
ger and suggest, fully aware of his de-
ception, that this virus was comparable 
to a seasonal flu. 
President Trump’s deception on these 
matters is not opinion, he was re-
corded. He is literally on the record 
saying that he intended to downplay 
this disease and deny the American 
people the information we would need 
to make vital decisions for ourselves, 
our families, our communities, and in-
deed, our Nation. 
Every death that resulted from this 
was a tragedy. In February, President 
Trump said, ‘‘It is going to disappear 
one day. It is like a miracle, it will dis-
appear.’’ He knew better. 
At this point the virus had been 
given nearly 2 months to circulate un-
checked. Americans were still going 
about our daily lives, flocking to movie 
theaters, churches, synagogues, going 
to Mardi Gras, going on spring break, 
unaware of the true extent of the 
threats spreading all around us. 
On March 11, President Trump took 
only his second major national step, 
another travel ban. It was around this 
time that Congress stepped up the 
scale of our response to this threat. We 
moved quickly to pass the CARES Act, 
including delivering emergency funds 
for America’s hospital and staff, small 
business owners, laid off workers, and 
everyday Americans facing unprece-
dented fear and uncertainty. 
The CARES Act was a rescue plan. It 
wasn’t perfect, but it was America’s 
first real effort to stem the tide. That 
rescue was powerful, but it was no sub-
stitute for executive leadership. Sadly, 
we are still waiting for executive lead-
ership. 
Between March and May, America 
saw its death toll skyrocket past 
100,000. The Members of this Chamber 
again moved swiftly to advance an-
other rescue package, the HEROES 
Act. Since the House passed the HE-
ROES Act on May 15, more than 110,000 
Americans have died of COVID–19. 
For comparison, this is the equiva-
lent of losing every soul living in Al-
bany, New York, our State capital, 
that I represent. And that is just the 
recorded death toll since mid-May. 
Senate 
Majority 
Leader 
MITCH 
MCCONNELL
responded 
that 
States 
should file for bankruptcy instead, and 
the Senate would wait and see. Wait 
for what? Haven’t we seen? We have 
waited 4 months and paid dearly for it. 
Enough of this craven politics. 
Senators, consider your oath to the 
people you serve. What will you say 
when they ask what you did to stop 
this disease from stealing their loved 
ones; from destroying their small busi-
ness? What will you say to the teachers 
that are being laid off as States and 
cities drastically cut their budgets? 
From undermining America’s standing 
in the world? 
To my colleagues, I say this: We have 
a plan. Join us. Let’s invest heavily in 
research and follow science and public 
health guidance. They are the fastest 
route to get us to the other side of this 
crisis. Our HEROES Act gets it done. 
Let’s deliver emergency funding to 
sustain local essential services, and the 
salaries of first responders, nurses, 
teachers, infrastructure maintenance 
workers, and many more. The HEROES 
Act gets that done, too. Let’s save lives 
and turn the corner on this crisis with 
a coordinated national plan for testing 
and tracing. The HEROES Act gets it 
done. 
Let’s deliver the financial support 
our 
essential 
workers, 
unemployed 
workers, 
and 
financially 
strained 
Americans need to weather the storm. 
The HEROES Act gets it done. Let’s 
rescue our schools, our healthcare pro-
viders, 
our 
first 
responders, 
our 
hungriest families. The Republican 
skinny bill just doesn’t get it done. I 
say pass the HEROES Act.

bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the

HONORING HAROLD LEE DICK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Harold Lee 
Dick, Gunner’s Mate Second Class, who 
was one of 43 brave men who paid the 
ultimate sacrifice on July 24, 1944, 
aboard the USS Colorado. 
While serving aboard the USS Colo-
rado, Gunner’s Mate Second Class Dick 
supported landings on Tarawa, the 
Marshall Islands, Saigon, Guam, and 
Tinian, where he ultimately lost his 
life. 
Although he was initially listed as 
missing in action, his body and those of 
his deceased shipmates were recovered 
and preserved in the 4th Marine Divi-
sion Cemetery on Saipan. Once the war 
had ended, Dick’s remains were pre-
served for identification and transpor-
tation back to the United States. 
Unfortunately, Gunner’s Mate Sec-
ond Class Dick’s remains were unable 
to be identified, so he was buried as un-
known at the Manila American Ceme-
tery 
in 
the 
Philippines. 
However,

thanks to modern forensic techniques, 
Gunner’s Mate Second Class Harold 
Dick was identified on November 26, 
2018. 
Now, after 76 years, Harold Lee Dick 
will finally be returning to his home-
town of Tipton, Missouri, on October 10 
to be laid to rest next to his parents 
and his sister. 
Please join me in honoring Gunner’s 
Mate Second Class Harold Lee Dick’s 
ultimate sacrifice as he finally returns 
home. 
CONGRATULATING ERNIE CECIL 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate my good friend 
Ernie Cecil on his retirement after 
serving nearly 28 years as senior pastor 
at Antioch Southern Baptist Church. 
Ernie impacted the lives of so many 
through 
his 
weekly 
services 
and 
through the pivotal role he played in 
our community as a spiritual leader. 
During his time at Antioch, Ernie ex-
panded the reach of the church by 
using modern technology during serv-
ices, a revamped website, and social 
media pages. 
During the pandemic, Ernie was in-
strumental in establishing a drive-in 
worship service even though it pro-
longed his retirement. These virtual 
services, complete with live music, 
united our community during these dif-
ficult times. 
Through his love for his community, 
his leadership, and his dedication to his 
faith, Ernie touched the lives of many 
people during his time at Antioch 
Southern Baptist. His legacy of love 
and service will be felt into eternity. 
Missouri’s Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict is blessed to have Cecil serving 
others and the Lord. 
Mr. Speaker, let us wish Ernie the 
best and God’s richest blessings in his 
well-deserved retirement. 
RECOGNIZING KEN AND SUE MOLZAHN 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to give recognition to Ken and 
Sue Molzahn, the owners of the world’s 
largest display of American Revolu-
tionary War-era flags. 
Recently, I visited their collection in 
Collins, Missouri, and was able to see 
over 315 replica flags used by American 
colonists and their allies from 1764 to 
1781. I was very impressed by their ex-
tensive collection and their knowledge 
of the history behind each individual 
flag. 
During his high school teaching ca-
reer, Ken began researching Revolu-
tionary War-era flags and re-creating 
them for his students. Eventually, Sue, 
a skilled seamstress, joined his efforts 
and has contributed hand-sewn, mu-
seum-quality replica flags to the col-
lection. 
Today, Ken and Sue’s prominent col-
lection of flags serves as an incredible 
learning tool and an interactive way of 
keeping history alive. 
I greatly appreciate Ken and Sue for 
taking time to show me their flag col-
lection. It is a unique educational ex-
perience that highlights the courage 
and sacrifice of our first patriots. 
HONORING BLAKE HURST 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and thank Mr. Blake 
Hurst. 
Blake has led the Missouri Farm Bu-
reau as president since 2010 with com-
passion, family values, fierce support 
for his members’ needs, and a dose of 
creative humor. 
Blake understands agriculture is a 
family affair as he raises row crops 
with his father, brothers, nephews, and 
sons-in-law, while also operating a 
greenhouse business with his wife, 
daughter, and sons-in-law. 
As Blake prepares to retire at the 
end of this year, his legacy will con-
tinue to serve as an inspiration for 
those of us who have worked alongside 
him as he aggressively advanced Farm 
Bureau’s priorities for the past 25 
years. 
It has been an absolute honor to 
work with Blake and his team through-
out the years, and Missouri’s agri-
culture industry is better because of 
his leadership. 
I sincerely hope Blake will be able to 
enjoy a well-deserved retirement amid 
the farm, the greenhouse, and the 
grandkids, and I wish him the best. 
HONORING SCOTT PHILLIPS 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Scott Phillips as 
the recipient of the annual Chairman’s 
Award during the 2020 Missouri Pork 
Expo. 
I first met Scott when we were chil-
dren and his dad wanted to talk to my 
dad about raising hogs. Scott’s dad had 
served in the Air Force and wanted to 
try his hand at farming. 
Scott followed in his dad’s footsteps, 
serving his Nation flying A10 jets in 
the Air Force and then returning to his 
lifelong passion of farming, expanding 
the operation and now operating two 
hog farms with his brother and nephew. 
Scott’s dedication to producers and 
his positive influence on the pork in-
dustry can be seen throughout his lead-
ership roles, from the local level to the 
national level. 
I wish Scott the best and am proud to 
represent him.

COMMEMORATING NATIVE AMER-
ICAN HERITAGE MONTH BY HON-
ORING THE PONCA TRIBE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate Native Amer-
ican Heritage Month by honoring the 
Ponca Tribe of Nebraska on their 30th 
anniversary of restoration as a feder-
ally recognized Tribe. 
The Ponca Tribe was originally part 
of the Omaha Tribe and settled near 
the Niobrara River of Nebraska in 1793. 
In 1877, the Ponca Tribe was forcibly 
removed from their beloved Niobrara 
River homeland and sent to Indian ter-
ritory in central Oklahoma. 
During their first year in Oklahoma, 
25 percent of the Ponca Tribe died from 
malaria and starvation. Among the 
dead was Chief Standing Bear’s eldest 
son Bear Shield, who had pleaded to be 
laid to rest in their sacred burial 
grounds. A few weeks later, in January 
of 1879, Chief Standing Bear began the 
600-mile trek to their Niobrara home-
land. 
Just 2 days shy of their homeland, 
during a brief stop at the Omaha res-
ervation, the group was stopped and ar-
rested for leaving Oklahoma. The ar-
rest led to the landmark case of Stand-
ing Bear v. Crook, which established 
the precedent of recognizing ‘‘Indian’’ 
as an equal person under the law, in-
cluding the constitutional guarantee of 
fair treatment during trial. 
At the end of the trial, Chief Stand-
ing Bear delivered a speech demanding 
equality, with the famous words: ‘‘That 
hand is not the color of yours, but if I 
prick it, the blood will flow, and I shall 
feel pain. The blood is the same color 
as yours. God made me, and I am a 
man.’’ After the trial, Chief Standing 
Bear and his companions were allowed 
to return to their Niobrara homeland. 
However, in 1962, Congress decided 
the Ponca Tribe would be among the 
Tribes no longer recognized. Two dec-
ades later, in 1986, the Northern Ponca 
Restoration Committee was created by 
Fred LeRoy, a veteran and a Ponca 
himself. Within 2 years, LeRoy drafted 
the petition for restoration, and the 
Ponca Tribe met the requirements of 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs for Fed-
eral recognition. 
On October 31, 1990, the legislation 
was signed into law, and the Ponca 
were once again recognized by the Fed-
eral Government. Fred LeRoy was then 
named chairman of the Ponca Tribe of 
Nebraska. 
Although the Ponca Tribe will still 
be without a reservation, they have es-
tablished 
service 
delivery 
areas 
throughout Nebraska, Iowa, and South 
Dakota. These areas have centers offer-
ing health, social, domestic violence, 
and education services. One such cen-
ter was aptly named the Fred LeRoy 
Health and Wellness Center. 
Through the tremendous efforts of 
Chairman LeRoy and subsequent lead-
ers, the Ponca have not only preserved 
but further cultivated their heritage. 
Current Chairman Larry Wright, Jr., 
considers 
his 
proudest 
accomplish-
ments to be the purchase of 1,800 acres 
of the original homeland, including 
Chief Standing Bear’s burial site. 
Chairman WRIGHT, Jr., illustrated 
the belief that because their ancestors 
are buried in the Niobrara River Val-
ley, Ponca DNA is infused within the 
land, water, animals, and everything 
that grows there, completing the circle 
of life. 
Today, three different statues pay 
tribute to the fearless leader Chief 
Standing Bear. One statue resides in 
Centennial Mall of Lincoln, Nebraska, 
and another overlooks the Niobrara 
homeland. Finally, a bronze statue of 
Chief Standing Bear stands in its right-
ful place in Statuary Hall in the U.S.

Capitol, representing the State of Ne-
braska. With these three monuments, 
thousands of Nebraskans and millions 
from around the world will come now 
to know the Poncas and their story. 
Unfortunately, social disconnects of 
racial disparity and basic human rights 
still exist in our country. In recog-
nizing the Ponca Tribe’s abundant his-
tory, we highlight a story of oppres-
sion, despair, struggle, and persever-
ance. 
Today, we honor and celebrate the 
Ponca Tribe of Nebraska and every Na-
tive American once considered a half 
person. American author and civil 
rights activist Audre Lorde once said: 
‘‘It is not our differences that divide 
us. It is our inability to recognize, ac-
cept, and celebrate those differences.’’ 
Now more than ever, we must unite as 
Americans and celebrate our diversity 
to heal the wounds of social injustice.

BIODEFENSE MUST BE 
BIPARTISAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, today, I rise in recognition of the 
passage of H.R. 7574, the Strengthening 
America’s Strategic National Stock-
pile Act, which builds on the bipartisan 
work done by the Energy and Com-
merce Committee on pandemic pre-
paredness issues. 
I am honored to have co-led this bi-
partisan bill with my colleague Con-
gresswoman SLOTKIN from Michigan. I 
also thank Ranking Member BURGESS 
and Chairwoman ESHOO, who has been 
a longtime champion on biodefense 
issues, and importantly, the Energy 
and Commerce Committee staff for 
their tireless bipartisan work on this 
legislation. 
I think all of us can agree that bio-
defense must be a bipartisan issue. 
COVID–19 has clearly exposed weak-
nesses in our Nation’s public health in-
frastructure. 
I have spent a good part of my career 
in Congress focused on biodefense and 
pandemic response legislation. 
I became a U.S. attorney back in 
2001, just one month after the 9/11 at-
tacks on our country. Shortly after 
that were the anthrax attacks here on 
our Nation’s Capitol. In my U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office, we actually received a 
hoax anthrax attack, which served as a 
stark reminder of the importance of 
staying vigilant and the threat that 
even a single individual can pose. 
As former chairwoman of the House 
Homeland Security Subcommittee on 
Emergency 
Preparedness, 
Response, 
and Communications, we worked on 
things like Project BioShield. 
When we talk about biodefense, peo-
ple often think about things more com-
monly known: chemical, biological, ra-
diological, or nuclear threats. Pan-
demic threats though are yet, as we are 
learning, some of the most dangerous 
threats to everyday Americans. 
Every 
bit 
as 
complex 
as 
cyber 
threats, more of an imminent threat in 
the 21st century than even conven-
tional conflicts, biothreats can come 
from anywhere. Bad actors, malicious 
organizations or nation-states, random 
industrial accidents, or even an act of 
nature can be the original source. And 
once events like this begin to unfold, 
they can be extremely hard to predict 
and respond to. 
That is why I am glad that we con-
tinue to focus on this and have been 
proud to have been part of coleading 
the package, which we hope will dra-
matically improve our Nation’s ability 
to respond to these threats. I am very 
proud that Congress came together to 
get this done. 
The Strategic National Stockpile is a 
cornerstone of our Nation’s biodefense 
infrastructure. It is responsible for 
keeping large quantities of pharma-
ceuticals, 
medical 
countermeasures, 
personal protective equipment, and 
other lifesaving products for rapid de-
ployment in the event of an emer-
gency. 
This bill builds on the bipartisan 
work done by the Energy and Com-
merce Committee when last year, in 
June 2019, the Pandemic All-Hazards 
Preparedness Act was reauthorized and 
signed into law by President Trump. 
Our committee’s work has continued to 
improve our Nation’s response to pan-
demic events. 
I commend Ranking Member WALDEN 
and Ranking Member GUTHRIE of the 
Oversight 
and 
Investigations 
Sub-
committee for their incredible work on 
Energy and Commerce Committee’s 
Second Wave Preparedness Project. 
This critical report will serve as the 
most detailed analysis thus far of our 
Nation’s public health response to 
date, and some of their recommenda-
tions were in this legislative package. 
The Strengthening America’s Stra-
tegic National Stockpile Act addresses 
these shortcomings and will improve 
the ability of the SNS to manage and 
maintain its inventory, empower it to 
partner with industry to reshore some 
of our most critical manufacturing in-
frastructure, 
dramatically 
increase 
transparency of the stockpile, and cre-
ate innovative new programs to help 
States create their own stockpiles. 
I thank all the Members of the House 
for their unanimous support of this im-
portant legislation because biodefense 
must be bipartisan to keep this coun-
try safe.

UNLEASHING THE SPIRIT OF THE 
AMERICAN DREAM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
as the chairman of the Republican 
Study Committee’s American Worker 
Task Force. This task force was estab-
lished to provide policy recommenda-
tions to empower millions of American 
workers to reclaim their version of the 
American Dream. 
This task force, really, Mr. Speaker, 
is all about the American Dream, 
which is the idea that the condition of 
your birth should not determine the 
outcome of your life and that, in Amer-
ica, because of the blessings of freedom 
that we are given, anyone, regardless 
of race, color, creed, gender, or any sta-
tion in life, through hard work, persist-
ence, and determination, can achieve 
upward mobility, can achieve his or her 
God-given potential, and can realize 
that American Dream. 
This afternoon, the American Worker 
Task Force will unveil its report to 
change flawed policies from Wash-
ington, D.C., to unleash the spirit of 
the American Dream and to give work-
ers their opportunity at upward mobil-
ity. 
First, we are going to propose policy 
changes that will refocus labor policy 
to unleash American workers and allow 
them to realize their God-given poten-
tial. This includes increasing opportu-
nities for apprenticeships, not just De-
partment 
of 
Labor, 
Washington-di-
rected, centrally planned registered ap-
prenticeships, 
apprenticeships 
that 
may or may not yield fruitful careers 
in in-demand jobs in the labor market, 
in the real world, but, instead, also rec-
ognizing apprenticeships that are in-
dustry-recognized, industry-driven, and 
that meet the jobs that are actually 
available in the labor market. 
We are going to be proposing ideas 
about eliminating overly restrictive 
occupational 
licensing 
requirements 
and giving workers greater flexibility 
in the way they are compensated, to 
choose comp time as opposed to just 
overtime. 
Secondly, we want to reimagine our 
failed welfare policies to remove the 
trap of government dependency and, in-
stead, create a system that propels 
American individuals and families to 
extraordinary success and prosperity. 
This includes providing alternatives 
to the failed Housing First policies: to 
provide Americans access in housing 
assistance with wraparound services to 
actually meet those individuals where 
they are; to provide them with career 
counseling and perhaps, if needed, ad-
diction recovery services and financial 
literacy. 
We want second-chance employees to 
have access to the labor market. 
Whether they have been incarcerated 
before, whether they are struggling 
with an addiction, whether they have 
failed to get the skills that they need, 
we believe that second-chance and 
third-chance employees are desperately 
needed in America’s economy today. 
We also want work incentives for 
able-bodied, work-capable adults, espe-
cially those without dependents, be-
cause we know that work is a blessing; 
work is not a punishment. 
And, third, we want to refine our edu-
cation system to debunk the bachelors-

or-bust mentality, to encourage inno-
vative careers and better equip Amer-
ican workers with the skills they need 
to adapt and thrive in the ever-chang-
ing 21st century economy. That means 
in preparing people for higher edu-
cation, it is not just about a 4-year de-
gree; it is also about career and tech-
nical education, skills-based education. 
We believe that there should be de-
ductibility for up-skilling so that em-
ployers can give workers the skills 
that are needed for them to move and 
advance in their careers. 
We think there should be trans-
parency outcomes in higher education. 
And we think, to deal with the student 
loan debt crisis, we need to recognize 
that the return on investment is very 
important, and career and technical 
education can provide that oppor-
tunity. 
We believe in income-sharing agree-
ments as an alternative to the debt 
trap of Federal student loans. 
The policies that constitute these 
three key policy platforms are the re-
sult of over a year and a half of delib-
erations by task force members. We 
conducted listening sessions with think 
tanks and policy experts, small busi-
ness owners, and workers from across 
our districts. 
Mr. Speaker, in the Sixth Congres-
sional District of Kentucky, which I 
represent in Congress, I have already 
seen the benefits of investing in career 
and technical education and job train-
ing. 
The Kentucky Welding Institute in 
Fleming County, Kentucky, graduates 
students in less than 6 months, ready-
ing them for careers in welding that 
can earn them over $100,000 a year. 
In Estill County, Kentucky, the Es-
till County Area Technical Center, cur-
rently under construction, will be a 
state-of-the-art job training facility 
that is scheduled to open in August of 
2021. Kentuckians will train for jobs in 
advanced manufacturing, in diesel me-
chanics, health sciences, information 
technology and science technology, en-
gineering and math, in addition to 
many other industries. 
I am proud to have supported a $4 
million grant from the Economic De-
velopment Administration that will 
yield a return on investment in just a 
few months, graduating taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, this report could not be 
a more timely endeavor in the face of 
the COVID–19 pandemic and the ensu-
ing economic uncertainty that has fol-
lowed. 
Although progrowth tax, regulatory, 
and trade policies have enabled unem-
ployment to come back down to single 
digits and the stock market to re-
bound, Americans still need Congress 
to take up a bold, comprehensive agen-
da to pave the way for more jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage everyone to 
consider these very important pro-
worker recommendations.

HONORING KELLY KREEGER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, sadly, I 
rise today to honor a friend, Ms. KELLY 
Kreeger, who lost her life this past 
summer on July 5. 
Kelly was killed in a midair collision 
above the lake at Coeur d’Alene, Idaho. 
She was, indeed, doing what she loved 
as a flier, as an aviation enthusiast, 
and as a pilot. 
Her loss is felt throughout our dis-
trict by her friends, her family, and 
even, very personally, our office. We 
have one of our offices at the Auburn 
Airport, so our interactions with her 
and other aviators was quite frequent. 
Like many in Placer County in 
northern California, we are mourning 
the loss of this friend, a patriot. She 
was such a good, genuine person, whom 
I got to know personally through our 
many interactions. 
She devoted much of her time to our 
community, to our veterans, and it is 
through Kelly, of course, that I met 
and formed a friendship with a great, 
great veteran, Colonel Bud Anderson, 
who is a World War II triple ace fighter 
pilot. It was just this summer she orga-
nized an event for him at his home to 
honor him for his birthday. 
I am very grateful to Kelly for the in-
troduction to Colonel Anderson, of 
course, a man I am honored to call my 
friend as well. 
She frequently staffed and organized 
the events in the community for Colo-
nel Bud that were certainly befitting 
his World War II accomplishments. 
They had a street naming for him near 
the airfield, just so many ways that he 
was to be honored properly. What a 
great man he is, and so their associa-
tion was certainly a natural one. 
My staff and I are blessed, of course, 
to be part of the many events that 
Kelly was famous for. Included were 
several P–51 Mustang flyovers, which 
anybody who loves aircraft loves those; 
the Never Forget series; road dedica-
tions, as I mentioned, at the Auburn 
Airport named for Colonel Bud; birth-
day parties for Colonel Bud; and, of 
course, honoring the men and women 
of World War II, the Greatest Genera-
tion. 
Whenever Kelly would call, you knew 
that something wonderful was about to 
happen that she had planned. It was 
the sort of thing that could make you 
stand up a little taller and get your 
red, white, and blue out. 
Kelly, of course, being a great pa-
triot, loved the United States of Amer-
ica, from her American flag cowgirl 
boots to the infectious smile she shared 
with all she met. Indeed, that captures 
who she is right there in that photo. 
You wouldn’t hardly see her without a 
smile, especially when she was taking 
part in her much-greater-than-a-hobby 
love for aircraft, aviation, and the peo-
ple and the veterans associated. 
As I mentioned, it was my privilege 
to be part of the Flag Day Parade for 
Colonel Bud in Auburn as well. She 
brought together children, Jeeps, clas-
sic cars, and even a flyover to bring 
Colonel Bud that much more joy. 
During this time of pandemic when 
everybody is shut in, of course, we all 
shared that same joy. It brought a 
sense of community, a sense of remem-
bering who America is, even though we 
have all been pent up for all this time 
that, indeed, this virus is temporary 
and we will be together as a commu-
nity once again. 
Our Nation and its people are strong, 
and nothing will stop us from cele-
brating our heroes. Kelly embodied 
that. 
Kelly was known to like loud, fast 
cars, indeed, after my own heart there 
as well. She was able to rebuild an en-
gine herself and was not afraid of any 
hard work. 
She is survived by her mother, 
Nancy, and two sisters; her brother, 
David; many nieces and nephews; and 
her lifelong best friend, Vicki. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that Members 
please join me in prayers for Kelly’s 
family and friends in this difficult 
time. Join with my office as we person-
ally feel this pain of her loss. 
At this time, we just ask blessings on 
Kelly and those closest to her. God 
bless her. 
We will never forget you.

WE 
SHOULD 
NEVER 
AGAIN 
DE-
PEND ON FOREIGN SUPPLIERS 
FOR 
SUPPLIES 
WE 
NEED 
TO 
KEEP AMERICANS SAFE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commend and thank my col-
leagues in the House for passing my 
bill, the Strengthening America’s Stra-
tegic National Stockpile Act, with bi-
partisan, unanimous consent to ensure 
we never again depend on foreign sup-
pliers for supplies we need to keep 
Americans safe. 
This bill was truly a bipartisan ef-
fort: 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans 
joined me in introducing the bill. It 
was endorsed by the bipartisan Prob-
lem Solvers Caucus and passed out of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
on a similar unanimous, bipartisan 
vote. 
At a time when divisions in Congress 
can seem insurmountable, this bill is 
an example of what we can accomplish, 
even in our country’s most challenging 
moments, when we focus on the mis-
sion. 
In this bill, we are responding to the 
mission to ensure that we never repeat 
what we went through in the early 
days of the COVID outbreak. 
Amidst uncertainty and fear, my of-
fice received frantic calls and emails 
day after day in March and April from 
essential workers begging for help. As 
cases of COVID surged, our hospitals 
and frontline workers simply did not 
have the protective equipment nec-
essary to keep themselves safe. 
I heard from a physician in Brighton 
who compared his job to being a soldier

on the front lines wearing a T-shirt and 
a baseball cap instead of body armor 
and a helmet. 
I heard from nurses in Mason who 
had to share one gown—not per person, 
but per entire staff. 
I heard from doctors, nurses, and 
first responders who were bravely an-
swering the call to serve their country, 
yet they were battling this deadly dis-
ease with improvised face shields and 
homemade solutions. 
In my home State of Michigan, we re-
quested millions of medical supplies 
from the Federal Strategic National 
Stockpile. Michigan needed millions of 
masks, gowns, face shields, and ven-
tilators. It quickly became clear that 
the aid we sought from our national 
stockpile was delayed and insufficient. 
The supplies we did receive were woe-
fully inadequate to meet the moment. 
Some masks arrived so far beyond 
their expiration date that they were 
starting to mold. 
I found myself doing anything and 
everything I could to secure personal 
protective equipment for Michigan, 
calling dozens of mask manufacturers, 
negotiating with suppliers in China, 
and fighting for each and every ship-
ment. My staff remembers some sleep-
less nights on the phone working to get 
doctors and nurses in Michigan enough 
supplies for just a few more days’ work 
in the hospital. 
At the same time, manufacturers 
across my district stepped up to help 
fill the void and started retooling their 
businesses to manufacture personal 
protective equipment for our frontline 
workers. 
In Oxford, Michigan, Vaughn Hockey 
jumped into action, taking the special-
ized nylon that they used to make 
hockey pads and turning it into wash-
able hospital gowns. 
Magna International, in my town of 
Holly, Michigan, retooled their car seat 
fabric assembly line to make masks for 
workers and suppliers. 
It 
was 
American 
ingenuity 
and 
Michigan grit at its finest. 
This experience shook me to my core, 
and I immediately got to work with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
draft legislation to ensure that Amer-
ica is better prepared for the next pan-
demic or the next phase of COVID. 
Our bill, the Strengthening Amer-
ica’s National Stockpile Act, was the 
product of our bipartisan collaboration 
and makes important fixes to our na-
tional stockpile for medical supplies so 
that it is fully stocked, maintained, 
and ready whenever Michigan and 
other States across the country need 
it. 
b 1000 
This is even more important as we 
see the number of COVID cases across 
the country continue to increase. This 
bill requires constant upkeep to make 
sure that the items in the stockpile 
aren’t expired. It infuses transparency 
into how supplies are distributed from 
the stockpile, and it helps States cre-
ate their own stockpiles. 
Second, it strengthens the stockpile’s 
finances. It makes efficient use of tax-
payer dollars and prevents waste by al-
lowing the stockpile to sell excess sup-
plies to other agencies. It also ensures 
that 
taxpayers 
are 
properly 
com-
pensated for the use of stockpile prod-
ucts and boosts its funding. 
Critically, it helps reduce our overall 
dependence on foreign suppliers by 
incentivizing production of critical 
medical supplies here in America. It 
creates a $500 million pilot program 
that will allow the stockpile to work 
directly with American manufacturers 
to replenish existing supplies, expand 
our 
manufacturing 
capacity, 
and 
strengthen these critical supply chains. 
Over the next few weeks, I will be 
visiting a bunch of Michigan compa-
nies who could directly benefit from 
this portion of the bill. 
Here in Congress, we have a responsi-
bility to respond to the way this crisis 
is shaking our communities; to protect 
our healthcare workers and support the 
businesses who are adapting to this 
once-in-a-generation event. Our com-
munities are stepping up and so should 
we. Passing this bill to better arm our 
doctors and nurses against this deadly 
disease is an important way to do that. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle for passing this legislation 
with overwhelming, bipartisan support, 
and I look forward to working together 
to help keep our fellow Americans safe.

Bader Ginsburg, Associate Justice of the 
United States Supreme Court. 
VALUABLE ROLE FOOD BANKS 
PLAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, earlier this month we 
celebrated National Food Bank Day. 
Each year on the first Friday in Sep-
tember, we have an opportunity to rec-
ognize the valuable role that food 
banks play in our communities and 
offer thanks to the tireless volunteers 
who help feed hunger-challenged fami-
lies nationwide. 
No matter the time of the year, food 
banks and food pantries support our 
neighbors in need with access to food, 
and throughout the pandemic, we have 
seen just how critical this access can 
be. 
In 2018, more than 37 million Ameri-
cans were considered food insecure, in-
cluding 11 million children. The De-
partment of Agriculture, defines food 
insecurity as ‘‘a lack of consistent ac-
cess to enough food for an active, 
healthy life.’’ 
Healthy families need access to qual-
ity, nutritious food. As a former chair-
man of the Committee on Agriculture 
Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, 
and Department Operations, this is an 
issue that I feel very passionately 
about. 
I am pleased to see the success of 
USDA’s Farmers to Families Food Box 
program and have heard a lot of posi-
tive feedback from volunteers and food 
bank staff in my district. 
Through the Coronavirus Food As-
sistance Program, or CFAP, the USDA 
has delivered more than 90 million 
boxes of fresh, delicious, nutritious 
food to families in need. Fresh fruits 
and vegetables, milk and dairy prod-
ucts, meat and more have been distrib-
uted by food banks, community cen-
ters, and churches nationwide. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention 
how helpful this has been for our farm-
ers and ranchers as well. Earlier in the 
pandemic, we heard too many stories of 
dairy farmers dumping their milk and 
crops going to waste. The Farmers to 
Families Food Box program allows 
farmers to sell their products and crops 
to be used in the boxes which has re-
duced waste. 
John, from the Christian Food Bank 
of Elk County in my district, called the 
boxes a ‘‘Godsend,’’ noting that recipi-
ents were deeply appreciative and 
amazed by the quality and variety of 
the food. 
Mel Curtis, director of the Centre 
County YMCA, said the boxes have 
been extremely helpful for families be-
cause the boxes provide goods that in-
dividuals and families with limited in-
come may have to forego at the gro-
cery store. 
I would like to give a special shout- 
out to Mel Curtis and all of the other 
hardworking people at the Centre 
County YMCA. I have been particularly 
impressed with their high energy, can-

do spirit, and constant commitment to 
serving families in the Centre region. 
Mel and his team are always inno-
vating and thinking of new ways to 
reach out to the community. 
I was pleased to join the Centre 
County YMCA this summer for a 
Travelin’ Table event to collect dona-
tions of food and to pack grab-and-go 
lunches for local students. Travelin’ 
Table is a mobile feeding bus. Typi-
cally, the bus makes six to eight stops 
a day delivering food, but operations 
have been kicked into high gear during 
the pandemic thanks to the YMCA 
team. 
Mr. Speaker, that Travelin’ Table, 
that mobile feeding bus, was made pos-
sible largely through a grant from 
USDA with rural economic develop-
ment, and just a tremendous impact 
that that has had at a critical time 
that all of our families across this Na-
tion are facing. 
This kind of attitude and commit-
ment to service is a beacon of hope dur-
ing these times, Mr. Speaker. 
I thank the Centre County YMCA, 
the Christian Food Bank of Elk Coun-
ty, and all of our other food bank staff 
and volunteers who are helping fami-
lies in their communities. 
A special shout-out also to Patti 
Long, for her volunteer efforts in my 
own home community of Howard.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick

During the deliberations of this day, 
send Your spirit of wisdom and good 
judgment upon the Members of the peo-
ple’s House, that the appropriation pro-
visions they must address would re-

May all that is done today be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

CELEBRATING THE EFFORTS OF 
THE GILA RIVER INDIAN COMMU-
NITY 
(Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to speak in support of my 
Blackwater Trading Post Land Trans-
fer Act, which passed the House of Rep-
resentatives by voice vote yesterday. 
I would like to thank Chairman GRI-
JALVA and Ranking Member BISHOP for 
moving this bill through regular order. 
My bill is a commonsense fix that will 
bring the Blackwater Trading Post, 
which the Gila River Indian Commu-
nity owns, into trust status. The 
Blackwater Trading Post is a cul-
turally 
and 
historically 
significant 
place. 
As Members of Congress, we are able 
to restore Tribal homelands. I am hon-
ored that we did so yesterday. During 
these difficult times, I am glad that we 
are able to advance legislation that 
serves our constituents. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle for helping me move this 
initiative across the finish line. The 
Gila River Indian Community has 
worked hard to acquire this land, and 
passing this bill today is a celebration 
of their effort.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
RECOVERY MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize September as National Recovery 
Month, an opportunity to raise aware-
ness about substance abuse and mental 
health, and to shed light on the re-
sources available to help those on the 
road to recovery. 
Before my time in Congress, I spent 
28 years as a therapist and rehabilita-
tion services manager. I have seen 
firsthand how substance abuse and 
mental health disorders can impact an 
individual and their loved ones. 
Substance abuse and mental health 
disorders do not discriminate. They do 
not see race, gender, or socioeconomic 
status. This is a particularly difficult 
time to be struggling with a substance 
abuse problem or mental health dis-
order. COVID–19 has put an enormous 
strain on the American people over the 
last several months, and mental health 
has been undoubtedly impacted. 
We can all play a part in helping 
those who are struggling. I would like 
to encourage anyone in need to take 
advantage of the resources available 
through the Substance Abuse and Men-
tal Health Services Administration by 
visiting their website or calling 1–800– 
662–HELP. Sometimes just a phone call 
can be a big step on the road to recov-
ery. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE SEVERITY OF 
COVID–19 
(Mr. CARSON of Indiana asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
200,000 Americans, including the 3,500 
Hoosiers who have lost their lives to 
COVID–19. We won’t forget those we 
lost, our family, friends, neighbors, co-
workers, teachers, spiritual leaders, 
and much more. 
I also want to remember my cousins, 
who passed away from the virus earlier 
this year. Who knows how many lives 
could have been saved if our leaders 
had been honest about the severity of 
COVID–19 from the start? Who knows 
how many millions could have avoided 
this illness and possible lifetime com-
plications from it, if those leaders had 
not made them make the impossible 
choice between their health and their 
livelihoods? 
I introduced H.R. 7161, the COVID–19 
Memorial Quilt Act of 2020, to create a 
national memorial, Madam Speaker, to 
everyone we have lost. We can’t change 
the past, but we can impact the future. 
The Senate must pass the HEROES 
Act, which we passed in May, to pro-
vide strong relief from COVID–19. We 
can save countless lives if we put par-
tisanship aside and work together.

Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I

ness Week, which recognizes the con-
tributions small business owners and 
entrepreneurs make to our great soci-
ety.

nately, our small businesses have been 
through the wringer this year. With 
coronavirus and overreaching govern-
ment regulations, especially in States 
like California, now more than ever 
they are relying on us to help them 
through this difficult time. 
If we want to get America’s economy 
back on track to be the greatest in the 
world, it starts with support for our 
small businesses. They are the key to 
propelling America’s prosperity for-
ward.

RECOGNIZING AFFORDABLE 
INTERIOR SYSTEMS 
(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Affordable Inte-
rior Systems, or AIS, of Leominster, 
Massachusetts, a company that nor-
mally manufactures office furniture, 
but which has organized volunteers 
from across the United States to create 
an amazing new initiative called Sew 
the Masks. 
Like so many other patriotic Ameri-
cans, when the AIS team began to see 
the terrible toll the coronavirus pan-
demic was inflicting on our country, 
they jumped into action. Affection-
ately drawing on the inspiration of 
World War II icon Rosie the Riveter, 
AIS leveraged their expertise and ret-
rofitted a chair production line to 
produce high-quality, reusable masks. 
Then they mobilized their own em-
ployees, as well as volunteers from 
across 
the 
country, 
affectionately 
known as Rosies, to sew high-quality 
reusable masks for first responders and 
other essential employees. 
Madam Speaker, I find their dedica-
tion to helping their neighbors in the 
fight against COVID–19 nothing short 
of awe-inspiring, and I hope you will 
join me in recognizing the amazing 
work of AIS and their volunteers from 
across the country. 
f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S SUPREME 
COURT PICK 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, Democrats love to throw 
around the term ‘‘constitutional cri-
sis’’ to distract the American people 
from the facts. 
Was it a constitutional crisis when 22 
past Presidents made Supreme Court 
nominations in election years? We 
didn’t hear Democrats harping then, 
but we sure do now. 
Democrats believe that the vacancy 
on the Supreme Court is theirs for the 
taking, and they claim it would be ille-
gal for President Trump to appoint a 
Justice this year. It is absurd to say 
that a duly-elected President fulfilling 
his constitutional duty is illegal. 
Democrats aren’t respecting the Con-
stitution; they are using their dis-
torted interpretation of it to justify at-
tacking President Trump for simply 
doing his job. The seat must be filled 
without delay. 
f 
CONSIDERING 
JUSTICE 
GINS-
BURG’S REPLACEMENT BEFORE 
THE ELECTION 
(Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, on Friday night, a great American, 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, passed 
from labor to reward. Moments after 
her passing, the Senate Republican 
Leader announced that Republicans 
will confirm any name that President 
Trump will send over, whether it is be-
fore or after the election. 
It was in February of 2016, 9 months 
before the election, that Justice Scalia 
unexpectedly passed away, and Senate 
Republicans 
announced 
they 
would 
wait until the election of the new 
President to consider the replacement. 
Because of this obstruction, President 
Obama was denied an opportunity to 
replace Justice Scalia. Republicans 
then took control and packed the 
Court with the confirmation of Justice 
Gorsuch. 
And now this is 2016 in reverse. The 
Senate Republican Leader and LINDSEY 
GRAHAM are determined to confirm a 
replacement before the election. This 
is the height of hypocrisy. It places the 
integrity of our judiciary in a place 
where it should not be. We will not tol-
erate a second court packing. Do it at 
your peril. 
f 
A GREAT VICTORY FOR OUR 
FIRST RESPONDERS 
(Mr. ZELDIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, as 
early as today, the House will be vot-
ing to pass the Don’t Break Up the T- 
Band Act, of which I am proud to be an 
original cosponsor. 
This would mark a great victory for 
our first responders who use the T- 
Band spectrum and bravely and self-
lessly put their lives on the line each 
and every day to protect our commu-
nities. 
From hurricanes to fires, the T-Band 
spectrum provides critical communica-
tion between first responders. Even 
when cell phones, internet, and elec-
tricity cease to function, T-Band is the 
last line of defense. 
However, the T-Band spectrum is 
mandated to be sold. According to the 
GAO, this misguided sale and the relo-
cation of users would actually cost tax-
payers $5 billion to $6 billion. 
Thankfully, this bipartisan legisla-
tion would preserve the spectrum, and 
help ensure our first responders have 
the resources to do their jobs safely 
and effectively. 
I urge the Senate to follow suit and 
move forward on this vital bill. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TEGAN ROOBOL 
(Ms. SLOTKIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. 
SLOTKIN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today I rise to honor Tegan Roobol of 
Howell, Michigan. 
Ms. Roobol has dedicated her career 
to helping others overcome obstacles. 
As a physical therapist who works with 
children with disabilities and those 
who have suffered traumatic injuries 
through the Livingston Educational 
Service Agency, Ms. Roobol has helped 
hundreds of children learn to walk, 
master basic motor skills, and gain 
independence. 
Recently, the inspiring mother of 
two had the chance to try out some ob-
stacles of her own when she competed 
on the popular TV series ‘‘American 
Ninja Warrior.’’ 
Frustrated with the lack of recre-
ation opportunities for those with dis-
abilities, 
she 
developed 
a 
unique, 
adaptive ninja warrior program for 
children with special needs, and found-
ed a non-profit organization to reach 
even more kids. 
Roobol has worked to overcome the 
obstacles of the stigma around mental 
illness, and bravely shared her own 
battle with depression in a book she 
authored. 
Regardless of what happens on the 
obstacle course, Ms. Roobol is a real- 
life warrior, fighting to make a dif-
ference for some of the most vulnerable 
members of our community.

rise today to honor George Beam of 
Fort Ashby, West Virginia, who will be 
celebrating his 100th birthday next 
month. 
George Beam’s life is one of exem-
plary service to his community and his 
country. During the height of World 
War II, he enlisted and served in the 
United States Army, leaving behind his 
wife and newborn baby. Mr. Beam 
sensed the call of duty and he knew 
serving his country was the right thing 
to do. 
For his service, he received numerous 
recognitions, including a Purple Heart 
for his injury at the infamous Battle of 
the Bulge. 
After the war, Beam returned home 
to West Virginia where he operated 
several businesses in Fort Ashby. 
George Beam, we wish you a happy 
100th birthday. You truly are a great 
American.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4653 
September 22, 2020 
REPUBLICANS 
ARE 
SUPPORTING 
THE 
INVESTOR 
CLASS 
WHILE 
DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING FOR 
THE WORKING CLASS 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
while Senator MCCONNELL works fer-
vently to confirm a Supreme Court 
Justice, he continues to block the re-
lief that Americans need, holding a 
failed vote on a bill that refuses to 
crush the virus, abandons our heroes in 
State and local government, ignores 
families facing hunger and homeless-
ness, and contains poison pills that 
Democrats cannot support. 
As families suffer, Republicans con-
tinue to refuse to acknowledge the 
funding levels that experts, scientists, 
and the American people know is need-
ed. They reject robust support for 
State, local, Tribal and territorial gov-
ernments. They want to bully many 
schools into reopening before it is safe 
to do so, endangering children, edu-
cators, and creating new vectors for 
the virus to spread. 
Republicans are ignoring the crisis of 
food insecurity, providing zero funds 
for nutrition assistance, and insuffi-
cient funds to our farmers. 
Originally, our side, the Democrats, 
were willing to compromise and cut a 
trillion from the HEROES Act if the 
White House would add a trillion to the 
failed and anemic Senate bill. We 
wanted to negotiate and meet in the 
middle at $2.2 trillion. Yet, Senate Re-
publicans and the White House con-
tinue to reject a compromise, and in-
stead, the Senate GOP continues to 
move further away from what is need-
ed. 
While Republicans fail to take the 
catastrophe facing families seriously, 
our health and economy are crumbling. 
Republicans are supporting the inves-
tor class while Democrats are fighting 
for the working class.

LEADERS MUST CONDEMN 
VIOLENCE 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, those 
who are placed in positions of leader-
ship, particularly those elected by the 
people, have a responsibility to put 
their short-term interests aside for the 
greater collective good. 
We have a problem in America with 
violence in our streets, destruction of 
property, and hateful rhetoric toward 
police and innocent bystanders every 
day. As a result, people are fleeing our 
cities in droves, yet many so-called 
leaders have tacitly condoned the de-
struction with phrases like: ‘‘People 
will do what they do,’’ and, ‘‘There 
needs to be unrest in the streets for as 
long as there is unrest in our lives.’’ 
‘‘No justice, no peace.’’ We have all 
heard it. 
If such indirect encouragement is not 
bad enough, continued silence from 
certain leaders may be even worse. 
The idea that, after an assassination 
attempt of two sheriffs in California, 
the former attorney general, the top 
cop, and current Senator of the State 
remaining silent on this issue is out-
rageous. 
Just this week, as a response to the 
President’s 
constitutional 
duty 
to 
nominate a Supreme Court Justice, the 
far left immediately stated: ‘‘Let this 
moment radicalize you.’’ They later 
stated: ‘‘Nothing is off the table.’’ Just 
now, it was stated: ‘‘Do so at your 
peril.’’ That is a threat. This incites 
lawlessness and has nothing to do with 
national unity. 
We can disagree on policy, but now, 
more than ever, we need new leaders 
who aspire to follow in the heroic foot-
steps of Martin Luther King and call 
out those who fail to do so. 
f 
CONGRESS NEEDS MORE 
COOPERATION 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
the shock of the loss of Justice Gins-
burg and the stunning hypocrisy of Re-
publicans who denied Judge Garland 
even a hearing because a year was not 
enough time rush to jam through an-
other Trump appointment. 
The devastating national disasters of 
the Oregon and California fires and 
Trump’s failure to respond to the 
COVID health and economic disasters 
are a stunning backdrop to the work 
we have before us. 
We have a chance to take steps in 
this Congress that in normal times 
would be historic reforms working with 
you, Madam Speaker on legislation to 
reform our hopelessly outdated mari-
juana legislation. 
We have a chance to pass legislation 
that would rescue 500,000 independent 
restaurants, who are at risk of going 
out of business if we don’t take steps 
now. And these are bipartisan initia-
tives. 
Congress ought to do what it can 
moving forward where it can cooperate. 
Who knows, it might become habit 
forming. 
f 
HONORING 200,000 LIVES LOST 
WITH ACTION 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in solemn recognition of the 
grave milestone our Nation soon will 
be reaching: 200,000 lives lost to the 
COVID–19 
pandemic—among 
them, 
8,457 Illinoisans. 
They were our nurses and doctors, 
our heroes on the front lines of the 
fight against this virus. 
They were our grandparents who 
were forced to spend their final mo-
ments alone. 
They were our essential workers, our 
vulnerable 
neighbors, 
our 
closest 
friends. 
Their families have been devastated 
with grief, made worse by the painful 
reality that we cannot gather safely to 
mourn our losses together. 
To every American who has lost 
someone to the coronavirus, I extend 
my deepest condolences, and I grieve 
with you. 
I commit to you that I will continue 
to honor the lives lost with action 
through making investments in health 
and our economy to ensure that Amer-
ica recovers from COVID–19 stronger 
than ever. 
f 
HONORING THOSE WHO DON 
CROWNS OF ALL TYPES 
(Ms. PRESSLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the CROWN 
Act, which will move us one step closer 
to ending the centuries of discrimina-
tion against Black hair, discrimination 
that has rejected the dignity and beau-
ty of my people. 
From personnel handbooks to school 
dress code policies, Afros, locs, and 
twists have been codified as proxies for 
our Black skin and manifestations of 
anti-Black racism. 
Many, especially Black women, grow 
up hearing that our natural coils and 
kinks are distracting, ghetto, ugly, and 
unprofessional. From as early as grade 
school, Black girls are pushed out of 
school for wearing their hair naturally. 
As we grow up, we are taught to 
straighten our hair if we want to get a 
job or simply live our lives in peace. 
When I first joined Congress, I proud-
ly chose to wear my hair in Senegalese 
twists because I sought to inten-
tionally create space for all of us to 
show up in the world as our authentic 
selves. 
Today, I navigate the world a little 
differently. My beautiful twists were 
taken from me due to the autoimmune 
disease known as alopecia universalis. 
But today, I stand in honor of those 
who don crowns of all types. May they 
continue to shine. 
f 
IN HONOR OF JUSTICE RUTH 
BADER GINSBURG 
(Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, Sat-
urday Libby and I joined many at the 
Supreme Court to honor Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, a true defender of our 
most fundamental rights at a time 
when this President and his enablers 
increasingly threaten the very preser-
vation of our democracy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4654 
September 22, 2020 
Having fought her entire professional 
life against double standards, it is es-
sential that a double standard not 
apply to her replacement. 
When Justice Scalia died 8 months 
before a Presidential election, Repub-
licans blocked any consideration of 
President Obama’s nomination to the 
Court. Only total hypocrisy would per-
mit Republicans to name a replace-
ment after voting for President has al-
ready begun in a number of States. 
Why Trump’s big rush? Because he 
wants this court packed with judges 
that will take away healthcare and 
protection for preexisting conditions 
for millions of Americans. And just in 
case, when he loses the popular vote 
once again, he needs some judges to 
help him cling to power. The best trib-
ute to Justice Ginsburg is demanding 
consistency and then replacing a Presi-
dent who shares absolutely none of her 
values. 
With everything at stake, we need to 
give it everything we have got. Let’s 
protect the equality and justice she 
worked a lifetime to defend. 
f 
AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE 
BETTER 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. America will soon 
pass 200,000 deaths from COVID–19. This 
pandemic is now the second leading 
cause of death in our country, only be-
hind heart disease. 
This year, it will kill more Ameri-
cans than lung cancer, stroke, Alz-
heimer’s, diabetes, and the flu, and it 
didn’t have to be this way. 
President Trump knew the dangers in 
January. His Deputy National Security 
Advisor told him to cut off travel from 
China, but he didn’t do that. 
The next month, the President told a 
reporter that COVID–19 was more dead-
ly than even your most strenuous flus, 
but he didn’t tell the American people. 
He did what he always does when he 
faces a crisis. He failed the American 
people. 
Just yesterday, he told a crowd of his 
own supporters in Ohio that the disease 
‘‘affects virtually nobody.’’ Yet, 200,000 
have died of this disease. 
He is not up to his job. He never was. 
It is too big for him. 
The American people deserve a Presi-
dent who will take this deadly virus se-
riously and has a plan to defeat it. 
f 
REPUBLICANS PUT THEMSELVES 
FIRST 
(Ms. FUDGE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FUDGE. Madam Speaker, on Fri-
day, we lost an honorable and decent 
woman, Justice Ginsburg, a person who 
changed the world. 
But for all her successes, those who 
are bent on choosing her successor 
have no decency. They have no honor. 
They have no integrity. It is a shame 
that they did not learn the lessons of 
Justice Ginsburg, which were decency 
and honesty and integrity, one who 
fought for others. 
All they want to do is fight for them-
selves. They want to take away our 
healthcare. They don’t want to help 
people who are in trouble. They don’t 
care about people who are unemployed. 
All they want to do is win. 
But what do they win? What have 
they won for this Nation? They just 
want to benefit themselves. 
We are not here for ourselves. We are 
here for the people who sent us here. 
We are here to represent the people. 
When you lose sight of that, what a 
shame, what an absolute shame. They 
are a disgrace to this Nation. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST WORK TO SAVE 
LIVES, PROTECT LIVELIHOODS 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
this pandemic has taken over 200,000 
lives, bankrupted State and local gov-
ernments, and destroyed our economy, 
not to mention nearly 20 million people 
have lost their jobs as a result of this 
devastating public health and eco-
nomic crisis. Communities of color 
have been hit the hardest. 
My condolences go out to those who 
have lost loved ones. 
Over 4 months ago, House Democrats 
passed the HEROES Act, which reflects 
the needs of the American people and 
allocates the resources to save lives 
and to boost the economy. It has been 
over 130 days since we passed the HE-
ROES Act. 
Since that time, the other body and 
the White House have done nothing to 
help the American people. Instead, this 
administration and Senate Republicans 
muzzled scientists and refused to com-
promise. 
Let me be clear: The White House in-
tentionally downplayed the severity of 
the virus, and now the COVID pan-
demic has taken lives that could have 
been saved. 
Time is of the essence. I urge my col-
leagues across the aisle to work with 
Democrats to save lives and protect 
livelihoods now more than ever.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4655 
September 22, 2020 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me begin by 
commending Representatives SEWELL 
and WENSTRUP for taking a leadership 
role on this program. Last year, they 
introduced this bill to reauthorize the 
Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership 
Act, which expires at the end of the 
month. They helped organize a terrific 
hearing before the Ways and Means 
Trade Subcommittee to be able to 
focus on this. 
It is imperative that the Senate act 
quickly on this bill and that we get it 
done before September 30. 
In today’s political climate, it is im-
portant to highlight those few areas of 
bipartisan consensus. The CBTPA has 
historically enjoyed that bipartisan 
and bicameral support, in part because 
of the shared history and close ties to 
the United States with the Caribbean 
Basin region. 
There are about 13 million Americans 
who have Caribbean ancestors. They 
represent 4 percent of the American 
population. 
The Caribbean, in particular Haiti, 
played a critical role in the American 
Revolutionary War, where hundreds of 
Haitians fought for America’s inde-
pendence. 
Years later, Haiti would defend the 
French and become the first Black re-
public, influencing the rise of aboli-
tionist and anti-colonial movements 
all over the world, especially here in 
the United States. Haiti’s sacrifices 
and unyielding resolve continue to in-
spire millions. 
Sadly, the United States, under the 
influence of slave-holding interests, ac-
tively worked against this fledgling 
new republic. They were threatened by 
the specter of a slave uprising and 
Black independent government. 
The United States was hostile to 
Haiti for years, and worked to under-
mine its success. Rather than be a con-
structive partner to help this fledgling 
republic, the United States interfered, 
and more importantly, failed to em-
brace the emergence of the first Black 
republic. 
Now, there are some admitted prob-
lems of governance, poverty, and cor-
ruption in Haiti and in the region. I 
personally strongly believe that some 
of those difficulties that Haiti experi-
ences to this day are the result of fail-
ures of American policy. 
That is why this Caribbean Basin Ini-
tiative is so important. It is an oppor-
tunity to continue to strengthen Hai-
ti’s economy and our working relation-
ship. 
In 2001, after that devastating earth-
quake in Haiti, I joined a bipartisan, 
bicameral delegation to Port-au-Prince 
to demonstrate the ongoing support in 
Congress to the Haitian people, to un-
derstand the challenges they face, and 
demonstrate our commitment to work 
with the Haitian Government to assist 
with reconstruction efforts. 
Haiti, by design, is the primary bene-
ficiary of the textile and apparel pref-
erences under CBTPA, more important 
now than ever. 
Recently, we heard firsthand at our 
hearing from witnesses and some of our 
colleagues, including Congresswoman 
SEWELL, about the development chal-
lenges that persist in the region. 
Like any good trading relationship, 
we will continue to work to improve 
labor conditions, political stability, 
and expand economic development to 
all countries in the region. 
Passing this reauthorization is an 
important step toward those goals. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important leg-
islation and I urge the Senate to act 
quickly to extend the bipartisan pro-
gram without delay. It is an oppor-
tunity for us to demonstrate to the 
country and to ourselves that despite 
many of the challenges, there are 
things we can do working together to 
improve the conditions. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 991, which extends the Car-
ibbean Basin Trade Partnership Act 
through 2030. This legislation enjoys 
wide bipartisan support, and I want to 
thank Congresswoman TERRI SEWELL 
for partnering with me to get this 
done. 
Madam Speaker, I also thank Rank-
ing Member BRADY and Chairman NEAL 
for their cooperation and support of 
this legislation as well. 
As a Member of the House Ways and 
Means Committee, I am proud to sup-
port our Nation’s trade preference pro-
grams, which bolster further economic 
expansion in truly developing nations 
and support jobs here in America. It is 
a true win-win scenario. 
In particular, the Caribbean Basin 
Trade Partnership Act, or CBTPA, ac-
complishes that goal in the Caribbean, 
providing trade benefits to eight Carib-
bean nations, most notably, Haiti. 
Furthermore, the program also bene-
fits American businesses and workers, 
a number of whom have created strong, 
reliable partnerships with suppliers in 
the Caribbean. This partnership helps 
to add value for customers and sup-
ports American jobs. 
Also of note, the program requires 
the use of U.S. yarn, which boosts jobs 
in our cotton and textile industry. 
In my district, Cintas Corporation, 
which is headquartered in Cincinnati, 
utilizes a strong partnership with Hai-
tian suppliers as part of their North 
American supply chain. 
Finally, as we step back and look at 
the bigger picture: The CBTPA helps 
American stewardship of the Western 
Hemisphere, where we want to support 
budding democracies on our doorstep 
and create mutually beneficial eco-
nomic stability with our neighbors. 
Our overall trade agenda is well served 
by agreements like the recently passed 
USMCA, as well as these important 
trade preference programs like the 
CBTPA. 
Again, I want to thank Congress-
woman SEWELL for her partnership on 
this issue, as well as Ranking Member 
BRADY and Chairman NEAL for their 
support. 
Madam Speaker, this is good, sound 
policy which stands to benefit both 
Americans and our friendly neighbors 
in the Caribbean. I urge my colleagues 
to support its passage, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield such time as she may consume 
to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. 
SEWELL), who has played an instru-
mental role in this legislation. 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
BLU-
MENAUER for yielding me the time. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 991, my 
legislation to reauthorize the Carib-
bean Basin Trade Promotion Act. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my Repub-
lican colleague, BRAD WENSTRUP, for 
his leadership on this bill. I also want 
to thank Chairman NEAL and Ranking 
Member BRADY for all of their help. 
Madam Speaker, I especially want to 
acknowledge my chairman of the Sub-
committee on Trade, Mr. BLUMENAUER, 
for hosting a very meaningful hearing 
on the Caribbean Basin Trade Pro-
motion Agreement and its importance 
of being reauthorized by September 30 
of this year. 
For two decades, the Caribbean Basin 
Trade Promotion Agreement has been 
a critical tool to expand our diplomatic 
and economic relationship with coun-
tries throughout the Caribbean Basin 
region. This agreement has allowed for 
duty- and quota-free treatment of prod-
ucts made with U.S. goods. 
The liberalization of our trade rela-
tionship 
with 
these 
countries 
has 
strengthened Western Hemisphere sup-
ply chains, while providing economic 
development and job creation in the re-
gion. 
In 2018, United States exports to CBI 
countries totalled $13.4 billion, while 
imports totaled $6 billion, creating a 
$7.4 billion goods trade surplus for the 
United States. 
One of those Caribbean Basin coun-
tries, Haiti, has had tremendous eco-
nomic benefits by the Caribbean Basin 
Trade Promotion Act. The economic 
benefits of the CBTPA are essential, 
with over 90 percent of their nearly $1 
billion in exports entering the United 
States with the CBTPA or HOPE duty- 
free treatment. Moreover, the Associa-
tion of Haitian Industries has esti-
mated that the CBTPA, along with the 
HOPE and HELP programs, has created 
over 50,000 jobs in Haiti, alone. 
The reauthorization of this program 
ahead of the September 30 deadline will 
allow us to continue to strengthen the 
foundation for long-term economic sta-
bility, while contributing to our diplo-
matic and security interests. 
Continued economic development in 
the region is a goal that we should all 
share, and the passage of this legisla-
tion will reaffirm the commitment of 
the United States to this objective.

September 22, 2020 
The importance of our diplomatic 
and economic ties with the Caribbean 
Basin countries is highlighted by the 
strong support for this legislation that 
we receive from the Congressional 
Black Caucus. 
In a letter of support for H.R. 991 to 
congressional 
leadership, 
the 
CBC 
aptly pointed out: Millions of Ameri-
cans have Caribbean ancestry and 
make up important segments of the 
United States population. Haiti is the 
first Black republic, influencing the 
rise of abolitionist and anticolonial 
movements all across the world, espe-
cially in the United States. 
The history and the future for mil-
lions of Americans is directly tied to 
the economic prosperity of Caribbean 
Basin countries, and our relationship 
must reflect this reality. 
Within this context, we also must 
continue to push our trading partners 
for compliance with key eligibility cri-
teria under the agreement, including 
upholding the rights of workers and 
combating corruption. A lapse in this 
agreement would jeopardize the eco-
nomic and social well-being of workers 
in the region. 
Today’s step forward to reauthorize 
this very important trade promotion 
program will allow for continued co-
operation and enforcement on these 
critical issues. I look forward to re-
maining engaged with all of the stake-
holders to support these goals, includ-
ing expanding human rights and eco-
nomic prosperity for all. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
Ambassador 
of 
Haiti, 
Ambassador 
Denis, who testified before the sub-
committee, for his eloquence on the 
importance of the Caribbean Basin 
Trade Promotion Agreement for Haiti, 
in particular. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to thank 
all of the representatives from the 
eight Caribbean Basin countries that 
have come to my office and talked to 
us ad nauseam about how important it 
is that we extend the Caribbean Basin 
reauthorization. 
As well, Madam Speaker, I would like 
to also thank Charlie Rangel, who was 
the member of the House Ways and 
Means Committee who really cham-
pioned this initially, two decades ago. 
When I took Charlie’s position on the 
Ways and Means Committee, he sat me 
down and told me how important it 
was that we not only reauthorize, but 
we strengthen the Caribbean Basin 
Trade Promotion Agreement. 
So this is an important step in reau-
thorizing this very important trade 
agreement before its September 30 
deadline. 
Madam Speaker, I again want to say 
how proud I am that this agreement 
has huge bipartisan support. The reau-
thorization of this program would not 
be possible if it had not been for the bi-
partisan support that my colleague 
from Ohio, Congressman WENSTRUP, 
has so ably provided, a partnership in 
this agreement. 
While debate over U.S. trade policy is 
often rigorous, the reauthorization of 
the Caribbean Basin Trade Promotion 
Agreement should be something that 
we can all support. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud that this 
important issue is before us for a vote, 
and I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
in favor of this very important legisla-
tion. 
Again, Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank Chairman BLUMENAUER for al-
lowing me to speak on this very impor-
tant measure. 
b 1145 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT), a distin-
guished member of the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Ms. SEWELL and Dr. WENSTRUP 
for taking this on. 
My reason for being here behind the 
microphone 
is 
more 
than 
Arizona 
grows an amazingly high-quality cot-
ton and this is one of our markets. I 
think, actually, it is part of a vision a 
number of us have, and I thank Chair-
man BLUMENAUER for hopefully sharing 
this vision, and that is thinking of the 
world post the change of NAFTA, 
USMCA. 
How do we start to become more 
hemispheric-centric? 
Our 
neighbors, 
particularly our neighbors who do 
truly still have overwhelming poverty, 
how do we engage in pieces of legisla-
tion that make it so we can trade with 
our neighbors, trade with those who 
are right around us? That is what is so 
powerful about what is being done 
here. 
Being someone who has spent, not a 
lot of time but a little time in Haiti, 
you see things that are optimistic, 
hopeful, and heartbreaking at the same 
time. But these are parts of the build-
ing blocks of how we build an economic 
circle of virtue in our region. 
So I am hopeful that we move this 
forward and the Senate takes it up 
quickly, but I am also hopeful that we 
start to see this in a more holistic vi-
sion of we now have a change in our 
trade agreement with Mexico, Canada. 
Now, if we can update our trade 
agreements with the Caribbean Basin, 
what else can we do to make our region 
economically prosperous, economically 
fair, economically something that the 
rest of the world will look forward to 
and say: This is what trade, when it is 
done properly, can bring to people who 
have actually had really rough times, 
when you think of earthquakes and of 
hurricanes in the region. 
These are some of the good things, as 
a country, we can do to our brothers 
and sisters who are our neighbors. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I am prepared to close so I will defer to 
my colleague from Ohio. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to make 
one final comment. It has been a pleas-
ure with this particular issue to work 
in a bipartisan fashion, not only with 
my friend Congresswoman SEWELL, but 
really with the entire committee. I 
think that we really came together and 
saw the benefits to America and to de-
veloping nations as we move forward. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter in support of this legis-
lation from the textile, apparel, and 
footwear industry as well as the broad-
er business community. 
SEPTEMBER 22, 2020. 
DEAR MEMBERS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES: On behalf of the undersigned 
organizations—representing the full spec-
trum of the textile, apparel, and footwear in-
dustry, as well as the broader business com-
munity—we urge you to vote YES on H.R. 
991—Extension of the Caribbean Basin Eco-
nomic Recovery Act. 
By extending the Caribbean Basin Eco-
nomic Recovery Act to September 30, 2030, 
the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act 
(CBTPA) will also be extended. Since its in-
ception in 2000, CBTPA has become an im-
portant element of the effort to develop and 
facilitate trade within the Caribbean Basin 
region, most notably with Haiti. Overall, 
CBTPA is structured in a fashion that rea-
sonably balances the interests of U.S. textile 
manufacturers with those of textile and ap-
parel manufacturers in the region. The 
CBTPA requires the use of U.S. or CBTPA- 
regional yarns and fabrics, which means 
Haiti, as the main country still participating 
in the CBTPA, has become an important ex-
port market for U.S. textiles. 
Along with the Haitian Hemispheric Op-
portunity through Partnership Encourage-
ment (HOPE) Act, and the Haiti Economic 
Lift Program (HELP) Act, the CBTPA now 
increases U.S. exports to strategic allies in 
the Caribbean Basin. Not only have these 
programs supported numerous U.S. textile, 
apparel, and footwear jobs, but they have 
also supported economic development in the 
region, advancing key U.S. foreign, security, 
and immigration policy goals. 
Specifically, the CBTPA continues to play 
a direct and critical role in advancing the in-
dustry partnership that currently exists be-
tween the United States and Haiti. In 2019, 
100 percent (by volume) of apparel that was 
imported into the United States under the 
CBTPA was imported from Haiti. And U.S. 
apparel imports from Haiti continue to grow. 
In fact, total U.S. garment imports from 
Haiti grew 13.4% in 2019. Because the rules of 
origin for these programs generally require 
the use of U.S. fabrics and yarns, these U.S. 
garment imports incorporate prior U.S. tex-
tile exports. 
Those benefits are now threatened because 
of questions surrounding the renewal of the 
CBTPA. These concerns come on top of the 
considerable pain, costs, and uncertainty the 
industry is already trying to manage as a re-
sult of COVID–19 and the accompanying eco-
nomic crisis. Orders have already been 
placed for goods that will arrive well after 
September 30. Companies must increasingly 
assume that these orders will be fully duti-
able—even if using U.S. inputs—putting our 
Haitian customers and partners, and our U.S. 
textile manufacturers and exporters at a dis-
advantage. 
The CBTPA offers a great opportunity for 
companies looking to diversify their supply 
chains close to home, but it is set to expire 
on September 30, 2020. We urge you to vote 
YES on H.R. 991—Extension of the Caribbean 
Basin Economic Recovery Act and extend it 
another ten years. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Accessories Council; American Apparel & 
Footwear Association (AAFA); Council of

Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the good 
doctor, and Ms. SEWELL for helping us 
facilitate the movement of this legisla-
tion and make it possible for us to ac-
tually maybe even get it enacted in 
this Congress before the deadline ex-
pires at the end of the month. 
As I referenced, this, I think, is very, 
very important. The region is home to 
these eight countries that have pro-
vided some 13 million Americans with a 
country of origin. It is in our neighbor-
hood and it is an area where the United 
States has been involved from the be-
ginning. 
As I mentioned in my opening com-
ments, we have not always distin-
guished ourselves with honor but this 
is an opportunity for us to do the right 
thing: to build on this existing legisla-
tion; to not have it expire; to dem-
onstrate broad, bipartisan commitment 
and then get back to the hard work of 
implementing it. 
It provides a framework but it is not 
self-executing. It is something that we 
need to do with policy, with our ac-
tions and words, being able to build on 
this as a foundation for progress in this 
critical region. 
I thank Madam Speaker for the op-
portunity to advance it, and I strongly 
urge all of my colleagues to approve 
this legislation and be able to keep it 
in force before it expires at the end of 
the month. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank Dr. BRAD WENSTRUP for yielding time to 
me, and I want to congratulate him and Ms. 
SEWELL for their strong, bipartisan leadership 
on this important bill. 
I rise today in support of this legislation. The 
Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership creates 
jobs, promotes American values abroad, and 
incentivizes beneficiary countries to comply 
with the economic rule of law, bolstering their 
development. 
The CBTPA helps these nations grow and 
create opportunities for their workers, farmers, 
and innovators. And in return, it creates a 
strong market for us to sell our U.S.-produced 
yarn and fabrics to apparel manufacturers in 
the Caribbean. The program strengthens our 
hemispheric manufacturing integration and al-
lows us to compete against China, whose 
manufacturers certainly don’t care about using 
U.S. inputs. As a result, we can sell our goods 
to more customers, keep prices here lower, 
and promote the spirit of free enterprise. 
The Caribbean countries are our neighbors, 
and we should work together to improve our 
region’s competitiveness. 
But we should be here today voting on two 
trade extensions: the Caribbean Basin Trade 
Partnership and the Generalized System of 
Preferences. 
Both of these programs have bipartisan sup-
port. Both of them are set to expire this year. 
And if we extend both of them today, our man-
ufacturers, producers, and consumers would 
have more certainty right now. 
In the midst of a pandemic, we should be 
doing everything we can to offer our job cre-
ators certainty, yet Democrats are not includ-
ing an extension of GSP in today’s vote. 
The GSP program reduces tariffs on thou-
sands of products from around the world. This 
program saves American families money on 
everyday products and boosts America’s 
economy. And in my state of Texas, GSP 
brought our consumers and small businesses 
over $76 million in cost savings in 2018 alone. 
The remainder of the Congressional sched-
ule until GSP expires at the end of the year 
is completely unpredictable. We should not 
leave GSP on the cutting room floor. GSP de-
serves to be a bipartisan priority, and I con-
tinue to urge House Democrats to act. 
I strongly support today’s bill, and I urge bi-
partisan passage. But we must continue to 
work together to get GSP’s extension across 
the finish line without further delay. Our Amer-
ican businesses cannot afford to wait. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 991, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

UYGHUR FORCED LABOR 
PREVENTION ACT 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 6210) ensuring 
that goods made with forced labor in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion of the People’s Republic of China 
do not enter the United States market, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6210 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region of China, the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China has, since 2017, arbi-
trarily detained as many as 1.8 million 
Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of 
other Muslim minority groups in a system of 
extrajudicial mass internment camps, and 
has subjected detainees to forced labor, tor-
ture, political indoctrination, and other se-
vere human rights abuses. 
(2) Forced labor exists within the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region’s system of 
mass internment camps, and throughout the 
region, and is confirmed by the testimony of 
former camp detainees, satellite imagery, 
and official leaked documents from the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China as 
part of a targeted campaign of repression of 
Muslim ethnic minorities. 
(3) In addition to reports from researchers 
and civil society groups documenting evi-
dence that many factories and other sup-
pliers in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region are exploiting forced labor, the De-
partment of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry 
and Security on July 22, 2020, added eleven 
entities to the entity list after determining 
the entities had been ‘‘implicated in human 
rights violations and abuses in the imple-
mentation of China’s campaign of repression, 
mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and 
high-technology 
surveillance 
against 
Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other members of 
Muslim minority groups in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region’’. 
(4) Audits and efforts to vet products and 
supply chains in the Xinjiang Uyghur Auton-
omous Region are unreliable due to the ex-
tent forced labor has been integrated into 
the regional economy, the mixing of involun-
tary labor with voluntary labor, the inabil-
ity of witnesses to speak freely about work-
ing conditions given government surveil-
lance and coercion, and the incentive of gov-
ernment officials to conceal government- 
sponsored forced labor. 
(5) The Department of State’s June 2019 
Trafficking in Persons Report found that 
‘‘Authorities offer subsidies incentivizing 
Chinese companies to open factories in close 
proximity to the internment camps, and 
local governments receive additional funds 
for each inmate forced to work in these sites 
at a fraction of minimum wage or without 
any compensation.’’. 
(6) U.S. Customs and Border Protection has 
issued eight ‘‘Withhold Release Orders’’ on 
certain garments, hair products, cotton, 
processed cotton, and computer parts sus-
pected to be produced with prison or forced 
labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region. 
(7) In its 2019 Annual Report, the Congres-
sional-Executive 
Commission 
on 
China 
(CECC) found that products reportedly pro-
duced with forced labor by current and 
former mass internment camp detainees in-
cluded textiles, electronics, food products, 
shoes, tea, and handicrafts. 
(8) Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 
U.S.C. 1307) states that it is illegal to import 
into the United States ‘‘goods, wares, arti-
cles, and merchandise mined, produced, or 
manufactured wholly or in part’’ by forced 
labor. Such merchandise is subject to exclu-
sion or seizure and may lead to criminal in-
vestigation of the importer. 
(9) The policies of the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China are in contraven-
tion of international human rights instru-
ments signed by that government, includ-
ing—

Rights and the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, which the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China has signed but not 
yet ratified; 
(B) the International Covenant on Eco-
nomic, Social, and Cultural Rights, ratified 
by the People’s Republic of China in 2001; 
and

Persons, Especially Women and Children 
(Palermo Protocol), to which the People’s 
Republic of China has been a state party

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to prohibit the import of all goods, 
wares, articles, or merchandise mined, pro-
duced, or manufactured, wholly or in part, 
by forced labor from the People’s Republic of 
China and particularly any such goods, 
wares, articles, or merchandise produced in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of 
China; 
(2) to encourage the international commu-
nity to reduce the import of any goods made 
with forced labor from the People’s Republic 
of China, particularly those goods mined, 
manufactured, or produced in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region; 
(3) to coordinate with Mexico and Canada 
to effectively implement Article 23.6 of the 
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to 
prohibit the importation of goods produced 
in whole or in part by forced or compulsory 
labor, which includes goods produced in 
whole or in part by forced or compulsory 
labor in the People’s Republic of China; 
(4) to actively work to prevent, publicly 
denounce, and end human trafficking as a 
horrific assault on human dignity and to re-
store the lives of those affected by human 
trafficking, a modern form of slavery; 
(5) to regard the prevention of atrocities as 
in its national interest, including efforts to 
prevent torture, enforced disappearances, se-
vere deprivation of liberty, including mass 
internment, arbitrary detention, and wide-
spread and systematic use of forced labor, 
and persecution targeting any identifiable 
ethnic or religious group; and 
(6) to address gross violations of human 
rights in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region through bilateral diplomatic chan-
nels and multilateral institutions where 
both the United States and the People’s Re-
public of China are members and with all the 
authorities available to the United States 
Government, including visa and financial 
sanctions, export restrictions, and import 
controls.

EXCHANGE COMMISSION OF CER-
TAIN ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE 
XINJIANG 
UYGHUR 
AUTONOMOUS 
REGION. 
(a) POLICY STATEMENT.—It is the policy of 
the United States to protect American inves-
tors, through stronger disclosure require-
ments, alerting them to the presence of Chi-
nese and other companies complicit in gross 
violations of human rights in United States 
capital markets, including American and 
foreign companies listed on United States 
exchanges that enable the mass internment 
and population surveillance of Uyghurs, 
Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslim minori-
ties and source products made with forced 
labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region of China. Such involvements rep-
resent clear, material risks to the share val-
ues and corporate reputations of certain of 
these companies and hence to prospective 
American investors, particularly given that 
the United States Government has employed 
sanctions and export restrictions to target 
individuals and entities contributing to 
human rights abuses in the People’s Repub-
lic of China.

LATING
TO
THE XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONO-
MOUS REGION.—

SEC. 11. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CASTRO) and the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CASTRO). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include in the RECORD ex-
traneous material on H.R. 6210. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act. The human rights atrocities the 
Chinese Government is perpetuating in 
Xinjiang are now well-known. More 
than 1 million Uyghur and Muslim eth-
nic minorities have been thrown in de-
tention camps, where they face tor-
ture, brainwashing, sexual abuse, and 
even forced sterilization. 
These atrocities are horrific, and the 
Congress has acted to hold perpetrators 
of these crimes accountable by passing 
the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act. 
But we must not stop there. 
The legislation we are considering 
today focuses on a specific form of

abuse in Xinjiang: forced labor, an 
abuse of human rights which also has 
grave implications for supply chains 
and consumers worldwide. Importing 
goods made from forced labor violates 
U.S. law, and Americans certainly 
would not want to contribute to the 
PRC 
Government’s 
human 
rights 
abuses by unwittingly purchasing ap-
parel or hair products made by a de-
tained Uyghur. 
Among other things, this legislation 
reaffirms U.S. policy to reduce the 
number and types of goods made from 
forced labor, mandates reports sur-
rounding the U.S. Government’s strat-
egy to spread awareness of forced labor 
in Xinjiang and address that challenge, 
and requires the Secretary of State to 
determine whether the practice of 
forced labor in Xinjiang constitutes 
crimes against humanity or even geno-
cide. 
This measure builds on what Con-
gress has already done to hold the Chi-
nese Government accountable and to 
end the mass detention, repression, and 
surveillance of minorities in Xinjiang. 
I thank Chairman MCGOVERN, Mr. 
SMITH, and other bipartisan champions 
for their consistent leadership on these 
issues, and I hope Congress can, as we 
have before, take a strong stand 
against Beijing and its crimes. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in support of the 
bill. This is a good measure. I am 
pleased to support it, and I am also 
pleased that it has, I believe, bipar-
tisan support. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, September 17, 2020. 
Hon. ELIOT ENGEL, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN ENGEL: This is to advise 
you that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has now had an opportunity to review the 
provisions in H.R. 6210, the ‘‘Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act,’’ that fall within our 
Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your con-
sulting with us on those provisions. The Ju-
diciary Committee has no objection to your 
including them in the bill for consideration 
on the House floor, and to expedite that con-
sideration is willing to forgo action on H.R. 
6210, with the understanding that we do not 
thereby waive any future jurisdictional 
claim over those provisions or their subject 
matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, September 21, 2020. 
Hon. ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN ENGEL: In recognition of 
the desire to expedite consideration of H.R. 
6210, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act, the Committee on Ways and Means 
agrees to waive formal consideration of the 
bill as to provisions that fall within the rule

that we may address any remaining issues 
within our jurisdiction. The Committee also 
reserves the right to seek appointment of an 
appropriate number of conferees to any 
House-Senate conference involving this or 
similar legislation. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding

Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House 
of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing con-
cerning H.R. 6210, the ‘‘Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act.’’ In order to permit H.R. 6210 
to proceed expeditiously to the House Floor, 
I agree to forgo formal consideration of the 
bill. 
The Committee on Financial Services 
takes this action to forego formal consider-
ation of H.R. 6210 in light of the mutually 
agreed changes to provisions within the ju-
risdiction of the Committee on Financial 
Services. We are also doing so based on our 
mutual understanding that, by foregoing for-
mal consideration of H.R. 6210 at this time, 
we do not waive any jurisdiction over the 
subject matter contained in this or similar 
legislation, and that our Committee will be 
appropriately consulted and involved as this 
or similar legislation moves forward with re-
gard to any matters in the Committee’s ju-
risdiction. The Committee also reserves the 
right to seek appointment of an appropriate 
number of conferees to any House-Senate

conference involving this or similar legisla-
tion that involves the Committee’s jurisdic-
tion and request your support for any such 
request. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response

of letters on this matter be included in the 
Congressional Record during Floor consider-
ation of H.R. 6210. 
Sincerely, 
MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairman. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to start this 
debate with a simple truth that we 
cannot afford to forget: Truly free 
trade cannot involve slave labor. 
Today, 
the 
Chinese 
Community 
Party is using the forced labor of the 
Uyghurs and other minorities to help 
bankroll its cultural genocide against 
those very same groups. The repression 
taking place right now in Xinjiang is 
breathtaking in its scope and in its 
brutality. 
It involves the detention of 1 to 3 
million people in concentration camps, 
Madam Speaker. It involves surveil-
lance and attempted brainwashing on a 
massive scale. It involves breaking up 
families and taking children from their 
parents. It involves forced sterilization 
and, Madam Speaker, forced abortions. 
This should be a terrifying warning 
to the world, to China’s neighbors, and 
to the American people that the Chi-
nese Communist Party is fundamen-
tally focused on expanding its power, 
its control, and its authoritarian style 
of government. It views things that it 
does not control, like religion, cultural 
identity, and the yearning of all people 
for freedom, as threats that must be 
destroyed. 
Because we have drawn the CCP into 
our most essential supply chains, it 
can hold our national security hostage 
while it uses U.S. consumers to sub-
sidize its atrocities. 
As many as one in five cotton gar-
ments globally could be tainted with 
Uyghur slave labor. In July, U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection seized a 13- 
ton shipment of human hair—Madam 
Speaker, human hair—that originated 
in Xinjiang’s forced labor system. We 
haven’t heard about human hair since 
the Nazis and the concentration camps 
of the war that my father fought in, 
World War II. 
It is brazen, and it is sickening. We 
must refuse to be complicit, financially 
or otherwise, in the CCP’s crimes 
against the Muslim Uyghur. 
For that reason, I support this bill 
before us today. 
I must also point out the abuses in 
this province are not only one small 
part of the grave and growing threat 
that the Chinese Communist Party 
poses to the interests, the values, and 
the security of the United States. That 
threat is global and has military, eco-
nomic, public health, and philosophical 
aspects. 
I know that many on the other side 
of the aisle share my concerns. I, un-
fortunately, regret that, during this 
Congress, the majority has not given 
the CCP threat even one-tenth of the 
time they have put into their partisan 
efforts to bring down this President. 
We were told that the China Task 
Force was going to be bipartisan, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
and 
at 
the 
last 
minute, the majority pulled out. For 
the past 4 months, I have served as 
chairman of the China Task Force. 
This task force, again, was supposed to 
be bipartisan because I believe this is 
not a Republican or Democrat issue. 
Confronting the generational threat 
that the CCP poses should be a bipar-
tisan issue. It is an American issue 
against the greatest national security 
threat to the United States of America. 
I believe this failure of perspective 
needs to change. In our work on the 
China Task Force, we have met with 
125 people from both sides of the aisle 
to gain better insight into our relation-
ship and our foreign policy, as we 
speak here from the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, how we need to treat the 
Chinese Communist Party from a for-
eign policy standpoint. 
This, again, is an American issue, not 
Republican or Democrat. This report 
coming out October 1 will include 400 
recommendations, including 100 pieces 
of legislation that have bipartisan sup-
port like the bill before us today. 
So, Madam Speaker, I strongly urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. Then, once we get past this elec-
tion, Madam Speaker, let us come to-
gether on both sides and analyze objec-
tively our foreign policy with the Chi-
nese Communist Party and address the 
bipartisan 
bills 
that 
will 
be 
rec-
ommended by the task force to address 
the Chinese Communist Party’s malign 
activities throughout the world. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MCGOVERN), who is the author of this 
important bill and co-chair of the 
Human Rights Commission and chair-
man of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my friend from Texas 
(Mr. CASTRO) for yielding, but also for 
his commitment to human rights, not 
only with regard to the repression that 
is going on in China, but all around the 
world. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 6210, the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act. I am proud to 
have authored this legislation to ad-
dress human rights and forced labor 
abuses against Uyghur and other Mus-
lim groups in China. 
There is strong, diverse, bipartisan, 
and bicameral support for this legisla-
tion, including from my colleagues on 
the Congressional-Executive Commis-
sion on China. Senator MARCO RUBIO, 
Representative CHRIS SMITH, and Rep-
resentative TOM SUOZZI all helped draft 
this 
legislation. 
I 
thank 
Speaker 
NANCY PELOSI for her longtime advo-
cacy for human rights in China and for 
her leadership in getting this bill to 
the House floor. I thank Chairman 
ENGEL, as well as Ranking Member 
MCCAUL, Chairman NEAL, and Chair-
woman WATERS for the support of their 
committees. 
The Congressional-Executive Com-
mission on China, of which I serve as 
the chair, held the first congressional 
hearing on this topic a year ago, fol-
lowed up with a groundbreaking staff 
report, and then held an expert round-
table event on this issue. We found 
that the evidence of systematic and 
widespread forced labor in Xinjiang is 
astounding and irrefutable and in-
cludes evidence from camp detainees, 
satellite imagery of factories being 
built at internment camps, and public 
and leaked Chinese Government docu-
ments. All the evidence we accumu-
lated led to the introduction of this bi-
partisan, 
bicameral 
legislation 
in 
March 2020. 
It is time for Congress to act. Over 
the 
past 
several 
years, 
we 
have 
watched in horror as the Chinese Gov-
ernment first created and then ex-
panded a system of extrajudicial mass 
internment camps. As many as 1.8 mil-
lion Uyghurs and members of other 
predominantly Muslim ethnic minority 
groups have been arbitrarily detained 
in the camps and subjected to forced 
labor, torture, political indoctrination, 
and other severe human rights abuses. 
Reports published during the past 
year detailed an expansive and system-
atic policy of forcibly separating eth-
nic minority children from their fami-
lies. A Chinese Government policy doc-
ument stated that nearly half a million 
schoolchildren were attending boarding 
schools. The forcible displacement of 
children is in violation of the Chinese 
Government’s law on the protection of 
minors and the U.N. Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. 
Investigations during the past year 
detailed a policy of forcibly separating 
ethnic minority children from their 
families and the use of forced birth 
control and sterilization, which may be 
in contravention of the U.N. Conven-
tion on Genocide to which it is a party. 
The United States Holocaust Memorial 
Museum had already determined that 
crimes against humanity may have 
been committed. 
In July, I joined a bipartisan letter 
signed by over 75 Members calling on 
the Trump administration to make an 
official determination as to whether 
atrocity crimes, including genocide 
and crimes against humanity, are 
being committed. We have yet to hear 
back from the administration. 
It is time for Congress to act. We 
know forced labor is widespread and 
systematic, and it exists both within 
and 
outside 
the 
mass 
internment 
camps. These facts are confirmed by 
the testimony of former camp detain-
ees, satellite imagery, and official 
leaked documents from the Chinese 
Government. We know that many U.S., 
international, and Chinese companies

are complicit in the exploitation of 
forced labor and specific products in-
clude textiles, electronics, and food 
products. 
Audits of supply chains are simply 
not possible because workers cannot 
speak freely and honestly about work-
ing conditions, given heavy surveil-
lance and intimidation. 
Current U.S. law states that it is ille-
gal to import into the United States 
‘‘goods, wares, articles, and merchan-
dise mined, produced, or manufactured 
wholly or in part’’ by forced labor. Un-
fortunately, products made with forced 
labor are still making their way into 
global supply chains and our country. 
The Trump administration has taken 
some actions, including sending out a 
business advisory and placing withhold 
release orders on some businesses and 
entities in China. But these piecemeal 
actions fall far short of addressing a re-
gional economic system that is built 
upon a foundation of forced labor and 
repression. 
Further, we should all be disturbed 
by reports that President Trump gave 
a green light to President Xi by telling 
him that building the camps was ‘‘the 
right thing to do.’’ Ending forced labor 
was not even discussed as part of the 
‘‘Phase One’’ trade deal. 
It is time for Congress to act. The 
Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act 
prohibits imports from Xinjiang to the 
U.S. by creating a ‘‘rebuttal presump-
tion’’ that all goods produced in the re-
gion are made with forced labor unless 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
certifies by ‘‘clear and convincing evi-
dence’’ that goods were not produced 
with forced labor. 
The legislation also authorizes tar-
geted sanctions, requires financial dis-
closures about involvement in the re-
gion, and requires a State Department 
determination about whether crimes 
against humanity or genocide are oc-
curring. 
For more than 2 years, U.S. and 
international 
companies 
have 
been 
aware of forced labor throughout the 
Xinjiang region. It is long past time for 
these companies to reassess their sup-
ply chains and find alternatives that do 
not exploit labor and violate human 
rights. 
Their failure to do so has led U.S. 
consumers to unwittingly purchase 
goods made with forced labor. That 
must end. 
Effective enforcement would mean 
that workers and farmers would no 
longer have to compete against forced 
labor from Xinjiang. For too long, the 
world has been silent while Uyghurs 
and 
other 
Muslim 
groups 
suffered 
under severe repression. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired.

Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentleman. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
believe the lack of any international 
response for so long allowed the Chi-
nese Government the space to impose 
this extreme system of repression. But 
now the world has woken up. 
Today, the U.S. House of Representa-
tives is taking the strongest action 
yet. I am proud to stand in solidarity 
with the Uyghur people and, indeed, all 
the people living under the rule of the 
Chinese Government, in their struggle 
to live freely, practice their religious 
beliefs freely, and speak their own lan-
guages freely. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
the passage of this legislation, con-
tinuing our bipartisan work together 
to support human rights in China. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are advised to not traffic the well. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
commend the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), the chair-
man, for his steadfast support for 
human rights across the world. The 
gentleman and the next speaker have 
been on this issue, really, as visionary 
leaders, I would say, the two strongest 
in the House of Representatives rep-
resenting both sides of the aisle, and I 
thank him for that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), the ranking 
member 
of 
the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Human Rights, who has been working 
on these issues along with Chairman 
MCGOVERN for decades. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. 
MCCAUL, the ranking member, for his 
leadership, for his very, very strong 
and passionate statement today. I 
thank my good friend and colleague, 
Mr. MCGOVERN, the chairman of both 
the China Commission, as well as the 
Lantos Commission—and I serve as co-
chair with him on the Lantos Commis-
sion and as ranking member on the 
China Commission. And I am very 
pleased to be the principal Republican 
cosponsor of this bill. I see Mr. SUOZZI 
over there, who has been a great leader 
as well. We have been teaming up for 
years on this issue, and I thank him for 
his leadership as well. And ELIOT 
ENGEL, our chairman, for his work on 
this as well. 
Madam Speaker, at a 2018 Congres-
sional hearing I cochaired, Mihrigul 
Tursun recounted her ordeal of torture, 
sexual abuse, and detention in one of 
China’s mass internment camps in 
Xinjiang. She broke down weeping, 
telling us that she pleaded with God to 
end her life. Her Chinese jailers re-
strained her to a table, actually in-
creased the electrical currents cours-
ing through her body, and mocked her 
belief in God. She was tortured simply 
for being an ethnic Uyghur and a Mus-
lim in China. 
Madam Speaker, there are millions 
of stories like this waiting to be told. 
Nightmarish accounts of President Xi 
Jinping’s genocide. And make no mis-
take about it, this is Xi Jinping’s geno-
cide. I point out to my colleagues that 
this includes the mass internment of 
millions. An estimated 1.8 million vic-
tims in concentration camps, children 
ripped from the warm embrace of their 
families, to be indoctrinated in Com-
munist ideology and forced to renounce 
their religion, their culture, and their 
language. 
Rape and sexual abuse of women 
being held in internment camps, forced 
abortion and involuntary sterilization 
to prevent the birth of Uyghur chil-
dren, a direct violation of Article II(d) 
of 
the 
U.N. 
Genocide 
Convention, 
which states, in part, that genocide in-
cludes imposing measures intended to 
prevent births within a group. Forced 
labor on a massive scale that allows 
Chinese companies to profit, and profit 
big time, from modern-day slavery. 
Chinese authorities initially denied 
the 
existence 
of 
mass 
internment 
camps and tried to portray them as vo-
cational training. The Chinese Com-
munist Party employed the big lie, 
censorship and economic coercion to 
stifle any discussion of their crimes. 
However, documents obtained by the 
New York Times and the International 
Consortium of Investigative Journal-
ists have exposed beyond any reason-
able doubt the brutality behind Bei-
jing’s plans to radically and coercively 
transform the culture and religion of 
ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other 
Muslims in China. 
The leaked papers showed detailed 
plans—this is back years ago now—of 
looking to intern between 1 and 3 mil-
lion Uyghurs in these concentration 
camps and imposing Orwellian indoc-
trination efforts for those ‘‘whose 
thinking has been infected.’’ In other 
words, if you are a Muslim, your think-
ing is infected. 
At the same time, Beijing instituted 
plans to erase the influence of Islam in 
all 
of 
western 
China—bulldozing 
mosques and shrines, severely restrict-
ing religious practice, and forcing de-
tainees in the camps to renounce their 
faith. 
The leaked documents also show that 
Xi Jinping himself directed the crack-
down, saying the Communist Party 
must put the ‘‘organs of dictatorship’’ 
to work and show ‘‘absolutely no 
mercy’’ in dealing with the Uyghurs 
and other Muslims. 
In one speech, President Xi said: 
‘‘The weapons of the people’s demo-
cratic dictatorship, must be wielded 
without any hesitation or wavering.’’ 
In 2017, February, the documents 
show he told thousands of police offi-
cers and troops standing at attention 
in the vast square in Urumqi to prepare 
for a ‘‘smashing, obliterating offen-
sive.’’ Secret teams even went out—be-
cause some of the cops didn’t want to 
do this—and they expunged them from 
their ranks. 
Madam Speaker, we know that goods 
produced with forced labor find their 
way into U.S. markets. An estimated 
22 percent of U.S. cotton goods come 
from the region, and the U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection Agency has pro-
hibited 
companies 
from 
importing

some textiles, electronics, and hair 
products. As my good friend from 
Texas pointed out about the hair, the 
last time we talked about the buying 
and selling of hair was with the Nazi 
concentration camps. It is happening 
today in Xinjiang. 
Over the past year, the Trump ad-
ministration has matched strong rhet-
oric condemning abuses and actions to 
protect U.S. national security and pun-
ish Chinese authorities and corpora-
tions complicit in these human rights 
abuses. 
Since last October, the Commerce 
Department has placed over 40 Chinese 
companies and government entities on 
its Entity List, restricting exports be-
cause of their complicity in human 
rights abuses and enabling high-tech 
surveillance. 
In July, the Treasury Department 
issued 
Global 
Magnitsky 
sanctions 
against six senior Chinese officials; 
however, we want more. There are 
other people that are complicit. They 
need to be on the list. 
Treasury has also sanctioned the 
Xinjiang 
Production 
Construction 
Corps, a paramilitary that reports di-
rectly to the CCP. This summer, U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection banned 
eight other Chinese companies from 
importing textiles, hair, and electronic 
parts from Xinjiang. We welcome these 
steps, but more needs to be done. 
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act prohibits imports from Xinjiang to 
the U.S. by creating a ‘‘rebuttable pre-
sumption.’’ And that is the core of this 
bill, that all goods produced in the re-
gion are made with forced labor unless 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
certifies by clear and convincing evi-
dence that goods were not produced 
with forced labor. So the rebuttable 
presumption is the key to this legisla-
tion. 
It also carries other provisions, im-
portant ones, but, again, that is the 
most important one. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, the legislation also authorizes 
targeted sanctions on any person re-
sponsible for labor tracking; protects 
U.S. investors and consumers by re-
quiring financial disclosure from U.S. 
traded businesses about their engage-
ment with Chinese companies and 
other 
entities 
engaged 
in 
serious 
human rights abuses; directs the Sec-
retary of State to determine whether 
forced labor or other crimes against 
Uyghurs constitute crimes against hu-
manity or genocide. I think it couldn’t 
be clear. Read the Genocide Conven-
tion. One item after the other articu-
lated in that convention is being met, 
sadly, by Xi Jinping’s horrible genocide 
against his own people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
the bill. It is a bipartisan bill—67 co-
sponsors in all. Republicans and Demo-
crats joined saying, ‘‘we want this 
stopped.’’ 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. SUOZZI). 
Mr. 
SUOZZI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Mr. CASTRO for yielding. I thank 
Mr. SMITH for his great work on this, 
and Chairman BLUMENAUER
for the 
work of the Committee of Ways and 
Means. And I thank Chairman MCGOV-
ERN as well. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this bipartisan Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act. We really need 
to wake people out of their torpor. It 
has been reported in the newspapers 
often, but I don’t think most Ameri-
cans realize exactly what is going on in 
China. 
It was almost 50 years ago when 
Nixon first went to China. And we al-
ways believed, as Americans, that the 
more they are exposed to our way of 
life, our democracy, our economic sys-
tem, the more they would become like 
us. That simply has not happened. 
We have had hearings on the China 
Commission. We had a hearing the 
other day of the Committee on Ways 
and Means, and the witnesses testified 
not only about forced labor, which is 
clear, but they talked about crimes 
against humanity. They talked about 
forced sterilization. They talked about 
forcing people to eat pork, even though 
it violates their religion. They talked 
about prohibiting people from prac-
ticing their faith, attending religious 
ceremonies, observing fasts. 
It is hard to imagine that in today’s 
world that forced labor is happening 
and we know about it. We need to rec-
ognize that China has to be held ac-
countable. We have rules in place now 
that say you can’t use forced labor, but 
this bill is going a big step further in 
saying everything that comes out of 
the Xinjiang region will be presumed to 
be using forced labor. This is going to 
have a big impact. A lot of the cotton 
in the world comes from China; 84 per-
cent of that cotton from China comes 
from the Xinjiang region. This will 
have an impact. We will have to sup-
port other countries to produce cotton. 
We will have to work to get the North-
ern Triangle, for example, to produce 
cotton so we can try and address those 
issues where our friends are. But we 
need to hold China and the Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
accountable 
for 
these violative acts of our very con-
science. We have to do everything we 
can do to stand up for our values and to 
say this is simply unacceptable. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
for their support. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. YOHO), the ranking mem-
ber 
of 
the 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Sub-
committee on Asia and the Pacific. 
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman and the leaders on the 
Democrat side. 
Since 2017, the CCP has systemically 
targeted and rounded up over a million 
people comprised of Uyghurs and other 
East Turkic minorities and put them 
in concentration camps where they 
were subject to inhumane living condi-
tions, forced cultural brainwashing, 
rape, and torture. 
Just this week, the CCP released a 
white paper regarding its detention of 
Uyghurs. They admitted to incarcer-
ating up to 1.3 million Uyghurs per 
year from 2014 to 2019. That is up to 8 
million innocent people in prison, 
brainwashed, tortured, raped, in their 
so-called reeducation, which are really 
concentration 
camps. 
If 
they 
will 
admit to that, how many more are 
there really that have been interned? 
The 
Chinese 
State 
is 
not 
only 
complicit but responsible for activity 
supporting the genocidal campaign tar-
geting vulnerable populations based on 
everything from religious beliefs, their 
language, their hairstyle and even 
their diet. This is not even to mention 
the horrific practices of forced steri-
lization and ‘‘marriages’’ to Han Chi-
nese men. 
Many of these people have now been 
forced into manufacturing jobs under 
harsh 
conditions, 
which 
we 
have 
heard—Mr. 
SMITH
and 
Chairman 
MCCAUL have pointed out—these prod-
ucts benefitting from forced labor have 
found their ways into our supply 
chains through major brands and cor-
porations as it becomes increasingly 
difficult for companies to conduct due 
diligence investigations in China. 
Further, we must recognize that the 
Chinese diplomatic presence globally is 
also engaged in this effort. A wealth of 
evidence is available to suggest that 
Chinese 
embassies 
and 
consulates 
around the world are actively seeking 
to force Chinese Uyghurs to return to 
mainland China, often to renew their 
passports, only to be abducted imme-
diately and sent to one of the camps. 
As Members of Congress, we have a 
moral obligation to ensure that the 
state-sponsored campaign of ethnic 
cleansing and forced labor—reminis-
cent of the concentration camps of the 
Nazi regime, when we swore as a world 
community, ‘‘never again’’—are shut 
down and punished to the full extent of 
U.S. and international law. 
The business community of America 
also has a moral obligation, from man-
ufacturing to Hollywood, to not ap-
pease China in the name of profit. 
Madam Speaker, as an original co-
sponsor of this bill, I support its pas-
sage in the House and encourage its 
timely consideration in the Senate. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI), 
our 
distinguished 
Speaker 
of 
the 
House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
CASTRO) for yielding, and for bringing 
this important legislation to the floor 
and giving us a chance to honor our 
values in the most bipartisan way. 
One of the saddest things of all of 
this is how many people are suffering.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4665 
September 22, 2020 
One of the joys of it is that it has en-
abled us to work together over the 
years. 
Madam Speaker, I would ask the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) 
how many years—at least, 30, working 
together on this subject. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act and the Uyghur Forced Labor Dis-
closure Act, two strong bipartisan bills 
to send a strong message to Beijing and 
to the world that the U.S. Congress 
will not allow human rights to be sac-
rificed for commercial interest. 
As I have said many times, if Amer-
ica does not speak out for human 
rights in China because of commercial 
interest, we lose all moral authority to 
speak out about human rights any-
where in the world. 
b 1230 
I salute Chairman JIM
MCGOVERN, 
chair of the Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China and chair of the 
Tom Lantos Human Rights Commis-
sion, a leading voice in the country and 
in the Congress for human rights. 
I thank Congresswoman JENNIFER 
WEXTON, one of our new freshmen, for 
her early leadership and dedication she 
has brought to this priority. 
I thank, also, Mr. SMITH, and I ac-
knowledge our working together over 
the years. He is now the ranking mem-
ber 
of 
the 
Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China and co-chair of 
the Lantos Commission. 
I salute our chairman of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee, Mr. ENGEL, and our 
leaders in the Senate, Senator RUBIO 
and Senator MERKLEY. 
I thank our chairman, again, for this 
opportunity and so many of our Mem-
bers who have spoken on this issue. 
Beijing’s barbarous actions targeting 
the Uyghur people continue to be an 
outrage to the collective conscience of 
the world. Across the Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region, the Uyghur peo-
ple and other Muslim majorities are 
brutally repressed in a pervasive state 
of mass surveillance and predictive po-
licing used to discriminate against and 
violate the human rights of minorities: 
incidents 
of 
mass 
shootings, 
extrajudicial killings, intimidation and 
suppression of journalists courageously 
exposing the truth, and the mass incar-
ceration of more than—and this is a 
lower figure; I think it is higher, but it 
is a conservative figure—1 million in-
nocent people with beatings, solitary 
confinement, deprivation of food and 
medical treatment, and extensively 
documented programs of forced labor. 
So if you are out there watching the 
Congress, know what this means to 
you. The exploitation of people in 
China has a direct impact on our trade 
policy and on our values, first and fore-
most. 
Tragically, the products of the forced 
labor often end up here in American 
stores and homes. In fact, roughly one 
in five cotton garments sold globally 
contains cotton or yarn from the 
Xinjiang region, the Uyghur region. 
We must shine a light on the inhu-
mane practice of forced labor, hold the 
perpetrators accountable, and stop this 
exploitation. And we must send a clear 
message to Beijing: These abuses must 
end now. 
I remember years ago when Mr. 
SMITH and Frank Wolf visited forced 
labor—I don’t know if you call them 
prisons or whatever—in China. Their 
courage to go there was so over-
whelming to the rest of us. They were 
able to document what we needed to 
know. 
Unfortunately, the challenge to the 
conscience that they brought to us was 
not heeded by all here. We could over-
whelmingly win in the House and even 
in the Senate but not be able to over-
ride a veto, whether it was a Democrat 
or a Republican in the White House. 
But I remember how brave they were 
and how brave those prisoners were to 
show them the evidence of the forced 
labor so we could make the case to 
workers in America: You have been 
subjected to the exploitation of work-
ers there; that is an exploitation of 
workers here. 
Again, we were proud, in May, to pass 
the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, 
which uncovers the truth of China’s 
abuses and ensures that those sup-
porting labor camps, and urges the ap-
plication of targeted sanctions against 
those involved in the oppression of the 
Uyghur people. 
Today, we build on that overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan legislation with these 
two bills which, together, will ensure 
that goods made in the Xinjiang region 
and imported to the United States are 
not made with forced labor. 
Congress must and will continue to 
speak 
out 
against 
Beijing’s 
other 
human rights abuses, like the decades- 
long abuse faced by the Tibetan peo-
ple—the Chinese are there to crush 
their culture, eliminate their language, 
and suppress their religion; their as-
sault on the honor of His Holiness the 
Dalai Lama by saying they will choose 
his successor goes beyond the pale and 
it is a challenge to the conscience of 
the world—the Hong Kong fight for de-
mocracy and the rule of law, which 
they oppress; and the jailing of journal-
ists, human rights lawyers, Christians, 
and democracy advocates on the main-
land. 
That is why the House is proud to 
have passed legislation, including the 
Hong Kong Human Rights and Democ-
racy Act, the Hong Kong Autonomy 
Act, and the Tibet Policy and Support 
Act, which we urge the Senate to take 
up immediately. All of this was passed 
in an overwhelmingly bipartisan way 
because we respect the dignity and 
worth of every person. 
We have always said that we cannot 
look the other way when this oppres-
sion of millions of people is taking 
place, and we are acting upon those 
values and those beliefs that we have. 
In honor of the millions fighting for 
their dignity, safety, and rights in 
China and around the world, I urge a 
strong bipartisan vote for the Uyghur 
Forced Labor Protection Act and the 
Uyghur Forced Labor Disclosure Act. 
Madam Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. 
MCCAUL, ranking member on the com-
mittee of jurisdiction, and everyone for 
their support. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, let 
me thank Speaker PELOSI. She actu-
ally came to our committee markup of 
this bill. It is very rare for a Speaker of 
the House to show up to a committee 
markup, and yet this issue is so impor-
tant to her that she honored us with 
her presence in that markup. This is 
where we come together in the Con-
gress, and I want to thank you for your 
support, Madam Speaker. 
And I thank Mr. SMITH, who has been 
dealing for decades with this. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JACOBS). 
Mr. JACOBS. Madam Speaker, I want 
to first acknowledge an individual 
from my district, Dr. Sean Roberts. 
I grew up with Sean Roberts in Buf-
falo, New York. Sean is a professor now 
at George Washington University. He 
has studied the Uyghur people for over 
30 years and recently released a book, 
entitled, ‘‘The War on the Uyghurs: 
China’s Internal Campaign Against a 
Muslim Minority.’’ It is a book that 
has a depth of research about the 
atrocities against these people for a 
long, long time, and I want to com-
mend him for his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, long before China 
endangered the global community with 
their lies and failures in response to 
the 
coronavirus, 
we 
knew 
of 
the 
threats they posed, but many ignored 
them. We can no longer allow them a 
free pass. Today, we are here to con-
demn yet another of China’s Com-
munist regime’s crimes, the atrocious 
record on human rights, specifically, 
the persecution and forced labor of the 
Uyghur people. 
The actions of the Chinese Com-
munist regime are appalling, a threat 
to freedom everywhere, and must be 
condemned in unwavering terms. It is 
our duty as the strongest beacon of 
freedom in the world to shine a light 
upon these atrocities, sanction those 
who condone it, and eradicate such 
evil. 
Freedom is not based on just the 
ideals you hold; rather, it is based on 
your ability to hold those ideals with-
out fear. I urge every one of my col-
leagues to support these measures and 
send a resolute and strong message to 
the Chinese Communist Party that we 
will not tolerate their human rights 
violations. 
No more should they be able to act as 
a rogue nation, a bully, and a manipu-
lator that disregards their own citi-
zens’ lives and puts the entire global 
community in danger. Until China 
changes its ways, ends the torture of 
the Uyghur people, and acts as a re-
sponsible global citizen, we will not 
weaken our pressure. With one voice, 
let’s condemn the atrocities committed 
against the Uyghur people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4666 
September 22, 2020 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. JA-
COBS). 
Mr. JACOBS. Madam Speaker, let’s 
work towards ending our foreign de-
pendence on the Communist regime 
and hold them accountable for the lives 
of every individual their lies have 
killed. 
I look forward to working with the 
Senate to refine and improve this bill 
and endorse the strong measures it will 
take to hold the Chinese regime ac-
countable. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE), a valued member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to cosponsor the Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act, legisla-
tion that bans products of forced labor 
by Uyghurs to the United States. 
I want to acknowledge and thank 
Chairman MCGOVERN, Chairman BLU-
MENAUER, Ranking Member MCCAUL, 
Mr. SMITH, and others who have led 
this effort. 
As members of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, we work every day to en-
sure that America stands up for free-
dom around the world, and we take ac-
tion to promote freedom in human 
rights around the globe. So, in that 
vein, we must ensure that the exploi-
tation of the Uyghurs and other ethnic 
minorities does not continue. 
Most Americans would be shocked to 
learn that, for years, Uyghurs have 
been interned, tortured, interrogated, 
and brutally forced into labor by the 
Chinese Government, and then prod-
ucts they manufacture make their way 
into the U.S. market. This bill will 
stop these practices. 
We must pass this legislation to 
crack 
down 
on 
China’s 
abhorrent 
human rights practices. We must con-
tinue to be a force for democratic val-
ues and human rights in our own coun-
try and around the world. 
This is an example of working to-
gether in a bipartisan way to make it 
clear that the United States of Amer-
ica will not remain silent while these 
gross human rights violations con-
tinue, and we will do all that we can to 
bring the attention of the world to the 
important practices of the Chinese 
Communist Government by passing 
these two pieces of legislation. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Oregon 
(Mr. 
BLU-
MENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
last week our subcommittee held a 
hearing on the Chinese Government’s 
use of forced labor for the production 
of all kinds of goods through a con-
certed program of oppression and co-
erced assimilation of China’s Uyghur 
population. 
You have heard the horrible details 
that we had expressed in our com-
mittee. We have had a long history of 
grappling with the depravity of forced 
labor and ensuring that goods produced 
under such conditions do not eventu-
ally make their way into our grocery 
stores and shopping malls across the 
country. 
We passed a law a century ago pro-
hibiting importation of such goods. 
But, unfortunately, the ban—founded 
on 
principles 
of 
morality, 
human 
rights, worker rights, as well principles 
of fair competition—has, to be chari-
table, a history of spotty implementa-
tion. 
We don’t pretend that it is going to 
be easy to stop this. Global supply 
chains now are complex and inter-
related. It is going to require the con-
certed efforts of us all. But we should 
not allow complex supply chains to jus-
tify the chains of oppression on the 
Uyghur populations now. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in the aftermath of the pas-
sage of this legislation, that we work 
to actually implement it, we work with 
the expressions that have been positive 
from the private sector and NGOs, and 
other partners, to make sure that it is 
real. It is going to require concerted ef-
fort. It is going to require some dis-
location. We may even pay a dime or 
two more for a pair of socks or a T- 
shirt. 
But I do think not being complicit 
with this horrific oppression of over a 
million—and I agree with Mr. SMITH, it 
may well be more than that. It is time 
for us to make sure that we take a 
stand. Make it real. 
I deeply appreciate the sentiment on 
both sides of the aisle that we are com-
mitted to stop it now. In an era of, 
shall we say, a little conflict, this 
could be a bright spot for us going for-
ward. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, in recent years, the 
world has stood by idly as the Chinese 
Communist Party rounded up more 
than a million—probably a lot more 
than that—ethnic minorities into con-
centration camps where they are tor-
tured, brainwashed, and forced into 
labor. This is all part of a deliberate 
program by the CCP to wipe out their 
ethnic identity, their religion, their 
culture, anything that might compete 
with the Communist Party for their 
loyalties and affection. 
We have a moral duty today to speak 
out against these horrifying crimes 
against humanity and against the 
Uyghurs and, as the Speaker men-
tioned, against the Tibetans and Chris-
tians as well, who are persecuted in the 
Chinese Communist regime. 
But we have an even greater duty to 
avoid funding this genocide by paying 
for slave labor in Xinjiang. There can 
no longer be business as usual with 
China. 
Madam Speaker, the world is watch-
ing. I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1245 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume for the purposes of clos-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, this is a matter of 
whether the United States, as it has for 
generations, will remain a north star 
around the world when it comes to 
things like freedom, human rights, de-
mocracy, and rooting out corruption. 
This is an issue of human rights. Mil-
lions of people are being subjugated 
right now by the Chinese Government. 
And despite international contamina-
tion, atrocities continue in Xinjiang, 
and China shows no signs of changing 
course, including recently releasing a 
white paper defending these ‘‘voca-
tional training centers.’’ 
The United States should use its 
unique position in the global trading 
system to advance workers’ rights and 
the freedom and dignity of all people, 
and to signal other like-minded coun-
tries to act accordingly. 
I am very pleased to support this 
measure. I am glad that it has strong 
bipartisan support, and I urge all the 
Members to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CAS-
TRO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 6210, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY ACT 
OF 2020 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 2166) to author-
ize a comprehensive, strategic ap-
proach for United States foreign assist-
ance 
to 
developing 
countries 
to 
strengthen global health security, and 
for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2166 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global 
Health Security Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In December 2009, President Obama re-
leased the National Strategy for Countering 
Biological Threats, which listed as one of 
seven objectives ‘‘Promote global health se-
curity: Increase the availability of and ac-
cess to knowledge and products of the life 
sciences that can help reduce the impact 
from outbreaks of infectious disease whether 
of natural, accidental, or deliberate origin’’. 
(2) In February 2014, the United States and 
nearly 30 other nations launched the Global 
Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to address 
several high-priority, global infectious dis-
ease threats. The GHSA is a multi-faceted, 
multi-country initiative intended to accel-
erate partner countries’ measurable capabili-
ties to achieve specific targets to prevent, 
detect, and respond to infectious disease 
threats, whether naturally occurring, delib-
erate, or accidental. 
(3) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the 
Sustainable 
Development 
Goals 
(SDGs), 
which include specific reference to the im-
portance of global health security as part of 
SDG 3 ‘‘ensure healthy lives and promote 
well-being for all at all ages’’ as follows: 
‘‘strengthen the capacity of all countries, in 
particular developing countries, for early 
warning, risk reduction and management of 
national and global health risks’’. 
(4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama 
signed Executive Order 13747, ‘‘Advancing 
the Global Health Security Agenda to 
Achieve a World Safe and Secure from Infec-
tious Disease Threats’’. 
(5) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial 
Meeting in Uganda, the United States and 
more than 40 GHSA member countries sup-
ported the ‘‘Kampala Declaration’’ to extend 
the GHSA for an additional 5 years to 2024. 
(6) In December 2017, President Trump re-
leased the National Security Strategy, which 
includes the priority action: ‘‘Detect and 
contain biothreats at their source: We will 
work with other countries to detect and 
mitigate outbreaks early to prevent the 
spread of disease. We will encourage other 
countries to invest in basic health care sys-
tems and to strengthen global health secu-
rity across the intersection of human and 
animal health to prevent infectious disease 
outbreaks’’. 
(7) In September 2018, President Trump re-
leased the National Biodefense Strategy, 
which includes objectives to ‘‘strengthen 
global health security capacities to prevent 
local 
bioincidents 
from 
becoming 
epidemics’’, and ‘‘strengthen international

Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I

Madam Speaker, pandemics don’t re-
spect borders and they don’t care about 
nationalities. We have witnessed that 
this year with the spread of the 
coronavirus. That is why this bill 
comes before us at a critical time. I 
want to say a very big thank you to 
GERRY CONNOLLY from Virginia for au-
thoring this important legislation. 
In the last 8 months, we have 
watched this pandemic spread around 
the world, upending the global econ-
omy, disrupting our lives and creating 
grave uncertainty about what happens 
next. Unfortunately, the administra-
tion’s catastrophic response to the cur-
rent COVID–19 pandemic has led to 
nearly 200,000 American deaths. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Sincerely, 
ADAM B. SCHIFF, 
Chairman. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, as this painful year 
has 
hammered 
home: 
viruses 
and 
pandemics know no borders. The bipar-
tisan Global Health Security Act reaf-
firms our commitment to promoting 
global health security as a core issue of 
national security. 
This bill—and I want to thank my 
friend, GERRY
CONNOLLY
and STEVE 
CHABOT, who, I am not sure if he will be 
able to speak or not—but I want to 
thank them for bringing this bill for-
ward. 
This bill directs the President to es-
tablish an interagency review council 
that will support our executive branch 
agencies and ensure coordination be-
tween their efforts. It also requires the 
designation of a lead official as the 
United States coordinator for Global 
Health Security, who will be respon-
sible for coordinating the U.S. response 
to global health crises across agencies. 
As our country continues to fight 
COVID–19 and this pandemic, we must 
make sure our preparations to fight fu-
ture threats to the health and security 
of Americans are as efficient and effec-
tive as they can be. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
sponsors of the bill, Mr. CONNOLLY and 
Mr. CHABOT, for their leadership in sup-
porting and introducing this bill. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend from Texas (Mr. 
CASTRO) and my other good friend from 
Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) for their leader-
ship and generosity in allowing us to 
bring this bipartisan bill before the 
floor. 
Madam Speaker, I rise, of course, in 
support of H.R. 2166, the Global Health 
Security Act, which reaffirms the 
United States’ commitment in pro-
moting global health security. 
I first introduced this bill in partner-
ship with my colleague, STEVE CHABOT 
of Ohio, 2 years ago, before the pan-
demic, when we identified a dearth of 
leadership and strategy around U.S. 
planning for a global health security 
emergency. 
Tragically, the global COVID–19 pan-
demic has underscored not only the 
need for a robust Federal response to 
such a crisis, but also the importance 
of investing in global health security 
around the world because viruses and 
diseases do not respect national bor-
ders. We are truly in this together. 
Amid concerns about the response to 
COVID–19, I welcome the fact that the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee coa-
lesced around a bipartisan solution 
that addresses deficiencies in the cur-
rent response as well as to demonstrate 
a commitment to a comprehensive and 
sustainable approach to global health 
security. 
One of the critical lessons learned 
during the U.S. response to the 2014 
Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the 
need for a permanent designated offi-
cial responsible for coordinating the 
interagency response to a global health 
security emergency in the event of a 
pandemic. 
In fact, the primary recommendation 
of the recent CSIS report on Strength-
ening America’s Health Security is to 
restore the health security leadership 
at the White House National Security 
Council by naming a senior level leader 
in charge of coordinating U.S. efforts 
to anticipate, to prevent, and to re-
spond to biological crises. 
Despite bipartisan support, sadly, the 
administration eliminated the previous 
NSC position responsible for just such 
a crisis 2 years ago. 
At a time when decisive leadership 
and robust Federal coordination is 
sorely needed to combat the global 
COVID–19 pandemic, our Global Health 
Security Act would reestablish the 
government-wide lead for pandemic re-
sponse by creating a U.S. coordinator. 
This legislation also establishes an 
interagency review council, as Mr. 
MCCAUL indicated, charged with imple-
menting U.S. commitments around a 
Global Health Security Agenda and 
sets 
important 
metrics 
for 
global 
health security planning. 
And the bill requires a global health 
security strategy that helps other 
countries, as well as our own, to 
strengthen their healthcare systems in 
order to detect, prevent and mitigate 
outbreaks early. 
Republican and Democratic Presi-
dents have recognized the critical im-
portance of global health security,

from President Obama’s role in launch-
ing the Global Health Security Agenda 
to President Trump’s National Secu-
rity Strategy and National Biodefense 
Strategy. 
Whether it is the current COVID–19 
pandemic or the next crisis, it is clear 
these threats are going to be ongoing 
and perhaps increasing. Saving lives 
from the next global pandemic starts 
with investing in preparedness before it 
strikes. As we have seen time and 
again, diseases don’t respect borders, 
and global health crises have immense 
security, economic, and humanitarian 
consequences, as we are seeing now. 
Our Global Health Security Act rec-
ognizes the critical role of U.S. leader-
ship in international health security 
and enshrines U.S. global health secu-
rity policy in statute. 
I am proud that this bill passed the 
House 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee 
unanimously and was included in both 
the House-passed HEROES Act and the 
House-passed National Defense Author-
ization Act. 
The Global Health Security Act is 
endorsed by ChildFund International, 
Global Health Council, International 
Medical 
Corps, 
IntraHealth 
Inter-
national, the Johns Hopkins Center for 
Health Security, Nuclear Threat Initia-

Health, Sabin Vaccine Institute, The

Madam Speaker, I want to thank my

LARSEN
from 
Washington, 
BRIAN

I urge my colleagues to adopt it as a 
prudent measure in response to this 
pandemic. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I reiterate the vi-
sion of both Mr. CONNOLLY and Mr. 
CHABOT for introducing this bill, and 
the discussions I believe, as the gen-
tleman stated from Virginia, took 
place 2 years ago, well before the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), 
who introduced the bill and is the co-
author. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the ranking member for 
yielding. And I want to thank the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) 
for his leadership on this. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2166, the Global Health Security 
Act. And this was already stated, it 
was bipartisan legislation offered by 
my good friend, Mr. CONNOLLY. We 
have worked on a whole range of issues 
in a bipartisan manner over the years. 
He is a Democrat and I am a Repub-
lican, but we actually worked together. 
He and I introduced it at the beginning 
of last year. So this was early 2019 to 
strengthen U.S. and global prepared-
ness for and capacity to respond to 
pandemics like the coronavirus. 
b 1300 
This legislation was not born out of 
the coronavirus. It was born out of a 
bipartisan 
vision 
for 
strengthening 
global health systems around the world 
in case a disease like the coronavirus 
emerged. And as we know, it did, 
catching the whole world really flat- 
footed. 
Congressman CONNOLLY and I intro-
duced this legislation in April 2019, 
well before anyone had ever heard the 
term ‘‘COVID–19.’’ When the Foreign 
Affairs Committee considered this leg-
islation in March of this year, there 
were 100,000 coronavirus cases world-
wide. That number has now risen, as we 
know, to over 30 million that we know 
of. 
The Global Health Security Act has 
two main objectives. 
First, it codifies bipartisan support 
for the Global Health Security Agenda. 
This multilateral partnership started 
under the Obama administration and 
was embraced by the Trump adminis-
tration. It aims to strengthen health 
systems and laboratories in countries 
across the globe so that they meet 
International Health Regulation stand-
ards. 
Many of our constituents may won-
der why we should support health sys-
tems abroad when there are so many 
needs 
here 
at 
home. 
Well, 
the 
coronavirus pandemic clearly shows 
that a weak and opaque health system 
in 
another 
country—in 
this 
case, 
China—can directly threaten us right 
here in America. That is why we must 
remain vigilant, so we can contain fu-
ture emergent deadly diseases where 
they originate before they have a 
chance to become a pandemic and af-
fect us here at home. 
Second, our bill makes sure that we 
have the personnel in place to prepare 
and respond to pandemics like the 
coronavirus. We need someone to co-
ordinate our government’s response 
since that response inevitably involves 
several agencies across the govern-
ment, from the State Department to 
the CDC, et cetera. 
Several Republicans, including then- 
Chairman Ed Royce, called on the 
Obama administration to appoint a sin-
gle point person with a health back-
ground during the Ebola outbreak back 
in 2014. President Obama’s team got it 
half right by choosing a single person, 
who was a political appointee. The 
Trump administration appointed Dr. 
Debbie Birx, this time a universally re-
spected health expert, as White House 
Coronavirus 
Response 
Coordinator 
under Vice President MIKE PENCE. 
In any event, our bill would make 
this position permanent so that when 
the next pandemic comes, America and 
the world are fully prepared to address 
that crisis. 
Witnessing the death toll and the 
economic 
devastation 
that 
the 
coronavirus has brought, I think all 
Americans will agree that protecting 
our 
Nation’s 
health 
from 
future 
pandemics must be seen as a national 
security priority. We need to take this 
opportunity to recommit to leadership 
on global health security and prepare 
the world to face and defeat the next 
pandemic. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. I again thank the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) for his leader-
ship on this bill. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Missouri (Mrs. WAGNER), an es-
teemed member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, the vice chairwoman of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, and also a 
cosponsor of this bill. 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2166, the bipartisan Global 
Health Security Act. This very impor-
tant bill will greatly bolster the United 
States’ ability to prevent and respond 
to global health threats like the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
As we have seen during this tragedy, 
infectious diseases can spread across 
borders and oceans with deadly speed. 
Improving nations’ abilities to address 
public health threats before they spin 
out of control is, in fact, a matter of 
national security. 
The United States must lead the way 
in strengthening international health 
security measures. Investing in multi-
lateral initiatives that reduce the 
threat of global health catastrophes is 
a bipartisan priority, and I am proud to 
colead this landmark bill with Rep-
resentatives CONNOLLY, CHABOT, BERA, 
FITZPATRICK, and LARSEN. 
The Global Health Security Act es-
tablishes a special adviser for global 
health security at the National Secu-
rity Council, ensuring that U.S. efforts 
to respond to public health emer-
gencies are efficient and well-coordi-
nated. 
It also requires the United States to 
proactively strategize for future crises 
and strengthens our ability to help our 
partners fight and contain outbreaks 
within their own borders. 
The Global Health Security Act will 
save lives by helping us prepare for or 
prevent the next pandemic. I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
The thing I really enjoy about the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, as I know 
the Speaker would agree with me, is 
that it is bipartisan. I would say that 
the majority of bills passed out of our 
committee—in fact, I would say no

other committee has passed more bi-
partisan bills than the House Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs, as it should 
be. 
I thank my good friend JOAQUIN CAS-
TRO from Texas. 
Of course, Madam Speaker, you are 
from Texas. We seem to have a trifecta 
here today from Texas. 
But I will say Chairman ENGEL has 
been a great partner to me, working to-
gether as a chairman and ranking 
member should on a national security 
committee. We should put the interests 
of the Nation above partisan politics, 
and that has been our charge and our 
duty. 
I am, quite frankly, proud to say that 
is how we have conducted ourselves in 
this Congress. It is very gratifying, 
Madam Speaker, to close out this ses-
sion of Congress, before this very tu-
multuous election cycle and very divi-
sive time in our politics and our Amer-
ican history, but for me to be able to 
close this out in a very bipartisan way, 
that, I think, is what most Americans 
out there want from their leaders in 
the Congress. 
I thank the gentleman from Texas 
and the Speaker from Texas for your 
bipartisan support. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time for the purpose of closing. 
As the saying goes, an ounce of pre-
vention is worth a pound of cure, and 
that is undoubtedly true in global 
health. We have seen firsthand the dan-
gers of a lack of preparedness. 
Today’s legislation will prepare a co-
ordinated 
response 
for 
future 
pandemics. I give a special thank you 
to Mr. CONNOLLY for authoring this im-
portant legislation and, of course, I 
thank Mr. MCCAUL of Texas and the 
others who have worked in a bipartisan 
way to get this bill to the floor today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The question is on the 
motion offered by the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CASTRO) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
2166, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

GLOBAL CHILD THRIVE ACT OF 
2020 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 4864) to develop 
and implement policies to advance 
early childhood development, to pro-
vide assistance for orphans and other 
vulnerable children in developing coun-
tries, and for other purposes, as amend-
ed. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4864 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global Child 
Thrive Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) According to a 2019 report from the 
United Nations Inter-Agency Group for Child 
Mortality Estimation entitled ‘‘Levels & 
Trends in Child Mortality’’, the annual num-
ber of deaths among children younger than 
15 years of age dropped by 56 percent between 
1990 and 2018, from approximately 14,200,000 
to approximately 6,200,000. 
(2) According to a 2016 article published in 
The Lancet entitled ‘‘Early childhood devel-
opment: the foundation of sustainable devel-
opment’’— 
(A) an estimated 250,000,000 children in low- 
income and middle-income countries suffer 
suboptimal development due to poverty and 
stunting alone; and 
(B) children who do not meet develop-
mental milestones are expected to lose about 
25 percent of their average yearly income 
once they become adults. 
(3) According to a report from the United 
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), entitled 
‘‘The State of the World’s Children 2016: A 
fair 
chance 
for 
every 
child’’, 
nearly 
250,000,000 of the world’s 650,000,000 primary 
school age children do not master basic lit-
eracy and numeracy. 
(4) According to a 2018 report from the 
World Health Organization entitled ‘‘Nur-
turing Care for early childhood develop-
ment’’— 
(A) the environment in which a child grows 
has a profound impact on future learning, be-
havior, and health; and 
(B) a country’s economic diversity and 
growth could be improved by investment in 
early childhood development. 
(5) According to a 2017 UNICEF report enti-
tled ‘‘UNICEF’s Programme Guidance for 
Early Childhood Development’’, nurturing 
care, which is key to early childhood devel-
opment, consists of a core set of interrelated 
components, including— 
(A) behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge 
about caregiving, including health, hygiene 
care, and feeding; 
(B) stimulation, such as talking, singing, 
and playing; 
(C) responsiveness, such as early bonding, 
secure attachment, trust, and sensitive com-
munication; and 
(D) safety, including routines, protection 
from violence, abuse, neglect, harm, and en-
vironmental pollution. 
(6) According to a 2016 report published in 
The Lancet entitled ‘‘Advancing Early Child-
hood 
Development: 
From 
Science 
to 
Scale’’— 
(A) nurturing care from parents, relatives, 
and other caregivers and services are forma-
tive experiences for young children; 
(B) programs promoting nurturing care can 
improve early childhood development out-
comes; and 
(C) children who do not receive nurturing 
care display negative development outcomes, 
such as greater sensitivity to the effects of 
stress or behavioral problems, especially 
children who do not receive nurturing care 
before their second birthday. 
(7) According to the ‘‘Advancing Protec-
tion and Care for Children in Adversity 2019– 
2023: A U.S. Government Strategy for Inter-
national Assistance’’, children who live with-
out protective family care, in abusive house-
holds, on the streets, or in institutions, or 
who are trafficked, are participating in 
armed groups, or are being exploited for 
their labor are more likely to be exposed to 
violence, exploitation, abuse, and neglect. 
(8) According to a 2017 UNICEF report enti-
tled ‘‘Early Moments Matter for every 
child’’, violence, abuse, neglect, and trau-
matic experiences produce toxic stress that 
limits neural connectivity in developing 
brains. 
(9) According to a 2014 working paper from 
the National Scientific Council on the Devel-
oping Child at Harvard University entitled 
‘‘Excessive Stress Disrupts the Architecture 
of the Developing Brain’’— 
(A) situations that produce toxic stress in-
crease the production of cortisol in a child’s 
brain, which disrupts its healthy develop-
ment; and 
(B) chronic stress can potentially affect 
the expression of genes that regulate the 
stress response across the life course. 
(10) According to a 2018 article in the North 
Carolina Medical Journal entitled ‘‘Adverse 
Childhood Experiences (ACEs): An Important 
Element of a Comprehensive Approach to the 
Opioid Crisis’’, adverse childhood experiences 
(ACEs) are traumatic or stressful experi-
ences, including emotional, physical, or sex-
ual abuse, domestic violence, household sub-
stance abuse, household mental illness, pa-
rental separation or divorce, and the incar-
ceration of a household family member. 
(11) According to a 2016 report in Develop-
ment and Psychopathology entitled ‘‘Child-
hood Adversity and Epigenetic Regulation of 
Glucocorticoid Signaling Genes: Associa-
tions in Children and Adults’’— 
(A) children and adults are at risk of devel-
oping psychiatric disorders and other med-
ical conditions if they have had an adverse 
childhood experience; and 
(B) adults who have had numerous ACEs 
die nearly 20 years earlier, on average, than 
adults who have not had numerous ACEs. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the United States Government should 
continue efforts to reduce child mortality 
rates and increase attention on prevention 
efforts and early childhood development pro-
grams;

(2) investments in early childhood develop-
ment ensure healthy and well-developed fu-
ture generations that contribute to a coun-
try’s stability, security and economic pros-
perity; 
(3) efforts to provide training and edu-
cation on nurturing care could result in im-
proved early childhood development out-
comes and support healthy brain develop-
ment; and 
(4) integration and cross-sector coordina-
tion of early childhood development pro-
grams is critical to ensure the efficiency, ef-
fectiveness, and continued implementation 
of such programs.

SEC. 5. SPECIAL ADVISOR FOR ASSISTANCE TO 
ORPHANS AND VULNERABLE CHIL-
DREN. 
Section 135(e)(2) of the Foreign Assistance 
Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2152f(e)(2)) is amended— 
(1) by amending subparagraph (A) to read 
as follows: 
‘‘(A) Coordinate assistance to orphans and 
other vulnerable children among the rel-
evant Executive branch agencies and offi-
cials.’’; and 
(2) in subparagraph (B), by striking ‘‘the 
various offices, bureaus, and field missions 
within the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development’’ and inserting ‘‘the 
relevant Executive branch agencies and offi-
cials’’. 
SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
Nothing in the amendments made by this 
Act may be construed to restrict or abrogate 
any other authorization for United States 
Agency for International Development ac-
tivities or programs. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CASTRO) and the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CASTRO). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Chair, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude in the RECORD extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 4864. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
As I begin, I express deep gratitude 
to Chairman ENGEL for his strong and 
steady leadership on the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee and specifically, 
with respect to this bill, for working 
with me to move important legislation 
through the committee and the Con-
gress. 
I also thank Representative BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK for working with me on 
this legislation that enjoys wide bipar-
tisan support in both the House and the 
Senate. 
Finally, I recognize USAID as the 
country’s lead agency to provide hu-
manitarian assistance and lead in 
international development. The tire-
less efforts of its staff helped millions 
of vulnerable people every year and ad-
vanced core United States interests. 
The Global Child Thrive Act shows 
that the leadership in Congress is con-
cerned about future generations in de-
veloping countries, and we are con-
cerned that they be empowered to sur-
vive and succeed. 
I would like to speak to the impor-
tance of this bill that we are consid-
ering here today in the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Over 250 million children worldwide 
are at risk of stunted growth and dam-
age to their brains due to the long-last-
ing impacts of poverty, conflict, and 
displacement. Research indicates that 
poor health, stress, and lack of learn-
ing impairs a child’s growth and devel-
opment, with lifelong negative effects. 
The Global Child Thrive Act is de-
signed to reduce the devastating effects 
of poverty through early childhood de-
velopment programming. Early child-
hood development, or ECD, provides for 
the care and nurturing that restores a 
child’s prospects for success in the fu-
ture. ECD interventions build a brain 
architecture 
that 
is 
necessary 
for 
growth through reading, singing, play 
activities with shape and color, and re-
sponsive interaction. 
The benefits of ECD are particularly 
critical during this coronavirus pan-
demic when children face severe dis-
ruptions in development. Hundreds of 
thousands of children have already lost 
a family member, and quarantines and 
school closures have led to isolation 
and increased child protection con-
cerns. 
With so much at stake, we need to 
take action now. 
This bill is not just my bill or a 
Democratic bill, but a bipartisan bill 
that has garnered widespread support 
because saving children’s lives is not a 
partisan measure but a human impera-
tive. 
The Global Child Thrive Act shows 
that the United States is there for the 
world’s most vulnerable and precious 
possession, its children. It also shows 
that we are serious about combating 
poverty as one of the greatest scourges 
that affects human dignity. 
This leadership is critical because 
we, as a nation, need to demonstrate to 
the world that we are still the North 
Star 
of 
freedom, 
democracy, 
and 
human rights. 
We need to show that the world can 
trust and follow our lead in welcoming 
those 
seeking 
refuge 
and 
helping 
marginalized populations around the 
world who just want the chance not 
only to survive but to thrive. 
I have spoken about the need to build 
up what I call an infrastructure of di-
plomacy. The work of USAID and 
international development, and our 
partnerships with NGOs that imple-
ment these programs, is an important 
component of that infrastructure that 
enables our Nation’s leadership on the 
world’s stage. 
Foreign affairs issues need the atten-
tion of our Nation because the truth is, 
foreign affairs touches all aspects of 
our lives, including national security, 
personal health, and access to essential 
goods. It determines how we trust and 
look at the goodness of our neighbors, 
not only across borders but across our 
own streets. 
This is a good measure. It has bipar-
tisan support, and I hope that my col-
leagues will support it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive 
CASTRO
and 
Representative 
FITZPATRICK for their leading efforts on 
the Global Child Thrive Act, which we 
are considering here today. 
Although children have not faced as 
many 
direct 
health 
effects 
from 
COVID–19, the follow-on effects of the 
pandemic 
endanger 
the 
welfare 
of 
countless vulnerable children around 
the world. Over the summer, the U.N. 
estimated that an additional 10,000 
children are dying every month due to 
hunger caused by COVID–19. 
This pandemic is also reversing hard- 
fought gains we have made in com-
bating other diseases, increasing access 
to education, and reducing extreme 
poverty. 
This legislation supports efforts to 
integrate early childhood development 
into existing interventions on nutri-
tion, education, maternal health, and 
water, sanitation, and hygiene. 
It also expands the role of the Special 
Advisor for Assistance to Orphans and 
Vulnerable Children in coordinating 
U.S. assistance and improving inter-
agency cooperation. 
This bill, in short, Madam Speaker, 
protects the most vulnerable in our so-
ciety, our children, from hunger and 
disease, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK), the 
coauthor of the bill. An esteemed mem-
ber of the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs, the gentleman, again, working 
with my good friend, Congressman 
CASTRO, has brought this measure for-
ward today. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Ranking Member MCCAUL for 
yielding me time to speak on the Glob-
al Child Thrive Act. 
Madam Speaker, as a lifelong FBI 
special agent, one of my greatest con-
cerns has always been the welfare of 
children, not just children in the 
United States, but children across the 
globe. 
Last year, as the ranking member in-
dicated, I partnered with my colleague, 
Congressman 
CASTRO, 
to 
introduce 
H.R. 4864, the Global Child Thrive Act. 
This legislation was written to support 
young 
children 
and 
their 
families 
across the globe. 
Our bill has wide bipartisan and bi-
cameral support. Our bill passed unani-
mously out of the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee in December. We have 
over 60 bipartisan cosponsors. It is also 
supported by over 50 civil society 
groups working in child and inter-
national development. 
Madam Speaker, I want to particu-
larly thank Catholic Relief Services, 
whose constituent advocates in my 
home district have championed these 
issues. 
Madam Speaker, the Global Child 
Thrive Act would update our foreign

aid programs to increase their effec-
tiveness and multiply developmental 
outcomes for young children. Cur-
rently, less than 1 percent of our U.S. 
budget goes towards international aid 
programs, so it is critical that those 
limited dollars do as much good as pos-
sible. 
Today, the need for the enactment of 
our bill into law is more pressing than 
ever, as experts agree that the sec-
ondary impacts of COVID–19, such as 
increased food insecurity, malnutri-
tion, and violence, will fall most heav-
ily on vulnerable children. The Global 
Child Thrive Act will support the most 
vulnerable children to withstand the 
secondary impacts of the coronavirus, 
as well as future deadly pandemics. 
Moreover, this act is crucial, since 
children around the globe are continu-
ously affected by widespread poverty 
and the lack of adequate childcare. Ac-
cording to UNICEF, extreme poverty in 
low- and middle-income countries is 
the reason why 250 million children 5 
years old and younger may not achieve 
their full developmental potential. 
Moreover, UNICEF reports that at 
least ‘‘75 million children under age 
five live in areas affected by conflict.’’ 
Conflict increases a child’s ‘‘risk of 
toxic stress’’ and ‘‘can inhibit brain 
cell connections.’’ 
Finally, Madam Speaker, I thank 
Congressman CASTRO for his biparti-
sanship and his hard work on this leg-
islation. I also thank Chairman ENGEL 
and Ranking Member MCCAUL, all fine 
colleagues of mine, for their coopera-
tion and support on our legislation. 
As we all know, Madam Speaker, fo-
cusing on children is focusing on our 
future, and I urge all of my colleagues, 
Democrat and Republican, to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 4864, the Global Child 
Thrive Act. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. I am prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my good 
friend, BRIAN FITZPATRICK, for his work 
in the FBI. I thought it was very com-
pelling, the testimony about putting 
children’s lives as the highest priority 
as he served as a very distinguished 
special agent in the Bureau and now 
serves in this Congress. I think George-
town University ranked him as the 
most bipartisan Member of this body, 
of the House. I take pride in being on 
the 
top 
of 
the 
list, 
but 
Mr. 
FITZPATRICK’s service in this House has 
been to issues of importance to Ameri-
cans. 
Most Americans don’t want us bick-
ering. Most Americans want us work-
ing across the aisle to get good things 
done for the people of this country. The 
gentleman 
has 
demonstrated 
that 
every day I have witnessed him in of-
fice in this Congress and since he has 
served in office. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
man CASTRO for his leadership. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, being a 
Catholic myself, I do want to thank 
Catholic Relief Services and the devel-
opment community for their work on 
this bill, working so hard to get to this 
point where we are now on the floor of 
the House of Representatives in the 
United States Congress getting ready 
to pass such an important bill that will 
save so many children’s lives. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself as much time 
as I may consume. 
It is now up to us to pass this bill 
that is before us today and to send a 
strong signal to the Senate that pass-
ing the Global Child Thrive Act into 
law is urgent. 
I also, Madam Speaker, as folks have 
said, want to thank Catholic Relief 
Services for all of their work and the 
work of their members and different 
chapters throughout the country in 
helping to shepherd this bill. 
As the world toils through a dev-
astating pandemic, now more than 
ever, we must keep child welfare and 
the elimination of poverty front and 
center if we are to lead our country 
and the world to a stronger, healthier, 
and more resilient condition. We must 
stand united and be the acting con-
science of the country. It is our job to 
do so. 
I, therefore, Madam Speaker, urge 
my colleagues in the House to support 
this measure so we can get it to the 
President’s desk and have it signed 
into law. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CAS-
TRO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 4864, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
LEVERAGING INFORMATION ON 
FOREIGN TRAFFICKERS ACT 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 5664) to amend 
the Trafficking Victims Protection Act 
of 2000 to ensure adequate time for the 
preparation of the annual Trafficking 
in Persons Report, require the timely 
provision of information to the Office 
to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in 
Persons and the Bureau of Diplomatic 
Security of the Department of State 
regarding the number and location of 
visa denials based, in whole or in part, 
on grounds related to human traf-
ficking, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5664 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Leveraging 
Information on Foreign Traffickers Act’’ or

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the annual Trafficking In Persons Re-
port prepared by the Department of State 
pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protec-
tion Act of 2000 (the ‘‘TIP Report’’) remains 
one of the most comprehensive, timely, and 
important sources of information on human 
trafficking in the world, and currently in-
cludes 187 individual country narratives; 
(2) in January 2019, the statute mandating 
the TIP Report was amended to require that 
each report must cover efforts and activities 
occurring within the period from April 1 of 
the prior year through March 31 of the cur-
rent year, which necessarily requires the col-
lection and transmission of information 
after March 31; 
(3) ensuring that the Department of State 
has adequate time to receive, analyze, and 
incorporate trafficking-related information 
into its annual Trafficking In Persons Re-
port is important to the quality and com-
prehensiveness of that report; 
(4) information regarding prevalence and 
patterns of human trafficking is important 
for understanding the scourge of modern 
slavery and making effective decisions about 
where and how to combat it; and 
(5) United States officials responsible for 
monitoring and combating trafficking in 
persons around the world should receive 
available information regarding where and 
how often United States diplomatic and con-
sular officials encounter persons who are re-
sponsible for, or who knowingly benefit 
from, severe forms of trafficking in persons. 
SEC. 3. ANNUAL DEADLINE FOR TRAFFICKING IN

tual performance of the duties of the Coun-
cil.’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CASTRO) and the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each will

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CASTRO). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 5664. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, human trafficking, 
better termed modern-day slavery, has 
grown into a sprawling and complex 
billion-dollar criminal enterprise. An 
estimated 25 million people are cur-
rently victims of trafficking, having 
been forced into abusive situations in-
volving forced labor, sex exploitation, 
and involuntary domestic servitude. 
The House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee has a long history of con-
fronting modern-day slavery, and the 
LIFT Act continues that legacy for 
this committee. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my good 
friend and the ranking member of the 
committee, Mr. MCCAUL, for authoring 
this bill, and Mr. SMITH for his leader-
ship on this issue for over two decades. 
In 2000, President Clinton signed into 
law the Victims of Trafficking and Vio-
lence Prevention Act, now hailed as 
the most comprehensive legislation on 
human trafficking to date. That land-
mark piece of legislation came out of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee and was 
authored 
by 
our 
colleague, 
CHRIS 
SMITH. 
That legislation gave the State De-
partment the responsibility of drafting 
the annual Trafficking Report, which 
has been a critical resource in pushing 
countries to take action to combat 
human trafficking. 
The bill before us ensures that the 
State Department has adequate time 
to prepare the annual Trafficking Re-
port. 
It 
streamlines 
data 
sharing 
among bureaus on visa denials for 
human traffickers and engages traf-
ficking survivors in our policymaking 
process. 
We must continue to fight modern- 
day slavery and work to enact legisla-
tion that brings us to a brighter future 
free of this horrific injustice. Today’s 
measure is a step in that direction, and 
I hope all of my colleagues, Republican 
and Democrat, will join me in sup-
porting it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, July 30, 2020. 
Hon. ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN ENGEL: This is to advise 
you that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has now had an opportunity to review the 
provisions in H.R. 5664, the LIFT Act, that 
fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appre-
ciate your consulting with us on those provi-
sions. The Judiciary Committee has no ob-
jection to your including them in the bill for 
consideration on the House floor, and to ex-
pedite that consideration is willing to waive 
sequential referral, with the understanding 
that we do not thereby waive any future ju-
risdictional claim over those provisions or 
their subject matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely,

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
Washington, DC, July 31, 2020. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: I am writing to 
you concerning H.R. 5664, the LIFT Act. I ap-
preciate your willingness to work coopera-
tively on this legislation. 
I acknowledge that provisions of the bill 
fall within the jurisdiction of the House 
Committee on the Judiciary under House 
Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo 
action on H.R. 5664 to expedite floor consid-
eration. I further acknowledge that the inac-
tion of your Committee with respect to the 
bill does not waive any future jurisdictional 
claim over the matters contained in the bill 
that fall within your jurisdiction. I will also 
support the appointment of Committee on 
the Judiciary conferees during any House- 
Senate conference convened on this legisla-
tion. 
Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of 
letters is included in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill. 
Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, the trafficking of 
people, whether for sexual exploitation 
or forced labor, is an affront to human 
dignity. It is, as the gentleman from 
Texas said, a modern-day form of slav-
ery that oppresses nearly 25 million 
people around the world, including

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4676 
September 22, 2020 
right here in the United States and in 
my home State of Texas. 
A few years ago, a mother from Katy, 
Texas, in my district, reached out to 
me with one request: ‘‘Please help me 
bring my daughter home, my daughter, 
Courtney.’’ 
Courtney was a junior in high school. 
She was on the swim team and at-
tended 
church 
regularly. 
She 
was 
groomed, unfortunately, by traffickers. 
She was groomed at her high school. 
Many parents think, ‘‘This can’t hap-
pen to my child,’’ and not in suburbia 
in Houston, but just ask Courtney’s 
family that question. 
The traffickers embedded themselves 
in the high school. They operated 
through Courtney’s classmates. Like 
leeches, they latched onto Courtney’s 
vulnerabilities, and they used them 
against her. It was then that she was 
swept up into this nightmare and used 
like property. 
We may expect things like this out of 
foreign countries, but not in our back-
yards. 
Thankfully, after several months of 
work with law enforcement, Courtney 
returned home to her family. I was 
there when she came home. She had 
battle scars. She had lost so much 
weight. She had just about died. It was 
quite a reunion with a mother and fa-
ther and their daughter who had been 
gone for almost 2 years. 
She now dedicates her time to raising 
awareness and educating others on the 
signs of human trafficking. Her work 
earned her a spot on the U.S. Advisory 
Council on Human Trafficking. I can-
not be more proud of her work and her 
inspiration to me and her contribu-
tions to the council. 
It is because of survivors like Court-
ney and the countless others that 
Chairman ENGEL and I introduced the 
LIFT Act to continue our committee’s 
20-year 
commitment 
to 
combating 
human trafficking. 
b 1330 
The LIFT Act will help our law en-
forcement officers and diplomatic offi-
cials communicate better so we can 
then root out more human traffickers 
and bring them to justice. 
I was surprised to find out that when 
someone applies for a visa at an em-
bassy or a consulate and they are de-
nied on human trafficking grounds, 
that that information is not currently 
given to our law enforcement officers, 
to the FBI. 
The LIFT Act also gives a voice to 
survivors of human trafficking so that 
brave people like Courtney will remain 
a central part of the policy discussion. 
By reauthorizing the survivor-led 
U.S. Advisory Council on Human Traf-
ficking through 2025, which is what this 
bill does, we are empowering survivors 
and sharpening our tools to counter 
traffickers. 
I am very grateful for the support 
this bill has received from the Alliance 
to End Slavery and Trafficking, and 
the 
U.S. 
Conference 
of 
Catholic 
Bishops. 
Madam Speaker, the evil of slavery 
was abolished in this country many 
years ago. We are still living up to the 
principles of our Founding Fathers 
that all men are created equal. We are 
still bringing this country to racial and 
social justice. It is still something we 
strive for. We must end this form of 
human slavery today, and this bill is a 
start. 
We have a lot more work to do but 
the numbers are very perplexing. In 
fact, the numbers are very disturbing, 
the numbers of young children, both 
little girls and boys, who are swept up 
into this awful system. 
I have worked most of my life as a 
Federal prosecutor on these issues and 
now in Congress. I put the worst of the 
worst behind bars for these crimes 
where they deserve to spend a very 
long time in our prison system. They 
are the lowest of the low. 
So with this bill today, we renew and 
strengthen our commitment to stand 
with the exploited and the children 
against their oppressors. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. YOHO). 
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to commend Chairmen MCCAUL, 
ENGEL, and my colleague Mr. CASTRO 
for bringing up this strong bipartisan 
bill. 
Human trafficking is an issue which 
is still alive and well today, unfortu-
nately. It is modern-day slavery. 
The International Labour Organiza-
tion estimates that there are 40.3 mil-
lion 
victims 
of 
human 
trafficking 
worldwide today. The global human 
trafficking market is estimated to be a 
$150 billion per year industry, and I 
hate to call it an industry. The profits 
from these nefarious and heinous acts 
only go to fund corrupt governments 
and organizations to rain more terror, 
pain, organ harvesting, and suffering 
on the world’s most vulnerable popu-
lations. 
As of 2020, the Counter Trafficking 
Data 
Collaborative 
shows 
globally 
108,613 individual cases of human traf-
ficking; 164 countries of exploitation; 
and 175 nationalities. 
The LIFT Act will ensure adequate 
time for preparation of the State De-
partment’s annual Trafficking in Per-
sons Report. It will also require timely 
provisions on information to the State 
Department on the number and loca-
tion of visa denials based wholly or 
partially on grounds related to human 
trafficking. 
One of the greatest challenges in de-
veloping targeted counter-traffic re-
sponses and measuring their impact is 
the lack of reliable, high-quality data 
related to the scale of human traf-
ficking and the profile of the victims. 
The LIFT Act will help to provide 
this global data on human trafficking 
through its insurance of thorough prep-
aration of the State Department’s 
Trafficking in Persons Report. In these 
times of hyper-partisanship, combating 
human 
trafficking 
is 
a 
worldwide 
scourge on societies that we should, we 
can, and we do tackle in a bipartisan 
fashion here. 
In order to combat human traf-
ficking, we must all continue to work 
together. 
I will, and I encourage all others to 
support the LIFT Act. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in 2002, I formed the 
Internet Crimes Against Children unit 
in the attorney general’s office in the 
State of Texas to stop internet traf-
ficking and stop the exploitation of 
children online. 
Since that day, we have put thou-
sands behind bars. This is a worldwide 
scourge. It happens on an international 
level. 
But what is, again, most disturbing, 
is it is happening now in our back-
yards. It is happening in suburbia 
America. 
A case like Courtney’s is so compel-
ling because you never thought it 
would be possible in a town like Katy, 
Texas, but it happens, and it is hap-
pening all over this Nation. The num-
bers from the FBI are revealing and it 
is an industry. It is a sick industry 
that is run by businessmen; that is run 
by lawyers, an industry that exploits 
our children. 
I have talked to many veterans with 
PTSD, but I can’t imagine the post- 
traumatic stress of a victim of human 
trafficking who has been violated over 
and over and over again, offending the 
deepest ounce of human dignity where 
there is no dignity left, where they had 
to put their mind in such a place—al-
most like Stockholm syndrome—where 
they can survive the horrors that they 
are living in day in and day out. 
Madam Speaker, this has to stop. 
This bill will help, but this Congress 
and the next Congress, we really need 
to ramp up our efforts to take this 
issue square on, to put these monsters 
out of their business and say they are 
closed forever, and to put them behind 
bars for a very, very long time. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank many in my district who have 
worked hard on this issue: Houston 20’s 
Jenn Hohman, and Austin 20’s Lisa 
Knapp. These women are warriors for 
the cause against human trafficking. I 
also want to thank the Harris County 
human trafficking task force for their 
great work on this effort. They are 
truly one of the models for the Nation. 
When the officials from Homeland 
Security came down from the Blue 
Campaign, they told me this is one of 
the most effective operations we have 
seen in the United States, and it is a 
model for the Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4677 
September 22, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this meaningful, 
necessary legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume for the purpose of clos-
ing. 
Combating human trafficking is a 
global challenge, and we are proud of 
the State Department’s critical role in 
that effort. This legislation will ensure 
that the Department has the tools and 
resources necessary to counter these 
heinous human rights abuses. 
I would like to thank the ranking 
member, Mr. MCCAUL, for his work on 
this important issue. This is a strong 
bill that I am pleased to support, and I 
urge my colleagues, Democrat and Re-
publican, to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. CAS-
TRO) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 5664, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

Veterans Affairs. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

H.R. 3010 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
3010. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 3010 establishes 
an inclusive VA mission statement or 
motto as follows: ‘‘To fulfill President 
Lincoln’s promise to care for those 
‘who shall have borne the battle’ and 
for their families, caregivers, and sur-
vivors.’’ Congresswoman RICE
intro-
duced this bill to establish a model at 
VA that includes all who VA is man-
dated to serve. 
Since its creation in 1861, only one 
woman, Dr. Mary Walker, has received 
the Medal of Honor. Her citation recog-
nized her for devoting ‘‘herself with 
much patriotic zeal to the sick and 
wounded soldiers, both in the field and 
in hospitals, to the detriment of her 
own health,’’ and enduring ‘‘hardships 
as a prisoner of war.’’ 
She received the Medal of Honor in 
1866 for her service to the U.S. Army 
throughout the American Civil War. 
The current VA mission statement, a 
line from President Lincoln’s second 
inaugural address delivered in 1865, 
uses only male pronouns and excludes 
women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and queer veterans, as 
well as the diversity of their families, 
caregivers and survivors. 
For years, this committee has heard 
from veterans and their supporters 
that both the gender-exclusive motto 
and the VA’s refusal to changes it are 
reflective of a culture that does not 
prioritize or value them. 
b 1345 
The current model was unilaterally 
selected by the Administrator of what 
was then the Veterans Administration 
in 1959. 
By passing this bill to create a new 
mission 
statement, 
we 
are 
dem-
onstrating the will of the American 
people for VA’s motto to be inclusive. 
In the original context, President Lin-
coln expressed an intent of inclusion 
and an obligation to care for all who 
had endured conflict. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 3010 both hon-
ors the original spirit of President Lin-
coln’s words while reflecting the full 
scope of VA’s mission and whom they 
must serve. As Dr. Mary Walker said: 
‘‘Let the generations know that women 
in uniform also guaranteed their free-
dom.’’ 
I, again, thank Miss RICE from the 
State of New York for sponsoring this 
bill and for her tireless work on behalf 
of America’s veterans, their families, 
caregivers, and survivors. 
I thank Dr. ROE and the minority 
Members who made bringing this bill 
to the floor a fully bipartisan effort, 
and I hope the Senate will take this on 
swiftly so that it will pass into law be-
fore the end of the 116th Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 3010, the Honoring All Vet-
erans Act, which is sponsored by my 
friend, Congresswoman KATHLEEN RICE 
from New York. 
This bill would establish a mission 
statement in the statute for the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs. That 
mission statement would read: ‘‘To ful-
fill President Lincoln’s promise to care 
for those ‘who shall have borne the bat-
tle’ and for their families, caregivers, 
and survivors.’’ 
This is in homage to President Lin-
coln’s immortal words in his second in-
augural address, which state, in full: 
‘‘With malice toward none; with char-
ity for all; with firmness in the right, 
as God gives us to see the right, let us 
strive on to finish the work we are in; 
to bind up the Nation’s wounds; to care 
for him who shall have borne the bat-
tle, and for his widow, and his orphan,

to do all which may achieve and cher-
ish a just and lasting peace among our-
selves and with all nations.’’ 
Those words, which were delivered in 
1865, remain some of the most impor-
tant in our country’s history, and they 
continue to reverberate even now. 
For one, they inspired the creation of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs as 
we know it. That is why VA has been 
using them as a motto since 1959. How-
ever, in the last several years, veterans 
service organizations and others have 
rightly noted that the use of the male 
pronoun in President Lincoln’s state-
ment can inadvertently ostracize the 
increasing number of women in the 
military and veteran communities. 
Women are the fastest growing co-
hort of servicemembers and veterans. 
They play critical roles in the battle-
field and in the VA healthcare system 
where their numbers have tripled in 
the last two decades alone. VA has 
made great strides in the last few years 
with respect to improving care for 
women and, as a result, women vet-
erans now express greater trust in VA 
than ever before. 
Enacting the Honoring All Veterans 
Act would go one step further in mak-
ing VA a more inclusive and welcoming 
place of care for them and future gen-
erations of veterans, whoever they may 
be, while preserving in statute the spir-
it of President Lincoln’s charge to for-
ever honor and care for those who have 
served. 
The bill would also be more inclusive 
of many caregivers, survivors, and fam-
ily members of veterans who are vi-
tally important sources of ongoing love 
and support of veterans in need across 
the country. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate Con-
gresswoman RICE’s leadership on this 
bill. I am proud to sponsor it and sup-
port it today, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Miss RICE), who is my 
good friend and who is the sponsor of 
H.R. 3010. 
Miss RICE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
bipartisan bill, the Honoring All Vet-
erans Act. 
This bill would finally require the 
Department of Veterans Affairs to re-
place its outdated motto with a more 
inclusive statement. The words of the 
original motto would be updated to 
read: ‘‘To fulfill President Lincoln’s 
promise to care for those ‘who shall 
have borne the battle’ and for their 
families, caregivers, and survivors.’’ 
For far too long, the VA’s gender-ex-
clusive motto hasn’t properly acknowl-
edged the service of women and LGBT 
veterans. This is simply wrong, and it 
is long overdue that we change it. 
Women 
and 
LGBT 
servicemembers 
have sacrificed so much for our coun-
try. They have always answered the 
call of duty, and they should know that 
we are just as grateful for their service 
and sacrifice as we are for anyone who 
serves this country. 
That is why we must make this 
change. We need a VA motto that prop-
erly recognizes and honors the service 
of all veterans, regardless of their gen-
der or sexual orientation. 
Changing the motto won’t solve 
every issue facing women and LGBT 
veterans, of course, but it is a start, 
and it is the right thing to do. It would 
say in no uncertain terms that all vet-
erans are seen equally in the eyes of 
the agency that exists solely to serve 
them. 
I want to thank Chairman TAKANO 
for his support for me getting this bill 
to where it is today. And it is simply 
that, as Chairman TAKANO
said, we 
would not be here if it were not for the 
ranking member, Dr. ROE. I want to 
thank him personally so much for sup-
porting this bill and for helping to 
bring it to the floor today. 
I also want to thank my Republican 
colead, Representative BRIAN
MAST, 
the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of 
America, and all the veterans whom I 
have heard from in support of this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote for the Honoring All 
Veterans Act today. It is time every 
veteran who served our country re-
ceives the respect and recognition they 
deserve. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I appre-
ciate the opportunity to be here, and I 
appreciate Congresswoman RICE’s and 
the chairman’s leadership on this. 
It seems to me it is past time to do 
this. It is the right thing to do. I en-
courage my colleagues to support that, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank H.R. 3010’s sponsor, Representa-
tive KATHLEEN RICE from New York. It 
is long past due for us to recognize the 
contributions of all veterans, regard-
less of gender, sexual orientation, or 
gender identity. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3010, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3010. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

vise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 3908,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4908, as amended, the Native 
American PACT Act. 
The Federal Government has a legal 
and moral obligation to uphold its 
treaty obligations to Tribal nations, 
which 
include 
the 
provision 
of 
healthcare. Our responsibility to en-
sure care is compounded when Amer-
ican Indians and Alaska Natives serve 
this country in uniform. 
While largely provided by the Indian 
Health Service and Tribal Health Pro-
grams, the healthcare obligations of 
the United States do not start and stop

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4679 
September 22, 2020 
with one agency. For decades, VA has 
not recognized the unique status of Na-
tive veterans and has charged them 
copays for care provided at VA. 
For far too many Native Americans, 
particularly those in rural areas, the 
copay burden is a barrier to care. These 
veterans, who may be unable to access 
specialty care from their Tribal health 
systems, are then unable to access VA 
due to cost. 
Eliminating the copay burden is a 
step toward upholding the treaties be-
tween the United States and Tribal na-
tions while also bringing immediate re-
lief to veterans unable to access care 
during these distressing times. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Congressman GALLEGO for his steadfast 
leadership on this issue. I encourage all 
of my colleagues to support H.R. 4908, 
as amended, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4908, the Native American 
Veteran Parity in Access to Care 
Today Act, or PACT Act. 
The care that the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs provides to veterans for 
conditions that are related to military 
service are always provided at no cost 
to the veteran. Veterans being cared 
for by VA for conditions that are unre-
lated to their military service may be 
charged a copayment to offset the cost 
of care and encourage appropriate use 
of the VA healthcare system. 
According to the Government Ac-
countability Office and the National 
Council of American Indians, approxi-
mately one-third of American Indian 
and 
Alaska 
Native 
veterans 
were 
charged copayments from VA in fiscal 
year 2017. Those copayments averaged 
just under $300 per veteran. 
However, almost a century ago, Con-
gress passed the Snyder Act, which 
guaranteed healthcare to Native Amer-
icans free of charge. In recognition of 
that, the Native American PACT Act 
would prohibit VA from charging co-
payments to Native American veterans 
regardless of whether the care they re-
ceive from the VA is for a service-con-
nected condition or not. 
There is no ethnic group that volun-
teers to defend the United States in 
uniform at a higher rate than Native 
Americans whose history of service to 
this country dates back to the Revolu-
tionary War. This bill would increase 
access to care for those brave veterans 
and create parity between the care pro-
vided to them through the VA, the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services, and the Indian Health Serv-
ice. It would also uphold the United 
States 
Government’s 
longstanding 
trust and treaty responsibilities to the 
Native American community. 
The Native American PACT Act is 
sponsored by my colleague and fellow 
veteran, Congressman RUBEN GALLEGO 
from Arizona. I am glad to stand with 
him in support of its passage today. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all of 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I too 
ask all of my colleagues to join me in 
passing H.R. 4908, as amended, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4908, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

of Veterans Affairs to develop and sub-
mit to Congress a plan to address the 
material weakness of the Department

Mr. TAKANO. I am checking. I do

(A) the repeated material weakness of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs; and

nancial Officer of the Department to carry

Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
6589. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 6589, the CFO Authority and Col-
laboration Act of 2020, which addresses 
the sometimes arcane but also very im-
portant need for strong financial man-
agement and accountability at the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
each 
year, 
VA 
spends billions of dollars in support of 
our Nation’s veterans. Taxpayers de-
serve to know that each dollar is spent 
wisely and that each dollar is properly 
accounted for in order to avoid waste, 
fraud, and abuse. 
Madam Speaker, the VA inspector 
general has determined what is called a 
‘‘material weakness’’ in how the Office 
of the Chief Financial Officer is struc-
tured. This was a topic examined dur-
ing hearings and through oversight by 
our Subcommittee on Oversight and In-
vestigations. 
Mrs. LEE’s legislation requires a 
small but important fix to ensure 
strong 
financial 
accountability. 
I 
thank Mrs. LEE for sponsoring this bi-
partisan legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 6589. 
Madam Speaker, I wish to, at this 
point, withdraw the motion.

tion is withdrawn.

Health Administration, the chief financial offi-
cer of the Office of Community Care within the

Networks within the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration; 
(ii) the chief financial officer of the Veterans 
Benefits Administration and all chief financial 
officers of organizational subdivisions rep-
resenting business lines within the Veterans 
Benefits Administration; 
(iii) the chief financial officer of the National 
Cemetery Administration; and 
(iv) the chief financial officer of the Office of 
Information and Technology; and 
(B) does not include the Inspector General. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that the comments 
that I made on my previous motion 
that I withdrew be inserted in the 
RECORD in conjunction with my motion 
to pass H.R. 6589, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 6589, the VA Chief Finan-
cial Officer Authority and Collabora-
tion Act. 
Each year, the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs manages to pass its finan-
cial statement audit despite a number 
of persistent material weaknesses in 
what appears to be a stalemate. VA 
never quite loses its unqualified audit 
opinion but never materially improves 
either. We should expect more, espe-
cially with VA’s budget approaching 
$250 billion and its total liabilities 
reaching near $3.3 trillion. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman SUSIE LEE from Nevada and 
General JACK BERGMAN from Michigan 
for sponsoring this bill to address the 
root cause of the problem, the VA’s 
Chief Financial Officer’s lack of oper-
ational authority over the dozens of 
lower level chief financial officers 
throughout VA. 
This bill would direct VA to develop 
a detailed action plan to resolve mate-
rial weaknesses and require VA’s Chief 
Financial Officer to attest to the De-
partment’s financial projections and 
internal controls in VA’s annual budg-
et submission. 
It would also strengthen VA’s Chief 
Financial Officer’s operational author-
ity by involving them or their designee 
in the hiring and performance evalua-
tions of subordinate chief financial of-
ficers. 
All of these reforms are consistent 
with the Chief Financial Officer Act of 
1990. 
I support this legislation because it 
is a carefully crafted solution to an old 
problem with escalating consequences. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. LEE and 
Dr. ROE for helping me bring this legis-
lation to the floor. I ask all of my col-
leagues to join me in passing this very 
important piece of legislation, H.R. 
6589. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CLEAVER). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 6589, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to

(H.R. 3228) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to authorize health pro-
fessional trainees to provide treatment 
via telemedicine, and for other pur-
poses, as amended.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
that all Members may have 5 legisla-
tive days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and to insert extraneous 
material on H.R. 3228, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3228, as amended, the VA Mission Tele-
health Clarification Act. 
The John S. McCain III, Daniel K. 
Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA 
Maintaining 
Internal 
Systems 
and 
Strengthening Integrated Outside Net-
works Act of 2018, or the VA MISSION 
Act, as it is more commonly known, 
expanded VA’s ability to provide tele-
health to veterans across State lines. 
The legislation before us builds on 
those 
enhancements 
by 
allowing 
healthcare professionals in training to 
provide tele-healthcare to veterans 
with clinical supervision. 
As we have seen over the course of 
this pandemic, tele-healthcare is be-
coming more and more a staple of 
Americans’ healthcare experience. As 
this virus will be with us for some time 
to come, the value and reliance on tele-
health will continue. It is critical that 
during this time, VA has the authori-
ties necessary to keep veterans healthy 
and safe in their homes. 
This is particularly important for 
our rural and aging veterans whose ac-
cess to in-person care was already a 
challenge. We need to do everything 
possible to ensure veterans’ access to 
safe distant care whenever it is appro-
priate. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
CARTER for his dogged work to see vet-
erans have what they need during this 
time. I encourage all of my colleagues 
to support H.R. 3228, as amended. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3228, the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs Mission Telehealth Clari-
fication Act. 
The VA healthcare system is our 
country’s largest integrated healthcare 
system, with responsibility for deliv-
ering care to approximately 7 million 
veteran patients. The VA healthcare 
system is also the country’s largest 
provider of healthcare education, with 
responsibility for supporting the train-
ing of approximately 45,000 medical and 
dental residents and thousands more 
healthcare professional trainees every 
year. I happened to be one of them 
many years ago. 
The VA Mission Telehealth Clarifica-
tion Act would authorize VA residents 
and trainees to provide care to veteran 
patients virtually using telehealth, re-
gardless of that resident or trainee’s 
State licensure, so long as they are 
working under the clinical supervision 
of a VA healthcare professional. 
While face-to-face visits between pa-
tients and providers are irreplaceable 
in many respects, telehealth is an in-
creasingly important tool in the deliv-
ery of modern healthcare. That was 
true even before the COVID–19 pan-
demic created a skyrocketing demand 
for telehealth services. 
In the MISSION Act passed last Con-
gress, we authorized VA providers to 
provide telehealth across State lines in 
an effort to increase access to tele-
health to veteran patients, particularly 
those in rural or remote areas or for 
those whose travel to a medical facil-
ity is otherwise difficult. However, the 
law inadvertently exempted VA resi-
dents, trainees, and certain others 
from that authority. This bill would fix 
that oversight. 
In doing so, it would further expand 
veteran access to telehealth, which has 
been critical to ensuring continuity of 
care 
throughout 
the 
last 
several 
months. It would also ensure that the 
medical education VA provides to the 
next generation of healthcare profes-
sionals includes valuable training and 
needed experience in the delivery of 
care via telephone, video, and other 
virtual modalities. 
This bill is sponsored by my good 
friend, Congressman BUDDY
CARTER 
from Georgia. I am grateful to him for 
recognizing early on the benefits that a 
well-rounded medical education will 
have on access and quality of care for 
veterans and all Americans and work-
ing so hard to give aspiring providers 
and others working within the VA the 
ability to practice telehealth across 
State lines, within appropriate param-
eters. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), my 
good friend. 
I have had the privilege of visiting 
his beautiful district, and I really ap-
preciate his work on this extremely 
important issue. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the VA Mission Telehealth Clarifica-
tion Act, which I am proud to have in-
troduced. 
H.R. 3228, the VA Mission Telehealth 
Clarification Act, is a simple bill that 
builds on the VA MISSION Act’s his-
toric expansion of the veterans health 
system. 
One of the most significant parts of 
the VA MISSION Act was the author-
ization for the VA to use telehealth 
and provide care across State lines. 
The bill began as the result of a visit I 
had to a VA facility before the current 
pandemic, as they laid out some of the 
issues they were trying to overcome. 
But now with the COVID–19 pandemic, 
we are seeing how extremely beneficial 
these technologies can be for our vet-
erans. 
In fact, the VA Medical Center in 
Charleston, 
South 
Carolina, 
which 
serves part of my district along Geor-
gia’s coast, had an over 200 percent in-
crease in telehealth medical services 
during the pandemic when we spoke in 
May. 
Even more incredibly, the VA an-
nounced it had a 1,000 percent increase 
in telehealth video appointments using 
its VA Video Connect Program during 
the first months of the pandemic. This 
is an extremely important ability for 
the VA to have. However, the law did 
not authorize trainees within the VA 
to use telehealth technologies, only 
practitioners with a full license. 
As telehealth medicine grows in prev-
alence, we need for interns, residents, 
and fellows to gain experience using 
these services, especially considering 
that many of these trainees later go on 
to work as doctors at the VA, bringing 
with them a wealth of experience. 
Rather than depending on doctors to 
learn while on the job, which could 
delay the rollout of care, this bill 
would allow trainees to gain experience 
on telehealth systems while properly 
supervised by credentialed VA staff. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say that 
the bill was further improved through 
the committee process after input from 
my colleagues in the VA. The bill will 
not only allow for trainees to partici-
pate in telehealth, but it will also ex-
pand the ability to practice telemedi-
cine to all appropriately qualified 
healthcare professionals at the VA, fix-
ing the issue once and for all. 
While Congress intended for trainees 
and others to be included from the be-
ginning, the VA’s reading of the law 
did not include them, although they 
have expressed their desire to include 
them in telehealth services.

to our veterans, improving the quality 
and timeliness of their care. 
Again, this is a commonsense bill 
with bipartisan support and has re-
ceived the support from the American 
Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, 
AMVETS, and Paralyzed Veterans of 
America, among others. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), 
my good friend who serves on the Doc-
tors Caucus with me, for bringing this 
important piece of legislation up. 
Mr. Speaker, this pandemic actually 
has done one good thing, and that is to 
advance telehealth. Just to give you 
some scope of this, the VA went from 
tens of thousands of mental health vis-
its—and we know that people have 
been isolated. Certainly, many of our 
elderly have been confined; they can’t 
visit people. They have gone from tens 
of thousands of mental health visits 
per month to hundreds of thousands of 
visits. So we are able to stay in touch 
with patients in need. 
I know in my own medical practice in 
Tennessee, it has been extremely help-
ful for patients to access their physi-
cians through telehealth. I think we 
are going to continue this, and I think 
the next Congress is going to have to 
address how Medicare and Medicaid 
funds these telehealth visits outside 
the VA, it is that important for care. 
If you live in a rural area in rural Ap-
palachia like I do, the only way we are 
going to get specialty care for our pa-
tients in need—and in many cases, in 
our cities—is via telehealth, because 
these specialists are so hard to find and 
there are so few of them. And espe-
cially in cases like neurology and pedi-
atrics, these are very difficult people 
to see. 
So I really am appreciative of this. I 
appreciate Dr. Carter bringing it up, 
and I certainly thank the chairman for 
putting this on the agenda. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to support this, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
ranking member for his comments 
about the VA really being a pioneer in 
this moment, that the expansion of 
tele-mental health, especially, has seen 
a logarithmic increase, and it has im-
plications for Medicare and Medicaid. I 
am hearing from the civilian medical 
sector about the need to follow the 
VA’s example. 
I am very proud of the work the VA 
has done to respond to this pandemic 
moment by making sure that our vet-
erans, no matter where they live, have 
access to medical care through tele-
health and tele-mental health, espe-
cially. 
I want to thank, again, the sponsor of 
this legislation, and I want to urge all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
this important legislation, H.R. 3228, as 
amended. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3228, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
VETERAN’S PROSTATE CANCER 
TREATMENT AND RESEARCH ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 6092) to direct the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs to establish a national 
clinical pathway for prostate cancer, 
access to life-saving extending preci-
sion clinical trials and research, and 
for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6092 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Veteran’s 
Prostate Cancer Treatment and Research 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Prostate cancer is the number one can-
cer diagnosed in the Veterans Health Admin-
istration. 
(2) A 1996 report published by the National 
Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Med-
icine established a link between prostate 
cancer and exposure to herbicides, such as 
Agent Orange. 
(3) It is essential to acknowledge that due 
to these circumstances, certain veterans are 
made aware that they are high-risk individ-
uals when it comes to the potential to de-
velop prostate cancer. 
(4) In being designated as ‘‘high risk’’, it is 
essential that veterans are proactive in seek-
ing earlier preventative clinical services for 
the early detection and successful treatment 
of prostate cancer, whether that be through 
the 
Veterans 
Health 
Administration 
or 
through a community provider. 
(5) Clinical preventative services and ini-
tial detection are some of the most impor-
tant components in the early detection of 
prostate cancer for veterans at high risk of 
prostate cancer. 
(6) For veterans with prostate cancer, in-
cluding prostate cancer that has metasta-
sized, precision oncology, including bio-
marker-driven clinical trials and innova-
tions underway through the Prostate Cancer 
Foundation and Department of Veterans Af-
fairs partnership, represents one of the most 
promising areas of interventions, treat-
ments, and cures for such veterans and their 
families.

(ii) researchers. 
(c) CLINICAL
PATHWAY
DEFINED.—In this 
section, the term ‘‘clinical pathway’’ means 
a health care management tool designed 
around research and evidence-backed prac-
tices that provides direction for the clinical 
care and treatment of a specific episode of a 
condition or ailment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 
6092. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6092, the Veteran’s Prostate Cancer 
Treatment and Research Act. 
The number one cancer diagnosed by 
the Veterans Health Administration is 
prostate cancer. Nearly half a million 
veterans 
are 
currently 
undergoing 
treatment, with disproportionate diag-
noses of this disease impacting Black 
veterans and those exposed to Agent 
Orange. 
This legislation would create a na-
tional clinical pathway and standard-
ized system of care for treatment of 
prostate cancer at all stages. This will 
ensure more widespread early detec-
tion efforts, increase access to clinical 
trials, and create a registry and re-
search program. 
Mr. Speaker, our veterans battle 
prostate cancer at twice the rate of 
their civilian counterparts. A unified 
systems-wide approach that builds on 
the incredible work of the Depart-
ment’s research efforts is essential. 
I want to thank Dr. DUNN for his 
steadfast leadership and his passion on 
this matter. 
Mr. Speaker, I also encourage all of 
my colleagues to support H.R. 6092, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6092, the Veteran’s Prostate 
Cancer Treatment and Research Act. 
This bill is sponsored by my good 
friend and ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Health, Congressman 
NEAL DUNN of Florida. 
Like me, Dr. DUNN is an Army vet-
eran and a physician. During his many 
years in private practice, he helped to 
found the Advanced Urology Institute 
and the Bay Regional Cancer Center, 
where he specialized in treating ad-
vanced prostate cancer. 
Suffice it to say, improving care for 
prostate cancer is a personal one for 
him. It is also a personal one for me. 
A few years ago, when I was chair-
man of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee, I was diagnosed with prostate 
cancer. Early detection and effective 
treatment helped save my life, and I 
know that it will do the same for many 
of my fellow veterans. 
Veterans are diagnosed with prostate 
cancer, as the chairman said, at twice 
the rate of the general population, 
making prostate cancer the most com-
monly diagnosed cancer in male vet-
erans. An estimated one in five male 
veterans is expected to be diagnosed 
with prostate cancer in their lifetime, 
compared to one in nine American 
men, generally. 
The Veteran’s Prostate Cancer Treat-
ment and Research Act would require 
the VA to establish a national clinical 
pathway for prostate cancer and to up-
date that clinical pathway every year 
to reflect the latest and greatest and 
best practices for, and the medical un-
derstanding of, this deadly disease. It 
would also require the VA to establish 
a comprehensive prostate cancer pro-
gram and a national prostate cancer 
registry. 
Together, 
these 
provisions 
would 
make the VA a national leader with re-
spect to prostate cancer. 
Most importantly, it would give vet-
erans with prostate cancer the very 
best chance of making a full recovery 
and going on to lead long, healthy lives 
after their diagnosis. 
Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that the 
House advance this important bill 
today in the final week of Prostate 
Cancer Month. I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting it, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I also 
want to acknowledge the leadership of 
the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. CUNNINGHAM), who worked with 
the subcommittee ranking member, Dr. 
NEAL DUNN. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
CUNNINGHAM), my good friend. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of this bipartisan legis-
lation introduced by my colleague, 
Representative 
DUNN, 
and 
myself, 
which would ensure that lifesaving re-
search and clinical trials are made 
available to reduce the rate of prostate 
cancer for our Nation’s veterans. 
Prostate cancer is the number one 
cancer 
diagnosed 
in 
the 
Veterans 
Health Administration, and numerous 
reports have established a link between 
cancer and military service, including 
exposure to certain herbicides like 
Agent Orange. 
Early detection of this disease is crit-
ical, and veterans deserve a health sys-
tem that provides both early detection 
and successful treatment. This bill will 
do just that. 
It is our job to ensure that, when our 
brave men and women return home 
from their service, the VA is there to 
rehabilitate them and reintegrate them 
back into civilian life. They deserve 
our unconditional support, which is 
why I urge my colleagues to join me in 
honoring our obligation to our vet-
erans and vote in support of this bipar-
tisan legislation. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, Dr. DUNN, because of travel 
restrictions, couldn’t make it to this 
debate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4684 
September 22, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MURPHY), with whom I serve on the 
Education and Labor Committee and 
the Doctors Caucus. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
6092, the Veteran’s Prostate Cancer 
Treatment and Research Act. 
Prostate cancer is the most common 
cancer diagnosis amongst U.S. vet-
erans. I speak in two roles: one as a 
practicing urologist who has, for over 
30 years, taken care of prostate cancer 
patients, and then also as a Congress-
man, too, to the Third District of 
North Carolina, which is home to 
roughly 95,000 veterans, the third most 
in the country. So this bill is especially 
important to me. 
This legislation requires the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs to establish a 
national clinical pathway and a na-
tional registry related to the diagnosis, 
research, and treatment of prostate 
cancer. This information will be crit-
ical to help ensure our VA’s prostate 
cancer patients have the best oppor-
tunity for early diagnosis and treat-
ment. 
Prostate cancer often sneaks up si-
lently, without symptoms, and, thus, 
early detection is the key. Early diag-
nosis leads to a much greater chance 
for cure. 
Also, very important is this bill’s re-
quirements for the VA to develop a 
real-time, actional national prostate 
cancer registry online. The more we 
can keep the VA up to date with the 
medical advances of the 21st century, 
the more veterans’ lives we will save. 
I want to thank my colleague and fel-
low 
urologist, 
Congressman 
NEAL 
DUNN, for leading this initiative in the 
House. Bills like this one are the rea-
son more and more veterans are sur-
viving this horrible disease. I am proud 
to be a cosponsor and look forward to 
its passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for this legislation. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to support this very im-
portant bill. I am surprised, over the 
years, that the VA hasn’t had an active 
registry. 
I want to thank Dr. DUNN and the 
other sponsors of this bill. I think it 
will help save lives in the VA. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to withdraw my motion to suspend 
the rules and pass H.R. 6092. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The mo-
tion is withdrawn.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks, and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 
7795. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Veterans Benefits 
Fairness and Transparency Act of 2020 
is legislation that was brought to the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee as 
a result of a strong partnership be-
tween staff and the advocates that are 
out in the field, even through the 
COVID–19 pandemic, assisting our vet-
erans in the disability benefits process. 
When a VA doctor evaluates a vet-
eran’s disability, they use a form 
known as a disability benefit question-
naire, or DBQ. 
These DBQs are what VA employees 
use to decide benefit claims and can be 
the deciding factor between a grant or 
a denial. 
During the height of the pandemic, 
VA made the decision to pull these 
DBQs off its public website, making 
them inaccessible to veterans and their 
representatives. The advocates told us 
this change was harmful for veterans 
because they could no longer get rel-
evant medical information from their 
own treatment providers to support 
their claims. 
Now, even though VA oftentimes pro-
vides medical exams to veterans during 
the claims process, it is not always the 
same as getting that information from 
your own doctor. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7795 fixes this issue 
by requiring VA to publish DBQs on its 
website and to accept DBQs completed 
by a non-VA medical provider. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to take this mo-
ment to thank Representatives BARR 
and LURIA for introducing this legisla-
tion, and also thank our VSO partners 
for bringing this issue to our attention. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7795, the Veterans Benefits

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4686 
September 22, 2020 
Fairness and Transparency Act of 2020, 
which was introduced by my good 
friend, ANDY BARR, from Kentucky. 
This bill would streamline the proc-
ess for veterans to submit medical evi-
dence from their private provider to 
support their Department of Veterans 
Affairs compensation claim. 
As you may know, VA has recently 
resumed certain in-person disability 
exams after suspending them at the 
start of the COVID–19 national emer-
gency. 
During those uncertain times, some 
veterans may have requested that their 
private physician conduct their dis-
ability exam in order to avoid a claims 
processing delay. 
Unfortunately, in April of 2020, VA 
stopped publishing the disability bene-
fits questionnaires, or DBQs, on its 
website. Those forms are used to en-
sure that VA receives all the medical 
information the department needs to 
adjudicate 
the 
veteran’s 
disability 
claim. 
However, if a veteran’s physician 
does not have access to the appropriate 
DBQ, the provider may not include all 
the medical information needed to sup-
port the veteran’s claim. H.R. 7795 
would address this issue by requiring 
the VA to reinstate the public-facing 
DBQs on its website. 
As an OB/GYN physician who man-
aged my own private practice for three 
decades, I believe that a physician or 
other healthcare provider who has had 
the opportunity to develop a relation-
ship with a veteran patient over sev-
eral years is the most qualified to as-
sess the veteran’s disability. 
If that provider is willing to perform 
a disability exam, they should have the 
same access to the DBQ that a VA ex-
aminer would have. I have heard VA’s 
concerns about this bill, and I under-
stand the department would like to im-
prove the process for veterans to de-
velop and obtain supportive evidence 
from their private providers. 
However, I am not persuaded that the 
veterans are well-served by eliminating 
the public access to DBQs right now. 
Instead, I believe veterans should be 
able to obtain these forms until VA can 
implement a better process. 
Veterans should not be penalized for 
seeking out a medical opinion from 
their private medical provider, espe-
cially when there is a backlog of over 
350,000 pending disability exams caused 
by the pandemic that VA must address. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
Congressman 
BARR
and 
Congress-
woman ELAINE LURIA of Virginia for 
their leadership on this issue. 
And, Mr. Speaker, let me explain how 
it is. Let’s say I am seeing a patient for 
a disability in my office, and I have put 
down exactly what I think is appro-
priate, but it is not all the information 
the VA needs. I don’t know what they 
need. They need to just send me the 
form so I will know what to fill out so 
they will have adequate information. 
So in your office, your staff back 
home are not getting these complaints 
about, Well, they turned my claim 
down because they didn’t have ade-
quate information. This is a simple so-
lution to a simple problem. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Mem-
bers to support H.R. 7795, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Mrs. LURIA), the chairwoman of 
the Disability Assistance and Memorial 
Affairs Subcommittee, and also a co-
sponsor of H.R. 7795. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to rise today in support and as a co- 
lead of the Veterans Benefits Fairness 
and Transparency Act. 
I want to start by thanking my col-
league, Mr. BARR from Kentucky, for 
taking the lead on this. 
And as you know, we have heard from 
countless veterans and countless vet-
erans’ advocates that this is a problem; 
that these forms are not available to 
our veterans and their providers to be 
able to provide the best information in 
the most timely manner in order to 
process these claims. 
The simple fact is that we must act 
to make it easier, not harder, for our 
veterans to receive the benefits that 
they deserve. As mentioned, this bill 
will ensure that benefit questionnaires 
will 
be 
public-facing 
again 
on 
a 
website. 
Mr. BARR and I learned from many 
veterans’ advocates that these forms 
were removed and that veterans that 
needed to provide this vital informa-
tion in order to process their claim 
couldn’t simply have the forms that 
they needed in order to do that. 
This bill also includes the use of 
older versions of the form, because how 
many times have we heard in our of-
fices and from our constituents that a 
veteran has submitted their claim only 
to have it sent back again requesting a 
different version of the form, thus, de-
laying the process for our veterans who 
desperately need these claims to be ad-
judicated, and need the care from the 
VA. 
This will also allow the VA to make 
prompt decisions on the disability 
claims and reduce their unfinished 
exam backlog, which is currently near-
ing 60 percent. 
These questionnaires played a huge 
role in 2011 in reducing the massive 
claims backlog that we experienced at 
that time. And during our current pub-
lic health crisis, while access to care at 
VA facilities is limited, what could 
make more sense than allowing vet-
erans, in company with their civilian 
providers, to also be able to provide the 
information necessary to process their 
claims? 
In my district in coastal Virginia, I 
am honored to represent more than 
92,000 veterans in our district. And this 
is among my top priorities to ensure 
that we make this process easier, more 
transparent, and more timely for our 
veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to close by 
thanking Mr. BARR for introducing this 
legislation, and for allowing me to co-
sponsor it. 
And I urge all of my colleagues to 
support this bill in order to help our 
Nation’s many deserving veterans. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR), my 
good friend and fellow member of the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I am grate-
ful to have my bill, H.R. 7795, the Vet-
erans Benefits Fairness and Trans-
parency Act of 2020 before the House of 
Representatives today. 
I would like to thank my good friend, 
Ranking Member ROE, for his support 
of this legislation, and would espe-
cially like to thank my colleague 
across the aisle and chair of the Dis-
ability and Memorial Affairs Sub-
committee, 
Representative 
ELAINE 
LURIA, for co-leading this bipartisan 
legislation with me. I appreciate Rep-
resentative LURIA’s leadership on this 
issue. 
This bill is vitally important because 
it will restore access for veterans and 
their representatives to the disability 
benefits 
questionnaires 
forms 
pre-
viously available on the VA’s public 
website. Our veterans used these forms 
to submit evidence to the VA for their 
disability claims until the VA removed 
them in April of this year in the middle 
of a pandemic, making it harder for 
veterans to submit their evidence and 
get the benefits owed to them. 
The idea for this legislation was 
brought to me by a member of Ken-
tucky’s Sixth Congressional District 
Veterans’ Coalition, Chief Warrant Of-
ficer Denny Hart. I know Mr. Hart, he 
is a good patriotic man, and he con-
tinues to serve our country by helping 
other veterans file their disability 
claims with the VA. 
However, after the VA removed these 
forms from being publicly available, 
they effectively shut out Mr. Hart and 
others from assisting our veterans. 
There were only 11 VA contract exam-
iners in the Sixth District of Kentucky 
in January of this year. Now, to their 
credit, the VA has increased the num-
ber of those contract examiners, prob-
ably because of this legislation. But 
until we have the assurances that a 
sufficient number of VA contract ex-
aminers are able to assist all of the 
veterans with their disability claims, 
we need public-facing DBQs. 
My legislation gives the VA addi-
tional manpower to process a veteran’s 
DBQ by maintaining the ability of a 
veteran’s own provider to fill out the 
form. This is something vital to vet-
erans in rural communities who may 
be far from a VA medical center or con-
tract examiner. 
Furthermore, our proposal prevents 
veterans from having their disability 
claim delayed or denied because the 
VA changed their DBQ form during the 
application process without the vet-
eran knowing. During this pandemic, 
we must ensure our veterans’ disability

claims process is not paused or com-
promised solely due to a change in a 
bureaucratic form. 
We must protect veterans from un-
necessary burdens while securing bene-
fits owed to them. No veteran should 
be denied the disability benefits to 
which he or she is justly entitled solely 
because a DBQ is not publicly available 
or because the VA changed the form in 
the middle of the process. 
This is commonsense legislation sup-
ported by multiple veteran service or-
ganizations, 
such 
as 
the 
Disabled 
American Veterans, the Paralyzed Vet-
erans of America, Minority Veterans of 
America, Iraq and Afghanistan Vet-
erans of America, and more.

tion’s heroes.

Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr.

courage my colleagues to support this.

Mr. Speaker, the passage of this im-

their disability claims. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support

ward by Congressman BARR of Ken-
tucky, and the cosponsor, the chair-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4701 
September 22, 2020 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Indiana. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous mate-
rials on H.R. 8337, currently under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Indiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, obviously, we are 
here to consider a continuing resolu-
tion to allow the Federal Government 
to continue its operations, H.R. 8337. 
At the outset of my remarks, I do 
want to thank the staff of the Appro-
priations Committee for all of their 
diligent work in some very difficult ne-
gotiations to bring us to this moment. 
People tend not to appreciate their 
good work. 
This is a terrible way to govern the 
United States of America. I regret that 
I believe most of my colleagues here 
feel that a continuing resolution does 
no damage. It does serious damage to 
the agencies, to the budgeting process, 
and to fiscal discipline. 
We should be having consideration 
today of 12 conference reports 8 days 
away from the beginning of the next 
fiscal year. The committee has com-
pleted consideration of all 12 appro-
priations bills. This body has passed 10 
of them. Unfortunately, the other body 
has not acted at all. This resolution 
would take us to December 11. 
I would point out there are anomalies 
in this continuing resolution. The ma-
jority have been submitted and re-
quested by the Office of Management 
and Budget. 
Additionally, there are some other 
anomalies where there were no govern-
ment expenses to continue in 2020; for 
example, possible transition of cost; 
additionally, authorization legislation 
to continue programs which might ex-
pire on September 30, again, with the 
agreement of the authorizing commit-
tees. 
Some Members are upset at this mo-
ment that items have not been in-
cluded, but negotiations have taken 
place in good faith. We have an agree-
ment, and I would ask for this body’s 
support of the legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
gentleman from Indiana’s concerns 
about the process, and I share those 
concerns as well. But as it goes, we are 
voting on this today. 
By 
passing 
this 
short-term 
con-
tinuing resolution, we will provide crit-
ical support for farmers and ranchers, 
extend the nutrition program that has 
been a lifeline during this pandemic for 
low-income students who are out of 
school, ensure critical military oper-
ations continue, support vital trans-
portation programs by extending the 
FAST Act, extend the National Flood 
Insurance Program, ensure that there 
are no delays in the Department of 
Veterans 
Affairs’ 
electronic 
health 
records system, and allow agencies ex-
periencing operational challenges dur-
ing the pandemic continued funding. 
So, I think it is important that we 
support this legislation and move for-
ward, and hopefully, we will get to a 
better agreement as we continue nego-
tiations. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
do have requests for time, but no one is 
here, so I reserve the balance of my 
time at this moment. 
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Madam Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
see Ms. GRANGER, who is the ranking 
member on the full committee, might 
be seeking recognition, so I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. GRANGER) will now control the 
time. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 8337, a short-term con-
tinuing resolution through December 
11. 
The coronavirus pandemic has im-
pacted virtually every aspect of Amer-
ican life. During this unprecedented 
time, it is more critical than ever that 
the Federal Government remain open 
and functioning. By passing this short- 
term CR, we will provide critical sup-
port for farmers and ranchers, extend 
the nutrition program that has been a 
lifeline during the pandemic for low-in-
come students who are out of school, 
ensure 
critical 
military 
operations 
continue, support vital transportation 
programs by extending the FAST Act, 
extend the National Flood Insurance 
Program, ensure that there are no 
delays in the Department of Veterans 
Affairs’ electronic health records sys-
tem, and allow agencies experiencing 
operational challenges during the pan-
demic to continue functioning. 
As an appropriator, it pains me to 
have to consider anything short of a 
full-year appropriations bill for the 
next fiscal year. But I remain hopeful 
that passing this CR will allow the gov-
ernment to continue operating and 
give the House and the Senate time to 
work out our differences after the elec-
tion. 
The alternative would have been an 
unnecessary and costly government 
shutdown. I think most sides agree 
that that would be devastating and dis-
astrous for our economy, our national 
security, our veterans, and our public 
health. 
I look forward to passing this bill 
today, moving it through the Senate, 
and sending it to the President’s desk. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), who is the ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
want to thank the ranking member for 
her leadership and always trying to be 
responsible. I thank Mr. VISCLOSKY and 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
for 
their work. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this agreement between the two parties 
and between the administration and 
the Congress. I am hopeful that it will 
pass overwhelmingly. 
I have a little statement here, which 
I will submit. But because we want to 
get this business done, briefly I want to 
say to the Appropriations Committee: 
Congratulations for doing your work. I 
know there was controversy and every-
body didn’t support it, but we passed 10 
of the appropriations bills almost 2 
months ago, clearly sufficient time to 
have reached agreement and passed the 
appropriation bills, not a CR. A CR is a 
recognition of failure, failure to get 
our work done in a timely fashion, and 
I regret that. 
I take some credit for passing 10 bills 
last year in June and 10 bills this year 
in July. I pushed the Appropriations 
Committee 
pretty 
hard. 
The 
staff 
worked hard; Members worked hard; 
and we got our bills done. 
The Senate has not marked up a sin-
gle bill in committee. There is no bill 
out of committee, and there are no 
bills on the floor, which means the 
Senate has essentially abandoned the 
appropriations process. Madam Speak-
er, that is not the way that the Con-
gress of the United States ought to 
work. 
I am for this. It was tough to get to. 
We have an agreement, and I am hope-
ful that everybody here will vote for it 
so we do not shut down the House of 
Representatives—excuse me—the Gov-
ernment of the United States, not just 
the House of Representatives. 
That is, in my view, an unacceptable 
alternative ever, and we reached an 
agreement today. There was a lot of to- 
ing and fro-ing. A lot of people wanted 
this, a lot of people wanted that, a lot 
of people didn’t want this, and a lot of 
people didn’t want that. But we have 
an agreement that will keep the gov-
ernment functioning for the people 
from now until December 11. 
What, Madam Speaker, I would urge 
is every one of us would from now until 
hopefully before December 11—that is a 
Friday, we are scheduled to break for 
Christmas and the holidays—I am 
hopeful that everyone will put their 
heads together to get the appropria-
tions process done. We will probably do 
it in an omnibus, not single appropria-
tions bills, which is not a good way to 
do it either.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4702 
September 22, 2020 
When I joined the Appropriations 
Committee—and Mr. VISCLOSKY’s Con-
gressman that he worked for was on 
the committee with me—we passed one 
bill at a time. 
b 1915 
The Senate passed one bill at the 
time, and we came to conference and 
sat down together, the members of the 
Defense Subcommittee, the members of 
the 
Treasury-Postal 
Subcommittee, 
and the Labor, Health and Human 
Services, Education, and Related Agen-
cies Subcommittee. We came together 
individually, and we worked out agree-
ments between the two bodies. 
That is the way it ought to work. It 
is not working that way. In a world of 
alternatives, this is the best we have, 
so we need to take it and keep the gov-
ernment funded. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
working with members of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations on both sides 
of the aisle to effect an omnibus that 
we can all be proud of. We won’t all 
agree with all of it, but at least we can 
say, ‘‘This is the work product of the 
people’s House and the United States 
Senate,’’ and pass it and feel that we 
have done our job for the people. 
Madam Speaker, this Continuing Resolution 
is a result of the kind of cooperation that the 
American people expect from all of us. 
It is also an example for how we ought to 
spend the coming days: Working toward an 
agreement on the HEROES Act to mitigate the 
continued economic fallout of the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
However, a Continuing Resolution is not 
how Congress should operate. 
The House did its job, passing nearly all of 
the appropriation bills before the end of July. 
The Republican-controlled Senate, however, 
failed to do its job. 
It has not only failed to pass a single appro-
priation bill—it hasn’t even introduced one. 
Senate Republicans have had months to do 
their part to prevent a shutdown, yet here we 
are just eight days before the end of the fiscal 
year. 
So, the House today will continue to do its 
job and govern responsibly by voting on this 
clean Continuing Resolution, which would 
keep the government open through December 
11 at current funding levels. 
I say this C.R. us ‘‘clean’’ not because it is 
free from anything other a date change, but 
because is reflects a bipartisan agreement be-
tween on the issues it contains. 
This C.R. includes funding for highway and 
transit programs and the National Flood Insur-
ance Program for another year. 
It includes funding to protect seniors from 
rising Medicare premiums and to keep other 
vital health care priorities funded, such as 
community health centers. 
It also includes funding for children who rely 
on school lunch programs to continue access-
ing nutritious meals. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to join in passing this Continuing Resolu-
tion and showing the American people that we 
will not let their government go dark in the 
middle of a deadly pandemic and economic 
crisis. 
I urge the Senate to pass this Continuing 
Resolution and get to work without delay on 
full-year appropriation bills. 
The House is doing its job. 
It’s time for the Republican Senate to start 
doing its job as well. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking 
Member GRANGER. I appreciate her 
leadership during this trying time of a 
pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, the last thing that 
the United States of America needs 
right now in the midst of a pandemic is 
a lapse in government funding that was 
set to expire at the end of this month. 
We need to do better when it comes to 
bipartisan agreements. 
I am extremely disappointed that it 
took us this long to get the CCC, the 
Commodity Credit Corporation, replen-
ished in this agreement and not held 
hostage by the majority. Our farmers, 
our producers in middle America that 
don’t know what the market condi-
tions are going to be like when they 
harvest their crops, they needed the 
certainty of knowing that the United 
States Government was going to fully 
fund the risk management programs 
that we put in place in a bipartisan 
way. 
I also say thank you to those who 
were negotiating with Ranking Mem-
ber GRANGER for also including lan-
guage that provides the USDA with 
waiver authority that provides kids, 
our students, with free meals. That is 
something I have been working on over 
the last few weeks with my colleagues, 
Congresswoman 
SPANBERGER, 
Con-
gressman 
BACON, 
and 
Congressman 
COSTA. 
With this language, we now give our 
schools, families, and school nutrition 
professionals certainty throughout the 
upcoming school year in the midst of a 
pandemic where many may not be able 
to get that hot meal that they have 
been used to getting during the normal 
school year. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
working with Sonny Perdue, Secretary 
Perdue, and the USDA to implement 
this important language. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this package. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the chair-
woman of the Energy and Water Sub-
committee. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, it is with frustra-
tion that I rise in support of today’s 
short-term continuing resolution and 
urge my colleagues to do so as well. 
Once again, we need a means to keep 
the lights on for the Federal Govern-
ment. The American people need and 
deserve more from their collective 
elected leaders. We are in the middle of 
an economic crisis and global pandemic 
when many are unsure they can keep 
their own lights on. 
This 11-week extension puts our Fed-
eral agencies on autopilot. They can’t 
begin new programs or respond to 
shifting priorities. It handcuffs our 
ability to respond to America’s twin 
crises. It blocks investments in na-
tional security, fails to assist schools 
struggling to safely educate America’s 
youth, fails the millions of families 
standing in long lines desperate for 
food assistance, and leaves millions 
questioning whether they even have a 
home tomorrow. It is a complete and 
total dereliction of duty for today and 
tomorrow. 
The lack of action from our Senate 
colleagues, for the second year in a 
row, who deep-sixed their fiscal respon-
sibility and leadership brought us here 
today. Our Senate friends have not 
even started the appropriation process. 
Not a single bill was considered in 
their committees. But they have time 
for another judicial confirmation. 
Madam Speaker, I commend Chair-
woman LOWEY’s leadership, and Speak-
er PELOSI and Majority Leader HOYER 
for their prioritization and passage in 
the House of 10 of our 12 annual appro-
priations spending bills—all managed 
with the unknown and lack of Presi-
dential leadership in establishing a 
Federal response to the COVID pan-
demic. The Senate achieved nothing. 
Nothing. 
While Senate Republican strategists 
are squeezed in rooms over there think-
ing about a Supreme Court nominee be-
fore election day, they ignore their top 
responsibility of Congress’ funding re-
sponsibility. Our Senate Republican 
colleagues have 11 weeks to draft and 
pass 12 bills, but not a single word on 
how they plan to achieve this monu-
mental task. 
The Energy and Water portion of the 
continuing resolution contains com-
monsense, 
necessary 
extensions 
to 
keep certain programs operating for 
the next 11 weeks. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this short-term res-
olution. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ), the chairwoman of the Mili-
tary 
Construction-Veterans 
Affairs 
Subcommittee. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support 
passage of the continuing resolution, 
but I am frustrated that we find our-
selves here yet again. 
Yet again, the Democratic House did 
its job. We passed our bills to fund 
most Federal agencies in July. It is 
now September. The end of the fiscal 
year is in 8 days, but Leader MCCON-
NELL and the Republican Senate have 
not moved a single one of the 12 appro-
priations bills that we are supposed to 
pass every year. 
As an Appropriations subcommittee 
chair, I feel compelled to call out this 
gross dereliction of duty. A CR is obvi-
ously not ideal. But the bill before us

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

September 22, 2020 
today keeps government functioning 
and 
includes 
fixes 
to 
facilitate 
coronavirus relief, which we should 
have done completely separately and 
more significantly. 
The bill allows the Small Business 
Administration to continue to process 
disaster loans, which are a lifeline for 
many struggling small businesses. It 
allows FEMA access to fiscal year 2021 
funding for the Disaster Relief Fund, to 
allow them to respond to emergencies 
and natural disasters. 
I am particularly proud that we in-
crease funding for the Veterans Elec-
tronic Health Record Modernization to 
support the increased number of de-
ployments of the modernized system at 
planned sites going into fiscal year 
2021, ensuring the 10-year moderniza-
tion remains on schedule and on budg-
et. 
Notably, the bill also includes legis-
lation to prevent USCIS employees 
from being furloughed and allow the 
agency to continue doing its job: adju-
dicating applications for work visas, 
asylum, and citizenship, even if that 
job has been greatly hindered by 
Trump and his enablers. The bill also 
includes reporting requirements to en-
sure accountability. 
Democrats also worked hard all day 
today in order to secure $8 billion in 
vital funding for nutrition assistance. 
It is absurd that we even had to fight 
to get Republicans to agree to an ex-
pansion of free meals for food-insecure 
children, but here we are. 
Madam Speaker, finally, let’s be 
clear. The fact that we are passing a 
CR without having already passed an 
additional COVID stimulus bill rep-
resents cruelty and gross incompetence 
of the highest order. 
In May, the House passed the HE-
ROES Act. We did our job. We need to 
keep the government open, but we also 
need additional COVID relief for the 
American people. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further requests for time on 
our side, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
have no other speakers, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
simply ask our colleagues to support 
the continuing resolution, and I, too, 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
am disappointed that we have to do this, pass 
a stop gap Continuing Resolution. But it must 
be done. The alternative is to shut down the 
government while our people are worried 
about their health, their jobs and their homes. 
Under Chairwoman LOWEY’s leadership, the 
House did its job. We passed ten appropria-
tions bills this summer, doing our jobs to meet 
the needs of the American people. We did this 
even in the face of a pandemic which forced 
us to adopt novel ways of working. Meanwhile, 
the other body has not marked up even one 
bill. 
People across the country are waiting for 
their government to take action. Action to fight 
the pandemic. Action to take belated action to 
dismantle systemic racism in our society. Ac-
tion to end endless wars. Action just to do our 
most fundamental job of keeping the govern-
ment running. 
I urge my colleagues to support this con-
tinuing resolution. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, on Homeland Security, and on the 
Budget, I rise in support of H.R. 8337, a bill 
that provides funding to continue the oper-
ations of the federal government through De-
cember 11, 2020, and avoids a wasteful and 
irresponsible shutdown, and also the under-
lying bill. 
The House, led by the Democratic majority, 
did its job, passing 10 of the 12 appropriations 
bills earlier this year but Senate Republicans 
failed to hold a single markup of appropria-
tions bills, making it necessary to pass this 
Continuing Resolution to avert a shutdown 
that would only further damage our economy. 
Throughout the 116th Congress, House 
Democrats have worked to deliver results for 
the American people, passing legislation to 
address each pillar of the ‘‘For The People’’ 
agenda: lower health care costs, higher wages 
by rebuilding America, and cleaning up corrup-
tion and strengthening our Democracy. 
And over the past two years, under the 
leadership of Speaker Pelosi, the House has 
passed nearly 600 bills, including legislation to 
lower health care and prescription drug prices, 
raise wages, advance economic and retire-
ment security, end gun violence, act on the cli-
mate crisis, protect Dreamers, and strengthen 
voting rights. 
For example, in this Congress the House 
has passed and sent to the Senate the fol-
lowing major legislative bills: 
H.R. 1, For The People Act; 
H.R. 2, Moving Forward Act; 
H.R. 3, The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug 
Costs Now Act; 
H.R. 4, Voting Rights Advancement Act 
H.R. 5, Equality Act; 
H.R. 6, The American Dream & Promise 
Act; 
H.R. 7, Paycheck Fairness Act; 
H.R. 8, Bipartisan Background Checks Act; 
H.R. 9, Climate Action Now Act; 
H.R. 582, Raise the Wage Act; 
H.R. 1425, Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Enhancement Act; 
H.R. 1585, Violence Against Women Reau-
thorization Act; and 
H.R. 7120, George Floyd Justice in Policing 
Act. 
These along with many, many others are 
among the 340 bills sitting on Majority Leader 
McConnell’s desk awaiting Senate action. 
Madam Speaker, in truth the Republican- 
controlled Senate has been missing in action 
for much of the 116th Congress. 
Whether it the urgent need to fortify our 
election systems from confirmed foreign inter-
ference, notably from Vladimir Putin’s Russia, 
or lower prescription drugs prices and expand-
ing and protecting the right of all Americans to 
affordable, accessible, high quality health 
care, fixing our broken immigration system, or 
holding a wayward Executive to account, has 
failed American people in its basic duty to pro-
mote the general welfare and provide for the 
common defense. 
Nowhere is this more apparent than its fail-
ure to take up and vote on the HEROES Act 
passed by the House in May of this year to 
address the devastating budgetary and fiscal 
impacts of the COVID–19 pandemic which the 
President exacerbated by his incompetent re-
sponse to the crisis. 
The numbers are heartbreaking. 
As of September 21, 2020, the number of 
lives lost to COVID–19 has passed another 
grim milestone and now exceeds 200,000. 
As of September 20, 2020, there were 
6,812,470 cases of COVID–19, which along 
with the number of lives lost leads the world. 
When President Obama left office on Janu-
ary 20, 2017, unemployment was at 4.7 per-
cent; today, due to the mismanagement of the 
COVID–19 pandemic by President Trump and 
Republicans, unemployment is nearly double 
at 8.4 percent. 
When Trump took office in January 2017, 
there were 241,000 initial unemployment in-
surance (UI) claims for the week ending Janu-
ary 28, 2017 and at the beginning of the 116th 
Congress 
in 
January 
2019: 
there 
were 
236,000 initial UI claims. 
Today, due to the mismanagement of the 
COVID–19 pandemic by President Trump and 
Republicans, there were 860,000 initial UI 
claims for the week ending September 12, 
2020. 
Approximately 30 million Americans have 
lost the job they had just months ago because 
of this Administration’s ineptitude and cavalier 
regard for the well-being of the American peo-
ple. 
Madam Speaker, during President Obama’s 
last full year in office in 2016, the deficit was 
$585 billion but under the mismanagement of 
the current Administration, we have seen the 
deficit balloon nearly seven-fold to $3.3 trillion. 
Continuing this Administration’s unbroken 
chain of woe, in 2019, after repeated attempts 
by Republicans to undermine and sabotage 
the Affordable Care Act, there were 33.2 mil-
lion uninsured Americans, 5 million more than 
when President Obama left office. 
It has been estimated by reputable experts 
that from February 2020 through May 2020 
alone, an estimated 5.4 million Americans be-
came uninsured because of unprecedented 
job loss caused by the Republican mis-
management of this pandemic. 
Given the wreckage to the economy and the 
damage to the lives and livelihoods of the 
American people, it is unconscionable that this 
Administration is pursuing a lawsuit to strike 
down the Affordable Care Act, which would 
take health care coverage away from 20 mil-
lion Americans and take away protections for 
132 million persons who have pre-existing 
conditions. 
Madam Speaker, this country desperately 
needs and wants change. 
While I believe that November 3, will herald 
that the change we need is coming, we must 
keep our ship of state afloat before we can 
right the course. 
That is why I reluctantly support the Con-
tinuing Resolution that will be before us. 
Madam Speaker, let me briefly list several 
of the programs vital to Americans that are 
protected or extended by H.R. 8337. 
Section 103. Same Terms and Conditions 
for Continuing Appropriations as FY 2020. 
Section 103 states that appropriations are 
under the same terms and conditions, includ-
ing relevant authorities and prohibitions, as the 
fiscal year 2019 appropriations bills. 
Section 106. End Date of CR.

AUTHORIZATION 
TO 
AWARD

FIRST CLASS ALWYN C. CASHE

Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma.

sent that the Committee on Armed 
Services be discharged from further 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 8276) to 
authorize 
the 
President

post-
humously award the Medal of Honor to 
Alwyn C. Cashe for acts of valor during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom, and ask for 
its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
FLETCHER). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentlewoman from Okla-
homa? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Financial Services be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 4104) to require the Sec-
retary of the Treasury to mint a coin 
in commemoration of the 100th anni-
versary of the establishment of the 
Negro Leagues baseball, and ask for its 
immediate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4104 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Negro 
Leagues Baseball Centennial Commemora-
tive Coin Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) The year 2020 marks the 100th anniver-
sary of the establishment of the Negro Na-
tional League, a professional baseball league 
formed in response to African-American 
players 
being 
banned 
from 
the 
major 
leagues. 
(2) On February 13, 1920, Andrew ‘‘Rube’’ 
Foster convened a meeting of 8 independent 
African-American baseball team owners at 
the Paseo YMCA in Kansas City, Missouri, to 
form a ‘‘league of their own,’’ establishing 
the Negro National League, the first success-
ful, organized professional African-American 
baseball league in the United States. 
(3) Soon, additional leagues formed in east-
ern and southern States. 
(4) The Negro Leagues would operate for 40 
years until 1960. 
(5) The story of the Negro Leagues is a 
story of strong-willed athletes who forged a 
glorious history in the midst of an inglorious 
era of segregation in the United States. 
(6) The passion of the Negro Leagues play-
ers for the National Pastime would not only 
change the game, but also the United States. 
(7) The creation of the Negro Leagues pro-
vided a playing field for more than 2,600 Afri-
can-American and Hispanic baseball players 
to showcase their world-class baseball abili-
ties. 
(8) The Negro Leagues introduced an excit-
ing brand of baseball that was in stark con-
trast to Major League Baseball. 
(9) A fast, aggressive style of play at-
tracted black and white fans who sat to-
gether to watch those games at a time when 
it was virtually unheard of to interact so-
cially in such a way. 
(10) Negro Leagues baseball would become 
a catalyst for economic development across 
the United States in major urban centers 
such as Kansas City, St. Louis, New York, 
Memphis, Baltimore, Washington, DC, Chi-
cago, and Atlanta. 
(11) The Negro Leagues pioneered ‘‘Night 
Baseball’’ in 1930, 5 years before Major 
League Baseball, and would introduce game 
changing innovations such as shin guards 
and the batting helmet. 
(12) The Negro Leagues helped make the 
National Pastime a global game as players 
from the Negro Leagues— 
(A) were the first people from the United 
States to play in many Spanish-speaking 
countries; and 
(B) introduced professional baseball to the 
Japanese in 1927. 
(13) Jackie Robinson, a military veteran 
and former member of the Negro league’s 
Kansas City Monarchs, would break Major 
League Baseball’s color barrier on April 15, 
1947, with the Brooklyn Dodgers, paving the 
way for other African-American and His-
panic baseball players. 
(14) The Negro Leagues were born out of 
segregation yet would become a driving force 
for social change in the United States. 
(15) The Negro Leagues produced future 
Major 
League 
Baseball 
stars, 
including 
Leroy ‘‘Satchel’’ Paige, Larry Doby, Willie 
Mays, Henry Aaron, Ernie Banks, and Roy 
Campanella. 
(16) The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum 
was established in Kansas City, Missouri, in 
1990— 
(A) to save from extinction a precious 
piece of Americana and baseball history; and 
(B) to use the many life lessons of the pow-
erful story of triumph over adversity of 
Negro Leagues players to promote tolerance, 
diversity, and inclusion. 
(17) In 2006, Congress granted National Des-
ignation to the Negro Leagues Baseball Mu-
seum, recognizing it as ‘‘America’s Home’’ 
for Negro Leagues baseball history. 
SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. 
(a) DENOMINATIONS.—The Secretary of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4711 
September 22, 2020 
The amendment was agreed to. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, was read the

1921 SILVER DOLLAR COIN 
ANNIVERSARY ACT 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Financial Services be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
the bill (H.R. 6192) to require the Sec-
retary of the Treasury to honor the 
100th anniversary of completion of 
coinage of the ‘‘Morgan Dollar’’ and 
the 100th anniversary of commence-
ment of coinage of the ‘‘Peace Dollar’’, 
and for other purposes, and ask for its 
immediate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6192 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘1921 Silver 
Dollar Coin Anniversary Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds that following: 
(1) In December 1921, the Peace silver dol-
lar was approved by Treasury Secretary An-
drew Mellon, replacing the Morgan silver 
dollar and commemorating the declaration 
of peace between the United States and the 
Imperial German government. 
(2) The Peace silver dollar was minted in 
Philadelphia, Denver and San Francisco. The 
Morgan silver dollar was minted at Philadel-
phia, Denver, San Francisco, Carson City, 
and New Orleans. 
(3) The Peace silver dollar was designed by 
Anthony de Francisci with the Goddess of 
Liberty on the obverse and a bald eagle 
clutching the olive branch (a symbol of 
peace) on the reverse. The Peace silver dol-
lars were minted between 1921 to 1935. 
(4) The Morgan silver dollar was designed 
by George T. Morgan and was minted from 
1878 to 1904, and again in 1921. The obverse 
depicts a profile portrait of Lady Liberty and 
on the reverse, a heraldic eagle. 
(5) The conversion from the Morgan silver 
dollar to the Peace silver dollar design in 
1921 reflected a pivotal moment in American 
history. The Morgan silver dollar represents 
the country’s westward expansion and indus-
trial development in the late 19th century. 
The Peace silver dollar symbolizes the coun-
try’s coming of age as an international 
power while recognizing the sacrifices made 
by her citizens in World War I and cele-
brating the victory and peace that ensued. 
(6) These iconic silver dollars with vastly 
different representations of Lady Liberty 
and the American Eagle, reflect a changing 
of the guard in 1921 in the United States and 
therefore on the 100th anniversary must 
begin to be minted again to commemorate 
this significant evolution of American free-
dom. 
SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.

MERRILL’S MARAUDERS CONGRES-
SIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Financial Services and the 
Committee on House Administration 
be discharged from further consider-
ation of the bill (S. 743) to award a Con-
gressional Gold Medal to the soldiers of 
the 5307th Composite Unit (Provi-
sional), commonly known as ‘‘Merrill’s 
Marauders’’, in recognition of their 
bravery and outstanding service in the 
jungles of Burma during World War II, 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 743 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Merrill’s 
Marauders Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) in August 1943, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt and other Allied leaders proposed 
the creation of a ground unit of the Armed 
Forces that would engage in a ‘‘long-range 
penetration mission’’ in Japanese-occupied 
Burma to— 
(A) cut off Japanese communications and 
supply lines; and 
(B) capture the town of Myitkyina and the 
Myitkyina airstrip, both of which were held 
by the Japanese; 
(2) President Roosevelt issued a call for 
volunteers for ‘‘a dangerous and hazardous 
mission’’ and the call was answered by ap-
proximately 3,000 soldiers from the United 
States; 
(3) the Army unit composed of the soldiers 
described in paragraph (2)— 
(A) was officially designated as the ‘‘5307th 
Composite Unit (Provisional)’’ with the code 
name ‘‘Galahad’’; and 
(B) later became known as ‘‘Merrill’s Ma-
rauders’’ (referred to in this section as the 
‘‘Marauders’’) in reference to its leader, Brig-
adier General Frank Merrill; 
(4) in February 1944, the Marauders began 
their approximately 1,000-mile trek through 
the dense Burmese jungle with no artillery 
support, carrying their supplies on their 
backs or the pack saddles of mules; 
(5) over the course of their 5-month trek to 
Myitkyina, the Marauders fought victori-
ously against larger Japanese forces through 
5 major and 30 minor engagements; 
(6) during their march to Myitkyina, the 
Marauders faced hunger and disease that 
were exacerbated by inadequate aerial resup-
ply drops; 
(7) malaria, typhus, and dysentery inflicted 
more casualties on the Marauders than the 
Japanese; 
(8) by August 1944, the Marauders had ac-
complished their mission, successfully dis-
rupting Japanese supply and communication 
lines and taking the town of Myitkyina and 
the Myitkyina airstrip, the only all-weather 
airstrip in Northern Burma; 
(9) after taking Myitkyina, only 130 Ma-
rauders out of the original 2,750 were fit for 
duty and all remaining Marauders still in ac-
tion were evacuated to hospitals due to trop-
ical diseases, exhaustion, and malnutrition; 
(10) for their bravery and accomplish-
ments, the Marauders were awarded the 
‘‘Distinguished Unit Citation’’, later redesig-
nated as the ‘‘Presidential Unit Citation’’, 
and a Bronze Star; and 
(11) though the Marauders were oper-
ational for only a few months, the legacy of 
their bravery is honored by the Army 
through the modern day 75th Ranger Regi-
ment, which traces its lineage directly to the 
5307th Composite Unit. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make 
appropriate arrangements for the award, on 
behalf of Congress, of a single gold medal of 
appropriate design to the soldiers of the 
5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) (referred 
to in this section as ‘‘Merrill’s Marauders’’), 
in recognition of their bravery and out-
standing service in the jungles of Burma dur-
ing World War II. 
(b) DESIGN
AND STRIKING.—For the pur-
poses of the award referred to in subsection 
(a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred 
to in this Act as the ‘‘Secretary’’) shall 
strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, 
devices, and inscriptions, to be determined 
by the Secretary. 
(c) SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Following the award of 
the gold medal referred to in subsection (a) 
in honor of Merrill’s Marauders, the gold 
medal shall be given to the Smithsonian In-
stitution, where it shall be displayed as ap-
propriate and made available for research. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Smithsonian Institution 
should make the gold medal received under 
paragraph (1) available for display elsewhere, 
particularly at other locations and events 
associated with Merrill’s Marauders. 
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
Under such regulations as the Secretary 
may prescribe, the Secretary may strike and 
sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal 
struck under section 3, at a price sufficient 
to cover the costs of the medals, including 
labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and 
overhead expenses. 
SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS. 
Medals struck pursuant to this Act are na-
tional medals for purposes of chapter 51 of 
title 31, United States Code. 
The bill was ordered to be read a 
third time, was read the third time, 
and passed, and a motion to reconsider 
was laid on the table.

HONORING SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in reflection following the tragic 
loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. 
Justice Ginsburg not only has woven 
her legacy into the fabric of American 
law, but blossomed into a progressive 
cultural icon as a result of her dogged 
defense of women’s rights and gender 
equality. 
Her personality and words of delib-
erate intention seamlessly filled our 
courts with promise and purpose and 
our hearts with gratitude. 
To say that her time as an attorney 
and Justice was revolutionary is an un-
derstatement. Her impact, her mem-
ory, her stature will never be forgotten 
and will be forever honored. 
As early as the 1970s, Justice Gins-
burg dedicated her career to the ad-
vancement of women’s equality. Acting 
as an unprecedented firebrand for ac-
cessible, lawful, and equitable govern-
ment, she became not only a woman I 
admire so fervently, but a woman that 
has become an installation of Amer-
ican regality. 
When asked how she might wish to be 
remembered, she answered: ‘‘Just as 
someone who did whatever she could, 
with whatever limited talent she had, 
to move society along in the direction 
I would like it to be for my children 
and grandchildren.’’ 
I believe she rests knowing she ac-
complished just that. 
Thank you, Justice Ginsburg. What 
shooting stars your precious life has 
yielded, giving guidance to human 
progress here at home and abroad. 
A grateful nation says, thank you.

DEMOCRACY DEMANDS 
JOURNALISM 
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. 
Madam Speaker, it was Thomas Jeffer-
son who said that, if he had to choose, 
he would prefer newspapers without 
government over government without 
newspapers. 
Now, that is quite a dramatic state-
ment, but I think it highlights how 
critical journalism is to holding gov-
ernment accountable. Indeed, as my 
lapel pin notes tonight, ‘‘Democracy 
demands journalism.’’ 
Now, journalism is not a comfortable 
duty. I suspect every good reporter has 
faced the wrath of a wronged politician 
and has had disgruntled viewers or 
readers or listeners cancel their pa-
tronage. 
It is tempting for us to be among the 
disgruntled, but if we want a free soci-
ety, we have to support a free press, 
one whose loyalty is not to partisan 
endeavors or to stoking division and 
conflict but, rather, is to the truth. 
Yes, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
democracy 
does demand journalism. 
f 
SUPPORT THE CR TO KEEP THE 
GOVERNMENT ALIVE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I rise enthusiastically to support H.R. 
8337, because we did our job to keep the 
government open, but it is important 
for my constituents to know that we 
have supported the Supplemental Nu-
trition Assistance Program because of 
food insecurity. 
We are keeping the Census Bureau 
funding. I just got through working 
with my constituents: Do your census. 
Do your census. 
In addition, we got flexibility for 
SBA loans for our small businesses, 
and, of course, the SBA disaster loans 
because of flooding in my district right 
now. 
This is what we are supposed to do. 
The flood insurance, we finally saved 
that. We know we need it. 
Aid to children, we need that as well. 
And, of course, housing for the elder-
ly; and our community health centers 
are desperate in the midst of COVID–19. 
Just a few hours ago, I went to visit 
the 20,000 flags evidencing 200,000 dead. 
I stood there. It was overwhelming. 
The power of our failures in this ad-
ministration of not doing a job, not 
testing, not telling people to wear their 
masks, not socially distancing: 200,000 
Americans are dead. 
Pass the HEROES Act now. Pass it 
now. Wear your masks to make a dif-
ference in the lives of Americans. 
We must do our job. I support the CR 
to keep the government alive. 
f 
HONORING CHATHAM COUNTY 
COMMISSIONER JAMES HOLMES 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor the life of Chatham County Com-
missioner James Holmes from Geor-
gia’s First Congressional District, who 
passed away on August 17. 
Commissioner Holmes was a devoted 
public servant who served as Chatham 
County Commissioner for 16 years, and 
he was well known for his work with 
the Frank Callen Boys & Girls Club. 
Everyone who knew him remembered 
him as always smiling and living his 
life to serve others. 
Commissioner Holmes was known as 
‘‘Coach,’’ since he was a basketball 
coach at Savannah State University. 
He spent 35 years as a program direc-
tor at the Frank Callen Boys & Girls 
Club, and he was extremely devoted to 
improving the lives of youth in his 
community. 
Commissioner Holmes was one of the 
kindest, most devoted people who 
served his community selflessly. Ev-
eryone who knew him was touched by 
his compassion, generosity, and joy he 
always exuded. 
Commissioner Holmes’ impact on the 
Savannah community will remain for 
countless years to come. I am very 
grateful for the life that he lived. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during the most difficult time.

S5733 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2020 
No. 164 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, we continue to trust the 
power of Your prevailing providence. In 
times of trouble, You keep us safe from 
harm. You strengthen us when all 
seems lost, enabling us to reach Your 
desired destination without stumbling 
or slipping. 
Lord, Your plans are fulfilled in spite 
of our enemies. Surround our Senators 
with the shield of Your divine favor. 
Lord, inspire them to rejoice in Your 
might because of Your victorious guid-
ance. Keep them from the paths of dis-
grace. 
Look with favor, O Lord, upon us all, 
and may our service ever be acceptable 
to You. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
those on the other side of the aisle who 
openly say they will end the filibuster 
if they get the majority should have to 
explain why they continue to vote to 
filibuster important issues like police 
reform and COVID relief. Do they 
somehow believe the filibuster is wrong 
in principle, or do they admit that they 
think there should be two sets of rules 
depending on which political party has 
the majority in the Senate? 
If you think at a minimum that the 
filibuster should be used sparingly and 
judiciously, how do you justify voting 
to block even moving, even discussing, 
let’s say, for instance, Senator SCOTT’s 
police reform bill when you have been 
promised amendments by the majority 
leader and when you can always fili-
buster final passage if you still aren’t 
satisfied after the bill has been dis-
cussed for a long period of time and a 
lot of amendments have been adopted? 
It is clear their position on filibuster is 
pure partisanship at its worst. 
If there is any way you are going to 
promote the bipartisanship that the 
people are demanding, it is only in this 
institution of the Senate, where it re-
quires 60 votes to get to finality on a 
bill and where you have pressure to do 
things in a bipartisan way or nothing 
gets done.

SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I explained yesterday how moving 
ahead on a vote on the forthcoming Su-
preme Court nomination will be con-
sistent with both history and prece-
dent. 
When an election-year nomination to 
fill an election-year vacancy occurs in 
a divided government, with a Senate 
and a President of different parties, the 
historical norm is that such nomina-
tions are not confirmed. But the times 
this has happened after the American 
people have elected a Senate majority 
to work alongside the same-party 
President, every such nominee has 
been confirmed, save one bizarre excep-
tion of a nominee who had corrupt fi-
nancial dealings. Let me say that 
again. Except for Justice Abe Fortas 
and his ethical scandals, every single 
nomination in American history made 
under our present circumstances has 
ended in a confirmation—seven out of 
eight. 
That is the thing about facts and his-
tory. Angry rhetoric does not change 
them. Partisan finger-pointing does 
not alter them. Facts simply exist. 
They are there for everyone to see. His-
tory and precedent were on this Senate 
majority’s side in 2016, and they are 
overwhelmingly on our side now. 
If we go on to confirm this nomina-
tion after a careful process, then both 
in 2016 and in 2020, this Senate will 
simply have provided the typical, nor-
mal outcome in each scenario. Think 
about that fact and then weigh it 
against the outcry and hysteria that 
has already erupted on the far left. 
Yesterday, the Democratic leader an-
nounced on the floor that if the Senate 
holds a vote on the forthcoming nomi-
nation it would ‘‘spell the end of this 
supposedly great deliberative body.’’ 
Spell the end of this supposedly great 
deliberative body? That is what he 
said. It would be the death of the Sen-
ate if a duly elected majority of the 
U.S. Senate exercises its advice and 
consent power as it sees fit. That is 
what Senates do. It is our job descrip-
tion. Presidents makes nominations as 
they see fit, and Senate majorities ei-
ther provide or withhold advice and 
consent as we see fit. But now our 
Democratic colleagues tell us that the 
Senate doing normal senatorial things 
would ‘‘spell the end’’ of this institu-
tion—whatever that may mean. 
The Democratic leader is not alone in 
these 
pronouncements. 
Chairman 
JERRY NADLER of the House Judiciary 
Committee has already announced that 
if the Senate majority dares to act like

a Senate majority, future Democrats 
should ‘‘immediately move to expand 
the Supreme Court.’’ 
From another colleague: 
If [they hold] a vote in 2020, we pack the 
court in 2021. It’s that simple. 
Speaker PELOSI intimated on tele-
vision last weekend that she may con-
sider launching a new frivolous im-
peachment simply to tie up the Sen-
ate’s time. She said: ‘‘We have our op-
tions.’’ 
The junior Senator from Massachu-
setts said Democrats ‘‘must abolish the 
filibuster and expand the Supreme 
Court.’’ 
The junior Senator for Hawaii said: 
‘‘All of those matters will be on the 
agenda.’’ 
The senior Senator from Connecticut 
said: ‘‘Nothing is off the table.’’ 
Just yesterday, former Vice Presi-
dent Biden himself refused to rule out 
that he might seek to pack the Su-
preme Court. 
Bear in mind, none of them assert 
this majority would be breaking any 
Senate rule by holding this vote; it is 
just that our Democratic friends worry 
they might not like the outcome. 
For some reason, they cannot bear to 
see Republicans governing within the 
rules as Republicans—doing exactly 
what Americans elected us to do. So 
they threaten to wreck the makeup of 
the Senate if they lose a vote and to 
wreck the structure of the Court if 
somebody is confirmed whom they op-
pose. 
It has been interesting to watch our 
colleagues try to recast their dis-
turbing threats as somehow tied to this 
Supreme Court vacancy. No one should 
fall for this trick. Democrats have al-
ready been threatening these actions 
for months. This isn’t anything new. 
Our colleagues now say that ‘‘noth-
ing’’ would be ‘‘off the table’’ if a new 
Justice were to be confirmed. They 
want badly for people to believe these 
are new threats that Democrats would 
take off the table—would take off the 
table—if Republicans would just help 
them sink President Trump’s nominee. 
Let me say that again. They want 
badly for people to believe these are 
new threats that Democrats would 
take off the table if Republicans would 
just help them sink President Trump’s 
nominee. 
Let me read another quotation. This 
is the junior Senator from California 
speaking, our distinguished colleague 
who is now running for Vice President: 
We are on the verge of a crisis of con-
fidence in the Supreme Court. We have to 
take this challenge head on, and everything 
is on the table to do that. 
Sound familiar? Of course it does. 
Our colleague made that remark in 
March of 2019—in March of 2019. 
These threats are not new. They have 
nothing to do with this new vacancy. 
Democrats have already been playing 
this game for more than a year and a 
half. 
It was more than a year ago that sev-
eral Senate Democrats threatened the 
Supreme Court in a written brief. They 
said: ‘‘The Court is not well [and] per-
haps the Court can heal itself before 
the public demands it be ‘restruc-
tured.’ ’’ 
It was more than a year ago that 
Democrats, competing for their party’s 
Presidential nomination, made court- 
packing a central element in their 
platforms. 
It was more than 6 months ago that 
the Democratic leader appeared across 
the street outside the Court and 
threatened specific Justices if they did 
not rule his way. 
For goodness’ sake, the junior Sen-
ator from Maryland came right out and 
admitted 
this 
yesterday. 
Someone 
asked him whether he would support 
these acts of institutional vandalism if 
a nominee is confirmed this year, and 
he helpfully pointed out: ‘‘I’ve always 
said I’m open, even before this seat 
opened . . . [those] possibilities were 
on the table before we got to this 
point,’’ thereby proving my point. 
These threats are not new. They have 
nothing to do with this vacancy. 
Our friend the junior Senator from 
Delaware said on television this Sun-
day that he wants to persuade Repub-
licans to forgo filling this vacancy, but 
all the way back in June—long before 5 
days ago—he himself notably refused 
to rule out breaking the Senate’s rules 
to kill the filibuster. 
There is no degree to which reward-
ing these threats would buy the Nation 
any relief from this. There is nothing 
you can give them to stop all the 
threats. There is no ‘‘deal’’ that would 
stop these dangerous tactics. Giving in 
to political blackmail would not do a 
thing to secure our institutions. You 
do not put a stop to irresponsible hos-
tage-taking by making hostage-taking 
a winning strategy. 
I will tell you what really could 
threaten our system of government. It 
is not Senate Republicans doing legiti-
mate things squarely within the Sen-
ate rules and within the Constitution 
that Democrats happen to dislike—no, 
no. What could really threaten our sys-
tem is if one of our two major parties 
continues to pretend the whole system 
is automatically illegitimate whenever 
they lose; if they continue to act like, 
for their side of the aisle, a legitimate 
defeat is an oxymoron. That is the dan-
ger to our democracy. 
Every one of these attacks on our in-
stitutions only underscores how impor-
tant they are. Every threat to turn our 
courts into a political tug-of-war only 
reinforces why the Senate is charged 
with protecting our independent judici-
ary and why this majority’s work with 
President Trump on this task is so cru-
cial. 
The President plans to use the power 
the voters gave him to make a nomina-
tion. Senators will use the power the 
voters gave us to either provide or 
withhold consent as we see fit. The 
only ones responsible for those threats 
will be the people making them. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
tomorrow the recently departed Su-
preme Court Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg will lie in repose at the Supreme 
Court, and on Friday Ruth Bader Gins-
burg will lie in state here in the Cap-
itol, the first time in our Nation’s long 
history that a woman has ever received 
the honor. 
I can think of no more fitting tribute 
for a woman who made a life’s work of 
going where women had never gone be-
fore. Even with the benefit of a few 
days, the loss of Justice Ginsburg is 
devastating. You need only walk by the 
Supreme Court today, where flowers, 
candles, chalk-written notes, and spon-
taneous demonstrations have clogged 
the sidewalks for 4 days straight, to 
know her impact on this country. 
We will honor her this week, and, by 
all rights, we should honor her dying 
wish, imparted to her granddaughter, 
that she ‘‘not be replaced until the 
next President is installed.’’ All the 
words and encomia for Justice Gins-
burg from the other side ring hollow if 
they will not honor her last dying wish. 
Yesterday, the Republican side—so 
often, President Trump—seemed to 
make 
it 
worse. 
President 
Trump 
mocked Justice Ginsburg’s dying wish 
by insinuating that her granddaughter 
was a liar, once again confirming every 
terrible thing we know about our 
President. 
He 
said 
that 
Justice 
Ginsburg’s 
statement was something that ‘‘sounds 
like a Schumer deal or maybe Pelosi or 
shifty Schiff.’’ That is the President of 
the United States baselessly suggesting 
that Democrats fabricated the dying 
wish of the late Justice Ginsburg. It 
was a coarse, shameful, lying insult to 
the late Justice Ginsburg and to her 
family. 
If the President had a shred of human 
decency—even a little—he would apolo-
gize, but we all know he will not. Ev-
eryone here in the Senate ought to be 
disgusted by the President’s comments. 
How low can this President go? He 
knows no depth. You can never know 
that. 
You would think that, after the Re-
publican majority led a historic block-
ade just 4 years ago to keep open a va-
cancy on the Supreme Court because it 
was an election year, they would have 
the honor and decency to apply their

September 22, 2020 
own rule when the same scenario came 
around again. You would expect the 
Senate majority to follow their own 
rule. What is fair is fair. 
This is what Leader MCCONNELL said 
in 2016: 
The American people should have a voice 
in the selection of their next Supreme Court 
Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not 
be filled until we have a new President. 
This 
is 
the 
McConnell 
rule—the 
McConnell rule. This is the principle 
that Leader MCCONNELL
and then- 
Chairman GRASSLEY
used to justify 
their refusal to even meet with Presi-
dent Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. 
Here it is—the McConnell rule: When 
it is a Presidential season, you can’t 
vote on a Supreme Court nominee be-
cause ‘‘the American people should 
have a voice.’’ Now, Leader MCCONNELL 
repeated that refrain for almost a year 
and so did almost every other Repub-
lican in the Chamber: 
The American people shouldn’t be denied a 
voice. 
Give the people a voice. 
The Senate should not confirm a new Su-
preme Court Justice until we have a new 
President. 
I don’t think we should be moving on a 
nominee in the last year of a President’s 
term. I would say that if it was a Republican 
President. 
If an opening came in the last year of 
President Trump’s term and the primary 
process had started— 
The primary process had started— 
we’ll wait to the next election. 
I don’t even have to tell you who 
those quotes came from. It was nearly 
every single Republican in this Cham-
ber. That is how they justified the un-
precedented 
blockade 
of 
President 
Obama’s Supreme Court nominee: no 
vote during a Presidential election 
year because we have to let the people 
decide. 
They promised to stay consistent if a 
Republican President won in Novem-
ber. It turns out, a Republican Presi-
dent did win that fall, and a Supreme 
Court vacancy did arise in the final 
year of his term, not just during the 
primary process but long after it was 
over, with little more than a month—a 
month—before the election. 
Now, whoops, didn’t mean it. It is dif-
ferent now. We are supposed to believe 
this specious, flimsy, and dishonest ar-
gument that it is about the orientation 
of the Senate and the Presidency or 
how angry Republicans are at Demo-
crats and all the big, scary things we 
might do in the future. Maybe that will 
justify it—anything not to admit the 
plain fact that they all made one argu-
ment for a year, an argument they in-
sisted was a ‘‘principle’’ when it was 
good for them politically, and now they 
are doing the opposite thing. 
The McConnell rule: ‘‘The American 
people should have a voice in the selec-
tion of their next Supreme Court Jus-
tice.’’ It turns out, the McConnell rule 
was nothing more than a McConnell 
ruse. 
Leader MCCONNELL, sadly, sadly, is 
headed down the path of breaking his 
word to the Senate and the American 
people. He has exposed once and for all 
that a supposed principle of giving the 
people a voice in selecting the next 
Justice was a farce. Sadly, again— 
sadly—Leader MCCONNELL has defiled 
the Senate like no one in this genera-
tion, and Leader MCCONNELL may very 
well destroy it. 
If Leader MCCONNELL
presses for-
ward, the Republican majority will 
have stolen two Supreme Court seats, 4 
years apart, using completely con-
tradictory rationales. How can we ex-
pect to trust the other side again? 
For those of you on the other side 
who are still thinking about this and 
maybe some who might change their 
minds, just think of what this does to 
this body and people’s word on one of 
our most solemn and sacred obliga-
tions: to choose a Supreme Court Jus-
tice fairly and honestly. 
It is obvious why the Republican 
leader, when he comes to the floor, 
sounds so angry and defensive in his re-
marks. I will note for the record that 
the Republican leader did not once 
mention his principle in 2016—that the 
American people should have a voice in 
selecting the next Supreme Court Jus-
tice—in any of his speeches because he 
can’t mention it. 
Just to give you a sense of how far 
down the rabbit hole my friend from 
Kentucky has gone, yesterday—listen 
to this—this is what he said. Leader 
MCCONNELL said that President Obama 
asked the Senate ‘‘for an unusual 
favor’’ by fulfilling his constitutional 
duty to nominate a Supreme Court 
Justice with almost a year left in the 
term—‘‘an unusual favor.’’ 
Only the Republican leader could 
look at our system of government so 
cynically. Apparently, the Senate’s 
constitutional duty to advise and con-
sent is an unusual favor when a Demo-
cratic President is in office but a cat-
egorical imperative when a Republican 
is in office. 
That is actually his argument. I lis-
tened to the Republican leader yester-
day. I listened to him this morning. 
Gone are all the invocations of giving 
the American people a voice. It is noth-
ing so supposedly high-minded this 
time. No, this time the Republican 
leader isn’t even hiding that his deci-
sion is nothing—nothing—but raw, par-
tisan politics. 
According to the Republican leader, 
when the President and the Senate ma-
jority are the same party, you can 
break all the rules to get your Justice. 
Change the rules of the Senate to pass 
Supreme Court Justices on a majority 
vote. Rush it through before an elec-
tion. It doesn’t matter if you said the 
exact opposite thing 4 years ago, 2 
years ago, or even, for some Senators, 
a few months ago. 
This is how our vaunted traditions of 
bipartisanship and compromise—on life 
support before—now end. This is how. 
By one side—in this case the Repub-
lican majority under Leader MCCON-
NELL—deciding that the rules don’t 
apply to them, even their own rules. 
That, when push comes to shove, it is 
brute political force, all the way down. 
If my friends on the Republican side 
want that kind of Senate, they can fol-
low Leader MCCONNELL down the very 
dangerous path he has laid down. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
one final matter. According to the offi-
cial tally at Johns Hopkins University, 
the United States today will reach a 
staggering milestone of 200,000 Ameri-
cans lost to COVID–19—200,000 Ameri-
cans—more than any other country on 
Earth. Far more than we should have. 
Far more than we would have had 
there been a proper, coordinated, and 
energetic response to the virus by the 
Trump administration. 
In the face of this tragic milestone, 
what does President Trump do? Does 
he mourn the astounding loss of lives? 
No, he goes off on the campaign trail, 
where yesterday he told his supporters 
that the virus ‘‘affects virtually no-
body.’’ 
Affects virtually nobody? Tell that to 
the families and friends of the 200,000 
who are in mourning. 
Seriously, the day before the United 
States hits 200,000 deaths from COVID– 
19, the President said the virus ‘‘affects 
virtually nobody.’’ 
He also said: ‘‘If you take the blue 
states out, we’re really at a very low 
level.’’ 
He also said: ‘‘It is what it is.’’ 
This is our President? My goodness. 
Do you want to know why we have 
the worst pandemic response of any de-
veloped nation on Earth? You want to 
know why now nearly one out of every 
five deaths from COVID–19 come from 
America? 
It 
is 
because 
President 
Trump lied to the American people 
from day one about the gravity of this 
disease, and he is still doing it now, in 
a desperate and vile effort to boost his 
political fortunes. 
And here in the Senate, Republicans 
will do anything—anything to back 
him, no matter what he says or does, as 
long as he nominates their judges. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING JUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, on 
Friday, we learned that trailblazing 
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg had died at the age of 87 from 
pancreatic cancer. 
Justice Ginsburg embraced the law 
at a time when being a woman in the 
field meant a constant uphill battle. 
She had to fight for opportunities that 
were available to men as a matter of 
course. 
Her work as a lawyer eventually 
came to focus around women’s rights— 
or as Ruth Bader Ginsburg put it, ‘‘the 
constitutional principle of the equal 
citizenship 
stature 
of 
men 
and 
women.’’ 
Before joining the Court, she argued 
six gender discrimination cases before 
it, and as a Justice, she continued to 
advance this cause. She served with 
distinction on the Supreme Court for 
more than 25 years—and engaged in 
some of the Court’s most memorable 
exchanges over that period. 
She was known for her work ethic 
and tenacity, as well as her kindness 
and good humor, and, of course, for her 
love of opera and her 56-year romance 
with her beloved husband, Marty. 
She disagreed often with her good 
friend Justice Scalia, but they never 
allowed their strong disagreements to 
ruin their enduring friendship and mu-
tual respect. She could dissent on the 
most fundamental questions, without 
indicting the character of those with 
whom she disagreed. 
Her work to secure equal treatment 
for women has earned her a place in 
American history, and her courage and 
perseverance in overcoming significant 
obstacles 
will 
continue 
to 
inspire 
many. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
Justice Ginsburg’s family. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, in the wake of a 
Supreme Court Justice’s death, the 
Senate has to turn its thoughts to con-
sidering the next Supreme Court nomi-
nee. The President has indicated that 
he expects to nominate Justice Gins-
burg’s successor as soon as this week. 
He has also made it clear he intends to 
nominate a woman. 
Whomever he nominates, I am con-
fident that she will be in the mode of 
the President’s other Supreme Court 
appointments, a nominee with a pro-
found respect for the law and the Con-
stitution, someone who understands 
that the job of a Supreme Court Jus-
tice—or any judge—is to interpret the 
law, not make the law, to call balls and 
strikes, not rewrite the rules of the 
game. 
Predictably, Democrats are in an up-
roar over the fact that President 
Trump will nominate a third Supreme 
Court Justice. They want Republicans 
to refuse to consider the President’s 
nomination before the President has 
even named anyone. 
They claim that the fact that a Re-
publican-led Senate did not consider 
the nomination of Merrick Garland 
during President Obama’s final year 
means Republicans should decline to 
consider President Trump’s nominee. 
It is perfectly true that the Senate 
did not vote on President Obama’s final 
Supreme Court nominee. That is some-
thing the Senate can choose to do. Any 
Senate, led by either party, can decline 
to take up a nominee. That is the Sen-
ate’s constitutional prerogative. 
At the time, we felt that since voters 
had recently chosen a Republican-led 
Senate, while the President was a Dem-
ocrat on his way out of office, the new 
President should choose the next Su-
preme Court nominee. And we all knew 
at the time that very well could be Hil-
lary Clinton. But that was wholly in 
line with the history of the Senate— 
and with the rule promulgated by Joe 
Biden when he was chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee, and endorsed, I 
might add, by the current Democratic 
leader in 2007. 
As a Wall Street Journal op-ed ex-
plained: 
This exception was popularized in 1992 by 
Sen. Joe Biden, then chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee. He urged President George 
H.W. Bush to refrain from making any Su-
preme Court nominations in that election 
year. What made 1992 different from other 
election years, Mr. Biden explained, was that 
‘‘divided Government’’ reflected an absence 
of a ‘‘nationwide consensus’’ on constitu-
tional philosophy. ‘‘Action on a Supreme 
Court nomination must be put off until after 
the election campaign is over,’’ the future 
vice president insisted. No vacancy arose 
until 1993, when President Clinton was in the 
White House and Ginsburg’s nomination eas-
ily passed a Democratic Senate. But the 
Biden rule fit 2016 to a tee. 
For the past 130-plus years, no Senate 
has approved a Supreme Court nominee 
in the final year of a President’s term 
if the Senate majority and the Presi-
dent were of different parties. 
On the other hand, a number of Su-
preme Court nominees have been con-
firmed during a President’s final year 
in office when the Senate was led by 
the same party as the President. 
There have been 15 situations in U.S. 
history where a Supreme Court va-
cancy arose in a Presidential election 
year, and the President nominated 
someone that same year. In eight of 
those cases, the President and the Sen-
ate majority were of the same party. 
And in all but one of those eight cases, 
the 
President’s 
nominee 
was 
con-
firmed. 
Democrats are free to disagree with 
Republicans’ application of the Biden- 
Schumer rule in 2016, but no one can 
dispute that voting on or rejecting a 
nominee is the constitutional preroga-
tive of the U.S. Senate. 
There should be nothing disturbing 
about the Senate fulfilling its constitu-
tional role of advising and consenting 
on a Supreme Court nomination. 
What is disturbing are Democrats’ 
threats as to what they will do if Re-
publicans in the Senate don’t yield to 
their demands. Those threats include, 
but are not limited to, eliminating the 
legislative filibuster, which is the rule 
we all know in the Senate that helps 
ensure that bills that come before the 
Senate require bipartisan cooperation; 
they threatened to pack the Supreme 
Court with additional Justices so that 
they can ensure a rubberstamp for 
their agenda. 
Some 
are 
even 
suggesting—sug-
gesting 
impeaching 
the 
President 
again. What they would impeach him 
for is not exactly clear. Fulfilling his 
constitutional responsibility to name 
someone to the Supreme Court? 
Some Democrats have gone so far as 
to say that nothing is off the table 
when it comes to retribution for con-
sidering the President’s nominee—a 
particularly insidious and irresponsible 
threat at the time when political vio-
lence is at a high in this country. 
One thing I can say is that Repub-
licans will not be deterred from per-
forming our constitutional role by 
Democrats’ undemocratic threats. For 
many of us, confirming principled 
judges who will uphold the Constitu-
tion and the rule of law has been a core 
tenet of our public service—and a 
shared goal of those who elected us. 
We will work to fill the Supreme 
Court vacancy, and I look forward to 
receiving and reviewing the President’s

I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I lis-
tened to the statements made by the 
Republican leadership this morning on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. If one has 
a sense of history and memory, their 
statements are preposterous. 
The last speaker came before us and 
said: The Democrats are even threat-
ening to end the filibuster in retribu-
tion. 
Well, let’s stop and think for a mo-
ment. Was there a filibuster affecting 
the Supreme Court nominees? Was 
there a requirement of 60-vote margins 
if there is controversy associated with 
filling the vacancy on the Supreme 
Court? There was until one Senator 
from Kentucky, Mr. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
eliminated the filibuster when it came 
to the Supreme Court. 
This so-called democratic institution 
of the filibuster was eliminated when it 
came to Supreme Court nominees by 
that same Senator MCCONNELL, who 
comes to the floor and says that the 
Democrats have reached an outrageous 
position: They are threatening the fu-
ture of the filibuster. 
He eliminated it. When there were 
changes made in the filibuster on other 
court appointments, Senator Reid was 
careful not to include the Supreme 
Court, but Senator MCCONNELL
did. 
Senator MCCONNELL has brought us to 
this moment. 
Think how different it would be—how 
different it would be today if the nomi-
nee of this President were subject to a

filibuster. If it took 60 votes, it means 
the person nominated would have to be 
moderate in their approach. We don’t 
expect that from this President in fill-
ing the vacancy of Ruth Bader Gins-
burg. 
I also read and reread one simple fact 
when it came to Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
in 1993. She cleared the Senate Cham-
ber, at a time when the filibuster rule 
did apply, with a vote of 96 to 3—96 to 
3. 
Understand that Ruth Bader Gins-
burg was a well-known person when she 
came before this body for approval to 
the Supreme Court. She had been an 
outspoken advocate for women’s rights 
and equality as an attorney and advo-
cate for groups like the American Civil 
Liberties Union. She had served on the 
DC Circuit Court of Appeals. 
As well known as she was for her po-
litical beliefs, she cleared this Senate 
Chamber with only three dissenting 
votes—Senator Jesse Helms, Senator 
Don Nickles, and Senator Bob Smith— 
three Republicans. What a different 
time it was. Even though her stripes 
were clear, she was so well respected as 
a jurist and a person of integrity that 
she was approved by the Senate Cham-
ber. 
How far we have fallen. We are in a 
position now, at this moment, when 
Senator MCCONNELL, 4 years ago, es-
tablished a standard. The vacancy of 
Scalia’s seat on the Supreme Court led 
President Obama to nominate Merrick 
Garland, a well-respected judge from 
the DC Circuit. I remember seeing him 
and meeting with him after he had 
been proposed by President Obama. It 
was a sad duty to watch him as he 
walked the Halls of the Senate. You 
see, Senator MCCONNELL
announced 
that he didn’t want any Republican 
Senators 
to 
physically 
meet 
with 
Merrick Garland—not give him the rec-
ognition of even a meeting in their of-
fice, let alone a hearing. The argument 
that Senator MCCONNELL
made—and 
Senator SCHUMER said this morning— 
was that it wasn’t President Obama’s 
place to fill that vacancy; it was the 
place of the next President of the 
United States. 
Senator MCCONNELL, basically, de-
clared President Obama was a lame-
duck when it came to Supreme Court 
vacancies in his last year in office and 
that the next President, whoever that 
might be, would make the choice. Well, 
one after another, the Republican Sen-
ators marched in line behind that 
McConnell position, announcing that 
they, too, agreed that President Obama 
was a lameduck when it came to filling 
Supreme Court vacancies in his last 
year in office. They didn’t cite the Con-
stitution because there is no provision 
in the Constitution that even comes 
close to that suggestion. There cer-
tainly wasn’t any law, and there wasn’t 
any precedent. 
I hear the Republicans come to the 
floor mentioning Joe Biden’s name and 
CHUCK
SCHUMER’s name. Who knows 
who will be next on their list? The fact 
is, the Senate makes the decisions 
based on majority. At that point, Sen-
ator MCCONNELL had the majority, and 
he lined up his membership behind 
him. 
Unfortunately, they are lining up 
again, but this time Senator MCCON-
NELL’s position is the exact opposite. 
This time he is arguing that because 
there is a Republican President, he 
should fill this vacancy instantly: Get 
it done. Let’s go. His Republican Sen-
ators who took the opposite position 4 
years ago are finding some rationaliza-
tion to follow him again. 
What is at stake in this, of course, is 
not just the Senate, the comity of the 
Senate, the respect we have for one an-
other, the respect we have for tradi-
tions one way or the other and that 
they be followed regardless of the 
President’s party; what is at stake, un-
fortunately, is also the Supreme Court. 
This institution, the third branch of 
government, is part of a strategy that 
Senator MCCONNELL has been pushing 
forward for years now. It is the intent 
of the Republicans in the Senate, 
through Senator MCCONNELL, to take 
control of the third branch of govern-
ment, the judicial branch. They are 
desperate to do it. Time is not on their 
side. 
The demographics of America cannot 
be held back simply by voter suppres-
sion. They have to count on jurists 
from every level of the Federal judici-
ary to adhere to their minority point 
of view on so many important issues. 
Ironically, one of those issues is the 
role of women, the equality of women 
in America. Ruth Bader Ginsburg ar-
gued for that her whole life. She was 
smart enough to know she was taking 
her argument to a lot of male judges, 
so she argued for equality for men, as 
well as women, during the course of her 
career on and off the bench. 
She was principled, determined, and 
successful. As an attorney, she argued 
and won multiple cases in the Supreme 
Court in the 1970s, eventually per-
suading the all-male Court to apply the 
14th Amendment’s equal protection 
clause 
to 
sex-based 
discrimination. 
Sadly, we can predict with almost 100 
percent certitude that if Donald Trump 
and MITCH MCCONNELL choose her suc-
cessor, that principle will be under fire; 
in fact, it may not even survive. 
For all the kind speeches about this 
principled woman and what she gave to 
America—and they are well deserved 
about Ruth Bader Ginsburg—watch the 
nominee who comes from the Trump 
White House and you will find, I am 
afraid, they are not even close to the 
standard that she argued for and suc-
ceeded. 
Today, we are 6 weeks from election 
day and 7 weeks from the Supreme 
Court taking up another case, one 
which I think is relevant and impor-
tant to every single American. The 
question the Court will decide is 
whether 
the 
ACA—ObamaCare—will 
survive. President Trump and Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL want to rush the 
nominee before the Senate before these 
two dates arrive. 
Do you recall, not that many years 
ago, when the Republicans controlled 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
and 
voted, I believe, 50 different times to 
eliminate the Affordable Care Act? 
Were it not for a Democratic Senate, 
they might have achieved their goal. 
Each and every time they were asked: 
What would you replace it with? What 
would you say to the 20 million Ameri-
cans who depend on the Affordable 
Care Act for their source of health in-
surance? What would you say to the 
rest of America who depend on the Af-
fordable Care Act for fundamental pro-
tections in health insurance and pro-
tections, such as no discrimination 
based on preexisting conditions? 
Americans 
understand 
that. 
Vir-
tually every family has a story to tell 
of someone in their own family with an 
illness that could be considered a pre-
existing condition. The insurance in-
dustry even went so far at one point as 
to say being a woman was essentially a 
preexisting condition. Based on that, 
the health insurance industry would ei-
ther charge higher premiums or refuse 
coverage. 
We got rid of those days. We ended 
that with the Affordable Care Act. We 
ended it with ObamaCare. And now the 
Republicans, again, want the insurance 
industry to have that power over your 
life. As of this morning, 6 million 
Americans have been reported as diag-
nosed with COVID–19. Trust me, the in-
surance industry would make that a 
preexisting condition for them and for 
any others in the future who should 
turn up positive on these COVID–19 
tests. 
What the Republicans are seeking to 
do in the Supreme Court is what they 
failed to do on the floor of the Senate. 
They tried on the Senate floor many 
times—and the last time is well re-
membered—to end the Affordable Care 
Act. Those of us who were here that 
night watched as a handful—perhaps 
three—Republican Senators said no. 
We all remember that moment after he 
had been on the phone with President 
Trump when John McCain, the late 
Senator from Arizona, came through 
those doors at 2:30 in the morning and 
cast his ‘‘no’’ vote in the well of the 
Senate Chamber. I was there just a few 
feet away and watched every second of 
it. It was gripping. It was exciting. For 
many people, it was giving them an-
other chance to protect themselves 
with health insurance, something the 
other Republicans were determined to 
eliminate. 
John McCain said then and we say 
now: If you have a better idea on the 
Republican side—President Trump, if 
you have a better idea than the ACA— 
let’s see it. How many times has this 
President made an empty promise: We 
have a substitute; I will give it to you 
in a week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks. They don’t 
have one. 
Recently, at a hearing before the Ap-
propriations Subcommittee, I asked

three leading health experts and doc-
tors in the Trump administration if 
any of them had worked on the so- 
called Republican substitute. Not a 
one. It doesn’t exist. It is just an 
empty answer and an imperfect answer, 
at best, from this administration. 
I remember February 13, 2016, when 
Justice Scalia just passed away in a 
Presidential election year and Senator 
MCCONNELL
said, to the surprise of 
many of us, the following: 
The American people should have a voice 
in the selection of their next Supreme Court 
Justice. Therefore, this vacancy [the Scalia 
vacancy] should not be filled until we have a 
new President. 
He stated the McConnell rule in Feb-
ruary of 2016, an election year. Here it 
is: 
The American people should have a voice 
in the selection of their next Supreme Court 
Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not 
be filled until we have a new President. 
It is pretty clear, isn’t it? 
Well, Republican Senators all lined 
up behind him in this new statement of 
principle and denied Merrick Garland 
not only a hearing but even the cour-
tesy of an office appointment for most 
of them. The McConnell rule is clear 
and unambiguous, and the 2016 Repub-
licans dutifully fell in line behind it. 
They said that the American people 
should have the last word. An election 
year Supreme Court vacancy should be 
filled in the next Presidential term. 
Senator MCCONNELL claims that his 
rule really had an asterisk at the end. 
I don’t see one. He said it really de-
pends on which party controls the Sen-
ate. Well, that is certainly a distinc-
tion without a difference. Why should 
the composition of the Senate dictate 
whether or not the American people 
‘‘should have a voice in the selection of 
their next Supreme Court Justice’’? Ei-
ther the American people have a voice 
regarding the future of the Court when 
there is a vacancy in an election year 
or they don’t. 
Four years ago, Senator MCCONNELL 
said they do. Now he says they don’t. It 
is a flip-flop and, oh, the painful con-
tortions I see among most Republican 
Senators trying to rationalize posing 
for holy pictures 4 years ago, saying 
that the American people should have 
the last word and then 4 years later, 
completely reversing themselves—but 
they do. 
This is not just some Washington de-
bate. The stakes in this debate are im-
portant for every American. It isn’t 
about who gets the last word on 
MSNBC or FOX; it is about who gets 
the last word when you learn someone 
in your family has a devastating illness 
and you are praying to God you have a 
health insurance plan that will cover 
it. 
President Trump has made clear he 
wants to strike down the entire Afford-
able Care Act even without a sub-
stitute. That is the position the Trump 
administration took before the Su-
preme Court in a case that will be ar-
gued just days after this November 3 
election. 
President Trump has also made it 
clear that when he picks a new Su-
preme Court Justice, he wants them to 
agree with him when it comes to elimi-
nating the Affordable Care Act. 
I would say to people across America: 
Be prepared. If MITCH MCCONNELL gets 
his way, if Donald Trump gets his way, 
if they install a new Supreme Court 
Justice who has taken this oath—this 
political oath to following the Trump 
plan—all of America will be at risk be-
cause the protections of the Affordable 
Care Act will be eliminated by that Su-
preme Court. 
In 2015, Donald Trump tweeted, as he 
often does: ‘‘If I win the Presidency, 
my judicial appointments will do the 
right thing unlike Bush’s appointee 
John Roberts on ObamaCare.’’ We cer-
tainly know what that means because 
at least on one occasion, John Roberts 
has kept ObamaCare alive. 
Let’s be clear. The Affordable Care 
Act is hanging in the balance in just a 
few days. The healthcare coverage and 
protections for preexisting conditions 
that millions of American families rely 
on are at risk. Republicans were never 
able to repeal the Affordable Care Act 
in the House or on the floor of the Sen-
ate—thank you, John McCain—so they 
want to do it in the Court. They are 
trying to accomplish in the Supreme 
Court what they cannot accomplish in 
Congress. If President Trump and Sen-
ator MCCONNELL go through with their 
plan to jam through a Supreme Court 
nominee this year, the Affordable Care 
Act is doomed. 
Did you hear last night when the 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee announced—I saw it this morn-
ing on television. He announced that 
every single Republican Senator on the 
Senate Judiciary Committee is going 
to vote for the Trump nominee for the 
Supreme Court. We don’t have a nomi-
nee yet, do we? The President said he 
will not announce one until Saturday 
of this week. Here is this announce-
ment by the Republican chairman of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee: He’s 
counted the votes. It is a done deal. 
What does it tell you? It tells you it 
doesn’t make any difference whom the 
President nominates—the silence of 
the lambs in the U.S. Senate. 
If President Trump and Senator 
MCCONNELL go through with this plan, 
America will feel it, and every family 
will know it. That is why my Repub-
lican colleagues refuse to give the 
American people the last word on No-
vember 3. They are so uncertain of the 
reelection of Donald Trump, they have 
to do this now, quickly. They are 
afraid he will not be renominated, that 
he will not be reelected, and that he 
will not be in a position to fill this va-
cancy next year. So they are breaking 
their own promise to the American 
people to respect their judgment in the 
selection of the Supreme Court nomi-
nee. 
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 
Madam President, we know what is 
at stake as well in terms of this Na-
tion. There are 200,000 Americans—that 
number is likely to be confirmed in 
just a matter of hours, if not days— 
who have died of COVID–19. 
You say to yourself: Well, it is a 
global pandemic, and people are dying 
everywhere. 
That is true, but the rate of death in 
America, sadly, leads the world. It is 
not an indication of American great-
ness that the infection rate from 
COVID–19 in the United States of 
America is five times what it is in Ger-
many. It is not an indication of Amer-
ican greatness when the infection rate 
in the United States is twice what it is 
in Canada. It is not a reflection of the 
greatness of America that, with 41⁄2 
percent of the global population, we 
have 20 percent of the people who have 
died from this pandemic. This Presi-
dent and this administration have ut-
terly failed when it has come to this 
public health crisis—one of the most 
challenging in a century. 
For the 6 million people who have 
been infected with this COVID virus in 
America, we pray that they will re-
cover fully, but we know, in many 
cases, they will not. We know that, 
without the protection in the Afford-
able Care Act, many insurers will 
refuse to issue policies to these people 
in the future if the Republicans have 
their way and eliminate the Affordable 
Care Act. 
Amy, of Huntley, IL, recently wrote 
to me: 
Please save the ACA. Without it, caps will 
come back, and, with them, my children’s 
mental health care coverage will essentially 
disappear. I have three children, each with 
varying mental health disabilities. Before 
the Affordable Care Act, our Blue Cross-Blue 
Shield plan had a maximum family lifetime 
cap of 100 mental health care visits. 
A lifetime cap, she says, of 100 visits. 
That is it. When the ACA was passed, it 
was like a tremendous weight had been 
taken off our family. 
Young adults, incidentally, up to the 
age of 26 are protected by their fami-
lies’ health insurance under the Afford-
able Care Act. If the Trump adminis-
tration, MITCH
MCCONNELL, and the 
new Supreme Court nominee have their 
way, that would end. Insurance plans 
would no longer have to cover prescrip-
tion drugs, maternity care, mental 
health, or addiction treatment. While 
still facing the opioid crisis, elimi-
nating the Affordable Care Act would 
eliminate the guarantee that your son, 
your daughter, or someone in your 
family who is facing the addiction of 
this terrible drug would have coverage 
when it comes to addiction treatment. 
Misty, of Gurnee, IL, wrote: 
In a time where my husband is unemployed 
and I’ve been quarantined . . . losing our 
health care now would be absolutely dev-
astating for my family. My husband and I 
are both on daily prescription meds, and we 
have two daughters who desperately need 
health care coverage as well. I am asking 
you to protect the Affordable Care Act. 
Misty, I am going to protect the Af-
fordable Care Act by opposing Presi-
dent Trump’s Supreme Court nominee

because he has promised us that the 
nominee will eliminate the Affordable 
Care Act. I could not in good con-
science support such a nominee. 
When the Affordable Care Act goes 
away, as the Republicans are seeking 
to achieve in court and now on the 
floor of the Senate, Medicare would 
face insolvency sooner—at least 1 year 
sooner—and seniors would be charged 
more for prescription drugs. Hospitals 
in Illinois, especially downstate and 
inner city hospitals, would see signifi-
cant revenue losses from the elimi-
nation of Medicaid expansion. 
This is the real world, and the people 
who are writing to my office are doing 
so of their own volition to let me know 
what they face. This isn’t just a matter 
of big shots in Washington who are 
fighting with one another to see who 
can get more camera time. It isn’t a 
question of who is going to appear 
more on the cable TV shows. It is a 
question of whether we care about the 
families we represent. 
Most families, my own included, have 
been through this. I know the sleepless 
nights when you worry about whether 
you have health insurance. I know 
what it is like to be the father of a new 
baby who has serious medical condi-
tions and to have no insurance at all. I 
have faced it, and I will never forget it. 
I will never forget the families who 
sent me to Washington to remember 
them as well. 
This is about more than who gets 
bragging rights politically at the end 
of the day; it is about the right of 
every American family to have peace 
of mind in knowing they have quality, 
affordable, accessible health insurance 
coverage.

ator from Florida. 
REQUEST FOR COMMITTEE TO MEET 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Intel-
ligence Committee be authorized to 
meet today with the Director of Na-
tional Counterintelligence, and he is 
also leading the election security ef-
forts on behalf of the Office of the Di-
rector of National Intelligence—that 
that meeting occur during today’s ses-
sion of the Senate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). Is there objection? 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right 
to object. Because the Senate Repub-
licans have no respect for the institu-
tion, we will not have business as usual 
here in the Senate, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, if I may, 
just for a moment, just for the infor-
mation of the Members, then, who are 
on the committee, we will not be hav-
ing the hearing today on the issue of 
election security with the person lead-
ing that effort. It is a priority of many 
here. 
We are scheduled to have the Direc-
tor of National Intelligence tomorrow 
to discuss that and many more topics 
of great importance that I know a lot 
of people here have been saying we 
need to be having briefings over. I hope 
that if, in fact, the Democratic leader 
intends to object to that, that we 
should know that today as well, I hope, 
so that the Members will know that 
and make arrangements accordingly. 
I yield the floor. 
VOTE ON LUCAS NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, all postcloture time 
has expired on the Lucas nomination. 
The question is, Shall the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Lucas nomina-
tion? 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
ask for the yeas and nays.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
over the course of her extraordinary 
life, Justice Ginsburg did as much to 
advance the cause of justice as she 
could manage. She was a trailblazer of 
women from all ages, from all walks of 
life, who watched her tear down the 
barriers 
that 
separated 
men 
from 
women, first from outside the corridors 
of power, then within them. 
As I said this morning, it is only fit-
ting that she will be the first woman to 
ever lie in state at the Nation’s Cap-
itol. After all, she made a life’s work

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5741 
September 22, 2020 
out of going where women had not gone 
before. 
I rise now to offer a resolution that 
will honor her long and illustrious ca-
reer. Republicans came to us with this 
resolution, but it ignored Justice Gins-
burg’s dying wish, what she called her 
most fervent wish, that she not be re-
placed until the new President is in-
stalled. We simply have added to the 
exact same text of the resolution the 
Republicans gave us. 
All the kind words and lamentations 
about Justice Ginsburg from the Re-
publican 
majority 
will 
be 
totally 
empty if those Republicans ignore her 
dying wish and instead move to replace 
her with someone who will tear down 
everything she built; someone who 
could turn the clock back on a wom-
an’s right to choose; someone who 
could turn back the clock on marriage 
equality; someone who would make it 
impossible to join a union; someone 
who could take healthcare away from 
tens of millions of Americans, send 
drug prices soaring, and rip away pro-
tections for up to 130 million Ameri-
cans with preexisting conditions. That 
is what we are talking about when we 
talk about this vacancy. 
For hundreds of millions of Ameri-
cans, everything is on the line. Perhaps 
that is why Justice Ginsburg expressed 
her ‘‘fervent’’ wish that she not be re-
placed until the next President is in-
stalled. She knew how important the 
Supreme Court was in American life, 
and she knew there would be great 
temptation to take advantage of the 
timing of her death for political pur-
poses. She knew the risks of her va-
cancy turning into a power game driv-
en by rank partisanship, so she ex-
pressed a simple idea: Let the next 
President decide, whoever it might be. 
It could be President Trump, it could 
be Vice President Biden, but let the 
next President decide. 
Don’t rush a nominee through mere 
days before an election in what is sure 
to be the most controversial and par-
tisan Supreme Court nomination in our 
Nation’s entire history. 
Maybe Justice Ginsburg hoped that 
her dying wish could save the Senate 
majority from itself. It doesn’t appear 
that way, but here on the floor this 
afternoon, we ask our colleagues to ac-
knowledge her entire life and legacy, 
including her dying wish. 
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of the 
Schumer resolution related to the 
death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Asso-
ciate Justice of the Supreme Court of 
the United States, which is at the desk. 
I further ask that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, 
and that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, this endeavor started with a reso-
lution that the majority put forward 
that was intended to be a bipartisan 
resolution commemorating the life and 
service of Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg. That follows the bipartisan tradi-
tion this body has followed in com-
memorating Justices when they have 
passed. 
Unfortunately, the Democratic lead-
er has put forth an amendment to turn 
that bipartisan resolution into a par-
tisan 
resolution. 
Specifically, 
the 
Democratic leader wants to add a 
statement that Justice Ginsburg’s po-
sition should not be filled until a new 
President 
is 
installed, 
purportedly 
based on a comment made to family 
members shortly before she passed. 
That, of course, is not the standard. 
Under the Constitution, members of 
the Judiciary do not appoint their own 
successors. No article III judge has the 
authority to appoint his or her own 
successor. Rather, judicial nominations 
are made by the President of the 
United States, and confirmations are 
made by this body, the U.S. Senate. 
I would note that Justice Ginsburg 
was someone whom I knew personally. 
I argued nine times before Justice 
Ginsburg at the Supreme Court. She 
led an extraordinary life. She was one 
of the finest Supreme Court litigators 
to have ever practiced. She served 27 
years on the Court, leaving a profound 
legacy. Justice Ginsburg understood 
full well that the position being put 
forth by the Democratic leader is not 
the law and is not the Constitution. In-
deed, I will quote what Justice Gins-
burg said just 4 years ago. 
Reported in the Washington Post on 
September 7, 2016, Justice Ginsburg is 
reported to have said: 
The president is elected for four years not 
three years, so the power he has in year 
three continues into year four. Maybe mem-
bers of the Senate will wake up and appre-
ciate that that’s how it should be. 
Now, of course, when Justice Gins-
burg said that, that was when Presi-
dent Obama had made the nomination 
of Merrick Garland to the Supreme 
Court, and the Senate had declined to 
consider 
that 
nomination. 
Without 
even a hint of irony, every Democrat 
who is now screaming from the ram-
parts that we cannot consider a va-
cancy on the Court during this election 
year was screaming equally as loudly 
from the ramparts that we must con-
sider a nomination during a Presi-
dential election year just 4 years ago. 
Joe Biden vociferously called for the 
Senate to consider that nomination. 
Barack Obama called for the Senate to 
consider that nomination. Hillary Clin-
ton called for the Senate to consider 
that nomination. The Democratic lead-
er said the Senate was not doing its job 
if we didn’t consider that nomination. 
To my knowledge, every Democratic 
Member of this body, likewise, decried 
the decision not to take up that nomi-
nation and insisted the Senate was not 
doing its job. 
Well, today, obviously, the situation 
has changed, whereby all of those 
Democratic Members who demanded 
the Senate take up a nomination to the 
Supreme Court are now demanding the 
Senate not take up a nomination to 
the Supreme Court. 
To be sure, the Republican majority 
that declined to consider that nomina-
tion is now going to take up President 
Trump’s nomination to this vacancy, 
but I would note the circumstances are 
markedly different, and history and 
more than two centuries of precedent 
are on the side of what this Senate will 
do. 
The question of whether a President 
should nominate a Supreme Court Jus-
tice to fill a vacancy that occurred dur-
ing a Presidential election year has oc-
curred 29 times in our Nation’s history. 
This is not new—29 times. Of those 29 
times, 
Presidents 
of 
both 
parties, 
Democrats and Republicans, have nom-
inated Justices 29 times. Every single 
time there has been a vacancy during a 
Presidential year, a President has nom-
inated a Justice to that vacancy. Of 
the 44 individuals who served as Presi-
dent of the United States, 22 have done 
so. Fully one half of the Presidents 
who have ever served this country have 
made Supreme Court nominations dur-
ing Presidential election years. 
So what is the difference? 
Well, there is a sharp difference in 
our Nation’s history depending upon 
whether the Senate is controlled by the 
same party as the President or a dif-
ferent party from the President. So, of 
the 29 times in history, in 19 of those 
times, the Senate and the Presidency 
were controlled by the same party. 
When that happened, the Senate took 
up and confirmed those nominees 17 of 
the 19 times. 
Do you want to ask what history 
shows this body does when the Presi-
dent and the Senate are of the same 
party and a nomination is made during 
a Presidential election year? This body 
takes up that nomination and, assum-
ing a qualified nominee, confirms that 
nominee. 
On the other hand, what happens 
when the President and the Senate are 
of different parties? Well, that has hap-
pened 10 times in our Nation’s history. 
In all 10 times, the President has made 
a 
nomination, 
but 
in 
those 
cir-
cumstances, the Senate has confirmed 
those nominees only twice, and 2016 
was one of those examples. 
Now, the Democratic leader gave a 
passionate speech, which I know he be-
lieves, about what kind of Justice he 
would like to see on the Court. Demo-
cratic Members of this body have long 
championed 
judicial 
activists 
who 
would embrace a view of the Constitu-
tion that, I believe, would do serious 
damage to the constitutional liberties 
of the American people. 
The 
interesting 
thing 
about 
the 
Democratic leader’s speech is that the 
argument was presented to the voters, 
and the voters disagreed. In 2016, Hil-
lary Clinton promised to nominate Jus-
tices just like the kind the Democratic

September 22, 2020 
leader said he wanted to see, and Presi-
dent Trump promised to nominate Jus-
tices ‘‘in the mold of Justice Scalia and 
Justice Thomas.’’ The American people 
had that issue squarely before them, 
and the voters chose that we wanted 
constitutionalist judges nominated to 
the Supreme Court. It was not only re-
garding the Presidential election but 
the Senate majority. The American 
people voted for a Republican majority 
in the Senate in 2014. The American 
people voted for a Republican majority 
again in 2016, and, in 2018, the Amer-
ican people grew our majority. 
In all three of those elections, the 
question that the Democratic leader 
has put forward was directly before the 
voters. What kind of Justices do you 
want? The voters clearly decided and 
had given a mandate. 
The President has said he is going to 
nominate a Justice this week. That is 
the right thing to do. This body, I be-
lieve, will take up, will consider, that 
nomination on the merits, and I believe 
we will confirm that nominee before 
election day. That is consistent with 
over 200 years of Senate precedent from 
both parties. 
There is, however, something that 
the Democratic leaders and Demo-
cratic Members of this body are threat-
ening that is not consistent with his-
tory or precedent or a respect for the 
Constitution, and that is, namely, a 
threat to pack the Supreme Court. We 
have heard multiple Democrats say 
that, if the Senate confirms this nomi-
nee and the Democrats take the major-
ity next year, they will try to add two 
or four—or who knows how many—Jus-
tices to the Supreme Court. Well, you 
know, there was another Democratic 
President who tried to do that—FDR. 
Even though he had a supermajority, 
the Democratic Congress rejected his 
efforts as an effort to politicize the Su-
preme Court. 
Since the Democratic leader believes 
we should follow the wishes of Justice 
Ginsburg, I think it is worth reflecting 
on what Justice Ginsburg said about 
this. She was asked about this in an 
interview with NPR, and her statement 
was as follows: 
Nine seems to be a good number. It’s been 
that way for a long time. I think it was a bad 
idea when President Franklin Roosevelt 
tried to pack the court. 
Well, unfortunately, it seems the 
Democratic 
leader 
and 
Democratic 
Senators are repeating the partisan 
mistakes 
of 
their 
predecessors 
in 
threatening the Court and threatening 
to pack the Court, which would be 
truly a radical and bad idea, as Justice 
Ginsburg explained. 
Accordingly, what I am going to do is 
propose 
modifying 
the 
Democratic 
leader’s resolution to delete his call 
that we leave this vacancy open, that 
we leave the Court with just eight Jus-
tices, which opens up the possibility of 
a 4-to-4 tie, not able to resolve a con-
tested election, and leaving this coun-
try for weeks and months in chaos if 
we have a contested election in Novem-
ber. Instead, let’s replace in the resolu-
tion the quote from Justice Ginsburg 
that packing the Court is a bad idea 
and have the Senate agree that pack-
ing the Court is a bad idea. 
I am confident that, when I ask the 
Democratic leader, he is going to reject 
this because we are, sadly, seeing one 
side of the aisle embrace more and 
more dangerous and radical proposals, 
including trying to use brute political 
force to politicize the Court. That is 
neither consistent with the Constitu-
tion nor is it consistent with two cen-
turies of this body’s precedent. 
Accordingly, I ask that the Senator 
modify his request and, instead, take 
up my resolution at the desk. I further 
ask that the resolution be agreed to, 
the preamble be agreed to, and the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I believe 
Justice Ginsburg would have easily 
seen through the legal sophistry of the 
argument of the junior Senator from 
Texas. To turn Justice Ginsburg’s 
dying words against her is so, so be-
neath the dignity of this body. 
I do not modify. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the original request? 
Mr. CRUZ. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
BIDEN TAX PLAN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
last week, former Vice President Biden 
released his Presidential tax plan. I 
wish he would release the list of people 
he is going to put on the Supreme 
Court, like he said he was going to do 
in June. He hasn’t done that, and, I 
think, yesterday, he said he wasn’t 
going to do it, but we do have his high- 
tax plan. 
He has vowed to raise taxes imme-
diately on U.S. businesses even though 
our country is recovering from the 
worst economic crisis since the Great 
Depression. Usually, when you are in 
that economic condition, you don’t 
raise taxes, and the very last thing 
struggling Americans need, and par-
ticularly the businesses that create the 
jobs, is a massive tax increase at this 
time. Of course, Mr. Biden’s tax plan 
shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone. 
His party seems to think the answer to 
every problem in America is to raise 
taxes and spend more money. 
When he was Vice President, the U.S. 
corporate tax rate was the highest in 
the industrialized world. It isn’t now 
because of President Trump’s tax pro-
posals and the tax reform legislation 
we passed December 2017. Prior to tax 
reform, U.S. companies were not com-
petitive with their foreign counter-
parts. And there were constant head-
lines about companies that were mov-
ing their headquarters overseas, large-
ly because of our outdated tax system. 
In fact, a number of Mr. Biden’s pro-
posals make me think that he is reliv-
ing his time as Vice President. His plan 
to increase the corporate tax rate from 
21 to 28 would very quickly take us 
back to those days. Once again, this 
country would be saddled with the 
highest business tax rates in the indus-
trialized world, taking into account 
Federal and State taxes in this coun-
try. U.S. companies, both large and 
small, would see higher taxes than 
their foreign competitors in France, 
Germany, the UK, and other major 
trading partners. In some cases, those 
taxes would be as much as 15 percent-
age points higher. 
Mr. Biden says our tax system en-
courages offshoring, profit shifting, 
and inversions. Back when he was Vice 
President, those things actually hap-
pened: offshoring, profit shifting, and 
inversions. 
When Mr. Biden was Vice President, 
the U.S. tax law allowed companies to 
defer their foreign earnings until they 
were brought back to the United 
States. Why would you bring them 
back when we had the highest tax rate 
in the industrialized world? 
That system allowed many compa-
nies to delay paying taxes on their for-
eign earnings, and in some cases, that 
could be indefinitely. 
As part of tax reform, we specifically 
sought to end the parking of profits 
overseas. We wanted that money to 
come home so that money would be in-
vested in this country and would create 
jobs. 
That is why we enacted the tax on 
global intangible low-tax income—or 
GILTI, as it is referred to—which im-
poses a minimum tax on foreign earn-
ings in low-tax countries. 
And when Biden was Vice President, 
there were plenty of opportunities for 
what we call base erosion. That is why 
we created the base erosion anti-abuse 
tax—or the BEAT, as it is called— 
which 
targets 
deductible 
payments 
made to foreign affiliates. We also im-
posed limits on the deductibility of in-
terest. 
Together, these policies addressed 
loopholes so companies can’t erode the 
U.S. tax base and avoid taxes. 
While tax reform cracked down on 
notable abuses, it also had the positive 
effect of making the United States a 
far more attractive place to invest— 
not only for profits of U.S. companies 
coming home but for foreign invest-
ment in America as well. 
We created the foreign-derived intan-
gible income rules to incentivize com-
panies to keep intellectual property in 
this country, not abroad. 
We also allowed immediate expensing 
of investments to encourage companies 
to put their facilities and jobs here on 
U.S. soil. And President Trump has 
gone way beyond the new tax law to 
provide incentives to get industry back 
to this country. 
Now, Mr. Biden may be harkening 
back to 2014, but let’s all remember 
that companies then were announcing

left and right their plans to invert or 
move their headquarters overseas, but 
since our 2017 Trump tax reform, I 
haven’t heard of any companies with 
inversion plans. Quite the opposite, 
companies have called off inversions 
and even brought back operations to 
this country, and they are citing our 
tax reform as the main reason for 
doing it. So why would Mr. Biden want 
to undo that? 
Even 
more 
curious 
is 
that 
Mr. 
Biden’s own talking points suggest 
that he supports a number of our tax 
reform policies in that 2017 bill. 
Kimberly Clausing, who reportedly 
advises Mr. Biden on tax policy, has 
said the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ‘‘should 
be commended for providing some lim-
its on tax avoidance through the GILTI 
and the BEAT.’’ 
What is more, Ms. Clausing has esti-
mated the new rules under the 2017 tax 
bill will result in a 20-percent decrease 
in shifting profits overseas. 
That is consistent with the Joint 
Committee 
on 
Taxation’s 
macro-
economic estimate in 2017 that found 
that tax reform would reduce profit 
shifting and increase the U.S. tax base. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Biden wants to 
double down on increasing taxes on 
U.S. businesses and, in fact, undo the 
progress that we have seen since tax 
reform in 2017. 
In addition to higher taxes on domes-
tic earnings, he also wants to increase 
the rate on U.S. companies’ foreign 
earnings to 21 percent. That is almost 
double the 12.5-percent rate that the 
OECD is targeting for its global min-
imum tax. 
I guess the former Vice President 
wants to ensure that no country can 
top the United States when it comes to 
the highest tax rates possible. 
And that is not all. Mr. Biden pro-
poses an additional 10-percent penalty 
on goods and services imported by U.S. 
companies from foreign affiliates. 
Now, even the Washington Post edi-
torial board noted earlier this month 
that Vice President Biden’s policy sim-
ply ignores the reality of global supply 
chains. 
Do we, in fact, really want to encour-
age foreign countries to tax goods and 
services imported from the United 
States? That could be a slippery slope. 
The truth is, Mr. Biden is trying to 
fix problems from the last administra-
tion. Republicans already met that 
challenge, and tax reform of 2017 is 
working. 
Data from the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis clearly shows that tax reform 
stemmed the flood of offshoring, while 
encouraging U.S. companies to invest 
right here in the United States. 
In fact, among U.S. multinationals, 
employment investment, research, and 
production in the United States has in-
creased at a faster rate in 2018 than the 
average rate over the past 20 years— 
faster than the growth rate of U.S. 
multinational 
companies 
that 
are 
abroad. 
Of course, there is more work to be 
done. But tax reform has made this 
country a more attractive place for 
businesses to headquarter, invest, and 
create jobs. 
Now, if the former Vice President 
succeeds in his plans, it will not just be 
our businesses that will bear the brunt. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation 
and Congressional Budget Office have 
both concluded that 25 percent of the 
corporate tax is borne by workers. So 
workers will be hurt. They will feel the 
burden of the Biden plan thorough 
fewer jobs, through reduced wages, and 
through less benefits. 
Above all, the Biden tax plan ignores 
the reality of today. We are trying to 
see our way out of the global pandemic. 
Undoing the progress that we have 
made through tax reform, especially 
now, is certainly not a prescription for 
economic recovery and growth. 
What is more, the Vice President’s 
plan will do nothing to speed the 
progress that we made reducing unem-
ployment since the height of the pan-
demic. Instead, it will do just the oppo-
site, work against it. 
The Biden tax increases wouldn’t be 
good policy in the best of conditions, 
but they are certainly bad policy right 
now because of the economic hardship 
caused by the pandemic. 
If Mr. Biden really wants to keep liv-
ing in the Obama era, he should recall 
President Obama’s sound advice on tax 
policy during a crisis, the financial cri-
sis of 2009 and 2010, when President 
Obama said this: ‘‘The last thing you 
want to do is raise taxes in the middle 
of a recession.’’ 
That is something we should all be 
able to agree upon. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. COTTON. I yield the floor.

SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
our Nation has suffered a historic loss 
in the passing of legal giant Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and I fear the 
rush to replace her with just 44 days 
left before the next Presidential elec-
tion will have grave consequences for 
the lives of millions of Americans. 
As tempting as it is, I am not here to 
talk about the stunning hypocrisy of 
my Republican colleagues who once op-
posed filling any Supreme Court va-
cancy during a Presidential election 
year now changing the reasons for 
doing so like a willow in the wind. 
Well, make no mistake, their willing-
ness to abandon their word in the 
naked pursuit of power and deny the 
American people a voice in this process 
is truly stunning. Today, I want to talk 
about the consequences of their hypoc-
risy, not for our process here in the 
Senate but, rather, for the lives and 
livelihoods 
of 
millions 
of 
families 
across this Nation. 
Everything Americans care about 
and depend on is on the line, starting 
first 
and 
foremost 
with 
their 
healthcare. President Trump has al-
ready declared that whoever his nomi-
nee is, his nominee to the Court will 
vote to ‘‘terminate’’ the Affordable 
Care Act and reverse Roe v. Wade. 
The Trump administration is closer 
than ever to tearing healthcare away 
from millions of people by overturning 
the law that gave it to them in the 
first place. It is especially outrageous 
to see the administration threaten the 
healthcare of millions of Americans at 
this perilous moment in our history— 
with nothing, by the way, to replace it. 
Since the passage of the Affordable 
Care Act, they have said they have a 
better plan. Well, now 11 years later or 
so, maybe almost 12 years, we have yet 
to see what that plan is. 
We are in the midst of a deadly, once- 
in-a-century pandemic. A staggering 
200,000 Americans—fathers and moth-
ers, sisters and brothers, dear friends 
and beloved grandparents—are gone 
forever. Meanwhile, millions of people 
nationwide 
are 
infected 
with 
the 
coronavirus. To this day, many sur-
vivors of COVID–19 are grappling with 
lasting healthcare challenges, from 
chronic shortness of breath to lifelong 
scar tissue in their lungs. 
We are still learning about the long- 
term health impacts of contracting 
COVID–19, but here is one thing we do 
know: Every single one of these sur-
vivors now has a preexisting condition 
that makes them vulnerable to insur-
ance company discrimination without 
the protections guaranteed by the Af-
fordable Care Act. That is in addition 
to the estimated 135 million Americans 
who already live with common pre-
existing conditions like chronic asth-
ma, diabetes, and high blood pressure, 
to mention a few. 
Remember what it was like before 
the Affordable Care Act? A health in-
surance company could refuse to cover 
you or provide your care or even kick 
you off your plan due to your medical 
history. A child born at birth with a 
birth defect couldn’t get health insur-
ance. The husband who had a heart at-
tack couldn’t get health insurance. A 
woman with cervical cancer couldn’t 
get health insurance afterward—a pre-
existing condition. We don’t want to go 
back to those days, but that is exactly 
where the Trump administration will 
take us should they prevail at the Su-
preme Court, as this case is pending be-
fore the Supreme Court. 
Now, despite what they say, the Re-
publican mission has been clear for a 
decade: to kill the Affordable Care Act, 
to strip away healthcare from millions 
of Americans, all the while lying about 
how they will protect individuals with 
preexisting conditions. It is shameless. 
Just as dangerous is the prospect of a 
Supreme Court that will overturn Roe 
v. Wade and roll back the reproductive 
rights of women. That is what is at 
stake with this Supreme Court seat— 
the basic principle that women have a

right to make their own private med-
ical decisions. The American people 
overwhelmingly believe that women, 
not the government, should be allowed 
to decide when they have children. 
There is no question that the right to 
choose is inseparable from the past 
half-century of progress achieved for 
women’s equality in the United States. 
It is that progress that Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg devoted her entire 
life’s work to advancing—the right to 
pursue their own destinies with full 
equality under the law. 
It is not just healthcare that is on 
the line; it is our voting rights, our 
civil rights, workers’ rights, immigrant 
rights, and LGBTQ rights as well. More 
than that, it is the right of the Amer-
ican people to see their elected rep-
resentatives enact the kinds of policies 
they support, like bold action on cli-
mate change without corporate-backed 
challenges 
at 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
undoing their wishes. 
A Supreme Court nominee has never 
been confirmed this close to a Presi-
dential election. Americans are already 
voting as we speak. Should my col-
leagues in the majority abandon all 
their prior commitments and deny the 
American people the opportunity to 
make their voices heard, I fear we 
could do lasting damage to the legit-
imacy of the Supreme Court. 
This is an institution that rests on 
the trust and reverence of the Amer-
ican people. Losing that trust and rev-
erence is dangerous. It is dangerous. It 
is dangerous for millions of people who 
will lose the Affordable Care Act’s pro-
tections. It is dangerous for women 
who could lose their right to choose 
and all of us who do not want to turn 
back a half-century of progress. It is 
dangerous for our economy at a time 
when American workers and consumers 
find themselves at the mercy of cor-
porations that have grown larger and 
more powerful than at any other time 
since the Gilded Age. It is dangerous 
for the future of our planet and safety 
of our climate at a time when the West 
is burning, seas are rising, and the 
Earth is warming faster than ever be-
fore. Quite frankly, it is dangerous for 
our democracy. 
We owe the American people a voice 
and a decision that will shape the 
course of history for generations. We 
owe the memory of Ruth Bader Gins-
burg and her seat on the Supreme 
Court more than just another political 
power grab. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, last Friday, our country lost a 
trailblazer for equality, a moral giant, 
and a lover of justice—the great Jus-
tice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, affection-
ately known as RBG. While physically 
small, she had a towering impact on 
American jurisprudence. While the vol-
ume of her voice was not high, her 
words carried farther and had a greater 
impact than the louder voices that 
were often around her. 
She famously observed that many of 
the laws on the books that pretended 
to put women on a pedestal actually 
put them in cages, and then she pro-
ceeded to bring cases to strike down 
those discriminatory walls. She trans-
formed America’s legal landscape, es-
pecially in the area of gender equality, 
and that was before she was even ap-
pointed and confirmed to the Supreme 
Court. 
On the Supreme Court, with intel-
ligence and persuasion, she was often 
able to bring others to her point of 
view, and when she couldn’t, she could 
write a stinging dissent, which she 
viewed as a conversation with the fu-
ture. She had optimism in our Nation’s 
pursuit of justice—that her dissents 
would be vindicated in time, and I dare 
say that they already have in so many 
cases, including her dissent in the vot-
ing rights case with the reprehensible 
2013 decision where, on a 5-to-4 vote, 
the Supreme Court took a bite out of 
the Voting Rights Act. She predicted 
that as soon as that happened, many of 
the States that had been subject to the 
preclearance provisions would begin to 
put up barriers to voting, and that is 
exactly what happened. 
Speaking of the future, her deathbed 
wish 
communicated 
to 
her 
grand-
daughter—her most fervent wish—was 
that she not be replaced until a new 
President is installed, whoever that 
President may be. 
She died last Friday on Rosh Hasha-
nah. It was a moment when the coun-
try needed to come together to cele-
brate her life and honor her legacy, and 
that is what so many people did around 
the country. We saw an outpouring of 
support from coast to coast, north to 
south, east to west. We saw large 
crowds 
gathering 
at 
the 
Supreme 
Court. But here in the U.S. Senate, the 
majority leader didn’t have the de-
cency to even provide a respectful 
pause, a respectful timeout to honor 
that legacy. Just over 1 hour after her 
death was announced, he put out a 
statement announcing his power play— 
a statement saying that President 
Trump’s nominee, whoever it may be 
to replace her, would get a vote. The 
majority leader rushed to do that de-
spite taking the opposite position in 
March of 2016 when Justice Scalia 
passed away and President Obama 
nominated Merrick Garland. 
The majority leader rushed to com-
mit to that vote on President Trump’s 
nominee even though, in the middle of 
this COVID–19 pandemic, we have not 
even had a chance to vote here in the 
Senate on the Heroes Act, which passed 
the House of Representatives over 4 
months ago, providing emergency com-
prehensive relief to families and work-
ers and small and medium-sized busi-
nesses that are hurting from this pan-
demic. We haven’t had a vote on that 
in 4 months. Yet, within 1 hour of Jus-
tice Ginsburg’s death, the Republican 
leader announced: ‘‘We will have a 
vote’’ on President Trump’s Supreme 
Court nominee. 
Our country just reached the grim 
total of 200,000 Americans dead from 
COVID–19. More Americans have died 
from COVID–19 than in any other coun-
try on the planet, and a big share of 
those dead are the direct result of 
President Trump’s calculated indiffer-
ence—what 
he 
describes 
as 
‘‘downplaying’’ 
the 
threat. 
Well, 
downplaying a known threat led to in-
action, and inaction led to thousands 
more Americans dying than would have 
been the case. That inaction has led to 
far more economic pain and fallout 
from COVID–19 than had to be the case. 
We wouldn’t have all of these schools 
closed right now if the President had 
taken more rapid action and if we had 
comprehensive 
universal 
and 
rapid 
testing. But here we are because 
Trump wanted to ‘‘downplay’’ the 
threat. 
The President has opposed the Heroes 
Act, which passed the House of Rep-
resentatives, and there is still no vote 
here in the Senate on that important 
legislation to help a country in need— 
so no vote on that. But, my goodness, 
they just couldn’t wait to announce, 
within 1 hour of the Justice’s passing 
away, that this Senate would vote on 
Trump’s Supreme Court nomination. 
That is despite what Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL said in 2016. When Justice 
Scalia 
passed 
away 
and 
President 
Obama nominated Merrick Garland to 
fill the seat, you heard Senator MCCON-
NELL and many Republicans say: Can’t 
do it. We are in the middle of an elec-
tion year. 
In fact, the majority leader went so 
far as to instruct his Republican Mem-
bers not even to meet with Merrick 
Garland. They didn’t even have a hear-
ing for Merrick Garland. The majority 
leader and so many Republican Sen-
ators said: Oh, we can’t do that because 
primary voting has begun in this 2016 
Presidential election year. Primary 
voting has begun. It is underway. It is 
important to let the American people 
weigh in on the Presidential election 
and then allow whoever wins that Pres-
idential election to make their nomi-
nation to the Supreme Court. 
That is what we heard from Senator 
MCCONNELL and so many of our Repub-
lican Senate colleagues back in 2016— 
that democracy required that the peo-
ple’s will be heard in the Presidential 
election year. 
Well, it turns out that all of that was 
just a pure political ploy; that we are 
going to see one set of rules for Demo-
cratic Presidents like Barack Obama 
and another set of rules from the Re-
publican 
majority 
for 
Republican 
Presidents like Donald Trump. The dis-
honesty and rank hypocrisy is obscene, 
and the American people, regardless of 
party, see it for what it is. 
But as bad as the hypocrisy and the 
dishonesty is, this is about even more 
than that. In fact, it is about much 
more than that. It is about the future 
direction of our country and the direc-
tion of justice in our Nation. It is 
about whether we have a Supreme

Court that truly stands for equal jus-
tice under law, as Justice Ginsburg did. 
It is about whether we will protect 
women’s rights, as Justice Ginsburg 
did throughout her career before and 
after being on the Supreme Court. 
We know where President Trump 
stands on that. We know he was asked 
during his Presidential campaign on 
national television about a woman’s 
right to reproductive freedom. He said 
that women who would choose to have 
an abortion should be punished—should 
be punished. And he has said that he 
will appoint a Justice who will make 
sure that is what happens. That is what 
he said. 
We are going to see a Justice who 
wants to strike down workers’ rights 
and protections, and we are going to 
see a Justice who wants to destroy the 
Affordable Care Act. 
The Affordable Care Act provides im-
portant protections to the American 
people during ordinary times. It is es-
pecially important now, as we face this 
COVID–19 pandemic. We know it has 
been the goal of President Trump and 
Republicans for years to destroy and 
overturn the Affordable Care Act. After 
all, I think many of us remember being 
right here on the Senate floor in the 
summer of 2017. The Speaker of the 
House, Paul Ryan, and a majority of 
Republicans in the House at that time 
had passed a law to overturn the Af-
fordable Care Act. President Trump 
was itching to sign it. But here in the 
Senate, we defeated that effort by one 
vote—one vote in the U.S. Senate. 
Why did that happen at the time? A 
lot of people thought it was a forgone 
conclusion that this Republican major-
ity Senate would vote to strike down 
the Affordable Care Act. It is because 
the American people rose up and said: 
Hell no. People with diabetes, cancer, 
heart disease, and other preexisting 
health conditions, and so many other 
Americans said: Do you know what? 
This isn’t a partisan issue. It is not a 
partisan issue if I have cancer or diabe-
tes or asthma or other preexisting con-
ditions. Don’t take it away. 
Guess what. COVID–19 is not a par-
tisan disease either. It will strike peo-
ple, of course, regardless of political 
party. 
So the American people got to the 
phones, got to social media, occupied 
people’s offices, and they said: Hell no. 
And by one vote, we protected the Af-
fordable Care Act here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
That should have been the end of the 
story, but it wasn’t because what Re-
publicans could not do through the 
democratic process here in the U.S. 
Senate, they decided to take to the 
courts. President Trump and his Attor-
ney General Barr are in court right 
now, trying to do there what they 
could not succeed in doing here in the 
U.S. Senate—trying to destroy and 
overturn the Affordable Care Act. 
Guess when the Supreme Court hear-
ing on that Affordable Care Act case is 
scheduled to take place: November 10— 
November 10, 1 week—1 week—after the 
November 3 election. 
So we see the power play here: Jam 
through a Supreme Court nominee. Put 
them on the Court in time for that 
hearing so they can hear the case and 
be part of overturning it. 
Make no mistake, President Trump 
has pledged to appoint a Supreme 
Court Justice who will knock down the 
Affordable Care Act. We don’t know 
who it is going to be, but we know it is 
going to be somebody who the Presi-
dent believes will strike down the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
How do we know that? Here is what 
Candidate Trump said: ‘‘If I win the 
presidency, my judicial appointments 
will do the right thing unlike Bush’s 
appointee 
John 
Roberts 
on 
ObamaCare.’’ That is Candidate Trump 
in June of 2015. 
Here is what Candidate Trump said 
on another occasion: 
I’m disappointed in [Justice] Roberts be-
cause he gave us ObamaCare. He had two 
chances to end ObamaCare. He could have 
ended it by every single measure and he 
didn’t do it, so [it is] disappointing. 
He says this on numerous occasions— 
numerous occasions. 
He also tweeted out that in 2012, he 
supported—this is 2012 when now-Sen-
ator ROMNEY was running for Presi-
dent. Donald Trump tweeted out then: 
I am 100 percent supporting MITT ROM-
NEY’s position that we need a Justice 
on 
the 
Court 
to 
strike 
down 
ObamaCare. 
So nobody should be playing any 
games. The President has told us he is 
going to nominate somebody to strike 
down the Affordable Care Act. That 
hearing is scheduled 1 week after the 
November 3 election. 
All of those issues are at stake right 
now. It appears that we have enough 
Republican Senators who have said 
that we will proceed to consider the 
nomination. They have abandoned the 
position that MITCH MCCONNELL, the 
Republican leader, and so many Sen-
ators 
took 
in 
2016 
with 
Barack 
Obama—President Obama—when they 
refused to provide a hearing. So we are 
going to proceed. But let’s remember 
the President has pledged that he will 
nominate somebody who will get rid of 
the Affordable Care Act and who will 
strike down a woman’s right to choose. 
That is what the President has said. 
Just as the American people began to 
get to the phones and on social media 
and to contact their Senators in the 
summer of 2017 when healthcare was at 
risk, when the Affordable Care Act was 
at risk, we need to make sure that the 
word gets out again. Back in 2017, we 
stopped that from happening by one 
vote in the U.S. Senate because the 
American people understood what was 
at stake. 
Here we are now, in a global pan-
demic. Instead of focusing on the pain 
the American people are feeling at the 
moment, instead of allowing us to vote 
on the Heroes Act, we have this Repub-
lican majority trying to power through 
a Supreme Court nominee to strike 
down the Affordable Care Act, to do 
through the courts what they were un-
successful doing here on the Senate 
floor in the summer of 2017. 
Let’s recognize the consequences of 
this abuse of power and the impact and 
harm it will do to the American people. 
Let’s take the advice and dying wish of 
Justice Ginsburg: Allow the American 
people to speak on November 3 and 
then allow whoever is sworn in on in-
auguration day in January to put for-
ward a nominee to be considered by the 
U.S. Senate. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Senator from Mississippi. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3072 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, in 
a few moments, I will ask unanimous 
consent for the Senate to take up and 
pass legislation I have introduced to 
protect women from harm and to pro-
tect their health. 
This is such an important issue to me 
as a Senator, as a woman, and as a 
mother. I am pleased several of my 
Senate colleagues have joined me on 
the floor to discuss this important 
issue, and I look forward to hearing 
their remarks as well. 
Twenty years ago this month, the 
Food and Drug Administration ap-
proved, for the very first time, the 
abortion pill known as mifepristone. It 
did so under the immense pressure 
from the Clinton administration and 
its pro-abortion allies. However, when 
the FDA approved this drug, it recog-
nized the serious risk of complications 
and life-threatening side effects that 
can be caused by this drug. Because of 
the risk of harm, and even death, the 
FDA put in place certain rules to pro-
tect the health of women. These rules 
are known as risk, evaluation, and 
mitigation strategies—or REMS for 
short—because they work to mitigate 
the risks posed by this drug to women. 
These commonsense rules require a 
woman to see a doctor to get the drug, 
to be fully informed of the potential 
side effects and how she can seek fol-
lowup treatment for those life-threat-
ening side effects, and to offer her in-
formed consent before being prescribed 
the drug. 
These simple, commonsense rules 
have been in place to protect the 
health of women for over 20 years. Rec-
ognizing their importance, I introduced 
the SAVE Moms and Babies Act last 
year to codify these rules into law to 
make sure they remain in place to pro-
tect women from these serious side ef-
fects. However, pro-abortion forces op-
pose even these basic protections for 
women’s health and have been working 
to undermine them, putting women at 
serious risk. 
This summer, a judge in Maryland 
issued a nationwide injunction can-
celing these REMS rules for the entire 
country. We knew this was coming. 
Back in April, I led 150 Members of 
Congress, including 38 Members of this

September 22, 2020 
body, in warning the FDA about this 
issue, and now pro-abortion advocates 
have found one activist judge to rule in 
their favor, putting women’s health at 
risk in the middle of a pandemic. 
Even with the REMS rules in place to 
protect women’s health, a substantial 
number of women end up needing life-
saving surgery or blood transfusions 
following chemical abortion. Sadly, 
some women have even died from these 
dangerous drugs. 
Make no mistake, no protections 
mean more adverse events for women. 
These protections ensure that a doctor 
could examine the woman to see if she 
has an ectopic pregnancy or is RH neg-
ative. These conditions can seriously 
increase the risk of harm to a woman 
taking this drug. 
No REMS protections means at-home 
abortion without medical oversight, 
putting women at risk of bleeding out 
and dying alone without a doctor to 
help her. No REMS protections mean 
that every State health and safety law 
that protects women from harm will be 
at risk. No REMS protections mean 
mail-order abortion without physicians 
providing the screenings recommended 
by the doctors and scientists at the 
FDA. 
That is why it is more important 
than ever to pass my bill, the SAVE 
Moms and Babies Act, to codify into 
law the important FDA REMS rules 
that protect women from the dangers 
inherent in mail-order, do-it-yourself 
chemical abortions. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, an abortion 
is always tragic, as it involves the tak-
ing of an innocent human life, one that 
has yet to draw its first breath or com-
mit its first sin. In the case of a chem-
ical abortion, it sometimes takes two 
lives: that of the baby and that of the 
mother. 
Advocates for this procedure will say 
that it is simple, it is easy, it is con-
venient, and it is safe. They claim that 
it is a good and valuable form of 
‘‘healthcare’’ for women, but nothing 
could be further from the truth. The 
grim and gruesome reality is that this 
barbaric practice wreaks havoc on 
women’s bodies and destroys the tiny 
bodies growing within them. 
So just how does this procedure 
work? The details are not pleasant. 
First, the mother is given a pill that 
blocks progesterone. This, of course, is 
a hormone that is necessary for preg-
nancy, and it breaks down the lining of 
her uterus. Without progesterone, you 
see, the baby, whose heart is already 
beating, is starved to death and dies in 
her mother’s womb. 
Then, 24 to 48 hours later, the mother 
is given a second pill, one that empties 
her uterus by causing severe contrac-
tions and bleeding, mimicking early 
miscarriage. It can last anywhere from 
a few hours to a few weeks. 
Planned Parenthood will try to gloss 
over the truth here, as elsewhere, 
claiming that a hot shower and some 
ibuprofen are enough for a quick recov-
ery to get the mother back on her feet, 
but, on average, the miscarriage lasts 
between 9 and 16 days and can last for 
as long as 30 days. Thirty days—that is 
a long time. 
Most of the time these abortions are 
done at home. The mother is left to 
suffer alone, without care or medical 
attention, without supervision from a 
doctor or a nurse, and often without 
any followup whatsoever until 7 to 14 
days later, if ever, keeping in mind 
that many of them don’t get any fol-
lowup care at all. 
The result? Well, women have suf-
fered tragic, gruesome, and horrific ex-
periences using the abortion pill. It has 
caused nearly 4,200 adverse medical 
events, including more than 1,000 hos-
pitalizations and nearly 600 instances 
of blood loss requiring transfusions. 
Some women have even died. The 
FDA has reported 24 maternal deaths 
from the abortion pill just since its ap-
proval in 2000, and those are just the 
officially reported ones that we know 
of that have happened with the regula-
tions we currently have in place. Based 
on the assumption that those regula-
tions are in place, that is still a really 
high rate at which they die. 
Some women need corrective surgery 
after taking the abortion pill and oth-
ers require lifesaving procedures. And, 
somehow, we call this healthcare. This 
is not like popping a Tylenol. This two- 
step abortion cocktail poses severe 
risks to women, not even to mention 
their unborn babies. 
In fact, abortion pills are one of only 
a few medications that require what is 
known as a risk evaluation and man-
agement strategy, a drug safety pro-
gram that the FDA requires for medi-
cations with serious risks. Yet some 
are pushing to further expand access to 
these drugs and even further loosen the 
regulations around them. 
Some activists are even pushing for 
access to the abortion pill by mail, 
meaning that the patient would never 
even have to be seen in person by any 
medical professional at all—not a med-
ical clinic, not a doctor, not a nurse— 
nothing in person. 
The standards of care surrounding 
this practice are already reckless, they 
are already harmful, and they are al-
ready causing misery, injury, suffering, 
and death. In fact, they are unaccept-
able standards of care for women and 
for babies. The last thing we should be 
doing is making them even worse, 
making them even more vulnerable 
than they already are. 
So setting aside for a minute how 
you feel about other issues related to 
unborn human life in this area, let’s 
just talk about this issue for a mo-
ment. Let’s just talk about whether 
this issue is really one that we want to 
expand, where we increase the amount 
of misery, the amount of suffering, and 
the amount of carnage that would 
occur as a result of more people gain-
ing access to this deeply flawed, very 
dangerous form of so-called healthcare. 
That is why we ought to support the 
bill put forward by my friend and col-
league Senator HYDE-SMITH. The SAVE 
Moms and Babies Act would prohibit 
the FDA from approving new abortion 
drugs, from loosening any regulations 
that exist on already approved abor-
tion drugs, and from dispensing abor-
tion drugs remotely or through the 
mail. 
The purpose of healthcare is to heal, 
to preserve, and to protect human life. 
A chemical abortion happens in the 
first trimester of life, up to about the 
tenth week of pregnancy, when an un-
born baby already has a beating heart, 
when an unborn baby already has a 
growing brain, and when the growing 
baby already has 10 fingers and 10 toes. 
She deserves a shot at life, at the be-
ginning of life, at the front door, and 
she deserves to not have it taken away 
and, literally, flushed down the drain. 
Mothers deserve the utmost care, pro-
tection, and support as they nurture 
the human life inside of them, not med-
ical harm and not medical neglect. 
Our healthcare system should protect 
and care for them both, and our laws 
should uphold the immeasurable dig-
nity and worth of both. This bill is a 
step in the right direction, and I im-
plore all of my colleagues to support 
this legislation. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Lou-
isiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
thank the Presiding Officer, Senator 
HYDE-SMITH, and Senator LEE for orga-
nizing this colloquy and participating 
in it in support of the Support and 
Value Expectant Moms and Babies Act. 
I love that title: Support and Value Ex-
pectant Moms. Isn’t that great? We 
should. 
I am a doctor—not an obstetrician, 
but, nonetheless, I have delivered ba-
bies. As a doctor, my mission was to 
save lives—I don’t practice anymore; I 
use the past tense—and improve health 
outcomes for all patients. 
We are here talking about chemical 
abortions. Chemical abortions don’t do 
any of that. The health risks can be se-
vere, obviously, for the unborn child 
but also, potentially, for the mom, and, 
particularly, when the mother has this 
without supervision by a healthcare 
provider. 
The total absence of medical support 
is the total absence of care, and using 
potentially dangerous chemicals with-
out medical support can lead to the ab-
sence of health. If Americans care 
about a woman’s health, they should be 
concerned when such procedures are al-
lowed. 
Yet chemical abortions are on the 
rise. I am told that in 2017 they rep-
resented nearly 40 percent of all abor-
tions. Due to a recent court case, 
women can begin to receive these 
through the mail, prescribed without 
even receiving a physical exam. 
Now, the mom who selects that may 
not know the potential consequences, 
but, as a physician, I do. The potential

complications include, for example, if 
the mother has what is called an ec-
topic pregnancy, where the unborn 
child and the placenta are not in the 
womb but are outside of the womb. If 
that occurs and these pills are taken— 
the pill known as Mifeprex, RU486—it 
can cause that pregnancy to rupture, 
and instead of the bleeding coming out 
as the child would, through the vagina, 
it means that internal bleeding occurs, 
which can result in the mother’s death. 
Chemical abortions have four times 
the complications that surgical abor-
tions do in the first trimester, and as 
many as 6 percent of women taking 
these abortion drugs require surgery to 
complete 
the 
abortion—potentially 
painful and life-threatening and, of 
course, horrific for the unborn child. 
The American College of Obstetri-
cians and Gynecologists has stated 
that ‘‘compared with surgical abortion, 
medical abortion takes longer to com-
plete, requires more active patient par-
ticipation, and is associated with high-
er reported rates of bleeding and 
cramping.’’ 
The bill we are discussing today, the 
SAVE Moms and Babies Act, or the 
Support and Value Expectant Moms 
and Babies Act, takes substantive steps 
to protect the health of women and the 
unborn child. The bill prevents ap-
proval of new abortion drugs by the 
FDA, keeps the risk evaluation and 
mitigation strategy, or REMS, pro-
tocol, and curtails abortion pills from 
being dispensed by mail or through 
telemedicine. 
I introduced the Teleabortion Pre-
vention Act of 2020 in February, which 
requires a doctor to physically examine 
a pregnant mom before prescribing any 
abortion-related drugs and requires a 
followup appointment. We actually 
want women to receive healthcare, by 
healthcare providers who care about 
their health. 
If Senators in this body really care 
about women’s health, they should join 
with us to stop these do-it-yourself 
abortions. Preventing abortion pro-
tects unborn babies, but preventing 
chemical abortions protects women. 
Let’s 
work 
together 
to 
protect 
women by passing the SAVE Moms and 
Babies Act to forever end dangerous 
chemical abortions. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Senator from Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, as 
if in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee 
be discharged from further consider-
ation of S. 3072 and the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration. I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object. The FDA 
approved mifepristone nearly 20 years 
ago, and leading medical organizations 
have made clear that restrictions on it 
like those that are in this bill are not 
based on evidence or patients’ best in-
terests. This bill is not about science 
or healthcare or what is best for 
women across the Nation. It is about 
ideology and Republicans wanting to 
do every single thing they can to chip 
away at the right to a safe, legal abor-
tion. 
Not on my watch. This is far from 
the only Republican effort to ignore 
the science and the medical profes-
sionals and overrule the personal deci-
sions of patients across the country. 
At this very moment, they are gear-
ing up to jam through President 
Trump’s Supreme Court nominee and 
strike down Roe v. Wade. But as sure 
as I am standing here today to oppose 
this effort to restrict women’s repro-
ductive rights, you can bet I will be 
standing with women and men across 
the country to oppose that one too. 
I will offer legislation in a moment 
that actually does work to protect and 
help women and families in a moment, 
but for now, on this request, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Washington. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4638 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are 
in the middle of a pandemic. Two hun-
dred thousand people have died, mil-
lions more have been infected, and this 
crisis is nowhere close to being over. 
But are Republicans are offering solu-
tions? Not even close. 
We need to be prioritizing science. 
Instead, they are offering a bill that 
prioritizes partisan ideology. We need 
to be making it easier for people to get 
the care they need. Instead, they are 
offering a bill with the sole purpose of 
putting up unnecessary barriers to 
care. And not only are they wasting 
time on their partisan war against 
abortion with this bill—which they 
know is a nonstarter—they are pre-
paring to jam through a Supreme 
Court nominee who would make things 
even worse. 
They are fighting to not just over-
turn Roe v. Wade but to strike down 
healthcare for tens of millions of peo-
ple and strike down protections for 
people with preexisting conditions and 
to 
send 
healthcare 
costs 
sky-
rocketing—all during a pandemic. 
I can’t believe I have to say this, but 
we need to be taking steps to make 
this crisis better, not worse, which is 
why I am going to offer a unanimous 
consent request that the Senate pro-
ceed to S. 4638—the Science and Trans-
parency Over Politics Act, which Sen-
ator SCHUMER and myself and 32 other 
Democrats introduced today. 
Unfortunately, we have seen the 
Trump administration repeatedly take 
dangerous steps to undermine and 
overrule the experts at our Nation’s 
public agencies. We have seen the 
President spread lies and misinforma-
tion and conspiracy theories about 
their work. We have seen his officials 
meddle with key scientific reports and 
apply pressure to promote unproven 
treatments. And we know this inter-
ference can damage public confidence 
in the science-based guidance our ex-
perts issue to help save lives and in 
their efforts to evaluate a vaccine and 
make sure it is safe and effective. We 
just can’t let that happen. 
This 
reckless 
interference 
didn’t 
start yesterday, and it is clear it is not 
going to stop tomorrow. So I believe 
Congress needs to take action to make 
it stop. 
The STOP Act would do just that by 
providing much needed transparency 
and accountability. Given how many 
Republicans have said we need to be 
listening to the experts and following 
the science, this bill should not be con-
troversial. It should be common sense. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 4638, and 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, I am dis-
appointed but can’t say I am surprised 
that the Senators on the other side of 
the aisle have objected to the SAVE 
Moms and Babies Act. The Democrats 
have shown time and again that they 
would rather put the profits of the 
abortion 
industry 
over 
protecting 
women. That is what is happening 
again today. 
Make no mistake, the Democrats are 
trying to change to another bill be-
cause they want to distract you from 
what my bill is about. My bill is about 
protecting women from dangerous at- 
home abortions without a physician in-
volved whatsoever. That is what my 
bill does—ensure women have to see a 
doctor to get this drug, ensure the doc-
tor can examine her to see if she has 
any conditions that might make her at 
higher risk for complications, make 
sure she is fully informed and consents 
that she is not coerced. 
Democrats objecting to this shows 
you how far to the left the Democratic 
Party is on abortion. Passing my bill 
should be a no-brainer. The REMS 
rules were put into place by a Demo-
cratic FDA to protect women. They 
have been in effect for 20 years, until 
the judge in Maryland fell for some far- 
fetched arguments from abortion advo-
cates. 
The FDA and HHS implement gov-
ernment health and safety regulations 
to protect patients and ensure that 
doctors are doing their job, to make

sure that drugs are safe and that pa-
tients are not harmed. That is why we 
have an FDA and why we have an HHS. 
I agree with the Senator from Wash-
ington State that FDA and HHS should 
do this work based on scientific evi-
dence. That is exactly what happened 
in 2000 when the Clinton administra-
tion and FDA scientists looked at the 
evidence and decided these REMS rules 
were needed to protect women from the 
dangers of this abortion drug. 
Usually, Democrats support science- 
based health protections but not when 
it comes to abortion. When it comes to 
abortion, they are in the pocket of the 
abortion lobby and would rather play 
politics rather than protect women’s 
health. 
We 
can’t 
let 
Senate 
Democrats 
change the subject by trying to bring 
up another bill that is not related to 
these REMS protections whatsoever. 
We can’t let them try to change the 
subject from women’s health to their 
latest conspiracy theory about the 
President. Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
I do ask, invoking rule XIX, that no 
Senator in debate shall, directly or in-
directly, by any form of words impute 
to another Senator or to other Sen-
ators any conduct or motive unworthy 
or unbecoming a Senator. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is 
disappointing that Republicans would 
object to a bill that simply provides 
much needed accountability and sup-
port for scientific decisionmaking. It is 
especially disappointing they would ob-
ject to it during a pandemic and while 
simultaneously pushing for an ideolog-
ical bill that would undermine pa-
tient’s care and reproductive rights. 
Rest assured, the minority leader, 
Senator SCHUMER, and I and the rest of 
our Democratic caucus are not giving 
up, and we will continue to fight on be-
half of women and families. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, point of par-
liamentary inquiry: What was the 
statement that prompted the admoni-
tion under rule XIX? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Demo-
crats are in the pockets of the abortion 
industry. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
the thoughtful discussion that we have 
had today between my colleague from 
Mississippi and my colleague from the 
State of Washington. I also appreciate 
the thoughtful insight that the Sen-
ator from Louisiana provided in his re-
marks. 
I feel it necessary to address a couple 
of issues that were raised by my friend 
and distinguished colleague from the 
State of Washington. There are dif-
ferences 
that 
Members 
have—dif-
ferences of opinion—when it comes to a 
wide variety of issues. 
When it comes to abortion, people 
have different approaches they take. I 
know my own view, and I know the 
views taken by many of my Demo-
cratic colleagues. But it is important 
to point out here what we are talking 
about and what we are not talking 
about. 
One of the first arguments that we 
heard today from the Senator from 
Washington related to Roe v. Wade. 
And as long as we are on the topic of 
imputing to another person improper 
motives or motives not apparent on the 
face of a piece of legislation, if one is 
going to impute to the Senator from 
Mississippi the intention of undoing a 
Supreme Court precedent, I would like 
to point out that is manifestly not 
within the scope of this legislation, nor 
is it the place of any Senator to pur-
port to know the subjective motivation 
behind Senator HYDE-SMITH’s legisla-
tion here. 
I am not going to purport to know 
the reason why she said that. I just 
want to point out, that is not the point 
of this bill. This bill has nothing do 
with Roe v. Wade. You can feel how-
ever you want about Roe v. Wade. This 
isn’t it. I know that is a convenient ex-
cuse to not have to deal with some-
thing—something real, something that 
has to do with the lives and the health 
and the well-being of women, to say 
nothing about the unborn human lives 
within them. 
From 
those 
who 
would 
invoke 
science in opposing this bill, I would 
ask, on what planet does science back 
the idea we should remove the REMS 
restrictions from this supposed so- 
called form of healthcare—a form of 
healthcare that, as I mentioned a few 
moments ago, has resulted in thou-
sands upon thousands of complications 
in the two decades it has been on the 
market? On what planet can one con-
tend that one can’t support this legis-
lation 
without 
being 
opposed 
to 
science? 
Back to the Roe v. Wade question. If 
every single time someone gets up to 
try to present legislation—legislation 
that as far as I can tell, the Senator 
from Washington wasn’t claiming was 
outside of our legislative purview as 
Federal lawmakers—if every single 
time someone gets up to try to raise le-
gitimate questions of public policy re-
garding the health, safety, and welfare 
of the American people, of the Amer-
ican patient, of American women sub-
jected to very serious side effects from 
a piece of legislation—if no one can 
present legislation without being ac-
cused of trying to undo a 1973 court de-
cision, which is, on its face, not even at 
issue in this legislation, then we are 
going to have a hard time carefully 
considering these things. 
Last I checked, it is our job to decide 
questions of public policy—questions 
that are squarely within our Federal 
jurisdiction. One could argue, I sup-
pose, about whether it was a good idea 
to put exclusive jurisdiction over the 
regulation of pharmaceuticals in this 
country under the FDA. One could 
make that argument. 
I don’t understand the Senator from 
Washington to be making a federalism 
argument. If she wants to have that 
conversation, I would love to have that 
with her. That would be fantastic. In 
fact, I would love to raise federalism 
concerns anytime we are discussing 
anything because it is far too seldom 
invoked here. 
But that is not what this is about. 
What that argument was about was in-
stead that the Senator from Mississippi 
supposedly is trying to overturn Roe v. 
Wade. And it couldn’t possibly be the 
fact that she is there genuinely con-
cerned about the thousands upon thou-
sands of injuries that have been sus-
tained as a result of this barbaric form 
of so-called medical treatment. It can’t 
possibly be that. 
If that is the case, if those who were 
so determined to make everything 
about Roe v. Wade—if they are right 
and if they were to have their way, 
then I guess we can’t discuss anything 
even related to women’s health that af-
fects pregnancy. 
Surely, that is not the argument. 
That can’t be the argument. I don’t 
think anyone, regardless of how they 
feel about Roe V. Wade, regardless of 
how they feel about government’s role 
in abortion or not, if what we are talk-
ing about is the fact that we ought not 
loosen certain restrictions so as to 
allow people to gain access to an abor-
tion cocktail that is dangerous under 
many circumstances, especially when 
it is administered without any kind of 
direct medical supervision or atten-
tion, if that is where we are, that is not 
good. That is messed up. Something is 
terribly wrong if we can’t have a con-
versation about women’s health with-
out being accused of wanting to undo 
an entire line of precedent dating back 
to 1973. 
Look, guilty as charged. I have my 
own views about that line of precedent. 
Those views are no secret. Those views 
are well-founded as a matter of science. 
They are well-founded as a matter of 
hundreds of years of American con-
stitutional law, of common law, but I 
understand they are not the only 
views. 
You cannot simply walk in here and 
say that because this addresses a type 
of abortion procedure, because Roe v. 
Wade reached the conclusion that it 
did, anyone who proposes a piece of leg-
islation like the one proposed by Sen-
ator HYDE-SMITH today necessarily has 
as its object—that her subjective moti-
vation behind filing that legislation is 
the undoing of Roe v. Wade, and be-
cause that is her supposed subjective 
motivation, we can’t even have the 
conversation about what this does for 
women’s health—to say: Let’s draw the 
line, and let’s not remove the REMS 
restrictions. Let’s not let people order 
these through the mail and be adminis-
tered these dangerous drugs without 
direct medical supervision.

guished colleague from the State of

Washington, is that we are in the mid-
dle of a global pandemic. Yes, we are, 
but last I checked, that doesn’t prevent 
or preclude us from discussing and ad-
dressing other things, from the funding 
of the government to Presidential 
nominees whom we confirm or don’t 
confirm. That doesn’t preclude us or 
excuse us from considering other pieces 
of legislation. I am struggling to un-
derstand how the existence of a global 
pandemic means that we can’t even ad-
dress another type of epidemic—one 
brought about potentially as a result of 
the abusive prescription and reckless 
misuse of abortion-inducing drug cock-
tails. This is beyond my ability to un-
derstand. 
It is also beyond my ability to under-
stand how a simple requirement that 
before one of these drugs is adminis-
tered, the patient should have at her 
disposal a medical examination and 
some kind of medical attention. Noth-
ing about Roe v. Wade says that you 
can’t have laws restricting the manner 
in which abortions are performed. 
Nothing about Roe v. Wade says that a 
State or Congress itself may not re-
quire that abortions be performed by 
healthcare professionals under the su-
pervision of a board certified medical 
doctor. Nothing about Roe v. Wade car-
ries any implication for this. This leg-
islation simply says: Let’s make sure 
that medications like this are not used 
to harm American women. 
I have other colleagues wishing to 
discuss this topic and other topics. Let 
me say this: Human life matters. Every 
human life means something. You 
can’t snuff it out and pretend it doesn’t 
exist, because it does. Every life mat-
ters to God. It matters in the universe. 
Whether you believe in God or not, life 
matters. You can’t pretend it doesn’t 
exist. Every life is unrepeatable, irre-
placeable. We should vow to protect it. 
For those who aren’t interested in 
protecting unborn human life, let’s at 
least focus on protecting the human 
lives that we all agree exist. That is 
what this legislation is about. Shame 
on us if we can’t even do that. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleague Senator LEE for an im-
passioned and effective argument. 
I rise here today in support of my 
colleague Senator HYDE-SMITH’s SAVE 
Moms and Babies Act, of which I am a 
proud cosponsor. I am disappointed 
that my colleagues would object to this 
bill to help safeguard and help expect-
ant mothers. 
The SAVE Moms and Babies Act 
would improve women’s health by pro-
tecting important safety mechanisms 
put into place by the FDA. The Risk 
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy is 
an essential mechanism which ensures 
that drugs with serious safety concerns 
are used and prescribed correctly. 
My Democratic colleagues and the 
abortion lobby may expect Americans 
to believe chemical abortion pills are 
safe to use and should be available on-
line without an in-person physician 
consultation, but here are the facts: 
Between 3.4 and 5.9 percent of women 
taking chemical abortion drugs require 
surgical intervention to complete the 
abortion. This meant 10,000 women in 
2017 alone needed surgery after taking 
an abortion drug. Chemical abortion 
has four times the complications as 
surgical abortion during the first tri-
mester. The risk of complications are 
particularly worsened in the case of an 
ectopic pregnancy. Women with ec-
topic pregnancies have suffered serious 
injury and even death from taking 
chemical abortion drugs. 
I am disappointed this Chamber 
could not come together today to sup-
port 
Senator 
HYDE-SMITH’s 
timely, 
needed, and important bill to protect 
women’s health. 
I yield the floor.

of the committee unanimously and was 
approved by the Senate unanimously, 
and we have been negotiating with 
Chairman TAKANO and Ranking Mem-
ber ROE of the House Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs for its passage by the 
House and with consideration by the 
Senate of other bills that the House 
has and will send us. 
I want to thank my colleague Sen-
ator TESTER, the ranking member of 
our committee, Chairman TAKANO, and 
Dr. ROE, the ranking member of the 
House committee, for working expedi-
tiously with me to reach an agreement 
to pass this comprehensive mental 
health and suicide prevention bill for 
America’s veterans. 
One veteran lost due to suicide is one 
too many, and it is a national tragedy 
that we continue to lose 20 veterans 
each day to suicide. 
I am glad that Congress has come to-
gether to do our part to ensure this bill 
which will save lives. It needs to be 
passed without delay and signed into 
law. 
This bill will establish a grant pro-
gram and require the VA to better col-
laborate with community organiza-
tions across the country already serv-
ing veterans. This provision was spe-
cifically championed by my colleague 
Senator BOOZMAN of Arkansas. 
In addition, this legislation directs 
the VA to embark on groundbreaking 
research in the form of a precision 
medicine initiative that will improve 
how mental health conditions are diag-
nosed and treated, expand VA tele-
health capabilities to better serve rural 
and Tribal veterans, bolster and expe-
dite Federal research capabilities, in-
crease accountability over the Depart-
ment’s mental health and suicide pre-
vention programs, and make necessary 
improvements to the VA mental health 
workforce. 
While this legislation puts in place 
the critical care, services, and support 
that will save veterans’ lives, it is my 
hope that the bill will also serve as a 
signal to our veterans, servicemem-
bers, and their families that they are 
never, never alone. 
I want to extend my gratitude to the 
President for his support of this bill, 
and I ask him to sign this legislation 
as soon as it arrives on his desk. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, we 
must take our duty to America’s vet-
erans seriously, which is why the cir-
cumstances we find ourselves in today 
are extremely unfortunate. The exten-
sions for important VA programs for 
the upcoming fiscal year—just 8 days 
away—are currently being held up from 
being considered and passed in the Sen-
ate. 
This extension bill was negotiated in 
earnest and the four corners of the 
Senate and House Veterans’ Affairs 
Committees agreed upon this legisla-
tion. This was a collaborative effort, 
not a partisan one, but, nonetheless, 
this bill has not yet been cleared by 
the Senate minority. 
Let me be clear: Countless veterans 
rely on these programs. Let me be 
clear: They expire at the end of the 
month. 
From raising veterans out of home-
lessness 
to 
making 
certain 
that 
COVID–19 doesn’t disrupt a veteran’s 
pursuit of higher education, to helping 
rural veterans get their medical ap-
pointments, the fiscal year 2021 VA ex-
tenders bill contains a wide variety of 
extensions for programs that support a 
multitude of veteran populations. 
Additionally, we have requested con-
sent for several House-passed bills that 
will improve mental health care for 
veterans and increase annual veteran 
benefit rates to keep up with inflation. 
These are commonsense ideas that 
have broad support and will make 
meaningful differences in the lives of 
our veterans. These are items that 
would normally pass the Senate with-
out difficulty. 
Our veterans should not wait and 
should not need to wait. They can’t af-
ford to wait for the Senate to act on 
these matters. The deadline is quickly 
approaching. Our Nation’s veterans did 
not serve their country for partisan 
reasons, and we must not let any par-
tisan differences prevent us from au-
thorizing the programs to support 
those veterans. 
I ask my Senate colleagues to fulfill 
our collective duty regarding veterans 
programs and that we do not allow 
other issues to distract from that duty. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING JUSTICE RUTH 
BADER GINSBURG 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, this past weekend, we lost a 
brave and uncommonly fearless Amer-
ican. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg rep-
resented many things to many people. 
For some, her work was the gold stand-
ard of legal advocacy. For others, her 
arguments proved to be intellectual 
flashpoints, sparking opportunities to 
think critically about what we believe 
and why we believe it. But for each and 
every one of us, she served as living 
proof that the status quo is often much 
more fragile than it appears. 
So today, I think I speak for so many 
Tennesseans when I say we are thank-
ful beyond measure for that enduring 
legacy and the standard that she set as 
she broke barriers and crashed through 
glass ceilings, opening opportunities 
for women. I hope that I am as effec-
tive as she in increasing opportunities 
for women each and every day. 
f 
AMERICAN UNITY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, last week marked another Con-
stitution Day celebration. It could not 
have come at a better time because, for 
just one little moment, it helped us 
pause and contemplate two very impor-
tant things. 
First, we took time to think about 
those values that our Founders knew. 
They knew that these values were es-
sential to the establishment of a model 
republic. 
Second, we remembered the progress 
we have made in deciding for ourselves 
how the passage of time changes or 
does not change what we can do to 
make that ‘‘more perfect Union’’ even 
more so. 
Free speech, petition, and protest, 
the right to defend ourselves, the right 
to cast a vote—these are the freedoms 
that unite us in times of turmoil, 
whether we find ourselves in the midst 
of all-out war or just a particularly 
contentious election year. 
I would argue that how a nation re-
acts to that turmoil says more about 
its foundation than it does about who 
controls the news cycle on any given 
day. 
Divisive voices are hard at work in 
this country, and they are doing their 
very best to convince our friends, fami-
lies, and neighbors that our foundation 
is weak and that our founding prin-
ciples are no longer good enough. I find 
that very sad. 
They want us to believe that Amer-
ica as we know it is suddenly irredeem-
able, that it just can’t be safe. 
You might ask yourself: Why are 
they saying all of this in spite of hun-
dreds of years and millions of Ameri-
cans proving the exact opposite is true? 
Here is what I think. They say it be-
cause they want us to give up. They 
want our neighbors, our families, and 
our friends to give up, call it quits; our 
best days are behind us. We have all 
heard them say this. They say: Throw 
the Constitution in the trash. Rewrite 
it. Start over. And after you throw the 
Constitution in the trash, then let’s re-
imagine the world’s greatest democ-
racy through our very own destructive 
lenses of socialism, critical theory, and 
political correctness. That is what they 
say. 
As I am sure we have all seen, they 
have come up with some fairly persua-
sive methods to try to get their way. 
But I believe that, in the end, these ef-
forts will all be in vain because when 
push comes to shove, we, the American 
people, always manage to remember 
where we have come from and to re-
member who we are. 
It is interesting. I think somehow we 
Americans always find our way home, 
back to those first principles. Indeed, I 
pray that continues. 
Our Founders saw what tyranny real-
ly looked like. They saw it up close and 
personal because they had to live 
through it. They knew exactly—ex-
actly—what would happen if they put 
the fate of the Republic in the hands of 
men alone. So what did they do to give 
that insurance policy, if you will, that 
democracy and a democratic republic 
would continue and would stand? They 
drafted a Constitution, recognizing

that our rights are a gift from God and 
that these rights are not a product of 
government action or they are not sub-
ject to the whims of a mob. 
They were also forward thinking. 
They gave us everything we need to 
improve upon their work. 
I think it is important to remember 
we have done just that. Over the course 
of more than two centuries, we have 
built a nation that is freer, more equal, 
and, yes, striving every day to be that 
‘‘more perfect Union,’’ not because out-
side forces compel us to do so but be-
cause we, as Americans, chose to make 
it that way. 
When I see that a friend or a neigh-
borhood has forgotten this, I like to re-
mind them that two of the most emo-
tional and powerful words in the 
English language are ‘‘remember’’ and 
‘‘imagine.’’ 
I tell them: Stop for just a moment. 
Close your eyes and remember what 
you really love about this country. Re-
member the special moments. Remem-
ber what your parents and your grand-
parents have told you about love of 
country. Remember the sacrifices they 
have made. And, now, just imagine: 
What 
would 
your 
children 
and 
grandkids accomplish? What would 
they accomplish if they, too, are al-
lowed to grow up in a place where lib-
erty and justice is for all, where they 
are allowed to dream these big dreams 
and then dream up a way to make 
those dreams come true? These are 
things that are valued above all else. 
Of course, as we look at our past and 
we remember, we look at the future, 
and we know that in finding common 
ground—when 
we 
find 
common 
ground—we see potential, and potential 
gives us hope. I like to say that hope is 
staking a claim on an action, on a goal 
that you are going to achieve. 
So it is my fervent hope that we will 
continue to stand on our constitutional 
principles and that we will defend the 
foundation of this Nation that has 
given so many Americans the oppor-
tunity to make these big dreams come 
true. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING JUSTICE RUTH 
BADER GINSBURG 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise to honor the life and legacy of 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
The Nation mourns the loss of Su-
preme Court Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg, who died Friday night. She died 
on the eve of the Jewish new year, 
Rosh Hashanah. She was the first Jew-
ish woman on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Rabbis tell us a very interesting 
thing about individuals who die right 
before the new year. They say and they 
suggest that these are very righteous 
people who die at the very end of the 
year because they were needed until 
the very end. Under Jewish tradition, 
those who die on the new year holiday 
are considered tzadik, a title given to 
the righteous and saintly. Certainly 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was enti-
tled to this honor, being righteous and 
saintly. 
At her confirmation hearing, Justice 
Ginsburg talked about her immigrant 
experience. You see, her father was a 
Jewish immigrant, and her mother was 
barely a second-generation American. 
So she talked about American values, 
and then she said: ‘‘What has become of 
me could only happen in America.’’ 
Then she spent her entire career pro-
tecting those values that make Amer-
ica the great Nation it is and the rea-
son why people come here in order to 
reach their full potential. It guided her 
well in her public service. 
Justice Ginsburg was both an inspi-
ration and a trailblazer in every sense 
of the word. After breaking through 
the countless barriers thrown in her 
path, she redefined what is meant to be 
both a thoughtful jurist and a dedi-
cated public servant. 
Let me just briefly go over some of 
her incredible accomplishments: first 
in her undergraduate class at Cornell 
University, first female member of the 
Harvard Law Journal, graduating first 
in her class at Columbia Law School, 
first female professor at Columbia Uni-
versity to earn tenure. 
Justice Ginsburg directed the ACLU 
Women’s Rights Project and argued six 
landmark cases before the Supreme 
Court, winning five of those cases. 
These cases protected not only the 
rights of women but those of many 
men who faced discrimination as well. 
As the National Women’s Law Center 
wrote about Justice Ginsburg’s death, 
they said: 
[Her passing] is cause for us to pause and 
honor the unparalleled mark she has left on 
this country. From co-founding the ACLU’s 
Women’s Rights Project, to bringing the 
first case striking down a law that discrimi-
nated against women, to building the case 
that defined the standard for sex discrimina-
tion cases, Ginsburg was a visionary who 
revolutionized the gender equality move-
ment—and the law—long before becoming a 
Supreme Court Justice. 
For our country, Ginsburg’s ethos was 
greater than just the law. She was an icon 
and a living symbol of a north star, so we 
must unite and do for her what she did for 
us—fight for what is right. 
As a litigator, Judge Ginsburg helped 
to shape the law, convincing the Su-
preme Court that ‘‘equal protection of 
the law’’ under the 14th Amendment 
applied not only to racial discrimina-
tion but to gender discrimination as 
well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5752 
September 22, 2020 
Justice Ginsburg herself knew dis-
crimination firsthand, as she struggled 
to find a job after graduating law 
school—notwithstanding her sterling 
qualifications. She had that difficulty, 
as we all know, solely because of her 
gender. She experienced gender dis-
crimination firsthand, and she did 
something about it not only for herself 
but for future generations. 
After serving on the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia 
for 13 years, she began a 27-year career 
on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
There are so many of her decisions 
that were so consequential, so vision-
ary, expressing the right value, and her 
ability to express her views was un-
questioned. She did that in writing ma-
jority opinions, and she is well known 
for doing that in writing dissenting 
opinions. So many of her dissenting 
opinions led the way for change. She 
was right, and she motivated change. 
In 1996, Justice Ginsburg wrote the 
majority opinion of the Court in the 
finding that the all-male admissions 
policy at the State-supported Virginia 
Military 
Institute 
was 
unconstitu-
tional. She said in that opinion: ‘‘Gen-
eralizations about ‘the way women 
are,’ estimates of what is appropriate 
for most women, no longer justify de-
nying opportunity to women whose tal-
ent and capacity place them outside 
the average description.’’ Any differen-
tial treatment, she concluded, must 
not ‘‘create or perpetuate the legal, so-
cial, 
and 
economic 
inferiority 
of 
women.’’ 
What a difference she made in that 
decision. 
I will always remember her dis-
senting opinion in the Lilly Ledbetter 
case because it led directly to change. 
Justice Ginsburg wrote in that fiery 
dissent: ‘‘Our precedent suggests, and 
lower 
courts 
have 
overwhelmingly 
held, that the unlawful practice is the 
current payment of salaries infected by 
gender-based (or race-based) discrimi-
nation—a practice that occurs when-
ever a paycheck delivers less to a 
woman than to a similarly situated 
man.’’ 
I heard one of my colleagues talk 
about precedent, but here we see the 
Court reversing precedent in order to 
advance 
discrimination 
against 
women. Her dissent led to congres-
sional action, becoming the first piece 
of 
legislation 
signed 
by 
President 
Barack Obama. The text of this bill 
hung on her office wall for good reason, 
as it embodied her spirit. 
She issued a fiery dissent again in 
the Shelby County v. Holder case in 
2013, a case decided by a 5-to-4 vote of 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States, which gutted the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965. 
Here is what she said in that opinion: 
What has become of the court’s usual re-
straint? 
Justice Ginsburg wrote in her dis-
senting opinion: 
The great man who led the march from 
Selma to Montgomery and there called for 
the passage of the Voting Rights Act foresaw 
progress, even in Alabama. ‘‘The arc of the 
moral universe is long,’’ he said, but ‘‘it 
bends toward justice,’’ if there is a steadfast 
commitment to see the task through to com-
pletion. 
That 
commitment 
has 
been 
disserved by today’s decision. . . . Throwing 
out preclearance when it has worked and is 
continuing to work to stop discriminatory 
changes is like throwing away your umbrella 
in a rainstorm because you are not getting 
wet. 
I mentioned these cases to under-
score the importance of the Supreme 
Court Justice in the lives of all Ameri-
cans. So much is at stake in the filling 
of Justice Ginsburg’s vacancy. It will 
have real consequences on all of our 
constituents. 
Let me just give you a few examples 
of what is likely to be taken up by the 
Supreme Court that could affect my 
constituents in Maryland and the con-
stituents around the Nation. 
Your healthcare is, literally, on the 
line. The Affordable Care Act that 
President Trump has tried to repeal 
and the Republicans have tried to re-
peal in this body but have failed, they 
are now going to take to the Supreme 
Court. A hearing is scheduled this No-
vember. 
This is a real risk for tens of millions 
of Americans who depend on the law 
for their health coverage and other 
benefits. Twenty million Americans 
could lose their healthcare, and people 
with preexisting conditions could lose 
those protections—that is 133 million 
Americans—during 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
That is what is at risk. We are talk-
ing about pregnancy, cancer, diabetes, 
high blood pressure, behavioral health 
disorders, high cholesterol, asthma, 
chronic lung disease, heart conditions, 
and numerous others that have been 
held to be preexisting conditions. That 
protection is in the Affordable Care 
Act. That is on the line before the Su-
preme Court this November. 
That is why Americans are concerned 
that we follow the right process in se-
lecting the next individual to serve on 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States. If the Affordable Care Act is 
struck down, insurers could bring back 
annual and lifetime limits on coverage; 
adults covered by Medicaid expansion 
would lose vital health services; young 
people would be kicked off of their par-
ents’ insurance; and insurers could sell 
skimpy plans that don’t even cover es-
sential health benefits like prescrip-
tion drugs, emergency room visits, 
mental health and substance use, and 
maternity care. 
The Affordable Care Act increased 
access to care for millions who were 
previously uninsured or underinsured. 
Through Medicaid expansion, 13 mil-
lion low-income Americans now have 
dependable, comprehensive health. 
In Maryland alone, over 1.3 low-in-
come individuals depend on Medicaid, 
including 512,000 low-income children, 
107,000 seniors, and 152,000 individuals 
with disabilities. That is in Maryland. 
We must protect the Medicaid expan-
sion population and other uninsured 
and underinsured populations from the 
Trump administration’s effort to elimi-
nate their access to affordable care. It 
is at risk. 
This vacancy is critically important 
to protecting healthcare, and there are 
so many other issues. Women’s repro-
ductive rights—clearly at risk. Roe v. 
Wade—I understand it is established 
precedent, but look at what the Su-
preme Court has been willing to do in 
reversing precedent. 
We know Roe v. Wade is in the cross-
hairs for change by the Supreme Court, 
and one more Justice appointed to sup-
port that position and a woman’s right 
of choice could very well be in jeop-
ardy. 
Our most vulnerable individuals are 
at risk as well. Let me talk about one 
specific group of people—some of our 
immigrants. On June 18, 2020, in a 5-to- 
4 decision written by Justice Roberts 
and joined by Justice Ginsburg, the Su-
preme Court held that the Department 
of Homeland Security violated the law 
when it rescinded the Deferred Action 
for Childhood Arrival, DACA, Program. 
There 
are 
approximately 
643,000 
DACA recipients in the United States, 
and 
approximately 
29,000 
are 
healthcare workers, essential workers, 
whose service during the COVID–19 
pandemic has saved lives and eased suf-
fering. But for that 5-to-4 decision, 
those individuals’ lives could have been 
totally disrupted had they been ordered 
to leave our country. 
These are individuals who know no 
other home but the United States of 
America. They are our neighbors and 
friends—and yet a 5-to-4 decision of the 
Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg will 
no longer be there. This next Justice 
could very well determine the fate of 
the Dreamers. 
LGBTQ community: In the Obergefell 
v. Hodges case, the Supreme Court, by 
a 5-to-4 decision, held the Constitution 
guarantees same-sex couples the right 
to marry. That is a 5-to-4 decision. 
I always expected that, in America, 
we would move forward in protecting 
individual rights under our Constitu-
tion; that, in each Congress and each 
session, the Supreme Court would ad-
vance those rights for individuals’ pro-
tection under the Constitution of the 
United States. The filling of this Su-
preme Court vacancy could very well 
reverse a trend of protecting rights and 
deny many in our community their 
rights. 
I could cite many, many other exam-
ples of what is at risk by the Supreme 
Court appointment. There are many 
reasons why we believe that we should 
follow the proper process in selecting 
the next Supreme Court Justice, so 
let’s talk a little bit about what proc-
ess we should follow. Let’s talk a little 
bit about fairness. Let’s talk about the 
integrity of the Senate. Let’s talk 
about living up to our own words. Let’s 
talk about using the same rules for 
Democrats that you use for Repub-
licans. Let’s talk about the fairness of 
the process.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5753 
September 22, 2020 
Now, I could spend a lot of time on 
the floor quoting the comments of so 
many of my colleagues who spoke on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate 4 years ago 
on the Merrick Garland nomination by 
President Obama and how they spoke 
about the importance of listening to 
the voters of our Nation, how they said 
we didn’t have the time—and, remem-
ber, Merrick Garland was in February 
of an election year—to do this; that we 
needed to withhold taking up the nomi-
nation; that it was up to the voters to 
act first; and that this had nothing to 
do with the fact that it was a Demo-
crat in the White House. 
So many of our colleagues said: If 
there is a Republican elected in 2016 
and the Senate is controlled by the Re-
publicans, we would say the same 
thing. Hold off. Let the voters have a 
chance. 
Let me quote from one of our col-
leagues. 
In 2016, Senate Republicans refused to con-
sider the nomination of Judge Merrick Gar-
land, President Obama’s nominee for a Su-
preme Court vacancy. They would not meet 
with Judge Garland, hold a hearing on his 
nomination, or allow a vote for 293 days. 
Antonin Scalia died in February 2016. Presi-
dent Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a 
respected D.C. Circuit Judge with bipartisan 
support, in March 2016. In the case of Justice 
Ginsburg’s vacancy in 2020, we are about 40 
days away from a general election, and early 
and absentee voting has already begun in 
several states. By contrast, in 2016, the for-
mal presidential primary elections had just 
begun to occur when Justice Scalia died. 
Our colleagues spoke up then and 
said: Look, 4 years ago, our Republican 
colleagues said not enough time, leave 
it up to the voters; we would do this 
whether it is a Democrat or Repub-
lican. 
Let me quote from one of our col-
leagues, the Republican leader, MITCH 
MCCONNELL. This is his quote on the 
floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President, the next Justice could fun-
damentally alter the direction of the Su-
preme Court and have a profound impact on 
our country, so of course—of course the 
American people should have a say in the 
Court’s direction. . . . As Chairman Grassley 
and I declared weeks ago and reiterated per-
sonally to President Obama, the Senate will 
continue to observe the Biden rule so that 
the American people have a voice in this mo-
mentous decision. The American people may 
well elect a President who decides to nomi-
nate Judge Garland for Senate consider-
ation. The next President may also nominate 
someone very different. Either way, our view 
is this: Give the people a voice in filling this 
vacancy. . . . As we continue working on 
issues like these, the American people are 
perfectly capable of having their say on this 
issue. So [let’s give] them a voice. Let’s let 
the American people decide. 
Senator MITCH MCCONNELL. 
We have the McConnell rule, estab-
lished by the Republican leader. Let’s 
follow the McConnell rule and let the 
American people pick the next Presi-
dent and Senate so they can weigh in 
on 
this 
decision 
just 
as 
Senator 
MCCONNELL argued in 2016 with Presi-
dent Obama’s nominee, Merrick Gar-
land, for Justice Scalia’s seat. 
Let the Senate honor Justice Gins-
burg’s legacy by continuing to fight for 
the rights she fought for in her entire 
career, both as a litigator and circuit 
judge and, finally, as a Supreme Court 
Justice. 
Let us honor Justice Ginsburg’s 
dying wish: ‘‘My most fervent wish is 
that I will not be replaced until a new 
President is installed.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
rise at a time of great grief in our 
country. We have seen 200,000 fellow 
Americans perish due to COVID. In ad-
dition to that, we have seen heroes in 
our Nation fall during this period as 
well. Still, we have a heavy heart as we 
have seen the passing of civil rights 
greats like C.T. Vivian and, of course, 
our colleague in the House of Rep-
resentatives, John Lewis. 
In many ways, we are walking 
through the valley of a shadow of 
death, but as our fellow Americans fall, 
it is apt that we give tribute to their 
character, to the values and virtues 
which marked their lives, and to the 
truth and ideals that they carried for 
their lives and how they advanced to us 
so that we might have better lives. 
Truly, if we are recognizing those 
values and those virtues, then, the 
passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a 
time that calls upon Americans to 
pause and recognize her extraordinary 
life. She was a woman of small physical 
stature, but she was truly a giant 
amongst us. 
Even before her years as a Supreme 
Court Justice, she championed the 
rights of Americans and the ideals we 
hold so dear. She advanced the cause of 
liberty and equality and the under-
standing, as it says, literally, on the 
Supreme Court wall, of ‘‘Equal Justice 
Under Law.’’ 
This spirit that she fought for was 
buttressed by her massive intellect, her 
acumen, her skill, and her strategy 
that were seen in her career as a law-
yer, as well as her opinions and work 
as a Justice. 
She understood more, or as much as 
anyone, that the decisions of the Su-
preme Court literally have a profound 
impact on the daily lives of Americans, 
that the decisions of the Supreme 
Court will affect some of the most fun-
damental ideals. It could mean the dif-
ference between life or death, the dif-
ference between economic security and 
economic ruin, the difference between 
environmental protection and devasta-
tion. 
It affects not just the balance of 
power in institutions like the Senate 
but also the balance of people’s lives 
and their well-being at their kitchen 
table. 
She knew that our laws are tools 
through which we could either make 
our Nation live up to its promise for all 
or fall further away from them. It is in 
this context that I want to join my col-
leagues this evening in discussing Jus-
tice Ginsburg’s legacy and the future of 
the Supreme Court, because so many of 
the other things that matter most to 
us are in the balance right now with 
the decisions that this body makes. 
Americans know that the decisions of 
this body as it relates to the Supreme 
Court are going to affect some of the 
deepest issues that affect their lives— 
their economic security, their bodily 
autonomy, their right to vote, their 
civil rights, the environment in which 
we all live—and the area I most want 
to focus on is their healthcare—their 
healthcare. The ideal of healthcare is 
fundamental to the ideals of our found-
ing document. You cannot have life, 
liberty, and pursue happiness if you do 
not have access to healthcare. 
The next person appointed to the Su-
preme Court will make the kind of de-
cisions that will quite literally affect 
the quality of healthcare and, there-
fore, will affect life-or-death issues. 
We know that over the past 6 
months, this deadly pandemic has led 
to this valley of a shadow of death for 
our Nation and the globe and has led to 
200,000 people perishing in our Nation. 
This 
is 
directly 
affected 
by 
the 
urgencies of this pandemic. Millions of 
Americans have lost their jobs, and 30 
million 
Americans 
weren’t 
getting 
enough food to eat. Communities that 
were already vulnerable have been dev-
astated by this public health and eco-
nomic crisis. 
Now, more than ever, Americans are 
relying on our safety nets, especially 
when it comes to access to healthcare. 
The next Supreme Court Justice will 
inevitably oversee whether the Afford-
able Care Act stays in place or not. 
Thankfully, because of the Affordable 
Care Act and, in particular, because 
the expansion of Medicaid has hap-
pened in 36 States so far, more Ameri-
cans are getting insured. And now dur-
ing this pandemic, more important 
than ever, many Americans—millions 
of Americans—are staying insured even 
though they have lost their jobs. 
An article published in the New Eng-
land Journal of Medicine in August re-
ported: ‘‘The ACA, having created sev-
eral new options for health insurance 
unrelated to employment, will protect 
many recently unemployed people and 
their families from losing coverage.’’ 
I know the difference that the Afford-
able Care Act makes, and in particular 
the difference that Medicaid expansion 
has made, especially for communities 
like mine in the State of New Jersey, 
like the one in which I live, of hard-
working people who are still at the 
lower echelons of our economic nation. 
This is why I know what the Supreme 
Court decision could mean if it strikes 
down the Affordable Care Act. Espe-
cially right now, I know what it would 
mean. 
Turning again to the New England 
Journal of Medicine, they make it 
plain, and they make it clear: 
In the current context of millions of Amer-
icans losing their jobs and an ongoing pan-
demic, overturning the ACA would most

September 22, 2020 
likely be devastating to patients, clinicians, 
hospitals, and state economies. The very 
virus that has brought about record unem-
ployment levels is the same agent that 
makes health insurance—and the new op-
tions created under the ACA—more impor-
tant than ever. 
That is the New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
This fall, the Supreme Court of the 
United States of America will consider 
another challenge to the Affordable 
Care Act. President Trump’s Justice 
Department has taken the dangerous 
position that ‘‘the entire ACA . . . 
must fall.’’ 
President Trump is trying to take 
away the security of the ACA, take 
away the law that allows Medicaid ex-
pansion, take away the law that pro-
tects people with preexisting condi-
tions 
and 
allows 
them 
to 
have 
healthcare—the 
law 
that, 
literally, 
medical professionals are saying is sav-
ing lives today. 
And now here we are debating a deci-
sion of whom we should put on the Su-
preme Court. Will we put another—a 
third—Trump appointee on the Su-
preme Court, one that reflects his val-
ues and his views, a Justice that is 
likely now to tip the balance even fur-
ther, that would most likely overturn 
the ACA and means that millions of 
families in the middle of a pandemic 
will lose their healthcare? 
Days before an election, when my 
colleagues, just a few short years ago, 
said we shouldn’t make this decision. 
This is the conclusion of colleague, 
after colleague, after colleague. In that 
case with Merrick Garland, we were 
months and months away from an elec-
tion—269 days. Now, we are mere days. 
It is a decision that will affect the lives 
of millions, a decision that goes to the 
core of our healthcare, our health, our 
well-being, our ability to afford what 
should be a right for this Nation—ac-
cess to quality healthcare. 
If they go forward with this Justice, 
what will it mean? It will mean that 
the Federal health centers that serve 
communities that need them the most 
would be gutted because that is what 
the Affordable Care Act has done for 
America. It would mean that people 
with preexisting conditions, from asth-
ma to cancer to lasting complications 
of COVID–19, could be kicked off their 
coverage at a time when they are more 
vulnerable than ever. That is what this 
decision is about. 
It would mean that many seniors who 
are already living paycheck to pay-
check would have to pay more for their 
prescription drugs and more for the 
preventative services that they receive 
at no cost today because of the Afford-
able Care Act that Donald Trump be-
lieves should fall. 
It would mean that young adults who 
now, more than ever, are relying on 
staying on their parents’ plan until 26 
wouldn’t be able to do so because of the 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
that 
Donald 
Trump believes should fall. It would 
mean that countless babies who need 
to spend time in the neonatal intensive 
unit would hit lifetime limits on care 
within a few months or a few weeks of 
being born. 
Gutting the Affordable Care Act, see-
ing it fall as our President desires, 
would 
mean 
insurance 
companies 
would go back to spending more of 
Americans’ premium dollars on admin-
istrative functions than actual care. 
This Supreme Court Justice will deter-
mine if the ACA, or the Affordable Care 
Act, stands or, as Donald Trump wants, 
it should fall. And if it falls, it would 
mean women would go back to paying 
more for their health coverage simply 
because of their sex. 
The 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
falling 
would mean at a time when Black and 
Latino Americans are disproportion-
ately dying of this virus, reversing the 
gains of the Affordable Care Act has 
made in narrowing those disparities 
now, we would see those communities 
with less coverage, less care, less ac-
cess, less justice. 
Donald Trump tried to influence the 
Court, putting a person on who reflects 
his views and his values. Donald Trump 
wants the ACA to fail. If he is success-
ful, it will mean more onerous require-
ments and barriers to healthcare ac-
cess during a global pandemic that is 
already 
wreaking 
devastation 
and 
havoc on American communities from 
sea to shining sea. 
In New Jersey, my State, a repeal of 
the Affordable Care Act combined with 
the impact of COVID–19 would mean 
686,000 people in New Jersey would lose 
their health coverage, all while dealing 
with a deadly pandemic and a reces-
sion. Nationally, it would mean 23 mil-
lion of our fellow Americans, 23 million 
people—children, adults, and the elder-
ly—could lose their coverage if the 
ACA were repealed during this pan-
demic. 
The fact is, health coverage saves 
lives. That is not an exaggeration. This 
is life or death. Study after study has 
borne this out. The Center on Budget 
and Policy Priorities reports that the 
expansion of Medicaid alone under the 
Affordable Care Act saved over 19,000 
lives between just 2014 and 2017, and the 
States that didn’t expand Medicaid saw 
over 15,000 people die prematurely. 
That is just among adults age 55 to 64. 
The 
Affordable 
Care 
Act—think 
about the lives saved. Think about 
those who did not have Medicaid ex-
pansion and the lives lost, our fellow 
Americans. Life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness. Life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness—that is what is at 
stake right now and before the pan-
demic hit. 
We know that many of the people 
who have been hardest hit by COVID–19 
rely on Medicaid. Since the pandemic, 
Medicaid enrollment in our country 
has gone up as more people have been 
in need. It has grown for the first time 
in 3 years. Because of this pandemic, 
more people are hurting, and more of 
our fellow Americans are finding them-
selves in crisis. Across the country, 
more families are able to turn to Med-
icaid during this crisis because of the 
Affordable Care Act. The State of Ken-
tucky, which the Republican leader 
represents, had the highest rise in Med-
icaid enrollment, with a 17.2-percent 
increase from February to August. 
This is how our social safety net 
should work. It should be there in a 
crisis. When there is more disease, 
when there is more death, when there 
is more suffering, we as a nation should 
show more compassion, more empathy, 
and more care, not less. 
We saw in 2018, when people were 
asked why they were voting, why we 
saw a surge in turnout, it was because 
people were concerned about their 
healthcare. And that was before the 
pandemic. This election will be about 
many things, but most people will 
know that this is an election about the 
security of healthcare. 
One President says, again, and I 
quote: Let it fall. Another wants to 
preserve it and put people on the Su-
preme Court who will defend it as fun-
damentally in line with our constitu-
tional ideals—life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness. That is the jeopardy. 
That is what is at stake using the logic 
not of any Democrat but using the 
logic of my Republican colleague after 
Republican colleague, my Republican 
friend after my Republican friend, 
who—I heard what they said when they 
denied Barack Obama a Supreme Court 
pick. I heard their words. They were 
clear. My friend, the head of the Judi-
ciary Committee, even went as far as 
to say: ‘‘Use my words against me.’’ 
If it is the final year of President 
Trump’s term, we should wait until 
after the election before we put some-
one on the highest Court in the land 
for a lifetime appointment. What is 
this about? It is about the most sacred 
ideals of our Nation—life, liberty, free-
dom from fear, freedom from disease. 
I don’t know what to say because I 
see what is happening right now. Peo-
ple speak passionately about a stand-
ard, defend themselves, cite historic 
precedent, and then when things shift 
and they have a chance to show con-
sistency and to show restraint, show 
allegiance to comity, show allegiance 
to the ideals that bond us together, 
they instead turn their backs on their 
very words. Instead, they betray the 
principle and rule that they set in 
place. 
If it was just politics, that would be 
one thing, but what is at stake is the 
healthcare of Americans. There are 
people afraid tonight. There are people 
scared across our country—a parent 
with a child who has a rare cancer, an 
adult struggling to afford their pre-
scription drugs, someone who is out of 
a job, someone with a preexisting con-
dition. This is not about politics. This 
is about them. It is about their lives 
and their well-being.

by rushing this through to get another

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

September 22, 2020 
wants the Affordable Care Act to fail, 
what will that mean? Where will that 
leave us when this decision goes to 
that Supreme Court with three Jus-
tices—one of whom should have been 
Barack Obama’s? 
Justice Ginsburg stood up for our 
ideals. She stood up for this belief that 
it is the little person, it is the person 
with the margins of life, it is the per-
son who has been demeaned and de-
graded by powerful forces—that they 
should have equality. She fought for 
and won battles that my generation 
takes for granted. 
Her last dying wish was not about 
one President or another but that we 
should wait until after this election. I 
believe she said that not just because 
of the conflicts of our time, she said 
that not just because she believed it 
was right but because she believed in 
the Supreme Court. She believed that 
the Supreme Court, no matter what 
the politics of our time, should be a 
place that holds legitimacy in the Re-
public, that America should not see 
that 
as 
a 
body 
that 
could 
be 
politicalized by the behaviors of Con-
gress, so she said: Wait. 
Ironically, it is the same sentiment 
that my colleagues said we should do 
when Merrick Garland was nominated. 
Then, they were with Justice Ginsburg. 
I tell you, she may be gone, but they 
should honor her in truth right now by 
upholding that sentiment, their senti-
ments, the very idea that could pos-
sibly 
give 
us 
more 
hope—that 
healthcare, that life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness can win the day. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleague from New 
Jersey, Senator BOOKER, for an out-
standing statement from the heart. 
I think about this moment in his-
tory. I think about the fact that just a 
few weeks ago, we were mourning the 
loss of John Lewis. He was a personal 
friend, a champion and inspiration, one 
of the real pillars of the civil rights 
movement of the 1960s, who lived on to 
this day and carried the torch for so 
many years when it came to civil 
rights and equal rights. I will miss 
him. 
Now there is another loss of another 
giant. Although she was small in stat-
ure, Ruth Bader Ginsburg had an amaz-
ing life story. She was an extraor-
dinarily bright young woman who just 
asked for a chance to get a job in New 
York with one of the law firms, but be-
cause she was a woman, they turned 
her away. That lost job must have been 
a disappointment to her, but as we re-
flect on it in the history of this Nation, 
it was the biggest break we ever had 
when it came to the cause of women in 
modern times because she went on to 
become a law clerk, a professor, a 
judge, and ultimately a Supreme Court 
Justice. 
In the course of that career, she was 
such a powerful and effective advocate 
for the cause of women across America 
and, I might add, for the cause of men 
too. She made history. That job rejec-
tion may have been a disappointment 
for a day, but as we reflect on it, thank 
goodness she was steered to another 
path and used it so effectively. 
If you left this Chamber tonight and 
walked across the street to the Su-
preme Court, you would find a large 
group of people, as you have since last 
Friday, pausing, reflecting, thanking, 
praying for Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s life. 
Across there tonight, they are lighting 
candles, dropping flowers and notes, 
crying, commiserating, really noting 
the loss America feels. 
I was struck personally by my own 
family’s reaction. My daughter, my 
daughter-in-law, and so many others 
confided in me in ways they rarely do 
about how much this woman meant to 
them. It was time for reflection in my 
family and, I am sure, a lot of those 
across the United States. 
She had one last request, one dying 
wish. She handed it to her grand-
daughter and she said: Let the next 
President pick my successor on the Su-
preme Court. It is understandable that 
she would do that. I know she probably 
had a hope in her heart as to who that 
person might be, but she knew, after 
the way the vacancy of Antonin Scalia 
was treated by the Republicans in the 
Senate, that was the way they were 
going to handle her situation—at least 
we thought they would. 
Then, of course, Senator MCCONNELL 
announced a 180-degree reversal in 
principle—180-degree reversal. Instead 
of waiting for the election and new in-
auguration of the President to fill her 
vacancy, he made it clear that Repub-
licans in the Senate are hell-bent to 
fill this vacancy as fast as possible. 
What is the hurry? Why have they 
changed their position after 4 years? 
Do they doubt that President Trump is 
going to be reelected? Did that play 
into this equation? Who knows. But 
they are determined to do it because 
they have an agenda which is more im-
portant than consistency, more impor-
tant than honor, more important than 
principle. Their agenda is to turn back 
the achievements and progress made by 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and to leave the 
American people more vulnerable in 
their time of need. 
A few weeks ago, I took a poll in Illi-
nois to see what the public sentiment 
might be on issues. I was a little sur-
prised how overwhelming the issue of 
healthcare still is in my State of Illi-
nois. As I reflected on it, it made sense. 
We wake up every day, looking for our 
masks, wondering how many more peo-
ple have died, hoping that we can pro-
tect ourselves and our families. So 
healthcare is on the forefront of every-
one’s mind, and, of course, protection 
for your family is always your first in-
stinct. People know that without the 
Affordable Care Act they will not have 
that protection. 
We remember—many of us do—the 
debate in creating the Affordable Care 
Act 10 years ago. I might say, in my 
House and Senate careers, it is the 
most important issue I have ever voted 
on. When again will I be able to help 20 
million Americans find health insur-
ance for the first time? When will there 
be another opportunity to make sure 
that health insurance sold in America 
treats people fairly? 
The Affordable Care Act eliminated 
lifetime limits on payouts, which is 
eminently sensible when you consider 
the skyrocketing cost of medical care 
and how so many situations in life are 
so darned expensive. It said to people: 
You cannot be discriminated against 
because you have a preexisting condi-
tion. 
I remember the day—most of us do— 
when applying for health insurance was 
a long list of questions, and if you hap-
pened to just check one of those ‘‘yes,’’ 
be prepared, because it meant you had 
a preexisting condition, and you were 
about to be charged a higher premium, 
if they would allow you to buy health 
insurance. Families with children who 
survived 
cancer 
knew 
what 
that 
meant—health insurance they couldn’t 
afford or health insurance that wasn’t 
available. The Affordable Care Act 
changes that and says you cannot dis-
criminate against a person because of a 
preexisting condition. 
When we looked at some of the pre-
existing conditions health insurance 
companies were boldly announcing, 
well, of course, gender could be a pre-
existing condition. Women did have to 
pay higher premiums, you know. Think 
of that: gender as a preexisting condi-
tion. That was one of the tricks to 
deny coverage or to raise premium 
costs. 
Then, when it came to covering your 
kids, we remember what it was like— 
many of us do—when our kids grad-
uated college, thought they were invin-
cible, and took part-time jobs with no 
benefits. 
I remember calling my daughter and 
asking: ‘‘Jennifer, do you have health 
insurance anymore?’’ 
‘‘No, Dad. I am just fine.’’ 
Well, we got her health insurance, 
and it cost a pretty penny. 
Now, under the Affordable Care Act, 
I could have kept my daughter under 
my family plan until she had reached 
the age of 26, when she would have had 
a better chance of having a better job 
with benefits. 
That is one of the things the Afford-
able Care Act did, but the Trump ad-
ministration and the Republicans in 
Congress have been determined to kill 
the Affordable Care Act from the day it 
passed. There were over 50 rollcall 
votes in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives to eliminate the Affordable Care 
Act. They all might have passed the 
House, but they were not taken up by 
the Democratic Senate. 
They waited for the day, and the day 
finally came. Senator MCCONNELL had 
the majority, and he was setting up to 
eliminate the Affordable Care Act here 
on the floor of the Senate. I will never

S5756 
September 22, 2020 
forget that night or that early morn-
ing. At 2:30 in the morning, those doors 
opened. John McCain, who was very 
sick—we knew he didn’t have long for 
this world—had just left a phone con-
versation with President Trump. He 
walked to that well, and he barely lift-
ed that right arm that had been crip-
pled during his prisoner of war experi-
ence in Vietnam. He lifted it just 
enough to say ‘‘no,’’ and John McCain’s 
‘‘no’’ saved the Affordable Care Act for 
millions of Americans. 
Did the Republicans learn their les-
son? No. They decided that, if they 
couldn’t win it on the floor of the 
House and if they couldn’t win it on 
the floor of the Senate, they would win 
it across the street with the Supreme 
Court. That is what this is all about. 
That is why Senator MCCONNELL has 
reversed his position—a position which 
he claimed to be principled. He has re-
versed his position on filling the va-
cancy on the Supreme Court in a Presi-
dent’s last year and has said that he is 
going to, with determination, fill this 
seat. 
The chairman of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, LINDSEY GRAHAM, who 
is a friend of mine—and I work with 
him—had to explain to the American 
people why he reversed his position 
completely on this issue. Then he an-
nounced last night that every Repub-
lican Member of the Senate Committee 
on the Judiciary was going to vote for 
President Trump’s nominee. You would 
have thought he would have waited 
until that nominee had been an-
nounced, but, clearly, it doesn’t make 
any difference. They know that who-
ever that nominee will be will be hell- 
bent on going across the street and 
eliminating the Affordable Care Act in 
the Supreme Court. 
That is why this issue is not just a 
matter of debate between the highest 
ranking politicians in Washington but 
is a matter that affects everyone 
across America who buys health insur-
ance, and that is just about all of us. It 
is to make sure that health insurance 
is worth owning and will be there when 
you need it. 
I see some colleagues on the floor, 
and I want to yield to them because I 
know they have their own thoughts to 
share with you, but it troubles me 
greatly what has happened to this Sen-
ate. This big Chamber, this big room, 
has turned into a museum piece in 
Washington, DC. We don’t entertain 
visitors anymore because of COVID–19, 
but if they were to come, they could 
peer down at the desks and say: Well, 
that is where people used to stand, 
called Senators, who actually legis-
lated. We don’t do that anymore here. 
It is very seldom. Instead, we take up 
these partisan causes, like filling the 
Federal judiciary with ideologues and 
violating the traditions of the Senate 
to fill Supreme Court vacancies. 
This Chamber is just a room, but the 
Senate is 100 people—100 people bound 
together by history, tradition, rules, 
and mutual respect. What we are wit-
nessing now with the Senate’s effort by 
the Republicans to fill this Supreme 
Court vacancy before a new President 
is elected is a violation of all four—his-
tory, tradition, rules, and the mutual 
respect that is important in this body. 
I hope that we can recover from it, 
not only for the good of the Senate but 
for the good of the Supreme Court, and 
that we can come out of this with a de-
termination to try to put this Chamber 
back on track. This is a sad and dark 
moment—a loss of a wonderful woman 
who served this country so well and 
this effort to replace her in a manner 
that does not speak to the best in-
stincts and history of the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, this 
past Friday, our Nation lost a giant of 
a jurist and a champion of gender 
equality, 
workers’ 
rights, 
voting 
rights, and civil rights. Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg understood the critical 
importance of the Supreme Court in 
safeguarding our constitutional indi-
vidual rights. 
About 2 years ago, I was sitting next 
to Justice Ginsburg at a dinner, and we 
were talking about the concerns we 
had about a very divided Supreme 
Court. She shared her concerns that we 
would see many more 5-to-4 decisions 
coming in the future, decisions that 
would roll back civil rights’ protec-
tions, 
workers’ 
rights, 
individual 
rights, 
efforts 
to 
address 
climate 
change, and, clearly, a woman’s right 
to choose—decisions that would harm 
everyday Americans. 
As someone who had been on the 
Court for more than a quarter of a cen-
tury, Justice Ginsburg had understood 
the dangers of partisan split decisions. 
She had spent more than two decades 
standing up for gender equality, voting 
rights, 
workers’ 
rights, 
and 
civil 
rights. She was often also a key vote in 
upholding critical rights for everyday 
Americans, such as clean air and clean 
water protections. 
Within a few years of joining the Su-
preme Court, Justice Ginsburg had 
written a landmark opinion in a 7-to-1 
decision that had struck down the Vir-
ginia Military Institute’s traditional 
male-only admissions policy. She had 
spoken for nearly the entire Court 
when she had written that the differen-
tial treatment of men and women 
‘‘may not be used . . . to create or per-
petuate the legal, social, and economic 
inferiority of women.’’ 
More recently, Justice Ginsburg’s 
powerful voice had led dissents against 
partisan 5-to-4 decisions. 
In 2007, she led the dissent in 
Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber 
Co., where the bare 5-to-4 majority of 
the Court had undermined the plain 
language ability to bring gender pay 
discrimination claims. Justice Gins-
burg took the rare step of reading her 
dissent from the bench, saying: ‘‘In our 
view, the court does not comprehend, 
or is indifferent to, the insidious way 
in which women can be victims of pay 
discrimination.’’ 
I was a Member of the U.S. House of 
Representatives when the Ledbetter 
decision came down, and I was appalled 
that a bare majority of the Court inter-
preted the relevant statute in a way 
that it had not been intended. Justice 
Ginsburg invited the Congress to fix 
the statute to make its intent clearer. 
At that time, Representative George 
Miller, the chair of the House Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, on which 
I served, then led the way to pass the 
Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and it 
was the first bill that President Obama 
signed into law in 2009. 
In 2013, Justice Ginsburg wrote a 
scathing dissent in the 5-to-4 decision 
of Shelby County v. Holder, where a 
bare majority of the Court once again 
gutted the Voting Rights Act. She 
wrote 
then: 
‘‘Throwing 
out 
preclearance when it has worked and is 
continuing to work to stop discrimina-
tory changes is like throwing away 
your umbrella in a rainstorm because 
you are not getting wet.’’ 
Immediately after Shelby County, as 
should 
have 
been 
expected, 
many 
States passed voter suppression laws 
that made it much more difficult for 
communities of color to vote. That was 
the intention of those laws that these 
States passed. These voter suppression 
efforts are ongoing even as we speak, 
and they will have a negative impact— 
a really negative impact—on the 2020 
election. 
In 2018, she rebuked the 5-to-4 major-
ity in Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, 
which allowed companies to force their 
workers to arbitrate their claims one 
by one instead of seeking collective ac-
tion in court. Why one by one? Because 
the employer thought all of these em-
ployees are not going to fight us one by 
one by one. 
In calling the majority’s decision 
egregiously wrong, Justice Ginsburg 
noted: ‘‘The inevitable result of today’s 
decision will be the underenforcement 
of federal and state statutes designed 
to advance the well-being of vulnerable 
workers.’’ 
In fact, Epic Systems was one of the 
cases I brought up with Justice Gins-
burg when I sat next to her at dinner. 
I said that it was a horrible decision, 
and she said: ‘‘And I wrote the dis-
sent.’’ 
To honor Justice Ginsburg’s legacy, 
we should honor her final wish not to 
be replaced until a new President is in-
stalled. In fact, that is the rule the 
Senate Republicans made up in 2016. 
About 1 hour after Justice Scalia died 
on February 13, 2016, Senator MCCON-
NELL announced an unprecedented new 
rule—that the American people should 
have a voice in the selection of their 
next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, 
this vacancy should not be filled until 
we have a new President. Then, for the 
next 11 months, Senator MCCONNELL 
blocked President Obama from replac-
ing Justice Scalia on the Supreme 
Court. That vacancy existed for almost 
a year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5757 
September 22, 2020 
Back then, it didn’t take much for 
other Republicans to join Senator 
MCCONNELL. In fact, the rumor was 
that the majority leader had his Re-
publican colleagues all lined up to side 
with him before he even announced the 
so-called McConnell rule. That was 
then. This is now. 
Now that the tables are turned and 
we have a Republican President instead 
of a Democratic one, Senator MCCON-
NELL and his Republican colleagues are 
going back on their word. Within hours 
of Justice Ginsburg’s death, Senator 
MCCONNELL vowed: ‘‘President Trump’s 
Supreme Court nominee will receive a 
vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate.’’ 
This is what is known as a 180-degree 
turn—or talking out of both sides of 
your mouth. Of course, he is not the 
only one. 
In 2016, Senator GARDNER said: ‘‘I 
think the next president ought to 
choose the Supreme Court nominee, 
and I think it is only fair to the nomi-
nee themselves, and I think that is 
only fair to the integrity of the Su-
preme Court.’’ Yet, after Justice Gins-
burg’s passing, Senator GARDNER flip- 
flopped, indicating that, if President 
Trump nominates someone he likes, he 
will vote to confirm. 
In 2016, Senator TILLIS came to the 
Senate Chamber to declare: ‘‘It is es-
sential to the institution of the Senate 
and to the very health of our Republic 
not to launch our Nation into a par-
tisan, divisive confirmation battle dur-
ing the very same time the American 
people are casting their ballots to elect 
our next President.’’ 
But it took Senator TILLIS
fewer 
than 24 hours after Justice Ginsburg’s 
death to go back on his word and com-
mit to supporting the ‘‘conservative ju-
rist President Trump will nominate.’’ 
In 2016, Senator GRAHAM repeatedly 
stated: ‘‘The election cycle is well 
under way and the precedent of the 
Senate is not to confirm a nominee at 
this stage of the process.’’ 
He even doubled down on his promise, 
claiming: ‘‘I want you to use my words 
against me. . . . If there’s a Republican 
president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs 
in the last year of the first term, you 
can say Lindsey Graham said let’s let 
the next President, whoever it might 
be, make that nomination.’’ 
Then, 
a 
week 
after 
Justice 
Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford testified be-
fore the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
Senator GRAHAM said plainly to Jeffrey 
Goldberg of The Atlantic: ‘‘If an open-
ing comes’’—of course he was talking 
about a Supreme Court opening—‘‘If an 
opening comes in the last year of Presi-
dent Trump’s term, and the primary 
process is started, we’ll wait for the 
next election.’’ 
When my Democratic colleagues on 
the Judiciary Committee did what Sen-
ator GRAHAM asked—that we hold him 
to his word; we wrote a letter to him to 
stick by his word—he refused. He indi-
cated that he would ‘‘proceed expedi-
tiously to process any nomination 
made by President Trump to fill’’ Jus-
tice Ginsburg’s vacancy. 
There are other Republican Senators 
who stood up with Senator MCCONNELL 
in 2016 and now have changed their 
tune, 
including 
Senators 
PERDUE, 
ERNST, BARRASSO, and CORNYN. 
The question that American people 
should ask is, How can you trust people 
who don’t keep their word? 
This is an urgent question for the 
millions of Americans who will lose 
their healthcare and reproductive free-
doms if President Trump and Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL are successful in 
stealing yet another Supreme Court 
seat. 
The threat this nominee poses to the 
Affordable Care Act is not some eso-
teric debate we are having. It is not 
theoretical. On November 10, the Su-
preme Court will hear yet another par-
tisan challenge to the ACA. 
I have no doubt that Donald Trump 
and the majority leader want a new 
Justice in place to strike down the 
ACA, depriving millions of Americans 
of their health insurance, including 
millions with preexisting conditions. 
The more than 6 million Americans 
who have tested positive for COVID–19 
will likely be deemed to have a pre-
existing condition. Add them to the 
Americans who will be devastated if 
the ACA is struck down by the Trump 
nominee. Our healthcare is on the line 
with the next nominee, regardless of 
who the nominee is. 
Note that the Republicans are saying 
that every single Judiciary Republican 
is going to vote for the nominee, and 
we don’t even know who the nominee 
is. Well, obviously, it doesn’t matter 
who the nominee is. It will be someone 
who is expected to strike down the 
ACA. 
After all, repealing the ACA has long 
been No. 1 on the President’s and Re-
publicans’ hit list. But getting rid of 
the ACA is not the only thing the 
President is after. 
The President’s nominee will also op-
pose abortion rights. So that is next on 
their hit list. 
Let me be clear. The future of Roe v. 
Wade is on the line. The future of a 
woman being able to control her own 
body is on the line. 
With so much at stake with this 
nomination, the millions of Americans 
who revered Justice Ginsburg are not 
just going to sit by and do nothing 
while my Republican colleagues try to 
steal yet another Supreme Court seat. 
In fact, they are showing up in droves 
in front of the Supreme Court to show 
their support for all that Justice Gins-
burg stood for. 
They are going to fight back, and you 
can be assured I will be right there 
fighting back with them. They aren’t 
going to fall for the trumped-up jus-
tifications, explanations, and pretexts 
that Senate Republicans are using to 
go back on their word. And I am con-
fident that in 6 weeks’ time, the Amer-
ican people will hold them account-
able. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, first 
of all, I would like to thank my col-
league from Hawaii for her remarks 
just now and for her commitment to a 
more equal, more just United States of 
America. 
I rise tonight to join my colleagues 
in mourning the loss of Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. 
Justice Ginsburg was a brilliant ju-
rist and a persistent patriot. Her belief 
in our country and her vision and 
imagination as a lawyer left our Na-
tion stronger and more just. 
As a litigator, she fought and she 
won fights for women’s equality. And 
on the Court, she was a powerful voice 
for justice, whether in the majority or 
in dissent. 
Throughout her career and through 
the final days of her life, she was a 
powerful voice calling for every Amer-
ican to be recognized equally and to be 
treated with dignity, regardless of gen-
der or personal circumstances, and the 
progress and inclusion that she helped 
build throughout her life is a testa-
ment to both her tenacity and her un-
matched legal mind. It is also an illus-
tration of what is possible in our coun-
try when we reaffirm and stay true to 
our values. 
Justice Ginsburg’s vision of what it 
means to be an American and what it 
means to be free changed lives. She 
helped move our country toward a 
more perfect union, and we have to 
continue her unfinished work. 
Like many of my colleagues, I 
stopped by the Supreme Court over the 
weekend. It was incredible to see the 
outpouring of sheer reverence and to 
see the number of people who came on 
foot, on bicycle, in cars to pay their re-
spects. 
I overheard one mom explain to her 
children: ‘‘A lot of people loved her.’’ 
Then, a couple of seconds later, she 
added for the children: ‘‘And I want 
you to understand how important she 
was to our country.’’ 
I hope we all take the time to think 
about the meaning of Justice Gins-
burg’s life and what this loss means for 
our country. Honoring the legacy of 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg means continuing 
to fight for the more equal America 
that she fought for throughout her en-
tire career. 
Unfortunately, though, in a week in 
which America has reached a terrible 
milestone of 200,000 COVID–19 deaths, 
the Senate majority leader and Senate 
Republicans have made their priorities 
clear. Instead of working with Demo-
crats 
to 
pass 
the

COVID–19 relief bill that the American 
people so badly need, my colleagues 
across the aisle are focused on using all 
of the Senate’s time before the election 
to rush through the President’s choice 
for a lifetime appointment to the Su-
preme Court, and they are doing so in 
contradiction of the rules that they 
themselves invented in 2016, despite the 
fact that this election is not just immi-
nent, it is already underway with vot-
ers casting their ballots in States 
across the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5758 
September 22, 2020 
Our society and our democracy rely 
on the idea that all sides of political 
debates will play by the same rules. 
That means when any faction loses, it 
does so knowing that it will have a fair 
chance in the next round. When that 
understanding is disrupted, it desta-
bilizes our democracy, leaving people 
feeling disenfranchised. It is wrong, 
and it produces chaos and confusion, 
and it demonstrates a dangerous trend. 
My Republican colleagues are mak-
ing clear that they do not think the 
rules apply to them. It is worth taking 
a closer look at exactly why they are 
violating the rules that they set for 
themselves and applied to President 
Obama’s nominee just 4 years ago and 
what the impact of their backward pri-
orities will be for the American people. 
Right now, the Trump administra-
tion’s lawsuit to repeal the entire Af-
fordable Care Act and its protections 
for people with preexisting conditions 
is pending before the Supreme Court 
and, as you have heard from my col-
leagues, scheduled to be argued after 
the election. Make no mistake, rushing 
through this nomination is a last-ditch 
effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act 
through the courts after failing to do 
so legislatively for years. Even worse, 
the 
Republicans 
would 
undermine 
healthcare in the midst of a dev-
astating pandemic, just when it is 
needed most. 
Invalidating the ACA will also mean 
that those who survive COVID–19—and, 
as a result, will have preexisting condi-
tions for the rest of their lives—will no 
longer be protected by the ACA when 
they seek insurance coverage. 
Taking away healthcare from mil-
lions of Americans is just one of the 
many things at stake. Women’s rights, 
voting rights, civil rights, workers’ 
rights, so much of what Justice Gins-
burg stood for—they are all at risk. 
Senate Republicans are not just intent 
on filling this Supreme Court seat; 
they are intent on filling this seat with 
a person who will strip away some, if 
not all, of these rights. 
The stakes could not be higher, and 
the priorities of the American people 
are clear. We should follow the rules 
that the Republicans created in 2016. 
We should focus on COVID–19 relief. 
And we should not confirm a nominee 
until after the next President is inau-
gurated. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg believed in an 
America where equality would win out, 
where everyone played by the same 
rules in liberty and justice—in fact, in 
liberty ensured by justice. It would be 
a good thing if all of my colleagues 
who have the privilege of serving in 
this Chamber would reflect on that to 
honor the giant we just lost. 
God speed, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and 
God bless the United States of Amer-
ica. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I thank my colleague from New Hamp-
shire for her beautiful words. 
I rise today to join my colleagues in 
celebrating the life and legacy of a 
hero, an icon, and a woman way ahead 
of her time, Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg. 
She was a trailblazer who exceeded 
all expectations and, through her ex-
ample, helped young people, young 
women across this country believe that 
anything and everything is possible, 
and it is my hope that this Chamber 
can follow in her footsteps and exceed 
expectations when it comes to this pre-
cious democracy that we are supposed 
to hold and that we are supposed to 
take care of. 
A few years back, my daughter Abi-
gail and I got to see Justice Ginsburg— 
and I had met her a few times—but we 
were at an event, and we had our photo 
taken with her. 
Now, as you know, Abigail was in her 
early twenties, and Justice Ginsburg 
had become a cult figure at that point 
in her eighties—something we all as-
pire to—to the point where she had her 
own hashtag. 
So we had our photo taken, the three 
of us. Afterward my daughter came up, 
and she said: Mom, I got a photo of the 
‘‘Notorious RBG.’’ I am going to put it 
on my Facebook page. But, Mom, I 
hope you don’t mind; I am cutting you 
out. I just want one with RBG up there. 
Justice Ginsburg literally made jus-
tice cool for a lot of young people out 
there, and that legacy—that legacy, 
with all the people, the outpouring of 
love and support you see at the court-
house—continues. 
When people told Justice Ginsburg 
that she shouldn’t go to law school be-
cause she was a woman, what did she 
do? She went to Harvard, became the 
first woman to work on the Harvard 
Law Review, and then went on to grad-
uate from Columbia at the top of her 
class. 
As has been recounted many times, 
she literally was called before the dean 
of Harvard Law School, along with the 
eight other women who were in that 
class of all of those men, and asked 
why they would be taking the seat of a 
man. But that didn’t stop her. Nothing 
stopped her. When law firms in New 
York wouldn’t hire her because she was 
a young mother, what did she do? She 
became one of only two female law pro-
fessors at Rutgers University where 
she then wrote the brief that led the 
Supreme Court to decide for the first 
time that the Fourteenth Amendment 
of the Constitution should protect 
against laws that treat people dif-
ferently solely on the basis of sex. 
When they told her that despite her 
expertise and her novel theories of how 
to advance equal protection, when they 
told her that she shouldn’t argue equal 
protection cases before the Supreme 
Court, that maybe the chances would 
be better if a man would do it, what did 
she do? She argued six cases in front of 
the U.S. Supreme Court and leaves 
with five out of six victories. 
But she didn’t stop there. She was 
nominated as the second woman ever 
to serve on the Supreme Court after 
Sandra Day O’Connor. She was con-
firmed in the Senate by a vote of 96 to 
3. She served on the Supreme Court, 
the highest Court in the land, for 27 
years, standing up for equality and jus-
tice, and, as I noted, she became an 
international 
icon 
well 
into 
her 
eighties. 
She did all that by never giving up, 
and that inspires me as we deal with 
what is in front of us right now with 
this assault on our democracy. When 
the odds don’t look that good, you 
never give up. 
One of her important majority opin-
ions on the Court built on her work on 
equal protection as a young attorney. 
In United States v. Virginia, Justice 
Ginsburg wrote for a 7-to-1 majority 
that struck down the male-only admis-
sion policy at the Virginia Military In-
stitute. So she not only wrote the opin-
ion, she got a number of Republican- 
appointed Justices to join her. 
When she announced the opinion in 
Court, she said that the equal protec-
tion clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment prohibits any ‘‘law or official pol-
icy that denies to women, simply be-
cause they are women, equal oppor-
tunity to aspire, achieve, participate 
in, and contribute to society.’’ 
That opinion was joined by Justices 
appointed by both parties, including 
Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice San-
dra Day O’Connor, and Justice Ken-
nedy. It was an example of the prin-
ciple that guided Justice Ginsburg, in 
her words, to ‘‘fight for the things you 
care about, but do it in a way that will 
lead others to join you.’’ 
But she was also known for the opin-
ions she wrote in dissent and not only 
because she would wear what was 
sometimes fondly called her ‘‘dissent 
collar’’ when the opinion was an-
nounced at the Court. 
In Shelby County v. Holder, a 5-to-4 
majority struck down important parts 
of the Voting Rights Act that required 
jurisdictions with histories of racially 
motivated voter suppression to seek 
court or Department of Justice ap-
proval before changing voting laws, a 
process known as preclearance. 
Justice Ginsburg authored the dis-
sent, 
joined 
by 
Justices 
Breyer, 
Sotomayor, and Kagan, arguing that 
‘‘[t]hrowing out preclearance when it 
has worked and is continuing to work 
to stop discriminatory changes is like 
throwing away your umbrella in a rain-
storm because you are not getting 
wet.’’ 
After she finished reading her dissent 
in Court, she quoted Martin Luther 
King, Jr., saying that ‘‘the arc of the 
moral universe is long, but it bends to-
ward justice’’ and adding her own ca-
veat that it bends toward justice only 
‘‘if there is a steadfast commitment to 
see the task through to completion.’’ 
To see the task through to comple-
tion is part of our job as stewards of 
this democracy. We may not see it 
through to completion, but the least 
that we should do is do no harm, and

September 22, 2020 
the most that we should do is to make 
it better. That is what she stood for, 
and that is what I hope my colleagues 
will consider in the weeks to come. 
As we gather here tonight, we must 
also recognize that Justice Ginsburg’s 
work, as I noted, is still unfinished. 
Many of the values that she fought 
for—equality and justice—are still at 
stake. The Supreme Court will con-
tinue to make decisions about equal 
rights for women, LGBTQ equality, ac-
cess to clean air and clean water, fair 
elections, and workers’ rights. 
Just 1 week after the upcoming elec-
tion, the Court will hear arguments in 
a 
case 
challenging 
the 
constitu-
tionality of the Affordable Care Act 
which could put coverage for people 
with preexisting conditions at risk. 
That is what the court down in Texas 
held. People’s healthcare is literally on 
the line. If the Affordable Care Act is 
struck down, over 20 million Americans 
across the country could lose their 
health insurance right in the middle of 
this pandemic because there would be 
no requirement in place to protect 
them from being thrown off their in-
surance. 
When the stakes are this high, I urge 
my colleagues to grant what Justice 
Ginsburg described as her ‘‘most fer-
vent wish’’ that she will not be re-
placed, she said, ‘‘until a new President 
is installed.’’ Those are her dying 
words. Of course, she used the word 
‘‘fervent’’ because that is how she ap-
proached her life and her work. 
At its core, Justice Ginsburg’s wish 
is about fairness. It is about what is 
right and what is just. 
Four years ago, Leader MCCONNELL 
created a new rule for Supreme Court 
nominations. He refused to consider 
President Obama’s nomination, as is 
well known, of Merrick Garland to the 
Supreme Court because the country 
was 9 months from an election, and, in 
his words, ‘‘the American people should 
have a voice in the selection of their 
next Supreme Court Justice.’’ 
So here we are, 42 days until the 
Presidential election, and people have 
already started voting. They are voting 
in my State not only by mail, as we 
speak, but also in person at early vot-
ing places all across our State. 
It is our Republican colleagues that 
set that precedent, and now they must 
follow it. 
Tonight, I urge my colleagues not to 
fill this vacancy until the American 
people have voted. People are deciding 
right now who should be President. If 
you go back in history, the only time a 
Justice died this close to the election 
was during the time of Abraham Lin-
coln, when Justice Taney died who was 
sadly, infamously, known for writing 
the Dred Scott opinion. He died the 
closest to an election of anyone until 
Justice Ginsburg. 
And what did Lincoln do? He waited 
until after the election, until after he 
saw if he won, until after he knew what 
the makeup of the Senate was. He 
didn’t do it because he was a wise man 
and because his interest, as we know, 
was to bring our country together and 
to do everything he could in his power 
to stop the divide and to have ‘‘one na-
tion under God.’’ 
My colleagues will have to decide 
what to do based on their own integ-
rity, their own commitment to justice. 
As 
Justice 
Ginsburg 
demonstrated, 
lawyers fight for justice. If you live 
and breathe that fight like Justice 
Ginsburg did her entire career, that is 
our job, too, to fight for justice, but we 
have an even more extraordinary bur-
den and that is also to uphold this de-
mocracy and to keep this country to-
gether. 
Justice Ginsburg did it in her own 
way, in her own life. Despite having in-
credibly different opinions about the 
law as Justice Scalia, they were true 
friends, and she was able to work with 
him. 
Well, we need to see more of that 
here. It doesn’t mean that we have to 
agree on who the next President is. It 
doesn’t mean that we even have to 
agree on who the next Justice will be, 
but our job is to maintain stability in 
this country, to bridge that divide, to 
bring people together, and to simply 
let the people decide. 
I think it is because of that unique 
characteristic she had of being a fight-
er, of being a hero, of taking risks, of 
never giving up but also doing it in a 
way where people could feel that they 
knew her. Even people who disagreed 
with her—including in this institu-
tion—respected her. 
Well, now the eyes are on this place, 
and it is our job to earn the respect of 
the American people. The reason we 
have seen so many people expressing 
their grief at the steps of the Supreme 
Court and across the country is be-
cause of that respect. Justice Ginsburg 
opened doors for women at a time when 
so many insisted on keeping them 
shut, and on the Supreme Court, time 
and again, she made the case for jus-
tice. 
For a woman of so many firsts, it is 
fitting that this coming Friday she will 
be the first woman to lie in state in the 
U.S. Capitol. So let’s remember her 
fight, her legacy, and her fervent 
wish—all of us—about securing equal-
ity, fairness, and justice for every per-
son in our country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as 
our colleague just said tonight, you 
can’t even remember any other mem-
ber of the Federal judiciary who be-
came a cultural icon, recognized only 
by their initials. RBG did, and she 
earned her recognition and her place in 
history through an astounding career 
fighting for gender equality, for the 
rights of LGBTQ individuals, and for 
the rights of everybody who had been 
pushed to the margins of American so-
ciety. 
MITCH MCCONNELL and Donald Trump 
have now, unfortunately, made it very 
clear that they are going to pull out all 
the stops to unravel the exceptional 
work of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and they 
are going to break their own rule— 
their own rule. It is not something that 
was debated on the other side. They de-
cided to break their own rule per-
taining to election-year appointments 
to undo the historical record of Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. 
For a moment, I want to compare 
this to another time. When I was a 
young man right out of law school, I 
served for a number of years as co-
director of the Oregon Gray Panthers 
at home. Back then, just like now, 
there were a lot of issues that were on 
people’s minds. Just like today, where 
there have been lists of issues miles 
long—from the rights of LGBTQ Amer-
icans to workers’ rights, to the ability 
of every eligible American to vote, and 
much more—there was a similarly long 
list of issues back when I worked with 
the senior citizens. 
I made the judgment then, because of 
spending that time with older people, 
that healthcare was far and away—far 
and away, colleagues—the most impor-
tant issue because if you and your 
loved ones don’t have your health, then 
pretty much everything else goes by 
the board. You can’t spend time with 
family. You can’t achieve all you want 
in your job. You can’t even have a 
chance to walk about outside on a 
pleasant 
evening 
like 
this. 
So 
healthcare to me and to millions of 
Americans is far and away the most 
important issue in front of this body. 
Now, this is the one issue—the one 
issue that will come up immediately 
with the Trump-backed lawsuit going 
before the Court soon after the elec-
tion. So make no mistake about it, and 
I know it is awfully hard to follow all 
the legalese and the procedural mo-
tions. At one point my wife said—I 
think Senator MERKLEY
may have 
heard this. When my wife said she 
would marry me, she said: You are a 
lawyer, not probably a particularly 
good one, but I am sure glad you did a 
good job for the senior citizens. It is 
hard to follow all the legalese and all 
the procedure. 
When you set aside all of that sur-
rounding the fact that healthcare will 
be the one issue coming up imme-
diately with the Trump-backed law-
suits soon after the election, tonight 
we say to the American people that 
healthcare in America is at stake. The 
Affordable Care Act is at stake, and 
coverage for 130 million Americans 
with preexisting conditions is at stake. 
If you don’t trust Republicans with 
your healthcare, you cannot trust Re-
publicans with this Supreme Court 
seat. 
Donald Trump and the Justice De-
partment are suing to have the entire 
Affordable Care Act thrown out—every 
last bit of it thrown out. So I just want 
to walk through what this means from 
sea to shining sea. 
If they are successful, the ironclad 
guaranteed coverage for preexisting

conditions is gone; the ban on discrimi-
nation against women is gone; the ban 
on annual and lifetime limits, gone; 
coverage for young people on their par-
ents’ plans, gone; guaranteed essential 
benefits for all with coverage, gone; no- 
cost contraceptives for women, gone; 
cheaper prescription drugs for seniors 
on Medicare, gone; Medicaid coverage 
for millions and millions of Americans, 
gone. Most importantly, colleagues, be-
cause of the Affordable Care Act, mil-
lions of Americans can go to bed to-
night knowing that they will have se-
cure, decent healthcare when they 
wake up in the morning. If the Trump 
lawsuit is successful, that, too, will be 
gone. That is the Trump agenda on the 
Affordable Care Act—ripping it out by 
the roots no matter how much pain is 
inflicted on the American people. 
By the way, I made mention of the 
Gray Panthers. Let’s understand. In 
this country, we always love to move 
forward. This is a direct trip back. The 
Affordable Care Act locked in protec-
tions for those with a preexisting con-
dition who had faced discrimination. A 
victory for Donald Trump in court 
means you turn back the clock to the 
days when healthcare was for the 
healthy and wealthy because that is 
what you have if you allow discrimina-
tion against those with preexisting 
conditions. 
In 2017, the President tried and failed 
to get the Congress to repeal the Af-
fordable Care Act, so he couldn’t get it 
done. My colleagues here, Senator 
SCHUMER and Senator MERKLEY—we all 
remember 
that 
night 
and 
John 
McCain’s hugely consequential role. 
Donald Trump couldn’t get the Con-
gress to repeal the Affordable Care Act, 
so now he is trying to do it at the Su-
preme Court. 
Donald Trump’s Department of Jus-
tice is bringing to the Court—along 
with dozens of Republican State attor-
neys general—what I think is a lot of 
legal nonsense, but that might not 
matter to far-right activist judges who 
would seize this opportunity to hand a 
big, big win to the insurance compa-
nies, the drug companies, and other 
special interests at the expense of 
Americans who are vulnerable. 
Particularly after Justice Ginsburg’s 
passing, there is a real chance that the 
Supreme Court will hand down a par-
tisan ruling giving the President the 
win he wants so much over the Afford-
able Care Act. If he gets to choose the 
person who takes the seat held by the 
revered RBG, the Affordable Care Act 
will be gone, and the Republican 
healthcare agenda is coming, and it is 
coming after vulnerable Americans 
from sea to shining sea. 
Donald Trump might tell you some-
thing different, but the American peo-
ple know he doesn’t often tell the truth 
about healthcare. Once in a while, the 
truth does come out. That is what hap-
pened one day back in May, the last 
day he had the opportunity to pull out 
of this anti-ACA lawsuit before the 
Court. The President was asked wheth-
er he might have a last-minute change 
of heart, but he made his goal clear. He 
said: 
‘‘We 
want 
to 
terminate 
healthcare under ObamaCare.’’ That 
was in May. 
Hospitals 
in 
COVID–19 
hotspots 
around the Nation were full of Ameri-
cans at that time who were dying alone 
amid a global contagion that had shut 
down our country. Not even a nation-
wide public health disaster could get 
Donald Trump to reconsider his posi-
tion on the Affordable Care Act. 
If Donald Trump wins the Supreme 
Court case, having had the coronavirus 
will be a preexisting condition, and in-
surance companies can use it to dis-
criminate against you. 
It obviously goes without saying that 
the Trump agenda would leave Amer-
ican healthcare in ruins. He has fraud-
ulently promised a new and com-
prehensive healthcare plan. We stopped 
counting after 9 or 10 times, but it is 
all a fraud because all this administra-
tion has done since day one is make 
healthcare worse and more expensive 
for Americans. 
I have tried to point out that even 
Medicare is headed for a crisis because 
of Donald Trump and his incompetent 
administration. 
He 
knew 
the 
coronavirus was highly contagious and 
a lethal pandemic, but he denied it for 
weeks and weeks while the virus spread 
nationwide. When the pandemic even-
tually exploded, the economy shut 
down, and that has been devastating, 
as I have pointed out, to the finances of 
Medicare. The Medicare trust fund will 
be insolvent within 4 years during the 
next Presidential term. 
So we have said on the Finance Com-
mittee, where we have jurisdiction over 
Medicare, that whoever wins this elec-
tion is going to be in charge during the 
biggest crisis Medicare has ever faced. 
If Donald Trump is in charge, I believe 
it will be the end of the Medicare guar-
antee of defined, secure, and high-qual-
ity benefits for the older people of this 
country. Seniors may have to figure 
out 
some 
other 
way 
to 
pay 
for 
healthcare, prescription drugs. 
The bottom line is, wiping out the 
guarantee of healthcare is what the 
Trump agenda has always been about— 
gutting 
the 
Affordable 
Care 
Act 
through 
regulations, 
bringing 
back 
junk insurance, and cutting access to 
women’s healthcare. If Donald Trump 
fills the Ginsburg seat and has the Su-
preme Court totally on his side, you 
can bet the courts will be siding 
against typical Americans and for spe-
cial interests with every opportunity. 
Let me close simply by touching on 
one other vital healthcare issue. Wom-
en’s healthcare—particularly reproduc-
tive healthcare—is right at the center 
of this debate about the future of the 
Ginsburg seat. Republican lawmakers 
have been trying to throw that away 
after more than 45 years of settled law. 
They have been fighting to go against 
the majority opinion of the American 
people and overturn Roe v. Wade, deny-
ing a woman’s right to access to 
healthcare that woman—that woman— 
says she needs. 
Even today, just a few hours ago, 
Senate Republicans dusted off a dec-
ades-old anti-science battle against the 
safe 
and 
mainstream 
reproductive 
health medication formerly known as 
RU486. The bill they proposed, which 
Democrats have blocked, comes down 
to a backdoor ban on safe and legal 
medication 
for 
reproductive 
healthcare. Major new regulations re-
strict women’s access to essential, 
time-sensitive 
medications, 
putting 
the 
government 
right 
in 
between 
women and their doctors. This is 
wrong, wrong, wrong. It was wrong 
when Republicans were waging the 
same ideological battle 30 years ago 
and wrong when you now try to take 
away women’s reproductive healthcare 
choices, because more women will die. 
What sense does it make to bring this 
anti-science and anti-women’s health 
proposal forward in the middle of a rag-
ing pandemic? 
Today, the country crossed a horren-
dous milestone—200,000 American lives 
lost to COVID–19. All that mass death 
and suffering. Republicans aren’t work-
ing across the aisle to close the short-
age gap on personal protective gear or 
expand access to care; they are busy 
spending time waging an endless cam-
paign 
against 
women 
getting 
healthcare. 
With the passing of Justice Ginsburg, 
the campaign reaches a new stage. In 
my view, it is not just a question of 
what happens to Roe v. Wade or access 
to therapies and drugs; it is about a 
much bigger and more dangerous prop-
osition—government control over wom-
en’s bodies. Donald Trump and the Re-
publican Party are working toward 
that kind of government control, and it 
means government control over wom-
en’s futures. That is what is at stake. 
That is what Justice Ginsburg fought 
so hard against. 
She has left, as I call it, an astound-
ing legacy of fighting on the side of 
fairness and equality again and again 
for so many people who didn’t have 
power, didn’t have clout, and didn’t 
have lobbies. What an American hero. 
In my view, she has made it clear for 
all of us here that now, to protect her 
legacy, we have an immediate, five- 
alarm, DEFCON issue, and that is 
healthcare, healthcare, healthcare. 
As I have been saying since late Fri-
day night, if you don’t trust Repub-
licans with your healthcare, you can-
not trust Republicans with this elec-
tion or this Supreme Court seat. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER

ROUNDS). The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will 
be brief. 
First, I want to thank all of my col-
leagues who have already spoken and 
who will speak. We have over 15 of our 
colleagues talking about this issue be-
cause it is so vitally important to the 
American people. 
Now, let me tell you a little tale.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5761 
September 22, 2020 
Goldwater lost for the Presidency, 
some of the hard-rock conservatives re-
alized that they had to create some-
thing that would help them realize 
their goals, and it gradually grew and 
grew and grew and by 1980 was very 
strong with the election of Ronald 
Reagan. 
At that point, these conservatives re-
alized that their views would never be 
enacted by the elected branches of gov-
ernment—the article I branch and the 
article II branch—because their views 
were so far to the right of not only the 
average American but even the average 
Republican. They realized that the one 
way they could move America in their 
hard-right direction was the courts, 
the nonelected branch. They endeav-
ored to place, through many different 
organizations—at the top of the list, 
the Federalist Society, but many oth-
ers—these people, many of whom they 
had cultivated since they were in law 
school, on the bench. 
This vacancy caused by the unfortu-
nate death of RBG would lock in this 
hard-right agenda for a generation—for 
a generation. All the things that people 
in America believe in could be undone 
by an unelected group, the Supreme 
Court of the United States. 
As my colleague from Oregon just 
outlined, healthcare would be so far 
away from what the American people 
need. 
The right of a woman to choose. The 
right of a woman to healthcare. The 
ACA, which they want to repeal, which 
will go before the Court, has protec-
tions for women’s healthcare—gone. 
The right of unions. This Court, even 
without such a conservative majority, 
pushed forward the Janus case. I be-
lieve their goal is to eliminate all 
unions and make America a right-to- 
work country, as they have endeavored 
to make many States right-to-work. 
LGBTQ rights, passed because of the 
courageous actions of Justice Kennedy, 
could be evaporated. 
Climate, 
dealing 
with 
climate 
change—we could see the Clean Air 
Clean Water Act eviscerated by this 
new rightwing Court. 
Voting rights—one of the most awful 
decisions, the Shelby decision, led by 
Chief Justice Roberts, where they said 
‘‘Oh, there is no more discrimination in 
America; we don’t need the Federal 
Government 
to 
protect 
voting 
rights’’—undone, and we have seen 
what happened throughout the country 
since then. 
And civil rights—just about anything 
that this country has made progress on 
and holds dear—will be undone by this 
new Court. 
This is not just a political debate be-
tween Democrats and Republicans. I 
tell the American people: Everything 
you need and want—just about every-
thing—will be taken away inexorably, 
month after month, year after year, de-
cision after decision, by this new 
Court, which, as my colleague from 
Rhode Island has ably documented, has 
been put forward by a hard-right group 
led by some very narrow, greedy people 
who don’t want to pay any taxes and 
who don’t want any government regu-
lation. They are rich and powerful. 
They don’t want anyone interfering 
with any of that. 
We will rue the day—rue the day— 
that we add another hard-right Fed-
eralist Society-approved jurist to this 
Supreme Court, and America will have 
a very, very difficult time recovering. 
I urge my Republican colleagues, who 
know the hypocrisy of saying to 
Merrick Garland ‘‘You shouldn’t go 
forward’’ but to this new nominee ‘‘You 
should,’’ for the sake of this body, for 
the sake of the country, for the sake of 
progress, for the sake of the viability 
and forward advance of our citizenry, 
think twice—think twice. 
It is going to be a sad day in America 
and will lead to very bad consequences 
for this country if a solid, hard-right 
majority on this Court is able to rule 
over our lives. 
I hope, I pray, and I will do every-
thing I can to see that that doesn’t 
happen. 
I yield the floor and thank my col-
league for his yielding for these brief 
moments. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I join 
my colleagues here on the floor tonight 
to honor and pay tribute to a remark-
able legal mind, an incredible Amer-
ican, an icon, an inspiration, and a 
wonderful human being: Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, known to the younger 
generation as the ‘‘Notorious RBG.’’ 
RBG was born into a world in which 
few, if any, opportunities existed for 
women beyond the role of wife and 
mother. She helped build a world in 
which the doors were opened; the doors 
of opportunity were blown wide. It was 
a powerful, powerful undertaking, and 
she was extraordinarily successful in 
it. 
She graduated from high school at 15. 
She went on to college. She went on to 
law school. She graduated in a class of 
500 students, and she tied for first in 
her class in 1959. I was 3 years old at 
that point. 
Then she applied for jobs, and she 
faced the discrimination of ‘‘You are a 
woman, so we cannot hire you at our 
corporate law firm.’’ 
Then she applied for clerkships with 
the Supreme Court, and the Supreme 
Court Justices said: You are a woman, 
and our doors are closed to you. 
Perhaps this was a fortuitous mo-
ment because she went on, therefore, 
to take on a job as professor at Colum-
bia University and from that to lead 
the Women’s Rights Project at the 
ACLU. As director of the ACLU Wom-
en’s Rights Project, she argued six 
landmark gender discrimination cases 
before the Court. Plain language, great 
heart, brilliant logic, and considerable 
legal tactics went into winning five of 
those six cases—an incredible record 
for anyone who has appeared before the 
Court. 
One of the tactics she undertook was 
to argue cases where men were being 
discriminated against because they 
were men, and by winning those cases, 
she established a principle where nei-
ther men nor women could be discrimi-
nated against. 
There is the Frontiero v. Richardson 
case in 1973, where a female Air Force 
lieutenant sued to get the benefits for 
her husband that a male member of the 
military would normally get for his 
wife. By winning that case, she opened 
the door to the concept, the principle, 
that gender discrimination is not ac-
ceptable under our Constitution. 
She put forward and argued the case 
of Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld in 1975 just 
2 years later, again, arguing for a man 
who, as a spouse, was denied Social Se-
curity benefits that were available to a 
woman as a spouse and, by winning 
that case, more deeply established the 
premise that under our Constitution, 
you cannot discriminate on gender. 
She went on to the Court and had 
many momentous decisions that she 
wrote and dissents that she wrote. One 
of the cases that she wrote the major-
ity opinion on was an 7-to-1 case to 
overturn Virginia Military Institute’s 
men-only policy, arguing that it vio-
lated the 14th Amendment’s equal pro-
tection clause. 
She wrote the following: ‘‘Women 
seeking and fit for a VMI quality edu-
cation cannot be offered anything less, 
under the State’s obligation to afford 
them genuinely equal protection.’’ 
She 
continued: 
‘‘Generalizations 
about ‘the way women are,’ estimates 
of what is appropriate for most women, 
no longer justify denying opportunity 
to women whose talent and capacity 
place them outside the average descrip-
tion.’’ And a law that ‘‘denies to 
women, 
simply 
because 
they 
are 
women, full citizenship stature—equal 
opportunity to aspire, achieve, partici-
pate in and contribute to society,’’ vio-
lates the equal protection clause. Eight 
to one, that is a massive victory. 
I thought it was very interesting, the 
point she often made in her dissent. 
The Supreme Court decided in the 2007 
case of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & 
Rubber Co.—the majority said: Do you 
know what? If you have been discrimi-
nated against in pay in your job, and 
you learn about it years later, you can 
no longer appeal for redress because 
you would had to have come to the 
Court at the moment the discrimina-
tion first occurred. Of course, that was 
a catch-22, an impossible situation. If 
you didn’t know about it, you couldn’t 
possibly come to the Court. She ad-
dressed this, and she said: The major-
ity does not ‘‘comprehend, or is indif-
ferent to, the insidious way in which 
women can be victims of paid discrimi-
nation.’’ So she called on Congress to 
act to address, really, this mistaken 
opinion of the Court. And we did so in 
2009, the first year I came to the Sen-
ate. 
There is another dissent that I think 
was powerful: Shelby County v. Holder.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5762 
September 22, 2020 
The majority struck down Voting 
Rights Act protections against voter 
suppression and intimidation, arguing 
that those things no longer exist. It is 
as if you have a penalty for robbery 
that is so effective that everyone quits 
robbing, so you get rid of the law; the 
Supreme Court strikes down the law 
that says that robbery is an offense. It 
made no logical sense. However, in her 
dissent, she described it in a way we 
can all understand. She said the ruling 
was ‘‘like throwing away your um-
brella in a rainstorm because you are 
not getting wet.’’ 
The foundation she laid on gender 
discrimination created the foundation 
for similar arguments to end LGBTQ 
discrimination. They came to play in 
Romer v. Evans, where the Court over-
turned laws around the country that 
criminalized gay sex, or Obergefell v. 
Hodges, the case that established mar-
riage equality, or the case of Bostock 
v. Clayton County, decided this year, 
that banned employment discrimina-
tion against LGBTQ workers. So her 
arguments reverberate in continuous 
ways. 
Losing her is a very powerful and dif-
ficult moment because of her cham-
pionship of opportunity in this coun-
try. So on Sunday night, I went down 
to the Supreme Court. I had thought 
about it on Friday night when word 
passed of her dying. On Friday night, I 
thought: It is going to be a scene of 
confrontation, of people with bull 
horns yelling at each other and con-
fronting each other. That doesn’t fit 
how I want to honor her. And I thought 
on Sunday night: I need to go and be at 
the Supreme Court. I was so relieved to 
find that there was not a scene of con-
frontation; there was a scene of hun-
dreds of people coming to honor her 
championship of opportunity in our 
country, the role that she played for so 
many so often as an advocate and as a 
Justice. 
This is a piece of what it looked like, 
although you have to kind of multiply 
the flowers and everything you see 
over a huge expanse. This is just a 
small portion of it. 
I was very struck by watching people 
kneel down to write with chalk— 
women, men, boys, and girls—to say 
what she meant to them, what she 
meant to this country, and what she 
meant to striking open the doors of op-
portunity. 
Then I started reading some of the 
things that were being written. This is 
one of them. This says: ‘‘We can be-
cause she did. Thank you, RBG.’’ 
In another written sign, there was a 
quote: 
‘‘I ask no favors for my sex. . . . All I ask 
of my brethren is that they will take their 
feet off our necks.’’ Give us opportunity. 
This is actually Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
quoting Sarah Grimke of South Caro-
lina, born in 1792. Sarah became the 
country’s first female abolitionist and 
early pioneer of the women’s move-
ment. When Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
quoted her in the ‘‘Notorious RBG’’ 
documentary, it made this quote fa-
mous for a generation. 
I was struck by this sign, which I 
thought basically summed up her en-
tire efforts on women’s rights. It is a 
quote of hers that says: ‘‘Women be-
long in all places decisions are being 
made.’’ You can see at the end the mas-
sive number of flowers and signs people 
have left in front of the Supreme 
Court. 
Then I saw this, which summed up a 
young woman’s commentary on that 
principle: 
I grew up never knowing there was a glass 
ceiling because of you. Thank you, RBG. 
So we mourn her loss. She was a 
champion for opportunity for all. She 
was a champion for so much that goes 
to making this world a better place for 
ordinary 
people—ordinary 
people— 
which brings us to the challenge we 
have before the Court because realize 
that the Supreme Court has become a 
very 
powerful, 
nine-member, 
ap-
pointed-for-life superlegislature. 
It is not calling balls and strikes any 
longer—no. It is a setting for a pitch 
battle between the original vision of 
our country—‘‘we the people’’ govern-
ment or, as Lincoln said, government 
of, by, and for the people—and a dif-
ferent vision for our country; a Fed-
eralist Society vision for our country; 
a vision of, we the powerful minority 
want to control the government for our 
own benefit. That is the battle that is 
being waged on the Court. Is it govern-
ment by and for the people or govern-
ment by and for the powerful? 
This has been a battle that has been 
waged since our 1787 Constitution. In 
1781, we had our first Constitution, the 
Articles of Confederation, and the mi-
nority view of the White, wealthy, pow-
erful South was protected by a require-
ment for a supermajority in that first 
Constitution, the Articles of Confed-
eration. 
The Founders said: This isn’t govern-
ment by and for the people. This is not 
government by and for the people—no. 
The majority will is the power of gov-
ernment by and for the people. 
So that was embodied in the Con-
stitution we have now, that vision of 
‘‘we the people.’’ 
That minority from the South, want-
ing to protect slavery, said: We need 
strategies to prevent the majority from 
eliminating slavery, and we have to 
make sure that there are no civil 
rights granted to individuals of color in 
our Nation who might undermine our 
complete control of the governments at 
the State level. 
That minority said: We are very 
wealthy, and we don’t want any laws 
that undermine our wealth, so we need 
a strategy to control and prevent the 
people from getting fair wages and fair 
working conditions because that means 
we make less money ourselves. 
So they pursued a strategy called 
nullification, a strategy that said no 
Federal law will have any impact on 
our State unless we endorse it at the 
State level. 
Eventually that fell before the Court, 
so then they pursued the development 
of the supermajority blockade of deci-
sions being made in this very Chamber, 
on behalf of racism. The supermajority 
was forged in the fires of racism. For 87 
years, no law was blocked by this 
Chamber, by the supermajority, except 
civil rights. 
Then this battle expanded. It ex-
panded to issues of corporate power 
versus 
consumer 
rights, 
corporate 
power versus working conditions. This 
is where we come to the current battle 
between the Federalist Society weigh-
ing in on behalf of government by and 
for the powerful versus those who be-
lieve in the vision of our Constitution 
of government by and for the people. 
So we have lost Ruth Bader Gins-
burg, who honored our constitutional 
vision, and we have a President and a 
majority in this Chamber who are in-
tent in packing the Court on behalf of 
the wealthy and powerful. 
There is at this moment just tremen-
dous damage being done to the integ-
rity of this body because the same 
party in the majority 4 years ago said: 
We have a principle—the McConnell 
rule—that if a seat becomes vacant 
during an election year, we must listen 
to the people and let them decide 
whether the current President or a dif-
ferent President decides. Will it be the 
Republican nominee or the Democratic 
nominee? 
They took that vote, and they went 
with it. Many spoke out in favor of it, 
of the principle. Many said: This is the 
absolute 
right 
thing 
to 
do—even 
though it was the first time in U.S. his-
tory that this body did not debate the 
nomination or vote on the nomination, 
breaking the protocol of our entire his-
tory in order to steal a Supreme Court 
seat from President Obama and pass it 
on to the next President. 
So here we are, 4 years later, much 
deeper into an election year. In fact, 
the election has already started, with 
many absentee ballots having been de-
livered, having been voted, having been 
returned. So any form of integrity 
would be to honor the McConnell rule 
from 4 years ago and say: What we did 
4 years ago was principled. We said we 
believed in it. It helped out the Repub-
licans enormously, but, you know 
what, we are principled individuals, 
and so we are going to stick with the 
same frame that we argued before the 
public 4 years earlier. 
So I ask my colleagues, are there not 
a whole number of you who will come 
together—together—and say: Yes, we 
have integrity with the decision we 
made 4 years ago, the McConnell rule 
we argued 4 years ago, the rule that 
gave a Supreme Court seat to Presi-
dent Trump and took it away from 
President Obama, for the first time 
stealing a Supreme Court seat in our 
history? But we are going to honor 
that same principle today. 
I ask my colleagues, search your 
hearts. I ask, do you want to be re-
membered in this role of so fiercely ad-
vocating a principle that benefited you

then and so fiercely violating it now, 
to your own benefit once again, doing 
so much damage to the integrity of 
this Chamber and so much damage to 
the vision and principle of government 
of, by, and for the people? 
Let that not be the case. Let every 
Member come here to the floor and to-
gether actually hold a debate. 
We see no Members on the floor 
today—Republican 
colleagues. 
Hav-
ing—many of them—stated that they 
are quite ready to violate the principle 
they argued so strongly 4 years ago, we 
don’t know where they went. They are 
gone. They are not here. 
So let the American people call at-
tention because the American people 
love our Constitution. The American 
people love ‘‘we the people.’’ The Amer-
ican people love the principle of gov-
ernment of, by, and for the people and 
do not want to see it trampled in an ef-
fort to sustain a massive amount of 
corporate power against the consumer, 
wealthy power against the worker, and 
racist power against civil rights. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, in the 
summer of 1920, America ratified the 
19th Amendment. This breakthrough in 
our history, born of decades of setback 
and struggle by many unremembered 
women who never lived to actually cast 
a vote for what to us now is a self-evi-
dent proposition that women in this 
country should have the right to vote, 
moved this country one step closer to 
equality. That is why I think it is so 
fitting that, a century later, we pay 
our respects to the late Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, who, more than any-
one, advanced the cause of equality be-
tween men and women over her re-
markable career. 
Justice Ginsburg’s commitment to 
equality was not the result of lofty 
idealism but the hard experience of her 
life. 
Thirteen years after ratification of 
the 19th Amendment, Joan Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg was born to a working-class 
family in Brooklyn. It was the middle 
of the Great Depression, and her father 
sold furs at a time when no one would 
buy them. Tragically, her mother died 
of cancer before Ruth graduated from 
school. 
But these challenges, like others she 
would face, did not defeat her. They 
didn’t prevent her from graduating 
first in her class at Cornell. They 
didn’t exclude her from Harvard Law 
School, where she was one of only 9 
women in a class of 550 and had to jus-
tify to the dean why she had taken the 
place of a man. She finished her law de-
gree at Columbia, where she once again 
was first in her class, and not a single 
law firm would hire her. She applied to 
clerk for Justice Felix Frankfurter on 
the Supreme Court, who said that, al-
though she was an impressive can-
didate, he wasn’t ready to hire a 
woman. 
She understood these early firsthand 
experiences with discrimination not 
merely as barriers to her obvious tal-
ents and potential but as a vicious 
threat to our country’s full potential. 
She knew that any country that would 
deny a single person’s chance to make 
a contribution on account of their race 
or their gender or their religion or 
whom they loved will never fully flour-
ish. Tearing down these barriers be-
came the cause of her career. 
She rose to become a full professor at 
Rutgers Law School and founded Amer-
ica’s first law journal on gender issues. 
Later, she returned to Columbia Law 
School, where she became the first 
woman to hold a full professorship. She 
worked pro bono for the ACLU, co-
founding 
their 
Women’s 
Rights 
Project. She quickly became one of the 
most accomplished litigators in the 
country, writing a brief the Supreme 
Court cited in Reed v. Reed to rule for 
the first time that discrimination on 
the basis of sex violated the 14th 
Amendment. Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s ar-
gument led the Court to overcome cen-
turies of narrow views about the proper 
role of women in American life. As a 
result, the Court’s holding redefined 
American law. 
Ruth’s accomplishments led to an ap-
pointment to the prestigious U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, 
and in 1993 President Clinton named 
her to the Supreme Court. Her nomina-
tion sailed through this body with 96 
votes—a reminder of a time not so very 
long ago when the Senate actually un-
derstood its constitutional responsi-
bility to advise and consent and what 
that actually meant. 
For more than a quarter-century on 
the Court, Justice Ginsburg authored 
rulings that promoted fairness, ad-
vanced equality, and secured hard-won 
rights. They upheld affirmative action 
and protected a woman’s right to 
choose. 
Her dissent in one gender discrimina-
tion case was so powerful, it inspired 
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the 
very first legislation President Obama 
signed. 
At the same time, she could never ac-
cept decisions that nullified the right 
to vote or otherwise limited our demo-
cratic values, even when it was hard 
for some of her colleagues to perceive 
the systemic racism in our country. 
When they were gutting critical pro-
tections to the Voting Rights Act, she 
had the common sense to tell them, 
you are ‘‘throwing away your umbrella 
in a rainstorm because you are not get-
ting wet.’’ 
As always, she cut legal convention 
and saw with clear eyes the enduring 
threat discrimination poses to our elec-
tions. She knew voters still deserved 
the protection of the law, and all these 
years later, after State after State 
after 
State 
has 
passed 
laws 
dis-
possessing people of important rights 
with respect to the right to vote, she 
has been proved right. 
As we reflect on her legacy in a real 
sense, I would say Justice Ginsburg 
herself should be thought of as a found-
er of our country, not because she had 
an important title or wore a black 
robe—although, she wore it as well as 
anyone in the countless images of her 
reproduced on T-shirts and tote bags 
and onesies, as the ‘‘Notorious RBG’’— 
but because she knew where we had 
fallen short and dedicated her life to 
calling America closer to our best tra-
ditions of equality, liberty, and oppor-
tunity for all, because the young Joan 
Ruth Bader knew America would be 
worse off without her. 
Justice Ginsburg made America more 
democratic, more fair, and more free. 
Mr. President, before I turn it over to 
my 
hard-working 
colleague 
from 
Michigan who is here later than he 
should be only because that is the kind 
of person he is, working so tremen-
dously hard on behalf of the people of 
Michigan and the people of this coun-
try—let me just say one word about 
where we find ourselves in the Senate. 
I am just going to take 2 minutes to do 
this. 
I believe that American history can 
be best understood, from the very 
founding of our country until now, as 
an epic battle between the highest 
ideals that humanity has ever ex-
pressed in our founding documents and 
the worst instincts of human beings. 
That is the founding that took the 
form of the institution of slavery. You 
can draw a straight line from those 
days to these days. There is no doubt in 
my mind which side of that line Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg was on. 
There is no guarantee that this coun-
try is going to become more demo-
cratic, more fair, and more free. That 
took the work of suffragettes; it took 
the work of enslaved people like Fred-
erick Douglass—another founder of 
this country who, in his lifetime, 
changed the entire approach of the abo-
litionist movement to argue that the 
Constitution was not a pro-slavery doc-
ument, as they were arguing at the 
time, but that it was an anti-slavery 
document and that we weren’t living 
up to the ideals of that Constitution. 
That is another self-evident fact today, 
to us, but it wasn’t at the time that 
Frederick Douglass made those argu-
ments. 
There is no doubt in my mind that if 
we find ourselves with a 6-to-3 Court, 
and we have replaced Ruth Bader Gins-
burg not with somebody who has an ap-
preciation for the direction this coun-
try needs to go, which is to enable all 
of us to participate fairly and justly 
and equally in the society, but one 
where the most powerful and the most 
well connected are able to get the 
courts to pay attention to them, while 
working people all over this country 
can’t have the basic health insurance 
that everyone else in the industrialized 
world has come to expect, we are going 
to be a poorer country for it. 
My final point is—before I turn it 
over to the Senator from Michigan— 
the fact that we got here with a major-
ity leader who has completely under-
mined any sense of integrity in this

September 22, 2020 
body with respect to the rules—not 
speaking personally about him—is a 
real problem. It is hard for me to see 
how this place will ever make enduring 
change that we need to make if the 
American people have completely lost 
faith in it. 
In MITCH MCCONNELL’s Senate, words 
have lost their meaning. The rules are 
what you can get away with politi-
cally. That is the outer boundary of 
where you can go. It is moments like 
this that I remind them this is not the 
first Republic that has failed. When 
words lose their meaning, when prom-
ises mean nothing, when commitments 
mean nothing, that is when institu-
tions fail. 
I, for one, hope that we will put this 
era behind us and not return to some 
old era—I am not interested in that— 
but build a Senate that is actually wor-
thy of the 21st century, worthy of the 
example Ruth Bader Ginsburg set, wor-
thy of the expectations our kids and 
grandchildren have of us and that we 
have of them and of America’s place in 
the world. 
We are not going to do it this way. 
We can’t do it this way. We have a 
chance to make a change, and I hope 
that we will. 
I yield the floor. 
I say to my friend from Michigan, 
thank you for your patience and indul-
gence. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, like 
countless Americans, I am grieving the 
loss of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
As the second woman to serve on the 
Supreme Court, and the first Jewish 
woman to do so, she was a pioneer, a 
brilliant jurist, and a historical giant 
who blazed the trail for many. 
When I reflect on her life’s work, I 
think of her tireless efforts for women; 
I think of her tireless efforts to end 
discrimination of any kind; and I think 
of her tireless work to give a voice to 
all of those who do not have a voice. 
She was fiercely committed to ensur-
ing that justice, fairness, and equality 
would reign across our country. She 
was loyal not only to the Constitution 
but to the people whose lives she knew 
would be affected by her rulings. 
Within hours of the announcement of 
her death—as Americans across the 
country mourned her loss and paid 
homage to her legacy—some, unfortu-
nately, turned their attention imme-
diately to filling a vacancy and also 
started to scheme on how to ram 
through a nominee before election 
day—only a little over 40 days from 
now. 
It is important to remember that our 
constitutional democracy is built upon 
a system of checks and balances, with 
three coequal branches of government. 
The Supreme Court plays an important 
role in determining and deciding im-
portant questions of law, and it rep-
resents a core pillar of our democracy. 
Its rulings profoundly shape the rights 
and the lives of Michiganders and all 
Americans. 
For example, later this fall, the 
Court will be taking up a case pushed 
by the Trump administration to com-
pletely eliminate the Affordable Care 
Act. The Court’s ultimate decision will 
effectively 
determine 
the 
fate 
of 
healthcare for millions of Michiganders 
and Americans. 
If the Supreme Court strikes down 
protections in the Affordable Care Act, 
people with preexisting conditions will 
be at risk of losing protections pro-
vided under the law. Insurance compa-
nies will again be able to go back to 
the days of discriminating against peo-
ple 
with 
preexisting 
conditions—or 
even dropping a person’s health cov-
erage entirely—at a time when people 
need healthcare the most. Sadly, being 
a woman could also again become a 
preexisting health condition, leading 
to higher costs and limited options. 
Insurance 
companies 
will, 
once 
again, be able to impose annual or life-
time limits for coverage, raising costs 
and making healthcare unaffordable 
and 
inaccessible 
for 
many 
Michiganders. We also know that sen-
iors on Medicare could pay more for 
prescription drugs. 
And anyone who has arthritis, diabe-
tes, or cancer—or anyone who gets 
sick—will see their healthcare costs go 
up, and far too many people may be 
forced into financial ruin and bank-
ruptcy if they get sick. In all, 23 mil-
lion Americans could lose their current 
health insurance. 
In sum, I think it is unconscionable 
that President Trump, along with Sen-
ate Republicans, are attempting to un-
dermine critical healthcare in the 
midst of a once-in-a-century public 
health crisis. And it is not just 
healthcare that is on the line when fill-
ing this Supreme Court vacancy. 
Women may lose their right to their 
reproductive freedom if the seminal de-
cision of Roe v. Wade is overruled; the 
Court may further erode protections 
for workers and continue to undermine 
unions; and the Court may side with 
large corporate special interests rather 
than ensure a level playing field for 
workers. 
The appointment of a Supreme Court 
nominee puts an awful lot on the line. 
Voting rights and the core principle of 
one person, one vote are on the line. 
Upholding basic critical civil rights are 
on the line. Equality for millions of 
LGBTQ 
Americans 
who 
seek 
non-
discrimination protections is on the 
line, and at stake is whether the Court 
will protect our air and our water. 
Simply put, the Supreme Court has 
the final word on how we address the 
major challenges of our time. In a pow-
erful sense, it is the last line of defense 
for everyday Americans. 
With so much on the line, we should 
not rush a Supreme Court nominee 
through what should be a deliberative 
process. Jamming the Supreme Court 
nomination through now will, without 
question, further divide our country 
and disregards the fact that the Amer-
ican people are now voting or soon will 
be in many States. In fact, later this 
week, voters in Michigan will begin 
casting their ballots. 
Issues before the Court are life- 
changing, and Americans should have a 
voice in selecting who will choose the 
next 
nominee—a 
nominee, 
if 
con-
firmed, who will serve for a lifetime. 
We can certainly wait for the Amer-
ican people to be heard. The selection 
of a Supreme Court nominee can cer-
tainly wait until after Inauguration 
Day. 
What cannot wait is to help millions 
of Michiganders and Americans suf-
fering as a result of the COVID crisis. 
There is no question that the Senate 
has an important duty to advise and 
consent on nominations, but this body 
must first effectively address the un-
precedented public health and eco-
nomic crisis now confronting this Na-
tion. 
To do so, we need to come together in 
a bipartisan manner. I know it is pos-
sible. We were able to come together 
and pass robust, bipartisan coronavirus 
relief legislation in March and in April, 
and I remain ready to work in a bipar-
tisan manner again to pass meaningful 
legislation again. 
More than 200,000 Americans have 
lost their lives from this pandemic, in-
cluding approximately 7,000 in Michi-
gan. The numbers are staggering. Be-
hind these devastating statistics are 
people—mothers, 
fathers, 
sisters, 
brothers, husbands, wives, and chil-
dren. Tragically, some are projecting 
that we could see a total of 400,000 
Americans die by January. 
There are steps that Congress must 
take right now to stem the tide of this 
pandemic. Not acting now in a bipar-
tisan way to save more lives is an un-
conscionable betrayal of our duty to 
protect the American people. We must 
provide relief to families and workers 
who have lost their jobs through no 
fault of their own and worry every sin-
gle day about how to keep food on the 
table and a roof over their heads. 
We must support small businesses 
that need Federal funding to stay 
afloat and to rebuild our economy after 
we defeat this COVID virus. We must 
support parents and schools trying to 
ensure students can learn in a safe en-
vironment and keep up with their stud-
ies. 
We must step up for communities 
across Michigan and the United States 
that have been on the frontline of 
coronavirus response efforts. Our com-
munities are facing massive budget 
challenges that could force deep cuts to 
essential services or layoffs of teachers 
and first responders and law enforce-
ment officials. 
Now is the time for us to rise to the 
challenge. Americans are losing their 
lives and their livelihoods to this cruel 
pandemic. I know we can turn the tide, 
but it will take political will. It is not 
too late to save hundreds of thousands 
of lives and countless jobs, but we must 
focus on effectively confronting the 
coronavirus together, and we must do 
it now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5765 
September 22, 2020 
Our focus should not be on rushing to 
fill a Court vacancy. That can, and 
should, wait until Michiganders and 
the American people have had an op-
portunity for their voices to be heard 
and a new Presidential term to begin. 
The COVID crisis is urgent, and it 
must be our priority first and fore-
most. 
Filling a Supreme Court vacancy can 
certainly wait, with voting already 
under way and election day only 42 
days away. Let’s come together in a bi-
partisan way and together do the right 
thing. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I want to 
thank my colleague from Michigan for 
outlining the stakes for the American 
people. 
I will start tonight with the two prin-
ciple reasons we gather tonight on the 
Senate floor. We gather on this floor 
tonight to reflect upon the life of Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, to pay tribute to her 
life of public service and to outline, as 
so many of our colleagues have out-
lined tonight, what is at stake for 
American families in a debate about 
the next Supreme Court Justice. 
Let me start with the life of Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. Nothing we could say 
tonight would do justice to her story, 
but her story is an American story. It 
is a story of hard work and struggle, a 
story of overcoming discrimination— 
discrimination that I and so many oth-
ers have never faced. It is also a story 
of knocking down barriers for women, 
a story of defending workers fiercely, a 
story of defending voting rights, and so 
much more that we will talk about in 
the next number of days. 
It is also a very human story, as 
much as it is an American story. It is 
a human story about her heroic bat-
tles—plural—many battles with cancer, 
at least two kinds of cancer, over the 
course of 20 years. This struggle, this 
heroic struggle, this battle helped to 
transform Ruth Bader Ginsburg—then 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg—into an 
American icon and an inspiration to 
millions of Americans. 
We mourn her passing, and we will, 
in the days ahead, continue to laud her 
extraordinary 
accomplishments, 
her 
achievements as a lawyer and a Fed-
eral appeals court judge and, of course, 
her 27 years as an Associate Justice on 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
At the same time as we pay tribute 
to her, we have, I believe, an obligation 
to make it clear what is at stake, what 
is on the line for tens of millions of 
Americans. I will focus on one subject 
area tonight, healthcare. We know that 
after failing to repeal the Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act numer-
ous times—and ‘‘numerous’’ is an un-
derstatement—after failing that many 
times, Senate Republicans, along with 
the President, will try now to ram 
through a Supreme Court nomination 
that could, and very likely will, be the 
deciding vote to destroy the Affordable 
Care Act and all of its protections. 
I will not dwell tonight on the bla-
tant hypocrisy of this action. I will 
talk mostly about healthcare. But the 
hypocrisy, I think, is well known all 
these days, since Justice Ginsburg’s 
passing, by so many Republicans who 
said just 4 years ago that it was the 
wrong thing to do, even within 10 
months in a Presidential election year, 
to confirm a new Justice. But here we 
are, and that same party, those same 
Senators, on tape over and over saying 
that they would not do this, are here 
trying to ram through another nomina-
tion. 
By the way, when you consider the 
last number of months—the months of 
May, June, July, and August—this 
body, the U.S. Senate, did little else 
but nomination after nomination and a 
defense bill and little else. There was 
no action, no substantial action on a 
COVID–19 relief bill despite the chal-
lenges our Nation faces. I guess nomi-
nations is all we are supposed to do in 
the Senate. 
Here we go again on the most con-
sequential nomination that a Senate 
could consider. We know that the U.S. 
Supreme Court has a case before it 
that will be argued in early November 
that could be the end of the Affordable 
Care Act. In May, President Trump 
laid out in no uncertain terms what he 
wants to do to this healthcare law: 
‘‘We want to terminate healthcare 
under 
ObamaCare.’’ 
Terminate 
healthcare is his goal—in the middle of 
the worst public legal crisis in 100 
years, a worldwide pandemic that we 
are still suffering the effects of. We 
just crossed the 200,000 death total just 
hours ago or a few days ago at the 
most, 8,000 of those in Pennsylvania. At 
a time when so many families have 
been devastated either by the virus and 
the suffering that comes with con-
tracting the virus or a death in the 
family—family 
members, 
deaths 
of 
friends and people who folks have 
worked with—in the midst of an eco-
nomic crisis, a jobs crisis, in the midst 
of all that, we are supposed to go along 
with a process to ram through a new 
Supreme Court Justice and take no 
substantial action on a COVID relief 
bill. 
So much is at stake in the Affordable 
Care Act. I will try to go through a 
long list as fast as I can. We know that 
more than 20 million could lose cov-
erage who gained coverage as a result 
of that act. We know that 135 million 
would lose their protections for a pre-
existing condition. In Pennsylvania, 
those numbers translate into 1.1 and 
5.5—1.1 million people gained coverage, 
although that number is down now be-
cause of Republican efforts over the 
last couple of years here in Wash-
ington. But 1.1 million gained cov-
erage, and there are 5.5 million in the 
State with a preexisting condition. 
If you go down the list of counties, 
which I will not do all 67 tonight, but 
I just want to give you some sense of 
what it means by county. In terms of 
Pennsylvanians who gained coverage, 
you would expect that the big cities 
had a lot of coverage gains. That is 
true. At last count, Philadelphia had 
225,000 people who gained coverage. But 
if you go from Philly to Fulton—Ful-
ton County happens to be a small coun-
ty of 14,000 people on the Pennsylvania- 
Maryland border. They have more than 
1,000 people at last count, 1,028 people 
who got healthcare through the Afford-
able Care Act. From Pike County to 
Greene County, thousands of people 
gained healthcare. From Chester Coun-
ty to Crawford County—Chester is in 
the southeast, and Crawford is way up 
in the northwest, just south of Erie— 
29,000 people or almost 30,000 in Chester 
and in Crawford County, more than 
6,200. In my home county of Lacka-
wanna, 
almost 
20,000 
people 
got 
healthcare. In Luzerne County next 
door, almost 30,000. Just in those two 
counties, 
almost 
50,000 
people 
got 
healthcare. All of that is at risk in 
Pennsylvania and in countless numbers 
of counties all across our country. 
Medicaid expansion, which has en-
abled people to gain access to treat-
ment for an opioid addiction or other 
substance use disorder issues, would be 
destroyed. Medicaid expansion would 
be gone. Medicaid expansion also en-
sured women can receive a full year of 
postpartum care and provided coverage 
for older Americans who are not yet el-
igible for Medicare. Prescription drug 
costs would skyrocket for 12 million 
seniors and people with disabilities. 
That is because the ACA closed Medic-
aid’s dreaded prescription drug donut 
hole. The ACA closed the donut hole. 
As I indicated earlier, for 135 million 
Americans with preexisting conditions, 
their coverage is now in jeopardy if the 
Supreme 
Court 
decision 
went 
the 
wrong way. Insurers would be able to 
drop them. Insurers will be able to 
refuse to cover them or insurance com-
panies will be able to charge them 
more because of common diagnoses 
like depression, anxiety, asthma, dia-
betes, sleep apnea, and the list goes on 
from there—all the things the insur-
ance companies were able to do for at 
least a generation or more in the dark 
days before we had an Affordable Care 
Act. 
Insurers would also be able to charge 
you more because you are a woman, al-
lowed prior to the ACA, or they could 
charge you more because of your age. 
That also will come back. Insurers will 
be able to reinstate the annual lifetime 
caps on coverage that they provide. If 
your healthcare is too expensive, the 
insurance companies could just stop 
paying for it, even if you are a preemie, 
a tiny little baby in the NICU, or an 
adult with a terminal diagnosis. 
The essential health benefits would 
also go away. Insurers will be able to 
carve out benefits you need, like ma-
ternity care or mental healthcare. As a 
woman, you might not be able to find 
a plan to provide care during your 
pregnancy, unless you have insurance 
through your employer. For people 
with disabilities, the ACA is obviously 
essential.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5766 
September 22, 2020 
A Court that would destroy the ACA 
would allow for discrimination against 
the 61 million Americans with disabil-
ities—let me say that again—the 61 
million Americans with disabilities 
that have preexisting conditions. Prior 
to the ACA, it was routine that people 
with disabilities could not get health 
insurance. Prior to the ACA, if you had 
epilepsy, autism, or spina bifida, or any 
disability, you could be denied cov-
erage. You could be charged much 
higher costs. A Court that strikes down 
the ACA will be a Court that directly 
attacks 
the 
disability 
community. 
That is why so many members of that 
community came to Washington in 2017 
and fought valiantly to uphold the Af-
fordable Care Act. They knew that 
their life was on the line. It wasn’t just 
an issue for them. Their life was on the 
line. 
Prior to the ACA, there are stories I 
heard from Pennsylvanians every day— 
and I am sure so many other Senators 
did, as well—stories about people who, 
in addition to living with disabilities 
or facing a serious illness or other med-
ical needs, were worried about paying 
their bills. 
For so many families, this isn’t an 
issue that we are going to be debating 
in Washington—some far-off, abstract 
issue. This is real life for people. Moth-
ers and fathers will be worried that 
their children will not have the cov-
erage they need, that their family will 
not be covered—worries that, if they 
have not been eliminated, have been 
greatly mitigated by the coverage and 
the protections of the Patient Protec-
tion and Affordable Care Act. 
We have to ask ourselves a question 
as the Court considers this case just a 
few days after election day. We have to 
ask ourselves a number of questions, 
but certainly we should ask ourselves: 
Will the United States of America turn 
the clock back on insurance, turn the 
clock back on healthcare for so many 
millions of Americans? Will we allow 
the 
Federal 
Government, 
either 
through the Congress, which so far we 
have prevented, or through the Su-
preme Court or any Federal court—will 
we allow a Federal Government entity 
to rob people of the protections that 
they received through the Affordable 
Care Act, like protections for a pre-
existing condition? Will we allow all of 
this in the middle of a pandemic, the 
worst public health crisis in a century 
here in America and around the world? 
Will we allow any agency or any offi-
cial 
to 
turn 
back 
the 
clock 
on 
healthcare in the middle of a jobs cri-
sis? We have had double-digit unem-
ployment in Pennsylvania for months 
now. They are the highest unemploy-
ment rates we have seen since 1983, and 
for a period of time this summer, they 
had been the highest unemployment 
rates we had seen in more than 50 
years. We have a jobs crisis in the mid-
dle of a pandemic, which has caused a 
lot of people to already lose their 
healthcare. 
That is not who we are if we say we 
are American. America at its best is 
the country that is already trying to 
make progress, trying to expand pro-
tections. We have done that for genera-
tions. We made an advancement in 2010 
when we passed the Patient Protection 
and Affordable Care Act. We cannot 
allow this institution—the institution 
of Congress—or the Supreme Court to 
destroy that act and to undermine that 
American progress. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I have 
my 
favorite 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
quotation. One day, he was in the 
White House with his family and his 
staff. His staff said: You have to stay 
in the White House and win the war 
and free the slaves and save the Union, 
and Lincoln said: No. I have to go out 
and get my public opinion bath. 
I don’t think that too many people in 
this body are getting their public opin-
ion baths. They are not seeing the pain 
out there. They don’t seem to absorb 
that, one day in August, in my State, 
as an example, 600,000 people—just like 
that—lost their $600-a-week unemploy-
ment insurance. In Wisconsin and 
Rhode Island, for hundreds of thou-
sands of people—just like that—their 
$600-a-week unemployment insurance 
expired. They couldn’t find jobs. There 
is 
massive 
unemployment 
in 
our 
States. There are people who are hurt-
ing. What are they to do? If you are 
just getting by on that $600 a week and 
if the money doesn’t come and if you 
can’t find a job, what are you to do? 
How are you to feed your family? 
There is so much anger out there and 
frustration and futility. People are 
hurting. Yet President Trump and 
Leader MCCONNELL refuse to do their 
jobs. We have asked them for weeks 
and months to come back here and help 
us open the schools safely, to help local 
communities and local governments, to 
help unemployed workers, to help peo-
ple who are about to lose their apart-
ments—who are about to be evicted. 
Leader MCCONNELL
says he doesn’t 
have a sense of urgency, and President 
Trump just turns his back and makes 
another speech. 
Middle-class and low-income public 
schools can’t open because MCCONNELL 
and Trump refuse to do their jobs. Par-
ents and teachers are under an over-
whelming amount of stress. School dis-
tricts and families don’t have the re-
sources for the additional technology 
for the safety precautions they need, so 
schools either open unsafely or stu-
dents need to do distance learning. 
None of that works for people. State 
governments and local communities 
are looking at massive layoffs, and 
small businesses are closing in larger 
and 
larger 
numbers, 
but 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
and 
President 
Trump 
refuse to lift a finger. 
The stock market is back up, so they 
seem to think everything is fine. They 
are just oblivious to the families. They 
are oblivious to the families who are 
staring at stacks of bills, who don’t 
know what to do, and who have no good 
options. 
Yet now, after months of inaction, 
Leader MCCONNELL gets out of his of-
fice from down the hall, walks down 
here, makes a speech, and goes back to 
his office. He doesn’t actually do any-
thing except confirm young, rightwing 
judges. He doesn’t do anything to help 
people who have lost their unemploy-
ment. He walks down here, through 
these doors, and doesn’t do anything to 
help schools open safely. He doesn’t do 
anything to prevent layoffs in State 
and local governments. He doesn’t do 
anything to help these small businesses 
which are closing, and some now have 
made the decision to close perma-
nently, but Leader MCCONNELL is will-
ing to drop everything and move Heav-
en and Earth to put another corporate 
shill on the Supreme Court. 
Leader MCCONNELL has spent the last 
6 months ignoring the pandemic, ignor-
ing the economic crisis. Now he wants 
to pack the Court—a Court that is sup-
posed to serve the American people— 
with another Justice who always rules 
for corporate special interests and al-
ways rules against workers. It will be 
another Justice who will take away, as 
Senator 
CASEY
said, 
Americans’ 
healthcare in the middle of a pan-
demic. 
In my State, 900,000 people have 
health insurance today because of the 
Affordable Care Act—600,000 people be-
cause Governor Kasich, a Republican, 
and I, a Democrat, helped to expand 
Medicaid in Ohio. There are 600,000 peo-
ple who have insurance because of that. 
Yet we know this Court will be hearing 
a case to overturn the entire Afford-
able Care Act in just a few weeks. That 
insurance could be gone like that. 
Leader MCCONNELL
and President 
Trump 
and 
their 
special 
interest 
friends are trying to do what the Amer-
ican people rejected over and over. 
They want to take away preexisting 
condition protections in Pennsylvania, 
where Senator CASEY said 5.5 million 
people have preexisting conditions. In 
Ohio, 5 million people—essentially half 
the adult population—have preexisting 
conditions, and that was before the 
pandemic. So we know, if this Court 
does what it is likely to do, especially 
if Leader MCCONNELL
and President 
Trump can pack the Supreme Court 
the way they want to with another spe-
cial interest, corporate judge, we know 
those people’s preexisting condition 
protections will be gone. 
American healthcare is at stake. The 
American people deserve to have their 
voices heard. As Senator PETERS said, 
people are already voting. As we speak, 
they are casting ballots. These ballots 
should count. We know what Senator 
MCCONNELL and their wealthy friends 
want to do. They want to award more 
power to themselves, and they want to 
take it away from voters. 
We simply can’t stand by and watch 
a bunch of millionaires with good 
healthcare for all—all paid for by tax-
payers—who still have comfortable

jobs and paychecks, while millions are 
out of work, and watch them try to 
take away people’s healthcare and take 
away their voices in their own govern-
ment. 
Think about what is at stake. If 
President Trump gets his way and the 
Republican majority obediently obeys 
Senator MCCONNELL, as they always 
do, and Senator MCCONNELL, down the 
hall, 
obediently 
obeys 
President 
Trump—meaning, if MCCONNELL
and 
then almost all of the, shall we say, 
spineless Members of this Senate put in 
place a Justice who will take away the 
entire healthcare law and take away 
the tax credits to help people afford 
health insurance—then protections for 
preexisting conditions will be gone. 
Ohio’s entire Medicaid expansion for 
600,000 people—gone. The ability to 
stay on your parents’ insurance until 
you are 26—gone. More affordable pre-
scription drugs for seniors from closing 
the doughnut hole—gone. Limits on 
how much you pay out-of-pocket each 
year—gone. This will be in South Da-
kota, in Wisconsin, in Connecticut, in 
Rhode Island, in Ohio—all over. Free 
preventive services, like mammograms 
and bone density screenings, will be 
gone. The list goes on. 
That is why the Affordable Care Act 
wasn’t repealed—because the American 
public knew what it did for them, and 
they said to their elected officials: 
Don’t repeal it. Yet now we are going 
to have legislation from the bench. All 
of these conservatives on the Court 
love to talk about just being constitu-
tional, just being traditionalists and 
strict constructionists. No. They want 
to legislate from the Court. They want 
to undo what this body did and then re-
fused to undo. 
That is what is at stake. Five million 
Ohioans who are under the age of 65 
have preexisting conditions—as I said, 
half the population of our State before 
the coronavirus. 
It is not just healthcare. It is the 
ability to vote. It is workers’ protec-
tions on the job. We know at a packing 
plant in the Presiding Officer’s State— 
at Smithfield, a plant and a multibil-
lion-dollar company that is owned by 
the China Communist Party—it had 
1,290-some workers who were diagnosed 
with the coronavirus. It was the first 
time the administration ever did any-
thing to any company whose workers 
had gotten sick with the coronavirus. 
They 
fined 
this 
multibillion-dollar 
China 
Communist 
Party 
company, 
Smithfield, in the United States, and 
South Dakota fined it $13,000. That is 
$10 for every sick person, for every sick 
worker. Those are the kinds of people 
you will see on the Supreme Court. 
They will be protecting those compa-
nies. 
The freedom to organize a union is at 
stake. The progress we have made on 
equality, 
on 
civil 
rights, 
and 
on 
LGBTQ equality is at stake. Whether 
we can bring racial justice to our jus-
tice system is at stake. America’s pri-
vacy rights in the digital age are at 
stake. Women’s freedom to make their 
own healthcare decisions is at stake. 
Earlier today, one of my colleagues 
came to the floor not to try to get the 
$600 in unemployment for people who 
were laid off, not to try to pass more 
help for our schools so they could open 
safely, not to get more money for test-
ing; my colleague tried to pass yet an-
other restriction on a woman’s ability 
to get safe, effective healthcare. 
It is pretty clear where their prior-
ities lie, and we know what we need to 
do. All Americans need to speak out 
and share their stories. Make the peo-
ple who are supposed to serve under-
stand what is at stake for you and your 
family—what is at stake by Senator 
MCCONNELL’s and President Trump’s 
inaction. There will be no help for un-
employed workers, no help to open 
schools safely, no help for local com-
munities, no help for the Postal Serv-
ice, no help to run our elections safely 
and honestly. Tell people what is at 
stake. It is the public who saved the 
ACA in 2017, and the public can do it 
again. 
For us in the Senate, it comes back 
to one question: Whose side are you on? 
Are we going to put money into peo-
ple’s pockets? Are we going to help 
people pay their rent? Are we going to 
finally mobilize America’s vast manu-
facturing 
talent 
and 
ingenuity 
to 
produce the tests and the N95 masks 
and the other equipment we need and 
do what Senator BALDWIN advocates, 
which is to ‘‘buy American’’ with these 
products? Are we going to get support 
for our schools and our small busi-
nesses and our local communities or is 
the Senate going to follow the Trump- 
McConnell plan? That means to come 
out of your office, to walk down the 
hall, to open these doors, to go to your 
chair, to make a speech, and try to 
confirm another conservative lifetime 
judge. Yet don’t worry about unem-
ployment. There are only 600,000 people 
in my State and only millions around 
the country who don’t know what to do 
because they have lost their unemploy-
ment. Don’t do anything about opening 
schools safely. Don’t provide any dol-
lars for local school districts. Don’t 
help small businesses. 
Is that what we are going to do? Is 
the Senate going to follow that Trump- 
McConnell 
plan? 
They 
do 
nothing 
there, but then they think: Let’s do 
something. We will drop everything to 
grab more power for our wealthy 
friends. 
People are tired of feeling like no one 
is on their side. Let’s actually listen to 
the people whom we serve. Let’s make 
sure their votes count. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
stand in a distressing place of speaking 
after Senator BROWN, of Ohio, and be-
fore Senator BLUMENTHAL, of Con-
necticut, but I am delighted to be here 
tonight because the issues are so im-
portant. 
We are in a place in the Senate that 
is, frankly, weird, and I don’t know if 
people around here have gotten used to 
this being weird, but it is weird. It is 
not normal. In the Senate, we have es-
sentially eliminated legislation. We 
don’t do that any longer. The House 
sends over legislation, and it piles up 
in stacks on MITCH MCCONNELL’s desk. 
We legislate, maybe, four or five things 
in an entire session of Congress. That 
is weird. We are a legislative body. We 
are supposed to legislate. Why the 
elimination of legislation? 
We have smashed through and de-
stroyed norm after norm, tradition 
after tradition, rule after rule. Why is 
that? Do people get some perverse glee 
in smashing norms and traditions? Do 
people get some perverse glee in not 
passing legislation when they are sent 
here to legislate? It doesn’t make any 
sense. 
Then you look at those on the other 
side and their 180 reversal. When they 
wanted to stop a Supreme Court Jus-
tice, we heard about how important it 
was that, before an election, the Amer-
ican people got to weigh in through 
their votes and that you shouldn’t have 
a nominee appointed to the Court in 
the months before an election. Here we 
are, weeks before an election, and, sud-
denly—whoop—180. Why the hypocrisy? 
Did someone come and do one of those 
hypnosis parlor tricks on people so 
they would suddenly do the opposite 
thing from what they wanted to do? 
What is the explanation for the 
elimination of legislation? for the 
smashing of norms and traditions? for 
the reversal of the precedent on imme-
diate preelection confirmations? We 
are even seeing intense support for a 
Supreme Court nominee when we don’t 
even have a nominee. 
There is a phrase about a pig in a 
poke. You are not supposed to buy a 
pig in a poke. You are not supposed to 
buy a piglet in a bag when you haven’t 
had a look at the piglet to see what is 
in there. 
We haven’t seen the look at what-
ever—to use the analogy the piglet in 
the bag would be. Yet everybody is al-
ready lined up to support getting that 
person through quick, quick, quick. 
That is not normal. That is weird. Peo-
ple don’t ordinarily express their sup-
port for nonexistent nominees. 
So what explains all this weirdness? 
What I think explains all this weird-
ness is that a very, very powerful group 
of very, very big special interests has 
glommed 
itself 
together 
and 
over 
years, over decades, has built up an ap-
paratus specifically to control the 
Court—specifically. 
If you look at the Washington Post 
report on Leonard Leo and his Fed-
eralist Society perch and the bizarre 
little web of front groups that he has 
woven around that perch, you will see 
that they have documented more than 
$200 
million 
flowing 
through 
that 
setup—more than $200 million. 
So here is how it works right now: 
When you have a Republican President,

September 22, 2020 
the President doesn’t pick the nomi-
nee; a special interest group picks the 
nominee—the 
Federalist 
Society. 
Trump said so. That is where he got his 
list. His lawyer Don McGahn said so. 
He said he was in-sourced from the 
Federalist Society. 
Over and over again, people involved 
in the process say: We take our judicial 
selection picks from the Federalist So-
ciety. And when they say that, what do 
they mean? The Federalist Society is 
just a corporate screen. It is an entity. 
It does things on college campuses that 
have think tanks here. But what does 
it really mean? It means that the peo-
ple who are putting tens of millions, 
hundreds of millions of dollars anony-
mously into that organization are get-
ting a voice or a veto in the makeup of 
the Supreme Court. They are not even 
having to show who they are, and the 
Federalist Society does the screening 
for them. 
You don’t put tens of millions of dol-
lars into a group and not expect a re-
sult. If you give tens of millions of dol-
lars to a university, not only do you 
expect your idiot kid to get into the 
university, but you also expect them to 
name a building after you. So if you 
are going to put that kind of money 
into the Federalist Society, you are 
going to want something for it. To say 
that is not rational makes no sense at 
all. It is inconsistent with human be-
havior. 
I will tell you that if you took the 
names off the players and asked people 
in this room ‘‘Should anonymous spe-
cial interests with tens of millions of 
dollars to spend be able to have a voice 
or a veto in who gets elected to be a 
Federal judge or a U.S. Supreme Court 
Justice, screened through a partisan, 
private 
organization?’’ 
anybody 
in 
their right mind would say ‘‘No. That 
is unacceptable. That is preposterous. 
Of course you wouldn’t want that.’’ 
If this were a liberal organization, 
my Republican colleagues would be 
running around here with their hair on 
fire about the scandal of secret donors 
deciding who is going to be on the Su-
preme Court and masking themselves 
behind a front group. 
It is not just Federalist Society 
money. It is not just the $100, $200 mil-
lion that flow through that network. 
Look at the Judicial Crisis Network, 
which runs the ads for these nominees 
once the Federalist Society has se-
lected them. It gets contributions to 
pay for the ads. Do you know who pays 
for it? One person gave a $17-plus mil-
lion contribution in the Garland v. 
Gorsuch row, and somebody gave an-
other $17 million to get the beleaguered 
Kavanaugh through, and somebody else 
just gave $15 million. 
Now, I say ‘‘somebody else,’’ but do 
we know it was somebody else, or is 
there a perfectly logical case to be 
made that the same person gave $17 
million and $17 million and $15 million? 
That is $50 million. You don’t think 
that in their secret back room, wher-
ever they arrange that, they cut a deal 
that they would have a veto or a voice 
in who got on the Supreme Court? That 
is a ridiculous proposition. 
It doesn’t end there. Once the Fed-
eralist Society has selected the nomi-
nee and once the Judicial Crisis Net-
work has done its thing to support 
them with millions of dollars in TV ads 
and then they get confirmed, then 
comes the Pacific Legal Foundation or 
the Washington Legal Foundation or 
the Mountain States Legal Foundation 
or one of innumerable, phony-baloney 
legal foundations, all of which, guess 
what, are also supported by dark 
money—the anonymous money behind 
the Federalist Society, the anonymous 
money behind the Judicial Crisis Net-
work, and then the anonymous money 
behind these groups, which then bring 
carefully strategized cases before the 
judges who have been selected and 
campaigned for by dark money. 
Then the dark money groups bring 
the case in. So far, the five Republicans 
on the Court have been very good 
about lowering the standing require-
ments so that those cases get right in 
and they can hear them. Then the case 
is before them, and what do you see? 
You see a dozen phony front groups 
with anonymous funding all show up as 
friends of the court—amici curiae they 
call it in court-speak. 
I did a brief recently on the Con-
sumer 
Financial 
Protection 
Board 
case, and we showed the common fund-
ing of the other amici who showed up— 
a dozen of them, all funded by the same 
organizations. They are not separate. 
A group called the Center for Media 
Democracy took a look at our brief and 
took a look at that graph and said: You 
know, I bet you we can improve on that 
with a little bit of research. They put 
their scholars and their investigators 
and their researchers on it, and they 
did way better. They showed much 
deeper connections between the funders 
and the phony-baloney amicus groups. 
What if—what if it is the same small 
group of funders who are running 
money through the Federalist Society 
to select the judges, running money 
through the Judicial Crisis Network to 
campaign for them, running money 
through these legal foundations to tee 
up the right cases to bring before the 
judges, and then running anonymous 
money into the amici—what if it is the 
same big beast? It is less complicated 
than many corporate structures. They 
are perfectly capable of doing it. With 
that kind of money behind it, you can 
bet they will line people up in this 
building, and that explains the bizarre 
behavior. 
We are not seeing bizarre behavior 
because we have bizarre colleagues; we 
are seeing bizarre behavior because we 
have a bizarre force being applied in 
this whole judicial selection process. It 
is an apparatus, and the reason they 
want to do this is because if they con-
trol courts, they can make courts do 
things Congress would never do. Even 
Republicans in Congress would never 
do the things that these special inter-
ests can get courts to do. 
Do you think you could get a bill 
through the House and Senate—even 
controlled by Republicans—that al-
lowed unlimited corporate special in-
terest spending in elections? Of course 
you couldn’t. It would be a ridiculous 
proposition. People would get laughed 
at when they went home. There would 
be town meetings. People would throw 
tomatoes at them. But you put five of 
the right Justices on the Supreme 
Court, and they will make it the law of 
the land for you. Unlimited special in-
terest funding. Sure, we are for that. 
What a great idea. 
Getting rid of voting rights. Dis-
abling the Voting Rights Act. We voted 
in enormous bipartisan numbers to re-
authorize the Voting Rights Act. It 
took five unelected, lifetime-tenured 
Supreme Court Republican Justices to 
say: No, no, no. We know better. Rac-
ism is over. We know that racism is 
over because we are such brilliant peo-
ple up in our little preserve in the Su-
preme Court. 
They found that racism was over. We 
didn’t have to worry about it anymore. 
Pre-clearance didn’t have to happen. It 
could never have passed. But get five 
on the Court, and they did it. 
And then, of course, terminating the 
Affordable Care Act. We know that 
can’t be done by Republican-controlled 
bodies because this Republican-con-
trolled body failed to do it. So where do 
you go? Oh, right—to the Court, where 
we can get a 5-to-4 decision that does 
things that legislators wouldn’t do— 
wouldn’t hold their nose and do. And 
sure enough, what is up? November 10, 
the argument on the case against the 
Affordable Care Act. 
This isn’t just a theory; this is real 
people. I have 34,000 Rhode Islanders 
who 
have 
insurance 
through 
HealthSource RI, the market that got 
set up pursuant to the Affordable Care 
Act—34,000 who get their insurance 
there. I have 72,000 Rhode Islanders 
who get their insurance because we 
took the Medicaid expansion. They 
wouldn’t have insurance except for the 
Medicaid expansion. I can fight in 
every way I can to try to protect their 
rights here in this building, but you go 
over to the Supreme Court, and five 
and now maybe six Republican Justices 
can decide: We know better. We are 
going to undo the Affordable Care Act 
and take away all their protections. 
This is going to hurt. We have all 
those Rhode Islanders. We have two of 
the best ACOs in the country in Rhode 
Island—accountable 
care 
organiza-
tions—set up under the Affordable Care 
Act. It is a whole new way to deliver 
primary care. They are lowering costs. 
They are improving care. They are 
driving down their numbers. Their pa-
tients are happier than ever. They are 
changing the way they are doing care. 
They 
are 
making 
their 
patients 
healthier at less cost, with more atten-
tion. It is a great experiment, and it is 
going to be undone by this—not be-
cause anybody voted for it but because

we crammed—with this powerful spe-
cial interest apparatus behind us—peo-
ple on the Court who will obediently do 
these things when you trot a dozen 
phony-baloney amicus curiae in front 
of the Court to, all in chorus, tell them 
what they are supposed to do. 
Nationally, we are a nation of, what, 
330 million people? We are a nation of 
156 million preexisting conditions. Of 
course we are not going to throw out 
preexisting conditions. Even the Presi-
dent, while he is litigating to throw 
out preexisting conditions, says: I 
don’t want to throw out preexisting 
conditions. He knows he can’t get away 
with it. We know that it is stupid, 
wrong, and cruel, but pack the Court 
with people who are listening to these 
big special interest types? Poof. There 
goes preexisting conditions. 
There are 11.8 million people on 
Medicare who have saved $26.8 billion 
on prescriptions thanks to the savings 
in the Affordable Care Act. You would 
have to be nuts to take that away from 
seniors, but put the right people on 
that Court over there, tell them what 
to do through this big donor apparatus, 
and suddenly—boom. Poof. Gone. Be-
cause they are accountable to nobody 
once they are over there. It is a life-
time appointment. 
Bridget in Tiverton is a Rhode Is-
lander. She is in her twenties. She has 
a hip dysplasia that led to premature 
arthritis. She was in constant pain. In 
her twenties, she had to have a hip re-
placement. Well, thanks to the Afford-
able Care Act, because her dysplasia 
and arthritis were preexisting condi-
tions, she was able to get her hip re-
placed. She is now, for the first time in 
her life, fully employed and pain-free. 
She is happy. She is an ObamaCare 
care success story. Why would you 
want to undo that? Because you are a 
huge special interest and you want 
things your way. 
Martha from Cranston was unin-
sured. She had to have gallbladder sur-
gery. She ran up a $60,000 bill with no 
insurance and had to declare bank-
ruptcy. That is going to haunt her for 
a while because we don’t let her clean 
up after that even if it is a medical 
bankruptcy. But now she can get insur-
ance for $283 a month, which she can 
afford, rather than over $500 a month, 
which she could not afford. So she is 
now an insured person and doesn’t have 
to worry about that kind of unexpected 
bill and bankruptcy. 
These are real people. And what is 
happening with these special inter-
ests—I just don’t get it. I just don’t see 
how it is that people in this body can 
say that it is OK to have huge special 
interests that will spend $17 million at 
a lick, $50 million at a lick, $10 million 
at a lick secretly control who gets 
picked to be on the Supreme Court. In 
what world is that acceptable or even 
fair or an even decent way to do busi-
ness? It just isn’t. It is indefensible. 
Yet that is exactly what is happening. 
It is the same special interests that 
fund the Republican Party. It is the 
same special interests that are behind 
the big super PACs, and the big dark 
money PACs. That is why everybody 
has to hop around here because if we 
say no to them on their selected nomi-
nee, then they will say: Well, we are 
cutting you off then. You are all done. 
And when they spend tens of millions 
of dollars on politics, it is pretty hard 
to tell them: Well, we don’t care. We 
will stand up to you anyway. We are 
not going to take your money any 
longer. And that is the pickle we are in 
right here. That is the mess that we 
are in, and we have to fix it. It is wrong 
to be in this position. It is wrong to be 
using this space on the Court to send 
somebody over who is going to attack 
basic healthcare that we fought for and 
that Congress could not undo because 
the American people want it. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am delighted and honored to follow my 
great 
colleague 
from 
neighboring 
Rhode Island after that feisty, fighting 
speech, which also captures the spirit 
of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was deep-
ly concerned about the corrupting im-
pact of money on our political system. 
She was a longstanding critic of Citi-
zens United, the Supreme Court deci-
sion that opened the way to that dark 
money that has so corrupted our sys-
tem. 
She was a believer in closing the gaps 
and loopholes because she was smart 
enough and curious enough to learn 
what the real facts were, as opposed to 
her colleagues on the Supreme Court 
who relied on the stereotypes of the po-
litical system that were outdated even 
when Citizens United was adopted. We 
live in a democracy that is threatened 
by exactly that dark money in every 
sphere of the public square and public 
office, never more than in our judicial 
system because it is even less visible 
and more easily disguised. In part, the 
reason is that people pay less attention 
to it. Another reason may be that the 
amounts of money by comparison seem 
smaller. The amounts of hundreds of 
millions of dollars seems small com-
pared to the billions involved in legis-
lative or Executive races. But Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg knew that the power of 
the dollar, whether it is judicial selec-
tion or legislative campaigning, can be 
easily corrupted on a system that lacks 
limits. 
So I thank my colleague from Rhode 
Island for reminding us about part of 
the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 
which was to stand for principles and 
people—the constitutional principles 
that animated her whole life and gave 
breath to her matchless advocacy, the 
sense of righteousness that could cap-
ture attention in a courtroom. Even 
though it seemed to be surrounded by 
technical legal language, she made 
that language accessible to everyday 
Americans. 
And she chose her plaintiffs wisely. 
When she was arguing a case or mount-
ing against gender discrimination, she 
chose a male plaintiff who was denied 
Social Security simply because his 
wife, a woman, was the one in the mili-
tary. 
And she knew the power of hard 
work. Her work ethic was second to 
none, but her commitment to her fam-
ily and most especially to her husband 
Marty—also a brilliant lawyer, a won-
derful, warm human being—was leg-
endary. 
I was really privileged and honored 
to know Justice Ginsburg casually, in-
formally. I knew her warmth, her com-
passion and caring, sometimes to her 
law clerks or other friends. I was also 
privileged to argue three cases before 
her on the U.S. Supreme Court. I ar-
gued four as attorney general of Con-
necticut, and I can tell you that I 
feared nobody more on that Court be-
cause her incisive, piercing, pene-
trating questions cut to the core of the 
issues. Sometimes they actually could 
rescue an arguer from a rabbit hole 
that some other Justice drew the plain-
tiff or defendant, appellant or appellee 
down because she would go to the heart 
of what the case really concerned. She 
was straight to the point. 
And that is why, straight to the 
point now, we need to carry on the 
fight on so many of those principles. 
Yes, she was an icon and a giant. She 
broke barriers from the classroom to 
the courtroom. She demonstrated cour-
age and conviction in her career that 
were unexcelled, but she stood for prin-
ciple, and that is ultimately her leg-
acy. 
Maybe it is no coincidence—a sad and 
tragic coincidence that this Nation has 
just passed the 200,000 mark of Ameri-
cans who have died from COVID–19. 
That number is due to the administra-
tion’s callous indifference to science, 
its cruel disregard for human life. Don-
ald Trump’s self-absorption has led to 
countless lies about the dangers of this 
pandemic—the latest and most out-
rageous being that it has affected no-
body. Well, it has affected everyone in 
this Chamber. Think about it for a mo-
ment. Every one of us knows someone, 
has worked with someone, has a loved 
one or a friend who has been affected. 
A friend of mine whose children grew 
up playing with mine passed away 5 
days from getting the virus. Yet, at 
this moment when we are threatened 
with a continuing, raging pandemic in 
this country, a persistent public health 
crisis greater than any in our lifetime, 
and an economic crisis that prevents 
people from putting food on their fam-
ily’s table, and small businesses are 
going under, we are going to rush 
through a nominee who would deci-
mate protections for preexisting condi-
tions—which, by the way, now includes 
COVID–19, 
because 
COVID–19 
does 
great damage even to survivors’ lungs 
and heart and brains and other organs. 
It is a preexisting condition, and along 
with other benefits in the Affordable 
Care Act, like the ability to stay on a 
parent’s coverage for a young person

up to 26 years old, all will be decimated 
because the Trump administration is in 
the Supreme Court in a case that will 
be argued on November 10 seeking to 
destroy it. That protection for pre-
existing conditions will be gone, in 
part because this new Justice, we 
know, is committed to eliminating it. 
How do we know? Because the Presi-
dent himself has said a strong test will 
be applied. So those groups, like the 
Federalist Society and the Heritage 
Foundation and others who do the vet-
ting and screening for this administra-
tion—the choice has been outsourced 
to them—have vetted and screened 
that short list, and every one of them 
you can bet has passed that test. 
The second part of that test is wom-
en’s reproductive rights. Donald Trump 
has said another part of that strong 
test will be overturning Roe v. Wade. 
Now, I was a law clerk to Justice Harry 
Blackmun in the 1974–1975 term right 
after Roe was decided. So I have lived 
with the efforts to overturn Roe. I have 
fought against those efforts. I have 
seen the campaigns in the State legis-
latures, 
and 
they 
are 
even 
more 
present and threatening than ever be-
fore. 
The threat to Roe v. Wade is very 
much with us. In fact, we were con-
cerned even after the last Supreme 
Court decision on reproductive rights 
that, in fact, Roe was in danger. Just 3 
months ago, we held our breath wait-
ing for the Supreme Court decision in 
June Medical Services v. Russo, the 
latest attack on reproductive rights, 
because we knew there was more than 
a chance that the Court could strip 
away those rights from women across 
the country. The Court on the slim-
mest of margins upheld Roe—the nar-
rowest of legal readings. It was a land-
mark legal victory against the radical 
politicians who continue to attack re-
productive rights notwithstanding Roe 
v. Wade, but those principles of Roe are 
now more in danger than ever before. 
The administration and the Repub-
lican majority, instead of dealing with 
this pandemic, are rushing to approve a 
nominee who would decimate protec-
tions for women’s reproductive rights. 
And there will be real consequences for 
real people, as there are in many other 
rights that would be at stake and at 
risk—voting rights, marriage equality, 
gun violence protections, civil rights 
and 
civil 
liberties, 
and 
protection 
against 
gender 
discrimination, 
the 
threat to protection from preexisting 
conditions like cancer, substance abuse 
disorder, diabetes, kidney disease, Par-
kinson’s or pregnancy, and now, for an 
increasing 
number 
of 
Americans, 
COVID is most striking. 
An 
example 
is 
Conner 
from 
Ridgefield, CT. I have spoken about 
him previously on the floor. Several 
years ago, Conner was diagnosed with 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy. It is a 
degenerative, life-threatening disease 
with no cure. He was 4 years old when 
he was diagnosed. His parents sought 
treatment and learned it would cost 
tens of thousands of dollars each year, 
which they couldn’t afford, but because 
of the protections for people from pre-
existing conditions, it was a life saved. 
Conner is in school. Conner is thriving. 
Conner is a fighter, just as Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg was a fighter. Conner never 
gave up, and neither did Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg. 
Conner endured the harsh reality of 
physical illness and emotional trauma. 
And Ruth Bader Ginsburg reached out 
to people like Conner and offered them 
hope. She reached out to women and 
she inspired a whole new generation of 
women and many of us know them be-
cause they are women in our families 
who decided to pursue a career in law 
because of her example. She was small 
in stature, soft in voice, but she packed 
a powerful punch, even before she was 
a rock star and a pop icon, because she 
never gave up. She was a fighter. We 
cannot give up now. 
We must fight for a process that is 
fair and gives the next President and 
the next Senate the choice about the 
next Supreme Court justice. That was 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dying wish. We 
should fight for that principle because 
it is a matter of fairness. It is a matter 
of people keeping their word. 
In this place, there are almost no un-
written rules. There are no written 
rules. There are more unwritten rules, 
and one of those rules is people keep 
their word. So we need to fight and 
make sure that the legacy of Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg is upheld, that these 
constitutional principles that matter 
in the real lives of real people are 
upheld, and we cannot give up. Her 
memory should always inspire us.

REMEMBERING JUSTICE RUTH 
BADER GINSBURG 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleagues in mourn-
ing an American hero, Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. We called Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg the ‘‘Notorious RBG,’’ and we 
called her that for a reason. She lived 
an inspiring and historic life, and her 
advocacy and public service changed 
America for the better. 
As a lawyer and a public servant and 
as a woman, I owe so much to Justice 
Ginsburg, and I know I am not alone. I 
join so many women in this body and 
across this Nation who will simply not 
allow for Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s legacy 
to be diminished or disrespected. 
Today, that means standing up and 
speaking out about what is at stake 
right now in this country. We are 8 
months into a global pandemic—the 
worst public health crisis of our life-
time. It has taken 200,000 American 
souls and cost millions of Americans 
their jobs and their economic security. 
Now, President Trump knew that 
this pandemic was deadly, and he re-
fused to take decisive action early in 
order to control the virus. He still has 
no plan to this day, and he has refused 
to lead. He has continued to put poli-
tics over science, and he still insists 
the virus will just go away. 
In fact, this pandemic will not just 
go away, and in Wisconsin and in 
States across our country, things con-
tinue to get worse. As our Nation 
fights this unprecedented public health 
crisis, President Trump continues his 
efforts, spanning the past 4 years, to 
sabotage our healthcare system and 
make it harder for people to get the 
coverage that they want and that they 
desperately need. 
Since the President took office, more 
and more Americans are going without 
health insurance with each passing 
year. More than 6 million American 
workers have lost access to their em-
ployer-sponsored 
health 
insurance 
since the very beginning of this pan-
demic. 
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, 
they have a safety net in place that al-
lows them to sign up for a healthcare 
plan while they are unemployed. But 
right now, we should be making it easi-
er, not harder, for people to get 
healthcare. We should be building on 
the progress that we made with the Af-
fordable Care Act by providing addi-
tional support for the navigators and 
those who provide enrollment assist-
ance. We should be extending open en-
rollment and making sure that Ameri-
cans know that they have options for 
comprehensive coverage. 
But, instead, President Trump has 
doubled down in his support for a Fed-
eral lawsuit to eliminate the Afford-
able Care Act completely, including 
the protections for millions upon mil-
lions of Americans who have pre-
existing health conditions. And, mind 
you, a positive test for COVID–19 is a 
preexisting condition. 
Let me say that again. During the 
worst public health crisis of our life-
times, President Trump and Repub-
licans support a Federal lawsuit to 
eliminate the Affordable Care Act com-
pletely—taking healthcare away from

September 22, 2020 
millions of Americans, including those 
with preexisting conditions. And that, 
plain and simple, is the Republican 
healthcare plan—eliminating the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
If Senate Republicans disregard the 
very precedent that they set, ignore 
the fact that there is an election in 6 
weeks where many Americans are al-
ready voting, and push to fill this Su-
preme Court vacancy with a judge com-
mitted 
to 
furthering 
their 
anti- 
healthcare agenda, it will mean the end 
of the Affordable Care Act and the end 
of guaranteed protections for people 
with preexisting health conditions. 
Just like that, our Nation will be 
thrust back to a time where the insur-
ance companies wrote the rules, when a 
cancer diagnosis or diabetes or asthma 
meant insurance companies could drop 
the ER coverage, charge astronomical 
premiums for the coverage or, worse, 
could decline to cover you at all and 
leave you with the bill. 
I have stood in this Chamber and told 
story after story of Wisconsinites who 
depend upon the Affordable Care Act 
and are worried about what a future 
without it might look like, stories of 
mothers who lie awake at night won-
dering how they will be able to afford a 
lifesaving procedure for a child, and 
stories of fathers who don’t know if 
they will be able to afford the insulin 
that a son may need. 
I have shared my own story. As a 9- 
year-old, I got sick—really sick. I was 
hospitalized, but, ultimately, I fully re-
covered. But then I was denied health 
insurance for much of my youth be-
cause I had been labeled as a child with 
a preexisting health condition. 
These stories are real, and there isn’t 
a Senator in this body who hasn’t 
heard one or dozens or hundreds of sto-
ries just like this from their own con-
stituents. I implore my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to listen to 
your constituents now. 
Justice Ginsburg was one of the de-
ciding votes to save healthcare each 
time it had been challenged in the Su-
preme Court. She was one of the decid-
ing votes on case after case threat-
ening a woman’s right to make her own 
healthcare decisions about her own 
body. Justice Ginsburg was protecting 
our healthcare and women’s reproduc-
tive freedom, and she bore the weight 
of that for the last years of her life 
through her own battles with cancer. 
She fought for as long as she could be-
cause she knew what was at stake. 
Justice Ginsburg has earned the 
right to rest now, and my deepest con-
dolences go out to her children, her 
grandchildren, her family, and her 
friends for their loss. I urge my Repub-
lican colleagues not to diminish her 
tremendous contributions to our Na-
tion and not to disrespect her decades 
of service by casting aside her dying 
wishes and their own precedent in forc-
ing through a nomination with only 42 
days before the election. 
I urge my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, instead of suing in 
court to overturn the Affordable Care 
Act, to work with us on a real 
healthcare plan, and work with us to 
protect quality, affordable healthcare 
that America’s families need. That is 
why we are here. 
My promise today to my constituents 
and my colleagues is that I will not 
stop fighting to save healthcare for 
millions of Americans. This is the fight 
that brought me to public service in 
the first place, and I will not stop now. 
I will keep working to protect access to 
quality, affordable healthcare for all, 
and I will keep fighting on behalf of the 
many, many Wisconsinites who depend 
on it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, the 
Russian Federation has a Constitution, 
and if you read Russia’s Constitution, 
you would know that Russia is a de-
mocracy. Why? Because their Constitu-
tion guarantees the existence of a vi-
brant, multiparty political system. The 
Russian Constitution prohibits the use 
of extrajudicial force or torture by the 
government. Their constitution says: 
‘‘Censorship of the media is prohib-
ited.’’ 
Russia is a democracy if you read 
their Constitution, but Russia isn’t a 
democracy, of course. It is a dictator-
ship. One man rules. No one has the 
right to dissent. There is no freedom of 
the press. All of that is under the pen-
alty of death. 
Now, why is this? Well, it is because 
democracies 
aren’t 
made 
by 
their 
founding document. The document is 
just a piece of paper—parchment, in 
our case—with words written on it, and 
these words are just that: They are 
words. Democracy doesn’t work unless 
its leaders choose to follow the rules 
that those words prescribe, but also to 
operate in the spirit of the values that 
undergird those words. 
Vladimir Putin will proudly tell you 
that, technically, Russia adheres to its 
Constitution. Now, that is not true, ob-
viously, but what Putin has done over 
the years is just slowly erode a demo-
cratic system by using every single 
inch of discretion allowed to him by 
that Constitution to make democracy 
functionally impossible. He will say 
that censorship doesn’t exist because 
there isn’t an explicit censorship law, 
but we all know that he has used every 
informal mechanism available to him 
to make sure that there is no room—no 
room—for the independence of the 
press. 
Something stunning happened here 4 
years ago. A Supreme Court vacancy 
arose through the death of Justice 
Scalia. The Constitution says that a 
new Supreme Court Justice can’t be 
seated unless he or she gets an affirma-
tive vote from the Senate, and every 
single nominee—at least those who 
weren’t withdrawn by the President— 
essentially got a vote from the Senate 
before 
2016 
because, 
you 
see, 
the 
Founding Fathers didn’t actually re-
quire the Senate to vote. They didn’t 
because they assumed that leaders of 
good faith would, of course, fulfill that 
responsibility to hold a vote. They 
never considered that the Senate might 
stretch its discretion under the Con-
stitution so broadly to refuse to con-
sider a nominee simply because they 
didn’t like the President who made the 
nomination. 
The Founders didn’t actually micro-
manage democracy. They set these 
broad rules, and they trusted that we 
would all act in good faith toward each 
other and with a patriotism toward our 
Nation in filling in the details. 
But that is not how 2016 went down. 
Senate Republicans said they were set-
ting a new precedent: When a nomina-
tion is made in the last year of a Presi-
dent’s term, the Senate shouldn’t act 
on it. The Senate, in that case, Repub-
licans said, should wait for the out-
come of the election and let the Presi-
dent who wins make the selection. 
Now, what Senator MCCONNELL and 
Senator GRAHAM have said is pretty de-
finitive. It is well covered. But there 
were lots of Senate Republicans who 
are still here who were equally defini-
tive about the rules they were estab-
lishing. 
For instance, the senior Senator 
from Florida said: 
I don’t think we should be moving forward 
on a nominee in the last year of [a Presi-
dent’s term]. I would say that even if it was 
a Republican president. 
That was the rule that Republicans 
repeated over and over and over and 
over and over and over. They are not 
telling the truth if they try to spin it 
differently, and we all know this. 
So you may ask: Why does it matter 
that they weren’t telling the truth? 
Why does it matter that Republicans 
didn’t honor their word? Why does it 
matter that they are willing to bend 
the rules, no matter the promises they 
have made in the past, whenever it 
suits them in order to gain political ad-
vantage? 
Well, it is back to the bet that the 
Founding Fathers made. They just 
didn’t anticipate a moment like today, 
when truth doesn’t matter, when lying 
is normal, when honor is dead. They 
left us a bunch of wiggle room in the 
Constitution, knowing that we had to 
treat each other well, with respect, 
with a concern for precedent, in order 
to have a functional democracy. 
Senator ALEXANDER, whom I greatly 
admire, said in his statement the other 
day that nobody should be surprised 
that Republicans are going to confirm 
a Supreme Court nominee before the 
election, notwithstanding the fact that 
the election has already started and 
that it also wipes out the precedent 
that they just claimed was so sacred 4 
years ago. 
That statement is really revealing. 
Whether he meant it or not, what he is 
saying is that nobody should be sur-
prised by now that Republicans are 
just willing to do whatever it takes— 
even making up complete fabrications,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5772 
September 22, 2020 
like a new rule against confirming Jus-
tices in an election year—in order to 
accumulate more power. 
That is a really dangerous place for 
this body to head, because the Con-
stitution does provide all sorts of room 
to push that document to its limits, to 
dispense with all fairness and honor 
and fair play, and to just seek power, 
no matter the costs. 
I know this sounds silly, but it is not. 
There is nothing in the Constitution 
that prohibits the majority party in 
this body from, for instance, denying 
all staff to minority Members. There is 
nothing stopping the majority party 
from banning all minority party Mem-
bers from speaking on the floor. And 
once you don’t care about fairness, 
once you can just change precedent on 
a dime just to accumulate power, then, 
there is really no end. 
I get it that a comparison to Russia 
seems a little tortured and a little 
strained, but, honestly, this is how de-
mocracies fall apart—when power be-
comes more important than the rule of 
law, our sense of fairness, or even loy-
alty to country; when your word means 
nothing; when no one can count on 
anyone to stay true to what they say; 
when there is nihilism, trump’s patri-
otism. 
There are new rules in the Senate 
now. We get that. There are new rules. 
Republicans might pretend like they 
existed before today, but they didn’t. 
This breaks the glass like nothing else 
did before it. 
Finally, let me ask this: To what 
end? Why is it so important that Re-
publicans so nakedly grab for power 
and reset the very rules of how the 
Senate operates—rules that were so 
important 4 years ago? 
It is not coincidental that the case 
that the Supreme Court is due to hear 
days after the election is a case that 
has to do with something the Repub-
licans have been trying so desperately 
and unsuccessfully to do for 10 years— 
repeal the Affordable Care Act and end 
healthcare for 20 million Americans 
and protections against rate gouging 
for 130 million with preexisting condi-
tions. 
It is worth repeating this. I know my 
colleagues have said it before, and they 
will say it after, but if Republicans are 
successful in appointing an anti-ACA 
Justice to the Supreme Court—and 
President Trump has made it clear 
that he is not putting anyone up for 
the Supreme Court who isn’t willing to 
strike down the Affordable Care Act— 
then we will have a humanitarian ca-
tastrophe on our hands in this country 
because days after the election, a case 
is to be heard that will be heard by 
that new Justice that asks to invali-
date the entirety of the Affordable 
Care Act—not in pieces, not over time, 
but immediately, the whole thing. 
That is 25 million people losing access 
to healthcare—Medicaid and the State 
and Federal exchanges—in the middle 
of a pandemic. 
Think about that. Think about 25 
million—the equivalency of something 
like 10 to 15 different States—all losing 
healthcare right off the bat, when 
COVID is raging in this country. 
As Senator BALDWIN said, COVID is a 
preexisting condition. We are just 
learning what it does to your body, but 
it may ravage it. And, ultimately, ev-
eryone in this country who knows they 
have COVID or finds out about it 
through antibody tests down the line 
will have their rates jacked up if the 
Affordable Care Act goes away. 
Spare me the talk of a replacement 
coming. I have been in this body long 
enough to know that there is no re-
placement coming. Republicans have 
been talking about it for 10 years. 
The Affordable Care Act will be in-
validated by this Court with this new 
nominee. Nothing will replace it. Mil-
lions 
of 
people 
will 
lose 
their 
healthcare. 
The reason this nomination is being 
pushed through is, yes, because Repub-
licans care about power more than any-
thing else but also to make sure that 
the Court around the corner from here 
does 
what 
the 
American 
people 
wouldn’t let Congress do. 
Remember, Congress could not repeal 
the Affordable Care Act because the 
people wouldn’t let Congress do it. But 
nobody is going to be fooled about this 
end-around. By the time this nominee 
comes before this body, nobody is going 
to be mistaken about the consequences 
for Americans’ healthcare. 
I know that a lot of people think 
Democrats are foolishly naive. How 
could we be surprised by this treach-
ery, this about-face of precedent on 
election-year confirmations, when Re-
publicans have been changing the rules 
of the Senate at light speed for 5 years? 
First it was unprecedented denial of 
a vote for a Supreme Court nominee in 
2016. It never happened before in Amer-
ican history. Then it was the abolition 
of the 60-vote requirement for Supreme 
Court nominees. Then it was the re-
striction of debate on judges and polit-
ical appointees so that nobody could 
actually see how wildly unqualified the 
people Donald Trump was appointing 
to office were. Then it was the end of 
blue slips so that even more radical 
nominees could be put on the bench. It 
has been just one power grab after an-
other. 
So, yes, we probably have seen this 
coming, and we probably should have 
known that a party so committed to 
ending health insurance for 20 million 
Americans would do anything to make 
that happen. 
But I was naive. I still had hope. I 
still believed that honor was alive in 
this place. I still thought that when 
people said things, they meant it, and 
they would stick to it. I still thought 
that we could save the Senate. 
I believe in my heart that Repub-
licans are going to rue the day that 
they made nakedly clear that a Sen-
ator’s word means nothing, where this 
place is simply a vehicle to compile as 
much power as quickly as possible, no 
matter the cost. 
American democracy is not just the 
Constitution. It is us. It is the deci-
sions we make every single day. It is 
the way we treat each other. It is the 
decision as to whether we care about 
our word mattering. This month, as it 
stands tonight, democracy’s flicker 
just got a whole lot duller. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. 
WARREN. 
Madam 
President, 
‘‘trailblazer,’’ ‘‘icon,’’ ‘‘titan,’’ ‘‘Noto-
rious RBG’’—those are just a few of the 
words that describe the Honorable Jus-
tice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who passed 
away last Friday. But there is another 
of Justice Ginsburg’s title that I will 
always hold dear: ‘‘friend.’’ 
As a young mother and a baby law 
student at Rutgers’s Law School, I had 
almost no examples of female lawyers 
or female law professors. Like so many 
young women who were trying to do 
something as seemingly outlandish as 
going to law school, it was a really 
lonely undertaking. 
Ruth was one of the few women 
whom we could see—a woman who had 
made it, and, even better, a woman 
who was fighting for other women. 
As I arrived at Rutgers, Ruth had left 
Rutgers for Columbia Law School. Rut-
gers was a small family, and all the 
women and the men knew about her. 
She was putting together the Women’s 
Rights Project at the ACLU to give her 
a way to fight for equality in the 
courts. Her sharp legal mind and stub-
born determination were already leg-
endary, and we were sure she would 
change the world. And she did. 
I am forever grateful for her example 
to me and to millions of young women 
who saw her as a role model. I am also 
forever grateful that she made real 
change, opening doors that had re-
mained stubbornly closed. 
Justice Ginsburg may have been 
tiny, but she stands among the great-
est fighters for justice our Nation has 
ever seen. She turned every barrier 
into an opportunity for change. And 
when she became the second woman in 
our Nation’s history to sit on the Su-
preme Court, she continued her fight 
for justice, blazing a trail for women’s 
rights, laying out the framework for 
protecting our democracy, and helping 
to secure justice for the most vulner-
able. Ruth Bader Ginsburg changed the 
world, and I will miss her. 
While I mourn her loss, I also hold 
close one of the things I loved most 
about Ruth: She was a fighter. We 
honor her memory by fighting for the 
things 
that 
Ruth 
Bader 
Ginsburg 
fought for during her long career: a 
woman’s right to make decisions about 
her own body, healthcare for millions 
of Americans, Dreamers who have 
made a home here, voting rights, 
LGBTQ rights, workers’ rights, union 
rights, and making our Nation a place 
where no one is more likely to be mur-
dered or imprisoned or discriminated 
against because of the color of their 
skin, how they worship, or who they 
love.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5773 
September 22, 2020 
Yes, it is a long list. Ruth defended it 
all, and now she is gone, and because 
she is gone, these rights and values are 
all on the line, vulnerable to being 
snatched away by another rightwing 
tilt of the Supreme Court. 
Justice Ginsburg’s replacements will 
determine who the highest Court in the 
land works for—women and sick kids 
and workers and immigrants or billion-
aires and giant companies and right-
wing politicians who want to shrink 
our democracy in order to stay in 
power. 
Ruth left our Nation a note before 
she died, and her words were clear. She 
said that her most fervent wish was 
that her replacement not be named 
until a new President is installed. 
Senator MCCONNELL has already told 
us how to deal with the death of a Su-
preme Court Justice in an election 
year—a Justice whom Senator MCCON-
NELL treated with respect. 
In 2016, Justice Scalia died a full 269 
days before the Presidential election— 
months before any American would be 
able to cast a vote. But in 2016, that 
didn’t matter to Senator MCCONNELL 
and his Republican henchmen. They 
locked arms and insisted there could be 
no confirmation until after the next 
President had been elected and sworn 
in. 
Now, in 2020, the world is evidently 
different. 
Senator 
MCCONNELL
has 
made it clear that the practice he used 
when Justice Scalia died would not be 
used when Justice Ginsburg died. 
On the very same night that Justice 
Ginsburg passed, MITCH MCCONNELL an-
nounced that he and Donald Trump 
would move immediately to name a 
new Supreme Court Justice, despite 
the fact that voting is already under-
way across the country and there are 
only 42 days before the election is com-
pleted. 
Democrat or Republican, the Amer-
ican people know that is not right. 
Democrat or Republican, the American 
people know that treating a Supreme 
Court vacancy as an opportunity for a 
naked partisan no-holds-barred power 
grab is burning down the pillars of in-
tegrity that support our Senate, our 
courts, and our democracy. Democrat 
or Republican, the American people 
will judge these choices for what they 
are—shameful. 
If this feels personal, that is because 
it is. Ruth Ginsburg was a personal 
hero, for me and for millions of other 
women. 
Ruth Ginsburg was a woman who 
never let any man silence her. The 
most fitting tribute to her is to refuse 
to be silenced and to name exactly 
what Donald Trump and Senate Repub-
licans are trying to do: steal another 
Supreme Court seat. 
This kind of sleazy double-dealing is 
the last gasp of a desperate party that 
is undemocratically overrepresented in 
Congress and in the halls of power 
across our country, the last gasp of a 
corrupt Republican leadership numbed 
to its own hypocrisy that doesn’t re-
flect the views of the majority of 
Americans or the values that we hold 
dear, the last gasp of a rightwing, bil-
lionaire-fueled party that wants to 
hold onto power a little longer in order 
to impose its extremist agenda on the 
entire country. 
And if MITCH
MCCONNELL
and the 
Senate Republicans ram this nomina-
tion through, it is our duty to explore 
every option we have to restore the 
Court’s credibility and integrity; every 
option to expand our democracy, not 
shrink it; every option to ensure that a 
working single parent and a million-
aire corporate executive have equal 
justice in our courts; and every option 
to ensure that all Americans are rep-
resented in our institutions. 
The list of what is at stake if Repub-
licans get their way and their extrem-
ist agenda finds a home in the Nation’s 
highest Court is truly staggering. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg voted to pro-
tect healthcare for millions of Ameri-
cans. In a 5-to-4 decision, healthcare 
was saved for millions of people. But in 
the midst of a global pandemic with 
more than 200,000 of our loved ones 
dead from a virus raging out of control, 
MITCH MCCONNELL and Senate Repub-
licans want to install a Justice who 
will rip that healthcare away. 
The Supreme Court will hear argu-
ments just days after the election on 
whether the Affordable Care Act should 
be overturned. If Justice Ginsburg is 
replaced 
with 
a 
McConnell-Trump 
choice, the 5-to-4 decision that saved 
healthcare by a single vote could be 
overturned. 
That would strip away protection 
from anyone with preexisting condi-
tions. It would tell people with diabe-
tes or high blood pressure or cancer, 
people who have had strokes, people 
who have had hundreds of other dis-
eases, conditions, and events: You are 
on your own—no protection from an in-
surance company that just wants to 
cut off your insurance policies. 
It would let insurance companies 
charge women more simply because 
they are women. It would end the re-
quirement that insurance companies 
cover young people up to the age of 26. 
It would gut Medicaid. 
And if you are one of the millions of 
Americans who has had COVID and sur-
vived, well, gutting the ACA would 
allow insurance companies to deny cov-
erage because of it. COVID could be-
come your preexisting condition. 
Three years ago, MITCH MCCONNELL 
couldn’t get the votes to repeal the Af-
fordable Care Act, even in his own Re-
publican-controlled Senate. And why? 
Because this is not what the American 
people want. They want access to 
healthcare and protection for people 
with preexisting conditions. 
But MITCH MCCONNELL and Donald 
Trump have a plan B, a plan to advance 
their rightwing agenda even if most 
Americans don’t want it, and MCCON-
NELL and Trump seem to think that, if 
they can steal another Supreme Court 
seat, they will get it. 
There is more at stake. Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg voted to protect the rights of 
all women to make their own decisions 
about their bodies. Just a few months 
ago, in another 5-to-4 decision, Ruth 
Ginsburg’s vote was crucial to the Su-
preme Court overturning a Louisiana 
law designed to make it harder for 
women to access abortion care. 
Trump promised to appoint a Su-
preme Court Justice who will overturn 
Roe, and his two Supreme Court picks 
have already delivered, agreeing to let 
Louisiana restrict a woman’s right to 
choose. 
Nineteen States now stand ready to 
gut abortion protections if the Su-
preme Court overturns Roe, and now 
Senator MCCONNELL and Senate Repub-
licans want to hand them one more 
Justice so they can get the job done. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg also voted over 
and over for the principle that Amer-
ican citizens should have an equal 
right to vote and an equal voice in our 
democracy. She issued a scathing dis-
sent in Shelby County v. Holder, the 
Supreme Court decision overturning 
part of the Voting Rights Act. 
As the pandemic continues to sweep 
the Nation, the Supreme Court has 
blocked attempts to make it easier for 
Americans to safely cast their vote. 
Just in April, in a 5-to-4 decision with 
Justice Ginsburg dissenting, the Court 
reversed a lower Federal court’s deci-
sion to expand the deadline for absen-
tee voting in Wisconsin by 6 days. 
Republicans know that, to stay in 
power, they need to make it harder for 
all Americans to participate in the 
democratic process, and they want a 
Supreme Court Justice who will be 
committed 
to 
rolling 
back 
voting 
rights for decades to come. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg understood the 
threat that climate change poses to 
our children’s and our grandchildren’s 
future. She joined in the opinion in 
Massachusetts v. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, another 5-to-4 ruling, 
which required the EPA to regulate 
greenhouse gas emissions from auto-
mobiles. 
The Trump administration and con-
gressional Republicans have actively 
rolled back regulations that keep our 
air clean and our water safe, and they 
are committed to putting another Jus-
tice on the Supreme Court who will 
help advance their anti-environment 
agenda and block any government at-
tempts to tackle the dangers of cli-
mate change. 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg understood the 
importance of protecting the rights of 
workers to join together and fight for 
fair pay and working conditions. In 
Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, she joined 
the minority in a 5-to-4 decision dis-
senting from the Court’s ruling that 
employers can ban workers from join-
ing together to demand protections 
against wage theft and other abuses. A 
Supreme Court Justice handpicked by 
Trump and MCCONNELL could turn back 
the clock even more on workers’ 
rights.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5774 
September 22, 2020 
Throughout her life, Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg fought for justice and equal-
ity for all Americans, and now Ameri-
cans across this country are following 
in Justice Ginsburg’s footsteps. Ameri-
cans are speaking out and demanding 
change, and they are voting. With a 
pandemic raging out of control, thanks 
to the incompetence and the corrup-
tion of Donald Trump and his Repub-
lican enablers, with a battered econ-
omy and millions of people out of 
work, with Americans across the coun-
try calling for an end to the systemic 
racism that has cut short the lives of 
countless 
Black 
men 
and 
women, 
Americans understand now more than 
ever that this year’s elections will de-
termine the direction of our Nation for 
generations to come. 
Today, Ruth is gone, but her life’s 
work endures. We will honor her with 
action and channel our grief into 
change. We are at the cusp of a bright-
er day in our Nation, and this is the 
moment. We must tap into the reserves 
that we didn’t know we had. 
We tap into the reserves bequeathed 
to us from fighters we have recently 
lost—like Justice Ginsburg and Con-
gressman Elijah Cummings and Con-
gressman JOHN LEWIS—AND
FROM
THE 
KNOWLEDGE THAT WE CANNOT—WE WILL 
NOT—LEAVE OUR CHILDREN WORSE OFF. 
Three years ago I watched our Nation 
rise up in the face of impossible odds 
and defend healthcare when Donald 
Trump and MITCH MCCONNELL wanted 
to strip away care from millions of 
Americans. We face those same odds 
today as we again fight to protect the 
healthcare of those same Americans 
and to protect so much more. 
But I have hope because I know that 
this is a righteous fight, and I know 
that millions of other Americans are 
also in this fight. 
Before she died, Ruth gave us our 
marching orders: Do not fill this Su-
preme Court seat until after the elec-
tion when the next President is in-
stalled. We have our call to action. We 
honor her legacy by continuing the 
fight for justice, for equality, and for 
dignity—the fight for a world where we 
finally make those words ‘‘equal jus-
tice under law’’ real. 
Now I would like to spend just a lit-
tle bit of time focusing on Justice 
Ginsburg’s legacy by reading just a few 
of the statements by her that really 
stood out to me as I reflected on her 
work. 
At a 2012 symposium to honor the 
40th anniversary of Justice Ginsburg 
being hired as the first woman with 
full tenure at Columbia Law School, 
two 
of 
Justice 
Ginsburg’s 
former 
clerks, 
Abbe 
Gluck 
and 
Gillian 
Metzger, 
now 
both 
law 
professors 
themselves, had a public conversation 
with their former boss. 
They asked Justice Ginsburg how she 
ended up working with the ACLU, 
which became a major part of her leg-
endary career, and she began her an-
swer by discussing the time that she 
lived in Sweden. Here is what she said: 
My eyes were opened up in Sweden. This 
was in ’62 and ’63—women were about a quar-
ter of the law students there, perhaps three 
percent in the United States. It was already 
well accepted that a family should have two 
wage-earners. A woman named Eva Moberg 
wrote a column in the Stockholm Daily 
paper with the headline, ‘‘Why should the 
woman have two jobs and the man only 
one?’’ And the thrust of it was, yes, she is ex-
pected to have a paying job, but she should 
also have dinner on the table at seven, take 
her children to buy new shoes, to their med-
ical check-ups, and the rest. The notion that 
he should do more than take out the garbage 
sparked debates that were very interesting 
to me. Also in the months I spent there, a 
woman came to Sweden from Arizona to 
have an abortion. Her name was Sherri 
Finkbine. She had taken thalidomide and 
there was a grave risk that the fetus, if it 
survived, would be terribly deformed. So she 
came to Sweden and there was publicity that 
she was there because she had no access to a 
legal abortion in her home state. Well, that 
was at the start of the 60s. I put it all on a 
back burner until the late 60s when the wom-
en’s movement came alive in the United 
States. 
My students, then at Rutgers, asked for a 
course on sex discrimination and the law. 
And I went to the library and inside of a 
month read every federal court decision on 
gender discrimination—no mean feat at all 
because there were so few, so very few. Also 
I had signed up as a volunteer lawyer with 
the ACLU of New Jersey, more because it 
was a respectable way of getting litigation 
experience than out of ideological reasons, I 
will admit. Complaints from women began 
trickling into the office, new kinds of com-
plaints. For example, women who were 
school teachers were required to leave the 
classroom the minute their pregnancy began 
to show because, after all, the children 
shouldn’t be led to think that their teachers 
swallowed a watermelon. Anyway, these 
were women ready, willing, and able to work, 
but forced out on so-called maternity leave, 
which meant ‘‘You’re out, and if we want 
you back, we’ll call.’’ 
Another group of new complainants were 
women who had blue-collar jobs and wanted 
the same health insurance package for their 
family that a man would get. A woman could 
get health insurance for herself, but she 
wasn’t considered the breadwinner in the 
family. Only the man got family benefits. 
And just to indicate the variety, there was a 
wonderful summer program at Princeton. 
The National Organization for Women com-
plained about it. Princeton had already be-
come co-educational. The summer program 
was for students at the end of sixth grade. It 
was a Summer in Engineering program. The 
children came on campus, they had an en-
riched program in math and science. There 
was just one problem: it was for boys, not 
girls. I should also mention one other com-
plainant. Abbe Seldin was her name. She was 
the best tennis player in her Teaneck, New 
Jersey high school, but she couldn’t be on 
the varsity team. There was no team for 
girls, and although she could beat all the 
boys, she couldn’t be on the team. 
So all this was under way. People 
were lodging complaints they were ei-
ther too timid to make before or they 
were sure they would lose. But in the 
1970s, they could become winners be-
cause there was a spirit in the land, a 
growing understanding that the way 
things had been was not right and 
should be changed. 
They brought those complaints, and 
Ruthie Ginsburg is one of the people 
who helped make those changes. As we 
all know, Justice Ginsburg went on to 
become one of the fiercest advocates 
for women’s rights our Nation has ever 
seen. 
On the Supreme Court, Justice Gins-
burg became famous for her dissents. 
She was asked about this, and I think 
her response is worth sharing. 
[Y]ou can let out all the stops when you’re 
a dissenter. I would distinguish two kinds of 
dissent. There’s the great dissent written for 
a future age—the Brandeis and Holmes Free 
Speech dissents around the time of World 
War I are exemplary. They are the law of the 
land today. Another kind of dissent aims to 
prompt immediate action from the legisla-
ture. The Lilly Ledbetter case is a recent ex-
ample. I should tell Lilly Ledbetter’s story 
because some of you may not know it. 
Lilly Ledbetter worked as an area manager 
for a Goodyear Tire Plant. She was hired in 
the 70s, then the only woman doing that job, 
and was initially paid the same as her male 
colleagues. Over time, her pay slipped. She 
might have suspected it but she didn’t know 
it for sure because Goodyear, like most em-
ployers, didn’t give out its wage records. One 
day, she found a little slip in her box at the 
plant; it listed the salaries of the men em-
ployed as area managers. Compared to 
Ledbetter’s salary, the disparity was star-
tling, as much as forty percent. In the years 
of her employment at Goodyear, she’d done a 
pretty good job, earning satisfactory per-
formance ratings, so she thought she had a 
winnable case. She filed suit and won in the 
district court, gaining a substantial jury ver-
dict. On appeal, Goodyear argued that 
Ledbetter sued too late. She should have 
sued within the 180 days Title VII says, with-
in 180 days of the discriminatory incident, so 
if you count from the very first time her pay 
slipped, that would have been back in the 
70s. The Supreme Court agreed that her 
claim was untimely, which meant the jury’s 
verdict for damages was overturned. 
My dissenting opinion pointed out that a 
woman in Ledbetter’s position, the only 
woman doing a job up till then done only by 
men, doesn’t want to rock the boat. She is 
unlikely to complain the first time she sus-
pects something is awry. She will wait until 
she has a secure case. My opinion suggested 
that if she had sued the first time her pay-
check was lower, had she found out about it, 
she probably would have lost because the ex-
cuse would have been ‘‘She doesn’t do the job 
as well as the men.’’ But after twenty years, 
that argument can’t be made with a straight 
face. By then, she has a winnable case. The 
Court’s answer, she sued too late. She argued 
that every paycheck renewed the discrimina-
tion. I agreed. My dissenting opinion con-
cluded: The ball is now in Congress’s court to 
amend Title VII to say what I thought Con-
gress meant all along. Within two years, the 
Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was passed. It 
was the first piece of legislation signed by 
President Obama. The audience to which my 
dissent appealed was Congress. Congress 
picked up the ball with a little help from 
many groups that prodded the legislators to 
amend Title VII. 
This is a reminder that Justice Gins-
burg used all of her tools to make 
change. 
Speaking of dissents, in 2014, Justice 
Ginsburg was asked about the worst 
ruling this current Court had produced. 
Her unambiguous answer foreshadows 
the dangers we face today. This is what 
she said: 
If there was one decision I would overrule, 
it would be Citizens United. I think the no-
tion that we have all the democracy that

money can buy strays so far from what our 
democracy is supposed to be. So that’s num-
ber one on my list. Number two would be the 
part of the health care decision that con-
cerns the commerce clause. Since 1937, the 
Court has allowed Congress a very free hand 
in enacting social and economic legislation. 
I thought that the attempt of the Court to 
intrude on Congress’s domain in that area 
had stopped by the end of the 1930s. Of course 
health care involves commerce. Perhaps 
number three would be Shelby County, in-
volving essentially the destruction of the 
Voting Rights Act. That act had a volumi-
nous legislative history. The bill extending 
the Voting Rights Act was passed over-
whelmingly by both houses, Republicans and 
Democrats, everyone was on board. The 
Court’s interference with that decision of the 
political branches seemed to me to be out of 
order. The Court should have respected the 
legislative judgment. Legislators know much 
more about elections than the Court does. 
And the same was true of Citizens United. I 
think members of the legislature, people who 
have to run for office, know the connection 
between money and influence on what laws 
get passed. 
And one last note, almost a year 
later, 
Justice 
Ginsburg’s 
opinion 
hadn’t changed. Let me read from a 
New York Times report about the re-
marks she delivered at Duke Law 
School: 
In 
expansive 
remarks 
on 
Wednesday 
evening, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg named 
the ‘‘most disappointing’’ Supreme Court de-
cision in her 22-year tenure, discussed the fu-
ture of the death penalty and abortion 
rights, talked about her love of opera and 
even betrayed a passing interest in rap 
music. 
The Court’s worst blunder, she said, was its 
2010 decision in Citizens United ‘‘because of 
what has happened to elections in the United 
States and the huge amount of money it 
takes to run for office.’’ 
She was in dissent in the 5–4 decision. 
The evening was sponsored by Duke Uni-
versity School of Law, and Justice Ginsburg 
answered questions from Neil S. Siegel, a 
professor there, and from students and alum-
ni. 
Echoing a dissent last month, she sug-
gested that she was prepared to vote to 
strike down the death penalty, saying that 
the capital justice system is riddled with er-
rors, plagued by bad lawyers, and subject to 
racial and geographic disparities. 
She added that she despaired over the state 
of abortion rights. 
‘‘Reproductive freedom is in a sorry situa-
tion in the United States,’’ she said. 
‘‘Poor women don’t have choice.’’ 
That was our Ruth Ginsburg, con-
cerned to the very end about how law 
affects all of the people it touches. 
Ruthie, we will miss you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor tonight to join my 
colleagues to honor the life of Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Before I do, 
though, I would like to first of all 
thank my colleague from Massachu-
setts for reviewing the many legal de-
cisions that Justice Ginsburg had been 
involved in and their significance. 
I am so glad to be out here tonight as 
you took time in your perspective on 
the importance of those cases. We defi-
nitely need to remember that these de-
cisions, these words, set the stage for 
so many things to come before the 
American people and for working fami-
lies. Thank you for that. 
f 
SAVANNA’S ACT 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, 
before I do, I wanted to say just a word 
about Savanna’s Act, which, I can tell 
you, Justice Ginsburg would probably 
be happy that the House has now 
passed and, previously, the Senate had 
passed Savanna’s Act, legislation that 
would help protect the rights and help 
move forward on changes to law en-
forcement that would better protect 
missing 
and 
murdered 
indigenous 
women. 
This 
legislation—originally 
spon-
sored by my colleagues Heidi Heitkamp 
and LISA
MURKOWSKI, and most re-
cently cosponsored by Senator MUR-
KOWSKI, Senator CORTEZ MASTO, and 
myself—I believe is on its way to the 
President’s desk, and I am hoping that 
the President will sign this important 
legislation as soon as possible. 
Indigenous women deserve to have 
the same rights and same protections 
under the law, but they need to have 
people who are tracking these heinous 
crimes that are happening because 
they are the victims of these crimes at 
a much higher rate than the general 
population. 
You ask yourself: Well, how can that 
be? When you think about these women 
being abducted and murdered and miss-
ing, you have to have law enforcement 
who are going to follow these cases, 
track individuals, track the court proc-
ess, and this is what better protocols, 
better statistics, and a better system is 
going to do with the passage of Savan-
na’s Act. It will give us those tools 
that we need for indigenous women. 
So I thank all of my colleagues for 
helping with the passage of that impor-
tant legislation. It is on its way to the 
President’s desk, and, again, I hope he 
will sign it as soon as possible. 
f 
REMEMBERING JUSTICE RUTH 
BADER GINSBURG 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
join my colleagues tonight to come 
here and honor the life of Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. As many people have 
said tonight already, what an unbeliev-
able hero she was—a trailblazer, a deep 
thinker. And there are the things she 
did on the Court to do so many impor-
tant things for the rights of Ameri-
cans. 
When I first met her in 2001, I had 
just come to Washington, DC, in my 
first year here in the U.S. Senate, and 
I just happened to go to a play at the 
Shakespeare Theatre, here near the 
Capitol, and had seats right next to her 
in the theater. I had probably already 
heard about her and knew of her, of 
course. That was of great significance 
even in 2001. But during the play, I no-
ticed, just as I do in a dark situation, 
oftentimes falling asleep a little bit, 
and I thought, wow, I don’t know, this 
woman is so petite and so tiny. And I 
had heard that she had been sick. I lit-
erally sat there in the dark concerned 
for her future. 
What a lesson about Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, because that was 2001. And in 
2020, she was going strong. This is not 
a woman to ever, ever, ever underesti-
mate. She took her tools and applied 
them for the betterment of American 
women and American society overall. 
People across the United States of 
America are reeling from her passing 
because they want to know who is 
going to stand up for their rights now 
that she is gone. 
There is something about that dimin-
utive figure with so much might and 
wisdom that succeeded on that groove 
of a Court with all those men and had 
the courage and the tenacity to read 
her dissent in the Lilly Ledbetter legis-
lation from the bench—the unusual 
move of saying: I might not have the 
decision I want today, but, by God, you 
are going to listen to what is wrong 
with gender inequality in America, and 
we are going to get on a path to fix it. 
When I think about that unbelievable 
moment that in her quiet, soft voice 
set the stage that we heard our col-
league Senator WARREN talk about to-
night, it is pretty amazing. That is why 
we need to have women in these places. 
We need to have them so you have the 
voice of diversity there to tell you 
what it is like. And I guarantee you— 
when she said that statement, ‘‘I don’t 
ask anything from my brother other 
than to get your foot off my neck,’’ I 
guarantee you, she knew what that was 
like, and that is why she says it with 
such conviction. 
That is what she represented. That is 
what she represented as an icon to so 
many people, and now they are mourn-
ing. I have had 2,000 calls in just a few 
days to our office about her passing. 
One constituent, Lynn from Shelton, 
WA, said: I am old enough to have 
grown up experiencing the subtle and 
not so subtle discrimination aimed at 
girls and women that have limited our 
self-expression, our participation in 
sports, in politics, college accessibility 
and workplace, and even in my family 
life and reproduction. She continues: It 
has been slow progress for each of us to 
achieve increased equality. And so we 
have so much to thank Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg for. I am deeply saddened and 
frightened—frightened by her passing. 
As you know, our democracies, free-
dom, integrity and the rule of law are 
threatened and are even at greater 
risk. 
Eileen, from Issaquah, wrote: Justice 
Ginsburg fought so valiantly for our 
rights as women. As women, we provide 
so much for the Washington economy. 
I agree with her. Women provide a lot 
for our economy in the State of Wash-
ington. 
She continues: I am a business owner 
myself, and I am terrified that gender 
protections are in grave danger. Ensur-
ing civil liberties is not just the moral

thing to do, but it makes sound eco-
nomic policy as well. Allowing more 
people more opportunities does not 
take away from those with power, but 
it grows our economy as a State and as 
a country and allows all of us to be 
more prosperous together. That in-
cludes reproductive rights, which is the 
keystone to allowing women full eco-
nomic opportunity as men. 
I have to say that letter basically 
sums it all up. That is what the fight 
with Lilly Ledbetter was. I thank Lilly 
Ledbetter. I thank Lilly Ledbetter for 
having the courage to file that case 
and stand up to that discrimination 
and basically fight a long process that 
people still don’t understand. We do 
not have pay equity in America yet. 
We still are not making the same 
amount as men. 
Ruth Ginsburg made a decision that 
set the course for the Lilly Ledbetter 
law, which basically says that instead 
of saying our time to file a case for dis-
crimination runs out after a year when 
we don’t even know we have been dis-
criminated against, we should have a 
longer period of time to file that case. 
All we are going to get is our day in 
court. 
I thank both Lilly Ledbetter and Jus-
tice Ginsburg for that because they 
were women standing up in an incred-
ible 
environment, 
with 
men 
sur-
rounding them, and speaking truth to 
power about what needed to happen, as 
my constituent says here, for full eco-
nomic opportunities for all people. 
I can’t tell you how many men I have 
heard say: I want equal pay for women. 
I want equal pay for women because I 
want my wife to make a decent salary. 
I want her to bring home as much as 
she can bring home. I don’t want her 
discriminated against. 
Yet when Justice Ginsburg set us up 
for the Lilly Ledbetter legislation and 
we came here to the Senate floor, I 
heard the most unbelievable speeches 
here on the Senate floor. Colleagues of 
ours basically said things like: Well, if 
you would just be as qualified as a 
man, we will pay you as much as a 
man. 
The disconnect still exists. The pay 
inequity still exists. But the course of 
action has been set by Justice Gins-
burg, and we just have to pick up the 
torch and carry this to the finish line 
because it is good for our economy. It 
is good for our society. It is good for 
women to have the type of participa-
tion that—when you are paid equally 
to a man, you can continue to con-
tribute in society. 
Already, 2,000 people have written to 
me. It is unbelievable what she has 
done to touch the hearts of Americans. 
A father from Bellingham wrote: 
Mostly, I mourn for the future of my 4- 
year-old daughter. The prospects of 
women losing their right to choose and 
an erosion of gender equality is fright-
ening. 
Another constituent, Katie, wrote: 
Even though the air this morning looks 
relatively clear again in Seattle—a lit-
tle reference to all our fire and 
smoke—our future is foggier than ever. 
While I mourn the death of Justice 
Ginsburg, I cannot help but feel tre-
mendous anxiety about the future of 
existing laws in effect that protect all 
people’s rights, from legal abortions to 
access to healthcare, to laws that pro-
tect our votes and our freedom of 
speech and laws that Justice Ginsburg 
protected. 
That is really what is going on here 
in America. This movement about RBG 
is saying: You stood up to protect us, 
and now you are gone, and what is 
going to happen? 
I definitely pause in this for a little 
comment about our Senate schedule. I 
don’t get it. We can sit here and argue 
back and forth about what people said 
when and how and all of that. What I 
don’t understand is this: It takes time 
to review the record of someone for a 
lifetime appointment to the Supreme 
Court in which these important issues 
to working families and whether they 
have as much power and as much clout 
and as much standing as a corporation 
in America—people want to know 
where they stand. 
Somehow, people are already talking 
about schedules. I don’t understand. 
How can you decide what the schedule 
is when you haven’t even heard the 
name of a person? How do you move 
forward with a schedule when you 
don’t even know—maybe this person is 
going to end up being Harriet Miers. 
Maybe you are going to look at their 
record and say: It is Harriet Miers, and 
I don’t want to move forward because I 
looked at her record, and I decided 
maybe this is not the jurist I want at 
this point in time. 
All I am saying is, I don’t understand 
how somebody can set a course of ac-
tion in a schedule when you don’t even 
know who the person is, what the proc-
ess is going to be, or the length of 
time. You are setting a horrible prece-
dent. You are saying to people that it 
doesn’t even matter what the name is; 
you already have a schedule. It doesn’t 
matter how long it is going to take to 
review. 
It is very hard here to not have frus-
tration when my citizens have fought 
so hard for these rights, and Justice 
Ginsburg’s passing has upset them so 
much that they need to hear from us 
about how a fair and deliberative proc-
ess—the last wishes of Justice Gins-
burg—is going to be honored. 
I would like to add in the RECORD the 
full dissent that was read from the 
bench from Justice Ginsburg in the 
Lilly Ledbetter case. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
SUPREME
COURT
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES, 
LILLY M. LEDBETTER, PETITIONER
V. THE 
GOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY, INC. 
ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES 
COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE ELEVENTH CIR-
CUIT—MAY 29, 2007 
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Ste-
vens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer 
join, dissenting. 
Lilly Ledbetter was a supervisor at Good-
year Tire and Rubber’s plant in Gadsden, 
Alabama, from 1979 until her retirement in 
1998. For most of those years, she worked as 
an area manager, a position largely occupied 
by men. Initially, Ledbetter’s salary was in 
line with the salaries of men performing sub-
stantially similar work. Over time, however, 
her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of 
male area managers with equal or less se-
niority. By the end of 1997, Ledbetter was the 
only woman working as an area manager and 
the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and 
her 
15 
male 
counterparts 
was 
stark: 
Ledbetter was paid $3,727 per month; the low-
est paid male area manager received $4,286 
per month, the highest paid, $5,236. See 421 F. 
3d 1169, 1174 (CAl 1 2005); Brief for Petitioner 
4. 
Ledbetter launched charges of discrimina-
tion before the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission (EEOC) in March 1998. 
Her formal administrative complaint speci-
fied that, in violation of Title VII, Goodyear 
paid her a discriminatorily low salary be-
cause of her sex. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–2(a)(1) 
(rendering it unlawful for an employer ‘‘to 
discriminate against any individual with re-
spect to [her] compensation . . . because of 
such individual’s . . . sex’’). That charge was 
eventually tried to a jury, which found it 
‘‘more likely than not that [Goodyear] paid 
[Ledbetter] a[n] unequal salary because of 
her sex.’’ App. 102. In accord with the jury’s 
liability determination, the District Court 
entered judgment for Ledbetter for backpay 
and damages, plus counsel fees and costs. 
The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Cir-
cuit reversed. Relying on Goodyear’s system 
of annual merit-based raises, the court held 
that Ledbetter’s claim, in relevant part, was 
time barred. 421 F. 3d, at 1171, 1182–1183. Title 
VII provides that a charge of discrimination 
‘‘shall be filed within [180] days after the al-
leged unlawful employment practice oc-
curred.’’ 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5(e)(1). Ledbetter 
charged, and proved at trial, that within the 
180-day period, her pay was substantially less 
than the pay of men doing the same work. 
Further, she introduced evidence sufficient 
to establish that discrimination against fe-
male managers at the Gadsden plant, not 
performance inadequacies on her part, ac-
counted for the pay differential. See, e.g., 
App. 36–47, 51–68, 82–87, 90–98, 112–113. That 
evidence was unavailing, the Eleventh Cir-
cuit held, and the Court today agrees, be-
cause it was incumbent on Ledbetter to file 
charges year-by-year, each time Goodyear 
failed to increase her salary commensurate 
with the salaries of male peers. Any annual 
pay decision not contested immediately 
(within 180 days), the Court affirms, becomes 
grandfathered, a fait accompli beyond the 
province of Title VII ever to repair. 
The Court’s insistence on immediate con-
test overlooks common characteristics of 
pay discrimination. Pay disparities often 
occur, as they did in Ledbetter’s case, in 
small increments; cause to suspect that dis-
crimination is at work develops only over 
time. Comparative pay information, more-
over, is often hidden from the employee’s 
view. Employers may keep under wraps the 
pay differentials maintained among super-
visors, no less the reasons for those differen-
tials. Small initial discrepancies may not be 
seen as meet for a federal case, particularly 
when the employee, trying to succeed in a 
nontraditional environment, is averse to 
making waves. 
Pay disparities are thus significantly dif-
ferent from adverse actions ‘‘such as termi-
nation, failure to promote, . . . or refusal to 
hire,’’ all involving fully communicated dis-
crete acts, ‘‘easy to identify’’ as discrimina-
tory. See National Railroad Passenger Cor-
poration v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 114 (2002). It

is only when the disparity becomes apparent 
and sizable, e.g., through future raises cal-
culated as a percentage of current salaries, 
that an employee in Ledbetter’s situation is 
likely to comprehend her plight and, there-
fore, to complain. Her initial readiness to 
give her employer the benefit of the doubt 
should not preclude her from later chal-
lenging the then current and continuing pay-
ment of a wage depressed on account of her 
sex. 
On questions of time under Title VII, we 
have identified as the critical inquiries: 
‘‘What constitutes an ‘unlawful employment 
practice’ and when has that practice ‘oc-
curred’?’’ Id., at 110. Our precedent suggests, 
and lower courts have overwhelmingly held, 
that the unlawful practice is the current 
payment of salaries infected by gender-based 
(or race-based) discrimination—a practice 
that occurs whenever a paycheck delivers 
less to a woman than to a similarly situated 
man. See Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U.S. 385, 395 
(1986) (Brennan, J., joined by all other Mem-
bers of the Court, concurring in part). 
I. 
Title VII proscribes as an ‘‘unlawful em-
ployment practice’’ discrimination ‘‘against 
any individual with respect to his compensa-
tion . . . because of such individual’s race, 
color, religion, sex, or national origin.’’ 42 
U.S.C. § 2000e–2(a)(1). An individual seeking 
to challenge an employment practice under 
this proscription must file a charge with the 
EEOC within 180 days ‘‘after the alleged un-
lawful 
employment 
practice 
occurred.’’ 
§ 2000e–5(e)(1). See ante, at 4; supra, at 2, n. 1. 
Ledbetter’s petition presents a question 
important to the sound application of Title 
VII: What activity qualifies as an unlawful 
employment practice in cases of discrimina-
tion with respect to compensation. One an-
swer identifies the pay-setting decision, and 
that decision alone, as the unlawful practice. 
Under this view, each particular salary-set-
ting decision is discrete from prior and sub-
sequent decisions, and must be challenged 
within 180 days on pain of forfeiture. An-
other response counts both the pay-setting 
decision and the actual payment of a dis-
criminatory wage as unlawful practices. 
Under this approach, each payment of a wage 
or salary infected by sex-based discrimina-
tion constitutes an unlawful employment 
practice; prior decisions, outside the 180–day 
charge-filing period, are not themselves ac-
tionable, but they are relevant in deter-
mining the lawfulness of conduct within the 
period. The Court adopts the first view, see 
ante, at 1, 4, 9, but the second is more faith-
ful to precedent, more in tune with the reali-
ties of the workplace, and more respectful of 
Title VII’ s remedial purpose. 
A 
In Bazemore, we unanimously held that an 
employer, the North Carolina Agricultural 
Extension Service, committed an unlawful 
employment practice each time it paid black 
employees less than similarly situated white 
employees. 478 U.S., at 395 (opinion of Bren-
nan, J.). Before 1965, the Extension Service 
was divided into two branches: a white 
branch and a ‘‘Negro branch.’’ Id., at 390. 
Employees in the ‘‘Negro branch’’ were paid 
less than their white counterparts. In re-
sponse to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which 
included Title VII, the State merged the two 
branches into a single organization, made 
adjustments to reduce the salary disparity, 
and began giving annual raises based on non-
discriminatory factors. Id., at 390–391, 394– 
395. Nonetheless, ‘‘some preexisting salary 
disparities continued to linger on.’’ Id., at 
394 (internal quotation marks omitted). We 
rejected the Court of Appeals’ conclusion 
that the plaintiffs could not prevail because 
the lingering disparities were simply a con-
tinuing effect of a decision lawfully made 
prior to the effective date of Title VII. See 
Id., at 395–396. Rather, we reasoned, ‘‘[e]ach 
week’s paycheck that delivers less to a black 
than to a similarly situated white is a wrong 
actionable under Title VII.’’ Id., at 395. Pay-
checks perpetuating past discrimination, we 
thus recognized, are actionable not simply 
because they are ‘‘related’’ to a decision 
made outside the charge-filing period, cf. 
ante, at 17, but because they discriminate 
anew each time they issue, see Bazemore, 478 
U.S., at 395–396, and n. 6; Morgan, 536 U.S., at 
111–112. 
Subsequently, in Morgan, we set apart, for 
purposes of Title VII’s timely filing require-
ment, unlawful employment actions of two 
kinds: ‘‘discrete acts’’ that are ‘‘easy to iden-
tify’’ as discriminatory, and acts that recur 
and are cumulative in impact. See Id., at 110, 
113–115. ‘‘[A] [d]iscrete ac[t] such as termi-
nation, failure to promote, denial of transfer, 
or refusal to hire,’’ Id., at 114, we explained, 
‘‘ ‘occur[s]’ on the day that it ‘happen[s].’ A 
party, therefore, must file a charge within 
. . . 180 . . . days of the date of the act or 
lose the ability to recover for it.’’ Id., at 110; 
see Id., at 113 (‘‘[D]iscrete discriminatory 
acts are not actionable if time barred, even 
when they are related to acts alleged in 
timely filed charges. Each discrete discrimi-
natory act starts a new clock for filing 
charges alleging that act.’’). 
‘‘[D]ifferent in kind from discrete acts,’’ we 
made clear, are ‘‘claims . . . based on the cu-
mulative effect of individual acts.’’ Id., at 
115. The Morgan decision placed hostile work 
environment claims in that category. ‘‘Their 
very nature involves repeated conduct.’’ Ibid. 
‘‘The unlawful employment practice’’ in hos-
tile work environment claims, ‘‘cannot be 
said to occur on any particular day. It occurs 
over a series of days or perhaps years and, in 
direct contrast to discrete acts, a single act 
of harassment may not be actionable on its 
own.’’ Ibid. (internal quotation marks omit-
ted). The persistence of the discriminatory 
conduct both indicates that management 
should have known of its existence and pro-
duces a cognizable harm. Ibid. Because the 
very nature of the hostile work environment 
claim involves repeated conduct, 
‘‘[i]t does not matter, for purposes of the 
statute, that some of the component acts of 
the hostile work environment fall outside 
the statutory time period. Provided that an 
act contributing to the claim occurs within 
the filing period, the entire time period of 
the hostile environment may be considered 
by a court for the purposes of determining li-
ability.’’ Id., at 117. 
Consequently, although the unlawful con-
duct began in the past, ‘‘a charge may be 
filed at a later date and still encompass the 
whole.’’ Ibid. 
Pay disparities, of the kind Ledbetter ex-
perienced, have a closer kinship to hostile 
work environment claims than to charges of 
a 
single 
episode 
of 
discrimination. 
Ledbetter’s 
claim, 
resembling 
Morgan’s, 
rested not on one particular paycheck, but 
on ‘‘the cumulative effect of individual 
acts.’’ See id., at 115. See also Brief for Peti-
tioner 13, 15–17, and n. 9 (analogizing 
Ledbetter’s claim to the recurring and cumu-
lative harm at issue in Morgan); Reply Brief 
for Petitioner 13 (distinguishing pay dis-
crimination from ‘‘easy to identify’’ discrete 
acts (internal quotation marks omitted)). 
She charged insidious discrimination build-
ing up slowly but steadily. See Brief for Peti-
tioner 5–8. Initially in line with the salaries 
of men performing substantially the same 
work, Ledbetter’s salary fell 15 to 40 percent 
behind her male counterparts only after suc-
cessive evaluations and percentage-based 
pay adjustments. See supra, at 1–2. Over 
time, she alleged and proved, the repetition 
of pay decisions undervaluing her work gave 
rise to the current discrimination of which 
she complained. Though component acts fell 
outside the charge-filing period, with each 
new paycheck, Goodyear contributed incre-
mentally to the accumulating harm. See 
Morgan, 536 U.S., at 117; Bazemore, 478 U.S., 
at 395–396; cf. Hanover Shoe, Inc. v. United 
Shoe Machinery Corp., 392 U.S. 481, n. 15 
(1968). 
B 
The realities of the workplace reveal why 
the discrimination with respect to com-
pensation that Ledbetter suffered does not 
fit within the category of singular discrete 
acts ‘‘easy to identify.’’ A worker knows im-
mediately if she is denied a promotion or 
transfer, if she is fired or refused employ-
ment. And promotions, transfers, hirings, 
and firings are generally public events, 
known to co-workers. When an employer 
makes a decision of such open and definitive 
character, an employee can immediately 
seek out an explanation and evaluate it for 
pretext. Compensation disparities, in con-
trast, are often hidden from sight. It is not 
unusual, decisions in point illustrate, for 
management to decline to publish employee 
pay levels, or for employees to keep private 
their own salaries. See, e.g., Goodwin v. Gen-
eral Motors Corp., 275 F. 3d 1005, 1008–1009 
(CA10 2002) (plaintiff did not know what her 
colleagues earned until a printout listing of 
salaries appeared on her desk, seven years 
after her starting salary was set lower than 
her co-workers’ salaries); McMillan v. Massa-
chusetts Soc. for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals, 140 F. 3d 288, 296 (CA1 1998) (plaintiff 
worked for employer for years before learn-
ing of salary disparity published in a news-
paper). Tellingly, as the record in this case 
bears out, Goodyear kept salaries confiden-
tial; employees had only limited access to 
information regarding their colleagues’ earn-
ings. App. 56–57, 89. 
The problem of concealed pay discrimina-
tion is particularly acute where the dis-
parity arises not because the female em-
ployee is flatly denied a raise but because 
male counterparts are given larger raises. 
Having received a pay increase, the female 
employee is unlikely to discern at once that 
she has experienced an adverse employment 
decision. She may have little reason even to 
suspect discrimination until a pattern devel-
ops incrementally and she ultimately be-
comes aware of the disparity. Even if an em-
ployee suspects that the reason for a com-
paratively low raise is not performance but 
sex (or another protected ground), the 
amount involved may seem too small, or the 
employer’s intent too ambiguous, to make 
the issue immediately actionable—or win-
nable. 
Further separating pay claims from the 
discrete employment actions identified in 
Morgan, an employer gains from sex-based 
pay disparities in a way it does not from a 
discriminatory denial of promotion, hiring, 
or transfer. When a male employee is se-
lected over a female for a higher level posi-
tion, someone still gets the promotion and is 
paid a higher salary; the employer is not en-
riched. But when a woman is paid less than 
a similarly situated man, the employer re-
duces its costs each time the pay differential 
is implemented. Furthermore, decisions on 
promotions, like decisions installing senior-
ity systems, often implicate the interests of 
third-party employees in a way that pay dif-
ferentials do not. Cf. Teamsters v. United 
States, 431 U.S. 324, 352–353 (1977) (recognizing 
that seniority systems involve ‘‘vested . . . 
rights of employees’’ and concluding that 
Title VII was not intended to ‘‘destroy or 
water down’’ those rights). Disparate pay, by 
contrast, can be remedied at any time solely 
at the expense of the employer who acts in a 
discriminatory fashion.

S5778 
September 22, 2020 
C 
In light of the significant differences be-
tween pay disparities and discrete employ-
ment decisions of the type identified in Mor-
gan, the cases on which the Court relies hold 
no sway. See ante, at 5–10 (discussing United 
Air Lines. Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553 (1977), 
Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250 
(1980), and Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, 
Inc., 490 U.S. 900 (1989)). Evans and Ricks both 
involved a single, immediately identifiable 
act of discrimination: in Evans, a construc-
tive discharge, 431 U.S., at 554; in Ricks, a de-
nial of tenure, 449 U.S., at 252. In each case, 
the employee filed charges well after the dis-
crete discriminatory act occurred: When 
United Airlines forced Evans to resign be-
cause of its policy barring married female 
flight attendants, she filed no charge; only 
four years later, when Evans was rehired, did 
she allege that the airline’s former no-mar-
riage rule was unlawful and therefore should 
not operate to deny her seniority credit for 
her prior service. See Evans, 431 U.S., at 554– 
557. Similarly, when Delaware State College 
denied Ricks tenure, he did not object until 
his terminal contract came to an end, one 
year later. Ricks, 449 U.S., at 253–254, 257–258. 
No repetitive, cumulative discriminatory 
employment practice was at issue in either 
case. See Evans, 431 U.S., at 557–558; Ricks, 449 
U.S., at 258. 
Lorance is also inapposite, for, in this 
Court’s view, it too involved a one-time dis-
crete act: the adoption of a new seniority 
system that ‘‘had its genesis in sex discrimi-
nation.’’ See 490 U.S., at 902, 905 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). The Court’s ex-
tensive reliance on Lorance, ante, at 7–9, 14, 
17–18, moreover, is perplexing for that deci-
sion is no longer effective: In the 1991 Civil 
Rights Act, Congress superseded Lorance’s 
holding. 112, 105 Stat. 1079 (codified as 
amended at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–5(e)(2)). Repudi-
ating our judgment that a facially neutral 
seniority system adopted with discrimina-
tory intent must be challenged immediately, 
Congress provided: 
‘‘For purposes of this section, an unlawful 
employment practice occurs . . . when the 
seniority system is adopted, when an indi-
vidual becomes subject to the seniority sys-
tem, or when a person aggrieved is injured 
by the application of the seniority system or 
provision of the system.’’ Ibid. 
Congress thus agreed with the dissenters in 
Lorance that ‘‘the harsh reality of [that] de-
cision,’’ was ‘‘glaringly at odds with the pur-
poses of Title VII.’’ 490 U.S., at 914 (opinion 
of Marshall, J.). See also § 3, 105 Stat. 1071 
(1991 Civil Rights Act was designed ‘‘to re-
spond to recent decisions of the Supreme 
Court by expanding the scope of relevant 
civil rights statutes in order to provide ade-
quate protection to victims of discrimina-
tion’’). 
True, § 112 of the 1991 Civil Rights Act di-
rectly addressed only seniority systems. See 
ante, at 8, and n. 2. But Congress made clear 
(1) its view that this Court had unduly con-
tracted the scope of protection afforded by 
Title VII and other civil rights statutes, and 
(2) its aim to generalize the ruling in 
Bazemore. As the Senate Report accom-
panying the proposed Civil Rights Act of 
1990, the precursor to the 1991 Act, explained: 
‘‘Where, as was alleged in Lorance, an em-
ployer adopts a rule or decision with an un-
lawful discriminatory motive, each applica-
tion of that rule or decision is a new viola-
tion of the law. In Bazemore . . . , for exam-
ple, . . . the Supreme Court properly held 
that each application of th[e] racially moti-
vated salary structure, i.e., each new pay-
check, constituted a distinct violation of 
Title VII. Section 7(a)(2) generalizes the re-
sult correctly reached in Bazemore.’’ Civil 
Rights Act of 1990, S. Rep. No. 101–315, p. 54 
(1990). 
See also 137 Cong. Rec. 29046, 29047 (1991) 
(Sponsors’ 
Interpretative 
Memorandum) 
(‘‘This legislation should be interpreted as 
disapproving the extension of [Lorance] to 
contexts outside of seniority systems.’’), But 
cf. ante, at 18 (relying on Lorance to conclude 
that ‘‘when an employer issues paychecks 
pursuant to a system that is facially non-
discriminatory and neutrally applied’’ a new 
Title VII violation does not occur (internal 
quotation marks omitted)). 
Until today, in the more than 15 years 
since Congress amended Title VII, the Court 
had not once relied upon Lorance. It is mis-
taken to do so now. Just as Congress’ ‘‘goals 
in enacting Title VII . . . never included con-
ferring absolute immunity on discriminator-
ily adopted seniority systems that survive 
their first [180] days,’’ 490 U.S., at 914 (Mar-
shall, J., dissenting), Congress never in-
tended to immunize forever discriminatory 
pay differentials unchallenged within 180 
days of their adoption. This assessment 
gains weight when one comprehends that 
even a relatively minor pay disparity will 
expand exponentially over an employee’s 
working life if raises are set as a percentage 
of prior pay. 
A clue to congressional intent can be found 
in Title VII’s backpay provision. The statute 
expressly provides that backpay may be 
awarded for a period of up to two years be-
fore the discrimination charge is filed. 42 
U.S.C. § 2000e–5(g)(l) (‘‘Back pay liability 
shall not accrue from a date more than two 
years prior to the filing of a charge with the 
Commission.’’). This prescription indicates 
that Congress contemplated challenges to 
pay discrimination commencing before, but 
continuing into, the 180-day filing period. 
See Morgan, 536 U.S., at 119 (‘‘If Congress in-
tended to limit liability to conduct occur-
ring in the period within which the party 
must file the charge, it seems unlikely that 
Congress would have allowed recovery for 
two years of backpay.’’). As we recognized in 
Morgan, ‘‘the fact that Congress expressly 
limited the amount of recoverable damages 
elsewhere to a particular time period [i.e., 
two years] indicates that the [180–day] time-
ly filing provision was not meant to serve as 
a specific limitation . . . [on] the conduct 
that may be considered.’’ Ibid. 
D 
In tune with the realities of wage discrimi-
nation, the Courts of Appeals have over-
whelmingly judged as a present violation the 
payment of wages infected by discrimina-
tion: Each paycheck less than the amount 
payable had the employer adhered to a non-
discriminatory compensation regime, courts 
have held, constitutes a cognizable harm. 
See, e.g., Forsyth v. Federation Employment 
and Guidance Serv., 409 F. 3d 565, 573 (CA2 
2005) (‘‘Any paycheck given within the 
[charge-filing] period . . . would be action-
able, even if based on a discriminatory pay 
scale set up outside of the statutory pe-
riod.’’); Shea v. Rice, 409 F. 3d 448, 452—453 
(CADC 2005) (‘‘[An] employer commit[s] a 
separate unlawful employment practice each 
time he pa[ys] one employee less than an-
other for a discriminatory reason’’ (citing 
Bazemore, 478 U.S., at 396)); Goodwin v. Gen-
eral Motors Corp., 275 F. 3d 1005, 1009–1010 
(CA10 2002) (‘‘[Bazemore] has taught a crucial 
distinction with respect to discriminatory 
disparities in pay, establishing that a dis-
criminatory salary is not merely a lingering 
effect of past discrimination instead it is 
itself a continually recurring violation . . . . 
[E]ach race-based discriminatory salary pay-
ment constitutes a fresh violation of Title 
VII.’’ 
(footnote 
omitted)); 
Anderson 
v. 
Zubieta, 180 F. 3d 329, 335 (CADC 1999) (‘‘The 
Courts of Appeals have repeatedly reached 
the . . . conclusion’’ that pay discrimination 
is ‘‘actionable upon receipt of each pay-
check.’’); accord Hildebrandt v. Illinois Dept. 
of Natural Resources, 347 F. 3d 1014, 1025–1029 
(CA7 2003); Cardenas v. Massey, 269 F. 3d 251, 
257 (CA3 2001); Ashley v. Boyle’s Famous 
Corned Beef Co., 66 F. 3d 164, 167–168 (CA8

v. Pierce County Law Enforcement Support 
Agency, 785 F. 2d 1396, 1399–1400 (CA9 1986). 
Similarly in line with the real-world char-
acteristics 
of 
pay 
discrimination, 
the 
EEOC—the federal agency responsible for en-
forcing Title VII, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e– 
5(f)—has interpreted the Act to permit em-
ployees to challenge disparate pay each time 
it is received. The EEOC’s Compliance Man-
ual provides that ‘‘repeated occurrences of 
the same discriminatory employment action, 
such as discriminatory paychecks, can be 
challenged as long as one discriminatory act 
occurred within the charge filing period.’’ 2 
EEOC Compliance Manual § 2–IV–C(1)(a), p. 
605:0024, and n. 183 (2006); cf. id., § 10–III, p. 
633:0002 (Title VII requires an employer to 
eliminate pay disparities attributable to a 
discriminatory system, even if that system 
has been discontinued). 
The EEOC has given effect to its interpre-
tation in a series of administrative decisions. 
See Albritton v. Potter, No. 01A44063, 2004 WL 
2983682, *2 (EEOC Office of Fed. Operations, 
Dec. 17, 2004) (although disparity arose and 
employee became aware of the disparity out-
side the charge-filing period, claim was not 
time barred because ‘‘[e]ach paycheck that 
complainant receives which is less than that 
of similarly situated employees outside of 
her protected classes could support a claim 
under Title VII if discrimination is found to 
be the reason for the pay discrepancy.’’ (cit-
ing Bazemore, 478 U.S., at 396)). See also 
Bynum-Doles v. Winter, No. 01A53973, 2006 WL 
2096290 (EEOC Office of Fed. Operations, July 
18, 2006); Ward v. Potter, No. 01A60047, 2006 WL 
721992 (EEOC Office of Fed. Operations, Mar. 
10, 2006). And in this very case, the EEOC 
urged the Eleventh Circuit to recognize that 
Ledbetter’s failure to challenge any par-
ticular pay-setting decision when that deci-
sion was made ‘‘does not deprive her of the 
right to seek relief for discriminatory pay-
checks she received in 1997 and 1998.’’ Brief of 
EEOC in Support of Petition for Rehearing 
and Suggestion for Rehearing En Banc, in 
No. 03–15264–GG (CA11), p. 14 (hereinafter 
EEOC Brief) (citing Morgan, 536 U.S., at 113). 
II 
The Court asserts that treating pay dis-
crimination as a discrete act, limited to each 
particular paysetting decision, is necessary 
to ‘‘protec[t] employers from the burden of 
defending claims arising from employment 
decisions that are long past.’’ Ante, at 11 
(quoting Ricks, 449 U.S., at 256–257). But the 
discrimination of which Ledbetter com-
plained is not long past. As she alleged, and 
as the jury found, Goodyear continued to 
treat Ledbetter differently because of sex 
each pay period, with mounting harm. Al-
lowing employees to challenge discrimina-
tion ‘‘that extend[s] over long periods of 
time,’’ into the charge-filing period, we have 
previously explained, ‘‘does not leave em-
ployers defenseless’’ against unreasonable or 
prejudicial delay. Morgan, 536 U.S., at 121. 
Employers disadvantaged by such delay may 
raise various defenses. Id., at 122. Doctrines 
such as ‘‘waiver, estoppel, and equitable toll-
ing’’ ‘‘allow us to honor Title VII’s remedial 
purpose without negating the particular pur-
pose of the filing requirement, to give 
prompt notice to the employer.’’ Id., at 121 
(quoting Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 
455 U.S. 385, 398 (1982)); see 536 U.S., at 121 
(defense of laches may be invoked to block 
an employee’s suit ‘‘if he unreasonably 
delays in filing [charges] and as a result 
harms the defendant’’); EEOC Brief 15 (‘‘[I]f

Ledbetter unreasonably delayed challenging 
an earlier decision, and that delay signifi-
cantly impaired Goodyear’s ability to defend 
itself . . . Goodyear can raise a defense of 
laches . . . .’’). 
In a last-ditch argument, the Court asserts 
that this dissent would allow a plaintiff to 
sue on a single decision made 20 years ago 
‘‘even if the employee had full knowledge of 
all the circumstances relating to the . . . de-
cision at the time it was made.’’ Ante, at 20. 
It suffices to point out that the defenses just 
noted would make such a suit foolhardy. No 
sensible judge would tolerate such inexcus-
able neglect. See Morgan, 536 U.S., at 121 (‘‘In 
such cases, the federal courts have the dis-
cretionary power . . . to locate a just result 
in light of the circumstances peculiar to the 
case.’’ (internal quotation marks omitted)). 
Ledbetter, the Court observes, ante, at 21, 
n. 9, dropped an alternative remedy she could 
have pursued: Had she persisted in pressing 
her claim under the Equal Pay Act of 1963 
(EPA), 29 U.S.C. § 206(d), she would not have 
encountered a time bar. See ante, at 21 (‘‘If 
Ledbetter had pursued her EPA claim, she 
would not face the Title VII obstacles that 
she now confronts.’’); cf. Corning Glass Works 
v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 208–210 (1974). Nota-
bly, the EPA provides no relief when the pay 
discrimination charged is based on race, reli-
gion, national origin, age, or disability. 
Thus, in truncating the Title VII rule this 
Court announced in Bazemore, the Court does 
not disarm female workers from achieving 
redress for unequal pay, but it does impede 
racial and other minorities from gaining 
similar relief. 
Furthermore, the difference between the 
EPA’s prohibition against paying unequal 
wages and Title VII’s ban on discrimination 
with regard to compensation is not as large 
as the Court’s opinion might suggest. See 
ante, at 21. The key distinction is that Title 
VII requires a showing of intent. In practical 
effect, ‘‘if the trier of fact is in equipoise 
about whether the wage differential is moti-
vated by gender discrimination,’’ Title VII 
compels a verdict for the employer, while 
the EPA compels a verdict for the plaintiff. 
2 C. Sullivan, M. Zimmer, & R. White, Em-
ployment Discrimination: Law and Practice 
§ 7.08[F][3], p. 532 (3d ed. 2002). In this case, 
Ledbetter carried the burden of persuading 
the jury that the pay disparity she suffered 
was attributable to intentional sex discrimi-
nation. See supra, at 1–2; infra, this page and 
18. 
III 
To show how far the Court has strayed 
from interpretation of Title VII with fidelity 
to the Act’s core purpose, I return to the evi-
dence Ledbetter presented at trial. Ledbetter 
proved to the jury the following: She was a 
member of a protected class; she performed 
work substantially equal to work of the 
dominant class (men); she was compensated 
less for that work; and the disparity was at-
tributable to gender-based discrimination. 
See supra, at 1–2. 
Specifically, Ledbetter’s evidence dem-
onstrated 
that 
her 
current 
pay 
was 
discriminatorily low due to a long series of 
decisions reflecting Goodyear’s pervasive 
discrimination against women managers in 
general 
and 
Ledbetter 
in 
particular. 
Ledbetter’s former supervisor, for example, 
admitted to the jury that Ledbetter’s pay, 
during a particular one-year period, fell 
below Goodyear’s minimum threshold for her 
position. App. 93–97. Although Goodyear 
claimed the pay disparity was due to poor 
performance, the supervisor acknowledged 
that Ledbetter received a ‘‘Top Performance 
Award’’ in 1996. Id., at 90–93. The jury also 
heard testimony that another supervisor— 
who evaluated Ledbetter in 1997 and whose 
evaluation led to her most recent raise de-
nial—was openly biased against women. Id., 
at 46, 77–82. And two women who had pre-
viously worked as managers at the plant told 
the jury they had been subject to pervasive 
discrimination and were paid less than their 
male counterparts. One was paid less than 
the men she supervised. Id., at 51–68. 
Ledbetter herself testified about the dis-
criminatory animus conveyed to her by 
plant officials. Toward the end of her career, 
for 
instance, 
the 
plant 
manager 
told 
Ledbetter that the ‘‘plant did not need 
women, that [women] didn’t help it, [and] 
caused problems.’’ Id., at 36. After weighing 
all 
the 
evidence, 
the 
jury 
found 
for 
Ledbetter, concluding that the pay disparity 
was due to intentional discrimination. 
Yet, under the Court’s decision, the dis-
crimination Ledbetter proved is not redress-
able under Title VII. Each and every pay de-
cision she did not immediately challenge 
wiped the slate clean. Consideration may not 
be given to the cumulative effect of a series 
of decisions that, together, set her pay well 
below that of every male area manager. 
Knowingly carrying past pay discrimination 
forward must be treated as lawful conduct. 
Ledbetter may not be compensated for the 
lower pay she was in fact receiving when she 
complained to the EEOC. Nor, were she still 
employed by Goodyear, could she gain, on 
the proof she presented at trial, injunctive 
relief requiring, prospectively, her receipt of 
the same compensation men receive for sub-
stantially similar work. The Court’s appro-
bation of these consequences is totally at 
odds with the robust protection against 
workplace discrimination Congress intended 
Title VII to secure. See, e.g., Teamsters v. 
United States, 431 U.S., at 348 (‘‘The primary 
purpose of Title VII was to assure equality of 
employment opportunities and to eliminate 
. . . 
discriminatory 
practices 
and 
de-
vices. . . .’’ (internal quotation marks omit-
ted)); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 
405, 418 (1975) (‘‘It is . . . the purpose of Title 
VII to make persons whole for injuries suf-
fered on account of unlawful employment 
discrimination.’’). 
This is not the first time the Court has or-
dered a cramped interpretation of Title VII, 
incompatible with the statute’s broad reme-
dial purpose. See supra, at 10–12. See also 
Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 
(1989) (superseded in part by the Civil Rights 
Act of 1991); Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 
U.S. 228 (1989) (plurality opinion) (same); 1 B. 
Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment 
Discrimination Law 2 (3d ed. 1996) (‘‘A spate 
of Court decisions in the late 1980s drew con-
gressional fire and resulted in demands for 
legislative change[,]’’ culminating in the 1991 
Civil Rights Act (footnote omitted)). Once 
again, the ball is in Congress’ court. As in 
1991, the Legislature may act to correct this 
Court’s parsimonious reading of Title VII. 
* * * 
For the reasons stated, I would hold that 
Ledbetter’s claim is not time barred and 
would reverse the Eleventh Circuit’s judg-
ment. 
Ms. CANTWELL. In that dissent, 
Justice Ginsburg said: 
The problem of concealed pay discrimina-
tion is particularly acute where the dis-
parity arises not because the female em-
ployee is flatly denied a raise but because 
male counterparts are given larger raises. 
Having received a pay increase, the female 
employee is unlikely to discern at once that 
she has experienced an adverse employment 
decision. She may have little reason to sus-
pect discrimination until a pattern develops 
incrementally and she ultimately becomes 
aware of the disparity. 
Again, I think of what bravery Jus-
tice Ginsburg showed in saying to our 
colleagues that this dissent was so im-
portant, to read it from the bench. 
Not everything in the legislative or 
legal process is easy. It takes bringing 
awareness to our colleagues, and clear-
ly there is a lot of awareness that 
needs to continue to happen here. This 
is about working families and their de-
sire to have healthcare coverage for 
preexisting conditions, protection of 
reproductive rights, hundreds of thou-
sands of Dreamers wanting to know 
what the future looks like, and obvi-
ously LGBTQ rights and whether they 
are going to be set back. 
I think of the other time that I had 
a great interaction with Justice Gins-
burg. When I also first got here, we had 
this dinner every year. The Senator 
from Hawaii will find this interesting. 
We in the Senate would be invited— 
Democrats and Republicans—to have 
dinner with the Supreme Court. It was 
a great night. We would go over to the 
Court, and we would have dinner. 
Actually, the Justices would open up 
their offices, and we could tour around. 
I thought it was really interesting. If 
you know anything about people, you 
can almost see how their mind works 
by the desk they keep. Some people 
keep a messy desk, but they know 
where every piece of paper is on the 
desk. Other people have a very neat 
desk. 
The whole thing—letting us into 
their Chambers, talking about the de-
corum of the Supreme Court, how they 
shook hands every day, how they all 
worked with each other to try to keep 
comity among the decisions when you 
are going to disagree every day—was 
very interesting. 
We usually had some entertainment. 
But it was kind of a moment where we 
all said: We are in this together, and 
we are going to keep moving forward. 
Several years later—I am not sure 
whose decision it was—I think maybe 
around—I am not sure what year they 
disbanded that. They decided: We are 
not doing that anymore. 
I asked: Why aren’t we doing this? 
This is one of the greatest things we 
have done around here because Demo-
crats and Republicans would get to-
gether with the members of the Court 
and other people relevant to our asso-
ciations, and we would share a meal 
and talk and say that this was about 
civility and working together—obvi-
ously a very divided branch as it re-
lates to the Senate and the judiciary. 
But nonetheless I so appreciated the 
fact that even though that was dis-
banded, Justice Ginsburg invited the 
women for dinner. She invited the 
women Senators to come over for din-
ner. I think we might have invited a 
few of our ex-colleagues. I think Olym-
pia Snowe, the former Congresswoman 
from Maine, might have been there. So 
we invited some of our old colleagues. 
It might have been a dinner for a newly 
added Justice to the Court. Nonethe-
less, guess what we got with dinner. 
Great opera. Great opera. In fact, she 
had I think two singers there that 
evening and entertained us.

It is that kind of spirit of people 
working together and showing that. I 
think that was probably what her rela-
tionship was with Antonin Scalia. It 
was probably, yes, we are not always 
going to agree, but we are going to 
work together, and we are going to fig-
ure out how to make the best of this 
situation and move forward. 
I remember that. Even though this 
thing had been disbanded, she still 
took the time—at least with the 
women—to say: Do you know what? We 
can all still work together. 
Whoever said the statement ‘‘Good 
things come in small packages’’ had it 
down when it came to Justice Ginsburg 
because in that very small package 
came a lot of wisdom that got applied 
to the rights particularly of women in 
the United States of America with a 
calm but forceful voice that has moved 
this ball down the road. It is up to all 
of us to continue her legacy and get 
equal pay for equal work and continue 
to protect these rights that are well es-
tablished in the United States of Amer-
ica. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
the Ginsburg family. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HOEVEN). The Senator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, we know 
that on Saturday the President is like-
ly to announce his nominee for the Su-
preme Court, and we don’t know who 
that is going to be, but we do know a 
couple of things. We know, according 
to the chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, that they already have the 
votes. 
What an extraordinary thing to al-
ready know how you are going to vote 
on a nominee who has not yet been 
nominated. 
What 
an 
extraordinary 
thing to turn ‘‘advise and consent’’ 
into ‘‘agreeing in advance.’’ What an 
extraordinary thing. 
There is another thing that we know 
about this nominee. No matter who it 
is, we know that this person is going to 
come from a list provided by the Fed-
eralist Society, an organization that 
has worked for decades to remake the 
Federal judiciary in its image. It has a 
long history of advancing a certain 
agenda of seeking to roll back progress 
on civil rights, diminish environmental 
protections, and eliminate a woman’s 
right to choose. It is an organization 
that believes in the power of executive 
authority and advances a particular, 
unique, novel theory called the unitary 
executive, which is something that 
Alan Dershowitz proffered on the Sen-
ate floor during the impeachment trial. 
It essentially says that the executive 
branch is the President and that exten-
sions of the President’s authority can 
only go so far because the President is 
a whole branch of government unto 
himself or herself. The Federalist Soci-
ety also fights for the corporations and 
the rich individual donors who quietly 
fund their work. 
As Amanda Hollis-Brusky says, who 
studies this organization from a non-
partisan academic perspective as a pro-
fessor at Pomona College: ‘‘The idea of 
the Federalist Society was to train, 
credential, and socialize a generation 
of alternative elites.’’ 
That is how we know that any nomi-
nee they put forth will have views so 
far out of the mainstream and far to 
the right of even the existing Supreme 
Court. So it is not a rhetorical flourish, 
and it is not a partisan statement to 
say that Trump’s nominee will not be 
committed to ensuring our most basic 
and fundamental rights: the right to 
privacy, reproductive rights, the right 
to vote, the right to marry who you 
love, and even equal justice under the 
law. 
Perhaps what is most worrisome is 
that the President has made clear that 
whomever he nominates to the Su-
preme Court will be in favor of striking 
down the Affordable Care Act. With the 
Court’s hearing yet another challenge 
to the ACA on November 10, it is not an 
exaggeration to say that the law will 
likely be gutted. It is a real risk. 
Let’s be clear about what this means. 
The 
whole 
architecture 
of 
our 
healthcare system could be destroyed 
during the worst public health crisis in 
a century. This will, of course, dis-
proportionately impact our most vul-
nerable communities—communities of 
color, low-income, indigenous, Alaska 
Native, and Native Hawaiian commu-
nities. We are talking about repealing 
Medicaid expansion—the policy that 
allows people under the age of 26 to 
stay on their parents’ health insur-
ance—and, most importantly, protec-
tions for preexisting conditions. 
Let’s be clear about this, too: If you 
have gotten COVID, you now have a 
preexisting condition. So, if you have 
gotten COVID because of President 
Trump’s inaction and then if his nomi-
nee is confirmed to the Supreme Court, 
your insurance company will be per-
mitted 
to 
kick 
you 
off 
of 
your 
healthcare plan or at least to increase 
your rate so high that you will not be 
able to afford coverage. 
Ripping away healthcare from at 
least 20 million Americans and denying 
coverage to people with preexisting 
conditions is a crazy and horrific thing 
to do in normal times, but it is particu-
larly cruel during a pandemic that has 
already claimed the lives of more than 
200,000 Americans, especially because, 
despite the recent promises and despite 
the endless promises from both the 
President and members of the Repub-
lican Party, they have no alternative 
healthcare plan. We cannot and must 
not impose this catastrophe on the 
American people. 
In moments when our country feels 
torn apart, the traditional role of the 
Senate is supposed to be to calm ten-
sions and solve our problems, but in-
stead of dealing with the tough issues, 
the majority leader and the Republican 
Party are going to inflict procedural 
violence on the legislative branch with 
many 
Republicans 
pre-announcing 
their support for the nominee without 
even knowing who she or he may be. 
‘‘President Trump will nominate a 
well-qualified justice and we will up-
hold our Constitution and protect our 
freedoms’’—the Senator from Montana. 
‘‘I will support President Trump in 
any effort to move forward regarding 
the recent vacancy’’—the chairman of 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
‘‘It is critical that the Senate takes 
up and confirms that successor before 
election day’’—the junior Senator from 
Texas. 
What makes this coordinated effort 
to stack the Supreme Court even worse 
is that we heard the majority leader 
say specifically that he felt no sense of 
urgency to move on COVID relief. He 
felt no sense of urgency to move on 
COVID relief. I believe this was in May. 
I think it was in May when the House 
passed the Heroes Act. The House 
passes a bill, and the Republicans say 
it is too much. The majority leader de-
cides: Do you know what? We are the 
cooling saucer. We are the upper Cham-
ber. We are just going to chill out here 
during this pandemic and see how 
things play out economically and in 
terms of public health. 
Well, things have played out pretty 
badly economically and in terms of 
public health; yet there has been no 
sense of urgency, no deal, no negotia-
tion. Forget a deal for a second. There 
has not even been a serious attempt to 
negotiate between the parties or be-
tween the branches of government— 
nothing. 
Yet, when a Supreme Court vacancy 
happens—when Justice Ginsburg trag-
ically passes—there is a tremendous 
sense of clarity, a tremendous sense of 
alacrity, a determination to fill that 
seat so that, on November 10, they can 
take your healthcare away. That is the 
sense of urgency that the majority 
leader feels in the middle of a pan-
demic, and it is a shame. 
I yield the floor.

the following statement was ordered to

TRIBUTE TO ERICA SONGER 
∑ Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee Subcommittee on Intellectual 
Property, I want to thank Erica Songer 
for her service in the Senate and in 
particular for her service as the sub-
committee’s minority chief counsel. 
The 
Intellectual 
Property 
Sub-
committee has been the most active 
subcommittee’s in the Senate, in no 
small part due to Erica’s work. We 
have worked in a bipartisan fashion to 
modernize our intellectual property 
system through forward-looking legis-
lative reforms. Across numerous hear-
ings on various aspects of intellectual 
property law, as well as several bills, 
Erica has been a vital resource to my 
team and me. 
During this session, Erica has served 
the subcommittee in countless ways.

Nation’s patent eligibility laws, Erica 
has been an innovator and go-getter. 
There were countless times throughout 
this Congress when the subcommittee’s 
work would get tough and it appeared 
we were at an insurmountable impasse. 
Each time, Erica found a way forward 
and kept us moving towards our shared 
goals: a stronger intellectual property 
system. 
While I am sad that the Senate and 
the subcommittee will be losing a 
staffer as valuable as Erica, I am grate-
ful for her public service these past 4 
years. Erica has shown that she will 
excel at whatever she commits to, 
whether graduating from Harvard Law 
School or making partner at one of the 
largest law firms in the world or serv-
ing as the chief counsel to my good 
friend CHRIS COONS—and I am excited 
for her as she steps into a new role and 
begins a new adventure.∑

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans—DAV—organization for 
its commitment to serving wartime- 
disabled veterans since its formation 
100 years ago. As a member of the Sen-
ate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I 
am grateful for the positive impact of 
the DAV on disabled veterans in South 
Dakota and across the Nation. 
Founded on September 25, 1920, the 
DAV has grown to become the largest 
wartime veterans service organization 
in the United States, with more than 1 
million members in 1,344 chapters 
around the country. 
The DAV helps disabled veterans and 
their families work through the bu-
reaucracy of the Federal and local gov-
ernments to make sure they receive 
the benefits they deserve. Additionally, 
the organization operates a nationwide 
transportation network, providing free 
transportation for disabled veterans to 
Department of Veterans Affairs hos-
pitals and clinics. 
We are truly blessed to have the DAV 
organization in South Dakota and in 
the United States. They give their 
time, talent, knowledge, and friendship 
to disabled veterans who need it most. 
We are thankful for their 100 years of 
service to the veteran community. 
May God continue to bless the DAV 
and everyone they serve. 
Thank you.

REMEMBERING DR. ROLF H. 
EPPINGER 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary 
constituent, Dr. Rolf H. Eppinger, who 
passed away on August 14, 2020. Dr. 
Eppinger’s outstanding work has saved 
the lives of many Americans and will 
save many more in the years to come. 
Dr. Eppinger had a distinguished 34- 
year career with the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA. 
There, he performed and led funda-
mental biomechanics research that re-
sulted in the development of crash test 
dummies, the interpretation of their 
measurements, the advancement of the 
prevention of crash injuries, and the 
reduction of the severity of crash inju-
ries. 
His work has helped save hundreds of 
thousands of lives and many more inju-
ries worldwide. NHTSA has estimated 
that in the United States, as of 2017, 
more than 50,000 lives have been saved 
by airbags, 374,000 by safety belts, and 
11,000 by child restraints. Many times 
more serious injuries were prevented or 
ameliorated. 
The work of Dr. Eppinger and his 
team formed the basis for the New Car 
Assessment 
Programs 
now 
in 
use 
worldwide. 
Over the course of his career, Dr. 
Eppinger published more than 120 tech-
nical papers dealing with automotive 
safety and was the holder of two U.S. 
patents. In addition, he enjoyed sail-
boat racing and was an accomplished 
watercolorist, 
pen 
and 
ink 
artist, 
woodworker, boat builder, and general 
handyman. 
Dr. Eppinger is remembered for his 
rigorous scientific medical and engi-
neering research, integrity, decency, 
and humility. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
sending 
our 
gratitude 
for 
Dr. 
Eppinger’s outstanding contributions 
and our deepest condolences to his wife 
Karen, his children Justin and Dwight, 
his daughter-in-law Kelly, and his 
grandchildren Alice and Hugo.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO LILIANE COUCKE 
SMITH 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I rise to recognize Mrs. Liliane 
Coucke Smith, a remarkable woman 
who served as a nurse during World 
War II and turns 100 on October 3. 
Born in Belgium, Mrs. Smith joined 
the Belgian Resistance at age 20. As a 
wartime nurse, she entered Germany 
alongside the advancing Allied Forces. 
Her 
outstanding 
commitment 
to 
serving others continued afterward, 
when she worked as part of the United 
Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Ad-
ministration 
and 
the 
International 
Refugee Organization to help resettle 
over 10 million people displaced by the 
Second World War, including former 
slave laborers and concentration camp 
survivors. Mrs. Smith also oversaw the 
establishment of six refugee camps in 
the American occupation zone. 
While working as a French-English 
translator in Naples, she met her be-
loved husband, Dudley C. Smith, a U.S. 
Naval officer. The two split their time 
between Europe and the United States, 
before settling permanently in Groton 
Long Point, CT. 
Her tireless dedication to helping 
others in even the most arduous times 
is a credit to her generous spirit. A 
deeply 
considerate 
and 
unfailingly 
driven person, Mrs. Smith sets an in-
spiring model for all of us through her 
readiness to embrace new challenges 
and serve those in need. Her incredible 
legacy will be enduring. 
I applaud her many accomplishments 
and hope my colleagues will join me in 
congratulating 
Mrs. 
Liliane 
Couke 
Smith on this milestone of her 100th 
birthday.∑

TRIBUTE TO KRISTINA FOLCIK 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize Kristina Folcik of 
Tamworth 
as 
September’s 
Granite 
Stater of the Month. As a survivor of 
domestic 
violence, 
Kristina 
trans-
formed her own healing process into a 
way to support other survivors by hik-
ing 100 miles nonstop across some of 
New Hampshire’s steepest peaks. She 
was the first person to ever finish that 
portion of the Appalachian Trail in one 
single trek. 
Kristina is an endurance athlete who 
has 
held 
multiple 
Fastest 
Known 
Times, which is a title given to individ-
uals who have clocked the fastest time 
on a particular route, including hiking 
trails. She even raced professionally 
for a while, but stopped when her now- 
former husband started becoming abu-
sive after she would win a race. 
For the last 2 years, Kristina worked 
with Starting Point, a nonprofit orga-
nization in New Hampshire that helps 
survivors of domestic and sexual vio-
lence, to successfully separate from her 
abusive husband. In an effort to heal 
from this harrowing and traumatic ex-
perience, Kristina decided to attempt a 
100-mile, nonstop hike. 
In the lead-up to announcing her de-
cision to attempt this extraordinary 
feat, Kristina revealed publicly on so-
cial media that she had recently di-
vorced from her abusive husband and 
that she was going to complete this 
100-mile trek and dedicate it to women 
who have been in abusive relationships. 
Much to her surprise, following her 
announcement, many women began to 
share their stories of abuse with 
Kristina, 
and 
some 
even 
publicly 
shared their experiences.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

September 22, 2020 
Kristina turned her hike into a fund-
raiser, asking people to donate to the 
organization that had helped her leave 
her abusive marriage. It was not until 
Kristina had successfully completed 
the hike 36 hours later that she real-
ized the fundraiser had raised more 
than $1,000 for Starting Point. 
Apart 
from 
breaking 
records, 
Kristina also owns Rockhopper Races 
LLC, which hosts races in the White 
Mountains and raises money for orga-
nizations that maintain and preserve 
New Hampshire’s beautiful natural re-
sources. 
Kristina not only achieved an incred-
ible athletic feat, but also made a dif-
ference in the lives of others by having 
the courage to speak out about her 
past trauma. Kristina’s strength is an 
inspiration and reflects the kind of de-
termination to build strength through 
outreach and mutual support that the 
Granite State is known for. I am proud 
to recognize her efforts.∑

RECOGNIZING BECKWITH 
ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC. 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit at the heart of our coun-
try. It is my privilege to recognize a 
family-owned small business with an 
outstanding record of innovation and 
industry leadership. This week, it is 
my pleasure to honor Beckwith Elec-
tric Company, Inc., of Largo, FL, as 
the Senate Small Business of the Week. 
In 1967, Robert W. Beckwith estab-
lished Beckwith Electric in Illinois to 
provide equipment and services for 
electric utility providers. Robert, an 
electric engineer, was a prolific inven-
tor who held more than 30 patents dur-
ing his lifetime. Under his leadership, 
Beckwith Electric developed several 
products integral to electric utilities, 
including 
the 
first 
solid 
state 
tapchanger control in 1968 and micro-
processor protective relay in 1981. As 
the company grew, Robert relocated 
Beckwith Electric to Largo, FL, in 
1974. Like many Floridian small busi-
nesses, Beckwith Electric’s facilities 
were completely destroyed by Hurri-
cane Andrew in 1992. Through careful 
planning, innovation, and an emphasis 
on customer service, Beckwith Electric 
rebuilt its facilities and continued to 
grow. 
Today, Beckwith Electric Company 
is one of the largest manufacturing 
companies in the Tampa area. Rich-
ard’s son, Thomas Beckwith, serves as 
chief executive officer and led the com-
pany to a 33-percent increase in growth 
last year. Beckwith Electric designs 
and manufactures all of its products, 
including components for electrical 
power grids, generators, and protective 
relays for transformers at its Largo, 
FL, 
facility. 
These 
items 
protect, 
strengthen, and increase the efficiency 
of electric utility networks. As part of 
the 
U.S. 
critical 
industrial 
base, 
Beckwith Electric’s products are found 
in military installations, hospitals, and 
schools. They work with electric utili-
ties, manufacturers, and producers of 
alternative sources of energy world-
wide. They also contributed to rebuild-
ing Iraq’s power grid during Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. 
Over the years, Beckwith Electric 
has been recognized for excellence in 
their industrial field and for their edu-
cational programs. Partnering with St. 
Petersburg College and Pinellas Coun-
ty Schools, Beckwith Electric regu-
larly hosts educational workshops and 
technical training programs. In 2012, 
they earned the Florida Sterling Coun-
cil Challenger Award. Beckwith has 
also earned several local and national 
awards from the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers—IEEE—the 
industry’s professional society. They 
partner with IEEE in hosting con-
tinuing education workshops for indus-
try professionals. 
Like many other Floridian small 
businesses, Beckwith Electric Company 
was impacted by the coronavirus pan-
demic. An essential business, they 
managed to stay open, keep their em-
ployees safe, and play a key role in 
keeping our nation’s electrical utilities 
running smoothly. In April 2020, the 
U.S. Small Business Administration 
launched the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, a small business relief program 
that I was proud to author. The PPP 
provides forgivable loans to impacted 
small businesses and nonprofits who 
maintain their payroll during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Thanks to their 
PPP loan, Beckwith Electric saved 20 
jobs, while paying all of their 185 em-
ployees. 
Beckwith Electric Company dem-
onstrates the key role that small busi-
nesses play in our Nation’s critical in-
frastructure and industrial manufac-
turing base. I commend their innova-
tion, resilience, and high-quality work. 
Congratulations to Thomas and the en-
tire team at Beckwith Electric Com-
pany. I look forward to watching your 
continued innovation and growth in 
Florida and beyond.∑

By Mr. COTTON: 
S. 4648. A bill to amend the Con-
trolled 
Substances 
Act 
to 
list 
isotonitazene as a schedule I controlled 
substance; to the Committee on the Ju-
diciary. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, we are 
facing momentous issues in the Senate 
and in Washington and in our Nation. 
Today, we are debating a spending 
bill to keep the government funded 
past the end of this month. There are 
ongoing negotiations to help provide 
additional relief to those most affected 
by the coronavirus. 
With the sad news of the passing of 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, there is 
now a Supreme Court vacancy as well. 
As momentous as these issues are, we 
ought not miss what is happening on 
the streets of America, though, as too 
many in Washington missed for years 
as Americans were dying by the thou-
sands as a result of the opioid epidemic 
that hit this country, from prescrip-
tion pills to heroin, to synthetic 
opioids like fentanyl. 
Now, in recent years, Washington has 
gotten the news, and we have taken ac-
tion to try to stem the tide of drug 
overdoses around our country. 
But the fight continues, so I want to 
call the Senate and the Nation’s atten-
tion to a new threat: isotonitazene. It 
is harder to pronounce than fentanyl, 
but it is equally deadly. It will kill you 
in a heartbeat, and it also comes from 
China. Reports of iso—as this hard-to- 
pronounce drug is often called on the 
street—are still scattered. 
A shipment was seized in Canada 
early last year. Now it has been pop-
ping up in Europe, in countries as far 
flung as Belgium, Estonia, Germany, 
Latvia, Sweden, and the United King-
dom, and, at about the same time, iso 
has found its way to America as well. 
It has turned up in both pill and pow-
der form, seemingly shipped in con-
centrated, small quantities that escape 
detection too often. Once it is here, it 
is usually cut with other drugs, like 
heroin and cocaine, to make them 
more powerful and much more deadly. 
An unsuspecting drug user can inject 
a tainted dose or take a counterfeit

prescription pill and be dead within 
minutes. Iso is just like fentanyl in 
that regard. 
According to the Drug Enforcement 
Agency, iso is confirmed to have killed 
at least 18 Americans in 4 different 
States and has been encountered in at 
least 48 confirmed incidents across 9 
States. 
However, it has likely killed many 
more. We don’t know for sure because 
tests for iso still are not widely avail-
able, given its novelty, and overdose 
deaths due to a cocktail of iso mixed 
with heroin, cocaine, or other drugs 
may be inadvertently attributed only 
to the known substance. 
What we do know is that iso is just 
the latest weapon that the Chinese 
drug dealers are using in their opium 
war against America. First, they devel-
oped designer fentanyl analogs, which 
have killed—and continue to kill— 
Americans by the thousands. 
However, we have taken strong ac-
tion against fentanyl. Last year, we 
passed my legislation, the Fentanyl 
Sanctions Act, to punish Chinese drug 
dealers, and the President—equally im-
portant—pressured China’s leader to 
crack down on underground drug labs 
in their own country, which sent nine 
fentanyl smugglers to prison. 
These efforts have made a difference, 
but the fight is not over. China’s drug 
dealers have developed a new poison to 
send to America. 
Iso has no recognized medical or in-
dustrial use. It is nothing more and 
nothing less than a way to profit off of 
addiction and death. These Chinese 
drug dealers want iso to be the new 
fentanyl, so we have to take strong ac-
tion to make sure they fail before more 
Americans are killed. 
The DEA has already taken swift ac-
tion by classifying iso as a schedule I 
controlled substance, its most restric-
tive classification. But this is only a 
temporary measure that will last 2 
years, at most. 
Congress should, therefore, act to en-
sure iso stays on that list for good. 
That is why I am introducing legisla-
tion to permanently classify iso as a 
schedule I controlled substance. This 
will ensure iso receives the strictest 
regulations under our drug laws, and it 
will help our brave drug enforcement 
agents keep this deadly drug off of our 
streets. 
Furthermore, I call upon the leaders 
of the Chinese Communist Party to 
crack down on the production of iso in 
the Chinese mainland. If the leaders of 
the party wish to reduce tensions, if 
they wish to improve relations, they 
ought not to allow their own criminals 
to manufacture drugs with no legiti-
mate purpose specifically designed for 
smuggling into America to poison our 
citizens. 
I urge my colleagues and the admin-
istration to join in this effort to stop 
iso before it spreads even further. This 
drug has already killed too many of 
our fellow citizens. We need to stop it 
before it kills even more.

S.

A 
bill 
to 
protect 
the 
healthcare of hundreds of millions of 
people of the United States and prevent 
efforts of the Department of Justice to 
advocate courts to strike down the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act; read the first time. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4653 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. PROHIBITING DOJ EFFORTS TO AD-
VOCATE COURTS TO STRIKE DOWN 
PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORD-
ABLE CARE ACT. 
The Department of Justice may not in any 
case, including in California v. Texas, No. 19– 
840 (U.S. cert. granted Mar. 2, 2020), advocate 
that a court invalidate any provision of the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
(Public Law 111–148; 124 Stat. 119) or any 
amendment made by that Act. 
By Ms. HIRONO: 
S. 4656. A bill to amend title 38, 
United States Code, to provide for a re-
duction in certain loan fees for certain 
veterans affected by major disasters; to 
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Ms. HIRONO. M. President, in 2018, 
Hawaii’s Kilauea Volcano erupted, de-
stroying upwards of 700 homes, includ-
ing a home purchased by a veteran 
using the VA Home Loan Guaranty 
Program. When this veteran went to 
replace the home he had lost by once 
again using the Home Loan Guaranty 
Program, he found that he would be 
forced to pay significantly higher fees 
for using the program a second time. 
Our Nation’s veterans should not be 
penalized for losing their homes to nat-
ural disasters and it is for this reason 
that I come to the floor today to intro-
duce the Veteran Home Loan Disaster 
Recovery Act of 2020. 
Congress has established a variety of 
programs in pursuit of both thanking 
our Nation’s veterans and ensuring 
that they are able to live comfortable 
lives after their service has ended. One 
of these programs is the VA Home 
Loan Guaranty program, which pro-
vides eligible veterans the opportunity 
to access mortgages backed by the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs. Under 
the program the VA guarantees a por-
tion of a home loan from a private 
lender allowing the veteran borrower 
to receive favorable mortgage terms. 
Participants in this program are re-
quired to pay a funding fee in place of 
closing cost and that fee increases 
based on various factors, including 
whether this is a veteran’s first time 
using the program or if they have pre-
viously had a VA Home Loan. For 
those who have used the loan before, 
the fee is higher, regardless of the cir-
cumstances that led to their needing to 
purchase a home through the program, 
including if their previous home was 
destroyed by a natural disaster. 
The Veteran Home Loan Disaster Re-
covery Act of 2020 would exempt pro-
gram participants from the subsequent 
loan funding fee increase if they lost 
their first home to a natural disaster, 
allowing them to access a lower rate as 
if they were a first-time participant in 
the program. 
According to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA), in 2019, 
there were 101 Presidentially-declared 
disasters across the Nation. So far in 
2020, there have been 92 major disaster 
declarations 
alone. 
Right 
now, 
wildfires rage in different parts of the 
Nation, and we are in the midst of hur-
ricane season in both the Atlantic and 
Pacific Oceans. 
As we continue to experience raging 
wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and mas-
sive hurricanes, it is critical that we 
ensure that we work to limit the ripple 
effects from these disasters. Giving 
veterans the ability to replace homes 
lost through no fault of their own is 
one step in that direction.

711—CALL-
ING ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES TO TAKE EXEC-
UTIVE 
ACTION 
TO 
BROADLY 
CANCEL 
FEDERAL 
STUDENT 
LOAN DEBT 
Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Ms. WAR-
REN, Mr. BROWN, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. SAND-
ERS, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. 
MARKEY, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. MENENDEZ, 
and Mr. WYDEN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 711 
Whereas the United States is facing his-
toric public health and economic crises 
caused by the coronavirus (COVID–19) pan-
demic that threatens the financial well- 
being of nearly every American family; 
Whereas even before the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the United States also faced a his-
toric student loan crisis, which is currently 
holding back our struggling economy and re-
stricting opportunity and prosperity for mil-
lions of American families; 
Whereas nearly 43,000,000 Americans cur-
rently hold more than $1,500,000,000,000 in 
Federal student loan debt; 
Whereas more than 9,000,000 Federal stu-
dent loan borrowers are currently in default 
on those Federal student loans; 
Whereas the COVID–19 economic recession 
and 
historic 
unemployment 
have 
com-
pounded stagnant wages, labor market dis-
crimination, and rising costs of living, mak-
ing it nearly impossible for many Americans 
to ever fully repay their student loans; 
Whereas this historic student debt crisis 
has left millions of Americans less prepared 
to weather the recession triggered by the 
COVID–19 pandemic as communities of color, 
which never fully recovered from the dev-
astating effects of the previous economic re-
cession, have been hit hardest by the dev-
astating health and economic consequences 
of the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas student debt disproportionately 
impacts borrowers of color, who face the

worst effects of the student debt crisis, 
with— 
(1) Black students, due to ongoing struc-
tural barriers that have resulted in per-
sistent racial inequities in incomes and 
wealth, forced to accrue more student debt 
and more often than their White peers; 
(2) Black student borrowers struggling 
more in student loan repayment, including 
defaulting at higher rates than their White 
peers; 
(3) nearly half of Black graduates owing 
more on their undergraduate student loans 4 
years after graduation than they did when 
they received their degree; 
(4) the median Black student borrower 
owing 95 percent of their debt 20 years after 
starting college, while the median White stu-
dent borrower owing 6 percent of their debt 
after such period; and 
(5) Latinx student borrowers, who borrow 
at rates similar to their White peers despite 
having lower household incomes and signifi-
cantly less household wealth, are more like-
ly than their White peers to default on their 
student loans; 
Whereas Black students and other students 
who have attended Historically Black Col-
leges and Universities have had to bear a 
larger share of student loan debt because of 
the historic and continued underfunding of 
these institutions at the State and Federal 
levels; 
Whereas student debt cancellation for the 
families that need it most can substantially 
increase Black and Latinx household wealth 
and help close racial wealth gaps; 
Whereas women hold more than two-thirds 
of the Nation’s student loan debt and must 
borrow an average of $3,000 more than men to 
attend higher education; 
Whereas, if left unaddressed, the student 
debt crisis will worsen inequality, exacer-
bate the current recession, widen the racial 
wealth gap, and slow economic recovery; 
Whereas broad student debt cancellation is 
the most efficient and effective solution to 
our student debt crisis, would help millions 
of families, and would remove a significant 
drag holding back our economy; 
Whereas broad student debt cancellation 
would provide immediate relief to millions of 
American families who are struggling during 
this pandemic and recession, and prevent 
them from having an unsustainable student 
debt burden waiting for them once this pan-
demic is over; 
Whereas broad student debt cancellation 
would provide a boost to our struggling econ-
omy through a consumer-driven economic 
stimulus, greater home-buying rates and 
housing stability, expanded access to more 
affordable financial products including car 
loans and mortgages, higher college comple-
tion rates, and greater small business forma-
tion; 
Whereas President Donald J. Trump’s 
Memorandum on Continued Student Loan 
Payment Relief During the COVID–19 Pan-
demic, Issued August 8, 2020, will expire on 
December 31, 2020, causing tens of millions of 
Federal student loan borrowers to enter re-
payment on New Year’s Day of 2021, includ-
ing recent graduates facing one of the tough-
est job markets in recent history; 
Whereas more than 100 community, civil 
rights, consumer, and student advocacy or-
ganizations have urged student debt can-
cellation for all borrowers in response to the 
COVID–19 pandemic public health and eco-
nomic crises; 
Whereas Congress has already granted the 
Secretary of Education the legal authority 
to broadly cancel student debt under section 
432(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
U.S.C. 1082(a)), which grants the Secretary 
the authority to modify, ‘‘. . . compromise, 
waive, or release any right, title, claim, lien, 
or demand, however acquired, including any 
equity or any right of redemption’’; 
Whereas the United States Department of 
Education has reportedly used this authority 
to implement relief for Federal student loan 
borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic; 
and 
Whereas on June 29, 2020, President Donald 
J. Trump, with the support of Secretary of 
Education Betsy DeVos, vetoed H.J. Res. 76 
‘‘Providing for congressional disapproval 
under chapter 8 of title 5, United States 
Code, of the rule submitted by the Depart-
ment of Education relating to ‘Borrower De-
fense Institutional Accountability’ ’’, block-
ing a resolution that passed Congress with 
bipartisan support to overturn a Department 
of Education rule that makes it harder for 
defrauded Federal student loan borrowers to 
see their loans discharged: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the Secretary of Education’s 
broad administrative authority to cancel 
Federal student loan debt under the existing 
authorities of section 432(a) of the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1082(a)); 
(2) calls on the President of the United 
States to take executive action to broadly 
cancel up to $50,000 in Federal student loan 
debt for Federal student loan borrowers ad-
ministratively using existing legal authori-
ties under such section 432(a), and any other 
authorities available under the law; 
(3) encourages the President of the United 
States, in taking such executive action, to 
use the executive’s authority under the In-
ternal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure no tax 
liability for Federal student loan borrowers 
resulting from administrative debt cancella-
tion; 
(4) encourages the President of the United 
States, in taking such executive action, to 
ensure that administrative debt cancellation 
helps close racial wealth gaps and avoids the 
bulk of Federal student debt cancellation 
benefits accruing to the wealthiest bor-
rowers; and 
(5) encourages the President of the United 
States to continue to pause student loan 
payments and interest accumulation for Fed-
eral student loan borrowers for the entire 
duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mrs. CAP-
ITO, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, and Mr. DURBIN) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 712 
Whereas 
community 
schools 
marshal, 
align, and unite the assets, resources, and 
capacity of schools and communities for the 
success of students, families, and commu-
nities; 
Whereas community schools are an effec-
tive, evidence-based, and equity-driven strat-
egy for school improvement included under 
section 4625 of the Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7275), 
as added by section 4601 of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (Public Law 114–95; 129 Stat. 
2029); 
Whereas community schools that provide 
integrated student supports, well-designed 
and expanded learning opportunities, and ac-
tive family and community engagement and 
that use collaborative leadership and prac-
tices have positive academic and nonaca-
demic outcomes, including improvements in 
student 
attendance, 
behavior, 
academic 
achievement, school readiness, and mental 
and physical health, high school graduation 
rates, and school climate and reduced racial 
and economic achievement gaps; 
Whereas community schools have the po-
tential for closing racial and economic 
achievement gaps, as indicated in a 2017 re-
port; 
Whereas a 2020 study found that New York 
City’s community schools had a positive im-
pact on student attendance, on-time grade 
progression, and credit accumulation for 
high school students; 
Whereas community schools provide a 
strong social return on investment, with one 
study citing a social return of between $10 to 
$15 for every dollar invested over a 3-year pe-
riod; 
Whereas community school coordinators 
are essential to building successful commu-
nity schools and creating, strengthening, 
and maintaining partnerships between com-
munity schools and their communities; 
Whereas community school coordinators 
facilitate and provide leadership for the col-
laborative process and development of a con-
tinuum of supports and opportunities for 
children, families, and others within a 
school’s community that allow all students 
to learn and the community to thrive; 
Whereas the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘COVID–19’’) 
pandemic poses additional academic, social, 
emotional, and health challenges for stu-
dents, educators, and staff at community 
schools; 
Whereas community school coordinators 
have proven to be innovative and resourceful 
in response to the COVID–19 pandemic, in-
cluding through organizing volunteers for 
mobile food pantries, hosting virtual parent 
hangouts and student lunch groups, con-
tinuing to support onsite behavioral health 
programs through an online platform, and 
participating in advocacy efforts to halt 
eviction orders in their communities; 
Whereas community school coordinators, 
through their role, deliver a strong mone-
tary return on investment for community 
schools and their communities, with one 
study citing a return of $7.11 for every dollar 
invested in the salary of a community school 
coordinator; and 
Whereas Community School Coordinators 
Appreciation Week, celebrated from Sep-
tember 21 through September 25, 2020, recog-
nizes, raises awareness of, and celebrates the 
thousands of community school coordinators 
across the country and the critical role of 
community school coordinators in the suc-
cess of students: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of September 21 
through September 25, 2020, as ‘‘Community 
School Coordinators Appreciation Week’’; 
(2) thanks community school coordinators 
for the work they do to serve students, fami-
lies, and communities, especially as commu-
nities 
continue 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic; and 
(3) encourages students, parents, school ad-
ministrators, and public officials to partici-
pate in virtual events that celebrate Com-
munity School Coordinators Appreciation

CELEBRATING 
THE 
CAREER 
OF 
U.S. CAPITOL POLICE SERGEANT 
JUAN CARDENAS 
HON. DAVID J. TRONE 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the career of U.S. Capitol Police 
Sergeant Juan Cardenas, badge No. 3793, 
who is retiring this month after thirty-two years 
of service. 
For nearly twelve years, Cardenas has 
served as a Sergeant in the First Responders 
Unit. During this time, he has managed the 
mountain bike and First Responders’ training 
programs that serve to protect Members of 
Congress during normal and emergency situa-
tions and acted as a supervisor in charge of 
motorcade operations for the President, Vice 
President, and Heads of State arriving at the 
Capitol. 
Sergeant 
Cardenas 
worked 
on 
projects of the utmost importance, including 
the State of the Union and the last three Pres-
idential Inaugurations. 
Sergeant Cardenas’s success was ground-
ed in his unwavering dedication and excep-
tional skill. From 2000 to 2008, Sergeant 
Cardenas was a supervisor in charge of the 
Patrol Mobile Response Division, and before 
that, Police Officer First Class in Communica-
tions 
Section 
3. 
However, 
Sergeant 
Cardenas’s life of service did not begin with 
the U.S. Capitol Police: Sergeant Cardenas 
first served his country in the United States Air 
Force, where he was selected for Special Air 
Mission and provided security to the Presi-
dential aircraft for then-Vice President George 
H.W. Bush. 
Throughout his career, Sergeant Cardenas 
has led by example as a friendly but resolute 
face on the Capitol grounds and beyond. Time 
and time again, Sergeant Cardenas has es-
tablished himself as an expert, particularly due 
to his role in helping the U.S. Capitol Police 
establish a well-executed and safe motorcade 
operation. His ability and commitment showed 
every single day, whether he was managing a 
motorcade, searching for a lost child, appre-
hending a suspect, or delivering a hot meal or 
new shoes to a homeless veteran. Sergeant 
Cardenas has proven himself to be a man his 
colleagues and our country can rely on. 
Over the years, Sergeant Cardenas has 
been showered with awards and commenda-
tion, including a Blue Badge Medal, one of the 
Department’s top five honors. In 2004, Ser-
geant Cardenas received accolades for cre-
ating a child safety seat program and, in 1998, 
he received the Association of Public-Safety 
Communications Officials telecommunicator of 
the year award for his role as a dispatcher 
during the shooting of U.S. Capitol Police Offi-
cer Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gib-
son. While he is clearly reluctant to retire, it 
should be noted that Sergeant Cardenas has 
given a great deal to the Force, suffering seri-
ous injuries in a 1992 motorcycle accident as 
a Private on Patrol Division. 
Please join me in thanking Sergeant Juan 
Cardenas for his incredible service to the U.S. 
Capitol Police, the Congress of the United 
States, and to our Nation.

STOCK-
PILE ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 21, 2020 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to voice my support for H.R. 7574, the 
Strengthening America’s Strategic National 
Stockpile Act of 2020. This bipartisan legisla-
tion will play a crucial role in strengthening 
state’s and the federal government’s PPE re-
serves to ensure our great nation is even bet-
ter equipped to eradicate future health crises. 
Americans, especially those in South Jersey, 
have been harshly impacted by PPE short-
ages that have increased contraction and 
death rates and put our frontline health work-
ers at great risk. Under this legislation, not 
only will America be better prepared for health 
emergencies, but we will do so by increasing 
American manufacturing of PPE and other es-
sential supplies through an innovative pilot 
program. I am proud to support this crucial bi-
partisan legislation.

AMERICA’S

NATIONAL 
STOCK-
PILE ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 21, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 7574, the Strengthening America’s 
Strategic National Stockpile Act of 2020. I’m 
proud to have advanced this bipartisan bill 
through my Health Subcommittee and I’m 
pleased to support it on the Floor. 
I’m also proud that this legislation includes 
my bill with Representative SUSAN BROOKS to 
allow the SNS to sell and transfer soon-to-be 
expired supplies to other government agen-
cies, stretching taxpayer dollars so we can re-
spond to the current pandemic and be pre-
pared for the next. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has laid bare 
many sad and startling realities in our country. 
One of the most surprising is that the Strategic 
National Stockpile, established in 2003 to re-
spond to public health emergencies like the 
one we’re currently experiencing, was com-
pletely unprepared for the current outbreak. 
When we opened the door of the SNS, the 
cupboard was bare, and American lives were 
lost. Today we’re considering the Strength-
ening America’s Strategic National Stockpile 
Act to address some of these shortcomings. 
This legislation requires that the contents of 
the SNS be in good working order and man-
dates that the Assistant Secretary for Pre-
paredness and Response and CDC implement 
a transparent process for the use and distribu-
tion of such supplies. 
The bill increases reporting on how supplies 
are procured for the SNS, as well as requires 
reporting on states’ requests for supplies dur-
ing the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic. 
While we cannot erase the failures of the 
SNS during the current pandemic, we can en-
sure that the stockpile is adequately supplied 
and maintained so we can be better prepared 
for the next public health emergency. 
I’m proud to be an original sponsor of H.R. 
7574 and I urge my colleagues to support it.

SAVANNA’S ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 21, 2020 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of S. 227, Savanna’s Act, a bill to combat 
the epidemic of missing and murdered Native 
women and girls. 
In the United States, Native women face 
tragically high rates of violence, sexual as-
sault, and murder. According to the Depart-
ment of Justice, 84 percent of Native and 
Alaska Native women have experienced vio-
lence in their lifetime, and the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention found that homi-
cide is the third leading cause of death among 
Native women. These rates are ten times 
higher than the national average and reflect 
centuries of institutional racism and systemic 
inequalities that Native communities face. 
Too often families of missing and murdered 
Native women are left without answers. We 
cannot allow the experiences of Native and In-
digenous communities continue to slip through 
bureaucracy. I am a cosponsor of Savanna’s 
Act, which will create and improve procedures, 
communication, and cooperation among fed-
eral, state, Tribal, and local agencies that may 
share jurisdiction over investigating crimes 
against Native women. 
Our Nation’s devastating history of coloniza-
tion has left missing and murdered Native 
women invisible to law enforcement for cen-
turies, but today, by passing Savanna’s Act 
we can give a voice to this silent crisis. We 
must strive to better understand the institu-
tional racism and systemic inequalities that 
Native communities face. And we must keep 
fighting for justice for those who are missing 
or murdered. 
I thank Congresswoman TORRES for her 
leadership on this bill, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support Savanna’s Act.

SAVANNA’S ACT AND NOT 
INVISIBLE ACT 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I offer my 
stanch support for Savanna’s Act and the Not 
Invisible Act. It is a horrific fact that Native 
American women face a murder rate ten times 
higher than the national average, with eighty- 
four percent experiencing some form of vio-
lence in their lifetime. To make matters worse, 
without a dedicated federal database des-
ignated to collecting information on the num-
ber of how many Native women go missing or 
are murdered every year, we do not have the 
whole picture—this is completely unaccept-
able. Savanna’s Act and the Not Invisible Act 
begin to address the crisis of Missing and 
Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. 
In Arizona, a state home to 22 Native Amer-
ican tribes, we recognize and know the hor-
rors of this crisis. We know that it is a mis-
conception that Native women only go missing 
on Tribal lands. Studies have shown that the 
majority of Native Americans and Alaska Na-
tive people now live in urban communities, 
where they also go missing. Violence against 
Native women spans beyond tribal lands and 
thus so must the solutions. 
I am encouraged to see these bills come to 
the House Floor for consideration because it 
has taken us too long to act on this issue. It 
has taken us too long and lives have been 
taken and lost. We cannot in good conscience 
continue with inaction. I support the passage 
of these bills and hope they are signed into 
law as soon as possible—we owe it to the Na-
tive American women who we have lost and 
those who are still with us today and worry 
they might be next.

CREATING 
A 
RESPECTFUL 
AND 
OPEN 
WORLD 
FOR 
NATURAL 
HAIR ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 21, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary and on Homeland Security, and the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, and as a cosponsor, 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 5309, the ‘‘Cre-
ating a Respectful and Open World for Natural 
Hair Act of 2019’’ or the ‘‘CROWN Act of 
2019,’’ introduced by Congressman RICH-
MOND, which explicitly prohibits discrimination 
on the basis of hair texture or hairstyles com-
monly associated with a particular race or na-
tional origin in areas of the law where discrimi-
nation on the basis of race or national origin 
is already prohibited. 
It has long been my position that discrimina-
tion based on hair texture and hairstyle is a 
form of impermissible race discrimination. 
According to a 2019 report, known as the 
CROWN Study, which was conducted by the 
JOY Collective (CROWN Act Coalition, Dove/ 
Unilever, National Urban League, Color of 
Change), Black people are ‘‘disproportionately 
burdened by policies and practices in public 
places, including the workplace, that target, 
profile, or single them out for their natural hair 
styles—referring to the texture of hair that is 
not permed, dyed, relaxed, or chemically al-
tered.’’ 
The CROWN Study found that Black wom-
en’s hair is ‘‘more policed in the workplace, 
thereby contributing to a climate of group con-
trol in the company culture and perceived pro-
fessional barriers’’ compared to non-Black 
women. 
The study also found that ‘‘Black women are 
more likely to have received formal grooming 
policies in the workplace, and to believe that 
there is a dissonance from her hair and other 
race’s hair’’ and that ‘‘Black women’s hair-
styles were consistently rated lower or ‘less 
ready’ for job performance.’’ 
Among the study’s other findings are that 80 
percent of Black women believed that they 
had to change their hair from its natural state 
to ‘‘fit in at the office,’’ that they were 83 per-
cent more likely to be judged harshly because 
of their looks. 
The study indicated that Black women were 
1.5 times more likely to I be sent home from 
the workplace because of their hair, and that 
they were 3.4 times more likely to be per-
ceived as unprofessional compared to non-Af-
rican-American women. 
Three years ago, the United States Army re-
moved a grooming I regulation prohibiting 
women servicemembers from wearing their 
hair in dreadlocks, a regulation that had a dis-
proportionately 
adverse 
impact 
on 
Black 
women. 
This decision was the result of a 2014 order 
by then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel to 
review the military’s policies regarding hair-
styles popular with African-American women 
after complaints from members of Congress, 
myself included, that the policies unfairly tar-
geted black women. 
In 2015, the Marine Corps followed suit and 
issued regulations to permit lock and twist 
hairstyles. 
The CROWN Study illustrates the preva-
lence of hair discrimination but numerous sto-
ries across the country put names and faces 
to the people behind those numbers. 
In 2017, a Banana Republic employee was 
told by a manager that she was violating the 
company’s dress code because her box braids 
were too ‘‘urban’’ and ‘‘unkempt.’’ 
A year later, in 2018, Andrew Johnson, a 
New Jersey high school student, was forced 
by a white referee to either have his 
dreadlocks cut or forfeit a wrestling match, 
leading him to have his hair cut in public by 
an athletic trainer immediately before the 
match. 
That same year, an 11-year-old Black girl in 
Louisiana was asked to leave class at a pri-
vate Roman Catholic school near New Orle-
ans because her braided hair extensions vio-
lated the school’s policies. 
The next year, two African-American men in 
Texas alleged being denied employment by 
Six Flags because of their hairstyles—one had 
long braids and the other had dreadlocks. 
And earlier this year, there were news re-
ports of a Texas student who would not be al-
lowed to walk at graduation because his 
dreadlocks were too long. 
The CROWN Act prohibits discrimination in 
federally funded programs and activities based 
on an individual’s hair texture or hairstyle if it 
is commonly associated with a particular race 
or national origin, including ‘‘a hairstyle in 
which hair is tightly coiled or tightly curled, 
locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, 
and Afros.’’ 
The legislation also provides that the prohi-
bition will be enforced as if it was incorporated 
into Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
which prohibits discrimination on the basis of 
race, color, or national origin in federally-fund-
ed programs, and that violations of Section 
3(a) will be treated as if they were violations 
of Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Mr. Speaker, allow me to give another ex-
ample of why this legislation is necessary and 
why I support it so strongly. 
In July of this year, Barbers Hill Independent 
School District, just east of my home city of 
Houston, Texas school district reaffirmed its 
discriminatory grooming policy that led to the 
suspension of two Black students earlier this 
year. 
The students—cousins Kaden Bradford and 
De’Andre Arnold—wear their hair in long 
dreadlocks. 
But the school district forbids male students 
from keeping their hair at a length ‘‘below the 
top of a t-shirt collar, below the eyebrows, or 
below the ear lobes.’’ 
De’Andre Arnold had complied with the 
dress code throughout high school by keeping 
his hair up. 
But in 2019 the school board made the 
code more stringent, requiring that students’ 
hair meet the district’s length requirement 
even if not worn let down, which meant that 
De’Andre Arnold would have been required to 
cut his dreadlocks and in the process, destroy 
them, all in contravention of West Indian cul-
tural traditions that specifically prohibit cutting 
or trimming locs. 
De’Andre Arnold, a senior who had been in 
the school district since pre-kindergarten, was 
told by school officials that he would not be 
able to go to the senior prom or walk in his 
high school graduation until he cut his 
dreadlocks. 
Mr. Speaker, Black students are and have 
been disproportionately targeted and penal-
ized for violating facially race-neutral grooming 
policies that are designed to, and have the ef-
fect of, profiling, singling out, and burdening 
Black children for wearing their hair in its nat-
ural state. 
Students like De’Andre Arnold should not be 
faced with the impossible choice of either sup-
pressing their cultural heritage and Black iden-
tity by cutting their natural hair or forfeiting 
their right to equal educational and extra-
curricular opportunities. 
The CROWN Act says to students like 
De’Andre Arnold and others similarly situated 
that the Congress of the United States hears 
him, sees him, and affirms his beauty and dig-
nity and pride in his culture. 
I strongly support this legislation and urge 
all Members to join me in voting for its pas-
sage.

NATIONAL 
CENTERS 
OF 
EXCEL-
LENCE IN CONTINUOUS PHARMA-
CEUTICAL MANUFACTURING ACT 
OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 21, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 4866, the National Centers of Excel-
lence in Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufac-
turing Act of 2019. I’m proud to have ad-
vanced this bipartisan bill through my Health 
Subcommittee and I’m pleased to support it on 
the Floor. 
The National Centers of Excellence in Con-
tinuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Act was 
introduced by Chairman Frank Pallone and 
Representative Brett Guthrie. 
The bill directs FDA to designate National 
Centers of Excellence in Continuous Pharma-
ceutical Manufacturing which would work with 
the FDA and industry to craft a national frame-
work for continuous manufacturing implemen-
tation. 
The bill authorizes $80 million to be appro-
priated from 2021 through 2025. 
Continuous Manufacturing is an emerging 
technology that has been shown to greatly re-
duce both the time and the cost of developing 
and manufacturing medicines. It also enables 
significant improvements in the quality of the 
final product and the reliability of the manufac-
turing process. 
Through H.R. 4866, the Centers of Excel-
lence in continuous pharmaceutical manufac-
turing will organize industry efforts to develop 
continuous manufacturing technologies. 
The Centers could help grow the number of 
companies capable of using these tech-
nologies from the current group of approxi-
mately ten companies to as many as 100 
users. 
Our nation’s dangerous overreliance on for-
eign production of critical drugs and their in-
gredients have led to drug shortages, subpar 
manufacturing and drug quality. This threatens 
patient health and safety and poses national 
security risks to our allied forces. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has exacerbated 
this vulnerability and demonstrates the na-
tional security and public health risks inherent 
in allowing China or another foreign nation to 
gain control of critical drug manufacturing. 
This bill is an important first step to bring 
pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the 
United States, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it.

RECOGNIZING MICHELLE HARVEY 
AS CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize Michelle Harvey, 
founder of the San Diego Face Mask Sewing 
Group, a Facebook community page dedi-
cated to sewing face masks for donation. Now 
more than ever, as we continue addressing 
this unprecedented health crisis, it is on all of 
us to do our part in stopping the spread of 
COVID–19. With this in mind, Michelle Harvey 
found herself getting to work behind the family 
sewing machine. 
Ms. Harvey discovered her newly found 
sewing abilities when her friend, an ICU nurse 
at Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, in-
formed her the hospital would begin taking 
mask donations. In hopes of providing face 
masks for as many essential workers as pos-
sible, Michelle reached out to others who 
would be interested in helping her cause and 
found an overwhelming amount of volunteers. 
From there, the now 1,800 member San Diego 
Face Mask Sewing Group took off. 
Providing members of our community with a 
face mask is one of the easiest and most ef-
fective ways to slow the spread. So far, with 
the unwavering support of her mask-making 
group, Michelle coordinated the donation of 
around 50,000 masks to hospitals, charities, 
and community members across San Diego 
County. In an effort to ensure all followers are 
covered, The San Diego Face Mask Sewing 
Group also offers tutorials for people to create 
their own mask from scratch without ever hav-
ing to leave their homes. 
I launched a Constituent of the Month pro-
gram to recognize individuals who have gone 
above and beyond to make our region and our 
country a stronger place for everyone to live 
and thrive. Today, I am proud to recognize 
Ms. Harvey as my Constituent of the Month, 
and I thank her for being a leader and role 
model in helping our community collectively 
work together to both protect our frontline 
workers and helping to stop the spread of 
COVID–19.

RECOGNIZING THE WORK OF AIS 
AND SEW THE MASKS 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Affordable Interior Systems 
(AIS) of Leominster, Massachusetts, a com-
pany in my Congressional District which man-
ufactures office furniture and which has orga-
nized and joined together with people from 
across the United States to create an amazing 
new nonprofit initiative called Sew the Masks. 
Like so many other patriotic Americans, 
when the AIS team began to see the terrible 
toll the coronavirus pandemic was inflicting on 
our country, they jumped into action. Affection-
ally drawing on the inspiration of World War II 
icon Rosie the Riveter, AIS leveraged their ex-
pertise and retrofitted a chair production line to 
produce high-quality, reusable masks. 
Then, they mobilized their own employees, 
as well as individual sewers across the coun-
try, affectionately known as ‘‘Rosies,’’ to cre-
ate high-quality reusable masks for first re-
sponders and other essential employees at 
risk of COVID–19. 
Fifty masks at a time, these volunteers are 
sewing the pre-cut masks that AIS provides 
and then shipping them out to corporate spon-
sors across the country, which then are dis-
tributed to communities in need. 
AIS has also launched a special partnership 
with the United Way of North Central Massa-
chusetts to help combine efforts and provide 
masks for United Way volunteers. 
Madam Speaker, I find this dedication to the 
fight against COVID–19 nothing short of awe- 
inspiring. During these challenging times, AIS 
has demonstrated an exceptional commitment 
to helping their fellow Americans. They now 
have hundreds and hundreds of volunteers 
across the country, and their leadership is a 
true testament to the value of bringing people 
together to make a difference. I am sincerely 
grateful to the employees of AIS, including 
President and CEO Bruce Platzman, and to all 
the volunteers across America who have given 
their time and talent to this awe-inspiring and 
selfless cause. 
On behalf of the United States Congress, 
the people of Massachusetts’ Second Con-
gressional District, and all the people impacted 
by this incredible work, it is my great honor 
and privilege to recognize AIS and Sew the 
Masks for their tireless efforts to support our 
communities during this unprecedented time.

SUPPORTING 
FOUR 
BIPARTISAN 
BILLS THAT ADDRESS THE MEN-
TAL HEALTH CRISIS 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of four important bipartisan bills that ad-
dress the mental health crisis in our country 
during the pandemic and economic recession. 
H.R. 1646, the Helping Emergency Respond-
ers Overcome Act of 2019, H.R. 4564, the 
Suicide Prevention Lifeline Improvement Act of 
2019, H.R. 4585, the Campaign to Prevent 
Suicide Act and H.R. 5619, the Suicide Pre-
vention Act advanced through my Health Sub-
committee and I’m pleased to support them on 
the Floor. 
In a recent poll, half of adults report that 
their mental health has been negatively im-
pacted due to the coronavirus. Add to this the 
mental impacts on those Americans who are 
grieving loved ones lost to the virus. 
The economic downturn is also taking a 
mental toll on our fellow Americans. Studies 
found for every 1 percent increase in the un-
employment rate, the suicide rate increases by 
1 to 1.6 percent. 
Despite the frequency of mental illness, too 
many suffer in silence. Mental health is a ne-
glected part of our health care system, with

RECOGNIZING CONWAY COUNTY 
FARM FAMILY OF THE YEAR 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize The 3 Brothers Farm 
as the 2020 Conway County Family Farm of 
the Year. The farm, located near Sardis, is run 
by brothers Lucas, Nicholas, and Josh Moore. 
Nicholas and Lucas started farming together 
20 years ago by raising cattle and conducting 
a custom hay baling operation while they at-
tending Morrilton High School. 
In 2013, the two brothers began their crop- 
rotation program after they acquired more land 
after their former employer, Randy Pettingill, 
retired. 
Today, all three brothers raise a mixed 
breed of cattle using Black Angus bulls which 
they sell based on their sterling reputation and 
word-of-mouth sales. One day, they hope to 
open their own retail store stocked by their 
own beef. 
I thank our farm families, whose contribu-
tions to our communities and state keep our 
economy strong while producing the best agri-
cultural products in the country. Congratula-
tions to the Moore Family for winning the 2020 
Conway Family Farm of the year. 
SCARLETT’S SUNSHINE ON 
SUDDEN UNEXPECTED DEATH ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 21, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 2271, the Scarlett’s Sunshine on Sud-
den Unexpected Death Act. I’m proud to have 
advanced this bipartisan bill through my 
Health Subcommittee and I’m pleased to sup-
port it on the Floor. 
No family should suffer the death of a child 
without knowing why, yet over 400 children 
and 3,600 infants die each year from unex-
plained causes. 
We honor these children today by passing 
the Scarlett’s Sunshine Act, which provides 
funding to improve data collection and death 
scene investigations related to unexpected 
deaths and promotes safe sleep practices. 
Because of the lack of a specific way to 
record sudden and unexplained deaths in chil-
dren, it’s impossible to know how widespread 
the problem is or to conduct more research 
into the potential causes. 
The Scarlett’s Sunshine Act addresses this 
problem by funding child death review teams 
and improvement to the CDC’s National Re-
view Case Reporting System. 
The bill also provides resources for the pro-
motion of evidence-based safe infant sleep 
which the American Association of Pediatri-
cians say will clarify guidelines making them 
easier for parents to follow. I urge my col-
leagues to honor these lost children by sup-
porting this bill.

RECOGNIZING 
SUZANNE 
HOGAN 
FOR 
HER 
WORK 
ON 
THE 
LI-
BRARY 
OF 
CONGRESS’ 
GERSHWIN PRIZE 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Suzanne Hogan and 
her contributions to the Library of Congress’ 
Gershwin 
Prize 
for 
Popular 
Song. 
The 
Gershwin Prize celebrates the work of an art-
ist whose career reflects lifetime achievement 
in promoting songs as a vehicle of musical ex-
pression 
and 
cultural 
understanding. 
Suzanne’s dedication, leadership, and exper-
tise were instrumental to the success of the 
Gershwin Prize during her tenure at the Li-
brary of Congress. 
Suzanne was recognized by former Librar-
ian of Congress, James Billington, for her abil-
ity to successfully facilitate relationships be-
tween the Library of Congress and the many 
stakeholders involved in supporting the Prize, 
as well as for developing and executing the 
move of the Gershwin Prize concert from the 
White House to Constitution Hall. This move 
highlighted the connection between the Prize 
and the Library’s mission and work, which Su-
zanne is credited with strengthening over the 
course of her work on the Prize. 
Suzanne’s work on the Gershwin Prize was 
also recognized by former Deputy Librarian of 
Congress, Robert Dizard, Jr., who credited her 
work as being an example for other projects 
undertaken by the Library of Congress. Dep-
uty Librarian Dizard also attributed Suzanne’s 
work strengthening the administration of the 
Gershwin Prize as influential to its sustain-
ability for many years to come. Not only was 
Suzanne able to build up the Gershwin Prize 
within the Library itself, she was able to work 
alongside 
legal 
professionals, 
production 
agencies, artists, and others to elevate the 
prestige of the Prize and build a foundation for 
its future success. 
Suzanne’s work on the Gershwin Prizes em-
bodies initiative, commitment, and excellence. 
Her thoughtful leadership in this endeavor, ac-
knowledged and celebrated by her colleagues, 
is to be admired and emulated. I commend 
her for a job well done.

PROMOTING GOOD GOVERNANCE 
IN THE REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
express my concern regarding the ongoing de-
terioration of good governance in the Republic 
of Georgia. Recent reports indicate the Geor-
gian government has undermined the Digital 
Silk Way, a digital communications project 
meant to transform the region’s technological 
integration and increase independence from 
Russian and Iranian influence. In light of Rus-
sia and Iran’s ongoing corruption and threats 
to international peace and stability, this matter 
is of strategic importance to American foreign 
policy. 
While the Georgian government is an impor-
tant ally of the United States, it has become 
increasingly hostile toward investors in Geor-
gian infrastructure, which threatens critical 
projects in the region. Additionally, the admin-
istration’s recent adoption of new taxes and 
bureaucratic barriers for Western businesses 
only serves to further undermine American 
companies’ ability to operate within Georgia. I 
fear these changes to Georgian business 
practices risks increasing the nation’s depend-
ence on Russia and Iran. 
As an aspiring NATO member and United 
States ally, Georgia must continue to remove 
itself from Russia and Iran’s sphere of influ-
ence. By focusing on infrastructure projects 
that bypass American adversaries in the re-
gion, the Georgian government can create 
new economic opportunities, attract additional 
foreign investment, and protect the country’s 
sovereignty from perverse international influ-
ences. 
The partnership between Georgia and the 
United States relies on Georgia’s ongoing 
commitment to fair international business and 
governance practices. I urge the Department 
of State to raise these issues with the govern-
ment in Tbilisi and ensure the Georgian gov-
ernment facilitates an environment where busi-
nesses are able to develop projects to help 
Georgia remain free from Russian and Iranian 
influence.

COMMENDING THE WORK OF JOHN 
MOLIERE AND STANDARD COM-
MUNICATIONS 
HON. DENVER RIGGLEMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the work being done by 5th 
District residents to combat the COVID–19 
pandemic. The employees of Standard Com-
munications, Inc. have worked diligently with 
the Department of Veterans affairs to install 
medical IT solutions. This work has included a 
new device to aid in the decontamination of 
medical equipment using ultraviolet light. 
As we continue to face the COVID–19 pan-
demic, we have had to adapt and change the 
way we practice medicine in America. As the 
Congressman for Virginia’s 5th District, I have 
been meeting with doctors, nurses, and other 
frontline healthcare workers to address our 
medical needs. One thing has become clear: 
Increasing our telehealth capabilities is critical 
to treating patients during the ongoing pan-
demic. In rural communities, we have seen a 
drop-off in patients seeking medical treatment 
for non-coronavirus related illnesses and inju-
ries. This can create serious long-term issues 
in our healthcare system, where veterans can 
be vulnerable. 
The work done by Standard Communica-
tions and their founder John Moliere is helping 
to alleviate some of these issues. During the 
COVID–19 pandemic we must strive to find in-
novative solutions to the medical needs of our 
community. Telehealth is now helping connect 
patients with healthcare providers in a way we 
had not considered before the outbreak. By in-
creasing the number of doctor visits that can 
be done without face-to-face meetings we can 
continue to slow the spread of the virus and 
flatten the curve. I am grateful for the work of 
John Moliere and Standard Communications.

HAPPYBOTTOMS DURING DIAPER 
NEED AWARENESS WEEK 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize HappyBottoms. 
HappyBottoms is a very important organization 
as they help bridge the gap for the almost 
22,000 children that do not have enough dia-
pers and bring awareness to the need during 
Diaper Need Awareness Week, which is cele-
brated the week of September 21 through 27, 
in Missouri. 
HappyBottoms is Kansas City’s only diaper 
bank and they have been instrumental in alle-
viating the need of diapers for families in the 
Kansas City area since its creation. Created in 
2011, HappyBottoms has provided over 13 
million diapers for low income families in col-
laboration with 41 partner agencies at 54 dis-
tribution sites across 6 counties. In addition to 
their 
work 
within 
the 
community, 
HappyBottoms is also active within 5 area 
hospitals providing diapers to eligible mothers 
of newborns under their ‘‘Bundle of Joys’’ pro-
gram. I strongly support these efforts to ad-
dress the dire need of diapers within the Kan-
sas City area as I believe this will ultimately 
lead to improved health for families within our 
communities. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in recognizing HappyBottoms for their ef-
fort in collecting, packaging and distributing 
diapers to low income families across the Kan-
sas City metro area. I am honored to rep-
resent this wonderful organization in the 
United States Congress.

MATERNAL HEALTH QUALITY 
IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 21, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 4995, the Maternal Health Quality 
Improvement Act of 2019. I’m proud to have 
advanced this bipartisan bill through my 
Health Subcommittee and I’m pleased to sup-
port it on the Floor. 
My 
thanks 
to 
Reps. 
ENGEL, 
KELLY, 
BUCSHON, TORRES SMALL, LATTA, ADAMS, and 
STIVERS for introducing the Maternal Health 
Quality Improvement Act of 2019, a bipartisan 
bill to address the maternal health crisis. 
‘‘The U.S. is the most the dangerous place 
in the developed world to deliver a baby.’’ This 
quote was the conclusion of a major investiga-
tion by USA Today. 
Each year, 700 American women die and 
50,000 women are severely injured due to 
complications related to childbirth. If you’re a 
Black woman in the U.S., the risks are great-
er. Black women are three times more likely to 
die from childbirth than white women in the 
U.S., a startling statistic. 
This is unacceptable and it’s preventable. 
The CDC estimates as much as 60 percent of 
these deaths could be prevented. 
This bill would prevent these deaths by ex-
panding programs that improve the practice of 
maternal care across the country by devel-
oping and disseminating best practices. 
For example, the bill authorizes and funds 
the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health 
or AIM, which includes provider, public health, 
and consumer groups working at the state 
level to implement evidence-based ‘‘maternal 
safety bundles.’’ 
AIM works. States who implement AIM safe-
ty bundles have reduced their maternal mor-
bidity rate as much as 22 percent. This data- 
driven approach was spearheaded in my Con-
gressional District. Stanford’s California Mater-
nal Quality Care Collaborative has reduced 
severe health problems from pregnancy-re-
lated hemorrhages by 21 percent and has 
contributed to reducing the maternal mortality 
rate in California by 55 percent. 
H.R. 4995 also addresses the maternal mor-
tality crisis in rural areas. Rural mothers are 
60 percent more likely to die during or after 
having a child than mothers in American cities, 
and it’s even more dangerous for rural minor-
ity women, including Native American women. 
Fewer than half of rural women live within a 
30-minute drive to a hospital with perinatal 
services, and over 10 percent have to drive 
100 miles or more. 
This bill will close those gaps by expanding 
telehealth grants and increasing training op-
portunities for medical professionals to provide 
care in rural community-based settings. I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
AUSTIN 
HICKLE SELFLESS EFFORTS TO 
DEFEAT COVID–19 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express appreciation for Southern 
Methodist University Student Body Vice Presi-
dent Austin Hickle of Lubbock, Texas. 
During this pandemic Austin has dem-
onstrated true leadership. He used his position 
as SMU Student Body Vice President to es-
tablish the College Health Alliance of Texas 
and recruited other student body presidents 
from colleges and universities across Texas to 
become a unified voice. Together, this alliance 
would be able to amplify the urgency of public 
health compliance and coordinating greater 
student engagement in all necessary meas-
ures to decrease the risk of outbreaks among 
students. By creating this alliance, Austin 
eliminated 
a 
leadership 
vacuum 
in 
the 
COVID–19 response due to the absence of a 
strong student voice encouraging students to 
do their part and maintain best safety prac-
tices on campus. The message of these cam-
pus leaders was carried throughout the state 
in various media outlets. It encouraged stu-
dents to step up to keep their campuses and 
communities safe. 
For leadership that advanced the cause of 
public safety during a global pandemic, I 
would like to thank Austin Hickle for his self-
less efforts on behalf of the State of Texas.

HONORING RAY PETHTEL, JR. 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH

Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I offer 
these remarks in honor of Ray Pethtel, Jr. of 
Christiansburg, Virginia, who passed away on 
September 12, 2020 at the age of 83. Ray 
was a longtime public servant who was com-
mitted to accountability and high performance 
in Virginia state government. 
Ray was born in Gallipolis, Ohio and grad-
uated from high school in New Kensington, 
Pennsylvania. After service in the United 
States Air Force, he returned to Pennsylvania 
and earned a bachelor’s and a master’s de-
gree from the Pennsylvania State University.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E872 
September 22, 2020 
He held multiple positions in New York state 
government, interrupted by a stint in Wash-
ington, D.C., as Director of Administration for 
the American Society for Public Administra-
tion. 
The Virginia General Assembly established 
the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Com-
mission (JLARC) in 1973, and Ray was hired 
as the first director. JLARC was created to as-
sist the General Assembly in its oversight re-
sponsibilities by auditing state government 
agencies and analyzing their effectiveness. In 
this mission, JLARC located an ideal founding 
director in Ray. He assembled a strong team 
and performed his duties with rigor and atten-
tiveness. When I was a member of the House 
of Delegates, I saw firsthand the importance of 
JLARC’s mission and contributions; Ray’s 
work for twelve years at JLARC helped build 
that institution and made it a model for other 
states. 
After winning election in 1985, Governor 
Gerald Baliles appointed Ray to serve as the 
Commissioner of Virginia’s Department of 
Highways and Transportation, now the Depart-
ment of Transportation (VDOT). His time at 
JLARC had familiarized him with the Com-
monwealth’s transportation needs. Under his 
leadership, which lasted through the terms of 
Governor Baliles and his successor Doug 
Wilder, VDOT completed many important 
projects, became more efficient, and improved 
its communications with the public about its 
work. 
Ray continued to work on transportation 
after leaving office at Virginia Tech’s Transpor-
tation Institute. He brought his knowledge of 
highways and transportation to the institute’s 
research, and it now stands as one of the 
country’s leading academic centers in the 
field. In this capacity, I had the opportunity to 
work with Ray. 
For his leadership over the years, Ray won 
numerous awards and recognitions, including 
the New Century Region High Tech Leader-
ship Award, American Society of Highway En-
gineers Robert E. Person P.E. Person of the 
Year Award, the Rotary Foundation Inter-
national Paul Harris Fellow, the Virginia Tech 
University Transportation Fellow, the Penn 
State Alumni Fellow, and the Roanoke- 
Blacksburg Technology Hall of Fame. 
Ray is survived by his wife, Mary Jane, his 
three daughters, Jennifer, Leslie and Judy, his 
grandchildren, Austin, Stephanie and Kath-
leen, and his sons-in-law, Tom, Ken and 
Scott. I would like to offer my condolences to 
them on the loss of this committed and diligent 
public servant.

HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 22, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to offer my unequivocal support for 
the Uyghur Muslim people, and to support the 
Uyghur bills being considered in the House. 
For several years, China has violated inter-
national human rights through the mass sur-
veillance and internment of as many as 
1,800,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
and members of other Muslim minority groups 
in Xinjiang—an Autonomous Region in west-
ern China. Those detained in internment 
camps have described forced political indoc-
trination, torture, beatings, food deprivation, 
and denial of religious, cultural, and linguistic 
freedoms. What are the alleged high crimes 
that 
warrant 
such 
inhumane 
punishment 
against Uyghurs? Wearing long beards, refus-
ing alcohol, or other behaviors that Chinese 
authorities deem to be signs of ‘‘religious ex-
tremism.’’ 
Alarmingly, there is a widespread forced 
labor system that exists inside the mass in-
ternment camps as confirmed by the testi-
mony of camp survivors, satellite imagery, and 
leaked official documents from the Chinese 
government. In its 2019 Annual Report, the 
Congressional-Executive 
Commission 
on 
China found that goods produced with forced 
labor included textiles, electronics, food prod-
ucts, shoes, tea, and handicrafts. We can not 
allow these goods to reach our shores. Amer-
ica must not profit off the denial of religious 
freedom and basic human rights that is per-
petuated against Uyghur Muslims. 
That is why I support the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Disclosure Act of 2020, H.R. 6270, and 
the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, H.R. 
6210. These bills will hold private companies 
wishing to import goods into the U.S. account-
able by ensuring that they demonstrate a 
clean supply chain where goods or raw mate-
rials are not produced using forced labor. Ad-
ditionally, these bills will authorize the Presi-
dent of the United States to apply targeted 
sanctions on anyone responsible for the labor 
trafficking of Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic 
minorities. 
There is no doubt that the United States has 
economically benefitted from the bilateral rela-
tionship with China. Yet, the United States’ 
moral authority must be paramount to the eco-
nomic relationship we have enjoyed. We must 
be willing to sacrifice any monetary gain. Our 
core democratic and constitutional principles 
to practice religion freely must be unwavering. 
In the plight of religious freedom around the 
world and for the Uyghur Muslims in China— 
the United States stands with you. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Uyghurs 
and I urge my colleagues to support these 
bills.
