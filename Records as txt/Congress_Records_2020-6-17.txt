WEDNESDAY, JUNE 17, 2020 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Lord God of Heaven and Earth, 
today, teach our lawmakers to do 
things Your way, embracing Your pre-
cepts and walking in Your paths. 
Lord, make them powerful instru-
ments for goodness in our Nation and 
world. Remind them that the narrow 
and difficult road leads to life and few 
find it. You honor those who honor 
You. 
As our Senators receive guidance 
from You and follow Your leading, re-
place anxiety with calm and confusion 
with 
clarity. 
Give 
them 
attentive 
hearts and open minds as they seek to 
find, in the diversity of ideas, what is 
best for our Nation and world. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa is 
recognized. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute as in morning business, and if 
the leader doesn’t come, I may ask for 
an additional 3 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
yesterday, I gave the details of historic 
police reform that passed unanimously 
in both houses of the Republican-con-
trolled legislature. Surely, if Demo-
crats in Iowa can work with Repub-
licans to find unanimity, we shouldn’t 
have any problems here in the U.S. 
Congress 
passing 
something 
unani-
mously as well. Let’s not let the per-
fect be the enemy of the good. 
This morning, Senate Majority Lead-
er MCCONNELL, Senator TIM SCOTT, and 
other Members of the Republican task 
force unveiled a piece of legislation 
that goes by the title of Just and Uni-
fying Solutions to Invigorate Commu-
nities Everywhere, or the acronym 
JUSTICE, for short. 
I applaud their leadership on this 
issue. Democrats should stop partisan 
attacks and instead spend their time 
with us working together to find solu-
tions. It is pretty simple for me. If the 
Iowa legislature can do it in a bipar-
tisan and unanimous way, we can do it 
here as well. 
f 
TROOP WITHDRAWAL 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
while there are reports of plans to re-
move troops stationed in Germany, I 
am reluctant to comment on a proposal 
that I have not seen. 
What I can say, however, is that Con-
gress will have a say. What I can also 
say is that the U.S. commitment to 
NATO and our European allies is rock 
solid. That said, it is not in the Amer-
ican character to project power for 
power’s sake. 
Since World War II, we have reluc-
tantly accepted the lesson that our ge-
ography and good will alone cannot 
protect us in the United States from 
being dragged into other things around 
the globe, particularly conflicts. 
The U.S. military presence in Europe 
since World War II has preserved the 
freedom of half of Europe and contrib-
uted to the eventual freedom of the 
other half of Europe. Yet, despite en-
joying economic and security benefits, 
polls show our presence is unpopular 
with a large segment of the German 
population. 
Combine 
the 
American 
public’s reluctance to station troops 
abroad with the sense that they are not 
wanted or appreciated by their hosts, 
you can expect some second thoughts. 
This isn’t the whole story. I know 
many German political leaders who 
treasure the friendship between our 
two countries, and their voices are 
needed now more than ever before. 
Moreover, our bases in Germany are 
not there just for the Germans. They 
provide critical support to troops in 
harm’s way in the Middle East and are 
vital for NATO deterrence. 
The people of Poland and the Baltic 
countries are among the most pro- 
American that you can find anywhere 
in the world, and the governments rep-
resenting them put their money where 
their mouth is when it comes to NATO. 
Our mere presence in Europe reduces

REMEMBERING ELEANOR CAROL 
LEAVELL BARR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on behalf of the entire Kentucky dele-
gation, all Kentuckians and the entire 
U.S. Congress, I must begin this morn-
ing by expressing our deepest condo-
lences to our colleague Representative 
ANDY BARR and his family. 
His lovely wife Carol passed away 
suddenly and unexpectedly yesterday. 
She was only 39 years old. She leaves 
behind her husband, their two beautiful 
young daughters, Eleanor and Mary 
Clay, and an entire community that 
knew her, admired her, and valued her 
many contributions. 
To meet Carol Barr was instantly to 
like her. Her warm personality filled 
the room and uplifted everybody. Her 
faith, her love of family, and her dedi-
cation to her community were totally 
evident. Through her own career and 
her work with ANDY, she poured her 
time and talents into giving back to 
her neighbors in the Sixth District. 
We are so very, very sorry for our 
colleague’s loss. All of our prayers go 
out to ANDY, to their girls, and to the 
entire Barr and Leavell families at this 
tremendously difficult hour. 
f 
JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on 
an 
entirely 
different 
matter, 
Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. 
Over the last several months, our coun-
try has been shaken by the killings of 
more Black Americans at the hands of 
law enforcement. The people of this 
country have called for change. 
The United States of America is not 
a fundamentally racist country. We are 
the greatest Nation in world history 
built on the promise of liberty and jus-
tice for all, but our founding promise 
was stained by the sins of slavery and 
racial prejudice. Generations of Ameri-
cans have spent more than a century 
working to remediate that stain. We 
fought a Civil War. Black Americans 
led a movement that won historic Su-
preme Court wins and landmark Fed-
eral legislation. We have squeezed rac-
ist lies out of mainstream society and 
relegated them to a pathetic fringe. 
But the events of the last few weeks 
have reminded this country that the 
stain is not totally gone. We have a lot 
more work to do. While the far left has 
tried to exploit America’s pain and 
anger to push insane policies like 
defunding or disbanding all police or 
nonsense claims like the assertion that 
enforcing laws is inherently racist, the 
rest of the country has been busy unit-
ing around some commonsense truths. 
When Black Americans tell us they 
do not feel safe in their own commu-
nities, we need to listen. When Amer-
ican citizens lack faith in our justice 
system from start to finish, we need to 
respond. When the equal protection of 
the laws feel to some Americans like a 
contingency of demographics and not a 
universal fact of life, we need to act. 
That is what this Senate Republican 
majority is doing today. We are acting. 
Sadly, the junior Senator from South 
Carolina is no stranger to this subject 
himself. Senator SCOTT has led the con-
struction of a strong proposal that will 
increase transparency, grow account-
ability, and advance the cause of police 
reform without lashing out at the 
lion’s share of brave law enforcement 
officers who serve bravely and well. 
Later today, he will introduce this 
new legislation, and it will be the very 
next bill we consider here on the Sen-
ate floor. We will be turning to this bill 
next week. Senator SCOTT’s JUSTICE 
Act provides solutions that are as 
sober, as serious, and as significant as 
this watershed moment demands. 
Faced with the fact that policing is 
primarily a local and State, rather 
than a Federal, concern, our colleague 
has nevertheless found a variety of le-
vers that Congress can pull to advance 
and incentivize and insist on the 
changes that we need to see. We need 
to encourage police departments across 
America to implement practical re-
forms like ending choke holds, training 
their officers to deescalate tense situa-
tions, and having prior disciplinary 
records play a greater role in hiring. 
His bill does that. 
We need to increase accountability so 
that bad officers are easy to spot and 
good officers’ good names stay clear. 
This bill does that. It will get more 
body cameras on the streets, help en-
sure they are used properly, and dis-
seminate new best practices for dis-
cipline, suspension, or dismissal when 
necessary. We also need more trans-
parency so communities have greater 
visibility into local law enforcement. 
This bill does that too. We will require 
full reporting to the FBI when a local 
officer has used force or discharged his 
or her weapon. 
In a subject that has tragically be-
come a major focus for my hometown 
of Louisville, KY, we address no-knock 
warrants as well. We will require new 
transparency and new reporting from 
State and local authorities so sur-
rounding communities and the Federal 
Government can all better understand 
how, when, and why this practice is 
used. 
These are just some of the major 
parts of our colleague’s legislation. The 
JUSTICE Act will also finally make 
lynching a Federal crime. It will close 
the consent loophole by forbidding law 
enforcement from taking advantage of 
people in their custody and more. 
This legislation is a substantial ef-
fort to help our Nation make major 
headway on substantial challenges. I 
am grateful to Senator SCOTT for his 
leadership. I appreciate the contribu-
tions of Chairman LINDSEY GRAHAM, 
Senators CAPITO, CORNYN, LANKFORD, 
and SASSE. 
The Democratic-led House of Rep-
resentatives is, of course, out of town. 
They have had time to issue partisan 
attacks from long distance but have 
yet to take up any police reform legis-
lation in the weeks since the deaths of 
Ms. Taylor and Mr. Floyd. 
The action is in the Senate. The lead-
ership is in the Senate. Now, over the 
past several days, some of our Senate 
Democratic 
colleagues 
have 
under-
taken to attack this new legislation 
before they have even read it and be-
fore it was even released—while it was 
still being compiled, as a matter of 
fact. Let me make this perfectly clear. 
Senate Republicans are interested in 
making a law. We want to enact needed 
reforms. We want to make policing in 
America better. 
We have just demonstrated on the 
CARES Act and, once again, on the 
Great American Outdoors Act, that we 
can act together and achieve bipartisan 
support. This is another one of those 
issues that needs to be addressed— 
needs to be addressed now and can only 
be addressed in the Senate if both sides 
are willing to work together. 
Needless to say, if we are going to 
make law on this issue in the Senate, 
it will have to be a bipartisan effort. I 
hope and expect that there will be op-
portunities for amendments from both 
sides. I hope we can step up, stand to-
gether, and work in good faith to turn 
this impressive starting point into law 
for our country. We will have the 
chance next week, so let’s don’t waste 
it. 
f 
GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, on another matter. Every year in 
Kentucky, nearly 350,000 people take to 
the great outdoors to go hunting— 
more than a third of them on public 
lands. Over half a million head to the 
Commonwealth’s lakes and rivers to 
fish, and 1.3 million enjoy the open 
space and the majesty of our wildlife 
looking for a glimpse of the Bluegrass’ 
native species. And 120,000 Kentuckians 
earn their living keeping these vibrant 
traditions of outdoor recreation up and 
running for everyone else. Public lands 
are an important part of life across our 
State. From the Cumberland Gap to 
the Land Between the Lakes, our 
parks, our refuges, and historic sites 
form the backbone of local economies 
and welcome millions of visitors from 
across the country and around the 
world. 
If you ask any of my colleagues, you 
would hear similar stories about the 
landmarks, 
wilderness, 
and 
history

that made their own States unique. 
America’s hundreds of millions of acres 
of public lands are the result of hun-
dreds of years of exploration and con-
servation. Today, the Senate will act 
to ensure this inheritance will stand 
the test of time for generations of 
Americans yet to come. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
will bring much needed resources to 
the long-deferred maintenance and up-
keep in parks and other public lands all 
across our country. It will secure per-
manent support for the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund and its mis-
sion of expanding access to national 
treasures. 
This major legislation is only before 
us because of the persistent effort on 
the part of several of our colleagues. So 
one last time, I thank Senator GARD-
NER and Senator DAINES for their out-
standing 
leadership, 
and 
Senators 
PORTMAN, MANCHIN, ALEXANDER, and 
WARNER, among other colleagues on 
both sides, for all their work to bring 
this bipartisan project to completion. 
I hope, following our action, the 
House will take it up and pass it quick-
ly. The President has already said he is 
eager to sign it. We should not let this 
historic opportunity pass us by. I look 
forward to passing this monumental 
legislation later today.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, in the 
wake of recent tragic deaths of several 
African Americans at the hands of the 
police, our country has reached a turn-
ing point. 
Americans of every race, background, 
and political persuasion are calling for 
change. Too many Americans feel un-
safe right now. Too many Americans 
live in fear that what happened to 
George Floyd could happen to their 
own fathers, sons, and brothers. Too 
many Americans see in law enforce-
ment officers individuals to be feared 
rather than trusted. 
Americans are ready for all of that to 
end. They want reform and increased 
accountability. They want to make 
sure that we are holding our law en-
forcement officers to the highest stand-
ards. And they want their fellow Amer-
icans to feel confident that what hap-
pened to George Floyd, Breonna Tay-
lor, and too many others will not hap-
pen to their loved ones. 
Members of Congress have been lis-
tening. I have been listening. Today, I 
am proud to rise in support of Senator 
SCOTT’s policing reform bill, which I 
am cosponsoring. 
Senator SCOTT’s Just and Unifying 
Solutions to Invigorate Communities 
Everywhere Act, or the JUSTICE Act, 
is the product of a lot of serious work— 
years of it, in fact. The JUSTICE Act is 
an extensive bill that addresses various 
aspects of policing reform. One impor-
tant section of the bill is the George 
Floyd and Walter Scott Notification 
Act, which would correct deficiencies 
in law enforcement reporting of use-of- 
force incidents. 
Right now, the FBI National Use-of- 
Force Data Collection receives data on 
only about 40 percent of law enforce-
ment officers. That needs to change. 
The only way we can understand the 
scope of the problems we are facing is 
to have full and accurate data. A com-
plete data picture will allow us to pin-
point problems, identify troubled po-
lice departments, and develop best 
practices for use of force and deescala-
tion training. 
There are many, many police depart-
ments across our Nation that are doing 
an exemplary job of policing, that have 
excellent relationships with the com-
munity, and that are already imple-
menting a lot of best practices. But 
there are also more troubled police de-
partments. 
Police departments that fail to train 
their officers properly overlook officer 
misbehavior. We need to identify those 
police departments and demand their 
reform. Collecting full and accurate 
data on use-of-force incidents will help 
us do that. 
One policing measure that has been 
found to reduce both officers’ use of 
force and complaints against police of-
ficers is body cameras. Body-worn cam-
eras record every officer interaction 
with the community, which encourages 
appropriate behavior and helps to cre-
ate an accurate record of events. These 
cameras keep both citizens and police 
officers safer. But implementing the 
use of these cameras can be costly, as 
can storing the copious data that accu-
mulates. So the JUSTICE Act will cre-
ate a new grant program to help local 
police departments purchase body-worn 
cameras and associated data storage. 
Funding eligibility will be conditional 
on the department’s implementation of 
best practices for these cameras, and 
any department that fails to properly 
use the cameras that it has purchased 
using the grant program will face a re-
duction in Federal funding. 
Another important section of the 
JUSTICE Act focuses on police deesca-
lation and duty-to-intervene training. 
Sometimes police end up using force in 
situations where it could have been 
avoided simply because they lack the 
necessary training to deescalate a situ-
ation without the use of force. It may 
be understandable that well-meaning 
but overwhelmed police officers in dan-
gerous circumstances have sometimes 
resorted to the use of force too quickly, 
but that is not a situation we can ac-
cept. 
Every police officer in this country 
should be given the kind of training 
that will ensure that use of force is re-
stricted only to those situations where 
it is absolutely needed. 
I expect to see a lot of support for 
this bill from my Republican col-
leagues here in the Senate. I wouldn’t 
be surprised if this bill receives a lot of 
support from law enforcement, as well, 
because most of our Nation’s law en-
forcement officers want to implement 
policing best practices. They want to 
develop strong relationships with the 
communities they protect, and they 
want to avoid use-of-force incidents 
that place both officers and suspects in 
jeopardy. 
I met with local law enforcement 
leaders in my home State of South Da-
kota last Friday. What I heard from 
them was a real desire to do everything 
they can to serve every member of 
their communities. They have already 
been participating in forums to listen 
to community concerns in the wake of 
George Floyd’s death, and they are 
supportive of JUSTICE Act measures 
to help departments expand their mi-
nority hiring, to improve deescalation 
training, and to develop and promul-
gate best practices. I wouldn’t be sur-
prised if they and a lot of other law en-
forcement agencies end up backing this 
bill. 
I really hope Democrats will come to 
the table as well. Senator SCOTT has 
produced a bill that should have the 
support of every Member of the Senate, 
and I hope that it will. 
We have made a lot of progress as a 
nation when it comes to overcoming 
the sins of our past, but it would be a 
mistake to think that because we have 
made progress, our work is over. There 
is still much to be done and many 
wounds to heal. 
We must make those tasks a priority. 
We must continue to work toward a 
more perfect Union, toward the full re-
alization of our founding promise that 
all men are created equal, and toward

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
POLICE REFORM 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
this morning we have a tale of two 
Chambers. The House of Representa-
tives is starting the consideration of 
the Justice in Policing Act, led by Sen-
ators BOOKER and HARRIS in the Senate 
and developed in conjunction with the 
Congressional Black Caucus and House 
Democrats. The bill represents com-
prehensive, strong, and enduring re-
form to police departments—the most 
forceful set of changes in decades. 
This morning in the Senate, Repub-
licans have put forward a separate pro-
posal, led by the Senator from South 
Carolina. We have had the bill for only 
a few hours and are reviewing it. But 
what is clear is that the Senate Repub-
lican proposal on policing does not rise 
to the moment. 
The Democratic bill has a ban on no- 
knock warrants in Federal drug cases, 
while the Republican bill only requires 
data on no-knock warrants. The Demo-
cratic bill has a publicly available na-
tionwide database on misconduct so 
that abusive police officers who are 
fired can’t simply go to another depart-
ment somewhere else in the country 
and get hired. The Republican bill 
would keep such information almost 
entirely shielded from public view. 
The Democratic bill bans choke holds 
and other tactics that have killed 
Black Americans. The Republican bill 
purports to ban choke holds but only 
those that restrict air flow and not 
blood flow and provides exceptions 
when deadly force is needed. Who de-
termines when deadly force is needed? 
Usually the police themselves, and the 
courts defer to their judgment. 
The Republican bill is silent on racial 
profiling and militarization of local po-
lice departments. Perhaps the greatest 
flaw in the Republican proposal is that 
it is missing real, meaningful account-
ability for individual officers’ mis-
conduct. 
There are no reforms to qualified im-
munity or pattern-and-practice inves-
tigations. This is critically important. 
Without accountability measures, we 
are merely exhorting police depart-
ments to do better, crossing our fingers 
and hoping for the best. Real change 
comes with accountability. As drafted, 
the Republican bill doesn’t provide it. 
So we have a tale of two Chambers, a 
glaring contrast between a strong, 
comprehensive Democratic bill in the 
House and a much narrower and much 
less effective Republican bill in the 
Senate. 
I am glad that Leader MCCONNELL 
has listened to our demands to bring a 
police reform bill to the floor before 
July 4. I have been asking him to do 
this for 3 weeks, and he has finally ac-
ceded. I am glad Republicans have fi-
nally joined the debate and put a pro-
posal forward after much pressure from 
the public, but any final product must 
be strong and must make real and last-
ing changes. 
I would note that before we even get 
to a police reform proposal, the Repub-
lican leader wants to approve a circuit 
court judge next week—the same week 
we are doing police reform—Cory Wil-
son, who has a record of hostility to-
ward voting rights, a nominee who ad-
vocated baseless claims of voter fraud 
and called the concern over voter sup-
pression and discrimination ‘‘poppy-
cock.’’ 
This is sort of the two-faced approach 
that we are seeing. On the one hand, 
they say ‘‘Let’s do something on police 
reform’’; on the other hand, they put 
judges who come in exactly the oppo-
site place and take away voting rights 
and healthcare rights and other things 
that affect African Americans, particu-
larly poor African Americans. 
The Senate is a place where you can 
succeed only if you convince a substan-
tial majority of the Chamber that you 
have good legislation. We expect our 
Republican colleagues to work with us 
to make significant improvement to 
any legislation in order for it to pass. 
We take this very seriously. As we con-
tinue to review the Republican legisla-
tion, I will be talking to my caucus 
about the best way to strengthen it. 
This bill will need dramatic improve-
ment. 
Let me be clear. This is not letting 
the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
This is about making the ineffective 
the enemy of the effective. 
Let me repeat that. This is not about 
letting the perfect be the enemy of the 
good. This is about replacing what is 
ineffective with what is effective, and 
we must have effective change. 
The question is whether legislation 
will bring the change we so desperately 
need or fail to make those necessary 
changes, fail to stop more Black Amer-
icans from dying at the hands of police. 
The question is, Will it work? The Re-
publican bill has a long way to go to 
meet this moment. 
There has been a lot of talk from the 
Republican leader about the ‘‘real chal-
lenge’’ of getting onto a bill. Frankly, 
the ‘‘real challenge’’ is whether Senate 
Republicans will be able to step up to 
the plate and rise to the moment and 
vote for a bill that actually solves the 
problem. We Democrats are going to 
try to get them there. 
It is important that we get this right. 
The vast majority of Americans from 
both political parties support far- 
reaching reforms. More than 75 percent 
want to allow victims of police mis-
conduct to more easily sue police de-
partments for damages. More than 80 
percent want to ban choke holds and 
racial profiling. More than 90 percent 
support independent investigations of 
police departments that show patterns 
of misconduct. And more than 90 per-
cent want a Federal requirement that 
police wear body cameras. There is no 
reason to scribble our changes in the 
margins or nibble around the edges of 
this large, difficult, and persistent 
problem. The moment calls for bold ac-
tion, and the American people are be-
hind it. 
Yesterday, we all got a good look at 
what window dressing looks like and 
what we must all strive to avoid. The 
President 
celebrated 
an 
Executive 
order that supposedly was about police 
reform, but, in reality, it was a bunch 
of vague incentives to suggest that po-
lice departments change on their own. 
The ‘‘ban on choke holds’’ wasn’t a ban 
at all. Even the databases proposed by 
the Executive order are voluntary, not 
mandatory. 
Befitting the seriousness of the topic, 
the President spent the majority of his 
press conference demonizing peaceful 
protesters, airing unjustified griev-
ances against past administrations, 
and suggesting that the same scientific 
expertise that led to the AIDS vaccine 
will lead to a COVID vaccine. Of 
course, there is no AIDS vaccine. 
This was the President’s conference 
on police reform—unbelievable what he 
said at this serious moment. 
We have to do a much better job here 
in Congress. The President isn’t going 
to lead on these issues. He is not going 
to engage with the legislation or pro-
pose effective reforms. He is too busy 
threatening to sue news organizations 
over unflattering polls. 
We, in the Congress, have to take up 
the mantle, and I am glad we will be 
turning to this subject next week. We 
must all set our sights on achieving 
real, strong, effective reforms to police 
departments in America. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip is recognized. 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
there are moments in history when you 
think: This is going to make a dif-
ference. One of them was in a first- 
grade classroom in Connecticut. A per-
son walked into that classroom several 
years ago and opened fire on first grade 
students—6 years of age, 7 years of 
age—their teachers, and assistants. 
They were killed at their desks at 
Sandy Hook. 
I thought that would make a dif-
ference. I thought there would be a na-
tional conversation about gun safety 
and the memory of those beautiful lit-
tle children who died so senselessly be-
cause the person had a gun that gave 
them the power to kill them en masse. 
It didn’t happen. 
Then, when that gunman in the hotel 
in Las Vegas opened fire with a gun 
that he had converted into an auto-
matic 
weapon 
and 
killed 
those

concertgoers at that country western 
concert, just shot at them at random, I 
thought: Now, that will make a dif-
ference. That is the moment when we 
can sit down and honestly talk about 
gun safety in America. It was so graph-
ic, and it was so horrible that at least 
we can come together for a bipartisan 
conversation about making America a 
safer place for first graders in Con-
necticut, for concertgoers in Nevada, 
and for all of the many other gun trag-
edies we have had in America. It didn’t 
happen. The President promised to do 
something. He didn’t. What happened 
in the U.S. Senate in terms of address-
ing this issue? Nothing—nothing, not 
even an effort to keep guns out of the 
hands of people who have no business 
owning them: convicted felons, people 
who are mentally unstable. The types 
of guns that are for sale in the United 
States go far beyond any need for 
sport, hunting, and, in many cases, 
even self-defense. Yet we couldn’t even 
open the conversation on gun safety in 
light of those horrible tragedies. 
Then several weeks ago, a patrolman 
in Minneapolis put his knee on the 
neck of George Floyd, and America 
changed. You see that video, which we 
have all seen over and over again. It 
was so graphic, so real, so personal, 
you just cannot escape it. Here was a 
policeman, in 8 minutes and 46 seconds, 
killing George Floyd. What was the 
charge that he was being accused of? 
Perhaps passing a phony $20 bill—a $20 
bill. 
I think the image that still sticks 
with most of us, in the 8 minutes and 46 
seconds as George Floyd died, were all 
the people begging the policeman to 
stop, imploring him: Please. 
Floyd 
was 
crying 
out 
‘‘I 
can’t 
breathe! I can’t breathe!’’ mentioning 
his mother’s name in those desperate, 
final moments of his life as that patrol-
man stared into that video camera 
with those cold, hard eyes. You cannot 
escape the reality of that video mo-
ment and the impact it has had on 
America and beyond. 
George Floyd’s image and name are 
now the subject of rallies not just 
across America but around the world. 
In my own home State of Illinois, it is 
understandable that in cities like Chi-
cago, which have a diverse population, 
that African Americans know what it 
is like to be the object of racial dis-
crimination when it comes to law en-
forcement. What has amazed me in my 
home State and in many other places, 
with my colleagues, is that this is not 
just a conversation in the big cities of 
America. 
This last Sunday afternoon at 4 
o’clock I went to Jerseyville, IL, for a 
Black Lives Matter rally. What an un-
likely location. I don’t how many Afri-
can-American families live in Jersey 
County or Jerseyville, but there aren’t 
many. It didn’t stop 300 to 400 people 
from gathering on the courthouse lawn 
to make clear that they want things to 
change when it comes to policing in 
America—and change, it must. 
I want to salute my colleagues, par-
ticularly Senators BOOKER and HARRIS. 
They came together and put a bill in 
place with the Congressional Black 
Caucus, with KAREN BASS, a Congress-
woman from California. It is a bi-
cameral proposal that has been intro-
duced now in the House and Senate. I 
am proud to be a cosponsor. It is com-
prehensive, and it takes into consider-
ation the reality that these moments 
of historic opportunity come along 
very seldom, and when they come, we 
need to seize them to make a difference 
in this great Nation. 
Let’s not be halfhearted. Let’s be 
committed to doing something that 
makes a difference, and that means a 
bipartisan effort. 
TIM SCOTT is my friend, a Republican 
Senator from the State of South Caro-
lina. I like him, and I respect him. He 
has done and said things that I think 
have made a real impact on this Na-
tion. His observations as an African- 
American Senator from South Carolina 
and what he has gone through—not 
just in his State but in his life and 
even in Washington, DC—touch my 
heart. I know that they are genuine, 
and so is he. When he was chosen on 
the Republican side to lead the effort 
to come up with some way to bring jus-
tice to policing, I thought that was a 
good choice, and I still do. 
Now we are off to a start in this con-
versation, but it is an unusual and 
awkward start. My colleagues, Sen-
ators BOOKER and HARRIS, put the leg-
islative proposal, the Justice in Polic-
ing Act, on the floor and have de-
scribed it in detail over the last several 
days. It has been there for those who 
support it, as I do, and for those who 
are critical. We are obviously looking 
at this from a lot of perspectives. 
Yesterday, 
the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee held a lengthy hearing on 
police misconduct, and there were ref-
erences throughout to the Booker and 
Harris bill, as both of them serve on 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee. 
Senator 
SCOTT’s bill we saw just a few hours 
ago, and Senator MCCONNELL came to 
the floor earlier to the Senate and said 
that we are moving to this bill. It will 
be the next item of business. 
I am glad that Senator MCCONNELL 
now feels a sense of urgency when it 
comes to reforming policing. Now is 
the moment for us to work together to 
come up with a bipartisan bill that can 
pass the U.S. Senate. Let us not miss 
this opportunity, this historic moment, 
to do something that will make a dif-
ference. 
How many times, how many commis-
sions, how many agencies, how many 
experts have issued reports on dealing 
with racism in law enforcement in 
America? Scores of them. 
Going back to the 1960s, the former 
Governor of Illinois, Otto Kerner’s 
commission, that long ago—60 years 
ago—was considering the same issues, 
many of the same issues we are consid-
ering today. 
The hearings yesterday brought in 
some talented people—experts—to talk 
to us in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee about this measure and this 
challenge that we face—community 
leaders, civil rights activists, and ex-
perts on the subject. I think Senator 
GRAHAM, the chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee on the Repub-
lican side, would agree that hearings 
are important and we should continue 
them, but they are never enough. 
We need to do something that the 
Senate rarely, if ever, does. We need to 
legislate. We ought to do it in a process 
that was established in this Senate 
generations ago, bringing this matter 
to the floor for amendment and debate. 
I understand the numbers in the Sen-
ate. As the whip on the Democratic 
side, I think the skill that is necessary 
to succeed is to be able to count to 60. 
I learned that very early in my Senate 
career. We know what the numbers 
really are. There are 47 Democrats and 
53 Republicans. If you need 60 votes in 
most procedural questions in any de-
bate, it must be bipartisan. If it is 
going to be bipartisan, it means that 
people have to sit down and be willing 
to listen to one another and be willing 
to compromise. I think we can do that. 
I have seen it done. 
I can remember 2 years ago when the 
Senate passed the FIRST STEP Act. I 
started on this mission 10 years ago, 
after the passage of the effort on the 
drug crimes bill in the House of Rep-
resentatives over 20 years ago, it was 
clear that bill was fatally flawed. That 
law resulted in unjust outcomes, as 
well as ineffectiveness when it came to 
fighting drugs. I started 10 years ago to 
try to change it, to change the dis-
parity between crack and cocaine sen-
tencing guidelines. I managed to get 
some part of it done, but when I took 
on the bigger issue of mandatory min-
imum sentencing, which was involved 
in this, as well, I ran into a blockade 
by the name of CHUCK GRASSLEY. 
CHUCK, the senior Senator from Iowa, 
didn’t see eye to eye with my approach 
at all, and I realized my bill was going 
nowhere with him. He was chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee. We sat down 
for a year—for a year—and we came up 
with a bill we both agreed on. It wasn’t 
what I wanted—it wasn’t the original 
bill, by any means—and it wasn’t what 
CHUCK GRASSLEY wanted. But we filed a 
good bill called the FIRST STEP Act, 
and he became the lead sponsor on the 
Grassley-Durbin bipartisan bill. That 
bill passed the House, passed the Sen-
ate, and was signed into law by Presi-
dent Donald Trump. Who would have 
guessed that Donald Trump would have 
signed a bill on criminal justice re-
form? But he did, and he bragged about 
it afterward and continues to this day. 
I guess the lesson learned here is if the 
right people sit down with the right 
goal, we can achieve an important vic-
tory for the American people. 
I understand now, having been to 
these rallies of Black Lives Matter, 
how determined and desperate people 
are across the United States to see us 
change when it comes to racism and

law enforcement. They are desperate, 
primarily in our younger populations. 
It is interesting. Even the largest ral-
lies are being led by high school stu-
dents who are bringing together hun-
dreds and, in some cases, thousands of 
people to peacefully demonstrate on 
behalf of justice in law enforcement. 
The message is pretty clear. They do 
not want to grow up and they don’t 
want to raise their families in the 
shadow of racism. 
We have fought this issue in America 
for over 400 years. That is how long it 
has been since slavery came to our 
shores. The racism that followed from 
it and was part of it is still very much 
alive in America and is seen in video 
after video. These young people are 
telling us once and for all: Change it, 
grownups. You are supposed to be in 
charge. You are supposed to have the 
authority. 
So what we say on the Democratic 
side is that we cannot waste this his-
toric moment, this singular oppor-
tunity. Let us not do something that is 
a token, halfhearted approach. Let us 
focus on making a change that will 
make a difference in the future of 
America. 
When I take a look at the bill we put 
together, the Justice in Policing Act— 
again, I want to salute Senators BOOK-
ER and HARRIS—we establish standards 
for criminal police misconduct under 
the law. We talk about qualified immu-
nity reform. Allow me to say a word 
about this. 
That was the one thing that Senator 
TIM SCOTT said on Sunday was a major 
sticking point on the Republican side. 
We discussed it yesterday in the Senate 
Judiciary Committee hearing. What 
does it mean? It means that if a police-
man is guilty of discriminatory mis-
conduct against a person, they can be 
liable for civil damages. An obvious 
case—if somebody is shot and killed 
and there is a belief that the policeman 
was guilty of misconduct in the proc-
ess, that policeman can be found guilty 
in court and liable for civil damages to 
the family, much the same as wrongful 
death or personal injury. But the prob-
lem is that the courts have taken this 
qualified immunity and basically said 
that if you cannot find an identical 
fact pattern for that policeman’s mis-
conduct, you can’t pursue the civil re-
covery of damages for the family who 
lost the breadwinner, for example. The 
argument for that position has been 
made by some Republicans that even if 
a patrolman or policeman has done 
something that is terribly wrong, you 
shouldn’t take their home away from 
them to compensate that victim’s fam-
ily. So the Republicans have said that 
they don’t want to change the qualified 
immunity standard. 
Now let’s move from that debate to 
the real world, and I know just a little 
bit about it. There was a sheriff in a 
downstate county in Illinois who was 
sued many years ago and accused of 
misconduct for imprisoning and mis-
treating prisoners in his county jail. 
When he was sued in court, much the 
same as the qualified immunity situa-
tion I described earlier, he was de-
fended in that court. Who defended 
that sheriff for his misconduct and po-
tential damages that he owed to his 
victim? I did. I didn’t do it as a U.S. at-
torney or State’s attorney or in any of-
ficial public capacity. I did it rep-
resenting 
an 
insurance 
company. 
DeWitt County, the county that em-
ployed the sheriff, considered him a 
county employee for their purposes and 
had bought an insurance policy which 
said that if there is any wrongdoing by 
county employees, the insurance com-
pany will pay whatever is owed. I rep-
resented the insurance company. We 
went forward with the case. The point 
I am getting to is that sheriff was not 
going to lose his home or car or motor-
cycle. It was a lawsuit being brought in 
court for that sheriff’s responsibility in 
creating a loss to the plaintiff that 
merited damages from the court and 
jury. So this argument that we cannot 
hold policemen responsible for their 
misconduct on a civil basis for dam-
ages overlooks the obvious—that 99 to 
100 percent of damages paid out are 
paid out not by the individual law en-
forcement official but usually by the 
insurance 
company. 
The 
insurance 
company indemnifies the defendants; 
in other words, it takes on the respon-
sibility of defending them and paying 
out any verdict that is filed or any set-
tlement that is reached. 
Why would we want to go ahead and 
allow this civil recovery? Because it is 
a lesson learned for that county when 
it comes to the conduct and training 
and hiring of individuals. If they know 
that certain things are going to result 
in a liability—even through their in-
surance company, with higher insur-
ance premiums as a result—they will 
think twice, won’t they? It is human 
nature. 
The opposite result is true. If the Re-
publicans have their way and don’t 
touch qualified immunity, then, in 
fact, you have created a defense wall 
for any potential defendant who is in 
law enforcement from civil liability, 
and you have taken away the incentive 
of their employer or that department 
to improve the way they administer 
justice. I think it is pretty obvious 
that if we want the right outcome, 
there should be a price to be paid for 
wrongdoing, and there certainly should 
be compensation for a victim’s family. 
So I don’t understand the resistance 
on the Republican side. We need to talk 
because we cannot move forward on 
this issue of police responsibility and 
say there is a whole area of immunity 
when it comes to the police being sued 
for civil damages in court. 
We also need pattern and practice in-
vestigations. What that means is there 
comes a moment when the Department 
of Justice needs to take a look at local 
police departments. I know about that. 
The shooting of Laquan McDonald in 
the city of Chicago was an event that 
still has an impact on the people who 
live there. I joined with the attorney 
general, Lisa Madigan, in asking the 
Department of Justice to investigate 
the police department after the shoot-
ing of Laquan McDonald. It wasn’t a 
popular decision with some people, but 
I thought it was the right thing to do. 
We will be better for it. The city of 
Chicago will make changes that need 
to be made, and I am sure there need to 
be more in the future, but extending 
and advancing pattern and practice in-
vestigations in the Department of Jus-
tice is long overdue. In the Obama ad-
ministration over 20 of these investiga-
tions took place across America; under 
the Trump administration, one. It is 
time for the Department of Justice to 
do its job, and that is part of what we 
are setting out to do. 
We also have the Law Enforcement 
Trust and Integrity Act included in the 
Booker-Harris bill. Police departments 
lack uniform standards to ensure an 
adherence to best practices in commu-
nities of color with accountability. We 
call on the Attorney General and the 
Department of Justice to move them in 
the right direction of training and re-
training when it comes to reducing the 
use of force and reducing the killings 
that are taking place that are unneces-
sary. 
We need to establish a national po-
lice misconduct registry, which is part 
of the Booker-Harris bill, so no police 
officer who loses his or her job because 
of misconduct can go to a nearby juris-
diction or another State and escape the 
scrutiny of taking a review of the his-
tory they have as members of a police 
department. 
We need to require States to report 
to the Justice Department incidents in 
which force is used against a civilian or 
against a law enforcement officer. I bet 
99 percent of Americans believe there 
is automatic reporting, for example, of 
the shooting of unarmed people by po-
lice across the United States. There 
isn’t. It turns out that the only source 
you can find is the Washington Post 
newspaper, which decided in 2015 to 
start collecting that information by 
reading news outlets and information 
and putting it all together. Let’s get 
the data so we will understand if we 
are falling behind or making progress 
when it comes to the administration of 
justice. 
We need to prohibit Federal, State, 
and local law enforcement from racial, 
religious, and discriminatory profiling. 
This is an issue I have been working on 
for 
years. 
Others 
feel 
the 
same. 
Profiling needs to come to an end. We 
know it is a real problem. We need real 
training on racial bias and a duty to 
intervene. This gets to the heart of po-
licing. 
Policing runs parallel to our military 
in the standards and rules that they 
operate under. We talk about peer 
intervention. We ask ourselves, why 
didn’t the other three policemen in 
Minneapolis say to that policeman 
with his knee on the neck of George 
Floyd, ‘‘Stop. You are killing him’’?

They didn’t because of the so-called 
chain of command. We need to have 
peer scrutiny and peer intervention, 
particularly in life-and-death situa-
tions. 
We believe we should ban the no- 
knock warrants in drug cases. We know 
what happened in the city of Louis-
ville. We want to make certain it 
doesn’t happen again. 
We want a clear ban on choke holds 
and carotid holds. We want the police 
to exercise absolute care with everyone 
with a standard of reasonableness to 
prevent death and serious bodily in-
jury. 
Consider 
what 
happened in that 
Wendy’s parking lot in Atlanta. There 
are a number of factors involved here, 
but what was at the heart of the issue? 
At the heart of the issue was a man 
who drank too much and fell asleep in 
his car in the drive-in line at Wendy’s. 
That is what started the police call and 
everything that followed. At the end of 
40 minutes, the man who fell asleep in 
his car was shot dead in that parking 
lot. When you try to bring and measure 
the response and the result against the 
original charge, it is like the $20 coun-
terfeit bill. You think to yourself: Did 
that merit pulling a gun and killing a 
man because he fell asleep in his car? 
He shouldn’t have been driving while 
intoxicated, but there is no evidence he 
was involved in any accident. There 
was certainly a better way to bring 
that to a conclusion other than the 
confrontation that led to his death. 
We also need the Camera Account-
ability Act, requiring Federal uni-
formed police officers to wear body 
cameras and have dashboard cameras 
and make sure they are operable. We 
also need to finally pass the Justice for 
Victims of Lynching Act. I spoke on 
that yesterday, and I will not dwell on 
it today, but this is long, long overdue. 
One of the first Federal anti-lynching 
bills was introduced after World War I 
by a Republican Congressman in St. 
Louis named Leonidas Dyer, a World 
War I veteran who served as an officer 
in the Army. He was prosecuting attor-
ney for St. Louis County. On July 1, 
1917, there was a horrendous race riot 
in my hometown of East St. Louis, IL, 
where 7,000 African Americans were 
rousted out of their homes and forced 
to cross the bridges into the city of St. 
Louis to escape death. The estimates of 
how many were killed are just that, 
but they range in the hundreds of Afri-
can Americans who were lynched and 
murdered. 
As a result of that horrible experi-
ence in East St. Louis and the race 
riot, Congressman Dyer, Republican of 
St. Louis, introduced the Federal anti- 
lynching law. He passed it in the House 
of Representatives. There were 119 neg-
ative votes. Among the negative votes 
were four Members of the House who 
went on to become Speakers, but all 
four voted against the Dyer Federal 
anti-lynching bill. It was sent to the 
Senate where it died by design. A com-
bination of those who opposed it, in-
cluding southern Democrats, stopped 
the bill from being considered. It faced 
a filibuster—end of story but not the 
end of lynching, by any means. 
Lynching is a blight on America’s 
history. There is absolutely no reason 
why we should not include the Federal 
anti-lynching statute, which passed the 
House 410 to 4, in this package that is 
being considered. I believe it may be 
part of Senator SCOTT’s bill as well. I 
hope it will pass. I hope the one Sen-
ator on the other side of the aisle who 
has held it up can be convinced other-
wise. History demands that we bring an 
end to this miserable, bloody chapter 
in American history, which touches so 
many of our States. 
We have a job to do. We now have 
two bills, and we are seeing the Repub-
lican bill for the first time this morn-
ing. Many of us believe it is at least an 
indication of the urgency of the issue 
but not as responsive as it should be. 
Let us not escape this moment in his-
tory. Let us not avoid it. Let’s face it, 
and let’s use it. We can make this a 
better Nation. We can say to those 
young 
people, 
Black, 
White, 
and 
Brown, those young women and men 
who are leading the marches in my 
State and across the Nation: We hear 
you. We understand you want to grow 
up in a different world, in a different 
Nation. We understand that you want 
to see discrimination and racial mis-
treatment come to an end in this coun-
try. This generation, the ones who are 
elected to do something about it, will 
do just that. We will respond. 
I hope what Senator MCCONNELL said 
this morning about opening this debate 
on the floor of the Senate is not just a 
one-and-done, 
take-it-or-leave-it 
ap-
proach on the majority side of the 
aisle. Let’s have a real debate. Let’s 
have 
real 
effort 
to 
find 
common 
ground. I think it can work. 
Senator GRASSLEY and I proved that 
with the FIRST STEP Act, a bipar-
tisan bill signed by President Trump 
that made a difference. Literally, thou-
sands of Federal inmates were released 
from prison who had been serving 
lengthy, 
impossible-to-explain 
sen-
tences for nonviolent drug activity. 
They are home now. They are back out 
of prison now, as they should be. They 
did it on a bipartisan basis, and we 
compromised to reach it. 
Let us make sure that at the end of 
the day, what we do pass makes a dif-
ference in the future of America, not 
just a quick press release but some-
thing we can live with and be proud of 
for years to come. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The Senator from Montana. 
H.R. 1957 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today, 
we will make history in the Senate. 
Today, we will vote on one of the most 
important conservation bills not just 
in years but in decades. 
Today, we get one step closer to pro-
tecting our outdoor heritage for our 
children, our grandchildren, for future 
generations of Montanans, and for all 
Americans because today we will be 
casting the final vote on this historic 
bipartisan bill entitled the ‘‘Great 
American Outdoors Act.’’ 
Today, for the first time ever in the 
U.S. Senate, we will vote to make fund-
ing for a critical conservation program, 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, full and mandatory. This funding 
will protect the program and provide 
certainty for our land managers, for 
conservationists, for sports men and 
women. 
I spoke with Montanans across our 
State about the importance of this pro-
gram. What is interesting is no matter 
what 
the 
ideologies 
are, 
these 
ideologies across the board, from left 
to right—they agree that this program 
will protect our outdoors for current 
and future generations. 
As a Senator from Montana, Big Sky 
Country—in fact, we like to call Mon-
tana ‘‘The Last Best Place’’—I know 
just how important it is that we have 
access to our public lands and the op-
portunity to enjoy our outdoors. In 
fact, it is a major driver of our econ-
omy, the outdoor recreation economy. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund enables better public access to 
our public lands. It is going to help cre-
ate jobs in a time when we need them 
the most. It will help protect wildlife 
habitat. It will help improve land man-
agement. It links conservation to a 
strong energy sector, and it costs the 
taxpayers nothing. 
Today, by voting on the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, we will also provide 
a significant downpayment to address 
the maintenance backlog that is facing 
our national parks and our public 
lands. I chair the National Parks Sub-
committee here in the Senate. As a 
fifth-generation Montanan who grew 
up going to our national parks—I grew 
up in the shadows of Yellowstone Na-
tional Park, just about 11⁄2 hours from 
my home—because of enjoying the out-
doors with my family, this has been 
one of my top priorities. 
You see, our national parks and our 
public lands set us apart from the rest 
of the world, but our parks have seen 
an 
increase 
in 
visitation—in 
fact, 
record visitation for many of our 
parks. That is a really good thing. 
Our park infrastructure is at risk of 
being loved to death, leading to dilapi-
dated infrastructure that can com-
promise the visitor experience and 
safety. There is nearly $12 billion in 
maintenance backlog facing our na-
tional parks across the Nation, includ-
ing over $700 million in Glacier and 
Yellowstone National Parks, an addi-
tional $34 million throughout other na-
tional parks in Montana. We have a 
great opportunity today to address this 
by getting this bipartisan bill, the 
Great American Outdoors Act, done 
and passed out of the Senate and send 
it over to the House. 
As a kid who grew up in Bozeman, I 
went to kindergarten through college 
in Bozeman. I was a Bozeman Hawk in

high school and proud Montana State 
University Bobcat. I know just how im-
portant it is to get this done for Mon-
tana. 
I am also fortunate to have the op-
portunity to enjoy Montana outdoors 
with my sweet wife, Cindy, and our 
four children and our granddaughter, 
Emma, and soon-to-be new grandson in 
just a few months. You see, Montana’s 
public lands are part of our Montana 
way of life. They are part of our herit-
age, who we are as Montanans. 
I have been very fortunate to be able 
to fly fish many of Montana’s rivers 
and their streams. In fact, my son took 
that picture of me up in the Beartooth 
a few years ago. I remember that dis-
tinctly. Just around the corner of 
where that picture was taken, I was 
working my way up that stream and 
got a real nice cutthroat and ripple. In 
fact, Cindy and I backpack in the 
Beartooth, in the wilderness area, 
every August. We take along two of our 
dogs, Ruby and Reagan. In fact, I took 
that picture of our son, Michael, up in 
the High Country of Montana. We get 
places like this where there are vir-
tually no trails. This is wild country. 
It is unique to the world that we have 
places that are so pristine and still re-
main so relatively untouched. My wife 
and I have instilled in our family the 
same passion and love for outdoors 
that we have shared for so long. 
Here we are at a backpack, again, up 
in the Beartooth. This is not too far 
from Granite Peak, Montana’s highest 
point. Some of our best memories are 
spending time with our son, Michael, 
there, the dog, Cindy, and me there. 
I want to show you this next picture 
because that sums up probably who we 
are as a couple. We went back up to the 
Hyalite area south of Bozeman a few 
years ago. That peak is Hyalite Peak. 
Back in 1986, that is where I asked 
Cindy to marry me. We got engaged on 
top of that mountain, a peak over 
10,000 feet high. 
This is more than just some theo-
retical discussion that we are having 
today on the floor of the Senate. This 
is about protecting our Montana out-
door way of life. It is the very heart 
and soul of who we are as Montanans. 
In fact, since I came to Congress, I 
made it one of my highest priorities to 
protect and expand access to our public 
lands. 
I am proud to be standing here today, 
ready to vote on this historic conserva-
tion bill. Today, I urge my colleagues— 
it doesn’t matter whether you are a 
Democrat or Republican—to come to-
gether and pass this bipartisan bill 
that will benefit generations. I think 
we are going to have a really strong 
vote today. My sense is it will be an 
overwhelming affirmation of this im-
portant legislation. I look forward to 
seeing that. I look forward to passing 
the Great American Outdoors Act 
today, working to get it out of the 
House, which is our next step, and get-
ting it onto President Trump’s desk. I 
spoke with him today, and he is excited 
to sign this historic piece of legislation 
into law. Montana is ready. I am ready. 
Let’s get her done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to join my colleagues to talk 
about the final passage of the Great 
American Outdoors Act and to discuss 
what it really means to all of us. 
Obviously, the great outdoors means 
a lot to the State of Washington. No-
body probably needs that explained to 
them. I recently read a quote from 
George Vancouver when he was discov-
ering the Pacific Northwest. Even in 
his remarks, he was so astounded that 
this was such a beautiful place. It tells 
you it lasts for generations, and that is 
what this bill is about. This bill is 
making it last for generations beyond 
us. 
I want to thank the bipartisan effort 
of five Democrats and five Republicans 
who joined together to originally put 
the parks’ backlog and maintenance 
together by fully funding the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund. 
People should realize that the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, over its 
history—and I followed it closely be-
cause Scoop Jackson, a long-time Sen-
ator from the State of Washington and 
the original sponsor of the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, understood 
that America was urbanizing, and we 
needed to make an investment in open 
space. That open space gives us park 
and recreational area. 
It has literally provided 5 million 
acres of protected land since its incep-
tion. There are 5 million acres of land 
throughout the United States of Amer-
ica that we can identify in every State 
of the United States to give Americans 
access to open space. 
I mentioned Gas Works Park in the 
State of Washington and Seattle be-
cause it is so iconic. I don’t think peo-
ple would think that Lake Union would 
be the same without Gas Works Park. 
It was a great idea by the leaders of 
our Congress at the time to pass the 
Land and Water Conservation Act. We 
had a fight, literally, in the last 10 or 
15 years between people who didn’t 
want to fully fund or even support the 
Land and Water Conservation Act. We 
let it expire 2 years ago, and people 
were in an argument about how to re-
authorize it. People then wanted to say 
that we don’t really want to do new 
land; we want to take care of the back-
log. That debate went on for a time. 
I think we really tried to emphasize 
the great economy related to the out-
doors because taking this revenue from 
oil and gas offshoring and putting it 
into land conservation has been a big 
win for the American people. Not only 
do they get open space and be able to 
recreate, but it puts money back into 
our economy as well because the out-
door economy is a big juggernaut at 
$877 billion. 
We are ending this debate today. We 
are ending this paradigm that has ex-
isted between some Members who have 
said: Yes, I care about the parks that 
are already there, and maybe we should 
take care of the backlog, but I don’t 
want any new money going to the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund. 
The Land and Water Conservation 
Fund has dedicated across the United 
States 5 million acres as open space for 
all Americans to enjoy. That is a big 
win—ending this debate and ending 
this, I would say, misdirected discus-
sion that tried to pit land against one 
another and, basically, people who 
didn’t want more open space and public 
land. 
I think we are ending that debate on 
a very firm note today that says the 
Senate really believes that open space 
is a great driver of our economy, but 
more importantly, it is an essential as-
pect of American life, and we are going 
to continue to invest in it. 
For us in the State of Washington, 
we have received something like $700 
million over the life of this project 
since the 1960s. With this legislation 
today, we are basically making sure 
the Land and Water Conservation Fund 
dollars connected from offshore oil rev-
enue is spent in the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. We will receive 
hundreds of millions more—between 
$200 million and $300 million more in 
Land and Water Conservation Fund in-
vestment. 
I can’t wait to see what that does for 
us in the Northwest. As I said, starting 
with George Vancouver and on down to 
today, everybody in the Northwest 
knows that the environment is so pre-
cious to us. It is great for its restora-
tive value but also great for our econ-
omy so we want to keep it, and we 
want to keep investing in it. 
The backlog and maintenance we are 
talking about is a phenomenal invest-
ment. I encourage all of my colleagues 
to visit Mount Rainier sometime if you 
are in the Pacific Northwest. You can 
drive up to Paradise and visit. Those 
roads and the facilities there need 
maintenance. Even several years ago 
we used the Land and Water Conserva-
tion Fund for the Carbon River im-
provement on a road that kept washing 
out every year, and now we moved it to 
higher ground, expanding the park. 
That makes it more beneficial for peo-
ple to go to that side of the mountain 
as well. 
I am reminded what Teddy Roosevelt 
said: ‘‘The nation behaves well if it 
treats the national resources as assets 
which it must turn over to the next 
generation increased, and not im-
paired, in value.’’ 
That is what we are doing today. We 
are returning that value to the next 
generation. 
I want to specifically thank Senator 
MANCHIN for his leadership on our side 
of the aisle on this. Having sponsored 
this legislation myself 2 years ago with 
Senator BURR and getting it out of the 
committee, we were sad to see that it 
got stuck on the Senate floor. We are 
glad this coalition of five Democrats

and five Republicans led by Senator 
GARDNER has managed to get it to this 
point. 
I also want to mention that Senator 
BURR’s leadership over the last two 
Congresses—actually, all the way back 
to 2010, where he fought to make sure 
that this Land and Water Conservation 
legislation was reauthorized and that 
we make this investment—has played a 
pivotal role in making sure that people 
understand 
what 
that 
investment 
means to the United States. 
So a huge day for public lands in the 
U.S. Senate and a huge day to say that 
Americans will be getting more open 
space and that our parks will be get-
ting a little bit of a facelift, if you will, 
around their roads and bridges and fa-
cilities, their trails, the management 
of our forests, the infrastructure that 
is entailed in giving public access to 
these public spaces. 
It couldn’t be a more important in-
vestment, and it couldn’t give America 
a bigger return. 
So I thank my colleagues. I look for-
ward to getting this rapidly through 
the House of Representatives. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Na-
tion faces an uncertain future. Gripped 
by a pandemic, economic disruption, 
and racial injustice, the American peo-
ple are yearning for bold, forward- 
thinking leadership. Now is the time 
for elected leaders to stand up and 
make the investments necessary to se-
cure a better world for our children and 
grandchildren. The Great American 
Outdoors Act, which I am proud to co-
sponsor, does that. While it addresses a 
narrow set of challenges and opportuni-
ties, it should remind us all that we are 
capable of meaningful, forward-looking 
action. If enacted, our bipartisan bill 
would be the most significant con-
servation achievement in more than 50 
years and would provide benefits for 
generations to come. 
Throughout my service in the Sen-
ate, it has been an honor to bring 
Vermont’s values to Washington. And 
for Vermonters, stewardship of the 
land and water is a bedrock value. Our 
agrarian tradition, sense of place, and 
outdoor economy all rely on preserving 
open spaces and conserving our natural 
resources. This bill reflects those val-
ues on a grand scale. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
would secure full, permanent funding 
for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund. As is true for States across the 
country, the LWCF has played an un-
paralleled role in permanently pro-
tecting some of Vermont’s most impor-
tant and iconic landscapes, and I am 
proud to have been able to take a lead-
ing role in championing this program 
and these investments. In the 55 years 
since its creation, LWCF investments 
totaling 
nearly 
$150 
million 
have 
helped conserve more than 275,000 acres 
in Vermont. From the Green Mountain 
National Forest, to Camel’s Hump, to 
the Long Trail and Green River Res-
ervoir State Park, this program has 
played a role in protecting Vermont’s 
invaluable natural spaces. It has also 
helped Vermont towns conserve local 
treasures and facilities, such as Rut-
land’s Pine Hill Park and the school 
playground in Pomfret. 
As chairman of the Senate Agri-
culture Committee, I was proud to lead 
the creation of the Forest Legacy Pro-
gram in the 1990 Farm Bill. This vol-
untary program recognizes the critical 
stewardship role that private land-
owners play by helping them conserve 
working forest lands. In so doing, the 
Forest Legacy Program supports tim-
ber sector jobs and the forest products 
economy, and it sustains all the other 
benefits provided by intact forests: out-
door recreation, fish and wildlife habi-
tat, and air and water quality. Since 
the Forest Legacy Program’s first 
project at Cow Mountain Pond in 
Vermont’s Northeast Kingdom, more 
than $39 million in Federal Forest Leg-
acy funds have supported the perma-
nent conservation of thousands of acres 
of private working forest lands in my 
State. 
The conservation ethic embodied in 
this bill is not just about green moun-
tains and open waters. This is a con-
servation bill, a stewardship bill, and a 
jobs bill. Passage of the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act would provide imme-
diate and sustained economic stimulus 
to States and communities that des-
perately need it. Vermont’s outdoor 
recreation sector alone contributes an 
estimate $5.5 billion annually, sup-
porting 51,000 jobs. Our forest products 
industry supports more than 10,000 jobs 
and generates nearly $1.5 billion in eco-
nomic output. Maintaining the land 
base that these sectors depend on 
through LWCF investments is essential 
to Vermont, particularly as our State’s 
economy gets back on its feet. An anal-
ysis by the Trust for Public Land esti-
mates that every dollar invested in 
LWCF returns $4 in economic benefits. 
I call that a wise investment, particu-
larly considering that LWCF is funded 
by revenue from offshore oil and gas 
leases. 
The 116th Congress began with the 
passage of a sweeping, bipartisan pub-
lic lands package, the John D. Dingell 
Jr. Conservation, Management, and 
Recreation Act. That bill established 
permanent authorization for LWCF. 
How fitting that we should continue 
the work we started by now estab-
lishing permanent funding for this leg-
acy program and by finally addressing 
the maintenance backlog facing our 
National Parks and other public lands. 
During such an uncertain period for 
our Nation, it is clearer than ever that 
access to trails and public lands is es-
sential for the physical, emotional, and 
economic health of every community. 
The Great American Outdoors Act em-
bodies the spirit of stewardship that 
Vermonters have cultivated for genera-
tions, and I am proud to support it. We 
should celebrate the Senate’s leader-
ship today and thank the broad coali-
tion of conservation stakeholders in 
Vermont and across the country that 
has helped make this moment possible. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I am very 
pleased to support the Great American 
Outdoors Act. This is an effort that is 
many years in the making, so I am 
gratified the majority leader has taken 
this historic step for the future of our 
natural landscape. 
When the President signs this bill 
into law, as he has indicated he will do, 
it will do two incredibly important 
things. It will finally, after 55 years, 
fully fund the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund at its authorized level. 
It will also address the deferred main-
tenance backlog in our national parks 
and public lands. This will be an his-
toric achievement to preserve Amer-
ica’s most treasured places for genera-
tions to come, and I could not be more 
proud to be a part of it. 
As my colleagues know, I have long 
been a champion of LWCF. LWCF is 
America’s most successful conserva-
tion program. It is effective. It is prov-
en. And it costs taxpayers nothing. 
Over the years, LWCF has supported 
more than 42,000 outdoor recreation 
projects. It has benefited every State 
in the country. In North Carolina, it 
has helped preserve parks, trails, and 
outdoor sites from the Great Smoky 
Mountains to the Outer Banks. After a 
hard-fought battle by those of us who 
have long recognized LWCF’s cen-
trality to our conservation efforts, last 
year, Congress permanently authorized 
the program. 
But there was still one essential 
piece missing: full funding. In recent 
years, the program consistently re-
ceived less than half the amount it was 
authorized for. I must remind my col-
leagues that this was essentially theft 
from the program. It derives its own 
funding to achieve its $900 million 
level, yet we have given it far less than 
that nearly every year it has been in 
existence. This bill will change that. 
Going forward, the $900 million that 
annually flows into the fund will fi-
nally be fully dedicated to the good 
things LWCF provides, from securing 
access to recreational and hunting 
lands, to protecting watersheds and 
preserving habitats for wildlife and en-
dangered species. 
In addition to fully funding LWCF, 
the Great American Outdoors Act will 
address 
the 
deferred 
maintenance 
backlog in our national parks, forests, 
and fish and wildlife refuges. My home 
state of North Carolina is blessed with 
some of the most iconic public lands in 
the world: Great Smokies National 
Park, the Blue Ridge Parkway, Cape 
Hatteras and Cape Lookout National 
Seashores, Pisgah National Forest, and 
Lake Mattamuskeet National Wildlife 
Refuge, just to name a few. Millions 
visit these special places each year, 
and they support tens of thousands of 
jobs. 
Unfortunately, the Federal Govern-
ment has not been able to provide the 
resources necessary to maintain these 
treasures at the level they deserve. For

example, at the Blue Ridge Parkway, 
as of 2018, the maintenance backlog 
was over $500 million, but the parkway 
receives only $15 to $20 million a year 
for maintenance work. This bill will 
help fill those gaps by dedicating $1.9 
billion a year from energy development 
on Federal lands to address mainte-
nance needs at our national parks and 
public lands. 
We would not be here without the ef-
forts of many people, but I would like 
to give special thanks to our colleagues 
CORY GARDNER and STEVE DAINES. I 
have been on the frontlines on this 
issue for years, and I know they 
worked extremely hard to build the bi-
partisan coalition behind this bill. I 
would also like to thank my colleagues 
on both sides who I have worked with 
for years to get to this point on LWCF: 
JOE MANCHIN, MARIA CANTWELL, LAMAR 
ALEXANDER, and many others. 
I encourage each and every Senator 
here today to support this critical leg-
islation. Future generations will thank 
them for it. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to add my support for the passage 
of the Great American Outdoors Act. 
This landmark bipartisan bill directs 
significant funding to public lands na-
tionwide, which will benefit commu-
nities across the country. This invest-
ment will continue to pay dividends for 
future generations. 
The purpose of this legislation is 
twofold. First, it provides $900 million 
per year in permanent funding for the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund, 
which supports the protection of Fed-
eral public lands and waters, including 
national parks, forests, wildlife ref-
uges, and recreation areas, and vol-
untary conservation on private land. 
Importantly, 
this 
dedicated 
new 
funding would come from a portion of 
royalties on offshore oil and gas devel-
opment, not the American taxpayer. 
Secondly, the bill establishes the Na-
tional Park and Public Lands Legacy 
Restoration Fund. Similar to the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, this is 
also funded through onshore and off-
shore energy revenues over 5 years, up 
to $1.9 billion annually for a total of 
$9.5 billion. 
Its sole purpose is to address the de-
ferred maintenance needs of the Na-
tional Park Service, U.S. Forest Serv-
ice, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bu-
reau of Land Management, and Bureau 
of Indian Education. 
Currently, the National Park Service 
alone has a backlog of approximately 
$12 billion. This legislation will go a 
long way in helping to complete pri-
ority 
maintenance 
projects 
across 
America’s public lands. 
As we face a severe economic crisis 
as a result of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
I particularly want to highlight the 
fact that this legislation before us 
today is more than just a public lands 
bill; it is also a jobs bill that will help 
fulfill Congress’s commitment to make 
public lands accessible to all Ameri-
cans. 
The National Park System welcomed 
a record 327 million visitors last year, 
adding nearly $42 billion to our na-
tional economy and supporting more 
than 340,000 existing jobs. 
According to Pew Charitable Trusts, 
this bill would also create 110,000 addi-
tional jobs repairing infrastructure in 
our national parks. 
The Great American Outdoors Act 
also upholds Congress’s long-standing 
commitment to ensuring access for all 
Americans to public lands. 
My hope is the investments made by 
this legislation will continue to fulfill 
the purposes laid out in the Land and 
Water Conservation Act of 1965, articu-
lated as ‘‘. . . preserving, developing, 
and assuring accessibility to all citi-
zens of the United States of America of 
present and future generations . . . and 
to strengthen the health and vitality of 
the citizens of the United States.’’ 
As our population continues to grow, 
it is even more vital to help all com-
munities, regardless of race or income 
levels, enjoy access to America’s beau-
tiful open spaces, historical sites, and 
natural wonders. 
California is home to nine national 
parks—more than any other State— 
and we understand the tremendous 
value our public lands provide. 
According to the National Park Serv-
ice, in 2019, 39.6 million park visitors 
spent an estimated $2.7 billion in local 
communities while visiting National 
Park Service lands in California. These 
expenditures supported a total of 36,000 
jobs and $4.3 billion in economic out-
put. 
That is an impressive amount by any 
measure, and I have witnessed the 
power of investments in our national 
parks with my own eyes in places like 
the California desert. 
For example, in 1994, I was proud to 
help enact the California Desert Pro-
tection Act which designated Joshua 
Tree as a national park and protected 
an additional 234,000 acres. 
Today, Joshua Tree is one of the 
most visited national parks in the 
country and welcomed 3 million visi-
tors in 2019, according to the National 
Park Service. These visitors spent ap-
proximately $150 million in local com-
munities surrounding the park and 
supported 1,860 jobs. 
In addition, California has been the 
largest recipient of Land and Water 
Conservation funds in the program’s 
five-decade history. This funding has 
helped protect beloved places like the 
Lake Tahoe Basin, California Desert, 
Point Reyes National Seashore, Head-
waters Forest, San Diego and Don 
Edwards National Wildlife Refuges, and 
the National Forests of the Sierra Ne-
vada. 
According to a recent study, every $1 
million spent from the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund supports as many 
as 30 jobs. Simply stated, an invest-
ment in our public lands is an invest-
ment in the health, welfare, and econo-
mies of our communities. 
In closing, I would like to thank all 
of my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle who came together to prioritize 
these investments in our Nation’s 
prized public lands and the commu-
nities that rely on them. 
Thank you. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
rise to reflect on land conservation as 
the Senate is poised to make an his-
toric commitment to our public lands 
and waters. S. 3422, the Great American 
Outdoors Act, contains two core com-
ponents. The first establishes the Na-
tional Park Service and Public Lands 
Legacy Restoration Fund to support 
deferred maintenance projects on Fed-
eral lands. The second makes funding 
for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund 
permanent. 
Taken 
together, 
these policies will conserve land for the 
enjoyment of the public for generations 
to come and ensure that we continue to 
protect our shared resources. 
The Restoration Fund must be used 
for 
priority 
deferred 
maintenance 
projects that are administered by the 
National Park Service, the Forest 
Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, and the Bureau of Indian Edu-
cation. Our National Parks desperately 
need 
help, 
a 
situation 
President 
Trump’s disastrous 2018–2019 shutdown 
exacerbated. There is an estimated $11 
billion maintenance backlog within the 
National Park System alone. Visitor 
numbers have increased in recent years 
and are likely to continue to do so, 
particularly as the public seeks respite 
at available units from the constraints 
that the novel coronavirus—COVID– 
19—pandemic has placed on daily life. 
Parks have been indispensable assets 
for communities during the ongoing 
public health emergency, allowing peo-
ple to exercise and enjoy the outdoors 
safely 
with 
precautions, 
including 
staying 
local, 
practicing 
physical 
distancing, and using face coverings. 
The LWCF is one of our Nation’s 
most 
successful 
conservation 
pro-
grams. Congress established the LWCF 
in 1964. Since then, it has protected 
nearly 5 million acres of Federal lands 
and supported over 41,000 State and 
local 
projects 
through 
matching 
grants. LWCF has enjoyed bipartisan 
support since its inception; however, 
permanent funding will provide the 
fund with the long-term security and 
stabilization it deserves. 
Maryland has benefited immensely 
from Federal investment in public 
land. Open spaces are particularly im-
portant to just over 6 million Mary-
landers who live and recreate in a high-
ly developed State. Outdoor enthu-
siasts have a significant economic im-
pact on the Maryland communities 
they visit. In 2019, nearly 7 million 
park visitors spent an estimated $233 
million in local gateway regions while 
visiting National Park Service lands in 
Maryland. 
These 
expenditures 
sup-
ported 2,960 jobs, $117 million in labor 
income, and $313 million in economic 
output in the Maryland economy, ac-
cording to the latest annual report, Na-
tional Park Visitor Spending Effects.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3035 
June 17, 2020 
Consideration of this legislation co-
incides with Chesapeake Bay Aware-
ness Week—June 6–14, 2020—leading up 
to the 6-year anniversary of the Chesa-
peake Bay Watershed Agreement. The 
agreement outlines five themes with 10 
goals for the restoration and protec-
tion of the watershed region, including 
conserved lands, engaged communities, 
and climate change. On June 16, 2014, 
the 
Chesapeake 
Executive 
Council 
signed the Chesapeake Bay Watershed 
Agreement. Signatories include rep-
resentatives from the entire watershed, 
committing for the first time the seven 
headwater 
jurisdictions—Maryland, 
Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania, 
Virginia, West Virginia, and the Dis-
trict of Columbia—to a full regional 
partnership with State, Federal, local, 
and academic watershed organizations 
in the Chesapeake Bay Program. 
Permanently funding the LWCF fur-
thers the goals of the Chesapeake Bay 
Watershed Agreement—foremost, the 
land conservation goal: to conserve 
landscapes treasured by citizens in 
order to maintain water quality and 
habitat; 
sustain 
working 
forests, 
farms, and maritime communities; and 
conserve lands of cultural, indigenous, 
and 
community 
value. 
Stormwater 
runoff from urban and suburban areas 
is the fastest growing contributor of 
pollution to the Chesapeake Bay. While 
States have improved their urban and 
suburban stormwater regulatory pro-
grams, overall loads in the sector con-
tinue to increase due to population 
growth and development. Land con-
servation is a powerful tool for reduc-
ing this type of runoff. Protecting open 
spaces and sensitive natural areas re-
duces the water quality and flooding 
impacts of stormwater runoff, while 
providing 
recreational 
opportunities 
for residents. 
Public lands serve as essential cul-
tural education centers, as is the case 
with the Harriet Tubman Underground 
Railroad 
National 
Historical 
Park. 
Congress established this park in 2014 
in 
Cambridge, 
MD, 
within 
the 
Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, a 
LWCF beneficiary site. The park me-
morializes the life of American hero 
Harriet Tubman, known for her con-
tributions as a Civil War spy and nurse, 
suffragist, 
abolitionist, 
and 
Under-
ground Railroad agent. The park al-
lows visitors to explore the landscape 
in Dorchester County where Harriet 
Tubman was born into slavery. This 
unit is crucial to understanding Mary-
land’s history and celebrating the life 
of Harriet Tubman and complements 
the stewardship goal to increase the 
number and diversity of local citizen 
stewards and local governments that 
actively support and carry out the con-
servation and restoration activities 
that achieve healthy local streams, riv-
ers, and a vibrant Chesapeake Bay. 
The LWCF advances the Climate Re-
siliency Goal to increase the capacity 
of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, in-
cluding its living resources, habitats, 
public infrastructure and communities, 
to withstand adverse impacts from 
changing environmental and climate 
conditions. With more than 3,000 miles 
of coastline, Maryland is particularly 
vulnerable to climate change impacts 
related to sea level rise, increased 
flooding, and extreme weather events 
according to the Maryland Commission 
on Climate Change and numerous peer- 
reviewed scientific studies. While ad-
vanced technology is necessary to com-
bat climate change, we must not forget 
nature’s carbon sink: our wetlands and 
forests. Natural capital, also known as 
green infrastructure, is a cost-effective 
way to support sustainability, includ-
ing by protecting water resources and 
enhancing resilience. LWCF funds, par-
ticularly grants through the Forest 
Legacy Program, have enormous divi-
dends by protecting forests and wet-
lands that have the natural ability to 
store excess carbon via photosynthesis. 
Best management practices can help 
protect these stores of carbon and the 
ability of forests and wetlands to se-
quester it. While this legislation is not 
explicitly linked to climate change, it 
is an example of how we can find com-
monsense, bipartisan climate change 
solutions. 
LWCF programs are also terrific ex-
amples of successful partnering with 
State and local government and pri-
vate partners. Broad Creek in Dublin, 
MD, is an excellent example of forest 
stewardship in a rapidly urbanizing 
landscape. The Baltimore Area Council 
of the Boy Scouts of America owns this 
1,964-acre property located within the 
Chesapeake Bay watershed and uses it 
for national and regional Boy Scout 
events. Several Federal- and State-list-
ed rare, threatened and endangered 
species exist on the property. LWCF 
supported 
this 
conservation 
effort 
while supporting Boy Scout and envi-
ronmental education activities, in Har-
ford County, MD, in line with the 
Chesapeake 
Bay 
Watershed 
Agree-
ment’s environmental literacy goal: 
Enable students in the region to grad-
uate with the knowledge and skills to 
act responsibly to protect and restore 
their local watershed. 
For Conquest Waterfront Preserve, 
$1,750,000 in LWCF resources helped 
protect Maryland’s Eastern Shore. This 
76-acre acquisition helped complete a 
758-acre waterfront park in Queen 
Anne’s County in partnership with the 
State, county, and the fund. Situated 
on a peninsula with 5 miles of shoreline 
along the Chester and Corsica Rivers, 
the project preserves important water-
fowl habitat and wetland areas and ex-
pands public access to the Chesapeake 
Bay—another Chesapeake Bay Water-
shed Agreement goal: Expand public 
access to the Bay and its tributaries 
through existing and new local, State 
and Federal parks, refuges, reserves, 
trails, and partner sites. 
Communities across the globe are 
asking their leaders to consider how 
their policy decisions affect all of their 
constituents. The Great American Out-
doors Act expands our opportunities 
for growth as a nation. This historic 
legislation represents the product of 
concerted bipartisan effort to invest in 
our Nation’s future. By investing in 
our National Parks and other similar 
assets, we are helping to conserve our 
natural environment and create edu-
cational, accessible spaces for future 
generations of visitors. I am proud of 
what this body has accomplished and 
urge enactment of the Great American 
Outdoors Act into law. 
I do have one regret. I understand the 
legislation represents a carefully craft-
ed compromise, but I think it is unfor-
tunate that Senators have not been 
able to offer amendments to the bill. I 
filed an amendment, S. Amdt. 1636, to 
establish a Fallen Journalists Memo-
rial here in Washington, DC. June 28 
will mark the 2-year anniversary of the 
fatal shooting that occurred at the of-
fices of the Capital Gazette, a news-
paper serving Annapolis, MD. I based 
my amendment on legislation I intro-
duced, S. 1969, the Fallen Journalists 
Memorial 
Act, 
which 
Senator 
PORTMAN, Senator MANCHIN, and 10 
other Senators have cosponsored. The 
amendment reflects changes the House 
Natural Resources Committee made 
when it marked up the bill and ordered 
it to be reported favorably by voice 
vote. 
The 
changes 
the 
committee 
made, in turn, reflect input from stake-
holders including the National Park 
Service, which supports the bill. The 
legislation is bipartisan, noncontrover-
sial, and does not impose any cost to 
taxpayers. The memorial would serve 
as a fitting tribute to the Gazette’s 
staff and to all other journalists who 
have died in the line of duty and to our 
Nation’s commitment to a free press. I 
hope that I can work with Senators 
MURKOWSKI and MANCHIN, the chair and 
ranking member of the Senate Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee, re-
spectively, to secure this bill’s passage 
as soon as possible. 
Ms. CANTWELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, in a 
few minutes, we are going to be voting 
to pass the Great American Outdoors 
Act, and before this bill crosses the fin-
ish line, I thought it would be a good 
opportunity to reflect upon all the 
work that it took to get us here today. 
You see my colleagues around. This 
has truly been a labor of love from all 
of us who love the outdoors. If there is 
one thing we have found about the out-
doors, it is no matter whether you are 
a Democrat or a Republican, you love 
it. We all participate in it; we all enjoy 
it; and we want to pass it on to our 
children and grandchildren and next 
generations to come.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3036 
June 17, 2020 
I am proud to be joined by every 
Member of the Democratic caucus in 
supporting this legislation to perma-
nently fund the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund and to put $9.5 billion 
toward maintenance backlogs on our 
treasured public lands, and I am very 
appreciative and very proud to be 
working with our Republican friends 
who are joining us to support the Great 
American Outdoors Act. It truly has 
been bipartisanship at its best, and it 
is something we need so much more of. 
Passing permanent LWCF authoriza-
tion last year was an important step, 
but securing a permanent, dedicated 
funding source for the multiple con-
servation programs funded by the 
LWCF has been the ultimate goal of 
the Democratic leaders of the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee all the way back to Senator Jeff 
Bingaman. So it goes back quite a 
ways. 
Many other Senators, Democratic 
and Republican, Members of the House, 
both retired and here today, have been 
champions for the LWCF and helped to 
pave the way to where we are today. 
We are within striking distance of real-
izing the goal of permanent, manda-
tory funding, especially since we have 
only seen the full funding twice in 55 
years. To have it now, where it is going 
to be permanent, and the $21 billion 
that went down the black hole, that 
will no longer happen. We will be able 
to make sure that the projects in all of 
our wonderful States—and I think al-
most every county in the country is 
going to benefit. It is on a personal 
basis. It truly is a long, hard-fought 
caucus achievement, and I am incred-
ibly proud that as the current ranking 
member of the Senate Energy and Na-
tional Resources Committee, as a spon-
sor of the LWCF Permanent Funding 
Act, and one of the lead Democrats on 
this bill to be part of getting this legis-
lation done. 
I have my good friend Senator HEIN-
RICH of New Mexico, who has worked so 
hard. Then we have had Senator CANT-
WELL. We have had Senator RON WYDEN 
and all who have been former chairs of 
the committees or ranking members. 
On the Republican side, all my col-
leagues there will be speaking on be-
half of bringing so many people to-
gether. 
So its time has come. It is a testa-
ment to the importance of this historic 
conservation 
legislation 
that 
has 
brought so many of us together in sup-
port. Something this impactful doesn’t 
happen overnight. It takes time and 
hard work. I would like to recognize 
the work of my colleagues and thank 
them again. 
We had a lot of votes. We have had a 
lot of votes that we have had to shep-
herd through and make sure that ev-
erybody understood how important, 
how historic, and the timing of some-
thing—to be able to say that you were 
in this body, you were able to vote and 
participate on a piece of legislation so 
our country, the United States of 
America, is going to be able to share 
with every inhabitant we have and all 
the visitors coming from around the 
world for years and years and genera-
tions to come, that is pretty historic. 
To have that happen, I think, is one of 
the most important things we have 
done in the conservation world in the 
last 50 years. 
So we are very proud of that. Sixty of 
my Senate colleagues have cosponsored 
the Great American Outdoors Act, and 
20 more joined us last week, resulting 
in strong bipartisan votes to begin con-
sideration of the historic bill. The 
beauty of our Nation’s great outdoors 
truly brings them together. 
All of us have been able to speak and 
show you pictures of our wonderful, 
beautiful States. These are some beau-
tiful pictures from my beautiful State 
of West Virginia. This is Cheat River 
Canyon here. Anybody who has ever 
rafted that or hiked it or been on top 
and looked down to the beautiful vista, 
this is just truly as rugged as it looks 
right here. It is something gorgeous 
when you pass through it on a raft. It 
is really unbelievable. 
I would invite everybody to come and 
visit. We are only a 5-hour drive from 
about half the population of the United 
States, right here in West Virginia. 
This other photo is of the Dolly Sods 
Wilderness, a beautiful place. This is 
what we call Bear Rocks. I have a lit-
tle, little place right down in the 
Canaan Valley area here, and I intend 
to be there this weekend with my fam-
ily. This is something we enjoy. This is 
an unbelievable vista here. Again, it is 
only 3 hours from Washington, DC, by 
driving. 
So we invite you all to West Virginia. 
We would love everybody to come visit 
and enjoy what sometimes we take for 
granted. When you have these types of 
views, you can never take that for 
granted, what the Good Lord gave us 
all. Every one of our States has so 
much to offer. 
At the end of the day, this is an op-
portunity for us to pass down a legacy 
to our kids, our grandkids, and of 
course generations to come. 
I believe this will be the most 
impactful nationwide conservation leg-
islation since the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund was first created over 
50 years ago. 
From what we have seen from the 
votes over the last week and a half, I 
anticipate we will see again today. It is 
a shining example of Democrats and 
Republicans coming together to put 
politics aside to do what is best for 
conserving this great Nation’s natural 
resources. 
So I would like to say thank you to 
all of them. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD a 
list of all of my staff who have worked 
on this. I am sure my friends on the 
Republican side would do the same be-
cause there has been a lot of effort put 
forth. People have worked long nights 
and long weekends to make this hap-
pen. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

Mr. MANCHIN. I have got David 
Brooks, who has been on the com-
mittee for 30 years. He probably knows 
more about this process. I know he is 
fretting over is every word right, is 
every comma in the right place, every 
dot in the right place, but we have con-
fidence in David and Sam Fowler and 
Renae Black doing a great job with the 
committee on the ranking member’s 
side. 
To every one of them who have 
worked so hard, thank you. God bless 
each and every one of them for a job 
well done, and it is something that we 
can all take pride in. 
Someone said: How was your work in 
the Capitol? I said: We had a great 
week. We had a great week, and today 
is going to be the culmination of that 
great week. 
So I want to thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent, for allowing me to make these 
comments. I want to make sure we 
enter into the RECORD all the people 
who deserve the credit. I want to thank 
my colleagues for being here also. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleague from the great 
State of West Virginia for his work on 
this over the past many, many years, 
as we have worked on, individually, the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund 
and the Restore Our Parks Act, for his 
leadership on the Energy and Natural 
Resources committee. I am grateful to 
Senator MANCHIN for his leadership and 
friendship. 
So many people worked on this to-
gether: Senator BURR and the work he 
did, tirelessly, year after year, on the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund; of 
course, 
Senator 
HEINRICH, 
Senator 
WARNER, Senator PORTMAN, Senator 
ALEXANDER on the Restore Our Parks 
Act, Senators KING, CANTWELL—all cru-
cial to the success this bill will see 
today—Senators across both sides of 
the aisle coming together for what one 
newspaper in Colorado described as the 
holy grail of conservation legislation. 
But it is the staff as well. I start with 
Senator DAINES and his leadership on 
the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, the Restore Our Parks Act, his

great team of David Cleary, Allison 
Martin, and Anna Newton; Senator 
CANTWELL’s, Amit Ronen; and Senator 
MCCONNELL, Terry Van Doren. 
Obviously, for the floor time, I am 
very grateful to Senator MCCONNELL 
for bringing us to the floor to allow 
this debate to take place over the last 
week and a half and the work that we 
did to achieve and secure the Presi-
dent’s support for the Great American 
Outdoors Act. 
Senator HEINRICH, Lio Barrera, Maya 
Hermann; 
Senator 
MANCHIN, 
Lance 
West, Renae Black, David Brooks; Sen-
ator BURR’s staff of Natasha Hickman, 
Joshua Bowlen; and of course on my 
team, the outstanding work—they have 
to overcome a lot working with me, 
Ashley 
Higgins, 
Spencer 
Hamilton, 
Dustin Sherer, Jennifer Lorain, and 
Curtis Swager. I am grateful to all of 
them for their work and their support. 
The Great American Outdoors Act is 
the culmination of two things that 
have taken this Congress a long time 
to be able to pass. In fact, we tried last 
Congress to get it out of the House, and 
we couldn’t do it alone under the Re-
store Our Parks Act. We tried and we 
got pieces and parts of the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund done, but we 
couldn’t quite get the whole thing 
until we brought these two bills to-
gether. 
Senator 
MANCHIN, 
Senator 
BURR, 
Senator DAINES—the whole group of 
people whom I mentioned, working bi-
partisan across the aisle to make this 
happen. 
The two bills together will help cre-
ate significant opportunity for all of 
America. This isn’t a bill that just ben-
efits the East or the West. This isn’t a 
bill that just benefits the coastal 
States or the interior States. 
This is a chart that shows the States 
that benefit from the Great American 
Outdoors Act. The States that are in 
green shows who benefits from the 
Great American Outdoors Act. The 
States in orange are the States that do 
not get the benefit from the Great 
American Outdoors Act. 
There are no States in orange. The 
entire country, from Alaska and Ha-
waii to Florida and Maine and every-
where in between, benefits from the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
We know this is going to create jobs 
across the country: $495 million dollars 
a year in the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund. For every $1 million a 
year invested in the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, it supports be-
tween 16 and 30 jobs. This bill will as-
sure full and permanent funding in the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund— 
$900 million a year—the opportunity to 
create between 16 and 30 jobs for every 
$1 million spent. 
On national parks, you think about 
the national park economic benefits. In 
2018, economic benefits from national 
park visitor spending increased by over 
$2 billion. If you look at the number of 
just in Colorado alone, we had 7.6 mil-
lion national park visitors. Those visi-
tors helped create 7,000—over 7,000 jobs 
paying over $258 million in income. 
Overall, we know this bill on the 
park side alone will create over 100,000 
jobs—100,000 jobs in the communities 
that were hardest hit by the first waves 
of the coronavirus; communities in our 
public lands that saw their ski areas 
shut down, their outfitters canceled. 
This will create jobs and oppor-
tunity. In Colorado, thousands of jobs 
will be created by this portion of the 
bill alone. 
You know, it has been said by some 
of our greatest advocates that within 
our national parks is room—glorious 
room—in which to find ourselves, in 
which to think and hope, to dream and 
plan, to rest and resolve. 
In 1893, Katharine Lee Bates visited 
Colorado Springs and climbed up Pikes 
Peak. While looking out over the land, 
she wrote a poem that we all know 
very well. She wrote the words to 
‘‘America the Beautiful’’—of spacious 
skies and amber waves of grain. She 
talked about purple mountain maj-
esties. 
Our lands define who we are—our 
struggles and triumphs, our homes and 
our futures. From the solemnity of the 
redwoods to the vastness of the ever-
glades, they inspire us and give us 
space to dream. In Hawaii, these lands 
crackle as new Earth forms from mol-
ten rock. In Pennsylvania, they bear 
the blood of a nation on the hallowed 
grounds of Gettysburg and Flight 93. In 
Colorado, they are a testament to prai-
rie and peak, to plateau and pioneer. 
From sea to shining sea, our public 
lands are the story of America. 
All 
of 
these 
lands—every 
single 
acre—tell the story of a nation formed 
out of hope for fairness, justice, equal-
ity, and freedom. Acre after acre shows 
our Nation’s continued struggle to 
form a more perfect Union, a nation 
never content but committed to learn-
ing from the mistakes of the past to 
become a better place tomorrow than 
we are today, and to assure the Na-
tion’s greatest treasure, our youth, has 
these lands to learn from, to live with, 
and to prosper on for generations to 
come. Long after this Congress ad-
journs, they will give life to America, 
these great and wild places. 
In just a few minutes, we will take a 
vote on a very historic piece of legisla-
tion, and I hope that my colleagues 
will find it within them to vote yes on 
this important piece of legislation for 
generations to come. 
I yield the floor to Senator HEINRICH. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from Colorado. I 
really thank my colleague from West 
Virginia and the incredible teamwork 
that has played out here on the U.S. 
Senate floor. 
This is a time in our country when 
we don’t always have that kind of 
teamwork. Let’s be honest. This has 
been a year when much of the country 
has been divided, but we have been able 
to come together around the one thing 
that truly unites us. Certainly, in hav-
ing lived through the last 3 months, 
when many people have been shuttered 
in their homes for weeks and weeks at 
a time, I think it has really driven 
home for many of us that the outdoors 
is not just a luxury but is something 
we need. 
I see we are now joined by my col-
league from Montana as well, who did 
great work on this, which also drives 
home the fact that nothing around 
here gets done by one single individual 
or one party. It gets done when we 
come together. 
I want to take just a minute and 
thank Senator Jeff Bingaman, who 
held my seat before I did, who made 
this the centerpiece of his work while 
he was in the Senate and plowed the 
ground on which we walk today. 
I thank all of my staff, especially 
Maya Hermann and Lio Barrera, for all 
of their good work. I also thank Sen-
ator GARDNER for recognizing all of 
those on our staff—all of the good peo-
ple who made this happen. 
In New Mexico, we have protected 
such incredible landscapes with the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
The Valles Caldera—New Mexico’s Yel-
lowstone—is known for its herds of elk, 
its hot springs, its enormous volcanic 
caldera, and places like Ute Mountain 
that wouldn’t be in the public trust 
were it not for the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. 
I was so proud to work with Senator 
LAMAR
ALEXANDER
on a bill called 
Every Kid Outdoors. This is the bill 
that will allow us to make sure that 
every kid will be within walking dis-
tance of a neighborhood park. 
I hope that all of our colleagues will 
find it in their hearts to support this 
legislation today and will send a strong 
message to the House of Representa-
tives to take up this legislation quick-
ly. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, all postcloture time 
has expired. 
The amendment was ordered to be 
engrossed and the bill to be read a 
third time. 
The bill was read the third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall the bill pass? 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Cloture 
having been invoked, the Senate will 
proceed to executive session to con-
sider the following nomination, which 
the clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of 
Justin Reed Walker, of Kentucky, to be 
United States Circuit Judge for the 
District of Columbia Circuit. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this 
morning, the Senate narrowly invoked 
cloture on the nomination of Justin 
Walker to the DC Circuit. Within the 
week, the Senate is expected to con-
firm, by the thinnest margins, both 
Judge Walker and a separate nominee, 
Cory Wilson, to the Fifth Circuit. That 
fills the final two available seats on 
the circuit courts. In one case, there 
isn’t a vacancy yet, but he is preemp-
tively filling it. This will complete 
Leader MCCONNELL’s rush to pack our 
appellate 
courts 
with 
President 
Trump’s nominees. 
I want to speak about this because I 
have had more experience on nomina-
tions, only because of tenure, than 
anybody else in this body. I note that 
both Judge Walker and Judge Wilson 
are partisan ideologues who have given 
no indication that they will leave their 
politics outside the courtroom. This 
has become par for the course under 
this President—choosing nominees not 
for their judicial qualifications and in 
spite of their political leanings but be-
cause of those partisan leanings. Ex-
treme partisanship has become a quali-
fier, not a disqualifier. It is a pre-
requisite. 
My Republican friends may consider 
these confirmations a great achieve-
ment; however, I fear that the damage 
left in the wake of their effort—to the 
courts, to the Senate, to the country— 
is going to remain with us for years to 
come after most of us have probably 
left this body. 
Let us consider the backdrop in 
which we consider these nominees. We 
are in the throes of a global pandemic 
that has taken almost 120,000 American 
lives. It has plunged our economy into 
a deep recession. It has deprived nearly 
45 million Americans of their jobs, 
something I have never seen in my 
years here in the Senate. Yet are we 
here today considering legislation that 
further assists Americans struggling 
during this pandemic? Indeed, we have 
done nothing to respond to COVID–19 
for months even though the House 
passed $3 trillion in further assistance 
last month. 
The Senate today is not working to-
gether to find bipartisan meaningful 
ways to address the plagues of racial 
and social inequality, despite the fact 
that we see millions of Americans of 
all backgrounds, ages, creed, and color 
who flood our streets and squares with 
protests in the wake of the murder of 
George Floyd.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3039 
June 17, 2020 
What are we doing to respond as a 
body? We are busy processing and con-
firming an endless stream of partisan 
ideologues, such as Justin Walker and 
Cory Wilson, to our Federal courts. I 
think it has to be noted, again, that 
Judge Walker, who is a protege of Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, has been nominated 
to a seat that isn’t even vacant until 
September. 
It would be one thing if we were com-
ing together in the Senate across party 
lines to confirm mainstream nominees, 
something we have done so many times 
in years past, but nothing about Judge 
Walker and Judge Wilson is main-
stream. Judge Walker is not shy about 
his overt partisanship. He is openly 
hostile to the Affordable Care Act, 
even though the Affordable Care Act 
has provided a critical lifeline to mil-
lions of Americans during this pan-
demic. He has dangerously suggested 
that the FBI Director—whom we pro-
vided with a 10-year term to avoid 
politicization—‘‘must think of himself 
as an agent of the President.’’ One can 
see why President Trump is interested 
in a nominee like him. People should 
worry about somebody who would want 
the FBI Director—who is supposed to 
treat everybody the same and just up-
hold the law—to be, instead, an instru-
ment of whoever is present. Even if we 
ignore his hyperpartisan writings and 
countless cable news appearances be-
fore he became a district court judge— 
and that was just a few months ago, 
last fall—he has already shown he does 
not leave politics at the door when he 
puts on his robes. Even his judicial in-
vestiture ceremony could have been a 
lead-in for a Trump campaign rally, 
where he lamented that his legal prin-
ciples have not yet prevailed and 
feared losing ‘‘our courts and this 
country’’ to his critics. These may be 
the words of Judge Walker, but they 
are not the words of any other judge I 
have ever known, Republican, Demo-
crat, Independent. This judge wears his 
partisanship as a badge of honor, know-
ing that it will only appeal to a Presi-
dent who knows nothing of the role of 
the Federal judiciary and, sadly, know-
ing it will not deter this Senate from 
confirming him. 
Judge Cory Wilson is no better. 
Again, I spoke about the Affordable 
Care Act, which has provided help to 
millions 
of 
Americans 
during 
the 
coronavirus epidemic. What does he 
call it? He calls the Affordable Care 
Act 
‘‘perverse’’ 
and 
‘‘illegitimate.’’ 
Golly, how would he vote on that? I 
wonder if those Americans—Repub-
licans and Democrats alike—who are 
receiving lifesaving care through the 
ACA would call the law perverse. 
He has attacked President Obama in 
ugly, personal terms, berating him as a 
‘‘fit-throwing teenager’’ and ‘‘shrill, 
dishonest, 
and 
intellectually 
bank-
rupt.’’ That is a good attitude to hold 
when you are coming to the Senate as 
a Federal judge where you are supposed 
to be impartial. Such baseless accusa-
tions were laughable when he made 
them. They are beyond parody today. 
Judge Wilson has a long record of un-
dermining minority voting rights and 
dismissing the scourge of voter sup-
pression, which we saw again last week 
during primary elections. He dismisses 
that as ‘‘phony,’’ even though every-
body watching the news, from the right 
to left, can see it happening. 
What message do these nominees of 
President Trump send to the country 
in this moment? Well, it says that the 
Republicans in the Senate are fast- 
tracking nominees who are eager to 
overturn the Affordable Care Act in the 
midst of a public health pandemic. 
They are fast-tracking nominees who 
are dismissive of racial injustices in 
the midst of a national reckoning on 
racial injustices. 
The Senate has a constitutional duty 
to provide advice and consent to a 
President’s nominee. When I came to 
the Senate, that meant something. It 
meant something under both Repub-
lican leadership and Democratic lead-
ership. It meant something with both 
Republican and Democratic Presidents. 
But under this President, that con-
stitutional duty has meant no more 
than serving as a mindless conveyer 
belt to rubberstamp nominees, however 
unqualified, 
however 
extreme, 
and 
however inappropriate at the moment. 
You couldn’t have two more inappro-
priate nominees at a time when we 
need 
healthcare 
because 
of 
the 
coronavirus or so inappropriate at a 
time when we are trying to do away 
with racial tensions and address the ra-
cial tensions of our country. It says 
that we don’t believe in our standing as 
a coequal branch of government and 
that the Senate is willing to have that 
position as a coequal branch of govern-
ment diminished. 
Worse is the damage we inflict upon 
our courts. The Senate has now re-
shaped our Federal courts, especially 
our appellate courts, to resemble an ex-
treme partisan arm of the Republican 
Party. 
For 
generations, 
Americans 
have valued our judiciary for its inde-
pendence, a place where all Ameri-
cans—of any political party or back-
ground, race, or belief—believed they 
could obtain fair and impartial justice. 
That is changing every day under 
President Trump. 
When I tried cases before Federal 
courts at the district level or the ap-
pellate level—and the same with State 
courts at the trial level and the appel-
late level—I never worried that I would 
come before that court and my polit-
ical beliefs would in any way affect the 
outcome. What I thought would affect 
the outcome would be the facts and the 
law. I have appeared before courts of 
appeals and Federal courts of appeals. 
Most of the time I had no idea what the 
political position or political party of 
the judge was. Yet today, anybody who 
comes in trying a case or appealing a 
case has to say: No matter what my 
facts are or no matter what the law is, 
I have to face a partisan ideology with 
a judge who is supposed to be non-
partisan. We have seen fair and impar-
tial justice, as I said, changing every 
day under President Trump. 
I have to hope that the Senate can 
rediscover its better angels. I can hope 
that we can again reassert ourselves as 
the crucible in which the great issues 
of the day are debated heatedly but re-
solved amicably, across party lines. I 
hope that one day the Senate will 
again serve as the conscience of the 
Nation, as it has during so many mo-
ments of upheaval and uncertainty in 
our history. 
Today, more than any other time 
since I have been here, when we should 
be the conscience of the Nation, we are 
keeping that conscience locked up be-
hind closed doors. 
I hope, one day soon, the Senate will 
again demand—as it has under Repub-
lican and Democratic leadership in the 
past—that 
our 
President’s 
judicial 
nominees are deserving of lifetime ap-
pointments to our Federal courts, pos-
sessing the qualifications and tempera-
ment that, until now, were rarely in 
question and now, time and again, are 
in question. 
I ask my colleagues to go back to 
being the U.S. Senate. We owe it to 
ourselves. We owe it to the Constitu-
tion. Most of all, we owe it to the 
American people. Let the Senate once 
again be the conscience of the Nation, 
as it should be. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Mr. President, I also looked at the 
policing bill that Senator SCOTT an-
nounced today and Leader MCCONNELL 
will proceed to next week. I am still re-
viewing the text. From the descrip-
tions I have heard, the bill may be 
well-intentioned but falls far short on 
the reforms we need. It fails to meet 
this moment. That doesn’t mean we 
can’t come together and make it meet 
this moment. 
We need more than a Rose Garden 
signing of an Executive order that has 
no authority and does nothing except 
look good. Millions of Americans in 
both 
parties 
are 
demanding 
real 
change. This moment doesn’t call for a 
handful of studies and some grant pro-
grams; it calls for fundamental reforms 
to ensure our accountability and re-
store our trust. It requires a thoughtful 
debate, a real debate in which we have 
a real amendment process. Let Sen-
ators stand up and vote yes or no on 
amendments. Let the American people 
know where they stand. Let them take 
a position. 
If our Republican leadership won’t 
commit to such a real debate and such 
real 
votes 
or 
amendments—a 
real 
amendment 
process—they 
fail 
the 
American people at a critical time; 
they fail them in favor of partisan poli-
tics. 
Each one of us has to cast votes on 
this floor. Some are very routine and 
easy to do, but so many are monu-
mental. We have to speak to our con-
science. We have to speak to our back-
ground. We have to speak to who we 
are. I will look at my background as a 
former prosecutor. I will look at my

chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. I will look at my background 
as one who has listened to Republicans 
and Democrats alike in my State, but 
then I will call upon my conscience to 
vote for what is best. 
Don’t fail the American people by 
having something that feels good, that 
says nice things but doesn’t make any 
change. If there were ever a time 
America needs changes—we have two 
crises. One, of course, is COVID–19, and 
we are not addressing that. The other 
is, once again, every American, of all 
races, has to look at racism in policing. 
We are better than that. Most of our 
police departments want to be better 
than that. 
Let us stand up. Let the U.S. Senate 
be the conscience of the Nation. Again, 
I note we have been in the past. 
Wouldn’t it be nice to be so in the

I yield the floor.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
THE GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to celebrate the passage of the 
Great American Outdoors Act. The pas-
sage of this historic legislation marks 
a once-in-a-generation step by this 
body to restore and conserve our na-
tional parks, as well as our country’s 
national heritage. It builds on an 
American tradition of conserving our 
natural wonders and shared public 
spaces. It reaffirms our commitment to 
preserve them for future generations. 
It is also important to note that this 
is a jobs bill. According to a recent 
study, the Great American Outdoors 
Act will help create or support 100,000 
jobs all over the country, including 
10,000 in my home State of Virginia, at 
a time when millions of Americans are 
out of work. 
Currently, the National Park Service 
has a deferred maintenance backlog of 
$12 billion. A chronic lack of funding 
from Congress has forced the Park 
Service to defer maintenance on count-
less 
trails, 
buildings, 
and 
historic 
structures, as well as thousands of 
miles of roads and bridges. Today, over 
half of all Park Service assets are in 
desperate need of repair. 
To address these needs, a little over 3 
years ago, I approached my colleague 
and friend, Senator ROB PORTMAN, with 
an idea. What if we took unobligated 
Federal energy revenues and used them 
to address the maintenance backlogs at 
our national parks. So we came to-
gether, in a bipartisan partnership, and 
introduced the National Park Services 
Legacy Act. A little over a year later, 
we combined our efforts with Senator 
ALEXANDER and Senator KING to intro-
duce our Restore Our Parks Act. Ear-
lier this year, this legislation was com-
bined with Senator GARDNER and Sen-
ator MANCHIN’s Land and Water Con-
servation Fund legislation to form the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
This legislation represents one of the 
largest investments in the infrastruc-
ture of our national parks in its over 
100-year history. Over the next 5 years, 
the Great American Outdoors Act will 
fund more than half of all the deferred 
repairs and completely fund the Park 
Service’s highest priority needs. As my 
friend from Maine, Senator KING, has 
noted, deferred maintenance is really 
simply a debt for future generations. 
With the passage of this bill today, we 
are one step closer to paying down that 
debt. 
Few States in the country are as im-
pacted by the Park Service’s deferred 
maintenance backlog as the Common-
wealth of Virginia. In the Common-
wealth, we have a maintenance backlog 
of over $1.1 billion. That is the third 
largest behind California and DC. I 
want to give a few examples of how 
this legislation will help preserve our 
historical heritage and create jobs in 
my State. 
Here in the National Capital Region, 
the 
George 
Washington 
Memorial 
Parkway, which is managed by the Na-
tional Park Service, has over $700 mil-
lion in deferred maintenance. As a 
matter of fact, anyone in this Chamber 
who travels on that road actually 
knows that we had a sinkhole appear in 
the parkway within the last year—an 
enormous safety threat, as well as an 
enormous inconvenience to anybody 
who travels on this important road. 
Our legislation would help rebuild this 
critical transportation route between 
Virginia, Washington, DC, and Mary-
land—reducing traffic and, again, cre-
ating jobs. 
Further south on I–95, the Richmond 
National Battlefield Park has over $5 
million in deferred maintenance. The 
nearby Maggie L. Walker National His-
toric Site—this is the site actually of 
the first African-American-owned bank 
created by Maggie Walker, as well as 
the first bank owned by an African- 
American woman. I visited it last year, 
and it has maintenance needs ap-
proaching $1 million. At the nearby Pe-
tersburg National Battlefield Park, the 
maintenance needs have grown to $9 
million over the years. This legislation 
will help support critical infrastruc-
ture needs of these parks, preserving 
these important pieces of our heritage 
while again supporting our local econo-
mies. 
Let me take you a little farther west, 
out to one of the real gems of our Na-
tional Park Service—probably one of 
the parks best known in Virginia 
around the country—and that is the 
Shenandoah National Park. It is one of 
the crown jewels of our Park Service. 
Again, the maintenance backlog there 
in the Shenandoah sits at over $90 mil-
lion. Our legislation will put people to 
work on these overdue repairs, includ-
ing to Skyline Drive and stretches of 
the Appalachian Trail, which are really 
at the heart of Virginia’s outdoor tour-
ism industry. 
Let me take you a little farther down 
Skyline Drive, down farther in South-
west Virginia. As you head southwest, 
the Blue Ridge Parkway right here, 
which has accumulated over $500 mil-
lion in deferred maintenance—that is, 
as a matter of fact, over $1 million of 
deferred maintenance for every mile of 
the Blue Ridge Parkway. The Great 
American Outdoors Act will, again, put 
Virginians to work on these repairs so 
visitors can continue to appreciate the 
beauty of Southwest Virginia and sup-
port the local economy. 
Let me end my visual tour of Vir-
ginia going to the eastern part of the 
Commonwealth. This is one final exam-
ple. Colonial National Historical Park, 
which is home to historic Jamestown 
and the Yorktown battlefield—some of 
our country’s most significant sites 
from the birth of our Nation. At this 
park and along the Colonial Parkway, 
there are deferred maintenance needs 
totaling over $430 million. With this 
legislation, the wait on many of these 
repairs is over. We are going to create 
jobs, make sure this important part of 
our history is around for years to 
come, and make sure we leave our kids 
and grandkids that sense of who we are 
as a nation. 
Now, before I close, I want to touch 
on the other half of this legislation, 
which provides full mandatory funding 
for the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, the LWCF. 
For decades, the LWCF has been the 
most important tool of the Federal 
Government that States have had to 
protect critical natural areas, water re-
sources, and, again, cultural heritage. 
Virginia has received over $368 million 
in LWCF funding, which has helped 
preserve and expand critical recreation 
areas within the Commonwealth. 
For example, the American Battle-
field Protection Program, which is 
funded through the LWCF, has been 
vital for communities across Virginia, 
providing them with technical assist-
ance and funding to help them preserve 
their history and, again, attract tour-
ists. LWCF has also allowed us to ex-
pand and preserve land within the 
George Washington and Jefferson Na-
tional Forests and along the Appa-
lachian Trail. These efforts support the 
health of unique wildlife habitats and 
provide new access for hunting, fishing, 
and other outdoor recreation. 
Through this combination of the 
parks bill and the permanent funding 
for the LWCF, the Great American 
Outdoors Act ensures that we will con-
tinue to make these important invest-
ments in conservation in our parks for 
years to come. 
In closing, I thank my colleagues, 
again, for supporting this historic leg-
islation with an overwhelmingly bipar-
tisan vote and a piece of legislation

that is supported by the administra-
tion. My hope is that the House will 
move quickly on this. What better 
present to our Nation than to have this 
legislation signed into law, hopefully, 
by July 4. 
As we all know, at a time of signifi-
cant division in our country, the fact 
that this body was able to come to-
gether and pass this bill with over 70 
votes gives me a little bit of hope. 
Again, I am proud of my colleagues for 
stepping up to restore our national 
parks and public lands, and as I men-
tioned at the outset, this legislation 
will create over 100,000 jobs, jobs that 
are extraordinarily needed at this crit-
ical moment when our economy has 
been shattered. So for current Ameri-
cans and future Americans, job well 
done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the order for the quorum call be 
rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I woke up this morning, 
Wednesday morning, June 17, 2020, and 
for so many Americans, this is just an-
other Wednesday morning. You wake 
up; you get ready for work—but not in 
South Carolina. 
In South Carolina, this Wednesday, 
June 17, is the fifth anniversary of 
when a racist walked into Mother 
Emanuel Church, sat through a Bible 
study for an hour and listened to be-
lievers talk about their love of God. At 
the end of that Bible study, he pulled 
out a weapon and killed nine people. So 
for me and so many South Carolinians, 
this is a hard day. 
I will tell you this: Standing on this 
floor, remembering the words of one of 
the victims’ son, Daniel Simmons, Jr., 
5 years ago on a Wednesday, 1 week 
later—I asked Daniel Simmons, Jr., 
whose father, Daniel Simmons, Sr., had 
been killed in an attempt to start an-
other race war at the home of the Civil 
War: What should I say to the people 
who would be watching around the 
country? 
He said what I could not believe. It 
was this: Please remind them of Ro-
mans 8:28—that all things work to-
gether for good for those who love God 
and are called according to His pur-
pose. 
I was standing at those doors on my 
cell phone. I could not believe the 
words he was speaking. In an act of 
true, unconditional love, he inspired 
me. He encouraged me. He taught me 
lessons of strength and courage and 
mercy our Nation needs to remember. 
I came to the floor today to speak 
about my new bill, the JUSTICE Act, 
our Republican response to police re-
form. I was sitting in my office when 
the Senator from Illinois talked about 
the ‘‘token’’ legislation on this day, 
the day that we remember Mother 
Emanuel Church and the nine lost lives 
and my friend, the pastor of the 
church, Clementa Pinckney—the first 
person ever to call me a Senator, the 
pastor of that church, a Democrat pas-
tor of that church said to me ‘‘My Sen-
ator,’’ in December of 2012—and reflect 
back on the fact that I have on my 
phone today the text for Clementa in 
which I said: Are you OK? He didn’t an-
swer because he was already dead. 
To think that on this day, as we try 
to make sure that fewer people lose 
confidence in this Nation, to have the 
Senator from Illinois refer to this proc-
ess, this bill, this opportunity to re-
store hope and confidence and trust to 
the American people, to African Amer-
icans, to communities of color—to call 
this a token process hurts my soul for 
my country, for our people. 
To think that the concept of anti- 
lynching that is a part of this legisla-
tion would be considered a token piece 
of legislation because, perhaps, I am 
African American and the only one on 
this side of the aisle—I don’t know 
what he meant, but I can tell you that, 
on this day, to hear those comments, 
again, hurts the soul. 
To think about how, in the same 
year, 2015, Walter Scott, in my home-
town of North Charleston, running 
away from the police, was shot five 
times in the back—I sponsored legisla-
tion then, and I don’t remember a sin-
gle person saying a single thing on that 
side of the aisle about helping to push 
forward more legislation on body cam-
eras. But, today, this is a token piece 
of legislation. I think it is important 
that we stand up and be counted and 
make sure that we have more resources 
available for every officer to have a 
body camera because, as we saw in 
Georgia with Mr. Arbery, had it not 
been caught on video; in Walter Scott’s 
case, had it not been caught on video; 
in George Floyd’s case, had it not been 
caught on video, we might be in a dif-
ferent place. 
On the other side, they are wanting 
to race-bait on tokenism, while this 
legislation would provide resources for 
body cameras, for anti-lynching, and 
for deescalation training. But, no, we 
can’t concern ourselves with the fami-
lies I sat with at the White House yes-
terday and in my office yesterday. In-
stead, we want to play politics because 
this is 2020, and we are far more con-
cerned about winning elections than we 
are about having a serious conversa-
tion on reform in this country. No, we 
would 
rather 
have 
a 
conversation 
about tearing this country apart, mak-
ing it a binary choice between law en-
forcement and communities of color in-
stead of working for the American peo-
ple, bringing the reforms to the table 
so that we have a chance to balance 
this Nation and direct her toward due 
north. No, that is too much to ask on 
June 17, 5 years later. 
I started this conversation on body 
cameras in 2015, in the Walter Scott 
Notification Act in 2015. But, no, we 
want to have a political conversation. I 
reject that. I reject that. 
I will tell you that I believe my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
are serious about police reform. There 
are just some who are more interested 
in scoring political points than they 
actually are in getting a result. 
It is not the majority of them. The 
majority of them have the same heart 
that we have for the American people. 
That is where we should be focusing 
our attention, not the color of my skin, 
not tokens. It is cool when you are out 
in the public. I get it all the time on 
Twitter. I am used to it. But on this 
day, my heart aches for my State. My 
heart aches for my uncle’s church, 
which he attended for 50 years before 
he passed. So I am a little riled up. 
I sit here quietly trying to pass good 
legislation that was based on the House 
bill because I knew that if I wanted a 
chance to get something done, we had 
to do it in a bipartisan fashion. I am 
not running for anything. I am not up 
for reelection. I am not trying to sup-
port someone for their victory. I am 
simply saying to the families I met 
with yesterday at the White House 
without a camera and in my office yes-
terday without a camera: I hear you. 
We see you. You are not simply sitting 
there silent. We are working on seri-
ous, tangible, measurable results. 
Why is that not enough? Why can’t 
we just disagree on the three or four 
items that we disagree upon? Why 
can’t I say what I have been saying, 
which is that the House bill is, in fact, 
the blueprint for some progress? It goes 
too far for me in some areas, but, yes, 
I like the concept of more information. 
This is a good thing. The House does it; 
we do it. That is a good thing. I like 
the concept of more training. The 
House does it; we do it. I like the fact 
that we are looking for a way to ban 
choke holds. We do it by taking money 
from different departments; they do it 
in a different fashion. We are about 90 
percent there. 
But where do we go? Where do we go? 
People wonder why our country is so 
divided. It is because it is so easy to 
walk onto this floor and say ‘‘token’’ 
and send the same race-baiting mes-
sage that we have heard for a very long 
time. 
If you are a Democrat, hey, it is OK. 
That is not ever OK. It is not OK to say 
to our kids: You can’t think what you 
want to think and be who you want to 
be. If you are not in line with one idea 
and the way they think, it is bad news. 
Then you are a sellout. 
What message do you send the kids? 
I am going to be OK, but what message 
are we sending the kids throughout our 
country—that you can’t be taught just 
to think; we have to teach you how to 
think. That is the kind of conclusion 
that is wrong. It is toxic. It is pushing 
our country toward an implosion that 
is avoidable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3042 
June 17, 2020 
That is why I started my legislative 
day today with remembering Mother 
Emanuel. It is why I read my Bible 
next—because I knew I needed a little 
extra strength. That is why I turned 
immediately to my first interview try-
ing to talk about police reform be-
cause, as a guy who has been stopped 18 
times in the years of the 2000s, I take it 
seriously. Being stopped seven times in 
a single year, being stopped this year, 
being stopped last November, being 
stopped coming into the Senate with 
my pin on—sure, I get it. But I don’t 
point fingers at the other side, saying 
that they are just not serious about the 
issue. It is just not what we should do. 
I assume that everybody should be 
serious about the issue, but I have to 
tell you, it is with a heavy heart—it is 
with a heavy heart that I believe that, 
had we had more money for body cam-
eras, we would be in a different posi-
tion today than we were in 2015. But I 
didn’t have anybody who wanted to 
have this conversation or, at least, 
they didn’t have this conversation. 
I believe there are good people of 
good intent on the other side of the 
aisle. I think there are people of good 
intent on our side of the aisle. I think 
the fact is that most Americans are 
tired of Republicans and Democrats 
talking about Republicans and Demo-
crats. I think most Americans are tired 
of our talking about election outcomes 
and polls. ‘‘What about me?’’ is what 
they are saying. 
I am suggesting that this bill, the 
JUSTICE Act, is a serious nationwide 
effort tackling the issues of police re-
form, 
accountability, 
and 
trans-
parency. It is grounded in bipartisan 
principles because I believe that the 
other side has some stuff we have to 
hear and that our side has some stuff 
they need to hear. If we do that, we 
will have the votes to have a real de-
bate next week on this bill, but if we 
don’t do that, we will just talk about 
scoring political points, and you will 
go on MSNBC or CNN, and we will go 
on FOX, and everybody will have their 
chatter, and more people in the com-
munities of color will have less con-
fidence in the institutions of power and 
authority in this Nation because we 
missed the moment. We missed it 5 
years ago. We don’t have to miss it 
now. 
As you know, I am not really into 
theatrics. I don’t run toward micro-
phones. I have had a lot of them these 
last 7 days. I don’t talk a lot in con-
ference because, why say what other 
people are saying? They have probably 
said it better. I don’t demonize the 
other side because I know that in order 
to get anything done in this con-
ference, on this committee, in this 
Senate, you have to have 60 votes. 
Plus, if you have a grievance with your 
brother, talk to them. Talk to them. I 
have tried to do that. 
As I am sure I am running out of 
time, let me just say that the families 
I sat down with yesterday—they don’t 
think working on body cameras is a 
token experience. They don’t think sit-
ting down with the President of the 
United States, with tears filling their 
eyes, running down their cheeks, talk-
ing about their lost loved ones is a 
token experience. The law enforcement 
officers in that meeting with those 
families do not believe that having a 
serious conversation about police re-
form is a token experience. They don’t 
believe that coresponders for the one 
man who was in the room, whose son 
was having a mental episode, who was 
shot on the scene—he doesn’t think 
this was a token experience. 
Shame on us. Shame on us if we are 
unwilling to have a serious conversa-
tion about a serious issue that, in my 
opinion, is a greater threat to this Na-
tion than perhaps anything we have 
seen. We have never solved it because 
we are all having political points. That 
is wrong. It is just not right. 
Let me say to all of my colleagues, 
Senator LANKFORD, Senators CAPITO, 
SASSE, LINDSEY, BARRASSO, and ALEX-
ANDER: Thank you. Thank you for giv-
ing a voice to a serious issue. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, first, 
I would like to associate my remarks 
100 percent with everything Senator 
SCOTT just said. Somehow I am sup-
posed to speak after he just said it. 
The frustration that I have had over 
the past couple of days as we have 
worked very hard in pulling the legisla-
tion together is we have talked to peo-
ple all over. I have talked to people of 
all backgrounds all over Oklahoma. I 
have talked to members of the commu-
nity. I have talked to law enforcement. 
I have talked to leadership in law en-
forcement. We have worked to build a 
coalition of ideas, things that would 
pass, answering the question that TIM 
SCOTT started with: Could we pull to-
gether a piece of legislation that would 
actually help—not to just pass some-
thing so we can walk away, pat each 
other on the back and say ‘‘We passed 
something,’’ knowing quietly that it 
really isn’t going to make any dif-
ference? Is there something we could 
do that would actually make a dif-
ference? 
Over the weeks we have worked to 
identify what could pass, what could 
make a difference, what answers the 
questions everyone is asking. We didn’t 
look at whether it was a Republican or 
Democratic idea. We just asked the 
question, what would make the dif-
ference, because I don’t believe equal 
justice under the law is owned by a 
party. It has been fascinating to me, 
the questions I have had over the past 
couple of days as members of the media 
would quietly pull me aside and say: 
Hey, are Republicans going to be able 
to pass a bill on race? Quietly, they are 
asking the question: We know all those 
Republicans are racist, so are you 
going to be able to pull something off? 
That is really what they are saying in 
the background. Over and over again, I 
heard it through the media and have 
seen it put out there: You know those 
Republicans are all racist. I don’t 
think they are going to be able to pass 
something dealing with race. 
As this dividing message continues to 
go out, we continue to do our work be-
cause we also believe in equal justice 
under the law. As a friend of mine said 
to me a couple of weeks ago, we also 
believe we should be able to work to-
ward a more perfect Union. 
For me, it is not only a practical 
issue, not only a family issue; it is not 
only a friendship issue; it is not only a 
basic freedom and liberty issue; it is 
not just a constitutional issue. For me, 
it is also a Biblical issue. You can go 
back as many pages as you want to in 
Scripture and work your way from be-
ginning to end, and you are going to 
find some very consistent themes. 
Throughout the book of Deuteronomy, 
there is a statement about how God’s 
affection is ‘‘for equal weights and 
measures.’’ His first challenge to gov-
ernment when literally the Jews were 
establishing their first government, 
God spoke to them, saying, make sure 
there are equal weights and measures. 
It is a simple way of saying, whether 
you are rich or poor, whether you are a 
foreigner, whether you are a member, 
whether you are in or out, everyone is 
to be treated the same, equal weights, 
equal measures. Find that passage over 
and over and over again through the 
Old Testament. Read it all the way to 
the Book of the Revelation at the end. 
At the Book of Revelation at the end, 
there is a gathering around the throne 
that is pictured. At the very end, there 
is the gathering of the Kingdom of God. 
As they gather around the throne, it is 
described as every tribe, every nation, 
every language, every people, all gath-
ered. 
For me, this is a Biblical issue as 
well as being a personal issue, but for 
us as a nation, it is a legal issue. It is 
about where we find inconsistencies in 
the application of the law, we are to 
correct it, and we do what we can to 
make it right. 
This bill is designed with a simple 
statement in mind. How can we provide 
accountability, 
transparency, 
and 
training in law enforcement so that the 
good cops shine and those who are bad 
apples in the mix, the light shines on 
them. 
That is all we are asking. We want to 
see things change. People in my towns 
across my State want to see things 
change and want to know that this is 
not just a vote that is a partisan vote; 
it is a vote to actually get something 
solved. 
It wasn’t that long ago that this body 
was gathering and voted unanimously 
on an almost $3 trillion bill dealing 
with a major problem in America, 
COVID–19. Why don’t we get together 
again, hash out the issues, and unani-
mously come to some decisions again 
on a major problem in America, injus-
tice? 
We can’t pass something that bans 
racism. I wish we could. We would have

all taken that vote. We can’t ban rac-
ism. That is passed on through families 
and individuals. Children are not born 
racist. They are raised racist. Families 
have to make a decision about what 
they are going to do in their family. 
The national conversation about race 
doesn’t happen in this room. The na-
tional conversation on race happens in 
kitchens and dining rooms. 
We can do something about justice. 
There are simple things we tried to 
gather, a set of ideas that aren’t par-
tisan. They are ideas and solutions 
that have come from all over the place, 
some Democratic and some Repub-
lican, and we pulled these things to-
gether, and we are asking a simple 
question: Will our Democratic Mem-
bers take a vote with us next week to 
move to this bill to amend it, debate it, 
talk about it, have a real dialogue, and 
pass something that we think will 
work? Will this bill look exactly like 
this? It probably will look a lot like 
this because there are aspects of this 
that look like this in the House right 
now. Will there be additional ideas? 
Probably. Why don’t we debate it and 
talk about it? Why don’t we both open 
it up and discuss it and why don’t we 
actually try to solve it? 
There are things such as, if there is 
bodily injury or death in police cus-
tody, that all of that information has 
to come in to the FBI so we can dis-
seminate it and get transparency in 
the country. In fact, 40 percent of the 
departments report that, but a lot of 
them do not. 
There are a lot of places that do no- 
knock warrants. We don’t have infor-
mation about that. We know it is hap-
pening all over the country, and there 
is some conversation about maybe we 
should end part of it or keep part of it. 
What would that look like? We don’t 
have the information gathered. Why 
don’t we get information on no-knock 
warrants so that we can make an in-
formed decision and then act on it? 
Why don’t we deal with some basic 
problems that are out there that we 
have seen several times in some of the 
worst moments? Something happens, 
and law enforcement is not wearing a 
body camera, and it is one opinion 
against another opinion. Why don’t we 
get more body cameras in the streets, 
and why don’t we make sure those body 
cameras are actually turned on all the 
time? There is new technology in body 
cameras so that they automatically 
turn on when there is a call. Law en-
forcement doesn’t have to worry about, 
‘‘I forgot to turn it on.’’ It turns itself 
on. Why don’t we incentivize it to en-
courage new body cameras with auto-
matic features to turn it on so we al-
ways have footage? 
Why don’t we hold people to account 
if there is a false police report that is 
filed? In several cases of late, when the 
incident was over, a written police re-
port was filed. Later, cell phone video 
came out that was completely different 
from the original police report. Well, 
that is a false report. Why don’t we 
hold that bad apple to account? 
Why don’t we end choke holds? Most 
departments already have. Why don’t 
we just end it nationwide? Why don’t 
we say to departments: If you want to 
get a Federal grant for any law en-
forcement purpose, you can’t get that 
or you get a reduced amount or you get 
a big deduction unless your department 
has already banned choke holds. Basi-
cally, we lay the marker out there and 
say: We expect you to take action on 
this. 
Why don’t we deal with the issues 
that are before us that people are ask-
ing questions about, and where we lack 
information, let’s go get it. 
It was several years ago that Senator 
PETERS, on the Democratic side, and 
Senator CORNYN, on the Republican 
side, put out a proposal to have a Com-
mission study these issues and more, to 
gather information and make rec-
ommendations and to start passing leg-
islation in a unified way. It passed in 
the Senate unanimously and died in 
the House. Let’s bring that legislation 
back up. 
We tried to do some work in the Sen-
ate to head this off. Let’s do it again 
and see what we can actually do. Where 
we find departments that are recruit-
ing officers and the department doesn’t 
match the ethnicity of their commu-
nity, why don’t we provide grants for 
that community and that police de-
partment to be able to have a Black re-
cruiter recruit more Black officers and 
to help them financially in the earliest 
days through the police academy to 
make sure that department profile 
matches that community? 
One of the great gains of the last 30 
years has been community policing, al-
lowing officers to be able to get out of 
their car and meet their community 
and to engage so communities are po-
licing together. Why don’t we do that? 
I did a ride-along with an officer sev-
eral years ago, and I will never forget 
it. As we were riding through his com-
munity and his neighborhood where he 
always patrolled, we drove by an elder-
ly lady as sweet as she could be sitting 
on her front porch. As we drove by I 
asked: Does she sit out there every 
day? 
The police officer laughed and said: 
Yep, she sits out there every day. 
I asked: Have you ever stopped to 
meet her? 
He hesitated for a long time, and he 
said: No, I never have. 
Community policing does make a dif-
ference. When you get a chance to meet 
the people in the community, get to 
know them, and share the responsi-
bility together for actually working to 
solve problems that we face. 
We are laying down a set of ideas 
that we feel will make a difference, not 
just make a message. Other people 
have other ideas. Bring them. Let’s 
open it up. 
Let’s not have heated debate. Let’s 
have debate that solves the problems 
so that at the end of this, we know 
what we are solving. We solve it, and 
then we keep going. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for one, 
I would like to say something about 
Senator SCOTT. I know how hard it is 
to work on this, and it has not been an 
easy enterprise for Tim. He is a con-
servative Republican, who happens to 
be African-American, and he has de-
cided to take the lead on something 
that is very important to the country. 
He has had experiences that I don’t 
have. He has been stopped multiple 
times on Capitol Hill. I have never been 
stopped. One year, he was stopped 
seven times for lane changes. The point 
is that Tim believes—and every Afri-
can-American male I have talked to in 
the last couple of weeks is told early 
on, if you are stopped by the cops, 
watch what you do; keep your hands on 
the wheel and don’t go toward the dash 
because that could end badly. I don’t 
know how that happened, but it is real. 
For us not to realize that would be a 
huge mistake. 
Let me be on record as saying I un-
derstand that if you are an African- 
American male, your experience with 
the police is different than mine. It is 
unacceptable, and it needs to stop. 
So how do you stop it? You bring 
about change. So what kind of change 
are we looking for? Our Democratic 
friends have a list of changes. I think it 
is Justice in Policing. The House is 
marking it up. Here is what I would say 
to my Democratic colleagues: Stop lec-
turing me. You had 8 years under 
President Obama to do the things in 
the Justice in Policing Act, and 90 per-
cent of it you never brought up. I am 
not saying we are blameless, but there 
has not been this sense of urgency to 
deal with these problems institution-
ally like there is today. Why? Because 
of Mr. Floyd and a few other things all 
happening together. 
Tim said in 2016 we had our chance. 
These episodes come and they go. The 
question for the country is, Will any-
thing ever change? The only way it is 
going to change is to find common 
ground. So the proposal Senator SCOTT 
has collected, along with other col-
leagues, has bipartisan support, but if 
it is not enough, I am willing to listen 
regarding doing more. 
Senator SASSE was with me yester-
day. We had a 5-hour hearing, and I 
learned a lot. I learned that a police de-
partment looking like the community 
is important, Senator LANKFORD, but, 
more importantly, is that you live 
where you police. 
I asked a gentleman from New Jer-
sey: What is more important, race or 
community attachment? He said: Com-
munity attachment. You are less likely 
to hurt somebody in a community you 
feel a part of. 
Now, having said that, we need more 
African-American police personnel. We 
need more women. Apparently, women 
do their jobs a lot better than men. I 
haven’t heard one person come forward 
and say: I had a bad experience with a

policewoman. More women would be 
helpful. But the main thing is, we need 
people from the community being in 
charge of policing that community 
with a system that is more account-
able. 
So CORY BOOKER and I have worked 
together on a lot of things—great guy. 
TIM and CORY are good friends, and I 
admire the heck out of TIM SCOTT. I am 
not going to take any more time. He is 
one of the most decent people I have 
ever met, and we are lucky to have him 
in South Carolina and the country is 
lucky. 
The bottom line, as CORY said, there 
are two issues that have to be ad-
dressed or everything else doesn’t mat-
ter—242 and qualified immunity. I 
wrote them down. For those who are 
not conversant in 242 or qualified im-
munity, there is nothing wrong with 
you. This is a very archaic area of the 
law. Qualified immunity is a judicial 
doctrine that has developed over time 
that relates to the 1983 civil rights 
statute that allows people to sue gov-
ernmental entities for abuse of force, 
for excessive force. 
There is nothing in the statute about 
an objective standard where the rea-
sonably prudent police officer in the 
same circumstances acted accordingly. 
There is nothing about good faith. 
Justice Thomas is a pretty conserv-
ative guy. He wanted to revisit quali-
fied immunity. I don’t know how he 
would substantively come out on the 
issue, but in his dissent denying certio-
rari of the concept, he explains how 
this judicial concept has exploded be-
yond every attachment of common law 
analysis. This is Clarence Thomas. If 
you presented to me qualified immu-
nity in its current form as a legislative 
proposal, I would vote hell, no. Police 
officers need not worry about losing 
their house or being sued if they act in 
good faith in performing duties that 
are hard on any good day, but when po-
lice departments time and again fail to 
do the things necessary to instill good 
policing, I think they should be subject 
and accountable like any other busi-
ness. There is common ground here. 
Not one Democrat has suggested to 
me to make the individual officer civ-
illy liable under 242, but I had Demo-
crats suggest to me that the standard 
has become almost absolute immunity. 
The Presiding Officer has run all 
kinds of businesses. Being in the polic-
ing business is not your normal busi-
ness. There needs to be a filter when it 
comes to lawsuits. It can’t be about 
outcome. But it is now time, in my 
view, to look at the development of the 
qualified immunity doctrine as it re-
lates to the 1983 underlying statute and 
see if we could make it better, not gut 
it. 
To my Democratic friends, if you 
want to eliminate qualified immunity, 
it will be a very short conversation. If 
you want to reform it so that munici-
palities and agencies and organizations 
running police departments will have 
some protection but not absolute im-
munity, let’s talk. Maybe we can get 
there if it is that important. Let’s at 
least try. That is what the legislative 
process is all about. 
Section 242 allows the Federal Gov-
ernment to bring charges against an 
individual for denying another Amer-
ican their constitutional rights. This is 
about policing but not exclusive to po-
licing. 
The Presiding Officer is from Geor-
gia. I am from South Carolina. There 
was a time in the South where juries 
would nullify all the evidence in front 
of them because the victim was a Black 
man and the perpetrator was White. A 
mountain of evidence could be pre-
sented, and there would be an acquittal 
in like 15 minutes. So we came up with 
a concept to allow the Federal Govern-
ment to intervene in cases like that 
and hold somebody liable for violating 
the constitutional rights of another 
American under law Federal law. 
The standard to prosecute is ‘‘will-
ful.’’ You have to prove that the police 
officer willfully understood the con-
stitutional right and violated it. My 
friends on the other side want to lower 
the standard to ‘‘reckless.’’ What I 
would say is, this is not 1965. The police 
officer involved in Mr. Floyd’s death is 
going to be prosecuted. So while it is 
important to talk about section 242, 
most States where these events have 
occurred have acted responsibly. We 
don’t need the Federal Government sit-
ting in judgment of every cop in the 
country. What we do need is a system 
of accountability. I will talk to you 
about 242, but I think that is not the 
issue. 
What is the issue? It is that police 
departments that are immune from li-
ability when they engage in abusive 
conduct over and over are unlikely to 
change until that changes. You can 
throw all the money you want to at 
training and improving best practices, 
and they will gladly accept your 
money. If they don’t do it right, they 
don’t get the money. Add one thing to 
the mix. By the way, if you shoot a dog 
and you wind up killing a kid—your po-
lice officer shouldn’t have shot the dog 
anyway in a fashion to kill the kid who 
was right by the dog—you are going to 
wind up having your ass in court. That 
will change things. 
I have been a lawyer, and I know how 
people feel about this. If you are ex-
posed, in terms of your conduct being 
subject to a review by a court and a 
jury, you are all of a sudden going to 
think differently. 
Don’t misconstrue what I am saying. 
I am not for abolishing qualified immu-
nity; I am for revisiting the concept be-
cause I think it has grown too much 
from judicially created fiat. It is time 
for the legislative body—for us to 
speak as to what we would like to have 
happen to the statute that we create 
that now has a component to it that 
was never envisioned when it was origi-
nally passed. That is what Clarence 
Thomas is telling us as a nation we 
need to do. 
To my friends on the other side, if it 
is about qualified immunity, let’s talk. 
If it is about 242, let’s talk. If it is 
about keeping this issue alive, don’t 
waste my time. We have all had plenty 
of time around here to do better. Now 
we have a chance to actually do some 
good. The only way we are going to do 
some good is talk. The only way you 
get a law passed is to engage in debate. 
If you don’t want to debate the topic, if 
you don’t want to have amendments 
about the topic, that tells me all I need 
to know about where you are coming 
from. 
I yield to the Senator from Nebraska. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I want to 
start by saying thank you to my friend 
from South Carolina—LINDSEY
GRA-
HAM, chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee spoke, but I mean my desk 
mate, Senator SCOTT from South Caro-
lina—not only for his leadership and 
hard work and the hard work of Jen-
nifer and the rest of that their team. 
Over the course of the last 2 weeks, 
they have been working around the 
clock to lead our six-person working 
group on this project. 
I want to thank Tim, not just for his 
leadership, but for his speech 30 min-
utes ago and for his spirit. That speech 
is a speech that needs to be watched by 
every American. 
I sincerely hope that the 100 people in 
this room will come together and try 
to get an outcome and not just main-
tain a political issue as has happened 
so often around here. I think if we had 
the process that was the custom in the 
Senate until a few decades ago of com-
mittees happening in the morning and 
the Senate convening for most of the 
afternoon—if this room were actually 
full when TIM
SCOTT
delivered his 
speech, it would be real tough for peo-
ple to be talking about not voting on 
the motion to proceed next week and 
getting on this piece of legislation 
where we could then debate it and 
argue about it and fight about tech-
nical pieces here and there and figure 
out how we make it better. We would 
be on a piece of legislation, and we 
would be trying to get an outcome. I 
sincerely hope that is true. I sincerely 
hope people listen to TIM
SCOTT’s 
speech from today. 
George Floyd’s murder, obviously, 
shocked the nation. It shocked us in 
two ways. It shocked us, on the one 
hand, because we saw a man being mur-
dered for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, and 
we saw three other police officers stand 
by while he was murdered. But it also 
shocked us because it reminded us, yet 
again, that America’s struggle for 
equal justice under the law is far, far 
from over. 
The American creed is a beautiful 
thing. The American creed celebrates 
the dignity, the inherent self-worth, 
the fact that we believe, as so many of 
our Founders believed, that people 
were created Imago Dei—created in the 
image of God as image bearers. That

dignity is male and female, Black and 
White. Every man, woman, and child in 
this country is created with inherent 
dignity. They are beautiful, and that 
creed is beautiful. That proposition 
that all men are created equal should 
inspire every generation of Americans. 
We aren’t doing a very good job right 
now of passing on the glories of that 
creed to the next generation. It is a 
beautiful 
and 
profound 
creed, 
but 
throughout our history, our failures to 
live up to that creed have been ugly 
over and over again. 
George Floyd’s murder was horrific 
for that man and for his family and for 
everyone in his communities—Min-
neapolis, Houston, and other places 
where that man had made a mark. But 
it was also horrific because it was yet 
another reminder of all the ways that 
we fail to live up to our creed. The 
creed is beautiful, and our execution 
has so often been ugly. 
When communities of color have lost 
faith in law enforcement, we aren’t liv-
ing up to that creed. When an Amer-
ican tells you that he fears being 
pulled over for driving while Black, we 
need a lot more conversations in a lot 
more communities so people know this 
experience. 
Again, Senator SCOTT is one of my 
closest friends in this body. The experi-
ences he has had with law enforcement 
in South Carolina are different from 
the ones I have had with law enforce-
ment in Nebraska. The experiences he 
has on Capitol Hill with law enforce-
ment have been different from the ex-
periences I have had on Capitol Hill. No 
one should be wearing skin pigment or 
racial 
heritage 
as 
something 
that 
changes our experience of law enforce-
ment, yet it is regularly the case. That 
is ugly. The creed is beautiful. 
Our attempts to become and to be a 
more perfect Union and to live up to 
the glories of that creed are an impor-
tant part of our shared project to-
gether. At the risk of sounding too 
theological, east of Eden, sin is always 
ugly, and that includes America’s 
original sin. That tells us that we have 
work to do together. 
We have work to do as 330 million 
Americans, but we have work to do as 
100 Senators. What that should mean is 
that next week we are going to be in 
this body trying to live up to that 
creed and to do more. 
There is a lot of technical stuff inside 
this bill. As Senator SCOTT said, 70 per-
cent of what is in this bill is pretty 
darn noncontroversial, largely because 
it is lifted and summarizing many 
pieces that are also in the House of 
Representatives’ Democrat bill. 
The JUSTICE Act puts forward a 
number of commonsense reforms that 
seek to force more accountability. This 
has been stated on the floor many 
times today, but I want to say it again: 
When police use lethal force, there is a 
voluntary opportunity today for them 
to report that to the FBI. We want to 
make that mandatory. We want all 
that data to be captured and to be 
passed along so there is a lot more 
transparency on all lethal uses of force. 
The commonsense reforms include 
increasing police resources. There is a 
lot of training that needs to be done 
better across this country. There are a 
lot of practices in local law enforce-
ment—when you look at the 15,000, 
16,000, whatever the current number is 
of local entities that have the capa-
bility and capacity to have law en-
forcement authorities, those policing 
powers, there is a lot of diversity in 
their practices. Some of those prac-
tices are improving but are still bad. 
Senator SCOTT and our legislation want 
to try to use the Federal grant-making 
powers to squeeze out some of those 
bad practices. 
We want to see trust rebuilt between 
this Nation’s communities and the po-
lice. We reject the false binary that 
you have to make a choice between 
being on the side of communities of 
color or being on the side of law en-
forcement. No, we don’t want that to 
be the choice. We want the choice to be 
law enforcement to get better and com-
munities of color to have more trust. 
We want to see more collaboration. We 
want to see more progress. Frankly, 
that is what the vast majority of indi-
vidual police and that is what the vast 
majority of police departments want. 
The overwhelming majority of Amer-
icans—Republican 
and 
Democrat, 
women and men, Black and White—the 
overwhelming majority of Americans 
want us to build more trust. We can do 
that in this body next week. 
We want to strive toward equal pro-
tection under the law. That starts with 
trying to narrow the differences and 
figuring out what we can do to move 
forward together. That is what this bill 
does. This bill is an architectural 
frame to do a bunch of good things that 
are pretty darn noncontroversial and 
to do a bunch of things that we can 
build on in a debate and amendment 
process. 
We should be passing something 100 
to 0. There will be debate. There will 
amendment votes underneath that will 
be contentious, but we should ulti-
mately be getting onto a piece of legis-
lation to start the process 100 to 0, and 
at the back end we should be passing 
something 100 to 0 even though, in the 
middle, there should be a bunch of 
amendments where people argue about 
the best way that we do the particu-
lars. 
There is no reason we shouldn’t be 
moving forward. We can get this done. 
We can take another step to make 
America’s beautiful creed a reality for 
every single one of God’s children. 
That is what we should do, and we 
should do it without delay. 
I yield to the Senator from West Vir-
ginia. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to be here with my fellow Sen-
ator from Nebraska and the other 
Members of the small team that was 
really blessed to be asked to join Sen-
ator SCOTT as he led us to where we are 
today, which is introducing the JUS-
TICE Act. 
I am thinking about where the great 
talents lie in the Senate. One of the 
things we all know all of us do well is 
talk. We know how to talk. Sometimes 
we talk too much. Senator SCOTT 
doesn’t talk that much. He even said 
that about himself. I can tell you the 
skill that he has that a lot of us need 
more of. Always, when I am asked by 
school children ‘‘What is the best skill 
to have?’’ I say it is the ability to lis-
ten. He has listened for years and 
years. He has not just lived this; he has 
listened. He said, just yesterday, he 
was with the family of one of the vic-
tims, and it was a very moving day for 
him. 
I am here today to rise with my col-
leagues in support of the JUSTICE Act. 
I join the overwhelming majority of 
Americans and West Virginians who, in 
sadness and frustration and sorrow, 
witnessed the horrifying video of the 
murder of George Floyd by the Min-
neapolis Police Department. It was ab-
solutely unacceptable. 
The vast majority of our law enforce-
ment officers here and around the 
country are just like us. They want to 
have a great and peaceful nation. They 
want to have great and peaceful com-
munities. They want their families to 
feel safe in their homes and out in the 
streets of their communities just as we 
do. A lot of them take their oath seri-
ously and do their best to protect our 
communities. 
It is not enough to say that the death 
of George Floyd was a terrible, isolated 
tragedy because we know many of 
these have preceded this date. I have 
said it is almost like popping a balloon 
and revealing all of this unrest under-
neath, all the questions and sorrow 
that have been festering. 
Here we are today. I think the great 
majority of us want to put all this en-
ergy and frustration into action. We 
want to have something substantive so 
we can tell the American people: We 
listened. We heard. We feel this. And 
we want to find solutions. 
We have to recognize that every time 
force is used inappropriately by law en-
forcement, our justice system has erod-
ed. We have to understand our history, 
wherein Black Americans have been 
too 
frequently 
denied 
their 
basic 
rights. It is our job to make sure that 
Americans, regardless of race, can feel 
that law enforcement is there to pro-
tect them and their families and that 
they trust that. The trust factor is 
where the erosion has been most re-
markably in view of all of us—the lack 
of trust. 
It is our job to hear these voices and 
to act. In my opinion, it doesn’t mean 
defunding the police; it means improv-
ing the police and improving equal pro-
tections so that everybody has basic 
protections and we are all equal in the 
eyes of justice and the law. 
We have seen the looting. We have 
seen officers who have lost their lives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3046 
June 17, 2020 
We have seen an underbelly to our 
country that has been difficult to 
watch. Yet what we have seen, too, is 
an outcry of the American citizens 
peacefully protesting what they see as 
inequities in their lives. When I look in 
the crowd—I was right there in Wash-
ington last week when a crowd of about 
150 protesters walked by me very 
peacefully with signs and chanting in 
solidarity. Most of the people in that 
group were probably under 30 years old. 
There were a lot of Black faces, a lot of 
White faces, men and women, young 
people who felt that lack of trust. We 
look at how people have exercised their 
First Amendment rights. It is a beau-
tiful thing to see. Unfortunately, it has 
been eroded by some of the destructive 
things that have come along with it, 
but at the base of it, we are hearing the 
same things in our States every day. 
While we want to know that our Dec-
laration of Independence has lived up 
to—and that the 14th amendment, 
which guarantees that no government, 
including State and local governments, 
can deny basic constitutional rights, 
we haven’t quite lived up to all of that. 
A century passed before we passed 
major civil rights legislation in 1964. 
One of the sources of great pride for me 
is that my father was one of the lead-
ing Republicans in the House of Rep-
resentatives representing West Vir-
ginia in 1964 who helped make sure 
that passed. In my office, I actually 
have a pen that was used in signing 
that and a picture of my dad at the 
White House when it was signed. 
Our job is not done. When I hear the 
voices of mothers who say that they 
are fearful their son might not survive 
a simple traffic stop or they must have 
certain behaviors—as Senator SASSE 
said, it is so different from what he 
learned growing up as a young man 
about how to interact with police offi-
cers in that situation. We can’t have 
those anguished cries and that double 
system anymore. That is what this bill 
is about. 
I am proud to be with Senator SCOTT 
introducing the JUSTICE Act. It has 
been interesting to watch him and all 
of us listen to the different segments of 
our society who have talked to us— 
friends, neighbors, police, members of 
communities of color, our religious 
communities, our news commentators. 
I did six interviews today on the TV 
about this. Every single one of them 
asked me one fundamental question, 
and I wish some of my friends on the 
other side of the aisle would be here. 
They asked: You don’t have a very 
good history in this body of having Re-
publicans and Democrats joining to-
gether to get something done. How do 
you think you can do this now? I said: 
Well, today we did. We did the Great 
American 
Outdoors 
Act. 
Several 
months ago we did the CARES Act. We 
can do it. Where there is a will, we can 
do it. 
If we don’t do it, we are failing so 
many people. We are failing ourselves. 
We are failing our country, our com-
munities, failing our law enforcement 
communities. I would say that we need 
to begin this job of a difficult conversa-
tion and make sure that we get this 
bill onto the Senate floor and debate it 
in front of the general public. 
When we start debating things on the 
Senate floor in front of the general 
public, do you know what happens? The 
same thing that happened during the 
impeachment trial. I know all of us 
were getting all kinds of input from 
people all around. People are watching 
it. They are seeing what is actually 
going on. That is what we need. If we 
want to have discussions on qualified 
immunity, if we want to ban choke 
holds, which I want to do and our bill 
does, essentially, but if you want some-
thing more definitively, yes, I am all 
for that. Let’s have the discussion and 
talk about it in front of the American 
people. 
I believe that law enforcement has a 
lot of great people who work in and 
around law enforcement. They need the 
equipment. They need the cameras. 
They need to have the realtime evi-
dence—the realtime evidence of wrong-
doing and evidence of doing it right. It 
is 
a 
protective 
device. 
Everybody 
should have the availability of that in 
law enforcement. 
We also require that law enforcement 
agencies retain disciplinary records on 
officers and make sure that they check 
an officer’s record from other agencies 
before making a hiring decision. I kind 
of thought that was going on anyway. 
I sort of did. We need to make sure and 
make clear that is what we absolutely 
want to do. 
The bill incentivizes State and local 
police agencies to ban choke holds. As 
I mentioned earlier, I am for even more 
definitive language on that. 
It also provides training in all kinds 
of areas—deescalation or if an officer is 
in a situation where another officer is 
using overwhelming force improperly, 
that officer is trained on how to inter-
dict that situation. We saw that hap-
pen in Minneapolis. Sadly, the officers 
did not, but maybe they didn’t know 
how to do it, when to do it, what form 
it should take. Let’s explore that. 
To keep our communities safe, we 
need our police officers. We need trust 
in our law enforcement. There should 
be no conflict between a pro-civil 
rights bill and a pro-law enforcement 
bill. They should be able to be joined 
together. This supports our police offi-
cers while bringing about positive 
change that will guarantee equal pro-
tection to all of our citizens. The police 
reform bill will make a real difference 
in advancing our constitutional ideals 
and in making our communities safer. 
I am proud to stand with Senator 
SCOTT, but I want to stand with the en-
tire body to talk about the ways to 
make this bill even better, to take the 
70 percent of this bill that we have 
shared ideals on and shared ideas and 
put those into action and to not dither 
here, to not score political points, and 
to say to the American people: These 
are tough decisions, and we are going 
to make them. We are going to have 
this where you can see it, right here on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
So thank you very much. I am proud 
to be with my colleagues. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
NOMINATION OF JUSTIN REED WALKER 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we are in 
the middle of a pandemic. The Presi-
dent of the United States doesn’t act 
like it, but Americans are still dying 
by the hundreds—several hundred al-
most every day. 
We are in the middle of an economic 
crisis. Again, the President of the 
United States doesn’t act like it. He 
crows about the unemployment num-
bers when they are the worst since 
World War II. 
And we are in the middle of a crisis 
of conscience. Millions of Americans 
have taken to the streets to protest the 
murders of Black and Brown Ameri-
cans by the people supposed to protect 
them. 
With all of these challenges, the 
President of the United States is fail-
ing. The Senate should be stepping in 
right now to fill that leadership void, 
to get more help to families and to 
communities that are going bankrupt, 
to protect workers—to use every tool 
we have to force the administration to 
get some kind of test trace isolate re-
gime in place to truly stop the spread 
of the coronavirus. We should be listen-
ing to the protestors demanding justice 
in communities all across the country, 
large and small. 
They remind us this pandemic isn’t a 
separate issue from racial justice—it is 
all connected. It is not a coincidence 
that President Trump stopped even 
pretending 
to 
try 
to 
fight 
the 
coronavirus once he realized it was dis-
proportionately 
Black 
and 
Brown 
Americans dying, not very often one of 
his rich friends. 
In the Senate, we have plans to get 
help and protections to workers; we 
have plans to fund a scale-up of testing 
that gets us closer to the level we need; 
we have plans to work to hold police 
accountable; we have begun to tackle 
the systemic racism in our justice sys-
tem. 
Look at it this way: The last time I 
was on an airplane was in mid-March. I 
live close enough—6-hour drive be-
tween Cleveland and Washington. In 
mid-March, 
there 
were 
about 
90 
coronavirus cases diagnosed in the 
United 
States—halfway 
around 
the 
world from where the Presiding Officer 
likes to emphasize it came from, 
Wuhan. About 900 miles from Wuhan is 
the capital of South Korea—Seoul. In 
South Korea, around that same time, 
there were 90 cases. So South Korea 
had 90 diagnosed cases; the United 
States had about 90 diagnosed cases. 
Since that date in March, fewer than 
300 
Koreans 
have 
died 
of 
the 
coronavirus; over 110,000 Americans 
have died of the coronavirus.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3047 
June 17, 2020 
In Korea, their unemployment rate 
now is under 4 percent; our unemploy-
ment rate is somewhere between three 
and four times that. 
That is clearly the incompetence— 
this is not a partisan statement. I have 
watched my Republican Governor of 
Ohio, who has done a good job, teamed 
up with Dr. Amy Acton, the health di-
rector, in combating this virus early, 
while the President of the United 
States was still blaming the virus on— 
saying it was a hoax or not real or 
whatever he said, and then his inept 
leadership didn’t scale up testing, 
didn’t have any national program to 
provide protective equipment to our 
people. 
So we have seen the bungled leader-
ship out of the White House—110,000 
Americans passed away, an unemploy-
ment rate higher than at any time in 
my lifetime—but we are not doing any-
thing about that here in this body. 
Why? 
Because 
Leader 
MCCONNELL 
doesn’t want to do anything about it, 
for whatever reason. Instead of rising 
to meet the crisis of the pandemic or 
unemployment or the protests on our 
streets, Senator MCCONNELL wants to 
create a new crisis by confirming more 
extreme judges that are trying to take 
away America’s healthcare. 
The challenges we are facing as a 
country are bad enough. Imagine if 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
and 
President 
Trump get their way—their handpicked 
judges throw tens of millions of Ameri-
cans off of their health insurance in 
the middle of a pandemic. That sounds 
farfetched? Well, no, it isn’t. 
In the middle of a pandemic, this 
President continues his lawsuit to try 
to overturn the Affordable Care Act, 
even though the voters have ratified it 
through a number of elections in 2012 
and 2014 and 2016 and 2018. It still 
stands, but the President of the United 
States is trying to take away people’s 
healthcare. They are trying to sneak 
ACA repeal through the courts since 
they couldn’t do it in Congress. 
While the rest of the country is dis-
tracted just trying to keep their fami-
lies safe, judges are deciding the fate of 
America’s health coverage right now. 
The nomination we are considering 
this week—right now on the floor—of 
Judge Walker is part of that effort. 
Judge Walker has served in the West-
ern District of Kentucky for just 6 
months. 
What makes him qualified for the DC 
Circuit? It is not the 6 months he 
served in Kentucky. In fact, the bar as-
sociation in Kentucky said he wasn’t 
qualified for that job. He has only had 
it for 6 months. What makes him quali-
fied? 
Just go down the hall. I am sure you 
could have seen many, many times 
Judge Walker when he was Law Clerk 
Walker or Young Man Walker or 
Grandson of Contributor Walker going 
in and out of Senator MCCONNELL’s of-
fice. He is a protege of MCCONNELL’s. 
He thinks the way MCCONNELL thinks; 
he acts the way MCCONNELL acts; and 
that is what it is all about. 
Before his nomination to the district 
court, 
Walker 
praised 
then-Judge 
Kavanaugh for providing a roadmap 
the Supreme Court could use to strike 
down the ACA. So it isn’t just that 
Judge Walker is a young, unqualified, 
extremist, far-right protege of the ma-
jority leader. It is not just that. I 
mean, talk about the swamp. That is 
what that is. 
What it is all about is putting an-
other vote in a key place to overturn 
the Affordable Care Act. He is calling 
upholding the ACA indefensible and 
catastrophic. 
I don’t know how, in the middle of a 
pandemic, you look at the American 
landscape, you see how many people 
have been sick—millions of Americans 
have been sick—110,000 Americans have 
died, hundreds more every day, and you 
think one of the most important things 
you can do is strip millions of Ameri-
cans of their healthcare. 
He has continued his attacks on 
American healthcare protections since 
he joined the Federal bench. In March 
2020, at his formal swearing-in cere-
mony as district judge, Judge Walker 
said the worst words he heard while 
clerking for Justice Kennedy on the 
Supreme Court were the Chief Justice’s 
rationale for upholding the ACA. The 
worst words he heard from the man for 
whom he was working were his words 
to uphold the ACA, the Affordable Care 
Act. 
Now, what I forgot to mention was 
that when Judge Walker said that at 
his swearing-in ceremony, there were a 
couple of important visitors there. 
Although the Senate should have 
been in session and finished our work 
on the first round of the coronavirus, 
Senator MCCONNELL—his office is down 
the hall. As we know, Senator MCCON-
NELL decided to adjourn the Senate and 
go back to Kentucky for this swearing- 
in. Judge Kavanaugh, another protege, 
if you will, of Senator MCCONNELL’s 
was there too. 
So don’t forget, Senator MCCONNELL 
is on the ballot this year. Senator 
MCCONNELL faces an opponent who is 
running neck and neck with him. It is 
a very Republican State, but Senator 
MCCONNELL is not a particularly well- 
liked figure in his State, as we have 
seen through many years. 
So Senator MCCONNELL didn’t do his 
job here. It is not just he didn’t do his 
job. He stopped us from doing our jobs 
so he could fly back, be with Supreme 
Court Justice Kavanaugh, to remind 
the voters in Kentucky that he is the 
strong man who got Judge Kavanaugh 
on the Supreme Court and then to cele-
brate the swearing-in of just another 
young judge to a Federal district court. 
That is where Senator MCCONNELL’s 
priorities are. 
We know Judge Walker is the latest 
in a long line of judges pushed by 
President Trump, rammed through by 
Leader MCCONNELL, as his minions, 
shills, obedient junior Senators or 
sheep—you choose the noun for your 
colleagues—all vote yes so you could 
put another member on another Fed-
eral court who is trying to take away 
Americans’ healthcare. 
Chad Readler, from my State, who is 
now serving on the Sixth Circuit, led 
the Trump administration’s efforts to 
dismantle the entire Affordable Care 
Act, and David Porter, who holds a 
Pennsylvania seat on the Third Cir-
cuit, wrote that the ACA ‘‘violates the 
Framers’ constitutional design.’’ 
What kind of law training do you 
have, and what kind of upbringing do 
you have—what kind of way do you 
think?—that you would think that pro-
viding healthcare to citizens is a viola-
tion of the Framers’ constitutional de-
sign? Who thinks that way? On and on 
it goes. 
The American people want to keep 
their healthcare. They have made that 
clear. They especially want to keep 
that healthcare in the middle of, for 
gosh sakes, a pandemic. Leader MCCON-
NELL needs to stop trying to take it 
away through the courts and start let-
ting us actually get to work to make 
people healthier. 
Let’s get to work to save lives from 
the coronavirus. Let’s get to work to 
save lives from police violence. Let’s 
get to work to save lives from all of the 
inequities in our healthcare system. 
Let’s get to work to put money in peo-
ple’s pockets, help them pay the bills 
and stay in their homes, and help State 
and local governments from laying off 
thousands and thousands of workers. 
Leader MCCONNELL, let us do our job, 
the job for which we were elected. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—S. RES. 596 
AND S. 3798 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I am 
here today to talk about the death of 
democracy, and I am here today to talk 
about how we can stand with those who 
are fighting to preserve it. 
In the United States, the death of de-
mocracy might seem like a distant and 
unfamiliar thing. We study examples in 
the history books. We read of nations 
and peoples who are forced, through no 
choice of their own, to surrender their 
basic liberties. We remind ourselves of 
the need always to stay vigilant, to 
stay aware, but we are seeing today the 
death of democracy unfold in realtime, 
right before our eyes, in the city of 
Hong Kong. 
A diverse and global city, rich in cul-
ture and arts and commerce and peo-
ple, Hong Kong is an outpost of liberty. 
For decades, under a special set of laws 
and protections, it has stood as a haven 
of liberty—a beacon, a light—but I fear 
that light is fast dimming, nearly over-
come by darkness and by tyranny. 
This body, along with all free peo-
ples, has a special responsibility to 
take a stand for the freedom-loving 
people of Hong Kong. We must take a 
stand to ensure that the light of Hong 
Kong does not go out forever. We must 
take a stand to ensure that this out-
post of liberty lives on. We must take

S3048 
June 17, 2020 
a stand so that the flame of freedom is 
not extinguished forever by the Chi-
nese Communist Party. 
On May 28, Beijing announced that it 
would adopt legislation that will essen-
tially jettison the basic law under 
which Hong Kong has been governed 
for decades. It is legislation that will 
trample upon Beijing’s own treaty 
commitments in the 1984 Sino-British 
Treaty, legislation—they call it legis-
lation, but, of course, what it really is 
is just fiat, fiat by the Chinese Com-
munist Party in Beijing—that will 
strip Hong Kong of its basic liberties, 
strip Hongkongers of the right to free-
dom of speech, strip Hongkongers of 
the right to peacefully assemble, strip 
Hongkongers of their rights to redress 
in fair and open courts with some proc-
ess of law. 
Beijing wants to deny the people of 
Hong Kong all of these things because 
liberty is a threat to the authoritarian 
Communist regime in Beijing. Oh, it 
fears that more than anything else. It 
fears the people. It fears the will of the 
people, and it fears the liberty of the 
people. It is trying to destroy the last 
outpost of liberty in its nation—the 
great city of Hong Kong. 
Now, we were promised that it would 
not come to this. We were told, when 
China joined the World Trade Organiza-
tion, when China was given permanent 
normal trade relations, when China 
was ushered into this so-called commu-
nity of nations, that it would liberalize 
China and that it would make the Chi-
nese Communist Party more moderate. 
Well, I think we know how that has 
turned out. 
After decades now of stealing our 
jobs, decades of ripping us off in trade, 
decades of impoverishing our own 
workers here in this country while 
stealing our intellectual property, dec-
ades of building its military on the 
backs of our middle class and our 
working people, now Beijing wants to 
dominate its region, snuff out Hong 
Kong, and then turn to the rest of the 
world. 
We have to send a clear message that 
we will not stand idly by. We will not 
allow Beijing to erase the history of its 
misdeeds. We will not allow it to erase 
the history of Tiananmen. We will not 
allow it to erase the history of the con-
centration camps it is running at this 
very moment, and we will not stand by 
while it destroys the liberties and the 
rights of the people of Hong Kong. 
It is time now for this body to stand 
and send a clear message that will call 
the other free nations to stand in sup-
port of the values we hold dear, in sup-
port of all that this country stands for, 
in support of the liberty of the people 
of Hong Kong. 
I yield to my colleague Senator 
BLACKBURN of Tennessee. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
thank the Senator from Missouri for 
the work he is doing as he brings for-
ward this resolution for Hong Kong. 
I want to take just a couple of min-
utes to remind those of us who have 
been watching this issue and have con-
cerns about this resolution that the ag-
gression we are seeing now is not some-
thing that is new. This is newly real-
ized. 
As those of us who have followed this 
and followed the dealings of the Chi-
nese Communist Party know, the new-
est so-called national security law is 
nothing more than the party’s response 
to the threat that uprisings and pro-
tests in Hong Kong pose to its hold on 
power. It just can’t stand it. It watches 
the freedom fighters in Hong Kong, and 
it thinks: What if it gets away from us? 
Hong Kong is our financial center, 
and it is watching what is happening in 
the rest of the free world. Australia, 
Canada, and the UK all have signed the 
official joint statement with us, the 
United States of America, expressing 
deep concern with this so-called na-
tional security legislation, which real-
ly is the Communist Party’s way of 
stepping into Hong Kong and usurping 
the power—of going back on a deal it 
made long ago. 
Beijing claims that it needs this law 
to control against ‘‘subversion of state 
power,’’ but, again, anyone who has 
been paying attention knows that it 
will use this standard as an excuse to 
redefine ‘‘subversion’’ and engage in 
the violent repression of speech, asso-
ciation, and movement—with no cause 
and without mercy. This is how it has 
kept control. It is a pattern, and there 
is no reason to believe it is going to do 
anything differently this time around. 
Over the past year, we have seen how 
willing Chinese officials are to trample 
every international norm, every law, 
every principle of diplomacy to force 
their hand on their own people and on 
other countries. Now, against all odds, 
forces in Beijing have found a way to 
make life in Hong Kong more dan-
gerous 
than 
it 
has 
been 
by 
delegitimizing peaceful and nonviolent 
protests and journalism that doesn’t 
mirror party propaganda. They have 
seized even more hope away from the 
freedom fighters who have captured the 
world’s attention in their stunning dis-
plays of defiance. 
It is really quite a battle that is tak-
ing place, and I thank my colleagues 
for the good work they have done in 
standing against the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s aggression. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator from Tennessee for her tre-
mendous work on this issue. I thank 
her for her leadership and for her 
strong stance in favor of the people of 
Hong Kong and their basic liberties, 
guaranteed to them by the inter-
national treaty commitments that Bei-
jing has ascribed to, that Beijing has 
signed up for, and that it now seeks to 
violate with impunity. 
Let’s be clear about what Beijing 
wants. It says that Hong Kong is its 
plaything to do with as it chooses. 
That is not the case. Beijing has under-
taken internationally binding commit-
ments, agreements, by which it has 
agreed to protect and honor the basic 
liberties of the people of Hong Kong, 
and it is those commitments that it is 
seeking to violate today with impu-
nity. It is those commitments Beijing 
is seeking to wriggle out of just as it 
has, time and again, violated its agree-
ments with this country, just as it has, 
time and again, cheated on its obliga-
tions to Americans. 
That is another reason I am calling 
on the Senate today to pass a resolu-
tion that makes it our position that 
China has gone too far. We must go on 
record and tell the world that this new 
national security law—this fiat that 
has been issued by Beijing—is a viola-
tion of what Beijing has committed to. 
It is a violation of the fundamental lib-
erties of the people of Hong Kong, and 
nothing less than freedom is at stake. 
My resolution also calls on this ad-
ministration to use every diplomatic 
means available to stay Beijing’s hand. 
The President has already begun the 
process of downgrading Hong Kong’s 
special trade status. We must build on 
that effort now by rallying nations— 
the free nations of the world—to pres-
sure China to back down from their at-
tempt to strip away the basic liberties 
of the people of Hong Kong because, in 
the end, Hong Kong’s struggle is the 
struggle of all free people. 
Do you know what I said when I had 
the chance to visit the city, see the 
protests, and be out on the streets my-
self last fall? That sometimes the fate 
of one city defines the struggle of a 
generation. In the 1960s, that city was 
Berlin. Today, that city is Hong Kong, 
and it is time for this body to take a 
stand. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, as 
if in legislative session, I now ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations be dis-
charged from further consideration and 
the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 596. 
I further ask unanimous consent that 
the resolution be agreed to, the pre-
amble be agreed to, and that the mo-
tions to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I am reserving the right to ob-
ject.

ments made by the Senator from Mis-
souri about the aggressive and unac-
ceptable conduct of the Government of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3049 
June 17, 2020 
China, or Hong Kong, he is absolutely 
right, I believe, that it is important 
that the U.S. Senate—in fact, that the 
U.S. Government take action strongly 
expressing our disapproval but also 
take action to actually show the Gov-
ernment of China that there will be a 
price to pay if they continue down that 
path of aggression and try to snuff out 
the freedoms of the people of Hong 
Kong. 
That is why, immediately after the 
Government of China announced its in-
tentions to move in that direction, we 
introduced a bipartisan bill. Senator 
TOOMEY introduced the bill. I am proud 
to join him as a cosponsor. We have 
other Democratic and Republican co-
sponsors to the bill. I am pleased to see 
the Senator from North Dakota on the 
floor. He is a cosponsor of that bill. It 
is called the Hong Kong Autonomy 
Act. 
In addition to expressing the senti-
ments that the Senator from Missouri 
lays out in his Senate resolution, it 
proposes that we take action as the 
Government of the United States. 
While we have heard statements from 
Secretary Pompeo, the reality is that 
this administration has not exercised 
any of its existing sanctions authority 
that it could take to express our strong 
disapproval of the actions the Govern-
ment of China is proposing to take 
with respect to Hong Kong. That is 
why we introduced the bipartisan bill, 
again, outlining all the transgressions 
the 
Senator 
from 
Missouri 
talked 
about but actually doing something 
about them by requiring that the ad-
ministration impose sanctions on indi-
viduals in the Government of China 
who are undermining the rights of the 
people in Hong Kong and requiring 
them to impose sanctions on Chinese 
Government entities that are depriving 
the people of Hong Kong of the free-
doms the Senator talked about. It goes 
beyond that. It says that any bank 
that is aiding and abetting the Govern-
ment of China in snuffing out the 
rights of the people of Hong Kong can 
be subject to sanctions. 
Now, I know the Senator from Mis-
souri knows the Government of China 
well enough to understand that the 
Senate passing a resolution and leaving 
it at that is not going to change their 
conduct. I think the Senator is enough 
of a student of the Chinese Communist 
Government to recognize that. So that 
is exactly why we introduced this bi-
partisan legislation because if we want 
to have any chance of influencing the 
conduct of the Government of China, 
we have to make it clear there will be 
a price to pay. There is no price to be 
paid in the Senate passing a resolution. 
It is a nice statement. I support the 
statement, but I am also a little tired 
of this body passing a lot of resolu-
tions, sometimes thinking we have ac-
tually done something when we haven’t 
changed a thing. 
That is why I am here on the Senate 
floor to ask my colleagues to support 
what is a bipartisan bill that actually 
has some teeth in it. It is not just a 
statement from the Senate. It is an ac-
tion that will be taken by the Senate 
and the House and, hopefully, by this 
administration, 
which 
apparently 
doesn’t want to take action. We have 
heard them already express concerns 
about this legislation. 
I would hope that if our colleagues on 
the Republican side feel as strongly as 
the Senator from Missouri does, they 
would want to back up those words 
with legislative action, and they would 
want to back up those words with 
something that is more meaningful and 
something that tells the Government 
of China that we stand together in 
making sure there is a price to pay. 
I know the Senator from Missouri 
has worked on other bills making it 
clear that we do not find acceptable all 
sorts of conduct by China. I have as 
well—bipartisan bills. I hope we can 
join together right here, right now, to 
support 
the 
expression—the 
state-
ment—that the Senator from Missouri 
has brought to us but also go beyond 
that and send a signal right now that 
we, the U.S. Senate, want to be joined 
by the House and by the administra-
tion in putting action behind those 
words. That is exactly what the bipar-
tisan Hong Kong Autonomy Act does. 
So I would respectfully request that 
the Senator from Missouri modify his 
request to ask, in addition to what he 
proposed, that the Banking Committee 
be discharged from further consider-
ation of S. 3798, a bill to impose sanc-
tions with respect to foreign persons 
involved in the erosion of certain obli-
gations of China with respect to Hong 
Kong; that the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration; that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator from Missouri so modify his 
request? 
Mr. HAWLEY. I do. 
Is there objection to the request as 
modified? 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, it is clear 
to the five or six of us Senators who 
are in the room right now that there is 
passion, that it is an important issue, 
and that there may even be unanimous 
consent in the hearts and minds, cer-
tainly, of the Senators with regard to 
both the spirit of the resolution and 
perhaps the letter of the bill, of which 
I am a cosponsor, that has been intro-
duced by UC by the Senator from 
Maryland. 
I think it is clear that we all have 
the same objective here, but I also 
know there is just a handful of us in 
the room talking about a very impor-
tant issue that may seem simple but 
we know is very complicated. 
We know that the administration has 
provided both technical and policy 
views on the bill, and I think with such 
an important issue that so many of us 
care deeply about, it deserves a little 
more discussion and debate than just 
to come to the floor with a UC. 
I am committed, as a member of the 
Banking Committee and as a cospon-
sor, to working with both committees 
and with the chairs of both committees 
of jurisdiction over the resolution and 
the bill to make sure we get it right as 
opposed to this UC. 
I want to work hard. I know you all 
do. I think we should work at looking 
at the comments from the administra-
tion, working together as Republicans 
and Democrats who care about this 
country, care about the people of Hong 
Kong, and who are concerned about the 
behavior of China. So I object to adop-
tion of this bill before we have a 
chance to do exactly that.

JUSTICE IN POLICING ACT 
Ms. SMITH. Madam President, it has 
been a little bit over 3 weeks since my 
constituent, George Floyd, was mur-
dered by the Minneapolis police, and 
for a little over 3 weeks, millions of 
people have marched on the streets, 
raising their voices in grief and an-
guish to protest the police brutality 
and systemic racism that killed George 
Floyd, 
Breonna 
Taylor, 
Ahmaud 
Arbery, Philando Castile, Jamar Clark, 
and so many others. But the killing 
hasn’t stopped. 
Just last Friday, police in Atlanta 
killed Rayshard Brooks, shooting him 
twice in the back. Just moments ago, 
it was announced that this officer will 
be charged. 
The killing will not stop until we 
take action. The Senate needs to act 
now to take up and pass the Justice in 
Policing Act. 
I joined my colleagues, Senators 
BOOKER and HARRIS, in introducing this 
bill last week. I am grateful for their 
strong leadership toward creating a 
more fair and equitable justice system. 
The scale of the injustice can feel 
overwhelming, and the path can seem 
very long, but passing the Justice in 
Policing Act would provide concrete 
steps on that path. It is a necessary 
step toward stopping the killing and 
advancing our work to make trans-
formative changes that we need to ful-
fill the promise of freedom and equal-
ity in America. 
The Justice in Policing Act would 
make some of the changes that we ur-
gently need to stop the scourge of po-
lice violence against communities of 
color. This legislation would prohibit 
some of the most dangerous police 
practices. It would strictly limit the 
use of force, and it would begin holding 
law enforcement accountable in a sys-
tem that was designed to shield them 
from accountability. 
First, the bill prohibits the most dan-
gerous police practices. It would ban 
the use of choke holds like the ones the 
police used to kill George Floyd and

Eric Garner. It would also ban no- 
knock warrants like the one the police 
used when they killed Breonna Taylor 
in her own bed. 
Choke holds pose an unacceptable 
risk, and that risk is not borne equally. 
Black men are nearly three times more 
likely to be killed by police use of force 
than White men. 
The use of no-knock warrants also 
disproportionately harms communities 
of color. The practice was popularized 
in the 1990s as a tool in the war on 
drugs so that officers pursuing drug 
charges could enter a person’s home 
unannounced, with guns drawn, inher-
ently and unnecessarily endangering 
their lives. 
Communities and activists have been 
warning us about the inherent danger 
and injustice of choke holds and no- 
knock warrants for decades. It is long 
past time to end the debate and to ban 
these practices nationally, but experi-
ence has shown us that it is not enough 
to ban egregious practices. When Los 
Angeles banned choke holds in 1982, of-
ficers took up batons to beat and sub-
due civilians. 
In 1991, the officers who beat Rodney 
King actually argued that their actions 
were necessary because they weren’t 
permitted to use a choke hold, and 
those officers were never held fully ac-
countable. 
American policing resists reform and 
accountability, so it is not enough for 
us to ban the most dangerous prac-
tices; we need to set a national stand-
ard for police use of force. That is what 
the Justice in Policing Act does. 
Today, the current standard in law 
asks only if an officer’s use of force was 
reasonable, and this makes it nearly 
impossible to hold officers accountable 
because the system—a system designed 
to protect officers, not Black and 
Brown bodies—has built up decades of 
precedent excusing officers from the 
harm that they cause. So if we are seri-
ous when we say that Black lives mat-
ter, if we are serious about our com-
mitment to equal justice, we need to 
hold police officers to a higher stand-
ard of care in their use of force. That is 
why the Justice in Policing Act would 
set a national use of force standard 
that asks whether the force was nec-
essary and hold officers accountable for 
exhausting other options before resort-
ing to violence. 
The Justice in Policing Act would 
eliminate qualified immunity for law 
enforcement officers and reset the im-
possibly high standard for convicting 
law enforcement officers of a crime. 
Today, our system effectively puts cops 
above the law by insulating them from 
civil and criminal liability when they 
violate the rights of those who they are 
sworn to serve. No one should be 
shielded from accountability for their 
actions in a free society. 
When we change these rules, we will 
finally be able to provide long denied 
justice for victims of police brutality, 
their families, and their communities. 
But we will also be able to prevent 
such brutality in the first place. 
When law enforcement officers be-
lieve that they will never face con-
sequences for crossing the line, they 
will continue to ignore that line. The 
Justice in Policing Act will begin to 
make this change. 
The House is poised to pass the Jus-
tice in Policing Act next week, and I 
urge this Senate to take it up. Let’s de-
bate it, and let’s pass it. 
We are at a crossroad, and we cannot 
fail to act. Four hundred years of 
structural racism cannot be erased by 
a single piece of legislation or with a 
single generation of legislators, but 
passing this bill is a crucial step to-
ward ending the killing and the vio-
lence against communities of color. It 
is a necessary step on the path toward 
racial justice. 
The path toward justice leads us to-
ward transformative changes to rede-
fining the role of policing in America. 
Reimagining policing means recog-
nizing that not every social ill and 
every emergency is answered by calling 
in the armed officers. We have other 
better and more effective tools when 
dealing with the hurt of mental illness, 
of substance abuse, of homelessness, of 
economic insecurity. Reimagining po-
licing means asking whether outfitting 
officers with military-grade weapons 
and equipment makes it safer—or does 
it escalate conflict and violence and 
encourage officers to see the commu-
nities they serve as hostile enemies? 
Reimagining policing means address-
ing the overpolicing of communities of 
color. It means that we ask questions 
about whether anyone is really safer 
when we surveil neighborhoods, search-
ing for possible violations. This only 
feeds the system of mass incarceration. 
Reimagining policing means that we 
reassess our criminal code, our justice 
system, and our sentencing laws that 
irrevocably disrupt lives and commu-
nities for minor offenses with minimal 
impacts on public safety. 
Above 
all, 
reimagining 
policing 
means recognizing that our current 
system is not inevitable; it is the re-
sult of thousands and thousands of pol-
icy choices made over, literally, hun-
dreds of years, designed to control and 
punish Black and Brown and indige-
nous communities—choices that com-
pound injustice and unequal oppor-
tunity. 
As we imagine a new way forward, we 
need 
to 
face 
some 
uncomfortable 
truths about the history of policing in 
our country. We can, and we must, 
make different choices this time. We 
know better, and we have to do better. 
I want to close by thanking the com-
munity leaders and young activists 
who are showing us the path forward. 
This path requires us to be courageous. 
It requires us to be humble. It requires 
us to be uncomfortable. It requires us 
to listen. But it is a path rooted in love 
and in trust and in hope. 
I am committed to walking this path 
with my constituents, and I am hopeful 
that my colleagues and my fellow 
American citizens will join me. 
Thank you.

ator from Tennessee. 
TELEHEALTH 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
it is hard to think of much good that 
has come out of the 3-month experience 
with COVID–19, but here is one thing: 
the number of patients who have seen 
their doctors remotely through the 
internet, FaceTime, and all of the 
other remote technologies we have, in-
cluding the telephone. We call that 
telehealth. 
Our Health Committee this morning 
had a fascinating hearing on tele-
health. There was a lot of bipartisan 
interest from the Senators—Democrat 
and Republican Senators. The Senator 
from Minnesota was the ranking mem-
ber of the committee today at the re-
quest of Senator MURRAY. My sense at 
the end of the hearing was that there 
were a number of things we agreed on. 
I ask unanimous consent that my 
opening 
statement 
at 
the 
hearing 
today be included in the RECORD fol-
lowing my remarks. 
My colleague, the Senator from Ten-
nessee who is presiding today, and I 
both know Tim Adams, who is the CEO 
of the Saint Thomas hospital system in 
Middle Tennessee. 
He told me on the phone last week 
that Saint Thomas employs about 800 
physicians in its several hospitals. Dur-
ing the month of February, there were 
60,000 visits between physicians and pa-
tients in the Saint Thomas system. 
Only 50 of those 60,000 were by tele-
health, were remote. But during the 2 
months of March and April, Ascension 
Saint Thomas conducted more than 
30,000 telehealth visits. That is 50 to 
30,000—more than 45 percent of all of 
the visits between patients and doctors 
during that time. 
Tim Adams expects that to level off, 
but there will still be probably 15 to 20 
percent of all of Saint Thomas 60,000 
visits a month by telehealth. 
I talked to the CEO of the largest 
hospital in San Francisco a few weeks 
ago, and he said that during February, 
about 5 percent of their visits between 
doctors and patients were telehealth. 
He said that was a very high percent-
age for a hospital. But in March, it was 
more than half, more than 50 percent. 
Think about that for just a moment. 
There were 884 million visits in 2016 be-
tween doctors and patients, according 
to the Centers for Disease Control. If 15 
to 20 to 25 percent of those were sud-
denly by telehealth instead of in-office 
visits, that would mean hundreds of 
millions of visits a year would be by 
telehealth. It is hard for me to imagine 
that there has been a bigger change in 
the delivery of healthcare services in 
recent history or maybe in our coun-
try’s history than the sudden shift to 
telehealth in visits between patients 
and doctors. 
Telehealth has been around for a long 
time. Our witnesses testified to that. 
We had some excellent witnesses. Dr. 
Rheuban from the University of Vir-
ginia; Dr. Kvedar from Harvard, who is

the new president of the American 
Telemedicine Association; Dr. Arora, 
who is the founder of Project ECHO, 
which is well known across the coun-
try; and Dr. Andrea Willis, who is the 
chief medical officer of Blue Cross Blue 
Shield of Tennessee, which apparently 
is the first major insurance company 
to say that it will insure telehealth 
visits in the same way that it insures 
other visits. 
What I recommended following the 
hearing was that two of the policy 
changes—which I judge to be the two 
most important changes in policy that 
the 
Federal 
Government 
made—be 
made permanent. 
The first is that physicians can be re-
imbursed for a telehealth appointment 
wherever the patient is, including the 
patient’s home. That would change the 
originating site rule, as it is called. 
The second is that Medicare, during 
COVID–19, has begun to reimburse pro-
viders for nearly twice as many types 
of telehealth services. That rule, those 
changes, I believe, also should be made 
permanent. 
What has happened is that we have 
had an incredible pilot program on 
telehealth. We have crammed 10 years 
of experience into 3 months, and we 
have a rare opportunity to look at the 
3 months of experience and make a de-
cision about what works, what doesn’t 
work, and right the rules of the road 
for the future. 
It is not just the Federal Government 
changing, I think, a total of 31 dif-
ferent policies, all of which we should 
examine, but States have made some 
changes too. Those changes involve al-
lowing individuals to cross State lines 
more easily to get appointments with 
doctors with whom they need to talk. 
Then the private sector is beginning 
to change too. I don’t know of other in-
surance companies that have done 
what Tennessee Blue Cross Blue Shield 
did, but I know there will be some who 
decide on their own to begin to move to 
cover those services. 
Senator BRAUN and Senator CASSIDY 
on our committee brought up the point 
that we want to watch carefully to see 
that we are not just adding to the cost 
of healthcare by telehealth; in fact, we 
ought to have an opportunity to reduce 
it. Our goal is always, when delivering 
healthcare services, to have as an ob-
jective a better outcome, a lower cost, 
and a better patient experience. It may 
very well be possible that telehealth 
not only improves the patient experi-
ence—we have had very few complaints 
about the experience of that—and im-
proves the outcomes, but it may also 
lower costs, which is a major objective 
of our committee. 
Last week, 10 days ago, I issued a 
white 
paper 
about 
the 
changes 
I 
thought we needed to make—Congress 
needs to make—so that we could be 
well prepared for the next pandemic 
after COVID–19, the one we know will 
surely come. We don’t know when, we 
don’t know what the name of the virus 
will be, but we know it will come, and 
we need to take a number of steps to be 
as well prepared for that virus as we 
can. 
Whether its accelerating treatments 
and testing and finding a vaccine or 
collecting data in a different way or 
better coordination of Federal officials, 
all of those things are part of what we 
need to examine, and we need to do 
that this year—this year—because our 
attention spans are short in this coun-
try. We move on quickly to the next 
crisis. While COVID–19 is fresh on our 
minds, we should do whatever we need 
to do to get ready for the next crisis. 
We should do those things this year. 
Among those things we need to do 
this year is to make permanent the 
changes in Federal policy on telehealth 
that allowed this explosion of doctor 
and patient meetings by remote visits. 
People have been trying to think of 
ways to do this for a long time. Unfor-
tunately, it took a pandemic to cause 
it to happen. Now, while we can see the 
result, make sure we don’t have unin-
tended consequences that are unfortu-
nate. While we are doing that, we need 
to make those changes. 
So I recommend to my colleagues, 
the testimony from our excellent wit-
nesses this morning. There were 884 
million doctor-patient visits in 2016 in 
the United States, and very few of 
them were by telehealth. In the future, 
the estimates are there could be as 
many as 20, 25, 30 percent of all of 
them, hundreds of millions of doctor- 
patient visits, by telehealth. That most 
likely is the largest change in the de-
livery of medical services that our 
country has ever seen. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
OPENING STATEMENT 
TELEHEALTH: LESSONS FROM THE COVID–19 
PANDEMIC—JUNE 17, 2020 
I spoke recently with Tim Adams, the CEO 
of Ascension Saint Thomas Health, which 
has 9 hospitals in Middle Tennessee and em-
ploys over 800 physicians, who told me that 
in February before COVID–19, there were 
about 60,000 visits between patients and phy-
sicians each month. 
Almost all of those visits were done in per-
son. Only about 50 were done remotely 
through telehealth using the internet. 
But during the last two months, Ascension 
Saint Thomas conducted more than 30,000 
telehealth visits—or around 45 percent of all 
its visits—because of changes in government 
policy and the inability of many patients to 
see doctors in person during the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Tim Adams expects that to level off at 15– 
20 percent of all its visits going forward. 
The largest hospital in San Francisco told 
me that 5 percent of its visits in February 
were conducted through telehealth—and the 
hospital considered that to be a very high 
number. Then in March, telehealth visits 
made up more than half of all its visits. 
Because of COVID–19, our health care sec-
tor and government have been forced to 
cram 10 years’ worth of telehealth experience 
into just the past three months. 
As dark as this pandemic event has been, it 
creates an opportunity to learn from and act 
upon these three months of intensive tele-
health experiences, specifically what perma-
nent changes need to be made in federal and 
state policies. 
In 2016, there were almost 884 million visits 
nationwide between patients and physicians, 
according to the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. If, as Tim Adams expects, 
15–20 percent of those were to become remote 
due to telehealth expansion during COVID– 
19—that would produce a massive change in 
our health care system. 
Our job should be to ensure that change is 
done with the goals of better outcomes and 
better experiences at a lower cost. 
Part of this explosion in remote meetings 
between patients and physicians has been 
made possible by temporary changes in fed-
eral and state policies. The private sector, 
too, has made important changes. One pur-
pose of this hearing is to find out which of 
these temporary changes in federal policy 
should be maintained, modified, or re-
versed—and also to find out if there are any 
additional federal policies that would help 
patients and health care providers take ad-
vantage of delivering medical services using 
telehealth. 
Of the 31 federal policy changes, the three 
most important are: 
1. Physicians can be reimbursed for a tele-
health appointment wherever the patient is, 
including in the patient’s home. That change 
was to the so-called ‘‘originating site’’ rule, 
which previously required that the patient 
live in a rural area and use telehealth at a 
doctor’s office or clinic. 
2. Medicare began to reimburse providers 
for nearly twice as many types of telehealth 
services, including: emergency department 
visits, initial nursing facility visits and dis-
charges, and therapy services. 
3. Doctors are allowed to conduct appoint-
ments using common video apps on your 
phone, like Apple FaceTime, or phone 
texting apps, or even on a landline call, 
which required relaxing federal privacy and 
security rules from the Health Insurance 
Portability 
and 
Accountability 
Act, 
or 
HIPAA. 
Many states made changes as well, most 
importantly making it easier for doctors to 
continue to see their patients who may have 
traveled out of state during the pandemic. 
For example, a college student from Mem-
phis, who attends college in North Carolina 
and has a doctor she sees in Chapel Hill, was 
able to go home to Tennessee during the pan-
demic and continue seeing her Chapel Hill 
doctor by FaceTime. Or, a patient in Iowa 
has been able to start seeing a new psychia-
trist in Nashville. 
The 
private 
sector 
adapted 
to 
these 
changes, too. One of our witnesses today is 
from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee, 
which has already begun to make permanent 
adjustments to its telehealth coverage poli-
cies based on some of the temporary federal 
changes in Medicare. 
Looking forward, of the three major fed-
eral changes, my instinct is that the origi-
nating site rule change and the expansion of 
covered telehealth services should be made 
permanent. 
One purpose of this hearing is to hear from 
the experts and discuss whether there may 
be unintended consequences, positive or neg-
ative, if Congress were to do that. 
It’s also important to examine the other 28 
temporary changes in federal policy. 
The question of whether to extend the 
HIPAA privacy waivers should be considered 
carefully. There are privacy and security 
concerns about the use of personal medical 
information by technology platform compa-
nies, as well as concerns about criminals 
hacking into these platforms. When HIPAA 
notification requirements are waived, a per-
son might not even know that their personal 
information has been accessed by hackers.

Additionally, several of these technology 
platforms have said they want to adjust 
their platforms to conform with the HIPAA 
rules. 
Another lesson from these three months is 
that telehealth or teleworking or tele-learn-
ing is not always the answer, especially for 
people in rural areas or low-income urban 
areas who do not have access to broadband. 
And still another lesson is that personal 
relationships involved in health care, edu-
cation, and the workplace cannot always be 
replaced by remote technology. Children 
have learned about all they want to learn 
over the internet, patients like to see their 
doctors, and workplaces benefit from em-
ployees actually talking and working with 
one another in person. There are some limits 
on remote learning, health care, and work-
ing. 
There are obvious benefits to allowing 
health care providers to serve patients 
across state lines during a public health cri-
sis. As a former governor, I am reluctant to 
override state decisions, but it may be pos-
sible to encourage further participation in 
interstate compacts or reciprocity agree-
ments. 
Last week I released a white paper on steps 
that Congress should take before the end of 
the year in order to get ready for the next 
pandemic. One of those recommendations 
was to make sure that patients do not lose 
the benefits that they have gained from 
using telehealth during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Even with an event as significant as 
COVID–19, memories fade and attention 
moves quickly to the next crisis, so it is im-
portant for Congress to act on legislation 
this year. 
Because of this 10 years of telehealth expe-
rience crammed into 3 months—patients, 
doctors, nurses, therapists, and caregivers 
can write some new rules of the road, and 
should do so while the experiences still are 
fresh on everyone’s minds.

THE COOL ONLINE ACT 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to encourage all 
Americans to join the fight to support 
our Nation and our jobs and stand up 
against the growing threat of Com-
munist China. I have been saying it for 
months, but the best way each and 
every one of us can make a difference 
is to buy American products whenever 
possible. It is time we addressed the 
new Cold War occurring between the 
United States and the Chinese Com-
munist Party and be crystal clear 
about the negative impacts of con-
tinuing to buy Chinese-made products. 
Communist China is stealing Amer-
ican jobs and technology and spying on 
our citizens. Data collected by Chinese 
companies is shared with the Com-
munist Government of China, which is 
focused solely on global domination. 
Xi, the General Secretary of the China 
Communist Party, is a dictator and 
human rights violator who is denying 
basic rights to the people of Hong 
Kong, cracking down on dissidents, 
militarizing the South China Sea, and 
imprisoning 
more 
than 
1 
million 
Uighurs in internment camps simply 
because of their religion. 
The coronavirus pandemic should be 
the last straw. We can no longer rely 
on other countries like Communist 
China for our critical supply chain. 
Washington politicians have been too 
concerned with short-term political 
success and have long ignored the long- 
term threats to our way of life. 
It is time for action. Now, more than 
ever, Americans must remember that 
every time we buy a product made in 
China, we are putting another dollar 
into the pockets of the people who 
steal our technology, deny people their 
basic human rights, and are propping 
up dangerous dictators like Maduro in 
Venezuela. 
I am proud to lead my colleagues in 
a 
bipartisan 
resolution 
calling 
on 
Americans to buy products made in the 
United States whenever possible. Buy-
ing American is not partisan, and I am 
glad my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle are coming together to encourage 
Americans to take a stand. 
I know it is not always easy, but it is 
an important step we can all take at 
home to support American jobs, Amer-
ican producers, and American manufac-
turers and help build up the U.S. sup-
ply chain. 
I am also working with Senator 
BALDWIN to pass our COOL Online Act, 
which will make sure all goods sold on-
line list their country of origin to cre-
ate more transparency for American 
consumers. 
In my State, we take immense pride 
in products made in Florida. It is a 
driving force that led to our incredible 
economic turnaround. A return to this 
pride in homegrown businesses ensures 
America remains strong and the undis-
puted leader in the global economy. We 
must all do our part to support our Na-
tion and make it clear to Communist 
China that the United States will not 
stand for their behavior. 
I am committed to supporting Amer-
ican businesses over Chinese products. 
I hope my colleagues will join me. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from Tennessee. 
PROTESTS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, for 
more than 200 years, the American peo-
ple have exercised their right to peti-
tion the government for a redress of 
grievances. We understand how very vi-
tally important it is for each of us to 
have that right to petition our govern-
ment, to have our say. 
But just as we learned from our 
moms and dads when we were kids, 
there is a right way and there is a 
wrong way to get things done when we 
feel that, in our opinion, the govern-
ment has fallen short. I would under-
stand if this differentiation between 
right and wrong sometimes causes con-
fusion because, although the American 
people are united in their desire for 
justice and equality, that sense of 
unity, they feel, is under attack. 
Over the past few weeks, we watched 
thousands 
of 
protesters 
peacefully 
march in the memory of George Floyd 
and countless other Black Americans 
who have been killed—who have lost 
their lives at the hands of law enforce-
ment. Sometimes these protests are 
vigils, and they are very quiet. There 
are other times they fill the streets 
and they are a bit disruptive and they 
demand accountability from their gov-
ernment in a way that has really cap-
tured the attention of the entire world. 
On the other side, however, we have 
watched professional agitators who 
have come into some of these protests, 
and then they have turned them into 
riots. The self-prescribed culture war-
riors silence anyone and anything that 
deviates from their own chosen nar-
rative, and that is very unfortunate. 
The paths we take to achieve our de-
sired outcomes are informed by the 
goals we have, not the other way 
around. This is why we must question 
the goals of those whose activism has 
taken a repressive turn because peace-
ful protest is an essential element of 
addressing government. That is how 
you achieve change. That is how you 
get people with you and working with 
you. It is a part of who we are. 
This absolute protection against sup-
pression in any form makes the recent 
dismantling of meaningful public dis-
course all the more disturbing because 
as you look back through our Nation’s 
history, you realize freedom and free-
dom’s cause has been well served by ro-
bust, respectful, bipartisan debate— 
hearing all voices. 
Do you remember how sometimes we 
would joke about the cancel culture be-
cause it was the product of social 
media influencers and overenthusiastic 
fan clubs? What we see now is that has 
taken hold of the entertainment indus-
try, corporations, and editorial boards. 
Outrage manufactured along partisan 
lines dominates every news cycle, all 
in an intentional and targeted effort to 
divide the American people and, there-
by, what would that do? It destroys our 
cultural identity. If this isn’t what 
chilling speech looks like, then I don’t 
know what does. 
I would like to be able to say this 
body stands united against this wave of 
malice or that I am confident we have 
demonstrated a commitment to real 
reform, but I fear that we have not yet 
arrived at that place. In spite of every-
thing, in spite of it being clear that 
those who seek to divide and destroy 
this country are working just as hard 
as those who seek to unite it, other pri-
orities remain in play. This has become 
especially evident today. 
JUSTICE ACT 
Last week, my friend and colleague 
Senator TIM SCOTT from South Caro-
lina announced that he was leading a 
working group with the goal of draft-
ing a comprehensive police reform bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3053 
June 17, 2020 
You all know what happened next. He 
spoke about it just a few hours ago, but 
I think it is important to get on the 
record just one more time today that 
he deserves our thanks, and he deserves 
credit. 
Before Senator SCOTT had a chance 
to write a single word of his bill, some 
of our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle were ready to shut it down. It 
was stunning. Let me read you a few of 
these statements. 
Someone said they suspect it ‘‘is 
going to be window dressing.’’ Another 
said: ‘‘It’s so far from being relevant to 
really the crisis at hand.’’ Another: 
‘‘This is not a time for lowest common 
denominator, watered down reforms.’’ 
And then there was another unfortu-
nate comment for which an apology 
was offered late today, and that apol-
ogy was accepted. All of this is dis-
appointing. It is hurtful, yes, but dis-
appointing because this is a time when 
we have to carry on. We have to move 
forward. 
Senator SCOTT announced the intro-
duction of the JUSTICE Act. I am hon-
ored to be a cosponsor of that legisla-
tion, and I think it is imperative that 
we move forward with our discussions 
and our deliberations just as we would 
with any other bill. This Chamber is 
going to find a way to move forward 
with suggestions, but, above all, I urge 
my colleagues to consider some of the 
words that have been said. I urge them 
to take those words to heart, and I 
urge them to remember what we are 
fighting for and to stop focusing so 
hard on whom you have convinced 
yourself that you should be fighting 
against. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
POLICING REFORM 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, as ev-
erybody knows, this country faces an 
extraordinary set of crises—crises that 
are unprecedented in the modern his-
tory of our country. 
Over the last several weeks, hundreds 
of thousands of Americans have taken 
to the streets and courageously de-
manded an end to police murder and 
brutality and to urge us all to rethink 
the nature of policing in America. In 
the midst of all that, we continue, of 
course, to suffer from the COVID–19 
pandemic, which has taken the lives of 
over 115,000 Americans and infected 
over 2 million of our people. 
Then, on top of that, we are experi-
encing the worst economic meltdown 
since the Great Depression of the 1930s, 
with over 32 million Americans having 
lost their jobs in the last 3 months. In 
the midst of all of that, enough truly is 
enough. 
The U.S. Senate must respond to the 
pain and the suffering of our constitu-
ents. Let us begin work today, not next 
week, not next month but right now in 
addressing the unprecedented crises 
our people are facing. If there is any-
thing that the torture and murder of 
George Floyd by Minneapolis police 
has taught us, it is that we have to fun-
damentally rethink the nature of polic-
ing in America and reform our broken 
and racist criminal justice system. 
Let us be clear—and I think every-
body understands this—the murder of 
George Floyd is not just an isolated in-
cident. It is the latest in an endless se-
ries of police killings of African Ameri-
cans, including Rayshard Brooks, Eric 
Garner, Sandra Bland, Laquan McDon-
ald, 
Tamir 
Rice, 
Alton 
Sterling, 
Freddie Gray, Rekia Boyd, Walter 
Scott, and many, many others. 
The American people are rightly de-
manding justice and an end to police 
brutality and murder. And we have to 
hear that cry coming from all across 
this country, from large cities and 
small towns, and the Senate must act 
and act now. 
Here is some good news in the midst 
of a lot of bad news, and that is thanks 
to a massive grassroots movement, the 
Senate will finally begin to debate leg-
islation dealing with the police. That is 
a good thing. The bad news is that the 
Republican legislation, at least what I 
have seen this morning, goes nowhere 
near far enough as to where we need to 
go. 
Now is not the time to think small or 
respond with superficial, bureaucratic 
proposals. Now is not the time for more 
studies. Now is the time to hold racist 
and corrupt police officers and police 
departments accountable for their ac-
tions. Now is the time to implement 
far-reaching reforms that would pro-
tect people and communities that have 
suffered police brutality, torture, and 
murder for far too long. Now is the 
time to act boldly to protect the First 
Amendment right to protest. 
Let me very briefly describe some of 
the areas in which I think the Congress 
should move with regard to police bru-
tality and the whole issue of policing. 
First, and maybe most importantly, 
every police officer in our country 
must be held accountable, and those 
found guilty must be punished with the 
full force of law. That includes officers 
who stand by while brutal acts take 
place. Every single killing of a person 
by police or while in police custody 
must be investigated by the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
We must create a process by which 
police departments look like the com-
munities they serve and be part of 
those communities, not be seen as in-
vading, 
heavily 
armed, 
occupying 
forces. That is not what police depart-
ments should look like. We must, 
therefore, prohibit the transfer of De-
partment of Defense military equip-
ment to police departments. 
Further, we need to abolish qualified 
immunity so police officers are held 
civilly liable for abuses. We need to 
strip Federal funds from departments 
that violate civil rights. We need to 
provide funding to States and munici-
palities to create a civilian core of un-
armed first responders to supplement 
law enforcement. 
For too long, we have asked police 
departments to do things which they 
are not trained or prepared to do, and 
we have criminalized societal problems 
like addiction and homelessness and 
mental illness, severe problems that 
exist in every State in the country. 
But these are not problems that will be 
solved by incarceration. We are not 
going to solve the crisis of addiction or 
homelessness or mental illness by in-
carceration. We have done that for too 
long, and it is a failed approach. 
We need to make records of police 
misconduct publicly available so that 
an officer with a record of misconduct 
cannot simply move two towns over 
and start again. We need to require all 
jurisdictions that receive Federal grant 
funding to establish independent police 
conduct review boards that are broadly 
representative of the community and 
that have the authority to refer deaths 
that occur at the hands of police or in 
police custody to Federal authorities 
for investigation. We need to amend 
Federal civil rights laws to allow more 
effective prosecution of police mis-
conduct by changing the standard from 
willfulness to recklessness. We need to 
ban the use of facial recognition tech-
nology by the police. 
Finally, and certainly not least im-
portantly, we need to legalize mari-
juana. In the midst of the many crises 
we face as a country, it is absurd that, 
under the Federal Controlled Sub-
stances Act, marijuana is at schedule 1, 
along with killer drugs like heroin. 
State after State have moved to legal-
ize marijuana, and it is time for the 
Federal Government to do the same. 
When we talk about police department 
reform, we must end police officers 
continuing to arrest, search, or jail the 
people of our country, predominantly 
people of color, for using marijuana. 
We need to ban the use of rubber bul-
lets, pepper spray, and tear gas on pro-
testers. The right to protest, the right 
to demonstrate is a fundamental, con-
stitutional right and a right that must 
be respected. 
RACISM 
But let us be clear. Police violence is 
not the only manifestation of the sys-
temic racism that is taking place in 
America today. Just take a look at 
what is going on with the COVID–19 
pandemic. In recent months, we have 
seen Black and Brown communities 
disproportionately 
ravaged 
by 
this 
virus. We have seen workers, who earn 
starvation wages, forced to go to work 
day in and day out in unhealthy work-
place environments because, without 
that paycheck, they and their families 
would go hungry. These working class 
families have, with enormous courage, 
kept our economy and society together 
in hospitals, in meat-packing plants, in

public 
transportation, 
in 
super-
markets, gas stations, and elsewhere. 
These workers—again, disproportion-
ately Black and Brown—have risked in-
fection and death so that the rest of us 
can continue to get the food that we 
need, get our medicines, or put gaso-
line in our car. In the wealthiest coun-
try in the history of the world, workers 
should not have to choose between 
going hungry on one hand or getting ill 
or dying on the other. 
When we talk about starvation wages 
in this country, I was happy to hear 
today that Target has raised its min-
imum wage for its many, many thou-
sands of workers to $15 an hour. That is 
something that I and many others here 
have long advocated for. This follows a 
decision 2 years ago by Amazon to 
raise the minimum wage for their 
workers to $15 an hour and the effort in 
seven States across this country to 
raise their minimum wage to $15 an 
hour. 
Now is the time for Walmart—the 
largest employer in America, owned by 
the wealthiest family in America—to 
also raise their minimum wage to $15 
an hour. I should add that the Walton 
family, the family that owns Walmart, 
can more than afford to do this be-
cause, since Donald Trump has been 
President, their wealth has increased 
by about $75 billion. Let me repeat. 
Their wealth has increased by about 
$75 billion in the last 3-plus years, and 
they are now worth some $200 billion as 
a family. You know what? I think the 
Walton family can afford to pay their 
workers $15 an hour. 
By the way, when we talk about ra-
cial justice, please understand that 
about half of Black workers in this 
country earn less than $15 an hour. 
Further, the House has done the 
right thing by passing legislation to 
raise the Federal minimum wage to $15 
an hour. The time is long overdue for 
the Senate to do the same. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Despite what we hear from the 
Trump administration, the COVID–19 
pandemic is far from over. In fact, as 
you may know, nine States today— 
nine States—hit record highs for new 
cases in a single day. What we have 
seen unfold over the last several 
months and continue to see unfold is 
an administration that continues to ig-
nore the recommendations from sci-
entists and physicians. 
No one doubts anymore, for example, 
that masks can play an important role 
in cutting back on the transmission of 
the virus. We need to utilize the De-
fense Production Act and manufacture 
the hundreds of millions of high-qual-
ity masks our people and our medical 
personnel desperately need. As part of 
the Defense Authorization Act, I will 
be offering an amendment to do just 
that. Other countries around the world 
are sending masks on a regular basis to 
all of their people. We can and should 
do exactly the same thing. 
Not only do we need to act boldly and 
aggressively to address this horrific 
pandemic that we are experiencing, not 
only do we need to act boldly to fix a 
broken and racist criminal justice sys-
tem, but we need to respond with a 
fierce sense of urgency to the worst 
economic crisis in the modern history 
of our country. 
Over the last 3 months, over 30 mil-
lion Americans have lost their jobs, 
and because half of our people live pay-
check to paycheck, having virtually 
nothing in savings, many of those peo-
ple are now facing economic despera-
tion. Today, all across our country, 
tens of millions of Americans are in 
danger of going hungry. In Vermont 
and in States all over America, we are 
seeing long lines of people in their cars 
lining up in order to get food that the 
Federal Government is now supplying. 
But it is not just food. Millions of 
Americans are frightened to death that 
they will soon be evicted from their 
apartments or lose their homes to fore-
closure. Imagine that. In the middle of 
an economic meltdown, in the middle 
of a pandemic, millions of people are in 
danger of being thrown out onto the 
streets. 
Further, as part of the economic cri-
sis, we are in danger of losing over half 
the small businesses in this country 
within the next 6 months—impossible 
to contemplate. Half of all small busi-
nesses in America are threatened with 
destruction. 
I would say to Senator MCCONNELL 
and the Republican leadership here in 
the Senate that the American people 
cannot afford to wait. They need our 
help now, not a month from now, not 2 
months from now. We need to respond 
vigorously to the enormous economic 
pain and suffering and anxiety that the 
American people, today, are experi-
encing. 
What does that mean specifically? It 
means, among other things, that the 
Federal Government must guarantee 
100 percent of the paychecks and bene-
fits of American workers up to $90,000 a 
year through a Paycheck Security Act, 
which is legislation that I introduced 
with Senators WARNER, JONES, and 
BLUMENTHAL. Countries in Europe that 
have taken this approach have not ex-
perienced the skyrocketing levels of 
unemployment we have seen here in 
the United States. 
As a result of the economic down-
turn, we know that over 16 million 
Americans have already lost their 
health insurance. Further, there are es-
timates that that number could go as 
high as 43 million people losing their 
health insurance, and that is on top of 
the 87 million Americans who were al-
ready uninsured or underinsured before 
the pandemic. 
Responding with a fierce sense of ur-
gency to the economic crisis means 
that, in the midst of the horrific pan-
demic, every man, woman, and child in 
this 
country 
must 
receive 
the 
healthcare they need, regardless of 
their income. That means that Medi-
care must be empowered to pay all of 
the healthcare bills of the uninsured 
and underinsured until this crisis is 
over. If this crisis has taught us any-
thing, it has taught us that we are only 
as safe as the least insured among us. 
Responding with a fierce sense of ur-
gency means providing every working- 
class person in America with a $2,000 
emergency payment each and every 
month until this crisis is over, so that 
they can pay the rent, feed their fami-
lies, and make ends meet. A one-time 
$1,200 check does not cut it. An emer-
gency $2,000 monthly payment will 
serve also as a major stimulus in reviv-
ing the economy. 
Responding with a fierce sense of ur-
gency means making sure that no one 
in America goes hungry, which means 
that we have got to substantially ex-
pand the Meals on Wheels program, the 
school meals program, and SNAP bene-
fits. 
Responding with a fierce sense of ur-
gency means making sure that the 
Postal Service receives the emergency 
funding that it desperately needs. If we 
could bail out large corporations, if we 
could provide over $1 trillion in tax 
breaks to the wealthy and the power-
ful, please do not tell me that we can-
not save and strengthen the Postal 
Service, an agency of huge importance 
to our entire economy. 
Acting with a fierce sense of urgency 
means extending the $600 a week in ex-
panded unemployment benefits that 
expires in July. Failure to extend these 
benefits would slash the incomes of 
millions of Americans by 50, 60 or even 
70 percent. You can’t do that in the 
midst of an economic crisis. 
Here we are today. We are in the 
midst of the worst public health crisis 
in over 100 years, and the Republican 
Senate is doing nothing about it. We 
are in the midst of the worst economic 
crisis since the Great Depression of the 
1930s. People all over this country in 
every State in America are financially 
hurting, and the Republican Senate 
today is doing nothing about that. We 
continue to see African Americans bru-
tally murdered and tortured by racist 
police officers, and the Republican Sen-
ate leadership proposes a woefully in-
adequate solution. 
Now, I understand that not everyone 
in America is hurting, not everyone in 
America needs help from the Senate. 
While over 32 million Americans have 
lost jobs during this horrific pandemic, 
630 billionaires in America have seen 
their wealth go up by $565 billion— 
amazing, but true. Over the first 3 
months 
of 
this 
horrific 
pandemic, 
America’s top 630 billionaires have seen 
their wealth go up by $565 billion—hard 
to believe. 
In other words, at a time of massive 
income and wealth inequality, which is 
already today worse than at any time 
since the 1920s, a horrific situation is 
becoming much worse. During the last 
3 months, while the very, very rich 
have become much richer, American 
households have seen their wealth go 
down by $6.5 trillion. Billionaires see 
their wealth increase by over $600 bil-
lion; American households see their

wealth go down by $6.5 trillion. In the 
midst of everything else that we are 
experiencing, we are currently wit-
nessing what is likely the greatest 
transfer of wealth from the middle 
class and the poor to the very rich in 
the modern history of our country. 
In the midst of these unprecedented 
crises, it is time for the Senate to act 
in an unprecedented way. In every 
State in this country, our constituents 
are hurting, and they are calling out 
for help. Let us hear their cries. Let us 
hear their pain. Let us act and act now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
CHINA 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor this evening to talk 
about China and to talk about how we 
can have a better relationship with 
China, one that is fair and equitable. 
I am going to talk specifically about 
some of the investigations and reports 
that we have worked on here in the 
U.S. Congress over the past couple of 
years. I am going to be talking about 
four specific reports that came out of 
what is called the Permanent Sub-
committee on Investigations. I chair 
that subcommittee. It is under the 
Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs, and it is a com-
mittee that takes these investigations 
seriously. We do a fair, objective, thor-
ough job. All of our investigations are 
bipartisan. I am going to talk a little 
about why these investigations that we 
have done have led me to the conclu-
sion that we need to do much more 
here in this country to be able to re-
spond to China and to be able to have 
the kind of fair and equitable relation-
ship that we should all desire. 
A lot of China’s critics talk about the 
fact that China needs to do things dif-
ferently, and I don’t disagree with 
most of that, but the reality is there is 
much we can do right here in this 
country to create a situation in which 
we do not have the issues that I will 
talk about tonight—some of the unfair 
activities that have occurred here in 
this country. Frankly, I think we have 
been naive and not properly prepared. I 
will also talk about some legislation 
that we are proposing tomorrow morn-
ing, which will focus on how to make 
America more effective at pushing 
back against a specific threat to our 
research and our intellectual property. 
Our goal is not to have China as an 
enemy. Our goal is to actually have 
China as a strategic partner, wherein 
there is a fair and equitable and sus-
tainable relationship, but it is going to 
require some changes. Again, I am 
going to focus tonight on some changes 
we need to make right here, changes 
that are within our control. 
Our investigations have been thor-
ough—in fact, driven—and our reports 
have been objective, bipartisan, and 
eye-opening, and I encourage you to go 
on the PSI website—psi.gov—and check 
it out. 
Our first report was in February of 
2019. It detailed a lack of transparency 
and reciprocity, among other concerns, 
with the Confucius Institutes that 
China operates here in this country. 
These Confucius Institutes are at our 
colleges and universities. Some people 
are aware of that, but some may not be 
aware that they are also at our elemen-
tary schools, middle schools, and high 
schools. Our reports show how these 
Confucius Institutes have been a tool 
to stifle academic freedom where they 
are located, toeing the Chinese Com-
munist Party line on sensitive issues 
like Tibet or Taiwan or the Uighurs or 
Tiananmen Square. 
By the way, when I talk about China 
tonight, I hope people realize I am not 
talking about the Chinese people. I am 
talking about the Chinese Government; 
therefore, I am talking about the Chi-
nese Communist Party. With regard to 
the Confucius Institutes, for example, 
which are spread around this country, 
ultimately, they report to a branch of 
the Chinese Government that is in-
volved with spreading positive propa-
ganda about China. Ultimately, it is 
controlled by whom? The Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
So I hope the comments I make to-
night will not be viewed as comments 
that are regarding the Chinese people 
as much as a small group in China, the 
Chinese Communist Party, that, with 
regard to the Confucius Institutes and 
other approaches it has taken to the 
United States, have led to these issues. 
By the way, it is thanks to our report 
and to the broader scrutiny that fol-
lowed that we learned about the lack of 
academic freedom and about the fact 
that history is being taught a certain 
way at the Confucius Institutes. By the 
way, it also pointed out that the Chi-
nese language is taught. It is a good 
thing to have this intercultural dia-
logue and the opportunity to learn 
more about China, but there needs to 
be, again, an understanding and a his-
tory of China that is fair and honest, 
which does include discussions of what 
happened in Tiananmen Square or 
what is happening today with regard to 
the 
Uighurs—a 
minority 
group 
in 
China that is being oppressed. 
In the year that followed our scru-
tiny—so, really, in the last year and a 
few months—23 of the, roughly, 100 
Confucius Institutes on college cam-
puses in America have closed, and oth-
ers have made some positive changes as 
to how they operate. So I believe our 
report made a significant difference in 
terms of how we relate to the Confu-
cius Institutes. 
I said earlier that one of my concerns 
about the Confucius Institutes was the 
lack of reciprocity. When our State De-
partment has attempted to set up 
something comparable on Chinese uni-
versity campuses, it has been unable to 
do so. In fact, whereas the Confucius 
Institute employees and members of 
the Chinese Government are able to 
come on our college campuses, we are 
told that U.S. Government officials 
and, for that matter, private citizens 
cannot go on Chinese campuses with-
out having a minder, somebody to be 
there to monitor what they are doing. 
Sometimes they are not permitted to 
go at all, which goes to the lack of rec-
iprocity. 
Yet my goal, really, is to, again, talk 
about what we can do here. I would 
urge those tonight who are watching 
and who are connected with a college 
or a university that still has a Confu-
cius Institute—or a high school or a 
middle 
school 
or 
an 
elementary 
school—to check it out. Check out our 
report in which we have many in-
stances when the American students 
who are learning there are not getting 
the full story. That may not be true in 
the case of all Confucius Institutes, but 
I would recommend that you do the re-
search yourself. 
Then, in March of 2019, after the Con-
fucius Institute report, our report into 
the Equifax data breach here in Amer-
ica showed how China had targeted pri-
vate U.S. companies and stolen the in-
formation of millions of Americans. In 
the Equifax data breach of 2017, which 
we studied and which is one of the larg-
est in history, the personal informa-
tion of 147 million Americans was sto-
len by IP addresses that originated in 
China. So we should just be aware of 
that, and we should take precautions 
and protections and encryptions and 
security measures here to avoid it. 
Again, this is about our doing more 
here in this country to be prepared for 
the reality of the 21st century. 
Then, in November of last year, we 
released another eye-opening report, 
this one detailing the rampant theft of 
U.S. taxpayer-funded research and in-
tellectual property by China by way of 
its so-called talent recruitment pro-
grams—meaning, China systematically 
finds promising researchers who are 
doing work on research that China is 
interested in, and China recruits them. 
These programs have not been subtle. 
The Thousand Talents Plan is the most 
understood 
of 
these 
programs, 
al-
though there are a couple hundred oth-
ers. Yet we showed, in studying the 
Thousand Talents Plan, how this prob-
lem has been ongoing for two decades 
in this country. Through this program, 
much of what China has taken from 
our labs and then taken to China has 
gone directly toward fueling the rise of 
the Chinese economy and the Chinese 
military. 
Again, this is about China, but it is 
really about us. How have we let this 
happen? 
Specifically, we found that the Chi-
nese Government has targeted this 
promising, U.S.-based research and its 
researchers. Often, this research is 
funded by U.S. taxpayers. As tax-
payers, we spend $115 million a year on 
research to places like the National In-
stitutes of Health or to the National 
Science Foundation or to the Depart-
ment of Energy for basic science re-
search. It has been a good investment 
because, through some of these invest-
ments, we have discovered cures to par-
ticular kinds of cancer and tech-
nologies that have helped our military,

but it is not good if the U.S. taxpayer 
is paying for this research and then 
China is taking it. 
China has not just taken some of this 
research funded by U.S. taxpayers but 
has paid these grant recipients to take 
their research over to the Chinese uni-
versities in China—again, universities 
that are affiliated with the Chinese 
Communist Party. This is not about 
the people of China. This is about the 
Chinese Communist Party, and it has 
been very clever. It wants to make sure 
that China is a stronger competitor 
against us, so it literally takes the re-
search from the United States to a lab 
in China where it tries to replicate the 
research and provide the money to 
these researchers. 
Just last week, we released a fourth 
PSI report that showed that this prob-
lem of China’s not playing by the rules 
extends to the telecommunications 
space as well. Let me explain that situ-
ation. Then I will go back to the Thou-
sand Talents Program. 
You may remember that, in May of 
last year, the FCC prohibited a com-
pany called China Mobile and its U.S. 
subsidiary 
from 
providing 
telecom 
services from the United States on the 
grounds that doing so would jeopardize 
our national security—the first time 
such a ruling had been issued. The fact 
that this was only the first time that a 
foreign telecommunications company 
had been denied approval to operate in 
the U.S. on national security grounds 
prompted us to investigate other Chi-
nese state-owned carriers that were al-
ready authorized to operate in the 
United States. We asked an important 
question: Why was China Mobile USA 
any different than these other three 
Chinese companies? 
We discovered in our report, which 
again we issued just a month ago, that 
it wasn’t different. We conducted a 
yearlong investigation into the govern-
ment processes for reviewing, approv-
ing, and monitoring Chinese state- 
owned telecommunications firms oper-
ating here in the United States, and we 
found, once again, over the years, the 
Federal Government had been lax when 
it comes to securing our telecommuni-
cations networks against risks posed 
by Chinese state-owned carriers. Again, 
it is what we can do here in this coun-
try that we haven’t done. 
In fact, three Chinese state-owned 
carriers have been operating in the 
U.S. for nearly 20 years, but it has only 
been in recent years that the FCC, the 
Department of Justice, and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security have fo-
cused on the potential risks these firms 
bring when they operate in the United 
States. What we didn’t know 20 years 
ago, we do know today, and we should 
use that information to protect our-
selves. 
We now know that the Chinese Gov-
ernment views telecommunications as 
a strategic industry and has expended 
significant resources to create and pro-
mote new business opportunities for its 
state-owned carriers. We also learned 
in our investigation and said in our re-
port that Chinese state-owned tele-
communications carriers are ‘‘subject 
to exploitation, influence, and control 
by the Chinese government’’ and can be 
used in the Chinese government’s cyber 
and economic espionage efforts aimed 
at the United States. 
This isn’t a surprise. We have seen 
this time and time again that the Chi-
nese Government targets the United 
States through cyber and economic es-
pionage activities and enlists its state- 
owned entities in these efforts. The 
Chinese 
telecommunications 
firms 
have been part of our U.S. tele-
communications industry as a result, 
and, of course, that is critical to our 
everyday life. Its services from cellular 
networks to broadband internet con-
nections help break down barriers be-
tween people, nations, and continents. 
That is good. It has helped our econ-
omy and the economies of many other 
countries grow immensely. We all ben-
efit 
when 
telecommunications 
are 
global. 
It makes sense then that the Federal 
Government has tasked the FCC with 
ensuring that foreign telecommuni-
cations can establish a foothold in the 
United States, but only if it is done in 
a fair and safe manner. Again, what we 
have learned is that the FCC and other 
Federal agencies have been slow to re-
spond to the national security threats 
these telecom companies can pose in 
terms of cyber security and economic 
espionage. 
As we detail in our report, the FCC, 
which lacks the national security and 
law enforcement expertise required to 
assess these risks, has turned to other 
executive branch agencies to assess 
them, specifically the Department of 
Justice, the Department of Homeland 
Security, and the Department of De-
fense, a group commonly known as the 
Team Telecom. 
Team Telecom was an informal ar-
rangement and has lacked formal au-
thority to operate, making it overall 
an ineffective solution to assessing 
these risks. The informality has re-
sulted in protracted review periods and 
a process FCC Commissioners have de-
scribed as broken and an inextricable 
black hole that provided ‘‘no clarity 
for the future.’’ 
For example, Team Telecom’s review 
of China Mobile USA’s application 
lasted for 7 years. This points to a 
troubling trend we have found in all of 
these reports—how, frankly, our gov-
ernment and our institutions over a 
space of time, the last couple of dec-
ades, have permitted China to take ad-
vantage of lax U.S. oversight, be it on 
our college campuses, our research 
labs, or in cyberspace. 
At our PSI hearing on the Thousand 
Talents report, the FBI witness before 
us acknowledged as much saying: 
With our present day knowledge of the 
threat from Chinese talent plans, we wish we 
had taken more rapid and comprehensive ac-
tion in the past. And the time to make up for 
that is now. 
That is our own Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. Again: ‘‘We wish we had 
taken more rapid and comprehensive 
action in the past.’’ They don’t say 
that often, but it is true, and I com-
mend them for saying it at the hearing 
and for starting to make up for it now 
because they have made a number of 
arrests just in the past few months 
with regard to the Talents program. 
It is my hope that PSI’s work has 
opened the eyes of our government to 
these systemic problems, and I think 
that is the case, as what we have seen 
in the Trump administration is they 
have taken a firmer stance towards the 
Chinese Government in every one of 
the four areas I talked about. 
As PSI was nearing the end of its 
telecom investigation, for example, the 
responsible 
Federal 
agencies 
an-
nounced that they would review wheth-
er these Chinese state-owned carriers 
that we were studying should continue 
to operate in the U.S., given the na-
tional security threats. The Trump ad-
ministration also recently issued an 
Executive order to establish Team 
Telecom as a formal committee, which 
is a good idea, as well as addressing 
many of the issues the subcommittee 
report identified in Team Telecom’s 
processes. 
Again, these are good steps, and I am 
pleased to say that they were prompted 
by the thorough and, again, objective, 
nonpartisan inquiry that we made 
through PSI. These four investigations 
combined show us that China, frank-
ly—and, again, the Chinese Govern-
ment and the Chinese Communist 
Party, not the people of China—is not 
going to play by the rules unless we re-
quire it. Until we start to clean up our 
own house and take a firmer stance on 
foreign influence here in this country, 
we are not going to see much improve-
ment. Rather than pointing the finger 
at China, we ought to be looking at our 
own government and our own institu-
tions and doing a better job here. 
Along those lines, I found it inter-
esting that, just last week, 54 NIH- 
funded researchers nationwide have re-
signed or have been fired because they 
had been found to be hiding their ties 
to foreign research institutions as part 
of an NIH investigation into this prob-
lem. Again, after our PSI investigation 
talking about how the Thousand Tal-
ents 
program 
and 
other 
programs 
work, there are now 54 people just last 
week who have been fired or have re-
signed. 
Of the cases NIH has studied, 70 per-
cent of the researchers failed to dis-
close foreign grant funding, while more 
than half failed to disclose participa-
tion in a foreign talent program like 
Thousand Talents. By the way, the FBI 
just 
recently 
warned 
universities 
across the country that China may be 
attempting to steal our research on the 
coronavirus—therapies, 
antiviral 
therapies, vaccines, other research. 
This problem is ongoing. 
I think, in a fair and straightforward 
manner, we have got to insist that

June 17, 2020 
there be a level playing field. We have 
got to insist that there be fairness and 
accountability, again, in an objective 
manner and a straightforward manner. 
At the same time, our law enforce-
ment officials and other Federal enti-
ties that are working to hold China ac-
countable are limited in the actions 
they can take. That is part of cleaning 
up our own house. We need to make 
some changes around here, including in 
our laws, which has to come through 
this body. 
In the case of the Thousand Talents 
plan, we have seen first-ever arrests re-
lated to Thousand Talents recently. 
They followed our investigation, our 
report, and our hearings. We even saw 
it in my home State of Ohio. All of the 
arrests in connection with the Thou-
sand Talents plan, by the way, had 
been related to peripheral financial 
crimes, like wire fraud and tax eva-
sion—not the core issue of a conflict of 
commitment, the taking of American 
taxpayer-paid research. 
Why? Because amazingly, it is not 
currently a crime to fail to disclose 
foreign funding of the same research on 
Federal grant applications. In other 
words, if you are doing research and 
paid by the taxpayer of the United 
States in your research and also being 
paid by China to do the same research 
and to have the research go to China, 
you don’t have to disclose that under 
law. 
These arrests that have been made 
haven’t been about that core issue. 
They have been about other things like 
tax evasion or wire fraud, kind of like 
they went after the gangsters in the 
old days on tax evasion because they 
couldn’t get them on a RICO statute. 
We need to change the laws so that 
we can give our law enforcement com-
munity the tools they need to be able 
to do the job that all of us expect is 
being done. It is incumbent upon Con-
gress to work in a bipartisan manner 
to pass those laws and to put a stop to 
this behavior. 
This shouldn’t be a partisan issue, 
and it isn’t. It is about defending the 
interests of the United States, and that 
is something we should all agree on. 
The good news is we are starting to do 
just that. Tomorrow, we plan to intro-
duce bipartisan legislation called the 
Safeguarding American Innovation Act 
based on recommendations from our 
Thousand Talents report from late last 
year to protect U.S. taxpayer-funded 
research. 
First and foremost, our bill is going 
to help the Department of Justice go 
after Thousand Talents participants by 
holding them accountable for failing to 
disclose their foreign ties on Federal 
grant applications. Again, it is a tool 
that they desperately need. Our bill 
goes directly to the root of the prob-
lem. It makes it punishable by law to 
knowingly fail to disclose foreign fund-
ing on Federal grant applications. 
This isn’t about more arrests. We 
should all agree that transparency and 
honesty on grant applications are crit-
ical to the integrity of U.S. research 
and the U.S. research enterprise. These 
provisions will help promote those 
principles as well. 
Our bill also makes other important 
changes from our report. It requires 
the Office of Management and Budget, 
OMB, to streamline and coordinate 
grant making between the Federal 
agencies so there is more continuity 
and 
accountability 
in 
coordination 
when it comes to tracking the billions 
of dollars of taxpayer-funded grant 
money that is being distributed. This 
kind of transparency is long overdue. 
We have worked closely with the Na-
tional Science Foundation, with the 
National Institutes of Health, with the 
Department of Energy, and others on 
this legislation, and they agree this is 
very important. Our legislation also al-
lows the State Department to deny 
visas to foreign researchers who they 
know are seeking to steal research and 
intellectual property by exploiting ex-
emptions in our current export control 
laws. 
This may surprise you, but the State 
Department can’t do that now. Career 
Foreign Service Officers and employees 
at the State Department have asked us 
to please provide them this authority. 
They testified before our hearing, ask-
ing us to help them to be able to do 
what they know needs to be done. 
Our bill also requires research insti-
tutions and universities to provide the 
State Department basic information 
about sensitive technologies that a for-
eign researcher would have access to. 
Providing this information as part of 
the visa process should help streamline 
the process for the State Department 
and for the research institutions. 
This allows for college campuses to 
rely on the State Department to do 
some of the vetting for these appli-
cants and to help keep bad actors off 
the campus. This is why many research 
institutions and universities will be en-
dorsing our legislation tomorrow be-
cause we have worked with them on 
this issue and others, including new 
transparency 
standards 
for 
univer-
sities. 
They are now going to be required to 
report any foreign gift of $50,000 or 
more, which is a lower level from the 
current threshold of $250,000, but it is 
also going to empower the Department 
of Education to work with these uni-
versities and research institutions to 
ensure that this can be complied with 
in a way that doesn’t create undue red-
tape and expenditures. It also allows 
DOE to fine universities that repeat-
edly fail to disclose these gifts. 
I believe this legislation can be a 
model going forward as to how we use 
the lessons we have learned from these, 
again, objective and straightforward 
PSI reports to get to the root causes of 
these cases. We have gotten widespread 
support across my home State of Ohio, 
from research leaders, hospitals, col-
leges and universities, and other stake-
holders who want to see us continue to 
have an open and transparent research 
system and have the United States be 
the center in the globe for innovation 
and research, but to ensure that can 
continue to happen, they want to be 
sure we are holding China accountable. 
We are now at work on this legisla-
tion to codify into law some of the 
steps taken by the Trump administra-
tion in response to our new tele-
communications PSI report as well. 
This legislation we will introduce to-
morrow will be led by myself and Sen-
ator TOM CARPER, my colleague from 
the other side of the aisle from Dela-
ware, who was also my partner on this 
report with regard to the Thousand 
Talents program and the hearing. 
We also have five other Democrats 
who will be joining us tomorrow, all of 
whom have an interest and under-
standing of this complicated issue. We 
will also have about an equal number 
of Republicans joining us, probably six 
to eight Republicans. So, again, this is 
going to be a bipartisan effort—I would 
say even a nonpartisan effort—to en-
sure that, in a smart, sensible, prac-
tical way, we can respond to the threat 
that we are facing, in this case, from 
China taking our intellectual property, 
our innovations, our ideas, and taking 
them to China and using them in 
China, sometimes against the United 
States. 
In addition to the four examples we 
discussed tonight, the subcommittee 
will continue its work to shine a light 
on other examples where China and 
other countries aren’t living by the 
rules, so we can ensure that, with re-
gard to China and in regard to other 
foreign governments, we can create a 
more durable and a more equitable and 
a more sustainable relationship be-
tween our countries. 
Again, we don’t want to be enemies 
with China, but what we do want is to 
have a relationship with mutual re-
spect. When we have the right to ask 
them that they treat us with the same 
respect that we treat them, at the end 
of the day, that is what is going to be 
best for the Chinese people, best for the 
American people, and best for all of us 
moving forward. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3058 
June 17, 2020 
Westmacott, on the occasion of what 
would have been the meeting of the G7 
at Camp David. Peter is the former 
U.K. ambassador to the United States 
and a thoughtful diplomat if there ever 
was one. He previously served as am-
bassador to France and ambassador to 
Turkey. Unburdened by the self-con-
sciousness 
that 
sometimes 
plagues 
American policymakers critical of the 
Trump administration, he writes hon-
estly and insightfully to a British 
Prime Minister of the ways President 
Trump has weakened America’s stand-
ing as an international leader and how 
others stand to capitalize from our di-
minished role. In the midst of a global 
pandemic 
compounded 
by 
climate 
change, multiple armed conflicts and 
humanitarian crises, Russian aggres-
sion and expanding Chinese influence, 
when global leadership and cooperation 
are needed more than ever, the inco-
herence and isolationism of this White 
House are appalling. 
Over many years, I have worked with 
Senators of both parties, with Repub-
lican and Democratic administrations, 
and with foreign leaders. I disagreed 
with, as well as those with whom we 
have much in common. The most suc-
cessful makers of foreign policy share 
an adherence to the truth, objectively 
and uniformly acknowledged; a rec-
ognition of the importance of engage-
ment with the rest of the world; and 
the goal of seeking common ground to 
make progress on shared interests. 
Unfortunately, President Trump fails 
on each of these counts. As Sir Peter 
describes, he disregards facts for his 
preferred 
fictitious 
narratives. 
He 
turns away from our allies and picks 
fights with our trading partners. He 
impulsively 
withdraws 
from 
inter-
national agreements that took years to 
negotiate because he does not stand to 
benefit personally or politically from 
them. He has abandoned our role as a 
moral and strategic leader. He crafts 
foreign policy by tweet. It is a dis-
grace, and foreign diplomats and heads 
of state, with the exception of our ad-
versaries and autocrats who stand to 
benefit 
by 
mimicking 
President 
Trump, are confused, worried, and ap-
palled. 
Sir Peter aptly describes this sorry 
state of affairs and what it means for 
our country and the world. 
I ask unanimous consent that Sir 
Peter Westmacott’s letter be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[June 10, 2020] 
AN EX-AMBASSADOR’S VIEW OF A WORLD 
WITHOUT POLITICAL LEADERSHIP 
(By Peter Westmacott) 
DEAR
PRIME
MINISTER: This week you 
should have been meeting up with your G7 
colleagues at Camp David. Covid–19 has 
stopped that happening but there is so much 
going on that I thought I should send you my 
briefing note anyway. 
President Trump was delighted to be host. 
He always likes to be centre stage but the 
summit would have been a welcome distrac-
tion from his slow and confused response to 
the pandemic and from how, in marked con-
trast to his predecessor, he made things 
worse not better when Americans took the 
streets following the killing of George Floyd 
in Minneapolis. Every judgement he makes 
from now until 3 November will be viewed 
through the prism of whether it helps him 
win a second term. 
That is currently looking less likely than 
before the pandemic. Trump’s base is holding 
up—he has delivered hundreds of conserv-
ative judges, sided with white supremacists, 
stood up for the gun lobby and given tax cuts 
to the wealthy. His attempts to smear his 
opponent Joe Biden don’t currently seem to 
be working but much will depend on whether 
there are signs of an economic bounce-back 
before election day; and on turn-out, espe-
cially in the six critical swing states of 
Pennsylvania, 
Michigan 
and 
Wisconsin 
where Trump sealed it last time, plus Flor-
ida, North Carolina and Arizona. Democrats 
I talk to currently point to the betting 
spreads—not just the polls—slightly favour-
ing Biden and dare to hope for a clean sweep 
of White House and Senate (not even Repub-
licans expect the Democrats to lose the 
House). 
The summit would have taken place 
against a background of failure of the global 
institutions, including the G7—to organise a 
meaningful collective response to the C19 
crisis. Everyone knows that the WHO chose 
to praise rather than lambast China for its 
performance in the early stages of the out-
break, in the hope of eliciting a more honest 
and transparent response. But your counter-
parts are clear that Trump’s decision to 
walk away from the WHO had more to do 
with pointing the finger of blame before the 
US elections than with improving our ability 
to act collectively. 
This is symptomatic of a wider problem— 
the disappearance of US moral and strategic 
leadership under Trump. The causes are le-
gion: take for example his protectionist 
focus on ‘America First’, the trade wars with 
China and the EU, the undermining of NATO, 
the renunciation of international arms con-
trol agreements, of the Iran nuclear deal, his 
trashing of the Middle East Peace Process, 
his 
vainglorious 
but 
failed 
attempt 
to 
denuclearise North Korea, his abandonment 
of the Paris climate accords, and his unique 
contribution to the creation of a posttruth 
world in which the West has largely forfeited 
the right to call out others for bad behav-
iour. 
Crises accelerate trends more than they 
create new ones. When Covid–19 hit us, the 
free world was already rethinking its atti-
tude towards the rise of a China more inter-
ested in consolidating the power of the com-
munist party and its leader, Xi Jinping, than 
in the welfare of its people or engagement 
with the rest of the world on any other than 
its own terms. 
You will recall coming under heavy US 
pressure in January to exclude Huawei from 
Britain’s 5G telecoms infrastructure. Allies 
and friends in South East Asia were already 
very exercised about China’s militarisation 
programme and disregard of the findings of 
the UN Law of the Sea Convention rejecting 
its territorial claims. Taiwan was feeling 
threatened while China’s attempt last year 
to impose an extradition treaty on Hong 
Kong was a foretaste of its attempt now, 
under cover of the pandemic crisis, further 
to undermine ‘‘one country, two systems’’ 
with new national security laws jeopardising 
the territory’s fundamental freedoms. 
Covid–19 has also accelerated the concern 
of China’s trading partners about the resil-
ience of their supply chains. Early in the cri-
sis, Jaguar Land Rover had to halt produc-
tion because of a lack of components made 
in Wuhan. Companies the world over are now 
looking again at whether ‘just-in-time’ de-
liveries from far away Chinese suppliers need 
supplementing with ‘just-in-case’ arrange-
ments nearer home. 
Your own launch of Project Defend de-
signed to improve the resilience of strategi-
cally important firms is being matched by 
similar rethinking elsewhere in Europe, 
where Macron and Merkel have joined forces 
to press for greater EU sovereignty. That in 
turn followed the EU’s decision last year to 
designate China as ‘‘a systemic rival pro-
moting alternative systems of governance’’, 
as concern has grown around China’s in-
creasingly apparent agenda of seeing the 
Western model of individual liberty, freedom 
of expression and democracy replaced by ac-
ceptance of authoritarianism and the party- 
state. 
China likes to pick off individual coun-
tries, as we in the UK have seen in the past. 
After Australia called for an independent in-
vestigation of the Covid–19 outbreak, China 
imposed an 80% tariff on its imports of Aus-
tralian barley. So it will be important to 
forge a common approach. It was unfortu-
nate that in March US Secretary of State 
Pompeo blocked a G–7 statement on the pan-
demic because other governments would not 
agree to describing it as ‘‘the Wuhan virus’’. 
But Dominic Raab’s call with the foreign 
ministers of our Five Eyes intelligence part-
ners on 2 June to discuss Hong Kong was a 
good start. 
As far as possible, however, we should aim 
to work with rather than against China. It is 
heavily invested in the global economy and 
has vast trade surpluses with the rest of the 
world. It has also begun to move in the right 
direction on imports and inward invest-
ment—if not yet on protection of intellec-
tual property. But as you have made clear 
with your offer of a path to citizenship for 
Hong Kong’s British passport holders, that 
cannot be at the cost of surrendering funda-
mental principles or reneging on our inter-
national commitments. 
Trump has said he thinks Putin should be 
invited to the next G7 summit, whenever it 
takes place. You have said firmly that you 
don’t agree, for the very good reason that 
there has not been the improvement in Rus-
sian behaviour in Ukraine required by the 
Minsk agreements. Trump is close to Putin, 
and his business dealings with Russia go 
back many years. So he may try again, per-
haps with the support of Macron who wants 
to ‘‘re-engage’’ with Russia. 
In Putin’s playbook, compromise is weak-
ness so you may need to remind your col-
leagues of his mission to recover the ground 
he thinks Russia lost in what he has called 
the ‘‘greatest geopolitical disaster of the 
20th Century’’ when the Soviet Union im-
ploded; of Russia’s role in systematically un-
dermining elections in free countries; and of 
the Kremlin’s nasty habit of trying to mur-
der its critics and opponents on the streets 
of British cities. 
Your European counterparts are likely to 
raise their concerns at the current state of 
Brexit negotiations. They have understood 
that you won’t be asking to extend the tran-
sition period beyond the end of the year. 
They would like a deal to be reached in the 
remaining six months since they too will be 
losers if there isn’t one. But just as your 
team argue that the Commission are being 
unreasonable, and have moved the goalposts, 
so Barnier & Co think we have changed our 
position since you concluded the Withdrawal 
Agreement and political declaration last 
year and that the bespoke arrangement we 
are asking for is much more than the simple 
Canada-style agreement we say we want.

the hope that political leaders will come to 
the rescue is unlikely to work: we should be 
preparing for either stop-the-clock at the 
end of December while a last-minute fudge is 
worked out, or no deal at all. 
Beyond those detailed negotiations lie 
some big issues related to Britain’s place in 
the world and our global influence. The E3 
arrangement between France, Germany and 
the UK still functions, and is helping to 
manage the fall-out from Trump’s abandon-
ment of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. More 
generally, on many of the big international 
issues the UK is more naturally aligned 
these days with its European partners than 
with the US. But there is still a sense that 
we currently have little bandwidth or incli-
nation to play the kind of substantive for-
eign policy role we have played in the past, 
and disappointment in EU capitals that we 
don’t want to include foreign and security 
policy in the structure of our new post- 
Brexit 
relationship. 
I 
would 
say 
this, 
wouldn’t I, but we need to guard against the 
risk that, despite the talk of Global Britain, 
we find ourselves unable to exercise as much 
influence outside the EU as we did inside it— 
a concern shared by foreign policy experts in 
Washington. 
So at some point you might want to con-
sider boosting our soft and hard power alike 
by bringing together the substantial re-
sources of our defence, international devel-
opment, international trade and foreign min-
istries in more joined-up fashion to restore 
the UK’s global credibility, trust and diplo-
matic clout. Our friends feel we have left the 
stage and want us back. We have in the past 
come up with original ideas, built bridges 
and helped solve problems. We should aspire 
to do so again.

THE AIR TOUR AND SKYDIVING 
SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 
2020 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, in 2019, 
21 people died in Hawaii in three tragic 
air recreation accidents involving heli-
copters or planes. 
On December 26, 2019, while many of 
us were enjoying the holidays with our 
loved ones and friends, seven people 
lost their lives when an air tour heli-
copter crashed into a mountain on the 
Island of Kauai. All aboard the heli-
copter were killed, a mother and 
daughter from Wisconsin, a family of 
four from Switzerland, and the pilot. 
We still do not know the cause of the 
crash. In April 2019, an air tour heli-
copter crashed on a street in the resi-
dential neighborhood of Kailua on the 
island of Oahu, killing all aboard: two 
passengers and the pilot. We were for-
tunate that no one on the ground was 
injured. On June 22, 2019, 11 people died 
when a small plane crashed during 
take-off on a skydiving trip from 
Dillingham Airfield on Oahu. In the 
first accident of 2020, on March 5, six 
people walked away after a hard land-
ing of an air tour helicopter on the Big 
Island of Hawaii. No one on the heli-
copter was seriously injured. 
Since 2015, the National Transpor-
tation Safety Board, or NTSB, has in-
vestigated 10 air tour accidents in Ha-
waii and more than 46 nationwide. 
Senator SCHATZ and I are introducing 
the Air Tour and Skydiving Safety Im-
provement Act of 2020. The bill takes 
the outstanding safety issues and rec-
ommendations identified by the NTSB 
to improve the safety and account-
ability of air sightseeing tours and 
parachute tours. The Federal Aviation 
Administration, or FAA, has not im-
plemented the NTSB’s recommenda-
tions. 
In most years, Hawaii welcomes 
nearly 10 million visitors annually to 
enjoy everything Hawaii has to offer, 
from our Aloha spirit displayed by our 
resident, to the scenic beauty of the 
State. It is critical that the helicopters 
and planes taking both visitors and 
residents sightseeing or parachuting 
operate as safely as possible. 
The NTSB has recommended mul-
tiple improvements to the standards 
covering air tour and parachute oper-
ations by the FAA. In the aftermath of 
the helicopter crash in Kailua and the 
crash of two chartered floatplanes in 
Alaska, NTSB Chairman Robert L. 
Sumwalt said in May 2019: ‘‘While 
these tragic accidents are still under 
investigation, and no findings or causes 
have been determined, each crash un-
derscores the urgency of improving the 
safety of charter flights by imple-
menting existing NTSB safety rec-
ommendations.’’ To highlight this ur-
gency, the NTSB put improvements to 
air tour aircraft on its 2019–2020 Most 
Wanted List of transportation safety 
improvements. 
Let me describe the provisions of the 
legislation. First, the bill requires 
parachute and air tour companies to 
operate under the same standards as 
other commercial air operations, such 
as commuter airlines under Part 135, 
which has certification standards. Cur-
rently, commercial companies can op-
erate like private civil aircraft if they 
operate within 25 miles of their airport, 
under regulations found in Part 91. The 
NTSB recommends that all commercial 
air operations meet the same standards 
for training, certification, operations, 
and crew rest under part 135. 
The bill requires that the FAA estab-
lish a standard for terrain awareness 
and warning systems and minimum 
standards for training pilots to avoid 
flying into mountains and other ter-
rain. This may have prevented the heli-
copter crash on Kauai in December 
2019, which crashed into the side of a 
mountain. 
Following 
another 
NTSB 
rec-
ommendation, the bill requires opera-
tors install crash-resistant flight data 
recording equipment, we can learn 
more from accidents and to help iden-
tify flaws in equipment and improve 
pilot performance. 
The helicopter involved in the De-
cember 2019 crash in Kauai lacked 
flight data monitoring, so inspectors 
were uncertain of its flight path and 
performance. The bill requires the FAA 
to establish and implement a standard 
for remote monitoring of flight data. It 
also requires operators to establish a 
flight data monitoring program to 
identify changes from normal proce-
dures and other potential safety issues. 
The bill includes provisions to make 
sure that the current and future rec-
ommendations of the NTSB are given 
full consideration by the FAA. It re-
quires the FAA to indicate how their 
response to NTSB safety recommenda-
tions will meet or exceed safety out-
comes of the NTSB ’s recommenda-
tions, if the FAA declines to adopt the 
NTSB recommendations. The bill also 
directs the U.S. Department of Trans-
portation 
to 
include 
NTSB 
rec-
ommendations on air tours and para-
chute operations in its annual report 
on aviation safety. 
The safety of parachute operations 
would be improved by the standards 
that I have described, but the bill also 
addresses the unique safety needs of 
parachute operations. The bill would 
require the FAA to develop new or re-
vised regulations for parachute oper-
ations, including enhanced mainte-
nance and inspection for aircraft and 
training and recurrent testing require-
ments for pilots. 
The bill we are introducing today 
would make great improvements to in-
crease the safety of air tours. This is a 
first step. But this legislation does not 
address all the issues with air tour hel-
icopters. The issues of noise, frequency, 
and safety associated with air tour op-
erations in the State of Hawaii have 
been going on for decades. 
In September 2016, at the request of 
State Representative Onishi, my office 
requested a meeting for Big Island 
State legislators with the FAA Hono-
lulu Flight Standards District Office, 
or FSDO, to address the issue of the 
helicopter noise for residents in East 
Hawaii. We learned at this meeting 
that FAA–FSDO and Hawaii Depart-
ment of Transportation do not have 
the authority to address the noise issue 
raised by the community. 
In March 2017, FAA and the National 
Park Service representatives traveled 
to Hawaii from their DC headquarters 
to convene public listening sessions in 
Honolulu and Hilo, respectively, ‘‘to 
better identify specific concerns with 
helicopter operations within and out-
side of national parks.’’ Community 
members were looking for relief from 
noise issues associated with air tour 
overflights over residential areas. 
We were hopeful that these meetings 
were a signal of FAA’s engagement so 
we could address community concerns 
with the air tour operators. Individuals 
from the community came prepared 
and raised questions about how other 
communities across the country have 
dealt with this issue including the New 
York North Shore Helicopter Route 
and the adjustments to routes over Los 
Angeles County. 
State and local governments, air tour 
companies, and the community were 
interested in engaging. Unfortunately, 
while the FAA initiated the meetings, 
they disappointed many in our commu-
nity when they announced that their 
agency could only offer technical ad-
vice and the effort did not result in an 
air tour safety plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3060 
June 17, 2020 
In another example of FAA inaction, 
Congress required the FAA and the Na-
tional Park Service to develop air tour 
management plans for our national 
parks under the Air Tour Management 
Act of 2000. For two decades, inter-
agency fighting prevented any progress 
from being made. In 2018, the Hawaii 
Island Malama Pono Coalition and 
Public Employees for Environmental 
Responsibility, groups representing na-
tional park employees and visitors, 
filed a petition in Federal court to 
compel the agencies to regulate air 
tours at seven parks. 
On May 1, 2020, the U.S. Circuit Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
ordered the FAA and the National 
Park Service to develop air tour man-
agement plans for 23 national parks, 
including Haleakala National Park and 
Volcanoes National Park in Hawaii. 
The court found that the agencies’ ef-
forts were ‘‘underwhelming,’’ ‘‘ulti-
mately unsuccessful,’’ and failed to de-
velop the plans in a reasonable amount 
of time. 
The court expects the agencies to de-
velop the air tour management plans 
for all 23 parks within 2 years, and the 
court will retain jurisdiction to con-
tinue oversight until the agencies have 
completed the plans. 
Volcanoes National Park was the 
subject of 8,333 air tour flights in 2018, 
over 22 flights per day, the highest 
number of air tour flights of any na-
tional park. Haleakala had the fourth 
most air tour flights in 2018, with 4,757 
flights. The residents in the sur-
rounding communities in the flight 
path and visitors trying to enjoy the 
quiet of nature are all too aware of the 
visual and the noise from air tour 
flights. 
With the decision by the Court, many 
in Hawaii now expect action in the de-
velopment of air tour management 
plans for Hawaii’s two national parks. 
Of course, air tours affect residents 
and communities in Hawaii throughout 
the State. On January 9 of this year, 
members of the Hawaii Helicopter As-
sociation, 
Hawaii 
Department 
of 
Transportation’s Airports Division, ap-
pointees from the State legislature, 
and other stakeholders formed the Ha-
waii Air Noise and Safety Task Force 
with representatives from the FAA as 
technical advisers. The task force was 
created 
to 
‘‘fund 
public 
meetings, 
produce 
a 
study 
and 
make 
rec-
ommendations concerning the heli-
copter and fixed wing tour industry.’’ 
It remains clear to me that the FAA 
needs to address its failure to oversee 
the air tour industry. On January 31, 
Senator SCHATZ and I joined in the 
Senate Commerce Committee’s request 
for an investigation by the inspector 
general of the Department of Transpor-
tation into allegations that the FAA’s 
Honolulu Flight Standards District Of-
fice ignored serious concerns about the 
safety of helicopter air tours in Hawaii. 
We requested an investigation into the 
oversight lapses raised by the whistle-
blowers. The ongoing investigation by 
the inspector general will show wheth-
er FAA is able to enforce its own rules 
in Hawaii. 
What remains clear is that the NTSB 
has recommended additional standards 
to the FAA to improve safety through-
out the country, but the FAA has not 
addressed these safety issues. We have 
waited long enough for action. 
The legislation we are introducing 
will strengthen the rules to ensure ac-
countability and safety for Hawaii’s 
aviation operators and travelers.

FIVE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF 
CHARLESTON CHURCH SHOOTING 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, 5 years 
have passed, and it still feels like a bad 
dream, but we know it actually hap-
pened. The senseless murder of nine pa-
rishioners at Mother Emanuel hit 
South Carolina like a ton of bricks. It 
remains hard to understand how any-
one could have so much hate in their 
heart. To be welcomed into a church, 
worship with the parishioners, and 
then turn around and shoot them in 
cold blood remains one of the most hor-
rific acts ever recorded. 
Then just days after this horrible 
tragedy, the people at Mother Emanuel 
showed a level of love and forgiveness 
that was truly unimaginable. It was an 
act that is rarely seen. I personally 
cannot imagine turning to the person 
who killed my family members saying, 
I forgive you. I know that type of grace 
can only come from God. Of all the 
things that I have seen in public life, 
the words from the family members 
continue to amaze me to this day. You 
must truly have the love of the Lord in 
your heart to be able to muster that 
kind of forgiveness. 
On the 5-year anniversary, we think 
of those who lost their lives and the 
families left behind, the Christmases 
without loved ones, the birthdays 
missed. Our hearts are still broken, and 
our prayers remain with the parish-
ioners at Mother Emanuel.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DR. AMY ACTON 
∑ Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to express my appreciation for a 
great Ohioan and public servant, Dr. 
Amy Acton, for her leadership and ex-
pertise while serving as the director of 
the Ohio Department of Health. 
Born and raised in Youngstown, OH, 
Dr. Acton knew she wanted to be a doc-
tor from a young age. She attended 
Northeastern Ohio University School 
of Medicine, studying pediatrics and 
preventive medicine. Dr. Acton contin-
ued her education, earning a master’s 
degree in public health from the Ohio 
State University, where she went on to 
teach as an associate professor. 
In 2019, Governor Mike DeWine ap-
pointed her to lead our State’ s health 
department, the first woman to hold 
the position in Ohio’s history. 
That job is always critical, public 
health is one of the most important 
jobs our government does, and until a 
few months ago, it was too often under-
appreciated. But 17 months ago, few 
could have predicted just how vital Dr. 
Acton’s role would be, as she stepped 
up to lead Ohio’s response to the 
COVID–19 pandemic. On March 22, 2020, 
while much of the Nation was still in 
denial about the quickly evolving pan-
demic, Dr. Acton led the charge and 
issued a statewide stay at home order, 
making Ohio one of the first States to 
do so. Understanding that the best 
leaders are open and honest, Dr. Acton 
participated in the Governor’s daily 
press conferences. She answered ques-
tions and helped explain the threat of 
COVID–19 and the actions her depart-
ment was taking to keep Ohioans safe 
through clever analogies, from brewing 
storms to Swiss cheese. 
Throughout the spring, under Dr. Ac-
ton’s leadership, Ohio continued to 
lead the country in taking bold action 
to slow COVID–19’s spread. Dr. Acton’s 
early 
intervention, 
supported 
by 
science and data, saved lives and sig-
nificantly slowed the spread of the 
virus in Ohio. 
Dr. Acton put the life and well-being 
of people over politics. She used empa-
thy and honesty to educate, inform, 
and comfort Ohioans in uncertain 
times, exceeding the duties expected of 
her, to ensure the health and safety of 
her fellow Ohioans. 
Thank you, Dr. Acton, for your wis-
dom, bravery, and compassion through-
out the COVID–19 pandemic. Your lead-
ership saved countless lives in Ohio. I 
am sure my Senate colleagues will join 
me in thanking Dr. Amy Acton for her 
exemplary efforts.∑

2020 SERVICE ACADEMY 
APPOINTEES FROM UTAH 
∑ Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today 
to honor 14 exemplary young Utahns 
who have answered the call of service 
to our country. 
Each year, Members of Congress are 
authorized to nominate a number of 
young men and women fro their dis-
trict or State to attend our Nation’s 
service academies: the U.S. Air Force 
Academy, the U.S. Military Academy, 
and the U.S. Naval Academy. 
The men and women whom I nomi-
nated on behalf of the State of Utah 
this year are some of the best and 
brightest in our country. 
Each of these students is of sound 
mind and body, which will serve them 
well in Colorado Springs, West Point, 
and Annapolis. But the journey on 
which these young men and women will 
soon 
embark 
demands 
more 
than 
strength of mind and strength of body. 
It demands strength of character. It re-
quires qualities of leadership, courage, 
honesty, prudence, and selfdiscipline. 
It calls for a commitment to service 
and a love of country. And ultimately, 
it requires a willingness to give the ul-
timate sacrifice on behalf of the safety 
and security of our Nation.

To these 14 students and to all their 
future classmates from around the 
country, I thank you for your commit-
ment to service and commend your 
achievements. While this is but the be-
ginning of your journey, I urge you to 
remember the foundation of your suc-
cess thus far. 
You would not have arrived at this 
point without the dedication and exam-
ple of your parents, family, teachers, 
coaches, and mentors. Moreover, you 
would not have arrived at this point 
without your own sacrifice and hard 
work. 
Strive to continue on the path of 
strong moral character, and to keep 
love of country as a guiding principle. 
Look to the past with gratitude and to 
the future with conviction. If you stay

future holds great things in store. 
I wish you all the best as you embark 
on this journey. 
Thank you.∑

REMEMBERING GLENN DOCKHAM 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Glenn A. 
Dockham of Milton, VT. 
Glenn lived a life of service. He was a 
Peace Corps volunteer, a U.S. Customs 
officer, and the president of the Na-
tional Treasury Employees Union— 
NTEU—Chapter 142. It was in his ca-
pacity as a labor leader that my staff 
and I had the pleasure of working with 
Glenn and came to greatly respect his 
perspective. I am proud to have called 
on his perspective on a number of occa-
sions to discuss important labor issues. 
During one occasion, when I organized 
a panel to discuss labor concerns at the 
Department of Homeland Security, 
Glenn provided valuable insights as the 
voice at the table representing NTEU 
members. At this time, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security was still a 
relatively 
new 
agency, 
and 
Glenn 
helped us to fight for the needs of his 
members.

June 17, 2020 
I have always considered Glenn a fair 
and trusted voice in the labor move-
ment and a tireless advocate for Fed-
eral employees. I was grateful for his 
leadership and the commitment that 
he demonstrated throughout his ca-
reer. He set an excellent example in his 
professional life. 
In addition to his work, family was 
very important to Glenn. He leaves be-
hind his wife, Lisa, and his two chil-
dren, Marcy and Tim. He considered his 
greatest accomplishment to be raising 
his children. I have no doubt he set an 
equally powerful example of hard work, 
kindness, and service for them and oth-
ers in his life. 
Please join me in honoring the life 
and legacy of Glenn Dockham.∑

REMEMBERING MARNY XIONG 
∑ Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, today I 
would like to acknowledge the life and 
legacy of Marny Xiong, who had a pro-
found impact on her community and on 
Minnesota. 
Marny Xiong was a fierce advocate 
for her community and for students. 
During her career, she worked at 
Hmong International Academy in Min-
neapolis prior to serving as an elected 
leader on the St. Paul Public Schools 
Board of Education, including as its 
elected chairwoman. As a proud grad-
uate of St. Paul Public Schools, she 
was a passionate leader who was dedi-
cated to giving back to her commu-
nity. 
Marny Xiong was also a community 
organizer. Her vision of equity and ra-
cial justice was an inspiration to 
many, and she dedicated her life to 
that mission. Marny’s fighting spirit 
showed through her tireless efforts to 
address the impacts of structural rac-
ism. Despite the magnitude of this 
challenge, she approached her work 
and her advocacy with joy, an infec-
tious smile, and an enduring sense of 
hope for making change. 
Marny Xiong’s lasting impact will 
continue to be felt by many across the 
St. Paul community and the State of 
Minnesota, and I am proud to recognize 
and celebrate her legacy today.∑

‘‘Maximizing Use of American-Made Goods, 
Products, and Materials’’ (84 Fed. Reg. 34257), 
which would enforce the Buy American Act 
of 1933 (41 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.) to the greatest 
extent permitted by law; 
Whereas American-made products are de-
veloped under strict regulations and undergo 
testing to ensure their compliance with the 
highest safety standards; 
Whereas American-made products are pro-
duced by workers under a regulatory frame-
work that supports fair wages and safe work-
ing conditions; 
Whereas purchasing American-made prod-
ucts not only bolsters American manufac-
turing, it also supports communities and 
families throughout the United States; 
Whereas, according to the Manufacturing 
Institute, each dollar spent in sales of manu-
factured products supports $1.33 in output 
from other sectors of the economy; 
Whereas, according to a 2019 report by the 
Economic Policy Institute titled ‘‘Updated 
employment multipliers for the U.S. econ-
omy’’, every direct durable manufacturing 
job supports more than 7 indirect jobs in 
other areas of the economy, and every direct 
nondurable manufacturing job supports more 
than 5 indirect jobs in the economy; 
Whereas, according to a 2017 poll conducted 
by Reuters and Ipsos, when buying products, 
nearly 70 percent of Americans find it impor-
tant that the products they buy were made 
in the United States; 
Whereas strengthening American manufac-
turing improves both the quantity and the 
quality of employment in the United States, 
produces innovation and the seeds for future 
industries, and supports the global competi-
tiveness of the United States; 
Whereas a strong American manufacturing 
base is essential to both a healthy economy 
and to revitalizing the United States econ-
omy as it recovers from the global COVID–19 
pandemic; 
Whereas a strong domestic supply chain is 
critical to national security and public safe-
ty; 
Whereas the global COVID–19 pandemic 
presented significant challenges for the glob-
ally interconnected supply chain of medical 
products and has heightened the need for 
supply chain security of a variety of critical 
materials and products; 
Whereas 
the 
United 
States 
should 
strengthen and diversify the security of crit-
ical supply chains by prioritizing American 
manufacturing and production, and when 
necessary work closely with trusted allied 
nations to ensure global cooperation in 
times of need; and 
Whereas, regarding the manufacturing of 
critical medical supplies and products essen-
tial to national security, the United States 
must decrease its dependence on foreign na-
tions and boost domestic manufacturing to 
increase the national stock piles to ensure 
the United States has a healthy domestic in-
dustrial base that can handle any future 
surge in need for these supplies: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) it is the policy of the United States to 
‘‘Buy American’’; 
(2) the Senate supports American manufac-
turing and strengthening our American man-
ufacturing base; and 
(3) the Senate encourages Americans to 
‘‘Buy American’’ products and materials to 
the greatest extent possible.

RESOLUTION 
626—UP-
HOLDING THE CIVIL LIBERTIES 
AND CIVIL RIGHTS OF IRANIAN 
AMERICANS 
AND 
CONDEMNING 
BIGOTRY, VIOLENCE, AND DIS-
CRIMINATION 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself and 
Mr. KAINE) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 626 
Whereas Iranian Americans serve as gov-
ernment officials, in the military, and in law 
enforcement, working to uphold the Con-
stitution of the United States and to protect 
all Americans; 
Whereas Iranian Americans uphold demo-
cratic values and believe in the pillars of 
America—life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness; 
Whereas Iranian Americans are vibrant, 
peaceful, and law-abiding citizens of the 
Baha’i, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Zoro-
astrian faiths, or are nonreligious; 
Whereas Iranian Americans have contrib-
uted greatly to the social and economic fab-
ric of American society; 
Whereas the Small Business Administra-
tion finds Iranian Americans among the im-
migrant groups with the highest rates of 
business ownership in the United States; 
Whereas Iranian Americans are award-win-
ning artists, scientists, and athletes; 
Whereas the United States condemns acts 
of bigotry, violence, and discrimination; 
Whereas dozens of Americans of Iranian 
heritage were detained for several hours at 
the Peace Arch Border in Washington State 
in January 2020 based on their ethnicity or 
national origin; 
Whereas a directive was published appear-
ing to show that the Seattle Field Office di-
rected border patrol agents to target Ira-
nian, Lebanese, and Palestinian nationals 
born between 1961 and 2001 for additional vet-
ting; 
Whereas Customs and Border Protection in 
the Department of Homeland Security ini-
tially denied that there was any directive or-
dering the detainment of Iranian Americans; 
Whereas many Iranian Americans have 
been deeply shaken by this discriminatory 
treatment, with some members of the com-
munity stating that they will not travel out-
side of the country for fear of being unfairly 
targeted based on their national heritage; 
Whereas the Office of Civil Rights and 
Civil Liberties in the Department of Home-
land Security has opened an investigation 
into the detention of Iranian Americans at 
the border; 
Whereas the United States Commission on 
Civil Rights, established by the Civil Rights 
Act of 1957, said that it ‘‘expresses deep con-
cern over the treatment of Iranians and Ira-
nian Americans in airports, and calls on the 
Department of Homeland Security to take 
all necessary steps immediately to ensure 
equitable treatment of all people at Amer-
ica’s borders’’; 
Whereas according to a survey commis-
sioned by the Public Affairs Alliance of Ira-
nian Americans, the percentage of Iranian 
Americans who say they have personally ex-
perienced discrimination because of their 
ethnicity or national origin was 49 percent in 
2018; 
Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion’s 2019 Hate Crime Statistics reveals that 
the most common bias motivation of single- 
bias incidents is due to race, ethnicity, or 
ancestry bias at 59.6 percent of all incidents; 
and 
Whereas Iranian Americans have long 
faced discrimination in times of turbulence 
in the relationship between the United 
States and Iran: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns bigotry and acts of violence 
or discrimination against any American, in-
cluding Iranian Americans; 
(2) declares that government leaders and 
law enforcement personnel should ensure 
that the civil rights and civil liberties of all 
Americans, including Iranian Americans, are 
fully protected; 
(3) encourages local, State, and Federal 
elected officials to engage Iranian Americans 
to share their experiences with their commu-
nities to end stereotypes, correct misconcep-
tions, and convey instances of abuse against 
the Iranian American community; 
(4) calls upon local, State, and Federal law 
enforcement authorities to investigate and 
vigorously 
prosecute 
crimes 
committed 
against all Americans, including Iranian 
Americans, that are based on actual or per-
ceived race, color, religion, national origin, 
or ethnicity; 
(5) urges the Office of Civil Rights and 
Civil Liberties in the Department of Home-
land Security to conclude a thorough and 
timely investigation into detentions of Ira-
nian Americans at the border; and 
(6) calls on Customs and Border Protection 
in the Department of Homeland Security to 
halt immediately any orders that encourage 
discrimination on the basis of nationality or 
religion, including those targeting individ-
uals of Iranian heritage.

healthcare, employment, and housing sys-
tems in the United States, leading to a dis-
parate impact on LGBTQ people; 
Whereas the persistent failure of Federal 
and State officials to collect full and accu-
rate data on sexual orientation and gender 
identity, particularly in the current COVID– 
19 pandemic, causes tremendous harm to 
LGBTQ people in the United States, who re-
main largely invisible to the government en-
tities entrusted with ensuring their health, 
safety, and well-being; 
Whereas LGBTQ people in the United 
States serve on the front lines during the 
COVID–19 pandemic as doctors, nurses, med-
ical professionals, law enforcement officers, 
firefighters, and first responders in all States 
and the District of Columbia; 
Whereas LGBTQ people in the United 
States serve, and have served, the United 
States Army, Coast Guard, Navy, Air Force, 
and Marines honorably and with distinction 
and bravery; 
Whereas an estimated number of more 
than 100,000 brave service members were dis-
charged from the Armed Forces of the 
United States between the beginning of 
World War II and 2011 because of their sexual 
orientation, including the discharge of more 
than 13,000 service members under the 
‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’’ policy in place be-
tween 1994 and 2011; 
Whereas LGBTQ people in the United 
States serve, and have served, in positions in 
the Federal Government and State and local 
governments, including as members of Con-
gress, Governors, mayors, and city council 
members; 
Whereas the demonstrators who protested 
on June 28, 1969, following a law enforcement 
raid of the Stonewall Inn, an LGBTQ club in 
New York City, are pioneers of the LGBTQ 
movement for equality; 
Whereas, throughout much of the history 
of the United States, same-sex relationships 
were criminalized in many States and many 
LGBTQ people in the United States were 
forced to hide their LGBTQ identities while 
living in secrecy and fear; 
Whereas, on June 26, 2015, the Supreme 
Court 
of 
the 
United 
States 
ruled 
in 
Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S. Ct. 2584, that 
same-sex couples have a constitutional right 
to marry and acknowledged that ‘‘[n]o union 
is more profound than marriage, for it em-
bodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, de-
votion, sacrifice, and family.’’; 
Whereas Acquired Immunodeficiency Syn-
drome (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘AIDS’’) has disproportionately impacted 
LGBTQ people in the United States, due in 
part to a lack of funding and research de-
voted to finding effective treatment for 
AIDS and the Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘HIV’’) 
during the early stages of the HIV and AIDS 
epidemic; 
Whereas 
gay 
and 
bisexual 
men 
and 
transgender women of color have a higher 
risk of contracting HIV; 
Whereas the LGBTQ community has main-
tained its unwavering commitment to ending 
the HIV and AIDS epidemics; 
Whereas LGBTQ people in the United 
States 
face 
disparities 
in 
employment, 
healthcare, education, housing, and many 
other areas central to the pursuit of happi-
ness in the United States; 
Whereas 28 States have no explicit ban on 
discrimination based on sexual orientation 
and gender identity in the workplace, hous-
ing, or public accommodations, and 34 States 
have no explicit ban on discrimination 
against LGBTQ individuals in education; 
Whereas LGBTQ youth are at increased 
risk of— 
(1) suicide; 
(2) homelessness; 
(3) becoming victims of bullying, violence, 
and human trafficking; and 
(4) developing mental health illnesses, in-
cluding anxiety and depression; 
Whereas only 13 States and the District of 
Columbia have explicit policies in place to 
protect foster youth from discrimination 
based on both sexual orientation and gender 
identity; 
Whereas LGBTQ youth of color are over-
represented in child welfare and juvenile jus-
tice systems; 
Whereas the LGBTQ community has faced 
discrimination, 
inequality, 
and 
violence 
throughout the history of the United States; 
Whereas LGBTQ people in the United 
States, in particular transgender individuals, 
face a disproportionately high risk of becom-
ing victims of violent hate crimes; 
Whereas members of the LGBTQ commu-
nity have been targeted in acts of mass vio-
lence, including— 
(1) the Pulse nightclub shooting in Or-
lando, Florida, on June 12, 2016, where 49 peo-
ple were killed; and 
(2) the arson attack at the UpStairs 
Lounge in New Orleans, Louisiana, on June 
24, 1973, where 32 people died; 
Whereas LGBTQ people in the United 
States face persecution, violence, and death 
in many parts of the world, including State- 
sponsored violence; 
Whereas in the several years preceding 
2019, hundreds of LGBTQ people around the 
world were arrested and, in some cases, tor-
tured or even executed, because of their ac-
tual or perceived sexual orientation or gen-
der identity in countries and territories such 
as Chechnya, Egypt, Indonesia, and Tan-
zania; 
Whereas, in May 2019, Taiwan became the 
first place in Asia to extend marriage rights 
to same-sex couples; 
Whereas, since June 2019, Ecuador, North-
ern Ireland, and Costa Rica have extended 
marriage rights to same-sex couples, the 
most recent country-wide extensions of 
those rights in the world; 
Whereas policies such as the Migrant Pro-
tection Protocol and safe third country 
agreements with the countries of the North-
ern Triangle of Central America force 
LGBTQ asylum seekers to remain in dan-
gerous conditions without adequate protec-
tions; 
Whereas the LGBTQ community holds 
Pride festivals and marches in some of the 
most dangerous places in the world, despite 
threats of violence and arrest; 
Whereas, in 2009, President Barack Obama 
signed the Matthew Shepard and James 
Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (divi-
sion E of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) 
into law to protect all people in the United 
States from crimes motivated by the actual 
or perceived sexual orientation or gender 
identity of an individual; 
Whereas LGBTQ people in the United 
States have fought for equal treatment, dig-
nity, and respect; 
Whereas LGBTQ people in the United 
States have achieved significant milestones, 
ensuring that future generations of LGBTQ 
people in the United States will enjoy a more 
equal and just society; 
Whereas, 
despite 
being 
marginalized 
throughout the history of the United States, 
LGBTQ people in the United States continue 
to celebrate their identities, love, and con-
tributions to the United States in various 
expressions of Pride; 
Whereas Pride is a celebration of visibility 
in spite of marginalization, and the LGBTQ 
community will continue to observe this sig-
nificant cultural practice even though phys-
ical Pride celebrations may be compromised 
in June 2020 due to the health and safety 
needs of all individuals involved; 
Whereas, in June 2020, the Supreme Court 
of the United States affirmed that existing 
civil rights laws prohibit employment dis-
crimination on the basis of sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity, a landmark victory 
for the LGBTQ community; and 
Whereas LGBTQ people in the United 
States remain determined to pursue full 
equality, respect, and inclusion for all indi-
viduals regardless of sexual orientation or 
gender identity: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the rights, freedoms, and equal 
treatment 
of 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (referred to in this 
resolution as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) people in the United 
States and around the world; 
(2) acknowledges that LGBTQ rights are 
human rights that are to be protected by the 
laws of the United States and numerous 
international treaties and conventions; 
(3) supports efforts to ensure the equal 
treatment of all people in the United States, 
regardless of sexual orientation and gender 
identity; 
(4) supports efforts to ensure that the 
United States remains a beacon of hope for 
the equal treatment of people around the 
world, including LGBTQ individuals; and 
(5) encourages the celebration of June as 
‘‘LGBTQ Pride Month’’ in order to provide a 
lasting opportunity for all people in the 
United States— 
(A) to learn about the discrimination and 
inequality that the LGBTQ community en-
dured, and continues to endure; and 
(B) to celebrate the contributions of the 
LGBTQ community throughout the history 
of the United States.

NOTICE OF INTENT TO OBJECT TO 
PROCEEDING 
I, Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY, intend 
to object to proceeding to S. Res. 625, a 
resolution entitled Encouraging the 
Government and the people of the 
United States to ‘‘Buy American’’ and 
for other purposes, dated June 17, 2020 
for the reasons as stated in the 
RECORD. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
have notified the Senate majority lead-
er of my intent to object to proceeding 
to S. Res. 625, a resolution encouraging 
the Government and the people of the 
United States to ‘‘Buy American.’’ The 
resolution, 
though 
well-intentioned, 
would have implications on trade and 
manufacturing policy that require fur-
ther study. It could further invite our 
trading partners to take similar ac-
tions that would negatively impact 
U.S. farmers, businesses, consumers, 
and workers.

f 
NOMINATION OF JUSTIN REED 
WALKER 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am here to talk about the nomination 
of Justin Walker to the D.C. Circuit 
Court of Appeals, but let’s start with 
Conner Curran. Justin Walker actually 
has met Conner—not really, but I in-
troduced him to Conner through this 
picture during his nomination hearing 
in the Judiciary Committee. 
Several years ago, Conner was diag-
nosed with Duchenne muscular dys-
trophy, a degenerative life-threatening 
disease which presently has no cure. 
Most people who have the disease die 
by their mid-20s. Conner was diagnosed 
at age 5. I met Conner a couple of years 
later. There is probably nobody who 
has inspired me more with his courage, 
his energy, his strength of character 
than Conner Curran and his wonderful 
family who live in Ridgefield, CT. 
His parents were told, at the time of 
his diagnosis, that this beautiful young 
sweet child would slowly lose his abil-
ity to run, lift his arms, hug them, and 
he would need complex care for the rest 
of his life. He would need multiple spe-
cialists that would cost tens of thou-
sands of dollars each year, which they 
could not afford. But they made it pos-
sible or, actually, it was made possible 
by the Affordable Care Act. Now, be-
cause of that act, he cannot be denied 
care. He is alive. He is not giving up. 
He is fighting for both a cure and the 
Affordable Care Act. 
He is not the only one. There are 1.5 
million people in the State of Con-
necticut 
alone 
and 
millions 
more 
around the country living with pre-
existing conditions. There are 182,000 
children among those 1.5 million peo-
ple, just like Conner, living with the 
potentially debilitating and even dead-
ly effects of preexisting conditions, and 
there are millions more around the 
country. For them, for Americans, the 
Affordable Care Act is more than a law; 
it is a lifeline. Each of them can get 
the affordable care they need because 
of that lifeline. 
Right 
now, 
we 
all 
know 
that 
healthcare has never been more impor-
tant. We talk about it every day. We 
are full of rhetoric on the floor of this 
Chamber about the healthcare crisis, 
which has precipitated an economic 
crisis and about the disproportionate 
effects of that healthcare crisis—a pan-
demic of an insidious, deadly disease on 
poor and, often, communities of color. 
At the time of this crisis, the Presi-
dent of the United States has nomi-
nated Justin Walker to be an appellate 
judge, a present district court judge 
who has said that his main mission is 
to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Of 
course, that is perfectly consistent 
with the Trump administration’s view 
of the Affordable Care Act. It is liti-
gating in court right now against the 
Affordable Care Act. President Trump 
has 
opposed 
it 
consistently, 
con-
stantly, vociferously. 
Justin Walker, at his investiture as a 
district court judge, pledged that he 
would continue to make destruction of 
the Affordable Care Act a priority. 
During his investiture remarks, at-
tended by his mentor, the majority 
leader, Senator MCCONNELL, he said: 
[A]lthough my legal principles are preva-
lent, they have not yet prevailed. . . . 
[A]lthough we are winning, we have not won. 
. . . [A]lthough we celebrate today, we can-
not take for granted tomorrow or we will 
lose our courts and our country. 
That wasn’t some law review article 
that Justin Walker wrote back when he 
was going to school. It wasn’t some 
speech that he made to a local chamber 
of commerce. It was literally at his 
swearing in as a U.S. district court 
judge for the Western District of Ken-
tucky just months ago, not even a 
year. He said: ‘‘[A]lthough my legal 
principles are prevalent, they have not 
yet prevailed.’’ If there were a new 
meaning to give to the word ‘‘irony,’’ 
this nomination would exemplify it. 
During a public health crisis, the 
President of the United States has 
nominated someone who wants to take 
healthcare away from people and deny 
them health insurance. 
The reason Conner is here is really to 
show that these big principles have 
real-life consequences. Judges have im-
pact. The law matters. Words matter.

June 17, 2020 
[A]lthough my legal principles are preva-
lent, they have not yet prevailed. . . . 
[A]lthough we are winning, we have not yet 
won. 
What does a Justin Walker win look 
like? For those millions of Americans 
suffering from preexisting conditions, 
it means denial of healthcare. And for 
Conner Curran and his family, it could, 
in effect, be a death sentence. 
That may sound like an exaggera-
tion, but it isn’t to those millions of 
Americans who have preexisting condi-
tions. It isn’t to Conner and to his fam-
ily. They live with the real-life con-
sequences of laws that we make and de-
cisions by the courts that may strike 
down those laws, like the Affordable 
Care Act. 
The irony here is more than abstract. 
The outrage here should be real. Justin 
Walker, very simply, is unfit to be a 
judge on the Court of Appeals. He was 
judged ‘‘unqualified’’ to be a district 
court judge. 
I ask my colleagues to reject his 
nomination. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.
