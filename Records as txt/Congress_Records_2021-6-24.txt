DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
June 24, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable RUBEN 
GALLEGO to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m.

THE NEED FOR 2002 AUMF REPEAL 
AND THE PEACE ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, it is past 
time for Congress to reassert its role in 
the war powers discussion. 
I proudly joined many of my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle last 
week in voting to repeal the 2002 
AUMF. This AUMF provided for mili-
tary operations in Iraq, an Iraq that is 
far different from the one we know 
today. 
The goal was to defend the United 
States against the threat posed by an 
Iraq of 20 years ago, specifically, that 
of Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein 
was captured in December of 2003 and 
executed 3 years later. 
Despite ousting Saddam Hussein, the 
2002 AUMF has remained on the books. 
Less than one-fifth of the current 
Members of the House of Representa-
tives were present on that original 
AUMF vote. As you can imagine, many 
Members have entered Congress and 
left the Halls of Congress without ever 
taking a vote on the 2001 or 2002 
AUMFs. 
Repealing the existing AUMFs, like 
the one from 2002, can be a step in the 
right direction in Congress reasserting 
its Article I powers, but we should not 
stop there. We need to rethink how we 
approach military authorizations. 
A few weeks ago, I introduced the 
Preventing Endless Armed Conflict and 
Engagement Act, or the PEACE Act for 
short. The goal of this bill is to ensure 
regular oversight is being conducted on 
future military authorizations. 
First, this bill would require each 
military authorization, or AUMF, to 
terminate after 2 years. This is because 
the Constitution stipulates that mili-
tary funding should not extend past 2 
years. This would also ensure that 
every Member of Congress has the op-
portunity to weigh in on current mili-
tary operations. 
The PEACE Act would also set stand-
ards for drafting military authoriza-
tions. For instance, each authorization 
would need to set a geographic scope 
on where the military force can be 
used. A clear objective would need to 
be established for each authorization, 
and the countries and groups that the 
U.S. troops are authorized to fight 
must be listed. 
Additionally, the Department of De-
fense and the State Department would 
be charged with publishing an annual, 
unclassified report on existing military 
operations. This report will include in-
formation such as whether the military 
is meeting their objective, the number 
of casualties, and total cost. This will 
assist Congress in making the needed 
decisions that we have to make regard-
ing AUMF reauthorizations. Finally, 
the DOD and State Department will be 
required to brief Members of Congress 
on the contents of this report once 
every 6 months. 
It is critical that new Members of 
Congress, 
with 
new 
constituencies, 
have their chance at providing input 
into military operations. Many Mem-
bers came to the floor last week to re-
iterate the importance of updating 
these existing AUMFs instead of re-
pealing them. While I supported the re-
peal, I do hope that any updated or fu-
ture AUMF incorporates elements from 
the PEACE Act. 
Future AUMFs should be more con-
cise and relied on for only a few years, 
not for a couple decades. 
I look forward to working with Mem-
bers from both sides of the aisle on fu-
ture reforms to Congress’ war powers 
authority.

NO CLIMATE, NO DEAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BARRAGA´ N) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, we are 
living in a climate emergency. The car-
bon dioxide levels in the atmosphere 
have reached the highest levels in 
human history. 
In California, we have our worst 
drought in decades. Last week, we were 
hit by a heat wave that stretched from 
the West Coast to the Great Plains. 
This 
combination 
of 
unforgiving 
drought and relentless heat sets the 
conditions for another severe wildfire 
season. New Federal data shows the 
number of new wildfires this year is at 
a 10-year high.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3086 
June 24, 2021 
In recent years, our country has also 
faced record floods, deep freezes, and 
hurricanes. And deadly wildfires have 
hit States beyond California. 
Climate disruption is here. Congress 
has a responsibility to act boldly in re-
sponse. The American Jobs Plan is a 
once-in-a-generation 
opportunity 
to 
meet 
the 
moment 
with 
a 
trans-
formative investment in infrastruc-
ture. 
We have the opportunity to build a 
clean-energy future that uplifts the 
communities who now suffer from the 
impacts of the fossil fuel industry. We 
must do it. 
We must also recognize that commu-
nities of color have been hit first and 
worst by climate change. They must be 
at the front of the line for these invest-
ments. They must be represented in 
discussions 
on 
any 
infrastructure 
agreement. 
We can afford to protect our planet, 
clean our air and water, and provide a 
better quality of life for communities 
all over the country. 
We cannot afford an infrastructure 
bill that doesn’t have climate at its 
center. We cannot afford a bill that 
doesn’t invest in infrastructure that 
will create millions of jobs and serve 
the needs of our communities. 
We need: clean energy, a resilient 
electric grid, electric vehicle charging, 
green affordable housing, zero-emis-
sions public transit, climate smart 
ports, and more. 
Our constituents did not send us here 
to back down when faced with climate 
deniers and deniers of taking any 
meaningful climate action. 
If we don’t do it now, when will it 
ever happen? This is our opportunity. 
Now is the time to stand up for the 
health and the well-being of our com-
munities and our planet to say: No cli-
mate, no deal.

RECOGNIZING DISTRICT DIRECTOR 
BRIAN MCDONALD AND THE MIN-
NESOTA OFFICE OF THE SMALL 
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Brian McDonald and 
his entire team at the Small Business 
Administration’s Minnesota District 
Office. 
In May 2020, at the height of the 
COVID pandemic, Brian took on an 
enormous challenge when he rose to 
the role of district director for the 
SBA’s Minnesota region. 
Brian and his team were charged 
with supporting Minnesota’s 500,000 
small businesses and their 1.3 million 
employees through one of the most 
challenging economic crises in our Na-
tion’s history. Under Brian’s leader-
ship, the SBA’s Minnesota district of-
fice team facilitated critical loans, pro-
vided valuable training, and served as 
true warrior advocates for businesses 
of all sizes during this difficult time. 
At the outset of the COVID–19 out-
break, Brian and I hosted a joint town 
hall where he helped my constituents 
understand how they could keep their 
small businesses afloat. Brian’s partici-
pation was crucial, and his willingness 
to offer guidance and expertise is char-
acteristic of his office’s impressive 
work throughout the crisis. 
Brian and his team in the SBA’s Min-
nesota district office continue to work 
around the clock to help businesses in 
our State survive. We are grateful for 
all of their work, and we are fortunate 
to have such a dedicated SBA district 
presence in our State. I thank them for 
all they do. 
CONGRATULATING MINNESOTA ASSISTANT PRIN-
CIPAL
OF
THE
YEAR
ANGIE
CHARBONEAU- 
FOLCH 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
in 
recognition 
of 
Angie 
Charboneau-Folch, assistant principal 
at Big Lake High School. 
In April, Angie was named this year’s 
Minnesota Assistant Principal of the 
Year by the Central Minnesota Asso-
ciation of Secondary School Principals. 
She received this honor after 15 years 
of service as a school administrator, in-
cluding a decade at Big Lake. 
Angie has been a longtime advocate 
for both students and educators during 
her tenure. As leader of Big Lake High 
School’s Student Targeted Instruction 
and Goals program, better known as 
STING, she has ensured that students 
receive the additional instruction time 
and support they need. She has also 
worked to open the channels of com-
munication between teachers and fami-
lies through her Being Your Own 
Champion initiative. 
I congratulate Angie on this remark-
able achievement. I thank her for her 
years of dedication to the Big Lake 
community, and I know Minnesota stu-
dents are better off because of her sup-
port. 
HONORING THE WORK AND BRAVERY OF HALO 
TRUST AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the bravery and 
sacrifice of the HALO Trust employees 
who were recently attacked in Afghani-
stan. Earlier this month, 110 demining 
workers in the northeastern Afghani-
stan province of Baghlan were at-
tacked. Ten HALO Trust workers lost 
their lives and 16 more were injured. 
HALO Trust staff is comprised of 
locals who work alongside American 
citizens around the world to clear the 
debris of war, especially landmines. 
Their work is vital in Afghanistan, 
where nearly 40 years of conflict has 
left the land littered with explosives 
and citizens living under constant 
threat of detonation. This forces locals 
to make an unimaginable choice: ei-
ther let their families starve or risk 
their lives to farm dangerous land. 
Thanks to the work of HALO Trust 
and the entire demining community, 
war-torn nations across the globe are 
being revitalized. Within the Herat 
province alone, HALO Trust workers 
have cleared over 600 minefields and 
provided steady employment to 2,600 
Afghan locals. 
This devastating attack was an act of 
cowardice from an organization that 
feeds off instability and fear. I com-
mend the profound bravery of the 
workers who face down death to re-
build their communities. I hope every-
one will join me in recognition of their 
sacrifice. 
THANKING TAMMY BIERY AND CAREER 
SOLUTIONS 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Tammy Biery, the exec-
utive director of the employment agen-
cy Career Solutions. 
Electrolux had a long legacy in our 
home State, employing Minnesotans 
since 1946. In 1998, the plant produced 
75 percent of all freezers sold in the 
United States. 
In 2018, the business was St. Cloud’s 
eighth largest employer, with nearly 
900 employees. However, a year later, 
Electrolux consolidated their freezer 
production to South Carolina. Despite 
our efforts and the efforts of the com-
munity urging Electrolux to recon-
sider, approximately 760 employees 
faced layoffs. 
To support these workers who faced 
separation from employment, Tammy 
and her employment agency, Career 
Solutions, went to work. After receiv-
ing an award from the State Dislocated 
Worker program, Career Solutions of-
fered 
career 
counseling, 
on-the-job 
training, and interview coaching to 513 
former Electrolux employees. By the 
end of 2020, 159 of those trainees were 
gainfully employed. 
Thanks to the work of Tammy and 
the Career Solutions team, St. Cloud 
was able to weather the largest layoff 
in our history. I thank Tammy for 
that. 
TERESA BOHNEN: A CAREER OF SERVICE 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the career of Teresa 
Bohnen. Teresa is retiring this year as 
president of the St. Cloud Area Cham-
ber of Commerce. 
Teresa led the chamber for the past 
23 years. During that time, she has 
been a staunch advocate for small busi-
ness. 
Under Teresa’s leadership, the St. 
Cloud Area Chamber earned a five-star 
accreditation from the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce the first year it became eli-
gible and has maintained that rating 
ever since. 
I thank Teresa for her service to St. 
Cloud, and she should enjoy her well- 
earned retirement.

Biden was able to sign into law 
Juneteenth as a national holiday. 
Reverend Myers was founder of nu-
merous medical and cultural organiza-
tions and a committed physician, serv-
ing the poorest Americans through 
clinics in Tchula, Belzoni, Yazoo City, 
Indianola, Greenville, and Tupelo, Mis-
sissippi. 
Doc was also a jazz musician, com-
poser, and human rights activist. The 
New York Times stated: ‘‘There aren’t 
many doctors like Ronald Myers, a 
jazz-playing, Baptist-preaching, family 
practitioner whose dream has always 
been to practice medicine in the kind 
of place most other doctors wouldn’t 
even stop for a tank of gas.’’ 
In 1994, a group of community leaders 
from across the country gathered at 
Christian Unity Baptist Church in New 
Orleans, Louisiana, to work for greater 
national recognition of Juneteenth, a 
holiday celebrating the end of slavery. 
Dr. Myers was elected chairman of this 
advocacy effort, which led to the estab-
lishment of the National Juneteenth 
Observance Foundation and his rec-
ognition as the leader of the modern 
Juneteenth movement in America. Doc 
was instrumental in the passage of 45 
of the 49 State and District of Colum-
bia 
pieces 
of 
legislation 
naming 
Juneteenth as a day of observance in 
this country. 
Working 
with 
the 
Congressional 
Black Caucus, which included Illinois 
Senator Barack Obama and Represent-
ative DANNY DAVIS, he sought legisla-
tion to recognize Juneteenth independ-
ence, hosting the annual Juneteenth 
prayer breakfasts. 
b 1015 
He 
established 
the 
Washington 
Juneteenth National Holiday Observ-
ance and the National Day of Rec-
onciliation and Healing from the Leg-
acy of Enslavement, which includes the 
National Juneteenth Black Holocaust 
‘‘Maafa’’ Memorial Service. 
Dr. Myers organized the National As-
sociation 
of 
Juneteenth 
Jazz 
Pre-
senters and the Fellowship of Creative 
Christian Jazz Musicians. Under his 
leadership, the Washington Juneteenth 
congressional event was held by the 
National Juneteenth Observance Foun-
dation, Juneteenth America, Inc., and 
the National Association of Juneteenth 
Jazz Presenters. 
An accomplished jazz pianist, trum-
peter, and composer, Dr. Myers per-
formed across the country promoting 
‘‘June is Black Music Month!’’—Cele-
brating Juneteenth Jazz—‘‘Preserving 
Our African American Jazz Legacy!’’ 
For over 20 years, he met with State 
politicians, local Juneteenth organiza-
tions, and community leaders. 
Charles 
Taylor, 
author 
of 
Juneteenth, said: ‘‘Doc would give a 
copy of my Juneteenth book to every 
Governor who made Juneteenth a holi-
day or observance. He even gave Sarah 
Palin a copy when she was the Gov-
ernor of Alaska after her State recog-
nized Juneteenth.’’ 
At an award ceremony at the Beverly 
Hills Temple of the Arts at the Saban 
Theatre, founder Rabbi David Baron 
said: ‘‘Reverend Dr. Ronald V. Myers is 
an outstanding living model of all the 
values for which Martin Luther King 
stood.’’ 
Thanks to Steve Williams, who has 
carried on Dr. Myers’ work; and my 
staffer, Dr. Caleb Gilchrist, who has 
worked closely with him. 
Thank you, Dr. Myers, and may you 
rest in peace. 
f 
KANSAS IS THE BREADBASKET OF 
THE WORLD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Kansas farmers for their 
long hours during this year’s wheat 
harvest and for their work to produce 
food for people all over the world. 
With more than 15,000 wheat farms 
across the State and 5 million acres of 
wheat in the Big First District alone, 
Kansas leads the Nation in wheat pro-
duction, is the largest exporter of hard 
red winter wheat, and is aptly named 
the breadbasket of the world. 
The 
United 
States 
exports 
that 
wheat to more than 100 countries 
around the world, and some of that 
wheat from Kansas ends up abroad 
under the U.S. food assistance pro-
grams, like Food for Peace. In fact, it 
was the Kansas Farm Bureau who 
began sending surplus grain to those in 
need around the world, continuing U.S. 
leadership in addressing world hunger. 
As I reflect on my own time on our 
family farm in Quinter, Kansas, I am 
reminded that harvest season is about 
more than just harvesting the crop. 
For Kansas farm families and commu-
nities, harvest is about coming to-
gether. 
Harvest is when we share tractors 
and other equipment with our neighbor 
when theirs gets stuck. Harvest is 
when a grandmother takes food to the 
field so the rest of her family doesn’t 
have to leave the field for a lunch 
break. It is when a father takes his 
child out on the combine to show him 
how the work is done. And it is when 
we reflect on our advancements in agri-
culture, thanks to land-grant univer-
sities, like the wheat breeding research 
at Kansas State University, yielding 
high-quality 
and 
plentiful 
harvests 
around the world. 
Wheat harvest is a time for Kansas to 
be proud of the great strides they take 
to feed, fuel, and clothe the world. At 
the end of the season, we look back and 
know that each agricultural success is 
inexplicably tied to our Kansas values 
of faith, family, community, and grit. 
While we are at work here in Wash-
ington, they are back at home making 
the world go round, and for that we 
owe farmers our sincerest thank you. 
THE RIGHT TO LIFE IS SELF-EVIDENT 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I also rise 
today in support of one of the most 
basic functions of any government, the 
right to life. 
Our Founding Fathers wrote 245 
years ago, ‘‘We hold these truths to be 
self-evident that all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their 
Creator 
with 
certain 
unalienable 
rights, that among these are life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness.’’ 
To them, the right to life was so 
overly obvious that they called it self- 
evident. 
But, today, in America, some policy-
makers insist on denying the right to 
life to millions of Americans. Instead, 
they diminish that right through mur-
derous abortion policies, policies that 
fail to recognize life until a child lets 
out his or her first cry in the delivery 
room, policies that justify abortion 
based on the belief that any unborn 
child may have Down syndrome, and 
policies that funnel taxpayer dollars to 
funding abortions and abortion serv-
ices. 
Today’s technology and science has 
shown us proof of life inside the womb. 
We see 3D ultrasounds of a baby suck-
ing her thumb and moving around. We 
know unborn babies can experience 
pain as early as 12 weeks. At 20 weeks, 
we can reveal if a baby is a boy or a 
girl. 
Yet some of our country’s leaders 
still proceed to support policies that 
devalue and eliminate the innocent 
child’s life. For decades, these elected 
officials have spent more time pro-
tecting the right of potentially endan-
gered species, like the lesser prairie- 
chicken or sea turtle eggs, than they 
do protecting unborn babies, human 
babies. 
But not to me. I strongly believe life 
begins at conception. I believe every 
life matters. I support adoptions, foster 
care, and crisis pregnancy centers that 
work tirelessly to care for mothers and 
their babies. I have cosponsored pro- 
life legislation, including H.R. 18, the 
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, 
permanently prohibiting Federal fund-
ing for abortions and abortion services. 
I even introduced my own, H.R. 714, 
which would require the executive 
branch to notify Congress and the 
American public before issuing any 
new executive order pertaining to pro- 
life provisions and the right to life 
guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of 
the U.S. Constitution. 
Devaluing the life of unborn children 
has desensitized our Nation, and I pray 
we soon wake up and realize the hor-
rors it has done. It is time to stop 
using taxpayer dollars to fund abortion 
services and focus on lifesaving re-
sources that value the life of both the 
mother and the child. The right to life 
is self-evident, and I will fight to pro-
tect it at all costs.

REMEMBERING ROBERT 
KALEIMOMI KEKAULA

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3088 
June 24, 2021 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
profound sadness that I stand before 
you to share the passing of a legendary 
news and sports broadcaster, an accom-
plished musician, a father, friend, and 
son 
of 
Hawaii, 
Robert 
Kaleimomi 
Kekaula, 
who 
unexpectedly 
passed 
away last Saturday in Hawaii at 56 
years of age. 
In order to tell you about Robert, I 
must do so with great respect to his 
chosen career path and success as the 
consummate communicator. 
Where, when, and how quickly he ac-
quired his excellent skills, whether at 
his high school alma mater, the Kame-
hameha Schools, the University of Ha-
waii, where he earned a bachelor’s de-
gree in communications, or throughout 
his experience as a Native Hawaiian 
growing up on Hawaii Island, I can’t 
say. 
Yet what I can say with certainty is 
that Robert held the powerful ability 
of talking to people; not about people, 
but to people. And he did it exceedingly 
well, with thousands, including myself, 
for 35 years in the broadcast industry. 
It is quite possible that his talents 
were not learned skills at all, but, 
rather, God-given gifts that he so will-
ingly shared with all of us. I would be 
hard-pressed to find a living room or 
dining table in Hawaii that did not at 
some point during that time welcome 
in 
Robert 
Kekaula 
and 
his 
daily 
evening news and sports reports. 
The reason, Robert connected with 
people. For him, people came first, be-
fore the stories, before the news. He 
understood that the primary role of the 
news, of the media was to improve peo-
ple’s lives. It was not to be sensational. 
It was not to stoke conflict. It was to 
inform. 
That sincerity, that genuine care, 
from a man with that unmistakable 
baritone voice and dominant presence, 
made people comfortable to watch him; 
moreover, comfortable to share the de-
tails of their lives with him, and the 
audience who leaned in to listen and 
learn. 
Described as a perfectionist, he held 
himself and others to three require-
ments in the newsroom. What went out 
of his newsroom and into the living 
rooms had to be correct, pertinent, and 
helpful to Hawaii. 
He had a photographic memory for 
detail. He was a wordsmith. He had the 
ear of key figures in Hawaii sports. He 
was proud of the local kids who made 
it. He was all about Hawaii. 
His reach into our homes did not stop 
with him, however, because Robert 
made it a point to share his knowledge. 
As a mentor, he could see in young 
journalists what others could not see. 
He opened his door to those who oth-
erwise had doors closed in their faces. 
And just as folks welcomed him into 
their homes, Robert would welcome as-
piring broadcasters into his home of 
sports and news. 
Many young men and women he 
mentored went on to become sports an-
chors, as well as news reporters, and 
every single one of them was better for 
having Robert in their lives. 
His bright Aloha shirts became his 
mainstay. He became synonymous with 
them. He was rarely seen without one. 
And on the national circuit, the Daily 
Show with Trevor Noah shared a shot 
of Robert in his Aloha shirt, and Noah 
commented: ‘‘Even their newscasts are 
so chill.’’ 
The brightness of Robert’s shirts 
only mirrored the brightness of his 
smile and the endless radiance of his 
Aloha spirit. 
Within this skilled communicator 
and mentor lived a Native Hawaiian 
who inspired others, including myself. 
To see Robert on the news and the 
small screen gave way to other Native 
Hawaiians to believe they could have a 
career on TV, too. 
In public, he was just as approach-
able, and friends tell me he often cov-
ered the tab for those he didn’t know. 
His legacy lives on through the peo-
ple fortunate enough to learn from him 
and work with him and in the music he 
composed, produced, and performed 
alongside his daughter, Tiera, and 
through his family and friends whom 
he loved dearly. 
‘‘’A’ohe mea nana e ho’opuhili, he 
moho no ka la makani,’’ ‘‘there is no 
one to interfere, for he is a messenger 
of a windy day,’’ said in admiration of 
a person who lets nothing stop him 
from carrying out the task entrusted 
to him. 
To me and to so many others, that is 
the essence of Robert, who carried out 
the task as the consummate communi-
cator with extreme love for Hawaii and 
its people. 
Mahalo, Robert Kaleimomi Kekaula, 
for your immeasurable contributions 
to Hawaii. We are forever grateful, and 
you will be forever missed.

DR. DREW VAN HORN IS A 
TREMENDOUS ASSET 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the presi-
dent of Young Harris College, Dr. Drew 
Van Horn. 
In 2017, Dr. Van Horn was selected as 
the 23rd president of Young Harris Col-
lege and has been a tremendous addi-
tion to the school with his wealth of 
knowledge and expertise. 
Dr. Van Horn has brought more than 
30 years of experience in higher edu-
cation to Young Harris College, includ-
ing nine years as president of Brevard 
College in North Carolina. 
As a graduate of Young Harris Col-
lege, and a friend of Dr. Van Horn, I ap-
preciate his dedication and his work on 
behalf of Young Harris College. I know 
the entire Mountain Lion community 
joins me in thanking Dr. Van Horn for 
his service to our beloved college. 
Dr. Van Horn, we love you and appre-
ciate you. 
CONGRATULATING FORT STEWART 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Fort Stew-
art as the winner of the Army Environ-
mental Award for Natural Resources 
Conservation for a large installation. 
Located 
southwest 
of 
Savannah, 
Georgia, Fort Stewart is the largest 
Army post east of the Mississippi 
River. Fort Stewart is home to the 3rd 
Infantry Division and seven species 
protected by the Endangered Species 
Act on 284,000 acres of pine forest, wet-
lands, and blackwater rivers. 
The Fort’s land is managed by a 
team tasked with balancing military 
readiness and environmental steward-
ship. This dedicated team ensures that 
conditions are set for soldiers to train 
and prepare for deployment, while also 
managing environmental assets that 
include wildlife management and cul-
tural resource management. 
The Army Environmental Award for 
Natural Resources Conservation re-
flects the hard work of Fort Stewart’s 
leadership, staff, and personnel in de-
fending not only the people of the 
United States, but its environment as 
well. 
I am proud to rise today to recognize 
this tremendous achievement and com-
mend the hard work of Fort Stewart 
soldiers. 
FREDDIE’S GARAGE AND TOWING CELEBRATES 75 
YEARS IN BUSINESS 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the 75th 
anniversary of Freddie’s Garage and 
Towing in Tybee Island, Georgia. 
In August of 1946, Freddie’s opened on 
Tybee 
Island, 
Georgia. 
Although 
Freddie’s transitioned from a gas sta-
tion to a garage over the years, 
Freddie’s continues to operate in their 
original location. 
Residents of the Tybee Island com-
munity have trusted Freddie’s through 
multiple generations. For 75 years, cus-
tomers are relieved to know that 
Freddie’s dependable service will al-
ways be there to keep their car run-
ning. 
Freddie’s Garage and Towing is a per-
fect example of a hardworking Amer-
ican business. As a small business 
owner for more than 30 years, I com-
mend the hard work and dedication 
that Freddie’s Garage and Towing has 
shown to their customers. 
The team at Freddie’s Garage and 
Towing works hard to maintain the 
trust of the Tybee Island community, 
and I congratulate them for 75 years of 
success.

estimates that more than 6,000 children 
are unaccounted for. 
My team has worked tirelessly to get 
relief to our constituents. I encourage 
our constituents to visit the IRS

check their eligibility. 
There is even a tool for nonfilers. 
The IRS is underfunded, and we need 
to fix that, but they have done a phe-
nomenal job getting this set up. 
While our caseworkers are always

AMERICA NEEDS TO DO THE RIGHT THING 
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, our Af-
ghan allies and friends risked their 
lives, not just for their country, but for 
ours. They put their lives on the line, 
not just for Afghanistan, but for Amer-
ica. And they are not just Afghan he-
roes, but American heroes, too. 
They risked their lives because we 
made a solemn promise to them: We 
have your backs. Because we said that 
we have their backs, they now have a 
target on theirs. 
Today, the Biden administration has 
heard the call of veterans across Amer-
ica who have said: Save our allies. Do 
the right thing by the promise that we 
made. 
They have heeded our calls to pursue 
an evacuation because there simply is 
not enough time for special immigrant 
visas to be processed. It is 80 days until 
our withdrawal. The average time to 
process an SIV is 800 days. 
Today is, therefore, a bright chapter 
in the long story of the advocacy of 
veterans all over this country, Demo-
crat and Republican, who have called 
on the administration to execute a 
plan for evacuation. 
But the story is far from over. We 
need to see a detailed operational plan, 
including a way to collect our allies 
from across this war-torn country, a 
way to ensure that their family mem-
bers are saved as well, and a clear plan 
to get them COVID vaccines so they 
can travel safely to other countries, or 
to Guam, and not carry a risk of car-
rying the disease. 
We also need to see an operational 
commander named to lead this effort, 
and we need a guarantee that this 
evacuation mission will continue until 
it is complete. 
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, General Milley, said yesterday 
that we have a moral obligation to ful-
fill this promise. I would add that that 
moral obligation is not just to our Af-
ghan friends and allies. It is to every 
future young American on the ground 
in some conflict overseas who needs a 
friend, who needs an interpreter, who 
needs an ally and makes that promise 
once again: Come work with us. Come 
risk your life for us because we have 
your back. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CHRIS 
OBERHEIM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. MILLER) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life and 
work of Champaign Police Officer Chris 
Oberheim. 
Our communities in Illinois and 
across the Nation continue to mourn 
the loss of this fallen hero. 
Officer Oberheim was called home to 
be with the Lord on May 19, 2021. Offi-
cer Oberheim was on duty when he was 
shot and killed while attempting to 
protect a mother and her children. 
Officer Oberheim put his life on the 
line and made the ultimate sacrifice. 
As Champaign Police Chief Anthony 
Cobb stated, the debt of gratitude we 
owe Officer Oberheim and his family 
goes beyond written and spoken word. 
Throughout 
his 
career, 
Officer 
Oberheim put the people of his commu-
nity first, and he was a true credit to 
the badge he wore, receiving two med-
als of valor for courageous acts of self-
less bravery, as well as countless let-
ters of accommodation. 
Officer Oberheim’s life and service 
will not and should not be forgotten. 
My prayers are with his wife, Amber, 
as well as his four daughters, Hannah, 
Avery, Addison, and Aubrey. 
I had the great honor of speaking 
with Amber Oberheim, a devoted wife 
and a strong woman of faith. She told 
me that her husband had a servant’s 
heart. His life revolved around his fam-
ily and protecting others. 
Chris was a son, brother, coach, 
friend, and leader, but his family was 
his first priority. 
To 
honor 
her 
husband, 
Amber 
Oberheim wants to create change. She 
started 
a 
foundation, 
Peacemaker 
Project 703, to support brothers and sis-
ters in blue. Amber’s goal is to pro-
mote the support of our law enforce-
ment officers and their families and to 
shine a light on their service and sac-
rifice. 
These are dangerous times. Please 
love and appreciate our officers. May 
God bless the Oberheim family. 
f 
ANTI-SEMITISM IS UNACCEPTABLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
HOULAHAN). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. BACON) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address the very concerning 
uptick in hate crimes against members 
of the Jewish community in recent 
weeks. To be clear, these incidents 
have not been isolated, and their sheer 
volume should frighten us all. 
We must do more to acknowledge 
these crimes against our Jewish broth-
ers and sisters and ensure the perpetra-
tors of these crimes are held account-
able. 
Perhaps the most telling sign of how 
dangerous things have gotten is the 
statistical data. Those who clearly 
identify as Jews, with their garb and 
outward trappings, have been viciously 
and frequently targeted. 
According to the ADL, there has been 
an 80 percent increase in anti-Semitic 
incidents in the United States. Some 
include Nazi propaganda in public 
parks and synagogues as well as sus-
pensions in schools related to anti-Se-
mitic attacks. 
In Lincoln, Nebraska, the South 
Street Temple was spray-painted with 
swastikas 
and 
racial 
epithets. 
In 
Omaha, about 75 headstones were top-
pled and more than $50,000 in damage 
caused at the Temple Israel Cemetery. 
I have repeatedly condemned this be-
havior and stand with Nebraska’s Jew-
ish community and all of those across 
the U.S. who have experienced similar 
situations. 
Recently, I had the pleasure of meet-
ing one of the most prominent leaders 
of the orthodox Jewish community, 
Rabbi Dovid Hofstedter, the son of Hol-
ocaust 
survivors 
who 
founded 
the 
Dirshu, the largest Torah organization 
in the world. 
Rabbi Hofstedter was compelled to 
come to Washington to address my col-
leagues and me about the very serious 
issues related to the safety and secu-
rity of the State of Israel, including 
the hatred toward Israel that has 
manifested itself in many cases toward 
the entire Jewish people. 
I committed to Rabbi Hofstedter that 
we, in Congress, will do everything in 
our power to continue standing up for 
the Jewish people and ensuring their 
safety, from New York to Nebraska and 
all across the United States. 
During his address to my colleagues 
and I, Rabbi Hofstedter remarked that 
perhaps at no time since the 1930s have 
we found ourselves in a more similar 
situation. 
Jewish 
lives 
are 
being 
threatened both domestically and on a 
global scale. However, after watching 
the hate crimes against our Jewish 
brothers and sisters over the last few 
weeks, it is abundantly clear that the 
rabbi’s words were sadly and tragically 
understated. 
It is time for all of us in Congress to 
wake up to the reality of the hatred 
that is being directed toward the Jew-
ish people and ensure that ‘‘never 
again’’ truly means ‘‘never again.’’ 
Cowardice 
emboldens 
the 
enemy. 
What Rabbi Hofstedter and Dirshu rep-
resent is the true antidote to this ven-
omous hatred that has been exhibited 
toward the community he leads. 
We must not buckle under fear but, 
rather, call out the haters and show 
that the Jewish people as a community 
will never stand down. They will con-
tinue to practice their Jewish heritage 
with their heads held high. 
Out of the darkness of the Holocaust, 
Rabbi Hofstedter decided to dedicate 
his life to reviving the levels of Jewish 
scholarship and education to the levels 
that were predating the Holocaust. As 
the son of Holocaust survivors, Rabbi 
Hofstedter’s 
personal 
life’s 
mission

that he has chosen to undertake and 
execute upon ought to serve as a source 
of inspiration for every Member of this 
legislative body. Just as Martin Luther 
King once said: ‘‘Darkness cannot drive 
out darkness; only light can do that. 
Hate cannot drive out hate; only love 
can do that.’’ 
I thank Rabbi Hofstedter for all that 
he and the members of the Dirshu con-
tinue to do to advance Jewish scholar-
ship and education in the face of the 
evil that has been perpetrated on their 
community in recent weeks. May God 
bless them all. May God bless the 
United States of America.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
SERVICE OF W.L. PATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. WEBER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, today, I rise to recognize the exem-
plary life of one Mr. W.L. Pate from 
Beaumont, Texas. 
Words cannot adequately express how 
deeply saddened Brenda and I were to 
hear of W.L. Pate’s passing just the 
other day. As I think back, Madam 
Speaker, we are hard-pressed to re-
member anyone who gave more to their 
community than W.L. did to his—or 
ours, for that matter. 
The list of W.L.’s considerable ac-
complishments and contributions are 
far too numerous to be listed here, but 
here are just a few. 
W.L. was a two-term mayor of Beau-
mont. He was an Army veteran and had 
14 years of service as a city council-
man. W.L. was the past president of the 
Texas Association of Mayors, Council 
Members and Commissioners. W.L. was 
on the board of the Texas Municipal 
League and served as TML president 
for Region 16. 
Never missing a chance to give back, 
W.L. assisted the District 14 office 
every single year with military service 
academy nominations, and he was good 
at it and proud to be able to do it. 
I am particularly proud of W.L.’s pas-
sion project in recent years. W.L. was 
the driving force behind obtaining the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom that 
was posthumously awarded to Babe 
Didrikson Zaharias, a fantastic female 
athlete, given by President Donald 
Trump. 
I recognize and thank W.L. Pate for 
his servant leadership. Our deepest 
sympathy goes out to his family and 
friends, especially his daughters, Jen-
nifer and Suzanne. 
This is a tremendous loss for Beau-
mont and the Nation. W.L.’s remark-
able legacy of service and sacrifice is 
the epitome of what it means to be a 
great American. Our country would be 
well-served to have many more with 
such a servant’s heart. 
Rest in peace, my friend. W.L. Pate, 
you done good. 
REMEMBERING THE INCREDIBLE 
LIFE OF LOUISE DUNLAP 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to re-
member the incredible life of Louise 
Dunlap. 
A native of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 
Louise was a dedicated advocate for 
coal communities, our environment, 
and especially the reclamation of our 
historic abandoned mine lands. 
Louise’s career began with the grass-
roots, advocating for more support for 
the environment and Pennsylvania’s 
mine lands. In 1972, Louise cofounded 
the Environmental Policy Institute 
and the Environmental Policy Center. 
There, she spent years working to pass 
legislation to support mine reclama-
tion in Pennsylvania and was an im-
portant advocate for the passage of the 
Surface Mining Control and Reclama-
tion Act of 1977. 
This law created the first Federal 
standards on the reclamation of new 
and subsequent surface mining. Impor-
tantly, it also established the Aban-
doned Mine Land Trust, which was cre-
ated to provide consistent funding for 
the reclamation of coal mines that 
were abandoned prior to the law’s en-
actment in 1977. 
For over 40 years, this trust has been 
the central funding source for the rec-
lamation of abandoned mine lands in 20 
States, generating over $11.6 billion 
since its creation by Congress. 
Beginning in 2004, she joined the 
Foundation for Pennsylvania Water-
sheds, where she continued her life’s 
work. In 2006, she again played a key 
advocacy role when Congress author-
ized the AML for an additional 15 
years. 
This September, the Abandoned Mine 
Land Fund is set to expire. The trust 
must be reauthorized in order to con-
tinue opportunities in funding to clean 
up these un-reclaimed lands, not only 
in Pennsylvania but around the coun-
try. Congress has the opportunity to do 
right by our coal communities by reau-
thorizing this fund and also expediting 
the release of the existing balance. 
Reauthorizing the AML was a project 
close to Louise’s heart. She fought for 
coal communities up until her final 
days. She spent the last few weeks con-
tinuing to secure support for the reau-
thorization of the Abandoned Mine 
Land Fund. 
b 1045 
In Pennsylvania, there are over 5,500 
miles of streams polluted due to legacy 
mining, and over 280,000 acres remain 
toxic. Nationwide, the unfunded liabil-
ities exceed $12 billion, with $5 billion 
in Pennsylvania alone. Louise made it 
her mission to work toward restoring 
these areas. 
My district alone has the most aban-
doned mine land in the country. I un-
derstand the urgency in reauthorizing 
the AML fund, which is why I am an 
original cosponsor of the RECLAIM 
Act and the Surface Mining Control 
and Reclamation Act Amendments of 
2021 with fellow Pennsylvanian, Rep-
resentative MATT CARTWRIGHT. We both 
worked closely with Louise on this act. 
Louise Dunlap was an inspiring force 
as she spent her life advocating to re-
claim and revitalize former mining 
communities. She was a friend and 
marshaled key legislation victories 
over the span of a 50-year career. 
In honor of her legacy, it is impor-
tant that we continue her life’s work 
and continue to support our historic 
coal communities. 
My heartfelt condolences to the fam-
ily and friends of Louise Dunlap. She 
was so fiercely passionate, and she will 
be greatly missed.

HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL 
WILBUR L. ‘‘W.L.’’ PATE, JR. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BABIN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my dear friend of more 
than 65 years, Lieutenant Colonel Wil-
bur L. ‘‘W.L.’’ Pate, Jr. 
W.L. and I grew up together in Beau-
mont, Texas, where he was better 
known by his nickname, ‘‘Bubba.’’ We 
became close friends playing football 
together at Austin Junior High School, 
and 
eventually, 
my 
family 
moved 
across town, which, unfortunately, sent 
us to different high schools. I still re-
member the football game in 1965 when 
French High School—led by W.L. Pate 
at 
quarterback—dealt 
me 
and 
my 
team, Forest Park High School Tro-
jans, a close loss. 
The final score of 8–7 stung, but I 
couldn’t help but be proud of the skill 
and sportsmanship demonstrated by 
W.L. and his French High Buffalos. 
A year later, W.L. and I both ended 
up at Lamar University in Beaumont 
and served in the same unit in the 
Army Reserves, as well. In 1969, he was 
commissioned as an infantry officer, 
and in 1978, he graduated from Com-
mand and General Staff College. 
After leaving the military as a lieu-
tenant colonel in 1994, he dove into an-
other form of public service—serving 
his community on Beaumont’s City 
Council as mayor pro tempore, and on 
several boards, including the Beaumont 
Rotary Club, Better Business Bureau, 
the American Legion, Lamar Institute 
of Technology, and many more. 
One of Bubba’s most significant ac-
complishments was his advocacy for 
the late Babe Didrikson Zaharias to be 
awarded the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom. Babe was from our hometown 
of Beaumont, Texas, and was a gold 
medal Olympian, and later, profes-
sional golfer, winning ten LPGA major 
tournaments. She is considered by 
many to be one of the world’s greatest 
female athletes. 
I was honored to attend the White 
House ceremony with W.L. when he

accepted 
this 
award 
from 
President Trump on behalf of the Babe

Texas. W.L. Pate was the very man 
who inspired me to run for Congress 
back when he nearly threw longtime

Brooks’ attention. 
W.L. was a dear friend and a re-

RPM ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. POSEY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to direct the House’s attention to H. 
Res. 3281, the RPM Act. 
The RPM Act is necessary because of 
a gross abuse of the Administrative 
Procedures Act by unelected, unac-
countable, unrecallable bureaucrats. 
Madam Speaker, most people aren’t 
aware that the chances are better than 
a thousand to one if you are ever 
hauled 
into 
Federal 
court 
under 
charges, it is more than likely you will 
be subject to a violation of rules, ad-
ministrative rules, that are enforceable 
as laws. 
Most Members of Congress seem of-
tentimes to forget that, and we have 
allowed 
the 
rule-makers, 
the 
unelected, unaccountable people, to 
make an incredible amount of laws 
that become a heavy burden on our so-
ciety. 
So we are hoping, with the RPM Act, 
H. Res. 3281, we can right some of those 
wrongs.

Sovereign God, speak to us this day. 
Speak to us in words that we can hear

Open our ears to Your word, even as 
You speak through the voices of those

counterparts. 
May we not just take the time to 
heed guidance that comes from the 
counsel of our colleagues, but to listen 
to concerns You would have us hear, 
even when it comes from the mouths of 
our adversaries. 
Then, having listened for Your truth 
and discerned Your voice amid the 
commotion and the calm, may we not 
just hear, but listen carefully to the 
perfect law of liberty You have estab-
lished. Inspire us to obey Your guid-
ance and put Your wisdom into prac-
tice. 
We ask Your blessing on the work 
You have called us to do this day. In 
the strength of Your name we pray.

THREE MILLION FREE MEALS 
(Mr. SIRES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the West New York 
School Nutrition Service Department 
and Nu-Way Concessionaires for serv-
ing the West New York, New Jersey, 
community throughout the pandemic. 
Nu-Way Concessionaires was founded 
in 1958 by a longtime West New York 
resident, Joseph Pantaleo, who sadly 
passed away in December at the age of 
90. Joe understood the importance of 
giving back to his community and fully 
embodied the spirit of service. 
It is in this light that I wish to recog-
nize the West New York School Nutri-
tion Service Department, managed by 
Nu-Way, which has provided over three 
million free meals to the West New 
York community since the beginning 
of the pandemic and will continue pro-
viding meals throughout this summer. 
Free breakfast and free lunch have 
been provided every day, including 
weekends, and have provided a lifeline 
during a turbulent and uncertain year. 
I would also like to commend Sal 
Valenza and Jose Sabater and their 21 
employees who have worked tirelessly 
every day for their community to en-
sure students have access to healthy 
and locally sourced meals.

CONGRATULATIONS 
TO 
EDWARD 
BURR AND THE MONIQUE BURR 
FOUNDATION FOR CHILDREN 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Edward Burr 
and the Monique Burr Foundation for 
Children located in northeast Florida. 
Established in 1997, the Monique Burr 
Foundation works to prevent abuse, 
bullying, cyberbullying, exploitation, 
and human trafficking of children. 
They have trained more than 5,000 
facilitators in schools all across 67 
Florida counties, 28 other States, and 3 
foreign countries. 
Madam Speaker, as the former sher-
iff of Duval County, I can personally 
attest to the difference the Monique 
Burr Foundation is making in the lives 
of children across Florida and across 
our country. 
Recently, Mr. Burr received the 
Hearthstone BUILDER Humanitarian 
Award in recognition of his decades of 
public service to support and protect 
children in need. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Florida, I congratu-
late Edward Burr for his well-deserved 
honor, and I thank the Monique Burr 
Foundation for Children for their ex-
cellent work in our community. 
f 
BIPARTISAN AMERICAN GOALS 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to lament the failure of the For 
the People Act, H.R. 1, in the United 
States Senate. It is a sad week that 
this has happened. 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act, ought 
to be a bipartisan American goal. It 
ought to be a bipartisan American goal 
that we get big secret money out of 
politics. It ought to be a bipartisan 
American goal that we protect people’s 
right to vote throughout this land. It 
ought to be a bipartisan American goal 
that we end gerrymandering and let 
the people choose the politicians in-
stead of the politicians choosing their 
voters. 
I am here to say that we are not done 
with the For the People Act and its 
goals. Let’s make it bipartisan and 
let’s make it an American goal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3092 
June 24, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, after a year of belit-
tling Wuhan virus reports, incredibly, 
The New York Times published a front- 
page admission last Tuesday acknowl-
edging that the Wuhan virus could be a 
lab leak. 
With the headline ‘‘Lab-Leak Theory 
Flourishes,’’ it cited: ‘‘ . . . whether 
the world will ever learn if the virus 
. . . escaped from a Chinese lab. . . . 
The idea that the virus may have es-
caped from a lab had long been . . . dis-
missed . . . and shunned . . . for its 
connection with former President Don-
ald J. Trump.’’ 
The article accurately reviews the re-
fusal of China to allow an independent 
investigation, ultimate control by the 
Chinese Communist Party, 2017 cre-
ation of hybrid bat coronaviruses at 
the Wuhan lab, the bizarre U.S. tax-
payer lab funding by the National In-
stitutes of Health through EcoHealth 
Alliance, Wuhan researchers in Novem-
ber 2019 being hospitalized, 2012 bat vi-
ruses withheld, and an attack in July 
by Dr. Shi Zhengli on President Trump 
and others demanding that they should 
‘‘shut their stinky mouths.’’ 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Our sympathy to the family of Milton 
Moore and his wife, Jean, who are be-
loved civic leaders of South Carolina. 
f 
ZIP CODE 61605 DESERVES BETTER 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to support the Social Determinants Ac-
celerator Act. 
The community that lives in the 
61605 ZIP Code in Peoria, Illinois, is vi-
brant and beautiful, but they face sig-
nificant challenges. It is one of the 
most distressed ZIP Codes in the entire 
Nation, a food desert. And soon its only 
pharmacy will shut their doors, leaving 
them with fewer options for basic 
healthcare. 
Each of these factors can have a big 
impact on the health of every person in 
the community. All 14 of the counties 
in the district that I serve face 
healthcare provider shortages. Half of 
those counties face provider shortages 
for 
mental, 
physical, 
and 
dental 
healthcare. 
That is why I introduced the Social 
Determinants Accelerator Act, to em-
power our local communities to ad-
dress the day-to-day factors that affect 
their lives. Today, the Energy and 
Commerce Committee heard my bill. I 
thank Chairman PALLONE for his lead-
ership on this issue. I urge my col-
leagues to support it because commu-
nities like 61605 in Peoria, Illinois, de-
serve better. 
f 
A UNIQUE RECIPE FOR DISASTER 
(Mr. NEHLS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, after 
months of record taxpayer spending, 
the Biden administration has underper-
formed job growth expectations in 
back-to-back months. Inflation is high-
er than any point in more than a dec-
ade, and people across our country are 
still being paid to sit home and not 
work. 
When you pay people not to work and 
pump untold amounts of money into 
liberal special interests, you get a 
unique recipe for disaster. 
The Biden economic model is failing, 
and now the administration is fighting 
crises on two fronts, border and eco-
nomic. The American people and small 
businesses across our country need real 
leadership that puts the American peo-
ple first. 
We will not spend our way out of this 
Biden-made economic crisis. We will 
get out of it if we reduce regulations, 
lower taxes, and increase economic 
freedom. This model did work under 
President Trump, and it will work 
again if only the Biden administration 
and Democrats would put the Amer-
ican people first and not special inter-
ests. 
f 
CONGRATULATING MIA NEAL 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is 
with great admiration that I rise today 
to congratulate Mia Neal of Gary, Indi-
ana, and celebrate her noteworthy 
achievement of winning an Oscar in the 
93rd Academy Awards for best makeup 
and hairstyling. 
Mia Neal attended Horace Mann High 
School in Gary, Indiana, and after 
graduating in 1997, Mia’s interest in 
hairstyling and makeup blossomed as 
she attended Merrillville Beauty Col-
lege and Columbia College in Chicago. 
I would note that Mia’s family has 
been actively involved in northwest In-
diana’s community, as her mother, 
Dena Holland Neal, was pastor of Peace 
United Church in Merrillville; and her 
grandfather, James Holland, taught at 
Roosevelt High School for more than 15 
years and served as Gary’s first deputy 
mayor from 1976 to 1988. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my 
distinguished colleagues to join me in 
recognizing Mia Neal on her historic 
Oscar award and again congratulate 
her for this outstanding accomplish-
ment. 
f 
HONORING THE SACRIFICE OF 
NEAL TODD 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of a true American 
hero. Neal Kenneth Todd of Akeley, 
Minnesota, enlisted as a Fireman First 
Class in the U.S. Navy and was sta-
tioned on the USS Oklahoma in Pearl 
Harbor. 
He tragically lost his life on Sunday, 
December 7, 1941, when Japanese tor-
pedoes caused the ship to capsize. 
Initially, Neal Todd was reported 
missing in action, and his family went 
almost 3 months without answers be-
fore learning of his death. To make 
matters worse, his body was never 
identified, leaving his family without 
the closure that they deserved. 
After nearly 80 years of unimaginable 
grief and unanswered questions, Neal’s 
remains have finally been identified, 
beginning the process of returning him 
home to Minnesota. 
On July 10, Neal Todd will be buried 
with full military honors next to his 
brother and parents. It will be my dis-
tinct privilege to join his family in 
Akeley when he returns home. 
Witnessing this American hero laid 
to rest after decades will be an honor, 
but it will also be a somber reminder 
that freedom comes at such a heavy 
price. 
Madam Speaker, we can never forget 
the sacrifices made by heroes like Neal 
Todd. Americans like him are the rea-
son that this Nation is known as the 
land of the free and the home of the 
brave. 
God bless Neal Todd and God bless 
his family. 
f 
LIFTING FAMILIES OUT OF 
POVERTY 
(Ms. STANSBURY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to share in the relief that 
families across New Mexico will be re-
ceiving starting next month. 
Thanks to the American Rescue 
Plan, about 95 percent of New Mexico’s 
children will be eligible to get money 
through the child tax credit. Working 
families with kids will get payments of 
up to $300 monthly per child. That 
means more money for childcare and to 
put food on the table and to support 
our hardworking families. 
I personally know the struggles that 
many New Mexican families face, and 
that is why here in Congress I am con-
tinuing to work to tackle childhood 
hunger and create more opportunities 
to lift our families out of poverty. We 
must make these tax credits perma-
nent and put more money into the 
pockets of hardworking parents so they 
can get back to work and fuel our econ-
omy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3093 
June 24, 2021 
Each year, Pollinator Week focuses 
on promoting the health of pollinators, 
critical 
to 
food 
and 
ecosystems, 
through conservation, education, and 
research. 
It is time we protect natural polli-
nator species, such as honeybees, na-
tive bees, birds, bats, and butterflies, 
as essential partners of farmers and 
ranchers in producing food. 
These pollinators are vital to keeping 
items like fruits, nuts, and vegetables 
in our diets. And healthy pollinator 
populations are crucial to the contin-
ued economic well-being of rural Amer-
ica and the U.S. economy. 
Pollinators provide pollination serv-
ices to over 180,000 different plant spe-
cies and more than 1,200 crops. This 
equates to one out of every three bites 
of food eaten being there because of 
pollinators. 
In addition, pollinators added $217 
billion to the global economy, and hon-
eybees alone are responsible for be-
tween $1.2 and $5.4 billion in agricul-
tural 
productivity 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
Madam Speaker, as someone who has 
a beehive in his backyard, I fully sup-
port efforts to raise awareness and 
keep our pollinators buzzing for gen-
erations to come. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST PROTECT THE 
UNBORN 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to voice my deep disappoint-
ment with President Biden’s fiscal year 
2022 budget request—more specifically, 
the 
President’s 
removal 
of 
long-
standing pro-life protections such as 
the Hyde amendment. 
The Hyde amendment prohibits Fed-
eral funds from being used to pay for 
abortions. Historically, this policy has 
shared strong bipartisan consensus in 
the House. 
I made a promise to my constituents 
to protect the unborn and to give a 
voice to those who have no voice. Since 
coming here to Congress, I have con-
sistently supported pro-life policies. 
This is a value in the First District of 
Michigan that is shared across party 
lines. 
Yet, this President’s budget request 
forces American taxpayers to fund 
abortions, a denial of the basic human 
right to life. 
I strongly urge my colleagues in the 
House to not follow in those footsteps 
and to oppose this proposal. 
As we work through the Federal ap-
propriations process, it is imperative 
Congress maintains these basic protec-
tions and opposes any other policies 
that would promote abortions here in 
the United States and throughout the 
world. 
Let us, the United States of America, 
be an example to the rest of the world 
that, no matter how much we may dis-
agree, we can come together for the 
protection of human life both before 
and after birth. 
f 
COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
CAROL CLEWS 
(Mr. HARRIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate Carol Clews, a 
pro-life leader in Maryland who passed 
away from cancer this spring. Arch-
bishop 
Lori, 
without 
exaggeration, 
called her a ‘‘towering figure’’ in the 
pro-life movement. 
Carol’s vocation was to help women 
in their crisis pregnancies by directing 
the faith-based Greater Baltimore Cen-
ter for Pregnancy Concerns, where 
pregnant women could go for support 
until and after their children were 
born. Her pregnancy center, staffed 
mostly by volunteers, helped thousands 
of women and their children in a time 
of need. 
When the City of Baltimore decreed 
that her pregnancy center had to dis-
play a poster that promoted abortion, 
she refused to do so and took the case 
to Federal district court, where she 
prevailed. On appeal, the Fourth Cir-
cuit upheld the important religious 
protections and free speech rights of 
pregnancy centers from attacks by pro- 
abortion governments that want to 
deny the choice of life for women dur-
ing one of the most vulnerable times of 
their lives. 
The pro-life and pregnancy center 
movements in Maryland will greatly 
miss Carol Clews and her faith and 
courage. The thousands of women and 
their children who were helped by her 
pregnancy centers are her legacy. 
f 
SEEKING URGENT RESPONSE TO 
CALIFORNIA’S DROUGHT 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to request an urgent re-
sponse to California’s drought. 
Since returning to Congress, I have 
introduced two pieces of critical water 
legislation. I have stood here before my 
colleagues asking the House majority 
to address the drought. I have re-
quested hearings be held and sent let-
ters. Yet, the majority has done noth-
ing to help those suffering from this 
crisis. 
Communities in my district, like 
Avenal, Coalinga, and Huron, totally 
rely on 100 percent of their water from 
the delta. That is about 37,000 of my 
constituents relying solely on the delta 
for water. 
My bill, the NEED Water Act, would 
allow communities like these and com-
munities growing our food the ability 
to purchase and transfer water more 
easily. 
As if water wasn’t scarce enough, 
now communities in my district, like 
Teviston, are completely out of water. 
They are forced to rely on bottled 
water delivery programs to receive 
water because their wells have failed. 
It is only a matter of time before there 
are more towns in my district in the 
same situation as Teviston. 
I implore my colleagues across the 
aisle to work with me to combat this 
crisis. This is an emergency, and it is 
unacceptable to stand back and watch 
these communities suffer and com-
pletely run out of water while the real 
solutions available can bring imme-
diate relief. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST INVESTIGATE 
COVID–19 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, we 
know that more than 600,000 Americans 
and 3.8 million people worldwide have 
died as a result of COVID–19. A recent 
study found that cases could have been 
significantly reduced around the globe 
if interventions in China could have 
been conducted just weeks earlier. 
It is a widely accepted fact that Chi-
na’s obstruction and coverup cost lives. 
It is simple: China lied and Americans 
died. 
Also, despite mounting credible evi-
dence that COVID–19 may have actu-
ally originated from a Chinese lab, 
Congress has not held a single hearing 
on the origins of COVID–19. 
I am proud to be one of 200 Repub-
lican Members calling for these nec-
essary investigations. Americans have 
a right to know the truth, and we must 
hold 
China 
accountable 
for 
their 
COVID coverup.

RECOGNIZING TRAVIS BURROW 
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Detective Travis Bur-
row for his remarkable contributions 
to his community as general case de-
tective for the Great Falls Police De-
partment. 
This past week, Detective Burrow 
was named Officer of the Year by the 
Montana Police Protective Association 
for his service as lead investigator for 
major criminal activity in Great Falls. 
His investigations included high-profile 
cases such as homicides, kidnappings, 
robberies, arson, missing persons, and 
suspicious death investigations. 
Detective Burrow’s competence and 
experience has made him a valuable re-
source to the department, where he 
consults on his coworkers’ cases and 
serves as a leader and mentor to his 
colleagues. 
Detective Burrow continues to serve 
the Great Falls Police Department 
with honor and distinction.

EQUAL 
ACCESS 
TO 
CONTRACEP-
TION FOR VETERANS ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 486, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 239) to amend title 38, 
United States Code, to provide for limi-
tations on copayments for contracep-
tion furnished by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, and for other pur-
poses, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 486, the bill is 
considered read. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 239 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Equal Ac-
cess to Contraception for Veterans Act’’. 
SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON COPAYMENTS FOR CON-
TRACEPTION. 
Section 1722A(a)(2) of title 38, United 
States Code, is amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘to pay’’ and all that fol-
lows through the period and inserting ‘‘to 
pay—’’; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraphs: 
‘‘(A) an amount in excess of the cost to the 
Secretary for medication described in para-
graph (1); or 
‘‘(B) an amount for any contraceptive item 
for which coverage under health insurance 
coverage is required without the imposition 
of any cost-sharing requirement pursuant to 
section 2713(a)(4) of the Public Health Serv-
ice Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg–13(a)(4)).’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill 
shall be debatable for 1 hour equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
the ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs or 
their respective designees. 
The gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) and the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. BOST) each will control 30 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 239. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, this is not the first 
time I speak in favor of Representative 
BROWNLEY’s bill, H.R. 239, the Equal 
Access to Contraception for Veterans 
Act, but I continue to advocate for this 
bill because it is an essential compo-
nent of supporting the fastest-growing 
population of our Nation’s heroes, our 2 
million women veterans. 
Last week, this bill was defeated on 
the suspension calendar when the Fam-
ily Research Council mobilized efforts 
with my colleagues in the Freedom 
Caucus who suggested that the bill 
pushes a ‘‘harmful ideology.’’ Dis-
torting this debate into one about 
abortion, frankly, does not make any 
sense at all. 
I again remind my colleagues that 
this legislation passed out of our com-
mittee with the support of Ranking 
Member BOST and through the House 
last Congress with the support of 
former Ranking Member Dr. Roe. I 
know that Dr. Roe is a fierce pro-life 
advocate, but as an OB/GYN, he under-
stood the importance of access to con-
traception. 
Let me be clear. This bill brings vet-
erans’ contraception coverage on par 
with care they received while on Active 
Duty from the Department of Defense 
and 
coverage 
required 
by 
private 
health 
insurance 
providers 
to 
all 
women in the United States since 
2010—all women except those who seek 
care from the VA. 
Now, this bill is about healthcare. 
This bill is about access. This bill is 
about equity, especially for our women 
veterans. 
I thank Ranking Member BOST and 
Minority Leader MCCARTHY for their 
leadership in support of this bipartisan 
bill. 
Simply put, a ‘‘no’’ vote today is say-
ing directly to veterans that they de-
serve less healthcare than all other 
Americans. To me, the choice is easy. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 239. We cannot per-
mit veterans to be made second-class 
citizens. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 239, the Equal Access to 
Contraception for Veterans Act. This 
bill is sponsored by Congresswoman 
JULIA BROWNLEY. I thank her for intro-
ducing it. 
The Equal Access to Contraception 
for Veterans Act passed the House last 
year with the support of the Trump ad-
ministration. 
It would eliminate copays for birth 
control at the VA healthcare system. 
In doing so, it would remove a barrier 
to care for women veterans. It would 
bring VA in line with the Department 
of Defense and the private sector. It 
would correct a fundamental unfair-
ness that means women pay more for 
birth control at the VA than elsewhere. 
And it would not in any way contradict 
or undermine the prohibition against 
abortion and abortion counseling at 
the VA that already exists in law and 
regulation. 
Women are the fastest-growing group 
of servicemembers and veterans. They 
are raising their right hands to serve 
this country in record numbers. Ensur-
ing they are cared for as veterans is 
one of my top priorities as the lead Re-
publican on the VA Committee. 
We have made progress in making 
the VA safer and more welcome to 
women, but we still have a long way to 
go. Women veterans die by suicide at 
two times the rate as nonveteran 
women. Most of the veterans who die 
by suicide are not engaged in VA care 
at the time of their death. That is why 
connecting more veterans with the VA 
is key to stopping veteran suicide. 
b 1230 
One of the primary ways we can con-
nect more veterans with VA is by re-
moving barriers that prevent them 
from seeking the care and benefits they 
have earned. This bill will help to do 
that. 
Women seeking birth control in the 
private sector do not pay copays. 
Women seeking birth control on Ac-
tive Duty do not pay copays. 
This bill will make it so women seek-
ing birth control at VA do not pay 
copays either. That is all this bill does. 
Once again, that is all this bill does. 
Why would we want a woman to pay 
more for birth control as a veteran 
than she did while on Active Duty? 
Why would we want a woman to pay 
more for birth control at the VA than 
she would in the private sector?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3095 
June 24, 2021 
Is that any way to thank her for 
serving her country and defending our 
freedoms? I don’t think so. 
Neither does Leader MCCARTHY, nei-
ther did the Trump administration. 
Neither do many of my conservative 
pro-life lawmakers both in this Con-
gress and last Congress. 
To be clear, this bill does not require 
allowing VA to provide any additional 
form of birth control other than those 
already available at the VA. 
And once again, it does not in any 
way contradict or undermine the prohi-
bition against VA providing abortions 
and/or abortion counseling to veterans. 
That is vitally important to me. I 
know it is for many of my colleagues, 
as well. 
I have really weighed this out and 
prayed this out and sought the lan-
guage and read the language. My life 
has been a pro-life life. I am not chang-
ing those positions, and this bill 
doesn’t change that position either. I 
have taken the counsel of doctors who 
are familiar with the mechanics of 
birth control that are being afforded 
here. They are not abortion. 
I am confident that supporting this 
bill is the right thing to do for our Na-
tion’s veterans. I am confident that it 
is consistent with pro-life principles. 
Madam Speaker, I hope all of my col-
leagues join me in voting this after-
noon, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. BROWNLEY), my 
good friend from my home State, and 
the chairwoman of the Subcommittee 
on Health, and also the author of this 
very important piece of legislation. 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 239, the 
Equal Access to Contraception for Vet-
erans Act. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man and Ranking Member BOST for 
their support. This bill is a simple one. 
It only addresses the disparity between 
veterans who must pay for contracep-
tion, and civilians and women cur-
rently serving in uniform, who do not 
have to pay for contraception. 
As the chairwoman of the Women’s 
Veterans Task Force and chair of the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee 
on Health, I have worked to identify 
disparities in healthcare for our women 
veterans, and where necessary, intro-
duce, advocate for, and pass legislation 
that eliminates those gaps. 
Madam Speaker, I was proud to work 
with my Republican colleagues to pass 
the bipartisan Deborah Sampson Act 
last Congress. This legislation, which 
was the most comprehensive bill to ad-
dress the needs of women veterans in 
more than a decade, received over-
whelming bipartisan support. But there 
are still far too many areas where 
women veterans have to pay more for 
their healthcare than men; and in this 
case, they have to pay more than non-
veteran women. 
These inequities create an environ-
ment that perpetuates the notion that 
women are not equal to men, and in 
this case, veteran women are not even 
equal to other women. This bill passed 
through the House last Congress by 
voice vote. It also passed out of the VA 
Committee this Congress with strong 
bipartisan support. 
It was deeply troubling that misin-
formation and politics got in the way 
of helping our women veterans last 
week, when the bill failed to pass under 
suspension, which is why we are back 
here again this week. 
Let us be clear, this was a direct slap 
in the face to nearly 2 million women 
veterans living in the United States. 
Because of the Affordable Care Act, 
women using civilian health insurance 
may access basic contraceptive serv-
ices, like the pill, or an IUD without 
any copay. Additionally, Active Duty 
servicemembers receive contraceptive 
care without any copays. So current 
law 
is 
specifically 
penalizing 
our 
women veterans. As we know, choosing 
when, or if, to have a family is essen-
tial to women’s health and to their 
economic security. 
Madam Speaker, 87 percent of Ameri-
cans agree that everyone deserves ac-
cess to the full range of birth control 
methods, no matter who they are, 
where they live, what their economic 
status is. The vast majority of the 
American 
people 
believe 
veteran 
women deserve to be recognized and de-
serve to be treated with the respect 
they have earned. The vast majority of 
the American people also believe that 
birth control should be a basic part of 
women’s healthcare. 
I am particularly disappointed that 
this bipartisan commitment to sup-
porting our women veterans seems to 
have hit a roadblock this Congress. Our 
veterans, both men and women, have 
sacrificed so much for our country. It 
is past time that we ensure they get 
the equitable healthcare they have 
earned and deserve. 
Let us do the right thing today on be-
half of our women veterans, for their 
equality, for their liberty, for their 
healthcare, and for their economic se-
curity. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 239. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Mon-
tana (Mr. ROSENDALE). 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Illinois for 
yielding to me. 
Madam Speaker, my constituents 
sent me here to Washington to fight 
tooth and nail on behalf of the unborn. 
I rise today in strong opposition to 
H.R. 239, the Equal Access to Contra-
ception Act for Veterans. This radical 
piece of legislation would require tax-
payers to subsidize the full cost of all 
contraception through the Department 
of Veterans Affairs, including Plan B 
and Ella. 
Let me be clear, drugs like Plan B 
and Ella are not contraception, they 
are 
abortifacients. 
These 
chemical 
drugs prevent a newly conceived em-
bryo, a human embryo, from implant-
ing in the uterus and continuing to de-
velop as a child. Again, that is not con-
traception, that is abortion. 
Using taxpayer funding for abortions 
is not only wildly unpopular, it is im-
moral. It forces tens of millions of peo-
ple who have personal or religious ob-
jections to abortion and abortifacient 
drugs to fund the termination of life. 
That must not and should not be the 
public’s obligation. The true measure 
of any society can be found in how it 
treats its most vulnerable, especially 
the unborn. 
Since the ruling of Roe v. Wade, well 
over 62 billion abortions have occurred 
in the United States. To put it in per-
spective, that is more than the amount 
of worldwide casualties directly caused 
by World War II, the most deadly mili-
tary conflict in the history of the 
world. 
The loss of life on such a tragic, mas-
sive scale due to abortion is heinous. If 
passed, this legislation will increase 
abortions committed in the United 
States, and that is at the taxpayer’s 
expense. This is absolutely unaccept-
able. We must do better as a Nation. 
When this bill was considered in com-
mittee last month, a majority of the 
Republicans voted against it. Last 
week, we considered this bill under sus-
pension of the rules, and fortunately, 
187 of my Republican colleagues joined 
me and stood for life. Due to this 
strong showing of opposition, we were 
able to prevent the two-thirds super-
majority needed to pass this bill under 
the suspension of the rules, dealing 
Speaker PELOSI a significant legisla-
tive defeat. 
That is why Democrats—and even 
some Republicans, unfortunately—have 
brought this bill back to the floor 
today under a rule for debate. I hope 
the Republicans will be just as unified 
in opposition of this bill today. An-
other strong vote would send a message 
that the Republican Party is the party 
of life. 
Our constituents expect us not to 
compromise in our defense of the un-
born. To support legislation like H.R. 
239, which promotes the killing of the 
unborn, at taxpayers’ expense, is the 
ultimate betrayal. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I just 
want to say that extremism in the de-
fense of nonsense is not conservatism, 
it is still nonsense. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mr. 
MRVAN), my good friend, and member 
of the House Committee on Veterans’ 
Affairs, and the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Technology and Mod-
ernization. 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman TAKANO for yielding 
me the time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ex-
press my support for H.R. 239, the 
Equal Access to Contraception for Vet-
erans Act of 2021. I first commend my 
colleague on the House Committee on 
Veterans’ 
Affairs, 
Congresswoman

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3096 
June 24, 2021 
BROWNLEY, for her leadership and per-
severance to see that this critically 
important legislation is passed by the 
House. 
It is not acceptable that today 
women veterans do not have access to 
the same contraception coverage all 
Americans currently have available 
through the Affordable Care Act or pri-
vate insurance, and all Active Duty 
servicemembers have through the De-
partment of Defense. 
Women veterans are the fastest grow-
ing group of veterans enrolling in the 
Department 
of 
Veterans’ 
Affairs 
healthcare system, and it is time that 
our policies for women veterans show 
them the support, respect, and fairness 
that they deserve. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my chair-
man, again, for the time, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Geor-
gia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to just take a 
minute to remind everyone that words 
matter, and their meanings need to be 
exactly clear. 
Contraception stops a woman from 
becoming pregnant. The Plan B pill 
kills a baby in the womb once a woman 
is already pregnant. You see, the Equal 
Access to Contraception for Veterans 
Act is not contraception, it is pro-
viding, with taxpayer dollars, the abil-
ity for women to have an abortion. The 
government should not be paying for 
abortion. The VA should not be paying 
for abortion. The American taxpayer 
should not be paying for abortion. So 
this is why this is very important for 
all of us to do what we are called to do 
and not play a part in killing a baby in 
the womb. 
Madam Speaker, this is why I am 
asking all of my colleagues to vote 
against the Equal Access to Contracep-
tion for Veterans Act. It is time to de-
fend life in the womb. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank both Con-
gressman ROSENDALE
and Congress-
woman GREENE, and I appreciate their 
comments on the sanctity of life, and 
as freshman Members, their commit-
ment to our Nation’s veterans. 
Now, I agree with both of their com-
ments on life. I disagree on this bill. 
This is a bill that we have discussed 
many times, and the fact is, the emer-
gency contraception is available to 
veterans at VA today and has been for 
many, many years. 
You mentioned some of the groups 
who are opposed to this legislation, and 
I respect their viewpoints, and most 
often agree with them. But I do think 
it is appropriate to note right now, 
however, that just a couple hours ago, 
the Heritage Action for America clari-
fied their position on this bill. 
Importantly, Heritage Action noted 
that the emergency contraception is 
not—I repeat—is not a chemical abor-
tion drug and cannot be used to induce 
abortion. I think it is important for 
our Members to keep that in mind 
today. 
And I also think it is important that 
you understand that many of our col-
leagues who are pro-life should not be 
questioned on this bill because it has 
been people who are pro-life that have 
not only worked on this bill this ses-
sion, but last. And it is vitally impor-
tant that not only the Members know 
this, but the American people know it 
as well. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1245 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD), my 
good friend and a member of the House 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and 
also a very active member of the 
Health Subcommittee. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 239, 
the Equal Access to Contraception for 
Veterans Act, led by the chairwoman 
of the Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee 
on 
Health, 
Congresswoman 
JULIA 
BROWNLEY. 
Chairwoman BROWNLEY and I have 
worked together on this issue for 
years. It is about fairness, fairness for 
the nearly 2 million women veterans 
who currently don’t have access to the 
same healthcare as civilian women. 
The Affordable Care Act requires pri-
vate insurance plans to provide contra-
ceptive services without copays, but 
veterans using VA care have to pay out 
of pocket for those same services. It is 
unacceptable that women who have 
served our country bear financial bur-
dens that most other Americans don’t 
have to worry about. 
This fix is long overdue. And last 
week’s unconscionable delay by our Re-
publican colleagues harmed our vet-
erans even more. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
put partisanship aside and vote for 
H.R. 239. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time is remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California has 22 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Illi-
nois has 20 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL), my 
good friend and new member of the 
House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 
where she also serves on the Health 
Subcommittee. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. TAKANO 
and Ms. BROWNLEY for their magnifi-
cent leadership advancing the health 
and safety of our women veterans. 
Madam Speaker, my, my, my, this 
bill, which passed unanimously last 
session, is just mind-boggling that now 
some Republicans are opposing it. 
Really? 
I am going to say this: As a very 
proud mother of a son of a United 
States Marine Corps veteran, I know 
the risks and sacrifices of our brave 
military. So I say without hesitation, 
after service to our country is com-
pleted, no veteran of the United States 
Armed Forces should be forced to pay 
out-of-pocket expenses for preventative 
care, 
including 
contraception, 
that 
their civilian counterparts do not pay. 
Small copays can be prohibitive for 
veterans struggling to make ends meet. 
In fact, studies show that costs associ-
ated with contraception, even when 
small, lead some people to forego it 
completely, to choose less effective 
methods, or use it inconsistently. 
Here is the thing, Madam Speaker; 
the decision about whether or when or 
how to become a parent is one of the 
most important decisions a person can 
make. Our veterans were willing to 
stand up and take bullets for our free-
dom, so we need to stand up for theirs. 
Let’s make it clear, today we are fo-
cused on access to birth control. 
The Republican position conflating 
abortion and contraception is part of a 
broader extreme effort to block access 
to any type of reproductive healthcare. 
So let’s eliminate the barriers and get 
the veterans the healthcare they need. 
Madam Speaker, I call on my col-
leagues to demonstrate their commit-
ment to the patriotic people who make 
up our military and veteran commu-
nities by passing this very good bill, 
Equal Access to Contraception for Vet-
erans Act. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN), my good friend and 
a member of the Financial Services 
Committee, where he is chairman of 
the Oversight and Investigations Sub-
committee. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, when I arrived here in Congress in 
2005, there was a necessary facility, 
also known as the men’s room, right 
across diagonally from me outside of 
this Chamber. There was no such facil-
ity for women. In fact, it was the Par-
liamentarian’s office to my left, just 
outside of this facility. 
Madam Speaker, it was under the 
leadership of the Honorable NANCY 
PELOSI that we now have equal facili-
ties for men and women just off the 
floor of the House. Things change, but 
they don’t change on their own voli-
tion. The arc of the universe, the moral 
universe, bends because of the hands of 
women and men. 
Today, we have an opportunity to 
again treat women with the same level 
of dignity and respect who are in the 
military as we do those who are with-
out the military, and, to a certain ex-
tent, the same way we were treating 
men when I arrived in this Congress. 
Things change. This is an oppor-
tunity to be a part of an historic 
change. It may seem small to you, but

to the people who have to bear the bur-
den of this invidious discrimination, it 
is not the same. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I greatly appreciate it. I shall be 
terse and laconic and pithy and con-
cise. 
It is time for change to again come 
to the House of Representatives. I sup-
port this legislation, and I beg that my 
colleagues would do so. It is time for 
change. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. CHU), my good 
friend and the chair of the Congres-
sional Asian Pacific American Caucus. 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, as the 
chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus’ Con-
traception and Family Planning Task 
Force, I rise in strong support of Con-
gresswoman BROWNLEY’s Equal Access 
to Contraception for Veterans Act. 
Every day, servicemembers are will-
ing to sacrifice their lives for our con-
stitutional rights. So we must ensure 
that those rights are available to them 
when they come home, and that in-
cludes the right to contraception. 
That is what this bill does, by ensur-
ing that veterans, just like their civil-
ian neighbors, have access to the con-
traception that works best for them, 
without the burden of copays. And 
since we know that not every method 
of birth control works for every person, 
this bill requires the VA to cover all 
FDA-approved contraception, including 
emergency contraception, which is an 
especially important option in sexual 
assault. 
Contraception helps people plan for 
their futures, for their families, and for 
themselves. This bill removes unneces-
sary barriers to care for our veterans 
who have already given this Nation so 
much. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this impor-
tant legislation. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me just say that 
this bill by Ms. BROWNLEY is about pro-
viding equal access to contraceptions 
for our Nation’s veterans. To oppose 
this bill is to advocate for a situation 
where veterans are made second-class 
citizens. 
This bill is about contraception. No-
where in the bill’s text or in the title 
does the word ‘‘abortion’’ even appear. 
I would ask my colleagues who are in 
opposition to the bill to read the one- 
page text very carefully. I think they 
will see that there is no reference to, in 
any way, the word ‘‘abortion.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I would also say, I 
think it was H.L. Mencken who said 
that consistency is often the hobgoblin 
of little minds. 
For 
those 
Members 
who 
voted 
against this bill, you know, in fear of 
the moment, they can reconsider their 
vote and, I think, get on the right side 
of the issue in terms of equality for our 
veterans. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY), my colleague and very 
good friend, the chairwoman of the En-
ergy and Commerce Subcommittee on 
Consumer Protection and Commerce. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chair for his friendship and 
for letting me speak. 
Madam Speaker, you know, I rise 
with great enthusiastic support for the 
Equal Access to Contraception for Vet-
erans Act. 
No veteran of the United States of 
America should be forced to pay out of 
pocket for basic preventative care. You 
know, this is 2021. Birth control should 
not be controversial. Veterans’ access 
to healthcare should not be controver-
sial. 
And I really think, how dare Mem-
bers on the other side even consider 
shutting down this bill on suspension. 
Our veterans deserve access to all of 
the healthcare services that they need, 
and that would include every method 
of birth control. 
Really? Are we still arguing this? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I urge all Members to just say—this is 
something that is basic right now, we 
all believe that contraception should 
be available. And, you know, it can end 
up actually being quite expensive. 
And why? 
I don’t understand. So I think this 
legislation is long overdue. Let’s pass 
it today. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, if I may, I just want 
to reiterate to my friends and col-
leagues that I am pro-life. Many of the 
people that have supported this and 
will support this are pro-life, even 
groups now that are saying and men-
tioning this is contraception. It is con-
traception. It is not abortion. 
Let me also say that this includes no 
other drugs or expansion of drugs that 
are available. We want to be very, very 
clear on that. It does not change the 
position of VA on abortion in any way, 
shape, or form. This is only doing what 
is right for our veterans and allowing 
them the opportunity to receive ex-
actly what someone in the private sec-
tor receives and/or someone on Active 
Duty receives. 
I am hoping that my colleagues will 
understand this and understand those 
of us who support this and why. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1300 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
honor and courage with which my 
counterpart, Ranking Member BOST, 
has defended and stood up for the 
truth. And the truth is, H.R. 239 by 
Chairwoman BROWNLEY is about pro-
viding equal access to contraception to 
America’s veterans. 
A ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill—and I will 
say it again—a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill is 
a vote to make our veterans second- 
class citizens. 
Every other American under every 
other plan in this country, whether it 
is in private healthcare, because we 
passed the Affordable Care Act and said 
that every American is entitled to pre-
ventative services, including contra-
ception, since 2010, or Active Duty 
servicemembers under the Department 
of Defense who are able to access con-
traception 
without 
copays—Ms. 
BROWNLEY’s bill simply makes veterans 
on equal footing with all other Ameri-
cans. 
A ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill is to make 
our veterans second-class citizens, and 
I say of those who make that vote: 
Shame on them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 486, 
the previous question is ordered on the

Services or their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. WATERS) and the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY) each 
will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on H.R. 1443 and to insert extra-
neous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1443, the LGBTQ Business Equal 
Credit Enforcement and Investment 
Act, for the second time this month. 
As we discussed on the floor last 
week, this bill, led by Representative 
RITCHIE TORRES, would provide much- 
needed transparency in lending to 
LGBTQ-owned businesses by updating 
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to 
ensure financial institutions report the 
sexual orientation and gender identity 
of applicants for business loans. 
This legislation is needed because re-
search shows that LGBTQ individuals 
have experienced discrimination when 
applying for a mortgage or other forms 
of credit. However, due to a lack of 
data collection, we do not know the ex-
tent of discrimination when it comes 
to business loans, who has been af-
fected, and, more importantly, how it 
can be corrected. 
According to one estimate, there are 
approximately 
1.4 
million 
LGBTQ- 
owned businesses across our country. 
These entrepreneurs should be treated 
fairly, and the data collected on small 
business owners by Mr. TORRES’ bill 
will help to identify and prevent dis-
crimination and will enable commu-
nities, policymakers, and lenders to 
support the development and invest-
ment needs of LGBTQ-owned busi-
nesses. 
I thank Representative TORRES for 
his leadership on this important bill. 
But I also want to express my dis-
appointment that so many of our Re-
publican colleagues decided to vote 
down this bill last week when it was 
considered under suspension of the 
rules. This bill passed the committee 
on a voice vote, and we worked with 
the ranking member, Mr. MCHENRY, to 
address concerns he had. 
I thank Ranking Member MCHENRY 
for working with us and for his sup-
port. 
I hope my colleagues who voted ‘‘no’’ 
will reconsider their position and vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1443. Whether or not 
they do, let me assure our friends, 
neighbors, constituents, and colleagues 
in the LGBTQ community that, one 
way or the other, this House will pass 
this bill. After all, this is the people’s 
House, and we simply cannot let lend-
ing or other forms of discrimination 
against any of our people stand. 
As we discussed last week, this is 
Pride Month and a time to celebrate all 
the 
wonderful 
contributions 
the 
LGBTQ community has given to our 
economy and our country. 
So, Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, we can all agree 
that data is important, but we need to 
recognize, particularly as it relates to 
obtaining data on companies, that each 
one is unique. 
Mandatory reporting metrics do not 
accurately measure progress. Just look 
at the mandatory disclosure bills that 
we had on the floor last week. The only 
outcome we can expect to see is higher 
compliance costs on companies, leav-
ing fewer resources to build our work-
force and invest in research and tech-
nology to compete globally. Simply 
put, one size fits all does not work. 
However, this bill, the bill we have 
before us today, does not impose a 
mandatory reporting regime. Data is 
collected on a voluntary basis. Any 
loan applicant who does not want to 
provide information can decline to pro-
vide it, meaning there are fewer con-
cerns over privacy because it is vol-
untary and fewer concerns over one- 
size-fits-all data reporting. 
I appreciate my Democratic col-
leagues having offered a solution to 
promoting diversity inclusion without 
imposing requirements on businesses 
or business owners that do not effec-
tively measure their success. 
Thus, Madam Speaker, I support the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, it has been a preeminent privilege 
to serve under Chair WATERS’ leader-
ship on the Financial Services Com-
mittee. I think I can say without ques-
tion, reservation, hesitation, or equivo-
cation that, under the gentlewoman’s 
leadership, we have seen great change. 
But I also know this: that under her 
leadership, there is greater change to 
come. It is my honor to serve under the 
gentlewoman’s leadership. 
And still I rise, Madam Speaker, and 
I rise today to support H.R. 1443, the 
LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforce-
ment and Investment Act. And I rise to 
thank the ranking member for his sup-
port of this legislation. He has been 
steadfast, and he has been true to his 
word. 
I am honored to support this legisla-
tion, and I think that it is appropriate 
for me to address, first, the question of 
whether invidious discrimination ex-
ists. 
Madam Speaker, if you deny that in-
vidious discrimination exists, then you 
have to deny the existence of the KKK. 
To deny the existence of invidious dis-
crimination would necessitate a denial 
of those who were in Charlottesville 
screaming: ‘‘Blood and soil,’’ ‘‘Jews 
will not replace us.’’ 
I believe the case is self-evident: in-
vidious discrimination exists. 
Currently, we have a system that al-
lows us to collect the empirical evi-
dence necessary to not only identify 
the invidious discrimination but also 
help us to prevent the invidious dis-
crimination. This legislation is abso-
lutely necessary to acquire the empir-
ical intelligence so that we may go for-
ward and prevent invidious discrimina-
tion. 
By acquiring this intelligence, I 
might add, we will also deter some of 
the people who have good sense such 
that they won’t commit invidious dis-
crimination because they will be aware 
of the intelligence acquisition. 
How do we do this? Here is how it 
happens: Currently, when you make 
your 
application, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there is a place for you to indicate 
whether you are a minority person. If I

am filling out the application, I would 
probably indicate that I am a minority 
person, although I don’t like the term. 
I use it only to communicate. I do not 
like the term ‘‘minority.’’ But for the 
purpose of communicating today, I 
would indicate that I am a minority 
person. 
The only thing this bill will do, as it 
relates to acquiring the intelligence, is 
give us another space so that we can 
now indicate that, if you so choose, 
Madam Speaker, you are a member of 
the LGBTQ-plus community. 
In filling out this form, if I chose not 
to indicate I was a minority person, I 
wouldn’t have to. I would just sign it, 
completing the other aspects of it, and 
I would be done with it. 
It only allows for the placement of 
additional language on the document 
so that persons who desire to—and it is 
important to note, Madam Speaker, 
that you must have the desire; it is 
with intentionality, and you volun-
tarily do this—would indicate, if you 
choose to, that you are a member of 
the LGBTQ-plus community. 
b 1315 
I must say, candidly, I really don’t 
see how this can become the debate 
that it has become. At some point in 
this country, we have to understand 
that discriminating against people be-
cause of who they are is inappropriate. 
It is unlawful. 
I am the son of a segregated South, 
where I was lawfully discriminated 
against. I know what it looks like. I 
know what it smells like. I know what 
it sounds like. I know what invidious 
discrimination tastes like. I drank 
from filthy colored water fountains in 
my lifetime. 
I don’t wish any of this type of be-
havior that I had to endure on anyone 
else, so I rise today in support of this 
legislation as a continuation of my 
mission to do all that I can to help oth-
ers avoid the horrors of invidious dis-
crimination. 
I am so grateful to Chairwoman 
WATERS for all she has done. She has 
always been a friend, not only to me, 
but to those who are among the least, 
the last, and the lost. And I thank the 
gentlewoman for all that she has done. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I think my col-
league Mr. GREEN outlines this well. 
This is not a mandatory reporting bill, 
but data collection. Though the terms 
may 
not 
be 
perfect 
to 
Chairman 
GREEN’s points and perhaps we need to 
look at the language of this reporting, 
for sure, but this is not a mandatory 
reporting bill. This is voluntary infor-
mation that borrowers can offer up or 
not. Data is a good thing, especially if 
it is provided voluntarily. 
For those reasons, I support this bill 
and I urge its adoption. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, this bill takes nec-
essary action to help ensure that 
LGBTQ-owned businesses are treated 
fairly by financial institutions and pro-
tected against lending discrimination. 
The bill passed unanimously out of the 
House Financial Services Committee 
with a voice vote. So I am pleased that 
the majority leader has worked with 
me to bring this bill back up for a vote 
quickly. 
This bill is supported by the Human 
Rights Campaign, the National Center 
for Transgender Equality, Out Leader-
ship, the National Gay and Lesbian 
Chamber of Commerce, and many oth-
ers. 
Although some of my colleagues did 
not support this bill last week, I urge 
them to reconsider, to support all 
small businesses this week, and vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1443. 
I would like to thank the ranking 
member for his consideration, his sup-
port. In closing, I would just like to 
add that, as Mr. GREEN identified, I, 
too, am a victim of discrimination for 
most of my life, and all of my family 
and my dear friends and sometimes the 
entire neighborhood that I have lived 
in. 
So we know what it feels like, and we 
know that there is, for example, today, 
a huge wealth gap because of discrimi-
nation, a lack of being able to borrow 
from the banks that were making cred-
it available to so many others. It was 
not made to us. So oftentimes we were 
not able to buy a home. We were not 
able to get a loan for the basic kind of 
things that any family would need. 
So we cannot, and I cannot be a part 
of public policy and systems and proto-
cols that would exclude the LGBTQ 
community from being able to get 
loans in the ways that others are 
doing. It is pure discrimination. It 
must stop. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
vote ‘‘yea’’ on H.R. 1443, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam Speak-
er, in the United States, there are 1.4 million 
LGBTQ businesses contributing more than 
$1.7 trillion to the American economy. We 
have a vested interest in sustaining and 
strengthening these businesses with equal ac-
cess to credit, which is the beating heart of 
the American economy. 
As a former New York City Council Member, 
I partnered with the National LGBTQ Chamber 
of Commerce to establish the nation’s largest 
municipal certification program for LGBTQ 
business enterprises, enabling those busi-
nesses to enjoy equal access to a $25 billion 
pool of government procurement. 
The legislation before us, H.R. 1443, builds 
on a foundation laid by several statutes and 
regulations. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act 
(ECOA) prohibits credit discrimination, includ-
ing but not limited to sex discrimination. A new 
interpretive rule from the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau (CFPB) clarifies that the 
ECOA’s prohibition against sex discrimination 
applies to sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity. Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act, 
which exists to enable and enhance the en-
forcement of the ECOA, requires financial in-
stitutions to report information about the race, 
ethnicity, and sex of credit applicants who 
serve as principal owners of small businesses. 
My legislation would expand the 1071 report-
ing requirements to include not only sex but 
also sexual orientation and gender identity. It 
would enable anti-discrimination enforcement 
where none might exist. 
Even though the United States has made 
substantial strides toward LGBTQ equality, the 
mission is far from accomplished. Seventy 
percent of the LGBTQ community remains un-
protected by anti-discrimination laws. When it 
comes to credit, according to the Williams In-
stitute, more than 7.7 million LGBTQ adults 
live in states that offer no protection against 
discrimination based on sexual orientation or 
gender identity. 
It is often said that knowledge is power. 
Knowledge affords us the power to detect dis-
crimination that might otherwise go unde-
tected. Take, as an example, the Home Mort-
gage Disclosure Act, which is analogous to 
the legislation before us. Both the National 
Community Reinvestment Coalition and Iowa 
State University reviewed data from the HMDA 
and found that same-sex couples were denied 
loans at higher rates than heterosexual cou-
ples, despite having comparable creditworthi-
ness. It also found those same-sex couples 
paid higher fees and interests. The lesson of 
the HMDA is that sunlight can be a powerful 
disinfectant against discrimination. 
H.R. 1443 would make credit more acces-
sible, credit laws more enforceable, and credi-
tors more accountable. It would represent a 
triumph of transparency in the service of eco-
nomic opportunity for all, regardless of who 
you are and whom you love. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time

Pursuant to House Resolution 486,

The Clerk read the title of the joint 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 486, the joint 
resolution is considered read. 
The text of the joint resolution is as 
follows: 
S.J. RES. 15 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress 
assembled, 
That 
Congress 
dis-
approves the rule submitted by the Office of 
the Comptroller of Currency relating to ‘‘Na-
tional Banks and Federal Savings Associa-
tions as Lenders’’ (85 Fed. Reg. 68742 (Octo-
ber 30, 2020)), and such rule shall have no 
force or effect. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
joint resolution shall be debatable for

ity member of the Committee on Fi-
nancial Services or their respective 
designee.

(Ms. WATERS) and the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY) each 
will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on S.J. Res. 15 and to insert ex-
traneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of S.J. Res. 15, a resolution to in-
validate the Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency’s so-called True Lender 
Rule under the Congressional Review 
Act. 
This resolution would end a dan-
gerous Trump-era rule that would 
allow predatory lenders to evade State 
usury laws and target consumers with 
high interest rate loans of 150 percent 
or higher through sham partnerships 
with banks. 
I would like to thank Representative 
GARCI´A from Illinois for introducing 
the House companion to this measure 
and for his leadership in fighting to 
protect 
consumers 
from 
predatory 
lending schemes. 
My committee has held several hear-
ings that have exposed the consumer 
harm that results from these rent-a- 
bank schemes and explored how the 
Trump administration’s harmful rule 
erodes the consumer protections. 
The OCC’s rule undoes centuries of 
case law that ensured that nonbank fi-
nancial institutions were subject to 
State interest rate caps when they 
partnered with banks, so long as they 
held the primary economic interest in 
a consumer loan. 
Trump’s OCC allowed nonbanks to 
launder their loans through OCC-char-
tered banks, as long as the bank is list-
ed on the loan origination documents, 
effectively allowing nonbanks to ig-
nore State usury laws. 
Simply put, before this Trump-era 
rule was finalized, if a nonbank in Cali-
fornia, which has an interest rate cap 
of, for example, 36 percent, wanted to 
make a loan to a customer in Cali-
fornia, the nonbank can’t charge more 
than 36 percent. OCC’s True Lender 
Rule turns this commonsense legal 
doctrine on its head. 
What the Trump-era rule says is that 
this nonbank can now partner with a 
national bank that is based in, for ex-
ample, Utah, which doesn’t have an in-
terest rate cap, to now legally charge 
virtually any interest rate to the con-
sumers in California. 
This is true even if the bank in Utah 
has done nothing but put its name on 
the loan paperwork and intends to im-
mediately transfer the loan to the 
nonbank in California. We have seen 
interest rates of more than 150 percent 
charged to consumers in this way. 
The committee’s work has shone a 
spotlight on heartbreaking stories of 
the harm that this rule has caused to 
consumers and small business owners. 
Let me give you a real-world example 
of a Black-owned small business that 
was harmed by one of these rent-a- 
bank schemes authorized by Trump’s 
OCC. 
A recent news report detailed the 
case of Carlos and Markisha Swepson, 
who were the owners of Boulevard Bi-
stro, a restaurant in Harlem, New 
York. As they told NBC News, they 
took out several business loans for 
$67,000 and were charged a whopping 268 
percent APR. 
For all intents and purposes, their 
lender was World Business Lenders, a 
nonbank lender that has a partnership 
with Axos Bank. This is a bank in New 
York State. Even though the loan was 
made by World Business Lenders, be-
cause Axos Bank’s name was on the 
loan documents, the nonbank could by-
pass the New York usury limit of 25 
percent APR. 
Due to the pandemic, the Swepsons 
are now behind on their loan payments. 
They are now facing foreclosure pro-
ceedings filed by World Business Lend-
ers on a home they own that acts as 
collateral for the high interest rate 
loans. If not for Trump’s rule, the 
Swepsons 
would 
have 
only 
been 
charged a 25 percent interest rate and 
would probably not be facing financial 
ruin. 
If Congress lets this Trump-era rule 
stand, these kinds of predatory, triple- 
digit interest rate loans will continue 
to be made through these kinds of rent- 
a-bank schemes, and lenders will con-
tinue to take advantage of small busi-
ness owners and other consumers des-
perate to stay afloat. 
Additionally, let’s not forget that 
during the last election, Nebraska 
joined 45 States and the District of Co-
lumbia that have already passed legis-
lation to limit usury rates for small- 
dollar installment loans. 
The Trump-era True Lender Rule is a 
backdoor way for nonbanks to charge 
triple-digit interest rates on loans at 
the expense of consumers in States 
where voters turned out to pass inter-
est rate cap laws. 
No wonder some called this the ‘‘fake 
lender’’ rule. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. And for 
those who did not understand what we 
were talking about when we talked 
about the True Lender Rule, I think I 
have laid it out in such a way that you 
understand this is predatory. This is a 
rip-off. And for these reasons, I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to this resolution. 
Earlier this week, President Biden 
met with financial regulators. From 
the four-sentence recap released by the 
White House, we know one of the topics 
they discussed was ‘‘promoting finan-
cial inclusion and responsibly increas-
ing access to credit.’’ 
I agree with that concept, and I 
think we should all agree with that 
concept. Unfortunately, my Democrat 
colleagues here in the House and the 
Senate don’t seem to be on the same 
page with the Biden administration. 
This resolution we are considering 
today would actually make financial 
services more expensive and credit less 
available to consumers and to small 
businesses and families across the 
country. 
So why are my Democrat colleagues 
strong-arming this resolution through 
Congress? 
Well, the answer is pretty simple. It 
is politics. That is what it is. Let’s call 
this what it is. It is blue States and 
their leftwing, so-called consumer pro-
tection advocates who want to, again, 
limit the reach of national banks and 
partnerships under the guise of ‘‘con-
sumer protection.’’ 
Democrats are more interested in 
scoring political points with leftwing 
activists than supporting the bor-
rowers and small businesses that this 
OCC True Lender Rule helps. 
b 1330 
We have witnessed Democrats work 
for decades to limit the scope of na-
tional banks through one measure or 
another. 
The National Bank Act was signed 
into law in 1864. We have national 
banks. We have had national banks for 
157 years in this country similar to 
today. What they are striking at is op-
position to what we have lived with for 
over 157 years of well-regulated na-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3101 
June 24, 2021 
The left, my colleagues on the oppo-
site side of the aisle, will provide mis-
leading statements about interest rates 
and spurious arguments about State 
versus Federal regulation. They will 
argue consumers are harmed and this 
so-called partisan rule that they are 
driving invites bad banking practices. 
Above all else, my colleagues across 
the aisle see this as an opportunity to 
rebuke the last administration, simply 
because they don’t like the former 
President. I understand that. There is 
plenty of debate about that. But we 
should not tinker with existing law 
that is longstanding and predates this 
President or any other President. We 
should be talking about the contents of 
that law. 
I would like to remind my friends as 
well that it was the Obama administra-
tion who supported the risk-manage-
ment principles underlying the true 
lender rule. It was an effort to regu-
late, to ensure that instead of having 
shadow banking provide these services, 
that you have well-regulated consumer 
protection laws at the Federal level as 
a part of this process. 
So once again, we have the oppor-
tunity to come together to support 
good, bipartisan policy, rather than 
doing what the Democrats would rath-
er do, which is appease the woke left. 
So let’s stop the political theatrics 
and talk about what the true lender 
rule actually does, not what my Demo-
crat colleagues claim it does. 
The rule specifies that when a bank 
makes a loan, the bank is the true 
lender if, as of the date of origination, 
it is named as the lender in the loan 
agreement or funds the loan. That loan 
would be regulated by the entity mak-
ing the loan, funding the loan, and the 
regulation would fall upon them. So 
the consumers have Federal consumer 
protection laws that would act on that 
loan. That is what it does. 
My friends that created the Con-
sumer Protection Bureau, I thought 
you wanted that, and yet you are argu-
ing against that with this rule today. 
It is pretty straightforward; it is a 
pretty 
straightforward 
law. 
It 
shouldn’t be political. 
This rule also clarifies that as the 
true lender of a loan, a bank holds the 
responsibility of complying with Fed-
eral law. This eliminates the greatest 
risk associated with abuse of rent-a- 
charter schemes, which we agree are 
bad, and I think we could be doing 
something about that rather than this 
spurious argument we have today. 
In October of last year, the OCC fi-
nalized the true lender rule that is 
being debated today. This was a second 
step in a decades-long process to clar-
ify the bank-third-party relationship 
when issuing a loan. It has been long-
standing practice, but there have been 
lawsuits, a great deal of uncertainty 
about it, a lot of questions in par-
ticular jurisdictions around the coun-
try on the nature of those partnerships, 
and it clarifies those partnerships in a 
rules-based regime. 
This legal clarity enables bank and 
fintech partnerships to provide their 
customers with the financial products 
they want and need. 
Consider this: According to the New 
York Federal Reserve, one in four Afri-
can-American-owned 
firms 
used 
fintechs to access PPP loans, one in 
four. And they did so using this legal 
doctrine that enabled that to happen in 
partnerships with national banks. 
Technology helps create greater fi-
nancial inclusion. So why are my Dem-
ocrat colleagues so afraid of tech-
nology, so afraid of innovation? 
Per usual, my Democrat colleagues 
are willing to ignore facts in favor of 
myths that back up their preferred 
narrative. That is unfortunate, espe-
cially for something this important. 
The left likes to say that banks can 
charge whatever interest rate they 
want. That is simply not true. Federal 
law gives national banks and Federal 
savings associations the same author-
ity that State banks have regarding ex-
portation of interest rates. 
Now, both Federal- and State-char-
tered banks must conform to applica-
ble interest rate limits in those States. 
States retain the authority to set in-
terest rates, which varies from State to 
State. 
Here is another myth: Third-party 
bank partnerships will use this rule to 
skirt State supervision and usury laws. 
Simply not true. 
The truth is, banks primarily partner 
with third parties to reach additional 
markets, benefiting from a particular 
expertise or technology to improve 
their 
efficiency. 
Partnerships 
with 
third parties do not change the bank’s 
authority or expose interest rate dif-
ferentials. 
And last, but not least, progressive 
activists cite the interest rate as a real 
problem with the true lender rule. 
They are pushing a 36 percent best rate 
cap. They have even pushed it at the 
national 
level. 
The 
math 
simply 
doesn’t back up this falsehood. 
The true lender rule was not some 
sinister plan by the previous adminis-
tration to trick borrowers. It was not. 
It simply was not the case. This legal 
principle was established in 1864 with 
the National Bank Act. It is being un-
dermined by an attempt at politics 
rather than sound policy, and what we 
should support is good, bipartisan pol-
icy that provides clarity to banks and 
fintechs so they can better serve our 
constituents and the consumers of 
America. That is it. 
We have a well-regulated banking 
system. We do. It is not perfect. We 
have States that have various laws 
that are operable in their States, but 
we also have a national system here as 
well. 
We have worked harmoniously, not 
perfectly, over the last 157 years since 
we established the national banking 
system. But why undermine a key prin-
ciple of that national banking system 
by spurious arguments that actually 
don’t have to do with the true lender 
rule? They don’t. There are other ele-
ments that the left opposes that actu-
ally, on a bipartisan basis, we oppose, 
but the true lender rule is not it. 
It is a question of whether or not the 
bank that is providing you the loan is, 
in fact, the true lender. That is it. It is 
not fancier than that, people. That is 
what it is. That is what we are arguing 
about today, and that is kind of the ab-
surdity of this stuff that we are debat-
ing right now, because it is that sim-
ple. 
So let’s promote financial inclusion 
the way that the President outlined, 
which was promoting financial inclu-
sion, making rates more competitive 
and the cost of credit cheaper for indi-
viduals. Let’s do that. Let’s oppose this 
resolution before us so we can have 
sound principles, so we can drive that 
inclusion that is necessary and very 
important. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for her leader-
ship in bringing this important legisla-
tion, more than one piece of legisla-
tion, to the floor today. 
As I rise to speak in support of re-
versing the anti-consumer fake lender 
rule pushed through in the final weeks 
of the previous administration, I just 
want to take a moment to put it in 
perspective. 
Madam Speaker, in November, the 
people elected Democratic majorities 
in the Congress that would be for the 
people, fighting for the public inter-
ests, not the special interests. 
To that end, they elected majorities 
that would reverse the damage in-
flicted on their health and financial se-
curity by the last administration. 
That mission is why the House this 
week is passing legislation under the 
Congressional Review Act to reverse 
three of the past President’s most egre-
gious assaults on families’ well-being. 
The Congressional Review Act is one 
of Congress’ most important tools to 
reassert the power of the people’s 
House to deliver for the people and to 
reclaim our authority under the Con-
stitution, upholding the balance of 
powers that is the foundation of our 
American democracy. 
With the gentlewoman’s permission, 
I wish to speak to the anti-consumer 
fake lender rule, but also speak to two 
other issues under the Congressional 
Review Act this afternoon. 
On the floor today is legislation, 
again, to reverse the anti-consumer 
fake lender rule pushed through in the 
final weeks of the previous administra-
tion. 
This fake lender rule greenlights 
rent-a-bank schemes in which preda-
tory lenders evade bank interest rate 
limits 
to 
swindle 
vulnerable 
con-
sumers. This is done by putting a bank

name on loan paperwork and claiming 
that the bank, not the predatory lend-
er, issued the loan. 
To take one example, in California, 
where the interest rate on a 2-year 
$2,000 loan is capped at 25 percent, lend-
ers can use rent-a-bank partnerships to 
make loans with rates up to 225 per-
cent. 
This bipartisan resolution to end the 
fake lender rule is supported by many: 
a bipartisan coalition of 25 State attor-
neys general; faith leaders, including 
the National Latino Evangelical Coali-
tion, 
the 
National 
Association 
of 
Evangelicals, 
the 
National 
Baptist 
Convention USA, hundreds of banking 
law and consumer finance regulation 
scholars, and Americans across the 
country and across parties, urging us 
to support this Congressional Review 
Act reversal of the anti-consumer fake 
lender rule. 
Also today, we are considering legis-
lation to undo the antiworker, pro-dis-
crimination rule forced through in the 
final week of the past administration. 
The EEOC was established to protect 
working people from discrimination 
and ensure that discrimination charges 
are resolved fairly. But this rule would 
impose draconian new obligations that 
bias the conciliation process against 
employees, toward employers; escalate 
the potential for retaliation, because 
retaliation claims make up half of 
EEOC’s charges filed at the EEOC last 
year; siphon off scarce EEOC resources 
and saddle the EEOC with wasteful col-
lateral litigation, prolonging harm to 
workers 
through 
delays; 
and 
con-
travene both the Supreme Court prece-
dent and Congressional intent. 
This month, civil rights and workers’ 
rights organizations wrote to Congress 
in support of S.J. Res. 13, writing: ‘‘The 
EEOC must be able to conduct its work 
efficiently . . . to prevent and remedy 
workplace discrimination. 
‘‘This mission is even more critical 
in the middle of a global pandemic that 
continues to have severe economic re-
percussions for women, people of color, 
and other marginalized communities. 
‘‘The final rule will only deepen the 
barriers working people face coming 
forward to report discrimination and 
obtain justice.’’ 
This Congressional Review Act legis-
lation passed the Senate. Hopefully, it 
will pass the House today. 
Finally, tomorrow we take up bipar-
tisan legislation that paves the way to 
restore 
the 
Obama-era 
protections 
against harmful methane pollution, 
which the most recent past President 
rolled back. 
Briefly, these safeguards are key pro-
tections for public health that will also 
make a serious difference in combating 
the climate crisis. Methane is respon-
sible for at least one-quarter of the 
warming of the planet. And it is 25 
times more potent than carbon dioxide 
in trapping heat in the atmosphere. 
This resolution passed on a bipar-
tisan basis in the Senate and in the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. It 
builds on the commitment of the Presi-
dent and the Democratic Congress to 
tackle the climate crisis. 
As the administration has stated, ad-
dressing methane pollution is an ur-
gent and essential step. 
Madam Speaker, with that, as Speak-
er, I am proud to be able to use the 
Speaker’s prerogative to speak beyond 
the item on the floor right now. 
I am proud to support these impor-
tant actions to reverse the Trump dam-
age and to deliver results that make a 
difference in the lives of hardworking 
American families. 
I thank all of our leaders for this leg-
islation for the people: Chair BOBBY 
SCOTT
and Representative SUZANNE 
BONAMICI on the EEOC resolution; Rep-
resentative CHUy Garcia for his work 
on the true lender resolution; Rep-
resentative DIANA DEGETTE and Chair-
man FRANK PALLONE, and many others, 
on the methane resolution from the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
I urge strong votes for S.J. Res. 13, 
14, and 15. 
Coming back to the resolution on the 
floor right now, I thank the distin-
guished chair of the Financial Services 
Committee for her leadership in look-
ing out always for the consumer, for 
competition, for fairness, for the peo-
ple. 
b 1345 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER), who is 
the ranking member on the Consumer 
Protection and Financial Institutions 
Subcommittee of the Financial Serv-
ices Committee, and also the ranking 
member on the Small Business Com-
mittee. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to discuss S.J. Res. 15, 
House Democrats’ attempt to limit the 
ability of our Nation’s banks to serve 
consumers by overturning the true 
lender rule. 
The true lender rule was finalized by 
the OCC in 2020, in an effort to clarify 
who was the true lender in national 
bank third-party relationships. By pro-
viding this clarity, these third-party 
entities were able to provide financial 
services in partnership with financial 
institutions with the protections of 
legal precedence. 
Partnering with third parties like 
fintechs gives financial institutions the 
ability to increase access to credit, es-
pecially for low- and moderate-income 
consumers and small businesses. 
Unfortunately, the bill before us is 
nothing more than a politically moti-
vated attempt by Democrats to make 
it more expensive and difficult for 
banks to serve customers, and its pas-
sage will have long-term consequences. 
According to the Congressional Re-
view Act, if this legislation is passed, 
the OCC will not have the ability to 
issue a similar rule down the road. This 
will leave bank-fintech partnerships in 
limbo with a great deal of uncertainty 
regarding the loans they make and who 
is the true lender in the relationship. 
Democrats are constantly putting 
their 
disdain 
for 
America’s 
banks 
ahead of the needs of their constitu-
ents, and this bill is another prime ex-
ample of this unfortunate practice. 
I firmly oppose this bill and its pre-
vention of widespread financial inclu-
sion, especially for low- and moderate- 
income consumers. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A), who is also the 
sponsor of the House companion to this 
legislation. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of S.J. 
Res. 15, a resolution to repeal the 
OCC’s so-called true lender rule. 
Earlier this year, my State, Illinois, 
passed a law that protects our con-
sumers from predatory, high-interest 
loans. Eighteen other States have done 
the same. 
I introduced the House version of this 
resolution because the true lender rule 
undermines laws like ours, laws that 
keep working-class people out of cycles 
of debt they can’t pay back. 
The rule is a rubber stamp for rent-a- 
bank schemes, where a lender can 
dodge State law by having a bank’s 
name on the loan paperwork. That is 
all. No skin in the game, no investment 
in our communities; just a name on the 
paperwork. 
This rule doesn’t encourage innova-
tion. It encourages playing games. This 
isn’t a partisan issue. As a matter of 
fact, last year, 82 percent of Nebraska 
voters joined States like Arkansas and 
South Dakota to protect their commu-
nities from unpayable debt, and this 
rule from the OCC provides bad actors 
with a new tool to ignore them. 
So a broad coalition of over 400 orga-
nizations—rural, 
urban, 
suburban— 
have come together in support of this 
measure, and they include consumer 
advocates, labor advocates, veterans, 
credit unions, and many other actors, 
including evangelical congregations. 
Madam Speaker, I urge this body to 
pass 
this 
resolution 
and 
empower 
working-class communities like mine 
that are targeted by predatory lenders, 
and voters across the country who sup-
port consumer protections. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I would reference 
my colleagues the Federal Code, the 
Federal Register, that actually has the 
contents of this rule. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the actual rule that we are de-
bating here, and I would highlight one 
piece in particular. 
‘‘The OCC agrees that rent-a-charter 
schemes have no place in the Federal 
financial system but disagrees that 
this rule facilitates such schemes. As 
noted above, instead, this proposal 
would help solve the problem by (1) 
providing a clear and simple test for 
determining when a bank makes a loan

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
12 CFR Part 7 
[Docket ID OCC–2020–0026] 
RIN 1557–AE97 
National Banks and Federal Savings Asso-
ciations as Lenders 
AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, Treasury. 
ACTION: Final rule. 
SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency (OCC) is issuing this final 
rule to determine when a national bank or 
Federal savings association (bank) makes a 
loan and is the ‘‘true lender,’’ including in 
the context of a partnership between a bank 
and a third party, such as a marketplace 
lender. Under this rule, a bank makes a loan 
if, as of the date of origination, it is named 
as the lender in the loan agreement or funds 
the loan. 
DATES: The final rule is effective on De-
cember 29, 2020. 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
I. Background 
Lending partnerships between national 
banks 
or 
Federal 
savings 
associations 
(banks) and third parties play a critical role 
in our financial system. These partnerships 
expand access to credit and provide an ave-
nue for banks to remain competitive as the 
financial sector evolves. Through these part-
nerships, banks often leverage technology 
developed by innovative third parties that 
helps to reach a wider array of customers. 
However, there is often uncertainty about 
how to determine which entity is making the 
loans and, therefore, the laws that apply to 
these loans. This uncertainty may discour-
age banks from entering into lending part-
nerships, which, in turn, may limit competi-
tion, restrict access to affordable credit, and 
chill the innovation that can result from 
these 
relationships. 
Through 
this 
rule-
making, the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency (OCC) is providing the legal cer-
tainty necessary for banks to partner con-
fidently with other market participants and 
meet the credit needs of their customers. 
However, the OCC understands that there 
is concern that its rulemaking facilitates in-
appropriate 
‘rent-a-charter’ 
lending 
schemes—arrangements in which a bank re-
ceives a fee to ‘rent’ its charter and unique 
legal status to a third party. These schemes 
are designed to enable the third party to 
evade state and local laws, including some 
state consumer protection laws, and to allow 
the bank to disclaim any compliance respon-
sibility for the loans. These arrangements 
have absolutely no place in the federal bank-
ing system and are addressed by this rule-
making, which holds banks accountable for 
all loans they make, including those made in 
the context of marketplace lending partner-
ships or other loan sale arrangements. 
On July 22, 2020, the OCC published a no-
tice of proposed rulemaking (proposal or 
NPR) to determine when a bank makes a 
loan. Under the proposal, a bank made a loan 
if, as of the date of origination, it (1) was 
named as the lender in the loan agreement 
or (2) funded the loan. 
As the proposal explained, federal law au-
thorizes banks to enter into contracts, to 
make loans, and to subsequently transfer 
these loans and assign the loan contracts. 
The statutory framework, however, does not 
specifically address which entity makes a 
loan when the loan is originated as part of a 
lending partnership involving a bank and a 
third party, nor has the OCC taken regu-
latory action to resolve this ambiguity. In 
the absence of regulatory action, a growing 
body of case law has introduced divergent 
standards for resolving this issue, as dis-
cussed below. As a result of this legal uncer-
tainty, stakeholders cannot reliably deter-
mine the applicability of key laws, including 
the law governing the permissible interest 
that may be charged on the loan. 
This final rule establishes a clear test for 
determining when a bank makes a loan, by 
interpreting the statutes that grant banks 
their authority to lend. Specifically, the 
final rule provides that a bank makes a loan 
when it, as of the date of origination, (1) is 
named as the lender in the loan agreement 
or (2) funds the loan. 
II. Overview of Comments 
The OCC received approximately 4,000 com-
ments on the proposal, the vast majority of 
which were from individuals using a version 
of one of three short form letters to express 
opposition to the proposal. Other com-
menters included banks, nonbank lenders, 
industry 
trade 
associations, 
community 
groups, academics, state government rep-
resentatives, and members of Congress. 
Commenters supporting the proposal stat-
ed that the judicial true lender doctrine has 
led to divergent standards and uncertainty 
concerning the legitimacy of lending part-
nerships between banks and third parties. 
They also stated that, by removing the un-
certainty, the OCC would help ensure that 
banks have the confidence to enter into 
these lending relationships, which provide 
affordable credit to consumers on more fa-
vorable terms than the alternatives, such as 
pawn shops or payday lenders, to which un-
derserved communities often turn. Sup-
porting commenters also observed that the 
proposal would enhance a bank’s safety and 
soundness by facilitating its ability to sell 
loans. These commenters also noted that the 
proposal (1) makes clear that the OCC will 
hold banks accountable for products with un-
fair, deceptive, abusive, or misleading fea-
tures that are offered as part of a relation-
ship and (2) is consistent with the OCC’s 
statutory mission to ensure that banks pro-
vide fair access to financial services. 
Commenters opposing the proposal stated 
that it would facilitate so-called rent-a-char-
ter schemes, which would result in increased 
predatory lending and disproportionately 
impact marginalized communities. Other op-
posing commenters stated that the proposal 
is an attempt by the OCC to improperly reg-
ulate nonbank lenders, a role they consider 
to be reserved exclusively to the states. Op-
posing commenters also asserted that the 
OCC did not have sufficient legal authority 
to issue the proposal and that the proposal 
violated the Administrative Procedure Act 
(APA) and 12 U.S.C. 25b. 
Both supporting and opposing commenters 
recommended changes. These recommenda-
tions included (1) adopting a test that re-
quires the true lender to have a predominant 
economic interest in the loan; (2) providing 
additional ‘‘safe harbor’’ requirements to en-
hance consumer protections (e.g., interest 
rate caps); (3) clarifying that certain tradi-
tional bank lending activities do not fall 
under the funding prong of the rule (e.g., in-
direct auto lending and mortgage warehouse 
lending); (4) providing additional details on 
how the OCC would supervise these relation-
ships; and (5) stating that the rule will not 
displace certain federal consumer protection 
laws and regulations. 
The comments are addressed in greater de-
tail below. 
III. Analysis 
As noted in the prior section, commenters 
raised a variety of issues for the OCC’s con-
sideration. These are discussed below. 
A. OCC’s Authority To Issue the Rule 
Some commenters argued the OCC lacks 
the legal authority to issue the rule because 
it would contravene the unambiguous mean-
ing of 12 U.S.C. 85. These commenters believe 
that section 85 incorporates the common law 
of usury as of 1864, which they view as re-
quiring courts to look to the substance rath-
er than the form of a transaction. In a simi-
lar vein, commenters argued that section 85 
incorporates all usury laws of a state, in-
cluding its true lender jurisprudence. One 
commenter also argued that the proposal 
contradicts 
judicial 
and 
administrative 
precedent interpreting sections 85 and 86. 
The OCC disagrees. The rule interprets 
statutes that authorize banks to lend—12 
U.S.C. 24, 371, and 1464(c)—and clarifies how 
to determine when a bank exercises this 
lending authority. The OCC has clear author-
ity to reasonably interpret these statutes, 
which do not specifically address when a 
bank makes a loan. 
Banks do not obtain their lending author-
ity from section 85 or 12 U.S.C. 1463(g). Nor 
are these statutes the authority the OCC is 
relying on to issue this rule. The proposal 
referenced sections 85 and 1463(g) in the regu-
latory text to ensure that interested parties 
understand the consequences of its interpre-
tation of sections 24, 371, and 1464(c), includ-
ing that this rulemaking operates together 
with the OCC’s recently finalized ‘Madden- 
fix’ rulemaking. When a bank makes a loan 
pursuant to the test established in this regu-
lation, the bank may subsequently sell, as-
sign, or otherwise transfer the loan without 
affecting the permissible interest term, 
which is determined by reference to state 
law. 
Other commenters questioned the OCC’s 
authority on different grounds. Some as-
serted the OCC lacks authority to (1) exempt 
nonbanks from compliance with state law or 
(2) preempt state laws that determine wheth-
er a loan is made by a nonbank lender. One 
commenter also asserted that the proposal is 
an attempt by the OCC to interpret state 
law. A commenter further argued that the 
OCC’s statutory interpretation is not reason-
able, including because the proposal (1) 
would allow nonbanks to enjoy the benefits 
of federal preemption without submitting to 
any regulatory oversight and (2) violates the 
presumption against preemption, especially 
in an area of historical state police powers 
like consumer protection. 
This rulemaking does not assert authority 
over nonbanks, preempt state laws applica-
ble to nonbank lenders, or interpret state 
law. It interprets federal banking law and 
has no direct applicability to any nonbank 
entity or activity. Rather, in identifying the 
true lender, the rule pinpoints key elements 
of the statutory, regulatory, and supervisory 
framework applicable to the loan in ques-
tion. As noted in the proposal, if a nonbank 
partner is the true lender, the relevant state 
(and not OCC) would regulate the lending ac-
tivity, and the OCC would assess the bank’s 
third-party risk management in connection 
with the relationship itself. 
Furthermore, 
because 
commenters 
ex-
pressed concern that this rule would under-
mine state usury caps, it is also important 
to emphasize that sections 85 and 1463(g) pro-
vide a choice of law framework for deter-
mining which state’s law applies to bank 
loans and, in this way, incorporate, rather 
than eliminate, state law. These statutes re-
quire that a bank refer to, and comply with, 
the usury cap established by the laws of the 
state where the bank is located. Thus, dis-
parities between the usury caps applicable to

June 24, 2021 
particular bank loans result primarily from 
differences in the state laws that impose 
these caps, not from an interpretation that 
section 85 or 1463(g) preempt state law. 
A commenter also asserted that the OCC’s 
interpretation is not reasonable because it 
(1) does not solve the problem it claims to 
remedy, arguing that the proposal itself is 
unclear and requires banks to undertake a 
fact-specific analysis and (2) departs from 
federal cases holding that state true lender 
law applies to lending relationships between 
banks and nonbanks. 
The OCC believes that this rule provides a 
simple, bright-line test to determine when a 
bank has made a loan and, therefore, is the 
true lender in a lending relationship. The 
only required factual analysis is whether the 
bank is named as the lender or funds the 
loan. The OCC has evaluated various stand-
ards established by courts and has deter-
mined that a clear, predictable, and easily 
administrable test is preferable. This test 
will provide legal certainty, and the OCC’s 
robust supervisory framework effectively 
targets predatory lending, achieving the 
same goal as a more complex true lender 
test. 
Several commenters also asserted that the 
proposal contravenes 12 U.S.C. 1, which 
charges the OCC with ensuring that banks 
treat customers fairly. One commenter also 
argued that the proposal is inconsistent with 
the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) be-
cause it encourages predatory lending. As 
the OCC explained in the proposal, the rule’s 
purpose is to provide legal certainty to ex-
pand access to credit, a goal that is entirely 
consistent 
with 
the 
agency’s 
statutory 
charge to ensure fair treatment of customers 
and banks’ statutory obligation to serve the 
convenience and needs of their communities. 
B. 12 U.S.C. 25b 
Several commenters asserted that the 
agency should have complied with 12 U.S.C. 
25b, which applies when the OCC issues a reg-
ulation or order that preempts a state con-
sumer financial law. Some of these com-
menters argued that the proposal fails to 
meet the preemption standard articulated in 
Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nel-
son, Florida Insurance Commissioner, et al. 
(Barnett), as incorporated into section 25b. 
Commenters also argued that (1) section 
25b(f) does not exempt the OCC’s proposal 
from the requirements of section 25b because 
the rule is not limited to banks charging in-
terest and (2) the proposal undermines or 
contravenes section 25b(h) because it extends 
preemptive treatment to subsidiaries, affili-
ates, and agents of banks. 
The OCC disagrees: The requirements of 
section 25b are inapplicable to this rule-
making. Section 25b applies when the Comp-
troller determines, on a case-by-case basis, 
that a state consumer financial law is pre-
empted pursuant to the standard for conflict 
preemption established by the Supreme 
Court in Barnett, i.e., when the Comptroller 
makes a preemption determination. This 
rulemaking does not preempt a state con-
sumer financial law but rather interprets a 
bank’s federal authority to lend. Further-
more, commenters arguing that section 
25b(f) (which addresses section 85) does not 
exempt this rulemaking from the procedures 
in section 25b and that sections 25b(b)(2), (e), 
and (h)(2) (which address bank subsidiaries, 
affiliates, and agents) preclude the agency 
from issuing this rule are mistaken; this 
rulemaking is not an interpretation of sec-
tion 85, nor does it address the applicability 
of state law to bank subsidiaries, affiliates, 
or agents. 
C. Administrative Procedure Act 
Several commenters asserted that, for var-
ious reasons, the proposal is arbitrary and 
capricious and, therefore, in violation of the 
APA. Some commenters argued that the pro-
posal lacks an evidentiary basis, either en-
tirely or with respect to certain assertions, 
such as the existence of legal uncertainty. 
The OCC disagrees. The APA’s arbitrary and 
capricious standard requires an agency to 
make rational and informed decisions based 
on the information before it. Furthermore, 
the standard does not require the OCC to de-
velop or cite empirical or other data to sup-
port its rule or wait for problems to mate-
rialize before acting. Instead, the OCC may 
rely on its expertise to address the problems 
that may arise. 
The OCC has decided to issue this rule to 
resolve the effects of legal uncertainty on 
banks and their third-party relationships. In 
this case, the OCC’s views are informed by 
courts’ divergent true lender tests and the 
resulting lack of predictability faced by 
stakeholders. While the OCC understands its 
rule may not resolve all legal uncertainty 
for every loan, this is not a prerequisite for 
the agency to take this narrowly tailored ac-
tion. Taking these considerations into ac-
count, the OCC has made a rational and in-
formed decision to issue this rule. 
Commenters also argued that the OCC’s ac-
tions violate the APA because the agency 
has not given notice of its intention to re-
verse an existing policy or provided the fac-
tual, legal, and policy reasons for doing so. 
Specifically, these commenters referenced 
the OCC’s longstanding policy prohibiting 
banks from entering into rent-a-charter 
schemes. This rulemaking does not reverse 
the OCC’s position. The OCC’s longstanding 
and unwavering opposition to predatory 
lending, including but not limited to preda-
tory lending as part of a third-party rela-
tionship, remains intact and strong. In fact, 
this rulemaking would solve the rent-a-char-
ter issues raised and ensure that banks do 
not participate in those arrangements. As 
noted in the proposal, the OCC’s statutes and 
regulations, enforceable guidelines, guid-
ance, and enforcement authority provide ro-
bust and effective safeguards against preda-
tory lending when a bank exercises its lend-
ing authority. This rule does not alter this 
framework but rather reinforces its impor-
tance by clarifying that it applies to every 
loan a bank makes and by providing a simple 
test to identify precisely when a bank has 
made a loan. If a bank fails to satisfy its 
compliance obligations, the OCC will not 
hesitate to use its enforcement authority 
consistent with its longstanding policy and 
practice. 
Furthermore, the final rule does not 
change the OCC’s expectation that all banks 
establish and maintain prudent credit under-
writing practices and comply with applicable 
law, even when they partner with third par-
ties. These expectations were in place before 
the OCC issued its proposal and will remain 
in place after the final rule takes effect. For 
these reasons, the final rule does not rep-
resent a change in OCC policy. 
D. Comments on the Proposed Regulatory 
Text 
As noted previously, the OCC’s proposed 
regulatory text set out a test for deter-
mining when a bank has made a loan for pur-
poses of 12 U.S.C. 24, 85, 371, 1463(g), and 
1464(c). Under this test, a bank made a loan 
if, as of the date of origination, it was named 
as the lender in the loan agreement or fund-
ed the loan. 
Some commenters supported the rule with-
out change, stating that the proposal pro-
vided the clarity needed to determine which 
entity is the true lender in a lending rela-
tionship. Other commenters supported the 
proposal as a general matter but suggested 
specific changes, including clarifying that 
the funding prong does not include certain 
lending or financing arrangements such as 
warehouse lending, indirect auto lending 
(through bank purchases of retail install-
ment contracts (RICs)), loan syndication, 
and other structured finance. 
These commenters are correct that the 
funding prong of the proposal generally does 
not include these types of arrangements: 
They do not involve a bank funding a loan at 
the time of origination. For example, when a 
bank purchases a RIC from an auto dealer, as 
is often the case with indirect auto lending, 
the bank does not ‘‘fund’’ the loan. When a 
bank provides a warehouse loan to a third 
party that subsequently draws on that ware-
house loan to lend to other borrowers, the 
bank is not funding the loans to these other 
borrowers. In contrast, and as noted in the 
proposal, the bank is the true lender in a 
table funding arrangement when the bank 
funds the loan at origination. 
Another commenter recommended that the 
OCC consider the ‘‘safe harbor’’ established 
in the recent settlement between the Colo-
rado Attorney General and several financial 
institutions and fintech lenders. While we 
are aware of this settlement, the OCC be-
lieves that our approach achieves the goal of 
legal certainty while providing the necessary 
safeguards. 
One commenter requested that the OCC ex-
pressly state in the final rule that the rule-
making is not intended to displace or alter 
other regulatory regimes, including those 
that address consumer protection. Another 
commenter requested that the OCC clarify 
how account information in true lender ar-
rangements should be reported to consumer 
reporting agencies under the Fair Credit Re-
porting Act. As the preamble to the proposal 
noted, the OCC’s rule does not affect the ap-
plication of any federal consumer financial 
laws, including, but not limited to, the 
meaning of the terms (1) ‘‘creditor’’ in the 
Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) 
and Regulation Z (12 CFR part 1026) and (2) 
‘‘lender’’ in Regulation X (12 CFR part 1024), 
which implements the Real Estate Settle-
ment Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2601 et 
seq.). Similarly, the OCC’s rule does not af-
fect the applicability of the Home Mortgage 
Disclosure Act (12 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.), the 
Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691 
et seq.), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 
U.S.C. 1681 et seq.), or their implementing 
regulations (Regulation C (12 CFR part 1003), 
Regulation B (12 CFR part 1002), and Regula-
tion V (12 CFR part 1022)), respectively. The 
OCC recommends that commenters direct 
questions regarding these statutes and regu-
lations to the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau. 
Some commenters stated that the two 
prongs in the proposal’s test would produce 
contradictory and absurd results. For exam-
ple, several commenters noted that, under 
the proposal, two banks could be the true 
lender (e.g., at origination, one bank is 
named as the lender on the loan agreement 
and another bank funds the loan). In re-
sponse to this comment, we have amended 
the regulatory text to provide that where 
one bank is named as the lender in the loan 
agreement and another bank funds the loan, 
the bank named as the lender in the loan 
agreement makes the loan. This approach 
will provide additional clarity and allow 
stakeholders, including borrowers, to easily 
identify the bank that makes the loan. Oth-
erwise, the OCC adopts the regulatory text 
as proposed. 
E. Rent-a-Charter Concerns; Supervisory Ex-
pectations 
The OCC received multiple comments ex-
pressing concern that the proposal would fa-
cilitate 
rent-a-charter 
relationships 
and

thereby enable nonbank lenders to engage in 
predatory or otherwise abusive lending prac-
tices. 
These 
commenters 
noted 
that 
nonbanks are generally not subject to the 
type of prudential supervision that applies to 
banks and that usury caps are the most ef-
fective method to curb predatory lending by 
nonbanks. They argued that the OCC’s rule 
would effectively nullify these caps and fa-
cilitate the expansion of predatory lending. 
As explained above, in a rent-a-charter ar-
rangement, a lender receives a fee to rent 
out its charter and unique legal status to 
originate loans on behalf of a third party, en-
abling the third party to evade state and 
local laws, such as usury caps and other con-
sumer protection laws. At the same time, 
the lender disclaims any responsibility for 
these loans. As a result of these arrange-
ments, consumers can find themselves in 
debt to an unscrupulous nonbank lender that 
is subject to very little or no prudential su-
pervision on a loan at an interest rate gross-
ly in excess of the state usury cap. 
The 
OCC 
agrees 
that 
rent-a-charter 
schemes have no place in the federal finan-
cial system but disagrees that this rule fa-
cilitates such schemes. As noted above, in-
stead, this proposal would help solve the 
problem by (1) providing a clear and simple 
test for determining when a bank makes a 
loan and (2) emphasizing the robust super-
visory framework that applies to any loan 
made by a bank and to all third-party rela-
tionships to which banks are a party. As 
noted above, if a bank fails to satisfy its ob-
ligations under this supervisory framework, 
the OCC will use all the tools at its disposal, 
including its enforcement authority. 
Although the proposal discussed this su-
pervisory framework in detail, it bears re-
peating because of its importance to this 
rulemaking. Every bank is responsible for es-
tablishing and maintaining prudent credit 
underwriting practices that: (1) Are commen-
surate with the types of loans the bank will 
make and consider the terms and conditions 
under which they will be made; (2) consider 
the nature of the markets in which the loans 
will be made; (3) provide for consideration, 
prior to credit commitment, of the bor-
rower’s overall financial condition and re-
sources, the financial responsibility of any 
guarantor, the nature and value of any un-
derlying collateral, and the borrower’s char-
acter and willingness to repay as agreed; (4) 
establish a system of independent, ongoing 
credit review and appropriate communica-
tion to management and to the board of di-
rectors; (5) take adequate account of con-
centration of credit risk; and (6) are appro-
priate to the size of the institution and the 
nature and scope of its activities. Moreover, 
every bank is expected to have loan docu-
mentation practices that: (1) Enable the in-
stitution to make an informed lending deci-
sion and assess risk, as necessary, on an on-
going basis; (2) identify the purpose of a loan 
and the source of repayment and assess the 
ability of the borrower to repay the indebt-
edness in a timely manner; (3) ensure that 
any claim against a borrower is legally en-
forceable; (4) demonstrate appropriate ad-
ministration and monitoring of a loan; and 
(5) take account of the size and complexity 
of a loan. Every bank should also have ap-
propriate internal controls and information 
systems to assess and manage the risks asso-
ciated with its lending activities, including 
those that provide for monitoring adherence 
to established policies and compliance with 
applicable laws and regulations, as well as 
internal audit systems. 
In addition, a bank’s lending must comply 
with all applicable laws and regulations, in-
cluding federal consumer protection laws. 
For example, section 5 of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act (FTC Act) provides that 
‘‘unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or 
affecting 
commerce’’ 
are 
unlawful. 
The 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-
sumer Protection Act also prohibits unfair, 
deceptive, or ‘‘abusive’’ acts or practices. 
The OCC has taken a number of public en-
forcement actions against banks for vio-
lating section 5 of the FTC Act and will con-
tinue to exercise its enforcement authority 
to address unlawful actions. 
Banks also are subject to federal fair lend-
ing laws and may not engage in unlawful dis-
crimination, such as ‘‘steering’’ a borrower 
to a higher cost loan on the basis of the bor-
rower’s race, national origin, age, or gender. 
If a bank engages in any unlawful discrimi-
natory practices, the OCC will take appro-
priate action under the federal fair lending 
laws. Further, under the CRA regulations, 
CRA-related lending practices that violate 
federal fair lending laws, the FTC Act, or 
Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, 
or that evidence other discriminatory or ille-
gal credit practices, can adversely affect a 
bank’s CRA performance rating. 
The OCC has also taken significant steps 
to eliminate predatory, unfair, or deceptive 
practices in the federal banking system, rec-
ognizing that ‘‘[s]uch practices are incon-
sistent with important national objectives, 
including the goals of fair access to credit, 
community development, and stable home-
ownership by the broadest spectrum of 
America.’’ To address these concerns, the 
OCC requires banks engaged in lending to 
take into account the borrower’s ability to 
repay the loan according to its terms. In the 
OCC’s experience, ‘‘a departure from funda-
mental principles of loan underwriting gen-
erally forms the basis of abusive lending: 
Lending without a determination that a bor-
rower can reasonably be expected to repay 
the loan from resources other than the col-
lateral securing the loan, and relying instead 
on the foreclosure value of the borrower’s 
collateral to recover principal, interest, and 
fees.’’ 
Additionally, the OCC has cautioned banks 
about lending activities that may be consid-
ered predatory, unfair, or deceptive, noting 
that many such lending practices are unlaw-
ful under existing federal laws and regula-
tions or otherwise present significant safety, 
soundness, or other risks. These practices in-
clude those that target prospective bor-
rowers who cannot afford credit on the terms 
being offered, provide inadequate disclosures 
of the true costs and risks of transactions, 
involve loans with high fees and frequent re-
newals, or constitute loan ‘‘flipping’’ (fre-
quent re-financings that result in little or no 
economic benefit to the borrower that are 
undertaken with the primary or sole objec-
tive of generating additional fees). Policies 
and procedures should also be designed to en-
sure clear and transparent disclosure of the 
terms of the loan, including relative costs, 
risks, and benefits of the loan transaction, 
which helps to mitigate the risk that a 
transaction could be unfair or deceptive. The 
NPR also highlighted specific questions that 
the OCC evaluates as part of its robust su-
pervision of banks’ lending relationships. 
In addition to this framework targeted at 
banks’ lending activities, the OCC has issued 
comprehensive guidance on third-party risk 
management. These standards apply to any 
relationship between a bank and a third 
party, including lending relationships, re-
gardless of which entity is the true lender. 
Pursuant to this guidance, the OCC expects 
banks to institute appropriate safeguards to 
manage the risks associated with their third- 
party relationships. 
Under the final rule, this robust super-
visory framework will continue to apply to 
banks that are the true lender in a lending 
relationship with a third party. Rather than 
allowing banks to enter into rent-a-charter 
schemes, the final rule will ensure that 
banks understand that the OCC will continue 
to hold banks accountable for their lending 
activities. 
IV. Regulatory Analyses 
Paperwork Reduction Act. In accordance 
with the requirements of the Paperwork Re-
duction Act of 1995 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 et 
seq., the OCC may not conduct or sponsor, 
and respondents are not required to respond 
to, an information collection unless it dis-
plays a currently valid Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) control number. The OCC 
has reviewed the final rule and determined 
that it will not introduce any new or revise 
any existing collection of information pursu-
ant to the PRA. Therefore, no submission 
will be made to OMB for review. 
Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Regu-
latory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601 et 
seq., requires an agency, in connection with 
a final rule, to prepare a Final Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis describing the impact of 
the rule on small entities (defined by the 
Small Business Administration (SBA) for 
purposes of the RFA to include commercial 
banks and savings institutions with total as-
sets of $600 million or less and trust compa-
nies with total assets of $41.5 million or less) 
or to certify that the final rule would not 
have a significant economic impact on a sub-
stantial number of small entities. 
The OCC currently supervises approxi-
mately 745 small entities. The OCC expects 
that all of these small entities would be im-
pacted by the rule. While this final rule 
could affect how banks structure their cur-
rent or future third-party relationships as 
well as the amount of loans originated by 
banks, the OCC believes the costs associated 
with any administrative changes in bank 
lending policies and procedures would be de 
minimis. Banks already have systems, poli-
cies, and procedures in place for issuing 
loans when third parties are involved. It 
takes significantly less time to amend exist-
ing policies than to create them, and the 
OCC does not expect any needed adjustments 
will involve an extraordinary demand on a 
bank’s human resources. In addition, any 
costs would likely be absorbed as ongoing ad-
ministrative expenses. Therefore, the OCC 
certifies that this rule will not have a sig-
nificant economic impact on a substantial 
number of small entities. Accordingly, a 
Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not 
required. 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Con-
sistent with the Unfunded Mandates Reform 
Act of 1995 (UMRA), 2 U.S.C. 1532, the OCC 
considers whether a final rule includes a fed-
eral mandate that may result in the expendi-
ture by state, local, and tribal governments, 
in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
$100 million adjusted for inflation (currently 
$157 million) in any one year. The final rule 
does not impose new mandates. Therefore, 
the OCC concludes that implementation of 
the final rule would not result in an expendi-
ture of $157 million or more annually by 
state, local, and tribal governments, or by 
the private sector. 
Riegle Community Development and Regu-
latory Improvement Act. Pursuant to sec-
tion 302(a) of the Riegle Community Devel-
opment and Regulatory Improvement Act of 
1994 (RCDRIA), 12 U.S.C. 4802(a), in deter-
mining the effective date and administrative 
compliance requirements for new regulations 
that impose additional reporting, disclosure, 
or other requirements on insured depository 
institutions, the OCC must consider, con-
sistent with principles of safety and sound-
ness and the public interest, any administra-
tive burdens that such regulations would 
place on depository institutions, including

small depository institutions, and customers 
of depository institutions, as well as the ben-
efits of such regulations. In addition, section 
302(b) of RCDRIA, 12 U.S.C. 4802(b), requires 
new regulations and amendments to regula-
tions that impose additional reporting, dis-
closures, or other new requirements on in-
sured depository institutions generally to 
take effect on the first day of a calendar 
quarter that begins on or after the date on 
which the regulations are published in final 
form. This final rule imposes no additional 
reporting, disclosure, or other requirements 
on 
insured 
depository 
institutions, 
and 
therefore, section 302 is not applicable to 
this rule. 
Congressional Review Act. For purposes of 
the Congressional Review Act (CRA), 5 
U.S.C. 801 et seq., the Office of Information 
and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) of the OMB 
determines whether a final rule is a ‘‘major 
rule,’’ as that term is defined at 5 U.S.C. 
804(2). OIRA has determined that this final 
rule is not a major rule. As required by the 
CRA, the OCC will submit the final rule and 
other appropriate reports to Congress and 
the Government Accountability Office for re-
view. 
Administrative Procedure Act. The APA, 5 
U.S.C. 551 et seq., generally requires that a 
final rule be published in the Federal Reg-
ister not less than 30 days before its effective 
date. This final rule will be effective 60 days 
after publication in the Federal Register, 
which meets the APA’s effective date re-
quirement.

Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, ad-
ditionally, I would highlight for you 
that the outline here and the argu-
ments by my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle really strikes at the 
nature of national banking. 
So just repeal the National Banking 
Act rather than trying to undermine it 
by taking away the legal principle by 
which a bank can make a loan. That is 
what this rule does, and that is the ab-
surdity of this debate. That is why I 
oppose this attempt on the floor today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
LOUDERMILK), my colleague and friend. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my friend and colleague from 
North Carolina for managing the oppo-
sition to this. 
Look, it is simple. The reason we are 
here today is to debate the Democrats’ 
latest episode in their anti-financial 
technology agenda, but also their rush 
to undo any policy of the previous ad-
ministration, whether it was good or 
bad. 
Now, here are the facts: More than 30 
percent of adults are unbanked or 
underbanked, 40 percent do not have 
enough savings to cover a $400 emer-
gency expense, 42 percent have a 
subprime credit score and are rejected 
for bank loans at a rate four times 
higher than those with prime credit. 
Now, fintech has been instrumental 
in expanding access to credit for con-
sumers who have little or no credit his-
tory. Online lending has grown to $90 
billion a year. 
So what do consumers typically use 
these loans to pay for? 
Funerals, weddings, car repairs, and 
home improvement. 
Fintech is particularly important for 
minorities. In fact, fintechs were the 
top PPP lenders to Black-owned busi-
nesses and Hispanic-owned businesses 
during the pandemic. 
But there is an issue that has caused 
difficulty when banks and fintech com-
panies partner to make loans, and that 
is the question of which entity is con-
sidered the true lender. Until recently, 
this question was attempted to be set-
tled in a series of confusing and con-
flicting lawsuits. The courts are di-
vided on it. But, last year, the OCC fi-
nalized a rule to provide much-needed 
certainty. It is no surprise that the or-
ganizations calling for the rule to be 
overturned are the so-called consumer 
groups that, for the most part, are 
funded by trial lawyers. 
The Democrats are attempting to 
overturn this rule because some imagi-
nary lenders could rent a bank charter 
to engage in predatory lending, but as 
the ranking member has just stated, 
that is clearly prohibited in the exist-
ing rule. This resolution is devastating 
to minority consumers and businesses, 
those with subprime credit, and the 
unbanked. 
Instead of giving those people op-
tions, this resolution would direct 
them to payday lenders, or in States 
like Georgia where payday lending is 
illegal, they will have no access to 
credit. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this disastrous resolution. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, we 
know it is expensive to be poor in our 
country; that we live in a country with 
a system that continues to put profit 
before our people, and it must stop. 
In my home State of Michigan, com-
munities that are more than a quarter 
Black and Latino have 50 percent more 
payday lenders than anywhere else in 
the State. These lenders target our 
communities, the most financially vul-
nerable communities. Payday lenders 
in Michigan are 62 percent more com-
mon in low-income Census tracts com-
pared to statewide average. 
That is what folks mean when they 
say that we need to abolish structural 
racism in our country. 
You cannot justify loans of 100 per-
cent APR or higher as providing access 
to credit when they trap borrowers in 
destructive cycles of debt and ruin 
their credit. World Business Lenders 
offered loans of upwards of 268 percent 
of APR, despite the fact that its rent- 
a-bank partner was regulated by the 
OCC. They found a way around the 
rules, and that is unacceptable. 
OCC’s rules leave States like our 
State of Michigan no ability to enforce 
their own State rate caps, giving pred-
atory lenders free rein to exploit our 
neighbors with outrageous APRs. 
Repealing the true lender rule is the 
first step toward protecting borrowers 
from predatory lenders, and I am proud 
to support it. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. MOORE), a great new 
Member of the Congress. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to speak in opposition 
to the CRA before us. 
Innovation in our financial industry 
lifts Americans across all levels of the 
socioeconomic spectrum. A great ex-
ample of this has been the emergence 
of the fintech industry, which has 
helped more Americans access secure, 
affordable credit. 
Unfortunately, government regula-
tion has stymied innovation as regu-
latory uncertainties have imposed arti-
ficial barriers to our creativity. Recent 
court rulings have only exacerbated 
this uncertainty by creating confusion 
about who the true lender of a loan is 
when a bank works with a third party. 
In 2020, the Office of the Comptroller 
sought to clarify this uncertainty by 
finalizing the true lender rule. This 
rule allowed our local community and 
regional banks to provide expanded ac-
cess to banking services and lower the 
cost of banking to consumers across 
the Nation. It is that simple. 
Commonsense 
reforms 
that 
help 
banks and the fintech industry do busi-
ness, in turn, make life easier for fami-
lies, individuals, and businesses. Unfor-
tunately, my Democrat colleagues are 
seeking to roll this rule back. 
Nullifying the rule will decrease 
credit accessibility for underserved 
communities, hurt community banks’ 
ability to utilize new technologies, and 
dissuade innovation in the financial 
services sector.

Madam Speaker, I oppose S.J. Res. 
15, and I encourage my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN), who is also the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Over-
sight and Investigations. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Madam Speaker. Again, I thank the 
chairwoman for the time and the op-
portunity. 
I would say to all, I recall the debate 
around the yield spread premium, 
wherein a loan originator could say to 
a person, ‘‘Here is a loan, you are lucky 
to get it for 10 percent’’ when the per-
son qualified for a loan at 5 percent. 
We eliminated the dastardly yield 
spread premium and the harm that it 
caused. 
We 
have 
a 
similar 
cir-
cumstance 
with 
the 
rent-a-bank 
scheme 
that 
steals 
the 
American 
Dream, such that people who qualify 
for better loans will likely get higher 
loans because they don’t always under-
stand the scheme. 
So I rise today, and I thank Mr. GAR-
CIA for what he has done to bring this 
bill to fruition. I thank the Chair-
woman, and I absolutely support the 
legislation. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR), who is the rank-
ing member on the Subcommittee on 
National Security, International De-
velopment, and Monetary Policy of the 
Financial Services Committee. He is 
also a member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee.

Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today also in opposition to S.J. Resolu-
tion 15, the Congressional Review Act 
repeal of the Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency’s true lender rule. 
The United States has the most vi-
brant and innovative financial system 
in the world. Recent advancements in 
technology have fostered products and 
partnerships that expand access to 
credit to large swaths of the population 
that previously couldn’t access basic fi-
nancial services. 
Many of these innovations faced 
challenges from regulatory red tape or 
confusing and often conflicting rules. 
The OCC’s true lender rule gave needed 
clarity to banks and their partners, fix-
ing the disastrous Madden rule. 
The OCC’s true lender rule gave that 
clarity, but unfortunately, the effort in 
the House today threatens to under-
mine the progress that we have made 
and compromise underbanked individ-
uals’ and small businesses’ access to fi-
nancial services. 
I spoke with a local Kentucky bank 
that partners with a nonbank fintech 
lender to provide credit to consumers, 
including many underbanked popu-
lations. They told me that absent the 
true lender rule, they will once again 
be buried in compliance costs to keep 
track of the patchwork of cases that 
dictate the rules of the road. 
Rather than embrace innovation to 
deliver cost savings to their customers, 
many of whom have trouble accessing 
traditional financial services to begin 
with, the bank will need to retain 
thousand-dollar-an-hour 
New 
York 
lawyers 
just 
to 
keep 
everything 
straight. And guess what? Those costs 
get passed on to the consumer through 
higher prices or reduced product avail-
ability. 
This is yet another example of the 
Democrats sacrificing good policy for 
the sake of political points, all under 
the guise of consumer protection. 
Contrary to some of the rhetoric 
from my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, a vote for this CRA will actu-
ally harm the very people they purport 
to be helping. 
Madam Speaker, one final point. I in-
clude in the RECORD an April 14, 2021, 
letter to the chair of the Financial 
Services Committee from the former 
OCC 
Acting 
Comptroller 
Blake 
Paulson. 
OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER 
OF THE CURRENCY, 
Washington, DC, April 14, 2021. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. PATRICK MCHENRY, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Serv-
ices, House of Representatives, Washington, 
DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS
AND RANKING 
MEMBER MCHENRY: On March 26, 2021, H.J. 
Res. 35 was introduced, providing for Con-
gressional disapproval under the Congres-
sional Review Act of the Office of the Comp-
troller of the Currency’s (OCC) final rule, en-
titled ‘‘National Banks and Federal Savings 
Associations as Lenders,’’ commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘True Lender’’ rule. As you 
and other members consider the resolution, I 
want you to be aware of the rule’s intended 
effect and the adverse impact of overturning 
the rule. 
On October 27, 2020, the OCC issued its final 
true lender rule to provide legal and regu-
latory certainty to national banks’ and fed-
eral savings associations’ (banks) lending, 
including loans made in partnerships with 
third parties. The OCC’s rule specifies that a 
bank makes a loan and is considered to be 
the true lender of the loan if, as of the date 
of origination, it (1) is named as the lender 
in the loan agreement or (2) funds the loan. 
The rule clarifies that as the true lender of 
a loan, the bank retains the compliance obli-
gations associated with making the loan, 
even if the loan is later sold, thus negating 
concerns regarding harmful rent-a-charter 
arrangements. Our rulemaking prevents po-
tential arrangements in which a bank re-
ceives a fee to ‘‘rent’’ its charter and unique 
legal status to a third party with the intent 
of evading state and local laws, while dis-
claiming any compliance responsibility for 
the loan. These schemes have absolutely no 
place in the federal banking system, and this 
rule helps address them. 
The rule makes clear banks’ responsibility 
and accountability for the loans they make 
and facilitates the OCC’s supervision of this 
core banking activity. Disapproval of the 
rule would return bank lending relationships 
to the previous state of legal and regulatory 
uncertainty, which, as nearly 50 preeminent 
economic and finance scholars explained in 
January 2021, adversely affects the function 
of secondary markets and restricts the avail-
ability of credit. 
Legal and regulatory certainty facilitates 
access to responsible credit and clarifies re-
sponsibility and accountability in lending 
involving third-party partnerships. Bank 
third-party partnerships help banks better 
serve their communities by expanding access 
to affordable credit products from main-
stream financial service providers. Such ac-
cess is particularly important as individuals 
and small businesses across the country 
work to recover from effects of the COVID– 
19 pandemic. Banks seek partnerships with 
third parties for a variety of legitimate rea-
sons, including reaching additional markets, 
benefiting from specific expertise or tech-
nology, and improving the efficiency and 
cost of their own operations. The OCC’s 
third-party risk management guidance and 
supplemental exam procedures make clear to 
banks that they retain the risks for activi-
ties conducted through relationships with 
third parties. 
With the legal and regulatory certainty 
provided by the rule, lending by banks made 
in partnership with third parties can be as-
sessed as part of the ongoing supervision of 
these banks, including as part of the OCC’s 
examinations to evaluate bank compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations that en-
sure consumer protection, Bank Secrecy Act 
and anti-money laundering compliance, re-
quired disclosures, and other obligations as-
sociated with making loans. The OCC clari-
fied examiner responsibilities in assessing 
true lender activities in third-party relation-
ships in 202l. This clarification addressed 
considerations related to assessing banks’ 
due diligence on the lending product or ac-
tivity (e.g., terms and scope) and the third 
party; credit risk management, including un-
derwriting practices; model risk manage-
ment; compliance management systems; and 
ongoing monitoring of the lending activity 
and the third party’s performance. 
If a bank fails to satisfy any of its compli-
ance obligations, the OCC will not hesitate 
to use its supervisory and enforcement au-
thorities to correct the deficiencies, protect 
consumers, and ensure the federal banking 
system operates in a safe, sound, and fair 
manner. 
As you consider the Congressional Review 
Act resolution, you should be confident that 
the OCC issued this rule with the intent to 
enhance its ability to supervise bank lend-
ing. The rulemaking conformed to the Ad-
ministrative Procedure Act, and the agency 
considered all stakeholder comments pro-
vided during the rulemaking process. The re-
sulting rule is consistent with the authority 
granted to the agency by Congress. 
It 
is 
also 
important 
to 
dispel 
misperceptions of the rule, many of which 
are repeated by opponents of the rule. To be 
clear, the rule does not change banks’ au-
thority to export interest rates. That au-
thority is granted by federal statute. Nor 
does the rule permit national banks to 
charge whatever rate they like; national 
banks and federal savings associations have 
the same authority as state banks regarding 
the exportation of interest rates. Both fed-
eral and state-chartered banks must conform 
to applicable interest rate limits. Disparities 
of interest rates from state to state result 
from differences in the state laws that im-
pose these caps, not OCC rules or actions. 
States retain the authority to set interest 
rates, and rates vary from state-to-state. 
The rule does not limit states’ ability to 
regulate the conduct of state-licensed and 
regulated nonbank lenders, which engage in 
the vast majority of predatory lending. 
States 
are 
the 
primary 
regulators 
of 
nonbank lenders, including payday lenders. 
Nonbank lenders are generally also subject 
to the rules and enforcement actions of the 
Consumer 
Financial 
Protection 
Bureau 
(CFPB).

It is also important to understand why de-
mand exists for short-term, small-dollar 
credit products and why many consumers 
rely on nonbank sources of such credit, in-
cluding 
payday 
lenders. 
Unfortunately, 
mainstream 
service 
providers, 
including 
commercial banks, largely abandoned short- 
term small-dolJar lending over the past two 
decades. The resulting lack of choice and 
fewer options pushed up the cost of these 
products and forced consumers to seek serv-
ices on less favorable terms. Because mil-
lions of U.S. consumers do not have suffi-
cient savings or access to traditional credit, 
they borrow nearly $90 billion each year in 
short-term small-dollar loans typically rang-
ing from $300 to $5,000 to make ends meet and 
to address things like emergency car repairs 
and other unexpected expenses. That is why 
the OCC has remained vocal about encour-
aging banks to provide consumers with more 
safe and affordable options to meet these 
small-dollar needs. In providing these prod-
ucts, banks should consider the ‘‘Interagency 
Lending Principles for Offering Responsible 
Small-Dollar Loans,’’ published in May 2020. 
Banks should also consider the full and ac-
tual cost of a credit product and its afford-
ability. Fees associated with short-term 
loans may range from $10 to $30 per $100 bor-
rowed, and the imputed annual percentage 
rate (APR) of those loans can appear to ex-
ceed 100 percent or more. But often, the fees 
and total cost of these loans to the consumer 
can be less than that of loans made with a 36 
percent APR, when such loans are available 
at all. 
As you consider the Congressional Review 
Act resolution, please keep in mind what 
may be an unintended consequence of a Con-
gressional Review Act disapproval. Dis-
approving the OCC’s true lender rule will 
constrain future Comptroller ability to ad-
dress the true lender issue and may limit the 
OCC’s ability to take supervisory or enforce-
ment actions against banks that would have 
been deemed to have ‘‘made’’ the loan under 
the true lender rule. Rather than vacate the 
rule, limit future Comptrollers from taking 
up similar rules or possibly hamstring the 
OCC’s enforcement authority, changes to the 
rule, if any, should be made through the 
agency’s rulemaking process and in accord-
ance with the Administrative Procedures 
Act. 
Enclosed is a fact sheet that provides addi-
tional information for your awareness. If you 
have any questions or need additional infor-
mation, please do not hesitate to contact me 
or Carrie Moore, Director, Congressional Re-
lations. 
Sincerely, 
BLAKE J. PAULSON, 
Acting Comptroller of the Currency. 
Mr. BARR. The point I want to high-
light is that the former Acting Comp-
troller was making the point that dis-
approving the OCC’s true lender rule 
will constrain a future Comptroller’s 
ability to address the true lender issue 
and limit the OCC’s ability to take su-
pervisory 
or 
enforcement 
actions 
against banks that would have been 
deemed to have made the loan under 
the true lender rule; meaning that the 
way the CRA law operates, if the House 
passes this resolution, we will have a 
permanent problem in the credit mar-
kets that will deprive low- and mod-
erate-income Americans of the finan-
cial products that they desperately 
need. 
That is why I urge all my colleagues 
to reject this misguided proposal. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PORTER). 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I ex-
press my gratitude to Chairwoman 
WATERS for allowing me to speak in 
support of invalidating the predatory 
true lender rule. 
In our home State, the legislature 
passed an interest rate cap of 36 per-
cent on loans of up to $10,000 about 2 
years ago. 
Before California Governor Newsom 
had even signed this bill into law, pred-
atory online lenders began plotting 
during their shareholder earnings calls 
to evade the new law through rent-a- 
bank arrangements. Companies like 
Speedy Cash and CashNetUSA went so 
far as to gloat about the California law 
creating a huge opportunity for them 
by 
driving 
out 
their 
competition, 
subprime title lenders based in Cali-
fornia. 
Since the founding of the United 
States, States have chosen to impose 
their own limits on interest rates that 
lenders may charge consumers. The 
Trump administration’s true lender 
rule 
greenlit 
these 
rent-a-bank 
schemes and, in doing so, undermined 
the will of Californians who, through 
the democratic process, chose to pro-
hibit abusive interest rates. 
The true lender rule violates our fed-
eralist democracy, and it must be in-
validated. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DONALDS), who has been a 
great new Member of Congress. 
Mr. DONALDS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding to 
allow me to speak on this matter. 
It 
is 
important 
to 
understand, 
Madam Speaker, that having access to 
financial products is critical for not 
only the innovation of our markets but 
for the future expansion of our mar-
kets. It is time to take the pettiness 
out of politics and actually prioritize 
policy that puts Americans first and 
puts America first. 
True lender is not being discussed in 
a way that considers people. If that 
were the case, we would be recognizing 
the incredible ways it has spurred inno-
vation in our markets and has provided 
more access to credit and other finan-
cial products for Americans. 
Instead of Congress working together 
to create financial equity in a sustain-
able way or ensuring that the United 
States remains a global leader, Demo-
crats are working to undo anything ac-
complished under the Trump adminis-
tration, even if it means sacrificing the 
good of the people. 
I support assessing harmful financial 
policies of the past and working to 
undo some of the mistakes that have 
been made. In fact, we could benefit 
from assessing legislation like Dodd- 
Frank, which has put tremendous 
downward 
pressure 
on 
community 
banks being formed in the United 
States. But that is not what is being 
done here. 
We are not having honest conversa-
tions. My peers across the aisle are 
undoing good policy without an objec-
tive view to determine how it helps or 
hurts Americans. 
Fintech has played a significant role 
in transforming our markets, helping 
smaller banks become more competi-
tive, and creating more products and 
access for Americans. The true lender 
rule has supported that because it 
clarifies the legal framework that al-
lows these bank and nonbank partner-
ships to be successful for consumers. 
We should be prioritizing fair access 
to financial services for Americans and 
work to protect and promote innova-
tion in our markets so that consumers 
have as many pathways as possible to 
prosperity and achieving the American 
Dream. 
If we scrap the true lender rule, we 
will disrupt our market, stifle innova-
tion, and hinder access to accountable 
and affordable credit for consumers and 
small businesses. This is not the prece-
dent we should set in this body. It is a 
gross abuse of power and a knife in the 
back of consumers. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
The true lender rule specifies that 
when a bank makes a loan, the bank is 
the true lender. The rule clarifies what 
was uncertain and, therefore, made 
those loans more expensive. 
This gives certainty to the market-
place. It is a good thing. The true lend-
er rule is a good thing. 
Under the true lender rule, we have 
fintechs that have been enabled to 
make loans in coordination with banks 
and regulated like the people that they 
work with, like the banks that they 
work with, which means the loans fall 
under Federal consumer protection 
laws, under Federal usury laws, under 
Federal laws. 
One case in point, what the true lend-
er rule enabled was one out of four Af-
rican American-owned businesses ac-
cessing credit through fintechs. 
I would ask Members to review a few 
pieces of evidence that I have here. 
Madam Speaker, I would refer the 
Members to a study conducted by NYU 
highlighting the important role that 
fintechs play in supporting African 
American-owned small businesses. 
I would also refer the Members to let-
ters in opposition to S.J. Res. 15: a

ers Association, Consumer Bankers As-
sociation, Electronic Transactions As-

Americans for Prosperity; and a June 
22, 2021, letter from the Competitive 
Enterprise Institute, which consists of 
a number of additional signatories. 
None of those people are payday lend-
ers, by the way, which is the most spu-
rious argument about the true lender 
rule. If you want to get at payday lend-
ing, go talk about valid when made. 
That would be the sound argument 
from there. At least it has some rela-
tionship tangentially to payday lend-
ing. True lender does not. These are 
different loans that are being described 
by my colleagues across the aisle. 
Let’s be clear. The National Banking 
Act enacted in 1864 established the 
principle 
by 
which 
and 
explicitly 
granted national banks the ability to 
transfer loans State-by-State. If you 
don’t like that model, then repeal the 
1864 National Banking Act instead of 
making these false arguments about 
the true lender rule, which simply pro-
vides clarity about the National Bank-
ing Act. 
My colleagues across the aisle would 
have you believe that this is a complex 
scheme cooked up by the previous ad-
ministration to get around consumer 
protection laws. That is not true. We 
are talking about 157 years of banking 
law here in the United States, and my 
colleagues across the aisle are arguing 
about that. 
My Democratic colleagues also ig-
nored this basic fact: They have made 
misleading statements about national 
banks versus State banks. They have 
implied falsehoods on State interest 
rates. They have cited protecting con-
sumers when now they are just leaving 
them out to dry. That is not consumer 
protection. 
I get it, Democrats are now so politi-
cally motived that the facts and long-
standing precedent no longer matter. I 
think facts matter. In fact, Democrats 
are so blinded by partisanship, some 
can’t even seem to differentiate be-
tween that doctrine of valid when made 
versus what we are discussing today, 
which is true lender. I think we should 
be rooted in fact, and our policy de-
bates should be rooted in fact. 
Make no mistake, the true lender 
rule provides necessary consumer pro-
tections and supports affordable credit 
to more communities. The rule does 
nothing to change interest rates, plain 
and simple. States retain that author-
ity. 
The actions in 2020 to clarify true 
lender are very different than codifying 
and clarifying valid when made. Both 
were important clarifications, though. 
The argument today is about true 
lender, not some massive shift away 
from congressional intent, not some-
thing new, something longstanding. 
Regardless, the Democrats will push 
through whatever they can in the 
House today. But as former Acting 
Comptroller Brooks recently stated, 
nullifying the true lender rule does 
nothing to undo payday lending—noth-
ing. And it seems to be what my col-
leagues across the aisle have a real 
problem with. 
Deal with that. Don’t create needless 
pain for consumers. Don’t drive up the 
cost of credit and make it less avail-
able by repealing this true lender rule. 
This is another moment where my 
colleagues are working against the na-
tional banks for politics rather than 
protecting consumers and creating a 
more vibrant, competitive, and innova-
tive marketplace. 
We should do what is good for con-
sumers in the financial system. Tech-
nology and innovation facilitate finan-
cial inclusion, which should be our 
goal. 
Let’s not waste further time here. 
Let’s vote this idea down that we are 
debating right now. Let’s get back to 
actually driving a more competitive 
marketplace and doing what is right 
for our constituents, what is right for 
consumers, and what is right for fami-
lies. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this resolution, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time I have re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). The gentlewoman has 18 
minutes remaining.

Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
resolution 
would take the necessary action to re-
verse the harmful Trump-era true lend-
er rule that preys on small business 
owners and individuals when they need 
assistance the most. This rule is a back 
door for nonbanks to charge triple 
digit interest rates that trap con-
sumers. 
Last month, the Senate passed this 
resolution on a bipartisan vote with all 
Democrats voting in support. They 
were joined by Republican Senators 
LUMMIS, RUBIO, and COLLINS. This reso-
lution is also supported by more than 
400 consumer, civil rights, veterans, 
small businesses, and other organiza-
tions, including the American Civil 
Liberties Union, Americans for Finan-
cial Reform, the Center for Responsible 
Lending, Faith for Just Lending, the 
NAACP, National Association of Feder-
ally-Insured Credit Unions, the Na-
tional Consumer Law Center, Con-
ference of State Bank Supervisors, and 
25 State attorneys general from both 
red and blue States, among many oth-
ers. 
Madam Speaker, and Members, small 
businesses and underbanked consumers 
do not benefit from the rule. Instead, 
the rule allows nonbank lenders to 
launder loans through banks in order 
to charge those with limited access to 
credit triple digit interest rates and 
trap these consumers in devastating 
cycles of debt. These predatory rent-a- 
bank schemes disproportionately prey 
on communities of color, draining 
wealth from these communities and, in 
turn, perpetuating the racial wealth 
gap. 
A disproportionate share of payday 
borrowers come from communities of 
color even after controlling for income. 
Communities of color have historically 
been left out of the banking system. 
Black and Latinx consumers are much 
less likely to have a checking account 
than White consumers, which is typi-
cally a requirement for a payday loan. 
About 17 percent of Black and 14 per-
cent 
of 
Latinx 
households 
are 
unbanked compared to 3 percent of 
White households. 
Payday lenders target communities 
of color. The communities most af-
fected by redlining are the same who 
are saturated by payday lenders today, 
which are more likely to locate in 
more affluent communities of color 
than in less affluent White commu-
nities. 
One borrower, a single mother living 
below the poverty line from California, 
submitted a complaint to the CFPB 
about Elevate’s RISE. 
‘‘I was misled by RISE Credit to be-
lieve that they were unlike other pred-
atory loan companies. By the time,’’ 
she says, ‘‘I understood what I had 
signed, I had paid them thousands of 
dollars in interest. 
‘‘I have recently become temporarily 
unemployed and called them to ask for 
help during my time of financial hard-
ship. They refused any solution and my 
account is headed to collections now. 
‘‘The total paid is far over the 
amount initially borrowed from RISE. 
This is robbery, and all of the neces-
sities I have for myself and my chil-
dren are suffering because of it. 
‘‘How is it that they can do this? I 
am asking for help for not only my 
family, but for all of the families tar-
geted by these predatory loans meant 
to target those living in poverty and 
struggling to live paycheck to pay-
check.’’ 
The fake lender rule protects lenders 
that not only destroy small businesses 
but also threaten to take business own-
ers’ homes. 
In New York, Jacob Adoni, a realtor, 
has been facing foreclosure threats on 
a $90,000 loan with an interest rate of 
138 percent APR. 
In a court case—that is Adoni et al. 
v. World Business Lenders, LLC, Axos 
Bank and Circadian Funding filed in 
New York in October 2019—Adoni said 
he received threats that the lender 
would foreclose on his home after re-
ceiving a $90,000 loan at 138 percent 
APR, secured by his personal residence. 
‘‘Adoni was contacted by Circadian 
Funding with an offer of a personal 
loan that would be funded by WLB and 
Axos Bank. He was told that the loan 
documents would be provided to him at 
12 p.m. and he must execute them by 6 
p.m. or the offer would no longer be 
valid. 
‘‘Adoni was told by Circadian that 
the loan was meant to be a personal 
loan to him, but it was necessary for 
the loan documents to make reference 
to his business.’’ 
He has received multiple threats to 
foreclose on his home and the mort-
gage.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3110 
June 24, 2021 
Madam Speaker, let me just respond 
to some of what I have heard from the 
opposite side of the aisle. I am abso-
lutely overcome by the great interest 
that my Republican colleagues have in 
helping minorities. I am so moved 
about the fact that all this is about 
helping minorities who have been put 
into trouble because they are subprime 
lenders. Now if they are, it is because 
they were the victim of predatory lend-
ers who put them in a subprime posi-
tion. 
But I hardly think that this is all 
about taking care of minorities and 
these small businesses. This is about 
protecting the big banks. This is about 
protecting the national banks. You 
heard what the ranking member said. 
The big national banks have been in 
business for years, and we ought to let 
them operate the way that they have 
historically operated and not interfere 
with them. 
I don’t know where they get away 
with protecting these big national 
banks. And the constituents in their 
own district who are being misused be-
cause they happen to get money, 
money that was lent to them by a 
nonbank, and that nonbank partnered 
with a national bank, they are now 
having to pay the interest rates of an-
other State, perhaps—like it was ex-
plained in California, why we have 
usury laws and there is a cap on those 
interest rates. 
When they do this kind of partnering, 
it is all about getting to a State where 
they are made to pay whatever that big 
bank is allowed to collect from them. 
Madam Speaker, this is a rip-off. 
This is about hurting the people who 
most need our help. This is about al-
lowing this partnering to go on. And 
many of those people who are bor-
rowing from these payday lenders and 
other nonbanks don’t even know that 
they are going to be the victims of the 
big banks and the interest rates that 
they charge. This is absolutely ridicu-
lous, and there is not a credible argu-
ment from the other side of the aisle 
about why they should disadvantage 
these minorities and small businesses 
that they claim that they are pro-
tecting. This is outrageous. 
Madam Speaker, I am so pleased that 
the Senate passed this bill. And I am so 
pleased that the Republicans on the 
other side of the aisle—not on the 
other side of the aisle, on the other 
side of Congress—decided to join with 
the Democrats in order to do the right 
thing on behalf of our constituents. 
Madam Speaker, when they talk 
about, Oh, this is just because they 
didn’t like Trump and they want to 
undo whatever he has done, that is 
their talking point for the day. This is 
not about that. 
This committee, the Committee on 
Financial Services, is a new and dif-
ferent kind of committee. We are not 
owned by the banks. We are not here to 
protect the big banks and the national 
banks. We are here because we are here 
to take care of what is right and what 
is fair. And this committee is not going 
to be about the business of ripping off 
the least of these. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 486, the joint

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous materials on S.J. Res. 
13. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of S.J. Res. 13, a Congressional Re-
view Act resolution disapproving the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, or EEOC, Conciliation Rule. 
This resolution will help ensure fair-
ness for those who bring forth charges 
of unlawful workplace discrimination. 
When the EEOC has found that an 
employer likely violated the law, it is 
required under title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act of 1984 to engage in concil-
iation before filing a lawsuit. This con-
ciliation process is meant to be an in-
formal and confidential opportunity for 
parties to settle a charge of discrimi-
nation in lieu of going to court. 
Unfortunately, in the final weeks of 
the Trump administration, the EEOC 
issued a final rule that imposed oner-
ous new requirements on the concilia-
tion process. 
Under the new rule, the EEOC must 
provide an employer with a written 
summary of the facts and the nonprivi-
leged information the EEOC relied on 
to determine that the employer vio-
lated the law. Notably, the rule re-
quires the EEOC to expose the identi-
ties of workers or groups of workers for 
whom relief is being sought unless they 
proactively request anonymity, and 
their witnesses. 
This new rule will put a thumb on 
the scale in favor of employers in cases 
where the EEOC found that they likely 
violated workers’ civil rights. Specifi-
cally, the rule incentivizes employers 
to focus litigation on whether the 
EEOC failed to satisfy the rule’s new 
requirements instead of whether the 
employer engaged in unlawful discrimi-
nation. 
In fact, on settlement—settlements 
had been more likely since the Su-
preme Court ruled that this concilia-
tion process should be informal, unlike 
the rule that was promulgated late in 
the Trump administration. This will 
allow unscrupulous employers to drag 
out the conciliation process, possibly 
for years—and even avoid account-
ability altogether—by just litigating 
over whether the EEOC complied with 
the conciliation rule rather than cor-
recting the discriminatory process. 
b 1430 
The EEOC rule conflicts with the Su-
preme Court’s 2015 decision in Mach 
Mining v. EEOC. It was a unanimous 
decision. It held that the EEOC must

have the discretion to use whatever in-
formal means of settlement are appro-
priate in each individual case. How-
ever, under the new rule, a rigid concil-
iation process will apply across the 
board, one-size-fits-all, in every case of 
workplace discrimination. 
This solution will likely lead to in-
creased retaliation against victims of 
discrimination and witnesses, as well 
as needless delays in justice for work-
ers. We know that justice delayed is 
justice denied. This is why civil rights 
leaders and worker advocates across 
the country have called on Congress to 
pass this Congressional Review Act res-
olution and restore fairness for victims 
of workplace discrimination. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a Statement of Administrative 
Policy from the Biden administration 
in support of this resolution. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
S.J. RES. 13—A
JOINT
RESOLUTION
FOR
CON-
GRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL UNDER CHAPTER 8 
OF
TITLE
5, UNITED
STATES
CODE, OF
THE 
RULE SUBMITTED BY THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION RELATING TO ‘‘UP-
DATE OF COMMISSION’S CONCILIATION PROCE-
DURES’’—SEN. MURRAY, D–WA, AND
NO
CO-
SPONSORS 
The Administration supports Senate pas-
sage of Senate Joint Resolution 13 to nullify 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission’s (EEOC) recently promulgated ‘‘Up-
date of Commission’s Conciliation Proce-
dures,’’ which became effective on February 
16, 2021, under the Congressional Review Act. 
The rule that S.J. Res. 13 would nullify im-
posed onerous and rigid new procedures on 
the EEOC’s obligation to conciliate or ‘‘set-
tle’’ meritorious claims of employment dis-
crimination, that risks unduly delaying and 
diverting limited resources from agency ef-
forts to investigate and resolve meritorious 
claims of employment discrimination. The 
rule increases the risk of retaliation by mak-
ing it easier for employers to demand the 
identities of those with information about 
unlawful discrimination, which will likely- 
have a chilling effect on the willingness of 
victims and witnesses to come forward. S.J. 
Res. 13 would nullify the rule’s unnecessary 
and burdensome standards that would likely 
result in increased charge backlogs, and 
lengthier charge investigation, resolution 
and litigation times. The resolution will also 
ensure that EEOC has the flexibility to tai-
lor 
settlements 
to 
the 
facts 
and 
cir-
cumstances of each case, thus increasing the 
likelihood of voluntary compliance. The res-
olution will furthermore ensure that justice 
for workers subject to discrimination is not 
delayed, or potentially denied, due to costly 
and time-consuming collateral litigation. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the resolution, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to S.J. Res. 13, which negates a 
recent U.S. Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission, EEOC, rule. I urge 
Members to reject this misguided reso-
lution. 
The rule in question, often referred 
to as the conciliation rule, is fair, in-
creases transparency, reduces senseless 
litigation, and upholds a Federal stat-
ute. 
There are dozens of pressing prob-
lems demanding Congress’ attention. 
Our southern border is being run over 
by drug dealers and human traffickers. 
America is vulnerable to cyberattacks 
from adversarial foreign nations, like 
China and Russia. Our children are 
months behind in their schoolwork be-
cause of Democrats’ insistence on put-
ting teachers’ union leadership de-
mands before students’ interests. 
We could be addressing those prob-
lems, but Democrats are choosing to 
elevate the repeal of this commonsense 
rule before all those other immediate 
issues. 
Let’s examine the facts of the mat-
ter. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 re-
quires EEOC to engage in conciliation. 
Before the EEOC can pursue court pro-
ceedings against an employer for a dis-
crimination claim, the agency must 
work with the business to resolve the 
dispute. 
There are good reasons Congress es-
tablished this requirement. Successful 
conciliations provide immediate relief 
to employees who suffered discrimina-
tion. Conciliations also save these em-
ployees time and money. Court cases 
are adversarial and can last years. In-
dividuals who experience discrimina-
tion should not have to wait years for 
justice. 
Nothing in the regulation prohibits 
the EEOC from using the court system 
if conciliation fails. For over four dec-
ades, EEOC’s conciliation process re-
mained 
largely 
ineffectual 
and 
unaltered. 
Antiquated 
bureaucratic 
systems deserve scrutiny, and this 
opaque practice was long overdue for 
improvement. 
Prior to the rule’s promulgation, a 
paltry 41 percent of the conciliations 
were successful. One out of every three 
employers declined to participate in 
this broken process. 
In 2015, the Supreme Court rep-
rimanded the EEOC for its inadequate 
conciliation process, which included 
failing to communicate basic informa-
tion about the alleged discrimination 
to employers. The mounting evidence 
of a failed conciliation process grew 
harder and harder for the EEOC to ig-
nore. That is why the conciliation rule 
was issued on January 14, after an ex-
tensive 
notice-and-comment 
rule-
making. 
Under the rule, the core tenets of 
conciliation remain unchanged. Concil-
iation stays voluntary, does not favor 
either the employer or the worker, and 
protects individuals’ privacy. 
The rule requires the EEOC to pro-
vide employers with basic but impor-
tant information in support of the 
agency’s findings, including simple un-
derlying facts, the legal basis for the 
finding, an explanation of the mone-
tary relief calculations, and whether 
the EEOC designated the case for a 
class of individuals. 
The rule also does not increase costs 
to taxpayers. EEOC is on the record 
saying its operating budget will absorb 
any minor costs associated with imple-
menting the rule. 
In summary, S.J. Res. 13 harms the 
victims of discrimination; encourages 
the EEOC to pursue needless, com-
bative, and expensive litigation; and 
turns the EEOC back into a politically 
driven, runaway bureaucracy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on S.J. Res. 13, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), 
the chair of the Subcommittee on Civil 
Rights and Human Services, and co-
sponsor of the House version of this 
resolution. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of S.J. Res. 13, a resolu-
tion to repeal a harmful rule from the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission that threatens to delay or po-
tentially deny justice for individuals 
who face workplace discrimination. 
As chair of the Education and Labor 
Committee’s Civil Rights and Human 
Services Subcommittee, I am pleased 
to co-lead the House companion to this 
resolution because far too many work-
ers still experience workplace discrimi-
nation. The Civil Rights Act helps 
workers seek redress by directing the 
EEOC to engage in conciliation, which 
provides an opportunity for settlement 
before going to court. 
But the EEOC’s new rule added bur-
densome requirements, and it gives 
employers unfair advantages in the 
conciliation process. Under the rule, 
the EEOC discloses confidential infor-
mation, analysis, and even the identi-
ties of workers to employers, increas-
ing the likelihood of retaliation. 
By passing this resolution, we can di-
rect the EEOC to revert to its prior 
practices, which were upheld by the 
Supreme Court. 
Madam Speaker, I want to note that 
in the Mach Mining decision from the 
U.S. Supreme Court in 2015, the Court 
held that ‘‘Every aspect of the Title 
VII’s conciliation provision smacks of 
flexibility. To begin with, the EEOC 
need only to ‘endeavor’ to conciliate a 
claim, without having to devote a set 
amount of time or resources to that 
project.’’ 
We can direct the EEOC to revert to 
those prior practices that were upheld 
and that better support the needs of 
workers. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
SCOTT for his leadership, and I urge all 
of my colleagues to support this resolu-
tion. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, Democrats have 
claimed that EEOC’s conciliation rule 
could subject employees to retaliation. 
This claim could not be further from 
the truth. 
First, the rule explicitly states that 
employees may remain anonymous in 
the conciliation process if they so 
choose. In such cases, settlement dis-
cussions would proceed with the em-
ployee or employees making claims of 
discrimination remaining anonymous.

Second, the existing statutes to 
which the conciliation rule applies all 
make it illegal for an employer to re-
taliate against an employee for filing a 
charge with EEOC or participating in 
EEOC proceedings. An employer would 
be compounding its legal exposure if it 
unwisely tried to act against employ-
ees for making a complaint to the 
EEOC. 
The claim that the conciliation rule 
will expose employees to retaliation is 
a red herring. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this misguided 
resolution, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, just to state on the 
question of whether or not the individ-
uals can be revealed, identifying the 
aggrieved individuals must take place, 
but not if the individual or individuals 
have requested anonymity. That means 
you have to know that you are about 
to be revealed. You have to proactively 
request anonymity. If you haven’t gone 
through those steps, then you will be 
revealed. 
That is an unnecessary step. It puts 
people in unnecessary jeopardy, and I 
hope they would not subject that. It is 
not necessary. The EEOC has an obli-
gation to do conciliation, but they 
need to do it on an individualized case, 
best aimed at settlement and based on 
an individual case, and reveal the in-
formation that is best for that purpose, 
and no more. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, in 2015, the Supreme 
Court harshly criticized EEOC’s concil-
iation process in the Mach Mining deci-
sion, which held that a court may re-
view whether the EEOC satisfied its 
statutory obligation to engage in con-
ciliation before filing a lawsuit. 
The agency claimed that two ‘‘book-
end letters’’ were all that was needed 
to satisfy the statutory conciliation re-
quirement, one at the beginning of the 
process announcing a finding of dis-
crimination, and one at the end stating 
that conciliation had failed. 
The Supreme Court disagreed and 
ruled that the EEOC must disclose to 
the 
employer 
‘‘what 
practice 
has 
harmed which person or class, and pro-
vide the employer an ‘opportunity’ to 
discuss the matter in an effort to 
achieve voluntary compliance.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, S.J. Res. 13 is a par-
tisan maneuver to overturn an emi-
nently reasonable regulation. Before 
the rule, the EEOC’s conciliation proc-
ess was out of date, opaque, and inef-
fective. Individuals subject to work-
place discrimination should not have 
to wait years for justice. 
Employers are not asking too much 
when they request basic information 
about the EEOC’s findings. The concil-
iation rule updates a broken system 
and is beneficial to both workers and 
employers. 
S.J. Res. 13 delivers a partisan vic-
tory for the Democrats’ technocrat 
base. 
Madam Speaker, I reject S.J. Res. 13, 
and I urge my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to join me. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, it is our responsi-
bility to reverse the EEOC’s new con-
ciliation rule. Before this harmful rule 
change, the EEOC’s conciliation proc-
ess was what it was meant to be, an in-
formal, flexible, confidential oppor-
tunity to settle discrimination claims 
before going to court. That is what the 
Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 
2015. 
b 1445 
Now, the new conciliation rule is 
threatening 
to 
stack 
the 
process 
against workers by subjecting those 
who make discrimination claims to an 
increased risk of retaliation and allow-
ing employers to hijack the process to 
focus on whether it failed to conciliate, 
not whether the employer violated the 
law. 
Simply put, this is an unnecessary 
new regulation which will, at best, 
delay justice for victims of discrimina-
tion and, at worst, open the door for 
collateral 
litigation, 
adding 
poten-
tially years to the process before ever 
reaching the merits of the discrimina-
tion claim. 
That is why advocates of victims of 
discrimination support the resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter from the Leadership 
Conference on Civil and Human Rights 
signed by 24 civil rights groups in sup-
port of the resolution. 
THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE 
ON CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS, 
Washington, DC, June 9, 2021. 
Re Support S.J. Res. 13, a Congressional Re-
view Act Resolution of Disapproval to 
Protect Workers from a Harmful EEOC 
Rule 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The undersigned 24 
civil and workers’ rights organizations urge 
you to vote for S.J. Res. 13, a Congressional 
Review Act (CRA) resolution of disapproval 
to undo a January 14, 2021, Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) final 
rule that threatens to harm working people 
seeking relief from discrimination and to im-
pede the work of the EEOC. 
The EEOC final rule made several changes 
to conciliation, the process by which the 
EEOC tries to settle a charge of workplace 
discrimination. Instead of ensuring that dis-
crimination charges are resolved fairly, the 
EEOC’s final rule imposes several new obli-
gations and disclosures that: 
Significantly weight the conciliation proc-
ess in favor of employers; 
Delay justice and increase the likelihood 
of harm to working people; 
Divert scarce EEOC staff time and re-
sources away from investigating discrimina-
tion; and 
Contravene 
controlling 
U.S. 
Supreme 
Court precedent. 
The Senate passed S.J. Res. 13 on May 19, 
2021. If the House now passes this resolution, 
Congress could undo this harmful rule and 
restore the status quo with respect to the 
EEOC’s procedures. A resolution of dis-
approval 
is 
an 
appropriate 
exercise 
of 
Congress’s power in this case, because the 
CRA is the most expeditious and effective 
option for addressing the negative impacts of 
the EEOC’s final rule. 
The EEOC must be able to conduct its 
work efficiently in order to be effective in its 
mission to prevent and remedy workplace 
discrimination. This mission is even more 
critical in the middle of a global pandemic 
that continues to have severe economic re-
percussions for women, people of color, and 
other marginalized communities, including a 
heightened risk of job loss, health and safety 
hazards, and discrimination based on sex, 
race, age, and disability. 
Individuals who experience discrimination 
on the job already face significant hurdles to 
seeking redress, including retaliation, lack 
of information about their rights, and lack 
of access to legal assistance. When an indi-
vidual does file a charge of discrimination 
against their employer with the EEOC, the 
agency collects information and conducts an 
investigation. If the EEOC finds ‘‘reasonable 
cause’’ to believe employment discrimina-
tion has occurred, the parties are invited to 
participate 
in 
the 
conciliation 
process, 
which seeks to settle or resolve the charges 
of discrimination informally and confiden-
tially, in lieu of filing a lawsuit. Title VII re-
quires the EEOC to attempt resolution of 
charges informally before considering or pro-
ceeding with litigation, and the EEOC may 
only pursue litigation if conciliation has 
failed. 
The final rule will only deepen the barriers 
working people face coming forward to re-
port discrimination and obtain justice. It re-
quires the EEOC to grant the employer ac-
cess to details of the victim and witnesses’ 
identity and allegations, escalating the risk 
of retaliation for workers. Claims of retalia-
tion made up more than half of all charges 
filed at the EEOC in FY 2020, and fear of re-
taliation prevents many victims of discrimi-
nation from coming forward and many wit-
nesses 
from 
being 
forthright—something 
that may be especially true during an eco-
nomic crisis. The rule also requires the 
EEOC to disclose critical information con-
cerning the EEOC’s legal analysis of the case 
to employers, and employers only. In other 
words, the EEOC would be required to auto-
matically tum over its case files to employ-
ers whom the agency believes to have acted 
unlawfully, but not to the working people 
who are seeking a remedy for the discrimina-
tion they faced. This practice would exacer-
bate resource and information inequities be-
tween the parties to the benefit of employers 
only. Although the proposed rule would 
allow disclosures to the charging party upon 
request, many working people who file 
charges are unrepresented by counsel and 
will not know to make such a request. The 
EEOC, whose mission is to prevent and rem-
edy discrimination, should not, in its own 
procedural rules, disadvantage the very 
party seeking to remedy discrimination. 
By imposing inflexible rules on the concil-
iation process, the EEOC final rule also 
flouts congressional intent and is incon-
sistent with Supreme Court precedent. In its 
unanimous 2015 decision Mach Mining, LLC 
v. EEOC, the Supreme Court explained that

‘‘every aspect of Title VII’s conciliation pro-
vision smacks of flexibility,’’ which allows 
the EEOC to tailor its approach to concilia-
tion in the way most appropriate in each 
case. Without flexibility, the EEOC will be 
forced to divert resources away from inves-
tigating and remedying workplace discrimi-
nation and put them toward satisfying the 
final rule’s burdensome standards, resulting 
in increased delays at the expense of victims 
of discrimination. 
In addition, the rules would saddle EEOC 
with wasteful collateral litigation attacking 
the conciliation process, prolonging harm to 
workers through increased delay. This tactic 
was prevalent before Mach Mining, and that 
case itself shows the potential impact: The 
workers in Mach Mining—women excluded 
from coal mining jobs due to sex discrimina-
tion—were forced to wait nine years after 
the first charge was filed for relief, in part 
because of unmeritorious employer chal-
lenges to the conciliation process. 
By invoking the CRA and passing a resolu-
tion of disapproval, Congress could quickly 
restore the status quo with respect to the 
EEOC’s conciliation procedures, minimizing 
the harm to workers and eliminating the 
need for the EEOC to expend its scarce re-
sources either undertaking rulemaking proc-
esses to rescind the conciliation rule or im-
plementing the onerous new procedures in 
the final rule, and defending the sufficiency 
of the new conciliation process in collateral 
litigation by employers. 
Importantly, application of the CRA to the 
final rule ensures that the EEOC would be 
prohibited from promulgating a ‘‘substan-
tially’’ similar rule in the future that would 
hinder vigorous enforcement of federal work-
place antidiscrimination laws. The final con-
ciliation rule was both procedurally and sub-
stantively flawed, raising concerns about its 
integrity. As such, Congress’s exercise of the 
CRA would be warranted here. 
Accordingly, we urge you to support and 
vote for S.J. Res. 13, the CRA resolution of 
disapproval of the EEOC’s final rule. Please

Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, we cannot allow employers to 
drag out the conciliation process rath-
er than be held accountable for vio-
lating workers’ civil rights. 
As I said at the beginning of this de-
bate, justice delayed is justice denied. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting for this resolution 
and taking a critical step to ensuring 
that those who suffer workplace dis-
crimination can get timely and fair 
justice. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) for 
working with me on the House version 
of the resolution. 
I ask for the support of the House to 
pass the resolution to overturn the 
EEOC regulation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I 
rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 13, a Con-
gressional Review Act (CRA) resolution of dis-
approval to undo an Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission (EEOC) final rule issued 
January 14, 2021 that threatens to harm work-
ing people seeking relief from discrimination 
and to impede the work of the EEOC. 
The EEOC final rule made several changes 
to conciliation, the process by which the 
EEOC tries to settle a charge of workplace 
discrimination, all of which harm employees. 
Instead of ensuring that discrimination 
charges are resolved fairly, the EEOC’s final 
rule imposes several new obligations and dis-
closures that: 
1. Significantly weight the conciliation proc-
ess in favor of employers; 
2. Delay justice and increase the likelihood 
of harm to working people; 
3. Divert scarce EEOC staff time and re-
sources away from investigating discrimina-
tion; and 
4. Contravene controlling U.S. Supreme 
Court precedent. 
The Senate passed S.J. Res. 13 on May 
19, 2021, and by following suit, the House can 
ensure this harmful rule is rescinded and the 
status quo ante is restored with respect to the 
EEOC’s procedures. 
The EEOC must be able to conduct its work 
efficiently in order to be effective in its mission 
to prevent and remedy workplace discrimina-
tion. 
This mission is even more critical in the 
middle of a global pandemic that continues to 
have severe economic repercussions for 
women, 
people 
of 
color, 
and 
other 
marginalized communities, including a height-
ened risk of job loss, health and safety haz-
ards, and discrimination based on sex, race, 
age, and disability. 
Madam Speaker, individuals who experi-
ence discrimination on the job already face 
significant hurdles to seeking redress, includ-
ing retaliation, lack of information about their 
rights, and lack of access to legal assistance. 
When an individual does file a charge of 
discrimination against their employer with the 
EEOC, the agency collects information and 
conducts an investigation. 
If the EEOC finds ‘‘reasonable cause’’ to be-
lieve employment discrimination has occurred, 
the parties are invited to participate in the con-
ciliation process, which seeks to settle or re-
solve the charges of discrimination informally 
and confidentially, in lieu of filing a lawsuit. 
Title VII requires the EEOC to attempt reso-
lution of charges informally before considering 
or proceeding with litigation, and the EEOC 
may only pursue litigation if conciliation has 
failed. 
The final rule will only deepen the barriers 
working people face coming forward to report 
discrimination and obtain justice by requiring 
the EEOC to grant the employer access to de-
tails of the victim and witnesses’ identity and 
allegations, escalating the risk of retaliation for 
workers. 
Claims of retaliation made up more than half 
of all charges filed at the EEOC in FY 2020, 
and fear of retaliation prevents many victims 
of discrimination from coming forward and 
many witnesses from being forthright—some-
thing that may be especially true during an 
economic crisis. 
The rule also requires the EEOC to disclose 
critical information concerning the EEOC’s 
legal analysis of the case to employers, and 
employers only. 
In other words, the EEOC would be required 
to automatically turn over its case files to em-
ployers whom the agency believes to have 
acted unlawfully, but not to the working people 
who are seeking a remedy for the discrimina-
tion they faced. 
This practice would exacerbate resource 
and information inequities between the parties 
to the benefit of employers only. 
The EEOC, whose mission is to prevent and 
remedy discrimination, should not, in its own 
procedural rules, disadvantage the very party 
seeking to remedy discrimination. 
By imposing inflexible rules on the concilia-
tion process, the EEOC final rule also flouts 
congressional intent and is inconsistent with 
Supreme Court precedent. 
In its unanimous 2015 decision Mach Min-
ing, LLC v. EEOC, 575 U.S.ll, 135 S. Ct. 
1645, No. 13–1019 (2015), the Supreme Court 
stated that ‘‘every aspect of Title VII’s concilia-
tion provision smacks of flexibility,’’ which al-
lows the EEOC to tailor its approach to concil-
iation in the way most appropriate in each 
case. 
Without flexibility, the EEOC will be forced 
to divert resources away from investigating 
and remedying workplace discrimination and 
put them toward satisfying the final rule’s bur-
densome standards, resulting in increased 
delays at the expense of victims of discrimina-
tion. 
By invoking the CRA and passing a resolu-
tion of disapproval, Congress could quickly re-
store the status quo with respect to the 
EEOC’s conciliation procedures, minimizing 
the harm to workers and eliminating the need 
for the EEOC to expend its scarce resources 
either undertaking rulemaking processes to re-
scind the conciliation rule or implementing the 
onerous new procedures in the final rule, and 
defending the sufficiency of the new concilia-
tion process in collateral litigation by employ-
ers. 
In addition, application of the CRA to the 
final rule ensures that the EEOC would be 
prohibited from promulgating a ‘‘substantially’’ 
similar rule in the future that would hinder vig-
orous enforcement of federal workplace anti-
discrimination laws. 
For all of these reasons, I strongly support 
S.J. Res. 13, the CRA resolution of dis-
approval of the EEOC’s final rule and urge all 
Members to join me in voting for its passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OR REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, June 24, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House or Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the 
permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II 
of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, the Clerk received the following mes-
sage from the Secretary of the Senate on 
June 24, 2021, at 2:53 p.m.: 
That the Senate passed S. 1251. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
CHERYL L. JOHNSON, 
Clerk.

REDUCING CHILD POVERTY 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to talk about the child tax credit, 
which will start reaching families next 
month. 
It is hard to overstate the tremen-
dous good that the American Rescue 
Plan is doing for people all across 
Pennsylvania and, indeed, all across 
this country. Soon, we will see even 
more direct relief heading to families 
in Monroe, Northampton, and Lehigh 
Counties in my district. 
Starting in July, nearly all families 
with children in my district will re-
ceive monthly payments of up to $300 
per child through the end of the year as 
part of the expanded and improved 
child tax credit. The expanded and im-
proved child tax credit will be a lifeline 
for many struggling families, helping 
more than 133,000 children in my dis-
trict. 
I cannot overstate how meaningful 
this assistance is to families who have 
been hit so hard this past year. These 
are payments that will help families 
pay 
for 
the 
cost 
of 
childcare, 
healthcare, diapers, and clothing. For 
many, these payments will be the dif-
ference between food on the table or 
hunger. 
I am proud to have fought for and 
passed the American Rescue Plan, and 
I am glad we were able to get impor-
tant help like the child tax credit into 
the hands of families across Pennsyl-
vania 7. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Ms. GRANGER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, the 
Hyde amendment is an essential pro-
tection for the conscience rights of 
Americans and has saved over 2 million 
innocent lives. 
The prohibition on the use of tax-
payer funds for abortion has been en-
acted annually on a bipartisan basis 
despite our country’s divisions on the 
question of abortion itself. Yet, despite 
President Biden’s decades of support 
for the Hyde amendment, his budget 
request bows to the radical left and 
fails to include these longstanding pro-
tections. 
As ranking member of the Appropria-
tions Committee, I am committed to 
protecting all existing pro-life protec-
tions and advancing the pro-life cause 
whenever possible. 
I will strongly oppose the elimi-
nation of the Hyde amendment from 
annual appropriations bills. But to 
strengthen the Hyde amendment, we 
must make it permanent law. That is 
why I support H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer 
Funding for Abortion Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, the No 
Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BOWMAN). Under guidelines consist-
ently issued by successive Speakers, as 
recorded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request 
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships. 
b 1645 
HONORING BSA TROOP 19 FROM 
SHORT HILLS, NEW JERSEY 
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor BSA Troop 19 in 
Short Hills, New Jersey, and their his-
toric first class of female Eagle Scouts. 
Five members in the troop in my dis-
trict earned this prestigious rank in 
the first year young women were able 
to obtain the status in the organiza-
tion’s 111-year history. 
I first met Katelyn Cannon, Keira 
Lowden, Riya Tyagi, and Bridget and 
Morgan Lomax virtually in February 
and I was lucky enough to attend their 
Eagle ceremony earlier this month. 
Their pioneering leadership has paved 
the way for many more young women 
to follow. 
From creating a nonprofit corpora-
tion, to leading conservation efforts for 
koalas; to preserving and digitizing 
hundreds of hours of music for the New 
Jersey Youth Symphony; to building 
and installing houses for bats in local 
open spaces, these Scouts have gone 
above and beyond. 
The Scouting community is better 
with Katelyn, Keira, Riya, Bridget, and 
Morgan as Eagle Scouts. 
Congratulations to these trailblazing 
young women, and thank you to their 
Scoutmaster, Daniel Cannon.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
WAYNE SEAY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
Wayne Seay of Pooler, Georgia, who 
peacefully passed away on June 21 at 
the age of 81. 
A lifelong resident of Pooler, Wayne 
attended Chatham Junior High, grad-
uated from Savannah High School and 
Georgia Southern College. He was then 
drafted into the United States Army 
where he proudly served in the 1st In-
fantry Division. 
After completing his military serv-
ice, he joined the faculty of Robert W. 
Groves High School where he taught 
history and social studies for 28 years. 
Wayne was a devoted Pooler resident 
and was elected to the city council 
where he served as mayor pro tempore. 
I had the honor and privilege of serving 
on the Pooler City Council with Wayne 
Seay. He was an outstanding member. 
I also had the honor and privilege of 
being a former student of Mr. Seay. I 
know everyone will remember his kind 
and gentle spirit. I am thankful for the 
immense impact Wayne Seay had on 
the Pooler community and on myself, 
and I know his legacy will remain. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time.

CHILD TAX CREDIT 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the expanded 
child tax credit. Thanks to the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, working families 
across the country will receive a 
monthly child tax credit payment of up 
to $300 per child, covering nearly 90 
percent of all children and cutting 
child poverty in half. 
In my district, the expanded child 
tax credit will improve the lives of 
families from Newton to Fall River, 
helping almost 60 percent of children 
and lifting 3,800 children out of pov-
erty. As a father, I am committed to 
providing parents with the support 
needed to navigate the high cost of 
raising a child. 
From affording their food bills to 
paying for childcare, this substantial 
tax relief will set our parents and chil-
dren up for success. The expanded child 
tax credit is a necessary investment in 
our families so that we can build an 
economy that works for everyone. We 
must make the expansion permanent. 
f 
RECOGNIZING HERITAGE HIGH 
TRACK TEAM 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Heritage High School 
girls track and field team in Lynch-
burg, Virginia, for winning their sec-
ond consecutive Virginia Class 3 State 
championship. The Heritage Pioneers 
racked up 74 points at the title meet 
with only five girls. 
Star student athlete junior, Alaysia 
Oakes said: ‘‘Our coach always calls us 
the SEAL team. We go into states with 
five people, and it was definitely a 
tough battle,’’ she continued, ‘‘but ev-
erybody did what they needed to do. 
Just stayed strong. We knew it was 
going to be a battle, but we didn’t back 
down, so I’m proud of us.’’ 
Oakes captured three events, and 
seniors Tya Blake, Kaelynn Hawkins, 
Graysen Arnold, and Jalasia Jones 
helped the Pioneer’s pour on the 
points. 
Oakes came away as the individual 
State champion in the triple jump, 
long jump, and 100-meter dash, while 
placing second in the 200-meter and 400- 
meter dash; all making for a tremen-
dous showing from the junior phenom. 
This team is a shining example of 
hard work paying off. Congratulations 
to the athletes and coaches on an in-
credible season. We look forward to 
seeing what the future has in store for 
this talented group. 
f 
CHILD TAX CREDIT AND JUSTICE 
IN THE COURTS 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the 
greatest wealth enhancer that I have 
seen in our immediate time in the 
United States Congress is the child tax 
credit, which should be made perma-
nent. It will provide an opportunity for 
life and liberty and, yes, freedom for 
families 
in 
my 
community; 
hard-
working mothers and fathers and chil-
dren who look up into your eyes, some 
of them sometimes hungry. 
It is important that this child tax 
credit be made permanent, and I stand 
here ready to move it as fast as pos-
sible. Thank you to our administration 
for what they are doing. 
Now, I simply want to talk about jus-
tice in the courts, justice in a court 
system that sentences individuals, non-
violent individuals to years in prison 
to rot, even individuals who have done 
reimbursement or compensation for 
their offense. Courts have to be, yes, a 
coequal branch of government, but 
they have to have justice. 
What about an individual that I have 
no stake in who happens to be an en-
tertainer under a horrible guardian-
ship, forced to take medications, forced 
not to have children? 
I am on the Judiciary Committee and 
there is a lot to be done. Yes, it is a co-
equal branch of government, but there 
has to be real justice. When you go into 
a courthouse you deserve justice. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. ESTES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
as a voice for all Kansans, including 
those who have yet to be born. 
Kansans have long valued life. From 
our entry into the Union as a free 
State before the Civil War to the Sum-
mer of Mercy in Wichita, the Sun-
flower State has been a beacon of hope 
and freedom for those without a voice. 
In Congress, we should follow the 
lead of Kansans and recognize the in-
trinsic value of human life. Yet, the 
left continues to push radical and un-
scientific policies that end the lives of 
unborn babies. 
What is worse, they want to pay for 
their abortion-on-demand policies with 
your tax dollars, a provision that has 
wide, bipartisan opposition. New poll-
ing shows that 58 percent of voters and 
65 percent of Independents oppose tax-
payer-funded abortion. 
The No Taxpayer Funding for Abor-
tion Act is a no-brainer. Simply put, 
we need to save the Hyde amendment. 
It saved nearly 2.5 million lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships. 
f 
IMPACT OF BIG TECH CENSORSHIP 
IN FIGHT AGAINST COVID 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, for far too 
long, the mainstream media and Big 
Tech companies like Twitter, Google, 
and Facebook have used their power to 
censor one type of speech while favor-
ing and promoting other speech that 
they prefer in an attempt to manipu-
late public discourse. 
There is even evidence that the main-
stream media and Big Tech use their 
own judgment to suppress information 
related to the origins of coronavirus as 
well as available medication and treat-
ment options. 
In December 2020, shortly after med-
ical professionals and infectious dis-
ease specialists testified before the 
United States Senate on the effective-
ness of COVID–19 treatments, Google’s 
YouTube removed the testimony from 
their 
online 
platform. 
The 
big 
takeaway is that these conglomerates 
have been complicit in limiting discus-
sion of facts and evidence about the 
COVID–19 pandemic to the detriment of 
the American people. 
We must rein in Big Tech and the 
mainstream media’s abusive and mo-
nopolistic practices that have led to an 
abundance of censorship, views, and 
opinions deemed, in their own judg-
ment, to be objectionable.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MARK 
DOUMIT 
(Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of 
Southwest 
Washington 
and 
Cathlamet resident Mark Doumit. 
Sadly, Mark passed away this week 
at the age of 59. For decades, Mark’s 
life had been defined by a commitment 
to his home community. Mark served 
two terms as Wahkiakum County com-
missioner, then as a State house mem-
ber representing the 19th legislative 
district for 10 years. 
Though he left elected office, he 
never abandoned public service. He 
served as a steady leader of the Wash-
ington Forest Protection Association 
for the last 15 years until his passing. 
A stalwart supporter of our forests, 
fish, water, and our economy, Mark 
was never hemmed in by Democrat 
versus Republican politics. He was a 
friend and an ally to me and anyone 
who cared about these priorities. 
I want to extend my deepest sym-
pathies to Mark’s family, friends, and

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. LATTA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, for more 
than 40 years American taxpayers have 
been protected from paying for abor-
tions on demand with their tax dollars. 
Alarmingly, President Biden’s budget 
proposal calls for the Hyde amendment 
to be removed. This radical, immoral 
policy makes it legal for taxpayer dol-
lars to support and enable the abortion 
industry. 
Nearly 60 percent of Americans agree 
that taxpayer dollars should not be 
used to fund abortion. This is not a 
partisan issue. One of the most basic 
ways we can protect innocent life is en-
suring that taxpayer money is not 
being used to fund abortions. 
As a defender of the unborn, I do not 
support the removal of the Hyde 
amendment. I oppose all efforts to 
mandate taxpayer funding for abortion. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-

f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mrs. HINSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to call on my colleagues to con-
sider the No Taxpayer Funding for 
Abortion Act, legislation that would 
preserve the longstanding Hyde amend-
ment. 
For the first time in over 40 years, 
the administration’s proposed budget 
does not include Hyde protections, pro-
tections that have long ensured tax-
payer dollars are not used to fund abor-
tions. 
Mr. Speaker, Hyde protections have 
saved 2.4 million babies. Reversing this 
longstanding pro-life policy is wrong. 
The right to life is the most funda-
mental of all of our rights. We must de-
fend those who cannot defend them-
selves. 
I will always lend my voice to the 
voiceless and fight to ensure that Iowa 
taxpayers are never forced to fund 
abortions against their will. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary, be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. PALMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer 
Funding for Abortion Act. This bill 
codifies the Hyde amendment which 
ensures that taxpayer dollars aren’t 
spent on abortions. 
For over 40 years, both Democrats 
and Republicans have understood the 
value of this important protection 
which has saved more than 2.4 million 
lives. The right to life precedes all 
other rights and is fundamental to ev-
erything I believe. 
I urge my colleagues across the aisle 
to embrace life and support H.R. 18. As 
President Biden said in 1994, ‘‘Those of 
us who are opposed to abortion should 
not be compelled to pay for them.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance.

CONGRATULATING AMBASSADOR 
DAVID FRIEDMAN 
(Mr. GARBARINO asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in acknowledgment of Long Is-
land’s own David Friedman, former 
U.S. Ambassador to Israel. 
In a few days, there will be a dedica-
tion ceremony to rename a local street 
in his honor, but I would be remiss if I 
did not state for the Record Ambas-
sador Friedman’s tremendous accom-
plishments in support of our ally, 
Israel, during his tenure. 
Whether it be countering the anti-Se-
mitic Boycott, Divestment and Sanc-
tions campaign against Israel or recog-
nizing Israel’s sovereignty over the 
Golan Heights, he has been a leading 
example on how best to represent our 
Nation abroad. 
Most notable, of course, was his lead-
ership in advancing the Abraham Ac-
cords, the greatest development in nor-
malized relations between Israel and 
its Arab neighbors in over 40 years, and 
the movement of the U.S. embassy to 
its rightful and lawful place, Jeru-
salem. 
I implore my colleagues to stand 
with me in a commitment to affirming 
and building upon the advancements 
that Ambassador Friedman made to 
strengthen U.S.-Israeli relations, and I 
congratulate him once again on his 
achievements.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
INDICATOR SPECIES 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given

Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, envi-
ronmental protection of species re-
volves around the use of indicator spe-
cies. But what has been lost in recent 
years is the impact also on humans and 
their needs. 
The indicator, for example, for farm-
ers in California is very grave in the 
great Central Valley and up at the 
Klamath Basin. 
Up on the Klamath, you have one en-
vironmental management plan that 
says more water is needed for salmon, 
for example, under a biological opin-
ion, and another management plan 
that says more water is needed to be 
stored in the lake for suckerfish. You 
can’t do both at the same time, and the 
result is the salmon are not more plen-
tiful and the suckerfish are not recov-
ering as a species. 
But the rural areas in Klamath and 
Siskiyou Counties are being cut off 
from their main economic driver. The 
farms up there are suffering badly be-
cause of water that has been taken by 
the Federal Government that does not 
belong to the Federal Government. 
The stored water in that lake was 
created for agriculture solely, and yet 
it is being used as more or less a slush 
fund for Federal agencies that want to 
take this water and somehow try and 
make a difference in the river. This has 
got to come to a stop, because we need 
agriculture in California.

June 24, 2021 
when the American worker will not 
come into work? 
For the past nearly 7 months, this 
President has held America’s small 
business owners hostage and declared a 
de facto strike on the American econ-
omy. 
Following the end of this COVID pan-
demic, the Biden administration has 
been granted the political gift of a life-
time: take a staggering American 
economy, still reeling from the eco-
nomic collapse, and simply let it re-
turn to normal. If the Biden adminis-
tration had done nothing, zero, if they 
had sat on their hands and twiddled 
their thumbs, if Joe Biden had taken 
more naps, then experts say our econ-
omy would be in a much better place 
than where it is right now. 
Instead, the Biden administration’s 
efforts place the American economy in 
a financial choke hold that threatens 
to obliterate hundreds of small busi-
nesses in my district. 
It was John Adams that said: ‘‘Facts 
are stubborn things; and whatever may 
be our wishes, our inclinations or the 
dictates of our passions, they cannot 
alter the state of facts and evidence.’’ 
Let’s cast our eyes over the facts, 
shall we? 
Back in April, economists predicted 
over 1 million new jobs to be added to 
our economy. Biden added just over 
250,000. In May, economists adjusted 
their expectations, acknowledging this 
administration simply cannot deliver 
the type of job growth past administra-
tions could. 
Even with adjusted expectations, the 
Biden administration still fell short of 
the mark. There is no debate that the 
Biden administration of free handouts 
has dramatically undercut efforts to 
restart our economy. His massive in-
crease of unemployment benefits has 
kept workers at home and left store 
owners scrambling to keep up with the 
growing consumer demand. 
In my own district, business leaders 
in Asheville, Hendersonville, Franklin, 
and Macon County, have spoken with 
me about the difficulty in getting em-
ployees back to work. Who can blame 
them? Biden is literally paying Amer-
ican citizens to stay home instead of 
getting them back to work. 
Who would fault an American hus-
band or mother when they decide to 
stay home with their family and earn 
double their salary while doing it? 
The Biden administration knows that 
their policy of handouts harms and is 
hurting business owners, but the game 
has always been about creating a wel-
fare class, not empowering our econ-
omy. It is disgusting. 
With those thoughts in mind, I now 
recognize one of my fellow North Caro-
lina champions, the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman and 
my 
fellow 
North 
Carolinian, 
Mr. 
CAWTHORN, for having this Special 
Order. 
My comments will echo his. Look, 
the pandemic is over. Thank goodness. 
Our economy should be seeing robust 
growth. Instead, businesses cannot fill 
the record number of jobs available. 
In fact, the number one issue that I 
hear, not only from business owners 
and managers, but from all constitu-
ents, is that folks will not come to 
work, businesses cannot find workers. 
Last month, despite 9.3 million job 
openings, there were only 69,000 more 
new hires than in the month before. 
How is that possible with unemploy-
ment at 6 percent? 
Simply put, President Biden and 
Democrats have insisted on continuing 
to pay people more to stay home than 
to work. 
Despite consistent warnings from Re-
publicans and economists, the so-called 
American Rescue Plan continued ex-
panded 
unemployment 
benefit 
pro-
grams enacted in the heart of the pan-
demic. 
In my home State, in North Carolina, 
these expanded benefits are worth $650 
a week. That is about $50 more than 
the Progressives’ preferred minimum 
wage of $15 an hour. You don’t have to 
be an economist to see why small busi-
nesses can’t fill job openings, and it is 
beyond time that Congress fix this self- 
inflicted wound. 
That is one reason that Representa-
tive JODEY ARRINGTON and I introduced 
the Jump-Start the Economy with 
Jobs Act. This bill, which ought to 
move promptly in this Congress, re-
quires an individual who is currently 
receiving enhanced unemployment ben-
efits to recertify that they do not have 
a job offer waiting for them in order to 
continue receiving enhanced benefits. 
If their former employer would re-
ceive a communication, and if they say 
we are prepared to give an offer to that 
person to come back to work, then 
they can’t continue to receive unem-
ployment benefits. How appropriate. 
That would tailor the program to those 
people that continue to need it because 
of a job dislocation they cannot re-
solve. Enhanced unemployment bene-
fits should continue for those who 
truly need them and not for those who 
have a job waiting for them. 
The extended Federal unemployment 
benefits implemented during COVID–19 
had their time, but they should not be 
the mainstay now. They are, instead, 
artificially reducing the workforce. 
Across the country, let’s all be 
thankful, communities are opening up 
their economies and getting back to 
normal. 
It is past time for this government to 
stop holding back the recovery and to 
stand up for small businesses, job gen-
erators, by ceasing to pay people to 
stay home. 
A good first step would be to enact 
the Jump-Start the Economy with 
Jobs Act. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Thank you very 
much, Congressman BISHOP, for those 
words. I echo the sentiments of both 
JODEY ARRINGTON and DAN BISHOP of 
wanting to jump-start this economy 
again. 
With the fact that there are 9.3 mil-
lion job openings in this country right 
now, we do need to change something 
to be able to actually fill the hire rate 
that has not increased at all. In fact, 
last quarter it only increased by 4.2 
percent. 
My friends, we will have artificial in-
flation if we do not do something to act 
quickly, and I believe the Jump-Start 
the Economy with Jobs Act is a great 
idea. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to recog-
nize another North Carolinian, a lion of 
our mountains, my dear friend, the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
BUDD). 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my friend and colleague, Con-
gressman CAWTHORN, for organizing 
this. 
Last month, the NFIB, or the Na-
tional Federation of Independent Busi-
nesses, reported that 48 percent of 
small businesses currently have un-
filled job openings, and that is an all- 
time high. Right now—you have heard 
the number mentioned—9.3 million jobs 
remain unfilled nationwide. 
This sluggish recovery is a direct re-
sult of the Federal Government paying 
people not to work. Essentially, the 
Federal enhanced unemployment ben-
efit 
constitutes 
a 
‘‘stay-at-home’’ 
bonus for millions of people. 
Instead of following the lead of doz-
ens of other States, North Carolina’s 
Governor refuses to end this very back-
wards incentive. 
That is why I introduced a solution 
that would help. It is called the Back 
to Work Bonus Act. First and fore-
most, my proposal would end the $300 
Federal unemployment bonus on day 
one. 
Second, the bill would allow a new 
worker to receive a $900 back-to-work 
bonus only if they get back in the 
workforce and stay on the job for at 
least 4 weeks. 
Now, to be clear, someone would only 
receive these dollars if they not only 
accepted the job offer, but fully went 
back to work. 
Third, I want to highlight that this 
legislation is a specific solution to 
what we hope is a temporary problem, 
using already appropriated funds that 
would expire on August 14. 
Look, we simply can’t continue to 
pay people to stay at home. For work-
ers that stayed in the workforce 
throughout the pandemic, we need to 
cut their taxes, so they get to keep 
more of their hard-earned money. 
We need to get the economy booming 
again, like it was during the Trump 
years. We need to stop the over-
spending in Washington that causes in-
flation to soar and eat away at a fam-
ily’s buying power. 
But above all, our number one pri-
ority needs to be getting folks back to 
work as quickly as possible. There are 
just too many opportunities out there, 
9.3 million of them, to be exact. So 
let’s get America back to work. 
Mr. 
CAWTHORN. 
Congressman, 
thank you for introducing that bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3121 
June 24, 2021 
If you think about it, $387 is the 
amount the average American receives 
from their home State in weekly unem-
ployment benefits. You add to that the 
$300 boost that the Federal Govern-
ment is putting on, on top of that, and 
it is no wonder why people aren’t going 
back to work. They get to stay at 
home with their families while making 
$17.17 an hour. That sounds like a good 
deal to me. 
But I genuinely hope that we can find 
some way out of this, because there is 
a real spiritual poverty created when 
you don’t actually work for your liv-
ing. 
It is now time for me to recognize a 
dear friend of mine from a Carolina 
that is not as good a North Carolina, 
the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. NORMAN). 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for offering this Special 
Order. It couldn’t come at a better 
time and a better place in history. 
Mr. Speaker, Americans have been 
subjected to one of the most testing 
years we have ever seen. Just as they 
are starting to get back on their feet 
and the great economic engine that is 
the American economy is starting to 
turn over, this administration and my 
Democratic colleagues are proposing to 
shut down the engine that we had run-
ning so robustly for the last 4 years 
under President Trump. 
Six trillion dollars in spending, with 
no offsets, is downright irresponsible 
and unfair to the American taxpayer. 
We are not going to get this economy 
on the right foot by expanding our 
Government even more. 
Growing inflation concerns have al-
ready begun to hit our constituents 
where it hurts the most, at the gas 
pump—have you tried filling up your 
car lately? It has hit you in the gro-
cery stores. It has hit you in the check-
books. 
This oncoming crisis is putting hard-
working Americans on rocky footing, 
and this President is proposing to pull 
the rug out from underneath them. An-
other cash infusion will do nothing 
more than kick those Americans while 
they are down by driving prices up 
even more. Enough is enough. 
Businesses are opening up, construc-
tion projects are expanding our neigh-
borhoods and cities, and there is a light 
at the end of the tunnel and the light 
is a bright one. Don’t shut the door on 
that light by throttling the demands of 
everyday items. 
Ultimately, there are a variety of 
reasons for these rising prices, many of 
which are industry specific. However, 
it is important to remember that big 
government spending is only going to 
make this problem worse. 
I was elected to Congress to take 
care of the American people. I was not 
elected to bankrupt this country. I was 
not elected to burden them even more. 
It is clear that the American economy 
wants to make a comeback. The only 
question is, will bureaucrats, will poli-
ticians, will government get out of the 
way. 
b 1715 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, Con-
gressman NORMAN was elected to take 
care of the American people, but right 
now the Democrats in Congress—al-
though it is hard to call them Demo-
crats because right now I believe that 
they have a socialist agenda, which is 
sabotaging America’s jobs recovery 
with a crippling tax hike that targets 
our small businesses, the backbone of 
our economy. 
Their plans raise small business 
taxes to the highest point in a genera-
tion, halt new projects and small busi-
ness growth by doubling taxes on in-
vestments, and Democrats supercharge 
a second death tax, if you can believe 
that, where they want to tax you more. 
It would hit farms, machine shops, and 
other small businesses. 
With all that in mind, I now yield to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, one of 
the greatest threats that emerged from 
this pandemic is an expanding govern-
ment unwilling to relinquish control 
and 
restore 
Americans’ 
God-given 
rights. 
We see it all across our country. 
President Biden and liberal Governors 
tout the ‘‘follow the science’’ talking 
point 
while 
failing 
to 
follow 
the 
science themselves, keeping in place 
pandemic restrictions while knowing 
full well that our economy can fully re-
open. 
While the left virtue signals, pushing 
radical policies like vaccine passports 
and critical race theory, American 
families are still struggling to make 
ends meet. Tens of thousands of busi-
nesses have closed their doors for good, 
and our children have fallen behind be-
cause they are denied in-person learn-
ing. 
Some Federal agencies are still not 
operating at pre-pandemic levels. We 
have American veterans who cannot 
access records they need for treatment 
and benefits they earned because of ca-
reer bureaucrats who can’t be bothered 
to go back to work. This is wrong and 
completely avoidable. 
Here, in Congress, we see the hypoc-
risy of the left on display. Speaker 
PELOSI lifts the mask mandate for the 
House floor, but keeps the people’s 
House closed to the public. We have 
Members of this body not showing up 
and voting in person. The people that 
we represent go to work every day, and 
they expect us to do the same. Ameri-
cans have never been and never will be 
a nation ruled by fear and control. 
Reopen the Capitol Building, reopen 
our country, and restore freedom and 
power to the American people. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I can 
see why Pennsylvania loves their Con-
gressman so much. 
When I think about what is going on 
in Congress and I see that Democrats 
are prioritizing wasteful spending over 
hardworking Americans’ paychecks, I 
realize that the Democrats’ socialist 
agenda 
won’t 
produce 
long-term 
growth or greater economic security 
for American families. 
A majority of Americans say they 
fear for an impending crash following 
the 
injection 
of 
Federal 
stimulus 
money during the pandemic. This is an 
unsettling thought for those who are 
trying to deal with dining room poli-
tics. 
With all those thoughts in mind, I 
am very pleased to yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. NEHLS), my 
dear friend and America’s sheriff, who 
represents Texas’ 22nd District. 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, it is time 
to get the American people back to 
work. The vaccine has been available 
for all Americans for weeks. Cases 
across the country are drastically de-
creased, and businesses are opening 
back up. Thank God. 
Why, then, is the Federal Govern-
ment still paying people not to work? 
Why, then, are we still considering 
multitrillion-dollar 
proposals 
when 
there is billions upon billions of pre-
viously 
appropriated 
COVID 
relief 
money that hasn’t been touched? 
Inflation is higher than at any point 
in over a decade. Americans are paying 
more for goods they need to survive. 
Businesses that are open and want to 
expand their workforce can’t find the 
employees willing to come to work be-
cause the government is paying them 
to stay home. 
And amidst all of this, the Biden ad-
ministration is proposing tax increases 
on job creators. It doesn’t take an eco-
nomics Ph.D. to conclude that raising 
taxes on job creators amid record lev-
els of inflation and this underper-
forming economy will lead to economic 
disaster. 
Small business owners in this coun-
try are trying to rebuild and get people 
back to work. Raising taxes on them 
will only hurt them and the Americans 
they want to hire. 
The Biden tax-and-spend model is 
failing our country. We need to get 
back to the free-market approach that 
we had under President Trump: Slash-
ing regulation, reducing taxes, and in-
creasing economic freedom. 
That is the light at the end of the 
Biden economic crisis tunnel. But to 
get there, we need Democrats to stop 
playing politics with the future of our 
country and work with the Repub-
licans. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I now 
yield to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. ESTES), a dear friend of mine who 
represents the Fourth District. 
Mr. ESTES. Mr. Speaker, we should 
be experiencing one of the greatest eco-
nomic booms in our history as we 
emerge from COVID, yet prices are 
climbing, 
consumer 
sentiment 
is 
plunging, and there are more than nine 
million open jobs without workers to 
fill them. That is the most ever. 
In my State of Kansas, we have 3.6 
jobs available for every job seeker. 
Subsidizing people not to work and 
spending without restraint is stalling 
out this recovery and causing inflation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3122 
June 24, 2021 
In May, core inflation rose at its 
fastest pace since 1992. That is because 
Democrats’ untargeted spending has 
acted like kindling for inflation. There 
is too much money chasing too few 
goods. Recent surveys show that 70 per-
cent of Americans are concerned that 
President Biden’s spending plans could 
lead to inflation. But if you have filled 
up your gas tank recently or entered a 
grocery store, you know that it is al-
ready there. 
Instead of working to quickly reopen 
and prioritize getting America back to 
work, upon entering office, President 
Biden took his eyes off the ball and 
squandered the recovery that President 
Trump had handed to him. In the first 
five months of 2021, the current admin-
istration has added 500,000 fewer jobs 
than the last 5 months of 2020. Presi-
dent Biden should be concerned about 
his economic crisis. 
Biden’s slow-growth agenda calls for 
$6 trillion in government spending with 
$3 trillion in new taxes. That would 
crush small and midsized companies, 
resulting in far fewer jobs down the 
road. 
One of the most antigrowth policies 
in President Biden’s agenda is his plan 
to revert America’s business tax rate 
to one of the worst in the world again 
at 28 percent, a move that would return 
us to the old tax code that incentivized 
jobs to be shipped overseas. 
Biden’s budget even acknowledges 
that a real recovery isn’t their pri-
ority. It only forecasts a meager 2 per-
cent GDP growth by 2023, with it drop-
ping even lower until 2029. 
The American people should contrast 
Biden’s 
tax-and-spend 
agenda 
with 
what Republicans have done and are 
fighting to do. In 2017, we put the 
American people first by passing a 
progrowth tax code while removing 
massive amounts of government regu-
lation. That created an economic at-
mosphere that enabled wages to grow 
for historically disadvantaged workers, 
brought the unemployment rate down 
to the lowest in 50 years, and allowed 
more people to find jobs in America 
than at any point in our history. The 
income gap was even shrinking as 
lower income wages were increasing 
faster. 
We need to get back to that. It is not 
hard to see the impact that common-
sense, progrowth policies can make. 
Our focus should be on filling available 
jobs and rebuilding our economy, not 
to line the pockets of progressive spe-
cial interest groups with millions in 
Federal spending, as Biden’s agenda 
would do. It is hard to ignore that, 
across the country today, the six 
States with the lowest unemployment 
rates all have Republican leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, President Biden and 
Speaker PELOSI need to prioritize eco-
nomic recovery, not unrestrained gov-
ernment spending. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I 
think Congressman ESTES touches on a 
great point. Under Republican leader-
ship, under the last administration, 
business applications were at record 
levels. The TCJA encouraged business 
creation, as the amount of business ap-
plications reached its highest level 
ever, of over 880,000. 
Now, you contrast that with what is 
going on in America today. There are 
many people who own restaurants in 
my own district, who are having to lit-
erally pay people $50 just to turn an ap-
plication in, and then they never show 
up for the interview or even for work. 
Because of how bleak things are 
looking, I am very happy to yield to 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
MCCLAIN), the most loved and the most 
feared woman in all of Congress. 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, for 
more than 40 years, Joe Biden has been 
a 
staunch 
supporter 
of 
the 
Hyde 
amendment. So have the American 
people. Just this past January, polling 
found that nearly 6 in 10 Americans op-
pose using tax dollars to terminate in-
nocent lives. That number includes a 
majority of Independents and nearly 
one-third of Democrats. 
For decades, congressional Demo-
crats joined Republicans in a truly bi-
partisan effort to ensure tax dollars of 
hardworking Americans do not pay for 
abortions. 
Unfortunately, 
President 
Biden is trying to shatter years of con-
gressional bipartisanship with a radical 
budget that has no Hyde amendment 
protections. 
The President ran on unity, yet his 
first budget proposal immediately di-
vides. This Congress must take back 
its congressional responsibility and 
craft spending bills which protect the 
lives of the unborn, just as past Con-
gresses have done since 1976. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, and ask 
for its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair has previously advised, that re-
quest cannot be entertained absent ap-
propriate clearance. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 37 minutes remaining. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Minnesota 
(Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, over the 
past year, it really has felt like our 
small businesses, our middle class, our 
communities have really taken one 
punch after another. 
First, we were handed mandatory 
shutdowns of our restaurants, our 
small businesses, and our churches, 
while Walmart and Lowe’s and other 
big box retail stores were allowed to re-
main open. In some places around the 
country, we were not even allowed to 
leave our homes unless it was for a pur-
pose that the government deemed es-
sential. 
Like all Americans, I am extremely 
excited and pleased to see that most of 
the economy in our communities have 
reopened. But we can’t help but ob-
serve that it seems like the reopening 
is occurring because of the independ-
ence and resilience of the American 
people, despite the best efforts by some 
to keep us shuttered indefinitely. 
It is baffling that during this time 
when our neighbors have the oppor-
tunity to finally get back to work, 
Democrats are pushing policies to hurt 
them. 
Oh, you are trying to find employees 
for your diner so you can reopen? 
Well, they are paying those employ-
ees more to sit at home. 
You have a corner store in central 
South Dakota? 
Sorry, but President Biden canceled 
the Keystone XL pipeline and instantly 
caused your customers to lose their 
jobs. 
You want to go back to work, but 
have two children at home? 
Well, unbelievably, the Biden edu-
cation plan included zero requirement 
that your son’s or daughter’s school re-
opens. 
You were excited for your hotel to be 
busy this spring? 
Well, the CDC was still advising 
Americans not to travel, even if they 
were vaccinated. 
Your bait shop along the Canadian 
border has been struggling since the 
border closure? 
Too bad President Biden and Justin 
Trudeau 
decided 
that 
couldn’t 
be 
solved at the G7 last week. 
You need gas to get to work, to get 
to your job site? 
Well, it costs you $50 more this year 
than it did last year. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a staggering 
laundry list of policies that individ-
ually would be an enormous impedi-
ment to our success, but together it is 
a brick wall. Without urgent changes 
to these antijobs, anti-small business 
policies, our communities will con-

and more families will feel the nega-

As a small business owner myself, I 
know what these men and women are 
going through. I know that they were 
the ones who built their business, not 
the government. And despite opposing 
efforts, they won’t let the government 
take it away from them either. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I be-
lieve we are created to work, and I be-
lieve we are created to work hard, and 
the right to work and the determina-
tion to build with one’s hands is as 
foundational to the American ethos as 
it can be. 
We were not set in this universal or-
chard to stand still as trees. There is 
no substitute under the heavens for 
productive labor. It has been said that 
a firm work ethic is the process by 
which dreams become realities. It is 
the process by which idle visions be-
come dynamic achievements. 
This administration seeks, though, 
to strip employment from the men and

women of America, to replace work 
with welfare and service with subser-
vience. I reject that notion. 
Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), my 
dear friend. 
b 1730 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss 
the most important issue facing our 
country today: the reopening of the 
U.S. economy. 
For 16 long months, the U.S. econ-
omy has been held hostage by govern-
ment, both elected and unelected. What 
started as a 15-day shutdown to allow 
hospitals to brace for the coming wave 
of COVID cases has ballooned into over 
a year of shifting goalposts, evolving 
science, and political power grabs. 
Since 
the 
pandemic 
began, 
over 
200,000 small businesses, which the 
President once claimed were the back-
bone of the U.S. economy, have been 
shuttered for good. This has left their 
owners jobless and futures uncertain. 
Those whose businesses did survive 
the long lockdowns still face harsh re-
strictions. For too long and in too 
many cases, we have seen restrictions 
on controlling how many customers 
they can serve, how their employees 
can conduct business, and, by default, 
how much revenue they can bring in. 
Worse, the reopening of our economy 
has been prolonged even further by the 
misguided attempts from the political 
left to provide relief. 
The example I hear the most from 
constituents and businesses back in 
George’s First Congressional District is 
the increased unemployment benefits. 
Under these expanded benefits, many 
Americans have been able to receive 
more money not working than they did 
actually working. This is a poor incen-
tive to get people back into jobs, espe-
cially as our economy continues to see 
record-high job openings. 
Businesses coming out of their long 
hibernation will continue to struggle 
to find employees as long as this ben-
efit is in place. 
There are not enough taxpayer dol-
lars in the world to give these busi-
nesses the relief they need, but we can 
remove the Federal Government as an 
obstacle to returning to normalcy. 
We need policies that incentivize 
Americans to find jobs and allow busi-
nesses to stand on their own. Ulti-
mately, we need to put an end to all 
COVID business restrictions nation-
wide. 
It is hard to say what the long-term 
impact of prolonged shutdowns will be, 
but it does not take a Harvard econo-
mist to know that losing 200,000 jobs in 
small businesses alone does not spell 
good fortune. 
The sooner we get Americans back to 
work and our economy back to full ca-
pacity, the sooner we can return to 
normal or, at the very least, stop the 
damage from continuing. 
To borrow a quote from President 
Trump, we built the greatest economy 
in the world, and we will do it a second 
time. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, when 
we started looking at the American 
Families Plan, we realized the tax 
hikes it would increase would raise 
capital gains and dividends tax from 20 
to 39.6 percent, almost two times the 
normal price. It would impose capital 
gains taxes at death, which creates a 
second death tax, although I can’t be-
lieve that we would ever need to tax 
anyone more than we do now. It would 
expand the 3.8 percent Obamacare sur-
tax to hit even more small businesses’ 
income than it already does. 
Lastly, it would increase the IRS’ au-
diting power, including monitoring 
bank accounts, because the very first 
thing that we need to reopen our econ-
omy at a better pace is to give more 
power to three-letter agencies. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GOOD), my good 
friend. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
as a Nation founded on a history of 
rugged individualism, the American 
people are resilient and self-reliant. 
They will flourish and prosper absent 
the intrusion and heavy-handed weight 
of the government. 
Apart from national defense, safety, 
and security, the less our government 
does, the better, especially here at the 
Federal level. 
In fact, our country would be far bet-
ter off if we had just paid this Presi-
dent and his administration to stay 
home, and they did nothing over these 
past 51⁄2 months. It is sadly true that 
the less this government does to us 
while pretending to do things for us, 
the better off we will all be. 
Incredibly, this administration’s dis-
astrous economic policies have pro-
duced fewer jobs in their first 5 months 
of the year than the Trump adminis-
tration produced in the last 5 months 
of 2020 when the government restric-
tions and lockdowns in the name of the 
China virus were far more widely and 
strenuously enforced. 
Unfortunately, at present time, we 
have employers, businesses, and job 
creators literally competing with their 
own government for employees because 
of the enhanced $300 a week Federal 
unemployment benefit. 
Every business owner that I talk 
with in my district tells me that this is 
a major, ongoing problem. Every busi-
ness has up signs saying: ‘‘Help Want-
ed,’’ ‘‘Employees Needed.’’ 
We even have this problem in my 
home district in the city of Charlottes-
ville, in Albemarle County, with the 
Postal Service. They can’t get people 
to come to work for the starting wage 
of $18 an hour for a mail carrier be-
cause they are getting paid $17 an hour 
to stay home and not work. 
However, the tone-deaf, economically 
illiterate Democrats, especially those I 
serve with on the Education and Labor 
Committee, they tell businesses they 
simply need to raise their wages so far 
above what the Federal Government is 
paying folks not to work—again, $17 an 
hour in my home State of Virginia— 
that folks will finally refuse the free 
income not to work and return for a 
higher paycheck—this as businesses 
are struggling to recover from the gov-
ernment shutting them down for a 
year, again, in the name of the China 
virus. 
We need to fully reopen our economy, 
end all restrictions, open our schools so 
parents can go back to work, and stop 
sending confusing and harmful mes-
sages, like requiring masks on public 
transportation. 
In this very House, it was only a cou-
ple of weeks ago that we were pre-
tending that even in a Special Order, 
speaking to an empty Chamber with no 
one near you—within how many feet?— 
you needed to wear a mask to keep us 
safe because we wanted to appear to 
the American people back home that 
we were doing something, the theater 
of wearing masks just a few weeks ago. 
That is continuing now on public 
transportation. What kind of a myth 
and harmful message does that send to 
folks? 
We need to stop paying folks not to 
work, reopen our economy, and turn 
the American people loose. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Colorado 
(Mr. BUCK). 
Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding, and I thank the 
gentleman for his leadership on this 
important issue. I think it is some-
thing that America needs to talk 
about, and I am glad we are talking 
about it on the floor of the people’s 
House. 
During the COVID shutdowns, more 
than 
600,000 
businesses 
shut 
their 
doors. This is 200,000 more businesses 
than typically close in a year due to 
natural market influences. 
Unsurprisingly, many of these most 
severe lockdowns across the country 
were implemented by liberal Governors 
who caved to fearmongering and hos-
tility to former President Trump. 
To be clear, I recognize the dangers 
posed by this virus. However, reac-
tionary and overreaching shutdowns 
significantly worsened the impacts of 
COVID on our Nation. 
One of the most glaring examples of 
these negative impacts has been on our 
children who missed a year or more of 
in-person 
education 
because 
their 
schools were closed. 
The resilience and creativity of many 
teachers to adjust to these tragic cir-
cumstances are admirable. However, 
the reality is that these closures re-
sulted in deteriorating mental health 
among students and less effective edu-
cational 
environments 
for 
children 
across America. 
Importantly, these shutdowns dis-
proportionately affected children with 
disabilities, minority students, and 
students facing economic hardships. 
America is beyond ready to reopen. 
Today, more than half of Americans 
have been vaccinated, and broad mask

mandates are clearly no longer nec-
essary for most communities. The 
science overwhelmingly demands that 
the restrictions continuing to burden 
our communities be lifted, and efforts 
by liberal politicians to extend these 
mandates only serve to reveal their 
ideological motivations. 
I urge our national, State, and local 
officials 
to 
follow 
the 
science, 
unshackle our economy from these bur-
densome and unnecessary restrictions, 
and reopen our country. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, when 
we start thinking about what is going 
on here in our country with unemploy-
ment, in the week ending May 1, 2021, 
about 16 million people collected unem-
ployment. Now, that is a staggering 
statistic when you realize that over 6.6 
million of those people would not have 
been eligible to receive unemployment 
benefits in a traditional environment. 
But because of the trumped-up and 
boosted-up unemployment benefits the 
Federal Government is sending out, we 
are basically incentivizing people by 
giving them $34,000 a year to not go to 
work, thus creating more and more in-
flation. There is no production so, 
therefore, there are too many dollars 
chasing too few goods. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Alabama (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I certainly appreciate his leadership on 
this and giving us an opportunity to 
speak about small business issues in 
our country. 
Mr. Speaker, as restrictive govern-
ment mandates on Americans have re-
laxed, our economy has begun recov-
ering from the worst of the pandemic. 
Many businesses have reopened their 
doors, and there are now millions of 
new returning jobs and available jobs 
across the Nation. 
Unfortunately, I hear from busi-
nesses large and small across my dis-
trict that Big Government is getting in 
the way of the return of our booming 
prepandemic economy. 
It is a bizarre paradox, but under the 
Biden administration, we are simulta-
neously facing an intense labor short-
age and widespread unemployment at 
the same time, when our economy 
should be thriving back to prepandemic 
levels. Sadly, this is a common story in 
every corner of our country. 
It is clear that the primary driver of 
this problem is federally subsidized un-
employment benefits. In many regions, 
particularly in rural areas, would-be 
job seekers make more staying at 
home than reporting to work. 
Recently, I was speaking to a friend 
of mine, and he called an unemployed 
driver that he was going to hire. The 
unemployed driver’s response was this: 
I am going ride this mule until it 
drops. 
Basically, what he was saying was: I 
am going to take this free money until 
it goes away. 
Many small businesses are facing 
that very same issue. Some businesses 
have even offered cash bonuses to 
interviewees, but small businesses can-
not afford this. 
There are plenty of examples back 
home in my district. For example, in 
Houston County, there are 124 unem-
ployment claims and over 2,000 job 
openings as we speak. In Coffee Coun-
ty, there are 57 unemployment claims 
and 570 job openings, with many more 
coming. In Dale County, there are 47 
unemployment claims yet 350 job post-
ings. 
It is very simple. Small business can-
not compete with government hand-
outs. I am glad that many red States, 
including my great State of Alabama, 
have ended all federally funded pan-
demic unemployment benefits. I hope 
our numbers will improve as a result. 
Removing these payments that were 
meant to be short-term is necessary to 
advance our economic recovery. But 
this is a real problem that betrays the 
Biden 
administration 
and 
congres-
sional Democrats’ fundamental mis-
understanding of what powers an econ-
omy. 
Mr. Speaker, the best welfare pro-
gram in the world is a job, not govern-
ment. I know that many of my Demo-
cratic colleagues agree with me. 
Let’s get Americans back to work by 
empowering workers and removing in-
centives to stay home. Only then can 
we truly reopen this economy. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
disheartened to know that with this 
Federal unemployment stimulus that 
we are sending out around the country, 
although it might solve some short- 
term financial woes, it is creating a 
spiritual poverty in the hearts of men 
and women across this country that I 
believe cannot be described. 
When you start to think about how 
devastating it would be to one’s morale 
and one’s own honor and one’s own self- 
esteem to think that you don’t actu-
ally create anything, you don’t actu-
ally build anything, you are not truly 
benefiting society, it makes me shud-
der to think about how I would feel 
about that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. MANN). 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for hosting this Special 
Order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to intro-
duce you to the newest resident of 
western and central Kansas. She greets 
every store’s patrons at the business 
front door and every farmer at the 
farm gate. She is in the newspaper, on 
the radio, and all over social media. 
She goes by Help Wanted, and you have 
probably met her, too, as she has made 
herself quite popular under President 
Biden’s policies. 
It has been more than a year since 
the pandemic shut down the country. 
America is finally getting back to nor-
mal. Businesses across the country are 
ready to reopen and welcome back cus-
tomers. 
Unfortunately, 
President 
Biden’s bonus, the monthly unemploy-
ment checks being distributed on top 
of the already existing unemployment 
checks, is paying a premium for poten-
tial workers to remain at home rather 
than finding work. 
The data doesn’t lie. There are nearly 
8 million job openings in America right 
now, a new record. Businesses in the 
Big First of Kansas—agriculture, hos-
pitality, food service, manufacturing, 
construction, and healthcare—cannot 
find workers, leading to reduced hours 
or closures to accommodate the staff-
ing shortages. 
b 1745 
Help is wanted at the North Central 
Kansas Hospital, short 50 employees 
and regularly turning away patients as 
the hospital is unable to properly staff 
and serve them. 
Help is wanted in McDonald’s in that 
same north central Kansas town, clos-
ing early each night. 
Christina, the owner of hair salons in 
Garden City, Hays, and Dodge City, 
Kansas, wants help as she temporarily 
shuts down one location, only opens 
another for a few days a week, and 
shortens hours at all three. 
Help is wanted at the ethanol by- 
products plants in south central Kan-
sas, unable to find workers even after 
offering a salary of a $35,000 plus health 
and retirement benefits. 
And PureField Ingredients, a food in-
gredient manufacturer in Russell, Kan-
sas, wants help as they are staffed at 
only 30 percent of their normal levels. 
Mr. Speaker, hear me say this: If you 
can get to work, you should. Do it for 
our local businesses and our State’s 
economy. Do it for your family. Most 
of all, do it for yourself. 
I recently joined fellow Kansas Re-
publicans in urging the Kansas gov-
ernor to opt out of the enhanced unem-
ployment benefits. Additionally, I co-
sponsored the Help Wanted Act, which 
addresses the severe labor shortages 
caused by the Federal unemployment 
policy and the Get Americans Back to 
Work Act, which would shorten the ex-
tension of the pandemic unemployment 
checks. 
It is time to take off the masks, get 
our kids back to school, get our busi-
nesses open, get people back to work, 
and get the country back on track. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 17 minutes remaining. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Colo-
rado (Mrs. BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
excited for Congressman CAWTHORN’s 
leadership on this issue tonight. I 
thank him for making time to address 
the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, there are three people 
who come to mind when I think of peo-
ple who cannot even give their money 
away:

remember when her donations were re-
turned to her by Members of Congress

June 24, 2021 
because they didn’t want to be associ-
ated with her? 
Harvey Weinstein. And Joe Biden. 
Those three cannot even give money 
away. In fact, by July 3, 25 States 
across America will have rejected 
President Biden’s Federal unemploy-
ment benefit bonuses. 
I meet with organizations every day 
that request funds for worthwhile en-
deavors. Sadly, America is $28 trillion 
in debt and can’t afford to spend the 
money on many of these worthy 
causes. But leave it to Joe Biden to try 
to spend money in a way that actually 
hurts our economy and is rejected by 
Republican and Democrat governors 
across our entire country. That is a 
special 
level 
of 
basement 
incom-
petency. 
We have got 9.3 million unfilled jobs. 
And I hear it back home, businesses 
can’t get people back to work because 
they are making more to sit at home 
on the couch. They would rather watch 
Dave Portnoy eat a slice of pizza. But 
then, again, maybe that is not his 
viewers. Maybe it is more of the folks 
sitting back, watching Joy Behar and 
‘‘The View’’ cackle and demonize our 
country and all of our worthwhile ef-
forts to restore dignity in this Nation. 
The 
Biden 
regime 
is 
literally 
incentivizing laziness. But then again, 
they set that example on a regular 
basis, calling it quits in the middle of 
the day. When is the last time the 
President hasn’t called a ‘‘lid’’ before 
his afternoon snack? 
In my home State of Colorado, many 
corporations are offering bonuses that 
small businesses can’t afford. We are 
seeing massive signing bonuses, from 
$10,000 to $30,000 for utility and HVAC 
workers, 
and 
that 
is 
simply 
unsustainable. 
According 
to 
the 
Colorado 
Res-
taurant Association, more than 90 per-
cent of restaurants are having issues 
finding workers. I am one of them. I 
have had employees say, ‘‘I cannot 
work more than 2 days a week. I can-
not exceed 12 hours of work because it 
will cut into my benefits.’’ That is un- 
American. 
Joe Biden is quickly becoming the 
greatest threat to small businesses 
since Fauci’s fraud. While small busi-
nesses across my district and across 
America are struggling to find work-
ers, struggling to stay open, Joe Biden 
is struggling to stay awake. 
I am calling on this administration 
to end these excessive Federal COVID 
payouts 
and 
stop 
disincentivizing 
work. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
MADISON CAWTHORN for his leadership 
on this issue. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her always 
incredibly accurate and fierce com-
ments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT), another 
similarly fierce Congressman. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I cer-
tainly appreciate my friend, Congress-
man CAWTHORN, holding this because it 
is important. 
You know, to some people, it is just 
about, ‘‘Well, it is the economy. It is 
an inconvenience.’’ Well, that is for 
rich people, like the billionaires that 
donated to the current President’s 
campaign. They sure didn’t help the 
former President. 
Well, what are we talking about? We 
are talking about a President that is so 
out of touch. As he has said, ‘‘I keep 
forgetting I am President.’’ It is very 
unfortunate. 
But if you go back to his days as Vice 
President, you find what this Presi-
dent, the current President, was doing 
in the previous administration, and 
these policies are now coming back. 
It ran up the price of oil and gas— 
natural gas, propane. It ran up the 
price of gasoline. And unfortunately, 
for the working people in America, for 
those that haven’t been in Washington 
for 50 years or so—like the current 
President—they are getting strangled 
with debt. They are getting strangled 
with increasing prices because it just 
so happens, we don’t have a lot of elec-
tric 18-wheelers. We don’t have a lot of 
massive electric engines that are pull-
ing countless numbers of cars down the 
train tracks. 
That means every time this Presi-
dent takes another step to raise the 
price of oil—which raises the price of 
gasoline—he is economically crippling 
people that are working, people that 
are on Social Security, people that 
have fixed incomes. They are getting 
hammered. Yeah, it is an inconven-
ience to the mega wealthy that do-
nated to the President, or people like 
here in Congress that are millionaires, 
but it is devastating. 
And I go back to when President 
Biden was Vice President, and a lady 
from Panola County told me, she said, 
‘‘I am 80 years old, and my gas is get-
ting so expensive, I am afraid I am 
going to end up in a home like I was 
born in, where the only energy we had 
was a wood-burning stove.’’ 
And I said, Oh, ma’am, I am so sorry 
to be the bearer of bad news, but if 
Biden and Obama have their way, you 
are not going to be able to even have 
that wood-burning stove you had when 
you were born. You are going to be at 
home without any kind of energy. And 
that is where this President is now 
wanting to go back to. 
We enjoyed the days of cheaper gaso-
line, cheaper energy. America was vi-
brant; and people spent and they went 
out to eat and they bought clothes, and 
it generated jobs. And this President is 
killing those. And he is devastating the 
people on fixed incomes. The people 
that are working and poor, he is dev-
astating them—the people that he is 
supposed to care about. 
Well, it is time for this administra-
tion to think about somebody besides 
themselves and their mega-billionaire 
donors. It is time to think about the 
American people and the damage that 
this administration is doing to them. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Congressman for his re-
marks. 
Mr. Speaker, as I continue to con-
sider that the Democrats’ plan must be 
to 
destroy 
our 
economy 
by 
incentivizing laziness, by incentivizing 
people not going to work, I shake my 
head and say, No, that can’t be true. 
That is just one mistake that they 
made. 
But then when I start to look 
through all the points that I have out-
lined—of the ridiculous tax increases 
on dividends, the tax increases on cap-
ital gains, the tax increases on small 
businesses, the tax increases which will 
increase the cost of living for the mid-
dle class, I am sure that they are try-
ing to destroy our economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BRADY), the most pow-
erful and the most humble man in Con-
gress. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman CAWTHORN for his leader-
ship on behalf of working families, 
small business—of which he is one—for 
getting this economy going again. I 
thank him for allowing me to be part 
of this Special Order. 
Mr. Speaker, when President Biden 
promised to focus on climate change, I 
didn’t realize he meant changing the 
climate of the U.S. economy by cooling 
off the jobs recovery. The President in-
herited a strong recovery, life-saving 
vaccines, a reopening economy, and 
trillions of dollars in COVID stimulus. 
Yet, in his first 5 months of this year, 
America is nearly 550,000 fewer jobs 
than in the last 5 months of 2020 under 
President Trump—550,000 fewer jobs. 
Inflation is running twice as high as 
wage growth. In fact, for Americans, 
their pocketbook, their paycheck has 
actually declined in buying power since 
President Biden took office. 
America’s jobs recovery ought to be 
surging, but instead, April/May reports 
were just disastrous. Main Street busi-
nesses, Congressman CAWTHORN, as you 
said, they are struggling to find work-
ers. 
Labor force participation is back in 
the 1970s. Inflation has hit a 13-year 
high, and a lot of Americans are fearful 
about the impact of rising prices and 
slow growth economy when the sugar 
high from all this COVID stimulus goes 
away, which is exactly what President 
Biden’s budget admits will do. 
This President is sabotaging Amer-
ica’s jobs recovery, with crippling tax 
increases and antibusiness policies that 
hurt working families and Main Street 
businesses and drive U.S. jobs overseas. 
Treasury Secretary Yellen, the other 
day, conceded that just as you heard 
tonight, these lavish Federal employ-
ment bonuses really are hurting Main 
Street and hurting hiring. Thankfully, 
half of American States, including one 
blue State, have opted out of these ben-
efits to help reconnect workers and 
help our economy survive. 
A recent analysis of the Ways and 
Means’ staff shows that Congress has

already approved, for an average fam-
ily of four, where both parents are out 
of work, we have already approved over 
$109,000 in stimulus checks, unemploy-
ment checks, and child checks. 
We were incredibly generous during 
COVID to help people get back on their 
feet, defeat this virus, and move back. 
But the time for emergency spending is 
over; the time for endless government 
checks is over. We cannot become the 
Olive Garden of never-ending govern-
ment checks. It won’t help people re-
build their lives. It won’t help us re-
build the economy. 
Unfortunately, because of these Fed-
eral bonuses on unemployment, we are 
seeing a record 9.3 million unfilled 
jobs. It is hurting Main Street busi-
nesses; they are struggling. And frank-
ly, it will hurt families who are not 
going to be able to reconnect again 
when all these checks run out. And our 
job creators shouldn’t have to compete 
with the Federal Government. 
Instead of helping America get back 
to work, the Biden administration is 
pushing crippling tax hikes that will 
cost us millions of new jobs. I am proud 
to have led, on behalf of President 
Trump in a Republican Congress, the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that reduced tax 
cuts across the board, or reduced taxes 
across the board, redesigned our Tax 
Code so American businesses could 
compete and win anywhere in the 
world. 
It made America the most competi-
tive economy on the planet, lifted mil-
lions of Americans out of poverty, and 
stopped U.S. businesses from moving 
overseas. But now, we face a big risk. 
President Biden’s insistence on repeal-
ing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will cost 
6 million U.S. jobs. For that family of 
four, middle class, making maybe 
$73,000 a year, it will rob their family 
budget of over $20,000 over time. 
The attack on American energy will 
cut jobs by 1.5 million U.S. jobs and re-
pealing stepped-up basis on family 
farms will cost us another 1 million 
jobs over 12 years. 
Congressman CAWTHORN’s efforts to 
lead 
commonsense 
proposals, 
stop 
these crippling tax increases, and get 
the economy back on task is exactly 
what our country needs today. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank him for letting 
me join him. 
b 1800 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congressman BRADY for his lead-
ership on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Mr. Speaker, I think with everything 
that has been said from all of these 
Representatives from all over the coun-
try, each of them representing nearly 
730,000 people, I believe it is overly and 
abundantly clear that it is time to end 
the emergency spending. It is time to 
end the trumped-up unemployment 
checks, which are incentivizing lazi-
ness. It is time to end government- 
mandated joblessness in America. 
There is a labor shortage in this 
country, and if we don’t end it, we will 
see inflation, the likes of which our 
country has never seen before, and I 
don’t know if we will be able to recover 
from that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
VIRTUE SIGNALING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, this 
evening, I am going to try to do some-
thing that is a little bit different, and 
parts of it are going to be incredibly 
annoying. I am going to hurt some feel-
ings, but my theme is actually very 
simple. 
There are general solutions to so 
many of the things we consider prob-
lems, but we are going to have to deal 
with something, and it is a true prob-
lem around this place. And that is, I 
am going to use the word ‘‘virtue sig-
naling’’ and sort of folklore. 
We sometimes know what we know, 
but the fact of the matter is that tech-
nology, science, all of what we were 
told was wrong, yet we can’t get it out 
of our heads, or, as a society, we care 
more about the symbolism than actu-
ally curing the problem. And I really 
do believe if we could embrace that 
thing called a calculator, math, think-
ing, science, there are some amazingly 
good things we could do. 
But, first, we got to step up and 
admit that we have been making up a 
lot of crap. And that is me being slight-
ly on the vulgar side. But it is a frus-
tration I have where often I see our 
speeches behind these microphones, 
and we are virtue signaling because 
that is often what is expected from our 
voters. At least we think that is what 
is expected, but I bet you our voters 
would be elated if we would actually 
give them the truth and then show 
them the math. 
I am going to show a couple of things 
to first set up my argument, and then 
walk through a couple things that I 
think are incredibly optimistic for our 
future as a country, but maybe even 
the entire world. 
So, first off, let’s just use this. I have 
done versions of this before, but it is 
important as a thought experiment. 
Do you care about plastic in the 
ocean? 
I think everyone in America cares 
about plastic in the ocean. Except we 
have a small problem. We do this vir-
tue signaling of let’s ban plastic 
straws. But the fact of the matter is, 
the data says that straws that come 
from North America don’t end up in 
the ocean. We do actually an amaz-
ingly good job grabbing our waste and 
putting it in the landfills or incin-
erating or taking care of it. But if you 
actually look at the real math, 90 per-
cent of the plastic in the world’s 
oceans comes from 10 rivers: 8 in Asia, 
2 in Africa. 
If you actually gave a darn about 
plastic in the ocean, what would you 
do? 
You would actually go to those 10 
rivers—8 in Asia, 2 in Africa—and ei-
ther add value, use our technical as-
sistance, use our foreign aid, and go 
and deal with the plastic in the ocean. 
But, instead, we give speeches here, 
we award, we allot cities like D.C. that 
ban plastic straws. That is pure virtue 
signaling. It doesn’t actually do any-
thing, yet we parade around like we did 
something. 
Instead, this body could actually 
have an incredible impact on plastic in 
the ocean. Go to the 10 rivers that are 
90 percent of the plastic, and actually 
get our foreign aid, our technical aid, 
even some economic incentives to cap-
ture that plastic and stop sticking it 
into rivers that flow into the ocean. It 
is a simple example of the virtue sig-
naling that actually warps real envi-
ronmental policy. 
Here is one that is going to drive 
some people crazy. 
What would happen if I came to you 
and said the entire environmental im-
pact of that cloth cotton bag you carry 
to the grocery store, you have to use 
7,100 times to basically equal the plas-
tic bags that are produced out of nat-
ural gas? 
Yet we walk around with our little 
plastic bags when we walk into the 
Trader Joe’s and those things, you 
know, proudly showing, hey, I care 
about the environment. But the math— 
that is not the science. 
If we are going to make public policy, 
how does this body, and not only Con-
gress, but our city councils, our county 
governments, our State legislatures, 
how do we stop making public policy 
that is virtue signaling, and the math 
is the math? 
We have this incredible report, de-
tailed. It came out of, I think, Demark. 
It was looking at the environmental 
impact. It turns out those crappy little 
plastic bags that are banned in so 
many of our cities were less environ-
mentally impactful than the cotton 
bags we are walking around with, be-
cause those cotton ones you have to 
use 7,100 times to actually have the 
same environmental impact. 
Another one that is going on around 
the country right now is let’s ban nat-
ural gas for cook stoves and heating in 
homes. Except if you actually do the 
math of burning natural gas to make 
steam, to turn the turbine, to make 
electricity, it actually is environ-
mentally substantially better to use 
natural gas in your home. And there 
are lots of really good studies and data 
on this. 
But, once again, it is sort of this 
urban folklore, it is virtue signaling to 
say my city council is going to ban 
natural gas from people being able to 
cook with. Aren’t I doing something 
wonderful for the environment?

But it turns out, no, you are not. We 
have got to stop doing this. 
So there is actually some other real-
ly interesting ones. 
So how many out there did we watch 
on the cable news shows after the func-
tion of the canceling of the Keystone 
pipeline? 
Now, as Republicans, we all talked 
about the jobs lost. On the left, they 
are talking about the environmental 
benefit of stopping that pipeline. 
Well, first, let’s deal with the reality. 
Those hydrocarbons are going some-
where. They are going to be cracked 
somewhere, turned into distillates or 
fuels. And they are refined in southeast 
Asia or refined in Louisiana or Texas. 
They are going to be refined. So let’s 
just do the math on the transportation. 
It turns out the Keystone pipeline 
has dramatically less carbon impact 
than sticking it in the rail, sticking it 
into the rail pipeline attachment, or 
sticking it in rail or pipeline and put-
ting it on the coast and shipping it out 
to southeast Asia. Just the shipping 
part. 
If you actually cared about the ac-
tual math of the environmental impact 
of the Keystone pipeline, you would 
have supported the pipeline, but that 
wasn’t the virtue signaling that came 
from the environmental community. 
And being someone who genuinely 
cares a lot about the actual math, you 
know, as those of us who try to do the 
math of what is the actual impacts in 
global warming, and what is actually 
the folklore, what is make-believe, 
what is real, we got to stop doing this. 
And I know we love the political 
wedges, saying, well, they supported 
this and we supported the union work-
ers. 
How do you get some people around 
the table to use a calculator, and say, 
well, it turns out, whether you like hy-
drocarbons or not, the pipeline turns 
out to have a less environmental load 
than canceling it does because now we 
are going to stick it in railcars, now we 
are going to ship it to other parts of 
the world? 
And I haven’t even done the math on 
other refineries from other parts of 
world that have dramatically less envi-
ronmental standards when cracking 
carbon chains. 
So here is another one. This one ac-
tually is both hopeful, but we are going 
to have to start to think a little more 
creatively. So here is my setup. Half of 
the noncarbon-emitting electricity in 
the United States—actually, I think it 
is slightly more than half—comes from 
baseload nuclear. 
We have a massive amount of our 
baseload nuclear that is coming off 
line. If you actually do the math of the 
amount of nuclear that is coming off 
line, our renewable baseload cannot 
keep close to keeping up. So there are 
a lot of charts. And I have done this on 
the floor before, showing that as all 
this nuclear comes off line, carbon 
emissions in the United States on elec-
trical generation is going up. 
Even though we have all this renew-
able, this wind, this photovoltaic, these 
things, geothermal hitting the market, 
it doesn’t produce enough power to 
keep up with the nuclear coming off. 
And the argument for much of the nu-
clear is, well, think, they have to do 
uranium mines, think of this, think of 
that. 
Well, what if I came to you and said, 
baseload nuclear is absolutely critical 
to the reliability of the grid and all of 
those other things, and it is noncarbon- 
emitting, and we have the technology 
today? 
I have done a whole presentation on 
this in detail. Basically, we can extract 
uranium from sea water now. We do 
this. We have the technology. 
But it is even better than that. We 
have a Nobel Prize physicist who has 
been writing papers, articles, saying 
that, within a decade, they believe 
high-pulse lasers—and, look, I have 
done my best to read the scientific ar-
ticles a couple times. Some of it is be-
yond even—you know, when you are 
having to read an article and have a 
dictionary close by to look up some of 
the technical. But his premise is we 
can use high-pulse lasers to break up 
and make inert spent nuclear fuels. 
So his theme is, say, in 30 minutes I 
could take something that would have 
lasted a million years, and in 30 min-
utes I can make it inert. If this is true, 
it is the virtuous cycle on nuclear en-
ergy. And you all know, because this 
place has actually helped fund it, the 
new compact nuclear reactor design 
that is dramatically safer, dramati-
cally less intrusive, and much more ef-
ficient. 
So think of that. I can extract my 
uranium from rain water, the new nu-
clear reactor design, and now we have 
a way of instead of sticking it in Yucca 
Mountain, we can actually break up 
that spent nuclear fuel. 
This should be exciting. There should 
be people on the left and the right 
going, it is worth sticking some money 
into this type of technology. But it 
doesn’t fit our political folklore around 
here of, well, we can’t have nuclear be-
cause of this. 
But we claim we give a darn about 
science and technology, when we have 
some of our smartest people in our so-
ciety saying, we think we have a solu-
tion. 
Why don’t we actually invest in 
those solutions instead of investing in 
the things that we keep doing around 
here, where we are investing in tech-
nology that is already decades out of 
date? 
So part of my fixation is—the reason 
I bring this chart is there was a Mem-
ber, I think, just last week that was on 
the floor, and she alluded—someone 
from 
the 
left—that 
the 
economic 
growth basically led to more green-
house gases, more environmental im-
pact. But that is not actually the 
math. 
We are still working on some of the 
data for 2019, but if you look at 2018 
and what we are preliminarily seeing 
in 2019, you know, greenhouse gases, 
the environmental impact, went down, 
even though GDP went up dramati-
cally. 
b 1815 
Why? Because what we did in the tax 
reform created this huge incentive to 
invest in the latest technology. 
Mr. Speaker, you can go buy that 
new technology, and you could 100 per-
cent expense it. It turned out we were 
able to create a moment where eco-
nomic growth took off, jobs took off, 
and the working poor got dramatically 
less poor. 
It was the first couple of years in 
modern economic times when income 
inequality shrank, and it shrank be-
cause there was opportunity. People’s 
labor became valuable. And, oh, guess 
what? Our environment got cleaner 
while growing the economy. We have 
the proof. We have the data. 
Isn’t this the Holy Grail that both 
the left and the right claim they care 
about? Except the difference is it didn’t 
require a command-and-control econ-
omy. It just required really good tech-
nology and the incentive to invest in 
that technology, and it made a dif-
ference. 
The other argument we come to the 
microphone and talk about is that 
there are incredible technology disrup-
tions on the cusp. If we could get our 
heads around them, then we could 
make some amazing things happen. If 
we don’t get our heads around them, 
then it is going to create economic dis-
ruptions. It is going to hurt a lot of 
people. We need to understand these. 
Over the last couple of years, I have 
done some presentations on something 
called synthetic biology. The reality is 
it is incredibly hopeful for humanity. 
It also has some really scary stuff. 
Mark my words, we will know in about 
a decade whether I am right. I believe 
this piece of technology here will be 
the single most disruptive technology 
of our lifetimes. 
Here is one: What if I came to you to-
morrow and said that we can take 
plants and make them from the mid-20s 
to 52 percent more efficient in their 
growth by tweaking? 
Now, I am not a plant biologist, but 
I have gone out of my way to read 
every article of the University of Illi-
nois and those who are producing. 
Mr. Speaker, you remember your 
high school biology class? Let’s see if I 
can get this right. You had a plant cell, 
and it really, really, really wants a car-
bon molecule to turn it into a sugar to 
grow. But a quirk of nature, it grabs an 
oxygen molecule. It now has to spend 
all this energy to purge that and then 
turn around and grab the carbon so it 
can grow. 
What happens if every time it grabs 
the right molecule to maximize its 
growth? 
Okay, it looks like we would now 
know how to tweak commodity crops 
and other crops to always grab that 
carbon molecule and grow.

Now, I need the thought experiment. 
I need the people around here who all 
believe we are geniuses to think this 
through. 
What happens tomorrow to the value 
of farmland? What happens to our 
trade relationships with the world 
where it is our agriculture muscle as a 
country when other countries are now 
able to grow 40 percent more soybeans 
on the same land, same water, same 
fertilizer? 
Think about the value of agricultural 
land. What is the value of agricultural 
debt? 
This is coming. This technology is 
here. 
Are we preparing, thinking what it 
means? What type of opportunity does 
this mean? Because the world already 
produces more food than it needs. Our 
real problem is distribution. 
What happens if tomorrow much of 
the agriculture in the world could 
produce 40 percent more on the same 
piece of land? 
There is also a quirky piece of math 
to think about, and that is world agri-
culture is estimated to produce about 
2.2 times more greenhouse gases than 
every car on Earth. Mr. Speaker, if you 
were an optimistic utopian, then this 
technology is functionally equal to re-
moving every car off the face of the 
Earth. Yes, that is the positive. But 
you also have to be ready to deal with 
the disruption it means economically. 
And it is coming. 
But yet have we ever had a hearing? 
Have we ever had a discussion? Have 
we ever invited the scientists to think 
about and talk us through and have us 
start to plan economically about what 
it means? 
Or are we just going to do what this 
place does, which is to avoid difficult 
discussions until it kicks us in the 
head? 
Let’s talk about healthcare a bit. Ob-
viously, that is my fixation. I come 
here every week and try to talk about 
ways we can change. 
Before we do this, here is a simple 
thought experiment. Well, it is not a 
thought experiment. It is the facts. 
ObamaCare, the ACA, was a financing 
bill. It is who gets subsidized, who gets 
to pay. Our Republican alternative is a 
financing bill. It is who has to pay, who 
gets subsidized. Medicare for All is a fi-
nancing 
bill. 
They 
don’t 
actually 
change what the underlying cost of de-
livering healthcare is. They just shift 
around who gets to pay. 
This debate here has to become what 
we pay. What technology and what 
models are we going to adopt that 
change 
the 
cost 
of 
delivering 
healthcare? 
What happens if I come to you, Mr. 
Speaker, and say that 5 percent of our 
brothers and sisters have preexisting 
conditions, that they are suffering, and 
that they are also over half of the 
healthcare costs of this Nation? 
Wouldn’t it be much smarter, much 
more caring, much more empathetic, 
and much more compassionate to fix-
ate on that 5 percent who are suffering 
and say that we are going to do every-
thing we can to push technologies, to 
push the caring, and to push disruption 
in biologics to cure or minimize the 
suffering of the 5 percent? We are liv-
ing examples of this. 
Do you remember, Mr. Speaker, only 
a few years ago the cost curve we were 
all looking at in regard to hepatitis C? 
Do you remember, hep C, you carry the 
virus in you for sometimes decades and 
decades and decades, Mr. Speaker. 
Then, all of a sudden, Mr. Speaker, you 
need a liver transplant. 
We were looking at numbers that 
were going to essentially bankrupt the 
VA with all the liver transplant costs. 
Then what happened? A cure was deliv-
ered. It was really expensive at the be-
ginning, but it was dramatically less 
expensive than somebody having a 
failed liver. 
We are living in the time of disrup-
tions, and we should promote those as 
a Congress and help many of us who 
are panicked over the debt but also 
really care about eliminating suffering. 
It is one of the reasons I have an ab-
solute fixation. If you really wanted to 
help people of color, Mr. Speaker, and 
my Tribal communities—I represent 
some of the populations with the high-
est diabetes in the world, some of my 
Native Americans—how about an Oper-
ation Warp Speed on diabetes? 
Remember, Mr. Speaker, in the next 
30 years, in today’s dollars, inflation- 
adjusted dollars, we have $121 trillion 
of debt coming at us. Sixty-seven per-
cent of that is just Medicare. 
The single biggest thing you could 
actually do, Mr. Speaker, the single 
thing, the biggest thing to deal with 
future debt that buries and destroys 
the future for my 5-year-old daughter, 
believe it or not, is a cure for diabetes 
because 31 percent of the Medicare fu-
ture is just diabetes. 
One of the most loving and compas-
sionate things we could do as conserv-
atives and liberals is say that we are 
going to do—call it whatever you want, 
Mr. Speaker. I want to call it operation 
warp speed because we are close to the 
cusp of major revolutionary treat-
ments for type 1, the ability to do stem 
cells to the pancreas. There are some 
incredible journal articles out just in 
the last 6 weeks on that. 
Some of that can also be used for 
type 2. Type 2 is more complicated be-
cause it is both the autoimmune but 
also lifestyle and having a discussion 
of, as a people, as a society, are we 
going 
to 
continue 
to 
fund 
really 
unhealthy foods? Are we going to con-
tinue to do farm supports in a way 
where we grow only a handful of crops 
instead of being able to have a wide va-
riety of different things? 
These are really disruptive concepts, 
and they would be really compas-
sionate and loving for everyone if we 
took really, really, really seriously 
what diabetes means to this Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, if you really want to 
deal with the reality, don’t come to 
these microphones and give a speech 
about how COVID affected certain pop-
ulations much more dramatically and 
then, in the next breath, not talk about 
the fact that the curve is absolutely 
sympathetic with those same popu-
lations having diabetes. The math is 
the math. 
Mr. Speaker, if you really give a darn 
about people, let’s solve that because it 
is the single biggest thing you and I 
could do to take on future sovereign 
debt. 
The other one that drives me insane, 
because this is the one you and I could 
have the most impact on in the short-
est period of time, Mr. Speaker, 16 per-
cent of U.S. healthcare costs, so about 
$528 billion every single year, is people 
not taking their pharmaceuticals prop-
erly. 
I forget to take my hypertension 
medicine, and I have a stroke. I don’t 
take my statin for my cholesterol, and 
all of a sudden, I have to get a stent. 
Someone doesn’t maintain use of tech-
nology and stay on their insulin prop-
erly. 
We have lots of data now. This is a 
really well-vetted number. Sixteen per-
cent of U.S. healthcare is our not tak-
ing or taking improperly our pharma-
ceuticals. 
Well, it turns out there is a tech-
nology solution to that: the little pill 
cap that talks to you. 
How about for grandma, who has to 
take some pills in the morning and 
then in the evening, we have the tech-
nology that drops the pills and talks to 
her. It turns out this technology could 
save not $100 billion but a few hundred 
billion dollars every year. 
Mr. Speaker, you talk about wanting 
to have an impact on healthcare and 
make people healthier and deal with 
those 5 percent of our brothers and sis-
ters who have chronic conditions that 
are 50-plus percent of our healthcare. 
There are things you could do tomor-
row that would have an impact on soci-
ety before the year is over. 
We made a proposal last year or just 
before the pandemic of super-high- 
value pharmaceuticals. Why don’t we 
put them in sterile blister-pack-type 
containers and make them recyclable? 
I had a number of Members here, par-
ticularly one who is my friend on the 
left, who came to me and said: Oh, that 
is yucky. 
But I remember 10 years ago, when 
my mother was in hospice care, and 
one of the nurses there—she was a fam-
ily friend—took me in the back. We 
were talking, and she showed me this 
barrel. She said: You know, there is 
probably $10,000 to $20,000 of pharma-
ceuticals in there that I am throwing 
away from our patients who have 
passed away in the last few weeks. 
That got me thinking: Is this ration-
al? 
Besides the fact that the small mol-
ecules end up in your water supply, Mr.

into, Mr. Speaker, that instantly tells 
you that you have the flu that could 
bounce off your phone with its medical 
records and say that you are not aller-
gic to this antiviral and instantly 
order that antiviral, and you would be 
healthier. 
But that process is illegal under the 
laws that we passed here. The Social 
Security Act says you are going to 
need a doctor, Mr. Speaker, the reim-
bursement from HHS, our State licens-
ing rules. 
Are we ready to stop living in virtue 
signaling, stop living in folklore, and 
start looking at the actual math? 
Yes, we are going to get lobbied like 
crazy from groups that we are dis-
rupting 
their 
business model. But 
wouldn’t it be neat to say: This isn’t 
Republican, and it is not Democrat. It 
is technology. 
Let’s make a difference. It is doable, 
and it is here. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

INFLATION THREATENS FUTURE 
OF AMERICA’S ECONOMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to 
discuss the threat of inflation on the 
future of America’s economy. 
In other places around the Capitol at 
this time, people are discussing a new 
infrastructure bill. They are talking 
about a new 2022 budget. People talk 
about the importance of not raising 
taxes on the poor. Earlier this year, 
they rejected a possible gas tax hike 
because it would have fallen dispropor-
tionately on the poor. But there is no 
surer way to penalize the poor of this 
country than to inflate the currency. 
b 1830 
Look at where we already are on 
other commodities: aluminum, lumber, 
soybeans. 
How are our young people going to 
buy that first house? 
The cost of food, and even prepared 
food, is going up. 
Why is that? 
Take a look at the charts showing 
the amount of currency in banks. M1 
currency, which is up by a factor of 5 
times; not 5 percent, not 50 percent, 
but a factor of 5 times in the last year. 
Look at M2, up 30 percent in the last 
year. Of course, the cost of commod-
ities is spiraling through the roof. 
America is a wealthy country be-
cause our dollar has been the envy of 
the world. But this Congress has not 
been acting like a Congress with the 
world’s reserve currency. This Congress 
is acting like the Congress of a country 
such as Zimbabwe, and we all saw on 
TV what happened there. 
It is time for the people who are not 
only negotiating the infrastructure 
bill, but negotiating the 2022 budget, to 
take into account what they are doing 
to the poor of this country or the mid-
dle class of this country as they inevi-
tably stoke inflation. 
Think of the people on almost fixed 
incomes, on Social Security. Think of 
all of the people on pensions, who are 
locked in at $15,000 a year, $20,000 a 
year, and think how their purchasing 
power will go down if we continue 
along this path, including the bloated 
budget proposed by President Biden 
himself. 
We must rein in our spending. The 
poor and the middle class are the ones 
paying the price. I beg the negotiators 
to stand up to the people who think 
that printing hundreds of millions of 
dollars more in the infrastructure bill 
or passing this bill with an excessively 
high spending increase in the regular 
2022 budget will not affect the average 
guy. It is going to affect the average 
guy. It is going to erode their savings. 
It will shrink the values of their pen-
sion or Social Security. It will be a 
true disaster for middle class and poor 
America. 
QUESTIONS FOR VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS ON HER 
TRIP TO THE SOUTHERN BORDER 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to, 
first of all, applaud the fact that Vice 
President HARRIS is going to the south-
ern border. I don’t know whether she 
has done this on her own accord or 
with prodding from President Biden, 
but, either way, I am glad she is going 
down there. 
I have been to the border several 
times this year. I think it is very dif-
ficult to learn all you should learn in 
one day. There are nine sectors to the 
southern border, and what you learn in 
El Paso is very different from what you 
learn in Yuma. It is very different from 
what you learn in San Diego. It is very 
different from what you learn in 
McAllen. 
Nevertheless, I am glad she is going 
down there, and I would like to make 
some suggestions for her, which we will 
forward to her as questions she should 
be asking or things she should learn 
about the southern border. 
First of all, Madam Vice President, 
the 
Migrant 
Protection 
Protocols 
caused the Mexican Government to 
hold asylum seekers on the south side 
of the border. President Biden has 
since walked away from the protocol. 
What effect did the nullification of this 
agreement with the Mexican Govern-
ment have on the number of people 
crossing the border? And what effect 
will it have on the number of people 
from around the world who will come 
here in the future? 
Secondly, we also had Asylum Coop-
erative 
Agreements 
with 
Central 
American countries that held people 
south not only of the Mexican border, 
but south of Mexico. What effect did 
President Biden’s ending the Asylum 
Cooperative Agreements with Central 
American countries have on the num-
ber of people entering southern Mex-
ico? And what effect will this have on 
people coming through Mexico from 
around the world? 
Third, I want the Vice President to 
find out what type of drugs are coming 
across the border. Has there been a 
change in the fraction of marijuana 
versus fentanyl coming across the 
southern 
border? 
How 
lethal 
is 
fentanyl? 
Fourth, I hear horrific stories from 
the border guards as far as women and 
girls being sexually assaulted on their 
journey through Mexico. What percent-
age of women and girls are sexually as-
saulted as they travel to enter the U.S. 
illegally? 
Fifth, you will find when you get 
down there, Madam Vice President, 
that families consist of adults and chil-
dren, find out how many times a family 
supposedly shows up and the Border 
Patrol suspects that the children are 
not part of the family, and what hap-
pens when DNA tests are given to chil-
dren and the adults they are entering 
with? 
Six, how much does it cost for the 
migrants to enter our country? And by 
that, I mean how much are they having 
to pay the drug cartels? I think you 
will find different numbers for the cost 
of a Mexican, a Central American, a 
Brazilian, and Asian. But you should 
ask these questions when you are on 
the southern border. 
Seventh, got-aways are when people 
come in this country and have no con-
tact with the Border Patrol. As the 
Border Patrol must spend time doing 
paperwork with the huge increase of 
unaccompanied children coming here, 
has the number of got-aways, increased 
from this time last year to now? 
Eighth, I think you should look at 
some demonstrations with some dogs. 
How effective are dogs in looking for 
fentanyl and other drugs, and should 
we be purchasing more dogs in this 
budget? 
Next, I ask you to look at the border 
wall which you will find is 30-feet high 
and 8 feet underground. Talk to the 
Border Patrol, talk to ICE, talk to 
local law enforcement, and see what 
they think of that wall and whether it 
would be worth expanding it or wheth-
er your administration was right to 
just cut it off with equipment just sit-
ting in the open sun. 
Next, Madam Vice President, you 
said you want to focus on the root 
causes from countries whose citizens 
are coming here. I ask you to find out 
what countries are sending its citizens 
here and which countries have sent a 
significant amount of people. I think 
you are going to be surprised that it is 
not just a matter of people coming here 
from Mexico or Honduras. They are 
coming from around the world, but you 
should report back on the number of 
countries you would have to improve 
to prevent the demand from going up 
further to come here. 
Next, in the opinion of the Border 
Patrol, have you and the President’s 
public comments during your campaign

June 24, 2021 
and after the campaign had an impact 
on the number of people coming to this 
country? I would ask members of the 
Border Patrol. 
The twelfth question is: Have your 
comments, as well as the fact that you 
have decided to take 13 weeks before 
you decided to go to the border, had an 
effect on the morale of the Border Pa-
trol? You and the President have not 
visited the border, which I think is the 
biggest crisis facing your administra-
tion since you were both sworn in. 
What do they think about that, and 
what can you do to make up any 
dispiriting of these brave people due to 
your inaction to this point? 
Thirteen, and one of the scary things 
that I don’t think we have talked 
about: Ask the Border Patrol if they 
keep track of how many people drown 
in the Rio Grande trying to come here 
every year, and how many people dehy-
drate in the Arizona or New Mexico or 
Texas deserts as they try to come here. 
And, finally, look for what policies 
we can implement from Washington to 
make your job of securing the border 
easier. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct remarks to 
the Chair and not a perceived audience.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JUNE 24, 2021 
No. 110 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable JACKY 
ROSEN, a Senator from the State of Ne-
vada. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, guide our lawmakers 
through this day with Your higher wis-
dom. Help them to walk with integrity, 
reverence, and humility. May they 
refuse to deviate from the path that 
honors You. 
Lord, open their minds to Your truth 
as You use them to bring healing to 
our Nation and world. May they submit 
their lives to the light of Your pre-
cepts, replacing fear with faith, false-
hood with truth, and hate with love. 
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, June 24, 2021. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable JACKY ROSEN, a Sen-
ator from the State of Nevada, to perform 
the duties of the Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Ms. ROSEN thereupon assumed the 
Chair as Acting President pro tempore.

pore. Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-

f 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. First, I have a mes-
sage for the information of the Senate. 
I understand there is an important 
meeting at the White House this morn-
ing that several Members are attend-
ing. So in order to accommodate them, 
the first vote will start at 10:45 a.m., 
not at 11 a.m., and we are going to have 
to move quickly on that vote so people 
can get their votes done and get to the 
White House. 
So, Members, please take notice. 
f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
before we reach the conclusion of the 
June work period, the Senate will con-
firm yet another one of President 
Biden’s highly qualified nominees to 
the Federal Bench: Candace Jackson- 
Akiwumi to serve on the Seventh Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals. 
A graduate of Princeton and Yale 
Law School, Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi left 
a career at a big law firm to work for 
10 years as a Federal defender in Illi-
nois. She was a voice in the courtroom 
for Americans who often had no one 
else to speak for them: the mentally 
ill, folks who could not afford an attor-
ney. 
We have plenty of former prosecutors 
and corporate lawyers on the bench. 
Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi would bring a 
sorely needed perspective. The more 
our courts reflect our country as a 
whole, the more faith Americans will 
have in the equal application of the 
law. 
Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi will make an 
outstanding addition to the Seventh 
Circuit, and I urge all my colleagues to 
vote for her later today. 
Now, I want to reflect for a moment 
on the pace of judicial nominations in 
the Democratic-led Senate so far this 
year. 
Typically, 
the 
first 
several 
months of a new administration don’t 
feature a ton of judicial nominations. 
New Presidents often have ambitious 
legislative agendas, and it takes a lot 
of time for a new President to make 
appointments and to get them to go 
through all of the background checks 
and for the Judiciary Committee to ad-
vance nominees to the floor. So in ad-
ministrations past, the first 6 months 
are a fallow period for judges. 
For all the focus that the Republican 
leader put on judges during the pre-
vious administration, the Senate only 
confirmed one—one district or circuit 
judge—before July 4 in the first year of 
Donald Trump’s Presidency. By the end 
of today, the Senate will have con-
firmed more judges this week than in 
all 6 months of Donald Trump’s first 
year in office. 
In fact, with the confirmations this 
week, the Senate will have confirmed 
more district and circuit court judges 
to the Federal bench in the first 6 
months of President Biden’s first year 
than any other administration in 50 
years. 
Let me say that again so people hear, 
because I know there is a lot of worry— 
justified—that President Trump shifted 
the bench so far to the right that we 
need to rebalance it, and we need to 
make that a very high priority. Well, 
we have. After the confirmation of Ms. 
Jackson-Akiwumi, 
the 
Senate 
will 
have confirmed more district and cir-
cuit court judges in the first year of a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4736 
June 24, 2021 
Presidency in over 50 years, including 
the first 6 months of Donald Trump’s 
Presidency. So we are making good, 
good progress, and we have done it 
with judges who break the Federal 
mold—Federal defenders, civil rights 
lawyers, voting rights lawyers, the 
first Native American judge, the first 
Muslim American judge. Those make 
me proud that we are constantly ex-
panding who in America can get to the 
bench. All of these folks have one thing 
in common: They are individuals of im-
peccable character and impressive cre-
dentials. 
The Democratic Senate is restoring 
balance to the judiciary with highly 
qualified, mainstream jurists who re-
flect the diversity of this country, and 
we are going to keep at it when we 
come back in July and beyond. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
another matter, infrastructure, our Na-
tion’s economic potential depends on 
the quality of its infrastructure. Our 
businesses, workers, farmers, manufac-
turers—you name it—they all depend 
on the infrastructure networks that 
connect our country. And here in the 
21st 
century, 
electrical 
grids 
and 
broadband internet access are just as 
important as roads, bridges, and high-
ways. 
But it has been decades—decades— 
since Congress passed a significant, 
stand-alone bill to increase Federal in-
vestment in infrastructure. Our roads 
and bridges are crumbling. Children 
learn in dilapidated schools. Large 
swaths of rural America lack access to 
broadband internet. 
We need to refashion much of our in-
frastructure to address the existential 
threat of climate change. That is so 
important and essential to the over-
whelming majority of my caucus. So 
the Senate, this summer, is going to 
move forward on multiple legislative 
proposals to make historic investments 
in our Nation’s infrastructure. And 
when we say that, we mean both types 
of infrastructure: the concrete and 
steel and that kind of infrastructure— 
the physical infrastructure—but also 
the human infrastructure, so that we 
can maximize the potential of our peo-
ple which, after all, is our greatest re-
source—our greatest resource. 
So we are pursuing on multiple—we 
are making two tracks. The first legis-
lative track is bipartisan. The second 
track will incorporate elements of the 
American jobs and families plan and 
will be done through the budget proc-
ess, which must pass even if it is not 
bipartisan. 
There has been significant progress 
this week on both tracks. 
Yesterday, a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators announced that they had reached 
an agreement in concept for a bipar-
tisan infrastructure proposal, and I 
have encouraged them to move for-
ward. But I made it explicit to every 
one of them, together and separately, 
that we have to pass both tracks to-
gether. 
Speaker PELOSI
and I were made 
aware of the concepts of the agree-
ment—the bipartisan agreement—last 
night. And while we have yet to see the 
details, 
I 
am 
encouraged 
by 
the 
progress the bipartisan group of Sen-
ators has made. I have supported these 
bipartisan discussions from the begin-
ning, and I want to thank my col-
leagues for their hard work. 
Senate Democrats have also made 
significant progress on preparing a 
budget resolution. 
These two efforts are tied together. 
Let me make that clear. The bipartisan 
infrastructure bill and the budget reso-
lution are tied together. If the Senate 
is going to move forward with a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill, we must also 
move forward on a budget resolution, 
as well. I have discussed this with 
President Biden directly on several oc-
casions, and he agrees that we cannot 
do one without the other, and he has 
let the participants know that. Speak-
er PELOSI agrees that we cannot do one 
without the other. All parties under-
stand that we won’t get enough votes 
to pass either unless we have enough 
votes to pass both. 
When the Senate returns in July, it 
will be time to take the next step and 
hold the first votes on the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill on the floor of the 
Senate. Senators should also be pre-
pared to consider a budget resolution 
that will clear the way for the budget 
reconciliation bill as soon as possible. 
The bottom line is, both tracks need 
to make progress concurrently. 
This is about building a foundation 
for the United States to remain the 
world economic leader in the 21st cen-
tury. We are the largest economy in 
the world, but our infrastructure ranks 
13th, behind South Korea, Germany, 
Japan, and even the United Arab Emir-
ates. 
There isn’t a community in this 
country without some glaring infra-
structure challenge—certainly, in my 
home State of New York. If America is 
going to prosper in the 21st century, we 
can’t have infrastructure that is stuck 
in the last century. 
We need to pass major investment in 
infrastructure, 
both 
physical 
and 
human, this year, and I look forward to 
holding the first votes when we return 
for the July work period. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Morning business is closed. 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
GROWING CLIMATE SOLUTIONS 
ACT OF 2021 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to the consider-
ation of S. 1251, which the clerk will re-
port. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1251) to authorize the Secretary 
of Agriculture to develop a program to re-
duce barriers to entry for farmers, ranchers, 
and private forest landowners in certain vol-
untary markets, and for other purposes. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2119 
(Purpose: In the nature of a sub-
stitute.) 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I call up 
my amendment No. 2119 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will report the amend-
ment by number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Utah [Mr. LEE] proposes 
an amendment numbered 2119. 
(The amendment is printed in the 
RECORD of June 22, 2021, under ‘‘Text of 
Amendments.’’) 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, as Amer-
icans want to buy more clean and 
green products, the market has been 
finding solutions to provide those prod-
ucts. 
The Growing Climate Solutions Act 
before us, however, will not. Though it 
seeks to aid the carbon credit market, 
it could ultimately serve only to quell 
it. Let’s just take a look at how the 
carbon credit market currently works. 
Farmers, ranchers, and private for-
esters develop these credits to sell by 
taking actions to either limit their 
greenhouse gas emissions or to capture 
greenhouse gas emissions from the at-
mosphere. They work with technical 
assistance providers to know how to do 
so and then with third-party verifiers 
who make sure that the proper stand-
ards are met. Companies can then pur-
chase the credits to offset their carbon 
emissions, and they can also sell un-
used credits to other companies want-
ing to offset their carbon emissions. It 
is a voluntary exchange and an exam-
ple of the market working as it ought 
to work. 
As the demand for these credits 
grows, more farmers, ranchers, and for-
esters would explore this revenue-gen-
erating market, more technical assist-
ance providers and third-party verifiers 
would emerge, and potentially innova-
tion would occur with new types of en-
tities emerging to create and sell car-
bon credits beyond these initial three. 
So what would the bill do? It would 
establish a USDA certification pro-
gram for the technical assistance pro-
viders and third-party verifiers in-
volved in creating carbon credits on 
grounds that it would help small farm-
ers better understand the carbon credit 
market and know with whom they may 
work.

June 24, 2021 
In other words, it would create a 
massive accreditation program that 
would potentially hamper, not foster, 
innovation. It would insert the Federal 
Government into a market that is blos-
soming on its own, imposing burden-
some regulation and picking winners 
and losers in the carbon credit market-
place. 
To make matters worse, it would cor-
rupt the financial incentives of the 
market by allowing the USDA to cap 
revenues and generally regulate the 
sale of these credits. 
Though it aims to help small farmers 
to participate in this market, it could 
easily be manipulated to demand the 
USDA set unusually high protocols and 
qualifications and then drive carbon 
credit purchasers solely to credit sell-
ers working with those who fit and 
comply with the edicts of the Federal 
Government. 
This will ultimately only impose ob-
stacles for farmers, ranchers, and for-
esters, impede potential new partici-
pants, and, in the end, hurt the envi-
ronment. That is why I am offering an 
alternative. 
My amendment would transform this 
program into a transparent, informa-
tional resource for farmers, ranchers, 
and private foresters as they look for 
technical 
assistance 
providers 
and 
third-party verifiers. It would include 
common qualifications and common 
practices of these entities and a list of 
providers and verifiers that they could 
reach out to for assistance. 
The Federal Government ought to 
get out of the way for the carbon credit 
market to continue innovating and 
thriving, not squash it. The American 
Energy Alliance agrees and has issued 
a favorable vote recommendation. 
For all of these reasons, I urge my 
colleagues to support this amendment. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, 
our farmers, ranchers, and foresters are 
the greatest stewards of the land, and 
many have been working for a long 
time to preserve natural resources and 
protect the environment through on- 
farm practices. And now, more than 
ever, farmers, ranchers, and private 
forest landowners are looking to ex-
plore opportunities to benefit finan-
cially through emerging voluntary en-
vironmental credit markets. 
New opportunities to generate bene-
fits through environmental practices 
hold a great deal of promise. However, 
producers and landowners must navi-
gate a complex and costly landscape in 
order to access these markets. 
The Growing Climate Solutions Act 
provides a framework for producers to 
access technical assistance, guidance, 
and resources in these emerging mar-
kets as they investigate whether to 
pursue this new opportunity. 
USDA certification of entities who 
will assist farmers in how best to navi-
gate these markets will improve mar-
ket integrity and provide farmers and 
ranchers more confidence as they take 
the first steps. The information gath-
ered by USDA through the certifi-
cation process will serve as a reliable 
resource to producers seeking to learn 
about both the entities involved and 
the practices being implemented to 
generate credits that are transacted in 
voluntary environmental credit mar-
kets. 
These markets and the key players 
are evolving very quickly, and this bill 
directs USDA to first assess the cur-
rent state of voluntary environmental 
credit markets because it is important 
that we all have an understanding of 
the landscape first. 
Further, this bill is farmer-friendly. 
It acknowledges that for farmers and 
ranchers to be successful, there cannot 
be a one-size-fits-all approach. A corn 
farmer in Indiana, a cherry farmer in 
Michigan, and a rice farmer in Arkan-
sas have different soil types and vary-
ing potential for carbon sequestration. 
So this bill recognizes the diversity of 
agriculture and the practices that may 
be employed by farmers. It provides 
educational resources for producers 
who decide this new market oppor-
tunity works for their unique business 
model. 
The bill ensures farmers comprise a 
majority on the USDA advisory com-
mittee and protects the information 
farmers and ranchers share as part of 
the program. 
For these market to work, they must 
work for our farmers, foresters, ranch-
ers, and landowners. In order to do 
that, they must be at the table. This 
bill provides our stakeholders that 
voice. 
Finally, this bill epitomizes a great 
deal of bipartisan work, while address-
ing the pressing needs of farmers, 
ranchers, and foresters. I thank Sen-
ators BRAUN and STABENOW for helping 
us to make this the best bill possible. 
Many farmers and stakeholders are 
excited about this legislation, as are 
many Members who cosponsored the 
bill and voted to report it out of com-
mittee. 
The bipartisan nature of the work of 
the committee was exciting to see. We 
came together and accomplished some-
thing significant. I hope this spirit of 
cooperation continues as Congress con-
siders new policies on climate change. 
We need to ensure that any policies 
are farmer-friendly and farmer-focused, 
remain voluntarily, and avoid a one- 
size-fits-all approach. 
Again, thank you to Chairwoman 
STABENOW and Senator BRAUN for their 
efforts. I look forward to the debate 
and very much support the bill through 
final passage. 
With that, I yield to Senator BRAUN. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, in 
the Senate here, prior to getting here, 
I have been a tree farmer since the late 
eighties and have been involved in the 
agricultural part of farming, other 
than driving the tractor, for a long 
time. And farming has got to be one of 
the most difficult things God ever cre-
ated in terms of a complicated business 
that involves risk for a return that, in 
many cases, just isn’t there. Thank 
goodness, currently, the markets are 
rewarding that effort and that great 
risk. 
Environmental credits present an in-
credible 
opportunity 
for 
American 
farmers because that bottom line is so 
meager to begin with. And when you 
have got voluntarily markets out there 
that are wanting to reward good stew-
ardship, it should be easy. But signifi-
cant barriers still remain. 
In today’s market, if you are a small 
farmer, you are not able to connect 
with these markets. Only the large 
farmers, both tree and egg, can do it. 
This simplifies it; it democratizes it; 
and it does something, finally, that 
that small guy, the landowner, the 
American family farmer, can get some 
benefit for his or her good stewardship. 
The Growing Climate Solutions Act 
creates a USDA certification program 
for third-party technical providers and 
verifiers. It allows the USDA to pro-
vide legitimacy to the trustworthy ac-
tors in the marketplace. And what is 
really unusual, in the short time I have 
been here in the U.S. Senate—it was a 
surprise yesterday, when I told some 
folks we are actually voting on some-
thing on the floor, and it has 55 cospon-
sors, 
almost 
evenly 
split 
between 
Democrats and Republicans. 
More than 100 outside organizations 
back the bill. Farm bureaus, which are 
generally 
very 
conservative 
about 
doing anything where they are going to 
endorse, stick their neck out, across 
the board like it. I won’t mention all 
the others. It also does it without add-
ing a dime to our deficit. So it is doing 
something that has got bipartisan sup-
port, tapping voluntary markets, and 
just providing that portal that all 
farmers are familiar with to use as the 
way they take advantage of it. 
We are demonstrating the right solu-
tion. We are making a statement that 
we need to be involved in addressing 
climate, and we are doing it in a place 
where, thank goodness, agriculture in 
this country is only 10 percent of the 
CO2
emissions. The rest is spread 
among electric generation, transpor-
tation, industrial emitters. 
What that says, when it is 25 percent 
emissions across the world due to agri-
culture, there is a lot to be learned 
from this as well. 
A quick comment on the amendment 
that we are going to vote on. The key 
point is, under both the underlying bill 
and the Lee amendment, the USDA 
will publish a list of entities on a 
USDA website for farmers to use. 
The Senate Ag Committee worked 
closely with the Agency, both Under 
Secretaries Perdue and Vilsack, to en-
sure the bill provided the necessary 
quality checks so that the folks cer-
tified under the program know what 
they are doing. 
The 
Lee 
amendment 
keeps 
the 
website but strikes these requirements.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4738 
June 24, 2021 
This is why groups like the American 
Farm Bureau write that Senator LEE’s 
amendment would dilute farmers’ in-
fluence in the composition of the bill’s 
advisory panel and also removes crit-
ical protections in the base bill. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
Lee amendment and to support the un-
derlying bill. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
AMERICAN FARM BUREAU FEDERATION, 
Washington, DC, June 23, 2021. 
MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR, The American Farm Bu-
reau Federation supports S. 1251, the bipar-
tisan Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2021, 
and urges its adoption by the Senate. 
The Growing Climate Solutions Act would 
create a certification program at USDA to 
help solve technical entry barriers for farm-
ers, ranchers and forest landowners who wish 
to participate in voluntary carbon credit 
markets. Lack of access to reliable informa-
tion about markets, qualified technical as-
sistance 
providers, 
and 
credit 
protocol 
verifiers has limited both landowner partici-
pation and the adoption of practices. 
S. 1251 seeks to provide more clarity and 
guidance for farmers, ranchers and forest 
landowners who want to provide the eco-
system services that many consumers and 
businesses are desiring. This builds upon 
American agriculture’s strong foundation of 
environmental stewardship. 
Farm Bureau opposes the Lee amendment 
and any other amendments that would un-
dermine the bill. The Lee amendment would 
replace the balanced, and widely supported, 
program outlined in the current bill with a 
haphazard alternative program that would 
undermine confidence in the private market-
place. Sen. Lee’s amendment goes on to di-
lute farmer influence in the composition of 
the bill’s advisory panel, and also removes 
critical protections in the base bill to ensure 
farmers and ranchers receive their fair share 
of proceeds under voluntary environmental 
credit markets. 
The Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2021 
is a carefully crafted bipartisan bill with 
over half the Senate supporting as cospon-
sors. Your vote in opposition to the Lee 
amendment and in support of final passage of 
the overall bill is key to Farm Bureau. 
Sincerely, 
ZIPPY DUVALL, 
President. 
JUNE 15, 2021. 
Re Support Final Passage of S. 1251. 
MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MEMBERS
OF
THE U.S. SENATE, We 
write to lend our support for the Growing 
Climate Solutions Act without changes or 
amendments that would weaken the bill. Our 
organizations recognize that there is im-
mense potential for agricultural and for-
estry-based natural climate solutions to 
meaningfully contribute to the fight against 
climate change. Farmers, ranchers, and for-
esters are on the front lines of severe weath-
er events that are exacerbated by the chang-
ing climate. The Growing Climate Solutions 
Act will help producers remain resilient in 
the face of these threats and accelerate their 
contribution to a solution. 
The Growing Climate Solutions Act is a 
thoughtful and nuanced piece of legislation 
that ensures that farmers are at the fore-
front in tapping into the potential benefits 
of a market-based revenue system that re-
wards climate-smart agricultural practices. 
The bill is also drafted to ensure that bene-
fits and revenues realized under voluntary 
market regimes are designed to be equitably 
distributed among all farmers, including 
small and beginning farmers, historically 
underserved farmers, and socially disadvan-
taged farmers. The bill makes tangible 
progress in highlighting these important 
stakeholders throughout. 
Thank you again for your leadership on 
this important legislation. We are proud to 
lend our support to the Growing Climate So-
lutions Act and encourage the Senate to the 
pass without changes or amendments that 
would weaken the bill and at the earliest 
possible date. 
Sincerely, 
CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY,

FUND, 
THE EVANGELICAL 
ENVIRONMENTAL 
NETWORK, 
NATIONAL AUDUBON 
SOCIETY, 
NATIONAL WILDLIFE 
FEDERATION, 
THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. 
CORN REFINERS ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC. 
The 
Corn 
Refiners 
Association 
(CRA) 
strongly supports final passage of S. 1251, the 
Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2021. This 
bipartisan 
legislation 
reduces 
technical 
entry barriers for producers and forest own-
ers interested in participating in voluntary 
carbon markets and supports our sector’s 
role in delivering innovative climate solu-
tions. 
The Growing Climate Solutions Act re-
flects 
CRA’s 
climate 
change 
principles, 
which guide our industry’s advocacy to en-
sure a more sustainable future for corn refin-
ing, agriculture, and consumers. By lowering 
this barrier to entry, S. 1251 creates an easier 
way for landowners to be financially re-
warded for the voluntary, sustainable steps 
they are taking through selling carbon cred-
its. 
Unfortunately, the amendment proposed 
by Senator Mike Lee (R–UT) would undercut 
the central function of this bill by removing 
most of the scientific and good governance 
requirements to become certified under the 
bill’s central program by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture. Without these critical 
protections, many farmers and producers 
will not have access to reliable information, 
resulting in unrealistic cost estimates and 
loss of trust in the carbon markets. Lee’s 
amendment would also remove protections 
for farmers already certified under the pro-
gram and would remove the legislation’s 
focus on equity that is intended to ensure 
farmers of color would benefit from the pro-
gram and inform its creation. 
For these reasons, we strongly urge you to 
vote No on the Lee amendment and Yes on 
final passage of S. 1251, the Growing Climate 
Solutions Act. If there are any questions 
about our position, or interest in holding a 
brief discussion on the legislation or Lee’s 
amendment, please contact me. Thank you 
for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
ROBIN J. BOWEN, 
Senior Vice President, External Affairs. 
CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBLE 
ENERGY SOLUTIONS, 
Washington, DC, June 23, 2021. 
Hon. MIKE BRAUN. 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR BRAUN, On behalf of Citi-
zens 
for 
Responsible 
Energy 
Solutions 
(CRES), I am writing to offer CRES’ strong 
support for S. 1251, the Growing Climate So-
lutions Act (GCSA). This bill was reported 
by the Senate Agriculture Committee on a 
unanimous vote and has been cosponsored by 
24 Republican Senators. CRES urges the Sen-
ate to pass this bipartisan legislation in its 
current form. 
GCSA will break down barriers for farmers, 
ranchers, and landowners to participate in 
voluntary carbon credit markets. The bill di-
rects the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) to establish a program to certify 
third-party verifiers and technical assistance 
providers. This program will connect pro-
ducers to the experts that will help them 
earn an additional stream of revenue by 
monetizing conservation practices, which al-
ready produce many soil, water, and air ben-
efits. 
This bill establishes a council comprised 
primarily of experienced farmers and ranch-
ers to advise USDA on program implementa-
tion and standards, which will ensure that 
producers come first in this limited-govern-
ment approach. GCSA also contains provi-
sions guaranteeing that the program will re-
main voluntary, that third parties will pro-
vide accurate estimates of costs and reve-
nues, and that revenues will be distributed 
fairly to farms of all types and sizes. These 
provisions are among the reasons the GCSA 
has the overwhelming support of agricul-
tural leaders, including endorsements from 
the American Farm Bureau, National Corn 
Growers Association, and American Soybean 
Association. 
Addressing climate change while strength-
ening our international competitiveness will 
require innovation across all sectors of our 
economy—including 
agriculture. 
CRES 
thanks you and Chairwoman Stabenow and 
Ranking Member Boozman, for your judi-
cious, bipartisan work on this commonsense 
legislation that puts agriculture first while 
providing a real path for decreased carbon 
emissions. S. 1251, in its current form, should 
be expeditiously passed by the U.S. Senate. 
Thank you for your leadership on this crit-
ical issue. 
Sincerely, 
HEATHER REAMS, 
Executive Director. 
FOOD AND AGRICULTURE 
CLIMATE ALLIANCE, 
June 23, 2021. 
Re Support Final Passage of S. 1251 and Op-
pose Lee Amendment. 
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE: The 
Food 
and 
Agriculture 
Climate 
Alliance 
(FACA) strongly supports final passage of S. 
1251, the Growing Climate Solutions Act of 
2021. This bipartisan legislation reduces 
technical entry barriers for producers and 
forest owners interested in participating in 
voluntary carbon markets. FACA consists of 
nearly 80 organizations representing farmers, 
ranchers, forest owners, agribusinesses, man-
ufacturers, the food and innovation sector, 
state governments, sportsmen and environ-
mental advocates. We commend Senate Agri-
culture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Sta-
benow (D–Mich.), Ranking Member John 
Boozman (R–Ark.) and Senator Mike Braun 
(R–lnd.) for crafting overwhelmingly bipar-
tisan legislation that supports our sectors’ 
role in delivering innovative climate solu-
tions. 
One of FACA’s guiding principles states 
that federal climate policy must be built 
upon voluntary, incentive-based programs 
and market-driven opportunities. By fos-
tering the growth of voluntary markets, S. 
1251 does just that. 
Unfortunately, the amendment proposed 
by Senator Mike Lee (R–Utah) undercuts the

Mr. BRAUN. I yield the floor. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of S. 1251, the 
Growing Climate Solutions Act. I first 
want to thank my partner in this land-
mark legislation, Senator BRAUN, and 
my partner and ranking member on the 
committee, Senator BOOZMAN, for his 
leadership and helping us improve this 
bill and getting it to where we are 
right now. 
Our farmers and ranchers are bat-
tling the consequences of carbon pollu-
tion and other greenhouse gases every 
day. They are on the frontlines every 
day. Producers are having to deal with 
higher highs and lower lows more so 
than ever before. 
Even as we speak, the Southeast is 
recovering from catastrophic flooding 
as a result of Hurricane Claudette, and 
the West is facing record heat that 
threatens the health of farmers and 
farmworkers in an unprecedented wild-
fire season. Nearly half of the country 
is in drought, including 90 percent of 
my home State of Michigan—90 per-
cent. It could not be clearer that cli-
mate is in crisis. 
The good news is that farmers and 
foresters are already leading the way 
on the climate crisis, as my colleagues 
have said, through their many con-
servation efforts. They work to reduce 
their impact every day through con-
servation practices that cut down on 
emissions and store carbon in their soil 
and trees. 
According to the National Acad-
emies, scaling up these climate-smart 
agriculture and forestry practices in 
the United States could offset the an-
nual emissions of nearly 110 million 
cars. And I am from the car State, 
Madam President. I still want you to 
buy an automobile. But this is very 
significant. 
The Growing Climate Solutions Act 
is a key piece of the enormous poten-
tial that land-based solutions have to 
help solve this crisis. This bill gives 
producers even more effective tools to 
lead and new opportunities for eco-
nomic successes as well. 
The bill equips producers to succeed 
by doing three things. First, it sets up 
a network of trusted outside experts 
and third-party verifiers, certified by 
the USDA, to provide technical assist-
ance and help producers generate and 
sell their voluntary carbon credits, 
which, by the way, Senator LEE’s 
amendment would gut, which is why I 
do not support that amendment. 
Then it creates a comprehensive on-
line resource, a one-stop shop, to help 
our farmers get the information they 
need and create income by providing 
sustainable 
practices 
through 
vol-
untary carbon markets and traditional 
USDA conservation programs. 
Finally, it sets up a very important 
advisory council made up of a majority 
of farmers and foresters with tremen-
dous diversity, as well as representa-
tives from the research community and 
the private industry, to help guide the 
USDA as they put this together. 
The bottom line: It gives them the 
opportunity to work with the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture to design a 
carbon market that works for them, 
not Wall Street. In other words this, 
bill puts farmers and foresters first. 
More than 175 advocates, organiza-
tions, and companies support this bill. 
They see it as a win-win for agriculture 
and the environment. That coalition is 
mirrored in the broad support we have 
here in the U.S. Senate, with now up-
wards of 55 cosponsors who have joined 
in this bill. Given today’s politics, that 
says a lot about what this bill rep-
resents. 
Solving the climate crisis is a crit-
ical challenge for all of us, and today 
we are taking landmark steps toward 
supporting agriculture and forestry 
leadership in addressing this. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
vote yes on the Growing Climate Solu-
tions Act, to vote no on the Lee 
amendment, which would essentially 
gut the bill, and allow us, in this tre-
mendous bipartisan effort, to move for-
ward on something very important. 
I yield the floor. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 2119 
Madam President, I would ask unani-
mous consent that the scheduled vote 
occur immediately.

Without objection, it is so ordered.

demand for agriculture or forestry credits at 
the end of the preceding 4-calendar year pe-
riod, and historically, in voluntary environ-
mental credit markets; 
(iii) the total number of agriculture or for-
estry credits (measured in metric tons of 
carbon dioxide equivalent) that were esti-
mated to be in development, generated, or 
sold in market transactions during the pre-
ceding 4-calendar year period, and histori-
cally, in voluntary environmental credit 
markets; 
(iv) the estimated supply and demand of 
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of 
offsets in the global marketplace for the 
next 4 years; 
(v) the barriers to entry due to compliance 
and verification costs described in sub-
section (g)(4)(C)(iv); 
(vi) the state of monitoring and measure-
ment technologies needed to quantify long- 
term carbon sequestration in soils and from 
other activities to prevent, reduce, or miti-
gate greenhouse gas emissions in the agri-
culture and forestry sectors; 
(vii) means to reduce barriers to entry into 
voluntary environmental credit markets for 
small, beginning, and socially disadvantaged 
farmers, ranchers, and private forest land-
owners and the extent to which existing pro-
tocols in voluntary environmental credit 
markets allow for aggregation of projects 
among farmers, ranchers, and private forest 
landowners;

(ix) the potential impact of Department of 
Agriculture activities on supply and demand 
of agriculture or forestry credits; 
(x) the potential role of the Department of 
Agriculture in encouraging innovation in 
voluntary environmental credit markets; 
(xi) the extent to which the existing re-
gimes for generating and selling agriculture 
or forestry credits, as the regimes exist at 
the end of the preceding 4-calendar year pe-
riod, and historically, and existing voluntary 
environmental credit markets, may be im-
peded or constricted, or achieve greater scale 
and reach, if the Department of Agriculture 
were involved, including by considering the 
role of the Department of Agriculture in re-
ducing the barriers to entry identified under 
clause (v), including by educating stake-
holders about voluntary environmental cred-
it markets; 
(xii) the extent to which existing protocols 
in voluntary environmental credit markets, 
including verification, additionality, perma-
nence, and reporting, adequately take into 
consideration and account for factors en-
countered by the agriculture and private for-
est sectors in preventing, reducing, or miti-
gating greenhouse gases or sequestering car-
bon through agriculture and forestry prac-
tices, considering variances across regions, 
topography, soil types, crop or species vari-
eties, and business models; 
(xiii) the extent to which existing proto-
cols in voluntary environmental credit mar-
kets consider options to ensure the contin-
ued valuation, through discounting or other 
means, of agriculture and forestry credits in 
the case of the practices underlying those 
credits being disrupted due to unavoidable 
events, including production challenges and 
natural disasters; and 
(xiv) opportunities for other voluntary 
markets outside of voluntary environmental 
credit markets to foster the trading, buying, 
or selling of credits that are derived from ac-
tivities that provide other ecosystem service 
benefits, including activities that improve 
water quality, water quantity, wildlife habi-
tat enhancement, and other ecosystem serv-
ices, as the Secretary determines appro-
priate; 
(B) publish the assessment; and 
(C) submit the assessment to the Com-
mittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and For-
estry of the Senate and the Committee on 
Agriculture of the House of Representatives. 
(2) QUADRIENNIAL
ASSESSMENT.—The Sec-
retary, in consultation with the Adminis-
trator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency and the Advisory Council, shall con-
duct the assessment described in paragraph 
(1)(A) and publish and submit the assessment 
in accordance with subparagraphs (B) and (C) 
of paragraph (1) every 4 years after the publi-
cation and submission of the first assess-
ment under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of 
Candace Jackson-Akiwumi, of Illinois, 
to be United States Circuit Judge for 
the Seventh Circuit. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Iowa. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 831 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am 
here with Senators Cornyn and Leahy 
to ask unanimous consent. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 831 and 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration; further, that the Grass-
ley amendment at the desk be consid-
ered and agreed to; and that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed and the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
guess I am not surprised that we would 
have an objection like this because a 
program that has been corrupt and 
that we have been trying to reform for 
8 years—every time we reach an agree-
ment, there is big-moneyed interests in 
this town and around the country that 
keep it from happening. 
So today’s objection, unfortunately, 
represents another victory for those 
same moneyed, powerful, corrupt inter-
ests that have so often worked to kill 
reforms to a program that they love to 
abuse for nothing more than their own 
financial benefit. 
It also means that Congress will not 
be able to pass legislation to reauthor-
ize the program in advance of its expi-
ration on June 30. A narrow subset of 
big-moneyed and corrupt interests has 
now shown that they would rather kill 
the program altogether than have to 
accept integrity programs designed to 
clamp down on their bad behavior. 
I thank all those groups who have 
been working with us for 8 years to get 
this program reformed. A lot of those 
people use that program. They were 
willing to make it an honest program. 
All of this action today of this objec-
tion is unfortunate but not surprising. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, EB–5 in-
vestments are a major economic driver 
in Texas. EB–5 projects use merit-based 
immigration to create thousands of 
American jobs and bring billions of dol-
lars in investment to major urban 
areas, like Dallas and Houston, as well 
as our rural communities across the 
State. These projects include invest-
ments in infrastructure for a wide vari-
ety of sectors, including energy, hospi-
tality, residential, and commercial. 
I am a supporter of the EB–5 Pro-
gram and its resources for the commu-
nity, but there is no question, as Sen-
ator GRASSLEY has said, that it could 
stand some reforms. As with any de-
bate in Congress, there are a lot of dif-
ferent opinions on what those reforms 
should look like, but we can all agree 
that we need to strengthen this pro-
gram and reauthorize it. 
I am glad to join Senator GRASSLEY 
today in offering this legislation to im-
prove the integrity and security of the 
EB–5 Program, while ensuring law- 
abiding Texas job creators aren’t nega-
tively impacted. 
This bill would have reauthorized the 
EB–5 Program until 2023, with signifi-
cant oversight and integrity measures. 
It will require regional centers to have 
policies and procedures in place to pro-
tect against fraud. It will give the De-
partment of Homeland Security great-
er authority to terminate applications 
based on fraud, criminal misuse, or 
threats to public safety or national se-
curity. It would subject EB–5 projects 
to greater oversight. All of these 
changes come without skewing the 
framework of the program to benefit 
certain areas to the detriment of oth-
ers. 
This happens to be very similar to 
legislation that I introduced in 2015 
with Senator SCHUMER
and Senator 
Flake, which included recommenda-
tions from both the Department of 
Homeland Security and the Govern-
ment Accountability Office. 
I appreciate Chairman GRASSLEY’s 
leadership on this legislation, and I 
hope at some point we can reauthorize 
the EB–5 Program and safeguard crit-
ical 
investments 
in 
communities 
across the country. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was 
happy to join with both Senators

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4744 
June 24, 2021 
GRASSLEY and CORNYN on the EB–5 re-
form bill. Senator CORNYN has worked 
very hard on this, Senator GRASSLEY 
has, and I have, and it was truly a bi-
partisan bill. It had widespread support 
of EB–5 stakeholders—those who re-
sponsibly welcomed changes to the pro-
gram that would improve oversight and 
accountability. 
Senator GRASSLEY and I have been 
working for years to reform the EB–5 
visa program. We wanted to reduce the 
fraud that has occurred in several EB– 
5 projects, including one that occurred 
in my own State of Vermont. 
This legislation—again, bringing Re-
publicans and Democrats across the po-
litical spectrum together—reflects a 
careful and thoughtful compromise to 
both keep the EB–5 Program alive and 
curtail the worst abuses it has. There 
is actually only a small minority that 
wants to keep the program operating 
without these improved standards and 
oversight. 
I wish they would be willing to come 
here and bring it up, vote it up or 
down, and be on the RECORD saying 
how they are going to vote, because op-
posing our effort on this is a vote that 
allows the EB–5 Program to lapse. It 
will 
have 
untold 
economic 
con-
sequences throughout the communities 
that rely on the program for develop-
ment projects, like those that the Sen-
ator from Texas just mentioned. 
I wish that Senators had supported 
Senator GRASSLEY’s consent request. 
But I will take a moment to say I 
thank Senator GRASSLEY for working 
with me over the years to find a bipar-
tisan compromise to reform this. Hours 
have gone into that. He and Senator 
CORNYN and I and others have worked 
hard to have a compromise. I am sorry 
that the unanimous consent was ob-
jected to, especially as it means this 
will expire, and we won’t have votes on 
improvements that could take place. I 
think it is a wasted opportunity. 
SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS 
Mr. President, actually, if others are 
waiting, let me say something on an-
other matter. It was 169 days ago that 
the world witnessed a violent insurrec-
tion take place in the seat of American 
democracy. All of us have the memory 
of rioters in combat gear who were 
armed with zip ties and smashing in 
the windows of the Capitol Building. 
Everybody in America remembers that. 
The images of the National Guard pa-
trolling the Capitol grounds behind 
fences topped with barbed wire—those 
are going to be in the pages of text-
books of American history for genera-
tions to come. 
Now, we didn’t budget for an insur-
rection. In a democracy like ours, you 
should never have to. But the path of 
destruction from that day left the Cap-
itol 
Police 
overburdened 
and 
underresourced. Purchases of critical 
equipment like respirators, ballistic 
helmets, protective gear, and train-
ing—those have been delayed to make 
up for these unanticipated costs. Ef-
forts to implement the department’s 
wellness program to address mental 
health concerns following January 6 
have been put on the back burner. And 
if we do nothing, the Capitol Police 
projects that doing nothing will de-
plete salary funds in August, and that 
would be a security crisis that we have 
created. 
Now, 55 sworn officers have left the 
force since January 6. That is not 
counting those who died from January 
6. That has depleted the force, which is 
already stressed. It is below what is 
needed to meet mission requirements. 
There is an urgent need to address the 
unanticipated costs associated with the 
attack on this building, including sig-
nificant overtime pay, the need for haz-
ard pay, and retention bonuses to keep 
dedicated officers from leaving the 
force. 
The urgent need extends beyond the 
Capitol Police. Last week, the Sec-
retary of Defense testified before the 
full Appropriations Committee and 
said that if we do not act, the National 
Guard will be forced to cut training in 
August as well. I met with the Green 
Mountain 
Boys, 
who 
came 
from 
Vermont to secure the Capitol after 
January 6. I thanked them for their 
service. I am sure many other Senators 
thanked the Guard from their States. 
But if we don’t act, our visits and 
thanking them is nothing more than 
empty words for the men and women 
who put their lives on the line for our 
country. 
And, finally, the trauma that day is 
shared by every member of the con-
gressional 
community, 
from 
the 
Speaker of the House to the dedicated 
support staff in the Capitol—staff we 
rely on every day to do our work. It 
should not be lost on us that we 
weren’t the ones who went to sweep up 
the shattered glass and scrub the floors 
and walls of this building on that day 
and throughout the night. It was the 
people who work here. 
It should not be lost on us that dur-
ing the darkest hours of the pandemic, 
following the insurrection, these public 
servants came to work, cleaned our of-
fices, ensured our safety, the safety of 
our staff, and boarded up shattered 
windows and broken doors. 
Now, we did not budget for both the 
pandemic and insurrection. We were 
forced to rob Peter to pay Paul to keep 
our congressional community safe and 
healthy. But now necessary legislative 
branch projects lack the funding to 
move forward. We ought to have the re-
sponsibility to address that. 
It has been 169 days since January 6. 
It has been 169 days since Republicans 
and Democrats reconvened in this 
Chamber in bipartisan defiance of 
those who sought to overthrow democ-
racy and the rule of law through mob 
violence. 
But now, for 35 days, the House- 
passed emergency supplemental to ad-
dress the security and the mental 
health needs of the January 6 insurrec-
tion and the lingering scars of the 
COVID pandemic has languished in the 
Senate. And why? Because Senate Re-
publicans have refused to begin nego-
tiations on a bipartisan path forward. 
So I am urging my colleagues: Begin 
these negotiations. The clock is tick-
ing. My staff and I are—throughout the 
Fourth of July recess, we are—willing 
to meet and talk with anybody to get 
these negotiations going, because if we 
don’t act, the Capitol Police is going to 
run out of funding in a very short time 
in August. 
And what are we saying? We are 
turning our backs on those who fought 
and bled and died on that day to pro-
tect us and defend this building and ev-
erything it stands for. How can we pos-
sibly do that? We are going to be forc-
ing the men and women of the National 
Guard to go without training that is 
necessary to achieve their mission, and 
we will be telling the women and men 
of the Capitol staff who support us: 
Thanks, but we don’t support you. 
That would be wrong. That goes 
against everything that I have learned 
in my years here in the Senate from 
both Republicans and Democrats. 
The security supplemental would ad-
dress the shortfalls. It would provide 
new resources for overtime, hazard 
pay, mental health services, retention 
bonuses, and new equipment and train-
ing for the Capitol Police, all of which 
is needed. It would fully reimburse the 
wounded men of the National Guard 
with costs incurred protecting the Cap-
itol. 
They were called. They came. They 
didn’t say: Oh, are we going to get re-
imbursed? 
They answered the call. Of course, 
they assumed that we would be respon-
sible enough to reimburse them. 
We also restored legislative branch 
funding that was taken to address the 
immediate needs of keeping our con-
gressional 
community 
safe 
and 
healthy. 
I have been ready to begin bipartisan 
negotiations. I believe if we begin these 
negotiations now, we could complete 
our work in the July session. My door 
is always open. It will be open through-
out the July recess. 
I yield the floor. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
once again in support of Jen Easterly’s 
nomination to be Director of the Cy-
bersecurity and Infrastructure Secu-
rity Agency, commonly referred to as 
CISA. 
Yesterday, I came to the floor to 
urge my colleagues to swiftly confirm 
Ms. Easterly to lead CISA so she can 
get to work in strengthening our Na-
tion’s response to the recent onslaught 
of online attacks that have literally 
wrought havoc to our critical infra-
structure, businesses, and even govern-
ment. 
With her more than three decades of 
service in the public and private sec-
tors and her critical role in crafting 
vital cyber security recommendations 
as a member of the Cyber Solarium

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4745 
June 24, 2021 
Commission, Ms. Easterly is more than 
qualified to lead this critical Agency. 
Her leadership is needed now more 
than ever, after the damage and the 
chaos that recent cyber attacks have 
caused. We urgently need a qualified 
and Senate-confirmed leader in place 
before the next major breach, which 
could be even worse. 
Yesterday, when I called on the Sen-
ate to immediately confirm this crit-
ical nominee, the Senator from Florida 
objected, not because he opposes Ms. 
Easterly’s confirmation, and, in fact, 
he actually helped advance her nomi-
nation out of my committee just last 
week. Instead, he blocked the swift 
confirmation of this critical cyber se-
curity leader because he wants to ex-
tract a completely unrelated political 
concession from the Biden administra-
tion. 
As we now know, Vice President HAR-
RIS has announced that she will travel 
to El Paso tomorrow, along with 
Homeland 
Security 
Secretary 
Mayorkas, to assess the situation on 
the southern border. The Biden admin-
istration and Secretary Mayorkas have 
worked hard to address our border 
challenges, and, as a result, we have 
seen a reduction in the number of un-
accompanied children who are in DHS 
custody. 
But this nomination is not about the 
border, as much as my Republican col-
leagues try to conflate these issues. 
This nomination is about cyber secu-
rity. This nomination is keeping Amer-
ican families safe and our economy se-
cure. That is what this nomination is 
all about. My Republican colleagues 
are continuing to stall the confirma-
tion of Ms. Easterly at a time when we 
desperately need strong cyber security 
leadership. 
The Senate is preparing to adjourn 
for Independence Day, which is a major 
travel weekend. As we have seen from 
recent cyber attacks, our transpor-
tation networks are vulnerable. Crimi-
nal organizations and foreign adver-
saries will continue their efforts to 
compromise our networks. We must be 
prepared for attacks that could disrupt 
trains or flights over the holiday week-
end. 
We must confirm Ms. Easterly as the 
CISA Director now, not in 2 weeks and 
not in 2 months. We must have a quali-
fied Senate-confirmed leader in place 
to help us address these attacks. 
If our Republican colleagues won’t 
consent, they risk weakening and slow-
ing our cyber defenses at a time when 
attacks could cause serious disrup-
tions. These attacks risk the lives and 
livelihoods of countless Americans. 
Safeguarding against them should not 
be a partisan issue. Putting in place 
highly 
qualified 
cyber 
leadership 
should not hinge on whether Repub-
licans in the Senate approve of the 
Vice President’s travel schedule. 
I urge the Senator from Florida to 
withdraw his objections so that we can 
do our job, confirm Ms. Easterly today, 
and help protect the American people 
from 
this 
grave 
national 
security 
threat. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that notwithstanding rule XXII, 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of Calendar No. 176, Jen 
Easterly, of New York, to be the Direc-
tor of the Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency, Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, and the 
Senate vote on the nomination without 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, before I 
address this issue, I will take a mo-
ment of personal privilege to talk 
about the horrific tragedy that oc-
curred in Surfside, FL, when an apart-
ment building collapsed earlier this 
morning. 
Miami-Dade fire and rescue, Miami- 
Dade police, and our other brave first 
responders rushed to the scene and 
have been working nonstop to rescue 
those trapped in the rubble. It looks 
horrible. I have talked to quite a few 
people down there, and we know of one 
confirmed death, and, hopefully, there 
won’t be no more. But I know they are 
still trying to get people out of the 
rubble. 
So I join all my Floridians in praying 
for strength for these first responders 
and all those impacted by this disaster. 
First, I want to thank my colleague 
for giving me a few moments to speak 
on this difficult moment for my State. 
My colleague raised this same issue 
yesterday. I am here fighting for ac-
countability for the American people. 
So I will say the same in return. 
I voted to support Ms. Easterly’s con-
firmation in committee last week. If 
Senator SCHUMER filed for cloture, like 
he has done for dozens of other nomi-
nees this year, I would vote to support 
her confirmation here on the Senate 
floor. In fact, I don’t understand why 
Senator SCHUMER didn’t file for cloture 
on Tuesday night when my office first 
learned of my colleague’s intention to 
raise this. We could be voting on her 
confirmation right now. 
As my colleague has said, this isn’t 
about Ms. Easterly, in my mind. This 
isn’t about cyber security. Remember, 
we announced and confirmed the Na-
tional Cyber Director last week. Just 
yesterday, the Senate confirmed the 
Administrator of the General Services 
Administration, which is a key Agency 
for modernizing and protecting the 
Federal Government’s IT infrastruc-
ture. I am here today because families 
in my State of Florida and across our 
Nation 
deserve 
accountability, 
and 
President Biden has shown a total lack 
of accountability when it comes to ad-
dressing the border crisis. That is why 
I announced last month that I will be 
holding all of President Biden’s nomi-
nees for the Department of Homeland 
Security from being approved through 
our expedited process until he and Vice 
President HARRIS visit the border and 
see for themselves the crisis their 
failed policies of open borders and the 
amnesty have created. 
As we all know, yesterday, the White 
House announced that the Vice Presi-
dent will be visiting the border tomor-
row, and absolutely, I think we all 
hope that is true. The administration 
made a lot of promises they haven’t 
kept. They promised not to raise taxes. 
They promised to reopen schools quick-
ly. They promised to be tough on Com-
munist China. There is quite a list. 
So trust me—I am glad the Vice 
President seems to be taking my ad-
vice and finally listening to the Amer-
ican people and visiting the border. I 
truly hope she gets down to the border 
to see the crisis that this administra-
tion’s failed policies have created. 
I hope she meets with the National 
Border Patrol Council to hear from 
them what our brave CBP agents are 
going through every day to keep us 
safe. 
I hope she meets with border commu-
nity sheriffs who are responsible for 
keeping our families safe. 
I hope she meets with our ICE and 
CBP section chiefs. 
I hope she takes an aerial tour like I 
did and sees the gaps in the wall. I took 
a tour with Governor Ducey. You have 
the wall, and then all of a sudden, 
there are these openings where the 
fences weren’t put up or the gates 
weren’t put up. 
A lot of people up here said: Oh, we 
don’t need the wall; we need, you 
know, technology. 
Well, there are the lights and cam-
eras. I saw places where it just—it 
wasn’t electrified. It just doesn’t make 
sense. 
I hope she meets with families who 
have been victims of trafficking and 
hears their horrific stories, what this 
has put people through. 
I hope she visits some of the border 
communities and talks to the mayors 
and talks to people down there about 
how they are housing and caring for 
this historic number of people illegally 
crossing our borders. This is a tough 
crisis that has been created. 
I hope she talks to families who have 
lost loved ones from massive, massive 
amounts of fentanyl that now our car-
tels are moving across the border. 
I hope she talks to ranchers who are 
impacted by people illegally crossing 
the border onto their property. 
I think all of us would hope that it is 
not just a political stunt. I hope she ac-
tually says: I want to see the crisis. I 
want to understand exactly what hap-
pened here. 
When she does, I am going to lift all 
of my holds, as I told my colleague. 
What is happening at the border is a 
crisis, and I don’t think there is an-
other word for it. You can look at this 
chart. Look at how many people have 
come across. This is the number of peo-
ple who have been apprehended. We 
don’t know how many people there are 
who haven’t been apprehended. 
More than 180,000 illegal aliens tried 
to cross our southern border last

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4746 
June 24, 2021 
month—the 
highest 
number 
in 
21 
years—threatening our national secu-
rity and the safety of American fami-
lies. 
President Biden’s immigration poli-
cies are putting unaccompanied minors 
at risk of human trafficking, violence, 
sexual abuse, and separation from their 
families. I mean, it is horrible. They 
are leading to an alarming increase in 
human trafficking and drug smuggling 
by cartels. 
FBI Director Wray said there is ‘‘no 
question’’ that the cartel activity from 
Mexico is ‘‘spilling over’’ to the United 
States. We are seeing it in Florida. I 
talk to our sheriffs, and what they are 
telling me is that they are seeing a lot 
more deadly fentanyl coming into their 
counties, and it is showing up in their 
labs. 
But instead of securing the border 
and finishing the wall construction 
projects—I don’t get it. Why did Presi-
dent Biden terminate all the border 
wall projects? No one can—he has 
never had an explanation. 
So this inaction of not going to the 
border by President Biden and Vice 
President HARRIS
doesn’t make any 
sense. Why can’t they acknowledge 
that we expect and we deserve a secure 
border that is good for our Nation? 
Why can’t they stand up against the 
radical left and say that open borders 
are dangerous for our families? 
It should make every American furi-
ous. It is not something to laugh about. 
People are dying. Children are being 
exploited and abandoned in the desert. 
This is a picture of two young 3- and 
5-year-old Ecuadorian girls. You can 
see it. They were just dropped. Any-
body who has been around little chil-
dren, 3 and 5 years old—think about it. 
They were just dropped over the wall 
and just abandoned, just abandoned, 
hoping somebody was going to take 
care of them. Abandoned in the middle 
of the night. I mean, I have grandkids. 
I just can’t imagine—I can’t imagine 
anybody doing this. 
The White House claims that Vice 
President HARRIS’s last trip was to talk 
about the root causes of immigration. 
It doesn’t make any sense. It seems 
like it was just a political stunt to me. 
President Biden and Vice President 
HARRIS need to stop avoiding the crisis, 
stop laughing about the threat, get 
down to the border, and actually take 
real steps to really secure the border. 
So if either of them goes to the bor-
der, I am lifting my holds, but as long 
as they refuse to help those risking 
their lives every day to keep us safe, as 
long as they refuse to visit the border 
and put an end to the humanitarian 
crisis they have created, I am going to 
keep my holds on. 
Those two little girls, they deserve 
better. The millions of immigrants 
going through the legal immigration 
process, they deserve better. Our Bor-
der Patrol agents deserve better. Our 
local law enforcement agents deserve 
better. ICE deserves better. American 
families deserve better. Therefore, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—NO. S. 2216 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I 
think we are all aware President Biden 
has decided to withdraw American 
troops from Afghanistan in September. 
Now, some agree with his decision; 
some disagree with his decision. The 
bill that I am about to talk about has 
nothing to do with the merits of his de-
cision. 
There are about 18,000—not 1,800, 
18,000—interpreters and members of 
their immediate families who helped 
our troops fight the war in Afghanistan 
against the Taliban and against ISIS. 
They are at risk. 
There was an article in a leading 
newspaper yesterday. I will read you 
the headline. It says: ‘‘Afghan govern-
ment could collapse 6 months after US 
withdrawal.’’ 
These 18,000 interpreters and their 
immediate families, who have helped 
American troops, would like to get out. 
We have a visa process, which is going 
very, very slowly. We will not be able 
to get all of those 18,000 human beings 
out before the withdrawal in Sep-
tember. That much is clear. 
Again, my bill has nothing to do with 
the merits or lack thereof of the war. 
My bill would direct the Secretary of 
Defense and the Secretary of State to 
develop a plan to relocate the Afghan 
interpreters and their immediate fami-
lies who want to get out and bring 
them to America. 
Now, obviously, before we bring them 
to America, those who want to come, 
we have to vet them. That is part of 
the problem. The vetting process right 
now is very slow. Rather than try to 
put together a bill that would set forth 
a specific plan to address this—I con-
sider it a crisis if you are 1 of those 
18,000 human beings—my bill will just 
direct the Defense Department and the 
State Department to come up with a 
plan to present to us within 30 days. 
Now, my guess, and it is only a guess, 
is that State and Defense are going to 
come up with some plan to move those 
of the 18,000 who want to leave Afghan-
istan to a safe third place other than 
America so that we can continue to 
properly vet folks before they come 
into America. And I suggest we do need 
to properly vet them, but I also suggest 
that, No. 1, this is about right and 
wrong. These people helped Americans, 
and they helped American troops. And 
we owe them. And we don’t want to see 
them massacred. And, No. 2, if we allow 
them to be massacred, I think it is 
going to send a message to many peo-
ple throughout the world that loyalty 
to America means nothing, absolutely 
nothing. 
So, in a nutshell, this bill would ask 
our Defense Department and our State 
Department, in the next 30 days, to 
give a plan to Congress to properly vet 
and allow any of these 18,000 inter-
preters and their families who helped 
American troops come to America. 
With that, Mr. President, as if in leg-
islative session, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of S. 2216, which 
was introduced earlier today; further, I 
ask unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon table 
the table. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, in the first two dec-
ades after the Revolutionary War, 
America was under siege and our Cap-
itol was ransacked, but I don’t recall in 
reading history that any of our Found-
ing Fathers said that they would flee 
the country or leave and give up on the 
quest for liberty. 
The quest for liberty requires fight-
ing by the people who have been given 
their liberty, the people whom we have 
helped to get their liberty. You can say 
the people in Afghanistan helped us or 
you can also say we helped liberate 
them as well. 
They have been free for 20 years. It 
seems like it might precipitate the 
overcoming of the Taliban if you take 
18,000 of the most westernized, those 
who speak English, and you say: Flee, 
flee, flee. The end is coming. Well, 
guess what. The end comes quicker if 
they all leave. So I would encourage 
them, rather, to stay and fight. I think 
it would be good to have many English 
speakers in Afghanistan. The future of 
Afghanistan could be a bright future, 
but they are going to have to fight for 
it. And, ultimately, it is their fight. 
And if we offer easy escape and easy 
plans to leave the country, we are as-
suring the defeat of the people who are 
our friends in Afghanistan. So I object 
to this piece of legislation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I re-
spect my colleague, and I certainly re-
spect his right to object. I disagree. 
We are all aware of what is going on 
in Afghanistan. The Afghan Govern-
ment is in a bitter fight to the end 
with the Taliban. And the Taliban is 
winning. And the Taliban is ruthless. 
And they are going to murder these 
people. They are going to murder them. 
And the blood is going to be on Amer-
ican hands if we don’t do something to 
help. 
My proposal would not have required 
any of these 18,000 Afghans who stood 
with American troops to beat back the 
Taliban and to beat back ISIS—they 
stood with us at their own risk, at the 
risk of their own kids, and their own 
spouses. 
Now, we decided to leave. I am not 
saying that is right or wrong. I have 
my own opinion, but that is not what 
this bill is about. And we owe it to 
these 18,000 people to offer them a 
chance to live. And if we don’t do 
something, they are going to be butch-
ered. They are going to be gutted like

a deer—like a deer—and the blood is 
going to on American hands. And the 
whole world is going to take notice. 
There is right and wrong in this 
world. There is politics. There is a time 
for it. But there is a time to do the 
right thing, and the right thing is to 
help save these human lives who fought 
for America and their families and 
their children. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Arkansas. 
MASK MANDATES 
Mr. COTTON. There is a disturbing 
trend in the not-so-friendly skies these 
days—a big spike in confrontations, 
often violent, on American airplanes. 
It is all the more disturbing because it 
is totally unnecessary. In most cases, 
these disputes go back to one of the 
Biden administration’s dumbest poli-
cies—the mask mandate at airports 
and on airplanes. 
When the Wuhan coronavirus broke 
out in our country last year, confusion 
and uncertainty reigned, but within a 
couple of months, some commonsense 
standards had emerged: Protect the el-
derly and the frail. Outdoor activities 
are safer than indoor ones. Keep your 
distance. Wear a mask when you can’t 
for prolonged periods inside. Be civil 
and kind to each other. 
Thanks to Operation Warp Speed, 
these standards are largely a thing of 
the past. Americans are tired of it, and 
they want their freedoms back, and 
they are right. But too many Demo-
cratic politicians and know-it-all bu-
reaucrats don’t want to give up their 
newfound powers. 
No single action captures this power 
grab by government busybodies better 
than the TSA’s decision to extend its 
zero-tolerance 
mask 
mandates 
for 
planes, trains, and buses until Sep-
tember, through the summer travel 
season. This mandate applies to the 
vaccinated and the unvaccinated alike, 
as well as kids over the age of 2. 
Passengers without a mask or accom-
panied by children without a mask can 
lose their seats and be banned from air-
lines and subject to a $1,500 fine. This 
draconian and punitive policy has no 
basis in science. After all, airports 
typically have larger spaces and higher 
ceilings than, say, a grocery store and 
pharmacy. Planes have some of the 
most advanced air filtration systems 
available in the market today. 
But this stupid mandate does have 
real-world 
consequences. 
Just 
last 
month, a Colorado mother and her fam-
ily were removed from their flight be-
cause the plane’s captain didn’t believe 
that her 3-year-old son with autism 
would keep his mask on. This mother, 
unfortunately, was not the first to be 
removed from a flight, and I am sure 
she won’t be the last if this absurd 
mandate remains in place. 
This policy discourages family travel 
after a year of separation and forces 
Americans with children, especially 
children with disabilities, to cancel 
travel or else live in constant fear that 
an untimely tantrum or a bad day 
could ruin their trip and cost them 
more than $1,000 in fines. 
As the father of two young boys, I 
can only assume the morons who 
cooked up this rule don’t have chil-
dren, or perhaps they outsource their 
kids to nannies and au pairs during 
flights, just as they do during their 
dinner 
parties and fancy retreats. 
Young kids, especially when they are 
in 
a 
new 
location 
surrounded 
by 
strangers, tend to act out and mis-
behave, as any parent will tell you. 
That 
entirely 
predictable 
behavior 
shouldn’t result in their whole family 
being kicked off planes, trains, and 
buses far from home or their destina-
tion. 
I must also observe—although I know 
that facts have nothing to do with this 
mandate—that young kids are also the 
least likely to get the coronavirus and 
the least likely to spread it. 
Now, I concede that it is not only 
young kids who sometimes cause prob-
lems on planes. There are too many in-
stances of grownups refusing to wear 
masks or berating flight attendants 
merely trying to do their job. These 
unruly adults should know better, of 
course, but so should the politicians 
and the bureaucrats who imposed this 
idiotic mandate in the first place. 
Millions of Americans are flying 
again, and to say simply that ‘‘they 
should follow my rules’’ is impractical 
and ignores all we know about human 
nature. 
The mandate, therefore, hurts not 
only passengers but also flight attend-
ants. In our line of work, we probably 
fly more than most Americans these 
days. Over the last couple of months, I 
have personally seen so many flight at-
tendants set up for failure by the Biden 
administration. They usually don’t 
want to boss around their passengers or 
kick them off an airplane and cause a 
scene that will go viral on social 
media, but they are also told they have 
to enforce this stupid mask mandate, 
and it is all for no good reason. 
It would be one thing if there was sci-
entific evidence that suggested that 
these masks in airports and on air-
planes or buses or trains actually 
slowed the spread of the virus among 
the unvaccinated, but that is not the 
case. Even the Secretary of Transpor-
tation, Pete Buttigieg, can’t defend 
these mandates on the merits. He 
doesn’t even try. The only rationale he 
could give when recently asked about 
the mandate was, ‘‘They’re a matter of 
respect,’’ to which I would respond, 
how about some respect for Americans 
and their common sense? 
If you can’t defend a policy on the 
merits, you shouldn’t have the policy, 
and the Biden administration should 
therefore immediately rescind its mask 
mandates for airports and airplanes 
and 
buses 
and 
trains. 
Vaccinated 
Americans and their young kids should 
not be forced to wear face coverings on 
airplanes or anywhere else, for that 
matter. It is unnecessary, it is unscien-
tific, and in the case of children, it is 
cruel. 
I think I speak for millions of Ameri-
cans when I say: Mask mandates have 
long since outlived their usefulness and 
their welcome. We have all but won the 
war against the Wuhan coronavirus. It 
is time for us to act like it, to reclaim 
victory and reclaim our freedom.

FOURTH OF JULY 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak about how far our 
Nation has come in the past 6 months. 
Just for a moment, think back to 
where we were in January. Every day, 
hundreds of thousands of Americans 
were being diagnosed with COVID–19, 
and on many days, more than 3,000—or 
even 4,000—of our moms and dads and 
brothers and sisters and children and 
friends and neighbors were dying of 
this horrible disease. Meanwhile, mil-
lions of Americans were out of work 
just 6 months ago, and small businesses 
were unsure whether or not they could 
reopen safely. During these cold, dark 
days, it was easy to wonder if things 
would ever get better. 
But something else happened in Jan-
uary. On January 20, President Joe 
Biden and Vice President KAMALA HAR-
RIS were sworn into office, and with 
their inauguration came a laser focus 
on defeating this horrific disease and 
getting our country moving again. 
They had some amazing tools in their 
arsenals: vaccines that proved to be 
more effective than anyone could have 
hoped—thank goodness. And I am so 
proud that Michigan workers at Pfizer 
have played a big role in producing 
these lifesaving vaccines and getting 
them shipped all over the country. 
When 
President 
Biden 
and 
Vice 
President HARRIS took office, only 5 
percent of American adults had re-
ceived at least one shot. Now, only 6 
months later, 70 percent of Americans 
over age 30 have received at least one 
shot. That is a total of 300 million vac-
cine shots in only 150 days, and we are 
seeing the results. 
This 
week, 
Michigan 
Governor 
Gretchen Whitmer was able to drop our 
State’s pandemic restrictions. That is 
great news for our small businesses and 
our restaurants and our entertainment 
venues, just in time for peak travel 
season in beautiful Michigan. 
Nationwide, more than 2 million jobs 
have been created since President 
Biden took office—2 million jobs since 
he took office just 6 months ago. Half 
as many people are applying for unem-
ployment each month as were in Janu-
ary. And, next month, families will 
begin to receive advance child tax cred-
its that are going to lift half of the 
poor children in our country out of 
poverty—incredible. 
These 
monthly 
payments of $250 or $300 per child will 
help families pay for the things they 
need to care for their children, and it 
will also boost the economy. 
We have made amazing progress, and 
it wouldn’t have been possible without 
leadership 
from 
the 
White 
House, 
around $20 billion in funding for vac-
cines from Congress, the dedication of 
our medical professionals, the hard 
work of our small businesses that have 
done so much to keep their employees 
and their customers safe, and the will-
ingness of so many Americans to lit-
erally roll up their sleeves to protect 
themselves and each other. 
It is true that we have a lot more to 
do, of course. Many families and com-
munities are still struggling to get 
back on their feet. We need to continue 
to support our small businesses that 
have been through so much. 
We know that some States and re-
gions are lagging behind on vaccina-
tions for a number of reasons. That is 
so unfortunate because we know that 
these vaccinations are safe, they are 
free to receive, and they are amazingly 
effective. The numbers prove it. 
On January 23, 3,322 Americans died 
of coronavirus in a single day, and, yes-
terday, 370 people died of coronavirus 
in the United States. Of course, that is 
still 370 too many lives lost. Each one 
of those lives was precious, and our 
hearts are with everyone who is griev-
ing. 
There is still a risk that variants will 
spread and cases could rise again, espe-
cially in areas with low vaccination 
rates, which is why it is so critical that 
people get vaccinated. It is so impor-
tant to get vaccinated, not only for 
yourselves but for your friends, for 
your neighbors, and for your children. 
We have come a long way—a really 
long way—in the last 6 months. It is 
really amazing, and it is just in time 
for the Fourth of July. Americans have 
a lot to celebrate this Independence 
Day. It is a day when we give thanks 
for our Nation and for the freedoms we 
enjoy as Americans, and this year we 
have a few extra freedoms to celebrate: 
the freedom to get together with 
friends again, the freedom to eat din-
ner at a favorite local restaurant, the 
freedom to attend a live music event or 
go to a movie, the freedom to live our 
lives with a lot less fear—a lot less 
fear—and the freedom to give our loved 
ones a hug. And I know I am cherishing 
every hug I can give my 95-year-old 
mom. 
All of these freedoms are thanks to 
science and an administration that be-
lieves in science, and the willingness of 
Americans to trust the science. 
To my fellow Americans, thank you 
for that. 
Thank you to our President, and 
happy Fourth of July.

GROWING CLIMATE SOLUTIONS 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, today 
has been great day for the American 
people, a great day for our democracy 
and for bipartisanship. Some of you 
may know that just hours ago, over at 
the White House, a determined group of 
Republicans and Democrats, led by 
Senator KYRSTEN SINEMA, Senator ROB 
PORTMAN, Senator JOE MANCHIN, Sen-
ator SUSAN COLLINS, and a number of 
others, announced a deal on an infra-
structure package with the White 
House that represents the largest in-
vestment in infrastructure in a genera-
tion. 
This is a big accomplishment that I 
will talk about in a few moments, but 
I also want to bring attention to some-
thing that happened earlier today on 
the floor here that may just go over-
looked because of the other important 
news of the day. 
By a vote of 92 to 8, this Senate 
passed the Growing Climate Solutions 
Act, introduced by my friend and col-
league from Michigan Senator DEBBIE 
STABENOW, the chair of the Agriculture 
Committee, and my friend and col-
league from Indiana Senator MIKE 
BRAUN, who is my cochair of the Cli-
mate Solutions Caucus. 
This bill, the Growing Climate Solu-
tions Act, is a great example of how we 
can bring everyone to the table to find 
common ground on solutions that will 
protect our environment, help create 
jobs, and combat climate change. 
It will help farmers and foresters in 
Delaware, in Michigan, in Texas, across 
our whole country, and we will benefit 
from changes in the way that they care 
for their land or forests, and it will 
help them to participate in carbon 
credit markets. It will provide a frame-
work for rewarding America’s farms 
and forests, and those who tend them, 
for climate-smart practices. 
This is a commonsense, broadly bi-
partisan bill that will help us create a 
more sustainable future for our com-
munities, our country, and our planet, 
with our farmers and our agriculture 
community taking the lead. 
It reminds me of another signature 
moment that happened just at the very 
end of last year when, in December, the 
bipartisan Energy Act of 2020 was 
passed. 
Senators 
MURKOWSKI
and 
MANCHIN shepherded that into law late 
last year, and it modernizes our coun-
try’s energy policies across a dozen dif-
ferent major areas. 
Each of these bills—the Growing Cli-
mate Solutions Act and the Energy Act 
of 2020—were, in part, fostered by the 
bipartisan Senate Climate Solutions 
Caucus. Founded in 2019, this caucus 
has held more than 30 events and meet-
ings, including many focused on nat-
ural climate solutions such as the 
Growing Climate Solutions Act. 
Every Member, all 14 Members, of 
this bipartisan caucus cosponsored the 
Growing Climate Solutions Act, and I 
applaud Senators STABENOW and BRAUN 
for building a significant coalition here 
in the Senate to support it, a coalition 
that ranged from some of the most en-
gaged and active environmental groups 
to the American Farm Bureau, one of 
the strongest voices for America’s agri-
cultural community. 
Our work on climate is far from done. 
Members of the Climate Solutions Cau-
cus have introduced a whole series of 
bipartisan bills that would promote 
natural 
climate 
solutions. 
Senator 
PORTMAN and I have the Tropical For-
est and Coral Reef Conservation Reau-
thorization Act; Senator SHAHEEN is 
leading the Forest Incentives Program 
Act; Senator RUBIO, the Restoring Re-
silient Reefs Act; and many more. 
We should advance these and many 
other bipartisan bills that every Mem-
ber of our caucus supports and on 
which we are taking the lead. Let me 
be clear. I support bold action on cli-
mate. I support President Biden’s cli-
mate agenda. And there are many more 
things we can and should do, but I 
think it is possible for us to both move 
ahead on those things that have endur-
ing bipartisan support in this Chamber 
and across the country and to move 
ahead on those things that perhaps do 
not yet enjoy bipartisan support but 
where the need to act is urgent. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, let me 
also, if I can, speak for a few more mo-
ments about the historic deal reached 
earlier today on infrastructure. 
This is about creating jobs. This is 
about investing in our economy and 
our communities and our country, and 
this is about strengthening the United 
States globally against our adversaries 
and competitors. 
I need not remind you that just 1 
year ago public health and economic 
crises created by the COVID–19 pan-
demic were ravaging communities all 
over our Nation. And today, under the 
leadership of the Biden administration, 
COVID–19 cases and deaths are down by 
over 90 percent. More than 70 percent 
of adults over the age of 30 have been 
vaccinated. As a result, businesses are 
opening, 
communities 
are 
opening, 
States are opening, our unemployment 
rate has come down significantly, and 
our economy is recovering at a robust 
pace. 
But if our economy is going to be 
sustainable, if it is going to be long 
term, if it is going to be robust, we 
have to make long-overdue invest-
ments in infrastructure. Globally, the 
United States now ranks 13th in infra-
structure. In every State, we have 
roads, bridges, tunnels, and water sys-
tems that are crumbling or aged. Just 
in my little State of Delaware, we have 
more than 200 miles of highway deemed 
in poor condition. 
And as the climate continues to 
change, low-lying States like mine are 
particularly susceptible to increased 
damage. We had more than 10 extreme 
weather events causing up to $2 billion 
of damage in the last decade, and a lot 
of that damaged our infrastructure be-
cause it is built right up against the 
waterways, the coasts, the bays. 
We have one of the most important 
rail lines in the entire country, the

Northeast corridor, that runs right 
through Wilmington, DE. One day 
without service on this Northeast cor-
ridor costs our economy $100 million. 
And that day isn’t hypothetical; it hap-
pened during Superstorm Sandy, the 
hurricane that pummeled the east 
coast a few years ago. 
Across our State and every State, in-
frastructure is in dire need of repair, of 
resiliency, and of upgrade, and doing 
that can help create jobs and strength-
en our country. 
We are losing our competitive edge, 
and our global competitors, like China, 
are outpacing us. That is why I was so 
encouraged to see the bipartisan U.S. 
Innovation and Competition Act pass 
this body just a few weeks ago. A key 
piece of it was the bipartisan CHIPS 
Act that recognizes we need to invest 
in cutting-edge R&D, in semiconduc-
tors, and in the industries of the fu-
ture. 
But we can’t move people, capital, 
products, and ideas if we don’t invest 
in 
our 
infrastructure—in 
the 
broadband, the highways, the ports, 
and the roads that make us competi-
tive globally. 
The $559 billion in new Federal spend-
ing on infrastructure that is the core of 
the deal announced today is a down-
payment on rebuilding our roads and 
bridges, fixing our lines of public tran-
sit, and expanding port and airport ca-
pacity. It also includes $47 billion to-
ward 
climate 
resiliency, 
critically 
needed work to make sure that our in-
frastructure can sustain the growing 
storms all across our country. 
I think this is a once-in-a-generation 
opportunity to put America on the 
right track and exactly at a moment 
when the leaders of China and Russia 
are telling the world that American de-
mocracy can’t work; that the riot that 
occurred in this building on January 6 
is foreshadowing the collapse, the fail-
ure of American democracy. It is im-
portant for us to show our citizens here 
at home and our competitors abroad 
that American democracy still works 
and that we can deliver meaningful so-
lutions for our States, for our country, 
and for the world. 
There is a lot more for us to accom-
plish on President Biden’s agenda—the 
American Jobs Plan and the American 
Families Plan—and we will have to 
move that forward, but I think this is 
a day for us to celebrate legislating to-
gether and finding a pathway to the 
House and to the President’s desk for 
the biggest investment in infrastruc-
ture of my lifetime. 
This is a great day for this institu-
tion and our country.

TRIBUTE TO LYNNE TERRY 
PHIFER 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise 
today in this Chamber to pay tribute 
to a dedicated Delawarean, a friend 
who is wrapping up 36 years of public 
service to our State and our Nation. 
Lynne Terry Phifer of Newark, DE, a 
valued member of my Senate staff, is 
retiring at the end of this month. She 
has been a high-spirited, pure-hearted 
presence for us as long as I have known 
her, and I am deeply grateful to Lynne 
for her service and grateful for her sig-
nificant contributions. 
Before I say farewell, though, it is 
only fitting to highlight her long ca-
reer and offer up some thanks and 
some thoughts from her friends, fam-
ily, coworkers, and well-wishers. 
Her story didn’t start and doesn’t end 
with her more than 8 years serving in 
my offices for the Senate and for Wil-
mington, DE. She grew up in a commu-
nity along the banks of Naamans 
Creek, where it empties into the Dela-
ware River. It is known as Claymont, 
DE, an area that has become better 
known, perhaps, because of Claymont’s 
favorite son, our President, Joe Biden. 
Lynne 
graduated 
from 
Claymont 
High School in 1972, the same year 
Biden was first elected to this Cham-
ber. It was at Claymont High School 
where, some members of my staff re-
port, in good humor, Lynne made a 
name for herself ‘‘playing a mean clari-
net.’’ I didn’t know clarinets could be 
mean. 
Lynne’s public service career began 
shortly thereafter. She started a 10- 
year run with Delaware’s Department 
of Labor, the Department of Health 
and Social Services, and the Division of 
Personnel. After that, her career con-
tinued across city, county, State, and 
Federal governments. 
From 1988 to 1992, she worked for 
well-known Mayor Dan Frawley of Wil-
mington. She later took on similar re-
sponsibilities for our Lieutenant Gov-
ernor and now-Governor, John Carney, 
and later for Paul Clark, my successor 
as county executive in New Castle 
County. Paul said it was his good for-
tune to have hired Lynne. 
She was a shining light in the field of gov-
ernment service— 
County Executive Clark said— 
and an absolute joy to work with. I am 
privileged to call Lynne my friend and wish 
her the best in retirement. 
Governor Carney offered similar sen-
timents, saying: 
When I was Lieutenant Governor, Lynne 
helped make our office run smoothly and al-
ways offered a helping hand to constituents. 
She is a compassionate, hardworking col-
league and a good friend, and I am personally 
grateful for Lynne’s many years of dedicated 
service. . . . I wish her and her family all the 
best in retirement. 
For more than 8 years in my office in 
Wilmington, 
Lynne 
has 
seamlessly 
managed my front office and my col-
lege internship program. And I can’t 
tell you how hard a job it is to be the 
person who answers the phone, day in 
and day out, particularly when serving 
a Senator like me who seems to draw 
all sorts of attention and angry phone 
calls. 
So Lynne, thank you in particular 
for handling all the calls and com-
plaints and concerns of Delawareans 
who call in day in and day out. 
Lynne has remained our beloved 
gatekeeper, the first person to greet 
visitors, the familiar voice on the main 
telephone line, someone who has han-
dled sometimes literally hundreds of 
calls a day. She is known for being reli-
able and trustworthy. She is highly re-
garded by my whole team and recog-
nized for her breadth of knowledge of 
our State, who is who, which call needs 
to be answered first, who are the mov-
ers and shakers. 
She is known for always staying 
calm and professional when helping 
constituents. And, trust me, some of 
these calls can be incredibly emotional 
and difficult, whether assisting some-
one needing a vaccination appointment 
or dealing with a veterans benefit ques-
tion. 
She has run my internship program 
flawlessly, and that is a true testament 
to Lynne. During her more than 8 years 
of running that, she has interviewed, 
hired, trained, mentored, and sup-
ported more than 150 college interns— 
a good number of whom have gone on 
to join our full-time professional staff. 
She is, as Brendan Mackie would say, 
a true force multiplier. Several of our 
interns, as I have mentioned, have gone 
on to be staff, both in Wilmington and 
in Washington, and many others have 
gone on to executive branch Agencies 
or to be activists, attorneys, nonprofit 
leaders, mentors, and volunteers. 
It is a profound understatement to 
say that my team and I, and my wife 
Annie and I, will deeply miss Lynne. 
Annie and I have known Lynne going 
all the way back to their time together 
in the Women’s Democratic Club of 
Delaware, when we were young couples 
and looking forward to someday both 
being parents of twins. 
On my current staff, Marcus Wright, 
who is my outreach coordinator, added: 
Lynne is always at the top of her game. As 
her counterpart in DC, I [learned to] lean on 
her knowledge and followed her example. 
She helped me be a better staffer, and I owe 
her an enormous debt of gratitude. 
Desiree Burritt, one of my most sea-
soned and capable caseworkers, said: 
Lynne is ever-present and incredibly de-
pendable. 
Jessica Glass, my deputy scheduler 
said: 
Lynne not only helped me through the in-
tern program . . . but I’m learning so much 
. . . sitting on the other side [now] and get-
ting to interview interns with her! She . . . 
[has] watched me go full circle during the 
past four years. 
Brian Cunningham, a beloved former 
staffer, said: 
I always appreciated Lynne’s warm greet-
ings to the littlest guests in the office— 
He means his kids— 
when [my] kids came to visit, or sit with 
their parent to help finish out the workday, 
it was Lynne who . . . had a stash of snacks 
[and always a kind word]. 
Among her coworkers, she has earned 
a 
lot 
of 
good-natured 
nicknames: 
Lynney, 
Lynney-Boo, 
Lynne-yrd 
Skynyrd, and others I won’t repeat, but 
she is clearly omnipresent in the 
hearts and minds of those who served 
alongside her in Delaware.

Her dedication goes far beyond gov-
ernment service. She has volunteered 
her time with so many groups. I men-
tioned the Women’s Democratic Club. 
She has also served as chair of the 22nd 
Representative 
District 
Committee, 
serving Hockessin, Pike Creek, North 
Star, and Newark for many, many 
years. 
And she was honored with the Distin-
guished Service Award from the New 
Castle County Democrats in 2008 for 
her tireless service. 
On the homefront, her pride and joy 
include Dennis Phifer, her husband, 
and their twin sons, Matthew and 
Christopher. 
We can’t forget the beloved family 
canine, Elle. In her retirement, Lynne 
will have more time to spend with Den-
nis, Matt, and Chris, and her network 
of friends, going all the way back to 
her Claymont days. She looks forward 
to spending her mornings with Dennis, 
she says, making him coffee, reading 
the paper together, and staying up 
late, as Dennis dozes off, trying to fin-
ish the daily crossword. 
She surely will have more time with 
Elle, walking her around the neighbor-
hood and spoiling her with treats. Den-
nis said of Lynne, who absolutely loves 
animals, that she wants to use her new-
found time to volunteer to help service 
dogs and other support animals. 
Alice Paul, the famous suffragette, in 
speaking about the fight for women’s 
rights, said: ‘‘I always feel the move-
ment is a . . . mosaic. Each of us puts 
in [our own] little stone, and then’’ at 
the end, you see a beautiful mosaic. 
When looking back at Lynne’s years 
of public service—36 years—this anal-
ogy seems apt. Lynne has been a hard- 
working and headstrong person, some-
one who has done incredible things, 
often behind the scenes, and helped cre-
ate her own great mosaic through her 
decades of dedication and service to 
our community, our city, our county, 
our State, and this Senate. 
Whether it was throwing her support 
behind Joe Biden amid a Senate reelec-
tion run or helping constituents in my 
office or the hundreds of folks she has 
trained and recruited and mentored, 
Lynne’s mosaic will last long and reach 
far, leaving her mark on Delaware for 
many, many years to come. 
Lynne will undoubtedly continue to 
accomplish 
good 
and 
meaningful 
things, finding those moments in small 
pieces of colored stone or glass or ce-
ramic and putting those in place, add-
ing to her ongoing mosaic of life. 
In closing, through her career, her 
volunteerism, and her civic activism, 
Lynne has made a real difference. I 
can’t thank her enough for her first- 
class dedication and her friendship. 
Lynne will be deeply missed in the Sen-
ate, and filling her shoes will be near 
impossible. 
Lynne, thank you. Best of luck in all 
your future endeavors. You are treas-
ured, and we will cheer you on your 
way as you celebrate this next chapter 
of your life. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, dat-
ing back to his time as a Member of 
the Senate, President Biden—then-Sen-
ator Biden—frequently shared a piece 
of advice from his dad: 
Don’t tell me what you value. Show me 
your budget, and I’ll tell you what you 
value. 
He is not wrong. We have heard 
countless iterations of the same mes-
sage from President Biden. Actions 
speak louder than words. Talk is cheap. 
Or, as we say in Texas, sometimes 
someone is all hat and no cattle. 
So I want to take President Biden up 
on his advice. We have spent plenty of 
time hearing what his values are. He 
has talked about the importance of re-
building our economy following the 
pandemic. We all agree with that—re-
storing public trust in government, 
check; protecting low- and middle-in-
come families from tax hikes, check; 
and standing up to Russia and China, 
the two greatest threats to the world 
order. These are priorities shared by 
Americans with diverse political views, 
and they are critical goals that any 
President—Republican or Democrat— 
should have. 
But we don’t have to take the Presi-
dent at his word when he talks about 
the importance of each of these things 
because we have his budget. We have a 
written plan from the President of the 
United States, outlining how his ad-
ministration wants to turn his spoken 
intentions into concrete action. 
So based upon President Biden’s 
budget, what does he value? It just 
takes a quick glance to see that re-
sponsible spending is not one of the 
things that he values. The overall 
pricetag of the President’s budget is a 
whopping $6.4 trillion. Even with the 
President’s massive tax hikes, the 
United States would still be running 
more than a trillion dollar deficit each 
year. 
It would only take 2 years for our 
debt burden to reach the highest level 
in American history, surpassing even 
World War II-era debt. 
As a reminder, the government has 
spent a massive amount of money over 
the last 15 months, as we know. Much 
of it was a necessary investment in our 
fight against COVID–19. 
On top of that funding, though, our 
Democratic colleagues circumvented 
the bipartisan legislative process and 
added an additional $2 trillion on a 
host of partisan pet projects, only 
about 10 percent of which related to 
COVID–19, even though that was the 
caption on the bill—a COVID–19 relief 
bill that was only 10 percent COVID–19. 
Now, perhaps nobody expected the 
President to dramatically cut spending 
and solve our national debt problems in 
one go, but this is not a time, after 
trillions of dollars of necessary COVID– 
19 spending, to go on another unrelated 
spending spree, especially once you see 
where all the money is going. Once 
again, this is his budget; these are his 
values. 
One of the most critical lines in any 
President’s 
budget 
is 
discretionary 
spending. For a decade, my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle have 
pined for parity between defense and 
nondefense spending. But as soon as 
they get unified government—majority 
in the House, majority in Senate, and 
the White House—what do they do? 
Well, they abandon that parity argu-
ment and provide a measly 2-percent 
increase to defense spending while pro-
viding a 16-percent increase in the 
President’s budget to domestic spend-
ing—hardly parity. 
The Federal Government simply can-
not provide for the common defense 
without the resources to do so. In the 
face of growing threats, which we all 
have 
acknowledged—China, 
Russia, 
Iran, North Korea—you would think 
that the President would propose a 
substantial increase in defense spend-
ing, but he proposed a whopping 2 per-
cent. 
Now, compare that to the Depart-
ment of Education, where the Presi-
dent’s budget calls for a 41-percent in-
crease, a 28-percent increase for the De-
partment of Commerce, and a 22-per-
cent increase for the Environmental 
Protection Agency. Well, when you ad-
just for inflation, the small increase 
for defense spending actually rep-
resents a decrease. 
The Department of Defense isn’t the 
only national security Agency that the 
Biden budget expects to do with less. 
Even with a humanitarian crisis on our 
border, the budget for the Department 
of Homeland Security remains flat. 
Once again, after inflation, that will 
represent a decrease in spending over 
the current year. 
Customs and Border Protection per-
sonnel are working overtime to take 
care of unaccompanied children, to 
stop dangerous drugs from crossing our 
border, and to enforce the laws that we 
in Congress have passed. They need 
more support to handle the situation in 
a fair and humane way. Cutting al-
ready thin resources for the entire De-
partment will only make the cir-
cumstances at the border more dan-
gerous—for law enforcement, for local 
communities that are being overrun by 
the huge numbers of people coming 
across the border—and a danger to the 
migrants themselves. 
If this $6.4 trillion budget doesn’t 
support our most urgent priorities, 
what does it support? What priorities 
are so critical that they supersede the 
need to support our national security 
and protect our borders? 
Well, for one, the administration 
would double the size of the Internal 
Revenue Service. I am sure that is good 
news to every taxpaying American. 
The President has called for increasing 
the number of IRS agents by 15 percent 
a year for the next decade.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4752 
June 24, 2021 
We have previously seen the damage 
that a politically motivated IRS can 
do. We saw the apparent leaking of tax-
payer information recently, which is 
supposed to be confidential by law. And 
we can remember the IRS targeting 
controversy under the Obama adminis-
tration. 
Bureaucrats at the IRS subjected 
conservative groups that they dis-
agreed with politically or ideologically 
to a different level of scrutiny than 
left-leaning 
groups. 
And, 
unfortu-
nately, with this sort of huge invest-
ment in the IRS, it looks like the 
Biden administration simply wants to 
weaponize the IRS once again. 
But that is just the start of it. A 
massive portion of the President’s 
budget stems from two of the programs 
he has already told us about—one being 
the $2.6 trillion American Jobs Plan, 
which relies on a very generous inter-
pretation of the word ‘‘infrastructure,’’ 
and it reads like the Green New Deal 
2.0: more than $200 billion to build or 
retrofit more than 2 million affordable 
and sustainable places to live; a civil-
ian climate corps; and an unrealistic 
100-percent renewable-generated elec-
tricity by 2035. 
His budget includes a range of other 
spending to address climate change, in-
cluding over $1 billion to help other 
countries—not 
Americans, 
not 
the 
United States, but other countries—to 
lower their emissions. 
I am sure China will be glad to take 
our money while continuing to build 
coal-fired powerplants to meet the de-
mands of their growing economy. 
Then there is a broad range of spend-
ing from President Biden’s $1.8 trillion 
so-called American Families Plan—you 
have got to love the names of these 
pieces of legislation—which includes 
everything from universal preschool 
and free community college to manda-
tory paid leave policies and using the 
Tax Code to disguise more Washington 
spending. 
If you read through the President’s 
budget, which, as he said, reflects his 
values, you see the incredible way that 
President Biden is simply caving in to 
the radical left. Mothers are no longer 
called mothers. They are now called 
‘‘birthing people’’—unbelievably. 
Well, it is one thing for far-left activ-
ists to use these kinds of terms on 
Twitter, but it is entirely different to 
diminish the role of women in an offi-
cial government document. Women are 
more than ‘‘birthing people,’’ and I 
think it is insulting to women to char-
acterize them or define them by that. 
The President doubled down on the 
woke ideology by proposing taxpayer 
funding for abortion. We know abortion 
is enormously controversial in our so-
ciety, but this is a jarring break from 
a decades-long bipartisan, consensual 
ban provided by the Hyde amendment. 
It is also stands in stark contrast in 
the views of most Americans. The ma-
jority of Americans say they oppose 
using taxpayer dollars to support abor-
tions because they are morally or reli-
giously opposed to the practice. 
Adding to the list of absurdities is a 
massive expansion of welfare. We al-
ready know that under the COVID–19 
relief bills, the administration has ar-
gued in favor of paying people more not 
to work than they would earn if they 
did work. 
A number of Governors—more than 
20 of them now—have refused the $300 
weekly supplement because of their 
concern that this was actually discour-
aging people from returning to work. 
We are hearing from employers all 
across the country that it is hard, if 
not impossible, for them to find the 
workforce they need to get the econ-
omy growing again. Business owners in 
my State—and I would bet across the 
Country—are already struggling to find 
a reliable workforce following the over-
ly generous pandemic-related unem-
ployment benefits that our Democratic 
colleagues insisted upon. 
We can’t continue to discourage 
Americans from going back to work, 
because our economy will never re-
cover if we stay on that path. 
Overall, the President’s budget would 
dramatically increase the size of gov-
ernment and the role it plays in our ev-
eryday 
lives, 
especially 
with 
edu-
cation—as 
my 
friend 
Senator 
TIM 
SCOTT
has said, putting Washington 
even more in the middle of Americans’ 
lives, from the cradle to college. Is that 
really what the American dream is all 
about—more and bigger government in-
tervening in our lives, denying us the 
freedom to make our own choices and 
to seek our own way? 
It is no wonder that the White House 
rolled out the President’s budget so 
quietly. Frequently, a lot of this hap-
pens on Friday afternoons after the 
press has left and nobody is paying 
much attention. 
While President Biden has told us 
what he values over and over again, his 
budget actually speaks to much more. 
This is not the plan of someone who is 
fighting for a strong national defense 
and a swift economic recovery. This 
budget prioritizes climate justice over 
American military servicemembers. It 
further hampers our economic recovery 
at the expense of hard-working tax-
payers, and it prioritizes the restric-
tion of wealth over the prospect of eco-
nomic growth, which would lift all 
boats. It digs the United States deeper 
and deeper into debt, creating a mas-
sive financial pit that our children and 
grandchildren will have to dig their 
way out of. We are writing the checks, 
but they will pay the bills, and that, I 
believe, is immoral. 
It is all well and good to tell the 
American people that you value the 
same things they value—freedom, secu-
rity, prosperity—but this, which in 
President Biden’s own words reflects 
his values, this is not a blueprint to re-
build America. This is, indeed, strong 
evidence that President Biden has 
bowed down to the woke political left 
in his own base and is ready to bury 
the United States and future genera-
tions with unprecedented debt. 
When he released his budget, Presi-
dent Biden said, ‘‘Where we choose to 
invest speaks to what we value as a Na-
tion.’’ The President of the United 
States has made clear what he values. 
The Nation? Its future? Its prosperity? 
Its security? Not much.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

FOURTH OF JULY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
often come to this floor to be able to 
speak about news of the day, disagree-
ments that we have, ways that we can 
solve a problem we have as a nation. 
Today, I come to tell a story. 
In 1774, an Englishman met Benjamin 
Franklin. They spent a lot of time to-
gether in conversations, and Franklin 
convinced this young sailor and writer 
and young friend to move to America, 
to move to his hometown, to Philadel-
phia. A few months later, 1774, he did. 
Franklin 
saw 
something 
in 
this 
young man that no one else saw. That 
Englishman who loved freedom and 
who saw the glaring injustice of the 
British Crown, 2 years later, on Janu-
ary 10, 1776, wrote a short pamphlet 
that changed the course of history. 
The man’s name was Thomas Paine, 
and the short work that he wrote was 
called ‘‘Common Sense.’’ It was the 
first 
publication 
that 
declared 
we 
should call for independence for these 
13 Colonies. It didn’t include his name 
because if it included his name, it 
would have been a certain death war-
rant from the King, but it made the 
case for freedom for each person, for an 
elected government rather than a mon-
archy, and the case for religious lib-
erty. In short, he made the case for the 
United States of America. 
He wrote these words: 
The cause of America is, in great measure, 
the 
cause 
of 
all 
mankind. 
Many 
cir-
cumstances have, and will arise, which are 
not local, but universal, and through which 
the principles of all lovers of mankind are af-
fected, and in the event of which, their affec-
tions are interesting. 
He wrote about the rule of law and 
how that would be different than living 
under a monarchy, and he challenged 
the young colonists to be able to pur-
sue more. 
He wrote: 
But where says some is the king of Amer-
ica? I’ll tell you Friend, he reigns above, and 
doth not make havoc of mankind like the 
Royal Brute of Great Britain. Yet that we 
may not appear to be defective even in earth-
ly honors, let a day be solemnly set apart for 
proclaiming the charter; let it be brought 
forth placed on the divine law, the word of 
God; let a crown be placed thereon, by which

the world may know, that so far we may ap-
prove of monarchy, that in America the law 
is king. For as in absolute governments the 
king is law, so in free countries the law 
ought to be king. 
He wrote: 
As to religion, I hold it to be the indispen-
sable duty of [every] government, to protect 
all conscientious professors thereof, and I 
know of no other business which government 
hath to do therewith. 
Suspicion is the companion of mean souls. 
. . . 
He wrote and he said: 
It affords us a larger field for our Christian 
kindness. Were we all one way of thinking, 
our religious dispositions would want matter 
for probation; and on this liberal principle, I 
look to the various denominations among us, 
to be like children of the same family, dif-
fering only, in what is called, their Christian 
names. 
He shared a lot of great ideals in 
‘‘Common Sense.’’ He challenged the 
colonists to dream of an America that 
would set the example for the world. 
Thomas Paine’s ideas weren’t all 
great, and we didn’t accept all of his 
ideas. In fact, he wrote a long section 
in ‘‘Common Sense’’ saying that when 
we form our own Constitution, we 
should take these 13 Colonies and we 
should elect a President and alternate 
among each State, so each State 
would, in turn, have a different Presi-
dent for the whole group. It is a fairly 
terrible idea that we never imple-
mented. But this passion about the law 
being king, we did; this passion about 
religious liberty, we did; this passion 
that America would be an example to 
all mankind, we did. 
One hundred fifty thousand copies of 
‘‘Common Sense’’ were printed. That is 
an enormous number for that time pe-
riod. On that January day when the 
first printings of ‘‘Common Sense’’ 
started being passed around the Colo-
nies, it fanned the flame of that spark 
of freedom in the hearts of the colo-
nists. 
By June 11, 1776, Congress had ap-
pointed a committee of five to draft 
the Declaration: John Adams of Massa-
chusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Penn-
sylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, 
Robert Livingston of New York, and 
Robert Sherman of Connecticut—by 
the way, I think two redheads in that 
group. 
The Declaration ended with this sim-
ple paragraph. We are familiar with 
that Declaration. It said: 
We, therefore, the Representatives of the 
united States of America, in General Con-
gress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme 
Judge of the world for the rectitude of our 
intentions, do, in the Name and by the Au-
thority of the good People of these Colonies, 
solemnly publish and declare, That these 
united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be 
Free and Independent States. 
It ended with this: 
And for the support of this Declaration, 
with a firm reliance on the protection of the 
Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to 
each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our 
sacred Honor. 
And they gave their all. John Hart, 
one of the signers of the Declaration, 
from New Jersey, ended up hiding in 
the woods that December of 1776, just a 
few months later, while the Hessian 
soldiers hunted him across the coun-
tryside. He died before the war’s end. 
Richard Stockton, also of New Jer-
sey, wasn’t so lucky. He was dragged 
from his bed, thrown into prison, and 
treated like a criminal. His home was 
looted, his fortune stripped away. 
Thomas Nelson of Virginia: He com-
manded the militia and served as a 
Governor during the Revolution. He 
had to instruct the artillerymen to fire 
at his own house when the British 
started using it as their headquarters. 
Nelson had used his personal credit to 
raise money for the cause. The Revolu-
tion left him in distress, and he was 
unable to ever recover what he had 
lost. 
Thomas Heyward, Arthur Middleton, 
and Edward Rutledge were three South 
Carolina signers who served in their 
State’s militia and were captured when 
the British seized Charleston. They 
spent the rest of the time in prison. 
They pledged their lives, their for-
tunes, and their sacred honor. 
By that December, when all of this 
was going on to all of these signers of 
the Declaration, Thomas Paine wrote 
again, and this time, he wrote directly 
to the patriots serving with George 
Washington. In the freezing winter, on 
December 23, 1776, Thomas Paine wrote 
these words: 
These are the times that try men’s souls; 
the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot 
will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of 
[their] country; but he that stands it now, 
deserves the love and thanks of man and 
woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily con-
quered; yet we have this consolation with us, 
that the harder the conflict, the more glo-
rious the triumph. What we obtain too 
cheap, we esteem too lightly: It is dearness 
only that gives every [living] thing its value. 
Heaven knows how to put a proper price 
upon its goods; and it would be strange in-
deed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM 
should not be highly rated. 
It is a good thing for us to be able to 
stop and reflect on these simple words: 
What we obtain too cheap we esteem 
too lightly. Sometimes I am afraid 
that, as we approach the Fourth of 
July each year, we will have forgotten 
the sacrifices of previous generations. 
In our time period and in this wealthy 
moment in our Nation’s history, we 
seem to esteem too lightly what was 
obtained too cheaply, and we forget the 
great sacrifices of the past. 
Generation after generation of Amer-
ican history has set an example of how 
we have worked for a more perfect 
Union. Generation after generation has 
served each other and the children who 
have come after them so that they 
could have a better future. It is our 
generation’s turn. The generation that 
I speak of could have never dreamed of 
the Capitol that stands on this hill. 
The generation that I speak of could 
have never dreamed of the 50 States 
that would cover this continent, but 
they did dream this, because it is in 
Thomas Paine’s introduction: ‘‘The 
cause of America is in great measure 
the cause of all mankind.’’ 
This Fourth of July, we should re-
commit ourselves to the cause of free-
dom, the future of our Nation, and the 
service to our children and the children 
not yet born. We are still a great na-
tion, conceived in liberty, born to 
greatness if we are willing to work and 
sacrifice and give for each other. No 
generation in the history of the world 
has inherited more than we have—no 
generation. We should not receive it 
too cheaply or hold it too lightly. 
Ironically, as I end my story of an 
Englishman who became a writer and 
the inspiration of a nation, I must tell 
you the end. Thomas Paine died a bit-
ter and broken man. He remained a 
revolutionary in the fight. He could 
never stop searching for the next revo-
lution. He went off to France to sup-
port the French Revolution and almost 
lost his head for it. He ended up in pris-
on there. He came back to America and 
determined that George Washington 
wasn’t as loyal as he was. He spent his 
last years writing against President 
Washington: that he was the real trai-
tor and that he wasn’t strong enough. 
He ended up dying alone, isolated, re-
jecting his faith—and a bitter man. 
My fellow Senators and fellow Ameri-
cans, the war has been won. Freedom, 
that gift, has been passed on to us. 
Let’s protect it. Let’s cherish it. Let’s 
pass it on. 
Each generation should be passionate 
about passing that on to the next gen-
eration. That is why, on this Fourth of 
July, it is not just a day off; it is not 
just a day to be at the mall; it is not 
just a great day to be at a lake—it is a 
great day to contemplate how you will 
serve our Nation in the days ahead in 
this generation and how you can pass 
on the freedom that we have to our 
children. 
Our Nation still needs people who 
will build on the foundation of liberty. 
We need writers and soldiers and farm-
ers and moms and dads. We still need 
people who will run for city council 
and the school board, people who will 
pick up trash in the neighborhood, peo-
ple who will march in a protest and 
then intentionally go love people and 
work for the reconciliation of broken 
relationships. We need people who will 
start new businesses, give to non-
profits, get involved in their churches, 
and love their neighbors as themselves. 
We are free, but as the Bible says in 
1 Peter 2, we should live as free people 
but not use our freedom as a coverup 
for evil. 
Those of us who have freedom should 
help others to live in the same freedom 
we have and to serve with joy. That is 
the legacy that was passed on to us. 
That is the legacy we should pass 
down. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Alaska.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

June 24, 2021 
of the week. I get to come down to the 
Senate floor typically every Thursday 
and talk about Alaskans who are doing 
something amazing for their commu-
nities, their State, maybe even their 
country. Heck, this one is kind of doing 
something for the world, whom I refer 
to as the Alaskan of the Week. I love 
doing it. 
We have a really special Alaskan of 
the Week this week whom I am going 
to talk about, Lydia Jacoby—a very 
special 17-year-old who is from Seward, 
AK. We are so excited about this. 
Those of you who have been following 
our Alaskan of the Week speeches 
might notice that this is the first new 
poster board we have had ever. So this 
is the poster board of the Alaskan of 
the Week for Lydia because we are so 
excited about her. 
Before I talk about Lydia, I always 
like to say a little bit about what is 
going on in Alaska. 
A lot of people always ask about the 
light. They are curious about the light 
in the summer, particularly as we just 
had our summer solstice. If you want 
to come up and really see it, come on 
up. We are open. We would love to have 
you—a trip of a lifetime. If you are 
thinking about coming to Alaska, 
come to see it yourself this summer. 
Every American should come on up, 
but I will give you a hint. On the light 
that is happening right now, if you 
were in Seward, AK, where Lydia is 
from, the Sun will rise at 4:33 a.m. and 
set at 11:26 p.m., with a loss of just 36 
seconds from the summer solstice, 
which occurred a few days ago. That is 
a lot of sunlight, and it doesn’t really 
even get dark when the Sun goes down. 
It does just for a little bit. 
So it is a great time to be in the 
State. Come on up. It is a great time to 
be in Alaska, and I can’t wait to get 
home for the recess, our Fourth of 
July—lots of Sun, lots of excitement. 
There is particularly a lot of excite-
ment around this young, intrepid Alas-
kan, Lydia, who on Tuesday, in Omaha, 
NE, swam the second fastest time in 
the world in the women’s 100-meter 
breaststroke finals in the Olympic 
trials. 
She 
is 
the 
second 
fastest 
breaststroker in the world, and she is 
only 17. This cinched her spot to rep-
resent the United States in the Sum-
mer Olympics in Tokyo. This is an in-
credible and—I will admit it—a rather 
unlikely story that we are all so proud 
of in Alaska. 
With regard to the Olympics, Alas-
kans typically punch way above our 
weight. In the Winter Olympics, we 
really, really punch above our weight, 
with many, many Alaskans making the 
Olympic team for the Winter Olympics 
every 4 years. We have done well in the 
Summer Olympics as well. Olympic 
veteran, rugby player Alev Kelter, 
from Eagle River, will be competing 
this year. Shortly, will we will be 
learning if Allie Ostrander, who is a 
really amazing young woman, steeple-
chase champion and another incredible 
athlete, will be in the Olympics this 
year. We will learn soon. But we have 
never sent a swimmer to the Olympics. 
You don’t always equate Alaska and 
swimming. She will be the first, and 
Alaskans across the State are cheering 
on Lydia. So let me tell you a little bit 
about this remarkable young woman. 
Her parents, Leslie and Richard, are 
both boat camp captains. Leslie is the 
educational coordinator for the Marine 
Science Explorer Program at the Kenai 
Fjords Tours. Rich is a maritime in-
structor at the Alaska Vocational 
Technical Center, what we call AVTEC. 
By the way, a little aside: AVTEC 
does great work. I have really enjoyed 
my visits there. 
So, Rich, keep up the great job there. 
He is also a guy for Arctic and Ant-
arctic trips. 
So that is Mom and Dad. They moved 
to Alaska when Lydia was 9 years old. 
Richard came to the State in 1992 when 
he was fresh out of college, and like so 
many, they fell in love with the State 
and stayed. They raised their daughter, 
as I mentioned, in the town of Seward, 
AK. There are a little under 3,000 peo-
ple there, and it is just an hour south 
of Anchorage. It is nestled between 
Resurrection Bay and soaring moun-
tains. Its motto is ‘‘Alaska starts 
here.’’ 
I love Seward, AK. I get there as 
much as I can. I am going to be there 
in a couple of weeks, actually. It is 
known 
for 
stunning 
landscapes, 
a 
strong, 
generous 
community, 
and 
amazing people. So if you are visiting 
Alaska, you have to go to Seward. 
Leslie and Richard signed Lydia up 
for swim classes when she was just a 
toddler. She joined the swim club when 
she was 6 years old. When she was 10, 
she was selected for the Alaska Swim 
Zone Team. State qualifying meets al-
lowed her to go on trips. In between all 
of this, she was a musician, learning to 
play the guitar. She played at folk fes-
tivals. She was also in theater and in 
track—an all-around great athlete and 
an all-around great young woman. 
As she excelled at swimming, her 
parents continued to be, in their words, 
‘‘surprised and amazed.’’ Obviously, she 
has a deeply competitive streak, but 
you would not know it when you meet 
her. Her parents were surprised. ‘‘In 
the right setting, that streak can real-
ly be turned on,’’ Rich said. When she 
has a lousy race, she just shrugs it off. 
Her dad remembered one of her first 
swim meets when, halfway across the 
pool, she inhaled some water. She 
jumped out and didn’t want to get back 
in. Well, she is back in. As her dad said, 
she has come a long way. 
One 
of 
her 
coaches, 
Solomon 
D’Amico, describes her as ‘‘kind, quiet, 
confident.’’ He says she has an ‘‘intense 
fire,’’ and when she sets her mind to 
something, like the Olympics, she goes 
for it. 
Now, neither of her parents pushed 
her too hard—they wanted the drive to 
come from her, not them—but it cer-
tainly did come from her. 
Solomon, her coach, is a former ma-
rine and athlete. Alaska is full of in-
tense 
runs—marathons, 
ultra-mara-
thons—but one of the most challenging 
is in Seward, AK. It is called the an-
nual 
Mount 
Marathon 
Race, 
the 
Fourth of July, in Seward, a grueling 
1.5-mile climb almost straight up and 
straight back down Mount Marathon. 
He has run this 24 years in a row. That 
is tough—Solomon, her coach. 
Solomon really didn’t know much 
about 
swimming 
when 
he 
started 
coaching the small Seward swim team. 
In fact, Seward, AK, doesn’t even have 
an Olympic-size swimming pool, but 
they all worked hard. He encouraged 
them to be the best that they could 
be—to enjoy life but to also lift 
weights. Strength, Solomon said, is 
needed to excel in swimming, particu-
larly at the breaststroke. 
Lydia took to the weight rooms. She 
swims between 5 to 7 days a week, 1- 
hour to 90-minute sessions. She lifts 
weights about 3 hours a week. And as 
Solomon has said, ‘‘You want . . . ath-
letes to be more process than outcome 
driven.’’ 
Lydia fell in love with all the hard 
work. No one was ever going to give 
her a hard time if she missed a practice 
or a session, but every single oppor-
tunity she had to swim, she would be 
there. 
Well, on Sunday, Lydia will head to 
Hawaii to train with Team USA. Then, 
a few weeks later, she will head to 
Tokyo. 
Now, because of COVID restrictions, 
unfortunately, her parents won’t be 
there to watch in person. Her father 
said: ‘‘It’s a [bit of a] weird thing to 
send your kid across the world. But 
she’s an experienced traveler and there 
are great people involved with USA 
swimming.’’ 
‘‘We are over the moon proud of her,’’ 
her dad said. 
So are we. We are so proud of you, 
Lydia. You are a role model for so 
many aspiring swimmers, not just 
across Alaska but across the country. 
So thank you for representing Alaska 
and our Nation so well. 
Good luck in the Olympics. Con-
gratulations on your success and con-
gratulations on being our Alaskan of 
the Week.

DEFENSE BUDGET 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, as 
my colleague from Oklahoma Senator 
LANKFORD just gave a wonderful speech 
on the Fourth of July, we are all fo-
cused on heading home for the Fourth 
of July, celebrating freedom, cele-
brating our independence, celebrating 
liberty. 
And we all know that that freedom is 
not free. There is a saying at the Ko-
rean War Memorial, etched in stone, 
that says those very words: ‘‘Freedom 
is not free.’’ 
The sacrifices of our military are 
something that all of us are going to be 
thinking about over the course of the 
Fourth of July week, weekend, as we

celebrate and commemorate American 
liberty, American independence, and 
American freedom. 
Our military has helped us provide 
that, both here at home but also, im-
portantly, abroad. 
I had the opportunity to go on a con-
gressional delegation—Senate delega-
tion with two of my Senate colleagues, 
Senator 
COONS
and 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH, a couple weeks ago to 
Korea—South Korea and Taiwan. 
And it doesn’t matter where you are 
from in America, whether you are a 
Democrat or a Republican, when you 
go overseas and you go to countries 
like that, countries and places that lit-
erally exist because of the sacrifice of 
the American military, it makes you 
humble, and it makes you proud. 
South Korea and Taiwan—vibrant ec-
onomics, vibrant democracies. And if 
you know the history, those two places 
wouldn’t be that way if it weren’t for 
the sacrifice, literally, of tens of thou-
sands of Americans. 
It is no exaggeration to say—whether 
it is in those places or in places at 
home or in Europe or in Asia—that the 
United States has been one of the most 
powerful forces for liberating human-
kind from oppression and tyranny than 
any other force in the world. 
Think about it. Hundreds of millions 
of people across the world and in our 
own country, over the decades, have 
been liberated by men and women 
wearing the uniform of the United 
States. 
As we contemplate the Fourth of 
July week, weekend, that is something 
every American can take pride in and 
should take pride in. 
But as we all know, freedom is not 
free. Many of us think that defending 
our Nation should be our priority No. 1 
as part of our job in the U.S. Senate. 
Budgets are a reflection of an adminis-
tration’s values and priorities. 
And if you look at this budget—this 
is the $6 trillion blowout budget of the 
Biden administration, where up here 
you have every single Federal Agency 
with 
double-digit—20-percent 
in-
creases, 40-percent increases, 15-per-
cent increases across the board. 
The two Agencies charged with the 
national security of our Nation, the 
Department of Defense and Homeland 
Security, in terms of priorities for this 
administration, are dead last. 
Actually, if you adjust the budgets 
for inflation, these are cuts—almost 3 
percent cut in our military budgets and 
probably close to 4 to 5 percent for 
Homeland Security. 
Budgets reflect values of administra-
tions and priorities, and this adminis-
tration, right now, is prioritizing our 
military and our national defense dead 
last. 
We had the Secretary of Defense and 
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff in front of the Armed Services 
Committee last week, and I showed 
them this chart, and I asked them: 
How can you tell the troops that you 
lead 
that 
this 
administration 
prioritizes our military and national 
defense over other missions of the Fed-
eral Government? 
They couldn’t give a really good an-
swer because there is no good answer. 
If you look at this chart, if you look at 
the 
Biden 
administration’s 
budget, 
they are prioritized at the bottom. 
This is a battle of ideas, and when we 
come back from the Fourth of July re-
cess, we are going to have this battle. 
I know I have colleagues, Democrats 
and Republicans—I have spoken to 
many on both sides of the aisle—who 
fundamentally disagree with this—fun-
damentally disagree with this. 
You might remember last summer we 
had a debate when Senator SANDERS 
brought forth his defund the Pentagon 
amendment. That is what he called it. 
At the height of defunding the police, 
we had Senators saying we are going to 
now defund the Pentagon—15 percent 
across-the-board cuts to the military. 
That is what Senator SANDERS wanted. 
By the way, Senator SCHUMER was a 
cosponsor of that. 
And now they are in charge here, the 
majority leader, the chairman of the 
Budget Committee, and in many ways 
they are getting what they wanted—al-
most 3 percent cut to our military. 
I guarantee it is not what the Amer-
ican people want; it is not what my 
constituents want; and I don’t think it 
is what the vast majority of U.S. Sen-
ators want. 
So we are going to battle this. We are 
going to battle this, and I am going to 
ask my Senate colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to work with me to reject 
this. We need to reject this. We 
shouldn’t prioritize our military dead 
last, which is what the Biden adminis-
tration and, unfortunately, some of my 
colleagues here are doing. 
I would like to end by just noting 
that tomorrow is actually another an-
niversary. We were talking about the 
Fourth of July, but June 25 is the 71st 
anniversary of the outbreak of the Ko-
rean war, which was June 25, 1950. 
Unfortunately, not enough Ameri-
cans, in my view, have a lot of knowl-
edge of the Korean war. It is even 
called the forgotten war. I don’t think 
it should be called the forgotten war. It 
should be called the noble war because 
Americans went to a place they didn’t 
even know to defend freedom, which 
they did after a hard, difficult, violent 
struggle. 
But in the summer of 1950, we lost 
thousands and thousands of young 
Americans, young American soldiers, 
young American servicemen. Why? 
Because they were not prepared to 
fight. We went from 1945, having prob-
ably the most formidable military in 
the history of the world, to 5 years 
later—because of defense cuts, because 
of lack of leadership by civilian and 
military leaders in the United States— 
a military that could not fight, a mili-
tary where we lost thousands of young 
American soldiers because they weren’t 
ready because budgets had been gutted. 
We can never allow that to happen 
again, and as we head into the Fourth 
of July weekend to celebrate the 
Fourth of July and our hard-fought 
freedoms and liberty, we need to look 
at this budget, come back here and say 
to the President and others: We are 
not—we are not going to prioritize the 
national security of our Nation last. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. KING. Madam President, I rise to 
talk about a moral obligation and a na-
tional security obligation. 
We are leaving Afghanistan after 20 
years, the longest war in the country’s 
history. During the entirety of that 20 
years, there were brave people in Af-
ghanistan—Afghanistan 
people—who 
helped us, who were translators, who 
were guides, who assisted us in the 
struggle against terrorism and in the 
struggle against the Taliban. 
And as we leave, those people are in 
grave danger. The Taliban has made no 
secret of the fact that they are in grave 
danger. They have already started kill-
ing them. 
If we leave without providing for the 
safety of those people, providing them 
a way to maintain their lives, it will be 
a stain on this country that will exist 
for generations. 
Not only is it a moral and ethical ob-
ligation, though, it is a national secu-
rity obligation because if we don’t take 
care of the people who took care of us, 
who is going to come to our aid the 
next time? Who is going to come to the 
aid of the Americans who turn their 
backs on those that risk their lives on 
behalf of this country? The answer is 
no one. 
So this is not only an ethical and 
moral obligation, this is a matter of 
national security in terms of our 
standing in the world and our ability 
to work with allies and others against 
adversaries of this country and other 
countries in the world. 
The average time, I am told, it now 
takes to process the paperwork for one 
of the people whom we are trying to 
get out of Afghanistan through the spe-
cial visa program is 600 days. We are 
going to have a military presence in 
Afghanistan less than 90 days. There is 
a mismatch there. 
We have got to take steps to protect 
these people. Now, maybe its surging— 
we have talked about military surges; 
let’s surge some paperwork people to 
get this work done faster. But I don’t 
believe we are going to be able to do 
that. 
Now, by the way, I am not saying we 
open the door to everyone—there are 
18,000 people on their list; that is not to 
mention their families—that we just 
open the door and say everybody come 
here because, as we know, Afghanistan 
has been the home to very dangerous 
terrorist groups, al-Qaida, ISIS, and 
others. 
So we do have to have some proc-
essing, but we have to be able to proc-
ess these people in a way that protects

us in terms of our national security 
but also gets them out of harm’s way. 
One possibility—and I am delighted 
that just a few hours ago, the President 
mentioned that he is going to be work-
ing with other countries to find a safe 
place to move these people while we 
are doing the processing. I think that 
is exactly what we have to do. We can’t 
just hope that when we leave in August 
or September 11, as the deadline the 
President has established, that we just 
hope that the Taliban won’t take over 
Kabul, that the Taliban won’t take 
over other regions of the country and 
start murdering people who helped us. 
This isn’t a speculative problem. This 
isn’t something we think may happen. 
They have told us it is going to happen. 
And I have learned all my life, believe 
people when they tell you what they 
are going to do, and this is one of those 
situations. We know what is coming. If 
what ends up coming is a bloodbath, 
that blood is on our hands. 
I have talked about the national se-
curity, but I think, more important, 
this is a moral and ethical obligation 
to meet the safety needs of those peo-
ple who have helped us. I have friends 
who have fought in Afghanistan, and 
they are agonized about this. They are 
agonized about what is going to happen 
to people that they know, that they 
have worked with, and that have put 
their lives on the line for America. 
What is going to happen to those peo-
ple when we leave? 
This is a moment of test for this 
country. This is a trial for us, and his-
tory is going to judge us as to how we 
meet this test. This isn’t something— 
we are not talking about landing a man 
on the Moon or some kind of terrible 
technological challenge; this is just 
putting resources in the right place 
and making the arrangements to take 
care of these people. It can be done. It 
can be done. And if it isn’t done, shame 
on us. 
I know that is a phrase that is often 
used, but it fits in this case. If we don’t 
protect those who protected us, shame 
on us. 
On December 1, 1862, Abraham Lin-
coln came to this Capitol to talk about 
the course of the Civil War and what 
was happening. And he was trying to 
move the Congress out of the politics 
as usual as they dealt with this ex-
traordinary crisis. His final words echo 
over the last 100-plus years, and I think 
they apply exactly today. Here is what 
Abraham Lincoln said: 
Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. 
We of this Congress and this administration, 
will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No 
personal significance, or insignificance, can 
spare one or the other of us. The fiery trial 
which we [now] pass, will light us down, in 
honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. 
This is a test of the moral integrity 
of this country. We must—we must— 
defend those who have defended us 
from a peril that we know is imminent. 
This fiery trial through which we 
pass this summer, will light us down— 
we in the Congress and the administra-
tion, as Lincoln said, ‘‘will light us 
down, in honor or dishonor, to the lat-
est generation. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from Rhode Is-
land. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me 
commend the stirring and thought-pro-
voking words of my colleague from 
Maine, Senator KING, about our respon-
sibility with respect to those who aided 
and assisted us in Afghanistan and the 
status of this Special Immigrant Visa 
Program. 
I think we have to begin with the de-
cision to leave, which puts these indi-
viduals at risk. In many respects, 
President Biden’s hands were tied from 
the outset with regard to our policy in 
Afghanistan. He inherited a flawed 
agreement from the Trump administra-
tion, which required the United States 
to withdraw all military forces by May 
1 in exchange for the Taliban’s agree-
ment not to attack the U.S. and coali-
tion forces and to constrain al-Qaida 
from using Afghanistan as a safe 
haven. 
It does not appear that the Taliban 
has observed many of the conditions of 
this agreement, but we have observed 
the condition of leaving promptly. The 
President originally set a date of Sep-
tember 11, but military personnel have 
been able to rapidly redeploy, and 
within weeks, we should be moving all 
of our military personnel. 
The manner in which this agreement 
was reached was also deeply flawed. It 
was negotiated exclusively between the 
Trump administration and the Taliban, 
keeping our allies, even the Afghan 
Government, out. President Trump’s 
go-it-alone, 
rush-to-the-exits 
men-
tality led to a deal where the Taliban 
emerged as the key benefactor while 
the United States and our allies won 
very little. And while the Taliban has 
held the condition of not attacking the 
United States or its allies, as I indi-
cated before, the remaining conditions 
were virtually unenforceable. By any 
measure, the Taliban has clearly vio-
lated the spirit of the agreement as 
overall violence inside Afghanistan has 
steadily increased over the last year. 
The Taliban has also not made clear 
that it will constrain al-Qaida as re-
quired by the agreement. 
During this transition period, the 
Taliban has gained enormous momen-
tum on the battlefield. As the Wash-
ington Post recently reported, Taliban 
commanders, motivated by their bat-
tlefield gains, have ‘‘overrun a number 
of Afghan bases, even as U.S. air sup-
port for the Afghan army has dwindled, 
and set up numerous checkpoints along 
the main highways leading in and out 
of Kabul.’’ 
At least 24 Afghan commandos and 
police officers were killed in an am-
bush by the Taliban in northern Af-
ghanistan just last week. 
It appears that the Taliban’s tactics 
will only continue to intensify as the 
transition of U.S. and coalition per-
sonnel continues, especially as our air-
strikes decline. According to the New 
York Times, there have been multiple 
instances where the Taliban, taking 
advantage of the situation, has been 
able to negotiate the surrenders of Af-
ghan forces. By their count, since May 
1, at least 26 outposts and bases have 
surrendered after such negotiations. 
Violence has increased against the ci-
vilian population as well, including a 
horrific attack against a school outside 
of Kabul, chillingly timed to target 
teenage girls leaving class. 
The Taliban’s steady gains are con-
trasted with peace talks in Doha that 
appear to be going at a glacial pace. 
With these dynamics, the Taliban has 
no strategic interest to sit down and 
discuss power sharing. The government 
of Afghanistan appears to hold a much 
weaker hand in these negotiations, 
having proven unable to govern in a 
way that earns the confidence of the 
people. 
These concerning political and secu-
rity developments are playing out 
against the backdrop of regional play-
ers that should have high incentives to 
cooperate to ensure stability and secu-
rity of Afghanistan. However, nations 
like Iran, Russia, and China may in 
fact be working at cross-purposes to 
the U.S. interests, and others, such as 
Pakistan, could be using their influ-
ence in a much more constructive man-
ner than they are today. 
Taken together, these dynamics cre-
ate a highly challenging landscape. If 
not addressed deliberately, they could 
cause a cascade of instability both in-
side Afghanistan and across the region. 
To mitigate such an outcome, we must 
exercise caution and plan prudently. 
And again, echoing the comments of 
Senator KING, this brings me to one of 
the most immediate and pressing con-
sequences of the situation. How do we 
help those whose lives were put on the 
line because they assisted the United 
States? 
There are many press reports of the 
Taliban threatening Afghan civilians 
who helped us. USA Today profiled one 
Afghan interpreter who explained: ‘‘If 
the U.S. forces leave Afghanistan . . . I 
cannot 
guarantee 
for 
one 
minute 
what’s going to happen with me, with 
my family.’’ 
These threats cannot be ignored. We 
must demonstrate that we have the ca-
pacity to protect those who have a tar-
get on their backs because of their as-
sociation with the United States. More 
than that, we must ensure that we con-
tinue to secure the irreplaceable assist-
ance of the people who willingly risk 
their lives to help the United States 
the next time our servicemembers are 
in a conflict in a distant land. If we set 
the example of leaving those who as-
sisted us behind, who will assist us in 
the future? 
Currently, the processing of Afghan 
candidates through Special Immigra-
tion Visas or SIVs, which the State De-
partment says is the primary focus, 
may prove too little, too late. While

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

June 24, 2021 
the backlog of candidates is 18,000 
today, it is unclear how many poten-
tial SIV candidates will feel compelled 
to apply as conditions change on the 
ground. Processing applications has 
been further complicated by a long vet-
ting process, declining security condi-
tions, and a recent spike in COVID 
cases across Afghanistan, which has 
forced the Embassy to shut down visa 
interviews. In order to handle the de-
mand, we must add at least 20,000 addi-
tional visas for the next fiscal year and 
do so immediately and find other ways 
to further streamline the process, as 
Senator KING described. 
We may also come to find that the 
SIV category does not encompass all 
those Afghans who would likely be tar-
geted by the Taliban. We should be 
identifying others who may be at risk 
and start planning to ensure the safety 
of those who would seek asylum as a 
consequence of a potential Taliban 
takeover or if control of the country 
fractures. 
Now is the time to think about cre-
ative solutions and, importantly, un-
derstand what will be necessary to en-
sure that we live up to our moral obli-
gations. I know full well that the 
United States is capable of this. We 
have been publicly assured by the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General 
Milley, and Commander of Central 
Command, General McKenzie, that the 
military can carry out such an evacu-
ation, if directed to do so. We have suc-
cessfully conducted evacuations of ref-
ugee populations in the past, including 
a significant number of Vietnamese 
refugees in 1975, Iraqi Kurds in 1996, 
and Kosovo Albanians in 1999. It is im-
perative that we deliver upon our 
promises now. 
Providing safe harbor for these Af-
ghans who are most vulnerable is front 
of mind, but we must also ensure that 
there is a farsighted planning process 
across the board to ensure success fol-
lowing the transition of our military 
forces. And I would like to quickly 
highlight several key questions. 
First, can the United States and its 
allies and partners continue to con-
strain the threat from terrorist groups 
like al-Qaida and ISIS that would seek 
to use Afghanistan as a base for oper-
ations? 
The Biden administration has dis-
cussed its intent to conduct over-the- 
horizon operations, but we need to en-
sure that we have accounted for this 
complexity and are postured for suc-
cess. 
Second, how will the United States 
continue to distribute and oversee aid 
to the Afghan Government and Afghan 
security forces? The Afghan Govern-
ment 
remains 
unable 
to 
generate 
enough revenue to independently fund 
its military operations, instead relying 
almost solely on foreign contributions. 
We must have robust mechanisms in 
place to ensure the aid is provided and 
goes to the intended places. 
Third, how can the international 
community assist the Afghan security 
forces with maintaining readiness, par-
ticularly air power—after all inter-
national contractors depart the coun-
try? Again, that is another term of the 
Doha agreement. After 20 years, we 
have not created a cadre of individuals 
inside Afghanistan who can independ-
ently conduct high-level maintenance 
on its aircraft, which raises serious 
questions about how the Afghans can 
continue air operations without inter-
national contracting support. 
Fourth, does the international com-
munity have real leverage to affect 
Taliban behavior through political and 
diplomatic channels? Now is the time 
to understand what levers are available 
to mitigate a potentially disastrous 
situation for the people of Afghanistan, 
and particularly that of women and 
girls. 
Fifth, will NGOs be able to continue 
activities to benefit the people of Af-
ghanistan? There appears to be a lack 
of coordination, including by the De-
partment 
of 
Defense, 
to 
ensure 
deconfliction 
methods 
are 
appro-
priately transitioned to the Afghan 
Government, 
which 
puts 
humani-
tarians at risk and could delay the de-
livery of lifesaving assistance to popu-
lations living in hard-to-reach areas. 
The time to address these challenges 
is now. I urge the Biden administration 
to continue to work through these 
pressing issues, and I call upon Con-
gress to assist where we can. The con-
sequences of inaction are too great to 
risk. We must rapidly increase the 
number of SIV visas, and we must, 
along with the administration, plan for 
all the contingencies that I have out-
lined. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise for the 15th time, today, to call for 
every Senator to have the opportunity 
to consider and cast their vote for the 
Military Justice Improvement and In-
creasing Prevention Act. This bill 
would move serious crimes like sexual 
assault out of the chain of command 
and put them in the hands of the most 
capable people in the military: inde-
pendent, 
impartial, 
highly 
trained 
prosecutors. 
I began calling for the full floor vote 
on May 25. That was about a month 
ago. In that month, an estimated 1,736 
servicemembers will have been raped 
or sexually assaulted. More will have 
been victims of other serious crimes. 
Many will not even report those crimes 
because they lack faith in the system 
where cases are decided by their com-
manders, not by trained lawyers. And 
yet this vote continues to be delayed 
and denied day after day, week after 
week. 
I have heard proponents of this bill 
argue that we can’t make this change 
because the military lacks the lawyers 
necessary to carry out the work. 
Today, I would like to address this one 
unfounded claim. 
Let’s look at the numbers. The Navy, 
for example, has an Active Duty popu-
lation of just over 330,000 members. 
Their military justice system has 935 
military lawyers, or judge advocates 
known as JAGs. That number includes 
more than 100 special litigators and 85 
at the 06-level JAG, which means the 
colonel or above commanders. And last 
year, they completed just 78 general 
courts martial, which are usually cases 
involved in serious felonies that our 
bill discusses. 
Now, let’s look at the civilian coun-
terpart. Take the San Diego County 
District Attorney’s Office. San Diego 
County has a population of 3.3 million 
people. To serve that population, the 
DA’s office has just 300 prosecutors who 
handle 40,000 cases a year. 
So the Navy has one-tenth of the 
population but three times the law-
yers. In total, our armed services have 
just over 1.3 million members and more 
than 4,000 JAGs. The issue with our 
military justice system is not that it 
lacks the lawyers. It is that it does not 
entrust the most serious crimes to the 
people who are most professional and 
trained to address them. 
In fiscal year 2020, the armed services 
completed 720 general courts martial, 
and in fiscal year 2019, they completed 
895 general courts martial. If 300 pros-
ecutors in San Diego County can han-
dle 40,000 cases a year, I trust that 
more than 4,000 JAGs in our military, 
some of our Nation’s best and bright-
est, can handle 895 general courts mar-
tial. 
I have trust in those military law-
yers’ ability to handle these cases be-
cause they are in fact already working 
on them. This reform would not give 
them more work. Instead, it would re-
lieve them of the time-consuming work 
it takes to get a commander properly 
briefed on cases and allow them to 
make decisions on those cases instead 
of just making recommendations to 
commanders. 
In short, making this reform would 
not require finding a host of new law-
yers to do this work or to overtax the 
lawyers our military already has. Any 
claims otherwise are nothing more 
than a delay tactic. 
The Military Justice Improvement 
and Increasing Prevention Act will de-
liver results our servicemembers and 
their families deserve. It is supported 
by the experts, by servicemembers, and 
by a bipartisan, filibuster-proof major-
ity of Senators, and it is time we bring 
this to the floor. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that at a time to be determined by 
the majority leader, in consultation 
with the Republican leader, the Senate 
Armed Services Committee be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 1520 and the Senate proceed to its 
consideration; that there be 2 hours for 
debate equally divided in the usual 
form; and that upon the use or yielding

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4758 
June 24, 2021 
back of the time, the Senate votes on 
the bill with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Rhode Island is 
recognized. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, once again, 
I object to the Senator’s request for 
reasons I have previously stated. But 
in addition, on Tuesday night, Sec-
retary of Defense Austin released a 
statement stating that he had received 
the Independent Review Commission’s 
recommendations and that the admin-
istration will work with Congress to 
remove the prosecution of sexual as-
sault and related crimes from the mili-
tary 
chain 
of 
command, 
a 
rec-
ommendation I agree with. I made that 
clear for weeks now. 
And this statement makes it clear 
that the argument before us is not 
about 
removing 
sexual 
assault 
or 
crimes connected to sexual misconduct 
from the chain of command. The argu-
ment is about removing felonies like 
barracks larceny, destruction of gov-
ernment 
property 
of 
a 
significant 
value, and crimes that have been han-
dled by the military chain of command 
effectively for years and years and 
years. 
In addition, Secretary Austin nota-
bly praised the comprehensive nature 
of the IRC’s assessment across all four 
lines of effort, not just military justice 
reforms, but, as importantly, preven-
tion, climate and culture, and victim 
care. 
The necessity to approach this issue 
in a holistic and comprehensive man-
ner is vitally important if we want to 
actually reduce the incidence of sexual 
assault in the ranks. We would be naive 
to believe we can simply prosecute our-
selves out of this problem. That isn’t 
how this will work. 
Accountability is important, but it 
must be part of a larger reform, and I 
hope we can all agree that it is far pref-
erable to prevent a sexual assault than 
simply to prosecute one. 
Finally, I want to highlight Sec-
retary Austin’s statement that the De-
partment will need new resources and 
authorities to implement these rec-
ommendations. It must work with Con-
gress to secure additional authorities 
and relief where needed, as well as ad-
ditional personnel, funding, and suffi-
cient time to implement them. 
And so, as I have said a number of 
times already, I intend to include the 
administration’s 
recommendations 
that derive from the President’s Inde-
pendent Review Commission in the 
markup of the defense bill, subject to 
amendment. 
Colleagues who have dedicated them-
selves for many years to issues of na-
tional defense and are knowledgeable 
of the UCMJ will have an opportunity 
to make amendments, to make sugges-
tions, to debate this bill in detail, and 
then the result will be reported to the 
floor of the Senate, and all Senators 
will have such an opportunity. That is 
what we have done traditionally, par-
ticularly when it comes to significant 
changes in the Uniform Code of Mili-
tary Justice. 
And with that, I would reiterate my 
objection to the Senator from New 
York’s request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
also commend General Austin on his 
recommendations. He is the first Sec-
retary of Defense in the last 10 years— 
in the last real 100 years—that has said 
that sexual assault and related crimes 
should be taken out of the chain of 
command, of which I agree completely. 
He has also acknowledged that it is not 
necessary for good order and discipline 
or command control that the con-
vening authority be the commander. 
The convening authority can be the 
prosecutor, which is our bill. 
The reason why we advocate for a 
bright line is that while sexual assaults 
are handled poorly within the military, 
so are other crimes when it comes to 
racial disparity. We have evidence that 
has been detailed and reported by the 
Department of Defense that if you are 
a Black servicemember, you are up to 
2.61 times more likely to be prosecuted 
or punished for crimes due to racial 
bias within the military justice sys-
tem. 
So if we want a military justice sys-
tem that is fair for everyone, both 
plaintiffs and defendants, we need a 
bright line around all serious crimes. I 
believe that if you allow trained mili-
tary prosecutors the ability to review 
the case files for all serious crimes, 
more cases of sexual assaults will go 
forward and end in conviction, and 
then the bias that is seen in other 
cases will also be reduced. 
So for the chairman to say that there 
is no evidence that the command 
hasn’t been doing a good job in other 
crimes, I would say that is not true. 
There is a great deal of evidence that 
there is racial bias in how our military 
justice system is used at the detriment 
to Black and Brown servicemembers. 
Second, I would like to say that the 
commission’s recommendations are ex-
pansive and excellent, and we look for-
ward to receiving those recommenda-
tions. Those recommendations may 
well require additional personnel and 
additional resources because they are 
across many lines, not just about pros-
ecution. 
My bill, the Military Justice Im-
provement and Prevention Act, does 
not require more resources or more 
personnel because it is literally cre-
ating a bright line of felonies, and 
while those prosecutors are normally 
prosecuting 
those 
cases, 
the 
only 
change is they get to see the case file 
first. They get to make a judgment 
about whether there is enough evi-
dence, and if there is not, it goes right 
back to the commander where it was. 
So I agree that General Austin’s 
statements are important and mean-
ingful. I agree that the commission’s 
work is excellent, and I look forward to 
supporting them and turning them into 
law. But I disagree strongly that the 
broader reform of a bright line around 
felonies isn’t needed because it is, and 
it shows in the prosecution of sexual 
assaults, and it shows in the racial dis-
parity of convictions and prosecutions 
and nonjudicial punishment for Black 
servicemembers. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized.

PUBLIC SAFETY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, 
President 
Biden 
announced 
that his administration would attempt 
to combat the alarming rise of violent 
crime unfolding in cities across our 
country by making it harder for law- 
abiding Americans to exercise their 
constitutional right to keep and bear 
arms. And today our colleagues on the 
Judiciary Committee voted on the 
nomination of a person the President 
intends 
to 
lead 
the 
effort. 
David 
Chipman was tapped to be Director of 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-
arms and Explosives. 
If he is confirmed, this nominee 
would bring to the job a dangerous and 
unprecedented hostility to the Second 
Amendment. We know it from his 
record as an anti-gun extremist, and 
we know it from the reputation he 
earned among ATF veterans as an ‘‘ac-
tivist’’ and ‘‘a rabid partisan.’’ 
It should go without saying that 
these are exactly the wrong motiva-
tions to encourage at the helm of the 
Agency charged with firearms enforce-
ment. Then again, it should also go 
without saying that responsible gun 
owners don’t cause surges in violent 
crime; they actually prevent them. 
Unfortunately, 
Democrats’ 
latest 
bout of cognitive dissonance on crime 
didn’t begin just this week. Let’s con-
sider what has unfolded over the past 
year. Last summer, across America, 
peaceful protests were overtaken by 
lawless rioters. For nights on end, vio-
lence and looting left cities in flames, 
and in too many State capitals and 
city halls, local officials froze under 
pressure from the left and failed to pro-
tect their citizens, their homes, and 
their businesses. 
In fact, at every level of government, 
elected Democrats instead rapidly em-
braced radical calls to ‘‘defund the po-
lice.’’ To the tune of hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars, they succeeded in gut-
ting local law enforcement budgets and

validating the worst instincts of the 
anti-police agitators. 
The president of the Minneapolis 
City Council called on her colleagues 
to ‘‘imagine a future without police.’’ 
And sure enough, in Los Angeles, po-
lice were told to make do after a cut of 
$150 million. In Seattle, the police de-
partment budget shrank by nearly 20 
percent. Defunding efforts here in 
Washington were passed by committee 
unanimously. 
The Biden administration has ampli-
fied these efforts by appointing avowed 
supporters of defunding the police, like 
Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke, to 
high-ranking positions at the Justice 
Department, the Agency charged with 
enforcing Federal criminal law. 
Now, we didn’t have to imagine the 
consequences of betraying the brave of-
ficers charged with keeping the peace. 
Millions of Americans have been living 
this dangerous new reality literally for 
months. Last year closed with the Na-
tion’s sharpest 1-year increase in homi-
cides in decades. In New York City, the 
murder rate jumped nearly 45 percent, 
and in my hometown of Louisville, it is 
already on pace this year to exceed last 
year’s all-time record. 
New fears arose in communities 
across the country, and as Democrats 
flirted with their imagined future with-
out police, Americans did exactly what 
you would expect of a free people: They 
looked to their own defense and exer-
cised their Second Amendment rights 
in record numbers. The FBI processed 
nearly 40 million background checks on 
gun purchasers last year, shattering 
previous records. And, nationwide, 40 
percent of the guns sold last year were 
purchased by—listen to this—first-time 
buyers. In particular, members of ra-
cial minority groups joined the ranks 
of gun owners in record numbers. 
So let’s review. In city after city, 
powerful Democrats vocally refused to 
uphold their responsibilities to protect 
public safety. Violent crime filled the 
void. Against this backdrop, the Amer-
ican people chose to defend themselves 
by exercising a core constitutional 
right. 
But now, as Democrats at the State 
and local level play politics with public 
safety, Democrats here in Washington 
want to make gun ownership in Amer-
ica more burdensome than ever. Promi-
nent voices on the left, including some 
of our colleagues, fanned the flames of 
a dangerously misguided experiment, 
and law-abiding Americans are paying 
the price. 
Here in the Senate, Republicans have 
been focused all along on making 
American communities actually safer. 
It is why we supported TIM SCOTT’s ef-
forts to pass police reform that empow-
ered law enforcement to do their jobs 
very well rather than federalizing and 
defunding the police. 
It is the reason that Chairman 
LINDSEY GRAHAM and 46 other Repub-
lican Senators joined me today to de-
mand publicly that the Department of 
Justice cease its efforts to restrict the 
use of common pistol-brace devices by 
lawful gun owners. We are talking 
about a plan that would turn millions 
of law-abiding Americans into crimi-
nals with a stroke of the pen. It would 
be an outrageous violation, and we ex-
pect DOJ to withdraw this attempted 
confiscation. Federal law enforcement 
should focus on the criminals commit-
ting violent crimes in American cities, 
not on law-abiding gun owners. 
So Republicans will continue to 
stand for Americans’ Second Amend-
ment rights, as a matter of public safe-
ty and of basic freedoms. 
f 
DEMOCRATIC AGENDA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
another matter, as the Senate headed 
into the June work period, the Demo-
cratic leader laid out an agenda that 
was transparently designed to fail, a 
string of far-left proposals that were 
not intended to become law or to make 
a difference in the lives of the Amer-
ican people. They were designed to fail 
and provide political theater for liberal 
activists. 
And sure enough, the Senate did re-
ject Democrats’ brazen attempt to re-
write the rules of American elections, 
permanently, to their own advantage. 
We did reject their bid to exploit the 
cause of paycheck fairness to fill the 
pockets of the trial bar. And other rad-
ical proposals, like the one to impose 
crushing legal penalties on organiza-
tions that failed to conform to leftwing 
social preferences, didn’t make it to 
the floor. 
But, let’s remember, this was never 
just about policy. If our colleagues ac-
tually believed that the substance of 
their plans were viable, they would 
have submitted more to scrutiny in 
committee. We know how things work 
in this body when a narrow majority 
actually wants to make a law. That is 
not what we have actually seen. 
So Senate Democrats weren’t out to 
pass any legislation this month. Their 
designed-to-fail agenda was supposed 
to indicate that the institution of the 
Senate itself was somehow broken. And 
on this count, our friends across the 
aisle failed spectacularly. 
See, the Framers designed the upper 
Chamber, our Chamber, to be a proving 
ground, a place where good ideas would 
rise to meet high standards and bad 
ones would actually fall flat. So this 
month our Senate colleagues proved 
that the Senate is working quite well. 
We turned away an underhanded at-
tempt to open American employers to 
a new form of unlimited predatory li-
ability and a hostile takeover of our 
election system. And the whole time, 
productive work continued on bipar-
tisan proposals that are actually—ac-
tually—intended to become law. From 
infrastructure to agriculture, many of 
our colleagues have been hard at work 
demonstrating the right way to go 
about legislating. In the Commerce and 
EPW Committees, they approved smart 
legislation with wide bipartisan votes. 
This morning on the floor, we consid-
ered another bill from Senator BRAUN 
that more than half of our colleagues 
actually cosponsored. 
So as we head back to our home 
States and take time to celebrate our 
Nation’s founding, let’s double down on 
efforts like these and leave designed- 
to-fail partisan antics in June. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on one final matter, earlier today, a bi-
partisan group of infrastructure nego-
tiators took the results of their efforts 
down to President Biden. It was an en-
couraging sign of progress after leading 
Democrats had gone out of their way 
to slow the process. 
Remember, at the first sign of an 
agreement last night and then again 
this morning, both the Democratic 
leader and the Speaker of the House 
made it clear they would hold a bipar-
tisan agreement hostage, demanding 
trillions of dollars in wasteful spending 
and job-killing tax increases in return 
for even considering it. The top two 
Democrats literally pulled the rug out 
from under their bipartisan negotiators 
with these unserious demands before 
they had even made it down to the 
White House. 
So President Biden’s show of support 
earlier today appeared to be a major 
breakthrough for earning Democrats’ 
support, but, alas, that optimism was 
short-lived. Less than 2 hours after 
publicly commending our colleagues 
and actually endorsing the bipartisan 
agreement, the President took the ex-
traordinary step of threatening to veto 
it. It was a tale of two press con-
ferences—endorse the agreement in one 
breath and threaten to veto it in the 
next. Less than 2 hours. It almost 
makes your head spin. Less than 2 
hours. As I said, it almost makes your 
head spin—an expression of bipartisan-
ship and then an ultimatum on behalf 
of your leftwing base. 
I have no doubt the President is 
under enormous pressure from some on 
the left to deliver on a laundry list of 
radical climate demands. The Demo-
cratic leader and the Speaker have al-
ready made clear they will do whatever 
it takes to keep their runaway spend-
ing train chugging along all summer, 
and more and more Members of their 
party are having to contort their posi-
tions to keep pace with the expecta-
tions of the Green New Deal fringe. 
But, really, caving completely in less 
than 2 hours? That is not the way to 
show you are serious about getting a 
bipartisan outcome. 
So, look, I hope our colleagues can 
recover and get their good-faith efforts 
back on track. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip is recognized.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4760 
June 24, 2021 
season of renewal in our Nation. But as 
we begin to emerge from this public 
health crisis of COVID–19, we find our-
selves facing another crisis: an epi-
demic of gun violence in America. 
The gun violence we are seeing in 
America today is devastating, and it is 
the direct result of generations of 
underinvestment, policy failure, and 
cycles of trauma. 
Yesterday, President Biden spoke to 
the Nation about this challenge and 
laid out a clear strategy to keep our 
communities safe from the scourge of 
gun violence. The President has called 
for important reforms to crack down 
on gun trafficking and gun dealers who 
willfully violate the law. I agree with 
this strategy, and I will do everything 
in my power as chair of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee to support it. 
Already, 
the 
administration 
has 
worked to rein in the proliferation of 
untraceable ghost guns. What are these 
guns? They are guns that can be or-
dered on the internet. They can be 
made in component parts with no se-
rial numbers and are impossible to 
trace. The administration has also 
worked to issue regular reports on fire-
arms trafficking patterns and trends 
and to promote model legislation to 
keep guns out of the wrong hands. 
These are all important steps, and so 
is the President’s call for a major com-
mitment of Federal resources to sup-
port community violence intervention 
programs, programs like READI Chi-
cago, which supports members of the 
community who are most at risk for 
gun violence with job training and 
other support. These programs help 
save lives in our city of Chicago, and 
they desperately need Federal support. 
President Biden made it clear yester-
day that he is committed to this. 
Every Monday, as sad as it is, the 
people of Chicago awaken to read the 
heartbreaking headlines about the toll 
gun violence has taken over the week-
end. What was last weekend like in the 
city of Chicago? Fifty-two people were 
shot, five fatally. 
Young children and babies don’t es-
cape this violence. More than 50 chil-
dren under the age of 15 have been shot 
in Chicago this year: Kayden Swann, 1- 
year-old, shot in the head while riding 
in a car on Lake Shore Drive; 7-year- 
old Jaslyn Adams was shot and killed 
at a McDonald’s drive-through on the 
West Side in April; 14-year-old Savanna 
Quintero, who was shot and killed ear-
lier this month by gang members in 
the Back of the Yards neighborhood. 
These children are just a few of the 
more than 1,500 people who have been 
shot in Chicago this year. 
Our city isn’t alone in facing gun vio-
lence. We are seeing it across the Na-
tion. And don’t believe it is just a prob-
lem in blue States; red States face it 
too. 
While a shooting can happen any-
where, the fact is gun violence has dis-
proportionately claimed the lives of 
Black and Brown Americans living in 
communities where it is often easier to 
find a gun than a good-paying job. 
I have visited schools across Chicago, 
and I have asked the students if they 
know someone who has been shot. In 
some 
neighborhoods, 
nearly 
every 
child’s hand goes up. In fact, 90 percent 
of Chicago’s homicides occur in neigh-
borhoods where 60 percent of the city’s 
youngest kids live and learn. And when 
their parents or siblings are shot, it 
causes damage that, unlike a bullet 
wound, cannot heal with time alone. 
Science shows us that trauma rewires 
children’s brains and produces changes 
that can last a lifetime. 
I often ask audiences: Think about 
your youth. Think about one event in 
your life that you still remember to 
this day. I hope it was a happy one. I 
hope it wasn’t a sad one. But think 
about the fact that no matter how old 
you are, something that happened 
when you were a tiny kid is still very 
fresh in your memory. 
Now think about a child who has wit-
nessed a shooting or been the victim of 
a shooting. That is going to be with 
them for a lifetime unless we do some-
thing. Childhood trauma can make it 
harder for kids to learn and to form 
healthy relationships, and it can do se-
rious harm to a child physically, men-
tally, and emotionally—harm that can 
change their lives. 
But with the right care and support, 
kids and victims of gun violence can 
deal with trauma and rise above it. 
Across Illinois, I have seen programs in 
schools, hospitals, community centers, 
and churches that provide the nur-
turing environments and treatments 
our children who experience trauma 
need to thrive. 
If we want to end the epidemic of gun 
violence, we need to invest in commu-
nity-based solutions that end the cy-
cles of trauma. Last week I joined Sen-
ators CAPITO, DUCKWORTH, and MUR-
KOWSKI in introducing a bipartisan bill 
that will invest in those solutions: the 
RISE from Trauma Act. This bill would 
invest billions of dollars over the next 
8 years in community-based efforts to 
support children and families who have 
endured trauma. 
This aligns directly with what Presi-
dent Biden said yesterday and what he 
requested in his American Jobs Plan. It 
would help end violence where it be-
gins—in environments where kids are 
neglected, abused, and left to fend for 
themselves. 
This legislation would fund coun-
seling for gunshot victims and expand 
our trauma-informed workforce—doc-
tors, teachers, social service profes-
sionals, community leaders—to help 
kids who have experienced trauma. 
I believe the RISE from Trauma Act 
will help offer a long-term solution to 
the epidemic of gun violence, but we 
also need to protect our families and 
neighborhoods in the short term. 
In addition to immediate steps it has 
taken, the administration is asking us 
to address violent crime. I have been 
working with leaders in my State to 
make additional resources available. 
Earlier this week, Senator DUCKWORTH 
and I sent a letter to Governor 
Pritzker highlighting effective strate-
gies for how to use more than $120 mil-
lion in American Rescue Plan funds to 
help support targeted violence inter-
vention efforts. These funds, which will 
help 
protect 
Illinois 
from 
violent 
crimes, are available now to help the 
police, to help the victims, to help the 
neighborhoods. 
When we talk about really caring and 
really wanting to do something to 
make a difference, I am sorry that I 
have to remind the Senate that this 
bill, the American Rescue Plan, passed 
the U.S. Senate without a single Re-
publican supporting it, not one—not 
one Republican vote. 
To most effectively address the spike 
in gun violence, the Senate must also 
confirm the Director for the Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explo-
sives. 
I couldn’t help but listen to the Re-
publican leader who came to the floor 
to talk about David Chipman. He is a 
man who will be reported out of the Ju-
diciary Committee and brought to the 
floor. He was considered today, in the 
Judiciary 
Committee—11 
Democrats 
and 11 Republicans split along party 
lines on his vote. It was expected. But 
Senator SCHUMER can still bring his 
nomination to the floor. 
It is no surprise that the Republicans 
opposed him, but let’s put it in context 
for a moment. How many times have 
you heard a gun debate and you heard 
someone say, ‘‘We don’t need any new 
laws, we just need to enforce the laws 
we have. Don’t dream up some new law 
that’s going to burden someone who is 
an innocent, law-abiding gun owner, 
enforce the laws we have.’’ 
So what Agency do we look to for 
that enforcement? Well, certainly, the 
Department of Justice. And where do 
they turn? They turn to ATF. That is 
the Agency that is supposed to keep an 
eye on how guns are being sold and 
whether the wrong people are buying 
them. 
Well, let’s look at the leader of the 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explo-
sives Agency under President Trump. I 
would like to give you his name or her 
name, but I can’t because there was no 
leader. In 4 years, President Trump and 
Senate Republicans never put in place 
any single person to head this Agency. 
Was it an oversight, an accident? Far 
from it. Those who are on the side of 
increased gun rights at the expense of 
safety don’t want anyone to lead this 
Agency. They want this Agency to go 
away. 
David Chipman, a man with over 20 
years’ experience in the field, who 
worked for this law enforcement agen-
cy and risked his life in doing so, has 
been nominated by President Biden to 
head the Agency. And the Republicans 
can’t stand the idea. The fact that an 
actual law enforcement agency person 
who has this experience would lead the 
Agency just drives them wild to think 
about it, and they are opposed to it. 
Yes, it is true, he is for gun safety, 
and he has made it clear.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4761 
June 24, 2021 
Let me tell you about a couple of 
radical ideas he had. He believes that 
we should keep guns out of the hands 
of felons and people who are mentally 
unable. Well, there is a radical idea 
when it comes to gun safety, so radical 
that 84 percent of the American peo-
ple—some say 90 percent of the Amer-
ican people, including a majority of 
gun owners—support this idea, and so 
does Mr. Chipman. That makes him a 
radical in the eyes of some of our col-
leagues. To me, he is as mainstream as 
they come. 
When it comes to assault weapons, 
for example, he believes there are some 
guns that really have no place in the 
ordinary self-defense, sporting, and 
hunting world and can only be used as 
machines for killing. Over half the 
American people happen to agree with 
him. I do too. For that reason, many 
Republicans oppose him. They say, 
‘‘He’s a radical, he’s a zealot.’’ I have 
heard all these words. 
He is a man who has lived his life 
through the ATF for more than 20 
years. He has the support of law en-
forcement and deserves a chance to 
lead this Agency. 
These ideas that he has—wouldn’t it 
be wonderful if the U.S. Senate—think 
about that—the U.S. Senate could pass 
legislation 
to 
require 
background 
checks to keep guns out of the hands of 
convicted felons? The American people 
want it. We can’t touch it. 
You ask people on the committee, on 
the Republican side: Well, what should 
we do about gun violence? They have 
got an answer. What is their answer? 
We need more guns in America. We 
need more people carrying guns in 
America. Two or three of the members 
of the committee today on the Repub-
lican side, Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, were proud to speak about this 
issue of concealed carry. One actually 
said she carries a gun. I don’t know if 
she does it in the Capitol Building. 
That is her business. But that is how 
far it has come, this notion that the so-
lution to gun violence is more guns 
when 109 people a day are dying in 
America from gun violence. This isn’t 
happening in other nations around the 
world. We are unique, and we should be 
embarrassed by this unique situation 
that we have so much gun violence and 
gun death in America. 
President Biden made it clear yester-
day as well that this notion that he is 
for defunding the police is ludicrous. 
He called yesterday for billions of dol-
lars to our police to do their job more 
effectively, and I support it. I want to 
make sure that the police who receive 
these funds are well trained and admin-
ister justice in a fair way and without 
the abuses that we have seen with the 
death of George Floyd and other in-
stances. 
Yes, invest in that, but have the wis-
dom to understand that the police need 
helping hands as well. The police would 
gladly give the issue of domestic vio-
lence over to social workers and psy-
chologists, who really could get into 
this situation and find an effective so-
lution that doesn’t risk lives and 
doesn’t endanger the lives of the police. 
They need a helping hand, and we 
should give it to them. 
When it comes to law and order, I 
hear the Republican leader come to the 
floor and talk about the need for law 
and order, and I can’t help but think it 
was just 2 weeks ago when he was given 
a chance to support a bipartisan com-
mission to look into the worst lawless-
ness we have seen in the U.S. Capitol 
since 1813. 
On January 6, 2021, thousands coming 
from the speech by President Trump 
formed an insurrectionist mob and de-
scended on this Capitol. I will never 
forget that day as long as I live, and, 
yes, we ought to get to the bottom of 
it. Who financed that? Who planned 
that? Who was behind that? There are 
serious questions to be asked and an-
swered. Who stopped the bill with the 
filibuster for a bipartisan commission 
asking and answering those questions? 
The same Senator who was coming 
here a few minutes ago giving a speech 
on law and order. It doesn’t follow. 
If Senator MCCONNELL
believes we 
should have law and order, it should 
start with the Senate Chamber and the 
Capitol Building. Isn’t that our first re-
sponsibility as elected Members? Of 
course it is. What happened January 6 
cannot and should not be swept under 
the rug. 
It is interesting to me, as I consider 
the nominees of the Biden administra-
tion and the reaction on the Repub-
lican side. Mr. Chipman was the latest 
victim of their attacks. Some on the 
political extreme even went so far as to 
doctor films so that it reflected the 
presence of Mr. Chipman at events he 
didn’t even attend, events he had no 
business with as a member of ATF. 
That is the extent they will go to un-
dermine the Biden administration’s 
nominees. 
And I can’t help but notice that when 
it comes to assertive women of color, 
that really drives many Republicans to 
a level of rage. Vanita Gupta. Kristen 
Clarke. These women are extremely 
talented, 
professional 
women 
with 
amazing resumes who are now luckily 
serving this Nation because of a vote in 
the Senate, but the opposition to them 
went way beyond anything that was ra-
tional or explainable. 
Senator 
MCCONNELL
said 
we 
shouldn’t make ownership of guns 
more burdensome. I think that is gen-
erally right, but if making sure that 
convicted felons don’t own guns is a 
slight burden on those who are legally 
entitled to own guns, I think it is not 
too much to ask. 
I am all for people exercising their 
Second Amendment rights to use guns 
safely, respectfully, follow the law, and 
store them, as well, in that same fash-
ion, and to ask them to go through a 
background check to make sure they 
are qualified is not too much, and it 
saves lives in the process. 
The gun lobby tries to stop the Sen-
ate from confirming the Director of the 
ATF, but we are going to move forward 
and do it. There wasn’t a Senate-con-
firmed 
Director 
under 
President 
Trump. In fact, there hasn’t been one 
since 2015. This man, Mr. Chipman, is 
extremely well qualified—25 years of 
experience. He worked in the field in 
Virginia, Texas, and Michigan. He 
knows the Agency inside and out. He is 
the right person. 
Background 
checks—is 
that 
too 
much to ask? I don’t think so. We 
should pass the bill. In March, the 
House of Representatives passed H.R. 8, 
a bipartisan bill to close the gaps in 
the background checks system. We 
ought to do the same. 
Addressing gun violence is a top pri-
ority of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. In fact, the committee has al-
ready held four hearings on the topic. 
The first was the day after the mass 
shooting—the most recent mass shoot-
ing in Boulder, CO, that left 10 people 
dead. Sadly, unimaginably—listen to 
this number, Mr. President—that was 
just one of 299 mass shootings in Amer-
ica so far this year. That is more than 
one mass shooting every single day. 
What is going on? How can we tolerate 
that situation in our country? 
Yet, during the first hearing on gun 
violence in our committee, one of the 
Republican members of the committee 
described the hearing as ‘‘ridiculous 
theater.’’ Ridiculous theater. Do you 
want to know what ridiculous theater 
really looks like? It is filibustering a 
piece of gun safety reform like uni-
versal background checks supported by 
90 percent of the people. It is calling 
for an enforcement of gun laws already 
on the books and blocking anyone from 
being confirmed who will do it. Ridicu-
lous theater is tweeting slogans in re-
sponse to a spike in gun violence rath-
er than coming up with solutions. 
The Presiding Officer knows as well 
as I do and maybe even better that 
there have been too many funerals, too 
many lives lost to the scourge of gun 
violence. Can we get serious for one 
moment on a bipartisan basis and dedi-
cate ourselves to reducing gun violence 
and saving lives in America? We have a 
President who is ready to lead us in 
that direction. I hope my other col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
will join Democrats in enacting legisla-
tion to keep America safe. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING FATHER RAY 
DOHERTY 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are 
some people who leave an indelible 
mark on your life, from the moment 
you meet them. On June 7, the Saint 
Michael’s College community lost one 
such person with the passing of Father 
Raymond Doherty. As an alumnus of 
Saint Michael’s College, I was shaped 
by the academic experience and lasting 
tight-knit community that a small col-
lege provides and will always feel a 
deep connection to the school. As a fel-
low alumnus, Father Doherty was a

pillar of the Saint Michael’s commu-
nity and played a fundamental role in 
guiding and molding not only the Col-
lege but its students for decades. 
Raymond J. Doherty was born and 
raised in Newton, MA, and in 1948 he 
enrolled as a student at Saint Mi-
chael’s College in Colchester, VT, a 
journalism student and skilled pitcher 
on the varsity baseball team. Upon his 
graduation in 1951, Father Doherty 
served his country as a staff sergeant 
and combat correspondent in the U.S. 
Marine Corps during the Korean war. 
In 1953, Father Doherty returned to 
Vermont and joined the Society of 
Saint Edmund at the Edmundite Novi-
tiate in Putney, where he took his first 
vows in 1954. Father Doherty was or-
dained into the priesthood in 1958 at 
the Cathedral of Immaculate Concep-
tion 
in 
Burlington, 
VT. 
As 
an 
Edmundite 
priest, 
Father 
Doherty 
spent the subsequent decades working 
throughout Vermont, New England, 
and across the South during the civil 
rights era, where he preached, served 
the community, and worked to further 
the cause of social justice. 
Although his assignments pulled him 
to different corners of the globe, his 
home was always Saint Michael’s. 
After many terms as a member of the 
staff and Campus Ministry at Saint Mi-
chael’s throughout the 1960s and 1970s, 
Father Doherty returned permanently 
to Saint Michael’s in 1985. His career at 
Saint Michael’s spanned a variety of 
roles in the admissions office, athletics 
department, and as campus chaplain. 
Until his passing, Father Ray, as he 
was affectionately known, remained 
deeply involved on the Saint Michael’s 
campus and in the surrounding commu-
nity. 
He leaves behind a life and legacy 
that should be an inspiration to many. 
Father Ray, through his compassion, 
humility, and commitment to serving 
his community, exemplifies what it 
means to be a Vermonter and a true 
leader. He led by example and inspired 
his students and those around him to 
strive to understand and address the 
needs and circumstances of all, to lead 
with grace, and to tirelessly work to 
improve the lives of others. 
Father Ray once told me that when 
the time came for him to be called 
home, he hoped to fall asleep here and 
wake up there. That stuck with me. It 
is a comfort to know that wish came 
true. Like the extended Saint Mi-
chael’s College community, I will miss 
Father Doherty. His legacy will live on 
in the students he taught, the lives he 
impacted, and the words he preached. 
Father Ray will be deeply missed.

TRIBUTE TO BOB GRAY 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would 
like to take a moment to acknowledge 
the efforts and contributions of a long-
time friend and advocate for dairy 
farmers in Vermont and across the 
country, Bob Gray. As he retires later 
this month, he leaves an enduring im-
print on Vermont’s bedrock agricul-
tural sector. 
I first met Bob in 1978 when he joined 
the staff of Vermont Senator Jim Jef-
fords, who passed away in 2014. Bob and 
Jim were an unstoppable force, pushing 
in the late seventies for Federal legis-
lation that eventually became the 1981 
federal Farmland Protection Policy 
Act. Bob understood the growing ur-
gency of protecting the Nation’s work-
ing landscapes from development, frag-
mentation, and speculation—and espe-
cially for rural States like Vermont. 
He also understood that, so long as 
farmers had a voice and a seat at the 
table, conservation and agriculture 
could be mutually reinforcing, not ad-
versarial. 
Bob’s love for the land and those who 
steward it comes naturally, having 
been raised on a dairy farm in Cayuga 
County, NY. After earning his bachelor 
of science degree in animal science at 
Cornell University, he served the Na-
tion as an Army officer in the First In-
fantry Division out of Fort Riley, KS, 
before joining the New York National 
Guard and serving for 3 more years, ris-
ing to the rank of captain. 
Since 1990, Bob has led the Northeast 
Dairy Farmers Cooperatives, a trade 
association representing dairy farmers 
in Vermont and the region. Through-
out the decades of challenging policy 
discussions and many farm bills, I 
could always count on Bob to provide 
me with sound counsel, always keeping 
the interests of Vermont’s dairy farm-
ers first and foremost. That counsel 
has always been especially important 
to me during challenging years for 
dairy, like this one has been. Dairy 
farmers across the United States are 
much stronger than they would now be 
were it not for Bob Gray’s work. 
Bob’s immeasurable contributions to 
the dairy industry and our decades- 
long friendship are strong enough that 
I have welcomed him to join me at 
farm shows and agricultural fairs in 
New England, despite his unmitigated 
and puzzling cheerleading for the New 
York Yankees. 
When Bob announced his retirement, 
I made sure to join his final board 
meeting with the Northeast Dairy 
Farmers Cooperatives. The farmers 
whom he has worked with and industry 
leaders who have relied on his exper-
tise, including myself, will certainly 
feel his absence and miss his kindness. 
Beyond his advocacy, Bob has always 
been a good friend to Marcelle and me 
for so many years—something we will 
always cherish. As he embarks on this 
next and exciting part of his life, I 
want to acknowledge Bob’s work and 
thank him for his decades of support 
for Vermont’s dairy farmers and the 
U.S. dairy industry and wish him the 
best of luck.

RECOGNIZING WDEV RADIO 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, lost in 
the continuously emerging world of so-
cial media is the iconic bedrock of 
community news: radio. I would like to 
take a moment to celebrate a mile-
stone in Vermont radio: 90 years on the 
air for WDEV. At 5:50 in the morning of 
Thursday July 16, 1931, the broad-
casters at WDEV turned on their 
microphones for the very first time. 
Ninety years later, WDEV remains a 
Vermont institution, bringing colorful 
conversation, sports commentary, and 
great music to thousands of listeners 
every day. Growing up in Central 
Vermont, I have always enjoyed tuning 
in to WDEV. Throughout my time in 
the Senate, I have spoken to anchors 
and morning show hosts at WDEV more 
times than I can recall. 
WDEV has been independently owned 
and operated by Radio Vermont since 
1935. Radio Vermont was founded by 
Lloyd Squier, who ran the company for 
44 years, until his death in 1979. From 
then until 2017, Lloyd’s son, Ken, has 
been at the helm. Beginning in 1966, 
Ken has hosted the Saturday morning 
classic and a personal favorite: ‘‘Music 
To Go To The Dump By.’’ Ken still 
cohosts the program—what he calls the 
‘‘children’s 
program 
for 
adults.’’ 
‘‘Music To Go To The Dump By’’ pro-
vides a fun, thoughtful and light-
hearted weekly digest of the goings-on 
throughout 
the 
State, 
with 
com-
mentary from its panel of hosts and 
their wide array of guests. 
Whether it is ‘‘Music To Go To The 
Dump By,’’ the ‘‘Vermont Viewpoint,’’ 
or 
a 
race 
at 
Thunder 
Road, 
we 
Vermonters can always turn to WDEV 
for fresh and interesting programming 
that keeps us all smiling, engaged, and 
informed. While it is certainly chal-
lenging to catch a broadcast from here 
in the Nation’s Capital, I am eager to 
listen in once I am back home in a few 
weeks’ time. Congratulations to WDEV 
and the team at Radio Vermont on 90 
years of community radio. Keep up the 
great work, and I look forward to call-
ing in soon.

PRIDE MONTH 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we 
celebrate Pride Month, I want to take 
a moment to acknowledge some of the 
trailblazers 
and 
pioneers 
in 
the 
LGBTQ+ community who have led the 
fight for equality. 
Our 
Nation—and 
the 
world—has 
come a long way since the first Pride 
parade was organized more than half a 
century ago. But that progress didn’t 
come about on its own. It demanded 
sacrifice, from activists like Marsha P. 
Johnson, who led the Stonewall Upris-
ing in New York City, and leaders like 
Harvey Milk, who gave his life to ad-
vance LGBTQ+ equality. And it also 
demanded courage, courage that we see 
on display every day. 
Just this week, a defensive lineman 
for the Las Vegas Raiders, Carl Nassib, 
became the first active NFL player to 
come out as gay. In a video he posted, 
Mr. Nassib said he hopes that ‘‘one day 
videos like this and the whole coming- 
out process are just not necessary . . . 
but until then I’m going to do my best 
and my part to cultivate a culture 
that’s 
accepting, 
that’s 
compas-
sionate.’’ That is really what Pride 
Month is all about, joining together to 
embrace our friends and loved ones ex-
actly as they are and cultivating a cul-
ture that is more accepting and com-
passionate. 
Carl 
Nassib’s 
announcement 
this 
week is yet another reminder of how 
far the movement for LGBTQ+ equality 
has come, in my lifetime and even dur-
ing my time in Congress. The year I 
was elected to the U.S. Senate, Con-
gress passed the Defense of Marriage 
Act, a shameful piece of legislation 
that outlawed same-sex marriage. But 
less than two decades later, the Su-
preme Court corrected that mistake by 
making marriage equality the law of 
the land. The sixth anniversary of that 
decision, Obergefell v. Hodges, is com-
ing up this Saturday, the same day as 
Chicago’s Pride in the Park festival in 
Grant Park. It is a remarkable trajec-
tory, and it is one nobody could have 
predicted when I first entered Con-
gress. It also begs the question: What 
progress will our Nation achieve over 
the next 20 years? 
Earlier this year, as chair of the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, I was hon-
ored to gavel in the Senate’s first-ever 
hearing on the EQUALITY Act. It is a 
crucial piece of legislation that would 
strengthen civil rights protections for 
LGBTQ+ Americans and would explic-
itly prohibit discrimination in edu-
cation, 
employment, 
housing, 
and 
other facets of everyday life. The 
EQUALITY Act has already passed the 
House, but it is currently languishing 
in this Chamber. Will we allow this 
Senate to once again stand as a bul-
wark against the tides of progress? Or 
will we join Carl Nassib—and others be-
fore him—in acting with courage? 
This Pride Month, I hope we follow 
Mr. Nassib’s lead, and I hope we do our 
part to cultivate a culture that em-
braces all of our Nation’s children, ex-
actly as who they are. 
ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Philippines—AGM–84L–1 Harpoon Air 
Launched Block II Missiles 
The Government of the Philippines has re-
quested to buy twelve (12) AGM–84L–1 Har-
poon Block II air launched missiles; and two 
(2) ATM–84L–1 Harpoon Block II Exercise 
missiles. Also included are containers; spare 
and repair parts; support and test equip-
ment; publications and technical documenta-
tion; personnel training and training equip-
ment; U.S. Government and contractor engi-
neering, technical, and logistical support 
services; and other related elements of 
logistical and program support. The esti-
mated total cost is $120 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
a strategic partner that continues to be an 
important force for political stability, peace, 
and economic progress in South East Asia. 
The proposed sale will enhance the Phil-
ippines’ interoperability with the U.S. and 
other allied nations, making it a more valu-
able partner in an increasingly important 
area of the world. It will improve the Phil-
ippines’ capability to meet current and fu-
ture threats by providing flexible solutions 
to augment existing surface and air defense. 
The Philippine Air Force is modernizing its 
fighter aircraft to better support its own 
maritime security needs. This capability will 
provide the Philippine Air Force the ability 
to employ a highly reliable and effective sys-
tem to counter or deter maritime aggres-
sions, coastal blockades, and amphibious as-
saults. The Philippines will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing this equipment into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractor will be The Boeing 
Company, St. Louis, MO. There are no 
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require travel of U.S. Government or con-
tractor representatives to the Philippines on 
a temporary basis for program technical sup-
port and management oversight. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Harpoon missile is a non-nuclear 
tactical weapon system currently in service 
in the U.S. Navy and in 29 other foreign na-
tions. It provides a day, night, and adverse 
weather, standoff air-to-surface capability 
and is an effective Anti-Surface Warfare mis-
sile. The AGM–84L incorporates components, 
software, and technical design information 
that are considered sensitive, to include: 
The Radar Seeker. 
The Radar Altimeter. 
The GPS/INS System. 
Operational Flight Program Software. 
Missile operational characteristics and 
performance data. 
These elements are essential to the ability 
of the Harpoon missile to selectively engage 
hostile targets under a wide range of oper-
ations, tactical and environmental condi-
tions. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is CONFIDEN-
TIAL.

3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
Philippines can provide substantially the 
same degree of protection for the sensitive 
technology being released as the U.S. Gov-
ernment. This sale is necessary in further-
ance of the U.S. foreign policy and national 
security objectives outlined in the Policy 
Justification.

this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of the

trum of missions, ranging from simple train-
ing to complex combat scenarios. Aircrews 
save 
the 
required 
aircraft, 
navigation, 
threat, and weapons data on a data transfer 
device that they load into their aircraft be-
fore flight. 
21. The highest level of classification of in-
formation in this potential sale is SECRET. 
22. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
23. A determination has been made that 
the Philippines can provide substantially the 
same degree of protection for the sensitive 
technology being released as the U.S. Gov-
ernment. This sale is necessary in further-
ance of the U.S. foreign policy and national 
security objectives outlined in the Policy 
Justification.

CONFIRMATION OF DAWN 
O’CONNELL 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I would 
like to talk about the HHS Assistant 
Secretary for Preparedness and Re-
sponse. The HHS Assistant Secretary 
for Preparedness and Response, or 
ASPR, is in charge during a public 
health emergency and serves as the 
principal adviser to the Secretary on 
these matters. This is not a political or 
a personal choice for any administra-
tion; it is the law. I know because I 
helped write it. It is a national secu-
rity position, responsible for keeping 
Americans safe from public health 
threats, like COVID–19. It is a role that 
we envisioned with two types of re-
sponsibilities. The ASPR serves an 
operational role. During an emergency, 
the 
ASPR 
coordinates 
the 
public 
health and medical response—whether 
that threat is a hurricane, a novel 
virus, or a chemical attack. The ASPR 
has the responsibility of overseeing the 
development, purchase, and deploy-
ment of lifesaving countermeasures, 
like the COVID–19 vaccine. The ASPR 
is also a policy job, assessing the 
threat landscape and adjusting our 
strategies to best position the United 
States for the threats we face today 
and in the future. 
I am glad that today the Senate was 
able to confirm, by unanimous consent, 
Dawn O’Connell to be the ASPR. Dur-
ing Ms. O’Connell’s nomination process 
for the job, she repeatedly agreed that 
she is ready to serve both roles and 
that the ASPR is in charge during pub-
lic health emergencies. I believe her 
current role as a Senior Counselor to 
the HHS Secretary for COVID Response 
and her previous roles at HHS and in 
Congress have provided her with the 
skills necessary to fulfill the role of 
the ASPR. I was disappointed that it 
took the administration so long to 
nominate someone for this critical 
role, but I am pleased that they picked 
someone of Ms. O’Connell’s qualifica-
tions. The ASPR is critical to the Na-
tion’s response and recovery to the 
COVID pandemic and preparing us 
against whatever comes next.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4767 
June 24, 2021 
I helped orchestrate Ms. O’Connell’s 
confirmation today when I am also re-
leasing a white paper from my role as 
lead Republican on the Senate HELP 
Committee about the role of the ASPR. 
We have learned from two responses 
under two different administrations— 
Ebola under Obama and COVID under 
Trump—that despite Congress’s bipar-
tisan intent that the ASPR be in 
charge in an emergency, that hasn’t 
worked quite the way we envisioned. 
So I have a series of recommendations 
to bolster the role of the ASPR and 
bring greater clarity to our govern-
ment’s 
response 
for 
future 
emer-
gencies. The ASPR needs to have 
strong, effective leadership and play a 
key role in coordinating the Federal 
Government response. The ASPR needs 
to have the authority and resources to 
strengthen public-private partnerships 
in our medical countermeasures, med-
ical supply chain, and healthcare sys-
tem. And the ASPR needs to leverage 
innovation to expand our preparedness 
infrastructure. Senator MURRAY, the 
chair of our HELP Committee, and I 
are working together on bipartisan leg-
islation to address the response to the 
pandemic, and these recommendations 
will see their way into that legislation 
this fall. 
f 
MASK MANDATE 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, if you have 
flown in the past year, you have heard 
the announcement at the beginning of 
every flight that says Federal law re-
quires that passengers wear a mask. 
Well, the last I checked, we have a con-
stitutional 
system, 
and 
Congress 
makes laws. Something is not required 
by Federal law unless Congress passes 
such a law and the President signs it. 
That is the only way something be-
comes a federal law in this country. 
We are coming through a pandemic, 
and we can see the light at the end of 
the tunnel. Over 150 million people in 
the United States are fully vaccinated 
against COVID–19. Any American adult 
who wants to be vaccinated against 
COVID–19 can get vaccinated at this 
point, and the science should drive our 
decisions on how to open up. That is 
why today I introduced a resolution to 
encourage the CDC to review and up-
date its guidance on wearing masks in 
confined spaces to clarify that people 
who 
are 
fully 
vaccinated 
against 
COVID–19 no longer need to wear a 
mask on public transportation in the 
United States, including at airports, on 
commercial flights, and on buses and 
rail systems, and for the Transpor-
tation Security Administration to up-
date its travel guidance to track with 
the latest science. I was joined in this 
effort by Senators COLLINS, LUMMIS, 
WICKER, MORAN and BLACKBURN, and I 
appreciate their support. 
The CDC has been quite clear that 
masks are not needed for people who 
are fully vaccinated. Science matters, 
and vaccines work. The mandate to 
wear masks on planes and on other 
modes of transportation—when they 
are no longer required in many busi-
nesses and restaurants for vaccinated 
people—is hurting the aviation indus-
try. 
If the objective is to encourage peo-
ple to be vaccinated, one way to do 
that is for there to be a real difference 
in what you can do after being vac-
cinated. Repealing this requirement to 
wear masks on airplanes, at airports, 
and on public transportation would in-
crease demand, increase travel, and 
would tie the policy to science. It is a 
commonsense step to take, and I hope 
more of my Senate colleagues will join 
us in encouraging the CDC to follow 
the science.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DAN HENDRIX 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Dan Hendrix, who is 
retiring as president and chief execu-
tive officer of the World Trade Center 
Arkansas and associate vice chancellor 
of the Division of Economic Develop-
ment at the University of Arkansas 
after a remarkable career dedicated to 
economic growth in the Natural State. 
Dan is a proud Arkansan who has 
spent his life demonstrating his com-
mitment to the State and developing 
opportunities to help businesses grow 
and flourish. He learned the tools that 
helped him succeed at the University of 
Arkansas and Arkansas State Univer-
sity, where he earned a bachelor of 
science in business administration with 
minors in marketing and management. 
He started his career at ABF Freight 
System, where he established the sub-
sidiary Container Carrier Corporation 
to transport ocean containers to and 
from major ports in the United States 
and throughout the world. Under his 
guidance, the company expanded im-
port and export operations to U.S. 
ports of entry, and he served in several 
leadership positions within the com-
pany. He brought his skills to an Okla-
homa Transportation Company in 1998. 
In 2001, Dan joined the University of 
Arkansas and established the Office of 
Corporate and Foundation Relations, 
where, among other successes, he led 
efforts to raise more than $1 billion for 
the university as part of the institu-
tion’s Campaign for the Twenty-First 
Century. 
As president and CEO of World Trade 
Center Arkansas, Dan has used his tal-
ent and experience to help connect 
businesses in the State with inter-
national partners since its creation in 
2007. His efforts have resulted in sig-
nificantly increased exports of Arkan-
sas goods and job growth. Today, busi-
nesses from all over Arkansas export 
products to nearly 200 countries and 
support 350,000 jobs in the State. 
During Dan’s tenure as leader of the 
World Trade Center Arkansas, he has 
also educated university students in 
global commerce through the center’s 
student intern program. The center has 
hosted dignitaries from more than 50 
countries and enhanced diplomatic re-
lations between the State of Arkansas 
and the United States with a variety of 
nations and economic partners. 
I applaud Dan for his outstanding 
leadership and accomplished career. He 
has led a life of service and deserves 
our thanks for his military service and 
vision for expanding Arkansas’s foot-
print around the globe. Dan is leaving 
a lasting legacy that will benefit future 
generations of Arkansans. I have been 
honored to work with him, and I appre-
ciate his friendship. I know his wife 
Marilyn, children and grandchildren, 
who are very proud of him, are looking 
forward to spending more time to-
gether. I wish him the best on his re-
tirement.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DAN SEWELL 
∑ Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the career and serv-
ice of a proud Ohioan, Dan Sewell, who 
will retire at the end of June, bringing 
an end to his 44-year career in jour-
nalism. 
Dan spent 39 of those years with the 
Associated Press, serving Americans, 
both by bringing them the news and by 
telling 
their 
stories—in 
Buffalo, 
Miami, San Juan, Atlanta, and Chi-
cago, where he has worked as a writer, 
editor, assistant bureau chief, and 
most recently in our home State, in 
Cincinnati, OH. 
A native of Middletown, OH, Dan 
graduated from Edgewood High School. 
He got his start in journalism as a stu-
dent journalist at Ohio University’s 
student newspaper, The Post. That is 
where Dan and I first met, when he 
interviewed me as the youngest mem-
ber of the Ohio State Legislature. 
Journalists like Dan play a vital role 
in our democracy—they ask tough 
questions, they challenge special inter-
ests and uncover corruption, and they 
connect Americans with their commu-
nities and with the world. Whether it 
was the Grenada Invasion in 1983, Hur-
ricane 
Andrew 
in 
1992, 
Hurricane 
Katrina in 2005, or the mass shooting in 
Dayton’s Oregon District in 2019, Dan 
has done vital work on the frontlines, 
covering stories that matter to people. 
Not only has he made a difference 
through his writing, Dan also teaches 
as a part-time instructor of journalism 
at Miami University in Oxford, OH, 
helping mentor the next generation of 
journalists. 
Dan is a devoted husband to Vickii, 
father of five, and grandfather of nine, 
and plans to spend time with them dur-
ing retirement. And he will have more 
time to partake in his favorite hobby— 
attending Cincinnati Reds’ games. 
On behalf of grateful readers in Ohio 
and around the country, I thank Dan 
Sewell for nearly four decades of serv-
ice in journalism, doing work that is 
important to the fabric of our commu-
nities and our country.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4768 
June 24, 2021 
TRIBUTE TO JEFF KIGHTLINGER 
∑ Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor the long career of 
public service provided to the people of 
Southern 
California 
by 
Jeffery 
Kightlinger, general manager of the 
Metropolitan Water District of South-
ern California, who is retiring after a 
15-year tenure. 
I would like to take a few moments 
to reflect on what an extraordinary 
leader Jeff has been not just for South-
ern California but for the whole State, 
Like Jeff, I care deeply about our 
water future. For years I have turned 
to him for his always wise counsel on 
how to solve the next challenge. Over 
these many years, I have come to view 
Jeff as a friend and to value our friend-
ship. I have also learned to value equal-
ly his leadership abilities. 
The treacherous politics of California 
water and the immense obstacles to 
getting anything done are legendary, 
but Jeff has always been up to the 
task. Jeff is not only one of the smart-
est people I know, but he has unparal-
leled ability to strategize how to ap-
proach a complex water negotiation. 
He has built deep and trusting relation-
ships with many of the key players, 
not only in California but throughout 
the Colorado River Basin. Knowing the 
other parties as well as he does, Jeff is 
able to map out where there is the pos-
sibility of an agreement. He then is 
able to work steadily and patiently 
over months and years, gradually re-
moving the obstacles until the parties 
can finally come together. 
Many of Jeff’s greatest accomplish-
ments have come in guiding major 
changes within the Colorado River 
Basin, helping to collaboratively nego-
tiate landmark pacts among a truce 
among 7 States, two countries, and 10 
Native American tribes. These include 
the Quantification Settlement Agree-
ment, the Lower Colorado River Multi- 
Species Conservation Program, signifi-
cant revisions to the U.S.-Mexico water 
treaty, innovative storage programs in 
Lake Mead, and the Colorado River 
Drought Contingency Plan. This has 
laid a solid foundation for longer term 
solutions to be negotiated over the 
next several years. Jeff has helped 
forge Metropolitan’s partnerships with 
agricultural districts that have re-
placed litigation with cooperation. 
If you evaluate a leader by the re-
sults they accomplish, what Jeff has 
achieved in preparing Southern Cali-
fornia for drought is extraordinary. In 
a time when much of the California and 
the West is desperate for water, South-
ern California stands out for how well 
it is prepared. Millions of acre feet of 
water in storage ensures that the re-
gion can weather this drought even if 
it lasts for several more years. 
It took a whole suite of actions for 
Jeff and Metropolitan to get to this 
place. Knowing that the climate is 
changing and droughts will worsen, 
Metropolitan has invested, planned, 
and prepared, resulting in record water 
storage, reduced water usage in the re-
gion, and unprecedented drought resil-
iency. This didn’t happen by itself. 
Metropolitan’s conservation programs, 
including $350 million in turf removal 
incentives, transformed the Southern 
California landscape as Southern Cali-
fornians embraced conservation as a 
way of life and permanently lowered 
water demands. Metropolitan has also 
launched the Regional Recycled Water 
Program Advanced Purification Cen-
ter, a 500,000-gallon-per-day demonstra-
tion facility that could ultimately 
serve as one of the largest recycled 
water projects in the Nation. 
Under Jeff’s leadership, Metropolitan 
weathered the great recession and sta-
bilized its finances while investing bil-
lions in restoring its aging conveyance 
system and improving its water treat-
ment methods, setting a national ex-
ample for how an agency can meet its 
infrastructure challenges. His record of 
environmental stewardship includes in-
stalling solar power at Metropolitan’s 
water treatment plants and leading the 
organization’s first efforts to address 
climate change. Through apprentice-
ships, recruitment, and promotions, 
Metropolitan was able to transfer the 
specialized knowledge of graying work-
force to a new, diverse generation of 
water leaders. 
No history of 21st century water in 
California and the West would be com-
plete without acknowledging his con-
tributions. Jeff has been an invaluable 
resource to myself, my staff, and those 
of numerous other Members with his 
expert analysis and advice that has in-
formed 
our 
legislative 
work. 
His 
knowledge and counsel will be greatly 
missed. I ask our colleagues to join me 
in congratulating Jeff Kightlinger on 
his retirement and thanking him for 
his long career of public service to the 
people of Southern California.∑

RECOGNIZING RUSTIC ROOTS ON 
SECOND 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I will recognize an out-
standing Kentucky small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize a woman-owned 
small business, Rustic Roots on Second 
of Pikeville, KY, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
Located in downtown Pikeville, Rus-
tic Roots on Second opened its doors in 
2015. After graduating from the Univer-
sity of Kentucky, founder and owner, 
Maura Minix, wanted to provide a place 
for Kentucky artisans to showcase and 
sell their work. Maura, who grew up in 
Prestonsburg, KY, saw an opportunity 
to set up a shop in neighboring 
Pikeville. She established Rustic Roots 
on Second, providing a retail outlet for 
Kentuckian and Appalachian artisans. 
Today, Rustic Roots on Second con-
tinues supporting and promoting small 
businesses and artisans in eastern Ken-
tucky. Over 30 local vendors sell their 
goods at the store, ranging from food 
and textile goods to artwork and fur-
niture made from used bourbon barrels. 
Maura’s mother, Brenda Minix, is a 
key part of the operation, working as 
store manager and serving as the 
‘‘face’’ of the business around town. 
Customers are regularly greeted by 
name and treated according to the 
golden rule. Rustic Roots on Second 
also serves as an event venue, renting 
out its shop for celebrations, fund-
raisers, and business events. The store 
works with local artisans to host class-
es and workshops, rotating offerings to 
meet community interest. From paint-
ing to dulcimer playing, teaching and 
celebrating the arts is a priority. 
Notably, Rustic Roots on Second is a 
leader in downtown Pikesville’s busi-
ness community. They regularly par-
ticipate in local and regional events, 
including 
the 
Appalachian 
Vintage 
Street 
Market, 
Wine-Tasting 
& 
Retailgating, and Pikesville’s famous 
Hillbilly Days festival. Rustic Roots on 
Second is a member of the Southeast 
Kentucky Chamber of Commerce and is 
involved 
with 
Shaping 
Our 
Appa-
lachian 
Region—SOAR—Kentucky, 
which fosters entrepreneurship and in-
novation in the region. They are com-
mitted to revitalizing and promoting 
downtown Pikeville through their sup-
port of the Pikeville Main Street Pro-
gram, Inc. 
Like many small businesses, Rustic 
Roots on Second actively supports 
charitable and civic organizations. For 
several years, Maura and Brenda have 
teamed up with local businesses to host 
picnics and decorate their storefronts 
to thank police officers, firefighters, 
and first responders for their service. 
They regularly support fundraisers for 
clubs, churches, and sports teams and 
have sponsored silent auctions to ben-
efit local schools. Rustic Roots on Sec-
ond’s advocacy and community leader-
ship has been recognized in local and 
regional publications. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic oc-
curred, Pikeville rallied together to 
support Rustic Roots on Second. As a 
nonessential business, Rustic Roots on 
Second 
was 
impacted 
by 
the 
lockdowns. Maura and Brenda adapted, 
overhauling and expanding their online 
store to continue serving customers 
nationwide. As Kentucky reopened, 
Maura and Brenda worked with local 
small businesses to ensure downtown 
Pikeville reopened safely, welcoming 
locals and visitors alike to their vi-
brant community. 
Rustic Roots on Second is an out-
standing example of the critical role 
small businesses play in uplifting and 
advocating for their communities. Con-
gratulations to Maura, Brenda, and the 
entire team at Rustic Roots on Second. 
I wish them the best of luck and look 
forward to watching their continued 
growth and success in Kentucky.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4769 
June 24, 2021 
member of my staff, my former direc-
tor of national security policy, Jason 
Suslavich. I, along with the rest of my 
team was saddened to have Jason leave 
our office this February. 
While born in Winchester, MA, Jason 
was quick to embrace the Alaskan spir-
it. Up north, Jason traded his beach 
walks for hikes and his golf clubs for a 
fishing rod. Like a true Alaskan, he 
loved his wild Alaska seafood and over-
all good cooking and could talk for 
hours about his favorite dishes at his 
favorite restaurants throughout the 
State. One of his favorites was the osso 
bucco at Orso—and could speak tire-
lessly about it. And did. 
In high school, Jason was the all- 
State wrestling champion and was in-
ducted into the National Wrestling 
Hall of Fame. His dedication and tenac-
ity expanded beyond the wrestling mat 
into his academics. At John Hopkins 
University, Jason majored in inter-
national studies, which he has applied 
throughout his career. 
Jason’s 
work 
in 
Alaska 
politics 
began over a decade ago in Congress-
man Don Young’s office. As the Con-
gressman’s legislative assistant, Jason 
laid the foundation for his career in the 
Senate, building productive coalitions 
and facilitating bipartisan collabora-
tion. 
One year into my first term. Jason 
joined our office. At this time, I was 
still learning the ropes in the Senate. 
His work ethic, experience, and depend-
ability made my life a lot easier and 
made him an irreplaceable asset to my 
team. 
Jason was good-natured, a team play-
er, and a legendary prankster. From 
day-to-day tricks to years-long plots, 
Jason was committed to the craft of 
mischief—just ask his nemesis, Mike 
Anderson. 
Jason’s contributions to our office— 
and to the State of Alaska, particu-
larly building on our three pillars of 
military might—were enormous. His 
leadership lives on with Team Sul-
livan. He is greatly missed. 
If this past year has taught us any-
thing, it is the importance of trusting 
our intuition. After 13 years working 
for Alaska s delegation, Jason has de-
cided to chart a new journey—working 
in the aerospace sector. He has loved 
space since he was a child. In this next 
chapter, Jason can dedicate time to his 
great passions: space exploration, the 
strength of our Nation, the Boston Red 
Sox, and most importantly, his beau-
tiful and brilliant wife Sarah. 
Jason may not be working in my of-
fice, but he will always have a home in 
the Last Frontier. His dedication to 
the State has forever solidified him as 
a welcome friend and honorary Alas-
kan. 
Please join me in wishing Jason 
much success and happiness in the fu-
ture.∑ 
∑ Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
rise today in appreciation of a lifelong 
Rhode Islander and a healthcare trail-
blazer, Dr. Al Puerini. We wish him 
well in the next chapter of life. 
Al Puerini was born, raised, and 
trained in Rhode Island. After grad-
uating from his beloved Providence 
College and training in family medi-
cine at Brown University, Al began his 
practice in Cranston, RI, in the early 
eighties. He excelled in his work. He 
soon began teaching family medicine 
at Brown’s Warren Alpert School of 
Medicine and was elected a fellow at 
the American Academy of Family Phy-
sicians. 
But his revolutionary work began in 
the mid–1990s, when Al helped to found 
and then lead the Rhode Island Pri-
mary Care Physicians Corporation as it 
embarked on an important mission: to 
reimagine 
the 
way 
we 
deliver 
healthcare. Al and his RIPCPC col-
leagues combined the talents of over 
150 primary care physicians and over 
200 specialists and negotiated new con-
tracts with local health insurers. In-
stead of following the fee-for-service 
treadmill that encourages doctors to 
shuffle as many people through their 
offices as possible, these new contracts 
rewarded providers for the health of 
their patients. They also aimed to in-
crease collaboration and communica-
tion among specialists, providers, and 
hospitals to improve health outcomes. 
As these contracts proved effective, 
Al and his board decided to think big-
ger. In 2014, they joined with Care New 
England to help form Integra Commu-
nity Care Network, the largest ac-
countable care organization, ACO, in 
Rhode Island. The Affordable Care 
Act’s accountable care organizations 
take the principle Al had pursued for 
years—paying providers based on the 
health of their patients—and put it to 
use in the Medicare Program. At 
Integra, primary care providers, hos-
pitals, specialists, extended care pro-
viders, and others all work together to 
achieve more coordinated, accountable 
care. As someone who fought for ACOs 
in the ACA, I was thrilled to see Rhode 
Islanders step up to that challenge. 
Integra now serves more than 1 in 10 
patients in Rhode Island. It has been a 
national success. Beyond Medicare pa-
tients, it works with major private in-
surers and Medicaid. It has earned a 95- 
percent quality rating from the Fed-
eral Government and saved over $20 
million in healthcare costs since 2015. 
Integra now stands a model for ACOs 
across the country. 
Even as he built a new national 
model of care, Al never stopped serving 
his patients, his community, and his 
beloved alma mater, Providence Col-
lege. He maintained his Cranston pri-
vate practice for over three decades. He 
was recognized as Rhode Island’s ‘‘Top 
Doc’’ twice over that span. He was 
named a Rhode Island Academy of 
Family Physicians Physician of the 
Year in 2017. And he sustained a pas-
sion for sports medicine, which he cul-
tivated as the Friars’ head team physi-
cian from 1988 on. He even earned a 
spot in the Providence College Hall of 
Fame 2 years ago. 
Dr. Puerini, congratulations on your 
well-deserved retirement. You have 
shown us how to change the way health 
care is delivered and proven to the Na-
tion that the triple aim of better care, 
lower costs, and happier and healthier 
patients is achievable. Thank you for 
everything you did to improve the care 
of Rhode Islanders and for the care you 
personally provided to so patients 
through the years. You made a tremen-
dous difference.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-

were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–22. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Missouri 
applying to the United States Congress, 
under the provisions of Article V of the 
United States Constitution, for the calling of 
a convention of the states limited to pro-
posing amendments to the United States 
Constitution that impose fiscal restraints on 
the federal government, limit the power and 
jurisdiction of the federal government, and 
limit the terms of office for its officials and 
members of Congress; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 4 
Whereas, the Founders of our Constitution 
empowered state legislators to be guardians 
of liberty against future abuses of power by 
the federal government; and 
Whereas, the federal government has cre-
ated a crushing national debt through im-
proper and imprudent spending; and 
Whereas, the federal government has in-
vaded the legitimate roles of the states 
through the manipulative process of federal 
mandates, most of which are unfunded to a 
great extent; and 
Whereas, 
the 
federal 
government 
has 
ceased to live under a proper interpretation 
of the Constitution of the United States; and 
Whereas, it is the solemn duty of the 
states to protect the liberty of our people— 
particularly for the generations to come—to 
propose amendments to the United States 
Constitution through a convention of states 
under Article V to place clear restraints on 
these and related abuses of power; and 
Whereas, the Ninety-Ninth General Assem-
bly of Missouri, First Regular Session, 
adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4, 
which contained an application for an Arti-
cle V Convention to propose constitutional 
amendments identical to those proposed in 
this resolution, but provided that the appli-
cation would expire five years after the pas-
sage of Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the members of the Missouri Sen-
ate, One Hundred First General Assembly, 
First Regular Session, the House of Rep-
resentatives 
concurring 
therein, 
hereby 
apply to Congress, under the provisions of 
Article V of the United States Constitution, 
for the calling of a convention of the states 
limited to proposing amendments to the 
United States Constitution that impose fis-
cal restraints on the federal government, 
limit the power and jurisdiction of the fed-
eral government, and limit the terms of of-
fice for its officials and members of Con-
gress; and be it further

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4771 
June 24, 2021 
Resolved that the General Assembly adopts 
this application with the following under-
standings (as the term ‘‘understandings’’ is 
used within the context of ‘‘reservations, un-
derstandings, and declarations’’): 
(1) An application to Congress for an Arti-
cle V convention confers no power on Con-
gress other than to perform a ministerial 
function to ‘‘call’’ for a convention; 
(2) This ministerial duty shall be per-
formed by Congress only when Article V ap-
plications for substantially the same purpose 
are received from two-thirds of the legisla-
tures of the several states; 
(3) The power of Congress to ‘‘call’’ a con-
vention solely consists of the authority to 
name a reasonable time and place for the ini-
tial meeting of the convention; 
(4) Congress possesses no power whatsoever 
to name delegates to the convention, as this 
power remains exclusively within the au-
thority of the legislatures of the several 
states; 
(5) Congress possesses no power to set the 
number of delegates to be sent by any states; 
(6) Congress possesses no power whatsoever 
to determine any rules for such convention; 
(7) By definition, a Convention of States 
means that states vote on the basis of one 
state, one vote; 
(8) A Convention of States convened pursu-
ant to this application is limited to consider-
ation of topics specified herein and no other; 
(9) The General Assembly of Missouri may 
recall its delegates at any time for breach of 
their duties or violations of their instruc-
tions pursuant to the procedures adopted in 
this resolution; 
(10) Pursuant to the text of Article V, Con-
gress 
may 
determine 
whether 
proposed 
amendments shall be ratified by the legisla-
tures of the several states or by special state 
ratification conventions. The General As-
sembly of Missouri recommends that Con-
gress specify its choice on ratification meth-
odology contemporaneously with the call for 
the convention; 
(11) Congress possesses no power whatso-
ever with regard to the Article V convention 
beyond the two powers acknowledged herein; 
(12) Missouri places express reliance on 
prior legal and judicial determinations that 
Congress possesses no power under Article I 
relative to the Article V process, and that 
Congress must act only as expressly specified 
in Article V; and be it further 
Resolved That this application hereby re-
peals, rescinds, cancels, renders null and 
void, and supercedes the application to the 
Congress of the United States for a conven-
tion under Article V of the Constitution of 
the United States by this state in Senate 
Concurrent Resolution No. 4 as adopted by 
the Ninety-Ninth General Assembly, First 
Regular Session; and be it further 
Resolved That the Secretary of the Senate 
be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed 
copy of this resolution for the President and 
Secretary of the United States Senate, the 
Speaker and Clerk of the United States 
House of Representatives, each member of 
the Missouri Congressional delegation, and 
the presiding officers of each of the legisla-
tive houses in the several states requesting 
their cooperation. 
POM–23. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Missouri 
urging the United States Congress to resist 
any attempt to increase the number of Jus-
tices on the United States Supreme Court; to 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 6 
Whereas, an independent United States Su-
preme Court is an essential element of Amer-
ica’s system of checks and balances that pro-
tects our constitutional rights; and 
Whereas, the United States Supreme Court 
has been composed of nine Justices for more 
than 150 years; and 
Whereas, the President of the United 
States and Congress should be prohibited 
from undermining the independence of the 
Supreme Court by changing the number of 
Justices on the Supreme Court: Now there-
fore be it 
Resolved, That the members of the Missouri 
Senate, One Hundred First General Assem-
bly, First Regular Session, the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring therein, hereby urge 
the United States Congress to resist any at-
tempt to increase the number of Justices on 
the United States Supreme Court; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate 
be instructed to prepare properly inscribed 
copies of this resolution for the President of 
the United States Senate, the Speaker of the 
United States House of Representatives and 
the members of the Missouri Congressional 
delegation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. 
CASSIDY, 
Ms. 
SINEMA, 
Mrs. 
MURRAY, Mr. CASEY, and Mr. 
CARDIN): 
S. 2204. A bill to amend title XI of the 
Social Security Act to clarify the mail-
ing requirement relating to social se-
curity account statements; to the Com-
mittee on Finance. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madame President, Sen-
ator CASSIDY and I are reintroducing a 
simple bill that can have a big impact: 
the Know Your Social Security Act. 
The bill clarifies the law about Con-
gressional intent so that every worker 
over 25 receives a paper Social Security 
statement in the mail each year, unless 
the worker has accessed their state-
ment online or declined to receive the 
statement in the mail. 
The story is well known in Social Se-
curity circles, but it bears repeating: 
the origin story of the Social Security 
statement all started with the ‘‘power-
ful’’ Committee on Finance. Senator 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan spelled out 
the reasoning: ‘‘All of us pay into So-
cial Security but rarely, until we be-
come beneficiaries, do we ever hear 
from Social Security . . . in every pay-
check, we see money withheld for So-
cial Security, but we hear nary a word 
from the Social Security Administra-
tion. Let us take this simple step [ 
sending statements] to reassure Ameri-
cans that Social Security will be there 
for them.’’ 
After 
enactment 
and 
once 
fully 
phased in, every worker aged 25 and

older received an annual statement 
from Social Security starting in the 
year 2000. After a few years, Social Se-
curity’s website allowed workers to ac-
cess their statement online. At the 
time, that was a nice feature—and did 
not impact the mailing of statements. 
Later—to fund more pressing needs— 
SSA viewed the online option as ‘‘pro-
viding’’ the worker with a statement 
and fulfilling the requirements of the 
law. SSA stopped mailing the state-
ments in 2011 to everyone over 25. Cur-
rently, only individuals over the age of 
60 who are not receiving benefits re-
ceive 
statements 
automatically 
through the mail. 
Paper statements delivered through 
the mail are desirable because no ac-
tion is necessary by the worker and the 
statement is a yearly reminder to the 
worker to think about the future. Re-
search has shown that workers pro-
vided with statements are significantly 
more likely to save, more certain 
about their retirement income, and 
have higher satisfaction with their fi-
nances relative to those who are not 
provided with any type of financial 
planning materials. Providing Social 
Security statement through the mail is 
a simple policy that could help many 
workers, hopefully leading to better de-
cisions about their financial future. 
Ways and Means Social Security Sub-
committee Chairman JOHN LARSON and 
Ways and Means Committee Member 
VERN BUCHANAN are reintroducing the 
companion bill in the House of Rep-
resentatives. The bill is endorsed by 
AARP, Alliance for Retired Americans, 
Envelope Manufacturers Association 
(EMA), Justice in Aging, NAACP, Na-
tional Committee to Preserve Social 
Security and Medicare, Paralyzed Vet-
erans of America, Social Security 
Works, Strengthen Social Security Co-
alition, The Arc of the United States, 
and The Senior Citizens League. I hope 
our colleagues in the Senate will join 
us and cosponsor the Know Your Social 
Security Act. Together, we can work 
towards better retirement outcomes 
for all workers. 
By Mr. THUNE: 
S. 2207. A bill to temporarily increase 
the availability of temporary non-

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Ms. COLLINS, Mrs. SHAHEEN, and 
Mr. KELLY): 
S. 2223. A bill to amend the Farm Se-
curity and Rural Investment Act of 
2002 to improve assistance to commu-
nity wood facilities, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Community 
Wood Facilities Assistance Act of 2021. 
My colleagues Senators COLLINS, SHA-
HEEN, and KELLY are joining me as 
original cosponsors of the bill. 
This bill will assist with the con-
struction of facilities for mass timber, 
tall wood, and other innovative wood 
products, in order to make sustainable 
use of small-diameter timber from for-
est thinnings and other needed treat-
ments in Eastern and Western forests. 
The bill will also help to create jobs 
in disadvantaged rural and forest-de-
pendent communities, and will help to 
reduce wildfire risk by removing dan-
gerous fuels that can build up. 
The Forest Service reports that 80 
million acres of Forest Service lands 
alone are at risk of catastrophic wild-
fire or abnormal levels of insect and 
disease infestations. 
While 
Federal 
land 
management 
agencies are working to increase the 
pace and scale of restoration activities, 
clearly we need to do more. In Cali-
fornia we are facing a severe drought, 
and even before the onset of this most 
recent drought there were 150 million 
dead or dying trees due to insect dam-
age. We are truly facing a monumental 
challenge. 
A recent comprehensive analysis by 
The Nature Conservancy and Bain and 
Company 
management 
consultants 
found that creating a restoration econ-
omy can play an important role in ex-
panding the pace and scale of eco-
logically based forest restoration. The 
report recommended funding and in-
centives to ‘‘bridge the gap between 
the cost of ecological thinning and the 
economic viability of wood-processing 
infrastructure.’’ 
As the report explains, ‘‘If more ag-
gressive restoration targets can be 
met, there will be significant need for 
additional processing capacity to de-
fray restoration costs and provide valu-
able end uses for thinned material.’’ 
Our bill responds to the challenge of 
developing funding measures to im-
prove the economic viability of wood- 
processing infrastructure to reduce the 
cost of forest restoration and provide 
valuable uses for the small diameter 
material. 
Fortunately, we do not need to cre-
ate a whole new program to improve 
the economic viability of wood-proc-
essing infrastructure. The Forest Serv-
ice has two existing grant programs 
that can help: the Community Wood 
Energy and Wood Innovations Grant 
Program and the Wood Innovations 
Program. 
These programs would benefit from 
amendments to increase their utility 
for improving the viability of wood- 
processing 
infrastructure. 
In 
par-
ticular, the program could benefit from 
higher Federal cost-shares and an in-
creased ability to provide more funding 
for each project, in addition to a higher 
authorization of funding overall. 
More specifically, our bill will revise 
the Forest Service’s Community Wood 
Energy and Wood Innovations Grant 
Program, which provides assistance to 
the capital cost of small wood products 
facilities. Specifically, our bill would: 
Increase the authorization from $25 
million to $50 million per year; 
Increase the maximum grant per fa-
cility from $1 to $5 million; 
Increase the Federal cost-share from 
35% to 50%; and 
Increase the maximum size for com-
munity wood energy systems eligible 
for 
grant 
funding 
from 
5 
to 
15 
megawatts, among other provisions. 
Our bill will also revise the Forest 
Service’s Wood Innovations Grant Pro-
gram, which provides grants for pro-
posed innovative uses and applications 
and the expansion of markets for wood 
products. Our bill would reduce the 
minimum non-Federal cost-share from 
50% to 33.3% and makes other tech-
nical changes identified by the Forest 
Service. 
I thank the Senators who have joined 
me in cosponsoring this bill, and I urge 
the full Senate to promptly take up 
this bill and pass it as soon as possible.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4779 
June 24, 2021 
for success adapt to the demands of the 
2lst century, so too must the instruc-
tion and preparation educators receive. 
Educators are tasked with designing 
educational experiences that rise to 
the rigorous State academic standards 
and reflect the needs and interests of 
our Nation’s diverse student popu-
lation. This past school year with the 
pandemic was even more demanding 
our Nation’s educators as they were 
faced with new teaching challenges and 
adapting to virtual or hybrid learning 
environments. Prior to the pandemic, 
school districts were faced with wide-
spread teacher shortages, with nearly 
every State reporting shortages of 
teachers in high-need subjects like 
math, science, ahd special education. 
Data from the U.S. Department of Edu-
cation shows COVID–19 has only exac-
erbated those needs with 43 States re-
porting shortages in math teachers, 42 
in science teachers, and 44 in special 
education for the 2020–21 school year. 
We must find ways to strengthen the 
educator talent pipeline to ensure our 
students have access to high-quality 
educators and school leaders. We also 
must address the fact that schools in 
high-need 
communities 
are 
often 
staffed by a revolving door of underpre-
pared and inexperienced teachers who 
unable to meet students’ needs. Ac-
cording to the U.S. Department of Edu-
cation’s Civil Rights Data Collection, 
in 2016, schools with high enrollments 
of students of color were four times as 
likely to hire uncertified teachers as 
were schools with low enrollments of 
students of color. This in part due to 
State teacher shortages. 
This is why I am pleased to introduce 
today with my colleague, Senator COL-
LINS, the Preparing and Retaining Edu-
cation Professionals Act, or PREP Act. 
As schools across our Nation continue 
to face growing class sizes, many are 
struggling with a shortage of qualified 
teachers. Rural communities in par-
ticular are experiencing a dearth of 
teachers equipped to meet their grow-
ing needs. The PREP Act aims to cre-
ate high-quality teacher residency pro-
grams to develop a diverse workforce 
that is well prepared to provide the 
educational 
opportunities 
students 
need to be successful in the 21st cen-
tury. 
More specifically, this legislation 
would expand the definition of ‘‘high 
need’’ districts under the Every Stu-
dent Succeeds Act, ESSA, to include 
those experiencing teacher shortages in 
rural communities and in areas such as 
special education, English language, 
science, 
technology, 
engineering, 
math, and CTE, to allow for access to 
additional support and improvement. It 
would also encourage school districts 
to establish partnerships with local 
community colleges and universities to 
ensure their education programs are 
developing future teachers in content 
areas where there is currently a short-
age of educators. It would increase ac-
cess to teacher and school leader resi-
dency programs and preparation train-
ing while requiring States to identify 
areas of teacher or leader shortages by 
subject across public schools and use 
that data to target their efforts. Addi-
tionally, the PREP Act bolsters sup-
port for teacher preparation programs 
at minority serving institutions, MSIs, 
or historically Black colleges and uni-
versities, HBCUs, to invest in a diverse 
and well-prepared educator workforce. 
Improving our Nation’s educational 
system is contingent on our ability to 
prepare, support, and retain quality 
educators. Research shows that better 
prepared teachers stay longer in the 
profession and are more likely to re-
main in their roles and positively im-
pact young people and their commu-
nities. As we continue to focus on re-
covering from the pandemic, I hope 
that my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle see the PREP Act as a common-
sense opportunity to help ensure that 
students in every ZIP Code across the 
country have the well-prepared teach-
ers and school leaders they deserve. 
By Mr. BROWN: 
S. 2255. A bill to extend the trade ad-
justment assistance program for one 
month; considered and passed. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, one week 
from today, on July 1st, Trade Adjust-
ment Assistance will expire. 
This is our only tool to support work-
ers who lose their jobs because of coun-
tries like China that cheat the rules. 
And in one week, it goes away. This is 
an economic problem and a China prob-
lem. 
All of us, of both parties, recognize 
the threat that countries like China 
pose to our economy. It’s why just two 
weeks ago, we came together and 
passed the Endless Frontiers Act on a 
broad, bipartisan basis: To secure and 
expand our domestic supply chains, to 
support R&D to ensure the next gen-
eration of manufacturing is developed 
in America and made in America, and 
to finally—finally—ensure that Ameri-
cans’ tax dollars are used to buy Amer-
ican products that support American 
jobs. 
This should not be controversial. 
We are working to undo decades of 
bad trade policy with China, and dec-
ades of neglect for our domestic supply 
chains. That’s going to take years. We 
know corporations won’t stop out-
sourcing jobs on July 1st. We know 
China isn’t going to stop cheating and 
undermining American industries on 
July 1st. And we know our manufactur-
ers will still have to compete against 
governments that prop up their com-
petitors on July 1st. 
We owe it to workers, who we know 
are going to have their lives upended 
through no fault of their own to unfair 
trade, to do everything we can to ease 
the transition. Today, I’m not asking 
for a complete renewal of the program. 
I’m not even asking for an extra year 
of the program. 
I, on behalf of my Democratic col-
leagues and American workers, asked 
for unanimous consent from this body 
for a straight 3–month extension of 
TAA, so that we can keep having the 
conversations about how best to struc-
ture the program going forward. It ap-
pears that my friends on the other side 
would prefer a 1-month extension. I 
would like more, but in the spirit of 
compromise—this 
beats 
the 
alter-
native—letting TAA expire and leaving 
workers in the lurch. 
And while that dialogue continues, 
workers get the help they need. 
We know workers are losing jobs to 
China all over the country. Sadly, that 
happens every week, every day. 
By extending this program, service 
workers and people whose jobs get 
shipped overseas to countries without 
trade agreements will get help. 
Training funds, will continue being 
provided, at a time when we need to 
train people for the new jobs that we 
want industry to create. We all want 
the US economy to be more resilient in 
the face of economic shocks. We all 
want to see fewer communities dev-
astated by unfair trade. We all want 
American workers’ hard work to pay 
off TAA is part of that. 
We came together to extend it in 
2011. We came together to extend it in 
2015. We must do the same today. 
If you love this country you fight for 
the people who make it work. That’s 
what we do with Trade Adjustment As-
sistance.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4780 
June 24, 2021 
BOOKER, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND, Ms. WARREN, Mr. 
WYDEN, and Mr. MARKEY): 
S. 2272. A bill to amend the Safe 
Drinking Water Act to increase fund-
ing for lead reduction projects, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the ‘‘Lead-Free Drinking 
Water for All Act.’’ This legislation 
would authorize $45 billion to replace 
every lead pipe and service line in 
America over the next 10 years, ensur-
ing clean water for all. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, the most com-
mon sources of lead in drinking water 
are lead pipes, faucets, and plumbing 
fixtures. Nationwide, there are 6 to 10 
million lead service lines serving up to 
22 million Americans, affecting Ameri-
cans living in all 50 states, Washington, 
D.C., and Puerto Rico. The only way to 
guarantee lead-free drinking water is 
to remove and replace every lead pipe 
and service line in America—and that’s 
precisely what this legislation calls 
for. 
The Lead-Free Drinking Water for 
All Act would reauthorize EPA’s lead 
reduction projects grant program and 
increase the authorization to $4.5 bil-
lion per year for 10 years. It would 
prioritize disadvantaged communities 
and set a ten-year deadline for projects 
to complete the lead service line re-
moval. It would also guarantee that 
funded projects pay a prevailing wage. 
Epidemiologic studies have consist-
ently demonstrated that there is no 
safe level of exposure to lead. Accord-
ing to the EPA, lead is particularly 
harmful for young children: low levels 
of exposure have been linked to dam-
age to the central and peripheral nerv-
ous system, learning disabilities, im-
paired hearing, impaired physical de-
velopment, and impaired formation 
and function of blood cells. EPA has 
set the maximum contaminant level 
goal for lead in drinking water at zero 
because lead can be harmful to human 
health, even at low exposure levels. 
This problem is particularly preva-
lent in California’s Central Valley, 
where, for example, in 2017 approxi-
mately 25 percent of schools in Fresno 
County reported lead in their drinking 
water while statewide, almost 1 in 5 
kids attended a school that served 
drinking water with lead contamina-
tion. 
The Lead-Free Drinking Water for 
All Act would protect public health by 
guaranteeing that all Americans have 
access to lead-free drinking water. By 
providing 
funding 
for 
grants 
and 
prioritizing 
disadvantaged 
commu-
nities, this legislation would also re-
duce disparities in access to clean 
water and ensure that the burden of 
paying for lead service line replace-
ment does not fall on disadvantaged 
communities. 
I thank my co-lead, Senator STABE-
NOW, for her tireless leadership fighting 
for clean water for her constituents in 
Michigan and all Americans. I also 
thank the cosponsors of this bill for 
championing this vital effort with us in 
the Senate. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to enact the ‘‘Lead-Free 
Drinking Water for All Act’’ as quickly 
as possible. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Drug-Price 
Transparency for Competition Act of 2021’’ 
or the ‘‘DTC Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE SENATE. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Direct-to-consumer advertising of pre-
scription pharmaceuticals is legally per-
mitted in only 2 developed countries, the 
United States and New Zealand. 
(2) In 2018, pharmaceutical ad spending ex-
ceeded $6,046,000,000, a 4.8 percent increase 
over 2017, resulting in the average American 
seeing 9 drug advertisements per day. 
(3) The most commonly advertised medica-
tion in the United States has a list price of 
more than $6,000 for a one-month’s supply. 
(4) A 2021 Government Accountability Of-
fice report found that two-thirds of all di-
rect-to-consumer drug advertising between 
2016 and 2018 was concentrated among 39 
brand-name drugs or biological products, 
about half of which were recently approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration. 
(5) According to a 2011 Congressional Budg-
et Office report, pharmaceutical manufactur-
ers advertise their products directly to con-
sumers in an attempt to boost demand for 
their products and thereby raise the price 
that consumers are willing to pay, increase 
the quantity of drugs sold, or achieve some 
combination of the two. 
(6) Studies, including a 2012 systematic re-
view published in the Annual Review of Pub-
lic Health, a 2005 randomized trial published 
in the Journal of the American Medical As-
sociation, and a 2004 survey published in 
Health Affairs, show that patients are more 
likely to ask their doctor for a specific medi-
cation and for the doctor to write a prescrip-
tion for it, if a patient has seen an advertise-
ment for such medication, even if such medi-
cation is not the most clinically appropriate 
for the patient or if a lower-cost generic 
medication may be available. 
(7) According to a 2011 Congressional Budg-
et Office report, the average number of pre-
scriptions written for newly approved brand- 
name drugs with direct-to-consumer adver-
tising was 9 times greater than the average 
number of prescriptions written for newly 
approved brand-name drugs without direct- 
to-consumer advertising. 
(8) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services is the single largest drug payer in 
the United States. Between 2016 and 2018, 58 
percent of the $560,000,000,000 in Medicare 
drug spending was for advertised drugs, and 
in 2018 alone, the 20 most advertised drugs on 
television cost Medicare and Medicaid a 
combined $34,000,000,000. 
(9) A 2021 Government Accountability Of-
fice report found that direct-to-consumer ad-
vertising may have contributed to increases 
in Medicare beneficiary use and spending 
among certain drugs. 
(10) The American Medical Association has 
passed resolutions supporting the require-
ment for price transparency in any direct-to- 
consumer advertising, stating that such ad-
vertisements on their own ‘‘inflate demand 
for new and more expensive drugs, even when 
these drugs may not be appropriate’’. 
(11) A 2019 study published in the Journal 
of the American Medical Association found 
that health care consumers dramatically un-
derestimate their out-of-pocket costs for cer-
tain expensive medications, but once they 
learn the wholesale acquisition cost (in this 
section referred to as the ‘‘WAC’’) of the 
product, they are far better able to approxi-
mate their out-of-pocket costs. 
(12) Approximately half of Americans have 
high-deductible health plans, under which 
they often pay the list price of a drug until 
their insurance deductible is met. All of the 
top Medicare prescription drug plans use co-
insurance rather than fixed-dollar copay-
ments for medications on nonpreferred drug 
tiers, exposing beneficiaries to WAC prices. 
(13) Section 119 of division CC of the Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public 
Law 116–260) requires the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services to increase the use of 
real-time benefit tools to lower beneficiary 
costs. However, there still remains a lack of 
available pricing tools so patients may not 
learn of their medication’s cost until after 
being given a prescription for the medica-
tion. 
A 
2013 
study 
published 
in 
The 
Oncologist found that one-quarter of all can-
cer patients chose not to fill a prescription 
due to cost. 
(14) The Federal Government already exer-
cises its authority to oversee certain aspects 
of direct-to-consumer drug advertising, in-
cluding required disclosures of information 
related to side effects, contraindications, 
and effectiveness. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) a lack of transparency in pricing for 
pharmaceuticals has led to a lack of com-
petition for such pharmaceuticals, as evi-
denced by a finding by the Department of 
Health and Human Services that ‘‘Con-
sumers of pharmaceuticals are currently 
missing information that consumers of other 
products can more readily access, namely 
the list price of the product, which acts as a 
point of comparison when judging the rea-
sonableness of prices offered for potential 
substitute products’’ (84 Fed. Reg. 20735); 
(2) in an age where price information is 
ubiquitous, the prices of pharmaceuticals re-
main shrouded in secrecy and limited to 
those who subscribe to expensive drug price 
reporting services, which typically include 
pharmaceutical 
manufacturers 
or 
other 
health care industry entities and not the 
general public; 
(3) greater insight and transparency into 
drug prices will help consumers know if they 
can afford to complete a course of therapy 
before deciding to initiate that course of 
therapy; 
(4) price shopping is the mark of rational 
economic behavior, and markets operate 
more efficiently when consumers have rel-
evant information about a product, including

its price, before making an informed decision 
about whether to buy that product; 
(5) providing consumers with basic price 
information may result in the selection of 
lesser cost alternatives, all else being equal 
relative to the patient’s care, and is integral 
to providing adequate competition in the 
market; 
(6) the WAC is a factual, objective, and 
uncontroversial definition for the list price 
of a medication, in that it is defined in stat-
ute, reflects an understood place in the sup-
ply chain, and is at the sole discretion of the 
manufacturer to set; 
(7) there is a governmental interest in en-
suring that consumers who seek to purchase 
pharmaceuticals for purposes of promoting 
their health and safety understand the objec-
tive list price of any pharmaceutical that 
they are encouraged through advertisements 
to purchase, which allows consumers to 
make informed purchasing decisions; and 
(8) there is a governmental interest in 
mitigating wasteful expenditures and pro-
moting the efficient administration of the 
Medicare program by slowing the growth of 
Federal spending on prescription drugs. 
SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT THAT DIRECT-TO-CON-
SUMER ADVERTISEMENTS FOR PRE-
SCRIPTION DRUGS AND BIOLOGICAL 
PRODUCTS 
INCLUDE 
AN 
APPRO-
PRIATE DISCLOSURE OF PRICING IN-

Part A of title XI of the Social Security 
Act is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing new section: 
‘‘SEC. 1150D. REQUIREMENT THAT DIRECT-TO- 
CONSUMER ADVERTISEMENTS FOR 
PRESCRIPTION 
DRUGS 
AND 
BIO-
LOGICAL PRODUCTS INCLUDE AN 
APPROPRIATE

OF 
PRICING INFORMATION. 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall re-
quire that each direct-to-consumer adver-
tisement for a prescription drug or biological

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 284—RECOG-
NIZING THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
INDIANA 
VETERANS’ 
HOME 
Mr. BRAUN (for himself and Mr. 
YOUNG) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 284 
Whereas Indiana has a proud tradition of 
honoring its veterans and those who serve 
our country; 
Whereas 3 out of 4 Hoosiers of eligible age 
served in the Civil War; 
Whereas 1 out of every 10 Union Army sol-
diers enlisted from Indiana, and only 1 State, 
Delaware, provided more soldiers in the Civil 
War based on per capita population than In-
diana; 
Whereas the Soldiers and Sailors Monu-
ment is located in the center of Indianapolis 
and the State of Indiana, and when it was 
dedicated in 1902, the only monument taller 
in the United States was the Washington 
Monument; 
Whereas, in 1886, at the annual encamp-
ment of the Department of Indiana Grand 
Army of the Republic (‘‘G.A.R.’’) held in In-
dianapolis, Indiana, Department Commander 
David N. Foster urged the G.A.R. to estab-
lish a State soldiers’ home in Indiana to care 
for the disabled Union Veteran Soldiers; 
Whereas intensive lobbying by the G.A.R. 
resulted in the Indiana General Assembly of 
1888 resolving to found a home for veterans, 
and in 1890, work toward the home began; 
Whereas a committee was founded to find a 
suitable location for the home, with a mem-
ber-at-large and 1 member from each con-
gressional 
district, 
including 
James 
R. 
Carnahan (at large), W.H. Tucker, David N. 
Foster, C.J. Murphy, D.F. Spees, Andrew 
Fite, H.B. Martin, U.D. Cole, A.O. Marsh, 
C.M. Travis, W.S. Haggard, D.B. McConnell, 
Jacob J. Todd, and Jasper E. Lewis; 
Whereas, in the summer of 1892, the com-
mittee decided to formally recommend 187 
wooded acres in Lafayette, Indiana, as the 
location of the Indiana State Soldiers’ Home 
(also known as the ‘‘Indiana Veterans’ 
Home’’) (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘Home’’); 
Whereas the City of Lafayette and the 
County of Tippecanoe agreed to donate 200 
acres of ground and $5,633 for the Home; 
Whereas General Richard P. DeHart, a 
local veteran and business man, donated a 
2,000 foot strip of riverfront property, which 
is now known as the Tecumseh Trails Park, 
to the Home; 
Whereas the committee, having secured a 
location, prepared a bill to be presented to 
the Indiana General Assembly for the estab-
lishment and maintenance of the Home; 
Whereas, due to lack of time, the bill failed 
to pass the Indiana Senate, but in 1895, the 
Indiana 
General 
Assembly 
unanimously 
passed a bill to create the Home and appro-
priated $75,000 for its buildings; 
Whereas, on February 23, 1895, Governor 
Claude Matthews signed the bill, and it be-
came law; 
Whereas the Governor appointed 5 men as 
the first Board of Trustees of the Home to 
work without compensation other than their 
actual traveling expenses; 
Whereas the Indiana General Assembly ap-
propriated $61,723.61 to be used in building an 
old men’s home, a chapel, and an addition to 
the dining room, constructing sewers, fur-
nishing the different buildings, graveling 
streets, roads, and sidewalks, and purchasing 
a pump, a dynamo, and a fire apparatus; 
Whereas, by 1900, numerous buildings had 
been erected for the use of the residents of 
the Home, and the applications for residence 
at the Home were far greater than its facili-
ties were capable of handling; 
Whereas, on October 31, 1900, there were 9 
State buildings, 39 county cottages, 5 cot-
tages built by the G.A.R., 1 cottage built by 
the 
Woman’s 
Relief 
Corps 
of 
Indiana 
(‘‘W.R.C.’’), 1 cottage each built by the John 
A. Logan and Marsh B. Taylor W.R.C. of La-
fayette, and 1 cottage built by the John A. 
Logan Circle, Ladies of the Grand Army of 
the Republic of Lafayette; 
Whereas, in addition to these buildings, 
the Home built a public restaurant, Com-
mandant’s home, Surgeon’s cottage, and 
combination carpenter and paint shop; 
Whereas, in addition to the sums donated 
for the buildings, the W.R.C. and Ladies of 
the 
G.A.R. 
throughout 
the 
State 
gave 
$1,326.25 to furnish rooms and cottages in the 
Home; 
Whereas, in his written history of Tippe-
canoe County from 1909, General Richard P. 
DeHart wrote of the Home, ‘‘If one ever 
doubted that America appreciates and cares 
for her defenders, a visit to this beauty spot 
of Indiana will convince them that not only 
in times of peril and war does she care for 
her brave soldiery, but that now after forty 
years have come and gone, she still seeks to 
show these old and infirm men that she wish-
es them all the peace and comfort possible to 
provide for them, at any cost.’’; 
Whereas peak census was reached in the 
1910s when the Home housed over 1,400 resi-
dents and another 200 staff members; 
Whereas the Home operated as its own lit-
tle town, complete with a hospital, electric 
light plant, bakery, fire department, and an 
assembly hall with a seating capacity for 600 
people; 
Whereas census in the 1920s had declined to 
the average number of residents numbering 
in the 1,000s; 
Whereas this state of affairs continued, 
and, by 1950, it was apparent that the Home 
needed a major revamping; 
Whereas this revamping resulted in the de-
struction of almost all of the original build-
ings, and today only 5 structures remain 
from the earlier years of the Home, including 
the Commandant’s home, the Administra-
tion Building, the Lawrie Library, the bus 
station, and the cemetery chapel; 
Whereas 9 acres of the Home’s land were 
listed in National Register of Historic Places 
in 1974, including 4 original buildings—the 
Commandant’s home, the library, the Ad-
ministration Building, and the post ex-
change; 
Whereas, in addition, a collection of ap-
proximately 165 oil portraits and charcoal 
drawings of Civil War generals and impor-
tant political figures, painted by Captain 
Alexander Lawrie, are housed in the library 
and add a major cultural dimension to the 
Home; 
Whereas, in 1974, the Home became a li-
censed healthcare facility; 
Whereas, on June 4, 1976, the Home’s name 
was officially changed from the Indiana 
State Soldiers’ Home to the Indiana Vet-
erans’ Home, and the title of the chief ad-
ministrator was changed from Commandant 
to Superintendent; 
Whereas, in 1976, the construction of Ernie 
Pyle Hall, MacArthur Hall, and Mitchell Hall 
began and continued until completion in 
1982; 
Whereas, in 2009, the Commandant’s Row 
buildings were placed under the authority of 
the Indiana Department of Veterans Affairs 
and the Home; 
Whereas census has declined over the dec-
ades as Civil War veterans passed, but the 
Home has averaged 200 residents annually,

ranging between 120 to 265 residents from the 
1970s to the present; 
Whereas the Home is operated by the State 
of Indiana to care for honorably discharged 
Indiana veterans and their spouses and Gold 
Star parents; 
Whereas there is no wartime service re-
quirement in order to be eligible to apply for 
admission to the Home, and the Home ac-
cepts all periods of service; 
Whereas the Home is a full-service care fa-
cility, offering a complete array of on-site 
services for its residents; 
Whereas the Home currently boasts a 
small museum of historical artifacts related 
to various wars, as well as artifacts from the 
Home’s history; 
Whereas the Home provides quality care 
for veterans, their spouses, and Gold Star 
parents; 
Whereas there are currently 3,000 graves in 
the Home’s cemetery, which serves as the 
final resting place for its residents and their 
spouses who chose internment there; and 
Whereas the Home has played a vital role 
in assisting Hoosier Veterans and their fami-
lies in their time of need: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the Indiana Veterans’ Home has been, 
and continues to be, an example of Hoosiers’ 
dedication to their veterans, especially those 
who served in the Civil War; 
(2) the Indiana Veterans’ Home, along with 
the other State-owned and managed war me-
morials throughout Indianapolis and Indi-
ana, including the Soldiers and Sailors 
Monument, highlights Hoosiers’ appreciation 
for the service of its veterans; 
(3) the Indiana Veterans’ Home continues a 
strong tradition of providing care to Hoosier 
veterans at the beautiful property located in 
Tippecanoe County, Indiana, and offering a 
historical glimpse into the past with its mu-
seum and the notable nearby physical loca-
tions; and 
(4) the Indiana Veterans’ Home should be 
recognized for its 125 years of care to the vet-
erans of Indiana and their families at this 
beautiful and historically significant prop-
erty in the State.

285—HON-
ORING 
THE 
LIVES 
AND 
LEG-
ACIES OF THE ‘‘RADIUM GIRLS’’ 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
BOOKER, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. MUR-
PHY, Mr. DURBIN, and Ms. DUCKWORTH) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 285 
Whereas Marie and Pierre Curie discovered 
radium in 1898, sparking a craze for radium- 
infused consumer goods in the early 20th 
century; 
Whereas 
many 
entrepreneurs 
touted 
radium’s supposedly limitless curative prop-
erties, even as some scientists began to re-
port serious health hazards associated with 
the element; 
Whereas the ‘‘Radium Girls’’ were teen-
aged girls and young women who, starting in 
1917, worked in United States factories 
painting watch dials and airplane instru-
ments using glow-in-the-dark, radium-in-
fused paint; 
Whereas the early Radium Girls painted 
watches and instruments that United States 
troops relied on during World War I; 
Whereas the majority of the Radium Girls 
worked for corporations located in Orange, 
New Jersey, Ottawa, Illinois, and Waterbury, 
Connecticut; 
Whereas the Radium Girls primarily came 
from working-class backgrounds and some 
were first- and second-generation Americans; 
Whereas, in several instances, the radium 
corporations’ leadership knew that the ele-
ment could be harmful to human health, but 
they did not inform the Radium Girls of the 
risks or implement basic safety standards; 
Whereas, in many cases, the radium cor-
porations’ management encouraged the Ra-
dium Girls to keep their paintbrush tips 
moist and as fine as possible by putting the 
paint-covered brushes between their lips, a 
technique known as ‘‘lip-pointing’’; 
Whereas, due to lip-pointing, many of the 
early 
Radium 
Girls 
ingested 
extremely 
harmful quantities of radium; 
Whereas the Radium Girls breathed in ra-
dium-infused dust and touched radium-in-
fused paint, and they often glowed by the 
end of the workday due to the radioactive 
paint on their clothes and skin; 
Whereas many of the Radium Girls began 
to experience mysterious health problems, 
including necrosis (rotting) of the jaw, can-
cer, anemia, bone fractures, and infertility; 
Whereas many of the Radium Girls were 
eventually plagued by debilitating physical 
pain and severe disabilities; 
Whereas an unknown number of the ap-
proximately 4,000 Radium Girls died pre-
maturely or experienced the devastating 
health effects of radium poisoning; 
Whereas some physicians and dentists ini-
tially dismissed the Radium Girls’ hypoth-
esis that their illnesses were linked to their 
occupations; 
Whereas, in some cases, the radium cor-
porations conspired with members of the 
medical community to conceal the origins of 
the Radium Girls’ illnesses and smear their 
reputations; 
Whereas a number of the Radium Girls, in 
different States, fought to secure justice for 
themselves, their families, and their col-
leagues by suing the radium corporations; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ difficult and 
prolonged legal battles and often horrific 
medical conditions drew national attention; 
Whereas some of the Radium Girls who 
challenged the radium corporations were 
shunned by their communities for harming 
the reputation of a prominent local em-
ployer; 
Whereas many of the surviving Radium 
Girls volunteered to participate in scientific 
studies on the effects of radium on the 
human body; 
Whereas investigations of the Radium 
Girls’ illnesses led to the creation of the new 
scientific field of human radiobiology; 
Whereas the Federal Government relied on 
data from the Radium Girls’ cases to develop 
safety standards for radium and other radio-
active materials for factory workers, med-
ical personnel, and scientists, including the 
workers and scientists of the Manhattan 
Project; 
Whereas some of the Radium Girls and 
their families received either no compensa-
tion or only meager compensation related to 
their harmful exposure to radium and their 
contributions to science; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ highly pub-
licized case was among the first in which the 
courts held an employer responsible for the 
safety and health of its workers; 
Whereas the Radium Girls’ struggle for 
justice was a turning point in the movement 
to protect workers’ safety and ultimately 
spurred Congress to enact critical occupa-
tional health reforms; and 
Whereas many workers in the United 
States today are still fighting for a safe and 
equitable workplace: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the Radium Girls and their de-
termination to seek justice in the face of 
overwhelming obstacles; 
(2) recognizes the invaluable contributions 
of the Radium Girls to developing modern 
workplace safety laws and standards; and 
(3) reaffirms the commitment of the Fed-
eral Government to protecting the health 
and safety of all workers in the United 
States.

SENATE RESOLUTION 286—URGING 
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO 
WORK WITH CONGRESS TO EN-
SURE THAT THE UNITED STATES 
MILITARY HAS SUFFICIENT RE-
SOURCES 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, 
Mr. WICKER, Mr. CORNYN, Mr. COTTON, 
and Mr. SULLIVAN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Armed Services: 
S. RES. 286 
Whereas the United States faces numerous 
national security threats from around the 
world, including from the People’s Republic 
of China, the Russian Federation, the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic Re-
public of Korea, and international terrorist 
and crime networks aided by United States 
enemies, such as the Republic of Cuba and 
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela; 
Whereas the United States is engaged in a 
new Cold War with the People’s Republic of 
China, which is— 
(1) building up its military to defeat the 
United States; 
(2) stealing United States intellectual 
property and jobs; 
(3) harassing neighboring Asian countries 
and United States allies and partners; 
(4) 
committing 
genocide 
against 
the 
Uyghurs; and 
(5) denying basic rights to the people of 
Hong Kong; 
Whereas the People’s Republic of China is 
focused on world domination through oppres-
sion and communist rule; 
Whereas, according to prominent research 
institutions, including the Center for Stra-
tegic and International Studies and the 
Stockholm International Peace Research In-
stitute, the Chinese Communist Party has 
increased its defense spending more than 700 
percent during the last decade, with an addi-
tional 6.8 percent increase anticipated in the 
current fiscal year; 
Whereas security and foreign policy ex-
perts widely acknowledge that— 
(1) the People’s Republic of China is not 
forthcoming or transparent with information 
related to military spending; and 
(2) China’s military spending may be con-
siderably higher than its reported figures; 
Whereas the National Defense Strategy 
Commission, in its report, Providing for the 
Common Defense: The Assessment and Rec-
ommendation of the States, recommended, in 
accordance with the testimony of Secretary 
Mattis and Chairman Dunford in 2017, that 
‘‘Congress increase the base defense budget 
at an average rate of three to five percent 
above inflation through the Future Years 
Defense Program and perhaps beyond’’; 
Whereas, when considering the inflation 
crisis he has created, President Biden’s pro-
posed defense budget would be insufficient to 
address— 
(1) new and mounting threats to United 
States national security and to our allies; 
and 
(2) the need for sufficient military support 
to deter our enemies and maintain the most 
lethal fighting force in the world;

June 24, 2021 
Whereas President Biden’s proposed budget 
request includes $715,000,000,000 for the De-
partment of Defense, which is well below the 
funding needed to keep pace with inflation, 
while the President’s nondefense discre-
tionary spending request represents an in-
crease of almost 20 percent compared to the 
current fiscal year; 
Whereas, in the Department of Defense’s 
fiscal year 2021 Future Years Defense Pro-
gram, the projected request for the Depart-
ment of Defense in fiscal year 2022 was tar-
geted at $722,000,000,000, which is $7,000,000,000 
higher than President Biden’s actual defense 
budget request for fiscal year 2022; 
Whereas President Biden’s defense budg-
et— 
(1) does not provide adequate resources to 
deter or defeat United States enemies; 
(2) does not even keep up with inflation; 
and 
(3) does not restore our military readiness 
that was diminished by budget cuts and the 
sequester under President Barack Obama, 
which arbitrarily reduced defense spending 
across the board; 
Whereas the lack of sufficient funding will 
require the Department of Defense to choose 
between— 
(1) 
providing 
for 
United 
States 
servicemembers’ compensation and benefits; 
(2) providing for United States forces’ mod-
ernization and readiness needs; and 
(3) any other priorities that the Biden Ad-
ministration chooses to pursue; and 
Whereas President Biden’s level of defense 
spending— 
(1) harms the United States’ long-term 
strategic competition against the People’s 
Republic of China and other adversaries; and 
(2) weakens our standing on the global 
stage: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate urges the Biden 
Administration to work with Congress to en-
sure that the United States military has all 
the necessary resources to build and sustain 
the overwhelming military might that the 
United States expects and deserves.

RESOLUTION 
288—COM-
MEMORATING THE TENTH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE SOURIS RIVER 
FLOOD IN MINOT, NORTH DA-
KOTA 
Mr. HOEVEN (for himself and Mr. 
CRAMER) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 288 
Whereas, in late June 2011, the city of 
Minot, North Dakota, and surrounding com-
munities were inundated by widespread 
flooding; 
Whereas high soil moisture content, above- 
average snow pack, and persistent spring and 
summer precipitation produced record-level 
flooding throughout the Souris River Basin; 
Whereas, in June 2011, the Saskatchewan 
Watershed Authority informed communities 
downstream that ‘‘reservoirs [had] no capac-
ity to store further inflows’’; 
Whereas, on June 22, 2011, following contin-
ued releases from upstream reservoirs, water 
began to overtop levees in the city of Minot, 
resulting in a mandatory evacuation and the 
displacement of 11,000 Minot residents; 
Whereas nearly 11,500 acres in Ward Coun-
ty were covered in 2 to 15 feet of water, im-
pacting nearly 4,800 structures; 
Whereas the river’s flow peaked at 27,000 
cubic feet per second, resulting in almost as 
much water moving through Minot in June 
2011 as in the entire year of 1976, which was 
the previous all-time annual flow record; 
Whereas, on June 26, 2011, the river crested 
at 1,561.72 feet above sea level, a Minot 
record; 
Whereas the floodwater destroyed 4,100 
homes, 250 businesses, and numerous schools, 
parks, churches, and other public infrastruc-
ture at a cost of as much as $1,000,000,000; 
Whereas floodwater created national secu-
rity concerns by temporarily blocking access 
to some intercontinental ballistic missile fa-
cilities operated by personnel at Minot Air 
Force Base; 
Whereas the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency provided more than 1,500 tem-
porary housing units to address the agency’s 
third largest housing mission in its history 
to date; 
Whereas the people of Minot and sur-
rounding communities demonstrated resil-
ience and worked together to help their fel-
low neighbors in a time of need; 
Whereas Federal, State, and local officials 
and agencies coordinated to provide imme-
diate recovery assistance; 
Whereas Congress provided hundreds of 
millions of dollars in disaster relief and re-
covery funding to assist the city of Minot 
and the surrounding region; 
Whereas the people of Minot and sur-
rounding communities continue to deal with 
the effects of the flood, including efforts to 
construct permanent flood protection in the 
Minot area; and 
Whereas 2021 marks the tenth anniversary 
of the Souris River flood in Minot, North Da-
kota: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the tenth anniversary of 
the Souris River flood in Minot, North Da-
kota; 
(2) expresses sympathy to people in the 
Souris River Basin and condolences to the 
families who lost their homes or businesses; 
(3) commends the resilience of the people 
in the Souris River Basin and their commit-
ment to recovery and rebuilding; and 
(4) expresses gratitude and appreciation to 
State and local leaders, first responders, and 
the North Dakota National Guard for pro-
tecting the people of the Souris River Basin.

Mr. KELLY, Mr. HOEVEN, Ms. STABENOW, 
Mr. TUBERVILLE, Mr. LEAHY, Mrs. CAP-
ITO, Mr. CASSIDY, and Mrs. BLACKBURN) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 289 
Whereas the brave men and women of the 
Armed Forces, who proudly serve the United 
States— 
(1) risk their lives to protect the freedom, 
health, and welfare of the people of the 
United States; and 
(2) deserve the investment of every pos-
sible resource to ensure their lasting phys-
ical, mental, and emotional well-being; 
Whereas, since the events of September 11, 
2001, nearly 2,800,000 members of the Armed 
Forces have deployed overseas and served in 
places such as Afghanistan and Iraq; 
Whereas the current generation of men and 
women in the Armed Forces has sustained a 
high rate of operational deployments, with 
many members of the Armed Forces serving 
overseas multiple times, placing those mem-
bers at high risk of enduring traumatic com-
bat stress; 
Whereas, when left untreated, exposure to 
traumatic combat stress can lead to severe 
and chronic post-traumatic stress responses, 
which are commonly referred to as post- 
traumatic stress disorder (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘PTSD’’) or post-traumatic 
stress injury; 
Whereas many men and women of the 
Armed Forces and veterans who served be-
fore September 11, 2001, live with mental 
health needs from post-traumatic stress and 
remain at risk for responses to that stress; 
Whereas many post-traumatic stress re-
sponses remain unreported, undiagnosed, and 
untreated due to a lack of awareness about 
post-traumatic stress and the persistent 
stigma associated with mental health condi-
tions; 
Whereas 
post-traumatic 
stress 
signifi-
cantly increases the risk of post-traumatic 
stress responses, including anxiety, depres-
sion, homelessness, substance abuse, and sui-
cide, especially if left untreated; 
Whereas the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
reports that— 
(1) between 11 and 20 percent of veterans 
who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom or 
Operation Enduring Freedom have post-trau-
matic stress in a given year; 
(2) approximately 12 percent of veterans 
who served in the Persian Gulf War have 
post-traumatic stress in a given year; and 
(3) approximately 30 percent of veterans 
who served in the Vietnam era have had 
post-traumatic stress in their lifetimes; 
Whereas public perceptions of post-trau-
matic stress as a mental health disorder cre-
ate unique challenges for veterans seeking 
employment; 
Whereas the Department of Defense, the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans 
service organizations, and the private and 
public medical community have made sig-
nificant advances in the identification, pre-
vention, diagnosis, and treatment of post- 
traumatic stress and the symptoms of post- 
traumatic stress, but many challenges re-
main;

June 24, 2021 
Whereas increased understanding of post- 
traumatic stress can help eliminate stigma 
attached to the mental health issues of post- 
traumatic stress; 
Whereas additional efforts are needed to 
find further ways to eliminate the stigma as-
sociated with post-traumatic stress, includ-
ing— 
(1) an examination of how post-traumatic 
stress is discussed in the United States; and 
(2) a recognition that post-traumatic stress 
is a common injury that is treatable; 
Whereas timely and appropriate treatment 
of post-traumatic stress responses can di-
minish complications and avert suicides; 
Whereas post-traumatic stress— 
(1) can result from any number of stressors 
other than combat, including rape, sexual as-
sault, battery, torture, confinement, child 
abuse, car accidents, train wrecks, plane 
crashes, bombings, natural disasters, or glob-
al pandemics; and 
(2) affects approximately 8,000,000 adults in 
the United States annually; 
Whereas traumatic events such as the 
COVID–19 pandemic could— 
(1) increase the number of individuals im-
pacted by post-traumatic stress; or 
(2) exacerbate the responses of post-trau-
matic stress; 
Whereas the diagnosis of PTSD was first 
defined by the American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation in 1980 to commonly and more accu-
rately understand and treat survivors of 
physical and psychological trauma, includ-
ing veterans who had endured severe trau-
matic combat stress; 
Whereas the word ‘‘disorder’’ can perpet-
uate the stigma associated with combat 
stress, so the more general term ‘‘post-trau-
matic stress’’ is often preferred; and 
Whereas the designation of a National 
Post-Traumatic Stress Awareness Month and 
a National Post-Traumatic Stress Awareness 
Day raises public awareness about issues re-
lating to post-traumatic stress, reduces the 
stigma 
associated 
with 
post-traumatic 
stress, and helps ensure that individuals suf-
fering from the invisible wounds of war re-
ceive proper treatment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates— 
(A) June 2021 as ‘‘National Post-Traumatic 
Stress Awareness Month’’; and 
(B) June 27, 2021, as ‘‘National Post-Trau-
matic Stress Awareness Day’’; 
(2) supports the efforts of the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Defense, 
and the entire medical community to edu-
cate members of the Armed Forces, veterans, 
the families of members of the Armed Forces 
and veterans, and the public about the 
causes, symptoms, and treatment of post- 
traumatic stress; 
(3) supports efforts by the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of De-
fense to foster— 
(A) cultural change around the issue of 
post-traumatic stress; and 
(B) understanding that personal inter-
actions can save lives and advance treat-
ment; 
(4) welcomes the efforts of the National 
Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs and local 
Vet Centers (as defined in section 1712A(h) of 
title 38, United States Code) to provide as-
sistance to veterans who are suffering from 
the effects of post-traumatic stress; 
(5) encourages the leadership of the Armed 
Forces to support appropriate treatment of 
men and women of the Armed Forces who 
suffer from post-traumatic stress; 
(6) recognizes the impact of post-traumatic 
stress on the spouses and families of mem-
bers of the Armed Forces and veterans; and 
(7) respectfully requests that the Secretary 
of the Senate transmit a copy of this resolu-
tion to— 
(A) the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; and 
(B) the Secretary of Defense.

S. RES. 290 
Whereas individuals in the United States 
have sacrificed immensely since the begin-

avoiding travel to see friends and family; 
Whereas science shows that individuals 
fully vaccinated against COVID–19 are pro-

thus very unlikely to spread the disease; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention updated its guidance relating 
to mask wearing in confined places for fully 
vaccinated individuals, allowing individuals 
to no longer wear a mask in such instances; 
Whereas extending this mask guidance to 
allow fully vaccinated individuals to travel 
on public transportation networks through-
out the United States, including through 
commercial aviation, without the need to 
wear a mask would be instrumental in help-
ing the economic recovery of the United

Mr. TESTER (for himself and Mr.

S. RES. 292

Whereas the Senate recognizes the effect

Whereas automobiles have provided the in-
spiration for music, photography, cinema, 
fashion, and other artistic pursuits that have

Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 9, 2021, as ‘‘Collector 
Car Appreciation Day’’; 
(2) recognizes that the collection and res-
toration of historic and classic cars is an im-
portant part of preserving the technological 
achievements and cultural heritage of the 
United States; 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to engage in events and commemora-
tions of Collector Car Appreciation Day in 
accordance with public health guidelines; 
and 
(4) recognizes that Collector Car Apprecia-
tion Day events and commemorations create 
opportunities for collector car owners to 
educate young people about the importance 
of preserving the cultural heritage of the 
United States, including through the collec-

DUCKWORTH, Mr. PADILLA, Mr. LUJA´ N, 
and Ms. HIRONO) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 294 
Whereas the United States is stronger 
when all individuals have the opportunity to 
live up to their full potential; 
Whereas about 15 percent of health care 
workers in the United States are immi-
grants, including (in order of highest per-
centage of health care workers who are for-
eign born)— 
(1) 29 percent of physicians; 
(2) 25 percent of nursing, psychiatric, and 
home health aides; 
(3) 24 percent of dentists; 
(4) 20 percent of pharmacists;

(8) 15 percent of licensed practical and li-
censed vocational nurses; 
(9) 12 percent of dieticians and nutrition-
ists; and 
(10) 12 percent of optometrists; 
Whereas immigrants working in a health 
care occupation range from those granted 
temporary protected status under section 244 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1254a) or deferred action pursuant to 
the memorandum of the Department of 
Homeland 
Security 
entitled 
‘‘Exercising 
Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to In-
dividuals Who Came to the United States as 
Children’’ issued on June 15, 2012, (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘DACA’’) to naturalized 
United States citizens; 
Whereas more than 12 percent of such im-
migrants (310,000 individuals) are humani-
tarian migrants, including refugees, asylees, 
special immigrant visa holders, and Cuban 
and Haitian entrants; 
Whereas 50,000 DACA recipients perform 
critical roles in the health care industry; 
Whereas immigrants working in health 
care professions serve throughout the United 
States, and often in rural or underserved 
communities; 
Whereas the medical students, residents, 
and physicians who rely on DACA for their 
ability to practice medicine provide medical 
care to approximately 4,600 patients a year; 
Whereas immigrants have filled approxi-
mately 1⁄3 of physician roles in the United 
States each year for the 10 years prior to 
2021; 
Whereas the Association of American Med-
ical Colleges attested to the Supreme Court 
that the health care system of the United 
States relies on immigrant health care pro-
viders; 
Whereas, in response to COVID–19, immi-
grants are putting their own lives on the line 
to save lives every day, working as diag-
nostic and treatment practitioners, physi-
cian assistants, physicians, nurses, health 
aides, 
nursing 
assistants 
and 
orderlies, 
health care support workers, medical stu-
dents and residents, and health technologists 
and technicians; 
Whereas more than 5,200,000 undocumented 
immigrants, including more than 1⁄2 of all 
DACA recipients (400,000 individuals) and the 
majority of Temporary Protected Status 
holders (more than 220,000 individuals) are 
considered essential critical infrastructure 
workers; 
Whereas immigrant essential workers, in-
cluding first-responders, health care work-
ers, agricultural workers and meat packers, 
child care providers, and hospitality and 
transportation 
workers, 
have 
heroically 
helped provide medical care, food, shelter, 
and comfort to the people of the United 
States impacted by COVID–19; 
Whereas undocumented immigrants alone 
contribute an estimated $228,000,000,000 of 
spending power annually to the United 
States economy, after the payment of 
$49,000,000,000 of combined Federal, State, 
and local taxes each year; 
Whereas the majority of farm workers in 
the United States are immigrants, and re-
gardless of politics, have been deemed ‘‘es-
sential workers’’ in order to maintain a safe 
food supply for the United States during the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas immigrants have served in the 
Armed Forces since the founding of the 
United States, and have fought in every 
major conflict in the history of the United 
States, including the Civil War, World Wars 
I and II, and conflicts in Vietnam, Afghani-
stan, and Iraq; 
Whereas immigrants have put their lives 
on the line to protect the ideals of the 
United States and democracy, as well as 
lives of the people of the United States, by 
serving as translators and interpreters for 
the Armed Forces, and performing sensitive 
and trusted activities for United States mili-
tary personnel stationed with the Inter-
national Security Assistance Force; 
Whereas immigrants who serve in emerg-
ing industries with pronounced labor short-
ages in the United States, such as artificial 
intelligence, that rely on science, tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘STEM’’) skills, 
not only bolster the economy but also en-
hance national security and global leader-
ship; 
Whereas when immigrants have a trusting 
relationship with local law enforcement, 
they have reported crime and have worked 
with police on neighborhood crime reduction 
strategies; 
Whereas more immigrants reside in the 
United States than any other country in the 
world and represent almost every country in 
the world, contributing to the rich diversity 
in the United States of people, cultures, cui-
sine, literature, art, language, academia, 
music, media, fashion, and customs; 
Whereas the United States is more diverse 
than ever before in its history, with greater 
shares of immigrants from countries such as 
India, China (including those born in Hong 
Kong and Macao, but not Taiwan), the Phil-
ippines, El Salvador, Vietnam, Cuba, the Do-
minican Republic, South Korea, and Guate-
mala, and an increase of 79 percent since 2000 
of Black immigrants from across the African 
continent, the Caribbean, Jamaica, and 
Haiti; 
Whereas Black immigrants and their chil-
dren make up roughly 1⁄5 of the overall Black 
population in the United States (18 percent); 
Whereas in response to recent civil unrest 
in the United States, immigrants of all back-
grounds have pledged their support to fight 
racial injustice, hand-in-hand with Black im-
migrants, to fight for accountability from 
law enforcement and the criminal justice 
system and to demand that law enforcement 
protect people, regardless of their skin color; 
Whereas celebrating the racial, ethnic, lin-
guistic, and religious differences of immi-
grants has resulted in a unified, patriotic, 
and prosperous United States; 
Whereas immigration has long been one of 
the greatest competitive advantages of the 
United States; 
Whereas immigrants of all skill levels have 
helped make the economy of the United 
States the strongest in the world, comple-
menting existing businesses in the United 
States in times of need and founding success-
ful businesses of their own; 
Whereas, although only accounting for 13.7 
percent (nearly 45,000,000 people) of the total 
population of the United States, more than 
40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were 
founded by immigrants or their children, 
which has created $4,200,000,000,000 in annual 
revenue and employ millions of people of the 
United States; 
Whereas 64.5 percent of immigrants aged 16 
and older were employed, as opposed to 60.0 
percent of native-born people of the United 
States; 
Whereas immigrants are entrepreneurial, 
self-starters who create their own oppor-
tunity and employment opportunities for 
others, with 11.8 percent of employed immi-
grants being self-employed compared to 8.9 
percent of employed, native-born people of 
the United States;

vide jobs across the United States, creating

more jobs through entrepreneurial activity 
than they fill; 
Whereas immigrants are more likely to 
have advanced degrees than native-born peo-
ple of the United States; 
Whereas the high-skilled immigration sys-
tem of the United States has not been up-
dated in more than 25 years and is now out-
dated and overburdened, putting global lead-
ership of the United States at risk; 
Whereas national security experts agree 
that it is essential for the United States to 
maintain its military exceptionalism by 
being the leader in advanced technologies 
such as artificial intelligence, cyber, quan-
tum, 
robotics, 
directed 
energy, 
and 
hypersonic weapons, which are all STEM 
fields where immigrants fill dangerous labor 
shortages in the United States; 
Whereas due to population aging and 
longer life expectancy of the population in 
the United States requiring an increase in 
health care workers, immigrants are ex-
pected to fill a crucial need in the future 
health care of the United States, keeping the 
people of the United States healthy; 
Whereas in just 20 years, meaningful immi-
gration policy reform could reduce the Fed-
eral 
deficit 
by 
approximately 
$1,000,000,000,000, contributing to greater eco-
nomic stability and safety; 
Whereas over the course of the next dec-
ade, immigration policy reform would result 
in the creation of 3,230,000 new jobs, keeping 
the United States more economically sound; 
Whereas future population growth in the 
United States will require increased immi-
gration, and by increasing immigration sub-
stantially, will keep the United States eco-
nomically competitive with China and other 
global economies, and reduce future fiscal 
imbalances for popular programs like pro-
grams under the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 301 et seq.); and 
Whereas continued integration of immi-
grants from around the world that encour-
ages and facilitates a pathway to citizenship, 
economic and social mobility, and civic en-
gagement, will perpetuate the prosperity of 
the United States and reinforce the patriot-
ism all people of the United States feel for 
the United States, no matter the color of 
skin, country of origin, or religious back-
ground of the person: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes June 2021 as ‘‘Immigrant 
Heritage Month’’ in honor of the contribu-
tions immigrants and their children have 
made to the United States throughout its 
history; 
(2) pledges to celebrate immigrant con-
tributions to, and immigrant heritages in, 
each State; 
(3) welcomes immigrants presently in the 
United States and individuals seeking to im-
migrate to the United States to contribute 
to the health, safety, diversity, and pros-

place in the vibrant, multiethnic, and inte-
grated society of the United States; 
(4) encourages the people of the United 
States to work with their immigrant neigh-
bors and colleagues to advance the current 
and future well-being of the United States; 
and 
(5) commits to working with fellow Mem-
bers of Congress, the executive agencies that 
administer immigration laws and policies, 
and the President to promote smart and just 
immigration policy for immigrants presently 
in the United States, their families, and indi-
viduals seeking to immigrate to the United 
States in the future.

NATING 
JUNE 
15, 
2021, 
AS 
‘‘WORLD ELDER ABUSE AWARE-
NESS DAY’’ AND THE MONTH OF 
JUNE AS ‘‘ELDER ABUSE AWARE-
NESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 295 
Whereas, in 2021, approximately 55,000,000 
residents of the United States, or about 1 in 
every 6 individuals, have attained the age of 
65; 
Whereas elder abuse remains a challenging 
problem and can come in many different 
forms, often manifesting as physical, sexual, 
or psychological abuse, financial exploi-
tation, neglect, and social media abuse; 
Whereas elder abuse, neglect, and exploi-
tation have no boundaries and cross all ra-
cial, social, class, gender, and geographic 
lines, according to the Elder Justice Coali-
tion; 
Whereas more than 1 in 10 individuals in 
the United States over the age of 60 have 
been subjected to abuse each year, with 
many such victims enduring abuse in mul-
tiple forms, according to the American Jour-
nal of Public Health; 
Whereas most reported cases of abuse, ne-
glect, and exploitation of older adults take 
place within private homes, and approxi-
mately 90 percent of the perpetrators in 
elder financial exploitation cases are family 
members or other trusted individuals, ac-
cording to the National Adult Protective 
Services Association; 
Whereas research suggests that elderly in-
dividuals in the United States who experi-
ence cognitive impairment, physical disabil-
ities, or isolation are more likely to become 
the victims of abuse than those who do not 
experience cognitive impairment, physical 
disabilities, or isolation; 
Whereas other risk factors for elder abuse 
can include low social support, poor physical 
health, and experience of previous traumatic 
events, according to the National Center on 
Elder Abuse; 
Whereas close to half of elderly individuals 
who suffer from dementia will experience 
abuse during their lifetime, according to the 
Department of Justice; 
Whereas only a small fraction of elder 
abuse cases are reported to the authorities; 
Whereas, on June 15, 2021, which was World 
Elder Abuse Awareness Day, the United 
States mourned the loss of a disturbing num-
ber of older people in the United States, who 
perished in nursing homes and other long- 
term care facilities during the COVID–19 
pandemic; 
Whereas, the COVID–19 pandemic also has 
led to the emergence of new scams against 
older adults, including those related to vac-
cines; 
Whereas, there has been an increase in 
hate crimes committed against older, Asian 
Americans during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas, Congress recently passed and the 
President signed 2 measures that make near-
ly $400,000,000 available for implementation 
of Elder Justice Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i–3a et 
seq.) initiatives, the largest funding stream 
related to such initiatives in the history of 
the Act; and 
Whereas Congress, in passing the Elder 
Justice Act of 2009 (42 U.S.C. 1395i–3a et seq.), 
the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 
3001 et seq.), the Elder Abuse Prevention and 
Prosecution Act (34 U.S.C. 21701 et seq.), the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public 
Law 117–2), and the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2021 (Public Law 116–260), recog-
nized the importance of protecting older peo-
ple of the United States against abuse and 
exploitation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June 15, 2021, as ‘‘World 
Elder Abuse Awareness Day’’ and the month 
of June as ‘‘Elder Abuse Awareness Month’’; 
(2) recognizes— 
(A) judges, lawyers, adult protective serv-
ices professionals, law enforcement officers, 
social workers, health care providers, advo-
cates for victims, and other professionals 
and agencies for their efforts to advance 
awareness of elder abuse; 
(B) the important work of the Elder Jus-
tice Coordinating Council, which has contin-
ued through the previous 2 Administrations 
and involves 14 different Federal agencies; 
(C) the essential work done by adult pro-
tective services personnel, who regularly 
came to the assistance of victims, inves-
tigated reports of abuse, and actively pre-
vented future victimization of older people 
in the United States, especially during the 
ongoing COVID–19 pandemic as the social 
isolation of elderly individuals due to stay- 
at-home orders only increased the risk of 
abuse and neglect; and 
(D) the importance of supporting State 
long-term care ombudsman programs, which 
help prevent elder abuse and neglect in nurs-
ing homes and other long-term care facili-
ties, where infection prevention and control 
deficiencies pose persistent challenges; 
(3) applauds the work of the Elder Justice 
Coalition, and its members, whose efforts to 
increase public awareness of elder abuse 
have the potential to increase the identifica-
tion and reporting of this crime by the pub-
lic, professionals, and victims, and can act as 
a catalyst to promote issue-based education 
and long-term prevention; and 
(4) encourages— 
(A) members of the public and profes-
sionals who work with older adults to act as 
catalysts to promote awareness and long- 
term prevention of elder abuse— 
(i) by reaching out to local adult protec-
tive services agencies, State long-term care 
ombudsman programs, and the National Cen-
ter on Elder Abuse; and 
(ii) by learning to recognize, detect, report, 
and respond to elder abuse; 
(B) private individuals and public agencies 
in the United States to continue work to-
gether at the Federal, State, and local levels 
to 
combat 
abuse, 
neglect, 
exploitation, 
crime, 
and 
violence 
against 
vulnerable 
adults, including vulnerable older adults, 
particularly in light of limited resources for 
vital protective services; and 
(C) those Federal agencies with responsi-
bility for preventing elder abuse to fully ex-
ercise such responsibilities to protect older 
adults, whether living in the community or 
in long-term care facilities.

its history and accomplishments toward im-
proving the standing of China as a world 
power; 
Whereas untold millions of Chinese citi-
zens became casualties of the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s quest for power, enduring se-
vere loss and suffering in what amounts to 
humanity’s worst atrocities since World War 
II; 
Whereas, during the Yan’an Rectification 
Movement from 1942 to 1945, more than 10,000 
people were killed as the Chinese Commu-
nity Party attempted to attack and replace 
intellectuals with people who supported the 
Communist ideology; 
Whereas, during the Chinese Land Reform 
of 1949 to 1953, an estimated 4,700,000 land-
owners were murdered in order to redis-
tribute land to peasantry; 
Whereas, during the Campaign to Suppress 
Counterrevolutionaries from 1950 to 1952, an 
estimated 712,000 people were executed for 
their political views and 1,300,000 more were 
sentenced to ‘‘labor reform’’; 
Whereas, during the Three-anti Campaign 
in 1951 and the Five-anti Campaign in 1952, 
Mao Zedong humiliated, terrorized, exiled, 
imprisoned, and killed thousands of political 
opponents and capitalists, weakening the 
economies of the major urban centers of 
China; 
Whereas, during the Sufan Movement from 
1955 to 1957, the Chinese Communist Party 
carried out a purge of hidden counter-
revolutionaries, 
arresting 
an 
estimated 
214,000 people and executing approximately 
53,000 people; 
Whereas, during the Anti-Rightist Cam-
paign from 1957 to 1959, approximately 550,000 
people suffered exile, imprisonment, and exe-
cution as Mao Zedong conducted a purge of 
‘‘rightists,’’ credited for creating the modern 
one-party state of China; 
Whereas, during the Great Chinese Famine 
from 1959 to 1961, an estimated 30,000,000 peo-
ple died as a result of the policy of the Chi-
nese Communist Party, which prioritized in-
dustrialization over agriculture, remembered 
today as one of the greatest man-made disas-
ters in human history; 
Whereas, during the Socialist Education 
Movement from 1963 to 1965, an estimated 
5,000,000 people were persecuted and 77,560

Whereas, during the Tiananmen Square 
Massacre on June 4, 1989, an estimated 10,000 
protestors were arrested or killed by the 
People’s Liberation Army after the Chinese 
Communist Party declared martial law; 
Whereas, since the transfer of sovereignty 
of Hong Kong in 1997, the Chinese Com-
munist Party has increasingly undermined 
the autonomy and judicial independence of 
Hong Kong, resulting in a series of deadly 
protests and demonstrations; 
Whereas, as of June 2021, an estimated 
1,000,000 Uighur Muslims are subject to mass 
detention and torture, including electric 
shock, waterboarding, beatings, rape, forced 
sterilization, forced prostitution, stress posi-
tions, forced administration of unknown 
medication, cold cells, and organ harvesting 
in re-education camps in the Xinjiang prov-
ince of China; 
Whereas, as of June 2021, an estimated 
150,000 Tibetan Buddhists live in exile in 
India and Nepal, 62 years after their leader, 
the Dalai Lama, sought refuge from a Chi-
nese uprising in Tibet; and 
Whereas, as of June 2021, the Chinese Com-
munist Party exerts increasing political, 
military, economic, and social pressure on 
Taiwan in order to undermine its freedom 
and independence: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that, as the world acknowledges the 100th 
anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party 
on July 1, 2021, the Senate solemnly remem-
bers the countless lives the Chinese Com-
munist Party has destroyed and the people 
currently living in fear of its tyrannical am-
bitions.

PROVIDE CRITICAL BENEFITS TO 
THE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES

PETERS, Mr. LANKFORD, Ms. BALDWIN, 
Mr. PORTMAN, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. SCOTT 
of South Carolina, Mr. BROWN, Mr. 
DAINES, Mr. MANCHIN, and Mr. TOOMEY) 
submitted the following concurrent 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Finance: 
S. CON. RES. 10 
Whereas the fraternal benefit societies of 
the United States are longstanding mutual 
aid organizations created more than a cen-
tury ago to serve the needs of communities 
and provide for the payment of life, health, 
accident, and other benefits to their mem-
bers; 
Whereas fraternal benefit societies rep-
resent a successful, modern-day model under 
which individuals come together with a com-
mon purpose to collectively provide chari-
table and other beneficial activities for soci-
ety; 
Whereas fraternal benefit societies operate 
under a chapter system, creating a nation-
wide infrastructure, combined with local en-
ergy and knowledge, which positions fra-
ternal benefit societies to most efficiently 
address unmet needs in communities, many 
of which the government cannot address; 
Whereas 
the 
fraternal 
benefit 
society 
model represents one of the largest member- 
volunteer networks in the United States, 
with approximately 8,000,000 people of the 
United States belonging to more than 25,000 
local chapters across the country; 
Whereas research has shown that the value 
of the work of fraternal benefit societies to 
society is more than $3,800,000,000 per year, 
accounting for charitable giving, educational 
programs, and volunteer activities, as well 
as important social capital that strengthens 
the fabric, safety, and quality of life in thou-
sands of local communities in the United 
States; 
Whereas, in 1909, Congress recognized the 
value of fraternal benefit societies and ex-
empted those organizations from taxation, 
as later codified in section 501(c)(8) of the In-
ternal Revenue Code of 1986; 
Whereas fraternal benefit societies have 
adapted since 1909 to better serve the evolv-
ing needs of their members and the public; 
Whereas the efforts of fraternal benefit so-
cieties to help people of the United States 
save money and be financially secure re-
lieves pressure on government safety net 
programs; and 
Whereas Congress recognizes that fraternal 
benefit societies have served their original 
purpose for more than a century, helping 
countless individuals, families, and commu-
nities through fraternal member activities: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That it is the sense 
of Congress that— 
(1) the fraternal benefit society model is a 
successful private sector economic and social 
support system that helps meet needs that 
would otherwise go unmet; 
(2) the provision of payment for life, 
health, accident, or other benefits to the 
members of fraternal benefit societies in ac-
cordance with section 501(c)(8) of the Inter-
nal Revenue Code of 1986 is necessary to sup-
port the charitable and fraternal activities 
of the volunteer chapters within the commu-
nities of fraternal benefit societies; 
(3) fraternal benefit societies have adapted 
since 1909 to better serve their members and 
the public; and 
(4) the exemption from taxation under sec-
tion 501(c)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 of fraternal benefit societies continues 
to generate significant returns to the United 
States, and the work of fraternal benefit so-
cieties should continue to be promoted.

JOHN KOZA—EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to recognize John Koza, a Mantua 
Township 
Eagle 
Scout 
who 
achieved 
Scouting’s highest rank. John is a senior at 
Gloucester County institute of Technology and 
is enrolled in the Performing Arts Academy. 
He will be attending Rowan University in the 
fall, pursuing a dual degree in Business and 
Political Science. For his Eagle Scout Project, 
John oversaw the construction and staining of 
a bookcase, cabinet, and safety measures at 
Saint Margaret’s Church of the Infant Jesus 
Parish in Woodbury Heights. With the help of 
scouts and adult volunteers, the project took 
153 hours to complete. John held positions as 
Assistant Patrol Leader, Patrol Leader, Bugler, 
and Den Chief throughout his time as a scout. 
John attended the National Jamboree in 2017 
and remains one of his most memorable high-
lights of his scouting experience. John earned 
a total of 28 merit badges and obtained his 
BSA Lifeguard Certification during his time as 
a Scout. John has done wonderful things for 
the South Jersey community over the years, 
and I know he will excel at Rowan University. 
God Bless John and God Bless America.

HONORING 
AVERY 
FRENCH 
OF 
TURKEY HILL SCHOOL IN OR-
ANGE, CONNECTICUT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, each year 
the community of Orange, Connecticut gathers 
for a solemn ceremony to mark Memorial Day. 
As part of this ceremony, local elementary 
school students are invited to submit essays 
that share their thoughts on Memorial Day and 
its meaning to them. Submissions from each 
of the community’s three elementary schools 
are selected to be included in the ceremony. 
I had the opportunity to join the Orange cere-
mony this year and was inspired by the words 
of this year’s winners and am pleased to have 
this opportunity to share them. 
Avery French, a student at Turkey Hill 
School submitted the following essay: 
Memorial Day is a special holiday for all 
Americans. We celebrate and honor all the 
soldiers who have bravely given up their 
lives so we could be a free country. We honor 
those who fought for our country’s future 
generations. All the soldiers we honor today 
cared about more than just themselves, they 
thought about us and sacrificed their lives 
for the future of our country. 
Memorial Day shouldn’t be confused with 
the similar holiday, Veterans Day. Veterans 
Day honors all who have served in the armed 
forces while Memorial Day honors those who 
have died in the forces. Memorial Day was 
originally given the name Decoration Day 
because of the tradition of people decorating 
the graves of the country’s fallen heroes. Me-
morial Day was officially titled a federal 
holiday in 1971. The tradition of honoring the 
fallen soldiers started the years following 
the Civil War. The Civil War claimed many 
lives of the country’s soldiers. People held 
tributes in the late 60’s, around the time the 
Civil War ended, to honor the dead soldiers, 
leaving flowers and other decorations at 
their graves. While it is unclear how the tra-
dition started, it was declared by the Federal 
Government in 1966 that Waterloo, New York 
was Memorial Day’s official birthplace. 
Quote from History.com, ‘‘On the first Deco-
ration Day, General James Garfield made a 
speech at Arlington National Cemetery, and 
5,000 participants decorated the graves of 
20,000 Civil War soldiers buried there.’’ This 
was very important because it was the first 
time that people had the ability to remem-
ber those who died in the armed forces with 
others. 
We celebrate this holiday known as Memo-
rial Day to remember those who have passed 
that fought hard. On Memorial Day we will 
remember those who we will for now and for-
ever remember as America’s Heroes. So yes, 
we celebrate Memorial Day in honor of 
American soldiers. 
For more than two hundred years American 
soldiers have answered the call to defend our 
land and our values of freedom and democ-
racy. With annual ceremonies like the one in 
Orange, that engage our youngest citizens, we 
ensure that we will never forget that our 
armed forces have a long and proud history, 
and that every one of our veterans has dem-
onstrated outstanding courage, dedication, 
and service. It is my honor to rise today to 
thank A very French for her very special con-
tribution to Memorial Day and her community.

HONORING THE 175 INVENTORS IN-
DUCTED AS THE 2020 FELLOWS

HON. KATHY CASTOR

Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the 175 inventors who will 
soon be inducted as the 2020 Fellows of the 
National Academy of Inventors (NAI) in an in-
duction ceremony in Tampa, FL that will fea-
ture a keynote address by U.S. Commissioner 
for Patents, Andrew Hirshfeld. To be named 
as a Fellow, these men and women were 
nominated by their peers and have undergone 
the scrutiny of the NAI Selection Committee, 
having had their innovations deemed as mak-
ing significant impact on quality of life, eco-
nomic development and welfare of society. 
Collectively, this elite group holds nearly 
4,800 patents. This year’s class of Fellows in-
cludes individuals from 115 research univer-
sities and non-profit research institutes span-

The now 1,403-member group of Fellows is 
composed of more than 165 presidents and 
senior leaders of research universities and 
non-profit research institutes, nearly 600 mem-
bers of the National Academies of Sciences, 
Engineering, and Medicine; 45 inductees of 
the National Inventors Hall of Fame, 63 recipi-
ents of the U.S. National Medal of Technology 
and Innovation and U.S. National Medal of 
Science, 40 Nobel Laureates, 392 AAAS Fel-
lows, 264 IEEE Fellows and 184 Fellows of 
the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, 
among other awards and distinctions. The NAI

age inventors with patents issued from the 
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, enhance 
the visibility of academic technology and inno-
vation, encourage the disclosure of intellectual 
property, educate and mentor innovative stu-
dents and translate the inventions of its mem-
bers to benefit society. 
We are greatly indebted to innovators such

tions. I commend these individuals, and the 
organizations and taxpayers that support

DOO WOP DRIVE-IN 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to speak about the nostalgic Doo 
Wop Drive-In and its founder, Jason Kramer. 
Doo Wop Drive-In is located in Wildwood 
Crest, South Jersey and was established last 
year. I had the pleasure of meeting Jason a 
couple of weeks ago, and his hard work and 
dedication to his theater should be an inspira-
tion to all. Jason had the idea of owning a 
drive-in theater since he was a kid. He loves 
movies and remembers the good times of 
going to a drive-in with his family. Jason 
closes off the parking lot for the drive-in and 
people will bring chairs, blankets, coolers, and 
anything else that will make their experience 
special. Doo Wop Drive-In not only allows 
people to bring their own food and drinks, but 
the movie is free, and popcorn is also pro-
vided. Jason wanted to open a drive-in so it 
could be enjoyed by his community. He want-
ed to make the experience very affordable and 
a fun place for families to bring their children. 
It is people like Jason who make me proud to 
be from South Jersey and proud to have the 
opportunity to represent the South Jersey 
community. God Bless Jason and his family 
and God Bless America.

Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise

port to a thriving domestic manufacturing sec-

With 50 years of service, Goodyear Brakes

Texas, this was the team’s first appearance in 
the finals since 2015 and its second national 
championship in baseball, with the first coming 
in 1983. 
The Highlanders are led by head coach 
Mitch 
Thompson, 
my 
brother-in-law. 
For 
Thompson, who has had a long and distin-
guished baseball career, this was his first na-
tional championship. Thompson played college 
baseball at Fort Hays State University in Kan-
sas, where he twice earned academic all-con-
ference honors and served as team captain as 
a senior. Following his graduation from Fort 
Hays State in 1988, Thompson began his 
coaching career. Prior to being named the 
head coach at McLennan in 2013, Thompson 
served as an assistant at Mississippi State 
University, Radford University, Auburn Univer-
sity, and Baylor University. Additionally, he 
was a scout for the Kansas City Royals orga-
nization in 2013. Throughout his coaching ca-
reer, Thompson has become widely respected 
as a recruiter and evaluator of talent. 
I want to congratulate Coach Thompson and 
his team on their fantastic season. Coming off 
a year in which the baseball season was cut 
short, this season provided unique challenges 
and was unlike any other the players had pre-
viously experienced. I am proud of the 
McLennan team and all that the Highlanders 
accomplished this year by bringing home the 
top prize in junior college baseball.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
STEVE 
KERR 
FROM 
WHEELER 
MISSION 
HON. TREY HOLLINGSWORTH 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a community leader Steve 
Kerr. Steve is retiring after 28 years of service 
to Wheeler Mission, a ministry that has been 
serving Hoosiers for over 128 years, including 
two locations in my district. 
Steve has been with Wheeler since Novem-
ber 22, 1993. He began his role as the Capital 
Campaign Director and then moved into the 
Director of Development role. He has built a 
strong legacy that has impacted thousands of 
lives, went from three staff members to now 
twenty-two who make sure the needs of resi-
dents, staff, donors and volunteers are met 
daily. 
In 2003 Steve had the vision to bring run-
ners, walkers, and families together on 
Thanksgiving Day to help raise money for the 
ministry. The Drumstick Dash is now headed 
into its 19th Dash and continues to grow. Peo-
ple from all over the country descend on Indy 
and virtually to ‘‘Move Their Feet So Others 
Can Eat.’’ The annual campaign, along with 
other special events, raises around million dol-
lars each year for this vital ministry. 
Wheeler Mission offers the Indianapolis and 
Bloomington communities homeless shelters, 
residential programming, addiction recovery 
services, and social enterprises. Wheeler has 
adapted to meet the community’s ever-chang-
ing needs and is unwavering in its commit-
ment to Christ and the transformation through 
the Gospel. I thank Steve Kerr for his commit-
ment to Wheeler Mission, and the lives he has 
and will continue to impact due to his legacy. 
HONORING AVERY ALVES OF TUR-
KEY HILL SCHOOL IN ORANGE, 
CONNECTICUT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, each year 
the community of Orange, Connecticut gathers 
for a solemn ceremony and parade to mark 
Memorial Day. As part of this ceremony, local 
elementary school students are invited to sub-
mit artwork that reflects the special meaning of 
Memorial Day. One of these submissions is 
chosen as the cover art for the community’s 
Memorial Day program. I had the opportunity 
to join the Orange ceremony this year and 
was inspired by the artwork by Avery Alves of 
Turkey Hill School, the student whose artwork 
was selected for the program cover. 
I only wish that I could submit the actual art-
work. Avery did a wonderful job and I will try 
to do it justice with this description. On a white 
backdrop blue blocked letters spell out ‘‘Or-
ange, CT’’; scripted in black just below ‘‘Me-
morial Day’’; blocked red letters spell ‘‘Pa-
rade’’; at the center of the page is a beautifully 
rendered bald eagle clutching an American 
flag in its talons; just below scripted in black 
are the words ‘‘Never Forget’’; and the final 
line, once again blocked in blue lettering, is 
‘‘Ever Honor.’’ For one so young, Avery’s art-
work is a stirring reminder of why we gather 
each year to pay homage to those who have 
made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our 
Nation. 
For more than two hundred years American 
soldiers have answered the call to defend our 
land and our values of freedom and democ-
racy. With annual ceremonies like the one in 
Orange, that engage our youngest citizens, we 
ensure that we will never forget that our 
armed forces have a long and proud history, 
and that every one of our veterans has dem-
onstrated outstanding courage, dedication, 
and service. It is my honor to rise today to 
thank Avery Alves for her very special con-
tribution to Memorial Day and her community.

DEKON FASHAW, SR. 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to speak about an inspiring citizen 
of Cape May, New Jersey—Dekon Fashaw, 
Sr. Back in February, he became the first 
Black police chief for the City of Cape May. 
Before becoming police chief, Dekon was with 
the Cape May Police Department for 22 years. 
Throughout his career, he longed to be a po-
lice officer because he felt that it was impor-
tant for a man of color to be in the esteemed 
position to look after his community. Dekon 
has the support of many behind him, including 
his predecessor, Anthony Marino. The City of 
Cape May Mayor Zack Mullok also empha-
sized how Dekon has brought the community 
together through his positive attitude and de-
sire to care for people. I have no doubt that 
Dekon will serve and protect the City of Cape 
May. He is an exceptional man who has dedi-
cated his life to public service. God Bless him 
and God Bless America.

Mr. Halbert Sullivan, founder and CEO of Fa-
thers & Families Support Center (FFSC) who 
passed away on April 15, 2021. Mr. Sullivan is 
a shining personification of triumphing over 
mistakes and using them as a catalyst for 
change. As the founder of FFSC, Mr. Sullivan 
was 
continually 
recognized 
for 
his 
groundbreaking work in the community, includ-
ing being awarded with the Gold Pin for the 
President’s Volunteer Service Award, a Life-
time Achievement Award from the National 
Partnership of Community Leadership, multiple 
honors from the NAACP, Missouri Association 
of Social Welfare, Washington University, and 
many others. In 2017, Mr. Sullivan was also 
named St. Louis’ Nonprofit Executive of the 
Year. He was unquestionably a change agent 
whose work and impact reverberated in the 
lives of every person he touched. St. Louis 
has been made lastingly better because of his 
legacy and he will be sorely and widely 
missed.

HONORING SHERIFF JOHN 
ROBERTSON 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Sheriff John 
Robertson and to recognize his extensive con-
tributions to our community through his leader-
ship in law enforcement. 
A California native, Sheriff Robertson was 
born and raised in Burlingame, California. He 
went on to attend San Diego State University, 
where he received his degree in Criminal Jus-
tice. Sheriff Robertson began his accom-
plished career in Law Enforcement at the San 
Mateo Police Department in 1981. It was there 
that he established his expertise in Hazardous 
Materials, Explosives, and Incident Manage-
ment. Since June 1991, Sheriff Robertson has 
been with the Napa County Sheriffs Office, 
where he established himself as a natural 
leader and resource to the Napa community. 
Soon after, he began teaching at the Police 
Academy and Criminal Justice Training Cen-
ter, where he instructed both Academy Cadets 
and law enforcement officers on a wide variety 
of topics. 
He became Sheriff of Napa County in 2012 
serving for 11 years, including during the ter-
rible earthquake in 2014 and the apocalyptic 
fires in 2017, 2019, and 2020. Sheriff Robert-
son’s leadership and innovation has recently 
led to a pilot program utilizing the European 
‘‘Hi-Lo’’ siren in patrol cars for use during 
evacuations. As a result, departments across 
California began participating in this program, 
leading to the passage of Senate Bill 909, 
which amended the California Vehicle Code to

allow for Sheriff Robertson’s idea to become 
an industry norm nationwide. 
Throughout his career, Sheriff Robertson 
has never lost sight of the importance of Com-
munity Policing. He has tirelessly advocated 
for programs to improve his community, in-
cluding bicycle patrol in jurisdictions like 
Yountville and Sheriffs Activities League pro-
grams in Napa and American Canyon. Serving 
under the mantra ‘‘The less you say, the more 
people listen,’’ Sheriff Robertson has estab-
lished himself as a leader in his community 
and continues to be a resource to elected offi-
cials and department directors alike. His ex-
tensive legacy will be continued by his son, 
Jack, who is serving as Deputy Sheriff in So-
lano County. I wish my friend, colleague, and 
cycling partner well in his retirement. 
Madam Speaker, it is no doubt that Sheriff 
Robertson’s achievements will leave a tremen-
dous impact for generations to come. There-
fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor him 
here today.

HONORING THE CAREER OF CARLA 
DOLES 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the career of Carla Doles. Carla just re-
tired after 44 years of service as a public- 
school teacher and show choir director. All 44 
years of her career as an educator were in 
northeast Indiana. 
She was a beloved figure of her community, 
wielding a profound and lasting influence upon 
students across two school districts for more 
than two generations. 27 years of her career 
were spent at Carroll High School in Fort 
Wayne; the other 17 at Norwell High School in 
Ossian. 
Carla’s love for her vocation and devotion to 
her students’ future was evident every single 
day. That love and devotion inspired the con-
fidence of many of her students to compete in 
choral and other national competitions across 
the country. 
It was also evident in her desire to create 
new opportunities for students. Carla helped 
found the small mixed (men & women) divi-
sion of show choirs. 
I wish Carla the best for all that she has 
done after a long and distinguished career. 
This is a testament to her service and selfless-
ness for which Fort Wayne, Ossian and the 
entirety of our region is grateful.

DANIEL LEVINE—EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to recognize Daniel Levine, a Man-
tua Township Eagle Scout who achieved 
Scouting’s highest rank. Daniel is a senior at 
Gloucester County Institute of Technology and 
is enrolled in their Performing Arts Academy. 
In the fall, Daniel will be attending Rowan Col-
lege of South Jersey. For his Eagle Scout 
Project, Daniel created a sensory path by the 
playground at Sewell Elementary School. This 
project provided the children who attended the 
elementary school the opportunity to do fun 
activities and work on their gross motor skills. 
During his time as a Scout, Daniel served as 
both Assistant Patrol Leader and a Den Chief. 
Daniel has also earned 35 merit badges as his 
time as a Scout. Daniel has excelled through-
out his time as a scout, and I look forward to 
seeing what he accomplishes in the future. 
God Bless Daniel and God Bless America.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JODY 
HUBBARD 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Jody Hubbard, 
a former Encinitas city councilmember, who 
passed away on June 7, 2021 after a coura-
geous battle with cancer. 
Jody’s life-long dedication to the environ-
ment pushed her to serve her community, first 
as an engaged citizen, then as a Planning 
Commissioner, and finally as an elected City 
Council Member and Deputy Mayor of the City 
of Encinitas from 2018 to 2020. She led the 
fight for city transportation projects, including a 
new protected bike lane along Coast Highway 
101. She leaves a personal legacy of popular 
spaces where people walk, run and bicycle 
safely, including the Coastal Rail Trail and 
Leucadia Streetscape. 
She was an avid bodysurfer and cyclist, es-
pecially around her community of Cardiff by 
the Sea, along the scenic northern coast of 
San Diego County. She had an infectious 
smile and was a crucial member of the 
Encinitas community. 
A Southern California native, Jody started 
her career as a certified public accountant with 
large public accounting firms followed by fif-
teen years as a chief financial officer and vice 
president of finance in the construction and 
mortgage industries. She then began her own 
business to provide long-term care planning to 
serve families in providing for the care of par-
ents and grandparents. 
Jody Hubbard will be long remembered by 
her mother Joanne, her many friends, and ev-
eryone she touched.

HONORING ARMAAN SHRIVASTAV 
OF RACE BROOK SCHOOL IN OR-
ANGE, CONNECTICUT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, each year 
the community of Orange, Connecticut gathers 
for a solemn ceremony to mark Memorial Day. 
As part of this ceremony, local elementary 
school students are invited to submit essays 
that share their thoughts on Memorial Day and 
its meaning to them. Submissions from each 
of the community’s three elementary schools 
are selected to be included in the ceremony. 
I had the opportunity to join the Orange cere-
mony this year and was inspired by the words 
of this year’s winners and am pleased to have 
this opportunity to share them. 
Armaan Shrivastav, a student at Race 
Brook School submitted the following essay: 
Why is Memorial Day Celebrated? Unrea-
soning leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. 
Hate leads to desire for power. Power leads 
to war. For war, we need soldiers. So many 
soldiers die serving their nation. Memorial 
Day is for remembering those brave soldiers 
who gave up their lives for their fellow citi-
zens. 
Memorial Day is when we honor and re-
member the brave soldiers. We celebrate Me-
morial Day to show respect for them. We 
must thank these soldiers who sacrificed 
themselves for the country. Memorial Day is 
a day to bow to them. Many people celebrate 
this day by going to their family’s graves to-
gether and hold a gathering or participate in 
a parade. New York is the birthplace of Me-
morial Day. After the Civil War, which 
claimed many lives, people started deco-
rating graves with flowers. This came to be 
known as Decoration Day. Since then, people 
have started giving more importance to this 
day by visiting soldier’s graves every year, 
so the government officially announced the 
last Monday of May as Memorial Day. 
Memorial Day is celebrated on the last 
Monday of May. This year Memorial Day is 
on 31st May. We should all honor these brave 
soldiers, offer flowers to them and remember 
their selfless service for the nation and what 
they did for us. 
For more than two hundred years American 
soldiers have answered the call to defend our 
land and our values of freedom and democ-
racy. With annual ceremonies like the one in 
Orange, that engage our youngest citizens, we 
ensure that we will never forget that our 
armed forces have a long and proud history, 
and that every one of our veterans has dem-
onstrated outstanding courage, dedication, 
and service. It is my honor to rise today to 
thank Armaan Shrivastav for his very special 
contribution to Memorial Day and his commu-
nity.

Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I had the 
pleasure of attending the opening ceremony of 
Broadway Scoops in Pennsville, South Jersey. 
At the opening, I met Gary and Sabrina Green 
who opened Broadway Scoops’ doors after 
finding inspiration through their love for ice 
cream. The entire shop was constructed by 
local small businesses and the supplies were 
sourced from local small businesses as well. 
Gary and Sabrina wanted to create a place 
where their local community could come in 
with their families and have a space to try ice 
cream and relax outdoors. There are picnic ta-
bles, checkers, corn hole, and various other 
games that patrons can come and enjoy free 
of charge. Gary and Sabrina told me how the 
support from their local community has been 
overwhelming and friends and family have 
traveled across the country to support their 
business. It is amazing to see South Jersey 
small business prosper, and I wish Gary and 
Sabrina the best of luck in their new venture. 
God Bless Gary and Sabrina and God Bless

Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I am not re-
corded for Roll Call vote No. 180 on Wednes-

ably detained. Had I been present, I would 
have voted Nay on the Protecting Older Work-
ers Against Discrimination Act of 2021, RC 
No. 180. 
The Protecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act would overturn a 2009 Su-
preme Court ruling on the basis that the deci-
sion negatively impacted age discrimination 
cases; however, there is no data to support 
that claim. In fact, this legislation would elimi-
nate the carefully balanced standard Congress 
adopted when it passed the Age Discrimina-
tion in Employment Act and result in frivolous 
litigation against small businesses. 
Since my first day in office, l have been 
squarely focused on what I was sent here to 
do: represent Hoosiers of the 6th District.

GO FOR BROKE STAMP 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
with my colleagues to recognize and honor 
. . . a stamp. 
A stamp just issued by the U.S. Postal 
Service that, with stunning simplicity, remem-
bers, recognizes and honors one of the most 
remarkable and inspirational stories in the 
whole of our country’s history. 
A story of tragedy, perseverance and tri-
umph that is so quintessentially American, that 
goes so deeply to our essence, that offers the 
most fundamental lessons that we must never 
forget. 
And that is the point of this stamp: that we 
never forget the story of the Japanese Amer-
ican soldiers of World War Two and their fa-
mous motto which is its own lesson: Go For 
Broke. 
For many of us, the story is well known and 
has instructed and inspired our own lives. But 
for a growing number of our fellow citizens of 
our country and world it is not, and so permit 
me a brief retelling. 
The story originates in Japan in the late 
1800s when largely rural poverty and lack of 
opportunity drove emigration to the United 
States, mainly Hawaii and the West Coast, 
until the Exclusion Act of 1924 ended any sub-
stantial further immigration. This first genera-
tion, or lssei, were excluded by reason of their 
race and origin from citizenship, yet they 
worked and sacrificed and persevered to pro-
vide a better life for their children, the second 
generation, or Nisei, born American citizens. 
As World War Two loomed, Americans of 
Japanese Ancestry were beginning their third 
generation, or Sansei, in substantial commu-
nities, yet they remained largely marginalized 
because of race. In my Hawaii, they con-
stituted over one third of our population, yet 
largely still labored on plantations or worked in 
small businesses. The same was true on the 
West Coast, from Washington through Oregon 
to San Diego. Some Nisei saw war with Japan 
coming and sought to enlist in our armed serv-
ices, but they were largely denied out of race 
and suspicion and sought to prove themselves 
through service in the guard or, in Hawaii, the 
Varsity Victory Volunteers. 
Pearl Harbor changed everything. Infa-
mously, over one hundred thousand Japanese 
were interned for their race, an indelible stain 
on our national fabric. And after years of Japa-
nese Americans pushing to be allowed to 
prove their loyalty by enlisting and fighting, the 
military finally relented with the 100th Infantry 
Battalion (the One-Puka-Puka), the 442nd reg-
imental Combat Team (‘‘Go For Broke’’), the 
Military Intelligence Service and the 1399th 
Engineer Construction Battalion. 
The rest, as they say, is legend. The 100th 
and 442nd, after enduring great discrimination 
and great kindness in mainland training camps 
where Jim Crow was still very much alive, and 
even as their parents and brothers and sisters 
were 
incarcerated 
by 
their 
government, 
shipped out and fought their way with the U.S. 
Army from Africa up through Sicily and Italy 
and the Rhone and into France and the fa-
mous Battles of the Yosges and the Bulge and 
then into German itself where they liberated 
the concentration camps of the Third Reich. 
When it was all over, they had lost so many 
comrades and had become the most deco-
rated unit for its size and length of service in 
our nation’s history. 
But it was not just for their wartime service 
that they are remembered, but their faith in 
and dedication to their country upon their re-
turn, itself marked even after all that by racism 
and discrimination. Many of them went on to 
careers in public service, like U.S. Senator 
and Medal Of Honor winner Daniel Inouye and 
U.S. Senator Spark Matsunaga, and many 
more in other professions and careers and 
back in their communities where they quietly 
fought for the principle that the American 
dream belonged to all Americans. 
What an American story, and for all this we 
honored them in 2010 with our Congressional 
Gold Medal. But was that enough; would it all 
be remembered? 
Three Japanese American women in Cali-
fornia who themselves had been incarcer-
ated—Fusa Takahashi, Chiz Ohira and Aiko 
King—thought not, and in 2005 they launched 
Stamp Our Story to convince the U.S. Postal 
Service to issue a stamp in honor and remem-
brance of the Japanese American soldiers of 
World War Two. Sixteen long years later, 
through continued advocacy led in Congress 
by my Congressional Asian Pacific American 
Caucus and my colleagues here now and be-
fore—especially 
U.S. 
Congressman 
Mark 
Takai, himself a Japanese American veteran 
of Operation Iraqi Freedom, tragically lost to 
us—this beautiful and moving stamp, impec-
cably designed by Antonio Alcala, was issued 
just weeks ago. 
The design is taken from a 1944 photograph 
in the field of 442nd Private First Class 
Shiroku ‘Whitey’ Yamamoto, a Nisei born and 
raise in the plantation village of Ninole on the 
Hamakua Coast of my home island of Hawaii. 
His service included the famous rescue of the 
Texas Lost Battalion in the Vosges, when the 
442nd’s casualties far exceeded the number 
of their mostly white comrades rescued. Leg-
end has it that the motto ‘‘Go For Broke’’—or 
in our pidgin go fo broke—originated in Hawaii 
gambling slang for going big against all odds. 
The soldier’s face speaks of fatigue, of ques-
tions, but above all of Gaman, of persever-
ance through great adversity to a better place. 
Such a fitting tribute, so appropriate. And 
made possible by so many, including col-
leagues who are here with me today to con-
tribute their own thoughts. 
Mdam Speaker, we are all grateful for the 
opportunity to remember and retell the Amer-
ican story of the Japanese American soldiers 
of World War II and to celebrate the lessons 
of their service and lives through their stamp. 
To close, I’d like to recite the 442nd’s spe-
cial song: 
Four Forty Second Infantry 
We are the boys of Hawai‘i nei 
We will fight for you 
And the red, white and blue 
And will go to the front 
And back to Honolulu-lu-lu 
Fighting for dear old Uncle Sam 
Go for broke we don’t give a damn! 
We will round up the huns 
At the point of a gun 
And the victory will be ours! 
Go for broke! Four Four Two! 
Go for broke! Four Four Two! 
And victory will be ours. 
Mahalo.

their academic excellence, desire to serve, 
and commitment to patriotism. 
I take this time to congratulate Harrison 
Brownlee of Hot Springs on his acceptance of 
an appointment to the United States Military 
Academy and Cody Lambert of Redfield on 
his acceptance of an appointment to the 
United States Air Force Academy. These 
young Americans embody qualities of aca-
demic excellence and service above self 
which are necessary for military service. 
These two young men are a tremendous 
source of pride not just for their hometowns, 
but for the entire Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict. Their commitment to excellence is to be 
commended, but it is their love of country, de-
fense of liberty, and pursuit of a freer America 
that truly sets them apart from all others. 
I take this time to honor them for their suc-
cesses, encourage them on this new pursuit, 
and thank them for their example to the rest 
of the country of what a patriot truly is.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to speak about a historical and 
scenic road in South Jersey, the Bayshore 
Heritage Byway. Earlier this year in February, 
the Federal Highway Administration selected 
the Bayshore Heritage Byway as a National 
Scenic Byway. This is a wonderful accom-
plishment and I congratulate all of those who 
have worked towards achieving this goal. The 
Bayshore Heritage Byway was nominated on 
two intrinsic qualities: its natural beauty and 
historical components. It will now be featured 
in a commemorative 2021 National Scenic By-
ways Program Designations Booklet and will 
also be listed on the America’s Byways 
website. The Bayshore Heritage Byway is full 
of beauty and history and I am proud that a 
South Jersey landmark has been given this 
distinct recognition.

PATRIARCH 
BARTHOLOMEW 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to honor and recognize Ecumenical Patriarch 
Bartholomew of Constantinople on the historic 
30th Anniversary of his election on October 
22, 1991, and his elevation on November 2, 
1991, as the 270th Archbishop of Constanti-
nople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch. 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew was 
born in the village of Zeytinli on the island of 
Imbros to Christos and Merope Archontonis. 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew belongs to 
the historically indigenous Rum people, de-
scendants of the Eastern Roman Empire/Byz-
antine Empire Greek community in Turkey. 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew is recog-
nized in the United States and abroad as a 
leader in the quest for world peace, greater re-
ligious understanding, and respect for the 
Earth’s environment. Ecumenical Patriarch 
Bartholomew is the spiritual leader of nearly 
300,000,000 Orthodox Christians around the 
world and millions of Orthodox Christians in 
the United States, with a significant population 
here in Illinois and the City of Chicago. 
On his first official visit to the United States 
in 1997, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew 
received the Congressional Gold Medal, pre-
sented by the United States on behalf of Con-
gress in recognition of his outstanding and en-
during contributions to religious understanding 
and peace. His Holiness was recognized by 
the United States in a manner reserved for a 
very small number of world leaders. 
I am grateful for all the good that His All Ho-
liness does for Americans and those around 
the world. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew 
serves as a reminder to us all that the positive 
efforts of just one person can be beneficial to 
countless lives of others.

CLARIFICATION TO REPRESENTA-
TIVE LIZ CHENEY’S COMMENTS 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to address what I think, and what I think the 
record will establish, are errors pertaining to 
my inquiry into circumstances surrounding the 
killing of Ashli Babbitt. 
There are rules of decorum in the House of 
Representatives. In debate, members are to 
‘‘avoid characterizing another Member’s per-
sonal intent or motives and discussing person-
alities.’’ Another rule is that members are to 
‘‘refrain from speaking disrespectfully of the 
Speaker, other Members.’’ When made on the 
floor, such disrespectful behavior and boorish 
conduct is subject to objection to take down 
the words. But no such process applies when 
rude, impolite and candidly false statements 
are made about one member by another off 
the floor. So, I take this opportunity now to ad-
dress and correct the incorrect statements ut-
tered by Rep. LIZ CHENEY, the now former 
conference chair. 
On June 16, 2021, Rep. CHENEY tweeted 
the following: ‘‘On January 6, as the violent 
mob advanced on the House chamber, I was 
standing near @RepGosar and helped him 
open his gas mask. The Capitol Police led us 
to safety. It is disgusting and despicable to 
see Gosar lie about that day and smear the 
men and women who defended us.’’ 
First, I did not wear a gas mask on January 
6. Second, at no time have I ‘‘smeared’’ any 
of the ‘‘men and women who defended us’’ 
nor did I ‘‘lie about that day.’’ What I have 
done is ask questions and demanded trans-
parency. I did express concerns over the ac-
tions of one Capitol Police officer, the one who 
shot and killed Ashli Babbitt. Merely ques-
tioning the actions of one officer does not 
equate to questioning (much less ‘‘smearing’’) 
‘‘all’’ the ‘‘men and women who defended’’ us, 
as stated by Ms. CHENEY. This is a false com-
parison and not true at all. 
I will not be intimidated by false implications. 
I will continue to seek transparency and find 
out why, who, and how the officer that killed 
Ashli Babbitt did what he did. There could be 
good, solid reasons for using lethal force at 
that moment. Perhaps he thought Ashli was 
armed with a knife, a bat, or a gun. Maybe he 
simply panicked. Unfortunately, with the evi-
dence currently released, we have one video 
(taken by a CNN collaborator who, while film-
ing for CNN, urged people to ‘‘bum’’ the Cap-
itol) and that video does not show a gun, a 
bat, or any weapon whatsoever. The video 
simply shows an unarmed woman starting to 
climb a window. If there is evidence to the 
contrary, I have called for its immediate re-
lease. I call for all the evidence, all video from 
that day, whether it incriminates or exoner-
ates. The goal, my goal, is truth. 
I have maintained my demand for release of 
all surveillance video. As it stands, all the 
American public has, in terms of evidence, is 
that (1) Ashli Babbitt was in the process of a 
misdemeanor (entering federal property with-
out permission); (2) Ashli was unarmed; (3) 
Ashli was a 14-year military veteran who loved 
her country, the Constitution, and wanted elec-
tion integrity; (4) no verbal instructions or 
warnings were given; (5) no escalation of 
force continuum was considered or used prior 
to using lethal force; and (6) no aid was ren-
dered by the officer once he killed Ashli. All of 
these factors suggest an unlawful use of force, 
and the American public has a right to find out 
if that is true. Getting to the bottom of this inci-
dent is not an indictment of all Capitol police 
officers and such a suggestion is not logical or 
fact based. 
I have spoken to law enforcement experts. 
I have watched the only video that is publicly 
available of the shooting of Ashli Babbitt. The 
officer that shot Ms. Babbitt is seen on the 
video hiding in a vestibule. All that can be 
seen are his hands holding a loaded side arm 
pointing at Ms. Babbitt. For approximately 14 
seconds. The only video available shows no 
verbal or non-verbal warnings. No effort to tell 
Ms. Babbitt not to climb through the window. 
No effort to push her back or use non-lethal 
force of any type. Rather, after hiding in a ves-
tibule and aiming for 14 seconds, the officer 
fires one round from the side, killing Ms. Bab-
bitt. Thus, this officer went from ‘‘officer pres-
ence’’ straight to lethal force, and skipped 
verbal commands, soft controls, hard controls

and intermediate weapons. The jump to lethal 
force needs to be fully reviewed and inves-
tigated. At present, it does not appear justified. 
If there is justification, release the evidence 
now. 
One law enforcement expert I talked to de-
scribed this as lying in wait to shoot someone 
and a criminal offense. This was not accept-
able police work. I reject the comment that 
one must either support every police officer 
100 percent of the time or be ‘‘against’’ law 
enforcement, or to quote my colleague, to 
‘‘smear’’ all police officers everywhere. Such 
notions are not worthy of serious discussion. I 
put my record of support for law enforcement 
up for comparison to anyone. But support 
need not be blind . . . or stupid. I can take 
issue with a bad cop. I can take issue with a 
bad killing. To see this swept under the rug 
under some false pretext of ‘‘he was pro-
tecting Congress’’ is as ridiculous as it is in-
sulting. Using that logic, no police officer 
would ever be challenged on any killing—‘‘He 
was trying to uphold the law.’’ Using this logic, 
that would end the inquiry. That is not how our 
laws work. 
Life is not that simple. The law of self-de-
fense and the defense of others is based on 
the circumstances. Was the attacker armed? 
Did the officer have time to use non-lethal 
force? Was there backup? Was the suspect 
warned or commanded? What exactly was the 
risk? Trespassing risk is different than a risk of 
assault or murder. In this case, Ashli may or 
may not have been trespassing. I say this only 
because depending on what door she went 
through, some of the people in the Capitol on 
January 6th were literally invited in by the 
guards. But assuming she was trespassing, 
did she pose an imminent risk of death to the 
officer or someone else? This unarmed 110– 
pound woman, who was draped in a flag and 
trying to climb a window? Why did the Officer 
wait 14 seconds to shoot all the while aiming 
at her? Why did he not audibly warn her? Why 
didn’t he step out of his hiding place and con-
front her? Or use a taser? Or a baton? Or 
simply push her back out? 
These issues, and the professional opinion 
of a law enforcement expert, lead to the con-
clusion that the officer that shot Ashli Babbitt 
was lying in wait, hid for 14 seconds, then 
used lethal force to kill an unarmed, non- 
threatening woman. If that is true, then no way 
does this constitute a lawful killing. The fact 
that some members think it is acceptable po-
lice work, and call me a liar for pointing out 
these so far undisputed facts, reflects more on 
naked hatred for the truth than a love of trans-
parency and honesty. If anyone thinks this is 
good police work, release all the evidence so 
we can discuss it. I stand by my concerns, 
and my questions, and I stand with the Amer-
ican people who demand answers.

HONORING HAMDEN HEROES DAY 
2021 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, over the 
course of the last fifteen months, our commu-
nities and our constituents have faced the 
unique challenges brought on by the COVID– 
19 pandemic. We have ensured the biggest 
health and economic crisis our country has 
seen in a century. What has inspired me most 
as we have navigated this pandemic has been 
the unyielding fortitude of our communities 
and the commitment and dedication of our 
frontline workers. That is why I was so hon-
ored to have been invited to join Hamden He-
roes Day where the community gathered to 
express its thanks and appreciation to the 
frontline workers who live in and/or work for 
the Town. 
Connecticut was hit harder than most as 
COVID–19 spread across New England before 
it reached many other parts of the country. 
Over, 8,000 Connecticut residents died during 
this pandemic. Nearly 350,000 have been in-
fected, many of whom are our frontline work-
ers. This year, the Hamden Heroes Committee 
decided to pay tribute to the frontline workers 
in their community—our police, fire and emer-
gency medical response personnel; our health 
department and public works employees; our 
teachers, nurses, and doctors; our gas station 
attendants, grocery workers, and convenience 
store workers; our certified nurse assistants 
and all those who provide care for those in the 
community who are older; our childcare pro-
viders who help struggling families to make 
ends meet; and our farmers and food distribu-
tion staff who literally are the ones putting 
food on our tables. Despite the risks, these 
frontline workers showed up and did their jobs 
while many of us worked comfortably from 
home. 
These past fifteen months have been ex-
tremely challenging, but their dedication to 
their jobs and the Hamden community never 
wavered. Every day, they got up and com-
mitted their time and talent to serve the people 
of Hamden. Their efforts have not gone unno-
ticed. They have my gratitude and heartfelt 
appreciation for all they do, and we are deeply 
grateful for all their sacrifices. Their selfless 
and courageous service helped make it pos-
sible for us to get through these tough times. 
For that, and so much more, we thank them. 
At the conclusion of the event, the Hamden 
Heroes Committee made a request of the 
elected officials that attended the event. They 
asked for the day to be declared ‘‘Hamden 
Heroes Day’’ and their elected leaders help 
spread the word to other communities in the 
hopes that they too will join in thanking the es-
sential workers. It is my hope that by honoring 
Hamden Heroes Day, I can do some small 
part in encouraging communities across the 
Nation to come together as well.

BARRY’S BUNS 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I want to 
recognize Barry’s Buns, and its owners Joel 
and Jen Singer. Barry’s Buns just opened a 
new location in Wildwood Crest in South Jer-
sey, and I was able to meet with Joel and Jen 
and attend the grand opening. The inspiration 
for the name ‘‘Barry’s Buns’’ comes from Joel, 
who’s middle name is Barry. He also says that 
he was born to be a baker. Joel has always 
wanted to have his own bakery, and when he 
was just 14 years old, he started his own 
cheesecake business. He graduated with a 
degree in Pastry Arts and was the Assistant 
Pastry Chef at the Rittenhouse Hotel. Joel 
drew inspiration to open up his own business 
from his father, who before his passing had 
his own farmers style market. Joel developed 
a passion for customer service from watching 
his dad, and when a location opened up in 
Pennsylvania, he knew it was time to start his 
own bakery. Jen handles the business side of 
Barry’s Buns and its day-to-day operations. 
Now, Joel and Jen own two locations, and I 
know that South Jersey will continue to pro-
vide overwhelming support for Barry’s Buns. 
God Bless Joel and Jen and God Bless Amer-
ica.

HONORING THE LIFE AND DEDI-
CATED SERVICE OF KATHLEEN 
‘‘KITTY’’ HILL KUNZ OF BOISE, 
IDAHO 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to Kathleen ‘‘Kitty’’ Hill Kunz. 
Kitty worked as my regional director in Poca-
tello, Idaho. Kitty always had a smile and a 
compliment for everyone. She was cheerful 
and hard working even as she battled an in-
curable cancer for many years. Kitty raised 
five beautiful children with her husband Kent 
Kunz in Pocatello and later they moved to 
Boise. 
She was politically active and her love for 
our country ran deep. She worked for three 
Congressmen, ran numerous campaigns, and 
served as an attache´ at the Idaho State Legis-
lature. She was active in Republican groups 
both in Pocatello and Boise and served for a 
decade as the secretary of the Idaho Repub-
lican Central Committee. She also served 
faithfully as president of the Idaho Federation 
of Republican Women. She helped found the 
Connor Academy in Pocatello, which is named 
after her grandson, and served as a member 
of the Idaho Charter School Commission. 
When she was diagnosed with cancer, she 
said she wanted to get a red Mustang convert-
ible and visit as many national parks as pos-
sible. Kitty did just that and she and Kent vis-
ited almost every national park in the western 
United States. 
Her cheerful disposition, smile, laugh, and 
hugs will be treasured memories for all who 
knew her. She served her family, country, and 
the second congressional district of Idaho for 
many years. 
My wife, Kathy and I, offer our deepest sym-
pathies to Kitty’s family, friends, and loved 
ones during this difficult time of bereavement. 
I will forever be grateful for Kitty’s tireless 
service. Truly, so many of us are better people 
for having known Kitty Kunz. We will miss her, 
but know her good work continues in heaven.

CELEBRATING PRIDE MONTH 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I’m proud to 
join my fellow members of the Equality Cau-
cus in celebrating Pride Month and the 
progress our country has made in securing 
equal rights for all, regardless of sexual ori-
entation or gender identity. As we recognize 
our progress, we must keep fighting because 
the LGBTQ+ community has yet to be granted 
full equality. 
Pride Month commemorates the Stonewall 
Uprising, the now-famous targeting of the gay 
community at the Stonewall Inn by police in 
New York City in June 1969. In the subse-
quent four decades since Stonewall, LGBTQ+ 
individuals can serve openly in the military, 
same-sex couples can wed, and the Supreme 
Court has upheld certain federal laws prohib-
iting discrimination on the basis of sexual ori-
entation and gender identity. 
Much 
work 
remains 
to 
be 
done. 
Transgender individuals still face high levels of 
violence. Federal, state, and local laws still 
allow many forms of discrimination based on 
sexual orientation and gender identity. And 
just last week in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 
the Supreme Court found that anti-LGBTQ+ 
religious objections can override a government 
agency’s policies to ensure equality. While the 
case focused on same-sex couples adopting 
children, it could have much broader ramifica-
tions. 
For all these reasons, I’m proud to be an 
original cosponsor of H.R. 5, the Equality Act, 
which extends anti-discrimination provisions in 
federal law to prohibit discrimination on the 
basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. 
I’m proud that the House passed this legisla-
tion on a bipartisan vote of 224 to 206 on Feb-
ruary 25, 2021. I urge the Senate to take up 
this legislation and send it to the President’s 
desk as soon as possible. 
As we celebrate Pride Month, let us also re-
member the victims of anti-LGBTQ+ hate, 
mourn the loss of countless loved ones whose 
lives were lost in the battle against HIV/AIDS, 
and reaffirm our commitment to fighting for an 
America where all are equal, no matter their 
gender identity or sexual orientation.

recognize one outstanding Women of the Year 
Award recipient, Sojourner Kincaid Rolle, of 
Santa Barbara, California. 
It is community members like Sojourner that 
make Santa Barbara County special, and it is 
hard to put into words all of her contributions 
to our community. She is a poet, playwright, 
environmental educator, and cultural and 
peace activist. She is known for her work rais-
ing awareness of our diverse cultural history 
throughout the county and is heavily involved 
as a guiding elder for Juneteenth Santa Bar-
bara and Healing Justice Santa Barbara orga-
nizations. 
In 2015 Sojourner was named Poet Lau-
reate of Santa Barbara and served a two-year 
term. As a selldefined ‘‘public poet’’, she is in-
vited to compose and present poems for nu-
merous special occasions. She is a two-time 
recipient of the California Arts Council’s Artist- 
in-Residence program and for nearly 30 years 
has led poetry workshops throughout the West 
Coast. Since 1997, she has engaged young 
poets through her ‘‘Song of Place Poetry 
Project’’ and her work with City at Peace, 
Speak for the Creeks, California Poets in the 
Schools, Poetry OutLoud, and the MLK Poetry 
and Essay Contest. 
She is the author of seven books of poetry 
and six plays, and her poetry is published in 
across social media. Her arts reviews and 
commentaries have also appeared in local and 
regional publications. Sojourner is a truthteller. 
She exhumes our past stories and brings 
them to life as a reminder of where we have 
been and where we can go. 
A founding member of Santa Barbara’s Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. Committee, Sojourner has 
also served with multiple Santa Barbara Coun-
ty organizations including the Santa Barbara 
County Arts Commission, Santa Barbara 
NAACP, Santa Barbara Arts Council, the Fund 
for Santa Barbara Grantmaking Committee, 
Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, 
and the UCSB Center for Black Studies Re-
search. 
Sojourner is the glue that connects commu-
nity members. She holds a B.S. in Criminal 
Justice with emphasis in Juvenile Delinquency 
and a J.D., but she is a teacher at heart, al-
ways ready to teach and inspire the commu-
nity at large. She is a worthy candidate for this 
honor and a role model for community leaders 
of all kinds. I am honored to recognize So-
journer for her continued commitment to im-
proving our community and the residents of 
Santa Barbara County. I ask all Members to 
join me today in honoring an exceptional 
woman of California’s 24th Congressional Dis-
trict, Sojourner Kincaid Rolle, for her incredible 
service to her community.

EAGLE SCOUT COURT OF HONOR— 
ANTHONY AND MICHAEL ZEG 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, over the 
weekend, I had the honor to meet Anthony 
and Michael Zeg from Franklinville, New Jer-
sey. Both Anthony and Michael were awarded 
their Eagle Scout rank this year, and I had the 
privilege of attending their Eagle Scout Court 
of Honor. In order to meet the rank of Eagle 
Scout, they must participate in community 
service for their Eagle Scout project. Anthony 
and Michael both completed their project at 
the American Legion Post in Atco, NJ where 
each of them spent over 100 hours repairing 
and painting the building. Anthony is a senior 
in high school and is attending Gloucester 
County Institute of Technology studying HVAC 
and also interns for two different HVAC com-
panies. Michael plans on attending college to 
study engineering and will be interning for an 
engineering company this summer. Both of 
these boys have a bright future ahead of them 
and I wish them nothing but success. God 
Bless Anthony and Michael and God Bless 
America.

ROSE MARY JOHNSON 
HON. CORI BUSH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
and recognize Rose Mary Johnson, a recently 
retired educator. 
Ms. Johnson has led a life of service and 
true love of community. She has spent several 
successful years teaching and serving in ad-
ministrative roles in schools around the region. 
Shortly after beginning her teaching career, 
Johnson enlisted in the United States Army 
Reserves. It was here that she completed and 
retired with 31 years of service at the rank of 
Master Sergeant and with an array of medals 
and honors for her service. 
In 1994, Ms. Johnson ran for the Jennings 
School Board on the platform that children 
needed to receive breakfast at school. She 
was successfully elected and has now just 
completed her 27th and final year on the 
board. Jennings Junior High was recently re-
named Johnson Jennings Junior high school 
in her honor. 
Rose Mary has been recognized by count-
less organizations for her unyielding commit-
ment to her community, and since retiring she 
has continued to volunteer in various capac-
ities. 
For these reasons and more, St. Louis and 
I offer our deepest congratulations and grati-
tude to Rose Mary for her years of service. St. 
Louis has been enriched because of your con-
tributions.

HONORING RETIRING IU 
PRESIDENT MICHAEL MCROBBIE 
HON. TREY HOLLINGSWORTH 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Madam Speaker, in 
honor of President Michael McRobbie’s up-
coming retirement from Indiana University, I 
am proud to recognize his outstanding record 
of leadership and service to higher education. 
Serving nearly 14 years as president, 
McRobbie is among the country’s longest- 
serving presidents of a public higher education 
institution, and his dedication to expanding 
IU’s programs, its impact on students, and the 
University’s greater influence around Indiana 
is nothing short of remarkable. 
Throughout his tenure, President McRobbie 
has worked to ensure IU remained an aca-
demically competitive and excellent institution. 
Under his leadership, President McRobbie 
prioritized building curriculums that were highly 
responsive to the evolving needs of its stu-
dents, the Hoosier state, and industries

decade, IU has strengthened its position as a 
research powerhouse and invested in improv-
ing communities around the state. 
President McRobbie’s commitment to IU 
and also serving Hoosiers has made a lasting 
impact on all who have passed through the in-
stitution. His legacy will live on long past his 
retirement, and I know I join graduates, col-
leagues, and Hoosiers around the state in 
thanking President McRobbie for his service to 
IU.

RECOGNIZING MENDENHALL HIGH 
SCHOOL AS THE MISSISSIPPI 2020 
SCHOOL OF EXCELLENCE 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, the American 
College Application Campaign (ACAC), which 
is part of the ACT’s Center for Equity in Learn-
ing, is a national effort to increase the number 
of first-generation college students and stu-
dents from low-income families pursuing a col-
lege degree or other higher education creden-
tial. About 3.7 million students from all 50 
states and the District of Columbia have been 
served, submitting nearly 6 million college ap-
plications since the campaign’s inception in 
2005. 
ACAC gives a School of Excellence award 
for each state, and I’m proud to recognize 
Mendenhall High School as the 2020 School 
of Excellence award winner for Mississippi. 
Mendenhall High School was selected ‘‘based 
on its demonstrated commitment to student 
success, timely submission of data, and serv-
ing as an exemplary model for our state’s ap-
plication campaign,’’ according to ACAC. 
As its selection for this prestigious award 
demonstrates, Mendenhall High School cre-
ates unique opportunities that have positive 
and lasting impacts on the lives of its stu-
dents. Because of the hard work of teachers, 
staff, and administration, Mendenhall High 
School students are better equipped to pursue 
higher education or become leaders in their 
communities out of high school. 
I am personally thankful for Mendenhall 
High School’s efforts, as I believe the edu-
cation of our youth, who are the future leaders 
of our state and country, is a crucial compo-
nent of our society. I congratulate Mendenhall 
High School once more on being selected for 
this outstanding award and encourage the 
school’s administration to continue this won-
derful work, which is having such a meaningful 
impact on the lives of young men and women.

CONGRATULATING THE PROSPECT 
VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT 
ON 
THE 
OCCASION 
OF 
THEIR 
75TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Ms. DeLAURO. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pride that I rise today to join the many 
family, friends, and community members gath-
ered to add my congratulations to the Volun-
teer Fire Department of Prospect, Connecticut 
as they mark the 75th Anniversary of this very 
special organization. 
Incorporated on September 11, 1945, the 
Prospect Volunteer Fire Department was 
founded and continues today as an all-volun-
teer effort. Over the course of its history, the 
department has grown and re-shaped itself to 
meet the changing needs of the community, 
but at its core has always been dedicated 
members of the community answering the call 
and living up to their motto—‘‘neighbors help-
ing neighbors.’’ Indeed, many of those who 
volunteer today are 2nd, 3rd, and 4th genera-
tions of the Department’s original members. 
And it is not just their volunteer efforts when 
it comes to combatting fires. From the dollars 
raised to buy their first fire truck to the con-
struction of the Department’s first building, to 
their most recent equipment purchases, the 
Department and its volunteer members de-
pend more on the generosity of their neigh-
bors and their community than they do on the 
annual town budget. As their written history 
accounts, ‘‘from the first dances at the old 
Chapel School House, through suppers, fire-
works sales, ‘‘dollar a month club’’, Clyde 
Beatty Circus, and Carnival, the department 
has earned its own way. While a small amount 
of the expenses has been born by the town, 
fire coverage to equal that furnished by the 
Prospect Volunteer Fire Department would 
have cost the town thousands of dollars.’’ 
It is that spirit and deep sense of community 
that is what makes the Prospect Volunteer 
Fire Department such a unique and special or-
ganization. As the Prospect community gath-
ers today to celebrate this wonderful achieve-
ment, I would like to take this opportunity to 
thank all of those who have dedicated not only 
their time, but their lives, to the safety of all 
Prospect residents. Firefighters face risks that 
many of us can never truly comprehend. Each 
day they must be able to perform under in-
tense pressure—literally in life or death situa-
tions. Few things are more important than 
feeling safe in our homes and workplaces. 
Whether hosing down flames, rescuing a child 
from a burning house, or waiting for our call, 
firefighters are always there to protect us and 
provide us with the peace of mind we need to 
sleep at night. I am proud to recognize and 
commend the tremendous commitment they 
have made to our community. Our thanks and 
appreciation can never repay those who put 
their lives on the line to ensure our safety. 
Today’s celebration marks the 75th Anniver-
sary of the Prospect Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment. The courage and dedication dem-
onstrated each day by these men and women 
is reflective of the true spirit in which the de-
partment was established. I am indeed proud 
to rise today to extend my thanks for what 
they do each day, and congratulations on this 
remarkable accomplishment.

ABSECON DOG SHOW 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I want to 
recognize a group of innovative children in 
South Jersey who thought of and started the 
Absecon Dog Show. In 2018, Grace Marzick 
came up with the idea to create a dog show 
for mixed breeds. Grace then told her friend 
Zoey about her idea, so Zoey decided to form 
a committee with a group of their friends. On 
May 23rd, they held their 3rd annual dog 
show. Grace, Zoey, and their friends went 
around town and received sponsorships from 
local businesses to help fund the event. They 
even made posters and hung them up all over 
Absecon in South Jersey to advertise the 
event. This year’s event had the largest turn-
out with 51 dogs making an appearance in the 
show. All of the proceeds raised from the Ab-
secon Dog Show are donated to the Humane 
Society of Atlantic County. For their first event 
in 2018 they raised $600, in 2019 they raised 
$2,100 and so far this year they have raised 
$2,500. These students are remarkable, run-
ning this event solely by themselves. This 
group of extraordinary students have a bright 
future ahead of them and I commend them on 
their dedication and community service. God 
Bless Grace, Zoey, and their friends, and God 
Bless America.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF MILT 
PETERSON 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA

Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness but great respect that I take this 
time to remember Milton V. Peterson of Fair-
fax, VA. 
Mr. Peterson passed away on Wednesday, 
May 26, 2021 at the age of 85 surrounded by 
his family. The founder of Peterson Cos., Mr. 
Peterson will long be remembered for his out-
sized impact on developing numerous major 
projects across the Washington, D.C. region. 
He developed some of the most successful 
and award-winning mixed-use retail, residen-
tial and office developments in Northern Vir-
ginia. In addition to being a visionary devel-
oper, Peterson and his wife, Carolyn estab-
lished the Peterson Family Foundation, donat-
ing more than $100 million to area charities. 
Mr. Peterson was a thoughtful, hardworking, 
and passionate individual who greatly contrib-
uted to countless lives in Northern Virginia. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to rise with me in 
memory of Mr. Milt Peterson. He will be pro-
foundly missed.

HONORING CHLOE CHANG OF PECK 
PLACE SCHOOL IN ORANGE, CON-
NECTICUT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, each year 
the community of Orange, Connecticut gathers 
for a solemn ceremony to mark Memorial Day. 
As part of this ceremony, local elementary 
school students are invited to submit essays 
that share their thoughts on Memorial Day and 
its meaning to them. Submissions from each 
of the community’s three elementary schools 
are selected to be included in the ceremony. 
I had the opportunity to join the Orange cere-
mony this year and was inspired by the words 
of this year’s winners and am pleased to have 
this opportunity to share them. 
Chloe Chang, a student at Peck Place 
School submitted the following essay: 
We dress in red, white, and blue, attend pa-
rades, and honor the men and women who 
have fallen in the Civil War. This holiday has 
been around for 182 years, and we still donate 
money, coupons, and flowers to the perished 
soldiers. Their sacrifices have allowed them 
to serve their country, putting the welfare of 
others before their own. How can we repay 
them? We can give a moment of silence, visit 
their burial ground, and learn about their 
history. 
The holiday started in 1868, where North 
America was fighting to end slavery, and 
South America was fighting to preserve slav-
ery. The war to end slavery lasted for over 4 
years, and Robert E. Lee finally capitulated 
the last Confederate Soldiers to General 
Ulysses S. Grant. ‘‘Decoration Day’’ was de-
clared by General John A. Logan in 1868. In 
‘‘Decoration Day’’, flowers are laid on war 
graves in honor of the deceased. Memorial 
Day holiday was declared a national holiday 
in 1971 to honor those who have died in all 
American wars. 
The Union Army has contributed im-
mensely to our lives, and the least we can do 
is say a little thank you. The invaluable 
changes they made upon our history is inde-
scribable, and we are forever indebted to 
them. These brave men and women have 
done much for their fatherland by sacrificing 
their own lives, and we continue to honor 
them on May 31, Memorial Day. 
For more than two hundred years American 
soldiers have answered the call to defend our 
land and our values of freedom and democ-
racy. With annual ceremonies like the one in 
Orange, that engage our youngest citizens, we 
ensure that we will never forget that our 
armed forces have a long and proud history, 
and that every one of our veterans has dem-
onstrated outstanding courage, dedication, 
and service. It is my honor to rise today to 
thank Chloe Chang for her very special con-
tribution to Memorial Day and her community. 
GREG DESTEFANO 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 24, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I am 
here today to recognize Greg DeStafano, a re-
silient fighter who left an impact on all of those 
he ever met. Greg DeStefano was diagnosed 
with a malignant brain tumor at the age of 10 
and he defied the odds, living more than 30 
years past the doctor’s initial prognosis. 
Greg’s family was by his side every step of 
the way, and they emphasize the fact that he 
left an impact on all of those he met with his 
huge smile and kind heart. Despite the mul-
tiple brain surgeries that Greg underwent, he 
graduated from high school and went on to at-
tend a vocational high school for communica-
tions. After graduating, he traveled to Mexico 
to help children in need. Greg longed to help 
others, despite his own struggles. Greg 
passed away at the age of 42 this year, with 
his family by his side, like they always had 
been. On the day of Greg’s memorial, $13,000 
had been donated in his honor to the Make a 
Wish New Jersey Foundation. One week fol-
lowing his passing, the total raised was over 
$17,000. The impact Greg left not only on his 
family, but his community, is remarkable. God 
Bless Greg and his family and God Bless 
America.
